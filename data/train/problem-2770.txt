“Depends am I still a trophy?” Dean asked smugly.
“I'm usually free,” Castiel blushed, giving Dean the dolls with the instruction to hold them whilst he opened the car doors.
“R-right of course,” Dean scoffed, putting on his tough guy act once more, “Im bored of this anyway,” he lied.
“I… how?”
“You were cheating on me,” Cas said monotonously.
Endless photos, uncomfortable clothes and people staring at me. Why did I have to be a model?
“H-hi,” Dean stutters, blushing. He’s even more gorgeous up close. Why isn’t this angel a model?
“I just want to talk,” Dean smiled, holding his hands up innocently.
Dean was taken back to say the least when he realised he was standing in a cemetery. Who wouldn’t? Dean felt his breath disappear when he realised someone had to be dead. A list spiralled through his head in a millisecond before he turned to the spirit who was standing nearby. Dean needed not say a word for the skeletal man to understand his question, but without saying a word himself, the spirit turned on his heel and walked through the grave yard. Dean understood now why the man offered to let Dean call him Death, why the eerie presence felt so off putting. The man felt as though he belonged among the dead.
“Cas!” Gabriel shouted, causing the kiss to break sooner then he would have liked. Shooting daggers at his brother, Castiel turned to look at Dean who smiled shyly.
When they got in Dean looked around, expecting Castiel to have been there, but stopped in his tracks when he heard the door lock. “Tea or coffee Dean?” Benny asked the heavily breathing boy.
“If you can’t feel your pulse maybe it’s because so much blood is going to your-“
“I have several blondes, they’re the most popular, take your pick…”  Dean beamed. Ducking behind the counter and pulling out a box which contained the doll for Anna. Browsing the dolls, Castiel found the perfect blonde doll with blue eyes. He carefully picked the doll up and cradled her like a baby.
“You call him Cas?” Dean snorted, “Isn’t he your father?”
“Dean we didn’t have sex if that’s what you’re worried about,” Castiel stated simply, hiding a gummy smile by ducking his head, “you broke in whilst drunk, I slept on the couch after you passed out in here.”
“Is it just his dick, or you just a slut?” Benny asked, smirking as Dean’s eyes fell to his throbbing dick. No. he didn’t want this.
“To be fair yesterday all I did was give you a blowjob…” Dean teased, rotating his hips making Castiel hiss.
The girl was cowering behind Dean looking like she belonged in a fairy tale she was that pretty. But Dean, well Dean somehow managed to be prettier. He had shot up and was now taller than Castiel was, and his features had started to firm up… he was a very pretty boy and Castiel was disgusted at himself for thinking that way about another male.
“I-I'm not!” I defended myself, “either way I’m not helping make the sandwiches, I don’t need to learn to cook.”
“I think he said his name was Gabe…” Sam said, getting worried when Dean began to have a coughing fit.
“I can, would you like me to play you a song?” Dean asked her, walking over to the keys. Castiel managed to move just before Dean could sit down. Dean began playing the song Castiel taught him, the one that Castiel had been playing when Dean had come home; the only song Castiel ever composed himself. Dean had shown great promise as a little kid and proved to be a fast learner.
“Do you really want me to leave Dean?” Castiel asked, watching Dean’s face flicker with emotions.
“God you’re beautiful,” Cas whispered into Dean’s ear, “cum for me Dean.” Cas told Dean, biting down softly on Dean’s neck when the other came in his hand, Cas’ own release happening not much longer after that. Cas continued to suck and bite at Dean’s neck as they both came down from their orgasm, Dean shaking beneath him. When Cas finally unattached his mouth from Dean’s neck, with a final lick, his mouth was quickly claimed in another kiss. This time Dean lead the kiss, which was much lazier than the one before, and ended even quicker. The pair stared at each other for a minute, maybe two. Cas soon smiled a wicked sexy smile, leaning over Dean and kissing the hickey. “Mine.” he whispered making Dean’s heart speed up.
If you’re wondering how this story ends, well it ends with two people who truly love each other growing old together. having a family together. And when their time comes moving on to their next adventure together, hand in hand.
“Cas?” Dean asked, not sure if he was ready to talk to the now sitting up brunette.
Flash. More of those damn lights. Can I get some water? No!
“So there are two options here,” Charlie continued for him, catching onto why Kevin was smiling and joining in, “either you bought yourself a present.”
“Who told you?” Dean asked, green eyes pouring his tears of joy.
“As much as I’d love too,” Dean said, making my head snap up hopefully. “I promised dad id take over the company as soon as I was out of school.”
I climb quietly into the car. If I were a woman my father would never have let me do anything with my life.
But the man did not stop as he stood up and rid himself of any garments, before forcefully yanking Dean off the bed and onto his knees, bruising them in the process. “Suck.” The man commanded as he brought Dean’s face towards his half hard cock, “And suck it good or it will hurt your arse more.” Deans beautiful green eyes widened as the man’s dick was pressed against his mouth, Dean opened his mouth and licked it awkwardly, not used to having sex with other men. The other man however didn’t want just a lick, so he shoved it into Dean’s mouth, making the aforementioned teen gag around the monstrous member. Dean felt tears swelling up in his eyes as the man grabbed the back of his head and pulled Dean’s head back only to shove the whole piece of meat back into Dean’s mouth and throat. Just when Dean felt as though he was going to black out from the lack of air the man pulled his cock out of Dean’s mouth and slapped Dean in the face with it “is this what you want you fucking whore?” the man growled, lifting Dean up who was sobbing and begging the man to stop. But the man merely threw Dean face first into the bed, and held his head down as he grabbed something off the small chest of draws to the side of the bed.
“We meet him early morning, about three am, why? Want one last fuck before then?” Gabriel asked, receiving a glare from his brother, which only managed to make him laugh. “I’ll take that as a yes, how about when little Dean-o wakes up I’ll go ‘scope the area’ to give you some alone time, okay?”
“Yeah Cas?” the younger Dean asked, he was absentmindedly staring at Cas’ lips, his pupils delighted.
“Yes.”
“No, I’m just allowed to take care of myself now,” Dean grinned.
Dean loved his car more than he did Sam. It was a 1967 Chevrolet Impala in black. His father had bought it intending to fix her up, but instead Dean had begun to repair it when we were fourteen until it was ready to go when we were seventeen. He loved it. But he rarely let animals in her. So letting me in was already a surprise… I was just hoping he would just let me sleep on his bed whilst he was out. Climbing into the car he placed me on the passenger seat and roared the car to life. The rumbles of the car sent chills down my spine as I curled up in Dean’s discarded jacket.
“I'm still hard brat, if you want I can finish what I started,” Castiel growled, his free hand scratching down Dean’s side, drawing a hiss of pain from the younger. Castiel whipped his leg over so he was laying on one side of the boy, still keeping his legs wrapped around so the kid couldn’t escape as his and grabbed Dean’s cock, which twitched causing Dean to realize, although he was scared and being molested, he was enjoying it more then he liked. “Your little prick seems to think I should continue.” Castiel smirked, causing Dean to look at his face, his breath hitched as he began to freak out.
A beloved brother
“Fucking hell,” Crowley curses from the front seat. I look up at him to see him growling at the traffic that bloomed up in front of us.
“Ben is only two, and I didn’t want to marry her! I’m in love with-“ Dean tried, grabbing the brunet’s wrist, his heart thumping. Why was he about to admit his feelings. He wasn’t even sure of them. It was Stockholm syndrome. Castiel turned to Dean, backing him into a wall and trapping him there.
The now extended group snuck into the sewers, making their way along through the disgusting human waste to the only safe exit of the city.
Dean was disappointed when Castiel left, kissing him on the cheek before taking a cab home in a blushing state. So he decided that, because his mum was running the store today, he would finish his little Castiel. Which he did, before getting some wire and securing it to the makeshift tree and writing a sign that said ‘not for sale’ before spending the day making new dolls to sell in the Christmas rush. Flirtatious texts were all the communication Dean had with Castiel until the twenty third. Castiel would be staying with his father who lived in Topeka from the next day till the end of the year. He invited him to the store, finally intending to show him his angel.
He sent, looking up to see her red hair already appearing from the crowd.
“Are you asking me on a date?”
Nobody cares. I’m a model, I don’t have brains. I’m just a dumb toy for people to look at.
“How does he know about the boy?” Samuel Campbell, Sam’s namesake, muttered.
“Meet us by the Christmas Tree when you get off!” Charlie grinned, dragging me off as I stared at a grinning Dean.
“Prince Castiel, take care of him, he’s a bit of a doofus,” Lisa teased, poking her tongue out at Dean who playfully glared back at her.
I have a partner this time, she’s nice. But she looks so sickly. Do I look like that?
“Where’s mum?” Dean asked, his eyebrows furrowing in worry.
Mere seconds passed before Dean ran in after Gabriel who was waving his hand in front of the faces of various people, pointing when they couldn’t see him. “You’re the second ghost!” Dean cried, pointing his finger accusingly at Gabriel who looked at him and grinned cheekily.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
I fell asleep five minutes in.
“Why weren’t you at school yesterday?” Dean asked, probably trying to calm me down as Charlie nudged me back under the arch, and as he stepped into my personal space.
“Kill joy,” Gabriel laughed, winking at a frozen Dean as he left the room and closing the door. Castiel pushed himself off the bed and walked over to Dean and wrapped his arms around the smaller boy, kissing the top of his head.
“Mum!”
“My name is Crowley, and I’m a… demon.” He said, obviously lying about what he was.
“I'm fine, I’m hungry for something else…” Castiel told the blonde, pulling him onto his lap.
“No, I still have work to do,” Dean groaned, “as nobody has agreed to work tomorrow I might as well not come in tomorrow anyway.”
“Well I’ll walk you over then,” Dean said with a pout, his hand squeezing Castiel’s as he pulled him towards the stage, Castiel knew that Dean could see the blush and honestly he didn’t care.
“Then why are you blushing?” Dean enquired, raising an eyebrow… I considered telling him I’m gay… but in reality I’m not sure, I’ve only ever liked one person, Dean. Sure I’ve found other people attractive, I’d have to be a robot to not. But I don’t think it would go down well if I told him I was more attracted to him.
“You’re still hard.”
“What do you think happens to children on the streets?” he said in way of answer before he once more raised his cane before clacking it back to the ground.
I’m definitely in love
“I'm scared that I’m going to wake up now… scared that this never happened. I don’t want to lose you to Benny again. I don’t think my heart could take that,” I admitted, losing control of a few tears that dribbled down my face.
The woman lead him down the hall to a room which she knocked on the door of before opening it and shoving Dean in before closing it and locking the door from without. The room was pitch black at first, having very little sunlight, but after a moment Dean was able to make out a room with a larger then necessary bed, a table, a dresser and a bath, as Dean looked around the room he noticed a shuffling sound on the bed and snapped his head to look at it. “Meg is that you?” A raspy male voice asked from near the bed, or rather from the moving sheets on the bed.
“Claire go start getting ready for school, I’ll make breakfast.” Castiel instructed the blonde teen. Nodding she wandered back into her room. Castiel made them French toast with bacon and maple syrup. He was just finishing as Claire walked back out with her school bag. They ate in silence, before Claire left for school to meet up with her friend Annie. Castiel smirked when Claire blushed at the mention of the other girl’s name. After getting dressed he grabbed his car keys and Castiel headed out to the doll shop, intending to get the dolls before going to work.
“You’re place?” Dean echoed, looking around at his surroundings, “so Sammy is here?”
Dean, being a complete and utter moron, proceeded to choke on his own tongue. A feat few can truly master. After a rather severe coughing fit, Dean stared at his friend, heart hammering in time with his head, both hurting simultaneously. “I-I’m sorry, I know you’re gay, and that doesn’t mean you have to like me back, I really never intended to admit it to you honestly. People do stupid things when drunk, say stupid things. I should just go; I have to make sure I’m ready to go home tomorrow. I hope you have a lovely Christmas, and that you get exactly what you wished for. I’m going. Bye.” Before Dean could escape Castiel’s room however, Castiel caught his wrist in a gentle but firm grip, making Dean’s dumb bitch brain splutter, and his heart flutter, and his legs feel like melting butter, and all the other appropriate rhymes.
“Lil Cas, where do you think you’re going?” Dean laughed, holding me up to look in my eyes, laughing when I stuck my tongue out trying to lick his face. I mean he doesn’t know I'm me… perfect opportunity!
“Yes Claire?” Benny asked, stopping his stirring of whatever he was stirring. He leant over the counter to get a better look at the little girl. She was clearly too young to have been alone and yet she clearly was.
“Yes my cherry pie?” Castiel asked, looking at the man who was so beautiful it should have been illegal.
Dean called his shop girl as soon as Castiel left, asking when she was getting there as he had a doll to finish. She arrived not long after the call and Dean went to make the clothes for the angel. A dark blue suit with a blue and white silk tie and a light brown coat. It took him nearly half the  day to sow the small clothes, but when they were done they made the little angel doll look like Castiel. After dressing the doll he went to work on making little wings. He decided they needed to be black to match his hair, they were nearly done when he got a text saying where Castiel lived and that he would be home in an hour. Dean pushed himself away from his work station, he dashed downstairs to tell Jo, his shop girl, to close up and go home. She did as she was told and Dean had a quick shower, getting himself into a black suit with a red tie. Grabbing his keys Dean drove his baby, a 67 Chevrolet Impala, to pick Castiel up. All but running to the door of the small house, Dean knocked on the door nervously.
Dean Winchester didn’t look like much, just the same as almost every other new baby boy, but Castiel felt a smile tug at his lips as Dean whined slightly in his sleep. Tomorrow the house would be flooded with well-wishing family and friends.  As the couple placed their son in his crib and retired for the night Castiel found himself staying and watching over the sleeping child.
“I was invited, Sam is my brother you know?”
Castiel would only leave the attic when Dean was at school or in bed after that, Mary had gotten a job seeing as both her boys were at school now, and John was always at work as well. So Castiel would wander around the house, amusing himself with their modern appliances, unless it was the stuff in the kitchen… he didn’t particularly want to burn his home to the ground. He mostly read books though, and played the piano. He had missed playing piano.  It was the only skill he really had. So when he was innocently playing and didn’t hear the front door close, or giggling well he wasn’t about to stop playing. It was only when the door to the sitting room slid open did he think to make himself invisible from everyone, including Dean – a skill he had learnt when said boy had turned thirteen and nearly saw Castiel watching him blow out the candles. But now Dean was sixteen, and appeared to be skipping school with some girl.
“Are you okay? You missed dinner.” Dean asked, sitting on the bed next to his equally beautiful husband.
“None of that matters baby boy,” Mary told him, holding out her arms to offer a hug. But Dean shook his head.
And yet now, to his despair it was void of life, having been turned into a clothing store. Not a person was in sight as snow lightly sprinkled down around them. “W-where is everyone? Where’s Benny? Surely he wouldn’t let this happen!” Dean muttered, looking around for any sign of life. And yet he soon found himself facing the final ghost, a troubled expression on his face. “What happened?” he finally asked, leaving it at that simple question.
“Suck it,” the man growled shoving it into the whimpering boy’s face. Dean shook his head, he only wanted Castiel’s dick. Wait.
“Perfect to raise an army of children?” the man – John – joked, making Castiel wince slightly, he didn’t understand modern humour.
“No but I think I might develop a fetish for listening to that voice of yours,”
“Merry Christmas Cas.” Dean breathed, a little breathless from the kiss.
“Now where shall we go?” Gabriel asked, flicking his lollipop stick at Dean who flinched in disgust, “let’s go see Benny, he should be doing something interesting this fine day.” Gabriel began to skip towards a large building with large windows. Inside was a group of homeless people, eating and socialising. Gabriel suddenly stepped through the glass, phasing through like a ghost, leaving a gobsmacked Dean in his wake.
“Fuck I love you but you have a sex addiction.”
“What do you think?” Castiel asked.
“Cheshire! Calm down!” an older female voice said, I watched as Cookie pounced off my bed and sat down in front of me.
“D-Dean that was amazing…” Cas spoke softly, trailing his finger in a circle on Dean’s chest. Dean just laughed.
“I broke up with you,” Cas pointed out, his eyes glancing at the front door.
“It’s not a sex addiction it’s an addiction to you.”
“Doesn’t he have agoraphobia?” Sam asked, raising an eyebrow, “why would he willingly leave the house?”
“Cas, the human one, had a new kitten in his room after Mick told him he’s not allowed another cat…” Gabe explained, reaching over and scratching me behind the ear.
“Would she think I was a creep if I tried to talk to her?”
“I like to think so…”
“You named him after Cas?” My dad asked, rubbing my head and chuckling.
“He thought I was having an affair with you,” Dean bit, his eyes watering again, but he wouldn’t shed a tear.
“I-I,” Castiel stuttered, blushing as Dean stepped back into his personal space, tilting his head up so green and blue eyes had no distractions.
“Hello,” I smile - a fake smile. I don’t know if I can really smile anymore… “can I help you?”
Five years later and Dean still talked to Castiel non-stop, Castiel also helped him with homework to the best of his abilities. but one day when Dean was sitting in his room doing homework, his father came in. “Dean! What are you up to?” he asked, crouching down so he could look over his shoulder at Dean’s homework, “ah homework!”
Stealing a pair of Dean’s track pants and a tee shirt he put them on – drawing the draw string as tight as possible because they were too loose on him, before he ran downstairs, just in time to collide with Dean. “Dean!” Castiel cried, his eyes giving away his confusion and excitement.
“Okay, I’m going now,” Dean made his way towards the door where Castiel stood, still in his towel. “Cas! When did you wake up?” he asked, finally realising who he had been talking to the entire time. He stared at his friend’s chest for a moment, swallowing thickly as he tried to hid the underwear behind his back.
“Thank you.”
“No he’s not!” Meg buts in before I can reply.
“Y-your brother was watching us sleep…” Dean tried to explain, heat rising on his neck.
“As you wish,” Gabriel told him, glancing sadly at Dean before he opened his mouth to say something but thought better of it.
The next thing I knew the pair were gone and I was asleep on the matrass, wrapped in the blanket that we normally left there. Rubbing my eyes, I looked around, seeing that the light outside was that that normally suited the morning. I slept the entire night? “What the fuck?” I rasped, looking down at my hands and smiling when I found they were hands. Only thing was… I could have sworn I still had a tail… I reached around my back and clasped at what felt like a tail… to find I still had a tail. “What the fuck!” I cried.
“I’ll give you a lift, okay?”
Castiel was cursing, more than usual.  Gabriel had watched as he had all but killed Benny. Gabriel had stood silently, watching as Castiel had refused to hand the passed out boy to the guards and took the feeble looking kid to his room. Dean was five foot and eleven inches, but in Castiel’s arms he seemed like a child. Gabriel had only intervened to tell the Queen what had happened, how they had been friends with Benny who sent them to save the prince. Lies. But he was scared his baby brother would slip up and admit who they were. Gabriel laughed when the Queen told them she wasn’t an idiot. She was glad they had come. She wanted her husband dead although she didn’t know they were the Princes of the East. Castiel had been shocked when the boy had moaned his name in his sleep. But not as shocked as the queen. And definitely not as amused as Gabriel. “Dean is in love with… Castiel?” the queen asked, looking at the brothers, obviously confused.
“No!” Dean cried, running into the kitchen, quickly followed by Mary who swooped down and picked up Sammy, bouncing him on her hip as she walked into the kitchen.
“Very chick flick moment of you,” Dean’s voice cracked nervously, his face going bright red as Castiel stepped into his personal space, face hovering closely to Dean’s. Dean could smell chocolate and mint on Castiel’s breath, making his heart flutter. Thankfully they were both too love struck to realise how terrible Dean’s own breath smelt, both lost in each other’s eyes, hearts pounding as their fingers intertwined.
“No Gabe, Dean has a horse fetish,” Castiel laughed, massaging Dean’s butt with his hand before pulling the poor boy’s pants back up and tying the rope back up. And laying Dean down letting the calming boy use his lap as a pillow, and playing with the blonde hairs that had grown a little since he had been living with them…
“Cas? How did I get here?” Dean asked, looking around in confusion.
“Dean…” Castiel felt his breath hitch… was it creepy? A little. Was it sweet? Incredibly. Did he love it? Absolutely.
“Then...”
“P-please,” Dean stuttered, not able to finish his sentence, causing Castiel to flip him over, at which point he began to struggle to break free of the obvious lunatic’s vice like grip. He squeezed his eyes shut as a finger invaded his arse, bending and wriggling before it was pulled out and joined by a second finger, which joined in on the wriggling action before he pulled them out and pushed them back in, scissoring them around and brushing against whatever flesh they could find on the inside until Dean squeaked. Castiel rubbed against that spot a second time, causing Dean to make more lewd sounds. Castiel leaned closer to Dean, his mouth nibbling on the latter’s ear before he breathily asked, “My little pet, do you want my cock to hit that spot?” Castiel pulled back to find Dean bright red, before the boy began to rock his hips against Castiel’s fingers. Castiel took that as a yes and pulled them out and picked up his discarded oil from earlier. He didn’t even use it earlier.
“How? How can anything I say ruin my brother’s marriage?”
“Okay.” Dean shrugged, looking at Castiel with Ernest eyes.
“Are you okay?” he asked, stroking a stray hair out of my face.
I leave the door open. We talk. And talk. And talk.
“Yes Dean?”
“Thank you Lisa,” Dean smiled, Castiel smiled at the two, knowing he had no place to butt in.
“Don’t force yourself Dean,” Castiel instructed, turning Dean’s face to look him in the eye.
“Stop with your cheesy lines,” Dean groaned, rolling off Castiel onto his back, only to have Castiel throw a leg over his body and straddle his waist.
“No! I don’t want to-!” Dean attempted to protest, but his protest was cut short by Benny shoving his cock into his mouth. Seeing white Dean could have sworn he heard Castiel’s voice.
I don’t remember the last time I ate! I don’t remember the last time I slept for a reasonable amount of time.
“I don’t fucking know… can we go get something to eat? I'm starving,” Gabe pouted, grabbing Sam by the hand and dragging him into the kitchen.
“And stare at it so adoringly,” Samandriel pipped up, instantly shrinking back when Cas glared at him.
They would later learn that Dean was only turned on because Deans a masochist…
“No, I would like to go,” Dean growled making Crowley pout, but rather than put up a useless fight, Crowley snapped his fingers and the scene dissolved, he was soon in a new room, just as familiar as the last, “what the fuck Crowley? I thought you were taking me home?”
Men and women both perve on me as I walk over to the set in the skimpy underwear. Who would ever buy these?
Groan. I’m so tired, how do they expect me to remain attractive if I am running myself ragged?
“NO!” Dean spoke attempting to defend himself, not noticing Castiel drop his hand and pick him up bridal style before walking to his room and throwing the boy on his bed.
“Right, because that wouldn’t get you thrown into the nut house,” Sam teased, making both Dean and Castiel wince.
“I have a girlfriend!” Sam called back.
“Can you tell me why you did it?” Dean asked quietly. Castiel’s eyes went wide and he looked away from Dean, disgusted with himself.
“Don’t ever stop believing in me?” Castiel asked quietly, “I got lonely.”
•	Charlieeeee save me!
“No thanks,” I blushed, tears already threatening to spill. Sam being a really intelligent young man noticed and smirked.
“We aren’t naughty!” the younger version of Dean argued, his eyes glittering with Christmas joy.
“P-please don’t force me to leave,” Castiel begged, if he had been human he would have been crying.
Knock. Knock. Knock.
“O-oh right… it’s not mosquito season right?” Cas asked, cocking his head cutely. Dean raised an eyebrow. Was this seriously all Cas wanted to ask? Why couldn’t Balthazar tell him?
I’m stripped again, being perved on by the sleazy old man who runs this joint.
“Dean there’s a kitten on your shoulder!” Dean’s cousin Jo squeaked, pulling me off his shoulder and scratching behind my ear. I admit I involuntarily purred at the touch.
“Don’t know…” Dean told him truthfully, watching the man sit up and pull him closer, rubbing his hand down Dean’s side making the blonde shiver.
“W-what?” I asked, my eyes dropping to his lips. I was faintly aware of the voices of the girls in line telling us to hurry up.
“I am,” he confirmed, his voice worn and tired, with a sombre tone to it.
“She’s not so much a girlfriend as a girl I want to get with,” Dean blushed; Castiel just stared at the human and blinked.
Dean Winchester was said to be one of the most beautiful people in the world. His green eyes could be compared to many things, but none of them compared to their beauty. His hair was softer than the feather of a dove soaked in the milk of an ass and dried in the heat of a dragon’s fire. But once again the colour could be described as many things, but the most agree with is caramel. And for the sake of your dignity we won’t go into his skin… and he was seen this way from the age of nine. But at the age of sixteen, two years into the war, he was taken from his home because his father valued his own life over his son’s. And this is where our story starts.
“I am the one who gave you a career!”
“Fuck, I’m so sorry.” The man said, pulling away from Dean to look him over. “this is not how I wanted to have us meet, my pet.” Dean paled at the word pet. Realizing this was the man his father had sold him to.
“Oh really?” Mary teased, “does that mean you deserve these presents.”
The alternate ending which is a little less sad and a lot more confusing because I am officially sleep deprived.
“Dean.” I said my voice firm as I could possibly get it. I looked into his beautiful green eyes. I felt myself leaning in, and kissing him. It only lasted a second. But by the time I pulled away the damage was done. I pushed myself off the ground and walked over to the dining room table where my bag was slung over one of the chairs.
Okay in my defence… I stopped complaining when I got into Dean’s arms because… holy fuck I had dreamed about it since I was fourteen and realized I was as straight as a squiggle. Dean was the star athlete of my school years. He started off being just my best friend… then as we drifted apart in high school, I realised that I was pretty much in love with him. But the day I meant to confess to him I saw him kissing… Benny Lafitte, his current boyfriend. Dean isn’t completely gay like me. He’s bisexual. And man did he use that to his advantage when we were sixteen. Hell he accidentally knocked up a girl in our year named… Lisa… I think. So naturally I nuzzled into his shirtless glory. He had a nice chiselled body from working in his dad’s shop since graduation. And the best part? He was only in boxers…. Drool! Dean carried me to his room and nudged the door open… to reveal Benny laying on his bed… a blanket covering his crotch… but not well… “Benny… looks what Gabe just left me!” Dean laughed, stroking my head. Good boy I thought. Purring and nuzzling into Dean.
“Dean,” Cas gasped, “please tell me that isn’t what I think it is.”
“Ba Humbug,” Dean hissed, stepping over to his personal Whiskey and pouring himself a glass which he drowned instantly before pouring another.
“Oh god,” Dean heaved, crouching to the ground and tugging at his hair with his hands, “p-please show me something good that comes by my decisions? Is there anything? Is Cas okay? Sam?”
“Not if you bring her food,” Benny chuckled, handing Dean a bowl which he promptly filled with soup, “if you end up adopting her you give me every right to start calling you daddy!”
No. no I don’t.
“Or you brought Dean a gift,” Sam mumbled, making Cas’s blush darken almost worryingly.
“Fuck.” Castiel swore, turning around and throwing his arms around Dean and kissing him.
Clack. Clack. Clack.
“Yes!” Dean shouted, “go away! I don’t need you anymore!” Castiel just nodded and let himself evaporate, floating up into the attic where they had stored the fainting couch and forgotten about it.
“I had ulterior motives in inviting you and your brother here for Christmas,” Cas admitted to Dean, his face bright red, and Dean being a shit decided to play with him.
“Cas who are you running from?”
“Yes.”
“Benny by this point is awaiting his hanging, we’re in your room and your mother knows who I am,” Castiel told the pained boy, scooping him up in his arms and hugging him.
“You do know me Dean,” Castiel promised, “my name is Castiel.” Dean’s expression changed pretty quickly from confusion to fear back to confusion.
“Home.” Dean huffed out a laugh, running over to the front door and gliding his hand down the wooden door.
“My name is Dean Winchester, I’m a good friend of Benny’s,” he introduced himself, holding his hand out for the little girl to shake.
“What happened?”
“It’s a Christmas miracle!” Gabriel cheered, dragging a gobsmacked Sam out of the doorway, “go grab him one of your sweaters, Im going to pump him full of as much Christmas as I can that he will be a Christmas blimp!”
Castiel relents,
“Cas… why didn’t you tell me how you died?” Dean asked quietly, not even replying to Castiel’s well wishes.
, Castiel told himself.
“Are you seriously intending to give me a cooking lesson?” I asked my best friend Dean as he scurried from one place in his kitchen to another. He was pulling out plates and knives and all sorts of things out… just to make sandwiches. There were five different knives. As Dean pulled out each knife he named them.
“Fuck off Gabriel, I’m really not in the mood for you,” Dean muttered, brushing past the shorter man, and going through the door. But rather than going into his room he found himself on the street, the sun having risen enough to light up the city.
Snap. snap. snap.
“Yeah, my mum used to own the place and taught me how, I guess it just became something I loved,” the man grinned, “I suppose you came for the doll…”
He looks nervous.
“Oh, thank god.” Dean flinched slightly as Castiel sighed and sat down beside Dean on the bed, the bed dipping towards the other man.
When they made it out of the city they chose to camp in a different spot to where they camped last. They didn’t light a fire. Lisa curled up with her baby boy. Sam curled up in a protective huddle around Adam. And Castiel in a protective huddle around Dean. Gabriel stayed up as guard, only to wake them when the sun rose, having collected the two horses from where they had left them. They packed the horses with the four extra bags and headed back to the east. Letting Sam and Adam ride one horse and Lisa and Ben ride the other. It took longer to get back to the east, then it had to get to the south. But when they did they changed into more appropriate clothes for the weather, and met in a quiet unused chamber of the castle. “So Dean, going to introduce me to your boyfriend?” Lisa asked five minutes into the silence.
“Maybe not an army, just a few!” Mary said solemnly as she walked towards the kitchen. Castiel followed her in, scaring away a rat before she could see it. “The kitchen is massive!” she cried, clapping her hands together excitedly. Castiel remembered his mother loved to cook – despite the fact that they had a cook employed – so she had made sure the kitchen was unnecessarily large and had large windows despite none of the other houses having anything like it.
“With me and Gabe!” I suggested, thinking of my older brother who was currently in Law School over in New York. He had a spare room in his apartment that he had offered to me when I got into Cornell University. I was a third generation Alumni. Along with my three brothers who went there, making my chances high of getting in. Which I did, much to my father’s glee.
After a few minutes of waiting Castiel pulled himself out of Dean and standing them both up, and watching as his semen dribbled down Dean’s thigh. “Can you walk?” he asked the heavily breathing teen who attempted to step away but almost fell. And would have if Castiel hadn’t wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him closer to him. “I’ll take that as a no.” he laughed as the blonde blushed.
“Well now, I think there are two naughty boys in my living room,” Mary Winchester’s voice cooed, unlike her ghost from earlier she was now wearing a hideous green, Christmas sweater and black jeans, her long hair plaited behind her.
“And you’re Dean’s imaginary friend aren’t you,” Mary asked quietly, “that’s where he got the name.”
Cas doesn’t understand hickeys…
“I suppose not… but I’m not sharing a bed,” Dean laughed, drawing my attention to his face. To his beautiful face. I began to try and count each of the freckles on his face. I always only got to twenty before he moved.
“Is this Lil’ Cas?” Mary awed, plucking me out of Dean’s arms to look at me. I just meowed at her and tried to squirm back to my hurt Dean. My Dean. Mine. I shook my head, realizing that I was getting possessive over him. Becoming more cat like.
Castiel had already lost his entire family. He had a pocket of tokens he had no intention to use and could already feel his heart clenching with the beginnings of a panic attack. He just wanted to go home and get away from the Christmas Fair. Gabe had run off after some giant of a boy that was apparently in his year. Lucifer had gone off somewhere with his boyfriend Michael, probably off to snog under a tree. His parents went off to judge the cake contest, seeing as the fair was run by the church it was only natural that his father, the minister and his mother was in charge of the Women’s Society and the youth group. So the black haired male was all alone in an unfamiliar environment.
“Memento,” was all Dean offered, pulling out another pair and giving them the same treatment before deciding that they were the pair he was going to take. Castiel held his hand over his mouth and stifled a giggle, Dean’s face looked so innocent.
“Yeah, but I don’t really want to talk about him,” Dean whispered, “I’d much rather find out how you’re so beautiful.”
“I am aware of the date,” Dean groaned, tilting his head back and groaning loudly.
He had barely closed his eyes when he heard the first clang. Dean naturally looked up in curiosity, perhaps a racoon or cat had merely made its home within his house, and if that was the case he would call a pest remover after the holidays as people had an odd habit of not working on the dreadful day. When certain there was nothing in his room he closed his eyes once more, only to be startled into sitting up once more, however Dean was shocked to find himself not alone this time, in front of him was his long gone parents.
I step aside and let him into the room. Our hands brush. My heart skips a beat.
“Jesus Cas! I knew you were innocent but I didn’t think you were this innocent,” Dean giggled, sobering up when he heard Cas huff angrily. “Sorry Cas.”
Dean was scared to say the least. He was a prisoner of war! His father, the ‘honourable’ lord Winchester gave him up to save his own hide. He gave up his sixteen year old son. Who was soon to become the sex slave of some bloke named ‘Castiel’? So yeah he had every right to be scared. His baby brother needed him! But no. instead he was stuck in a metal box, that only had holes in so he could breath and nothing else. He couldn’t see where he was going. He didn’t care. All he wanted to do was run home. But it was too late for that; he must have been hours away from home. And judging by the heat he was somewhere in the East, which meant the metal box would soon become a small personal hell.
“N-no, a w-woman s-shoved me i-in h-here…” Dean stuttered, pressing his back against the wall as a figure rose from the bed and walked over to him before grabbing his wrist and dragging Dean to the bed which the figure then threw him on and climbed on top of him.
“Sorry!” she giggled leaving the two grown men to stare awkwardly.
Crowley’s off on the phone again and three people are surrounding me, taking off the makeup and clothes and shoving me into a button up and slacks before practically throwing me at Crowley.
“Marry me?”
“Then why does my waist hurt?”
“And you’re both crazy,” Sam mused getting a dirty look from Dean.
Dean sat at his desk going over his homework, school was over for the day and now he was holed up in his hot dormitory trying to get through his science homework for call tomorrow. Cas, his dorm-mate, was nowhere to be found. But if Dean had to guess, Cas was probably hiding in the library like the little nerd he was.
By the time they reached the border, Dean had cum about fifteen times, Castiel was surprised it wasn’t more, considering they were riding for four hours, and several times they were racing Gabriel. By the time they were at the border Dean had fallen asleep in Castiel’s arms, a blush still present on his face and his little friend still incredibly hard, the twins set up camp as the teenager slept off his many orgasms. “So what did you do to Dean to make him orgasm that many times?” Gabriel asked as he returned from getting wood for their fire, only to find Castiel with Dean in his lap, taking the butt plug out of the boy’s arse with a pop. “D-did you put a butt plug in his arse and make him ride a horse with it in?”
“I am not in love with him!” Castiel sneered, heat rising on his neck.
“And after losing your mother, after high school and then losing your father,” Crowley continued for him, looking saddened.
“Yeah but I mummy says I’m not allowed to bring Cas,” Dean told the older man seriously, making Castiel laugh.
“Dean-o! You’re awake! How was the ride here?” Gabriel asked the groggy boy, causing him to jump, and accidentally kick Castiel. But the man seemingly remained asleep.
“The fuck are you doing here?” Dean asked, glaring at the shorter man.
“Why does he want me when there are beautiful women all through the castle, ones like Meg and Hannah and Hael! I’m just a sixteen year old boy…” Dean muttered, still watching the sleeping adult.
“I wanted to invite you to the Christmas party Im having tomorrow,” Sam cheered jumping off the couch and bouncing like an excited puppy, “Gabriel has been cooking all day and I’m sure my house probably smells like the gingerbread cookies he has undoubtedly made too many of.”
“Dean.” Castiel snapped, making Dean look up to find blue eyes alight with concern, jealousy, hope and several other emotions which clouded the beautiful blue hue they normally had.
Castiel did not understand Dean’s ‘video games’ he had watched Dean play them countless times, but he could not work out how they worked. He had freaked Dean out a few weeks ago by turning the newest console off just as he came into the room. That had been amusing to watch. Dean and Benny both freaking out. Two buff jocks. Acting like they saw a ghost…
“Cas died because of me,” Dean sobbed, dropping his head into his hands and sucking in a rugged breath.
It would be nearing on twelve am when Dean would finally realise that the kitchen window was not only lower than the bedroom window, but the lock had been broken in a particularly heated nerf war. They were still finding nerf bullets around the house in some unlikely areas. It would take Dean another half hour to figure out how to get through the window without breaking anything. He would break three mugs and a plate getting in.
“You really are a sex addict!”
“Why did you stay?”
Dean started school in the autumn of the next year. And within the first day he had made friends with two boys. Benny and Gabriel. Of course Castiel didn’t go to school with him, but he did hear all about Dean’s new friends when he got home from school. He told Castiel all about the first day, then the second, third and every day. Castiel didn’t mind he found it adorable that the child could be so excited about something that in this time period seemed to be so trivial.
“I hope he says yes,” Claire smiled softly, before looking down, “if you’re going to adopt me does that mean I have to go back to my foster family first?”
“You’re lucky the sex is good…”
“Presents! Presents! Presents!” Sammy cried, bouncing up and down, one of his hands still gripping their mother’s leg.
“Good boy,” Castiel told the boy on his lap, moving his hands away from the younger’s arse to hold his waist. Dean, whose hands were holding him up a little bit more then he would be otherwise let his hands move to wrap around Castiel’s neck.
“Hey Gabe… is the news true?”
“Will you be my boyfriend?” Dean practically begged, his spare hand cupping Castiel’s cheek with such softness that Castiel was sure he was dreaming.
“Why is Sammy working?” Dean asked quietly, “he loves Christmas, and Gabriel would never let him work on Christmas.”
“Whenever your free, call or text me,” he says, handing me a card. My heart stops and I feel my face heat up. Crowley huffs angrily.
“I kinda expected you to be somewhere in your early twenties, but she can’t be that young…”
“Castiel still lives here,” Dean told the woman who looked startled and a little bit ill.
“Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!” the smaller boy cheered joining his brother at the bottom of the flight of stairs.
“Castiel! He’s my angel friend!” Dean told the old man, he had worked out how to say Castiel’s full name a while ago, but still hadn’t realised that Castiel was a ghost.
“H-how?” Mary asked, rushing over and looking at Castiel, “you even look like he did in the portraits I saw!”
“Sorry Cas, seems like your name sake is missing, and mum won’t be home with cat food for a while… how long do you think you’ll last without killing me?” Dean laughed, picking me up and going over to the couch where he laid down with me on his stomach. He switched on the TV and went to the recordings, flicking on some show called Dr. Sexy…
“Dean! Oh my lord what happened?” She asked, walking over in quick strides and grabbing Dean’s wrist, dragging him to the kitchen. Me still in his arms. Inside the kitchen, Ellen and my dad stood, talking about me. Stopping when they saw Dean and his eye.
“If it isn’t a mosquito bite what is it?”
“Cas what is it?” Dean asked, pushing the larger man off of him.
“Fuck it,” he gave up, pouncing on me, knocking me into a lying position, licking and biting down my body, making me moan his name.
“Lil’ Cas?” Lucifer asked, raising an eyebrow at Dean who blushed awkwardly under the watch of the room full of people.
“We killed my dad…” Dean shrugged.
“Nobody!” Dean cried, a blush forming on his cheeks, “i-it was consensual!”
“Good. The bastard deserves it!” Dean spat, turning onto his back and laughing bitterly. Castiel took this opportunity to straddle his lover and looked down at the beautiful boy.
“That’s because they can’t see me,” Castiel told the child sadly, “but I don’t mind.”
“Wait don’t you have to be dead to be a ghost?” Dean asked disbelievingly.
“I'm twenty five,” Castiel blushes, hoping that wasn’t too old for the green eyed man…
“We are in the city,” the driver – Meg – sighs, “you had to expect this.”
“She’s just jealous that I prefer fucking you to her,” Castiel told the boy before stealing a quick kiss from the shocked boy and releasing him to clean himself of any trace of sex. Dean followed suit, wincing every time he moved the wrong way, and wishing they had used some of the oil that Castiel had in his room. After he was clean he looked back at Castiel who was leaning against a tree watching him. Needless to say Dean blushed when said man came closer to the poorly dressed boy and pulled him flush against him.
“Heya Sammy,” Dean greeted, suddenly feeling really shy, “I’m not too early am I?”
“She won’t, because she knows… never mind, are you okay? You were just raped after all,” Castiel asked, looking Dean up and down.
“Shut up Sammy,” Dean said, taking Castiel by the wrist and dragging him into the kitchen where John and Mary were quietly bickering. “Mum, Dad,” Dean quietly interrupted the pair, his hand slipping into Castiel’s and squeezing it.
“Dean, he was probably be raped more than anyone else should be when people in jail found out what he was in for,” Cas told the bitter young man.
“I definitely did not want to be here!” Dean hissed, looking towards the door as it slowly creaked open revealing a roughly sixteen year old Dean.
2021’
“Y-you need to suck the right spot… and for longer,” Dean told him, not trusting his voice to go over a whisper.  He watched as Cas once again bended over his arm and sucked it, but this time he sucked at a different part of Dean’s arm. When he pulled away there was a dark red mark.
“No, you no longer own this place,” the ghost explained, making Dean’s eyes go wide, “you now work for the owner, earning less than half of what you used to.”
“Did you just Han Solo me?”
The end.
“Why does your arse hurt?” Castiel retorted, faking sympathy.
“Benny!” he laughed, running over to the much older man and hugging him. Castiel watched with interest, and perhaps a little bit of jealousy, as the man laughed and looked Dean up and down, his hands not leaving the boy’s shoulders.
“You two know each other?” Dean asked, looking between the two males.
“But he broke up with me,” Dean choked, tears streaming down his face. “I-I’m so sorry Cas.”
“Gabe, is this about the other Winchester boy? I know you remember spending time with him when he was little, but you really can’t get too attached to the enemy,” Michael told him, looking at the territory map.
“The you would make me the happiest man ever,” Dean laughed, laughing even harder when Cas threw himself into Dean’s arms, causing both of them to fall into the thick snow. Dean felt Cas’ lips tentatively press against his, and all he could think was ‘home’ as he wrapped his arms around the other man’s waist. Grinning even as Sam’s voice told them to get inside and stop canoodling on his front lawn, or when Gabriel dragged Sam into the snow nearby to make snow angels. And when they finished kissing, they stared – because that’s what they were good at, staring at each other like the other was the best thing ever created.
“Fergus! Don’t lie about what you are!” a beautiful red headed woman scolded him, appearing out of nowhere.
“It didn’t look like lipstick Dean…” Cas grumbled making Dean chuckle again. Dean sat up and beckoned Cas over. Sliding over and leaning against the wall so there was room for Cas to sit.
“You have at least kissed somebody before!” I hissed, blushing as a girl in front of me gave me an amused and pitying look in one long look.
“Not since yesterday…” Castiel laughed, bouncing the blonde on his lap.
“Yes!”
“No, but there is someone I’d like to marry,” Dean beamed, pulling the ring box out of his pocket, “but it isn’t a woman.”
“Sam,” John warned, “if you’re really this Castiel how come I’ve never seen you?”
“Sure, come on Lil Cas, let’s give these losers some space,” Dean shrugged; grabbing his car keys, “wear a condom!” he called out as he walked out the door to his car.
“One more kiss?” Dean asked, biting his lips.
“I-I had to help set the fair up,” I admitted, the redness in my cheeks enhancing as Dean’s hand appeared and cupped my face.
“Okay” Claire agreed.
He got more than kisses that night.
“What the fuck Cas? Where did you learn to kiss like that?” Dean panted, looking up into Cas’ eyes.
“Yeah,” Claire mumbled, “my parents died when I was young, I don’t remember them very well.”
“I have two brothers…” Dean pointed out, looking at Castiel who merely shrugged and told him to grab them both.
“Get a room!” I told them, licking my lips to remove any trace of the tuna from them.
Snap. snap. snap.
“Oh dear lord I’m going to be kissing Dean Winchester,” I realized, getting a worried look from Charlie as I visibly paled, my heart clenching again.
Dean left for collage after that, but every week when he came home he would spend the night talking to Castiel, and if anyone asked him who he was talking to he lied and said he was talking to Benny who had gone to a different university. Castiel wasn’t aware he was falling in love with Dean until Dean came home from University on the night of his twenty first birthday. Dean had grinned at him over Sam’s shoulder when he got home and it made Castiel feel like he was human again. He could have sworn he could felt his heart beat faster, except his heart hadn’t beat in a long time. So when Dean came into the bedroom to go to bed, and Castiel was sitting on the bed, Castiel didn’t know what to say.
“Why would Benny ever quit! We’re friends!” Dean asked, getting a stern look from the ghost, “sorry continue.”
The Angel on Top of the Tree
“Come in in a few days’ time, I believe there’s one that’s nearly finished…” the man smiled at Castiel. His eyes looking over Castiel, as though committing his features to memory.
“Please, let’s just eat,” Dean said, looking away from me. Frustrated, I grabbed his face and forced him to look at me, as if he wasn’t telling me.
“My pleasure.” Castiel growled happily, kissing Dean.
“D-Death?” Dean gulped, before laughing weakly, “I think I’ll stick to ghost of Christmas yet to come,” he added, getting only another nod in response. Dean scrambled off of the couch, his skin prickling under the gaze of the man, but not in the way that Crowley had made his skin prickle, no this feeling was much more grave feeling to it. When Dean was standing he looked to the man for direction, but rather than leading him through a door, this one merely lifted his cane and connected it back to the floor with a snap and the world began to spin around Dean and suddenly he was outside the Soup Kitchen he had seen full and bursting with life just a few hours ago.
“It’s okay, most mothers are,” Castiel grinned, looking at the watch and frowning, “I have to go over to the stage thing to get ready for the carols.”
“I’m okay with it, as long as when you flee the city, take Adam… he’s only ten... he needs to be protected,” Sam told the twins, blushing under Gabriel’s intense gaze.
“Let’s get you some food little guy,” Dean smiled, picking me up and carrying me downstairs and placing me on the table. “We don’t have any cat food… we do have some tuna though… that’s safe for cats to eat right…?” I sat down and watched a very confused Dean shuffle through the kitchen before picking up the phone and calling someone. “Mum… are you bringing cat food… yeah he did… I’m naming it Castiel… no… mum I’m not in love with Cas… what do you mean missing… I’m sure he’s fine… I know… if he’s still missing tomorrow I’ll look in our old secret places, tell Michael that… I love you too… calm down… mum I'm hanging up now.”
“Can you play piano?” she asked, still attempting to appear seductive.
“What?” Castiel felt himself ask, not entirely sure what the question was as he stared into Deans eyes.
“Idiot,” Dean whispered, moving my face so I was looking at him and kissing me.
“How do you know?”
“Morning princess,” he quipped.
“According to a very amused Gabriel you were attempting to climb the drainage pipe and kept falling, Gabriel also mentioned offering to let you in.” Dean turned beet red, a vague, blurry image of Gabriel at the kitchen window appearing in his mind.
He’s punishing me for my rebellion.
“I told you he had a boyfriend!” Sam grinned, coming into the kitchen and stealing one of the piping hot pancakes.
“W-well Bela Talbot had a reddish-purple mark on her neck and Balthazar wouldn’t give me an answer…” Cas quietly admitted. Reddish-purple mark? Bela Talbot? Oh… Dean couldn’t hold in his laughter.
“Tonight, for the next three hours,” John began, his voice solemn and condemning.
“Please,” Dean managed to choke out, making the man climb onto the bed and pull the sobbing young man into a hug.
Castiel had told Dean he was the youngest of ten, with two adopted sidings who were both actually younger then him and that he grew up in Topeka. In order of age there was the twins; Michael and Lucifer. Then Hannah, Naomi, James or Jimmy as they called him, who was also Claire’s father and yes he was too young to be a father but he was a good one none the less, Gadreel, Balthazar, Samandriel, then he and Gabriel were twins but he was twenty minutes younger. His mother had died during child birth, but his father Charles was a published author and could provide for all of his kids who were all a year apart each. Then when Castiel and Gabriel were ten his father adopted their cousins Anna and Bartholomew. Anna was only three and Bart was five, and their parents had died in a car crash not long before they came to live with them. Castiel also told him that he had excelled in school, but would rather be doing anything else then doing his current job which was as an office worker.
“Why am I a cat!” I cried, sitting down roughly. Rubbing my eyes with my paws as tears began to build up. “I want to be human. I want to hold Dean when he holds me! I want him to love me. In every sense of the word.” I practically howled.
Fuck.
Just block out the sound. The contract only lasts ten years. If I don’t die first.
“We can move on, go to the next plane of existence or we can watch over your brother until he dies of hopefully old age,” Castiel explained, taking Dean’s hand.
“How come she gets the Winchester original doll, you’re not her legal guardian!” Claire pouted, looking a little more than jealous.
“Dean?” his version of Gabriel asked, squatting down in front of him, “time’s up we have to go,” he told Dean, looking disappointed and tired.
“Dean, I am a virgin,” Cas stated, his voice breathless, “But there’s nobody I’d rather lose it to then you.” He admitted before Dean could pull away.
“Please don’t hate me, if you want you can reject me and I will pay for you and Sam to go stay at a motel for the night,” Cas nervously spoke, his words speeding up with every other word but before he could continue Dean – the younger – kissed him.
“Benny, don’t, I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Some decisions, by nature, are exceedingly dumb. And at the ripe old age of twenty-one, Dean Winchester had made more dumb decisions than he would care to admit, but on the 19
“Daddy!” she screamed loudly, tackling me and licking my face.
“Oh you’re only a year older than me… I was scared you would be a lot older or something…” Dean blushed, not able to stop the nervous words spilling out.
“You’re my guardian angel… minus the feathers,” Dean grinned. Castiel ‘slept’ in Dean’s bed that night. It was the first night in over a hundred years he actually slept.
Snap. snap. snap.
I bites his lip for a moment in thought. I stare at the flesh between his teeth. I want to kiss him.
“I would not!”
His scream of pure pain seemed to be the thing to bring the man to his senses as he suddenly pulled out and released Dean, backing away from him in what Dean would later realize was shame and terror. “MEG!” the man boomed, and Dean shrunk away from him in terror, the door opened and the woman from before came in laughing her arse off.
We’re forced to kiss. She tastes like cigarettes.
“You’re my muse Cas,” Dean admitted, “ever since I met you.”
But that was because they were. “Cas,” Dean mumbled sadly, looking at the young pair, one being him in his nineteenth year and the other being the first and only person he really fell in love with. Castiel Novak was handsome from every angle you viewed him from. He had surreal, blue eyes that could not be compared to anything else on Earth in Dean’s opinion, at least not without downplaying their beauty. And his hair was generally messy, due to Cas’ absentmindedness, but Dean thought that was just part of his charm. “Dean?” Cas’s voice was deep and rough, sending chills down Dean’s spine, and if he hazarded a guess it was sending chills down the spine of his former self.
Dean breathes heavily as I am told to spread my legs and continue my seductive look. What is this even for? A porn magazine?
“Where are we?” he asked quietly, shivering slightly at the brisk air as he looked at Crowley who was leaning on a black umbrella with a curved handle.
But it seems I have no choice.
“Why would he think that? Is he not aware that I am married with a son?” Crowley asked just as Sam and Gabe entered the room, both making gagging noises at the scene in front of them.
“Dean why do you have to date a dick like him!” I cried, knowing Dean couldn’t understand me.
“But you’re also one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and I get my Christmas wish coming true every second I spend with you.”
One year passes.
“Okay what about friends?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrow, “oh wait! I forgot you push everyone away because you’re a total Grinch.”
“My fiancé and son.” Dean whispered, looking in the eyes of the man that he knew he had fallen in love with, whether he was honest with himself or not.
“You can go inside, I think you have just woken up and so your family should be up soon too,” Crowley advised, “just walk through the door, you’re a ghost it won’t matter.” Dean looked at the door sceptically before squeezing his eyes shut and stepping to the door, when there was a lack of impact he found himself inside what he remembered as his home. There was a warmth to the air he remembered clearly, the scent of sugar cookies and eggnog.
“All I know is the last owner of this house was a woman named Anna,” John told his wife, “and that she passed away twenty years ago, leaving no surviving children.”
“I do but I would rather it was after a date or something a little more romantic!” I complained, not even noticing as we moved closer to Dean who watched the line with an indecipherable look.
“Ward of the state I’m afraid,” Gabriel explained, giving up on his endeavour to acquire some of the steaming goo, “keeps running away from her foster homes.”
When it finally stopped he found himself sitting on his lounge room floor, his back against a wall. But this time he was not alone. “Do you understand Dean?” Death asked his voice slightly rougher than it had been.
“Well maybe I’ll hold you instead,” Benny smirked, drawing Dean closer and kissing him. Making me gag. Ewe!
“My apologies Dean, I’ll be out of your hair in a moment,” Cas said, voices sounding outside the bunker, making Cas’ face to go white.
Dean himself would not get home until a little after midnight, and it wasn’t much of a home. It was constantly cold and dark, a mere place to go to sleep and nothing more – despite the many rooms. He ate a plain slice of bread in his mostly unused kitchen before waddling up to his bedroom. Inside his own room was not much brighter or warmer than the rest of the house. Dean stripped out of his suit, stretching out any kinks in his muscles before putting on a pair of sweat pants and climbing into his plush bed.
“I was hoping you had a red headed doll, it’s for my baby sister,” Castiel replied, going closer to the counter where the shop boy was. “Do you know if there’s one I could have?”
“Hi Chesh,” I smiled at the dark grey tabby kitten. She was only a few months old, but right now seemed to be the same size as me.
“I’ll give you one for free if you agree to a date,” Dean blurted out, slapping his hand over his mouth, “I didn’t mean to say that out loud.”
“Why not we do it all the time?” I joked, winking at him.
“I-I belong to you,” Dean whispered, his heart clenching as Castiel smirked and began to fill the boy’s butt. Dropping his head onto Castiel’s shoulder, Dean tried to clear his head of the lust that was filling him up along with Castiel’s cock.
Every day it’s the same.
“Yeah Cas is helping me,” Dean told his father who made a face before sighing.
“My brothers want to shove a stick up my arse to punish me for being gay…” Cas admitted, now almost crying. Dean didn’t know what he was doing by the time he had Cas pressed up against the wall of the bunker, his prick rubbing against Cas’ leg as he pinned the bawling boy against the wall. “If you’re going to punch me do it quickly, don’t say anything, at least in respect for the friendship we held once.” Cas began to blubber, only for Dean to shut him up with a kiss. Cas responded quickly, letting his hand trail down to Dean’s surprisingly still hard meat. Dean moaned into the kiss as he removed Cas’ shirt and began to work on his pants. Dean began to drag them over to the table so he could fuck the seemingly enthusiastic boy when he stopped and looked at Cas.
"I-I" I mumbled as soon as he pulled away.
“They split up and it was your fault,” the spirit told Dean, “you poisoned your brother’s relationship.”
“Guys! They’re saying Queen Mary is coming to get her sons back and join our side!” Charlie said, bouncing happily.
“Are you going to fuck me?” Dean asked expectantly.
“Sammy! Can cats eat people tuna?”
“Yes?”
“Is it that obvious?” Dean asked at the same time as Cas asking, “I don’t think I ever won’t be,” making Dean realise this was in fact the real Gabriel.
“I am Cas!” I tried to tell him.
“Cas!” Dean laughed, rubbing his forehead, “shit that hurt!”
“Yes Cassy, you missed dinner,” Gabriel teased, ushering him towards the room of people. Dean watched him smile and hug everyone, licking his lips in the cutest way to try and return moisture to them.
“C-Cas,” Dean begged as Castiel moved his hands away, and setting Dean on his hands and knees.
“Dean go with your mother,” Castiel encouraged, “I won’t let anything happen to Sam.” Dean nodded and got up to after his mother. Thankfully he didn’t hear what his grandfather said to his wife as he left.
Dean woke me up the next morning when he got out of bed. He probably had work to get to. Meowing at him I signified the fact that I was awake and hungry. He took me with him as he ran downstairs, filling up the little bowl Mary got me and pulling out his slice of pie, which he happily devoured. He kissed his mother when she came into the kitchen before breezing out and off to work. Mary watched me eat as she herself ate some cereal, kissing Sam as he bustled in, late for school and being called for by Gabe who I assumed must have stayed the night. And John as he came in for a kiss before heading off to work as well. Mary then went and did her daily chores, not realizing that I escaped out the window to go lay in a warm patch of sun on top of Riot’s kennel. Riot was Sam’s well trained dog. I doubted he would attack me. And if he did I’d just jump onto the fence and get back in through the front. Riot watched me whilst I watched the giant ball of fluff. “If cats can understand me can you?” I asked, tilting my head at the dog.
“B-but you were imaginary…”
Castiel told himself,
“I-is that a problem?” I whispered, watching his hands as they began to assemble the sandwiches.
“My name is Castiel Novak and I died in 1870,” Castiel told them quietly, “my father was a merchant, my mother the daughter of a lawyer, my sister was the last owner of the house and I have been watching over your sons since they were born.”
“They’re idiots, but if they’re anything like us they’ll realize their feelings are mutual eventually, probably sooner considering Sammy is a nerd,” he promised, kissing me.
“I’m so sorry Dean,” Castiel soothed, running his hands up and down Dean’s back.
“Sorry Lil Cas, Sammy said aunty Ellen was brought pie,” Dean laughed, picking me up and placing me on his shoulder where I stayed until we walked through the door and got bombarded with questions.
Dean groaned loudly and leant back, cursing at the work. So Castiel, still invisible, snuck up behind the freckled male to whisper in his ear, “get some sleep Dean, staying awake all night won’t help.” He told Dean who whipped his head around to see who was there. Castiel laughed at Dean who huffed out a laugh.
“Yeah? Sure! Why not!”
“Shit, I forgot gay didn’t always mean what I know it as… you’re a homosexual… am I right?” Dean asked his face slightly red. Castiel couldn’t speak, so he only nodded, looking down at the bedsheets. He was suddenly thankful that he couldn’t cry, because he would probably have tears streaming down his face. “You’re not an abomination Cas.”
“Yeah her name is Gabriel,” Dean muttered, smirking hotly. Standing up on his stomach, I stretched before walking over to his face and licking his nose, trying to tell him I’m hungry.
“He lives on the streets now,” the ghost told Dean, making Dean feel sick to his stomach, and to make matters worse he remembered the poor little orphan girl.
“Okay… what about?” she asked, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear shyly.
“You never approved of your brother’s choice in partner, always preferring… what was her name, Jess?”
“I lost count, I was over one hundred before you were born though, and that’s excluding years when I was alive,” Castiel admitted.
“Cassy, I will be back momentarily, go get dressed,” Crowley tells me before they walk off, I walk with the makeup and wardrobe girls, and they help me into a regular appearance once more.
“Christ how old are you?” Dean laughed uneasily.
“Jackarse,” Cas laughed, “I like you okay? And not as in like as a friend but as in -”
“An angel? Why would an angel want to be friends with a snot nosed kid like you?” Bobby teased, making Dean puff out his cheeks, Castiel hopped off the piano and sat next to Dean.
“Be serious,” I say, brushing aside my feelings. What would he want from a dumb model anyway.
“You wouldn’t understand Gabe,” Cas told him, “please drop it, I don’t want to think about him on Christmas.”
"And I know you’re probably tired of modelling, but I was wondering if you’d model privately for me, and now that I’m asking it seems like a terrible idea… s-sorry…”
“Well this started at a depressing note,” Gabriel mused, watching Dean as he placed the large box back where it had come from, his hand resting on it a moment before he drew it back to his body.
He then proceeded to close the door and remove his clothes, shedding down until he was in the buff and then climbed into bed with me. I immediately curled up on the pillow next to him on his king sized bed. Blushing at the fact that if I woke up human we would both be naked… in the same bed. I let those images lull me to sleep…
“And miss the chance to see you?” Dean laughed, biting his lip, “sorry that came out wrong, I did want to see you, but to apologise… for hurting you…”
“I wish I could fix things my pet,” Cas told Dean, bending over and kissing his lover’s lips, “however my brother has requested my presence, so I must leave you alone with your hand until I return tonight.” Cas smirked, nipping Dean’s lips.
“But you know I'm a whore when it comes to your cock,” Dean breathed, lifting himself up to fuck himself with Castiel’s cock, only to have Castiel thrust in at full force as he dropped himself down, making the impact on his prostate strong enough to make him cry out.
“You can just call me Cas,” Castiel told the little boy, remembering the nickname Anna used to call him.
“Well you’ve definitely grown at least a foot! Your old man would be proud!” Benny told the blushing boy before looking up at Castiel and walking over to him, holding out his hand to shake the other man’s hand. “Nice to see you Castiel, what’s it been… ten years?”
“Without me?” Gabriel’s voice drifted into their eyes ears, making Castiel jump… in a manly way. He hoped.
“I’m secretly an international spy and it would blow my cover as a giant dork?” he jokes, his eyes dipping to what only I would assume was my lips.
“Speaking of your brother, Michael called my mum and told her that Cas was missing…”
This story starts on the twenty fourth of December, Christmas Eve and Dean’s restaurant was full of people with a lot of money to spend, he sat in his office doing his usual work as the smells from the various platters, the only sound being the clunks of dishes and cutlery as people enjoyed their meals.
“How rude, how about you ask Cas, he should be ready!” Castiel chose this moment to leave his room.
“Sam go pack a saddle bag! Only essentials or things you can’t live without! And get Adam to too!” Dean practically yelled making the younger, but taller, Winchester hold his hands up and leave the room.
“Did that just become a fetish for you?” I laughed, yelping as he snapped his hips up.
“Oh right dinner!” Mary gasped ushering the other adults into the dining room.
“Crowley?” Dean asked, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, suddenly very conscious of his shirtless body. The man had often made passes at him when Dean had worked for him, but Dean just assumed it was Crowley trying to make him uncomfortable.
“You would not! I’m still a king you know!” Dean huffed.
“Yes, I actually have to close up now, but if you give me your number I can call you when the doll is done,” Dean smirked, pulling out a note book and pen from under the counter. After jotting his number in his overly beautiful writing, Castiel bid his farewell to the green eyed man, heading home.
“Hey Cas,” he smiled, bending over to pick up Cas’ bags.
I hissed slightly as he pushed in, stretching me more than his fingers could have prepared me for. “God Cas, please don’t tell me you were a virgin,” Dean laughed, grabbing my hand with his now free hand.
This time when the spinning world came to a halt, Dean was surprised to find himself outside of his and Benny’s restaurant. Only it was open and filled with people. “This place seems busy,” Dean gasped, “I guess firing Benny was a good move?”
“Because you’re mine and he didn’t ask for permission to look at my stuff,” Castiel explained as he scraped his nails down the boy’s hip bones earning another gasp from the touch of the older man.
Dean was beginning to freak out when a woman in a white and blue gown, similar to the ones he found in his home walked up to him through the crowd of women in bras and panties with the mysterious thin fabric attached to have some level of modesty. “Dean Winchester, come with me,” the woman told him, grabbing him by the wrist and dragging him through the doors of that room. She was mumbling something to herself that Dean was unable to catch anything but ‘incompetent’, ‘personal’ and ‘fuck’ from. The woman was shorter than the teenager, he was just over six foot, and had a bit more growing to do, but this woman was clearly past her growth time, being mid to late twenties at least. She had curly reddish-brown hair that fell to her shoulders and her skin was freckled from the sun.
