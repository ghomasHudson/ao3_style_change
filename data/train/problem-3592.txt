“Like when Kia could see into the bad place, yes,” Jack added. He shivered slightly at the memory.
Warm water was falling over Dean’s head and back, wrapping him in a comfort he didn’t quite feel. It helped, though. Sam had told him he had to shower and eat, and then they could visit Rowena in Hell. So Dean was showering. Dean turned and opened his eyes, spotting Cas’ shampoo. Before he could think about what he was doing, he was lathering the smell of sandalwood and home into his hair. The familiar scent comforting him. It smelled like all those times he had stood a little closer to Cas, or Dean had sat next to him talking for hours on end. Now that he thought about it, it really had been obvious. Completely blindingly obvious how much Cas loved him, and more still, how desperately Dean loved him back. He was still showering, basking in pleasant memories, when he heard Sam Calling.
Cas replies, his voice cracking slightly, “I’m sure Sam knows, whatever you said…what you did…wasn’t you. It certainly wasn’t all you.”
Dean seemed to steel himself slightly “I’ve been thinking about the spell to summon Freyja….What the…..” Dean startled as a cotton napkin rubbed against his eye from behind. Jack had wiped something from his face.
A-honey you need-ah
Jack dropped the napkin into a Ziplock baggie with a smug smile on his face. He looked sidelong as Sam responded “I’ve been thinking about the spell too. Don’t look so surprised Dean, Sam told me everything last night.” Jack held up the baggie with some pride. “I just got us the first ingredient.”
“What did I miss, Sam?” she asked pointedly.
"Because it is" Cas looked so genuine and vulnerable, but yet so powerful.
Jack was back in no time with three warm mugs of coffee. Sam didn't care for coffee much, preferring tea usually, but Dean needed coffee. Dean sat in silence for a long time; the warm liquid was grounding him, and the caffeine clearing his head. Slowly, he calmed until he was able to speak and form words. No one rushed him. Sam and jack just sat with him, waiting.
The hall was wide and large, and there were Daemons on all sides. Sam and Dean were standing together, angle blades at their sides just in case. Rowena may be their friend, but that didn’t mean her Deamon’s wouldn’t have a little fun before handing them over.
"We will get him back, Dean" Sam's voice was strong and reassuring. "We will figure this out, even if we have to rip through worlds to do it."
I have another chapter ready. It's starting to take shape now. Thank you for reading, and as always, I appreciate any comments or constructive criticism you have.
But Dean is dying and he knows it.
But this isn't Crowley's concern. He stands and steps closer to Alastair. "Tell me," he says slowly, "you're certain it was an angel."
The angel nods.
An angel stands behind her.
"What? What does he have to do with this?"
“You know,” Sam says, his voice slightly strained, “watching what happened back there—I’m kind of surprised you survived a year hunting on your own.”
As usual, now that his brother and sister-in-law have driven away, he wishes he had said what he’d meant.
"Fine. You have your motorcycle, I have my suits."
“You bet he is.” Turner sees Jack and raises his eyebrows. “Hold up, the probie’s on our shift?”
They heave the body into the trunk with a grunt. “Sorta seemed like you needed me.”
Of all the people to not hit on a motorcycle, she wasn't the worst.
Crowley narrows his eyes.
Sam sighs and pulls out a chair from the dining table to sit down. "I'm not going to try to stop you," he says. He sounds more defeated than he'd like to. "I just wish—I wish we could've actually known each other, you know?"
Cas cracks a smile and leans over to give Dean a brief kiss.
“They’re just from the garden,” Cas says. “I didn’t buy them or anything. Was this a mistake? I feel like I’m missing something.”
“I know, but aren’t you a
“I’m about two and half hours out—hell, I can make it two. Why are you in New Mexico, Sam? How did demons find you?”
Eventually, Rufus calls the hospital, and they receive permission to call time of death.
“Okay, okay,” it says in a rush, struggling against the ropes tying it to the chair. Dean pulls the stake out of its leg. “There’s one demon, he runs all the crossroads deals now that Lilith is moving up the food chain. He’s worked with Lilith before, but since she got serious about the sixty-six seals, they—I guess they had a falling out. He probably knows her plans, whether your brother is involved or not, and he might be willing to talk.”
Cas inhales and looks away, thinking. "Mostly I know about how they died. Do you…still want to hear that?"
"I—they don't—they don't mind that I helped Dean while he was still a demon? Or…anything else?"
"Yep. Continue."
“This is real, Dean.” Cas’s eyes are black in the darkness. “You and I are real. Six months from now… I don’t know. It’s such a short time, normally I wouldn’t spare it a thought. But I suppose to you, it could feel much longer.”
"Don't kill anything. And…I have a name."
Its demonic face flickers underneath the human one, then it goes limp. Dean sighs and looks at the name tag the demon’s waiter vessel had been wearing.
For a second, Crowley thinks he means Juliet, but then he realizes: he's talking about Dean. Of course. Alastair had loathed Dean from the minute he got there and had first tried to kill him when the boy was only thirteen. His hatred had only increased once Dean became Crowley's second. He'd tried to kill him after the first year, at which point, Crowley had banished him.
Cas doesn't respond and Dean opens his eyes. The angel is just looking at him with a slightly apologetic frown.
That's all he needs. Later, he will send demons out to find out more about a family by the name of Winchester. He'll need to know everything.
Then two demons enter, holding a third between them. It takes Crowley just a moment to recognize the intruder, who holds his head high and has a smirk on his face.
She nods, a little frantic. Jack has found his way back to the bedroom and is setting the jump bag on the floor, unzipping it and pulling out the pulse oximeter and the blood pressure cuff.
He shoves the window open and slashes a hole in the screen with his knife. “Come on,” he says, lifting Tasha out and setting her down outside. “Go out front and find your brother. You’re gonna be okay, I promise, just go.”
"When did I—oh. I…I lied. I didn't want to get caught up in a conversation about it, so I just said I went unconscious immediately."
His phone buzzes. He pulls it out—the screen seems glaringly bright in the darkness of late evening—and sees it's Dean. Of course. Who else would know this number?
Dean stays quiet, scrubbing away a stray tear.
“I’m getting better,” he says defensively. “I just have to keep working on it. If I hadn’t wasted time trying to ignore it while I was hunting with you, I might be able to kill Lilith already.”
“Now, normally,” Jody says to Jack, “Garth and the gal you’re replacing run on the ambulance, but she was an advanced EMT and you’re not, which makes Dean the senior medical provider until Garth gets his certification finished. So, Dean, Jack, you two will be on the ambulance and Garth will take firefighter duty.”
"Dean, don't…" he starts to say, or he thinks he says, and then everything goes black.
"You can't ask me to—"
"Come on, that's not realist—"
He sighs and sits up, pushing the blanket off entirely and shivering once as the air sweeps over his skin. He gets up, pours himself a couple fingers of whiskey, then starts building a fire over the ashes of the one from the night before.
"What—what did you—?"
Dean gasps for breath and curls into a fetal position around his pain. His chest feels as though it's collapsing and the side of his leg burns where it must have gotten caught on the motorcycle. His mouth is filling with blood from the inside of his cheek. The warm, suffocating liquid chokes him as he tries to regain his breath.
Cas nods. "I believe you." The wariness in his expression fades.
Cas turns to Dean. "Was your blade poisoned?"
He doesn't have to.
She eyes him. "More or less, yeah. You?"
"Of course," Dean says immediately. "Come on, I'm not gonna go spend a day with my boyfriend without giving my brother some time too."
“Hey.”
"Don't you dare tell me he's still a demon. He's not. I've seen him, I've talked to him—"
Dean raises his eyebrows, but says nothing.
Dean's face is covered in blood from his nose to his chin and as Cas watches, he starts to cough again. The first sends a spattering of blood onto the floor before he makes it back over to the sink. His cough soon turns to retching, his whole body convulsing as he loses blood down the drain.
“I don’t care about any of that stuff anymore, Dean.”
"I had a very distinct idea of how I wanted to be," Dean says, still not turning around, which Cas finds odd. "I got most of these to say who I was for me, because I felt like I wasn't meeting my own expectations. I don't regret getting them, but I sure as hell don't need them to show what kind of…person…I am."
Crowley's eyebrows further their skepticism, but he doesn't say anything.
Cas has Dean's head in his hand from where he caught him as he fell back toward the rock. Cas is now kneeling, bent over Dean with his other arm wrapped around Dean's back, half holding him.
Then, wingbeats.
"You two together?" Sam asks, looking between them.
Cas seems to intuit that this goes beyond the fire department. He sighs and leans his forearms on the table, folding his hands. “You know, Jack, that’s a question I’ve been trying to answer my entire life.” He looks toward the kitchen, then around the coffee shop. “I think it’s the little things. You have to find things to hold onto to get you through. For me, lately, it’s making espresso. It’s my garden. It’s flying a rainbow flag outside our house.”
Dean shrugs. "Needle and ink. And a hell of a lot of patience."
Probie: probationary firefighter. Someone in their first year with the department. The one who gets stuck doing the dishes, mopping the floors, and washing the ambulance.
Light flashed in her eyes, wicked and cold as she raised a hand and grasped at the space in front of her. Castiel fell to the ground screaming and writhing in pain. “You and your friends made it loud” She closed her hand again prompting fresh shrieks of agony from Castiel. His body contorting at the women’s will.
“It’s the Winchesters,” another demon hissed at her, “you know the orders.”
Want to whole lotta love
“I know how Dean feels about my Dad; heck, I’ve known for some time now that he thinks of himself as my Dad too. Dean won’t admit it, but it’s true.” Jack looked at Sam before they fell into a comfortable silence. They had to keep trying. And they would.
Sam leaned forward slightly. “So kind of like the dream walkers, who could see into other worlds through their bond with the dream walker in the other world?”
“Well yeah, Dean” Sam was confused by Dean’s evident delight. “We don’t have any of Cas’s blood, and we can’t get to him. That’s kind of the whole problem.”
Cas was so happy to see Dean, he smiled and reached out, but couldn’t touch him, his hand passed straight through. Something was off, not quite right. Outside on the streets, there was no one, shops were empty, streets empty of people, their cars left abandoned as if everyone had just vanished. This wasn’t a memory at all; it was something different. The scene around him started to shift and darken.
“What did you do?” Sam asked, surprised, releasing Dean and pacing.
Dean cleared his throat, pushing his jacket behind him. “Yeah, Sam. I’m just peachy” He shifted slightly, trying to hide his tears. “How is the research going?”
It was happening; he realized too late that his legs were giving out and fell unceremoniously to his knees. Dean couldn’t do this, couldn’t face this, couldn’t live without his angel.
Dean awoke screaming, pleading, calling for Cas. He was covered in sweat, vaguely aware of people rushing in around him.
"Dean, can I come in?" Sam rested his arm against the doorframe of Dean's closed door. "Dean, you haven't eaten all day, come, let's get some food."
“Dean, this is hardly the time to be drinking!” Sam seemed adamant and stern. Dean didn’t like it one bit. He was so confused, he couldn’t process all this. Soul bonds, no soul bonds, great new cosmic entities…It was all just too much.
“Come on Dean, we're about to find out, aren’t we? If the spell works, Freyja will come and we will know you are Soul bound to Cas. If it doesn’t work we can storm back into Rowena’s throne room in Hell and demand some answers.” Sam practically rolled his eyes at Dean.
“How are you, Dean?” Jack’s voice was calm and kind, but tense. Jack was eying Dean closely, as though assessing if the trip to Hell had damaged him.
“What if it is Love dean? The Love. What if you and Cas, if you have always been meant for one another if your love is more than a normal love? What if this is the Love, the soul bond gifted to the world by Freyja.” Sam was looking more and more convinced.
In the beginning, there were three truths; nothingness, Death and Love. Each truth was eternal and embodied by a cosmic entity. Nothingness became known as the Shadow or the Empty and was a vast being that was the eternal home where all fallen cosmic beings slept for eternity. Death was the end promised to all that was created and was tasked to collect the cosmic beings and deliver them to the empty. All that is must end, eventually. Love was the essence of life itself, a powerful force that provided purpose to all things. There is no true life without Love. Over the millennia, Love became known by many names, but Freyja was her favourite. Love and Death wished to create balance in the universe, and together they created light and dark creation and destruction. These became known as god and the darkness, and as Chuck and Amara.
“It’s been a long day Jack” Sam explained looking over again. “Let’s grab some food and I’ll explain. It’s worse than we thought, but we may have a shot at getting Cas back”
“And don’t harm them,” the male daemon added.
They entered the throne room where Rowena was sitting, poised, waiting for them. Her red hair curled about her face, which was set into a stern yet alluring smirk. She turned to them, bright red dress hugging her curves and flowing out at the bottom. She always was elegant.
“Probably Cas. It always seems to be Cas these days, though more often than not, it’s a nightmare”. As if on cue, Dean started screaming for Cas, violently twitching as if trying to run in his sleep.
A tear escaped his eyes, but he just nodded. Rowena started pacing. “How much do you love him, Dean?” Her face was intent with concentration.
The brunet daemon rolled her eyes dramatically, “I know, all the people on earth disappeared, so when the Winchesters come, bring them straight to me” she mocked Rowena’s straight posture and elegant voice.
Jack looked up and shook his head. “Some interesting things on how to invoke a celestial bond, not that we need that, some other stuff on the properties of celestial bonds, and soul-bonding rituals, but nothing that would help us with the spell.” Jack shrugged. “I know it wasn’t one of the books we picked out originally, but I saw it there and thought it couldn’t hurt to know more about what this…true love soul bond might entail.”
“Yes, Dean, you are.” It was Rowena who spoke this time. “When Castiel first met you, you were torturing Souls in Hell. He flew in and grabbed you by your soul, rebuilt your body and raised you from perdition.” She paused for a moment to let that sink in. “He has seen you torture, and Kill, he has seen you bear the mark of Kain and murder endlessly, he saw you gallivanting with my Fergus as a daemon, and yet, he still loves you” Rowena paused, looking closely at Dean “What is in your pocket?"
"It feels different this time. I know I brought Cass back from the empty once, but I don't think that will work again," Jack says pensively. It's late, and they are both exhausted. "Do you think Cas used his deal with the Empty to save dean?"
"Not on Earth, Dean…" Sam's voice was full of concern, "But Jack thinks there are souls still elsewhere." Sam paused, unsure how much he should assume, how much Dean could handle. "We will get them back, Dean… All of them." With that, Sam turned and walked back to the kitchen.
He hadn't said it back. Cass didn't know, didn't think… He hadn't said it back, and now Cass had died thinking the closest he could get to happiness was just telling Dean how he felt. I love you. Cas would never know how wrong he was.
“But, Cas is an angel.”
Whole lotta love
Jack smiled softly as he looked at Sam and asked again “What happened with Rowena?”.
Dean smiled slightly. “You always were the smart one, Sammy.” He sighed, grabbing the top book and looking at the cover. “Well, these books won’t read themselves” Dean looked up, cleared his throat, sat at the table and began to read. Sam and Jack followed suit.
“Penny for your thoughts Dean?” Sam asked teasingly, a small smile on his face.
Rowena did seem to understand, and her face turned pensive. She turned and moved toward Dean, kneeling before him. She reached out a hand to lift his chin and looked into his eyes. They had gone flat, no spark left in them. Keeping his face steady in her hand, she watched closely as she asked, “Do you love him too?”
It seemed to work somewhat because Dean just let out a huff and turned to leave, grabbing the bottle of whiskey and ruffling Jack's hair as he passed. “You’re a good kid Jack, I’ll tell you all about it in the morning ok? Right now I need to drink until my brain stops processing how much I miss your dad ok?” With that Dean left taking another swig as he went.
“What the hell does that mean?” Dean asked, not unkindly.
Dean looked at the floor and then told them everything he could remember. The memory that was like a dream, the empty, her torturing Cas, him running to reach Cas but unable to reach him. After he was finished, they all sat in silence for a moment, contemplating the situation. After a moment, Jack started flipping through the book on celestial bonds, making small contemplative sounds as he read. “Hmm yes…” Jack mumbled at last. “It says here that when two souls are bound, the bond acts as a sort of subconscious thread connecting the two people. People who are bound can sense the other’s emotions and may experience a phantom of their experience” Jack paused for a moment, looking up from the book.
"Did he say what happened?"
As Sam approached Dean’s room, he could see the light on in Cas,’ and someone was speaking. Dean was praying, praying to Cas. Sam’s heart broke for Dean. When Sam was sure Dean was finished, he knocked gently on the door. “Hey Dean…How are you doing?”
Sam looked interested and was about to speak when Dean started to mumble more clearly in his sleep.
“Somehow, I think you know the answer to that one” Castiel looked at the women lounging on her throne, surrounded by nothingness. “You don’t seem to be sleeping well”
Sam pulled up a chair next to the bed and sat across from Dean. “Well… Jack and I figured out what the spell ingredients are… but…We are pretty sure one of them will be impossible to obtain.” Dean put his head in his hands as Sam continued. “The tears are gold and amber, so that is easy… but the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep… Dean, there is no one left on earth, and Jack is pretty sure that of all of us, the only one who satisfies all the requirements is Cas.” Sam let that hang in the air between them before continuing. “Jack can try to get into the empty long enough to get a bit of blood from Cas, but there is no guarantee it would work, and in any event, it would use too much power. Chuck would notice…I’m sorry, Dean.”
It was Cas, the same Cas as always looking at him from the doorway. “You look terrible,” Cas says, sighing as he enters, looking Dean up and down. Dean was lounging on his bed, hoping he didn’t look as awful as he felt. “You know, it wouldn’t kill you to lie now and again,” Dean responds, avoiding eye contact with his Angel. With his demon-self gone, all his feelings of love and self-loathing were returning. He wasn’t sure when he started loving his Angel like this, but one thing was certain. Cas couldn’t possibly feel the same way, so no-one could know.
“Yeah” was all Sam could manage.
“It’s not important” Dean deflected. “Let's go see our Hell Queen.”
“It means that when two people are bound, they can sense the other's experiences. Like a tug of a thread under their ribcage pulling them to the other, or like, feeling their pain if they are hurt, or joy if they’re happy. It’s like their subconscious minds are connected.” Jack was smiling confidently at Dean as he tapped the book lightly with his index finger. “It says here that in some cases, bound souls can share dreams.”
Dean was screaming, screaming as loud as he could for Cas, telling him we were coming, that it wasn’t all a lie. His throat hurt, but Cas couldn’t hear him, couldn’t see him. Suddenly he was aware of strong hands on his shoulders, shaking him and pulling him back to reality.
The lyrics are a verse from Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love".
It sounds cheesy in his head and twice he's scoffed at himself and picked up a knife so he could go kill someone, but both times he stopped. Something, and he's not even entirely sure what, has kept him clean. Is it that conscience Castiel seemed so certain he has? What does a conscience feel like, exactly?
Dean, who has finally wrestled into his wet jeans, sits beside his angel. "Cas."
From the outside, she barely looks injured—a broken leg and a bit of blood from her temple, but that’s it—but the internal damage is the killer. Dean is the first to point out the worsening bruises on the woman’s abdomen that suggest internal bleeding.
In a flood of uncharacteristic rage, he lifts his fist and slams it into the mirror, shattering the glass and sending glittering triangles sliding across the floor.
handline/attack line: two words for a smaller size of hose, usually 1 3/4", that can be carried and maneuvered by a single firefighter.
Frowning, he starts his bike again, but keeps the headlight off, rolling toward the light as quietly as the motor will let him. Long before he reaches the source of the light—he can make out a silhouette now—he parks the motorcycle and steps off the gravel road, where the crunching rock might give him away.
“What have you got?”
“You okay?”
“That one chest pain guy. You’re just jealous.” Garth offers a honey lemon Rogue.
“But you might have to give him time.”
“I would ditch you at that shitty pizza restaurant to go get high for hours and nearly forget to pick you up again.”
End of message.
"Why are we here?" Sam asks. He's sweating, and he's not sure if it's from the heat or the fact that he's suddenly nervous.
“Or,” she says, gesturing with her beer bottle, “everything up until now has been a way of testing him to see if he’s up for this." She sees him scowling. "Hey, I’m just playing devil’s advocate here.”
He pauses briefly to consider this conversation he’s having with his car, then shakes his head and starts the engine.
“Sure.”
Dean narrows his eyes, then says, "I'm walking back to my bike. Then I'm gone."
He lowers his forehead into his hand, a suffocating tightness squeezing his chest. He can’t forget what the ever-cynical Bobby said to him before they assembled their measly team of hunters to go to Carthage.
“Well, I don’t see it that way anymore.” He keeps his gaze on the tabletop.
"You're a good liar, Dean, but I am starting to figure you out."
"Where have you been my whole life?" Dean asks, and before Cas can give a very literal answer, he kisses him.
Dean takes Cas's wrist and moves forward so that the angel's hand presses flat against Dean's chest. He looks Cas in the eyes and tells him softly, "I'm dying, Cas."
“Maybe you should start, and the Heavenly Host will be more willing to help you.”
“Yeah, I think so, if you can give me a hand up.”
And then Dean….Cas remembers feeling that blade enter his body, and for a long, terrifying moment, he felt his life and grace flicker. In all of his thousands of years as a soldier of heaven's garrison, that had been the closest he'd ever come to death.
He follows the top of Sam’s shoulder blade out to his arm and feels for the humerus. “Yep, you dislocated it. Sit up straight and press your back into the back of the chair.”
"Wow," Jo says, looking Dean up and down. "You are fine."
“Keep in touch about Lilith. And… be careful.”
"Yep."
Jo sighs and sits beside him on the hood, staring out at the highway as she takes a swig of beer. “Pretty much. But it’s the most freedom she’s given me yet, so.”
“You too.”
"Yes," he admits.
“Besides, if you don’t know where the fucking albuterol is, then ask me. It’s better than delaying the treatment someone needs to stay alive. Like I said, your mistakes come back on me, and I haven’t been to court in two years, so don’t fuck up that streak for me.”
Crowley shrugs. "Your choice. I suspect you couldn't deny the reality of all this if you went. If you still think you're insane in a few days…your bad."
Once inside, Sam sits in the armchair with a wince and Dean drops the first aid kit on the floor beside him.
Dean clumsily parries another attack, then manages to catch the three-pronged hilt of the sword and knock it out of Cas’s grasp. Cas grabs Dean’s arm, his grip iron, and snaps it. Dean cries out, and his knees give underneath him.
Cas shakes his head. "What do you mean?"
Cas frowns and leans away slightly. "No. I want to help you because I don't think…I don't think anyone deserves to be forced into the life you have."
“Uh-huh.”
He lifts his head from the desk some time later, realizing belatedly that he had fallen asleep but unsure what woke him. He glances around and starts when he sees Castiel watching him from across the room.
“You’re gonna have a lot of questions for a long time, pal,” Dean says. “I suggest you try to forget about the whole thing.”
“You should have saved her,” she says, whirling on Jack, who’s nearest her. “Why couldn’t you save her? She was healthy, she was fine this morning—what is all this shit for if you can’t keep her alive?” She gestures widely to their equipment spread across the yard.
It makes him want to drive off the face of the earth, into some other world where he could know, for once, that his job was done and his little brother was safe.
"Alastair." He expresses his surprise only with slightly raised eyebrows.
Dean chuckles, not entirely without shame. “Nah. I’m in Kentucky at the moment.” He glances around to make sure no one is around, then adds, “Just killed a ghoul that was terrorizing the locals. I wanted to see if you had anything goin’ on between here and there. I figured I’d head your way for a little R and R, but if you know of anything on the way, I’ll make a stop.”
“Dean! I can’t stop it, Dean, run.” Cas was pleading; he couldn’t kill Dean again; it was breaking his heart. But Dean didn’t run, didn’t fight back, he just looked confused and hurt as the blade pierced his heart. Castiel wept and wept until Dean’s body vanished, and it all happened again. And again. And again.
“How” Dean's voice rasped as he dropped his hand and placed the tie back into his pocket. How do I get him back, how can I save him, see him?” He was distraught but kept staring at the ground in front of him. “Even if Freyja is the original being Love, and even if I have a soul bond with Cas, that doesn’t help anything. Freyja has clearly left earth a long time ago, she is probably in Valhalla, and I am not.”
Sam set the coffee down on the side table and handed Dean a cup. Dean took the coffee blankly, staring straight ahead as if in shock. After a moment, Dean’s features relaxed slightly, and his eyes met Sam’s. “Thanks, Sammy” Dean managed to rasp out the words.
"Yes?" Sam has turned to leave but stopped.
Dean can taste the tang of blood and tears in his mouth and opens his eyes. Sam is lifting him to his feet, supporting him. Dean's whole body is lead, and tension and pain. Somehow he finds himself in his room, but it feels cold and foreign. He doesn't know how long he just lay there, but eventually, he drifts into a fit-full sleep.
Hi folks, I have the rest of the story outlined now and hope to have the rest written by the time I go back to work on the 11th. As always, your comments and feedback are appreciated. I hope you like what I have so far. :)
“So..” jack interrupted sternly “What can we use as a token of Cas?”.
“How does that change anything?” Jack seemed perplexed. “People love who they love. Why does it matter that Cas’ vessel is male?”
"We need to take Dean with us. I don't think he should be left alone right now" Sam stood up from the table. "I'll go check on him."
“Not to interrupt your little squabble here, but we don’t have time for this” Dean’s temper was starting to rise. He wasn’t sure how long he could keep up his swagger when he felt none of what he was projecting. “Where’s Rowena?” The air was sticky, hot, and smelled of char and ash.
“I’m sorry,” Rowena said softly. “I wish I could get your Angel out of there, but I can't. There are very few magics strong enough to rip a soul out of the empty without consequence, and those require ingredients that haven’t existed for millennia, I’m afraid”.
Sam just stared, dumbfounded, and then said, “Dean, Cas rescued you from Hell, rebelled against heaven rather than kill you, more than once, you went to Purgatory to find him when you had the mark of Kain you nearly killed him, but you didn’t. Chuck has never been able to control your story. It’s part of what he hates about us so much. He can’t figure out why he doesn’t have complete control over you or Cas.”
“Where’s Rowena” Dean called, his voice forceful and deep.
“What’s the matter?” Rowena asked, surprised. The daemons around her began snickering at the broken man on the floor of Hell’s throne room. “Silence!” Rowena shrieked in a voice that set the daemons cowering away.
Dean looked up, the knowledge dawning on him as a smile grew on his face. “You mean…” Dean put his hand on Sam’s shoulder while he looked at him. “You mean that the last thing we need to complete the spell is a bit of Cas’ blood? And you think that means we can’t do the spell?”
“Damn it” Dean stood up too quickly, losing his balance and stumbling over the whiskey bottle now lying empty on the floor. The blood rushed from his head, bringing with it the memory of yelling at Sam, and… Dean was going to be sick. He stumbled into the bathroom and held himself over the throne as he emptied the contents of his stomach.
"He is gone," whispered, his body shaking. "He is gone, and I can't…I can't…" Dean was sniffling into a firm hug from Sam.
I'm gonna give you my love, ah
"What was the deal, Jack?" Sam sets his beer on the table and looks at Jack.
“Well, when the love of your life just up and dies, then you get a vote. But right now Sammy, I can’t feel what I’m feeling, so I’m getting a damn drink” He knew he shouldn’t be yelling at Sam. He just couldn’t help it. Too many feelings and so much confusion bubbled up inside him he felt like he would explode. Maybe there was a vampire nest somewhere. He downed one large gulp from the Whiskey bottle and poured himself a glass. The burn in his stomach starting to ease his senses a bit.
Jack swore, shaking his head. “You’re right, I could try to open a rift to the empty long enough to get some blood, but we don’t know if he would bleed there, or if we could safely open the rift without angering the empty and attracting Chuck’s attention.”
Um baby I been learning
“So what, you think…you think that I am seeing Cas’ memories and experiences through the Soulbond and that instead of this just being my absolute worst nightmare, it is real, and he….and the empty is…” Dean trailed off again, looking stricken. His face had drained of colour as he spoke.
Jack swallowed hard, "this is my fault. We have to fix it".
And Dean's world was shifting, what had he meant? Did Cas not know how much Dean loved him? He didn't have time to ask, though. Cas's hand came to rest on his shoulder, the shoulder where he first touched Dean all those years ago. Then the world was spinning, and he was hitting the floor, and a hole ripped in the wall. The empty was taking Cas. Dean's heart was being ripped out of his chest; the world shifted and fell into silence.
You've been learning.
Dean was sitting on his bed, his head hurt, and he was exhausted. Being cured of one’s demon state is no joke. He rubbed his left forearm, frowning slightly; Cain's mark was still there in scarred raised flesh. Silently, he looked through a set of photos of him and Sam together. The memories of what his demon-self had done washed over him, and he wanted to focus on the memories that mattered. Dean paused on a photo of Cas, eyes alight with a bright smile. Just then, there was a knock at the door, and Dean stashed the pictures under a book on his bedside table. “yeah,” he calls, clearing his throat.
There is a flashback in this chapter adapted from 10x3.
“Samuel” Rowena was looking at him sternly. “Stop analyzing your brother's grief...” she paused, her red hair curling around her face and red lips pursed in a haughty, friendly way only Rowena could manage. “His sentimentality may prove useful yet.”
“I’m coming for you….It wasn’t a lie….I love you” Dean’s screams broke into incoherent pleas for Cas. Sam was already across the room, gripping Dean by the shoulders and shaking him.
“Well, you, on the other hand, you, you’re looking good” Dean was speaking just clear enough for Sam and Jack to make out.
"I love you."
So Sam told him everything.
Castiel was screaming inside as the angel blade slipped down his forearm and into his hand. His limbs were outside his control, moving to strike Dean.
“Oh Dean” Rowena lilted a little sadly.
“Because he is in love with a man.” Sam sighed, shaking his head.
“Yeah, ah… what.. what’s up Sammy?” Dean's focus shifted back to the room around him.
"Dean," Sam was there, panting as if he had run, concern written across his face. "Dean, it's ok, it was just a dream." Except it wasn't, not really. No amount of time in Hell could have prepared him for this. His new, entirely personal, living Hell.
Dean looked around frantically; then it dawned on him as he stared into those blue eyes again. "Why does this feel like a goodbye?"
“At least temporarily, it’s a long story…Crowley, stolen grace…there’s a female outside in the car.” Cas stumbles slightly on his words, eying dean affectionately. Dean is standing closer now and cocks his head in confusion. Why is there a woman in the car? “Another time,” Cas adds, looking into Dean’s eyes.
Sam looked at Dean and then back up at Rowena and shook his head almost imperceptibly. It would be unwise indeed to leave Dean so vulnerable in front of so many daemons. Rowena seemed to understand because she began shrieking orders again. “Out! Get out all of you”. Looking as if she would kill them on the spot for not leaving, which she probably could, all the daemons left the throne room. There was a loud boom, and the great doors closed tight.
Sam jumped and looked over at Jack. “What did you find?”
Want to whole lotta love
"Don't bother, I can't eat, I can sleep, I can't think or move. Just leave me here." Dean curled up tighter, clutching at his blankets, suddenly too hot and too cold all at once. "Sam.."
Dean was sitting on his bed, his head hurt and he was exhausted. Being cured of one’s demon state is no joke. He rubbed his left forearm, frowning slightly, the mark of Cain was still there in scarred raised flesh. Silently, he looked through a set of photos of him and Sam together. The memories of what his demon-self had done washed over him and he wanted to focus on the memories that really mattered. Dean paused on a photo of Cas, eyes alight with a bright smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you think dean will be ok?" Jack asked as he sat down at the table with Sam.
“No, it’s not that. I guess Dean and I just don’t have that much in common without hunting, you know? He doesn’t understand or care about what I study in school. He doesn’t know what it’s like to live in an apartment, or study with people, or do a week’s worth of grocery shopping—I wish he’d do something else, but he won’t.”
“How did you think you would get my help, if not through prayer?”
“Hey, Bobby.”
And then, of course, there's Amelia. He never really knew her very well—they kissed twice, but does that really mean anything?—but he misses her all the same. She needed to move back with her husband, he gets that. But he wishes they could've had more of a chance together.
“I’ll worry about him,” Cas says, “but I was doing that anyway. It’s a dangerous job. He knew that when he applied, and so did I.” He leans forward on the railing of Dean’s bed. “You never told me how you’re doing.”
He feels bad sending the kid on a wild goose chase for a nonexistent nurse, but he needs him out of the room. The timing is narrow, too—the moment the curtain swings shut behind Jack, Dean breaks into tears.
Dean tightens his jaw. “Two of ‘em. The third… I don’t know.” He glances over at his brother as he pulls onto the road. “You’d better start talkin’.”
He exorcises himself.
He's gone.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot upward, and for a moment he says nothing. Cas feels terrible, but he knows he’s right.
Crowley tightens his mouth and crosses his legs. Normally, his temptation would be to try to convince Dean to come back to his side. That's what he wants, after all. But he sees something in Dean he's never seen before, something oddly human, and if Crowley had a conscience, this might be said to reach it.
“No,” Cas says. “Not at all.”
“It’s kind of numb.”
“There was that one time I lost you at the park because I was trying to get in some girl’s pants. I had to call Dad when I couldn’t find you. And when you were little, you got pneumonia, and it took me three days to take you to the hospital because Dad didn’t have insurance and I thought he’d be mad about the bill.”
Miracle curls up in the dog bed in the corner and watches him as he uncovers the wide metal frame of the black 1967 Impala that used to belong to his father. Seeing it always gives him a chill, some combination of wariness and nostalgia. He opens the driver door—there’s barely room inside the narrow garage of his apartment complex—and slips into the driver’s seat.
"Dean, why are we here? Is this the 'something normal?'"
Annoyingly, Sam was right. Dean felt emotionally volatile all day yesterday, and he would’ve hated to let Jack see how much the accident had affected him. If there’s one thing he’s noticed about the kid, it’s that he takes Dean’s cues, and he worried that Jack knowing how shaken he was about it would make Jack’s own experience worse. Seeing how spirited Jack is now, his concern seems unwarranted. Of course, when Dean was that age, he would’ve bounced back a lot easier, too.
Cas responds by pulling off his trench coat, then his suit coat, and starting to unbutton his dress shirt. "I had the idea a while back. I thought it…it meant something to me and it would probably mean something to you, so I just went with it…."
Vision obscured by blood and dark spots, Dean gets to his hands and knees. “Sammy,” he says, “we gotta get Jo up and leave. Before the hellhounds get here.”
Somehow, this feels like an accusation. "What?" he asks, still caught up on the fact that he's pretty sure the demon just called him a moose. He grabs the hellhound glasses off the counter and slides them on to check if Crowley has anyone with him, then pockets them.
He can’t stop thinking about his conversation with Dean. It was weird, getting a call from him in the middle of the night, for no particular reason. Even now, he’s not entirely sure there wasn’t something wrong Dean just wasn’t telling him about.
Dean leaves and Sam finds himself standing by his apartment door, unable to convince himself to do anything else.
“Sam took off?”
"It was faster for me. We already knew what to do." Balthazar isn't looking at him.
Crowley walks past him and opens the doors to the throne room. "Take him to a cell," he says to the demons outside. "I'll deal with him later."
In the end, they work the case together. Sam quickly realizes Eileen is entirely capable of finishing this hunt on her own—more than he is—but the stakes are high enough she didn’t want to miss the opportunity to be thorough.
Sam doesn’t pick up.
“Oh, no,” Cas says, looking bewildered and now guilty. “I’ll take the flowers back if—”
Cas leans in, running his finger around the rim of Dean’s empty glass as he says quietly, “I’ll tell you exactly what to do and how to do it if we go somewhere more private.”
“So? What’s it gonna be, you in or out?”
The Mark.
Then the noise stops, and the light fades. Cautiously, Dean lowers his hands and lifts his head. For a moment, he sees the flicker of a sort of afterimage—a vaguely humanoid form, metallic bronze and covered in glowing eyes, seemingly faceless, with six burning wings and three crystalline wheels encircling it like rings around a planet. He must see for half a second or less, but for that time, it’s overwhelming. It pushes every thought from his mind, fills him with an inexplicable awe and desperation, and weakens him to the point he nearly collapses.
She’s still there, in fact, when it’s near closing time and the librarian comes around to tell them they’ll need to leave soon. Then she’s quick to leave, and she’s out the door before Sam has his backpack zipped.
Two grueling hours later, in the lot outside the warehouse, he stops the car so fast the tires slide in the gravel. He tosses the demon-fighting kit he’s assembled over the last year into his duffel bag and slings it over his shoulder. He doesn’t take the time to change out the silver bullets in his 1911 for devil’s trap ones, instead ejecting the whole magazine and slamming in a new one.
The angel keeps his face turned toward the sky. “I’m a multidimensional celestial being, I don’t need a home. I’ve always returned to the service of the Lord.”
“What?” Bart is genuinely incredulous. He leans across the table. “You were a damn
"Thank you," Dean whispers. He coughs and blood splashes onto his cheek and slides out of the corner of his mouth. Cas wipes it away with his sleeve.
"So what is it? It looks random to me."
“Under that bridge we went over on the way in?”
The cut starts just above his knee and runs down the side of his leg about four inches. It’s deep enough that if he spreads the flayed skin slightly he can see muscle, but the muscle itself appears intact.
Cas frowns and shakes his head. "I'm not going to like this, am I?"
Dean raises his eyebrows. “You mean they’re pulling me off the truck to babysit the probie?”
It’s not about you. It doesn’t matter what happens to you, you have to find Sam.
"It was a big deal," Gabriel says, "but the big guys got the sticks out of their asses long enough to agree to it."
He’s never seen flames flare to life so easily, so elegantly.
This chapter got a bit more personal than I was expecting (both for the characters and for myself) but I think it turned out well.
Cas studies Sam with a distant but somewhat derisive expression. “If you are willing to do what needs to be done, you’ll be able to kill Lilith, even at the very last moment.”
"Hold on," he says before the angels start flying away. "I just—I need to know. Dean's soul, did it make it to heaven?"
“You asshole.” Sam shakes his head, fidgeting with his hospital badge. “I just about panicked when I heard Garth give that patch. Thirty-nine-year-old male firefighter injured in building collapse? Fuck that.”
The heat is so much more than what he remembers from his training burn all those months ago. Even though the windows have blown out, ventilation is poor and visibility is terrible through the smoke. Jack becomes acutely aware that his SCBA is the only thing separating him from a lungful of death.
“Jo?”
Cas gets up and decides to try another thing that humans do: showering.
“Why not? If he’s really getting visions, and that angel said he knew what to do, it seems like he might be right.”
“I am.”
“I didn’t—I didn’t
"Dean," Cas says, shaking his head and frowning. He sets his hand against Dean's cheek and puts his thumb over Dean's lips. "I'm not going to try to tell you that it's okay and nothing you've done matters. I don't know what you've done. But I can tell you that that isn't who you are. Not really. Just the fact that you're here, suffering these—these injuries because you won't kill anymore…that says everything. You did that on your own, Dean. I might have been there, but this isn't my doing."
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” a daemon asked, her voice drawling with mirth.  She quirked the head of her meat suit to one side, brunet hair set in short spikes.
Jack was shifting from side to side. He never liked it when Sam and Dean got yelling. Normally Cas would come in and diffuse Dean before something too unforgivable was said. Jack didn’t know what to do since Cas wasn’t here, so instead Jack tried the only thing he knew how. Distraction. “So how is Rowena? I always liked her, she was very pretty and very evil, but yet so kind and smart. How is hell treating her? Does she like it there?”
Dean was headed back to his room when he suddenly realized he wasn’t in his own room, but Cas’. It looked the same as always. A neatly made bed laid in the center of the room, and there was very little to distinguish it from any of the other empty rooms in the Bunker. The neatly hung suites, blue ties, and bedside table were all that was left of Cas. Until Dean managed to bring him home, of course. A small gleam of hope bloomed inside him, though he was not overly optimistic. The only beings powerful enough to take a soul from the empty are Chuck and Death, and neither would do it.
Sam was sitting in the library, reading another book on the mythological origins of love. Another book about using witchcraft to make someone fall in love with you and how it is impossible. According to the text, temporary infatuation could be achieved with a well-placed hex bag, but nothing genuinely love. How will this ever help us? Sam sighed and closed the book, placing his head in his hands. From the looks of it, Jack and Dean weren’t doing much better. Dean had outright fallen asleep, his face planted firmly over the open book on the table before him. Dean must be dreaming because he kept muttering to himself.
Suddenly the room blurred and receded until Dean was standing in complete and utter darkness. He turned around, trying to get his bearings. What in the hell happened? Where am I? A scream echoed in the distance. The sound was unmistakable and sent a knife through Dean’s chest. Cas. He ran. He ran as fast as he could towards the sound of agony. He ran and kept running, but couldn’t get any closer. Another voice, a female one, was smirking and taunting. “No-one is coming to save you, Clarence,” the female drawled. “He never loved you; why would he bother? All you ever did was leave him. Look again at your happy memory and know that it was all a lie”.
I'm gonna give you my love, ah oh
“Dean... Dean!” Sam was staring at him.
Dean reached behind him and picked up his jacket, holding it up for Sam to see. “His blood is here, Sam.” Dean was on his feet in moments, rushing to the War room where the spell bowl lay. “Jack!” Dean called as he ran. “Get ready to meet a new celestial baddie. We’re summoning Freyja. Now!” The hope and anxiety radiated from Dean’s voice as he tipped the spell bowl and wiped it out. Pulling the knife from his pocket, Dean held the handprint over the bowl and began scraping flecks of the dried blood into the bowl. Once there was a small pile in the bottom, Dean seemed satisfied and placed Cas’ tie in the bowl. “Sam, Jack!”.
This was no different. He was sitting in the Impala's passenger seat, Dean in the driver’s seat, and Led Zeppelin coming through the stereo.
There was a long pause when no one spoke, then clearly, with more strength than he had had in days, "He told me he loved me."
"The one thing I want…that I truly want…I know I can't have" Cas was looking at him with those precious blue eyes, tears of joy and relief and sorrow in them. What was happening? Why was he saying this?
“So what, I’m on some kind of cosmic benzos now? My head feels like crap.” Dean made to get up but couldn’t, so he sat back down and sipped on his coffee.
As he turned around he could see Sam standing there, fists clenched, eyes livid. “You aren’t the only one who lost someone, Dean.” Sam’s voice was full of hurt and sadness. “In fact, I have lost someone more than once, so maybe I don’t get exactly what it’s like to lose an angel… but I lost Eileen twice ok, so you can take your drink and shove it if you think you are the only one who is suffering.”
I've been year-yearning
“With everything” was all Dean could manage.
Sam cleared his throat and then spoke. “Dean and Cas were fighting Billy. They had injured her, but she had them cornered and was going to kill them both. Castiel had made a deal with the Empty that, in exchange for releasing Jack, she would claim Cas in a moment of true happiness. As Billy was attacking, Cas told Dean that he loved him, the Empty came and took both Cas and Billy. I found dean shaking and sobbing on the floor, and he didn’t speak for days. This is pretty much what it’s been like ever since. He is completely heartbroken.” Sam looked at Rowena, willing her to understand. So he didn’t have to say it outright.
“Those in my coven who used to worship the goddess Freyja used to say that to summon her from Valhalla one needed a token of a love truly bonded, the tears of one who has lost, the tears of love over land and water, and the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep” Rowena paused as if remembering some fond memory of years passed.
Dean looked down at the rest of his eggs and felt sick. He stood up with the bowl in his hand and walked over to the trashcan. He scrapped the rest of the eggs in the trash. He then went over to the sofa and turned on Doctor Sexy M.D. Dean pulled a blanket over himself and felt sleep overtake him.
*Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization.
"Ya know, the only good thing about John showing up was that maybe seeing your big dick will scare him off for a while." Cas chocked on his coffee and glared at Dean before smiling.
*Unusual talkativeness
After Dean got the alarm off he looked around his room. His eyesight was blurry due to the tears. He hadn't realized he'd been crying in his sleep. Dean stretched his arms up. He tried to wake up but he couldn't. Everything was blurry and grey and Dean's arms felt so sore and heavy. His eyes hurt to be open and his head felt like it was being pulled in two. Dean laid back down. He put his hands under the blanket and put his head on his pillow. The normal soft pillow and blanket felt like sandpaper and stone. Dean couldn't  be bothered to care though. He slowly drifted back off to sleep.
*Distractibility
John's eyes got wide when he took in Cas's appearance. Seeing his son-in-laws dick was not what he was expecting this morning when he went to visit Dean. He averted his eyes and looked up at Cas with a blank face.
Hey. Hope ur doing good. Be strong.
*Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)
"Come on, up and at em Cas." Dean threw Cas his dark blue robe then put on his grey robe and loosely tide it. Cas got up and slipped his robe on, not bothering to tie it. He followed Dean out of their room and into the kitchen. Dean opened the cabinet and got the coffee grounds before turning on the coffee pot and starting it. Cas opened the fridge to see what food they could have for breakfast.
If you have any questions about bipolar disorder feel free to ask, but I am not a doctor and do not know everything, also everyone is different so I will only have answers from my own personal experience.
“Yeah, man,” Garth says. “Chambers moved to blue shift, remember?”
"So about Sam." He removes the cigarette from his lips. "Obviously there's a reason I told you to come here. Let's find him. We can start with the bar."
Dean fixes him with a hard gaze for several seconds. Cas holds it evenly, though with a hint of plea. Finally, Dean blinks slowly as he looks away, his expression admitting that Cas might be right and he believes him. Still, he says nothing, instead digging a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it.
But not to Cas, and that's why he can't return to heaven. He's managed to fall in love, and fall in love with a demon at that, and there could hardly be a higher offense to heaven.
Dean shifts on his pillows. He feels woozy and shaky and everything aches, most of all his head, the right side of his chest, and his face. Aside from the pain, too, he feels like he can’t get a full breath, which only exacerbates his feeling of general shittiness.
"I—I don't know what to say," Cas says, stepping closer to Dean. "Why won't you turn around?"
“We tried it your way, Dean." His voice remains measured. "I’ve been ignoring messages from Heaven for three months to do it your way. Now I know that was wrong. So, yeah. I’ll do what they want me to do.”
“Just let me do this one good thing, please. If God wants me to—”
Sam shakes his head. "I don't know what's gotten you worked up. There's nothing out there."
“Me? Yeah, of course. Look, I gotta go. It’s late here and I’m hittin’ the road tomorrow morning, so. Have fun huddling around dictionaries or whatever it is you crazy kids do.”
× × ×
“I think I’m rusty,” Sam says. “I haven’t had to fight demons in months.”
Dean and Cas exchange a look.
"You haven't killed me yet," Cas points out.
"So killing you will get him that?"
Alastair has taken a new meatsuit, though one still typical to his choices; a middle-aged man with hard features and dark gray hair. He wears a business suit that Crowley notes must have been expensive, so whoever the human was, he was probably quite successful.
The most eye-catching is the wolf's head at the center of his chest; half of it is its snarling face and the other half is its skull. An image of a night sky filled with clouds surrounds the wolf and spreads across Dean's pectoral muscles, almost reaching his collarbone. It's all done in shades of white, gray, and black except the wolf's eye, which is a bright, icy blue.
“Eighteen.”
Cas sighs. He can't read Dean's expression, but he senses that he should give him a break. "I can heal that wound, you know."
“I don’t understand,” Sam says, standing now and looking between Cas and Dean. “How do you…”
Dean wakes up with the headache of a lifetime. He moans and rolls over, his mind momentarily empty of what happened yesterday. He feels like his head is going to violently split open. This is a whole new kind of hangover. Demons can handle alcohol quite well, and Dean always drank it fairly regularly. Regularly, but usually in moderation. He was a weapon that couldn't afford to be dulled.
Dean nods and starts to stand. “Car.”
“I received revelation,” Cas says evenly. His eyes remained locked to Dean’s for a moment longer before he steps aside and looks to Sam and Jo. “Lilith is powerful, but so are the seals she’s breaking. She’ll grow weaker the longer you wait, and she has only broken forty seals so far.”
Dean nods. Then, as if knowing what an inadequate answer it is, he asks, “You want to talk about it?”
“Fuck.”
“Lilith isn’t building an army for no reason,” Dean says, pulling onto the highway right in front of a semi-truck and gunning the engine. Sam had almost forgotten how much he hates some of his brother’s driving habits. “She’s trying to start the biblical apocalypse. If she breaks all these seals, she frees Lucifer from Hell, and the whole planet gets destroyed.”
"I'm never nervous, Cas. About anything. I don't know if I can do this."
"I know."
Dean grins.
"I know, I know," he says. He has a look in his eyes. "Cas, I need to talk to you. I've—I've changed plans."
The angel is silent for a long moment. "Okay," he says quietly.
Cas isn't quick enough with a lie and instead remains silent.
"Better?" Cas asks.
"I—I'm alive. Please tell me you're here to explain what the hell happened."
I gotta admit I don't love this chapter, but hopefully you all think it's okay.
“Shut your eyes and cover your ears,” he hears Cas call over the demons’ roar.
She stares at him for several seconds. "You do this a lot, don't you?"
Dean shrugs. "I take pride in those things, too. What can I say? I'm good at what I do."
fuck.” He pulls a piece of paper from his demon kit and reads the rest of the exorcism from it. At

Dean frowns hazily. Cas can tell he's far from normal, even after being healed. "I don't know. It started early this morning. The vomiting started about an hour ago."
"Are you
"So you've said," she says, still holding his arm with a grip of steel. When he slouches slightly with a sigh, she lets go. "I'm Jo, by the way." She offers her right hand.
Jack doesn’t feel ready to get out and move on just yet, but he does as asked and steps down to the floor. Then Dean hugs him. It takes him by surprise at first, and then he fully breaks down and begins to cry into Dean’s shoulder.
"Come on," Dean decides for him, stepping past him out of the room and putting a hand on his shoulder. It seems a surprisingly warm gesture from the demon. As Dean heads down the hallway, Cas is left momentarily frozen, still smelling the hints of leather, cigarette smoke, and hotel soaps he'd gotten from Dean passing within a few inches of him.
"Yes. All I ever knew was that it was a car accident. They never told me what they were doing, just that I had to stay with a babysitter—and they just…never came to take me home."
“How about this plan?” a new voice says as the demon steps out of the teacher’s lounge down the hall. It holds a struggling little girl to its side, covering her mouth with one hand and holding a knife in the other. “How about you give me my sixty-six kids, and I let the rest of you all go?”
"Was it…something important?" Cas asks.
Sam has exactly one day off every week. He's been told time and time again to make the most of it; go out to eat or drink, hang out with friends, go to this event or that. He rarely does anything of the sort. Instead, he's sitting on the lawn of the tiny backyard behind his apartment. He has no chair, so he sits on the grass with an iced latte sitting beside him. Riot is stretched out on his side next to him, a bandage laced around his shoulder. Sam has a hand on the dog's side and uses the other to hold the book he's about halfway through.
Dean steps up into the back of the ambulance. “Longer than you’ve been alive.”
"You are not going to kill her."
Sam shakes his head. "Haven't you only had this car a few months?"
“Gettin’ a bit dusty, Baby,” he says, brushing off his hands before pulling open the door and sitting down. The door hinge has started creaking again. “I really need to give you a once-over. I just don’t have the money for it right now. We’ll go to Bobby’s next week and I’ll get you all fixed up, okay?”
Dean shrugs. “Suit yourself.” He snaps it shut and slips it back into his pocket.
Cas knows where Dean is. Dean's desire for him to be there right now is close enough to a prayer that he can tell. He shakes his head, and in an instant, he's there.
“Hunting? We’ve already talked about this, Dean. Yeah, it is.”
"I know," he says raising his voice. "Trust me, I know. None of this would've happened without you. I don't even know who I am without you around—you were the light to my dark, everything. But I came so close to killing you, and I—I will never be okay with that. I can't risk hurting you again, Cas. I can't."
Dean pulls Sam to his feet with his uninjured arm. “You good?”
"No," he repeats as he pulls his shirt off over his head. "Because you can't help."
"Cas." He looks from Cas to Jo and back.
Cas notices that Dean's hands are gripping the counter on either side of the sink so tightly his knuckles have gone white. He convulses once as if heaving or giving a silent cough and he lowers his head over the sink.
