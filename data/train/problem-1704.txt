John took Sherlock's other hand an fixed it with an iron grip over the taller boy's head. The sounds Sherlock made all the time were too damn delicious and John was this close, almost too close, to just fall down to his knees and make this impossible boy beg and writhe against him, bringing him a good piece closer to heaven.
Not even five seconds later about three people he didn't even have time to recognise, came up to him and shot him before he was able to hide behind some thin walls.
"You know," John tries again cautiously, "the rugby lads are going to go laser tagging this afternoon. They asked me to come with them, but I thought we'd do something together. We could both go, you'd finally meet them. They're actually asking me all the time to bring you with me to practice." And with a nervous, faked chuckle he added silently, "They think we're a thing because of all the time we spend together."
"If you mean Anderson sleeping with Donovan, then yes, I did."
"Oh, shut up. Of course he likes you! He's asked you countless times, even I know that. Now go on, put on some clothes and brush your hair. Oh and hurry up, we really are running late." Ruffling through his curls she left the room and not even five minutes later they were sat in Mrs. Hudson's car on their way to laser tag.
They all knew that Sherlock was new to this kind of stuff and he was really proud to have friends which don't mind to have him around, encouraging him to keep up and informing him about their plan.
Noticing, that Sherlock was about to hide from everyone, when Mike came up to him, taking the lanky boy with him to the others, John started to smile.
John meant to say something to Sherlock for quite some time and now it has slipped out. Noticing Sherlock putting up his mask again, to hide his sad emotions, he knew why he was afraid to talk to Sherlock about maybe making some other friends.
And with a dirty grin John took his gun, ripped himself off of Sherlock's trembling body and shot him right at the red point marked on his west that would end the game for him.
Sherlock slowly opened his mouth and immediately the blond boy started to lick and taste and feel. He could feel Sherlock sighing into the kiss, only encouraging him more and more.
"Amazing! It's gonna be so much fun, I promise!" And, glancing at his watch he added," Okay, I have to get to Biology now, meet me at the arena at 4:30, I'll text you the address. Don't be late, see ya!"
"You like him a lot, don't you?" Sherlock knew that there was no point in lying. This woman has known him for as long as he can remember. She was there for him when he came home crying, because the other children had been mean to him, had treated his wounds, listened to him. And so he just said, "Yes, I do. But I know that he'd never like me back in that way, let alone show me off to his friends. I'm quite certain of that actually. He's never really invited me to his rugby games or practice or whatever."
Suddenly John had to concentrate very very hard on not starting to growl and get up, sprint right to Anderson, that sick son of a bitch, and punch him right across the face as well. But no. No. Sherlock was his friend. Not his lover or boyfriend or partner or whatever. Only his friend and this social position doesn't give someone the right to start a fight afterwards. So he tried to hide his angry mood and asked silently, "Why exactly did he do this to you? Are you sure that it wasn't your fault?"
"Sherlock, John's here for you!" Mrs. Hudson shouted from downstairs.
Not a split second later, John was met with a death glare. "Are you really teasing me now? Now, when I am receiving insufferable pain?!" "What kind of a question is this, yes, of course, I'm teasing you, you brave little fighter," he laughed.
"Err yeah, can you send him upstairs maybe?" he called back.
"Ugh John, this is ridiculous," the taller boy complained.
He always wanted the curly haired boy to come to his rugby practice or stay after his matches, come with him to the pup afterwards. Any opportunity to let his other friends get to know this amazing boy. He'd invited him plenty of times and got nothing but some crappy excuses.
The hall itself had two platforms with lots and lots of places to hide, the black light giving the whole area a mysterious aura.
"Hey, erm.. did something else happen?", he tried to ask nonchalantly. The fast up-jolting of Sherlock's head was more than enough for an answer.
For a moment Sherlock considers giving the address of a hotel, because after all, this man is a stranger. But then he decides he doesn't care, and he actually does want that liver. He’s still pretending to himself that he isn't going to ask this man up to his flat. He gives his actual address, and the man nods. Sherlock watches him shift the car into gear and has a brief moment of anger that it's so easy for him, but then notices the man's fingers on the gearstick and has a small internal conniption about their callouses and where he might feel them. The ride is quiet: Sherlock doesn't know what to say and the man seems content to say nothing.
“Good to meet you, James; I’m Sherlock Holmes, as I’m sure you know, and this is Doctor John Watson.”
“The shower,” John says, humming as he pours tea. “Do you mind? Been a long day.”
It was a very bad case. One that left both of them upset: Sherlock because he’d been too late, John because he knew it couldn’t have been helped but he couldn’t reassure Sherlock.
“Morning,” Sherlock says softly, knowing his face is pink still.
John is a marvellous dinner date.
Sherlock doesn’t think that’s possible.
“Be nice to have a new vest on,” he murmurs, “Thoughtful of you, thank you.” Sherlock glances up, wondering if he’s being mocked, but John’s eyes are crinkling wonderfully at the corners, confident and straightforward, and Sherlock feels his stomach settle so quickly that it gives him vertigo for a moment.
“Shh,” John says, and now he’s drawing Sherlock into warm water. The soft strokes of the cleansing cloth pass in a haze of sensation and shivers.
The man pauses and says, “I don’t know your name yet.”
Sherlock nods, heart pounding, and leads him inside.
Sherlock swallows, nods, and says hoarsely, "And twenty pounds for the drive."
John, who had recently bought a pack of six new white vests and had decided that stripping off his overshirt and wearing nothing but his vest and jeans in the flat was acceptable, like some James-Dean type American. Tight vests. White. Practically translucent.
The part of his brain that knows the less savoury portions of London is trying not to explore darker avenues. At least he knows John is drug-free: Sherlock is all too familiar with what an addict looks like, and John has none of the signs. “You can keep the difference,” Sherlock decides, “After all, you did manage to get a suit, regardless of when.”
John pockets the key and the card. “I’ll get myself the things on your card,” he promises gently, and Sherlock feels his shoulders drop with relief. “Now go before you’re late, your driver’s already here,” John continues, and a hand at the curve of Sherlock’s lower back guides him to the door, carefully locking up after them both.
Charles is taken off guard, as Sherlock meant him to be. His son, however, starts in his seat, and Charles glares at him before continuing, gruffer than before.
John’s hand is careful, never pushing him too far, but stroking his curls and guiding him gently; when Sherlock pushes himself too far and nearly gags himself, John tugs him back. When he forgets to breathe, John gently pulls a curl, making him suck in a breath. He’s patient with Sherlock, not urging him on, not yanking or demanding. Sherlock’s immeasurably grateful for the steadiness of the contact. It still takes a few minutes before he can bear to open his eyes.
“Ah,” John says, eyes twinkling. Sherlock blushes; John seems to somehow know how much Sherlock will enjoy putting Mycroft out. “I’ll be sure to wear something appropriate.”
John’s smile is gentle. “Thank you.” It’s sincere, and Sherlock wants to preen, but John’s moving on, distracting him from the last of the trembles in his fingers. “What’s this dinner meeting about, then?”
“Do excuse me,” John says, and leans toward James across the table. “Would you mind sharing my starter as well? I’m not quite hungry enough for a full.”
“Of. Of course I don’t mind,” Sherlock stutters and then recovers himself. “To the left down the hall... there’s a dressing gown, and towels are under the sink.”
Sherlock brushes his teeth, as John disappears again, presumably to do the same. When he’s done John comes back to collect the lot, deposit it in the bathroom, and then he steps in again, and asks, “Where do I sleep?”
John was snoring.
He wants. He wants to know the feel of him, the taste, he wants to know if he can do to John what John did to him the night before. His stomach has swooped down and back up again, and he parts his lips, afraid to ask.
The suit smells of John already. John, his cologne, his heat and an odd faint chemical scent Sherlock can’t remember the name for. “That’s it. Did you know you’re shaking, Sherlock? Your face stayed still but your hands are cold and trembling.”
“I don’t care,” he says, after a long moment. “And I do care. I feel stupid going, but if I don’t work with the company then I lose my stake in it – that’s how the trust is set up.”
“And you?” John asks, and Sherlock considers it.
in a way that makes Sherlock’s stomach do a flip every so often. There’s also the way John opens every door for him, ushering him through without a hint of pretentiousness or condescension. Sherlock has the odd feeling of being cared for without being paternalized, which is very strange. The only person he normally allows to care for him, aside from his brother, is Lestrade, and Lestrade is decidedly paternal about it (as far as Sherlock can figure out, Lestrade has decided to adopt Sherlock. Sherlock doesn’t know how he feels about this yet).
Sherlock didn’t drop the violin, but he did drop his jaw, and John smirked.
Sherlock smiles smugly. “Oh, he will, but he won’t be able to say anything about it without embarrassing himself.”
“Can I?” he asks, and a hand strokes through his curls, steady and kind. Sherlock’s eyes fall closed, a breath shuddering off his lips. The hand draws him forward; something’s inexplicably caught in Sherlock’s throat. He doesn’t want to open his eyes.
John manages to catch the unopened bottle of red before it shatters itself on the floor, Sherlock notices, as Charles sputters indignantly at the state of his front. There is very nearly shouting, but then James quickly takes his father’s elbow.
“Indeed. You’ve received our most recent offer?”
John is hard. The knowledge has him shuddering suddenly, breath in tight pants, and even as John considers pulling away with a lean, Sherlock clutches his thigh again, closer. He trembles and suddenly realises what they must look like, Sherlock on his knees, shaking at John’s feet.
“How do you know?”
It wasn’t
Sherlock spends all day fussing over what John might be doing. Mycroft has narrowed his eyes at him at least six times over the board table; Sherlock’s never been good at paying attention to these things but he’s normally good at hiding how much he’s ignoring it.
Soft smutty smut.
When he does, his hands clutch John’s trousers tighter, creasing the fabric terribly, he guesses. John’s got his head back, his own eyes closed as his chest heaves in great slow breaths, his face creased with a quiet pleasure that makes Sherlock moan around him. He wonders how often John gets this, and immediately wants to be
“I doubt it,” was all he said, before flopping over on the sofa so his back was to John’s white-vested person.
John shook his head fondly and headed upstairs.
“I paid for the week,” he says, and his voice shakes. He’s past caring about if he sounds collected. John’s response is merely a tilt of the head, a soft nod. Sherlock shudders once, and gestures at the armchair John had liked before with the hand holding his bow.
Sherlock leads the way up and has a very particular feeling that the man is watching his arse. Instead of bothering him, it gives him a weird tingly feeling that he has to shake discreetly from his fingers before they'll allow him to put the key in the upstairs lock. He opens the door, looking around his familiar clutter. The man steps in behind him. Sherlock flicks the switch,sees what the man is wearing in the full light, and blurts out, "The green makes you stand out for customers."
“This is my son, James,” Charles says, “Thought he ought to come along, his inheritance and all.” He scoffs as Sherlock offers a hand, but the handsome younger man is staring at John with a sort of dazed look on his face. It takes him a moment to realise what Sherlock is doing and shake. Sherlock would sympathise if his stomach hadn’t started to roll.
Padding footsteps, and then a soft rustle of fabric. John’s face appears in his line of sight as he kneels between Sherlock’s knees, one hand on each as he looks up to scan Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s heart skips once and he opens his mouth, desperate to say something that will fix the mess in his head, but John shakes his head softly before he can speak.
By the time he can go home he’s trying hard not to second-guess everything he’s chosen over the past 24 hours. He can distract himself with thoughts of John in various suits, but that only lasts until he gets to the door, and that’s when his hands start shaking.
Oof. Sorry for the long wait. Been writing Avengers fic and it was flowing really well, so that's been highest on the agenda lately. Back to your not-so-regularly schedule Sex God John Watson.
“Sleep,” he agrees quietly, and Sherlock’s shoulders fall slightly, relieved, as John smiles. “I’ll make the bed if you want the toilet first.”
I have officially graduated University, and I get a gap year! I'm excited to be back to writing things for fun rather than coursework.
“Casual boyfriend. We’re trying it on,” Sherlock says with a swallow. He wishes.
“I don’t see how it’s that funny.”
Sherlock nods, mouth dry, and John pauses, scanning his face. Something he sees must affect him, because he shifts to sit next to Sherlock, and hands guide him closer. Before Sherlock really understands what’s happening he’s being held close, head resting on John’s shoulder.
"How much for a week?" Sherlock says. His brain catches up a moment after. He internally panics,
John hears him anyway, somehow, fingers tracing his jaw as his laugh turns into a smile Sherlock nearly could imagine was fond. “Not a hunch, Sherlock. An extrapolation from the current data set.”
John taps his thigh twice. Sherlock realises what he means and lifts up enough for John to slide down both trousers and pants. He doesn’t know where the condom came from, but a moment later John’s rolling it on him with a practised hand. The first touch leaves him breathless and hazy, blinking down at John, dazed, as the man smiles at him gently.
The next morning Sherlock wakes curled against John’s chest, body warm with sleep. He’s so comfortable he doesn’t want to move, but he’s also internally panicking at the idea of having to shift away.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John, and John planted his feet, lifting his chin.
Sherlock experiences intimacy and quakes.
John pulls back again, eyes twinkling fondly. “Something for you to think of while I’m gone,” he says, like he knows Sherlock hates it when he’s gone even for a few hours. But then he stands and heads for the door again, and slips out of it before Sherlock has managed to squeak out a word.
going to bed. You’ll calm down.”
John sits without questioning him, looking regal and settled in himself in a way Sherlock never is. Sherlock sets the violin on his chair, wiping the rosin dust off, and then turns, sinking to his knees, looking up at him. He knows he’s the one paying. He knows. But John’s worth worshipping, now, on the battered throne of Sherlock’s armchair, and it’s all Sherlock wants to do.
Sherlock is already upset because he's had to go to a charity gala and Mycroft made a comment about his experiments. His PA, Molly, is so sweet but also can't seem to manage to keep truly terrible people from finding him, so he had to have a talk with Magnussen. He hates Magnussen; Magnussen only ever talks about business, but he does it in a way that makes Sherlock feel like he's wanting to buy Sherlock instead, and it leaves him feeling grimy in his skin for hours after. He'd snuck out but his driver apparently has a fucking American manual car where everything's on the wrong side and it's fucking with his head, and he's managed to stall it, and he's tired. He slams his hands on the wheel, grips, and shouts like a maniac for a moment, because fuck this, fuck it so much, fuck it, he has a liver in the fridge and he wants to go home and dissect it, that's all, and if he manages to get liver juice on this suit and ruin it, so much the better, he hates this suit.
John laughs down at the dishes, shaking his head. “You’re something else,” he says, rinsing the porcelain and gently setting it in the rack, drying his hands before coming back over to Sherlock and stroking his curls back. Sherlock is about to protest that John will have ruined them when chapped lips touch his forehead. He freezes, eyes slamming closed, but not before he’s seen the steady pulse of John’s heart in his neck.
“Just me. My brother will be there, he’d know it was weird.”
"Here," Sherlock says, and points out a parking spot as they pull up. He gets out, pulling his wallet out of his pocket, and watches the man emerge from the car. He blurts out, "You're a sex worker."
As Sherlock's frantically wondering if he has milk in, the man says, "Is that a real skull?" then pauses, and answers himself, "It is. Right."
Of course he is. He's paying for it. Rather than the thought putting him off, it makes Sherlock snuggle in closer; he's got limited time, after all, and if he's paying, he's allowed. He lets himself sink into the soft touches, the scent of the man he's clutching, the thought that this man went out looking for tricks in a pine-coloured suit, and found Sherlock instead.
Sherlock shook his head against John’s shoulder. Now that John’s said it, he can feel his fingers shaking, the irregular heartbeat. He hasn’t had an anxiety attack since university, and now the sight of John in a suit has managed it. Sherlock is unsure whether that says something about John, or Sherlock’s self-control.
“Our profit margin last year was affected by that ridiculous business in the Caribbean,” he says, as though hurricanes were a mere inconvenience, but an inconvenience that had been purposefully created to upset his nerves. “We’ll be right as rain this next year, and I’m sure under your business management, you’d thrive.”
“Shopping?” John’s voice is amused, and Sherlock hastens to explain himself.
John reads his face, scanning it, and then stands again. For a moment Sherlock’s worries he’s going to leave, but instead, he slips off the dressing gown, and Sherlock’s hands clench on the wooden armrests of the chair as he forgets how to breathe. John is effortlessly sensual, comfortable in his body, unafraid of Sherlock’s eyes devouring the sight in front of him. John folds the dressing gown and bends, giving Sherlock quite the view, before placing it on the floor and kneeling again, using the fabric as a pad for his knees.
“I won’t,” John says, voice amused, and Sherlock realises with a flush that he heard. “Is the bedroom the one past the loo?” Sherlock nods, and John easily carries him to it, letting Sherlock open the door, then stepping through and setting him on the bed.
“You’re going to bed,” Sherlock snapped, but John shook his head.
even as his heart is singing. The man raises his eyebrows, glances over Sherlock, glances over the car, then glances up at the flat.
There's a knock on the window, and Sherlock pants at the dashboard. He’s coming down from the shout and realising there's probably a constable just outside his window, ready to scold him for blocking the road. But it's not a cop. It's a man with a beard and sparkling eyes and slicked-back hair, wearing a suit that Sherlock likes much better than his own, even though it probably cost a fraction of the price. The man is looking amused, which takes Sherlock off-guard, because... well. Most people would be frightened, or annoyed, or defensive, not amused.
"Always something. Allies?"
He’s interrupted by a waiter, who comes by to ask about wine; Charles orders the most expensive glass of champagne with a voice meant to carry to the next table, then John glances at Sherlock and orders them both a moderately priced red. James, red-faced, is hastily scanning the wine menu when John speaks. “Do share our bottle?”
per say, but it was enough that it could be heard through the thin ceiling of the sitting room in the still hush of two am Baker Street. Sherlock glared at the ceiling, bow in hand. John’s rhythm was all off; he couldn’t play when the sounds clashed.
“Do you mind,” he gasps, “sharing my starter as well?”
John is the one to gently ease Sherlock to sitting, and from there into the shower. John strips without a hint of embarrassment, but Sherlock hesitates, shy. John steps forward and gently begins to undo his buttons.
"Oh?" the man says, voice still mild, still amused, but this time the amusement is making his eyes crinkle as well. "And here I thought it brought out my eyes."
He hands the bottle back, laughter dying slowly as he manages to swallow, eyes gone dark as he watches John’s expression go mild again. “You’re infuriating,” he tells John, who raises an eyebrow.
“All right.”
He pauses, waiting for the man to give him the expression that says he regrets this, but instead the man just turns to put the kettle on. “I’m John,” he tells Sherlock, rummaging for tea and a mug, asking him, “This one clean?” and smiling at Sherlock’s nod.
John considers this. “How much were you going to spend on the suit?”
polo,” John giggles. Sherlock blinks, unable to frown because John looks so pleased.
“I don’t know,” he admits, which is a rarity.
“A hunch is not proper deduction, John,” he says instead of
“There are snacks in the small cupboard under the sink,” Sherlock says quietly, overwhelmed just at the presence of the man — John — in his kitchen. He feels like he’s dreaming. “You can use the telly, too. Is there anything else —”
“Conditioner?” he says. It comes out like begging, and he’d blush but he’s far past embarrassment now. The low chuckle above him absolves him of guilt anyway.
John laughs and goes for his wallet and keys. “I think I can manage that, in a city with this many chippies.”
“My company, Holmes, has been my
A moment later he realises his mistake as deft hands sink into his curls, sending sparks down his spine, and he’s eye level with John’s cock. John’s fingertips brush his scalp, and Sherlock wonders how he survived without this, even as his mouth waters at the sight in front of him.
“Just breathe for me,” John urges gently, putting a hand on his chest to feel his lungs. “That’s it. Easy now.” The hand makes his heart stop and then restart as Sherlock sucks in air, then releases it in a gust.
“You found it,” John said, several days later, “Or you must have found something, because you’re much less crabby now.” He smiled at Sherlock.
since I was younger than you, young man, and I’m not at all sure a poof–”
“How so?”
Though that could be the acting required to keep such a job, Sherlock reminds himself. It’s only a week, and it’s paid work. He’d be a fool to forget it.
“Yes, well. It’s been a while since I was in practice,” John says, but Sherlock knows he’s worked recently, even if he can’t put his finger on how he’s deduced it at the moment, because Charles has started talking again.
The soft sound of a zip, and then he’s drawn forward again, the scent of John intensifying in a way that makes his gut drop and his blood sing. He parts his lips automatically. The guiding hand draws him in, softness brushing his lower lip, and he’s moaning, taking John in his mouth with a shudder. His hands come up to clutch at John’s trousers with white-knuckled desperation as he figures out how to breathe through his nose, how to work his tongue and lips around John’s length.
“Come back by eleven?” he asks. John glances up from the dishes, making his breath leave again, because he’s beautiful, sleeves pulled up past his elbows and glasses on because he hadn’t wanted to bother with contacts for breakfast, hair glinting in the light from the windows.
Sherlock ends up focusing deeply on his work. He’s vaguely aware of a deep-scented waft of humid air, of padding feet around him, the clink of porcelain and the crinkle of a bag of chips. However, none of this prepares him for what he sees when he eventually lifts his head from his work.
“Supposed to be?” John asks, catching onto his distaste, and Sherlock sighs.
John opens his eyes when it’s over, lifting his head with what looks like an effort to look down at Sherlock still on his knees. He must look a mess, hair awry and chin wet with drool and come. He doesn’t want John to look. Instead, he carefully tucks John away in his trousers, tugging his handkerchief out and scrubbing his own face, pulling back to stand. He offers his right hand, the left still blistered and sore. “Sleep, I think,” he says, trying to sound casual, but his voice is cracked and dry.
When Sherlock explains the polo game, John begins to laugh. It’s beautiful, and Sherlock is distracted for a solid ten seconds just watching his eyes crinkle with his smile before he protests.
“Father, we mustn’t spend any more time with these hooligans,” he says, even as he winks over his father’s shoulder at them both. “Look at what they’ve done to your suit!”
In which there is a suit.
John, as it happened, slept with no shirt or vest on whatsoever, Sherlock discovered. The scar was on full display in the light of the outside street lamp, the ray drifting through the window like an errant and unknowing spotlight. Sherlock crept closer, making out the different lines of it, and sat on the edge of the bed.
The man faces him, unashamed, with that amusement still lingering on his lips, and nods. "Yes."
When Sherlock pulls back he’s red-faced, and he swallows. “I have a liver - an experiment - work,” he says, “But if you want to. Make yourself comfortable—”
"Coffee," Sherlock says, in panicked response, and whirls into the kitchen, as the man looks around.
, Sherlock thinks, and says aloud, “Chips. Anything greasy.”
“I-“ Sherlock says, and pauses, organising his thoughts. “I have a meeting,” he explains reluctantly, not wanting John out of his sight, really — but then has a thought. “If you’re amiable, would you mind shopping?”
John hums, not moving away before asking, “What are we doing today, then?”
John waits as Sherlock gets his breath back. John is patient as Sherlock stands on wobbly legs; he’s kind as he wraps Sherlock up in a towel and dries his hair (patting, never rubbing, his curls will frizz). Sherlock stumbles as he grabs the towel John used the night before (the faint smell of cologne) and tries to reciprocate the care. John seems to find this amusing, or perhaps endearing; there’s a twitch to his lips and crinkles near the corners of his eyes that says Sherlock’s done something good, anyway. Sherlock wants that expression to cross his face again, so he finds John a spare toothbrush, and carefully shaves and brushes his own teeth and styles his hair before darting into the other room, wanting to find John clothes that will work while he’s out buying a new set.
Sherlock reaches for the wine but then stops. It isn’t what he wants, he realises, and has a moment of remembering how James had looked at John at first, like he was seeing a dream come to life.
(See the end of the chapter for
For a moment, Sherlock’s offended, but then he catches on. “Oh,” he breathes, and blinks at John. “Obvious.”
“You’re blistering,” he says quietly. “It’s lovely. It is. But you need to stop before you bleed.”
John knows what he’s doing, but more than that he seems to know how to read Sherlock, taking each bob of his head slowly, gauging what Sherlock needs each time. Sherlock’s head rolls against the wooden back of the chair, trying to ground himself as he forces his hips not to writhe, but it’s so good. And the whole time John’s looking at him, those eyes fathomless as he doesn’t let Sherlock hide, drawing out pleasure after pleasure.
This time he can’t control the way his head drops forward against John’s hipbone. It’s warm and firm, and that’s expected — what’s unexpected is the length against his cheek, and he gasps.
John’s eyes twinkle back at him. “Is it?” he asks mildly, and stands, helping Sherlock up. Sherlock grins and pulls on his coat as John tugs on his own, and then he’s leading the way out the door with a twirl of his coat-tails.
“Fine! Try some other sound. There must be one that will make your brain relax a bit,” he grumbled, and Sherlock frowned.
“Of course,” John says, “Those curls will frizz without.” There’s a click — the conditioner bottle, Sherlock deduces — and then fingers are combing through his curls.
“Good night,” he says, politely, and Sherlock swallows, reaching for the light.
“Stay,” he says, and disappears, before coming back wearing the dressing gown again, and holding Sherlock’s toothbrush, toothpaste, and a cup to spit in. “Here.”
Sherlock knows he’s hard, the sight having made his cock strain at his trousers, leaving them distended and wet. John’s hands slide from his knees upward, and Sherlock’s thighs tremble once nervously before opening. He does want this, even if he’s not sure what this is. It’s already more intimacy than he can ever remember having. John’s eyes are steady on his, though, and when his hands move to the placket of Sherlock’s trousers, Sherlock only remembers to breathe out of sheer stubbornness that he doesn’t want to faint.
The man laughs. Sherlock feels better but continues, "Guess I have to get a cab," in a low mutter, "if I can even get this hulk of metal to a parking place." But the man smirks.
“Not now,” he says softly. “Let’s get you to bed.”
Coming back to is like waking up after a long dream. The condom’s gone, and he’s wiped up, his trousers still around his thighs, John’s arms around him. He’s drawn Sherlock closer, leaning him forward so he's slumped into the man’s shoulder, panting softly still. Sherlock’s trembling, in contrast to John’s quiet steadiness.
“I have suits,” John says, and Sherlock pauses, before flushing.
“I can do that,” John agrees, eyes going soft at whatever Sherlock’s face has done. Sherlock wants to hide, but also he wants to bury his face in John’s stomach and breathe and breathe and breathe until his heart stops feeling like a woodpecker has attacked his chest.
Sherlock scrunches up his nose. “I’m supposed to be buying out a business.”
Anyway, the point was, Sherlock wasn’t
It was several hours before Sherlock crept back downstairs, oddly lethargic, and went to bed, sleeping easily for once.
“If you get yourself some extra things for your stay,” he says, one hand grabbing the other before he can fidget, “I’d be pleased if you put them on my card.”
John nods again, setting the tea in front of Sherlock. “I’ll make my own when I come back out,” he says and disappears into the bathroom. Sherlock’s left sitting there, heart going double-time, on the stool in the kitchen. He does eventually pull out his liver and get to work, taking sips of the tea.
"It's an old friend. Well. I say friend. I mean. It's-" Sherlock waves a hand, tries to stand, and hits his head on the freezer door, clutching it instinctively as the man turns to him. Sherlock's mortified.
No tie, he notes, and traces John’s suprasternal notch with his eyes. The black suit is perfectly fitted, and the shirt is a gridded pattern, light blue. There’s a watch, practical and unobtrusive, sitting on his wrist. Bit loafers with a buckle in good taste are snug on his feet, black socks warming his ankles.
Blinking at him, Sherlock asks, “If I can?”
Sherlock bites his lip. “Same as mine?”
Bit shorter, but plot development has to happen sometime. :) Thank you all for reading and commenting. I was feeling nervous about this piece and the comments really gave me the motivation to get through the block I had.
“Sherlock,” Sherlock says, looking up at him. The man nods, meeting his eyes, brushing a curl out of his face.
John’s lips are parted, and his tongue flicks over them automatically before he says slowly, “Yes. You’re right, of course. Incredible.”
"Mhm," the man says. Sherlock’s already getting out of his car to shift to the passenger side, and the man steps back to let him out, then slides in as Sherlock's rounding the car. Sherlock knows his heart is racing. He knows this is insane, but he's already thinking of having the man up to coffee, he's already wondering if he's actually going to book a prostitute for the first time in his life, and he's actively pushing away the thought of what Mycroft would say.
Ah, Holmes. Sherlock always knows he’s in trouble when someone says his last name like that. He waves a hand, riding the edge of ‘camp’ and his normal behaviour. “It can hardly be that difficult,” he says blandly, and even James seems a little upset at his casual disregard, but Charles is puffing up, growing furious. Homophobia is such an easy trigger point, Sherlock muses, as Charles’ chest expands like an accordion played badly.
“I — do you —” he tries to offer, but John smiles gently and shakes his head.
"Twenty quid and my cab fare back to Soho, and I can get you and the car to your place in one piece," he says. Sherlock looks up at him, deduces him quickly, and snorts.
Sherlock nods, blinking hard at the shirt in front of him, suddenly tired and upset and hoping the man will leave soon so he can cry and feel like an idiot without an audience.
“You’ve been here before,” Sherlock observes. It’s a decently expensive place, rather nouveau riche for London but in one of the newer buildings by the Thames; as a result, even the more traditional gentlefolk have decided the place is acceptable for the sake of the view. John’s admiring it as Sherlock speaks, and he glances away from the window to smile at Sherlock.
Sherlock hung up his coat with a huff and turned to screech on his violin while John made tea. John sat, drinking it while Sherlock’s sounds grew more and more irritable and higher and higher pitched, then set his cup down.
“This suit is going to need a thorough cleaning and a press, I’m afraid,” he says, as the wrinkled fabric parts to reveal Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock isn’t thinking about the suit. He’s thinking about how it would be so easy for John to spread his fingers over Sherlock’s skin.
“They’re all too busy vying to defend their own positions to really look at the talent offered,” he says, “Insecure, the lot of them.”
Sherlock turns to the waiter only to find that John is already talking to him, gently assuring him that it wasn’t his fault and the champagne, glass, and wine will all be paid for, even though the manager scurries over to assure them they needn’t bother. Sherlock smiles, sets several notes on the table, and asks if it’s all right if they just bring the bottle home, as it seems their meeting has been unfortunately cut short.
"Need help?" the man asks, and Sherlock realises rolling down the window might be good because the man's voice is all blocked. He wants to hear it better.
“I think it’s wonderful, helping people,” James says, sitting without taking his eyes off John, whose smile is slightly tight. Sherlock doesn’t know why.
“Mr McCarthy,” he greets, offering a smile and the title, even though Charles has left off any sort of formality by addressing him as “Sherlock.” He’s older, assumes that he’s allowed to address anyone as he likes, but he’ll throw a fit if Sherlock calls him Charles.
Sherlock looks at his other hand, pausing. He’s right; the fingers on the strings have worked through their callouses again. Outside it’s dark. He doesn’t know what time it is. John’s showered, beard trimmed, in a robe over his clothes.  A while, then.
internally. He blinks, then realises how small-minded he’d be to assume John was gay rather than bi, or pan. Of course, perhaps he was straight and simply “gay for the pay”, but – and Sherlock’s not experienced, but he’s not stupid either – John doesn’t suck cock like a man who’s forcing himself to do it.
“Eyes closed,” John says, “I don’t want to get soap in them.” Sherlock complies, shuddering, lips parting, and John murmurs quietly, “Lovely, Sherlock.” There’s a soft whine on the next pass of John’s fingers, and it takes Sherlock a while to realise it’s coming from him, as he tilts his head into the palms of John’s hands. The part of him that’s paying any sort of attention to his surroundings notices John’s slow breath and wonders at it but then lets it go. The fingers in his curls don’t hesitate, lathering the shampoo and leaving him moaning at the massage to his scalp.
“I don’t do kisses on the mouth,” he says, “But what else would you like?”
He is losing himself in memory and the shadow of Death that hovers at his shoulder, and Sherlock is consumed with the desire to help him, and he can think of nothing else.
Summer billows warm and rainy into London and Sherlock wakes to realize that six months have passed since the accident.
“And for once that will serve him well.”
Sherlock blinks. The man is wearing an oversized wool sweater that smells of mothballs, of coffee, of fear. Fear. For him? Perhaps. He dismisses the thought as irrelevant. What matters is that sweater; it must be winter. Winter. Sherlock takes a moment to turn the word over in his mind. Winter. The ideas of cold and grey swirl into his mind. Winter. But London is always cold and grey, he thinks next, and then recalls that
“Tea,” Mycroft replies, “would be delightful.”
Why does he care for him so unconditionally?
“What changed?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. Turns away. Says:
Almost—not quite, but almost—gentle.
John grabs his shoulders, still chuckling, and kisses him. Just on the edge of the mouth. Hardly a kiss at all. But Sherlock reels away, bewildered. John beams.
“Shut the fuck up, Anderson. You can’t talk to him like that.”
A final interval of silence in which Sherlock can hear his heart beat as clearly as a drum. Finally John shakes his head. And then he is smiling.
“Do stop with these dreadful pretenses and just ask him to the cinema already.” He smiles indulgently. “At this point we all know that the government signed you to be in charge of this madman’s adventure, and we simply cannot imagine what we would do were you not here to kick us around.”
The woman slumps in relief, but the other man does not seem pacified. He advances, takes a fistful of the black satin suit, gives a shake. Even gnashes his teeth. No one seems to notice John.
“With a little help.”
“Thank you,” says John.
He drowsed one afternoon in a pool of sunlight. His head was pillowed on his mother’s lap and her fingers were in his hair. He dreamt ideas, amorphous shapes and indefinite colors, nothing tangible. At some point the dreams broke into a rainy afternoon. An older boy was shaking him over and over. His face was fat and flushed and his wispy ginger hair was dark with rain. Frightened and confused, Sherlock acted on his first impulse. He bit mercilessly into the boy’s hand. Blood flooded his mouth. He felt nauseous. The boy howled.
He glances to the side as if there were something there. Someone bending over him, whispering in his ear. An impenetrable expression crosses his face. But it only lasts an instant; he looks up again and his eyes are clear.
No. He’s really there.
John is just as happy. They hold hands in the back of the cab and his pulse is steady and content. Sherlock wants to tune himself to the consistent rhythm; he is as nervous to return to the flat as he is eager. Mrs. Hudson did him a great service over the past two days; now this favor rests heavily in the jacket of his trench coat. John has forgiven him. John kissed him over the hospital bed and tasted like stale coffee and relief. But Sherlock cannot forget the old man, and although it is not like him to become so attached to material symbolism, he fingers the little box through the silk lining of his pocket as if it were about to disappear.
John looks down at the woman’s neck.
Sherlock meets his eyes. “Was that alright?”
While Sherlock is bound to his bed, John brings him tea, coffee, books, his laptop, anything, whatever he asks. He tolerates complaints and he tolerates erratic periods of taciturnity and he does not ask for thanks. If Sherlock talks, he replies, and does not flinch when Sherlock returns with cutting fragments of sentences. Several times, when he thinks Sherlock is asleep, he smoothes back the hair from his forehead with a startlingly tender hand. He forces him to eat. He laughs.
Sherlock finds John back at Baker Street. He is oddly gratified to see how well he fits in already. It is curious to see him perched on the sofa with a cup of tea at his side and a medical dictionary open on his lap, in his socks and shirtsleeves as if he had lived there his entire life. He instantly seems to belong. He even looks at home. Sherlock turns this over in his mind and finds it to be as mystifying as it is pleasant.
John shrugs. “Showing me, I suppose.” He runs a hand through his hair. “It’s all very interesting, and you trusted me enough to show me…me, of all people. But in any case, thank you.”
“Sherlock.” John’s voice carries that curious scratch again. Sherlock is still not entirely sure of its meaning. “Sherlock, what -”
“And what do they plan to do with the patients?” John takes a deep breath. “What do they plan to do with the people who haven’t shown symptoms yet?”
“It won’t be like this forever, you know.” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “How silly to think that things won’t change eventually. She can’t drink forever.”
“You’re overreacting.”
“I suppose it does not even require saying,” sighs Irene after a time. “We both know what has to be done. You’ve seen the numbers. Even just in the past week. It multiples exponentially every day. We can’t afford it anymore.”
And into his neck, like a prayer, like breathing, the younger boy tells him:
The shadow of a smile touches Sherlock’s cheek.
And Sherlock Holmes, whispering:
“I’m not scared.”
“Her name is Harriet, but we all call her Harry,” sighs John after a time. “And I might add, Sherlock, that at times I think that I should never hope to understand you.”
? Sherlock cannot catch himself in time.
No. He can’t fall in love with John. No matter how much he longs for it. He knows John loves him too - he’s already said it in countless tiny ways – the loyalty, the quiet secret smiles, the tea - and sometimes it’s tempting, the idea of having him for even just a little while. But Sherlock knows better. It would be a gift to love John honestly and wholly. But he can’t. He would break if one day he woke and John was just another face. He can’t be alone again.
Now Mycroft smiles: a cold, slender thing.
His old voice slinks back. The younger boy’s nostrils flare. What—no. No. Don’t slip.
Molly nods and trembles from the room. The man hesitates at the doorknob, glancing back uneasily at the hospital bed. He is obviously grappling with indecision. What troubles him? Sherlock feels parched for want of knowledge.
At first, it’s worse. They get a case, so Sherlock is happy, but the ride to Baskervilles is loaded with silence; with John’s unspoken, crackling jealous grief; and with Sherlock’s lacking—of response, of anything, or maybe it’s just confusion, whatever he makes of it, who knows. Then there’s a bed and breakfast, and a room with one bed, and that’s terrible, that might be the worst moment of it all, and then, for a little while, it’s okay. Or not okay, exactly—it’s just nothing, because they can’t exactly think about it because, well, there’s a fucking hound, a fake hound at first until suddenly it’s real, until suddenly they’re sitting by the fireplace and Sherlock is telling him it’s real, and John is laughing until he’s serious, and then he takes the scotch out of Sherlock’s trembling hand and says hey, hey, hey, let’s go back to the room if you’re going to yell like that, not expecting him to agree because Sherlock never agrees, never follows John, never, but then he
Three days later sees them on their way back to Baker Street. Sherlock is eager to see the flat again, this time with his memory returned. He wants nothing more than to run familiar eyes over familiar books and furniture and peeling wallpaper, and is positively delighted by the fact that he can finally explain the bullet holes and yellow spray paint on the far wall.
“And that scares people,” he concludes at last. “Ordinary people.”
“Classified,” he replies unhappily. He would like John to know. In any other situation he would have explained. But not now. It cannot be now.
He wakes in the flat. John’s at the foot of his bed. At a glance, the wallpaper is two tones lighter. Sherlock exhales and gazes at the ceiling. John glances at him; a shade of worry lifts from his brow. But he looks away. Sherlock sits up and the sheet pools at his waist.
Sherlock does not buy groceries. John knows he eats—tea, toast, several strands of spaghetti at Angelo’s—and yet. No groceries. So John buys groceries. He hates buying groceries. He didn’t always, but ever since he got back from his tour, it’s been hard. He would get takeaway or something for the microwave or he would just forget to eat. He had liked cooking before, but there was just no strength for it now. Paleness had a funny way of doing that to him, making him feel like the smallest things (brushing teeth, tying shoes, chopping onions) would really kill him, once and for all.
And then, with a crumpling at her brow:
Sherlock Holmes is fluid. His eyes close and his mouth slackens out of its strange forced mold and his body melts. The sharp edges of his suit fade. His wrist bends and dips and arches to the tempo. Lean ribbons of notes. Strong and tenuous. They stretch thin and curl together. Never breaking. Hush now. Pianissimo. Then crescendo to nothing. It is Vivaldi sobbing from the delicate arc of the bow. Winter. Cold and tentative, and yet Sherlock warms to the sound, or perhaps the sound to Sherlock, if that were possible. Is it? John doesn’t know. He can only sit enraptured as the music wraps around him and binds his hands and feet and sets his heart to beating madly as if trying to start a duet.
“Thank you,” breathes Sherlock. He doesn’t know what else to say. John chuckles, and looks away. He’s happy. And that’s worth it. Even if Sherlock wakes up the next morning and he’s gone, it’s worth it. John’s happy, and it’s all because of him. He doesn’t understand it, but it’s worth it. It’s worth everything.
Death is at his shoulder.
The irony therein is hardly lost on Sherlock.
That night John takes pains to illustrate the portrait of Sherlock Holmes as he understands thus far.
Sherlock lifts his chin into the air. “It’s a medical report.”
“But…” Sherlock shuts his eyes, opens them again. “I’ve stopped myself from feeling things before. For my work. For my—mind.”
One corner of her mouth quirks upwards. “You’ll be good as new in a few days, Mr. Holmes. It’s my job to help people with pain, you know.” And with that, she whirls from the room.
is where he lives.
Angelo rolls his eyes. “Joking, joking, of course.” He waves a hand towards Sherlock. “The man is married to his bloody work, so don’t go getting your hopes up, sweetheart.” Yet another wink. “Thanks for stopping by, you two. Hope to see you again.”
“Sherlock,” he says tentatively.
If that’s the real reason he comes to 221B the next day, well. He has nothing left to lose.
It was only little details up until then. Tiny things – the pattern of his wallpaper, the color of his pet canary, the way his violin tutor applied her lipstick. Nothing important. He barely made note of it. It was so forgettable. He assumed it happened to everyone. Later on he would learn not to make that kind of assumption. It’s dangerous.
Later—when she’s dead, when the flat is quiet, when the mournful strains of Sherlock’s violin ease into nothing (he’s never played like that before, never so sad, and now the strains that once existed, that brief unbelievable evidence of his heart, those strains ease off into nothing, nothing)—later, John sits and does not drink the tea he made, and feels gnawed at from the outside in. He doesn’t have to lift his shirt to know it’s there, green, spreading around his navel thick and blooming as if from broken capillaries. Like storm clouds, like the sickness of a sky before it shudders apart.
Mycroft stands in the foyer, stiller than John has ever seen him, and leans on his umbrella.
There must be a red dot trembling on Sherlock’s temple, too.
“You can’t do this—God, look at you. You can’t live like this.”
“I know.”
“Recall that I work for the government itself, Anderson.” He wipes his hand on his trousers. “So do you, in case you’ve forgotten. They’re well aware of our activities. So do forgive me for not quite cowering before such a threat.”
you, God
“He said he was sorry for…misapprehending me.”
Sherlock pauses at the doorframe. “You mean to imply that you sleep in this place?”
“Not from your suicidal ideation, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
The kitchen is small and cluttered, but John believes that is how a kitchen ought to be. A set of slender glass test tubes sits on the counter. There are a few unwashed mugs in the sink. The kettle rests on the backburner of the stove with its metal hide still gleaming from lack of use. Sherlock walks a few circles in the middle of the floor, bangs a couple of cabinets, makes a fuss about the refrigerator. John tries not to smile. It is so obvious that he never uses this room.
No—empty. Nothing. Nothing at all.
, his agonizes, why? Why does he share this flat with Sherlock? Why does he look at him so carefully, hesitantly, sometimes gently, sometimes angrily?
Silence falls. Sherlock tries not to think about the meeting with Adler. He distracts his mind with silly games, naming all the capitals of all the countries in the world, identifying every specie of tobacco known to man, counting the creases in John’s face. One for every death. But this particular game rapidly devolves into simply observing John. He has opened the medical dictionary again and every once in a while flips a page, but he is still not really reading, the absent flicker of his gaze betrays that much. He is thinking. He is thinking and Sherlock can nearly hear the rhythm of his thought, slow and measured, such a contrast to the racing and erratic tempo of his own mind. How strange that they get along so easily.
“Not at all, not at all, not at all.”
Sherlock gazes at him for a long moment. John does not shy away even though his heart stutters beneath such unyielding concentration. An eternity seems to pass. Sherlock breaks away. He smiles slowly and shakes his head.
Holmes does not seem impressed. His upper lip curls in disgust and he gingerly plucks the other man’s hand from his lapel.
“I know.”
“I just wanted to see what it was like,” he says. “I’m sorry.”
“To rent another flat would be…prudent,” he says at last. “My brother is many things, Doctor Watson, few of which qualify—according to most, naturally—as, how might we phrase it,
John shakes his head. “Don’t do that. It’s my fault, too. We’ll get the hang of it.”
“Not asphyxiation,” he says at last.
John flinches. “That was rather straightforward of you.”
Sherlock shrugs and dares to press his lips to his neck. John stiffens in his arms.
“Oh, for Christ’s sake,” says John, and turns back towards the kitchen.
Sherlock’s eyes gleam and in an instant they become colored chips of glass. It has been so long that John has nearly forgotten they could look like that. Sherlock grips his shoulder.
That afternoon the rain was a curtain, silent, indistinguishable from the air except for the faint ripple of light off the water. It had descended silently to soak though their clothes and now the roads were fluid, the color of the milky coffee his mother left out on the kitchen table for him on Sunday mornings. Mud clung to his trousers. He and Molly crested the lip of the hill that coursed down onto the countryside. The path was a flood of cloudy water and unhinged clods of earth. Molly stopped.
A tenuous moment of silence, then they both laugh harshly because they know she has asked him to achieve the impossible. She runs a hand through his hair again. Her fingers are cool and dry. Her palm curves to fit his cheek and he cannot help but lean into the touch.
And Sherlock turns from the window and meets his gaze, and John realizes that, for the first time ever—in their entire lives, he imagines—Mycroft looks like he might not know, exactly, what’s about to happen next.
He does not buy groceries. He does not cook.
And because John will do anything Sherlock asks—and because he also cannot ignore the feel of Sherlock’s unuttered
The hospital is another one of those dreamlike realities, just like the ones produced by the amnesia. Hard colors like white and silver blur soft at the edges. Juxtaposition. The voices of the nurses are gentle. The whine of their heels against the tile hurts his ears. There is the stifling reek of antiseptic, the cool dry palms of the doctor as he turns Sherlock from his cot onto the examination table. There is the biting cold of the stethoscope against his chest, the dull pain of the injection in his arm. Ointment wet against his stomach. He drinks a cool liquid. There are voices. The rush of water. Exhaustion tugging at his arms and legs, morphine sucking away his consciousness.
always wondered, though,” says Sherlock eventually, because he is Sherlock, and he hasn’t changed, not fundamentally, he’s just a little brighter, and therefore he must wonder, always, and John loves him, loves him. “The excess color, that used to make me so sick. When I feel something now, where does it go?”
His gaze is acute. Things it rests on: the morning (not-sand) cleanness of John’s skin, and now the back of his neck, where self-awareness flushes. Eager—oh, hell, like a victory—to reveal itself. Between them, the warehouse echoes.
Blue. Thanks to special effects, it’s everywhere in rom-coms these days. Still, when you see it up on the screen, a part of you knows. It’s not real. Not really real. There something’s missing. Something else. To make it really, really real.
Sherlock shrugs. “Leave them.”
Sherlock regarded teachers with disdain – he regarded most things with disdain – but Irene was clever. She analyzed every student to the bone and liked to tell secrets in a singsong whisper. Sherlock did love her, but detachedly. He never once entertained the notion of acting upon it. He was too brilliant for school, but Irene made it bearable. She was a challenge, and he didn’t want to ruin that with something as frivolous and capricious as feeling.
However, at the moment there are more pressing matters to be resolved. John stares blankly at the television. He looks sad again.
John makes it to the doorway. Sherlock nods, turns to go. And then John goes stock still. Because there. Beneath the blood drying on John’s knuckles.
Actually. Probably not.
Reality is continuous, and it is malleable, and yet it cannot truly be changed. Sherlock traces events, changes, faces. He thinks it over for hours and hours. He begins to understand it. There is no prior dream, no indefinite dream, no inception. It’s all the same once you look past the details. People, things, hearts – it’s just a web of symbolism. A story with the same characters every time, only in different scenarios.
The world remains nebulous and strange, and John remains the lone anchor in the murk of the dream. Sherlock wants to breathe him in like cigarette smoke, to touch and taste him, to absorb the unique tangibility that is John. He finds that his hands wander; his fingers dance over the bumps of his spine, the dip of his lower back; they linger too long at his wrist, trapping the frantic metronome of his pulse. John occasionally asks what’s gotten into him; more rarely, he returns the touch, smoothing the curls back from Sherlock’s forehead or letting their fingertips bump together for an instant. But he is always wary, as if Sherlock might shatter to bits beneath his hands, as if the jagged fragments might dig into his skin.
“Alright.” He puts his hands on his hips. “I believe you are. Thanks, anyways. I’ll go get somebody right now and put this out of my mind.” He glances up and his eyes are gentler. “Good luck with whatever t is that you’re doing, I suppose.”
“Don’t be such a child.”
And with that, the older boy’s mouth melts into a slow, bending smile.
- but that morning, he stays. His fingers wind into Sherlock’s hair; he opens his mouth; one hand drops to the soft spot at the brittle curve of Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock feels dizzy. The light outside the window weakens; rain sings against the roof. He is breathless; that must be why he feels so desperately compelled to inhale John.
The series of deductions falls into place effortlessly: John is his husband, so Sherlock consented to marry him. Therefore, he was quite in love with the man. The idea does not seem impossible; his mind wastes no time worrying over sexuality (merely chemical, that), and John is not unlovable. However, it soon becomes obvious that they are not an affectionate sort of couple. John does not drop kisses on his cheeks or forehead, only sugar cubes in his coffee, and he looks alarmed when Sherlock smiles at him one morning over his mug.
“Alright,” he says simply. “I believe you.”
Of course he is being sarcastic, but he is also right, and Sherlock gets the impression that they both know it. He shifts and reaches for a slice of garlic bread. John stares unabashedly as he bites down and chews pensively. He swallows conclusively and closes his eyes.
But every so often he seems to condescend far enough to take coffee with John in the office. He can usually bully a nurse into procuring the stuff – he has a curious effect of them, something reminiscent of a cold breeze blowing through a flock of doves – in a tall mug, just as he likes: black, with two sugars. He then proceeds to march smartly into John’s office, take an authoritative seat before his desk, and pepper him with questions. Usually these are related to medicine. Nearly as often they have to do with the little girl.
Their relationship is simple. They wake early. Sherlock might find himself nestled into the crook of John’s shoulder, breathing against his skin, or John pressed into the hollow of his chest, his hands curled on his ribcage. More likely, however, they are on opposite sides of the bed, enjoying the singular peace that comes with familiarity. They know each other too well to be uncomfortable with separation.
John applauds.
Molly flutters past for the umpteenth time. Her lipstick is smeared and her hair is a fright and the collar of her shirt is drawn erratically across her collarbone. Her chest is heaving. She is more agitated than the others. No good reason. He sneers at the test tube.  She should know better and he tells her so just as she races for the far door of the lab again. She skids to a halt.
He can feel Sherlock looking at him, but he doesn’t want to see his expression. Surprise? Disgust? Pride? Gratitude? Or nothing, nothing at all? John clenches his hand shut, glad that the crimson curl of anger (deep, bright, righteous, beating: like a heartbeat, with a heartbeat, anger beating with a heartbeat) burns safely on the inside of his palm—a secret still.
“Not my intent, but I won’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”
His mother died in his second year of uni, long after Sally changed and cocaine lost its charm. They gave him a leave and he went to the countryside. Mycroft prepared the funeral. It was a fabulous affair. Rivers of black taffeta, silk flowers, eddies of guests swirling about with lace handkerchiefs. Sherlock was revolted. He had never warmed to his elder brother, and he spent the reception in his old room, drinking champagne that tasted like metal and staring at the acrylic stars on the ceiling, the skeletons of rats and mice on the desk. His things, but no longer his. He saw the work of the dreams. A mouse replaced by a vole, a new constellation at the western corner of the room. His childhood had changed. It no longer belonged to him.
He will not leave London.
“We don’t have to, I’m sorry, I thought you wanted—”
, hissed between his teeth when John asks), and so in the morning when John goes to the kitchen and puts water in the kettle and toast in the toaster and watches the toast pop and looks at the two slices, he thinks that Sherlock can have them, the first pieces of toast which usually John prefers, because, well—less for the life itself than for the reminder of it.
And then John is holding his wrist and feeling the jumping of his pulse.
“I admire her very much,” says Sherlock honestly. “But I love you.”
The man practically spits. “Of course she bloody well informed me! You may have forgotten, but despite popular opinion, I’m actually the head of this operation, not you, Sherlock.” He gestures furiously to John. “Explain yourself.”
“Very well, then. As you like.”
“Splendid,” says Sherlock.
“Nothing more than what I’ve told you.” An easy lie. He was prepared. John seems to be thinking. And yet there is not a trace of panic in his expression. Sherlock is flabbergasted. He does not understand. John lets go of his shoulders.
A dreamlike week of travel. The helicopter cuts through shimmering heat waves, sails high above ragged snowy mountains, finally slips back into the cool grey envelope of the European sky. John wakes to find himself in Heathrow. He takes a cab. Military blockades, small fires that send shivering fingers of smoke towards the sky, occasional spatters of gunfire, screams of shattering glass, flickering eyes of citizens who daren’t so much as dart from their homes to fetch the newspaper. He is stunned. He cannot even speak. Death is rather pleased and gloats in the silence.
They stand there for an instant, an age, two lifetimes wound together inseparably after just a month, and is that what they have become? John grits his teeth. Best not to wonder. Sherlock was right. Don’t count the what ifs. Of course he was right. Don’t look back.
“Thank you, John,” interrupts Sherlock. “Thank you so much.”
Silence for a moment, fractured by the whirr of the monitoring machines and the labored come and go of the young woman’s breathing. Finally, the man shifts forwards.
“Of course I am,” he replies. “I always am.”
John shakes his head. He is not sure why Sherlock is apologizing. They have forgotten that they are standing in the middle of the clinic.
John takes the ring. “You’re not down on one knee.”
And with that he sinks back into the grimy glow of the restaurant. John gazes warily after him. Sherlock meets his gaze and raises an eyebrow. They are silent for a long moment. John snorts. Sherlock’s upper lip trembles. And then they both dissolve into helpless laughter.
Sherlock’s eyes flit to him, narrow.
After Irene, everything is the same. And yet, something changes. It starts. And this time, well, it doesn’t even matter to John, how it starts. It starts. It starts.
“No, I’m not. Never have been.”
The little girl smells like ash and gunpowder and old rain. She needs a bath. John gives her to Sarah, the only nurse he really trusts. The girl cries out and reaches for him, but he hushes her and Sarah puts a hand in her hair, strokes it back from her forehead with a murmur of comfort. She glances at him and he dips his chin. The instructions are understood.
Artful detectives and villains as they are, they strike up a conversation before getting down to the business of death. They speak evenly, only raising their voices to be heard over the ragged come and go of John’s breathing. Sherlock knows the game well; in fact it is predictable until Moriarty turns and saunters away. For once he is dumbfounded, but has no time to wonder before he is tearing at John, ripping away his coat and the explosives, reassuring himself that he is warm and alive, clutching at him even as he plucks at his sleeves and gasps not to be so frantic, it’s alright, they’re safe.
She squeezes his hand, rolls over. Turns out the light.
Sherlock chuckles sadly. “Of sorts.”
Fingers dance down his spine. Lips press against his jaw, his throat, his collarbone, the dip of his navel. The world is real; John closes his mouth and the world is blindingly real. Sherlock feels his back snap from the mattress. An unborn gasp scorches his throat.
John is stunned to see that the owner knows Sherlock. He booms and claps him on the shoulder, and ushers them over to a choice table in a secluded corner. He even deposits a little candle in the center of the red checked cloth. John shrugs out of his jacket and hangs it on the back of his chair. Sherlock straightens his cuffs and rests his chin atop the steeple shape he makes with his fingers.
it. Sherlock, I. Breathe, breathe. No no no. It’s alright, John tells himself. It’s the truth and it’s all I have and it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright.
Most people salute when they first encounter the fox who lurks behind the British defense of London. They sway and stammer beneath the thin artful curve of her lip and the cool glitter in her eyes, and then return to their barracks to entertain astonishing fantasies regarding what is hidden beneath her green canvas uniform. She is a beautiful woman. That much Sherlock will admit. Perhaps even clever. But he never saluted. He never swayed. He never stammered. And he certainly never entertained a fantasy. Nowadays he bows, and when he returns upright there is an artful smirk balanced on his lips.
afraid.”
His orgasm is raw and razor-sharp with reality. He cannot keep himself from clutching at John, digging his nails into his shoulders, pulling him down, as he fades back onto the mattress. He just scrapes together the decency to return the favor; John shivers into his shoulder, his name falling from his lips to shatter on the pillowcase.
“You’re being illogical,” he says smoothly. John sighs.
“I don’t want to believe this any more than you do,” she croons. “So to contradict myself, why don’t you think about it for a minute? How would it have gotten out?”
Adler leans forwards. She balances her chin on the ball of her palm. Now she is a cat, arching her back to get a proper look at him. “We?”
Summer trickles away through their outstretched fingers. They solve cases. They scour London and come home to watch crap telly and hold hands on the middle cushion of the squashy old couch. They stay up late into the night analyzing evidence. Usually they are very efficient, but every once in a while they remember how close they are standing and fall into each other. Then the cases take longer to solve. It is worth the trouble.
“How was it?”
“Right, that changes everything.” John is surprised by the poison in his voice. It is a new thing to him, this core of bitterness from which it wells. He wants to say that with or without Sherlock there is no one on earth who can guarantee his safety, namely because he wants to fucking die. But he thinks Mycroft might already know. “If even
“You’re upset.”
“I’ll drink to that,” says Irene dryly, and they laugh unhappily because they’ve already had too much. They fall silent. A final question hangs between them. The air grows thick. At long last Mycroft gives a terrific sigh.
At around half past six the landlady marches into the flat. She is an aged woman but the line of her mouth is strong and proud. John introduces himself. She smiles and shakes his hand and prattles on about how lovely it is to finally meet him. Finally? But before John can ask she jams her hands on her hips and declares that he and Sherlock must be very hungry. In the end they have no choice but to agree and five minutes see them bundled into a cab to dinner.
They met some time ago. They shared the flat on Baker Street. This was back when John walked with a cane and was reluctant to join Sherlock. His leg improved and his attitude changed. He smiled more often; he went through some number of girlfriends. They were never married.
“It’s alright You’re here now. That’s all that matters to me.”
There is a nightstand and a lamp, a closet, plus an armoire and a bookcase poised as silent sentinels at the door. There is a small bathroom off to the side. The wood floors are cool. Unthinkingly, John goes to the edge of the bed and sits down. The mattress gives with a sigh of relief. He presses his palm into the sheets. Sherlock watches him. Sherlock always watches him. Sherlock watches everyone and everything. But do his eyes not come to rest on John a little more frequently?
“But I thought I wasn’t included in
John sighs. He cannot bring himself to care. He picks up his pen and returns to his paperwork. Sherlock lingers until the lights of the clinic begin to flicker out. A nurse leans through the door to John’s office and asks whether Sherlock is coming. He nods absently. Just a minute. A pause.
John rolls his eyes, but he is impossibly grateful. They don’t say anything much in particular as they head down the stairs and step out onto the street. Or at least they say nothing of importance; they don’t want to. Dusk bruises the horizon blue and purple. The indefinite colors of night begin to stain the streets in places, but the fires in the alleyways are no longer lit and the shadows are still. The air is cool and soundless. They both fall into a respectful silence on reflex alone.
Manipulated? Sherlock gives a terrific roll of the eyes, as is quickly becoming evident that only he can give. He mumbles something about an elder brother. His upper lip curls, so John forgets the subject.
“Our work is fatal, Sherlock. We’ll die out here. You know it, and so do I. That’s alright. It’s preferable, in the end.” He flexes his knuckles on the railing. “But I can’t help but think that…oh, Sherlock. What if we never get the chance?”
He got a detective job. He was good with details because they protected him. He was cold and abrasive and mechanical because when you’re already strange, nobody thinks twice if you’re extra strange one morning because you can’t make sense of the world anymore. It was his life. It still is. He has to protect himself no matter what.
Later that night, John gets Indian takeaway; he’s eating curry and flipping through the telly when he comes across a rom-com, something recent, trite. Sherlock would hate it; there’s barely plot enough for him to spoil. But John pauses; he doesn’t know why. Or maybe he does. It’s the confession scene. And there it is. Technicolor, technicolor blue.
“So to speak.”
He wakes and scrabbles for his gun; he sweats and curses and does not cry. He lies there breathing and tells himself about the shadows of his flat, tries to shut his eyes as he feels the slow sink of reality. John Watson, Afghanistan. The ache of his shoulder, his leg. Sand. John Watson—not Afghanistan. Anymore.
His leg doesn’t hurt.
Everything becomes too much, the roar of a thousand words, the sting of a thousand more. There is no peace in the darkness, not from the deductions and the data and the
The mystery murderer falls, Sherlock whirls around, and John ducks. His heart is beating in his throat, but he’s grinning as steady hands slide the gun back into his waistband. He hurries downstairs, stops. Forces himself to walk calmly the rest of the way, take his place casually in the crowd of bystanders.
It takes nine years before John dies again. It is a far more memorable death, for all the worst reasons. For one, while still an accident, this death is not altogether accidental. The car that clips his bike

heading home; something that is still a strange concept, having a place to go that holds neither drunken relatives nor ridiculous amounts of sand. Then one second passed, one moment where he pauses to readjust the Tesco bag’s handle and to curse the name of one milk scrounging consulting detective, and the next there are two men trying to jam a needle into his neck. There’s a scuffle, because there’s always a scuffle when burly blokes assume that mild-mannered-jumper-wearing-
Sherlock pulls a gun,
or if this is it. He finds he doesn’t mind either way. Moriarty grins at him wildly underwater, which flickers uncertainly as John wraps his arms around the criminal mastermind. John grins wildly back. The bomb jacket detonates.
It’s at 28 years old, standing in the heat of the desert sun with a gun in his hand and a purpose nestled between the bandages in his bag, that John Watson dies for the third time. In all honesty, he’s surprised it took this long. Captain Watson
Now, for all those people who were looking forward to seeing what happened after the explosion: I'm sorry that it wasn't in this plus 1. The pure poetic vibe that "5 times john dies for Sherlock and 1 time he kills for him" was too good to miss. But... If y'all are into it... I will be addressing those events in a funky sequel called "Five times Sherlock lived for John and one time he died for him".
The leg still hurts.
This death stays with John the longest. Nothing, and he means
. The cab he sits in has come to a stop, and John is sitting beside him. There’s concern on his face, ash in his hair, and there’s a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
He’s killed a murderer two days after meeting Sherlock.
As a child, Sherlock’s particular brand of strangeness was easier to pass off, slipping through the cracks in the guise of being just another ‘troublesome’ child. His strangeness was still strange, however, and while disregarded by adults, children have a certain capacity for cruelness hidden within them. They did not like weakness, hunted it in fact, could smell it seeping from the pores of the quiet and the peculiar. Young Sherlock Holmes, who had not yet perfected the art of masks and shields, positively
Pale blue eyes, glazed over with the film of death, stare unseeingly up at him. He’s soaked through, chest concaved, bone peeking through skin and cloth. Red stained, slick, blood and viscous dripping from the controlled destruction. A hand, his own perhaps, brushes wet hair back from a pale and cold forehead.
John Watson is going to go quietly. He manages to dislocate a shoulder here, break a nose there, and squeeze out one final quip before they get the better of him.
