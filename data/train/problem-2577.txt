It took a second of lag, but finally he gave Dean a sad, sidelong glance, frowning slightly. Dean narrowed his eyes back. "Cas, don't think that just because you're not an angel anymore. You're still Cas. Did you think I would just..."
They weren't able to make that their main concern, because surprisingly enough, quadruplets were a huge handful. There were all sorts of things that the humans had to consider when taking care of infants of powerful creatures.
"Give him hell, Cas. Put in a little something for my mom." Kevin spat bitterly, beginning to stand up roughly too.
He whipped to the source of the noise, his eyes widened. He saw an employee, leaning on the stick of a mop, she was smacking her gum and looking at him in annoyance from her heavily made-up eyes. "Sir, ya open it, ya buy it. Sorry, no exceptions."
"You can sleep here with me as often as you'd like, okay?" Dean offered. "Especially if we're sharing dreams, anyway."
"You're not a weirdo." Sam said firmly, hugging him tightly this time. "You're different from your brothers and sisters. You're going to be much stronger than them."
He could tell, even with his eyes sealed shut, where exactly Cas was. He was sitting next to his bed, outstretching the bowl for him, he knew exactly where he'd be if he were to reach out and touch him.
"You're reading my thoughts again." Dean grumbled unhappily. "I thought we agreed on privacy upstairs."
"I'll...uh..I'll go get them. And some food." Kevin's footsteps disappeared, and the fallen angel sighed.
He closed the door and stepped a few feet over to Sam's door. He felt his heart squeeze as he heard a very wet coughing coming from inside. Dean felt he had a lot on his shoulders to take care of these two men, his brother and his best friend. At least they were both here, in the same house. Didn't mean his job was going to be any easier.
They finally pulled in to the CVS. "Just, wait here, okay? Just try and calm down. You seemed pretty shaken up back there."
Dean moaned softly into the pillow beneath his cheek, his hand clamping down into a fist around the sheet. Cas was a unique lovemaker, he’d sometimes go off on monologues just like this, his voice rumbling soft and low in his throat. He’d never been influenced by all the fake shit that came from porn. He was just... himself. No walls.
The biggest grin split his face as he walked back to sit down and eat his breakfast. "You're an idiot, Cas."
He searched for a few minutes, searching every room and finally finding him outside. Castiel was curled up, sitting on a root of a tree and hugging his knees tightly, keeping his eyes squeezed shut.
Dean finally smiled. "Cas, this is...this is actually really sweet." He laughed. "But I mean, isn't it kind of..weird to have them call you 'Father'? How about Dad?"
"Okay, okay." Dean laughed, and his laughter turned into small wheezes. "I kinda just wanted to see what you'd come up with." He licked his chapped lips and extended his hand, his palm opened, to the end of the bed. Chuck took it and squeezed softly, bringing it to his lips and giving a soft kiss to the back of it. Wait,
"I thought you said there were four of you." Bobby said through his teeth to Tobias. "Well, where the hell's the fourth?"
"Okay. Maybe we should clean up before. Trust me, you don't want to get sick. One of the worst things about being human."
"I know, I know. Sorry. Just wondering if you'd like to bring him over later, you've already got your hands full with the little ones, huh?"
The angel pressed two fingers to his forehead quickly after flying the five feet or so in half a second. Dean slumped against the heavy iron door, his stomach letting out a hungry gurgle and groan. "Oh, Dean." The angel huffed, kneeling down to snake his arms up under Dean's armpits and drag him back to the bed.
"You sure we don't need baby vitamins or something like that?" Dean asked awkwardly as they sat in the car.
"If it's not him, then who else should do it? Not to sound all sappy, but Cas is the only angel I trust." Dean pressed his lips together. "We'll just have to..really step in and help him."
"Sorry." Dean ran his hand through his hair nervously. "It's..it's okay. We, uh, we should go tuck in the kids now."
"Cas, wait-!" Dean yelped as he almost shut the door. "I have a couple sandwiches in the fridge, Cas, I am
The house still had dried-up pools of blood staining the floor from when the Steins had been massacred. How could he forget? He'd been the one who'd really done it, after all.
Almost immediately, the angelic functions that Cas usually kept in check for him began to reveal themselves. Dean's head began to pound as more and more details began unfolding, overwhelming him with overstimulation.
"You lost conciousness. I brought you here." Chuck said, his eyebrows drawing together in concern. "Chuck is also a vessel to a powerful angel whom I won't disclose right now. He took me in. Temporarily."
"We didn't. I just made it up." Dean smiled. He clapped Cas on the shoulder, being careful to avoid his back. Cas got a startled look on his face, his eyelids flying wide. Cas felt Dean's hand gently squeeze his shoulder, he didn't realize how tense he was. "Cas. Take a deep breath, okay? Everything's going to be okay."
The man stopped mid-word. He suddenly seemed a little woozy as he reached up and touched his head, his eyelids fluttering. "Oh.
Dean again smiled. "I like that, Cas. A unique name." He indicted to Bobby in his arms with a small nod. "What about him?"
"Don't overthink it." The angel mumbled very grumpily as Dean began to feel the sensation of Cas next to him fading away. Dean chuckled at how what he had said inadvertantly related to what he'd just been thinking about and he closed his eyes, just feeling his warmth.
"It comes with this life." Sam continued. "A Hunter's life. We can't avoid it. But we can do our best to heal from it- and Cas will, Jack. Your treatments have already helped. Sometimes we just need to be patient."
"Leoniel! Wake up," Cas said dejectedly, plopping his hands into his lap. He stared at him sleeping for a second and then scooped him up, barreling past swaying Sam and Dean and back into his bedroom.
"Y'know,, if you let me go, I could cook all kinds of food. Way better than this American crap. I'm talking rich, Scottish dishes. I've heard I'm a mean cook. You didn't think Gordon Ramsay learned all that on his own, did ya? It ain't called Hell's Kitchen for nothing!" He raised an eyebrow mischeviously. "Eh? How about it?"
"G'night." Dean whispered when they'd pulled apart. His nose was still lightly touching the angel's, and his lips had broken into an easy smile. "Love you, Cas."
Dean had to smile. It was nice that someone out there, even though he'd only met him once, caring about him and his family.
," Chuck breathed, his face flushing in embarrassment as he felt what the angel felt. "This is..uh, this is intense. I mean, I wrote about things but I..uh...experience is...okay, wow."
He was getting more information that he ever thought imaginable. He usually only saw the happenings of good ol' Sam and Dean, but this time, he was seeing everything.
"Is that another...family member of yours?" Dean asked, realizing how awkward the question was. How do you politely ask if he's naming another angel after someone he'd killed?
Chuck didn't respond at first. Finally, he choked out the next word. "Cas," His word was choppy and forced. He unfolded his arms and met the ex-angel's eyes with his own weary blue eyes. "I am not your father. Not yet. I don't know all the answers to the questions you wanted to ask me. Sit down, Cas, please."
Cas grumpily nodded and shoved the egg from his lap, much too roughly for anyone's liking, as Sam shot out to grab it. He was rushing away before anyone could comment on it.
Dean had been screaming, his foot coming up and planting in the middle of his bathroom door, his thigh muscles screaming as he kicked as hard as he could. His heart skipped a beat when he saw Cas slicing up his pale forearm, red blood had dripped to the floor and his face, God, his face was so damn pale and white as a sheet.
He listened as she hummed her tone-deaf songs as she cooked breakfast, today it was bacon. Yesterday it had been french toast. Karen really was the greatest cook.
Sam dropped the two pieces of white wood he was fiddling with and set his full attention on Cas. "You think.
Cas tipped the shard to a different angle than the scissors he'd used the other day. His wrist was still purpling and little dotted scabs like tiny garnet gemstones still riddled in horizontal lines, like little equals signs all stacked up on each other.
"Okay, guys." Dean began to round up the two of them, who let out little 'aww's of protest. "Time to let your brother rest."
Dean peeked into the cabinets, calling out for Cas."Uh, we got plenty of cereal, some canned stuff like beans or soup or something, 'course, I could cook you the good stuff if you want. You want that?"
, Castiel repeated the name as a manta to himself once again as he limped on, panting, each footfall kicking up a talcum powder soft cloud of the soot layered thickly on the ground.
"Crap," Sam sucked in a breath and rubbed at his eyes, pushing his hair back and away from his face. "I guess time got away from us."
"Yeah." Sam felt like an idiot, but he had to say something to break the cold ice forming between them.
Let me tell you why prisoners are put into solitary confinement. I was all alone in the dark with nothing but my thoughts about everything I've done in the past few years.
"It's good, Chuck." Dean finally smiled but didn't realize he was. "They were unexpected, of course. But not unwanted. Never unwanted. I think I'm falling in love with them."
Tobias looked nervous. "What were we supposed to do? There's only five angels in existence right now, and Metatron's one of them." Bobby was surprised when the young man shot out his hand and gripped Bobby's wrist.
"We saw the demon Crowley, he was some kind of hostage. But he disappeared soon after he was dumped. By the
Dean pressed his lips together in thought. "Well, I don't want to have to redo all that. And the cuts might sting if it has water pressure on it. I'll just run a bath." He decided, and indicated for Cas to hop up off the edge of the tub so he could reach the knobs.
Cas nodded and slipped his eyes closed. "Dean." He mumbled in a gravelly voice. He felt one of the fledglings press and wiggle closer to his side, where he felt a lot of his energy begin to sap away. "I don't know what to do now."
"Okay, Crowley." Dean huffed and spoke up. "I guess you're wondering why we even brought you out here."
"Hi Bobby," The young man said, smiling and shoving his hands into his denim pockets. "Sorry if this is a little weird for you. My name's Tobias, and-"
"I'm sorry I'm being a nuisance." Cas lowered his head in shame. "When I slept as a human, all I had were bad dreams and nightmares. Maybe if I tried something different they'd stop..." He sighed softly. "I'm sorry I didn't say something earlier, and you made that whole bed for me."
to." Dean said, and everything clicked into place. "Oh, Cas. I'm sorry. I didn't think it would do that."
like a little kid in the way that he didn't have as many night's sleep as an adult, and the uncertainty of giving oneself up to unconsciousness scared him still. He wanted to feel safe.
I'm going to finally put all of this up after a long break. Sorry to make you all wait so long! I hope you like the rest of this story :)
Chuck rattled out a sigh. "I know, I know. That doesn't add up. And if all these angels really are my..children..." He got a little pale in the face, and an angel who had been in the room rushed to his side and put a hand on his shoulder. "Are you alright, sir?"
"Fine, Sam." Dean plopped down on the edge of his bed. "When I found 'im he had this..egg, whatever, and he hasn't left it for a second, even when I gave him a ba-" He cut himself off, quickly, mid-word.
"Oh, hell no. Cas, this is too creepy." Dean said, hugging current Leo even tighter on his lap. The future twin was only there for a day.
"We should try for just a couple more hours," Dean replied, suddenly realizing how tired he was. "We can both hit the gun range tomorrow morning."
The girl opened up her gaping maw with a loud, wet peeling sound and Dean felt his stomach turn at the cultivation of bacteria festering in her mouth, on her tongue, in the thin fuzzy outlining of whitish plaque on her teeth. God, when was the last time this girl brushed? This morning? Then, he realized where this mouth was going.
"I was not thinking that this was going to happen to me." Cas answered. "I was never of a high enough rank to receive fledglings. I don't know if...if that's for a reason.
"No, Dean, we are not naming an archangel 'Bobby.' " Cas had to smile just a little. He finally looked down to the tiny face, which was nestled into the light blue blanket. A chubby, uncoridinated hand opened and closed. Cas stared at him and the fledgling stared back with light blue eyes. His nose was tiny and button-like, his eyes wide with surprise as tiny lips, shiny from drool, puckered like a little fish.
The first sore, reddish and irritated skin that had started to peel away in a circle to reveal the tender skin underneath, like a blister that had been torn off. It was on the side of his face just above his left eyebrow.
Cas dug a pinky finger in his ear in irritation. He held tight to the smooth surface of the egg, his fingers beginning to tremble.
Dean slipped underneath his warm covers on the opposite side, and it was roomy enough that it felt like he was sleeping alone.
Kevin looked extremely uncomfortable as the three Men of Letters sat on the rug in the living room and watched as God cried his eyes out.
"Okay. You can come with me to go on a little grocery run for the house, get some air. Kevin," Dean pointed at the kid, who straightened up, his dark eyes bright. "You're the man of the house while I'm gone, okay?"
"Well, why not?" Dean asked, that had surprised him. Chuck looked a little bit like a puppy who had been kicked.
Well, for the most part the two of them got along. But this was one difference that Dean couldn't stand. Cas had close to no sex drive, and was damn near asexual. It was driving Dean up the friggin' wall.
He felt a strange pinch in his throat. He'd only felt this emotion a few times since he'd occupied a vessel, which he'd come to know as the moment before warm saline leaked from ducts in his eyes. It was not a very pleasurable sensation and he hoped he could avoid it this time. He finally leaned off of the door and rubbed his hands down his cheeks, the uncomfortable pinching in his throat beginning to go away. He turned around to bring Dean as much food as he could from the kitchen.
The man saw my expression and dropped back in disbelief. He looked speechless, before he took his hand from my shirt and sprinting away.
"חיים חדשים" She breathed in Hebrew, the only human language she knew since coming to Earth a long, long time ago, the angel of children was one of the few graced with preparing for Mother Mary's birth.
I usually spent my time with my eye to the small crack in the door, watching. Sometimes I saw someone walk by or Kevin spread out his papers and work.
"Dammit." Dean growled as he gently touched one of the thick scabs, earning a sharp intake of breath from Castiel. He dipped a cup into the bathwater and brought it up to the man's soapy hair. "Close your eyes. Tight, Cas."
"The night the angels fell...I was able to find one of my sisters in her time of dying. She told me it was new life, I promised to protect it." He said quietly. "I
"..Stupid books about monster hunting that only a few people even read.." He continued. "I don't even have a
A strange, animalistic growl was building in the back of Dean's throat and his teeth were gritted and bared. The angel submerged two fingers into the mix of bloods without so much as a cringe and began to swirl them together. He brought his ruby glistening fingers up and began to slowly paint a sigil on Dean's chest.
Dean huffed out some air and made a very pitiful excuse for a laugh. "That's..yeah, Cas, that's great. I'm happy for you. Awesome."
Jack listened to the two brothers arguing, muffled through the wall as he let the tears seep out onto his pillowcase.
"Ah, shit- kay, shirt off." Dean swung his legs to the side of the bed at sat, watching as Cas slowly began to work to untwist each button. Dean swallowed, and trained his eyes on his nightstand instead. He was
." Cas seemed frusterated. "When I ask what an item is, assume I wish to know its function as well."
"It's called a rattle." Dean explained. "It's a toy. They shake it around, it makes noise. I don't know, babies find it fun I guess."
That put a warm feeling in Cas's chest. He bent his neck down and kissed the little forehead of one angel and then the other. Dean covered his mouth with his palm and tried to not let any of his very un-manly sounds leak out.
"You're such a dork," Dean said softly, looking away. "C'mere." Dean grasped at thin air as Cas pressed his lips to his, a fleeting brush of his lips.
"Sorry, little monster. You got white ones, and remember the saying?" Dean prompted, lifting an eyebrow.
The one playing on the old spinner was a smooth, jazzy song that crackled through the phonograph. Kevin was busy trying to locate his mother, he was in the room and trying to call relatives and friends and try to see if anyone had seen her. He told Sam and Dean that he was going to leave to be with Mama Tran if he found her, and that he would make sure of explaining his findings from the machine before he left.
Dean was sleeping deeply on his side, one arm crooked under a pillow as the warm light from the lamp on Cas's side spilled over him. The handprint scar on his jutting shoulder was glowing softly from underneath the skin, the brightest pink at the middle of the palm and fading at the fingers.
The room was stuffy and Cas smelled bad, like soil and body odor, but Dean didn't mind. He kind of got where Cas was coming from when he watched him, curled up like a cat: knowing he wasn't in any danger, that he was just
"Shh." The angel's calloused thumb gently smudged the stubble on his cheek. He gazed at Dean, a deep sadness tightening the features of his face. Dean could only peer back with half-hooded eyelids. "I know. I was there when Rowena completed the spell. You are not to blame for this."
“Don’t hide from me, Dean, please.” Castiel’s voice rumbled low, taking his chin gently between his forefinger and thumb as he walked with his knees and caged him with his body.
"Look, I know you don't really want to talk all that much right now." Dean said, coming up and sitting next to Castiel as he was sitting alone on the roof, cradling the egg as he looked down at the lights of the town faraway, the yellow dots from the street lamps were shining, and to the right it was swallowed by black, the dark woods.
Kevin was working hard at the table, but as the music played Dean had little Io and Red in his arms, swaying around to the music and spinning in little circles. The babies howled with excitement and squealed, erupting into giggles as he dipped them and kept spinning slowly.
"You've been nauseous for some time now." Cas piped up softly, looking a bit queasy himself. "Mainly because of your incredible food intake. I...came prepared."
"D-Did you just kiss me?" Cas asked, confused, his eyebrows pulling together as he looked up at Dean and brought two fingers to his lips.
"Dean, please. This position—" The angel's voice was strained. "I dislike it. I want to see you. Look into your eyes."
“Is this really the first time you…” Dean trailed off, looking down at Jack with a quizzical expression. Damn, he supposed that
Cas did not expect to be pulled into a giant hug, his cheek flattened to the pungent flannel on Dean's chest. Dean's big, square palms were pressed hard onto his back in a desperate hug. "Cas, just hear me out, okay? I..I know heaven is not a bad place anymore, and that it would be safe for the kids but..." Dean struggled with what to say next.
Even though it was obvious it hurt the man to talk, Dean had to keep pressing for information. "Crowley
Dean had to pretend he didn't feel a rush of nerves when Cas slipped into bed beside him a moment later and the mattress creaked. He didn't turn to look at him, but rather just reached out to turn off the bedside lamp with a faint click. Cas rustled to try and get comfortable, but at least the two weren't touching. There seemed to be enough space between them so they could just keep to themselves.
They finally left me out around three weeks after the flegdlings had hatched, but I was just guestimating.
"Good." Dean rolled the iron door shut again, keeping just an half an inch open in case Crowley had to warn them about the demons coming, and went his rounds to call the non-prisoners, aka everybody else, to have a nice, normal breakfast.
"Well...yeah," Leo joked back with a tiny sniffle. "You've got six wings. Put 'em to use and fly me there."
And while the young angels ran at Dean and Kevin's heels and tugged at the hems of their shirts, grabbing cookies and candy from the shelves and giggling and pattering around, the scene in heaven wasn't quite so peaceful.
"I've learned the nurses do this after blood donations. I don't actually know why. I think it helps?" Cas spoke calmly. He paused for a beat. "Is it helping? Dean?"
Dean was freshly showered and in his comfiest pajama sweats and cotton tee when he padded barefoot into the Library. His brother and Jack were both hunched over thick volumes at the long wooden table with green reading lamps. Jack's blonde head bobbed and snapped back up as he fought off his sleepiness. Sam was still and laser-focused.
"Chuck?" Cas reached out and helped steady him by the shoulder, as it looked like he were about to fall over.
..." Calcifer was singing at the top of his lungs, glopping shampoo into his hair until his blonde hair was completely consumed by an afro of pure white suds. He'd been in the shower cleaning off for close to fifteen minutes now.
It was actually pretty nice, Dean found himself thinking. Then, another thought occured to him. Cas was snuggling pretty tightly to him, so why couldn't he feel anything indicating he had any kind of genitalia? Was he purposely leaving it out as he manipulated Dean's nerves or whatever?
from, dada?" Leo ran a tiny finger over Cas's pink and puckered wing-scars, and Cas visibly shivered at the touch.
"You know I don't require sleep now that I have my "mojo" back." Cas protested weakly, complete with air quotes. Dean grinned at him and patted the empty side of his bed once again. "Humor me."
Cas came uncertainly up to the bed and trailed his fingers along the quilt, before uncertainly climbing on and laying down, his fingers laced together and resting lightly on his stomach. "I don't know what to do. It's never been, you know,
"Sam was not there when I got to you. I've tried everything to find him, and I...I can't. The Darkness, it hinders me somehow. I don't understand it. I can't heal, I can't connect to angel radio, flying is very difficult. I'm..."
"..Bobby?" Tobias's face fell as he quickly tucked his wings away and rushed froward, cupping Bobby's scruffy cheek in his palm. "Grandpa? Hey, you okay?"
"I don't know why you love bees so much, Castiel." He said serenely. "I know I created them to work. To pollenate and to create honey and to feed their hives. They follow orders from other bees, invisible scents in the air and maps made as bees dance. And they are perfect architects of hexagons. Such a strange shape to find in nature, isn't it? And they work until the day they die. So much work into something that does not seem very important to us." His voice was different, calming, poetic, different from the fast-paced clip he usually used, full of 'uh's and 'um's.
"Got it." Kevin said back, almost a little too quickly. "Well, I can talk about what I found at dinner, if you want." He covered up quickly.
He put up a finger for Cas to wait for one more second and pulled out the old silver thing, and he handed it to the ex-angel who took it into uncertain hands.
Tobias nodded. "I tried to understand time travel, I really did, but if you really want some science-y explanation you're gonna have to ask Leo. But all I know is that the timelines are basically set in stone. If I'm back here, everything that happened is already inevitable. So yeah, you do it. I just don't know how."
Jack waited in anticipation, his blankets drawn up high. He stared past the two lumps of his feet and imagined the door opening over and over, his angelic father stepping in with that signature hunch to his shoulders, until it finally happened.
"We don't tell people about this right?" Chuck said, a small smile on his face. "That was a little weird. To say the least."
"This egg is not an 'it'." Cas said, smiling a little as he looked down at the round, white object. "It's a..them."
Dean told him to make sure to wash his armpits, chest and 'nether regions' especially with the soap. Cas did not know what a 'nether regions' was, but he felt Dean would not appreciate him asking. So he just mentally made a note to clean everywhere well.
version of burgers.” Dean grinned at him. “I'm talkin' breakfast sandwiches. The greasier, the better.”
Dean rolled his eyes. "Fine. Let him finish eating, then throw him back." He led Cas to his room. "I'll lend you some clothes, Cas."
," He managed to say before coughing again, the coughs going so deep they turned into wet retches again. He was glued to one of the toilet stalls in the communal bathroom for hours, puking up his guts and his intestines writhed in pain.
"I don't understand that-" Cas began, dipping into Dean's mind to obtain the information to complete the reference.
"C'mon, Cas. It's almost eleven in the morning. Time to rise and shine." Dean nudged his shoulder again. "I promised I'd clean those cuts today, remember?" This earned an even more annoyed groan, and Dean laughed.
"Organize a revolt in heaven, I guess. Against Metatron." Tobias answered. "Oh..I can't tell you..that much about that."
His friend hadn't always exactly been reliable in the past. Not like it was his fault, though. Dean knew he
"Go to sleep, Cas." Dean said to the far wall. Sam was out there, and he needed their help. Dean tried to shove that thought aside and get some sleep. His missing arm burned again.
"G'nite, Dean." Sam stood up and met his eyes, and tipped his head to the side curiously. A cold flash passed through Dean.
"Oh, stop that." Tobias laughed as he felt the moisture wicking through his clothes and he rubbed Cas's back, grinning. "You're embarrassing me."
"Profound bond." Castiel finished for him, still confused. He didn't understand what Dean was trying to say, or why he was so nervous.
When he scanned the room he entered in light feet, nothing was giving out red flags. Cas was lying on the floor, just beginning to get up and rubbing his head.
Tobias offered to escort Bobby back to his personal heaven just to make sure he found it again, after the short meeting they'd had at the Roadhouse. Nothing much had happened except getting them all in the same place and explaining what Metatron had done. Then Red and Io left once again to round up more recruits.
Chuck's voice was a little more weary as he answered this time. "A little. I feel different. I can't really explain it...bigger, I guess. And my angels are acting very different towards me. Everything is fine, but I am having these..God, these weird blackouts.." Chuck shook his head a little, gingerly touching his forehead. "I'm fine, though. I have plenty of people here to take care of me."
Cas blinked drowsily at him. "Dean can I tell you something?" He asked, and for the first time Dean noticed the slight heaviness of his tongue as he spoke.
His eyes narrowed again, his jaw protruding angrily. "We're going to help you get better." Dean put his hand on his shoulder, and Cas avoided his eyes, staring into the fledgling's instead.
Chuck had spent a fortune to line his spare rooms wall to wall with new mattresses. But when he was fast asleep after a tiring day, most of the angels snuck into his room and slept on the floor in his room, or even on the bed with him if they were lucky enough.
It had been almost a month and a half of sharing a body, and that was when the first thing appeared.
name have you gotten yourselves into this time." He mumbled, going and getting his coat that hung by the door. The boy had been right. He
"Well, as I said, I've been housebond a little...I'm sort of running a kind of..uh, Angel Day Care if you will." Chuck answered nervously.
The crisp, scrubbed-clean, fresh-from-the-rain air lilted and combed through the hair on his head, and chilled the water that was brimming on the edge of his lower eyelids, making his eyeballs feel like tiny balls of ice in his skull.
"It would be permanent." The angel began, licking his lips. "It's...probably too intrusive for your liking."
"Who the hell are you?" Dean was the one who answered the door, scowling at the two boys on the front step of the bunker. He looked tired as hell with dark smears under his eyes. "Halloween's about six months away, fyi. It's a little early for trick-or-treating." He said irritably.
"You're preaching to the quire." Dean told him, smiling just a little and shaking his head as he pulled the next stitch out. Boy, did he know about healing. He'd probably gotten more nicks and cuts than any other human being out there.
"I don't know what could happen to them. We've never been able to find out in history." He ran his hand tenderly over the bright red hair again. "I'm worried about them."
," Cas hissed back. "And he would know how to open his soul for the fledglings to consume his energy."
"Alright, alright." Dean mumbled, folding aside the blankets and crawling underneath. Dean patted the sheets on top of the matress and Cas hesitated before uncertainly crawling on top and laying with a good few inches between the two of them. He finally wriggled a little closer and Dean felt a soft warmth as he pieced to his side, bringing his hand up and resting it half curled into a fist on the middle of Dean's chest.
"It was just a dream." Chuck tried to be kind, and the angel's eyelids fluttered as he gently smudged his cheek with his thumb again. "Go back to sleep. I'm just making you all a little breakfast." The teen nodded and let go, and Chuck finally made it out the door, looking back at the room. People were draped everywhere like they'd all just passed out after a crazy party. Chuck smiled a little. It looked like this every day.
Dean felt like he was saved by the bell as the doorbell chimed. Dean brushed of himself and went to go answer it.
'Red' was much smaller than 'Bobby' was, possibly because he was only a seraph. Sam pressed him to the open space on Cas's chest, and the ex-angel looked at him. Right now, the smaller fledgling was sleeping, so Cas couldn't see his eyes. But the wispy hair on his head was a bright red, and a floppy bright white wing was just barely in sight.
"Yeah, yeah." Dean rolled his eyes, roughly setting the plate down just far enough away so that the ex-(sort of ex?) demon would have to inconvience himself by reaching for it.
"I am very glad I found you." Cas whispered. There was that odd, honey-like viscous spread of warmth in his chest again.
Nothing. Dean looked at the girl, and could see the floaters in the orange vitreous body of her eyeballs through the not-so-black-after-all openings of her pupils. His head pounded. This was getting even worse.
enough room so that Dean wouldn't be touching Cas if he slipped back into his bed. And Cas wasn't going to be doing much moving around anyway, right? He and Sam would share the bed sometimes if the room came extra cheap. But, there had been too many incidents of Dean getting pissed because Sam hogged all the blankets and he'd wake up shivering, so they didn't do that anymore unless it was dire straights when it came to their money supply. So this wasn't a big deal, right?
Dean was exhausted. Even after a long dry spell, Sam had been sick again, Dean remained by his side as he coughed and retched with his head buried in the toilet bowl for hours. The smell of stomach acid felt like it was still lingering on his skin even though he'd changed into a fresh pair of clothing. He was just beginning to drift off to sleep when he heard his bedroom door creak open and he saw a soft glow of light from behind his eyelids.
"Cas's wings have been damaged over the years." Sam began, sauntering closer to the angel. Normally he wore comfy shoes around the house, but often when he stepped into a teacher role he broke out his nice shoes, his shiny brown oxfords. It was one detail Jack might have loved the most about the professor side of this dad. "You're going to capture them as they are now, and then we'll follow up again soon to see how they heal over time with your grace treatments. I want you to map them, track their changes."
"Shit, man." Dean looked up at him from where he sat, cross-legged, his green eyes widened at all the empty wrappers and jars. "This is, uh, not good."
Cas slipped on some swim trunks and Dean taught Cas about the bottles as he made sure to really scrub the shampoo deep into his hair to get him all clean.
"Alright, Cas. It's time for you to sleep." Dean chuckled. Drunk Cas was...well, he was interesting. "I'll see you in the morning."
Tobias looked trapped. He shrugged. "Uh, to be honest, Bobby, we never asked how you were able to do it. You just...I don't know, we just felt like you always know what to do."
"Shhh. I gotcha, Sammy. Take it easy. Take it easy, okay?" He managed to get him into the back and slammed the door, and gunning it out of the empty parking lot. It was cold, rainy, his clothes were plastered to his skin, his chilled hands were shaking as he gripped the steering wheel so hard if it were alive he would be strangling it.
The angel's heart pattered in his chest. "I love you too." He whispered back, his eyes shutting with shyness. Dean squeezed his hand again. The blankets rustled as Dean pushed his feet underneath and lifted it for Cas to slip under too.
"You're nervous?" Dean asked, feeling a little awkward as he poured on a little more pancake batter. He never was very good about talking about stuff like this.
"How you doin', Cas?" Sam asked cheerily, coming into the room. Cas lifted his head and saw Sam holding a bundle of mexican blankets. "Sorry, we kinda named him already. But I mean, just look at him."
...the glowing mass of dying, fading grace was calling to him without lips to speak with, a tendril of grace reaching out to him weakly.
He missed his eyes the most. His true form had beautiful eyes; polished black opal with shatters of pearly cerulean and neon greens and twinkling indigos. He missed his hands, pale and slender and unblemished. Jimmy's hands were stubby with wrinkles and ugly nailbeds. He missed his collarbones, which sprouted small little black feathers with sheens of purple and blue, spikes sprouting along the slender collarbones like a necklace.
"Didn't I tell you, anything anytime?" Dean began to collect the supplies, avoiding the angel's eyes. He couldn't bring himself to feel uncomfortable- it was too damn cosy in here, with the soft bedspread barely wrinkled and the soft yellow light of his lamp spilling out onto the both of them.
"Oh, stop it, you!" Dean laughed as he dried the other foot. "You better not make a fuss like this every time! Let me put your undies on at least!" The baby's kicking and squirming legs kept tangling in the cotton as Dean tried to pull on his tiny briefs. "Red! Stop being so difficult!"
excited to have kids -it was because it was the last thing that would ever tie him to being an angel. Without it, he was just a regular human.
"I don't know," Jack's voice warbled, and finally brought up the edge of his sleeve to press below his leaky nose and sniffed again. "I was just thinking about... how...
The first day he dragged me back here was the worst. Sam almost died the night the angels fell, and after Dean had done everything he could to save him I heard his heavy boots clunking along outside the dungeon, and he beat me up so badly I don't even think I woke up until the next day. Now, it was just the cold shoulder and general abandonment.
"Sorry for being a jerk. I don't..." He let out a big, nervous breath. Here came the confession. "I don't really mind, uh, sharing with you."
He squinted his eyes and looked at the product's picture on the huge, bulky box. A chubby little fat-roll armed baby was laughing and strapped into the little baby carrier on the front of a man, the 'hard working dad' on the box looking like the type to have just cleaned out the car engine and then proceed to make dinner. Look at that white-ass teeth smile. What a douchebag.
"Dean! I-me and and the other angels don't know what to do, I mean, Chuck..I think he fainted or something, like he fell backwards and hit his head and he's not responding when we're touching him or..shit, I mean, how easily can humans die again?"
The egg was basketball-sized, a pure, heavenly white shell that contained something that was possibly the most valuable thing in the universe as of now, the untouched grace of an angel child.
"Cas?" Dean opened the door to the spare bedroom next to Sam's room with a small squeak. He peered inside: just as he'd suspected, he'd needed to sleep. Cas hadn't even climbed under the covers as he was curled around this egg thing, his black hair spilling onto the mattress as his chest rose and fell shallowly.
Cas wearily looked out at the two of them, a gentle hand planted in the middle of the egg, gently pressing it and its carrier into his body. Slight dark bags were under his eyes, and his hair was greasy and tousled in every which direction. He was wearing the unimaginably ugly pajama pants Sam had bought Dean one Christmas as a joke, plaid with laughing santas and reindeer with pom-pom noses, and his cold blue eyes flicked from one face to the other.
“Dean?” Jack asked feebly, cracking open an eye to see Dean’s shadow tie something off, then a loud zipping as Dean crouched and came back into the two-person tent to sit by the entrance, and wrangle off his clunky hiking shoes that he called “trusty” and Jack called “stinky”.
"Cas, please." He croaked defeatedly, lying back down on the bed with a loud creak. Without saying anything, Castiel turned away and firmly closed the door. Instead of leaving right away, he found himself reaching up and lightly pressing on the door with the palm of his hand. He closed his eyes, and caught his breath for a moment. When Dean had been a demon, sometimes he had been so painfully like his old self that Cas could forget what was happening. He was very good at fighting things that changed him.
"Did it hurt?" Io asked timidly, crawling up next to Red, her dark brown eyes shining as she looked up to the archangel.
"Oh, I'm dead serious." Crowley said back casually. "Us demons haven't consumed an angel egg in eons. Heaven always kept them so far out of reach, so inconvient. Angels are really so powerful, and to consume them while they are nothing but pure energy- makes a demon almost unstoppable."
"..But, you two will come and visit me, right?" He asked timidly. "I know this sounds stupid. But I can't do this on my own."
"That's not how it would have worked, and you know it." Cas growled, coming a bit closer. "Believe me, I would have done anything in my power to find him. Like I said, this darkness hinders me. I could not locate him like I did for you." He gripped onto Dean's shirt. "And I could not let you die, Dean. Not like that." That was when Dean felt it- a strong surge of emotion, washing over him like a tide, and the foreignness of it made his head spin. Dean remembered the past few days like he had been in a haze, but he did remember now what Cas had said about the bond.
"Sorry. I got carried away." Dean chuckled. "Look, I don't know how much you can tell from me, but Cas, I...let's just say you're the one thing that keeps me happy in this more-than-shitty situation we got going on. I always sleep better when you're here with me, and..I don't know. Whatever we've got going, we'll just...build on it. Keep going. Sound good?"
"All right. Only because I don't want you getting up and risking tearing those again, okay?" Dean came back to the bed and folded over the blanket to slip under it. "So you let me know if you need something."
Cas cuddled with Dean again that night, scooping him up to be the little spoon, safe and secure with his imaginary arms wrapped around his chest and his non-existent legs pushed into the gaps and tangled with Dean's. Dean was very sleepy and almost under when Cas pressed a soft kiss to the nape of his neck. Dean was too foggy-minded with sleep to feel shock.
They worked on things with a shared body, figured out the mechanics. Castiel found out a way to leave Dean's conscious alone in the body, but he'd have to keep all the angelic functions in check.
, of course I'll be loopy. And I haven't eaten in like...three days!"  Cas almost began to doubt himself again.
Sam guessed that they aged around three or four times faster than regular kids, but that was when he looked at them as babies. At a month they were doing things three month olds did. At two months, they were acting like six month olds. Then things changed again. Aging catalyzed even more, and at seven months old they were already acting like four year olds. With them growing up so quickly, soon they were able to make their own energy, and they didn't have to go Chuck's house so often.
"I will stay." Cas replied. His own arms pressed reassuringly to the hunter's broad back. "I could never leave this place. This family."
"I thought so too." Cas took his hand and got to his feet, rubbing his head one last time. "Were you sleeping?"
It was hard to see inside the car, as the soot had blanketed all of the windows and the windshield as if it had created a miniature cave. Castiel squinted hard into the small pocket of darkness, and saw only one human being draped limply across the car's leather bench seat. The interior of the car reeked of blood, and as he watched the large garnet pool collected on the seat dribbled down the side of the leather to wick into the carpet on the floor.
Cas nodded silently, and eyed his bandaged forearm. The stitches were itchy and the cut was still stinging. Dean noticed and stopped bobbing.
Cas shook his head. "It's a slim chance, but it could be possible." He touched Bobby's eagle brown wings with the comb, and they fluttered slightly before flattening again.
Calcifer played cards with some of the other angels, they were betting with one of the little crafts they'd started; round and polished river stones that they'd painted on, colorful stripes or swirls or little smiling faces or clouds or polka-dots. Calcifer dragged the stones toward him like poker chips and threw the winning cards in the air in triumph. Angels brushed their teeth, knocking elbows with each other (and apologizing), pulled on comfy pajamas and racing to try and earn a spot next to Chuck, leaving the whole downstairs room with wall-to-wall mattresses unoccupied. They were funny like that.
Dean, I..." The angel buried his face in his hands. "I couldn't protect the two of you, and-I can't... I'm sorry, Dean."
Tobias slashed at an attacker powerfully, throwing his body weight behind it, gritting his teeth and smearing the flecks of silver off of his cheeks as he kicked the body off his blade. "What? I couldn't hear you over the sound of me being awesome."
Dean wished he'd invested in a pair of earplugs the last time he'd gone on a baby supply run. The three boys were wailing their heads off, thank God one of the kids was asleep at least.
"I can't," Dean rasped. Getting fucked in the ass while he cried about how his father raised him, wearing fucking makeup to boot. He couldn't show his face, not just to Cas, to let himself be seen this way was simply too much.
"No." Cas said. "It was a name I'd liked for a long time. When I was younger, when I thought I'd be given fledglings of my own. Before I knew my status."
Dean worked his fingers deep into his hair as he felt a little grossed out by the brownish suds that emerged. "It's okay, Cas. It's okay."
Crowley turned his back to him and shrugged, slouching and slumping on himself so that Dean almost felt a little bit bad. The chains connected to his cuffs rattled as he reached for the fork.
"Where are my fledglings." Cas demanded weakly, more in a moan than he would have liked, his eyelids fluttering as his head lolled to the side. "I need my Hope. Bring me my egg."
Crowley coughed again, a rough, rusty cough that had Dean shuddering. The chained man shook his head slowly. "I dunno." His voice graveled deep, sounding like little pops of sound. "All I know is they're close by. Haven't moved for the day."
"Dean, thank you." Cas gave him a small smile before going to rummage in the drawer. Dean mumbled a 'yeah, yeah' and slipped under his covers that were still warm from his body heat. The bed was big, anyway. Dean never really did sleep over on the left side of it in the first place.
Cas grinned and rubbed the little orange cat's chin, and she pinched her eyes shut and purred louder. "That's because the flowers weren't here before. My angels, well...they like to garden." Chuck said with a tiny smile.
"Dean," He called into the cracked door, leaning onto the wall for support as his vessel was still feeling slightly nauseated. "...Are you finished yet?"
Things had been so crazy recently, Jack didn't realize just how long it had been until he went through the motions again. Cas swiveled the armchair to face the bed and placed a pillow in his lap, which Jack planted his head onto while he laid down horizontally across his bed.
"Terrible twos and teenage years all rolled into one." Sam chuckled, slipped in a bookmark, and finally shut his book with a faint snap. "Who would have thought
"You doin' alright? It hurts less now?" Dean asked, tentatively beginning to spread the clear substance into the wounds. He noticed the flush was making the skin on the back of his neck a glowing pinkish, and his skin was warmer to the touch. It was kind of funny, Dean thought. Cas breathed in sharply but nodded.
"I don't know exactly." Cas replied, smoothing down the shell again. "But they're never only one. For example, Ana and I shared a shell." He sighed and cradled it closer. "I supppose I'm their father now."
Who was he kidding? He was Dean frigging Winchester. And that meant that all good things would always, goddamn
The ex-angel crossed his arms over the available space on his chest and frowned. "Did you get this for me as a joke? I am not seeing the humor, Dean." He said moodily.
Castiel had written that last part after having to leave the room, his vessel had started to react unpleasantly to seeing Dean finishing his liter of water and then go on to tip back the green-tinted liquid from the pickle jar.
"Oh, I don't have to rely on angels to bring me back to life, Bobby. I'm definitely not putting my life in someone else's hands. And I didn't die to come here." He answered, trying to reassure the old Hunter.
"I was jus' playing dress up!" Red whined, flapping his wings in vein and splashing water everywhere with his arms. "I made 'em look like Bobby's 'n now your ruining it!"
" Dean tried for what felt like the five hundredth time. "Please," He rasped, finally slumping against the shiny black car, Sam tucked into his arms.
"It does, doesn't it." Dean ran his hands through his hair. "And I sure as hell am not going to be making out with Chuck anytime soon."
"I just gotta clean it. Sorry." Dean wiped away the fizz and gently pressed pieces of gauze onto the line, winding around and around with brown ace bandage, holding the gauze in place.
Tobias came up to the bed and brushed a little bit of blonde hair from Leo's forehead. He was burning with fever, and Tobias frowned. "Yeah. He was wondering about you actually." Tobias smudged his thumb on his baby brother's cheek. "Are you feeling okay, Lee?"
"Cas!" He heard Dean's voice after a long solitude, breaking the silence, laced with relief. "There you are!"
"You've lost quite a lot of blood. When I finally got to you, I think you'd gone into shock as well." The angel paused and dipped his head in shame for a second, as if he were working himself up to say something. His tongue darted out to nervously lick his lips, and he seemed to be looking everywhere except Dean's eyes. "Dean, I...I just need you to know I did everything I could, and I tried everything I know. I couldn't fix it." Cas began reluctantly.
Chuck took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, running his hand through his unruly brown hair. "That's what all these angels are saying."
"Thank you for taking me in." Cas said softly. They stared at each other in complete silence for a couple of seconds, noses pointed at each other, Dean blinking and Castiel not.
tell Cas I taught you that one." Dean chuckled along, until their laughter died down and they both just listened to the hushing white noise surrounding them for a tranquil moment. The pattering grew gradually quieter, until finally the sheets of rain turned into just a drizzle.
"Oh, I..sorry." Chuck looked up, snapping out of it. He looked embarrassed to be handling their kid like that without permission. "Do you mind?"
"Hey, show me the scrapbook when you're done, 'kay?" He called out, but got no reply. Dean sighed and rolled his eyes, muttering 'Cas, bud, you're killing me.'
Sam was wanting to get much more technical than Dean immediately. He looked up at him like he was a specimen. "Do you remember anything? From when you were having blackouts?"
Cas decided Dean had enough on his plate taking care of three other men already. He wouldn't burden him with his problems.
He finally gave up and wrote the simple word down, ending the sentence with a moody final poke at the paper for the period. He put the pen down with a sigh. Of course, considering the last time he'd seen Dean it had been much, much worse, Castiel knew he still was not himself. Cas shut the book and gently ran his fingers over the worn leather cover. He sighed and put it back on the table, and folded his hands together in his lap for a moment just to think. Dean was used to working very hard to appear normal after the Mark, and he didn't seem to know about the trace amount of Darkness still inside. But if this infected most of the human population-
Castiel may be new to many human things, but Death was not one of them. It was one of the things new inhaibitants of heaven wouldn't shut up about for weeks after joining them. How, why, what it felt like.
Dean patted the car as he stepped out and closed the door. "Maybe we've just been getting cabin fever."
It was a tense moment before Sam finally came back, trailed by Kevin who was haphazardly toting a bowl of soup.
"Rude." Dean chuckled after him, lowering his hand. He looked over to the bed and saw that Cas had fallen asleep again, despite having just downed a cup of coffee. Sam was plucking the babies around him one-by-one to put in the crib, but Cas was curled around the smallest one with the black wings, Leoniel. The baby was wearing a light blue footsie with little clouds on it, his dark and downy wings sprouting from the slits Dean had gone through every pair of clothing and made. He was laying on Cas's tummy, and at first glance it almost could look like the black wings were from Cas.
"Oh, c'mere." Dean whispered, and indicated with a soft pull for Cas to move closer. Cas sighed and rested his temple on Dean's shoulder, letting himself be comforted. They were both quiet for a minute, the wind picking up a little. Cas shivered slightly; he was only wearing a cotton tee shirt and some boxers, after all. Dean's thumb traced a soft arc on Cas's shoulder where his hand was lightly gripping, and the tiny flutter returned. Dean was so warm.
Cas strode into the bathroom, his breath coming in quick bursts from his throat. He gripped his hair tight on the sides of his head, and saw the reflection in the mirror. His pupils were little pinpricks of black within a sea of terrified blue. His face had grown pale, his expression was tight and each panicked breath flared his nostrils.
“It’s beautiful.” Jack whispered, his eyes folding shut, sandy blonde lashes fanning on his cheeks. “It makes me feel... safe.”
"Io? Sweetheart, it's okay." Dean outstretched his arms, willing her to jump/flutter down into them. She had hidden herself well, and as her tiny face peered out at him her cheeks were stained with tears. She sniffled and dragged her hand across her nose.
Cas's stomach rumbled loudly. "I will be back for breakfast.." Cas said dejectedly, placing his hand on the little baby carrier as he left the room. Dean puffed out a sigh and flipped the pancake. Cas was a handful alone without throwing the egg into the mix, he was moping around and barely talking.
"Shut up, Dean." He moaned, licking his parched lips and pressing the icepack a little harder to the lump on his head. Dean realized that both God and Death personally have told him that phrase. Then he realized that his life was really freaking weird.
Cas was in charge of taking care of their developing wings and had to comb out the clumpy down at least three times a day, the little fluffy feathers that shed were literally everywhere and Dean sneezed at least once every ten minutes. Sam was on vaccumming the fluffy feathers duty and he got very mad when he saw the mound of silver, black, brown and white fluff on Cas's bed and all over the floor.
"I...told you I will have to learn all of this." He tried to say in his defense. He was embarrassed that when he had those lips on his, he had absolutely no idea what to do next.
Sam smiled faintly at him, a deeply knowing look on his face. God, Dean hated that expression. It was like he could stare into his soul.
Dean slowly opened his eyes. He felt like absolute shit, like he'd been hit by a brick wall overnight. He looked around, squinting in the bright light, he stared at the wooden beams of an unfamiliar cabin. It was now daytime, and a damn bright day at that.
Bobby was pulling the young man into a hug before he could even react. Tobias quickly reciprocated, wrapping his arms around his back and shutting his eyes.
"Okay, Cas. We'll figure something out." Dean locked his jaw and squeezed the steering wheel tighter. He'd been putting it off long enough, and Dean was worried about his kids too. But he wasn't quite sure what to do with the demon in the dungeon.
Cas hiccuped with a sob and didn't speak up for a second. "D-Dean..there's..something I need to.." He didn't finish his sentence before showing Dean. He pulled up the sleeves of the coat he was borrowing, revealing a criss-cross of vertical scabs and slits, blemishing his smooth, pale wrist.
"I don't mind the walk." He replied quietly, keeping his eyes straight ahead and downcast. Then, he stopped dead in his tracks, his head bowed.
"Here," Dean patted the side of the bed next to him and moved over, the bed squeaking slightly. "Sit here. I think I have something in my drawers."
"You really are, aren't you, holy sh..SAM!" He poked his head back in the house and gripped onto the doorframe as he leaned back into the house. "SAM! GOD'S STANDING ON OUR DOORSTEP!"
"A little," Jack yawned and stretched his arms over his head. "I think I read the same paragraph five or six times, though."
"I could..." Cas looked extremely nervous, and he was doing that thing were he looked everywhere but Dean once again. "I could, well, bind you to me. Our souls. Uh, together. Soul... binding. It would effectively burn the Darkness inside away, out...uh..." Cas cleared his throat, his lips parted as if he wanted to say something else, but he closed them again and let out an embarrassed huff.
She must have been one of the first to fall. Her grace had already dimmed enough from exposure to Earth for him to view it with his new human eyes, only leaving splotches of neon green behind his eyelids when he blinked.
The angel flushed very red suddenly at that. "Oh, well, I...Dean..." He turned away, fiddling for no feasible reason with the ice pack and little bottles of painkillers he'd set up on a bedside table. "It's...uh...."
Dean wrenched open the front door, and then the back, pulling Crowley out roughly and taking the bag off of his head.
Dean smiled as he looked down at the little girl sleeping soundly in his arms. "I can't believe I'm taking care of triplet friggin' baby angels. I never expected even one kid, and I just assumed they'd be human."
Red very gently hugged Bobby and pulled away. "I tried to make a surprise for you 'cuz I made my wings brown like yours but Daddy made me clean 'em off so they're not brown anymore."'
!" Cas was yelling and waving his arms, sprinting down the divider and barreling into his brother. The beautiful bum looked confused at how he'd known his name, somewhat wrapping his arms around him too.
?" Cas bit his teeth together. These were angels for God's sake, not your average southern trailer trash.
No reply, not even a gesture to show he'd heard. Sam's eyes traced down to what Cas was staring at. A dead raven, one shiny black wing flattened on the cement, and its head was smashed like a car had hit it, and it had probably flapped a few feet before dying on the sidewalk. A thin trial of ants were already marching to and from the dead bird.
Cas shook his head slightly. "Not...exactly. My grace is all there, it just feels...strange. It's being repressed." Cas didn't look any less worried. "Dean, some of this Darkness was still within you when I found you. That's why I put you into this room instead of your own bedroom. It's still inside of you, and I..." The angel finally seemed to break, digging his the bottoms of his palms into his eyes as he sat back down into the chair angled next to Dean's bed. "I'm at a loss, Dean. I don't have all the answers. I've
Chuck shrugged. "It was weird. I finally had a vision that wasn't of you two. I saw Metatron in heaven, he was stealing all the graces of all the angels. And he claimed
"I'm sorry, Dean." Castiel whispered defeatedly as he outstretched his wings to fly. "I'm sorry, Sam."
Dean groaned extra loudly and fumbled for his phone at his side desk by his bed, hitting nothing the first few times before snatching up his phone. He took naps literally whenever he could, now that the angel babies were restless, crawling all over the place, not to mention teleporting short distances and moving their toys all over the house with telekinesis.
At first, Sam had been sitting down with Bobby and giving him little toys to chew on, the baby's fists coated in shining drool, but when the kid began to make a fuss, kicking his legs wrapped in a cloth-like green footed pajamas, he scooped up the kid and began to move around a little too, and Dean started laughing at him and teasing, to which the younger brother teased right back.
Chuck kissed the little boy on the hair and sighed. "Oh...my little Gabriel...my darling little sweet-toothed troublemaker..." He pressed his cheek to Tobias's light brown hair and he tried to keep himself from crying. "I was gone for too long...I let such bad things happen to my sweet angels...my dearest children..." He hiccupped and a tear slid down his cheek. "I won't ever let that happen again. A few of my children are gone forever, but things are going to change."
childhoods, Dean!" Cas seemed hurt as he bit this out. "From the minute we hatch...we are only prepped to become warriors. Our 'stories' at storytime were about fierce battles. Playtime was playing with wooden swords and learning combat. No one was kind to us. No one acted like they
The angel smiled and finally lowered his arms, the very last streak of white had plunged into his body. He took a few confident, ambling steps, and he looked into the lake in the garden, the window to look over Earth.
be the one to call it that," He was still chuckling. "Well, to be honest, not that much better. I mean, I've come to terms with
All he cared about was keeping the broad-shouldered, heavy and gigantic little brother in his arms from dying, just keeping him breathing and his heart pumping. That was all that mattered.
Cas's stomach suddenly let out a loud, gurgling rumble, and his eyes flicked down to his belly, where he pressed the hand that had previously been resting on the egg.
"Don't be sorry, Cas. I get that you were freaked out about him hurting the egg." Dean tightened his fingers on the steering wheel. God, why in the hell was he even defending Crowley? Why couldn't he just throw him back into the world?
The woman sighed in relief. "There was a rumor- most of us thought you'd died! That you'd burned out Dean's body and were gone! And poor Dean looked so sad walking in here after a few days, we all thought..." She smiled at him and handed him the bowl. "It's good to see you boys are okay."
Dean pulled his hands off the baby and ended the call on his phone, slipping it into his pocket. Then he gulped.
"The energy drink claims it gives out wings. I believe it would not be that easy." He looked down at his feet and shuffled them a little like a nervous kid.
His pink lips were just slightly parted and pressed up to the pillowcase and there was a darkened splotch wicking onto the white fabric- oh my god, he did not drool on my pillow! Dean realized a little too late he'd been staring for too long. Well, it was probably payback for all the times Cas had creepily watched Dean sleeping, right?
"Cas says he's really sorry he got puke on your favorite jacket." Dean recognized Chuck's voice immediately. "He also wants to tell you that's he's okay."
..." How could he have been so selfish? Why did he have to do that all before they were almost here?
Hot tears spilled out of his eyes, stinging with how fast they'd started. Jack swiped at his cheek quickly with the back of his hand and sniffed back the trickling feeling from inside his nose. Cas's warm arms surrounded him once again, and Jack pressed his leaking eyes into the tan collar of his trench coat.
Hundreds upon thousands of the dead surged against the barricade in heaven, screaming ripping through the air, the walls crumbling, angels rushing back into their home as well as some of the dead.
They were both like green bananas when they first started this. Dean topping, always giving. Back then, Cas had never had sex before, and Dean was more than happy to take the lead to teach him. But really, Castiel was the one teaching
Dean chuckled at that, with these dense volumes it was known to happen. "Alright, kid. Enough dead trees for now. Off to bed. Cas is already there to tuck you in."
Calcifer didn't respond. His jaw had dropped and his mouth was hanging slightly open, his face had drained of blood and had gone pale.
Jack averted his eyes. He hated to be reprimanded, especially when it came from Castiel. Dean's tone was kind of just Like That.
In fact, Cas seemed to be the only one not that phased by the tiny babies. Sam and Kevin had these bright smiles on their faces, and Dean was doing that thing where he was trying really, really hard not to put that loopy smile on his face either.
who he was, that was enough to have Chuck slowly but surely begin to return to his old self? With his old memories?
"Yes." Castiel replied. "It's nothing compared to all that was stuffed inside of you when you had the Mark, but it is significant. I think I know of a way to..." He trailed off, looking unsure that he really wanted to say the next thing. His eyes flicked nervously to meet Dean's.
I'm letting you get away with this." Dean flicked on the lights in his room and padded to his bed in the middle of the room. He waved vaguely over at his dresser. "PJs are in the bottom right, make yourself comfortable."
The dark-haired man hesitated before nodding very slightly, and finally moving slowly from the doorpost and down the hall, his dragging footsteps making little shuffling noises.
"I don't know if I should bow down or sit down." Dean laughed nervously. Chuck propped his head up with palm cradling his cheek.
Dean nodded back, his hairs making a faint scrubbing noise on his pillow. "We'll find her, all right?" He rubbed his thumb in a slow arc across the back of Cas's hand.
Cas sat for a moment and tried to regain his breath. Dean flipped onto his stomach and searched under the covers for his hand, and when he found it he squeezed reassuringly. Cas squeezed weakly back.
"Dean," His voice was more of a raspy growl, as he ducked into the car and wrapped his arms around his chest, sliding him backward with a large grunt. Dean's right arm had been ripped clean off, almost all the way up to his shoulder, leaving just a small nub behind. Bright red strips of flesh hung like raw chicken strips Castiel had seen Dean cooking in the kitchen once, and his stomach knotted uncomfortably at the connection. He saw the severed bone poking out from the lump of bleeding flesh and felt his face grow tight.
. Sex didn't have to resemble the porn Dean had been consuming for decades, and Dean's real self emerged more and more as Cas helped him un-learn.
