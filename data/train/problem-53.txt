“More!” the bunny whimpered.
“Yes,” he said filling out the short form. “I have to get a return slip when it comes to violence.”
Apollo was lying on the seat between them looking from one to the other. Despite the fact he really didn’t need his dog for a car ride John insisted that he have the dog with him at all times.
John sighed. He knew there was a chance his mate wouldn’t be able to handle their lovemaking. He was willing to accept if Sherlock didn’t want to do it again.
“Stop whining,” John said, slapping his bunny’s pertly bouncing ass.
“It’s just my Dad…” she started looking away from Rosie.
The wolf needed to makes sure Sherlock didn’t hurt himself in the process. If he fought the process too much he might do some serious damage. There was no way John as going to let his bunny get seriously hurt.
Her Papa was always getting after her for living it laying around. She quickly picked it up and placed it in her case.
He fetched a pair of handcuff from the bedside table before cuffing Sherlock’s hands behind his back. It was a smart decision on Sherlock’s part. He wouldn’t be tempted to pick the lock with his hands behind his back.
Of course, she knew she couldn’t get caught in the hallway. If a teacher saw her walking around she would be in major trouble. She dove into the nearest girl’s restroom.
“Come onto the bed,” John said helping his lover onto the bed.
“You will ask nicely,” he said. “Then we’ll see. This is a punishment.”
“I can’t help it,” he said as he began to fuck him hard and fast. “I can’t slow down baby. I’m sorry. Just hold on.”
“I love you too little one,” the wolf whispered playing with Sherlock’s ears. “Daddy has a very special treat for you.”
“I’m sorry to do this baby,” he said lowering Sherlock’s pants. “I know you’re sick but that is no reason not follow my medical advice.”
He quickly began to shake his head; his floppy ears bouncing around. He didn’t want the bigger one! It would hurt too much.
“For what?” John asked fidgeting with his tail.
The bunny cried out as an intense orgasm rocked his abused body. Despite the pain of the knots, he found himself fucking back against them. He wanted them! He wanted the pain!
“Take it,” John growled pushing in deeper. “You know you love it.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly as he took in the sight of the shimmery silver device John was holding in front of Sherlock’s narrow hips.
Sherlock let out a cry that was a mix of pain and pleasure as John drove his large cock inside of him. The bunny wrapped his legs around his lover and pulled him in closer. He brought his foot up to gently play John’s bushy tail. His toes touched the edge of the butt plug lodged within the wolf. John gave a small cry of pain. It hurt every time the toy shifted inside of him.
John smirked as he pushed Sherlock down on his cock. No matter how many times he took him the bunny always felt tight as a vise.
in him did he?
Oh well. He should have expected that. The bunny whimpered when he realized the dildo was still inside of him.
“Good boy,” John said playing with his ears. “I know you’re embarrassed but you don’t need to be. You have a medical need right now. I’m just trying to help.”
“Dinner!” her Dad called.
“Yup,” she said starting to eat her food. “My name’s Rosie.”
Just as his body was starting to enjoy it pain overtook the pleasure. His stomach was starting to churn. It felt as if he needed to go to the bathroom. He suddenly knew what it was John had given him. A laxative.
John groaned. “You have the most remarkably beautiful ass, my little bunny.” John brought down his hand, harder this time, striking the firm flesh, again and again, turning the creamy white flesh, to a bright pretty pink.
John was right. It felt like someone had stabbed a hot poker inside of him. The searing pain reached into his stomach. His wolf didn’t give him much of a chance to get used to it. He started rocking inside of him almost right away.
Rosie growled in frustration as Luna blocked the way. Who did she think she was? She wasn’t even her girlfriend anymore.
Rosie felt her heart jump when she saw Luna heading into school. She missed her so much already. Her heart sank when she realized Luna was ignoring her. Her ex-girlfriend had clearly looked right at her before darting off down a hallway.
It was clear that wasn’t happening this time. John believed his bunny was ready to take one of his ruts. He’d managed to take two canine cocks. He knew his cock would grow larger during the rut but he was sure Sherlock could handle it. It would still hurt him very badly but he was ready to take it.
“Almost done,” John said lustily, his voice and eyes were dark and hungry . “Let Greg finish. Only two more.”
“It’s in baby,” he said picking up the belt. “I’m going to start moving it. Trust me. If you try to get away again you’ll be sorry.”
The wolf growled as he ran a hand over his coarse, pointy ears.
“You’re close,” he said ramming the toy in and out. “I can feel it.  I can smell it. Let it happen baby.”
the rest of the dildo in. Sherlock screamed and arched his back. He was bleeding. He was sure of it. He began to sob heavily as his body tried to adjust to the toy.
Sherlock cried out as John pushed two well-lubed fingers into him. No doubt he was in a hurry to get this over. The bunny didn’t mind. He pushed back against the invading finger.
“You took two knots before,” John pointed out. “This can’t be bigger than that.”
“Let’s try it again,” John said re-soaking the flannel.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Sherlock said.
The young girl didn’t know what to do. All he could do was give Luna the space she wanted and hope she would come back to her. She was just glad they didn’t have many classes together. Luna was in regular classes and almost all of Rosie’s were advanced placement.
“I get spanked every night,” the bunny explained. “John uses the thermometer on me to make sure I don’t get too distressed during it.”
“I’ll uncuff you,” John said as his limp cock slipped from the rabbit’s body.
“Have a seat,” the doctor explained. “You’re in for a show.”
“Ah!” Sherlock cried as John hit him again.
“Come here,” John said, curling up against his lover. “The swelling will go down soon.”
“But fish sticks!” she said pointing now at the line.
Her parents knew something was up between the two of them. It was usual for Luna to come over a lot and they hadn’t seen her in days.
“John,” he mewled. “Give it to me.”
John felt awful for his lover. He knew what he to be done and he had to ignore Sherlock’s cries. Sometimes it was hard not to give in to his whining. Yet, he knew what was best. Sometimes his little bunny needed discipline.
The wolf slowly began to pull in and out his lover. Sherlock was very tight around him and he didn’t dare go too fast. Sherlock wasn’t screaming for him to stop anymore but he was still crying.
Yet, she knew it wasn’t the same thing. Her parents had talked to her about drugs a few months ago. She knew how dangerous they could be.
“It’s going to be alright,” John said. “I’m going to give you something to help you sleep. I want you to take it, drink your bottle, and get some sleep.”
Sherlock didn’t know what to do as John hefted the small frame of his skinny body and threw him over his broad shoulders. He yelped as he was fireman carried over to one of the sofas in the sitting room where John sat down and spread Sherlock’s tight little frame across his lap, the younger’s ass raised helplessly for all to see.
“Keep going Greg,” John said shaking his head. “He’s just scared.”
Suddenly, what was embarrassing him started to turn him on. He glanced up and around the room. All the creatures were standing and staring at them with wide eyes. It seemed like most of them were in shock that he was taking that massive cock. He wanted them to look at him with amazement. He wanted to show how much he could take and what a strong bunny he was.
She had tried smoking and was acting differently. He couldn’t really place it but something was off with her.
John removed his fingers and stood up from the bed. He was going to bring in some water in case they needed it. Since it was Sherlock’s first time chance of him overheating were high.
Rosie lay on her bed with her math book and notebook spread out in front of her.
“I hate you!” Sherlock cried shaking his head. “I hate this! I can’t do this.”
Sherlock nodded as John led him into the bedroom. He made sure he was dry before helping him get under the blankets.
“Can’t it wait?” Karen asked nodding towards the lunch trays. “We’re having fish sticks.”
“What is going on?” a teacher asked as he ran over. “Are you alright?”
He had to wear something revealing, something that would keep John’s eyes fixed on him all night instead of those hussies who were always flirting with the wolf when they went out.
Thanks to everyone for reading and enjoying this. I can’t believe how much people like this. I have so many ideas to write! I will write almost anything. I will write forced feeding but nothing with actual feeding tubes. So that is the ONLY thing off the table. I’m a bit twisted and have a wild imagination.
The wolf rammed his massive cock inside the tight wet passage. Sherlock wailed! He tried to get away. John quickly grabbed a hold of the cuffs to hold Sherlock in place.
Maybe he was. The boy placed the slutty outfit back on the rack but then, suddenly, a naughty thought flared through him. He couldn’t help it.
John opened the box of nappies and took one out  As he slid it into Sherlock’s body and around his waist, he heard his bunny began to cry heavily. The poor creature was practically sobbing.
That information surprised Rosie. Marcus was a good kid and he hung out with her. There was no way he would hang out with someone who was a troublemaker. Was Luna making it up just so she wouldn’t want to sit with them?
"It’s a bit dry,” John said as he fought his way through Sherlock’s tight muscles. “Do you need more lube?”
When he returned home he found his bunny lying on the couch. He was lying on his stomach using his laptop. He glanced up with a happy look on his face.
Oh, Rosie.
“Pull out for a second,” John instructed.
Sherlock let out a surprised yelp as the cold water hit him.  John was raining freezing water down on him. He began to shake almost right away. He wasn't used to taking cold showers.
“FIve more minutes Dad?” she asked looking up at him with hopefull eyes.
Sherlock whimpered pitifully as John removed a small bottle of pills from the bag. He took one out and placed it in his bunny’s mouth. He moved the forgotten bottle back to Sherlock’s mouth. The bunny latched onto the mouth. Tears were still streaming down his face as he drank and swallowed his pill.
He was too sick for that.
“Good,” John said picking up the end of the belt with his free hand. “Maybe this will help.”
"Of course," John said. "In our bed."
“Yes!” He screamed, throwing his head back.
That was all it took for Sherlock explode in his hands. The cum leaked out over his fingers and coated the sheets.
“Yes,” he cried tears burning at his eyes.
John dropped the ear and started walking towards the bedroom. He heard Sherlock getting up from the couch. He was taking his time but he was coming. The wolf headed into the bedroom and sat his bag down on the floor.
“It was supposed to,” John said his lover calmed down. “I’ll bet you're on fire inside.”
It was bigger though. Even though it was John who had unusually high control and balls of steel when it came to restraining himself, he was still was still in a near-rut, making his cock size and knot size slightly engorged. The doctor rolled his bunny onto his side and pulled him close. Sherlock gave a soft moan as he was settled back against his broad mate. Some people were still staring at them. Many sets of wide shocked eyes were set on them. Sherlock saw wads of money exchange hands.
Karen knew how quickly addiction to the pills set it and she knew how hard it was to stop.
“Come on into the bedroom when you’re ready,” John said running a hand along his bunny's ears. “I want to fuck you.”
“Stop that!” John said spanking him hard. “You need to calm down now.”
She didn't have a choice. She HAD to make it work.
The fox decided to trust the wolf. Sherlock was used to taking John’s much larger cock. Greg was yet to see the wolf’s cock but he knew it had to be much larger. He decided to trust him and started pushing into Sherlock. The bunny let out a squeal as Greg shoved into him hard.
That caused Karen pause. She had already done enough damage to her friend. She didn’t need her friend taking up smoking as well.
“John…” he moaned accepting the finger inside of him.
He wanted more. He wanted to take ALL of his lover’s big, long length. He wanted to feel every inch inside of him. He wanted to
She decided not to tell them about Luna. She knew it would come up sooner or later but she didn’t want to go into it. She knew her parents would make a big deal out of it and she’d end up crying again. That was something she didn’t want to do.
“Me?” Greg asked in surprise.
The fox raised his hand and brought it down hard on Sherlock’s already abused ass. Sherlock didn’t respond to the first hit. He just kept struggling against them. Greg hit him harder. To his surprise, the bunny screamed but then he calmed down.
John reached a hand down to gently touch his lover’s messy curls and his floppy ears. His fluffy head was drenched in sweat. He almost felt bad for the Omega.
What could he have? What would help him sleep when he was having such awful stomach trouble? It was clearly something that was making his wolf nervous. He seemed hesitant about showing him.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” the wolf asked crossing over to the couch.
“I know,” he said slowly sliding it forward. “It’s got lube on it. It isn't all that bad but I’m sure it stings.”
“You just wait,” John growled sliding between his legs. “I’m using the thermometer during your spanking tonight.”
The wolf “borrowed” a thermometer from work. It biggest one they had. It was five inches long and an inch in diameter. It was rarely used due to its size. It would work great for Sherlock. It would get him used to taking something of considerable size before he was fucked.
Karen smiled at her friend even though she had a pit of guilt in her stomach. How could she give Rosie those pills? What kind of friend was she? She tried to push those thoughts away as she followed her friend back into the cafeteria.
“Oh those,” Karen said with a chuckle. “You can have a few.”
“Get on your back,” the wolf instructed.
“Mine!” John snarled as rode his lover hard. “All mine. My bunny.”
He reached down and took the end of the thermometer into his hands. He carefully removed it from his lover's ass. Sherlock let out a long moaning keen as the medical device slipped free of his tight body.
John watched the adorable little nose crinkle, it was a habit of bunnies and Sherlock did it often. Whenever he did it, as now, John was always struck at how truly bunny-ish his little Sherlock could be. It also meant one of several things. Either the pale bunny was displeased with something, confused and trying to puzzle something out, or as he was quite certain was the case in this instance, he was considering something. John couldn’t help but smirk when after a second or two of deliberation Sherlock plucked John’s credit card with a bright smile before bouncing out of the room on his long slim legs.
“I’ll help a bit,” John said reaching down under his mate.
He was sure Sherlock wouldn’t want to do it again. It had been a rough experience for him.
“I’m fine,” Rosie said smiling slightly. “One a day is fine.”
A lot of fear crept over Sherlock’s face. There was no way he was going to be able to take two knots. He couldn’t take a wolf AND a fox. It would kill him!
“You take them,” Rosie said starting to get annoyed.
She smirked as Marcus started to dig through his backpack.  Good old Marcus.
She thought about refusing to join them but she knew they would check on her. She sighed and made her way downstairs.
John moaned pulling his fingers out. He lubed up his cock and placed it at Sherlock’s entrance. The bunny began to painfully whimper as he was filled. John gently put his hands on Sherlock’s arms pinning him to the mattress. He didn’t want their lovemaking to hurt his bunny more than it had to. He leaned forward and kissed him.
His lover seemed to be deeply engrossed in a novel, but Sherlock knew better. John wasn’t even moving his eyes. He was just staring at the black and white print.
Rosie felt tears spring to her eyes as she put her phone down. Why was Luna being like that? She hadn’t done anything wrong. She really felt Luna was being unreasonable. She had broken up with her over it. Luna could call it whatever she wanted but that’s what she had done. She had broken up with her and she had done it over text! Over text!
John walked into their bedroom and opened their toy chest. He removed the smallest butt plug they had. He would need it to help him. Sherlock, who was laying on the bed, perked up with interest as he watched his love insert a butt plug.
To her surprise, it was Karen who walked into the room. She had a worried look on her face.
A high-pitched moan slipped from Sherlock’s pink full mouth as John’s thick fingers brushed his prostate.
John smirked before putting the handle of the wooden spoon in his mouth. He licked his way up and down it. Once he was sure it was coated with saliva he lined it up with Sherlock’s hidden hole.
John groaned thickly. Sherlock insides were wet, so wet, so smooth-tight-soft, the resisting flesh just barely yielding under the blunt force.
“Why don’t ask her?” the doctor asked putting some dishes in the drainer.
“I guess,” Luna said with a sigh.
“That’s all until the knot swells,” John explained. “You will scream and beg then again. I’ll ignore it, baby. Don’t worry. I’ll give you what you need.”
Sherlock
“I’m going to…” Sherlock whimpered feeling his orgasm quickly approaching.
The wolf didn’t budge as he thrust deep inside of his bunny. He bit down a little harder as he started to pick up speed. This was
“I actually wanted to talk to you about something,” Rosie said not wanting to waste the few minutes that they had.
“Of course,” he said. “Why the hell would you ask such a thing?”
John reached down and placed a hand on his bunny's stomach. He could feel his stomach churning away. He desperately needed to go to the bathroom. He knew he needed to distract his lover.
“Please,” the wolf whimpered. “Let’s walk to the bathroom together. We’ll figure something out.”
“Are you sure?” he asked raising an eyebrow at her.
Mpreg/Sensory play
“It’s a big toy,” John warned. “I’m going to start putting it in and I’m not going to stop until it’s all the way in. If I feel resistance I’m just going to push right through. So I need you to relax.”
“She’s growing up,” John said moving to cuddle up against his lover. “She’s a kid. She’s going to do stupid stuff.”
It was so big! It was stretching him so painfully. No matter how many times his wolf took him it still hurt. His body just wasn’t made to take such a large wolf cock. He began to struggle and fight his lover.
John went out and bought new hand and ankle cuffs. Medical grade padded cuffs. They would make the process so much easier for both of them. He bought a sex wedge and attached the cuffs to the side. The wedge would make sure his pet was in a perfect position and the cuffs would hold him there.
“Sh…” John said resting the belt on Sherlock’s back.
The little bunny walked into the room holding the gest thermometer Lestrade had ever seen. He set it on the coffee table before kneeling in front of the couch. He got on his knees and clutched the piece of furniture in his hands, round plump ass presented to both of the larger men.
Sherlock shook his head. His floppy ears bouncing each way. John smiled and gently pressed a finger to his hole. With a little effort, he managed to get a finger inside. Sherlock cried out and pressed against the invading digit. Another finger quickly joined the first.
The bunny began to pant as his insides tried to accept that water that was being injected rather quickly into him.
“Be a good by and relax,” he said rubbing his back gently. “This is a lot for you to take. I’m so proud of Sherlock.”
"Ah!" Sherlock wailed. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think.
“Alright,” the teacher said. “I’ll give you a pass to go to the library.”
Greg quickly lubed up his cock. Globs of lubrication slipped from his fingers and fell to the sheets. The fox got in position and started to push into the bunny. Sherlock gave a yelp of pain as the cock slid into him. The fox paused his actions and looked down at Sherlock in concern.
What would her parents think when they found out?
At that moment the bathroom opened. Rosie jerked her head in the sound of the door. To her surprise, she saw Luna standing in the doorway.
“No,” she said shrugging her shoulders. “I guess I’m just stressed. We have a big math test coming up.”
That wasn’t a punishment and John knew it. Sherlock would orgasm and love every second.
“That’s my boy,” John said, giving his friend and playful spank on his behind. “You love it. No matter how you fight it. You can’t hide it.”
Sherlock takes that massive wolf cock without any lube.
Sherlock latched onto the bottle and began to drink. He knew it would make him feel better.
John made up a bottle of formula when he got home. He knew his little bunny needed some food inside of him. He walked into the bedroom and found his bunny in bed. The wolf set the bottle down for Sherlock to drink.
He had given Sherlock two spoonfuls of Castor oil before he went to work to make sure he was cleaned out. He had mixed it with orange juice to make it last nasty. Despite that, the bunny had still gagged a bit on the laxative. The poor little bunny would be in the bathroom all day but it would help him.
The bunny whimpered as John removed his hand from his cock. The wolf picked up a small glass measuring cup from the counter. He had it there just in case he needed it. He quickly began pouring it into the bag. He wasn’t much but it would cause his bunny some discomfort.
John growled forced his knot through Sherlock’s tight walls. His body was taking his knot despite his unwillingness to. The bunny began to fight the wolf harder. The large wolf had no problem holding his lover down. Tears were flowing down his cheeks as John’s knot was fully locked into him.
“Stop!” Sherlock howled kicking his feet. “I’ll be good! I promise!”
At first, everything was going well but slowly her focus started to wane.
“John!” Sherlock cried as the liquid flowed into him.
“He takes my knot very well,” John said before taking a drink. “Oh he screams and fights but he loves it.”
“About what?” the doctor questioned.
“We don’t want our bunny overheating,” John explained. “Feel any better?”
Sherlock wanted to die. He couldn’t believe how sick he was. He’d fallen ill with a rather intense stomach flu. He’d been running to the bathroom with the need to empty his bowels every few minutes. He was trying to sleep but he just couldn’t. Every time he started to close his eyes he stomach would start to grumble.
“How did she knew even know that?” Marcus asked looking at the girl’s retreating back.
“What are you taking?” Luna asked walking closer. “Meds are supposed to be with the nurse.”
“John!” he whimpered as the cock pushed inside.
“Fine,” John said standing up. “If you want to do it this way we will.”
“Really?” Karen asked looking happier. “We should go to the office and call them.”
One more.
“Rosie Holmes,” the teacher said from down the hallway. “Come here.”
“Can I go?” Rosie asked clutching the slip.
The wolf bared his teeth as he slammed harder, rougher, inside, jackhammering inch after inch after inch of his cock into the tight passage. Sherlock howled in pain as he was quickly filled. His wolf didn’t wait before he started fucking in and out of him. John wanted to take his bunny as hard and fast as he could.
“Thank god,” John said as he felt his knot beginning to deflate.
“Then lie still,” he said. “You’ve already earned one punishment. Would you like to try for another?”
“Hello Mr. Holmes,” Karen said climbing inside.
The teenager removed one of the pills and cupped it in her hand. She set the baggie down on the sink. Her body was trembling as she looked down at it. It was so strange that something so small could cause so much trouble.
Rosie and Karen headed up to her room right away. The young Holmes was dying for a pill and wanted to show her new friend her video games. Rosie dumped her bag on her bed and dug out her pills. She quickly took one before flopping down on her bed.
The bunny had already agreed and he wasn’t turning back. He had taken several enemas to make sure he was cleaned out. He wanted to make sure he was ready for what was going to happen.
John reached down to lube his cock up. He made sure to put more than enough on it. He didn’t want to make this worse than it had to be. He lined his cock up with one hand and pressed on the small of Sherlock’s back with the other.
“I had a feeling,” Luna with a sigh. “What is it?”
His bunny was practically asleep as he removed the restraints from his limbs. He eased his bunny off the ramp and onto the bed. He spread his limp legs and lifted his tail out of the way. He carefully slid a finger in and felt around for damage.
John would hold Sherlock but not tight enough so that he couldn’t get away with a good fight.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock cried, getting back into position. “I won’t move again. I promise.”
Thick piston like plunges
“What’s wrong?” John asked surprised by the sudden change.
Her little talk with Karen made her feel better. She took another moment to collect herself before heading to class.
“Sherlock was worried,” he explained when saw the confused look on her face. “I told him it was nothing.”
Luna had already moved on. It had only been a few days and she had moved on! Rosie couldn’t help but feel angry. After all, here she was still crying over Luna and hoping she came back to her. How could she be so stupid! Luna was over her.
“I wouldn’t mind having a go at him,” Lestrade said smirking.
John couldn’t believe he was taking it so well. He replaced the thermometer back in his mouth. 38 celsius. Much better. He set it back down on the bedside table.
“I will!” Sherlock cried. “I’m taking it. I’m going to be clean for you.”
“Goodnight Dad,” she said closing her eyes.
Sherlock began to rock back on the erection as much as he could. He could feel his orgasm building. Between the constant pressure on his prostate and the attention to his cock, he was almost ready to explode.
Sherlock moaned at his words. He knew he was right. He knelt down in that tub and allowed John to ram that giant nozzle into him. Once the water started he would cry and beg for it to stop. Despite this, he knew he would cum. The water would fill his insides and make him cramp. When the cramping became unbearable he would orgasm. This is how it happened every week.
Sherlock wasn’t one for social events. Bunnies, in general, didn’t like social events. All the noise and activities could be very overwhelming for a bunny. Bunnies didn’t like strangers either, it was part of their prey instinct. Yet, somehow John had talked him into going to a Halloween party.
Sherlock knew that if he had to be spanked for the same offense it wasn’t going to be good. He would be tied up and given ten strokes from a cane.
“No!” Sherlock cried,  forcing himself back hard on the cock. “I want more!”
“I’ll give you my number,” Karen said pulling a piece of paper out of her backpack. “Text me sometime.”
Sherlock cried out as he let his body relax. The large cock was claiming him and pushing in deep. It felt so long. Like it was never going to stop filling him up.
“I want you to do the last ten,” John explained holding out the belt.
happen. The little bunny loved having a warm backside. He knew it kept him in line.
He began to struggle harder as John went faster. He was sure he was bleeding! He could feel the sting of a tear inside of him. He was sure of it.
John takes a few suppositories and holds them during sex. He hates but he does it for Sherlock.
Karen was waiting for her in the courtyard during lunch. She was reluctant to hand the pills over. She should have never given them to her in the first place! Why did she send her that stupid text?  Rosie was a good girl. She had a chance at a good life. Karen didn’t have a chance at a future. She was going to end up a useless drug dealer just like her mother and father. She struggled to apply herself when she knew what her future held. But that didn’t mean she had the right to bring down other people.
“Your dad has to work this weekend,” Sherlock explained. “Besides it’s ok to change things up once in a while.”
When the head slid fully in Sherlock let out a scream into the pillow.
Sherlock let his body relax and accept the two large knots inside of him. The fox shifted a bit pushing his knot into the bunny’s prostate.
Sherlock jerked his eyes open in surprise. He didn’t even realize a large wolf had started making his way towards him. He was a bit taken back by how close the stranger was to him. HIs face was less than a foot away from him. All he could do was stare into those large pools of green.
All of this photos are from pexels and pixabay. They are nice sites for free images. The backpack is my own picture. That is my own back pack. I got it from aliexpress (it's a cheap, direct from china site). I knew it was going to be a galaxy backpack but I wasn't expecting the British flag. I knew I had to use it for something.
“Do you really hate it?” John asked as he stroked Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock didn’t want a nap! He didn’t care how badly it burned inside of him. He wanted more of John.
“That’s a good little boy,” John said wrapped his arms around his lover. “Use lots of lube Greg. It’s going to hurt him already. I don’t want to damage him.”
But she wanted them.
“That’s it,” the wolf said smirking, his sharp teeth peeking out of his mouth. “Feel every ounce slip into your body. You’re almost there. You’re just sucking it up today.”
There's nothing like this for Sherlock. He'd gladly die like this, with John stuffing his cock so mercilessly inside him. He loved it. The intense feeling, so full, so split open, John opening up his muscles, forcing them wide to his will like ripe fruit split open under a hot knife.
“I love you,” John said sliding the belt around Sherlock’s neck.
His inner muscles began to squeeze his cock with such force that it sent John over the edge. Sherlock screamed as he felt the knot swell inside of him. His body was extremely sensitive now that he had cum.
Normally, Sherlock got his nightly spanking right before bed. It helped him fall asleep by releasing all his daily tensions. The wolf didn’t plan on giving it to him due to the events that were planned. The bunny insisted on getting his spanking as normal.
“So tight!" John snarled as Sherlock's smooth wet insides clenched around him "Feel good?” The wolf asked his bunny, gripping Sherlock’s small hips in a bruising hold. There would be large finger shaped bruises there all week. John couldn't wait to see them.
Cold milk. Sherlock knew that feeling. Bloating quickly overwhelmed him. Milk was a tricky thing. If John only used a small amount on him it could cause painful cramps that pushed him to orgasm. If his wolf used to too much it felt like he was slowly dying.
“Ask Daddy,” John said nibbling on one of his floppy ears.
He brought two calloused fingers down to touch Sherlock’s tender hole. The bunny gave a little whimper as he felt those thick, masculine fingers trying to push into him.
Karen looked over her shoulder to make sure no one was watching before she removed a small bottle from her pocket. She dumped a few in her hand before carefully slidding them to Rosie.
Sherlock was surprised by that information. Normally, he had eyes full of tears at this point. While he was in pain he wasn’t pushed to any kind of limit. For some reason that frustrated him. He loved it when his wolf pushed him right to the edge, He wanted to sit on the fence between pain and pleasure. He wanted to feel like his mind was being torn in two.
“Sherlock,” John growled. “On the floor.”
John moved his hand to push gently on his body’s stomach. He could hear his stomach gurgling under his touch. Sherlock let out cries of pain as his stomach was messed with. It hurt! John was pushing everything around.
That was the pattern for the next few days. She only took Wednesday night off. She had violin practice after school and her parents liked to hear her improved playing after dinner. Rosie didn’t mind missing out on her drug fueled study session.  She loved playing for her parents. She hoped that one day she would be as good as her Papa.
“JOHN!” the bunny shrieked, throwing back his head
“Ah!” he cried as the knot fully swelled in him. It's enormous pressure was directly on the little bunny's already abused prostate. He couldn't take this level of violent pleasure. “I can’t!” The bunny screamed.
shopping. Bunnies had a vain streak in them, they liked making sure their cottontails were puffy and that their ears were silky soft. But Sherlock, being an exceptionally pretty bunny, loved wearing cute and beautiful clothes so that he could best show off his slender small frame and long dollish legs.
“Shh…” John said gently rubbing his lover’s shoulders. “It’s alright.”
The wolf’s eyes fell on John. The soldier had his back to him. He smiled a bit when he saw the man wasn’t watching. The big bad wolf wasn’t guarding his sheep. He growled with excitement as he focused back on the nervous bunny.
“What’s that?” John asked, a bit surprised by the statement.
“Good boy,” John rumbled deeply as he slammed his cock in and out, deeper and deeper down Sherlock’s esophagus. “Taking everything, I give you. Such a slut. So sensitive. You fucking love the pain. You love how I hurt you, dominate you.”
Sherlock's first knotting.
“Lestrade!” Sherlock moaned sluttishly, tossing his head about.
The bunny whimpered before getting up and running into the bathroom.  By the time he returned to the bedroom John was sitting on the bed with a bottle in his hands. Sherlock laid down on the bed with a grunt. John sat the bottle on the pillow next to his bunny’s head.
Her hopes of getting her back where crushed suddenly.
“I’ll go get the lube,” the bunny said.
“Do you want to cum?” he asked.
“No,” Rosie said shaking her head. “Don’t feel like that, please. This is all Luna. She’s just too sensitive.”
There was still considerable resistance as he claimed his lover. Sherlock’s body was trying it’s best to adjust to the large cock but there was little it could do. No matter how many times they made love it would still hurt him. His insides just weren’t built to take it. Sherlock was fighting his biology every time he allowed his wolf to slid inside of him.
“Thanks for sticking through it,” Sherlock said with a chuckle. “Now get to the bathroom before you have an accident.”
Sherlock drifted away as his lover fell into conversation with the others. Music with a deep base was filling the room. Sherlock loved music. He loved the feeling of it of giving into the music and letting it flow through him. He couldn’t hear anyone talking about him. He didn’t feel anyone's eyes on him.
“All done,” John said. “You took all the water.”
“John…” he whimpered.
Mr. Franken was the school’s counselor. If you were having a bad day students could go see him. He was really nice always had something fun to do but she didn’t want to see him. She needed to grow up and deal with life.
“Good,” John said sitting down in his chair. “Hit him harder. Make him
“JOHN!” he screamed tears running down his face. “I’m so full.”
“I’m going to do it,” the bunny said nodding. “I’m ready.”
“Move when the pain lets up,” John instructed. “You’re doing so good.”
His little bunny was already shaking as he climbed onto the bed and got into position. The wolf wasted no time snapping the cuffs on.
“Can I try?” Rosie asked.
“No!” Sherlock said shaking his head. “I have to go to the bathroom first.”
bunny.
“Fuck me,” Sherlock said pulling his legs tighter around the wolf. “Rip me apart. It’ll help you forget about it.”
Roise loved the new bag! It was blue and looked like the galaxy. There was even a union jack on the front pocket.
“I think not,” John said sitting up.
“You smoke?” she asked as her friend took another puff.
Sherlock closed his eyes as his body tried to accept the massive erection forcing its way deep inside. He could feel his insides burning and stretching as they were opened up around the invading member. The erection gave his prostate constant little nudges. Pleasure mixed with pain as John impaled him down further on his thick dick.
“John!” Sherlock shrieked, throwing his head back.
“We’re having chicken.  It’s a bit early because we’re going to the cinema tonight,” he said deciding not to nag his daughter. “Why don’t you set the table? Your dad is going to be here any minute.”
Sherlock looked up from his book and pushed his floppy ears out of the way. He felt a wave of excitement and fear fill him. He tossed his book to the side and stood up. He quickly removed the dressing robe he was wearing.
“That was amazing,” Sherlock said, trembling and kissing his lover’s rough, pointed ear. “But I have a bit of advice for you.”
Despite his illness, the bunny noticed John was carrying a small shopping bag. No doubt his lover had something that would help him. It couldn’t be medicine. They had plenty of that in the flat and none of it had helped.
Sherlock whimpered in pain as the cockhead finally popped in. No matter how many times they made love the wolf's long cock always felt massive inside of him. John lifted his hands to place his hands on Sherlock’s smooth flanks. He carefully eased bunny down.
“Good boy,” John said carefully removing the nozzle. “Get up and empty yourself out.”
“Vomiting or diarrhea?” the doctor questioned.
“Feeling alright?” John questioned.
While he was trying to mentally scream at his body to listen he felt his knot deflating even more. He cried out in relief as it slipped free from Sherlock’s body.
Luna was sure her ex-girlfriend was using drugs.  She'd started acting so differently once she started hanging out with Karen. She knew that girl will bring nothing but trouble.
He slowly pushed his finger inside.  He brought his other hand up to gently play with his fluffy black tail. Sherlock pushed against the touch pressing the finger in deeper.
“Next week I’m going to fill you up with super soapy water,” John explained. “I’m going to put an expanding nozzle inside of you and tie you up. You’re going to hold that water until you think you’re really going to die.”
John lowered the pair of pink lace panties Sherlock was wearing. The thin material slipped down his long thin legs and settled around his omega’s delicate ankles.
Sherlock folded his laptop and slid it under the chair. He rose to his feet daintily and walked into the bathroom. He stripped off his clothes and sat down in the bathtub. He had no idea what John had planned.
“Please…” he moaned.
Rosie felt like a new person by the time her Dad picked her up to bring her home. If Luna was done with her then that was just the way things were going be. She didn’t need her. She had friends didn’t act like jerks all the time. Maybe this was the best thing that happened to her.
Greg decided not to warn Sherlock that he was pushing in. He was scared that he would tighten up if he knew the cock was coming. He lined up and pushing inside alongside John’s cock. Sherlock’s mouth dropped open and his eyes snapped closed.
“I love you,” Sherlock whimpered, nuzzling noses with his wolf.
Sherlock nodded without looking away from his bottle. The wolf chuckled before getting up from the bed. He knew his bunny wasn’t going to like his plan but he didn’t have a choice.
Normally, the man would have started with one finger but he couldn’t go that slow. He needed to get inside of his petite bunny’s hole as soon as possible. If he didn’t he would lose his mind. The bunny whimpered deliciously as his fingers slid in deeper.
“I know it’s confusing,” the doctor said gently rubbing his back. “It hurts and feels so overwhelming but you love it. You love the feeling of the warm water filling your insides.”
He jumped in surprise when the wolf brought the belt down. The sound of the leather hitting the soft white skin filled the room. It was the only sound besides Sherlock’s high pitched moaning. Lestrade had never witnessed anything like it. Sherlock had to be in pain. Yet, sounds of pleasure were slipping out of his mouth with each hit. Despite his confusion with the sight before him, he felt his cock harden in his pants.
“Whoa…” a voice near him said. “That wolf is going to rip him apart.”
The fox brought up the belt before bringing it down on the tempting little butt. Sherlock yelped at the hit. Greg smirked as he listened to the noise escaping from the bunny’s pink full lips. He wanted to hear that noise again. He brought the belt back down onto the tender skin.
“Please John,” Sherlock begged. “Let’s go somewhere private.”
The wolf, bunny, and fox went into the bedroom together. The wolf dropped his bunny on the bed where the bunny crawled up it and rested his head on the pillow. He was relaxed from his spanking and was ready to take their huge cocks knots. Greg quickly removed his clothes. A painful erection was pressed against his pants and it would feel much better once he removed his clothes.
“I know,” the wolf said gently playing with his bunny's tail with his free hand. “You don’t really want me to stop. You aren’t pulling away. You’re just scared.”
“You’re Sherlock and John’s daughter, aren’t you?” a girl asked.
“More,” the bunny moaned twitching his tail.
Rosie had Marcus’ thoughts on her mind the rest of the day and the next morning. She was what disappointed to see Luna standing in front of the school with she arrived. She was glad to see her girlfriend was there but that meant she wouldn’t be able to sit with other friends.
Everyone who knew them thought it was strange but no one said anything. It wasn’t their business. If John enjoyed fucking a bunny that was his business. The rabbit never seemed to mind.
“Please,” Sherlock whispered resting his head against the bed. “Please. It hurts me so much.”
“Luna’s mother just had a baby,” John explained running a plate under the running water. “Maybe she needs Luna’s help.”
The young jumped slightly when she heard her phone buzz. She quickly picked it up and looked at the messages.
40 Celsius = 104
“How much trouble am I in?” Rosie asked looking down at her food.
“Want to play Mario?” Rosie asked picking up her game system from the floor. “I have the newest one.”
“Please,” Sherlock whimpered. “I don’t need this.”
Sherlock took a deep breath as he rose up half way off his lover’s length. He let out the air as he slammed back down. Pain shot up his spine as the cock was forced back painfully deep inside.
His wolf was standing in front of him dangling a belt in front of him. He wanted to wrap that belt around his neck and pull tight. The thought send a chill up his back.
Would he be able to handle what was getting ready to happen?
“Almost there,” John rumbled, forcing his lover down. “I know it’s a lot.”
Mild Medical kink.
“I know you want revenge,” the bunny said smirking. “What are going to do to me?”
Sherlock tried not to show the flood of pink that rushed to his cheeks thinking about having to wear a butt plug along with the chastity belt. John liked pushing dildos and plugs inside Sherlock at times, but usually, it was to prep the bunny for sex or to keep John’s come inside of him after stuffing his hole with it. Rarely did John make him wear something for too long.
“You just earned yourself a real punishment,” John said. “Get on your hands and knees!”
“Really?” John asked idly turning a page. “I don’t believe you. I think you just want the toy out.”
Karen nodded as Rosie tried the cigarette again. She had a better experience the second time. She smiled as she exhaled the smoke. She handed the cigarette back to Karen.
“Don’t move!” the teacher said pointing at Rosie. “Come on Luna. Are you hurt? Everyone else get along to class.”
“It’ll only take a moment,” the doctor said. “Then I’ll take it out and we’ll do something more fun.”
Sherlock keened as John painfully pulled his soft curls back.
“Sherlock ran out and got this for you,” he said setting the bag down by her bookcase.
“Bad boy!” John said slapping his bunny on his lush ass.
As much as Sherlock didn’t want to admit it he knew it was true. He loved everything John did to him. He loved being forced to do things he was nervous about doing it. He loved being pushed to the edge of pain and pleasure. It caused him to feel a whole new sensation. A sensation that had no name.
She wasn't allowed to have food or water in her room so she had to learn to take them dry.
“Cool,” the stranger said. “My name is Karen.”
“Come on!” Rosie said when she heard the warning bell bring. “We’re going to be late.”
Sherlock threw back his head and screamed as his body was rocked with orgasm, the massive cock battering deep inside. He felt it in his throat. The tears were flowing harder than ever as his cum coated the carpet below them. John gave one hard thrust as he exploded inside his bunny.
The wolf added another finger, and another, quickly pistoning them in and out of the delectably sweet hole. He couldn’t stand this wait but he even in his desperate wolf state he knew if he didn’t adequately prepare Sherlock there would be no way he would survive taking his giant cock during a near-rut. Eventually, as Sherlock became a writhing, keening mess he finally withdrew his fingers. He coated his throbbing hard erection and lined it up Sherlock’s hole. He put his hands on Sherlock’s hips and gripped them on. His bunny always put up a fit of a fight when he first put his cock in. He knew it was a lot for his bunny.
She was going to get written up and her parents would find out. Her relationship with Luna was over and she was dead. Luna was even thinking about telling her parents! Her life was over.
She couldn't believe her luck!
Sherlock’s felt himself getting hard at his lover’s words. Despite all the pain he was in he was still able to get hard. He couldn’t resist it anymore. He allowed himself to give in to the pleasure he was feeling.
She knew her new friend was lying/ Something was clearly bothering her.
“Rosie,” her friend said holding tightly to the baggy in her hand. “I don't think this is a good idea.”
“I was wondering if we could sit with my friends once in a while,” Rosie said. “I got to sit with them yesterday and it was really nice.”
The wolf slid the end of the belt into the loop and started to pull it tighter. Sherlock felt his body tighten as the leather touched his neck. John didn’t pull it hard enough to cause pain or discomfort. He wanted his little bunny to get used to the feeling of the leather on his skin.
“Even Papa?” Rosie asked as she climbed under the blankets.
The fox leaned over and put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. He carefully held him down against the mattress. He glanced up at John to make sure he had done the right thing. The wolf gave him a little smile and a nod. Sherlock cried quietly as he was filled with the medical device. When Greg was sure he was done he released the hold.
“Diarrhea,” Sherlock answered before going back to his bottle.
“I know,” John said rubbing his friend’s stomach. “You really need to go, don’t you?”
Deep down Sherlock had liked it. It was nice to be taken care of it. Even though he hadn’t been nuts about the nappy it had felt good in its own way. It had felt uncomfortable and heavy against him for awhile but the feeling faded quickly. Soon, it turned into a comforting feeling, like a tight hug.
He tried to breathe as tears flowed down his face. Greg was pushing into him hard and forced his way into his tight passage.
Comment. Like. Share. Chat.
“I know,” the wolf said spreading his fingers. “You’re very tight.”
Sherlock’s nails dug into John's skin even deeper as he felt his orgasm approaching. For a moment the universe was whole around him. No stress. No one judging their relationship. No cases that needed to be solved. It was the only the two of them locked together in an act of ultimate pleasure and love.
Stop!” Sherlock sobbed one final time before falling silent.
“Is someone horny?” John chuckled, delivering the last blow.
“You’re going to be so full,” the wolf growled as he began to rock inside of him.  “You’re going to love it. Actually, I’m a bit worried. What if my cock isn't enough for you after this? What if you always need two knots?”
Sherlock was riding along with her that morning. He knew something was on his daughter’s mind. She was strangely quiet during their ride. When he had gone to tuck her in the night before she was already asleep. That wasn’t like her at all.
Sherlock felt his stomach flip at those words. What else did John had planned?
“You’re my friend,” Luna said. “I don’t want to see you hurting yourself.”
Their pairing was an unnatural one. Even in a world of animal-human hybrids, it wasn’t supposed to happen. A wolf and bunny weren’t supposed to be a couple. They were supposed to be enemies. The wolf was supposed to fight the bunny; not fuck it. Yet, that was what was happening in 221b baker street.
She was leaning against the wall clearing tears from her eyes with her shirt sleeve when she heard the restroom door swing open. She quickly tried to get a hold of herself. She really didn’t want anyone seeing her crying.
“Please!” the bunny cried. “Fuck me! Fill me! Kill me if you have to!”
“Stop!” Sherlock cried as the cramping intensified. “Please!”
“I know,” she said opening her water. “You know how Luna is.”
John was a rather large, wide and muscular, wolf and no one would dare challenge him when he was claiming his mate.
Sherlock didn’t respond. The wolf ran into the kitchen and grabbed a bowl from the cabinet. He quickly filled the bowl with cold water from the sink and dropped in a few ice cubes. He stopped off in the bathroom and grabbed a few flannels and a normal thermometer from the bathroom.
“Luna,” her male friend said nodding. “I know she’s your girlfriend, but you really have to think about yourself sometimes. Maybe it would do her some good to sit with sometimes.”
Sherlock nods.  It appears this time, they will be successful.  At least he seems to wants to move to the bedroom.  They take a couple of steps when suddenly, Sherlock’s knee buckles.  He appears equally surprised, if his panicked expression is any indication. Luckily, Mycroft and John are holding him up.
The helicopter is now landing, and they both have to speak louder to hear each other.  Sage wriggles against Sherlock, and John immediately lands a comforting hand on her back. “It’s ok, sweetheart, it’s just a loud noise.”
He's happy and sated, hasn't felt like that in a long, long time.
Sherlock shrugs.  "Well, it will be forgotten as soon as another story becomes more interesting.  Besides, what would you do?  Take care of that moron of a photographer and a couple of idiots calling themselves journalists?  Making "a few calls" to be sure they'll never work again?  It isn't worth it, brother mine."
Sherlock turns his head toward him, clearing his throat and rolling his eyes at the same time. "My god, John, your powers of deduction are truly amazing," he snaps, his voice a little thick.
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak.  Then closes it.  Twice.  He blinks at John, his nervous blinking.
Sherlock doesn't wait, he's already moving against John's hips, his pelvis tilting forward, then backward in a desperate attempt to take control.  John doesn't have to be told twice.  He grabs Sherlock's hips with both hands and moves, pushing and pulling and again, faster, stronger... and, in just a few seconds...
“And the bastards that were pointing guns at us?”
"Try to relax," he tells Sherlock.  "Lay back.  Close your eyes.  Breathe."
John laughs at his own joke.  He's giddy and in love and high on endorphins.  He has bloody Sherlock Holmes cuddling next to him, a head full of curls to play with, smelling sweat and chemicals and expensive mint-flavoured shampoo.
Maybe ten minutes after they left the house, the clouds covering the sky change colour, shifting from blue-grey to a lighter tone, and the first snowflakes land on John's shoulders.  Here they are, walking close together under Christmas snow.  It's almost too cliché, even for John, but to his surprise, Sherlock's smile only grows wider.
"Which, I guess, was this morning."
"How do you...?"
"Oh.  Yes.  I texted him to schedule a meeting in one of those shady pubs downtown.  I figured it would be easier to search the grounds. That moron thought I wanted to blackmail him.  He hasn't left the property since the aunt died.  Couldn't even wait for her body to cool down."
It takes  a couple of seconds before Sherlock lifts his head.  Even then, it seems to be with great effort.  He looks down at John, waiting avidly for reassurance, and his trust is once again complete and pure -naive, some would say.  Whatever.  They aren't geniuses.
John snorts.  “Are you okay?”
Sherlock's belly is expanding. He doesn't speak of it, but John has seen him more than once over the last week changing clothes with impatience, dropping them like they are nothing more than rags.  John waits for him to bring up the issue.  His belly is still pretty modest, but Sherlock has always worn his clothes as tight as possible without it being indecent -John has zero complaints on the matter, by the way- so it figures he won't be able to stretch the fabric any longer.
I have been struggling in my life for a while now, and I am doing the best I can.  It is hard being single parent when the father of your kids doesn't want to have anything to do with them, and keeps fighting not to pay any custody.  I have been writing for a long time here, first for the SPN fandom, then for Sherlock.  That is why I am leaving this link down below to anyone who has some spare change and would like to make a donation (it works with paypal).  Of course, this will not affect my writing, I am not writing for the money.
“Look at you though; you know how proud of you I am, right? You’re doing so well, Sherlock...you’re brilliant.  Listen, if you want to try for the bedroom, I think we should do it now, before the expulsion phase begins –but we don’t have to,” he adds quickly, when panic widens Sherlock’s eyes once more, “ if you think you can’t, but you would be more comfortable in a bed and...”
He is dreaming, clearly plagued by a nightmare.  He hiccups a long sigh ending on a moan.  A tear escapes his right eye, sliding down his cheek to follow the already wet path made by others.  John hates to know he is responsible for it, for Sherlock's fear, which he tried to hard to hide when John was brought into his room.  It must have been so difficult for him, if his mind gives way to sadness in its unconscious state, emotions too great to be contained, or dealt with while awake.  He is so bloody sensitive, John thinks, lifting his hand to slide his fingers through Sherlock's hair, untangling the curls softly.
This is what I had in mind (the haircut, not the smoking, of course. Ha ha)
prove that-"
"You want me to cook brunch?" John asks, because now, apparently, keeping Sherlock well fed always improves his mood.  Something John wouldn't have thought possible before the pregnancy, but which he now uses wisely.  The haircut crisis seems to be over, but better safe than sorry, right?  Sherlock had mentioned French crepes two or three times only yesterday, and John has found a wonderful recipe, with a honey brown sugar sauce.  This should keep him happy for the rest of the day.
“Well well, brother mine, you should be a detective,” Mycroft deadpans, then drops three more pies in Sherlock’s plate.
Sherlock looks at him for what seems like a whole minute, then nods. “You’re an idiot,” he replies, finally.
"You don't even have pockets in your trousers!"
a small precision : when there is a discussion about Sherlock's popularity, please do not forget that the events of this fic take place after Moriarty died in the first pool confrontation.  The events after that, like the case that made him famous, haven't take place.  So, Sherlock is kind of just... locally famous.
"Dying of blue balls isn't much better."
::: :::
"You are imagining this, Sherlock.  And so what, she might have Mycroft's nose -and his eyes, and mouth, and character.  He is your brother after all."
He stretches his legs and turns on his side, his head supported by a brand new cushion.  John waits.  For something.  Any form of reaction.  Sherlock finishes his expose about the new heaviness of his sleep - something about the hypothalamus, he's lost John at some point - and takes his mobile from the
, he texts.
Sherlock takes the stairs two by two while John is dragging himself. The flat is cold and dark, almost... unwelcoming.  John feels a bit sorry for himself.  While Sherlock monopolises the bathroom to take a shower, he lights up a fire and sits in his chair, waiting for the flames to warm him up, so that at least he feels a little less miserable.  He might have dosed off, but not for long.  He shakes himself awake when Sherlock reappears in the sitting room, and John, surprised, notices the fresh clothes he's changed into -no dressing gown and old pyjamas, but one of his clean and crisp dark suits.
Sherlock turns John's phone toward him to show the image of a shop with a yellow and green banner in the window.  "Le Pouce Vert," John reads slowly. " It's French".
It is not long before Sherlock blinks at John, and his pout shifts into a lazy smile.  "Thank you."
"Drink."
"Polish."
They won't let him, though.  They hurt him.  Sternum rub, a pinch at his left trapezius, and he gasps, opening his eyes wide. He cannot keep them opened for long, just enough to see a blond woman bend over him, and a long pale hand half covered by the sleeve of a dark, thick fabric.
Sherlock grabs a pregnancy test and brings it up inches away from his eyes.  He squints, turns it over and over again, then puts it down and takes the second one.
John can admit he had felt left out and underestimated, while the Holmes brothers were discussing the plan without paying attention to them.  After all, he could very well defend Sherlock himself –he wouldn’t let anyone even touch a single hair on his head.  Mycroft, another bloody mind reader apparently, had suddenly turned toward him.  “You forget an essential element, John; if it should come to a physical confrontation with Blair, you will be emotionally compromised.  As such, Sherlock is evidently in the same position and he will not be able to remain safe if you lose the advantage.  He will try to help you.”
"And it was good.  I think your emotions guided you the right way."
"Sir!  This is a crime scene you cannot be here."
"You don't have to."
"There is also nothing wrong in shutting up, you know."
John grins at that.  "Well, you got better so let's forget about it, alright?"
"He was hell.  Oh, my, they both were.  In different ways.  Sherlock... the first six months, he cried almost constantly.  Nothing would calm him down.  I was going mad.  I took him countless times to the  doctor -I was sure he had to be in pain somehow... And then, it changed.  He spoke his first words around his sixth month, and it got better from then on.  He was walking at nine months old, speaking full sentences at twelve.  Questions, only questions, there never was an end.” She smiles wryly. “I knew by then he had inherited a similar intellect as Mycroft.  Like I've said, though, they were different.  Mycroft had been a quiet baby and reserved child.  Always asking to be left alone, never appreciated being held or cuddled.  But Sherlock, God...he was practically glued to me.  Could cry for hours when he was sad and laugh as long when he was happy."
"Well, that's... it's not a science. Love, a relationship, you know..."
"Not without you I can't... Oh... god, something is wrong with me, it hurts when I breathe, John-
About part 6...
He cleans Sherlock's stomach with a bunch of tissues. Somehow, having John cleaning him up always calms Sherlock.
Sherlock once more wraps his arms around John’s neck, and John holds his waist, massaging his lower back.  Sherlock’s forehead is resting on his good shoulder, and he knows he’s being careful not to use the other one, not to hurt John, even though he is the one in pain.  Thinking about it has John’s throat swelling. He gets himself under control quickly. He won’t bloody cry in front of Sherlock.
“Don’t stop,” Sherlock pants.  “Don’t stop speaking... plea
"I am saying...  What I am saying is, it would be a legal advantage to be married as we are to become a family," Sherlock hesitates, then just seems to crumble in on himself, shoulders slacking, fingers of both hands fidgeting, and John takes pity.
"What?"
The stairs descending to 221A are narrow (it had the workers cursing the lack of space more than once) and steep.  Sherlock grips the handrail -he always uses handrails now- but his gait still seems unsure, and John softly pushes him to the side to step ahead of him, the good old technique of -if-you-fall-at-least-you'll-fall-on-me that is still used in the army when one has to carry something using stairs.
Just clearing the room takes them most of the day.  The living room in 221a is in need of a serious wash, and a new coat of paint wouldn't hurt.  John doesn't say it, but starts making plans to do the work himself, even if Sherlock points out it isn't urgent.  He deserves to have a proper place to work.  John might even team up with Mycroft.  It would be a nice new father present, having a real laboratory set up in here, well-lit and properly equipped -hell, they could even add a fridge to store Sherlock's precious experiments in progress and body parts.
"Yes," Sherlock shouts, although they are inches away from each other.  "Yes, I am, but I refuse to think about this.  Why are you forcing me to go back?"
Sherlock elbows him before rearranging himself, as close to John as he can be.  They remain like that in the dying afternoon, and John cannot help but think, very selfishly by his own admission, that ready or not, he would like to keep Sherlock to himself for as long as possible.  Afterward, he will have to share, like it or not.
Sherlock’s gun moves from Moriarty to the stack of explosives lying between the three of them.  The heavy scent of chlorine hangs heavy in the air, making John sick to his stomach.  Nevertheless, he feels like he can think clearly for the first time in the last couple hours.  When his mad, brilliant, courageous best friend turns his head toward him, John nods.  If he has to die in an explosion he wants to say, it will honour to do it with Sherlock at his side.  As long as Moriarty dies, preferably suffering the most horrible pain while doing so, it is all worth it.
"Sorry, sorry, just... take deep breaths," he says, patting Sherlock's head.
"I... he didn't mean to.  I suppose he thought I knew."
"The Chalk Hills?"
John's surprise must show on his face, because it has Sherlock smiling smugly.  "The medical records from the private aesthetic surgery clinic weren't easy to find, but I have my ways."
"As I was saying," Mycroft goes on, trying to put himself back together.  "Work awaits."
"I cannot believe it."
John feels like an arsehole, forcing Sherlock to remain on his back in the middle of the contraction.  The pain is worse that way.  “It’s like a metal rod piercing me from hip to hip.”
John settles with his elbows on either side of Sherlock's head, practically lying over him, which has Sherlock's belly pressing against his own stomach.  He loves it.
Sherlock laughs at that.  His mobile buzzes once more, and John sees in his eyes how eager he is to get back to it.
"Is it serious?"
" It's two in the morning. Keep your strength, Dr. Watson.   .  Please, take deep breaths for me."
"... and yet, it is a remarkable emotional voyage to associate the human being growing in me to these images," Sherlock admits.
Sherlock is the first to complain about the fact that they have skipped dinner, which is completely out-of-character, but John had noticed his appetite has improved recently.  He's so happy to hear him utter the simple sentence : "John you forgot to cook dinner" that he doesn't point out he could have done it himself. It is John's job, after all, one he took up with seriousness to make sure Sherlock feeds himself.
Louisa Holmes has her hands over her mouth and her eyes are wide from the surprise.  She leaves John there and practically runs inside, calling Sherlock's name.
“Oh fuck,” Sherlock is panting, grabbing Mycroft’s hand.  “I have time for another one,” he announces.
"What?"
"So why are you so serious tonight?"
"It pains me to see the ridiculous lengths you have gone to, to cover yourself and make it seem like she had been the victim of some... improbable serial killer.  Did you find the idea in one of those idiotic thrillers they sell in every airport, Mr. Beeks?  The doll, the writing on the wall, the rocking chair, you really think you could fool Scotland Yard?  Well," Sherlock chuckles, "Scotland Yard working with Sherlock Holmes?"
"If you mean sex, yes.  Sixteen days."
just doesn't do.  It had forced John back in a dark, gloomy corner at the edge of his mind, a place he thought he had left behind under the intense hot sun of Afghanistan.
Sherlock sniffs again.
"Is something wrong?" He asks.
"I cannot tell what you are thinking, but it is about me, and I am not sure I like it," Sherlock says, stretching his legs over John's thighs on the couch.
“You can’t.  The power is out.”
"John, how is my brother?" he asks, managing to sound worried
"I do believe, though, that it will be unavoidable, given my brother's dependant personality.  And it shouldn't forbid him to be... well, happy seems a ridiculous word.  Let's say, satisfied with his life. So, let's weigh in the inconvenience of sharing an intimate relationship with you.  It will distract him from his work and this will irritate him greatly.  He will learn to work with it, nevertheless. He believes you make him a better person, and I tend to agree.  He has this romantic vision of how working with you is twice as satisfying as it used to be, and he is terrified of you leaving him, in any way, on a partnership or romantic level. I know what it is to love Sherlock, John.  It comes with a great amount of frustration, and it also implies caretaking.  It's inevitable.”
"I am not giving you a reason to call me an idiot," John protests.  "Is there anything else unusual?"
God, he's tired.
Another wave of wakefulness.  John blinks slowly.  The world is steadier.  His arm is numb and scratchy; he can feel the heaviness of the cast covering it.  It comes to his still drug-hazy mind that he doesn’t know if Sherlock is okay.   He did seem to be earlier, but then, John had been a bit confused.  His last memory of Sherlock is of him fighting with the paramedic trying to wrap a blood pressure cuff around his bicep, which is, in itself, reassuring.
That week, John only works a couple of shifts, and each of them stretches disagreeably, as if time has decided to mess with him, give him a taste of unwanted eternity.  John can only think about the flat, being back home with Sherlock, away from the rest of the world.  It feels like they are wrapped in a cocoon at home; everything is soft, and quiet and subdued. Maybe they are both responsible for this state, needing to enjoy the final days of the intimacy they share.  After all, they will never be two again, once Sage is born.  It’s as exhilarating as it is scary.
John doesn't have to explain himself, Sherlock knows what's going through his mind.  He gets this soft look on his face, his worry-lines disappear - something rare and precious that he reserves just for John – and he kisses him on the forehead.  John grabs his waist, holds him close and wonders if they could stay like that forever -or at least, for the next eight months, so that he knows Sherlock is safe and sound in his arms.
And it occurs to John how silent the room has become, suddenly.

“So, you want me to push him into admitting his feelings, and then I’ll share mine, and we’ll live happily ever after?”
“John.”
"Bees?"
It is.  John wonders if hormones can really keep Sherlock from getting bored.
Anderson had appeared out of nowhere, coming from the shop where his team had finished their work.  John hadn't even heard what stupid statement coming from him had triggered Sherlock's anger.  He had just been there in time to see his face turn white as he had lay back to lean on the side of the police car, feeling a contraction.
Lestrade, Donovan and a young officer are in discussion a foot away from the corpse.  A forensic technician is busy settling his digital camera.  Two other officers are standing near the door.
"I know you don't mind.  Where was I?  Yes. Once I admitted it to myself, it got better.  It's a question of acceptance, really.  I cannot be the person I was before we procreated.  I cannot control my transport like I used to.  It is my responsibility toward our child to prioritise it, in front of everything and everyone... especially me.  I accept it.  It's a psychological line to cross, admitting that I cannot fail that child no matter what, because I am partly responsible for its sole existence.  That is, not even considering I owe you the same.  Fear held me back from crossing.  Usually, I want to succeed for my own pleasure.  This time, it has nothing to do with me, and all with the potential human being I'm carrying.  It is selfless.  By deciding, with you, to have this child, from the minute we took our decision, the crossing line was already there.  I resigned and I crossed. I accepted it. I feel lighter now."
"I don't think so, Sherlock.  I think it really is that simple."
"Is this about the... erm..."
-I know Sherlock's hair is an important, integral part of his character.  I did not change the haircut because I do not like his hair, or just because I could.  It is meant to explain how scared Sherlock is of losing control, and how irrational he acts wanting to convince himself he still have at least some sort of power over his body.  If some of you are upset, John is right : Sherlock's hair will grow back in no time.
"This isn't about the fear of their actions being uncovered," Sherlock murmurs.  "The violence of it suggest that Green is a psychopath who was just waiting for an excuse to turn into murderer."
"Do not touch him, are you deaf?" He shouts at the paramedic, jumping into the ambulance to get in between him and Sherlock.
"My god, Sherlock, don't do that."
John closes his eyes and hits the wall he's leaning on with the back of his head.  This is such stupid reasoning.  Their doctor is competent -and way more competent than him when it comes to pregnancies.  She is perfectly capable of establishing the right diagnosis and making all the medical decisions to ensure Sherlock and the baby's well being.  It does not seem to matter, though, when Sherlock is in his current state.  It appears John the fiancé cannot separate himself from John the doctor.  He didn't want to assist Amy - he was well on his way to giving Sherlock a complete androcologic exam when she had arrived, and he hadn't wanted her to take his place.  She had been patient, but firm.  When John persisted, she had threatened to call security, and he had known she was being serious.  He cannot be certain he would have obeyed, though, if he hadn't caught Sherlock's distraught eyes, and had been hit by the selfishness of his behaviour.  As long as he was butting heads with Amy Brown, Sherlock wouldn't be taken care of.
"It takes a village to-"
"It isn't.  I know I protested when you said we had a case, but I was just being my usual grumpy self.  If I really thought you should miss that one out because of your cold, I would have kept you home.”
"We've found your wife, Mr. Beeks."
Mycroft nods and moves swiftly to John's chair.  His face is a little pale and his grip deadly on the umbrella's handle.  The next quick look Sherlock gives John is one of surprise, mixed with a bit of confusion.
There is no trace of John's petulant, hyperactive consulting detective.  John smiles back, pressing Sherlock's shoulder.  He doesn't miss the tremors running through his body.
"Let me call a cab."
"It is an interesting point of view, Lila, but-
"I think we do; we will be a family.  I don’t want money to be a sore subject between us."
"I really was looking forward to it," Sherlock complains, moving his arse with intent, just to get John going.  As if he needs any incentive besides Sherlock being... well,
"I wasn't aware we were playing a game so it hardly concerns me.  I have more pressing matters to attend to nevertheless, so I'm going to leave you to your nonsense."
First, I want to thank you guys for your patience, everything is back to normal in RL, luckily, so I will be able to keep my usual posting rhythm for the upcoming chapter.
"Making people around me miserable, because that is how I feel. It is such childish behaviour. You are right; sometimes I make it difficult for you to love me, despite the fact that I would most probably die if you were to leave."
John smiles in understanding.  He knows Sherlock isn’t looking forward to the commotion that is about to happen, and to be honest, John isn’t either.  Here in this room, they are a family for the first time, and it feels private and precious; a moment out of time they will never get back.  Even Mycroft, after helping carry Sherlock to his bed, has made a point of leaving them alone.
A tremendous pressure on his wound has him spilling tears in a sob that shreds his burning throat.
, John had said in exasperation that time.
John covers Sherlock’s lower body with a sheet and looks up at him.  Sherlock is staring back over the swell of his belly, looking wild, but calmer.
Sherlock is up near the toilet, his wet pants and trousers pooling at his feet. He stares down with the same startled expression he has since his waters broke.
"I thought you might prefer if I'm not present while you pack up your things.  I'll be out in a few minutes," Sherlock says coldly.
Everybody is looking at them.  Every.  Single. Person.
“What are we going to do?”
::: :::
Sherlock sighs and puts his empty plate on the floor besides him, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock rasps.  “John, let me push... I gotta... GOD, IT HURTS...”
John is quick to take off his last shoe.  Sherlock's vomiting spells have become, over time, extremely painful.  His chest muscles are constantly sore, his oesophagus burns.  It's not uncommon for him to be physically unable to stand up, several minutes after.
“I baked them and brought them here.” Mycroft sighs dramatically.
"And what does this imply, exactly?"
::: :::
"Do you think
"You.  Have. No. Idea."
“Yes, you’re doing an excellent work, bee, come on, you can do it,” Mycroft provides.
"The damage at the femoral artery was minimal.  I'm confident you won't suffer from any permanent damage. I'll let my assistant finish stitching the superficial layers of skin.  Alright?  I'll see you tomorrow."
Sherlock nods.
"Hey..." John moves to his side and lays a comforting hand on his shoulder.  "You ok, darling?"
"I thought..." Sherlock says, his voice sounding smaller than usual.
Mycroft’s car is right in front of them, and John is glad not to be alone.  When they had settled in the car, the radio was blasting information about the huge low pressure system responsible for the “apocalyptic conditions”.  That was when John turned it off.
"You know," John goes on, rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock's back, "I'm not asking you to change your tailor or anything, but you might consider wearing something else than suits and tight shirts for the coming months.  At some point comfort will be more important than looks."
Another pause.  Three puffs of warm breath.
“Well, if we weren’t trapped because of a bloody landslide, love...”
The realisation that this man is, in fact, Margaret Grey's nephew pops into John's mind like a firecracker.  He hadn't been with Sherlock when he had met the man, but everything in his behaviour practically yells his identity.
“The landslide happened at six this morning.  It goes on for half a mile.  It seems therewere environmental studies done here five years ago, and the file had shown instability in the soil, due to an underground branch of the river, but it had been stamped ‘not urgent’ and ‘to be monitored.’” He states the facts almost mechanically.
"Sherlock," John tries again.
"I am.  Do you trust me, Sherlock?"
Sherlock smiles at him and bend down, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.  "I was ashamed to tell you, and there you are, surprising me once more, by taking my defence."
"You bloody mad man, you," John retorts, unable to restrain himself further.  He grabs Sherlock into a fierce hug.  After his normal tensing period, Sherlock hugs back, and he must be bending his knees, because his nose is shoved in the crook of John's neck. Warm puffs of breath caress John's sensitive skin accompanying kisses.
"Which means?"
"Now I believe you will leave me alone and stop trying to take my picture," Sherlock smiles, eyes still closed.
"No, not even one."
“Yes, she is.  Of course she is.  Come on, now, you don’t have to wait for another contraction, come on, push her out.”
"I..." Harry hesitates.  He can picture her, twirling a strand of pale hair around her finger, as she always does when she is nervous.
“You got that from a two-minute phone call?  Mycroft, what are we going to do?We can’t cross over and there is no other road.  Unless we uh...” John bursts out laughing, but stops abruptly, before the nausea gets worse. “Unless we find a bloody boat and...and... get Sherlock down a-“
"How far is he?" Maria asks, taking some notes.
"Of course."
"... and night," Sherlock grimaces.
.  And it isn't only a wish but a certainty.  Like all of his life, John had in fact prepared for his union with Sherlock.  It's something unique, and the fact that Sherlock doesn't want to have kids doesn't bother him in the least.  John isn't even sure there is enough space between them for a child.
It soon appears, though, that John cannot do much.  He sees it, bending over the rocking chair.  The corpse has reached a state that is called "dry decay" in pathology.  He should have noticed it as soon as they entered the room.  Despite all the windows being closed, or blocked by wooden planks, the air doesn't carry the very characteristic smell of putrefaction.  There is barely any flesh left, and half of the woman's hair is gone, leaving a very fine layer of brown, thin ones.  The clothes are in very bad shape, eaten away by moths and covered in fine dust -human skin, most probably.  John cannot see, with a quick once-over, anything indicating the cause of death.  What catches his attention the most is the body's arms - they are cradling a plastic doll wrapped in a blanket.
"The ninth of June," John whispers, surprised by how many images those four words trigger in his mind.  Wailing babies, and round bellies, pacifiers, pastel colours and the first notes of a lullaby he can't quite remember.  But also... well,  Sherlock.  Coping with the pregnancy.  The contrast is almost shocking, if he's honest.  Sherlock, clumsy and heavy, his ankles swollen, his breath a little short from the pressure of the uterus.  There will be no more cases come spring, no stake-outs, or running through London while living on tea and biscuits.
"It is practical.  It's for our baby."
Mycroft is nervous, which has John suspecting he might just know what the gift is.
To no one's surprise, Anthea gives him that slightly amused-slash-condescending smile she should get trademarked and tells him to follow her.
Sherlock sighs, rolling his eyes.  "What can I do about it?  I mean, you have very clearly described the reasons I am struggling with my fears right now.  Surely you know of a way to alleviate my negative emotions."
Sherlock nods.  John presses his forehead against his.  It is damp and hot.  “You can do it.  Sage is ready; your body will tell you what to do.  Don’t fight it.  I promise I won’t let anything bad happen to you or the baby.  I promise.”
"It's okay, we're in no rush," John lies.  Well, kind of; his cock is definitely impatient to be taken care of.  But John also wishes to let Sherlock bask in his afterglow and relax, feel the marvellous boneless fatigue that follows an orgasm.  Sherlock, though, won't have any of it.  He manages to unbutton John's trousers and slide a hand inside his pants, wrapping it around John's shaft.  They both shiver.
After that expose, Sherlock refuses the invitation from Lestrade to lead the investigation team.   Greg had come to John, hoping he could get Sherlock to change his mind.  Yeah.  As if.  For Sherlock, the game is over.   He has no desire to pile up names and evidence, to look for multiple bank accounts, aliases and such, following never-ending trails all over the world.
Sherlock's sperm motility was off the charts, which fine, was obvious. Less obvious was that they seemed to be roughly divide into two categories. Speed racers, which rapidly whipped along through any complicated cellular mazes that John cared to replicate within seconds. Always selecting the right path to the cellular material with the hormonal signature of an ovum. In a solution replicating an omega's reproductive system, they remained active for two to three hours. Sacrificing longevity for speed.
He wanted to ask Sherlock to join him. To curl into his warmth. Into the solid mass of him. The rules against fraternization with a superior officer seemed far away. The ability to speak felt far away too.
The pimp smiled unctuously and put his hand over his heart. "With a truly discerning eye, the consul recognizes quality. He's a freshly acquired slave."
"Oh, it's perfectly safe," said Culverton airily. "Well, relatively speaking. It's worth any danger when you see what I've found."
He butted his head against his mate's chest happily. "Love you."
Sherlock looked down. He was still in Slytherin professorial robes. He pulled on an expression he'd seen his mother-in-law use many times. "What, you don't recognize John Watson of the Watson theater troop! My performance of the House of Gint had Ferengi paying top latinum for seats on Ferenginar." Oddly enough, he had seen several presentations of the House Gint once he got the communications arrays set up to take outside signals in his early teens.
"Really," said a blue eyed girl with Sherlock's thick black hair in curling ringlets all the way down her back. She at least had some clothes on. Seriously, the amount of nudity in this universe made John's head hurt. Her voice was soft, "Did you actually, umm… his," she waggled her little finger and a faint blush stained her high cheekbones. Really, John and Sherlock made some really pretty children, lots of pretty children, thought John muzzily.
The door opened slightly and Hunter slipped inside. "Julian, Donovan got all of the original crew in the cargo bay for what's fake Holmes is calling a memorial for the 221C even though the words out that the remains aren't quite right. But we need the Captain so we can prove that he's who he says he is."
What Sally is thinking about is this,
Connor rolled his eyes, "Because that girl over there," he pointed to the source of the whisper," thought about it some more, and parsed back through his memories, "And him, and her, think so."
John followed her gaze. There was a bright blue lesion on his arm. Whatever disease this was, it moved fast. "Maybe you should take me to the bad place now." He looked over at Cho, who had developed lesions over the thyroid glands on her neck. "How long did the grups have before they died?"
Connor said very softly, "I was taken from Mummy when I was really little. They put us in prison and they did things to us. I can't not help now." Sestre knew that had happened not long before he'd met Connor. He very much wanted to comfort Connor in some Human way. It was only reasonable. Connor was his friend.
"Without their worship, we'll spread thin as a moth's wings on the wind. Without their love, we'll grow weary as a tree in winter." He pleaded.
"Mum, I'm trying to convince him of something. I won't be hard on him."
Keep an eye on the warnings.
"That's irrelevant to this investigation," said Killander.
John said, "What will happen to Euros?"
"Captain, Erickson is back," said Sh'Alaack, which was fine. Sherlock did not want to spend another moment on this planet.
Not-Sherlock didn't explode in anger. He huffed and flounced back and forth with a sulky expression, looking much like a child who'd been caught doing something they shouldn't. "That wasn't my fault."
"Yeah, well," John didn't have any answer for that. John's mind finally caught up with something Billy had said earlier. "Wait, Khan Brittanus couldn't have gone through juvenile heat. He was an alpha. You mean he was a carrier."
Sarabeth snorted. "Not that everyone listens to that."
Sarabeth said, "But that makes no sense, love. I've seen plenty of pregnant omegas walking around. Interacting with alpha. That's just old fashioned thinking."
"That's for me to know and for you to find out," said Moriarty.
John swallowed. He hadn't even thought of that, but of course, Billy's mother had been first generation from the first augments. Of course, Billy's grandfather had been one of the Augments who went with Khan. "Did you hear much about your grandfather growing up?" Had a really horrible thought and wasn't fast enough to keep it from coming out of his mouth. "Was your grandfather's relationship with your grandmother… consensual?"
She adjusted the spanner again. Sherlock watched her eyes moving restlessly around the narrow space within the Nacelle.
They went to the Shuttlebay where Sh'Alaack and Donovan were waiting impatiently. Sh'Alaack had what appeared to be every tool in the universe dangling from a tool belt. She looked tense and angry.
John sighed. "There are healing properties in your blood and sperm, which has consistently overcome any contraception I've used. Not that it's come to anything." No need to explain why. "But you should know your own results." He handed over his research. "Any ideas why or how this might happen?"
"Your lack of memories are a result of the trauma that you sustained. Do you wish to go back and attempt to alter events again?" asked the Guardian. "Limitless journeys are possible through me."
To a degree much of her career had revolved around being under estimated, but that had been when she was infiltrating organizations and disrupting them for the good of the Federation. Not working as a part of an organization. A ship. A family.
Sherlock's face beaming with joy as he put that ring on John's hand. Fading in John's memory, until John growled at the fade and yanked the memory back into focus. Never going to give that memory up. Never. Never. Never. No. No. No.
"Hey, there. I'm new. Is there a place I can settled down?" He held up the small bag full of the contents of Sh'Alaack's package. He was glad that Sh'Alaack's kids had wanted to give their grandmother treats from around the galaxy and handmade blanket, and not something less useful.
Really, it was only the fact that Sherlock was distracted by thoughts of John, of all that they'd discussed, of what John was going to go do, that he perhaps when John was himself again they might discuss the possibility of perhaps intentionally reproducing, that as he emerged from the Jeffries tube onto the bridge, a Ferengi fired a blast that had Sherlock falling to the floor, unconscious.
Moriarty said, "When I saw the Bakerstreet arrive just as I was ready to leave DS9, I knew that like destined lovers, we were drawn together for a good fucking time. I was hoping to cause a diplomatic incident, and I still could. Starfleet ship equipped with an illegal cloaking device. I know you got it working Supertart, you saucy minx." He winked at Supersmart.
John shook as Harry squeezed his shoulder and whispered, "I'm sorry." Harry was crying as he plucked the communicator from John's chest and put it on his own.
Instead, they made it to the sea, where Sherlock jumped into the waters. John hadn't been entirely clear what Sherlock had intended for this portion, but as it turned out there were a pod of dolphins that quickly carried them out into the sea where a giant clam shell waited for them to climb into. John clambered on wet and salty. His question of "What's going on?" was genuine, as he waited for this fantasy's secret.
John spoke with Sherlock before they left. It would be best if Sherlock bunked with Yao on the Defiant. While John bunked, with Lucy and Eva, who were coming along for moral and tactical support.
John lowered his eyes and tried to look, if possible, even smaller and younger. He'd always loved sugar baby role play. Easy when Sherlock was so much taller. "Daddy, is it time for bed?"
He was laughing at their narrow escape when John kissed him. John's tongue into his mouth. His own tongue exploring John. He didn't rip off John's clothes – fine he did, but with no other object than getting closer, always closer. He did ejaculate all over John, but for no other reason that John's hand, his nerve damaged hand was wrapped around his cock. John's lips were licking beads of cum off the head and if he came spectacularly, an eruption that a volcano would envy, it had been three months, nine days, and eleven hours since they had last been intimate.
John said mostly just to be saying something, anything, "Don't worry. Sherlock will find us."
At its basis, the neural neutralizer associated negative impulses with memories of unpleasant sense memories. While positive impulses were given positive sensory associations. In lives so empty of positive associations, these could be added. The scent of warm bread. A parental hug in a life where no hugs had ever been provided and the like. Using technology to gently thwart the dagger of the mind's eye as it were.
Owen was soon backed up by about twenty Normal Humans in red leather uniforms carrying fucking laser spears looking like a squad of ketry freaks jonesing for their next fix, which was not her favorite look on people with weapons.
Another memory once done.
However, John refused to describe the scenario beyond that. He would only smile when asked for the level of detail Sherlock needed to ensure that John was fully satisfied with the encounter.
He was alone. He came out into the passage. The way down had been walled off with hastily piled stones.
It was why they'd relented and removed Sherlock from cryo sleep after what he'd done. They'd most likely done the math. Sherlock was still a dangerous and unstable murderer, but they'd defrosted Sherlock. When he was old enough to breed, they'd brought a dozen omegas with DNA that matched the information handed down by the first Breenava Empire at the time of year when their estrus cycle would have them going into heat, denied those omegas access to suppressors, and then left them with Sherlock, the only alpha in the palace. Not that Augment Inferiors were allowed to have suppressors, but there was always the black market. All of this two decades before the window to the correct time in the past opened.
John said, "Sherlock, what are the names of the pirates in your basement sea?"
For a very brief moment, there was a moment of clarity and it was too much. Something was wrong. The thought swallowed by mental fog and need.
It took him a moment to parse just who skidded to a halt in front of him. Her face had changed. Her eyes… she… it was like looking into Sherlock's eyes, but her scent was unmistakable. "Soo-Lin."
They ate in silence for a long time. Watching the sunset turn the mountains gold and pink. Purple deepening into black and the stars came out. Pretty in a different way than in the observation deck back home.
Sherlock didn't say that on the day that his physical form died, John was correct. He did have a plan where he could direct John and Washington to the room with the starship, be sure the emergency batteries were fully charged, and overload the power turbines. It was a well-designed system, but any system could be overloaded. Wherever his consciousness was stored, it couldn't operate without power.
He saw that other John take that other Sherlock's hand. Kiss it. Look up at him lovingly. He heard John say. "Maybe some colony ship landed here somehow. Was thrown through some sort of time fissure. Maybe something to do with the storm. Founded a race like those Khans always wanted."
"Fucking hell, Sherlock! Look at me when I talk to you!"
"Mum? What happened?" whispered Connor.
Which set John to thinking about his own choices. Cuddled with an alpha in a bed that still smelled a bit of the previous night's sex. He and Sherlock had discussed time to time the possibility of children after John finally came clean about the box of massive potential, but other than acknowledging that John was fertile as fuck for Sherlock, they hadn’t carried the discussion to the next step.
"Sherlock. I'm still in here. Still an adult. And, and, and, I'd had sex by this age."
Her posture shifted. Everything about the way she held herself changed. Yao's face twisted with a snarl. "He betrayed all the Khans. Khan Meiying and Khan Noonian Singh shouldn't have been flung into space. To die asleep in the void. My ancestors should have died as warriors here on Earth." Spit flew with the vehemence of her speech. "This false Khan died a traitor's death. It's why I stayed close to this one." She curled her lips at Sherlock. "The very image of the traitor."
"You can't read more than one myth without some god royally screwing someone over and stringing up a chair with their fur, or turning them into spiders, or just plain having sex with someone while in the shape of golden rain or whatever. So," Hunter leaned back in her chair and whirled her index finger in the air, "assholes."
She went to get two new pickaxes, tired as she was from working all day. A few people were trying to sleep, but they didn't need to earn their air just at the moment. She didn't know where the captain was digging, but she could help. She slammed it less effectively than the captain into the stone. "Just because it's a bad idea, that doesn’t mean you're not thinking about it. We all think about bad ideas."
Sh'Alaack said, "I was able to block whatever wave form Adams was using earlier. But when I did, my guide at the facility became... very agitated. We may need to fight our way through anyone near the shuttle."
(See the end of the chapter for
Lethe got as far as, "Wonderful, now we can..." when Harry smashed her head against the sidewall. The silver device and the phaser dropped to the floor.
"Sh'Alaack isn't that much older than I am. She couldn't have been more than a small child when the massacre happened. She's wrong. You put an idea in her head and now she’s got everything turned around. She doesn't know my father."
"Which you do not regularly play," said Supersmart. "It's obvious from both the lack of wear on the flute itself and your lack of muscle memory for how to play it."
Once she had a tricorder hidden in a compost bin, she volunteered to take the cart out to the above ground facility. Eshess told her, "Doing extra won't gain you their favor. They only know how to take."
Was told, "I'm Eshess Sh'Evhaavoss," in return.
Sherlock said, "It's likely we're from a time long after Sarpeidon. We have energy sources more efficient than a simple dam. Also, given the nuclear winter."
Sherlock, of course, genius that he was, twisted his newly young body as if he were shy. As if he hadn't asked for precisely this. To be debauched for his birthday.
Sherlock very lightly, he had enormous control given the fragility of some of items he was expected to service in this room, brushed a pseudopod over John's cheek. "Shall I stop?"
"They weren't much better on Earth," said Billy stubbornly. "Mum died in the streets. Connor and I were taken to a death camp."
"Don't," said Eva, clutching Flopsy to her chest.
John looked at the candle holder. "Uh. I heard you scream. It was the first thing to hand in the temple."
"I know," shouted John. He jumped off the bed. "Julian, I'm practically thirty years old. I'm a Doctor. I'm married. I'm an adult. I know all this." He tapped the side of his head. "I'm still in here."
Beneath it were a few stones, like in the other rooms. Three short spirals. Little more than a stack. The words written here were more meaningful. Mycroft Holmes. Chin Singh. He touched the stones, but whatever significance was assigned to them was not conveyed by touch. There was no stone for Sherlock or Euros. Nor for the brother Sherlock couldn’t remember, Victor.
"But we can't survive outside. It's not livable. Many of the Morg from above the surface are becoming sterile in addition to violent. Developing unsupportable mutations. The only way to survive is below the surface."
Since Th'Azetron could answer which treatment variation his daughter had used and triplets were moderately interesting, Sherlock endured the remainder of the conversation. While every atom of him itched to find out what had occurred in John's interview. Where John had been assigned.
"Bound to be something to do with the Breen," said Donovan. "If you read the last security briefing," she looked significantly at Sherlock, which given that John knew Sherlock didn't even know who the sector fleet commander was a bit of a laugh, if John was in a mood to laugh, "was that they're really beginning to expand mining operations throughout several Federation sectors."
Supersmart tried again. "I believe there's a device attached to the deflector array, which is affecting our memories."
"Relax." Sarabeth stopped Mollyhoos lips with a finger and a kiss. "Heat's always a special sort of intense, and if I had to travel to the arse end of time. At least I found you."
Sherlock concentrated on maintaining control of navigation. It was not easy. The interference from the dekyon waves were causing distortions in the navigation systems. Even visual navigation was distorted. They were surrounded by thin silvered ribbons in space that sent back racing reflections of their own craft.
Epicanthic brown eyes said, "The first one wasn't a virus. It was a retrogene that,"
Sherlock looked at her and really she had no idea how John put up with being looked at like that all the time. She felt like she was being flayed, examined, and found wanting. What he said was, "You'll need to expand your course of study. Go back over the biological articles that I gave you when we were researching the effects of the Ceti Sexus Pollinis and then focus on Augments. When John ramps up his genome-wide-association study, you'll be ready to assist him." He grimaced. "John isn't always happy when I try to assist him." Rolled his eyes. "Call him an idiot for being an idiot."
"As you say, any such place where Humans reside will be a Breen protectorate, and they'll go to war with all and sundry." Mycroft made one of his infrequent silent laughs. This was such an outrageous lie that Elim let Mycroft brutally steal the last of the butter.
It was possible she might be more free with her information with only him present.
John didn't so much fall unconscious from the stun that hit him as fell into a sort of dazed slump. He felt himself picked up as if it was happening through layers of thirty layers of cotton. He was eventually dumped on a sort of lounging bed. Wherever he was, it was a pleasure craft. He sank into the cushions. Velvet plush under his fingers. Rich colors rioting in front of his blinking eyes. Scents of leather and ambergris twisting on beams of light from the latticed lanterns. A rising headache.
She headed for the designated location on Beta Aurigae where her ship, the
John didn't turn back around. "I cannot believe this. Do you understand that? I cannot. I will not believe this of my father. He won’t even kill a spider. Mum has to do it. I cannot believe that not only did he kill all those people, but that he kept killing just to keep himself hidden."
. He remembered who he was. He understood that his sister had been killed and that it was Euros' fault. Euros and Sherlock's.
Veema added, "Sarpeidon was also unstable and was eventually ripped apart by a mob when they realized that he was trying to create a time paradox that would cause the planet to turn inside out. Not that his successors were much better and thus the nuclear war."
For that matter, he'd seen his parents put it on while still a toddler. There was a family story that his and Harry's wailing during the key bit had been part of one of the better performances.
He renewed his bite marks. Breaking the skin. His mate's taste making him dizzy.
It seemed a lifetime ago.
His primary clue was the intrusion detection system (IDS) that had not alerted when a line of code had been uploaded onto the server for the cafeteria replicators. The code itself was nothing unique. A commonly used algorithm meant to take advantage of systems where the Admin password had not been changed from the default value. Since the cafeteria servers were within the internal and completely unsegmented network, whoever had access to one system had had complete access to the entire network from the moment John and Donovan arrived.
Not something to worry about just then.
Connor felt exposed.
Once inside and with a cup of tea in his hand, he still didn't know quite how to say what he had to say. Despite practicing it on the way there.
Connor heard his mum's heart skip a beat. He knew Chin and Grandfather must have heard it to. Into the silence of that beat, Connor said, "But why? I don't understand it. You could have been asking Augments to come live here all along. Then the schools would have been full. There'd be all sorts of Augments living here. It doesn't make any sense."
Connor hugged his mother. "I know, Mummy. It's okay. I can go with Sestre."
John opened his mouth to ask what the ever living fuck was going on, when he became overpoweringly thirsty. Perhaps it was the watery blue light from above. He looked around for a replicator, and ordered a large glass of water, gulping it down gratefully. The blue lights assumed a sort of halo glow. Everything was just a bit softer. More relaxed.
Connor shivered. He'd grown up in a world at war.
Grandfather's doting smile was genuine. Rueful. "They'll love you. When the doctors think you won't have a relapse, I'll arrange for you to get into correct grade level. But it won't be much larger than what you're used to. There's only a little more than a hundred children in the Blue Zone School."
Jovas said, "Kenner and I do not go through estrus, but the rest of the omegas here, not so much. When winter comes every alpha in the area, rutting animals, tries to get into the cave. At home, I'd have had the support of other omegas to help manage things. Ensured things were done the proper way. Managed the protection of the genome."
"A Caitian," said Benjamin dubiously.
Sherlock nodded wearily. Tears leaking down his cheeks. He staggered towards Victor, who tried to crawl away. "No, it's not real. Yellowbeard, the Ice Queen has a spell on you." The twist and snap of his neck was real enough. The sound made her wince. It made her lose her grip on Sherlock's mind.
"Not so much," said not-Lestrade. He gave John a long droll look, so much like the actual Lestrade that John almost could believe it was him. "Not that the Secret Police couldn't break any of us like a twig. But given where Sh'Alaack is going, we're moving our operations in case her identity isn't as solid as Ishros thinks."
John squeezed Sherlock's hand. "I'll be fine. It's an excellent facility and Harry was lucky to be sent there." John lifted his chin. "It'll be fine." It had to be fine. Anyway, it was a clear a signal as any from the universe when the Bakerstreet pulled the assignment to deliver supplies to Elba II that it was time he visited Tantalus. Past time.
"My brother, Sherlock, and Doctor Watson are the progenitors of the Breen race." She put her hand over Mummy's. "Time travel. It brought us together. It allowed them to go back in time and create the Breen race, and as they returned it may as yet allow them to…" she stopped and looked down. "Obviously, I'm glad they were able to determine a treatment for Connor."
Donovan frowned. "If there are children here alone, we need to do something to help them."
"But," John was getting more than a bit frustrated with many times great gramps here. "You don't need us. Obviously, if Mycroft, who admittedly is a clone, but Chin, Sherlock, and God forbid, Euros, exist, then you don't need Augments from Earth for our genes. I'd always heard that first generation Augments couldn't reproduce together, but whatever. More power to you. You figured it out. You could do just fine growing your population the old fashioned way. Especially given whatever upgrade your… Khan Brittanus… which… not the in-law I was expecting… but fine, the upgrade KB gave Sherlock's um… sperm," because suddenly a thirty year old doctor felt awkward saying sperm, but ancient grandpa was staring at him. "Shouldn't take too long before you have pretty good sized population."
The boarding party had been led by Humans in Section 31 Starfleet uniforms. His own phaser had fallen from nerveless fingers as a blast took him from the side. A familiar voice had said, "Careful, we need to question them."
"It's your bed, but I've slept here a lot recently." Another kiss. "I think I just get the same uniform over and over. That's why I have no clothes. I keep a book my father gave me when I left home to join the military. It's precious. The pages have been looked at. They are well loved. That's not something you leave in a lover's quarters. A mistress. A concubine." Another kiss. "Maybe I work long hours. That's why I haven't slept here all the time. Maybe we're newlyweds, given we've had sex twice in the last," he twisted to look at the chrono on the wall, "hour and a half."
John smiles despite his initial disappointment -he's a little bit ashamed to miss Sherlock's presence so acutely, and at the same time, he can't help but feel amused at the correct deduction that John might worry Sherlock would be up to something reckless - like trying to catch McMasters on his own by sheer force of revenge and anger.  To tell the truth, the woman is absent for John's mind.  He isn't even angry with her, more irritated by her stupidity.  John had almost become the second victim of an otherwise intelligent woman who had ruined her life for a lover that couldn't be faithful, then had tried to escape an inescapable situation.  What a waste.  And now, her case is solved and John doesn't plan to write about it, or speak of her ever again.
"Maria is supposed to drive," Moron protests, although his voice has lost its previous assurance.  It's almost as if he's asking a question.
"What?"
Sherlock shakes his head harshly.  "No, I would never wish to taint our relationship that way.  There was a time, John, where Mycroft and I were... Well, I would say... close, before he became my legal guardian.  Afterward, though, there was a time where we truly hated each other.  It wasn't his fault, he never asked for that sort of responsibility.  Now, it's gotten better. He is my brother, I can even say I am fond of him, but the hate has left wounds that will never be healed. refuses.  As for having my case revised, it is possible, but I do not wish for it to happen."
“So hmm... That was huh... unexpected.”
"Think he's ok?"
"Debatable," Sherlock interrupts.
"Maria, I want him to get some o2, three litres.  And take his vital signs."
When the helicopter arrives, Sage Martha Holmes-Watson has been born for forty-five minutes. She is resting in her father’s arms, her tiny mouth around a nipple, sucking on and off lazily.  John watches over the both of them, monitoring them closely.  According to Sherlock, Sage is five pounds two ounces, maybe three (one of his most surprising talents is how he has taught himself to evaluate the weight of things without using an instrument).  She’s a small baby, but she is healthy.  John has submitted her to a make-shift Agpar test , which is carried out on all new-born babies at the hospital and serves to evaluate their general health quickly and precisely. Sage’s score was more than satisfying.
Sherlock laughs, although it very much sounds like a choked sob.  "That doesn't mean anything."
"Le Pouce Vert," Sherlock corrects in an impeccable French.
"I am... sorry," he pants.  "This is ridiculous."
Only him.
Sherlock's relationship with his parents is complex, for reasons John has yet to understand.  They are lovely people, obviously caring a lot for their son, and have welcomed John into the family with joy -and a relatively well hidden expression of disbelief on their faces.
"Am I not in the cab with you? You have what you wanted: we are going.  Why do you feel the need to behave like an absolute arsehole?
"I know that.  But...
"Compliments aren't something that come naturally to you, are they?"
"Of course, the colour is meant to look like blood, but it's ink.  I would guess... a permanent marker of a popular brand.  I need more insight."
"Still in there?"
"I do not think, I know.  Mrs. Hudson is currently eighty-two years old."
“Sherlock doesn’t do relationships, he’s married to his work,” John protests weakly.
He's apologetic when he arrives, and Sherlock looks kind of sheepish.  He brandishes John's new Sudoku book he had bought a few days earlier and shrugs.
...Yes, Lestrade.  Here, with them...
“Yes.”
"Alright.  Let's see if you can come up with more words," Sherlock whispers, a bit mocking.
"Admittedly, you were a little slow."
Louisa smiles.  "My thirty-seven year old son is a complete stranger to me.  I do not know what kind of mother this makes me."
Well, John is not an idiot.  And he knows Sherlock has had plenty of time to find Beek's new address, lying down with his phone.
"I am... well, I don't know.” He pauses. “John."
Long story short, dear mpreg amateurs, it is coming.  The first part has four chapter and you've just read the third one.  I can already tell you that the second part begins with the baby's conception ;-)
"What if I do lose control, during labour, what will happen then?"
Sherlock passes from post-orgasmic bliss to sleep.  He's on his back, both hands relaxed each side of his head, a position mostly seen with young babies.
"So you mean... you are not actually putting an end to our relationship?" Sherlock risks, hope softening his tensed features.
"So that’s why you did it, then. You wanted to have - at least - the impression you were still in control."
All those changes adding up, it sometimes makes John doubt his theory about Sherlock’s asexuality.  What if by saying women were not his expertise, what he really meant that evening at Angelo’s was that he was gay.  He hadn’t exactly contradicted John when he had mentioned awkwardly that it was all fine.  John himself had messed up, almost proclaiming his heterosexuality to the whole restaurant.  He had been caught off guard, and hadn’t wanted Sherlock to think he was flirting with him –which he wasn’t.  Not so early on.  And then, they had both been trapped by what they had said.  What if Sherklock?...
"Yeah?"
"It's ok," Sherlock whispers, his eyes taking on that particular pale, static appearance, which happens each time he immerses himself in complicated, intertwined thought patterns.
"Yes.  Are you?"
Of course.  John goes to shut the air conditioner, and grabs another blanket from the closet.  The sound of heavy rain rings in his ears, and there are two incredibly loud thunderclaps before he comes back to bed.
Five days after Sherlock felt the baby move, the first real warm day of spring arrives.  The sun is pleasant, the air filled with chlorophyll and the sugary sweet rotting draft from last autumn.  John is at the point where he has to restrict himself from moving too much.  The only pain left is a slight discomfort at the site of his cut, and soreness at the end of the day.  The swelling is practically non-existent.  He knows it is especially during this part of his convalescence that he needs to be careful, because the wound, underneath the surface, still has some healing to do.  He occupies himself that morning with a much needed catch up with the laundry -Sherlock has made some surprising efforts, but it remains that he tends to forget the most basic things, those boring, tedious tasks -like, say, eating- when he could do so much more even remaining immobile, just thinking.
He can see Sherlock's own prick hanging between his legs, half hard.
"John.  You need to go to the chemist’s and buy one of those pregnancy test."
"What was its name?"
John finds it really firm.  His heart skips a beat.  This is really happening.
John smiles up at him and pushes back on his shoulder until Sherlock gets the hint and lies back down, not without rolling his eyes and huffing, of course.  John shushes him and grabs his right hand, guiding the long, agile fingers along the little swell under his navel.  Sherlock's stomach muscles contract and relax, but the swell remains there. Definitely there.
“I don’t know; stay here, I’ll go check.”
, John thinks clinically.
"And I'm going to go crazy if you don't penetrate me right now," Sherlock grunts, running one of his large hands on his chest where he grabs his left nipple and twists it, hissing between his teeth.
"Oh, John," Sherlock whispers, shaking his head softly.  "What happened between us was a shared fault.  Do not think you deserve any of the rubbish I laid upon you just because you cannot - and I mean because it is impossible- understand what being pregnant feels like."
John had toyed with the idea of moving the other furniture around so that the couch is closer to the fireplace, but with the weather getting warmer each day, he has decided against it.  He knows Sherlock will be more prone to being too hot as the pregnancy advances and his belly swells than the contrary.  Besides, it is always easier to fix being cold than being hot.
"Not right now.  Besides, he might already know."

"You deduced it how?"
John probably would have reacted more strongly if Sherlock's hair had been that short everywhere, but some curls on the top of his head have escaped the scissors. It's a nice haircut, to be honest, and once the shock has passed, John finds he quite likes it.  He should say something, he must have been silent for way too many seconds for Sherlock's liking.
