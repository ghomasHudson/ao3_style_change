The class stops taking notes and starts collectively ogling the new (attractive) kid.
Sam and Eileen chuckle and smile at each other. Sam takes two (out of three) plates off the counter and sets them on the kitchen table. The couple settle into their respective seats and begin eating.
Dean and Cas are now exiting Cassandra’s room, in the hallway, looking back through the window at Cassandra, still grieving her legs.

“It’s you, Dean.” Cas looks like he’s lost all discomfort and is just full of fondness. Good, because Dean’s being awkward enough for the both of them.

The Djinn nods, motioning to the bloody handprint on Dean’s shoulder. He looks at it, confused, and goes back to the Djinn. He schools his expression back to macho man aggression.

And just cause he's gone it doesn't change the fact:
Jerry stalks over to the motel room, then swings open the door.
Pretty sure he’s drugged.

Yeah, that’s what I’ve been trying to tell them. You’ve said it best, though.
Wait, really? Well get me the hell out of dodge, I’m so not digging the super hell thing, gotta say, Val. Get me outta here!
What’s not clicking for you, Sam? I’ve gotta be here to take care of the kid!
Can I get tied up by the window? It’s hot in here.
Dean stops and looks at Cas, laying down in the backseat. He smiles. Amara catches this and smiles back.
(muffled yelling)
They share a short-lived smile.
Dean smirked. “Cas,” and it wasn’t really meant to be the start of a prayer, but Dean went with the flow. “Got your ears on? It’s time to come home. Let’s be happy on Earth instead of this shitshow.” Tears streamed down his face, eyes stinging, his heartbeat quickening, and a deep feeling that could’ve been anxiety, could’ve been excitement, and could’ve been love blossomed inside his gut.

It was dad, wasn’t it? I get the feeling there’s more to the story than Glenn told us. Or that he even knew.
Yeah, I want to have him here. He’s always coped with deaths by throwing himself in hunting, and I just got him back but... What he’s doing seems a little more healthy, even if it is a little weird.
Cas passes out on Dean’s shoulder again. Sam starts laughing uncontrollably, and Eileen joins in. Jack just beams like the little ray of sunshine he is.

SHERIFF HANSON (O.S.)
You’re asking if it’s worth the risk.
Dean’s eyes widen. Meg goes back to singing and The Empty covers its ears. The screaming, whispering, and murmuring of other dead things in the Empty starts to get louder.
Dean throws his whiskey bottle across the room. It shatters against the door, the pieces falling in a pile next to it. Dean pouts and groans.
(sighs)
An uncomfortable silence ensues. Jack’s oblivious, of course, just enjoying his eggs and bacon. But Sam and Eileen look at each other, then back to Dean, who pulls out a flask from his sweatpants, about to drink from it when Sam snatches it away.
The idea itself is ridiculous. Dean looks at Jack, guilt burning in his stomach.
Heyyyy sunshine!
Jack stops suddenly as he reaches Dean. Sam does too. Instead of responding, Jack looks curiously at Dean, then around Dean, then up and down.
Somewhere. He was over this direction when I heard...
Way to go, parenting.
They’re nearly ready to leave now, and Dean’s crossed off nearly every name on his mental checklist of friends to say goodbye to. Garth, Missouri, Jody–every name down the list makes this harder and harder. Still, his resolve hasn’t wavered. He may not survive this, but he wouldn’t survive the alternative either.
THIS ISN’T A FUCKING DIARY.
“Cas.” He interrupts and he doesn’t mean for it to come out so broken and pleading, but the look he gets from Cas tells him in an instant that any attempt to pretend things are alright would be futile. Cas takes a deep breath.
DEAN: No. No, you’ve gotta be–maybe you’re wrong.
“What the fuck.”
“Don’t you get it, man? This is the way the world works. You gotta watch your own back.”
You can’t avoid him forever, you know.
“I’d suggest you reconsider.” He leans toward Dean, mockingly conspiratorial. His voice is low. “Don't you wanna know why your little kidnapping mission went sideways so quickly? How we knew you were coming? What happened to your broken little angel?” Dean’s eyes widen in horror before he can help it. He schools his expression quickly, but he’s not fast enough. The mask has slipped. Belphegor has him hooked in, and he knows it.
Dean snaps his journal shut so suddenly that Cas looks over at him, but only briefly, his eyes quickly returning to the road ahead. Slipping his pen and the book back into the pocket of his jacket, Dean turns now to look out of the window next to him. He’s only half paying attention, though. The trees, dusted with snow, are nothing but a blur of green, white, and brown rushing past him, and they seem all the more unfamiliar from his reluctant place in the passenger seat. Cas had insisted on driving, told Dean to get some sleep, but the tangible tension between them would’ve made sleep impossible even if he had wanted it. They’re both irritated and on edge, and they’re isolated from the rest of their group in front of the two passenger munitions truck. Dean would do anything for a distraction at this point, but there’s no music to play. No one to talk to–at least, no one who isn’t Cas, anyway–and the thought of talking to Cas right now makes his stomach twist into knots, because neither of them can take back what they said, and both of them refuse to back down. There’s nothing else to be done.
“Forgive me if I don’t believe you, brother.“ Dean shoots him a warning look, and Benny throws his hands up in defense. “Hey, I’m not tryna pry or anything, I just–. What just went down… that can’t have been easy. And I want you to know I’ve got your back, whatever else happens. You know that, right?”
“Cas?” He breathes, voice worn ragged by his sobs. It’s a pointless question, a prayer he knows will be unanswered, and it drops cold dead in the emptiness of the room. “I know–I know that you can’t hear me. Not this time.”
“No, not like that, I just mean–you’ve lived this life that… I can barely comprehend, you know. You saw the
Castiel stifles a yawn as he trudges through the woods. The sound of it would likely have been masked by the nighttime chatter of forest creatures, but he’s still on edge after the close call from earlier in the day. He’s tired, but not enough to be careless. He had managed a little under two hours of slumber, and though it wasn’t much it should still hold him over, for a while at least. Weariness tugs on his eyelids, weighty like bags of sand, but when it comes to exhaustion, Castiel is a heavyweight champion. Sleep is still a foreign and unwelcome entity, and he avoids it whenever possible, even at the best of times. Any sleep he does get is utterly dreamless, and he feels a little less human for it–though he’s not sure whether or not that’s a bad thing.
CHARLIE: Mic check, is anyone on?
–I lose control, if I ended up hurting you, I just…” he trails off, his expression saturated completely in sorrow and fear. “It’s over now, Dean. It has to be, but I’m alright with that because the extra time I was given, it meant I got to be with you. I got to say goodbye, and I didn’t think I’d get even that, let alone…”
THIS WILL BE MY LAST ENTRY.
Dean looks back down at Cas. His eyes are still closed. “Well, I didn’t know.”
It doesn’t bear looking at again.
Dean scoffs, his back still turned, busying his hands with the tools on the cart. The nagging voice in the back of his mind tells him that there is something very, very off about this whole situation, but he can't quite put his finger on it. “Talking and telling the truth are two different things.”
The look on Lee’s face makes Dean feel more uneasy than he’s felt since this whole situation started. He swears he can hear the rush of his own blood through his veins, and the hair at the nape of his neck stands at attention. He closes in on his former friend, numbly pulling a blade from where it’s sheathed at his waist, and pressing it below Lee’s chin.
“Sure thing, cher,” Benny replies, his expression morphing into something that teeters dangerously between mirth and misery. “I was always gunnin’ for your job anyway.”
CHARLIE: I know, but that doesn’t mean he should just– when you get back I’m locking you two in a room until you talk. I’ve had enough.
“Nothing worth mentioning.” They smile at Dean in good humor, and, bemused, Dean smiles back, shaking his head.
“Belphegor, right?”
CASTIEL: Come in. Anyone?
Charlie turns to Dean, lips pursed and brow pinched.  Her eyes look so sad, and Dean almost laughs because god, he just can’t stop hurting people he cares about and at this point it’s getting ridiculous. “You try, Dean,” she says firmly, but Dean just shakes his head. “You try your best with the shitty cards you were dealt, and that makes you a good person, no matter what the outcome is.”
“I love you too, Dean, and I’m sorry. But I also promised myself that I’d keep you safe.” With his free hand, Castiel reaches into the pocket of Dean’s jacket, the inside one on the lower right side, and he does it without hesitation because even like this, strung-out and sunken in, being eaten alive from the inside out by something evil, Cas knows Dean better than he knows himself. He pulls out the pistol Dean keeps hidden there, the one he’s had since before he’d grown into his own limbs, when his voice was still squeaky and he hadn’t yet had his heart broken. He laces Dean’s fingers and his own together and wraps their hands around the pistol, their laced up fingers on the trigger.
Seconds pass, then minutes. Nothing. The woods seem to settle, quiet once more, no longer mocking him in his vulnerable state. Castiel inhales deeply, his vision no longer painfully spotty, and stands shakily, leaning heavily on the large tree beside him. Wiping off his muddy hands onto his now equally muddy pants is probably pointless, but he does it anyway just to keep himself busy for a few seconds longer.

JANUARY 26, 2014: RESCUE ATTEMPT #1
He exhales nervously, just for a second, and one of the croats, trailing behind the others, stops in his tracks. He turns in Castiel’s direction, and Castiel stiffens helplessly, mouth drawn into a tight line so as not to repeat the same mistake again. For a frozen moment, the croat doesn’t move either. Then, from the gap in the tree trunk that he’s been peering through, Castiel could swear he sees the croat smile, though he’s too far away to be sure.
“Now is not the time, Cas. if you haven’t noticed, we’re in the middle of a war.”
Dean takes both of Castiel’s hands in his, smoothing thumbs over knuckles absently as he gazes into Castiel's eyes with a resolve that is so frighteningly unshakeable he has no choice but to look away. He doesn’t see Dean take a trembling breath, but he hears it, he feels it crash over him, coming in waves and pulling him under. He hardly dares breathe himself, for fear that what little air he has left would be ripped from him, that he’d drown in Dean completely and give in without a thought.
[ January 29, 2014. 05:52 ]
Well, what do you say to coming over to my place for a movie night?
Sam blinks and shakes his head from where he’s laying on the ground. He props himself up on his elbow only to flop back down again.
TITLE CARD: SUPERNATURAL
“Of course, Dean.”
Th-this pulled me here. C’mon, Cas, you gotta believe me.
We’re ready, then.
Dean chuckles, reminiscing about Old Cas and how stuck up he was, but also how dorky and naive. FLASH CUTS of footage from LAZARUS RISING, the handprint, Cas tilting his head, “you don’t think you deserve to be saved.” He takes his hand slowly off of the scar, then closes his eyes to pray again.
Why don’t you sound surprised?

Jerry sighs and gets out of the car, looking in the window. ANGLE IN to see Jack, playing with Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, setting up a fake tea-party looking game. Jerry looks amused that this supposedly vital creature is a toddler.

John’s eyebrows furrow in confusion. “But it’s heaven. Can’t you just get your hearing back?”
Silence again. Dean couldn’t hear that, he couldn’t, not with those words echoing in his head over and over just taunting his stupidity.
(wait what the fuck)
Dean clutches the steering wheel of the Impala. It rumbles quietly under the music. He’s clearly driving way too fast for a small town, and way too recklessly. He turns recklessly over a curve and hits the corner of the sidewalk.
Dean aggressively taps the hang up button on his phone and puts it in his pocket. He leans into the Dean Cave door frame -

Why is Jack... little?
With that thought, Dean can’t resist. “C’mere, kid.” He holds out both arms for a hug and is surprised to find Jack crashing into him desperately. He remembers what it was like to be there, terrified of making his dad- in Jack’s case, father figure- angry or disappointed, and clinging to every sign of affection he gets.

They drive off ahead, a caravan of beaten up cars and trucks following closely in their wake, but Dean no longer notices the rumbling of their engines, nor does he notice the way the truck jerks as he drives straight over the potholes in this fractured section of road. He looks straight ahead and the twin white lines leading forward into the dark look like they're leading him directly into the gaping maw of some vast unknown creature, but that’s nothing new. They’ve been driving for ten hours now, and they’d stopped and searched the woods on foot three times already. They’d attempted to establish radio communication more time than Dean can count. Nothing has come of any of it.
“He’s dead and it’s on me. If I had just–”
BENNY: Sure. Hey, Dean… I'm sorry about–
“I won’t stop looking, I couldn’t do that to Cas, but I’m not gonna kid myself either. Even in the best conditions this’d be damn near impossible, and we lost daylight
“You okay, kid?” He asks shortly, giving her an out if she doesn’t want to talk, but allowing the underlying sincerity in his tone to speak volumes. Charlie doesn’t turn around, but her lips quirk up a little in an exhausted half-smile.
It washes over him all over again, and he feels everything and nothing all at once, and so, simply, he aches, and the silence presses in until it’s no longer bearable.
“So what, Cas?” He asks dispassionately. “What now? You think we can win this war with what–the power of love? Grow up. This isn’t a movie, and we don't get to have a happy ending.”
“Man, I’m really sorry. I know he–” Benny sighs. He shoves his hands in his pockets and peers at Dean empathetically. “I know he was an old friend. A close friend.”
Next came the earth in it’s growing days, lush and brimming with crawling, creeping, swimming things, and everything felt just a little less lonely. It’s Castiel’s secret that they see echoes of the first springtime in the green of Dean’s eyes.
“You’re looking for the colt, right?”
The gravel crunches loudly beneath their feet, and it’s not long before Cas looks down and sees them. His eyes widen in alarm and he opens his mouth to call out something in warning, but before he can do anything of the sort, Charlie’s stride has picked up into a sprint and she rushes toward him, almost barreling him over with her embrace.
I know how much he means to you, and I know what you have to do.

DEAN: No, he’s just gone. Damn it, where the hell did he go?
Castiel laughs hollowly. “Or maybe I’ve just ruined you.”
BENNY: –no get down. You see him anywhere?
“Bingo. What can I do for ya?”
“What exactly do you mean by ‘certain events’,” he asks, the timbre of his voice low and threatening. He asks, but without a doubt, he already knows the answer.
CHARLIE: Hear you loud and clear! What’s up?
“Yeah, of course I do.“ Dean replies. He looks down at the ground and sniffles, hoping that the frostbitten red of his nose is a good enough disguise for his feelings. He’s grateful that Benny’s looking out for him. He is. But, this isn’t the time or the place for breaking down or spilling guts, especially not after what just happened. The taste of betrayal lingers, caustic at the back of his throat, and he trusts Benny, hell, probably more than he’d trusted Lee. But right now… He just can’t.
“Get everyone ready. Jody, Charlie too if she wants to come. Get everyone from the last mission, since they’ll already be familiar with the area. Find replacements for the casualties and for… everyone else we’re missing.” Dean begins to move away, striding quickly towards the cluster of cabins that make up the majority of their camp. Benny follows suit, keeping pace with him. “I’ll send someone back to take care of–” Dean closes his eyes for a second and takes a deep breath. “To take care of Lee's body. We’re on the road at 10 at the latest but if everyone’s ready fast enough, I’d prefer to leave sooner.”
“Are you, now?” Dean approaches the devil’s trap again and Belphegor flinches. Dean smirks and ignores the ugly feeling that crawls up his throat. Having even an ounce of pride in this is sickening, but he can’t shut it off. Not anymore. “So there’s more you haven’t said?”
All he wants to see is Cas.
CASUALTIES: LEE WEBB, GUNSHOT TO THE SHOULDER
Dean nods, and his smile falters again. “If there’s anyone that can take over, though, it’s you. You’ve got this, Benny. You do. Hell, you probably have a better shot at winning this than I ever did.”

“I’m not alone anymore, Dean,” Castiel reassures him. “I have a family. I have Jack. Sam. I have
Dean lets the door slam shut behind him. He feels the chafing of the icy breeze against his skin, and turns his face upwards to stare at the sky as it purples with early morning light. It looks vacant, the stars already fading until they’re reduced to mere pinpricks of barely-there light. Dean takes a long breath, deep and shuddering and lets his eyes flutter closed. He doesn’t know quite how long he stands like that before the footsteps approach him, but the crunching of old snow and forest floor debris underfoot is deafening after the hush.
He aches, and that’s not even the half of it, but he hasn’t the words for how desperately he clings to every last second he spent in Castiel’s presence, chasing his afterimage in the recesses of his mind. For the way, he had felt a part of himself wither pathetically the moment Cas was out of sight. Nor does he have words for how badly he wants to turn back the clock, to have even a second more, the two of them together.
BENNY: Dean–
“You know what happened, man. You’re not stupid. The demon, the one that took the colt from Belphegor? He was the runner. Cas caught up to him, and… well, you understand why we couldn’t let that slide.”
JANUARY 24, 2014: ON ROUTE – MISSION #237.
DEAN: Thanks, Benny.
Dean may be nearly mad with desperation, but he’s not that far gone. Not yet.
BENNY: ...Yeah, you got it. Over and out.
“Listen, you piece of shit. We might have a history, but right now, you mean absolutely nothing to me. I’ve been holding back up until this point, but you know exactly what I’m capable of. So talk–or I’ll make you.” Dean eases back, releasing his grip on Lee’s shoulder. Lee closes his eyes, exhaling shakily and cursing under his breath. For a long moment, the room is quiet.

Rowena hums quietly in amused approval, then turns to Cas. “Castiel Winchester, do you take Dean to be your not so-”

Dean scoffs and responds with raised eyebrows and a questioning glare.

“Oh, hi guys, didn’t expect to see you so soon,” he chucked, appearing out of nowhere, waving and moving so casually, like he hadn’t just ended everyone else’s world. Chuck surveilled the people there, eyes going first to Jack, then Sam, Dean, and finally Michael. “Oh hey kid, funny seeing you here.”
CLOSE shots on both the Handprint, glowing under Dean’s shirt, and Dean’s eyes, darting around.

They’re then jumped by the three Djinn, showing up seemingly out of the blue. Their blue tattoos glow. One takes Sam from behind, cupping their hands over his eyes. Sam struggles in their hold. Dean sees this and tries to go after and protect him but he’s stopped by yet another Djinn, jumping in front of him and tackling Dean to the ground.
Sam chuckles and rolls his eyes. Oh, what love does to his big brother. It’s a funny look on him.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS - HALLWAY OUTSIDE DEAN CAVE - DAY

Dean serves up the mediocre food for Jack on the cheap plates on the motel room table. He then hands some of the beer to Sam and Eileen, but drinks the rest. The research papers and laptops have been piled up on the side to give him room to eat.
Wait, where are we going?
Sam’s waiting in the passenger’s seat when Dean gets in silently and makes a move to turn the ignition one and get driving. Sam puts a hand up, and Dean pauses, sighing and looking down. He knew this chick-flick moment was inevitable.

Dean, grateful for the change in topic, lets the smile slip from his face once more. “Now… Now we’ve got to find Cas.”

“Call it fact-checking,” Dean replies coldly. He wipes his bloodstained hands nonchalantly on a discolored cloth nearby and looks Belphegor in the eye. “Well, gee, I think I believe you. Thanks so much for your help. Now, I guess I'm feeling generous today, so I’ll make this quick.”
...Dean?
CASTIEL: Good. Everything’s set up. Are you on your way?
“And I’ve fallen already Cas, full tilt, head over heels, heart on my sleeve in love with you. I have been for longer than I care to admit, but the only reason I can say it out loud now is because you weren’t afraid.”
It’s early enough in the evening that Camp Chitaqua is still humming with activity, and as always a small crowd of people have paused their busywork to oversee the group’s return, to to help unload the trucks and provide medical assistance when needed. Charlie stands among them, the bright white of her cast shining like a beacon and making Dean feel sick to his stomach. Sicker than he already was, at least, because the feeling had never really stopped. She hasn’t seen him yet though, caught up in watching Alicia, Garth, and Layla as they’re escorted to the medical cabin. Reluctantly, Dean gets out of the truck and, finally, she does see him. Charlie starts to run toward him, but the look on his face must be something unspeakably ugly and tragic because she stops dead in her tracks. Dean offers Benny a few parting instructions before walking slowly to meet her, eyes fixed on the ground beneath his feet, begging his mind to focus on way the dirt and leaves mix with the old snow unappealingly. He reaches Charlie all too quickly.
[ January 24, 2014. 08:22 ]
Be careful, child. That’s all I’ll say. I’m sorry I can’t do more.
The street is empty, dead silent, and the pit in his stomach grows, ugly and twisted until Castiel can no longer bear it. He closes his eyes just so that he can let himself pretend, if only for one moment, that things will be okay. It’s all for nothing, though. He knows, with every bone in his body, that this is all wrong. He knows he shouldn’t be alive.
Cas lifts his eyes lazily to meet Dean’s. “Sounds like a plan.” Dean’s expression turns stony, and he stares at Cas a few moments longer before straightening his posture and averting his eyes. “Alright, pick two people each, I want them loaded on the truck in ten. Charlie, get Missouri set up as soon as possible, I want a mic check before we’re on the road. Cas, stay behind a minute. Everyone else–you know what to do.” The few people in the room acknowledge him with a variety of nods and grunts of assent. Jody’s out the door first as always, set on being prepared as far in advance as possible. She’s followed closely by Charlie who throws up a Vulcan salute with her good arm and parts with a smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes. Lee walks quickly behind them and he doesn’t meet Dean’s gaze, but Dean figures he’s appropriately cowed by his confrontation with Charlie so he pays it no mind. Benny stops in front of him, his expression contrite.
Djinn One shakes its head, smiling at them.
Can’t we? I sure as hell know what it’s like. I thought you did, with Jess, with Amelia, with Eileen.
You know, we can’t just keep not talking about it.
Castiel disappears again in the same moment that Dean’s left there alone, while the scene around them morphs, changing to-
Oh I could throw you in the lake
Well the crooks are out
Fine!
Then suddenly, harshly, John bursts out laughing hysterically. He’s the only one who laughs, and it just adds to the tension of the room instead of alleviating it. Wheezing, John slams his hand down on the table.
With Dean kneeling down there, the scene changes. Castiel disappears while Dean remains in the same position. Meg is out of the picture, and now we’re at-

Glenn rolls his eyes at Dean, then looks at him with the “you know what you just said, bitch” glare.
“I- uh, it’s not an act…” Dean shifts uncomfortably.
Right.
“Son of a bitch. I missed you.” Cas expected it to end there, for Dean to walk away and let Cas rest, or grab food, or something. Emotional conversations weren’t a thing they had in this family. Yet, Dean sat down on the bed and moved closer to Cas. Even running his fingers through their hair. Cas’ hair.

MUSIC (V.O.)
Good. That’s good. Don’t take any crap from them, you hear me? You’ve got the floor.
Castiel, you don’t-
Dean blinks. “What?”
DJINN ONE (O.S.)
EILEEN
“There’s way too much to tell, Dean,” Eileen says and signs. Dean has no idea what the signs means and can’t really follow both at the same time, but he appreciates the opportunity to learn. “We had long lives.”
There’s something in the bunker. It’s pulling to- Ugh, it’s so blurry! It’s pulling far away.
Just like daddy said, I know. It’s still lame, though! I wanna help!
He’ll be back soon, I promise.
Okay?
Finally, a moment to breathe. Dean stands fully up and shucks his sleeve back down. Sam opens his mouth, but grimaces and taps Jack’s shoulder, indicating that he should probably explain. Jack’s jolted out of a staring match with the handprint scar.
(confusion)
CUT TO tears dropping down Dean’s face. He so desperately wants to say something, anything, but he can’t.
He’s awesome! What happened next?
I lost you!
“He says he’s fucking
Who’s a good boy? C’mon.
Dean shrugs.
DJINN TWO
(sighs)
Glenn opens the door, then stops in shock.
They just... touched them. And they were out like a light. I ran as fast as I could. I-I don’t know... Somehow I escaped.
“I swear on our child, Cas, if you finish that sentence with something even resembling emotionally stunted or repressed I will-”
Dean starts getting angry, which wasn’t really his plan... but here we go.
BLACKOUT.
DEAN (CONT’D)
END MUSIC CUE.
Deal’s off, mother fucker, I’m getting him out if it kills me in the process.
White text: NOW.
“God, I missed you, fucker. Don’t ever do that again.”
FADE IN:
So let’s salt and burn this bastard. Where’s he buried?
A-and you’re not doing the dreamwalk think you- you’re gone. You’re really-
Don’t- this conversation isn’t about that, okay? I’m pissed. You died on me, and expected me to- to live on?
So I don’t need to torture it out of you, per say. I’ve got options.
(exasperated)
Sam walks in, then blinks slowly.
Dean sticks out his hand to sign, shakily getting his thumb and index finger out, but then his hand is snapped to the bar and he grunts with the impact. Dean’s eyes well up. He’s silently crying.
LUCIFER
CASTIEL
to love you forever, Cas, because like hell if I’ve got a choice in it. But I d-do-” Dean swallows around the crack that tried to break his voice. “I do vow to be- be the best husband I can be. I vow to do everything I can for you, in sickness and in health or whatever. I’m going to do it when you’re pissed off at me, can’t stand the sight of me, and wanna put a bullet in my brain. I’m going to love you outwardly and unashamed. I am going to change for you- I already have- and stay
HONOR
Robert and Glenn pull back from each other and share a soft kiss. When they pull back, we look over to Dean, awkwardly staring into the distance. Robert and Glenn hold each other by the side.
Eileen nods, glances to Dean, concerned, then back to Sam. Signing back:
Not Lisa.
“Shh, Dean, don’t compare yourself to your father. You are so much- so greater than he can hope to be.” It aches inside him when Cas reaches to grip his shoulder- the one with the faded handprint scar on it. It’s too tender. He wishes Cas would just grab him, hurt him, and tell him he did something wrong- and- and he has no idea why. The thought sends him into another emotional spiral, but having run out of tears, he just holds tighter on Cas' trenchcoat.
Sheriff Hanson coughs and motions to the surrounding bodies.
“Now I know you don’t mean that, boy, so why don’t we continue having our nice, civil dinner without you pretending to be a fa-”
It’s taken control, let’s beat it, get up and go
Oh, I know that look. You got your eyes on another lady.
CASTIEL
Eileen grins back at Sam, and they kiss, chaste and sweet and adorable.
Dean sighs. Oh, woe is him.
What Dean and Cas find out, though, is that there is way more to planning weddings than they thought. They forget that every detail is up to them, and it’s kind of weird hiring a caterer in heaven when no one needs money there, anyway. But they do, and do all the classic wedding stuff too. Other than dress shopping.
Sam lets out a long sigh, then takes Eileen’s hand in both of his giant ones.
SAM (CONT’D)
Cas opens his mouth to say more, but the atmosphere shifts once more.
Sam opens his mouths, but shuts it before he says anything further. Then they walk to the barn with grim purpose. Sam’s pretty unsure, and honestly, Eileen’s just there for support.
Your unicorn, really?
JACK (CONT’D)
“Are you going to fucking get him off of me? Dean! Sam!” No one moves. “Mary?” She stays still as well, as if trying not to break a carefully crafted atmosphere, when really, it was all already shattered.
Sam shakes his head, then signs to her:
Do- I mean, do you like it? I could find another. I guess. Or you could, I don’t care. Uh.
Oh, I know what you’re doing. Don’t think I don’t know you wouldn’t get away with that before.
CASTIEL
DEAN (CONT’D)
So what about the “new queen of hell?”
Know what?
CASTIEL
I brought the Archangel Blade, we could go in, kebab ourselves a little devil bitch.
Right, uh, come on in.
Dean carries the bones of one nun to the other grave, where he drops them.
Dean and Castiel keep running, going, and Meg is far off screen when-
Hey Jude, don’t let me down.
Me. I mean, out of all people... me. And it was enough for him to just say it. I-I didn’t have the time, I didn’t have the time to say it back. He died not knowing I-I...
MUSIC (V.O.)
I do. I do, Cas. With that guy, I was getting-
Straight into his maker’s arms

Dean sighs. He’s slowly losing his anger and is just becoming tired. Sam smiles, remembering how Dean used to boast about him at school.
(chuckle)
(deadpan)
So tell me about this guy you “kind of” have your eyes on, huh? I’m a good listener.
You know I wouldn’t have it any other way
Dean grunts and lets go of Jack to grab his breakfast and sit down at the table. Jack follows.
Dead.
Whatever you’re here for this time, I won’t listen to another rejection. Or another fake reciprocation. I’ve said my peace to the real Dean. I won’t fall for this again.
I’m going alone, and that’s final. Amara.
Chuck’s body slowly turned into a conjoined twins amalgamation before oozing into two separate forms, Amara, and Chuck.
EILEEN
(defeat)
Yeah. I don’t know, why don’t you go talk to Jack? He’s seen Lucifer and the Djinn Queen last, might as well see what he knows.
(back to panicking in his head)
Dean kissed me our junior year.
I’m gonna be blunt, okay? Dad crashed and burned because he put us aside for the mission. You’re crashing and burning because you’re putting yourself aside for us. It’s breaking you apart!
Is Dean awake yet?

It’s a beautiful place. Sterile, tasteful wall patterns and stylish furniture. There are people - clearly wealthy people - walking around, relaxing, talking to people at the front desk.
INT. CASTIEL’S ENTRANCE BARN - PONTIAC - NIGHT
“Dean-”
Sam scoots over to the passenger’s seat as Dean clambers into the driver’s. The Impala’s still rumbling quietly. Dean puts his hands on the steering wheel, but pauses. He turns the engine off.
The movie quiets and Glenn grimaces. Something’s up.
(weakly)
My heart feels dead inside
The Djinn share a look.
“It’s been a while since we were here, brother.”
Whatever, let’s get back on track, okay?
Sam takes a moment to recover from the stunning topic change.
“Who-kay,” Dean laughs. “Uh, well, I guess it’s time for the big announcement. Well, I guess not-
It’s at that time that the food is ready, and people start arriving. Sam comes in with Cas in the middle of an intellectual conversation about the importance of the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest. It’s absolutely nerdy, and Dean loves them for it. Plus, kind of a cute, thoughtful thing to talk about, even if it doesn’t matter in heaven.
I was getting jealous, okay? And I had no right to be. I can’t- I can’t ask you not to move on. Hell, I should be asking you to.
Sam and Dean. Now how are you, dear?
Any witnesses?

“Shut it, Sam. You knew as well as I did. Never that smart, that good a hunter, and now we find out he’s-” John glances at Cas with more than a little fear in his eyes. “...Gay.”
MUSIC (V.O.)
(loudly)
And you?
Dean’s laying across one of the motel beds, passed out and still wearing the outfit we last saw him in at the bar. Sam opens the door with a sigh, sweaty, having just come back from his morning jog. He’s carrying a paper bag of fast food.
Dean sighs, relieved. He lets a smile onto his face. CLOSE ON him and Castiel, finally. Jacting choices demand that Dean caresses Castiel’s face tenderly.
Look what we got here!
(teasing)
Lock the doors and close the blinds
“Dean, why didn’t you say anything?” Cas tilted their head.
Valeria grins, then snaps her fingers and -

DEAN (CONT’D)
TWEEN SAM and TEEN DEAN stand on the sidewalk looking at the (pretty decent) school. Dean stands there for a moment longer before motioning to Sam to get going.
Mary clears her throat. “So, Dean. Did you ever find yourself a lucky lady? I never heard much about your love life when I was alive,” awkward chuckle, “take two.”
Who? Who’s the bad man?
(confused)
JENNY
Cas, come on. You gotta know, we care about you. Him-
Name’s Dean. I’ve been trying to talk to you, in case you didn’t notice.
“So, hey Cas. I hear you’re, y’know, not dead.” The wind is as good encouragement as any for him to keep going. “I, uh, wanted to talk to you. Y’know, ‘bout what you said before- you- you

EILEEN
Dean walks in through the door, bell dinging quietly under the music. He grabs some prepackaged sandwich crap, barbeque chips, a bottle of soda, and styrofoam plates and plastic utensils. He also grabs a generous case of beer. He walks over to the register and smiles grimly, his eyes still a bit puffy and red. The CASHIER gives him a look that says “Oh boy, another alcoholic mess,” then dings him up.
How could I resist? Being in the presence of the most powerful transformer?
AMARA
Castiel tilts his head.
Love.
Dean breaks out in hysterical laughter. Castiel chuckles low and quiet. Sam enters and has a reasonable amount of confusion on his face.
Dean finishes off his whiskey and gestures to the bartender for another drink. Rudy waves too.
Floaty!
Oh, well that’s not good.
“No,” Michael questioned, “You aren’t a Reaper… or Death either, yet you wield that power. Unknowingly, and clearly lacking in skill, but you have it.” Michael seemed satisfied, and he took in another breath before the glowing eyes and boom Adam. Just like that. Adam was free, in control. “I thought we’d have to kill another Reaper or something,” he chuckled. No one else laughed. “Uh, well, let’s go get em.”

FLASH FORWARD / MONTAGE : Camera rotates around Dean deliriously, with a bit of blur.
What if you were in this situation with Eileen, huh? Would you be calm?
Dean’s face falls immediately and looks at Jack. A beat passes before he tries to respond.
(so drunk)
It’s cute.
JERRY
Cas. Not-”
They think you’re vital too, Dean. We’ve already looked everywhere, done every spell to track them down, nothing, okay?
Sam shakes his head minutely, still confused.
Look, I’ll tell you all about it later. I just came here, saw Jack, asked him what the hell, and here we are. Do not wake him up, he deserves this.
(confused)
Castiel nods solemnly. Dean runs his hand over his face.
CASTIEL
Sam’s right, Dean is wearing the same jacket. At least he has the tack to have changed everything else.
(sighs)
The three Djinn roll their eyes, but comply. Djinn One and Two get up from their chairs, and Jack sits down patiently in one of them. Djinn Two starts tying him up while Jerry and Djinn One sigh and watch.
CASTIEL
Sam, Dean, and Eileen step out of the Impala and walk around it in sync to get to the trunk. They pull out their silver blades covered in blood and nod at each other, ready to set their plan into motion. CUT TO closer on the warehouse, with Sam, Dean, and Eileen stalking towards a door half broken off its hinges.
THE EMPTY (CONT’D)
To the thing.
Dean looks at Sam, searching his expression for what kind of hippie emotional talk was in store. He sighs, nods, then calls out to Jack, on the other side of the War Room.
“OH MY FUCKING GOD-”
GLENN
“You may now-”
Yeah. So I’m figuring we bust in there, I try to get the victims out, and you salt and burn the guy.
Castiel and DOCTOR ACKLES walk through the hallway towards Cassandra’s room. As they do, they converse:
Too important to us, we’d be lost without you
CASTIEL
Losing something like that... something you always thought would be there, something you felt was a part of you, it’s unimaginably difficult. I’m so sorry, Cassandra.
Dean, I don’t understand-
Cas, Cas, it’s not real. It’s me. You’re okay.
(clears throat)
Don’t go into any vampire nests with rebar spikes.

Eternity to be married. Eternity to make amends. Eternity to love, unashamed.
We can-
“No. You can’t pull the father card on me either, because you know who raised me?

Dean steps forward to watch, but is frozen otherwise.
Let’s go home.
SLOW PAN and FOCUS SHIFT to the doorway, where Dean was leaning against the door frame, watching, unnoticed. We get the feeling that he’s been there the whole time. He’s teary eyed, and he flees the scene.
After all I think we both know who’s more important to him. I’ll give you three guesses. The kid he’s been raising for eh, three years? Or the kid brother he’s looked after, raised, fed and changed his little diaper, since he was four.
EILEEN
Cas had heard vague mumblings, but was edging in and out of consciousness so much he couldn't tell which were dreams. Something about good to have you back, memory foam mattress, and I hope you don’t mind this bed, I assume we’ll be using it together. It was Dean’s voice, but clearly Cas was dreaming about his regrets, because those words used together implied something that Cas could never have.
Shit. I’m sorry, Jack.
Eileen steps in front of Sam, just slightly, sizing up Amara. She looks back to Sam, who signs “A-M-A-R-A” to her. Eileen looks back at Amara.
Dean scratches the back of his neck nervously, and pulls out a

Cool and Dirnt.
You and- and Cas. You always saw through my shit, right? No matter how hard I pretended.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - BEAVER CITY - NIGHT
She snaps, and Castiel is freed from the bounds. He stands up to walk over to Dean (and Sam, still passed out). Tears stream down Dean’s face, where the duct tape is still worked over his mouth.
Since when is this...?
Shit, sorry. I know you’re concerned about it being real and I haven’t given you the full story, then assuming we’re still, y’know, together I just-

Glenn looks at Dean, betrayal and anger seeping through. John advances on Glenn and lands a punch to his jaw.
It’s okay.
Dean’s the one that leans back in for a proper kiss. It starts getting heated, and when Dean’s thinking about taking it further- adding tongue and all that- Cas just steps back like he’s been burned.

DJINN TWO
Oh, no, this little guy?
Damn, Sam thought, so many things make so much more sense now.
We were just wondering if anything was out of the ordinary the day of Jenny’s disappearance. Strange behavior, smells, little weird things that might clue us in on what happened?
Lucifer’s eyes and Queen Valeria’s tattoos glow. They stare into the distance smiling mischievously, then share a look with each other.
That breaks something in Dean, who glares at Sam with a truly broken expression.
Jerk.
For what!?

Her husband, another good-christian-looking man, walks into the living room from the kitchen - VICTOR BROWN.

Okay well, we thought we beat Chuck, it was fake- and so Jack fake became the new god, it was Chuck wearing his face, then Dean died in a vamp nest-
“You’re gonna drink me out of businesss, boy,” Ellen snarks, with that stupid real concern behind her eyes. Doesn’t matter.
Yeah, and what if someone else dies before tomorrow?
. But she’s right- no no, she’s wrong! Dean’s fine.
Not a lay, apparently.
What, uh, what Chuck said was that he kept trying to get us away from each other. Had to... kill you off. Do- do you remember that? It’s all fuzzy and fake in my head.
I think you know, Glenn. Whatever it was, you and Dean were friends. You trust him. And there’s bad blood, but I promise you he’s not homophobic if that’s what you’re hung up on.
With a grim smile she motions at Sam and Dean to enter. They do.
Stupid that you left Cas, I would’ve- could’ve said it back.
Get this-
Sam heaves a deep sigh. Oh, to be the only one with a brain cell. Cas stares at Dean firmly, while he averts his eyes. Jack’s oblivious, as always.
What does that mean?

Lucifer twists the knife in the demon’s hand, causing it to growl and scream again.

Glenn’s sitting at a table intensely reading into some history textbook. There are notebooks, sticky notes, and all colors of pens dumped across the table, severely unorganized. He goes out of focus in the foreground, and we see Sam and Dean enter the library. Dean ruffles Sam’s hair and sends him off into the shelves, while he saunters over to Glenn.

Dean doesn’t look away from Jack. His face clearly says “no, everything is not back in order. This fucking sucks.”

Every now and again after that, when Jack wasn’t busy, they’d have family dinners with him, Cas, and Jack. He was going through a dinosaur phase, Dean learned. It caused a shiny warmth in his stomach every time he learned something about the kid, because he was still so innocent in many ways. He asked about what to do as God and that’s definitely not in the parenting books, but…
Dean shakes his head and scoffs. “Not possible, Ellen. It’s heaven, you can’t run out of liquor.”
But when we came back an hour later, she was gone. Maybe god punished her- oh, I don’t know!
Gnngha?

I’m just saying, I took care of the ghosts and that was it. I’m not- not traumatized or some shit by Riverton. It was just-

God, they like the sound of their own voices.
How did you know?
BLACKOUT.
What’s happening to me
"Stop!' Sam yelled, covering his ears. "Stop! I'm happy for you! I'm going to go bleach my brain out," he said, fleeing the kitchen. He had to tell Eileen this.
SAM (O.S.)
...Yeah, that. Then- then he told me something. We- we were in between a rock and a hard place, trapped, and he said... He said I was the most caring man he’d ever met. Told me he-
Look, Dean, we gotta talk about what you’ve been doing.
“Death?” Dean asked, appalled. He'd sobered up a little but really wasn't in any state to be doing world-saving. Due to the alcohol. Only the alcohol. Dean took his time glaring at every one of them. “Death.”
Sam’s eyebrows are doing a little dance, going up then down to squint at Dean. He still doesn’t get it.
So what can we do?
The Djinn drag each hunter to another room, stringing them up in chains on their hands mechanically. Dean manages to regain a bit of consciousness and he struggles, but to no avail. The three of them swing minutely from side to side as the song fades out.
Just more “god save our child,” and “I hope she’s forgiven for her sins,” and a dash of “boo hoo hoo, my daughter’s going to hell,” just for flavor.
When the silence stretches, Jack turns to look at Dean, troubled.

Jack’s sitting watching scooby doo with attentive fascination, petting Miracle absently. It’s very Cas, which stings Dean right in the heart.

Castiel smiles at fond memories, then decides on one to share.

“I don’t know, but I have something… promising?” Jack said, more of a question than a suggestion. “I’ve been killing plants all around me just by touching them. Does-” Jack looked around, silenting asking if they were being useful, being good, doing the right thing- or maybe Dean was just projecting. “Does that mean anything?”
Dean crosses his arms petulantly.

“I was gonna, but I was too busy trying to convince you I wasn’t under a witch’s curse!” Dean says, defensively.
Dean steps forward.

Are we getting close?
Why are you acting different?
Maybe they’re on a joyride tour. Lucifer’s got his wings, it’s not like transportation is a problem.

Ha, no. He just bounced around in the car, jumped from one side to the other, then just-
Last time, we got a good dose of Saileen and some fatherly Dean. We also found out a little more about the Djinn situation. This time, we're going on a case, featuring the dead gay nuns.

So, uh, either of you gonna explain the history here or-

Sorry for the inconsistent updates, but for now, this is all I got! Next episode will probably come easier but that does not mean we're getting any kind of professional consistent schedule here.

A few more spins around, and an EXTREME CLOSE UP on Dean’s eyes, the shot blurry and shaking.
Dean, shirtless (go crazy fangirls), stares achingly into the mirror at the handprint scar on his shoulder. He stays that way for a long moment, then puts his hand over the handprint, closing his eyes.
Dean stops in his tracks, Meg doing the same. He snaps.
There’s a little amused smile (well, the cheek muscles are used), but tears are still streaming down his face. There’s nothing really happy about him.
I won’t deny I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone
Sam shrugs, and smiles giddily, signing back:
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe I should work with her instead. She must be more competent.
Trust me now?
“I’m serious, boy,” Ellen snaps, “if you’re doing this for you, you’re not ready, sure, I get that. But you wanna convince yourself that after all you’ve been through he doesn’t want you? Have fun smelling that cheap whiskey in your stomach from just how far your head has been lodged up your ass.” Ellen glares daggers into Dean, and he really has no choice but to listen. She can be intimidating as hell.

It’s really a depressing scene, and Dean looks the part. He sighs. When the work is done, he dumps the broken glass into the trash can and sits on his bed, rubbing his hands over his face and sighing.
17-year-old Dean digs up the grave, INTERCUT with present day Dean finagling the stone block up.
FAKE DEAN
What do you want?
Please don’t hang your head and cry
There’s
Look, I just said that the Queen is getting over here in a couple hours. Do you Winchesters know patience, or is that one of the things daddy forgot to teach you?
So, either of you guys gonna fill me in or am I just gonna have to keep guessing?
Robert tries to hide behind a nearby building and catch his breath, but it’s no use. Pastor John appears there and digs his nails into Robert’s face before he can override his freeze response. He groans and yells out in pain, struggling for a good beat. He then manages to break free and get out onto the street to keep running.
The hell are you doing here? What does Chuck-
Well, don’t go falling in love with me.
Lucifer pops into frame on beat just to shove the demon’s head back and hold it there. It would definitely break it’s neck if it weren’t a demon. It’s eyes flick to black.
“Now that Amara and Chuck are fused, they’ll be harder to take down. But, we don’t really need to. We just need to stall them long enough to be able to banish them to the Empty.”
Yeah, I remember everything up until I died. Don’t remember my soul going anywhere though, heaven or hell.
They don’t. “Ah, fuck. This is hard.”
DEAN (CONT’D)
Lucifer is getting angry. Uh oh.
DEMON
Let’s see how hell is doing.
Yeah, isn’t it?
I know.
Sure.
Jack is escorted in by Castiel. He jumps up onto the bed with Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy in hand, pouting. Castiel finds a chair to sit down on.
(to Cas and Dean)
Dean shouts, shaking his head and leaning back down into the bed as more tears fall. He runs his hands over his head and through his hair.

CASTIEL
I lost my best friend.
Do you? Have feelings for me?
“Boy, you really had me going!” He heaves another surprised laugh then calms down slowly, letting out small bursts of guffaws every few seconds before he stops entirely. “That was one hell of a prank, Dean. I believed it for a second! Man, so one night stands only? Still that man-whore you were like in your twenties?” Disturbing mirth dances around in John’s eyes, and some sort of twisted pride.
It showed up after we got back from Heaven, okay? I figured it was something with the way Cas summoned the Empty, or a cruel joke from Chuck. It’s nothing, alright?
Dean smiles and instinctively tries to hide it by ducking his head, then forces himself to stare back at Jack head-on. The kid deserves to know that he makes Dean happy. “Well, ignore those douchebags. Except Cas, always listen to your dad.”
MUSIC (V.O.)

“As I stated before, you don’t have to say anything, Dean.” Cas looks at him, tilting his head and giving him regretful baby blue puppy-dog eyes.

Jack nods eagerly. Sam and Eileen smile at each other, then lean in for a quick kiss.
Um, what do you know about the attackers? Can you tell us what you saw, what happened?
Remember to let him into your heart,
Through the hole in your belly
...Dude, gross!
Dean sighs.
“What? Not my fault he was obvious. So what’s the problem, he clearly loves you back, right?” She faces Dean with an expectant expression.
“Go get your man, you dumbass! And don’t you be coming back here until you do!” Ellen whacks Dean with a bar towel and stares. When he doesn’t move- not Dean’s fault he was in shock- she raises her eyebrow and gestures towards the door. “I gotta tell you twice?”
EXT. QUAINT NEIGHBORHOOD - RIVERTON - MORNING

What the hell.

"I love you."
Eileen shifts uncomfortably in the beats of silence that follow. She’s clearly being ignored in this big brotherly moment. She can’t excuse herself now, though, that’d draw too much attention, so she suffers through it. Dean shakes his head, with that look on his face that he’s above it all, that he knows better and he’s not willing to share.
A little.
“Jesus kid, you scared the life out of me.”
You wanna hear it all?

Amara nods.

JACK (O.S.)

What?
Castiel appears behind Dean (seriously, why always there? Is it to check out his ass or what?) with a whoosh. He forces Dean by the shoulder to look at him, and starts pulling at limbs and shit to do a full Doctor Sexy exam. It’s not all that sexy.
I love him.

Hi. This is a nice hotel.
A blue tattooed hand reaching at an OLD GUEST’s face, clawing its way down their cheek.
Well, after you fizzled out we kinda lived on. Then we died. Then it turns out it was all fake, except my own s- uh, death.
Castiel laughs, but there’s an edge to it that makes it sound hollow. “
DEAN: I– It’s alright. Goodbye, Missouri. Thank you.
“Yeah. Yeah it does.“ Benny agrees quietly. He pauses, before looking at Dean questioningly. “So, boss… what’s the plan now?”
MISSOURI: Have I been before?
DEAN: Hey, benny… thank you. I’m so sorry to have to do this to you.
MISSOURI: (sighs) That boy… he’s a hard one to read with that little bit of angel still in him and all, but… oh, honey I’m so sorry. I truly am.
“I’m so sorry, kiddo. I’m so sorry,” he breathes, and she shakes her head where it rests against him. He knows how much this must be hurting her, and he can’t even consider how much he must be disappointing her, how it feels like he’s letting down another sibling all over again–so he just lets his mind wander elsewhere. He thinks of anything else as he kisses the top of her head and holds her there for as much time as they can spare. At least he gets a goodbye this time. He didn’t get one with Sam. Finally, aware of the ticking clock, Dean pulls away. “Take care of yourself, Charlie,” he says sincerely. “I love you.”
“Don’t–you can’t just say that like that makes this alright. You don’t even know how much I… I love you, Cas,” Dean pleads, “so you can’t just give up. You can’t. We have to fight this. You said we’d face this together, remember? You promised.”
“We’ll find him, Dean. We will.” The smile on her face is meant to be reassuring, but Dean can see straight through her. The hours pass unforgivingly, and they’re all losing faith in the outcome of their search. Dean scrubs a hand over his face and takes a deep breath before shifting the truck into gear and starting it up.
JODY: Dean, croats 12 o’clock.
We’re coming Cas, we’re gonna find you. I’m so sorry this is taking so long, Cas, I–
That’s why you’ve been... bitter. I mean, among other reasons. With dad-
"Rise and shine," Sam chuckled as Dean shambled his way into the kitchen, donning only his dead guy's robe and some sweatpants. Speaking of exposed skin (that Sam really didn't need to see)...

Dean shakes it off, trying not to look into his eyes because he’s aware that if left to their own devices, they’ll make Dean spill every secret he’s ever known. Probably even the pink panty thing.
I... I think I just got conversion therapy from a homophobic pastor. Ghost. Pastor ghost.
Dean huffed out a laugh before reaching out to wrap his arms around Cas from the chair he sat at. “You’re in my bed, I hope you don’t mind,” he murmured. Lost in the feeling of warmth, real, human warmth, Cas didn’t think about what humans who have proclaimed their love typically do in beds.

Castiel looks down at his feet, guilty.
Ssshit. We gotta go.
We’re not broken.
Jerry blinks. Then blinks again. What?
Dean’s mouth struggles. Queen Valeria is surprised when he manages to open it.
AMARA (CONT’D)
Thanks, agents.
Sam gives his signature bitchface to Eileen, who smiles despite, well, the entire situation around them.

DEAN (CONT’D)
Oh holy shit.
No, no, I do. I do, okay? When the angels fell, I was so caught up in Sam and my own little bubble- I didn’t even think about it. I just thought, oh, okay, he can’t teleport anymore.
Dean waves and cuts him off, smiling. “Don’t worry Sammy, I got this.”
“I sat there for hours, you know. Hearing your speech over and over again. I hated- I still hate myself for not saying anything back.”
THE EMPTY
AMARA
He lets out another laugh while Dean stares in horror, grasping Cas’ hand like a lifeline. Cas squeezes gently back, trying to be reassuring.
“And before you leave, by the way,” Sam starts, “I’ve got my own shit with you.”
“Dean.”
WIDE SHOT of: Dean’s carrying Castiel’s unconscious body across the dirt to the Impala, Jack, Sam, and Eileen following behind. Amara’s already standing beside the Impala. PAN CLOSER as TFW gets closer to the car.
And what would that be?
Lucifer reaches the actual bar, where there’s a half-dead guy crawling away from a tipped over stool. He kicks them once, twice, and then again just for good measure.
Valeria turns to Castiel and smiles softly. Amp up the creep music, we’re realizing what she wants with him.
he’s getting married to that man. Cas steps next to Dean and reaches out his hands, which he eagerly accepts, holding tightly, probably harmfully if it weren’t for the fact that they’re in Heaven.
That you then inflicted was par for the course just as when you were living
None of your business.
SAM’s walking through the hallway, head slumped to look at his phone. He’s typing again, happily texting somebody. (We all know it’s Eileen)
Gross!
All right kid, Dean Cave?
I mean, nothing, mostly. I just... When Chuck decided I should live on, I had a hard time without you, Dean. I just want my brother back.

Sam jumps to action and starts untying Jenny, the closest, from the rebar spikes. EXTREME CLOSE UP on the now un-roped rebar, then cut to Dean’s gaze. Sam notices.
Back on the road with my brother for me.

Again, just the wind responds. He sighs, and opens his mouth to continue.
Jack nods excitedly. Dean’s grin goes away as he faces Sam and Eileen for a moment.
I’m not telling you jack shit!

Dean stumbles off the bed as he drinks more, shattering a beer bottle and crushing a can with his feet.
Yeah... recent events, y’know, what’s the point? Lie to yourself, feel more manly, feel like shit, never give the one person- never give him a chance.
Look, father! I got a case notification!
Yes, Jack, you can get a lullaby.
Yes. Like I felt the pull with the handprint.

Especially. When you were gone- he was just exhausted. Didn’t care about things the way he normally did. So we- he- is glad you’re back.
I’m not gonna turn into dad, alright?
ANGLE ON the bunker door as it squeaks open. Dean stops in his tracks when he looks around. SLOW PAN to the War Room, covered in rainbows and bi pride flags along with balloons and streamers and all that gay festivity.
Dr Ackles winks and that’s about when Dean snaps. He drags Cas away from Ackles by the arm and gives the meanest death glare imaginable.
"Since last night. Which was a great night, wanna know what Cas can do with-"

It was some field that they chose to do this in. Dean didn’t care enough to pay attention to more than his own part of the plan. He had his own plan.

Heyy Jaack.

Sam and Eileen exchange a look of “well, that’s not looking good for us,” and we -
Sam blinks a few times. That was unhelpful.
AAAAAAHHHH! AHHH! Please, please stop! Please!
Where is Sam, by the way?
As they’re almost there, the goo stretches to try and reach them. It’s close, and it touches Castiel's shoulder, rips the trenchcoat, but Dean shoves Cas through the portal. He’s gone. Dean follows after him.
DEAN (CONT’D)
MEG (O.S.)
“You are one dumb son of a bitch,” Ellen says. Dean whips his head up and glares at her.
I can’t just let you go in there alone. You think I was ever the same when you’ve died?
Dean was kissing Cas, and Cas kissed back, having forgotten to close his eyes per human customs. He instinctively caressed Dean's face and pulled him in close. Their eyes fluttered shut anyway due to the sensation. But Cas had to know more, had to talk, as annoying as that was. They pushed Dean away with a hand on his chest.
(tense)
Cas- Do you know what I did after you died?

After Mary takes a messy bite, she turns to Sam and Eileen. “So, how’d you two meet?”
It was subtle, y’know. Something that could’ve gone either way but... I respected what you had going on with him. Whatever that was.
(giggles)
“It’s just- y’know, hard to say? How’d you come off so goddamned elegant when it was your turn?”
Jack pouts. Miracle runs off and out of the kitchen.
You ever think I don’t want to share every detail of my life with my annoying-ass little brother?
Cas is stone faced but there’s definitely humor dancing around in his little blue eyes. Dean smiles a little but schools his expression down.
Great.
Eileen’s watching Sam from the passenger’s seat to read his lips with an understanding and concerned expression on her face. Sam seems kind of heavy-hearted.
FAKE DEAN
Anyway, we’re here to investigate these murders. They’re the same perpetrators we’ve seen across the nation.

Do you think he’ll change his mind?
Yeah. Yeah, you can.
Castiel falls unconscious onto Dean. Dean pulls Cas into his lap and checks him over, then looks at Sam, wide-eyed with a sliver of hope.
Glenn looks at Robert, silently communicating. Robert nods and goes into the house.
A tense moment of silence passes, then Sam clears his throat and signs to Eileen:
Jack jumps up and spreads his arms out wide, then, for flair, he spins once.
“Haha.” Dean chuckles. “I’m not a spitter-”
She smirks. It’s only a little (a lot) terrifying.
SMASH CUT TO:
CASTIEL
I don’t know, I think I lost him.
Sam doesn’t say anything, just staring at Eileen lovingly. She looks at him back expectantly and oh - right. Sam’s supposed to be answering a question.
Cas shakes his head, caressing Dean’s face with tenderness despite his calloused fingertips. “He doesn’t hate you. He hates that you made him realize what he’s done.”
(chuckles)
The guest is cut off as they SCREAM. The blue tattooed hand reaches back and impales the guest’s neck with each finger. The hand is pulled back. The blood wipes off on a dress. The guest falls to the ground, creating a pool of blood, their dead eyes staring into the distance.
FULL ON MEG AND DEAN
I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have snapped like that.
We never saw the money that went down your throat
Thanks for reading this far :)
Mm. I didn’t want to leave you, I didn’t want to be God, I wouldn’t let you die I-
Sam nods reflexively, then blinks quickly. Wait, what?

Oh, and yours is? You were a douchebag to him from the start. It’s a wonder he could even stand you. As I recall, he smiled the most when it was little old me taking care of him in the koo-koo closet. Who cares how long you had, he wouldn’t be happy with you.

Shit. FUCK!

Sam shakes his head and grimaces with uncertainty. He signs:
They took her to the church.
Oh, come on, Jack. There’s gotta be another way.

Uh, not to ruin the party or anything, but I think the Queen said we needed all of them alive for her plans.
Oh, Cas, you’re awake.
Queen Valeria just smiles, and tilts her head to the side, mock consideration.

Bad idea, Robert. He keeps running there, frantically looking behind him to check if anyone’s there.

EILEEN
No clue, Cas. Also no clue why you get special treatment.
It’s not your fault. You came over with a lead, correct? What is it?
Would love to! What’s in it for me, lover boy?
Dean’s plan included jumping into that rift himself and either bringing Cas with him or never leaving Cas again. It wasn’t much of a plan, he knew the Empty was a vast space where nothing could be found if it didn’t want to be, but Dean didn’t care. Fuck all of them, fuck everything, I need to tell him I- It didn’t matter what Dean felt or how thought out this plan was.  Cas was getting back and that sonofabitch was going to live and be free and happy whether he liked it or not.
SLOW ZOOM OUT ON: Queen Valeria is now sitting on a cold stone throne, a really (disgustingly) phenomenal amount of bodies piled up in the room. They’re lying everywhere, on top of each other, mixed with each other, bleeding out on the gray, blank ground.

Sam softens, staring at Eileen with absolute adoration, and signs as he says:
You know a Valeria, Dean?
"We're free." Sam sighed. "We're free."
Sam leans forward to eye it. Dean notices, and pulls his sleeve down again.
Dean! Burn him!

Hey, sweetheart, you want a piece of me too I’m open.
I’m not gay, if that’s what you’re thinking. Women and men, if that’s gonna save my fragile masculinity.
What’s wrong?
Dean parks the car, turning the keys and putting them in his pocket. He turns in his seat and shakes Jack’s shoulder.

Sam waits for Dean to elaborate; he doesn’t.
Sam throws up his hands, sighing exasperatedly. Eileen looks at him with sympathy.
Around 9:30. You didn’t come back until like, 4 am last night.
What-
It’s around now that we realize SHERIFF HANSON has been standing there the whole time. Sam clears his throat and shakes hands with the sheriff.
Honey, who’s this?
The Empty stops smiling and glares at Dean.
To interview the witness, and put as much distance between me and you as possible.
Well, not really. Just... it’s this way.
I’m just a loner baby
(sighs)
Of course, Jack. He’s going to be okay.
(whispering)
Well, yeah, he’s... little now, but his head’s still all in there, right?
No one knows what to say, then. It’s different, with Jack being little. He can get away with a lot more. Dean aggressively scoots back his chair and starts walking out, regret evident on his face.
C’mon, man, you’re gonna need a ride.

“Watch your next words, Dean,” John growls. And inside him, the child he never was is still there, flinching away from John’s next hit, but Dean straightens up, trying not to listen.

“I’m… not?” Jack asked, tilting their head, and Dean smirked for a brief moment before remembering why that brought a smile to his face. He didn’t dare to think the name. Dean didn’t let those thoughts rise farther than the depths hidden and dimmed by the alcohol.
“Son,” Chuck sighed out, “Working with the Winchesters. You know,” Chuck pointed, not really to anything, “these guys used to be my favorite. But they’re so frustrating. Now you? My most loyal child?”
Glenn pauses, considering, but no one’s safe from Sam’s puppy dog eyes. Glenn trusts the Moose, and nods slowly.
Dean snorts. Sam bitchfaces.
Allow me to apologize for my partners. I’m Agent Vedder, these are my associates Irons and Krussen. They’re going through a little... rough patch in their relationship.
Queen Valeria grabs Cas’ arm by the elbow and in a blue flash, they’re GONE. Dean then is able to reach out through the bars, where the runes have gone. He rips off the duct tape on his mouth and gasps, mixed in with sobs.
Now we see everything, it’s LUCIFER dancing through the bodies, bloodied and grinning.
Dean nods solemnly. The handprint is glowing from under his shirt.
Dean chuckles.
Jack gasps.

Mre Brown makes her way over to the couch, then sits down. She dabs her (not very) wet eyes with a tissue and gestures to the chairs across from her. Sam and Dean sit down there.

Dean’s face immediately falls, looking guilty. His cocky attitude took a vacation. He starts to fidget with his necklace (the Samulet). He sits down on the desk next to Glenn.
Jack slides two stakes soaked in lamb’s blood to Dean and Sam, then tosses one to Eileen, getting up out of the half-done rope around him.
