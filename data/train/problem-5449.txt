“He’s not --” Steve choked up at the idea of finding and now losing Tony. He bent over to kiss Tony for the first time, wishing Tony could feel all the love pouring out of him. He’d only known Tony a handful of days, but he already knew that Tony was perfect, the person he’d been looking for all his life. The soulbond was just the cherry on top.
It was terrifying and overwhelming and he had a lot to learn and unlearn about Tony. But the encouraging sound coming from Tony buoyed him up. Steve leaned in and --
And maybe Steve was too eager to grasp at any straw from his past. But Tony was not Howard. Steve had read up on what happened to Howard after the war and he barely recognized the scientist. Tony became the person that Steve thought Howard had been.
The fight against the Chitauri lasted for hours and Steve watched as Tony flew into the wormhole carrying a nuclear bomb. Steve had had a soulmate for barely half a day and now he was close to losing him.
Before Steve recovered his composure, the helicarrier was rocked by an attack. He worked unbelievably well with Tony, almost reading his mind as they raced to fix the engine. For the first time since he woke from the ice, Steve had a purpose and a friend-in-arms who understood him.
He didn’t know that Iron Man came with his own soundtrack, like the movies Steve had seen recently. “Mr. Stark,” he said to Iron Man.
Steve could hear sad notes -- Tony’s disappointment, sadness, rejection. “You don’t like me,” he said.
What they all had been taught growing up was that sound was just sound, until you met your soulmate and a whole new world of richer sound opened up. Steve had gotten a glimpse of that world when the serum enhanced his hearing. He could now hear people talking in the next room as if they were standing next to him.
The doctor paused and then smiled fondly. “It’s like -- walking through a door and finding out that all you knew before was -- dull, colorless, flat, mute. The whole world is richer, filled with music ...” She sighed and shrugged. “It’s also different for everyone, I’ve been told. Hard to explain. It’s the difference between a tin kazoo and a full orchestra.”
Alarms blared through the light-drenched city streets as local cops and SHIELD agents flooded the crime scenes. A steady stream of information came over Steve’s earpiece. Stark hustled the alien, Loki, into the SHIELD quinjet under the agreement they were taking him back to a SHIELD base.
Steve could almost hear the futuristic sound of the armor flying through the air when he watched videos of Iron Man in action. The armor was gorgeous from an artistic standpoint and was clearly the product of years of innovation. The man in the armor was significantly less impressive, as far as Steve could tell. Flashy, undisciplined, unprepared for fights that he couldn’t solve with a repulsor beam.
Steve’s stomach flipped and his knees were wobbly. There was only one explanation. The difference between a tin kazoo and a full orchestra.
Steve was unromantic. He had hopes, of course. Mostly simple ones of getting to serve his country, returning home and having a family of his own. But those dreams were a stretch for him before the serum and, strangely, less likely than after getting the serum.
The traffic was so much louder, music blaring from windows and cars and from performers on street corners, sirens cutting through the air. Buildings were loud with the electronic hum of running appliances and air conditioning. He had not expected his seat to be rocked in the movie theatre from the deafening soundtrack.
“I hear that all the time when I work with people with hearing aids. Every single one who doesn’t have a soulmate jokes that getting a hearing aid is like meeting your soulmate. But it isn’t, I know.”
Well, the Army WAC -- actually the SHIELD agent — hadn’t lied to him. He had been in a recovery room in New York as she said. She had just conveniently left out the current year and day and time. The SHIELD personnel had tried to acclimate him with familiar sounds like the baseball game and the traffic.
Afterwards, he found Tony in the empty bay where Loki had stabbed Coulson. It should have been quiet except for the usual helicarrier noise. He paused, seeing Tony studying the floor.
. That is amazing.” Steve stepped forward and raised a hand, stopping himself before he got to close.
Tony shivered and pulled his blanket tighter. Whatever he’d felt when the nanites first overtook him was nothing to how it felt when they’d retreated, leaving him unprotected in the snow as they spread out to wall them in under the rock. A constellation of blue dots blasted pin pricks of heat, but he’d barely felt it. That was when Steve began to shed his gear. And not long after that, everything went black.
“Oh.” Steve’s gaze traveled down to their hands, still joined like it was the most natural thing in the world. “And you…” Steve’s voice caught in his throat like something far more terrifying than ice had frozen his tongue.
“Okay, 1: Smartass,” Tony pointed at Steve, “and 2: Traitor,” he waved his finger around the room in a general gesture to FRIDAY. “And I’ll have you know, that toaster was burning
“Steve?” Tony pulled himself to his feet, but he was still finding his balance after nearly freezing to death and keeled forward, his chest leaning heavily on the bed rail. The hand on Steve’s forehead stroked back through his hair and the other … well, now he was holding Steve Rogers’ hand, and what might have seemed mildly wrong and awkward a few years ago couldn’t have felt more right. “Steve?”
Tony set the book down and leaned forward in his chair, eyes trained on Steve. They’d been through so much since Fury assembled his ragtag team of heroes on a helicarrier all those years ago and all Tony wanted was to go through more. Now. In the future. Maybe forever if the science worked out.
“I know that one. He’s off scaring the bejezus out of some new Air Force recruits. What about you? No rest for the star-spangled?”
Her eyes glistened as she shook her head, a near silent “No,” on her lips as she walked back to him, bent down to wrap an arm around his body and kissed the top of his head. “But it wasn’t for lack of trying.” Tony laid a hand over her arm, and they just sat there, holding each other for a moment, a tiny salute to the things they’d been to each other over the years. And then she coughed, pulled away and straightened up.
Yeah. He had a vague memory of waking in a panic that he couldn’t quite explain. But Rhodey and Wilson were there, and when he’d calmed down they’d filled in the blanks as best they could. Honestly, Tony barely remembered what they’d said, but he supposed the whos hows and whys didn’t really matter at this point. A disgruntled underling. A fake alarm. Sabotage. A crash.
“Captain Rogers is improving.” The doctor kept talking, but Tony could barely hear him over his own breaths, coming easily and fully for maybe the first time since he’d woken up.
The heating coils and thermal blankets had been removed. He was breathing on his own, and his heart rate was strong and steady. The only sign that anything had been wrong was an IV dripping warm saline into his veins. He just needed to wake up. The medical team had pored over the SHIELD notes from the first thawing. Tony’d caught a glimpse in FRIDAY’s logs, but it was all just a little too much biology for him, and for not the first time, he’d found himself wishing Bruce were still around.
And then he saw it. Right after a dark image of Vision, illuminated only by the glow of his stone, was himself rendered in a scratchy sketch and carrying an armful of supplies to the compound’s kitchen table. A tomato teetered on the edge of a container of roast beef and it seemed like so long ago that he’d shifted his balance just in time to keep it from falling to the floor.
No one would tell him much about Steve. Just that he was alive, and they were warming him back up, but it was a little more complicated than SHIELD’s notes implied. That left FRIDAY’s logs as his real source of information. He studied the data points until it painted a picture of Steve dressing him, leaning back against the flat side of the rock because there wasn’t room to stand and pulling Tony close. For a while, he coordinated with FRIDAY.
Tony rose from his seat and spun Steve off of his stool, giving him just barely enough time to snatch up a sketchbook, pencil and pickle spear as he dragged him to his personal lab.
“Okay, okay,” Rhodey said. “Just sit back down for a second.” Rhodey gave the gentlest of nudges and Tony found himself back in bed. “Sit tight, and I’ll have Sam rustle up a wheelchair-”
Of course, what wasn’t said was whether anyone would find them in time. But it must have been enough to ease Steve’s mind, because for a while he was silent. FRIDAY worked in the background, monitoring their conditions, coaxing the nanites into new positions for better heat dispersal and trying to amplify the suit’s signal.
They hadn’t made it far before a doctor trailed by what looked like a team of medical students rounded a corner.
Steve dropped his hand on Tony’s shoulder and let his slide down across his bicep and his elbow in one motion. Usually being in the suit came with a feeling of disconnect. Like he was fighting from inside a garbage can. But on this suit, FRIDAY adjusted the haptic sensors, and even though Tony had an idea of what to expect, nothing could quite compare to buzz of Steve’s light touch as he continued down Tony’s arm, stopping at his wrist.
Steve motioned Tony forward, and as soon as he was within reaching distance, Steve grabbed his shirt in a fist and pulled him close, planting a kiss directly on his lips. Open mouth. With some tongue. Enough to leave Tony breathless as his grip relaxed and Steve pulled away, a mild flush to his cheeks.
Tony let out an involuntary gasp as the nanobytes began slithering up his legs. Around his torso. Across his shoulders and down his arms. It was like being tangled in ropes and submerged in water, and if he hadn’t lived the life he’d had, it might have just been a curious sensation, but as it began to travel up his neck, he could feel a tinge of panic in his chest. He focused on Steve’s eyes, got lost in the blue and felt a moment’s calm before the mask covered his face, shrouding everything in darkness. Tony swallowed and breathed through his nose.
“Well, for starters we’re not on war rations or in The Great Depression,” Tony said as he swiped at the squeeze bottle of yellow mustard. “Tell you what, stick a pin in that, and I’ll make you a real sandwich.”
She nodded and squeezed his hand before rising. “On it.” She hadn’t been gone long before the door opened and Rhodey pushed a wheelchair into the room.
“Oh, you’re very funny,” Rhodey said as he maneuvered through the room and helped Tony into the chair and rolled him to the door.”
“Great! Hit me!” Tony pounded a spot on his chest and Steve shook his head before winding back and delivering a blow. It staggered Tony back a few steps but the program anticipated the hit and adjusted the new sensors to compensate.
Tony wheeled his chair closer to Steve’s bedside. He reached a hand out, stopping just over Steve’s as a wave of uncertainty hit. Something about it chilled him more than the cold had, but he was close enough to feel the space between them, like a radiant heat or a static charge building up. Whatever it was, it gave him what he needed to lower his hand, sliding his fingers over Steve’s until the tips touched the sheet.
Tony winced and reached a hand to the back of his head. There was still a tender spot and a distinct lack of full memory. Rhodey had said something about an explosion and bailing out of the jet. Tony closed his eyes. He remembered wind and a free fall and smashing into something mid-air.
But when had he believed in fate? Tony tapped the button and watched the black screen fade up on an image of Steve sitting with his back against the rock wall. He hadn’t expected to see himself. And yet, there he was, leaning against Steve’s chest, eyes closed with the top half of Steve’s uniform backward, stretched out and covering them like a blanket.
“That,” Tony said as he flung open the doors, “is the Mark-I’ve-Lost-Count.” An Iron Man suit — mostly red with gold accents at the torso, joints and thighs stared back at them from behind a shimmering forcefield of pinks and blues.
“Don’t feel bad,” he said. “I’d do this…I’d do it a thousand times for you. I’d burn up in the sun. I’d walk through lava or swim through acid. Because all I want is for you to make it. For you to be happy. Please…
“Hey, you decent - aw crap” Rhodey rushed over got his hands under Tony’s arms and hauled him back into bed. “Where you going, man?”
Pepper kept him distracted for almost an hour. At first they didn’t talk, she just took Rhodey’s place in the chair next to the bed and laid a hand over his, rubbing her thumb across his skin like she was desperate to believe he was real.
“OK,” Rhodey said. “We’ll see what we can find, and in the meantime, you have a visitor.” He stepped to the door and opened it wide. She was on the other side, red-eyed and dressed in a blue business suit that didn’t match the haphazard tie back of her hair.
“You know, I think it might be best if I just sat down over there-” Steve pointed to the couch in the corner, “and observed. I promise to be sufficiently wowed when you tell me to be.”
“It does, doesn’t it? Except-” Tony flipped a switch and the forcefield disappeared. They watched as the suit collapsed into a puddle of metallic dots at the bottom of the container.
The next several screens of data was comprised of scrambled code. Numbers, letters and symbols stared back at him until Tony brought the laptop’s camera close to his face and entered a few keystrokes. A light shined in his eye and when he’d blinked away its effects, the code was unscrambling and reforming into a video player. His hand paused over the space bar as Tony became acutely aware of how little anyone had actually told him about Steve. A part of him worried that watching his potential last words would tempt fate too much.
The biggest reason for their location though, was that it allowed him to go through them when he wanted to. For some reason Steve finding out that every once in a while Tony would go to that tote and go all waxing poetic over the letters was mortifying.
“Hugo, huh?” He had been brought in as a stray. He was also used to living in a home and was good with people.
Steve frowned. “I’m sure it’s a little outdated, but is it really that bad?” He looked so disappointed that Tony immediately felt guilty. It was a sweet name back in the 40’s after all. Of course Steve would like and want to use it. Like he’d said, he’d never had the chance before.
“Wow, have we really not watched that one yet?” Tony muttered almost to himself. “Looks like a Disney marathon is in our future. But, for now, I’ll rephrase. We’re going on an Iron Man joyride!”
Steve used the dimmer switch in the bathroom to turn the lights on low, and finally set Tony on his feet. He left his arms circled around him and brushed a kiss against his forehead. “You gonna let me take care of my fella now?”
His eyes glinted with enthusiasm as he gestured, orchestrating the holograms as visual aids. It was a wonder that Tony’s mouth could keep up with his brain, his words falling over each other and still somehow intelligible, even though sometimes around mouth fulls of pizza. Steve listened intently, his clear interest in the conversation bolstering Tony on.
The application of the shaving cream wasn’t the best, but it would have to. If Steve got razor burn, well it’d heal before morning.
From then on Tony’s moves were focused on chasing the adrenaline they were both junkies for. Their hearts and guts dropped and lept, while Steve grinned the entire time. Even with Tony’s face hidden by the Iron Man armor Steve knew he was too.
“No, get down. Down! Alright, now just, stay still long enough...” There was the sound of scuffling and what sounded like someone doing a potty dance, and then a clicking of something being fastened. “There. Finally. Alright. Now, sit.”
The two worked out all their silly cackling, and slowly wound down to heavy breaths, huffs and occasional chuckles, sitting side by side in bed and clutching their stomachs.
And then he had felt how rugged they were, and the scope of his interest expanded. They scratched slightly against his skin, and they felt capable. They were capable. They were nimble, and dexterous. And they had a strength that only an engineer as actively involved in his craft could.
Wide brown eyes met his in anticipation, and Steve dipped down to press a line of open mouthed kisses down the column of Tony’s throat.
If Helen Cho was at the tower with the cradle they wouldn’t have to worry about jolting Tony around. But she wasn’t, and by the time she would get there it would be too late.
“Well, you seem to like me okay…” Tony stuck his fingers through to give the dog a little scratch, who leaned into it heavily and looked at Tony. His eyes were shining with intelligence, and a sorrow that reminded him of Steve.
“I second that.” Tony replied grimly. Hugo still hadn’t moved except to tilt his head to the side. Tony crouched down on the cement floor and tilted his head to mirror Hugo’s. “Hey, buddy.”
“Shit. Steve.” Tony growed, and bent forward to mouth against Steve’s back. In addition to the physical bliss he felt relieved. Steve was there. Steve was in one piece. Steve was alive.
Strips of cum painted Steve’s stomach and up to his chest. He took in every bit of Tony. The way his eyebrows scrunched together, and his cock jerked free in the air with his release. It was perfect, and Steve let go of his self control. His hips bucked off beat and then he held Tony flush against his lap, groaning deep and reverberating. As he expended his release, dick throbbing with it, he went from wound tight to a boneless puddle of satisfaction.
Tony tipped his head back and laughed. “Don’t count on it, oh Captain America the great and righteous.”
“What the hell Tony?!” Limbs flew and Tony flittered backwards, dropping the razor and putting his hands behind his back innocently.
The rustling sound of fabric told Steve Tony was removing his own clothes, and then he was pressed hot against Steve’s back. It unwound some of Steve’s tension, enough that Tony felt it, and he murmured, “that’s it, big guy. I’ve got you.”
Before Steve could make it to the bathroom Tony paused and half turned. “But, Steve.” Steve halted, and his face fell as if expecting Tony to drop some awful condition. “If you ever swap out our bedsheets you’re sleeping on the couch.”
“The sexual tension between the two of you could write it’s own erotic novel.” Pepper declares one day, and causes Tony to nearly topple off the stool he’s perched on.
By the fifth pass Tony was so turned on he could have rubbed himself off over his jeans. But that wasn’t nearly as fun as what he could do instead.
Steve shifted in his sleep and Tony went still and wide eyed. The super soldier promptly settled, but Tony still didn’t move until his own heartbeat slowed down.
Shamelessly, Tony lay on his stomach, a cushion under his hips to elevate his ass, and his head pillowed on his arms. He was trusting, while Steve was apprehensive.
“Shuddup.” Steve pushed Tony so he fell sideways on the bed before (heading) to the bathroom. “Just be careful, you might wake up with no hair one day.”
“Sure, toots, whatever you say. Come up in ten minutes or you’ll miss my shower.” Pepper padded away with swaying hips, and Tony stared after her. He’d been writing off the too long glances, soft looks, and small touches he’d been getting from Steve as friendly behavior. The alternative just seemed too ridiculous.
The first time a floral printed pillow ended up on his sofa, he didn’t think much of it beyond, “ew.”
Tony tried to take back some control, to increase the speed even just a bit, but Steve was right, he could do nothing to manipulate the tempo. A thrill shot from his dick to his finger tips. He was at Steve’s mercy. It made him quiver, and he allowed himself to ride the waves of the slow slip and slide Steve was hell-bent on.
Steve’s eyes flashed. He grabbed Tony by the waist and spun him around. Ignoring Tony’s snarl of indignation, he reached around him and quickly unfastened his jeans.
For the 1,494th time he gingerly swept his hand over the name etched into the marble, and then he went back to trace the letters.
Antique shopping. Old fashioned. Decor. Tony is particular. Tony has an aesthetic. Comfort. Familiarity. Steve Rogers feels. Tony Stark has a heart.
They had been fighting. Again. It was a common enough occurrence. They were both stubborn, passionate, assertive, and unyielding. All qualities they loved about each other, and that could make for a disaster when they disagreed on something.
Now Steve was using only the power of his body, and it was all the better. His muscles worked and bunched to deliver strength to each punch of his hips, and he bowed his head to rest on Tony’s back.
Tony cut Steve off by licking a long stripe along the underside of his dick. And then he was done playing with his prey. He grabbed the base to hold it steady, and then engulfed it in the wet heat of his mouth once more. He bobbed his head, and hollowed his cheeks, increasing his speed with every pass until he had reached a steady pace that some people would have found uncomfortable. But he was proud to admit he was a bit of a pro. He had sucked so much dick in his early twenties.
Steve’s jaw was strong, just like the rest of him, and he had no problem using it to grind his teeth harder into Tony’s shoulder. The genius hissed as his body arched and twisted, instinctively struggling even though he was totally on board with what was going on.
“And you think your plan was operation bullet proof?” Tony moved forward in the spare space between them until they were nearly touching. “Your plan would have insured my safety, but not the thousands of people milling around those streets. Mine risked my ass, but it came out unscathed. I call that a win!”
Hands guided by his own anger, Steve dragged his nails down Tony’s back to grab handfuls of his ass. His nails dug in and he wrenched Tony closer against himself. It forced Tony to stand on his toes in order to keep control of the kiss, and apparently Tony didn’t like that, because he bit Steve’s tongue. Hard.
Tony was brushing his teeth, groggy eyed even after his first cup of coffee. He smiled when he saw Steve in the reflection of their wall to wall vanity. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and kissed his neck. “Hey, doll. How you feel about pancakes for breakfast?”
“Tank, dammit!” Tony reprimanded and marched over to the boxes and bins the giant of a hound had knocked over, Steve on his heels laughing, which of course made Tank even happier and more excitable.
For the 11th time he rolled his eyes up to study his bots, and for the 11th time he shook his head. They had never successfully brewed and delivered him coffee, and there was no change in circumstances that would make them start now. So who was his mystery delivery angel?
It wasn’t so bad now that he’d gotten started. He was faintly aroused by it, and as Tony had asserted to him over and over, Steve knew his own strength, and exactly how to deliver it to achieve whatever impact it was that he desired.
Ever so carefully, Tony brought the razor to Steve’s face, heart now hammering more out of excitement. Finally his foe would be defeated!
Returning her smirk he waved his hand dismissively in Steve’s direction. “No, no. I was multitasking. Promise. You were saying if we move the meeting room level down a few, each Avenger can have their own floor with a few extra to account for growth.” He lowered his voice and leaned forward conspiratorially. “Come over here and we can multitask together.”
Despite having already done it many times Tony reassured Steve, “It’s supposed to hurt a bit, and if it hurts too much, I’ll say the word.”
A slight increase of the weight on Tony’s neck is all he needed to move on, and he dropped gracefully to his knees while hastily unfastening Steve’s buckle and outdated stuffy khakis. He tugged them open only enough to release Steve. The bead of cum on the head, and the pulsing vein that ran along the bottom betrayed Steve’s composure.
“Yeah, I think so. They’ve mostly just been trying to get me to fly over the cuckoos nest. Nearly got there too.”
The heat radiating off Steve was suffocating and downright terrifying. It was only a few hundred more feet before Steve collapsed completely, taking Tony down with him.
Tony jammed his knee between Steve’s thighs and grinded his leg against his crotch. Mouth demanding and forceful he pried Steve’s lips open and then sucked his tongue into his mouth as if he wanted to pull it right out.
By the time they pass the automatic doors of the emergency department Tony looks worse. He’s as pale as paste, his eyes are closed, and he coughs and blood spittles down his chin.
The dog trotted forward to stick his nose through the kennel fence. Or the tip of it anyway. His snout was too large to fit any further than that.
The small show of affection had the desired effect on Tony. He tried to act nonchalant.“Yeah, yeah. Go for it.” But he was relaxed against Steve’s solid mass. What could he say? Steve was like heroin.
Without skipping a beat Tony pulled out and then drove forward again. There’s no casual, measured build up. Not today. Not with what Tony was chasing. It’s only after a few thrusts that Tony doubled the pace.
A large part of him wants to shove her aside and pull the “I’m Captain America” card, but his moral compass stops him as he shouts after Tony and the nurses. “Fix him! You have to fix him, you hear me?!” The doors swing shut behind them and Steve’s hands go to his hair, sliding between the strands and gripping it, turning his usual put together look into a harried mess.
“Mine.” Steve growled, and launched an assault on Tony’s neck. The smaller man could do nothing but squirm, gasp, and moan. A particularly hard bite wrung a cry from his lips, and he bucked his hips. He loved it when Steve got like this.
“Bruce? Bruce is too minimalist. Steve? I’ve never seen him-” He stopped and narrowed his eyes at her when she made a ‘yeah, obviously’ face at him.
Tony growled. “Dammit, Rogers.” He shifted Steve’s arm so he could get to the pack he knew the boyscout kept his first aid supplies in. The soldier swatted at him, and Tony smacked his hand away. “Stop being a reckless jackass and let me clean it at least.”
Tony was grinning at him in the mirror. Slow and deliberate, Tony put the final touches on his look, holding Steve’s gaze. After he deemed himself finished Tony strode over, moving in what Steve referred to as his panther prowl. When he reached the side of the bed he looked down at Steve, eyes twinkling knowingly.
Steve’s mouth shut with an audible click, and then his brow furrowed. “But, you’re so particular. About design and even your clothes, and-”
Steve withdrew his fingers and Tony hung his head to catch his breath, chuckling lowly. “The great and chivalrous...”
When it happens the third night at the tower he isn’t surprised. He wraps himself in a throw blanket and stumbles his way to the communal floor to zone out on a television show. Television was one of the things of the future he had already grown fond of.
Today it seemed that the upcoming public gala had them both feeling possessive. Between the press and the disrespectful advances they both usually received, Tony really should have seen it coming this time.
Every time Tony reacted equally as affectionate in return, and ignored that it made him want to wrinkle his nose. It was worth it to see how happy it made Steve.
Tony still looked disbelieving when he replied, “Alright, Run along now, soldier. Wouldn’t want to keep the chain of command waiting.”
Just as Steve was sure Tony had fallen asleep on him, the genius chuckled lightly. “We’re going to have to move this chair. Or throw it out.”
“Sorry. Really. I forgot. We’ll come back to this? Yeah. We’ll come back to it.” Steve stumbled back a few steps, serum induced grace forgotten. If the heat in his cheeks and neck was any indication he was definitely flaming bright red.
Tony’s own need to lay claim to his boyfriend had him twisting until he could get his teeth on Steve’s neck. He made a mental note to ask Jarvis for the footage later. He was sure they looked like a couple of vampires the way they were twisted and pressed together, sucking and biting at each other’s flesh like maniacs.
“Uggggh.” Tony complained. It was a weak complaint seeing as he was simultaneously laughing. Tank loved the sound of laughter, and his tail went crazy as he nibbled on Tony’s earlobe. “Alright, you’re nasty.” Tony gently shoved Tank down who resumed bounding about the shop, nearly knocking into just about everything.
“Oh, right. Sorry!” Steve blushed and fumbled to grab the bag. Tony watched in open amusement and fondness as Steve opened it to dole out the sustenance. First feeding Tank who devoured his footlong in seconds, and then handing Tony his. Steve’s cheeks were flushed even brighter now, both with cold and bashfulness.
There was a fresh cup of coffee on the corner of Tony’s desk. He’s unsure how long it had been there, but it’s still hot so it couldn’t have been long. How long it was there wasn’t even the important question. How it got there was.
The two marched down the gleaming hall of the business level. Steve was half in combat gear, and Tony still wore his undersuit. They looked like a united front, in pace together and glowering. In reality, they were ready to ram heads.
Okay, so yes. Tony started looking forward to the letters. No one did shit like that anymore. No one sat down and wrote someone else a letter, telling them about their thoughts and what was going on in their lives, how much they cherished you, why they loved you, things that reminded them of you.
“Sure you will.” Steve smiled indulgently. Lucky for Tony, Steve had hit his own threshold. He twirled his fingers a few more times before he withdrew them, coated himself with more lube for good measure, and grabbed Tony’s hips.
As Tony’s grip tightened, Steve became more aware of the sensation of Tony's breath puffing against his neck, of his calloused hand sliding over their hot flesh, and the pleasure heightened. He felt his dick twitch when Tony cut off his air completely, and his mouth hung open, eyebrows scrunched together.
Immediately, Steve decided he wouldn’t act on his new feelings. He was team leader, and Tony was in a committed relationship. It would be disrespectful and inappropriate. So, he ignored his feelings as best he could, which was easier to do when they weren’t spending time together.
Since he clearly wasn’t going to get any help from Steve, he angled himself backwards, bowing in an elegant arch and finally Steve’s cock hit his prostate spot on. His vision tunneled and his rolling moans filled their bedroom.
Unable to keep it in any longer, he screamed at the grass, “It was supposed to be me! It was my grenade, dammit! You just couldn’t let it be anyone but you! Mr. Fucking Noble Self Sacrificing Asshole! You-” Tony twisted his neck to bury his face into his own shoulder.
The last month had been rough. His success with adapting to being thrown from war to 70 years in the future had screeched to a halt, and then back pedaled. The therapist Sam insisted on him talking to suggested it was because Steve hadn’t taken, or been given, the time to adjust properly. Instead, he’d buried all of it until his mind couldn’t handle it anymore, and dug it all back up, forcing him to face it.
It was weird, Sam and Tony taking off together after lunch. They weren’t enemies, but they weren’t exactly friends either.
“It’s meant for taking care of each other. You haven’t slept in three days, maybe more, I can’t be certain when or if you slept on mission. I know you haven’t been eating the way your freako metabolism needs, and I can see the tension in your shoulders and left leg a mile away.” Tony prattled off, and then crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. “Now, are you going to honor the terms of our agreement, or am I going to have to call in reinforcements?”
Those thoughts just made him feel more crumpled. It was like he was a basket of balled up papers, and someone had dropped a match in him. Slowly he burned, the edges of him curling in on themselves. Seeking relief, he crawled towards the grave stone. Some people had tried to insist it be in the shape of the shield, but Tony had squashed that. This was Steve’s grave, not Captain America’s.
And Tony knew that if Steve was able to say anything to him, he would tell him he had to keep fighting. He’d tell him he had to because the world needed Iron Man, and Tony Stark. Steve was an optimistic inspirational dumbass like that.
Like a loon, Steve stared down at his new best friend. He was tall, and deep chested, with thick fur that gave him an appearance of a bear, but he was slender framed like a wolf. He looked like he could mow anyone over, and he turned to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead before crouching down to be eye level with the dog.
Pressing his hand to his heart, Tony mocked some major hurt. “Steve? My precious Steve? Oh, how I have failed him!”
“Oh for- Fine! Orders, directions, whatever you want to call them. This is about you risking your safety and the team’s-”
“About thirty miles out. Their air surveillance made it impossible for us to fly in. Thor is still tracking Hulk to get him back. Hawkeye is still in medical. It’s just Widow and I. The agents we brought with are focused on taking down the organization and gathering intel.”
Steve frowned down at it in puzzlement for a minute before he slowly moved the blankets off his lap and rose to his feet. It would normally alarm him that he hadn’t had any awareness of someone being so close to him. Instead a warm feeling settled in his belly. He didn’t know who the kind gesture came from, but it made him smile softly as he folded both blankets.
It didn’t slow Steve down any. If anything he was moving faster, and in the back of his mind Tony imagined him moving like the agents in the Matrix. A low moaning growl built in the chest pressed against Tony’s back and then Steve shoved him forward flat against the desk again, and grinded his hips, emptying himself deep inside Tony.
Tony’s back sloped appealingly, and then his body swelled into two round and supple mounds. They were meaty, and muscular, yet they had the perfect amount of jiggle to them. He accredited his bubble butt to the popular squats and lunges of the 80’s, and Steve was very grateful to the decade even though he hadn’t lived it.
They were both close, had been for awhile, both staving off their own releases out of spite. One hand wrapped around Tony’s member, and then tightened.
It was a Sunday morning, the one day that Steve “slept in” as he called it. Which to Tony was massively overselling it. 8 AM was not sleeping in. Especially not on a Sunday.
“Tony?” Steve shifted and Tony could hear him opening a door, probably to their suite. “Shut up.” The door clicked behind them and Tony sighed. He would have to let Steve play his beloved role of mother hen. The man’s mind was set. Tony could sneak off after Steve thought he was asleep.
Short and sweet. Fluffy goodness. Adorable. Cute. Winter time. Hot dog cart date. Tank makes an appearance.
It wasn’t long before Tony’s cheeks had turned a delightful shade of pink, and on the last few strikes he had emitted soft moans. Steve figured Tony might be ready to step it up a notch, and he leaned back to assess the items Tony had laid out for him.
The wind rushed through Steve’s ears, and blew his hair about wildly. Tony immediately did a loop and Steve whooped in appreciation.
Two of Tony’s rough mechanic fingers slid into Steve in one go, causing him to gasp and his toes to curl into the carpet. Clearly, Tony was impatient. He’d prep Steve enough, but quicker than usual. Steve loved when Tony got like this, and he tipped his head back, relishing in the feeling of Tony’s fingers moving in and out of him, swirling and scissoring every other pass.
Both of them spent, they sagged against each other. Steve’s chest heaved as his body caught up, and he wrapped his arms around Tony's waist. So far, Tony hadn't been wrong about spicing up their sex life. It was fun, it felt good, and nothing they'd done so far had spent him into a spiral of shame. Maybe they could try that impact play thing next.
“Oh..” Steve replied sheepishly. “So, what’s with the suit then? You better not be wearing that for our date.”
The blonde ignored him in favor of making sure he was sufficiently presentable, before turning around and forcing Tony to his feet. “Think of it this way, the anticipation is going to make it so much better later.”
Steve’s hand was able to wrap around Tony’s neck until his fingers met in the back. His other hand lay flat against the wall beside Tony’s head, trapping him in.
Steve’s curiosity officially piqued, he strolled around the kitchen island towards the sound of Tony’s voice. It seemed to be coming from the bedroom.
“Okay, for one, you had to know I’ve noticed by now. I’m not that oblivious. Quite the opposite really. You know that.”
Tony had pitched it after their post battle shawarma; Stark Tower transformed into Avengers Tower. Everyone had been on board, even the at first reluctant Bruce. The problem was that Steve hadn’t factored in an unforeseen development.
Which was why Steve was sure they were up to something. He hadn’t had much capacity or willingness to try to figure it out though.
“Working on a project back home,” he said, cutting into a tomato and assembling his masterpiece. “It’s kind of kicking everyone’s ass, and the guy running it…well, he’s a little cuckoo, even for me. Thought I could use a break and remembered I was working on a new suit here. Figured I’d get back on that for a bit. Nothing like a little project hopping to clear the head.” Tony brought a knife down through the sandwich, and deposited one half onto a plate before sliding it to Steve. “There you go, big guy. Stick that in your piehole.”
Steve grinned as Tony brought his hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to fingers that were still a touch too cold.
>>CAP: Okay. Okay, listen FRI,I know you just moved that light to me, but give Tony everything he needs f…for as long as you can and put anything extra into boosting the signal. I can’t…
“He’s not breathing on his own yet, Tony. They’ve got him on a ventilator. He’s surrounded by heat lamps and machines and you’re not doing so great yourself right now.”
FRIDAY still replied in under three seconds, but for Tony it was a delay that may as well have been three hours.
didn’t spark some hot hospital bed makeup sex, there’s probably no hope, anyway,” he said with a cheeky grin that always made her laugh and this was no exception. It was only when her giggles died down and her face returned to something somber that he spoke again. “We don’t work, do we?”
There was a pause in their communication. FRIDAY’s scan noted a shaking that seemed unrelated to the shivering cold. When Steve spoke again, it was with what her analysis registered as rising panic.
Steve cut himself off. Most people would have probably thought he’d just reached the end of his sentence, but there was something about the the set of his jaw and a slight squint of his eye that told Tony he’d said more than he’d meant to reveal.
“I have to get back to Malibu,” Pepper said, and for the first time he realized how tired she sounded. How much business she must have been doing from a waiting room chair. God, she must have hopped on a plane the second she’d heard. “I’m glad you’re okay, and…” a thoughtful expression played out on her face as she looked past Tony. “Give Steve my love.”
“I don’t know what to think about anything right now,” he said before steering the conversation to safer waters. “How’s business?”
She filled him in on the world news while he’d been out of it, scores for sports he didn’t know she followed and enough company gossip from Happy that Tony’s head was spinning — at least in a good way this time — by the time she was done.
“It’s kind of like a complete system reboot,” one of the doctors said. “Warm him up and wait is all we can do now.”
Someone had left Steve’s sketchbook on the bedside table and he pulled it closer, opening it to the middle. One page was just a close up of Wanda’s hands. The details were there, right down to her chipped nail polish and array of rings, but it was the motion of her hands that Steve had somehow managed to capture on paper that caught his eye, her fingers caught mid-twirl as power flowed between them. The next page showed Natasha and Rhodey laughing, probably during a lull in a training session. The sharp, heavy lines of the War Machine suit stood in stark contrast to the soft wave of her hair and Tony once again found himself stunned as he flipped through pages and pages of Avengers frozen but still vividly alive in grayscale. Forget the superhero business, Steve could make a mint on coffee table art books.
Steve popped up and put both feet on the floor, setting the pad aside. “Wow, Tony! That’s really great!” he said with a giant grin plastered on his face. “How great is that, FRIDAY?!”
Tony tried to read Steve’s expression or his tone, but any clues were hidden in his glance around for the bed controls and the whir as he raised himself to a sitting position.
“I’m gonna really need you to wake up,” he whispered. “Because, see, I kinda sorta think I might love you, and I really want to talk about it. So, what do you say?”
One foot went left, the other went right and Tony was left grasping at the bed frame to hold himself up as the door opened after a quick tap.
“B.A.R.F.’s coming along — we really need a new name by the way. Stocks are up 40 percent since they found you.”
“So what brings you to town?” Steve asked as Tony sliced into a loaf of sourdough. “I don’t think you came all the way here to make me a sandwich.”
But nothing worked, and he remembered heading to the manual shutoff, pulling a panel and getting hit with an electrical blast that sent him reeling into the opposite wall and interrupted the suit enough to keep it from absorbing the blow that left him seeing stars and then barely anything.
“I have no idea. But that’s where they are. Sam’s visiting his mother, Nat’s with the Bartons and Rhodes-”
“Wo-ow,” Steve said, drawing the word out dispassionately from his spot on the couch, one leg stretched out and the other bent enough to balance the sketch pad on his thigh.
“Noted,” Tony said as he took his own bite. He couldn’t help but notice how uncharacteristically quiet it was at the compound’s residential wing. “Speaking of, where is your team?”
It was dark when they got there, except for one cabinet that Tony was actually a little surprised to still find glowing at the edges of its doors.
Tony glanced toward the door. He strained his ears for the unlikely signs of anyone alerted by a twitchy finger. Satisfied that no one was coming, he got his weight beneath him and stood a little taller, leaning purposefully close to Steve’s ear.
be happy for me. Tell people how much you love them. Let them love you back. Make great things. But you don’t have to worry about being great, because you already are.” Steve’s voice broke and he sniffed the cold air once before bending down to rest his cheek atop his head. “Just…just be okay, okay? For me? FRIDAY, stop recording.”
“Will do.” Steve leaned back into the couch and Tony turned his attention back to his work. And in fact, the next time he glanced that way, he found Steve reclined on the couch, ankles propped up on the far arm, open sketchbook face-down on his chest with a pencil dangling near the floor from one hand as he breathed slowly, fast asleep.
One corner of Steve’s mouth ticked up as he raised his eyebrows and re-twisted the tie on his bread. Tony could feel his eyes on him while he rummaged through the cupboards and fridge returning to the counter with a bounty of goods.
They ate the rest of their meal in silence, and Tony couldn’t quite shake the feeling that they were both stealing glances, always just missing each other by milliseconds.
“I didn’t invite you here this time,” Steve said around another mouthful. “But you know you never need an invitation. You’re always welcome. This place was yours long before it was ours.”
“If you’re watching…I don’t know what went wrong, but something must have. And I need you to know it’s okay. And I’m not just saying that because I’m trying to be a hero or something. It’s just that…you’re special, Tony. And I know you’d p…probably say you don’t need anyone to tell you that, but sometimes…sometimes I think you do. So b…believe me when I say you are amazing. You’ve got a brilliant mind and a beautiful heart and I … I care about you. Probably…probably more than I should. A lot more than I should.”
Well. That was a bullshit answer if he ever heard one. Tony turned his attention to the bed rail, scouring its composition for signs of a lever, switch or button that would save him from being trapped in bed like some kind of infant and finally settled for brute force, jerking it forwards and backwards until something clicked or broke and brought the rail down flush with the bedside. His watch buzzed and he didn’t need to look at it to know FRIDAY was questioning his next move as he swung his legs over the edge of the bed. The room spun and there might have been a slight churning in his stomach, but he ignored it and set his feet down on the floor.
He nodded, and Pepper was out the door and probably halfway to her car before her words landed in his brain. And people called him the genius.
Tony sighed and took a drink of his coffee before setting it back down with disgust. It was cold now, and Tony had had enough cold. Fortunately it didn’t take long for the door to open and Pepper to slip inside, another steaming cup in her hands.
“It hasn’t been good, Tone,” he said. “I don’t know how you stayed so warm, which is a weird thing to say given how cold you were, but he was nearly frozen solid again. But something’s different. Maybe the serum wasn’t ever meant to be frozen once, let alone twice…”
“Fine, fine,” he said. “You go back to your little drawing, maybe take a nap, and I’ll rouse you at the next milestone.”
White walls. White ceiling. Beige bed rails. All the hallmarks of a hospital. Tony felt around the edges of the bed until he found a square control box and pushed the button to raise his head. Once he was sitting up, he came face to face with a red laptop on the rolling bedside table. A watch was next to it and Post-It was stuck to the screen.
There was a part of Tony that couldn’t help but smile as the students chased after them like ducklings, sticking a thermometer in his ear or holding his wrist to check his pulse while Rhodey walked down the hall with just a little more pep and the doctor asked him a dozen questions about his physical health and current symptoms. On a normal day, Tony might have bullshitted with him a little bit, lashed out with a caustic tongue, but something kept his answers simple and straightforward.
Tony’s hands stilled and he couldn’t hold back a grin as the words seeped into his soul, warming him from the inside out.
Tony grinned as he pulled Steve to his feet. It had been years since he donned the black form-fitting getup and felt all the plates of the Mark 3 slide and screw into place. Back then he just hadn’t wanted to get his clothes caught in the metal on its virgin flight to right some wrongs, but this time the fewer barriers between the suit and him the better. But not even he was up for some naked time in a prototype suit.
“Can I get you anything?” Pepper asked as Tony ran a hand across his face. God, she knew all his tells.
like lights in a warehouse coming on one by one as the suit’s systems came online, and soon he found himself once again staring at Steve. He was slackjawed, a sparkle of wonder in his eyes.
“First thing’s first: Gotta get FRIDAY to interface with the nanotech. After that there’s the independent power issue. Eventually I want to get a neural pathway connection over the plasma channels but for now I think we can just program in some basic functions and focus on the musculature — and I’ve lost you haven’t I?”
“What? You need some proof or something?” Tony swallowed and took a breath that shook just a little as he leaned closer and pressed his lips to Steve’s. “Please wake up. Because I love you, and I need you to know it.”
“Kitchen!” Steve’s voice called from the distance. It wasn’t a long walk, but with every step Tony’s mood lifted. “Hey,” Steve said with a smile as he entered. “I was just making a sandwich. Want one?”
“Uh, that would be me,” Tony said as he brought his other hand to Steve’s, carefully rubbing his fingers between his palms. Steve frowned at him.
“It’s not the same,” a SHIELD audiologist said while administering a hearing test. “Yes, you can hear better but the sound isn’t the same.”
His heart was in his mouth as the rest of the Avengers waited to hear his commands. Tony had to make it, he had to. Steve couldn’t lose him. Not after winning the soulmate lottery. It got worse when Tony fell back to earth from the wormhole.
The SHIELD agent -- because of course his tutor would be a SHIELD agent -- replied cheerfully, “Seems to work out fine for people.” Then the agent’s face fell. “I forgot -- about your soulmate, that is.”
She nodded and ran a finger around the curve of her ear. Her makeup was fresh and her hair redone. She even smelled faintly of orchid because — as she’d once explained — even if the people on the other end of a video conference couldn’t smell her, she could and it helped keep her in the right frame of mind.
>>FRIDAY: I’m sure someone will. And this suit emits a low frequency signal that can be detected at closer ranges.
There was a lot they couldn’t tell him, though. They knew how it started and they knew how it ended — Avengers old and new coming together and then spreading out to find them huddled together in snow and ice, Steve’s body curled around his, clad in socks and the jeans and T-shirt he’d been wearing before pulling his uniform on over them and racing to the jet. He’d given the rest to Tony, and if he closed his eyes and concentrated he could almost remember what it had felt like to be maneuvered into the clothes, Steve’s residual body heat warming him like a furnace. But every time he tried to dig deeper into his memory for something more concrete, he hit a wall.
“Yep. No hydraulics or gears or plates. Just one piece designed to move with me.” Tony took a step back, his arm falling from Steve’s grasp, and did a few squats and lunges and stretched his arms to the heavens before windmilling them around. “Much more flexible. God, it’s like I’m barely even wearing anything. But…here, hit me.”
>>CAP: The save it for Tony. Unless…if something goes wrong…If I don’t make it out of here and he does…will he blame himself?
Tony didn’t remember much. Alarms. Controls shaking in his hands. Pain. Arms under his. Cold. But it was all just flashes. Snippets of memories he wasn’t sure he wanted back. And so he let himself drift back to better times.
Tony pulled the laptop toward him and pressed a few keys. It didn’t take long to pull up FRIDAY’s logs for the day. He scrolled past the reams of data from the lab and jumped straight to the practical tests. He’d done a quick run-through in a training zone while Steve scrambled into his gear and FRIDAY prepped the jet. He had flight. He had light weapons. Enough to not be a liability and to be more than a chauffeur under most circumstances.
“Well,” he said, “I could hear that all day.” He was about to speak again when his watch buzzed and he leaned back, turning his attention to his wrist. “But FRIDAY says a gaggle of doctors is on the way, and I don’t know about you, but…”
“Yeah, this one’s a little different,” he said as he led Steve to the center of the lab. Steve frowned.
“We’re done, right?” he asked. Her brow scrunched just a little bit, like it always did when he posed a serious question. “I mean, we are? No more deals. No more promises. No more last ditch efforts or half-drunk bad decisions?”
“I’m here to find stolen Pym equipment.” Hope sat up straighter. “Has to be Stark. No other reason he’d be on this trip. He’s stealing our inventions for Justin Hammer.”
Tony walked out of the meeting, even had a spring in his step as he thought about the expedition possibilities. Rogers had a plan and Tony had ideas.
They would have to leave soon after Clint and Pietro returned. The specimens were almost all gathered and ready to be packed up for the return. But everyone had an edge of disappointment, since they had still not discovered anything about the smuggling. As for himself, Steve had the most to lose when they left -- he’d finally found his place leading the expedition, and was perhaps on the verge of making a real difference like he’d always wanted to do.
"What did they think it was?" Tony asks, curious. The energy is very similar to the power core some of the Kree use on their ships, but he won't know for sure unless he moves closer. So he does.
The monitor above the console flickers, then a grainy, staticky video of Steve appears with a lag. Even with the video quality worse than cheap CCTV cameras from the 90s, Tony's heart is so full. Steve looks so happy to see him. "Hey, Sheriff. Good to see you. Sorry about the quality."
“Yep. That’s what he did at night when we were on the arctic expedition. He had a lot of notebooks filled with sketches. I’ve been after him to publish a volume or two. People would pay good money for that.”
"Nah. Nothing much here to get excited about. Might be nothing. Just eat your breakfast and leave me some pancakes."
There's always so much familiarity and fondness for each other that Tony can only shake his head and smile at them. He can't wait to be in the middle of it now.
“Wait -- so you said that Wanda didn’t know about velociraptors. AIM is smuggling out the safer vegetarian dinosaurs for pet sales, and keeping the dangerous carnivores like velociraptors for their own purposes. Basically they are selling off the dinosaurs that they don’t want to pay for their smuggling operations.”
Tony admittedly was intrigued by what people told him about Steve. He snuck glances around Rogers’ office. WItwas a disappointment to find that he had no work laying out. Rogers’ office tent was so devoid of personality, that it was impossible to tell anything personal about Rogers.
So I decided to draw like what could’ve happened next after the moment Tony gets onto the horse. I don’t really read comics, but I think the line ‘Anything to get you to hold me’ is said by tony here?? so yeah, have some tony holding (onto) steve on horseback in a quiet moment :3
"Okay. No propositioning is happening until you call Reed and figure something out." Steve says firmly though he's smiling at both of them. "You need me here for the call?"
When Tony is sure both of them have been consumed by science, he turns back to Steve who's looking at him like he's trying to solve a puzzle. "Sorry about them. So, how's everyone?"
“The last thing we need is conflict between the expedition members and the ship’s crew,” Rogers said. “I don’t want a repeat of what happened on the Amazon expedition.”
“Oh yeah! I had to do something -- the first photos I took were terrible even after I read the book and we only have so many supplies.”
Ignoring Tony, Rogers opened with, “We already have a few members -- you, me, my friends Sam Wilson and Natasha Romanoff. Clint Barton, Natasha’s friend. Hope Pym and her -- her -- her whatever Scott Lang are coming along too.”
“What did you want to see me about?” Rogers said, drawing up to his full height and dropping any semblance of informality.
Steve looked over the gathered crowd, checking that everyone was there. “Good morning, we need to address the aims of this expedition.” He noticed the sudden perking up of several heads. Better than coffee to get their attention.
Tony froze for a second, as if he had expected Steve to act differently. He looked at the chair like Steve had offered him a seat in a lava pit. “Captain Rogers, I am leaving the expedition now as no one here is able to tell one iota of truth. I will pack up my belongings and will be leaving as soon as possible by any means necessary, even if that includes using magic. Dr. Banner can handle all of the science on his own.”
"It's not like they're hard to find. And there's not a lot of work for people like us in this place," the man defends himself, forgetting his fear in the name of science. Frankly, Tony can relate. Then seemingly, remembering his precarious position, he flinches. "Mr. Iron Man, sir."
He still was not used to all the amazing machines that now filled the city. Steve had to stop himself from staring at the occasional horseless carriage in the streets or the new improved zeppelins in the air above. He had gone to a restaurant the other day and listened to music coming from a mechanical player piano.
Tony is in good hands, so he doesn't know why he's so nervous. He chalks it up to excitement. He hasn't seen his Steve in a week. It will be so good to see him again in person. Maybe Steve will squeeze his shoulder and pat him on the back.
He sneaks a look at his Steve who's looking at them with an unreadable expression and Tony resists the urge to sigh.
"Copy that. Everyone's got the place secured. SHIELD's sending cleanup. I'm going down there to help," Steve replies.
“There's a lot of money involved and the police move slowly.” Miss Maximoff sighed. “I’m not sure that the police would see this as a problem.”
When he’s spit out the other side of the portal, he’s not entirely sure what to expect. He's never actually been through a portal like this before. Wormholes, yes. They are a staple in space travel.
However, the instructions for this expedition were more extensive than in the past. He could see the favor to T’Challa but not for Pym. It made his head hurt to try and sort it all out.
Barton built a pen for Redwing near Steve’s tent with a secure protective cover to fend off predators. Redwing showed a distinct preference for her bed in Steve’s tent, to the point of digging up a fence post when she was placed in the pen for the first time. With a glint in his eye, Barton set to work again on a reinforced pen.
"Okay. That's enough of that--" Stark pushes Thor on the shoulder. Or tries to. "Stop trolling the guest, Pointbreak."
Natasha's voice filters through the living room. "Tony, we have visual of alien tech fragments at the warehouse. Chatter says it's some sort of power source. They're trying to put it back together. I'm uploading pictures now."
Scott rattled off a lot about frequencies and sound waves. Tony listened raptly. He thumped Scott on the shoulder. “That should work.” Scott beamed.
Tony and Rogers knew when they’d been dismissed. Though Tony wondered why exactly the King of Wakanda would have asked the Director of the New Explorers’ Club for help to uncover a smuggling ring.
“it won’t matter much if we can’t untie the ropes.” Tony pulled up his legs to look at the irons. He noticed how badly they were forged. “It would have been more efficient to shoot us in the head.”
"Seems like the reactor is more compatible with it than their energy source." Tony can't help but step closer. Curiosity has always been a problem for him and this portal isn’t helping matters in the slightest. It’s like someone flipped a switch as it surges to life. A great, swirling void about eight feet high, it looks like rippling water with no bottom in sight.
"He misses you, you know," Stark declares for him. The man has no shame. Tony pushes him out of the camera. "What? Watching you both dance around each other is like waiting for paint to dry!"
Steve hangs back until everyone's done then, like the parting of the Red Sea, everyone makes way for him. He smiles at Tony, eyes taking him in like he's making sure he's really okay.
"Do we need the whole thing or just a fragment?" Clint asks, "cause I don't think that will fit in my quiver. Oh shit--"
“Have you met Colonel Rhodes?” Tony asked, trying to pour all his good manners into his question. Because apparently Rogers had left his at home.
Tony gave Rogers an appraising look. He had not thought that Rogers was one who said one thing and did another; Rogers had called for an end to animal trafficking at the annual dinner, it had been covered in the papers. Clearly the man had his talents when it came to organization, but otherwise Tony just couldn’t see what anyone else, like his father and Fury, saw in the man. He owned a dinosaur for one thing, that couldn’t possibly speak to any intelligence.
Steve turned his head back and forth. “The AIM camp is that way -- we’ll need to go around it to get to ours.”
Before dinner, Sam reported to Steve that Tony had been stewing in his tent all day, refusing to talk to anyone, even Dr. Banner. Tony didn’t even come out to join the others for dinner or for the evening entertainment.
He’s about to tell Steve it's nothing when a hauler reaches for something on the ground, then accurately throws it his way in a pitch that would've made any professional baseball player proud. It would have hit him too, if not for his quick reflexes. The woman yells, forcing Tony to focus his cameras on her, and takes in the enhancement, like scopes on her eyes.
A few minutes passed before he deemed Steve asleep enough, and himself ready enough. He dispensed a small dollop of shaving cream onto his hand and then carefully applied it across the source of his torture.
The next slap came down a bit harder, and the next even harder than that. He kept dialed into Tony’s every reaction, and he knew when he’d hit the point of too hard when Tony’s hands clenched in the sheets and he gritted his teeth. After rubbing the spot in silent apology, he moved over a bit and delivered his next wallop there instead, toned down ever so slightly. Tony groaned and relaxed and Steve smiled.
“My dog? You’re the one- Tank no!” And Tony laughed as Steve lunged at Tank in a desperate attempt to save the precious letters.
“So, I was looking into that idea you had about your suit. I found a way to accomplish it. I just have to-” Steve’s hand tightened, and Tony’s heart stuttered “Combine them on a molecular level-” Steve’s hand tightened more, effectively cutting off Tony’s words, and sending a thrill of excitement to his groin.
“Nat, you’re not harboring some secret affinity for feminime soft patterns, are you?” Tony inquired one day, leaning against the kitchen counter.
It was a board meeting today, and so Steve got to witness Tony tucking the shirt into his pin striped slacks. His hands glided over all the fabric to smooth out any wrinkles, and then it was on to picking a watch.
That thought had him hurriedly looking down. His eyes followed Tony’s defined collar bones and over his shoulders, down his arms to his work rough hands. He was such a beautiful contrast of sharp edges and handsome curves. It would be a joy to draw him, and that train of thought needed to stop too. His gaze jumped further down to the shirt clinging to Tony’s stomach, to the v of his hip bones poking out of his pants, and his own grew a little tighter.
Gaze hardening even more, Steve kept Tony pinned one handed, and yanked open the closest drawer to him to carelessly rummage through it. No matter how angry they got, he didn’t want to cause Tony any everlasting damage.
They reached their destination, and as soon as they were through the threshold Steve slammed the door. He must have restrained himself, because it didn’t break.
After ten more minutes there were a couple more dogs he thought would be a good fit. They were only halfway through, and he had a feeling whittling down the list at the end would take the rest of the day.
And then sometimes his Brooklyn drawl kicked in, and Tony was sure if he was made up of any more than the 60% of water that he as a human was, it would make him melt.
A nudge in the side and a look from Sam, and Tony conceded to at least taking his sunglasses off. Eye contact would be important after all. The dog had to like him too. At least a little bit.
“You know, hats are more effective, they help retain the heat that escapes from your head.” Tony had reminded him.
“Hey, just want you to look at me.” Steve cajoled. He was painfully hard, leaking and roaring to go, but he wanted to see Tony’s face, the way his expression changed as he finally took Steve inside him.
The doors slam shut behind them, muffling the shouts and disorder of the crowd that had been attending the press conference, and he’s left with the medical talk of the paramedics, and Steve’s face wavering in and out of view.
Tony shoved Steve in the chest, forcing him back a step. “Screw you! I didn’t put any of the team in danger!”
“Uh. Well, I was kind of hoping you would name him? His name is Hugo, but I think we should change it. Give him a fresh start. I mean, it’s up to you though.”
Before Steve could pick a new spot, Tony grabbed his hair and yanked, forcing his head back. He surged forward and latched on high at his throat where everyone could see. He started off sucking hard, carelessly loud, and then bit over the mark he’d raised to the pale skin. Steve moaned and his hands held tighter to Tony’s hips, undoubtedly pressing bruises there as well.
Grabbing Tony’s chin Steve stares at him with determination and tenderness. “Tony, you need to get a grip. Got to hold on. All right?” He’s rewarded with a flicker of recognition. “For me, Bruce, Natasha, all of them.”  Pauses to take a deep breath to stave off his own panic attack. Steadily, Tony seems to be connecting back to reality, and he meets Steve’s eyes and actually sees him. Steve can tell by the spark of honey in them. “You don’t get to quit. Remember? You get killed, you walk it off.”
As Steve predicted, Tony reached behind himself and grabbed Steve’s girth with an exasperated, “finally.” Before he could position himself and sink down Steve tightened his grip and stopped him. “Steve, I swear to fucking-!”
PTSD. Mental Health. Rescue dog. Dogs solve everything. Sam Wilson helps. And loves dogs. Nervous Tony. Tony just wants to help his boyfriend. Emotionally hurt Steve. Flashbacks and nightmares mentioned. Tank.
Tony grunted when he felt the pressure of two rather than the customary one, and then they were breaching him. It wasn’t too much, but it was still a burn and a stretch, and Steve was not taking his time. Not today.
The laugh Steve earned was gold, and he smiled even wider. In the suit they were the same height, and Steve curved his arms around Tony’s shoulders. Once he was settled and holding on tight, Tony’s mask slipped down, and he shot up off the balcony.
A hand to the small of his back snapped him out of his frenzy. “Uh. Yeah. Just keeping these- for safe keeping. Can’t throw ‘em out, right? Could scan and burn them but that just seems wrong, doesn’t-”
Everything was becoming fuzzy, and he’s having a hard time remembering what’s going on. His eyelids grow heavy, and he doesn’t even snark about the needle they stick him in the arm with, vaguely aware that they were feeding him blood.
It hadn’t been the longest time Steve had been away on mission with his merry men. Two weeks still warranted worry and pining, and when Steve gave news he was going to be home Tony both relaxed in relief, and spasmed with joy, making for a very unfortunate looking fit he was sure.
He’d only said it to hurt Steve. He knew he’d been successful, and gone too far, the moment Steve’s eyes lit with anguish for a split second before his temper took back over.
I hope y'all enjoyed! I like having them do some kinky spice up their sex lives things without them being officially into BDSM. Unless they're in a dom/sub AU,. Then it's all aboard.
Pepper glared between the two and then sighed. “Alright. In you get. We don’t want to keep the sharks waiting.” Happy helped her into the limo, and Steve and Tony followed, doing their best to look appropriately chastised.
“And now, I must descent to my mad scientist lair.” Tony announced. He gave Steve’s ass a quick and discreet squeeze as he left the two in the communal kitchen, heading to the elevator and still red in the cheeks.
It wasn’t the first time they had tried something new in their sex life. Tony was big on keeping things fresh and exciting with these random “sexcapades.” Sometimes they were minor and didn’t require anything but a question, and other times they were more extreme and required discussion and preparation.
“Nothing?” Steve gauked as he took in the look on Tony’s face, the razor on the floor, and the kit on the table. One hand came up to his face and touched his upper lip. At first Tony though Steve was pissed, but then he burst into laughter. The kind of true laughter that adults didn’t laugh often.
Tony’s thoughts of sucking Steve’s brains out through his dick were rudely interrupted by the voice of his very own A.I.
At first he didn’t think Tony was in, but then he heard his voice and Steve relaxed minutely. Tony would sit on the sink and babble at him to make the shower easier. Even better, Steve wouldn’t have to ask him to.
“Steve! Shit!” Tony shouted, and then his entire body tensed and shuddered. Steve’s lips parted and he massaged Tony’s cheeks through his climax. There was something satisfying and hot as heck about watching Tony cum from dry humping a pillow while being spanked.
“Yeah. But he still loves you.” Steve remarked, leaning back on the edge of a work table. At that moment Tank came up and threw his paws onto Tony’s shoulders, making them the same height, and went on mission Clean-Tony’s-Face.
He’s not sure about all of that. What he is sure of is he’s sick of it. Sick of the nightmares that had him avoiding sleep, and that plagued him when he couldn’t resist it anymore. Sick of his own short temper, and the way everything new felt utterly and completely overwhelming.
The rant Tony had been on about Steve’s excessive strength abruptly ended and he raised an eyebrow, his expression screaming ‘oh really?’
With the new angle, it wasn’t long before all bets were off. Tony let his head fall forward to rest against the desk, and he released some of the most pornographic sounds he ever had. And he’d actually made sex tapes.
Today was one of those days. And it was also one of those times that Tony’s noncompliance royally pissed Steve off.
Tony’s touch was firm, but not hurtful, as he ran his hands from Steve’s shoulders and down his sides to grip his hips. It was the touch of someone who needed to reassure themselves with the concrete existence of something, or someone. He pulled, forcing Steve’s ass back a bit more, and then his hands were gone.
When he reached Steve’s side of the bed he had to risk blocking out some light. He did so slowly, and then stayed absolutely still. Steve wiggled his nose but otherwise was unaffected. Perfect.
That earns him a huff and a small smirk, and Steve grins, the toothy shining one Tony loved so much.
Tony took his time getting ready. The unhurried pace was relaxing and reassuring. Steve tuned out everything except for Tony’s hands. They knotted his tie, and slid smoothly down the cloth to ensure it was laying just right. One hand moved up to his hair to tweak a few pieces, and that’s when Steve realized Tony was watching him in the mirror.
“It’s no problem.” Tony cocked his head to the side, studying Steve, calculating the situation, and yup, he was going for it. Reckless or not. His instincts could be wrong, but not Pepper’s.
Tony shrugged. “Makes sense to me. I think we all forget you were thrown into the future just a week ago now. You need a car? I have plenty.”
More time ticked by until night swallowed him. Under the cover of darkness, he felt more at peace, and some tension drained from his shoulders.
The sound Tony made could only be described as half sob and half laugh. Almost? That was an understatement. He’d been tortuously built up to the precipice and kept there for too long. He moved to grab himself. One jerk and he’d be done. A hand grabbed his wrist and his dick actually twitched.
“What? Why?” Steve straightened, trying to get a look at any part of the chair. Had they broken it? Stained it beyond repair?
“That’d be nice. Thanks, Tony.” Steve replied with a slight smile, genuine appreciation lighting in his sapphire blue eyes.
With so many miles to go and danger still on their tail Tony couldn’t remove Steve’s uniform, and resigned that he would have to work around it.
By the time they landed back on the Avengers tower rooftop, dawn was crawling up the horizon, and even Steve’s advanced stamina was waning. Tony’s mask slid open to reveal a grin so gleeful it was nearly maniacal. He took a moment to admire Steve’s completely pinkened face, and the way his hair was so tousled it looked like he was going for an electrocuted Einstein look. It was irresistible, and Tony brought their lips together in a fierce kiss.
Hurt Steve Rogers. Rescue/escape. Hurt/Comfort. Liberties taken with science and super soldier serum because it’s made up and I can.
When Steve scooped him up bridal style Tony emitted a squawk of indignation, which was ignored, and then he didn’t really care because he was being carefully lowered into sudsy, bubbly, hot, scented bath water.
The doors closed, and Tony rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, waiting for the moment. The elevator passed the floor dedicated to the Avengers' offices and Steve frowned, head quirked to the side.
Again Tony interrupted him. “I swear Rogers, if you’re about to say it wasn’t the first time I’m gagging you.” He grabbed Steve’s wrists and guided his hands to the edge of the dresser. Taking the hint, Steve braced himself on it, a thrill running down his spine.
Now that he’d conceded defeat, even if just for a bit, Tony took the time to mentally file all of his projects away. Without all of them at the front of his mind he was able to focus on the here and now; the sound of rushing water, the heat of Steve’s body against his own, the combined scents of lavender and peppermint. And huh, yeah, he did feel really shitty, and his head definitely wasn’t supposed to feel like a bowling ball. He sagged, leaning more of his weight on Steve, who bless his heart, didn’t utter the ‘I told you so’ he deserved to.
Laughing, Steve straightened. “Alright, buddy. Sit.” Tank’s butt hit the ground fast and he looked up at Steve with the proudest, happiest face either of them had ever seen.
“Change into these. Exactly these. Then sit your ass in bed.” Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek and went back to the elevator. As he’d asked, the lift was back and inside of it were bags of take out.
I’m so sorry for going MIA on this. Life has been hectic, in both kind and not kind ways. So here’s a short simple fluff to get back into the swing of things!
“You should have lead with that.” Steve scooted his way up the bed to lean against the headboard. Blessedly, he already seemed a bit more relaxed. Getting him to sleep would be more of a challenge. Steve had an annoyingly self-destructive sense of duty.
Steve leaned down and pressed a kiss to one of Tony’s asscheeks. “Alright, shellhead. But I’m starting us off slow.”
How much Tony was enjoying it was enticing as well. His body twitched, and his hips moved in aborted jerks every time the hairbrush met his flesh. Steve grabbed one cheek and growled at how hot and red it was, while he brought the brush down on the other cheek.
After Steve deemed his dental records properly embedded into Tony’s shoulder, he released his hold and then soothed his tongue over it. The imprint was already bruised with small dots of red peppered in.
It wasn’t until he’d finished the cup before he set it down and clapped his hands together. “Alright! Pull up the specs for the communal level. If it’s going to hold up to multiple super peeps it’s going to need a serious overhaul!”
They became a fascination for Steve within weeks. When Tony would fall asleep during a movie Steve would trace the contours of his fingers, and the lines across his palms. When Tony was working and Steve was sketching on the couch, it was usually Tony’s hands he was drawing. It was only a short while before he could draw them from memory, and then he figured that was creepy and he should stop. He didn’t.
The sound of the door shutting behind Pepper jolts him from his reverie and he bolts up and after her. He could torture himself with thoughts about Steve another time.
Steve didn’t seem to be completely aware of his surroundings, let alone Tony’s words, but he did chuckle weakly. That was all the response Tony got. Panic racketed up into his throat, and tears stung his eyes.
Steve did his best to keep his eyes above neck level. It didn’t work like he’d hoped. As the testing progressed, Tony’s hair got wetter, until it was curly and clinging to his forehead. Steve wondered if he could get it do that with a different kind of exercise.
It wasn’t that he was offended by the pet name. It was that it felt like it belonged in the same category as boo bear, or snookums.
“I take it back! I would rather him be late than look like this! Let alone the both of you! Are you two part octopus now? The press is going to have a field day! You couldn’t have at least tried to cover up?”
“Oh shove it, Steve. He’s your boy through and through.” Tony bent down to unhook Tank’s leash and ruffle the shaggy hair on top of his head while Steve watched with a grin. As soon as he’s freed Tank dashed around the shop. It was a habit after his walkies. He had to do a good frolic around to express his joy. Tony had no idea how he could possibly still have energy.
When he first felt the floor shake and heard the distant sound of what had to be an explosion, he assumed the sensory deprivation hallucinations had started. It wasn’t until the sounds grew closer, and his captors’ shouting became more panicked that he thought maybe he wasn’t imagining things. He maneuvered himself into a corner of the room and waited.
The group took off at a jog to a nearby medical tent, Tony clutching Steve’s hand and eyes hard with conviction.
First off. Thank you and love to all the bookmarkers, kudo givers, and commenters. You all give me liiiife!
Panicked, Steve frantically dug his phone out of his jacket pocket. “Did we get called in? Why didn’t I get-”
Steve chuckled and gave Tony a little squeeze. “I’ll be in the kitchen upstairs then. Gonna make enough for the whole team.”
“Oh, it did. Don’t worry. He should be used to shit like this by now.” Without any hesitation Tony resumed their pace as if they hadn’t just been interrupted by Tony’s best friend catching the entire show. Dick balls deep, Steve’s pale ass, and all.
The two sat down and rested against the rotting wood. Steve leaned his head back and closed his eyes, forehead shining with sweat, which spoke volumes to the pain he was in.
Pepper didn’t condone him drinking caffeine after four in the afternoon. It being eight in the evening, she was definitely out. Bruce was in self-inflicted solitary for the day, and Tony doubted he’d end it early just to bring Tony coffee. Natasha, Clint and Thor were still at SHIELD negotiating travel agreements for the prisoner Loki.
Both men froze and Steve’s head jerked to look at the old fashioned clock he insisted on having, and then down at the rumpled mess that was Tony and himself. Their suits were wrinkled, their shirts untucked, and ties loosened.
Sam must have assured the woman they would let her know if they had any questions, because she stepped away to give them some space.
Steve slowed down to a full stop. His expression was pinched with pain and exhaustion, and Tony nearly whooped in victory when Steve motioned to a nearby fallen tree. Steve the ever stubborn didn’t need to know he was exaggerating his own exhaustion in order to make Steve give himself a rest.
Tony didn’t get sick. It wasn’t allowed, as decreed by himself. At the faintest sign of illness he loaded himself with remedies and preventatives. But he wasn’t sick, he had allergies, newly developed allergies kicking his ass.
“Tony, you’re a fighter. So fight, you hear me?” He’s not aware of where they’re going, or that they’ve reached the double doors to the O.R. until a nurse stops, forcing him to come up short.
It wasn’t long after Steve had let go of his preconceived opinions of the genius and looked passed the file, that he realized he liked him as a person, and it was even less time before he realized that liking him as a person had lifted a veil, and he could see how damn good-looking he was too.
It still took some coaxing from Tony for Steve to use a heavier grip because the big ole sweetheart was still apprehensive of his own strength. If you asked Tony, Steve was more hyper aware of what he could do than any other person, living or dead.
“Tony, it’s me. It’s Steve.” He sounded breathless, and raspier than normal, but there was no denying it was Steve’s voice.
The pressure on his throat was just enough to restrict his airflow without cutting it off completely, and his eyelids fluttered shut on an exhale that wheezed. His hands moved from where they were clutched to Steve’s waist to tug his shirt out from his waistband.
Tony’s grin widened and he walked up to Steve. “Wouldn’t be much of a date without it. I’m taking a leaf from Alladin’s book and I’m going to show you the world.”
Tony wasn’t surprised Jarvis betrayed him. He always told Steve the truth unless explicitly and specifically directed otherwise, and even then he found a way around it 90% of the time. He could hear Steve’s exasperated eye roll that unquestionably accompanied his sigh. “Alright, knucklehead. I’m calling Code Kissing the Choo Choo.”
“Hm?” Tony dragged his eyes from the good captain, and his innocent yet nearly pornographic act of re-hydrating.
Tony fidgeted and then plowed on. “Well, you are a pets guy, and the science backs it up. So I looked into it and I found this place that will work with you to train your dog as a service dog, so then I was like, awesome, I’ll get Steve a puppy!”
Tony’s expression got caught between disturbed, and adoringly amused before he shook his head. “You’re a dork.”
Night came before they had made it another mile. It made their going even slower. Fatigue and exhaustion were finally catching up to Tony. What was more worrisome was that they were catching up to Steve.
Flushed a gorgeous pink from his cheeks down his neck, Steve focused on Tony’s expression who’s eyelashes fluttered and mouth dropped open in a long, shuddering gasp. Steve answered him with an equally enthusiastic moan as Tony’s heat slowly engulfed his length.
Taking some time to ease his nerves Steve squeezed and massaged the perky globes displayed for him. Already a fan of giving Tony’s ass the occasional swat, he was definitely into going a little further a try.
“I’ll be back around one.” He leaned over and traced his fingers down Steve’s cheek and jaw to grab his chin. Steve visibly shivered and Tony smirked. “Be here if you want me to take care of that hankering, soldier.”
“Yeah. Dogs are proven to reduce stress, anxiety and depression. They can also be trained to be a PTSD service dog. So, you could do that. If you want. I reserved you a spot just in case. I figured you’d want to train him yourself. Seems more your speed.”
Tony stopped dead in his tracks and stared at the dog, who sat still, wagging his tail, and looking up at them cheerfully. Tony tore his eyes away to look at the dog’s “profile.”
After what felt like minutes to him but had only been seconds Tony was fully seated. He felt as overstuffed as the chair they were perched on. Not that it really mattered, but sometimes he wondered if Steve’s dick had always been so big, or if the serum had enlarged it to make him proportional.
So, Tony posted himself in the lobby of the tower. It was almost always empty, and it was kind of boring, but he refused to miss Steve’s arrival. He passed the time getting lost in plans to make the lobby into a cool hang out spot for Peter and friends, and when the automatic doors finally slid open to reveal the good Captain, Tony had nearly completed them.
This one was inspired by a head canon my buddy Lucien and I have. And I'm so freaking happy I wrote it. Tank may have to return in future stories!
Hours went by, and every time the elevator doors opened Tony perked up only to deflate, until finally they slid open to reveal his hunkasaurus rex.
It wasn’t until Steve had a properly long and physically exhausting day that Tony initiated mission Trim the Hedge. The genius knew a lot of things, and one of them was that unless Steve was properly put through what his body considered rigorous activity, he was a light sleeper. It’s unclear whether this was a factor of the serum, or his time fighting in WW2. Probably both.
Sometimes, most times, Tony reacted this way when Steve got back from a no communications mission. Steve didn’t blame him. Rather he understood. It was the same fear he felt when Tony was in a battle, that Tony would get hurt, would die.
The ambulance comes to a jolted stop, and the doors are torn open. The paramedics don’t wait for Steve as they unload Tony. There’s so many nurses and doctors Steve nearly gets lost in them. Taking advantage of his height and presence, he gets back to Tony’s side as he’s loaded on a larger hospital stretcher.
“Just for awhile. I need to get my bearings, see the U.S. It’s a whole new world to me. I don’t know it anymore.” Steve folded his arms, resting back against one of Tony’s work benches. “If we get called in I’ll have Natasha pick me up in the quinjet.”
His first aid knowledge wasn’t terribly broad, but he knew enough. He firmly swept over and around the gash with alcohol swabs, and then pressed them further into it to try to remove as much bacteria as possible. Steve winced and hissed a bit but didn’t squirm. When he was finished he dressed it best he could. The bandages wrapped around Steve’s torso, and cut across the star on his chest. It gave Tony a foreboding feeling.
As the minutes ticked on Tony thought he was going to lose his mind. His nerve endings were on fire, and Steve was sucking across his collar bones, paying no mind to the needy way Tony was pulling on his blonde hair.
Eyes closed now, Tony struggled to stay awake. He should never have let himself be lulled into such relaxation. It allowed everything to catch up. The running nose, watering eyes, itching throat, and a head full of cotton built on days of little to no sleep or food was too much to contend with. His plans of giving Steve the slip were mere whispers now, and he drifted closer to sleep.
The woman’s face, Carolyn her name tag read, fell and she looked at Hugo. “When we brought him in we scanned for a microchip like we always do. He had one, but when we called the owners..” She sighed, and there was anger mixed with the sadness now. “His owners said they didn’t want him anymore. Which normally means they lost him on purpose.”
He didn’t add or replace as much as he subtracted. He purposely would remove the throw pillows from a room, and within days they would be replaced by worn in ones of various designs.
Spicing up their sex life. Kink exploration. Impact play. Trying new things doesn’t always mean liking them.
“Tony, you need to stay still. It’s okay, it’s just Steve and the paramedics. You’re going to be okay.” He’s afraid that he’s lying.
Tony had a theory that Tank knew what they were saying, and acted premeditatedly at least 95% of the time. Which is why the CRASH that followed Steve’s sentence didn’t surprise him.
All he can see is people milling about him, most in panic and others in work mode. The sky slides from view to be replaced with the roof of the ambulance. He reflects that out of all the big bads he’s fought, out of all the close calls and near death situations, he might just die today from a stab wound administered by a citizen with a grudge.
There was the sound of more lube, and then Tony pulled Steve’s ass even further toward him with one hand, forcing the taller of the two to bend slightly, and then the hot head of his dick was against Steve’s hole and he groaned in anticipation.
Emotion rose into his throat again and he whispered, “I know, Steve. I will. Just...Not yet.” Tony leaned his head back and tears freely rolled down his cheeks and behind his ears.
It wasn’t the first time one of them had snapped and resorted to working out their frustrations sexually. It made for a good outlet for their rage, that was for sure. And hey, nobody had to swallow their anger, they didn’t throw fists, and they got to get off. Screw anyone who said angry sex was unhealthy for a relationship.
What he was sick of the most was the small things that set him off. One would think that gunfire and explosions out on the field would give him flashbacks, but no. It was cold, it was water, it was trains, and it was the stupid ice cubes in his drink.
There were many things Steve liked, some things he loved, and only a few things he was obsessed with.
So, instead of mulling over what Sam and Tony could possibly be up to, he had been in the gym, beating the shit out of equipment, his go to activity after a “panic attack” the therapist had called it.
He waited until Steve’s snoring evened out, and then padded to the bathroom where he’d hidden a shaving go-kit. After pulling it out of the towel closet he paused, ears raising to make sure Steve was still asleep. The man didn’t snore loudly, so it took him a moment to pick up on it. All systems go.
But Steve was still again, lost in a dreamscape that at least didn’t seem horrible, if his peaceful, relaxed expression was anything to go by. There was a part of him that wanted to let him sleep. Lord knew he’d earned it. But the other part of him just wanted to see his eyes and his smile. It wanted to talk with him and laugh with him and fight about everything and nothing all the while knowing that it was only because deep down they both just loved the fight as much as anything else. It wanted more than he could have possibly imagined.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean-” Steve stopped mid sentence and furrowed his brow at Tony, running his fingers across the fabric at his wrist. “You changed?”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said. There was something slow and soft about his voice. Like finding the words he wanted was a struggle and getting the air to say them even moreso. “I guess…I guess if you’re watching this, things didn’t go so well. For me, at least. I hope they went well for you. I need you to know that that’s all I want — more than anything — is for you to get out of this.” Steve winced. His eyes squeezed shut with a grimace he couldn’t contain. God, he was in pain and it broke Tony’s heart. Steve’s face relaxed and he opened his mouth wide, moving his jaw back and forth before speaking again.
And that was how the team found them. Vision and Wanda first, then Rhodey and Wilson flying in and finally Nat and Clint, landing in a backup jet, hot and ready to whisk them away. There weren’t even very many entries left in FRIDAY’s logs. Of course, that was because the nanotech had reached critical mass and the last decision FRIDAY made before going offline was to direct all the power she could into one strong signal burst before leaving them to whatever ambient heat remained and a prayer.
Tony woke with a start. There was a light buzz in his ears and his eyes felt gummy. He recognized that feeling, and groaned. There weren’t a lot of things he hated more than waking up from a drugged sleep. At least he wasn’t tied down or tethered to an IV bag this time. He took a deep breath and forced his eyes open.
Tony watched Steve pick up the sandwich, listened for the crunch of the crust and lettuce and onion and couldn’t help but feel a small swell of satisfaction as Steve’s eyes closed while he chewed.
Tony watched Steve’s video again. And again, and again, And when he couldn’t do it anymore he turned his attention back to the laptop and tried to occupy himself with figuring out why and how the nanites had failed. Was it the temperature? The composition? The programming? The answer had to be there, but his thoughts were like mud and soon he pushed the laptop away and grabbed the watch. Maybe he’d focus on the wearables for a little while. A glasses display. A more portable gauntlet. After all, he’d already put FRIDAY into a toaster and a wristwatch. Surely he could expand on that and leave the nanosuit for another crisis.
He’s sure they’d only made it another mile before Steve tripped and fell to his knees. Tony steadied him by the shoulders and ducked his head to try to catch his eye.
All of them were common enough household items. He’s sure Tony had actual props for this, but had chosen not to put them out, predicting that it would be too much for Steve, which he appreciated, because he was right.
It had been three days. Tony knew, because he and Jarvis had been counting. To the naked eye Steve seemed fine, but anyone that really knew him could see the subtle signs that he was pushing himself too hard. Again. This time he’d bounced from a mission, to natural disaster relief, to drills, to volunteering at the local soup kitchen. All very worthy and noble causes of course, but he wasn’t invincible, no matter how much the world believed him to be.
When Tony had first mentioned this particular kink, Steve had been worried for many reasons. One of them being that if he was on the receiving end he’d freak out. But it wasn’t like drowning, and as long as he could see Tony’s face, he knew he was okay, and he could surrender to the other physical sensations it provided.
If they got called in, they’d handle it, but right now, they really needed to handle something else.
What had only been days but felt like months of sexual tension rose inside Steve, and he moved forward, backing Tony up until his butt hit some surface, he didn’t know or care what. Steve crowded him and took and gave, hands slipping further down Tony’s waist…
He’d even put stamps on the things. “The postal service needs our support, Tony.” Sometimes they were silly or cute stamps that Tony imagined made Steve smile. Otherwise they were patriotic, or special edition. Tony was sure Steve collected stamps. That seemed like an old person thing to do.
Instead he played with Steve’s scarf. It was the one with the reindeer pattern. It didn’t match the rest of his outfit at all, which would normally be annoying to Tony. Today it was just endearing. Unable to help himself, he kept interrupting their conversation to stand up on his tiptoes and press kisses to different parts of Steve’s face. His nose, left corner of mouth, jaw line, right corner of mouth, cheek…
The two settled in, and Tony turned on The Two Towers, a favorite comfort movie of theirs. He didn’t spend much time watching it, focusing instead on Steve. The super soldier devoured both boxes, confirming Tony’s suspicions he hadn’t been eating enough. Tony was expecting him to be hit by a food coma that would knock him out, but instead Steve pulled out his phone, presumably checking his email, and what Tony had cleared from his calendar. Tony kind of wanted to yell at him, maybe chuck his phone against the wall. Instead he leaned his head against Steve’s shoulder.
“Knock yourself out. Any time. You wrote ‘em.” Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek and then caught sight of Tank with shreds of paper around. “Except the ones your dog ate.”
When they made it far enough into the nearby woods, Steve finally conceded them safe enough to rest a beat.
It had taken multiple conversations, and several educational sessions to convince Steve that asphyxiation during sex could indeed be safe, and not abusive. And furthermore that enjoying it it was nothing to be ashamed of.
Just as quickly as everything started silence fell. Moments later the door burst open, and as much as he hated himself for it, he had to close his eyes and shield his eyes from the light.
Patience wasn’t something Tony had in spades at the moment, and he slammed his hand against the back of the armchair they were sitting on to prove it. Or rather Steve was sitting on while Tony straddled his lap. What had started off as innocent shared chair snuggling, had quickly developed into a make out session, then into hungry hands and scattered clothes.
“Kum Kau. All your favorites.” Tony informed him as he pulled out three styrofoam takeaway boxes, one for him, two for Steve.
“Huh.” Tony picked up the mug and gave it a whiff before taking a small sip. It didn’t have as much sugar as he preferred, but it was strong. Stronger than most people brewed their coffee. “Not bad, Winghead.”
By the time they got to the cart Tony was shivering but also sweating in that way that only occurred when you were bundled up and active on a below freezing day.
That was before Tony announced they would both be testing the equipment. Before Tony was in nothing but a tank top and a pair of jogger pants and covered in sweat.
Steve rumbled wordlessly, and then he straightened up, and jack hammered into Tony who decided he really didn’t want to delay their release any longer. He pushed himself to his elbows to better absorb the shocks, and arched his back just so. He could feel the bruises from Steve’s grip, and from where his hip bones were driving into his ass, already developing, and the desk started rocking more and more with each thrust.
Tony’s fingernails were cut short as always. It left the tips of Tony’s fingers exposed, but he said he preferred that over breaking, or losing, a nail. They drummed against the side of the watch case, and Steve let his head fall backwards to stare unabashedly.
The rush of love that came up through Tony’s chest shot up into his throat and split his face into a foolish grin. He smashed his lips against Steve’s while pulling him closer, completely ignoring that they had an audience.
It had only been two days since Steve had taken Tony up on his offer to stay at the tower, and he was already beginning to think he’d made a mistake. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
At the two hour mark Tony knew they had to move on, and he gave Steve a gentle nudge. “Come on. Sooner we get to base, sooner you can get some proper doctoring.”
“Says you.” Tony groused, but didn’t put up a fight when Steve busied himself with fixing Tony up. The taller shook his head, lips curled in fond amusement as he put the final touches on Tony’s attire. He took a step back, looked Tony up and down, and then nodded.
They mostly kept him locked in a small room with no food, sound, or light. Every so often they came in to rough him up. Otherwise, they seemed content to leave him there to rot and slowly lose his marbles.
“Where the hell are the others?” Tony finally demanded when they had to stop so he could catch his breath.
Not waiting or asking permission, Tony shoved the shield down so he could get a better look at Steve’s right side. Sure as shit there was a deep gash running over his ribs. It wouldn’t have been anything to worry about, except that if it got infected before it could heal, which it probably would, Steve would be at risk.
It had only been another half mile before Tony had to wrap an arm around Steve’s waist and take most of his super soldier weight. While his wounds weren’t life threatening, they were enough to make carrying Steve an even bigger struggle than it normally would be.
And then Tony saw what the mess was. All his letters from Steve were spilled across the floor. Tank had decided he liked one and was chewing it. A heat broke over Tony’s body.
Two strokes later and Steve was done. As soon as Tony felt the first warmth of Steve's release he leg go of his throat, and the rush of oxygen turned the crests of pleasure into tidal waves. He’s faintly aware of his own moans, and Tony following close behind him.
“Tank.” The dog’s ears perked and Steve grinned. “You like the sound of that? Tank?” The dog barked and started dancing from foot to foot, which must have been what Steve had mistaken for the potty dance sound earlier.
“Uh. Yeah, of course. What do you need?” Steve rubbed a sweaty palm against his leg. There was no way to look anywhere but down at Tony without seeming like a jerk or a weirdo.
It didn’t matter that Steve was the one who wrote them. Tony was the one who had stored them here to covet and read like a housewife waiting on her husband to return from war. Getting over his initial shock, he dropped to his knees and started gathering what he could towards himself like a goblin scooping up treasure, hiding it with his body.
“I know that.” Tony snapped back. “It doesn’t change the fact that I have been freaking the hell out for the entire. Week!” He reached around and blindly unfastened Steve’s pants, and then pulled them and his briefs down in one go, leaving them to puddle around his ankles.
It had started out small, like most obsessions did. It was the cuts and burns, old and new, that covered them. It was that Steve didn’t have to feel them to know how weathered and rough they were.
Tony kept a relentless pace, and then he changed the angle of his hips and Steve is lost in an electrical current of bliss. He’s only vaguely aware of things rattling across the top of the dresser before falling to the floor. It just added to the noise of their slapping skin, and their grunts and moans.
“Maybe I shouldn’t have made the walls so entirely sound proof.” Tony mused, drinking in the view of Steve’s perfectly sculpted body as he pounded into him.
It’s not long before Tony’s need to get inside Steve overruns his need not to hurt him. Not that he really would. They were careful when it came to prep.
Intrigued brown eyes met his, and a cocky smirk spread Tony’s lips. Now that Steve had that bright intoxicating gaze he was mad for, he allowed him to move. Tony arched the small of his back and sank onto Steve’s cock. As much as he wanted to just drop down, that obviously wasn’t Steve’s pace today, and he figured he could humor him. A little.
Steve’s fever only got worse, as Tony had thought it would and Steve had tried to tell him to forget about. Steve had accelerated healing, which was normally great, except for when bacteria got into his body. It took advantage of Steve’s accelerated cells to dig its claws of infection in quicker, and stronger, and then the skin would heal over it, trapping it in.
She stared at him, measured and blank, like she did when Tony was being thick skulled, and missing something that was plain and obvious to her. Which really wasn’t fair, because she was a secret ninja assassin spy.
After only seconds Steve released Tony’s wrists in favor of getting his hands on any other part of Tony he could. He scratched his nails down his sides and then grabbed his ass, squeezing his cheeks and then using his grip to press their hips flush together. Their clothed dicks rubbed against each other and Tony gasped sharply.
“It’s alright, Steve. There’s time to take a load off.” Tony slipped up behind him, taking up the role of big spoon. He couldn’t encompass Steve the way he’d like to, but he could still offer the firm pressure of his body against his back, a solid and reassuring presence.
“Then we go get the job done exhausted and sexually satisfied.” Tony cut him off. Before Steve could argue anymore Tony lifted him up bridal style and carried him into the tower and towards their private floor, relishing that he could.
And it wasn’t because it was facial hair. No no. It was because of the type of facial hair. Tony would love it if Steve grew a beard. But no, this was a straight up creepy Ron Jeremy mustache that did NOT belong on Steve Rogers’ face.
“Hey, there handsome!” Steve exclaimed and grabbed the dogs head, petting it behind the ears. The dog licked his face, and Steve felt a little lighter. “And what’s your name?”
“Hey, that’s the point of Code Kissing the Choo Choo. To stop the other from killing themselves.” Tony kept up the massage, but reduced the amount of pressure he was using.
As usual, he woke up before the sun. Not one for lounging in bed, he immediately sat up and stretched out his back. After he allowed himself a long yawn he reached for the blanket to throw it off, and realized something that made him pause.
Just then Tank let out an excited bark and they both looked down at him in surprise. So far he’d taken well to his training, and instead of sniffing around and reacting to the busy world around them, he’d been sitting beside Steve, head on a swivel, “checking his six” as Steve would call it.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “Not all of us have the impulse control of a teenage boy.” All the same she did slide over to stand by him, wrapping an elegant arm around his waist. “Though if you do become too distracted let me know. I’m not above reaping the benefits of your deviance.”
“Fucking jesus.” Tony let his head thud down against his work table. He had work to do. He always had work to do. Which is exactly why this shit was not allowed. He reached down the table, blindly grasping around until he found the bottle he was looking for. The pills rattled sweetly as he pulled it towards him.
“Shut. Up.” Steve yanked Tony’s jeans down and pushed down on his back, forcing Tony to brace his hands on the cleared off desk.
The thighs bracketing Steve bunched with tension and then relaxed, while Tony’s lips parted. Each exhale had an audible sound to it, and Steve knew Tony had finally surrendered completely. He rewarded him by leaning forward and latching onto his throat, sucking hard and slow, pleased with the ragged whimper it pulled from Tony.
“Nope, you don’t get to ‘Tony’ me, Cap. I’m calling Code Kissing the Choo Choo.” The elevator slowed to a stop, but the doors remained closed.
Immediately Steve relaxed, and his concern broke into a dopey smile. “Good.” He returned to smearing peanut butter on his five pieces of toast, and Tony poured himself some more coffee while he pointedly ignored the gagging faces Clint was making.
“Hear that, Steve? We made it. You’re going to be okay. Helps on the way.” Tony wheezed. In moments a stretcher appeared next to them, and Natasha and a few agents were helping move Steve onto it.
Tony didn’t respond with anything near Steve’s concern. He just rolled over and whined. “Let’s be late.”
“You were supposed to outlive me.” He finally rasped, and then hung his head on a hitching exhale. “You were supposed to outlive me. You would have. But you just had to jump on one more damn grenade.”
“No really. I think I should take the blame for this one. I did too good a job on the walls.” Tony continued, and then he wrapped a hand around Steve’s dick and stripped it as he leaned forward to whisper gruffly, “cum for me Steve.”
The prep Steve gave him was perfunctory at best. Quick, mechanical, and hard. Steve’s fingers pushed, twisted, and scissored while his free hand gripped Tony by the hip, keeping him just as he wanted him no matter how Tony squirmed.
Tony aimed to a new spot. His plans were foiled when Steve grabbed his wrists and pinned him to the bed.
He handed Tony a water bottle and then leaned against a nearby tree, breathing heavily and brows furrowed slightly. It was more than Steve ever let on, and Tony’s chest spasmed in panic.
“Yes.” Tony breathed. Even if Steve didn’t end up liking this all that much, the eagerness in Tony’s voice was arousing in itself.
“What? That I stopped you from overdosing on allergy medication, and I’m forcing you to rest before you keel over?”
Hastily, Steve focused on putting himself back together. “Sorry, doll, but you’re going to have to wait for the grand finale until after.”
Steve looked down at his half hard dick and shrugged. “I liked certain aspects. And I didn’t not like it. You made some first rate noises.”
Two hands grabbed Tony by the waist and then yanked him backwards as Steve slammed his hips forward. Tony snapped his head back and gritted his teeth, hissing between them. Steve had prepped him enough to not do any actual damage, but it still hurt, and was too much, too quick, too overwhelming.
“Fucking jesus, Steve.” Tony panted at the ceiling, head tipped back and eyes closed. Two of Steve’s fingers were buried inside Tony’s ass, scissoring and twirling to open him up. Whether quick or unhurried, Steve’s fingering skills were wickedly good. Today he was going slow, and it was both exquisite and maddening.
“I cleared your calendar.” Steve opened his mouth to argue, but Tony steam rolled on. “Don’t worry, I checked to make sure nothing was time sensitive or life threatening.”
Each letter was encased in a thick custom stationery envelope that had a vintage feel and look to it. Steve would write the Sent and Receive information himself, always ever so careful to make it both beautiful and legible even though it was delivered by hand. From Steve’s hand to the pile of Tony’s fan mail.
He swallowed a few more times, because he liked to get Steve wound up, until Steve’s hand tangled itself in his hair and gave it an urging tug. Tony pulled off completely and smirked up at his lover.
“I’m not maniacally obsessive.” Steve grumbled, which Tony ignored. He gave his hand a little pull, and set off towards their room, Steve following behind obediently. Tony stopped by their bed where he had laid out a set of clothes for Steve.
“Nope. Not at all, big guy. I love it.” Tony smiled and pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek, then glared in challenge at Clint.
Tony leapt to his feet and launched himself over the back of the couch. Thankfully Steve had quick reflexes and he caught Tony in his open arms rather than Tony straight up football tackling him.
It wasn’t until after Steve had left and Tony was halfway dressed that he realized he hadn’t felt his usual aversion to being called doll. He paused in buttoning his jeans and looked upwards at the ceiling.
Tony is out of it enough he begins to misidentify his surroundings. He attempts to sit up, but he’s held down by straps securing him to the stretcher.
With a swipe of her hand Pepper vanished the holograms of the tower. Her eyes twinkled with mischief as she lead him passed the kitchen and the oblivious Steve. Tony gave him a mock salute, and Steve shook his head with a lopsided grin that absolutely did not give Tony butterflies.
Employing the ninja precision he’d learned from Tasha, he silently laid the shaving kit out on the nightstand. Once everything was in it’s rightful place he grabbed the shaving cream and then stood there staring at Steve nervously.
“What am I supposed to do, Steve?” His voice trembled as much as his hands did. “You were the glue. You were the fucking bright shining beacon. You were my beacon.” He huffed a raw, humorless laugh and shook his head.
There was a ruler that was tempting, a belt that he winced at, a hairbrush, and a wooden spatula. He picked up the hairbrush and tested the heft of it, giving it a practice swing. It was wider than the other options, and he liked the surface area. He didn’t want to leave cuts or welts. Pleased with his decision, he took a moment to gently caress Tony’s lower back.
Apparently this was the wrong thing to say. Not that Tony notices, eyes drifting closed and then peaking open again, as if battling sleep. Steve throws his head up to look at the paramedics. There’s a crack in his I-Must-Be-Strong-For-Tony armor, showing how scared he really is.
“Just, do one thing for me.” Tony moved around the table and towards Steve, the look in his eyes shifting to something that made Steve’s pulse rabbit and could only be described as provocative. Tony stopped inches from him, having to tilt his head up to make eye contact. Steve went completely still.
Both men freeze, and Steve ducked his head down and away. There was no mistaking that voice. And he could NOT look him in the eye in nothing but his birthday suit, ass full of dick.
Slowly, things became more mismatched. It set Tony’s teeth on edge, but the effect it had on Steve was visible, and if the small compromises he was making did that, he was more than okay with it.
The only mail that was delivered straight to him was from youngsters who loved Iron Man. Then he started dating Steve, and at least once a week a letter from Steve would be somewhere hidden in that pile.
Just as Tony started accepting that the usually doable distance was going to defeat them, the sounds of trucks rumbling, and people walking and talking started to filter through the trees. Hysterical hope flared through him, and gave him a final spur of energy.
Steve expected a fast, wild ride right off the bat. Surprising him, Tony opted for a lazy pace, as if they were taking a leisurely stroll. It allowed Steve to truly take in the view, and absorb every detail. The thousands of lights below were comforting in their presence, and though the wisps of clouds ghosted through his clothes, leaving him damp with chill, it felt ethereal.
Steve shuffled them closer to the tub. Even though he could have Jarvis start up the jets, he liked to do it himself, and he fiddled one handed with the knobs to the hot tub sized bath, getting the temperature just right and adding some scented oils.
So, yes he had been trying to avoid Tony for the past two days, until he couldn’t find a polite way to decline Pepper’s offer of lunch, and found himself seated with Tony and Pepper, sharing what Tony swore was the best pizza in New York.
“Hearing and listening are two different things, Tony.” Steve snapped, picking up on an earlier thread of their argument. And then he let go of Tony’s dick, and his climax hit him like an avalanche. It slammed into him, swallowed him, and swept him away. He couldn’t even breathe through it, mouth hung open and entire body going taught with it.
It was their first winter together, and with Steve’s trepidation of the cold, and it being New York, the two had bundled up significantly. Sweaters, coats, gloves, scarves, boots, and hats. And in Steve’s case, earmuffs.
Steve stared unseeingly at the TV. Though Tony was rubbing his leg, his posture began to relax as well. “Can’t you invent something that makes it so we never have to sleep?”
Steve had hope that they could work through the distance between him and Tony. He had been dead serious when he told Fury that he wanted Tony as his science officer. Tony was the ideal choice. Even if Steve still felt Tony’s lingering coldness towards him.
Steve smacks a hand on his forehead muttering, "Idiots." But when he sees the growing wonder on Tony's face, he turns hopeful eyes at him. "Well?"
"How do we take this thing down?" he calls out to Stark. Thor and Hulk are having a game of who can take out more AIM agents at the other side of the warehouse.
Tony raised an eyebrow at that. “Hope and her whatever?” Hank Pym was probably expecting her to spy for him.
“Redwing is still a baby with a brussel sprout addiction,” Sam said. “I doubt she can be on her own. She’s only ever been a city dinosaur.”
Steve organized and led the round-up of the remaining AIM soldiers over the next week. At least there weren’t that many to deal with and soon they were locked up on the cargo ship. They freed the remaining dinosaurs in captivity in the AIM camp and packed up the stolen technology. Nakia said, “My fellow Wakandans will come and remove all traces of vibranium when we have left.”
and lastly...i'm unsure if this is T+ or not, I can change the rating or only put a link to this one, it is nsfw (only for butt, nudity, and suggestive content)
And what Tony wanted most of all in that moment was an excellent excuse for skipping out on the Annual New Explorers’ Club Dinner. The gold-edged invitation sitting on his mahogany desk in front of him mocked him with the announcement and Fury’s personal greeting handwritten in the corner.
"I did not steal this armor! I made it myself!" Tony protests, indignant. All eyes turn towards him and he relents, slowly raising his hands to his head, "Don't shoot. I'm taking off the helmet."
For what it was worth, he’d made a more commercially viable version of that coffee machine which sold like hot cakes and one of the reasons why he could fund some of the expedition. He had no idea if Steve, who had to be daunted by all the new technology, was even still using the little machine.
“Redwing is cute,” Steve said. “Her beak is very sharp. We’ll need to watch her around the curtains.” He held up his arm, marked with scratches.
“Animal handlers. And, um, Miss Maximoff uses magic.” Now Rogers was looking at Tony, waiting for a reaction to the idea of bringing a magic user along.
Steve looks up and finds Tony jetting outside the ship like a bright beacon of red and gold in a sea black and pinpricks of stars. The tightness in his chest eases and he breathes a sigh of relief.
Steve shifted to one side, to be closer to Tony. “I don’t know about that entirely. A mix of magic and science fixed my health and gave me strength. So I see the benefits.”
Her point was underscored by the faded poster of Steve from the Zeppelin War still plastered on an old warehouse wall. Sam arched an eyebrow at Steve, who pointedly ignored the poster. “Lead on,” Steve said.
They were at the dessert course and Rhodey hadn’t run out of news about his recent promotion in the government defense forces or his girlfriend Carol.
A steward announced that dinner was served in the adjoining room. The expedition members immediately left for the dining room.
“I assumed it was different, but it’s not like we’re going a five-year voyage somewhere either. Talk to you later, Captain.”
