“Can I exchange my brain for a new one?” Steve groaned and eyed the expression on Tony’s face as he sat in the dark grey suit that he had worn for the reception, “Did we win?”
“So, did you like it?” Rhodey asked from where he was busy inspecting the upgraded armour, head buried under the opened torso.
“You have a daughter who watched a projection of you tell her that you loved her yesterday,” Steve dragged the words out, knowing that frustration was bleeding through but not caring, “Pepper watched your reactor float down a lake and had to hold herself together because she didn’t have any other option. Rhodey had to carry your body off the battlefield and then tell a public of strangers why his best friend was a hero.”
He shook his head of the thought and pulled out the flip phone, a familiarity to it that felt like the balance of a shield on his arm. There was never a response to it, a whole diary of obscure thoughts and dangerous truths sent in this one-way street, and Steve had long understood that Tony didn’t have the phone on him. Not the counterpart to this one, and that was fine. They had other means to contact now and Steve wasn’t really sending messages to a void to get a response. It was just a part of his life, a new reality that he didn’t question much.
She had stood rooted to the spot when she had seen Iron Man come hurtling towards the ground, chest burned black, as the snow kept falling around him. She had always been thrown off balance by them, hadn't she? The few men who had managed to make her want to stay. Want to grow roots. Want to see them branch out.
“We should leave,” he declared, putting down the bills he had brought, “The staff’s starting to give us looks. And I think they won’t like the conversation we’re going to have.”
“I’ll bring her pictures,” Pepper declared and they could do this, he could roll with the punches, “It was nice to chat, Steve.”
He had heard the sound first, a whip-crack of thunder hitting an unbreachable wall of magic. The resonance of the aftermath had been a silent ripple of still fear, and Rhodey had turned to see Thor first. In all the years he had known the man, he had exuded all the traits they had read about gods, but in that instant - in one flash of terrifying realization, Rhodey had seen something human. Thor had been staring straight at the target he had sent his power towards and Rhodey didn't have to look to know what had happened.
They never framed them and the collection now held the most mundane moments. His favourite was an out-of-focus teacup that meant nothing without context. It had been the day there had been a lightning strike too different to be considered normal and the team had been called in by Peggy. That was the day they had met Thor, a much different and yet same boisterous son of Odin, and Tony had resolved the situation by inviting him over for tea.
"Coffee does nothing for him," Tony blearily looked at the book resting on Steve's chest now and frowned at it till Steve placed it on the bedside table, "Is that Tasha's copy?"
"And the company?" he asked just to see Steve turn around, which he did. Steve's face softened a bit more at the question and Tony could write theories, could build equations around the expressions that face built around every emotion. The tilt of a disapproving nose, the curve of a fond laugh line, the slope of a surprised brow - he could explain everything.
God, could he be any more inadequate? Seven years of nothing more than missed chances and made-up reasons, and he still couldn't fill three words with the right meaning.
But Tony smiled, warmer than he would have in a safer but colder past. He smiled and Steve knew that the sentence would never find way into the open.
“Here,” Pepper nodded in the direction of the house and shook her head vaguely, “I don’t know when I’ll be coming back. Not – not for a few days maybe. And I’d feel better if it wasn’t empty either.”
knew Nat kept, "Or apple juice? She'd have both, if I remember it right – what do I call you, mirror-me?"
A holographic alert flashed between them and Steve caught Nat’s eyes, nodding at the interruption and she tapped the light signaling the message. The icon came to clarity and Steve noted that it was Rhodey’s, letting Nat get to it and focusing on getting a cloth to wipe the coffee that had spilt over on the counter during their conversation.
Tony had lived here for five years. He had given these walls his laughter, fears, wonder, and dreams. He had been safe, been somebody’s family, until they had come knocking on his door to offer him a chance. To ask for a chance at getting something back themselves.
Things didn’t go downhill, not for a while. Howard was in a great mood, eyes alight with joy and a wonder that went deeper than Steve had ever seen in any of his pictures. He did a double take when he saw Steve and his smile became confused before he pulled it back, engaging both of them in conversation. For once Steve was glad of having let his beard grow back out and the hair dye he had bought the previous week.
Potts didn't seem fazed by the statement and stayed in place as Tony raised an alarm anyway, sending out a priority alert to Sam just in case Steve's team might be interested.
“Tell me after we wake up,” he suggested, patting a soft rhythm against Tony’s skin as his eyes closed.
“I did that once before,” Steve reminded him and looked ahead at the street they were entering, bright against his eye, “I think I can handle this.”
"I never thought I'd say this but, I wish I wasn't younger," Tony grit his teeth as he missed the connection of the nano-virus and had to feel out the walls for the failsafe, "My kingdom for a flashlight."
He put the photo were it belonged and walked out, hoping Tony had escaped too, his eyes sharp as he made his way to their agreed spot.
The wheel was familiar under his fingers and he took a deep breath before turning the key into ignition. One final trip, he could do this.
"They look good," Tony replied and pulled up the next row of data. He had spent the last three hours ironing out every detail over the latest upgrades to the War Machine armour, debating every suggestion from its pilot and now he could
The reactor faded this time and Steve kept waiting. He waited when Pepper kissed Tony’s still cheek, waited as Peter failed at hiding his sobs, waited till Rhodey walked forward to place a hand on Pepper’s shoulder.
"Kang, he's a conqueror from multiple time points," Potts twisted his wedding band absently as he exhaled tiredly, "He had some personal vendetta in the beginning but then it devolved into ‘fixing' time in general. He's related to Reed here, but not this one in particular."
It had been cute for a while, the furry little devils keeping them entertained when they weren’t out on missions or meetings. But then there were days when both the kittens and Tony were in a mood specifically engineered to prevent Steve from closing his eyes.
“I’ve been thinking,” Tony began, gesturing at both of them, “We’re obviously trained and we gel well with both Ant-Man and Wasp. The fight today might have taken longer and gotten messier if we hadn’t helped out. Well, you helped out and I did most of the important work. Still, the point is, we’re capable of being more than just helpers to the existing heroes.”
"It won't fit you," Tony said patiently, eyeing the suit and then shifting his gaze to Steve's torso, "We are not going to be in a role-play stripper scenario here, alright?"
He was planning on any alternate strategy they could use when his steps skittered to a halt at the sight that greeted him.
"My invitation must have been late," Steve answered through grit teeth as his scans flickered on the screen.
It was a fragile peace that had been earned and built with painful care. Steve respected that. He was simply lost himself, in footing and misplaced feelings.
A decade ago it had been Bruce. Now it was Thor. But it was still them and it was still going to be okay.
“Christine Everhart had a lot of opinions on your last words being the ones from your big press conference,” Steve scuffed his shoe against the ground with a faint smile before looking up at Tony, “Hope had some colourful words when she kept trying to get Scott to comment on things.”
They were at the end of the month when Steve came home in the evening and Tony was already there, sitting on the living room couch staring at the coffee table. There was an air of shock about him and Steve looked at the surroundings for a second, trying to see anything out of ordinary, before slowly making his way to the stunned man.
“Is it okay? My back is killing me,” an incredibly older version of Scott cracked his back and Steve hovered around Bruce, backing off when he was asked to.
“I’m literally from Carefree,” Sam snorted and whooped when they took off, Bernie’s car starting right after them, “And you stopped fooling me with that Captain America act a long time ago, old man!”
Steve caught the ID badge thrown at him and read the MIT credentials on it before looking up to see Tony come back out.
“I think we might find something,” he said, a plan forming in his head and Tony fell into step as they raced against time.
It was probably worth mentioning that they were currently fending off attacks from the Hydra soldiers they had unearthed from the latest bunker raided and Tony was trying to get the Avenjet to work after they had taken a hit.
“Are you proposing? Because honey, I’ve got news for you about what fiancé is defined as,” Tony said and looked wary for a moment, “Unless you didn’t think that we were engaged and I’ve been misunderstanding your ‘yes’ from the last proposal -”
“Hey Cap…Steve.  If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media.  It’s gonna be a real tear-jerker.  I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these.  I don’t even know if you’re…” he stuttered into silence, sucking in a breath to pull himself together.  “After Peter, I don’t think I could handle losing anyone else.  Even though I already lost you.” He glanced out the window beside him.  “Today is day 21, uh, 22.
But then Tony had arrived at the Tower, and brought with him an immediate surge of relief and rightness. Something powerful enough to make itself known even over the top of Steve’s emotional breakdown-
. Which seemed a strange reaction, now that he thought of it… But that’s definitely what it was. The fact that Tony had thought to have a video ready, that he’d given as much thought to explanation as he had the procedure. It all seemed part of a very…
Tony almost smiled at himself then, an amused sort of embarrassment at catching himself out. Recognising only too well that he’d spent the whole week fighting a permanent temptation to call Steve – and that, whatever he tried to tell himself in the moment, it was never actually because he had an important question, or a notable breakthrough, or… whatever excuses he’d invented.
For a moment, he simply let his eyes run over the chaos of information, waiting for one issue to make itself known as the priority right now.
” Tony clarified, slowly. “Cos, like I say – just having this idea out loud right now, in real time… But… Yeah, I’m pretty sure I
Then he fell quiet for a few moments, while he removed one of the panels from Bucky’s shoulder, and began untangling the chaos of wires beneath. There was the tricky task of replacing some of them, and then the even more delicate task of wiring the tiny little circuit board into the system. But even while Tony was so focused on what he was doing, he was still aware of Steve standing behind him… being sad…
of Steve, that wonderful sense of satisfaction that had washed over Tony as he watched Steve snuggle softly into sleep… Was that because Tony loved him?
“They’re just a general space where people can relax, and enjoy themselves” She carried on, her voice polite and entirely unaffected. And it wasn’t so much that Tony was lost for words – there were an awful lot of very strong words in his head right now, actually. But he wasn’t allowed to say any of them, because he was
Steve glanced up, not sure if he was relieved of the distraction or if he just resented having to stand up again so soon.
“You think that’s all it is?” Steve snapped the conversation firmly back to the specific mission “You think they
...And Steve just let himself be kissed - moaning against Tony’s lips in a frenzied, animalistic way that Tony had never heard from him before.
in the process of organising his arguments – that some unnamed SHIELD agent wasn’t good enough cover. That Nick was basically asking Tony to act as protection for someone else-
And back then, Tony was so worried that one of them would work out that he was a vampire –  because then his secret might get out, and then there would be all
. “...And this is the level of conversion and efficiency you’d expect, and it all seems to be accounted for…”
“C’mon” He whispered, when Belle left them again. “Time for bed.” And this time, Steve didn’t argue. He just nodded his head, and rubbed his eyes, and took a few seconds too long finding his feet on the soft floor. Tony put a hand out to steady him, and Steve caught his eye, blushing hard enough that Tony could see it even in
Wondering if he’d come off as aggressive or immature or rude, trying to guess what Tony thought of him.
Steve woke up - or, really, ‘regained consciousness’ - a few hours later, feeling slightly disoriented and thirsty… and sticky… Blinking against the artificial light in the room, he finally recognised that he wasn’t in his own bed... That he didn’t know this place...
Tony felt an inch of relief, even though he had no idea what it was for. Just the vague memory that they’d been worried about that, and the general feeling that it had been assuaged…
“No,” she reassured him, daring to take a little step closer. “No, the allies won, largely thanks to you-”

With a sharp intake of breath he turned away from the chaos in his workshop, shutting the lights down with a wave of his hand as he strode wearily to the elevator
“Well, you’re just going to have to trust us, he’s not a nice guy, and he has an interest in this place – one that probably doesn’t require keeping any of the people in it alive.” Steve short-handed, pretending to be impatient but professional.
It was the first opportunity that Tony had really had to think about how hard it would’ve been to live with that secret. How lost and confused Steve must’ve been, with no one to turn to for help. How scared he was of anyone finding out, of letting people down…
The front door opened for him as soon as he reached it, which startled him somewhat – although in a very nice way. He stepped into the hallway and breathed in the now familiar smell of Tony’s house-
Everything he knew about his younger self told him that he would have been insecure and defensive in this situation - that he’d have seen Tony as rude, or arrogant, or thoughtless, for saying that…
so much more of the world, now that he was with Steve. There were so many little joys in life that he’d simply not seen, back when he was so unhappy. So many privileges that he’d taken for granted, until he thought of sharing them with Steve…
knowing it… That he’d feel so sick at the idea of Steve thinking of him that way, that it would hurt his feelings so much to think of Steve recoiling from him…
“Thank you, JARVIS,” he replied, with a little too much feeling, and all but ran over to bury his face in one of the monitors.
He would have, if he hadn’t been watching Steve bravely fight all his own needs - if Tony hadn’t been so keenly aware of everything Steve wanted, everything he was feeling…
He kept his grip hard against Steve’s skin, holding him basically still as he ran the flat of his tongue over him again, slower and firmer this time, letting the tip of his tongue flit over Steve’s rim before he pulled back.
“I don’t know – that’s one of the things that just starts coming up, after a while. I can’t find an explanation for it, either.” Tony shrugged. “That, and Genesis Day, which I can’t tell if that refers to an actual day, or a drug, or what…”
he’d done it. He couldn’t imagine what on earth would possess him to do something like that, where it even come from. Why, of

it, right at the core of him… And that one might have simply been a reaction to hearing something so sweet from the man he loved.
“I know that,” Steve sighed. “Or, at least, I did think about that, before I even came here… And I know that the man I left in 2023
himself to live by reason, take all those painful but necessary precautions. He could think about how to condense Bucky’s treatments into fewer appointments, make sure not to engage in personal conversations… Just tell Steve not to come with him, next time. All of which was just unbearable, obviously.
Steve could so clearly picture him undressing. The way he dragged his tie free of his collar, the crisp white of his shirt against flawless tanned skin as he unfastened the buttons… There was a constant, compulsive urge to turn and look, to reach out for him, to call out – a repeated, grinding satisfaction at overcoming it.
lived in an internet enabled future for nearly ten years now, and he’d been in the army before that – there wasn’t much going on here that he hadn’t seen before, and certainly nothing he hadn’t heard of. And it wasn’t that he was disgusted or offended or shocked by any of it…
He was suddenly aware of the trance he’d slipped into. The fact that he’d not bothered to scan all of his words before he said them, that he’d not been
the thing I really regret. That I always regretted, even at the time. I hate that I hurt you, and I’d do anything to take it back. But it wasn’t that I didn’t care about hurting you – it wasn’t that I didn’t like you, or that I didn’t trust you, or that I thought anything was more important than you…” another step forward, so that he was standing just a few feet away from him. “It’s just that I was still hoping I wouldn’t have to choose, that I could make it so that
that’s the weird part, but that’s the part that doesn’t bother me. That part feels perfectly natural. What
at the time? Had he been doing that this whole time? Overlooking the things that Nat had done, demanding others do the same, simply because those things hadn’t been present to him?
On which note - yes, there is smut. One and a half whole scenes of smut - and for anyone a little disappointed that the second scene fades to black, this is only because a) story flow means some of the details end up in the next chapter and b) they get to explore these ideas in a similar and more graphic scene later on. 😏
Steve went to push himself up, but it was like his arms just weren’t there, like he fell through them
of that was shit. Usually, those thoughts ground through his head, heavy and weary and somehow still impossible to quiet. Hours lost in thoughts about how to limit the damage, how to make the most of the ruins, how to move past the pain.
Steve didn’t really have the words for it. There was just this flood of emotions, when he remembered Tony sobbing. Steve’s heart swelled; his arms tensed in an physical need to hold Tony close to him… Steve
At least, it had since he woke up all alone in an alien future. A place where the words all sounded the same but meant something completely different, where society had shifted in such huge, multifaceted strokes that it couldn’t be comprehended or quantified or explained – you just had to be there.
And then he heard Tony’s footsteps behind him. He felt the warmth in the air, as Tony stepped closer-
Of course, it couldn’t last. No sooner had Tony caught his breath than the frantic jumble of thoughts started up again, drawing all the tension back into his shoulders-
His whole body was still tingling with the memory of Steve’s kisses. His head was still full of Steve’s sweet, kind words. He was completely lost in this wonderful, beautiful moment, and so desperate to stay here-
He wanted to tell Bucky his story – or, at least, that still seemed like the obvious thing to do. To share his experience, to talk about the feelings they had in common, to pass on some of the things he’d learned… That
He decided he would just get up, and have a shower… and then he might as well try to get some sleep, before they got here. The very least he could do was to be well rested and cognitively aware when he performed surgery tonight…
have already known it, at least… But he couldn’t help being just a little bit saddened by it, just for a moment.
It mattered that it was the opposite of everything that had ever made Steve uncomfortable with this idea.
to stop this revelation from unfolding, whatever it was… The anticipation of it, the intensity of it, felt every bit as real and vital and driven as the physical need clawing under his skin.
Steve had spent his entire life searching for a love like that. Someone who would be his last thought before he died-
He could interpret Clint so differently, depending on whether he was thinking of the Clint who had so bravely joined the Battle of New York moments after being brainwashed, or the Clint who’d sided with Steve in the worst decision he’d ever made, or the Clint he’d argued with at that final BBQ… And, when he wasn’t thinking of any of those things - when he was trying to decide how he felt about the man simply standing in front of him…. Steve wasn’t sure he could tell.
“Ladies and gentlemen!” A familiar voice boomed from the back of the room. Steve looked up to see Scaramouche - who, from this distance, seemed to be covered from head-to-toe in gold glitter - addressing the guests. “We hope you have all enjoyed your meal this evening. When you are ready, we would like to invite you to join us in the Grand Hall for this evening’s
“He’s my personal numerologist, Tony mocked back, immediately and without joy. Steve barely heard the words, and certainly wasn’t going to waste time analysing them - already his attention was focused on reading this guy, in a more detailed and determined way than he’d ever managed on the battlefield.
pretending that he wasn’t in love with Tony, if he then started saying that Tony was right to blame Bucky or that he agreed Tony about The Accords… wasn’t he then just apologising for lying to Tony by telling Tony a whole bunch of lies?
Someone he felt a part of. Not just someone that he’d be scared to lose, but someone he’d be scared to leave behind. Someone he wanted to save
Steve let his eyes fall on Bucky’s arm, staring somewhere far beyond it, getting lost in the middle distance. He let Tony fade into his peripheral vision, and then he let his vision fade away from his attention altogether. He fell into the silence he was forcing into his own head, concentrating too hard on
want to excuse his mistakes with his intentions… because he’d never been able to explain why he thought it mattered… Because he’d been raised in an era of stoic Generals and Politicians and Founding Members saying,
note that it had probably been a bad idea. But it was just a thought, without any real weight. There was no sinking feeling, no hot rush of fear up his spine. Just the oddly detached observation that he probably shouldn’t have done that…
“We’d like to know if you’ve had any contact with Steve Rogers in the last twenty-four hours,” Coulson told him in a sober tone-
Tony scowled at him, instantly unimpressed with that answer. But before he could force the issue, Nat cut in,
have come up with a moment as perfect as this, he wouldn’t have had the front to hope for it. Steve had only ever allowed himself a bargained down, compromised version of this, even in his fantasies. Always assuming he’d have to make do with so much less than this…
… Like a mesmerising, beautiful flame – Tony knew he should run from this. He knew it would hurt if he touched it. But it was just so warm, and pretty, and… Tony just
“You were amazing tonight,” Steve whispered, waiting until Tony looked up at him to take his hand. “You were so brave, and so strong, and so

“Sugar?” Pepper asked, pointedly, and at volume. Tony looked up at her, finding it was difficult to focus.
Steve immediately blacked out, for a fraction of a second. His legs went from under him. The crack of the floor hitting his knees jolted him awake, but it took a few seconds longer for the room to stop spinning, and for his vision to clear-
But then he’d found himself on an unknown planet, under the influence of drugs that he hadn’t chosen to take, under entirely alien circumstances… It had just sort of

base is guarded by several super soldiers,” Steve blurted - knowing it was an excuse, even as he said it.
Now that he was actually putting some effort in to being the other half of an equal friendship with both of them…
“Really, you cared about Tony, did you?” Steve demanded - before he’d even bothered to think if that was true. Thor seemed to recognise that there was no point starting that argument, and with only the slightest flicker of hesitation, gestured to Rhodey.
And then the compound appeared in front of them, like a wonderful mirage – and suddenly all Tony could think of was his own bed in his own home on his own planet.
“Thank you so much.” And then he glanced at the bottle, which contained easily two litres of dark, amber liquid… “What’s this?”
sorry for what happened in the bunker,” he said, very stoically. He might even have been using the ‘Captain America’ voice.
“Jesus fuck Steve, oh my God…” Tony panted, the aftershocks still shuddering through him. He could feel Steve’s mouth, still moving against him, swallowing – and Jesus, the thought of that-
“They make you wear the uniform to talk to the press?” Tony asked – making a mental note to download all of the Avengers past media conferences as soon as Steve and Bucky left.
back to work on that - a project he was quite motivated to do without your input, and quite capable of doing without your threats, if you’d just
It was only that the pain of waiting proved to be so much worse. It was the anxiety of what was about to happen that pushed Steve onto his feet,
“...But the plants have been used by hundreds of thousands of people with human DNA, so I can at least assure you that, in physiological terms, these plants are far safer than many things you consume on a daily basis,” she finished cheerily. “They’re nowhere near as harmful as caffeine, for example.”
And then he felt the warmth of Bucky’s palm against his arm - not forceful, or aggressive. Just there.
“In my defence,” Tony sighed, strolling past him, “it’s really hard to put off a room full of shareholders, when the real answer is ‘Captain America is alive, but don’t tell anybody.’”
But when he thought of Asgard, the emotional weight felt distant to him… Simpler. More familiar. Steve found that he could still think of a great historical tragedy with the same hypothetical sadness that he always had.
, after nearly a week, Tony felt as strong and as satisfied as he’d ever felt on any other blood. Better than he used to feel in the moments right after feeding. He hadn’t even felt that nagging little craving, much less the physical weakness and shortness of breath that should’ve overwhelmed him by now. Both reason and experience told him that he only drank blood when he had to – that he only drank blood
The sting and shock of it jarred him out of his thoughts. A sharp hiss broke out of his chest as he put the frame down on the counter, thinking he’d immediately look at the cut-
“Do you know who you’re arresting and who you’re interviewing and who you’re letting someone else arrest… or… whatever?”
“I can trigger an evacuation-” Maribelle offered, her voice high and tight. But Steve cut her off with a wave of his hand.
being noticed and indulged and taken care of. That was all very new. It went against a lot of fundamental instincts and life-long teaching…
didn’t die either,” Steve explained… finding that brought him back to a more appropriate mood pretty quickly. “I don’t know how much you know about it, but he’d been captured by Hydra once before that, and they experimented on him. They gave him a version of the serum, which is what helped him to survive that fall - and then Hydra found him again. No one knew it, but they’d taken him to a lab and continued their experiments… and they found a way to control him. A literal mind control technique that basically turned him into a puppet for them…”
It was probably a bad thing. A confusing, complicated thing that could only lead to disappointment, or worse…
The fear began to prickle up through the numbness. The details of the alien landscape came into sharper focus as the adrenaline soaked into his system. He became much more aware of his breathing, moving higher in his chest, pulling his lungs tight as he scrambled to think of everything that had happened so far
And Steve saw the deep breath Tony took before he made his next point - however casual he tried to make it sound.

big on the drug thing here, that’s definitely something…” Tony went on, his eyes falling shut. “I didn’t see any, like, office, or anything… but I didn’t go back over the whole place… I guess maybe back where reception was, or something…” His voice grew heavier, until it trailed off completely. Steve finally realised that Tony was falling asleep.
” Steve whispered, giving in and thrusting into him again – another wave of pleasure rolling through Tony, hot and slow now, “You’re
Steve found himself blinking at it, his mind still scrabbling to make sense of this impossibility even as he assured himself it was real… It was even stranger, seeing it in a confined little space like this. Like an optical illusion brought to life.
He almost laughed. He hadn’t realised that he’d simply expected some sort of comedy screen wipe - that, even though his mood wouldn’t allow him to
This had always been the first place that came to mind when he thought about this task, the only part of the trip that he’d bothered to picture in advance…
And, before Steve woke up, Tony had been considering a whole range of possibilities. Steve was a very different person to him, after all. Maybe he would feel entirely different to how Tony would feel… It wouldn’t be the first time they’d had completely different reactions to the same thing.  So, Tony
Bucky looked up at the window, and the watery light that was streaming through the half-closed drapes, and frowned thoughtfully… and then gave a nod of assent.
He’d try to deny that later. He’d reword it and downplay it and try to bury it with other, more acceptable reasoning… But the fact was, in the moment, Steve’s first instinct was not to think about it-
And, really, it was only that Steve recognised them as his own words. That was the anchor, between what Tony had said and any sort of cognitive activity…
to run and tell Steve… But it didn’t feel that way. Something about this felt… important. Ominous. Tragic, even.
“Right, so I should probably better explain the specific experience – yes, this is an opportunity for
…” Tony knew that wasn’t loud enough for Steve to have heard it. That there was no way he was going to be able to explain-
something more. And if we’re going to be together, this is going to be a part of it,” he sighed, his tone getting more serious as he spoke. “And what I want is to be bonded to you. To drink from you, and only you, and share that possibly supernatural connection that comes with it… But I have to know that you really know what that means, and that it’s what you really want.”
It rolled over Tony like an invisible wave, washing away his previous mindset and consuming him in something else completely-
“You can still help people,” Steve tried to keep his voice level, as he inched ever closer. “Believe me, whatever trouble you think you’re in right now, it’s nothing compared to what half the Avengers have come from-”
Tony turns his attention to the screen. “Tonight’s red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where the Stanes’ third annual benefit for the Firefighter’s Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.’s high society,” the TV announcer says.
Tony barely notices as he reaches the end of the aisle and faces Obie. The officiate drones on and on, and Tony only pays enough attention to know when to say his part. After they exchange rings and say “I do,” the officiate declares them man and Omega and Obadiah lifts Tony’s veil to give Tony a chaste kiss. The bonding bite would come later in private.
Tony thinks about his unborn child. These are his unborn child’s people. They could have family here. This town is a part of their roots, and the Ten Rings are completely tearing it apart.
“I know, baby. But you’ve pushed deadlines for everything you had been working on before, and we already had a three-month stasis with you gone.”
“A vodka martini, you know how I like it. And I shouldn’t have to remind you to keep your condition in mind.”
Yahya grabs a blanket from one of the cots, and Tony guides them to the blindspot. They lay the blanket on the ground and sit. It’s more awkward than Tony’s wedding night.
“After all these years, Stane still has you picking up the dry cleaning.” Of course, Everhart would take
“Is it true you and your husband went 12 for 12 with last year’s Maxim cover models?” The soldier asks eagerly.
“He has my arc reactor. The newer one. And he has a suit like mine, but worse. The agents won’t be enough. I have to stop him.”
Tony turns to leave when the Beta woman stops him. “From Stane,” Everhart says, probably trying to sound sultry, “Won’t you join us?”
Tony hesitates. He could lie right now. Just tell Yinsen about Zeke. But he found that he couldn’t bring himself to lie the way he has the last decade. And Tony trusts the Alpha. Yinsen has been the only solace in this godforsaken place. He wanted to tell the Alpha.
Zeke is quiet, understanding why his father shows so much more love this unborn child than he ever has to Zeke or Peter. Peter is too young to understand, but not too young to notice.
Jarvis then brings out a chocolate cake with bright sparklers on top of it and no one speaks of it again.
Tony lets out a sharp, humorless laugh. “Well, if you haven’t realized yet Ms. Everhart, Obie’s and my reputation is simply
Tony doesn’t notice it at first. He attributes the fatigue and dizziness to the lack of nourishment provided in captivity in a cave. He barely registers the beginning sensations of heat spreading through his body as a result of the blazing heat of Afghanistan during the day. Then a bout of dizziness has him stumbling into Yahya’s arms.
Tony couldn’t let this happen. Not only was Yahya the father of his possible unborn child, but also someone Tony’s come to care for deeply in a short amount of time.
Obie’s face breaks out into a grin. Tony can’t tell if it’s false or not. “This is great news, babe. Maybe you’ll give me another Alpha son yet.” Tony was not expecting the Alpha to kiss him soundly. When Obie finally pulls away, he continues, “I know you just gave me amazing news and I wish we could celebrate alone together, but I really do have to go back tonight.”
Obie decides to keep the pregnancy from the press. Obie tells Tony it’s because when Tony is the leading developer for SI, stock prices will drop knowing that Tony is a mother. Obie tells Howard it’s that they don’t want their child growing up being bombarded by the press.
“Hey,” Tony screams out, “Hey!” The helicopter lands a couple of dozen meters in front of him. He falls onto his knees at the weight of his relief, his hand reached out toward the sky.
In this moment, as Tony looks between his defiant children, it dawns on Tony that the loyalty he has for Obie due to his children far exceeded the loyalty his children had to their father. He did not know why he continued to make excuses for the Alpha, probably from years and years of abuse and conditioning, but this was where it stopped. The only things that link Tony to that man are his children, who have no desire to be linked to the Alpha.
5J groans. “I’m pretty sure it was first because one of his French magazine subscriptions got put in my mailbox by mistake and then I tossed it by accident, so he took something of mine out of spite. Then he realized that he could sell the things I get for a pretty penny. I’m an engineering student, working on a PhD, so I get some expensive materials shipped to me."
“Tony Stane hasn’t been seen in public since his brief press conference right after coming back stateside. Some claim he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks,” the announcer continues, “Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.”
“There’s a lot of work for this program, Mom. I really love it, but I just want to be on top of it.” He pauses. “Remember that first night you tucked me and read me
No matter all the awful things Obie has done to Tony this past decade, Tony still does not want to kill Obie. He is still Tony’s Alpha. He still gave Tony four beautiful children. But this is what has to be done.
“I’m here, I’m here,” Tony soothes, running his hands through the hair and along the back and limbs of his children, trying to make the scents of despair and sadness wafting off his children go away. It just makes them hang on even tighter. He presses a hard kiss atop each boy’s head.
Peter and Harley both nod seriously and simultaneously chime, “Of course, Momma.” After kissing Tony goodbye, the boys turn away and walk into the building. Tony doesn’t leave until after he watches them disappear through the double doors.
“What’s up, Tony? I thought you were going to go into blackout mode to work on an SI project.” Steve recognized the voice as The Wasp. Janet Van Dyne.
Tony thinks for a moment. “I can get you that body armor I was working on before by the end of next week.” It was a military project so it would appeal to the board, but it was non-combative so that Tony wouldn’t have to make weapons again.
“Yes, and I will see them when I leave here.” Yinsen looks up from the board and at Tony. “And you, Stane?”
The next morning, Tony is sitting on the couch, making faces at his baby to make the little one giggle when Everhart stumbles out in nothing but her undergarments and Obie’s shirt from the night before. Thank God it’s early enough that the kids have yet to wake up and Zeke was at boarding school in Pasadena. It’s bad enough that Zeke knows and understands his father’s indiscretions, but he hasn’t even had the Talk with Peter yet.
The ice had already crusted its way around the entirety of Obie’s suit. Tony watched as the power blinked out of the eye slits of Obie’s suit. “Might want to look into it,” the Omega quips as he punches the suit down, watching as it falls through the air. Though, Tony can’t watch long.
“Jeez, Momma,” Peter sighs exasperated, “Yes, I slept through the night. No, I haven’t thrown up since yesterday afternoon. I’m okay now; I wanna go back to school today.” Harley, who’s sitting next to Peter on the couch, nods enthusiastically in support of his brother.
For a moment, there was nothing but silence coming from the other line. Steve waited. “How do you have Tony’s phone? What have you done to him?” Van Dyne screeched.
“I don’t have to do anything,” Tony responds haughtily, “There are 3 things I want. I want an American cheeseburger, for one.”
They continue to waterboard him until he passes out. Then, they wake him up and start the process again.
If it was just that, perhaps Steve could’ve probably tolerated the man. Steve can understand being patriotic when you’re far from home and he himself agrees with a few (a
“I was covered in two tons of titanium-gold alloy. And after the first crash, I updated JARVIS to be able to scan me for the baby’s heartbeat or any sign of miscarriage. I was and am fine and so is baby. I wouldn’t do anything to put them in harm’s way.”
Tony clears his throat, not expecting the emotional turn the conversation has taken. “I’m bored of dancing. I need something to drink. Want something from the bar?”
They sit in comfortable silence, an ease that Tony has built with Yahya in weeks that he hasn’t been able to build with his own Alpha in ten years.
“I’ve seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.”
“I’m going to honest Zeke and tell you that the baby is going to take a lot of my time. Babies require a lot of care because they’re so small and can’t do anything by themselves. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to care for you less. And just because I’m not your bearer does not mean that I am going to love this baby more than you. Blood or no blood, Zeke, you are
“What I did is to save your life,” the Alpha gives Tony a wry smile, “I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there’s a lot left, and it’s headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? I have a souvenir. Take a look.” The Alpha tosses a tiny glass container to Tony. It has small metal fragments. Shrapnel.
Yahya pulls out of Tony and cleans the two of them off with a wet rag. They quickly put their clothes back on and make a show of working for the cameras, or at least as much as Tony is able to, as the Heat leaves him more fatigued than usual.
Harley pouts but doesn’t complain further. Tony hugs each of his children goodbye and smothers Jamie’s face with kisses, the only one of the four that still allows that kind of treatment.
Tony comes first with a shout, splattering all over his and Yahya’s chests. A few moments later the Alpha’s knot locks the two together as he releases into Tony. Yahya and Tony fall back onto the blanket and are left breathless. The heat of the moment dissipates, and Tony starts to feel embarrassed again, his cheeks heating up.
The Alpha breaks the silence, “I'm sure they're looking for you, Stane. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stane. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stane? Or are you going to do something about it?”
playing on the radio, the ride is silent. “I feel like you’re driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do?” Tony rambles, “I feel like you’re going to pull over and snd snuff me. What, you’re not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!”
That’s when the doctor decides to walk in. Tony scrambles to cover up the arc reactor with Rhodey stepping in front of the Omega to help him do so.
Everyone has bonding glands by which biting it (usually during sex) creates a bond. These bonding bites fade over time. In order to create long-lasting bonds, bonding bites need to be refreshed. This is traditionally during Heat for Omegas and Rut for Alphas, but can be done whenever, as done by Betas. Bonding glands are located on the junction between the neck and shoulder for Alphas, on the junction between the underside of the chin and neck for Betas, and on the back of the neck near the upper back for Omegas. Touching a bonding gland without permission is paramount to sexual assault, but like in real life, people get away with it a lot with Omegas, and Alphas tend not to even report it due to societal pressures. Due to the placement of glands in Betas, they are the most likely to have their case prosecuted.
“One vodka martini, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast and one of those mocktails I had earlier, it was really good.”
Pepper’s look of frustration is instantly transformed into one of mischievous elation. “I think it’s a fair example. I think it’s incredibly overpriced.”
“It’s an arc reactor,” Tony answers, “It’s keeping me alive. A Stark missile blew a hole into my chest. It’s keeping shrapnel from reaching my heart.”
Tony decides to make some of the boys’ favorites for dinner as a treat. He feels a bit guilty about locking them out of the workshop the last two months. He’s had to spend as much time as possible there when Obie isn’t around to get any work done on Mark II. And while he’s made sure to spend plenty of time with them outside of his work on the project, the Omega needs to make sure that they don’t feel neglected. So he starts a baked chicken Alfredo pasta for Zeke, dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets for Peter and Harley, oven-baked chicken that he would cut up into small pieces for Jamie, and roasted vegetables that he would make sure they all ate.
Rhodey visibly calms down and just looks at Tony knowingly for a moment. “You loved this man.” It’s not a question.
Tony smiles. “Get your godkids. I want them here when I come home. Love you, man.” The faceplate latches into place. “Oh, and keep the kids clear.”
Then, Zeke turns his attention to the small flat screen television they had in the dining room that currently served as background noise. “Mom, shouldn’t you be at that?” The teenage Beta asks.
This is it. He has tried so hard to cling to life for his unborn child, for his family, for Yahya, for himself. But in the end, his efforts were useless. He was going to die anyway.
When he swoops into Gulmira, one of the members of the Ten Rings immediately starts firing on him, but the bullets barely scratch his titanium-gold exterior. He sends the guy a repulsor blast. He turns every which way to blast the Ten Rings members shooting at him into unconsciousness.
“Tony,” Steve whispered, not really wanting to wake his lover up but knowing he had no other choice, “Tony, you have to let me up. I have to go.”
Tony has a problem. While the Omega had done the best that he could with what he had in the cave, it is obvious that his current arc reactor would not be able to hold up much longer. So obviously, Tony makes a new one with the best materials in his state-of-the-art workshop.
“Well, Ms. Brown, it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.”
“Well, yes, but I also want you to start looking into people and weapons orders and shipments in SI.”
Tony makes his way down to the kitchen and fills up a bowl with lukewarm water. That’s when he gets a call from an unknown number, which he would usually ignore, never taking calls that weren’t on his contact list, but in this instance, he was distracted.
“I’m in Heat,” Tony gasps in realization, “It must at least be the beginning of April, then. But it’s probably later as I would’ve definitely had a delay because of all this.”
“You never drive with the top down with the kids. You’re telling me you left your kids alone on a Saturday morning.”
is the reason why Tony agrees. So Tony wears tailored clothes that hide his bump until the bump grows so big that there’s no way to hide it and Tony instead avoids being out in public.
Tony walks over to another work station, and Yinsen follows. He shuffles thin pieces of paper with schematics on them one on top of the other over the flat light source on the table. “This our ticket out of here.”
That is why Steve secretly takes immense pleasure in the currents events. Mr. Bassett seems to be stuck,
After receiving enthusiastic responses, Tony bids adieu to his closest friends and takes his children up to his bedroom. He hands Jamie over to Zeke while he changes into comfortable clothes to sleep in. Tony is then the first to get on the bed, though his kids followed quickly after.
Tony runs away from the fires and the sounds of guns being fired. He throws himself behind a rock, hoping it will give him some semblance of cover. He pulls out his phone and starts dialing.
He wondered what Tony’s fellow Avengers would think of their relationship, wondered if any of them already knew. (He doubted it.) They would likely be shocked, possibly even angry. It would be unlikely that they would understand. Steve didn’t understand. (And maybe Tony didn’t either). Steve already knew what his superiors would think of the relationship and what they would do because of it, which is why he had to make sure they never found out. (If they found out Steve would get
“Good Luck,” he whispered, when he’d finished double checking the coordinates. “Just, do me a favour…
He didn’t really think much about why he was getting dressed, or where he was going. He just sort of… followed his feet, simply letting this excess energy propel him forward-
. That idea that kept moving, just out of the corner of his eye. That eerie feeling, like maybe he remembered this moment from a dream…
“Do you know if they’re doing all of this from here?” Tony asked, already listing the details he needed to do this equation.
“I can barely read, right now” Steve commented, and Tony giggled – and then shot him a warning look that just made Steve want to smile more.
the details came pouring in - scraps he’d learned from the Operation Rebirth file, observations he’d made for himself, things he’d thought of earlier that day… All things that helped make sense of this feeling after the fact.
“…It just felt like, all this time I’d been thinking that we were… Something, at least. And then something important happens, and suddenly I’m just some guy you know. Someone you obviously didn’t want to hurt, because you don’t want to hurt anyone… but when someone you really loved was in trouble, it was going to be you and your
Which wasn’t now. That little pang of shame was quickly overwhelmed by all of his previous anxieties, which were now moving even faster and louder and more frantically, after that brief reprieve-
“Then you would have just had a couple of interesting, funny conversations, right?” Rhodey pointed out.
“Hi, sorry, I know it’s a stupid time in the morning,” Bucky started, apologetically. “But, you said to call immediately if I felt any pain in the arm…?”
But Tony just held his palm firm against Steve’s skin, and whispered over and over that it was okay, as Steve struggled to get his faculties under some sort of control.
Steve moaned into it, simply letting Tony force his mouth open wider, melting into a total surrender to it. The taste of Tony flooded over his tongue, the dull ache pushing ever lower into his hips as he rocked up against Tony’s thighs. He could feel the heat of Tony’s chest, right there, maybe an inch away from being pressed against him.
“Well, I’d actually thought about that before. I mean, I assumed I’d be a great candidate for that - you know, I can lose up to three litres of blood before I even have to worry? And make it back twice as fast as anyone else,” Steve was speaking too quickly, like he was worried he was running out of time… “And, you’d
He wanted to have something to say, when Tony asked what this meant for the future - even if it was ‘I read everything there is, and there’s nothing like that in there.’
And they had arrived at the party just after seven thirty – just to be on the safe side, you understand.
“What sort of rash?” Gary demanded, tilting his head back - thinking nothing of it when Steve moved up close to him-
ends” Steve suggested “To get rid of the humans… But the humans here have something to do with this, right?”
But, as frightening and painful as this moment was… it wasn’t in that league. It was a different thing entirely. Tony might’ve felt tense and nauseous, but he could at least process these responses from his body. These thoughts might be horrible and unstructured, but they weren’t running away from him or dissolving entirely to mush.
She said the last word with such hurt. Such anger. Tony glanced up at Steve then, and saw the same uncomfortable fear he felt himself. The awkwardness of earlier had completely dissolved in the seriousness of what Zan was saying – but it was hard to be pleased about that, under the circumstances.
“I think…” Galileo suggested timidly, from the edge of the group, “it might be a good idea if our guests were shown to their suites. Give them a chance to settle into the atmosphere, digest everything they’ve learned, before dinner tonight?”
For one white hot second, Tony was so flooded by pure, physical rage that it was literally all he was. There was such a raw, spiteful urge to
“Can I fuck you? Here, like this?” He whispered, his voice low and breathless. He’d barely finished the question before Tony answered him,
The feeling of release was dizzying, flooding straight to his head. The world exploded into white, and for a fraction of a second Steve thought he might actually pass out-
found out about Hydra and Bucky and my parents, not you. If it’d been me and Nat in that bunker, and
just illegal because of religious fundamentalism… and the punishment here is being thrown in acid, or something? Do we still hand them over?”
It felt like those nights during the war, when he’d catch someone’s eye from across a room and feel a spike of interest.
That tiny little crack in Tony’s breathing had been enough to shatter the last of Steve’s resolve. Whatever reassurance Rhodey had been right in the middle of making just disappeared from Steve’s head, his attention suddenly focused
occur to him that this would’ve been a beautiful setting to make a memory in. That this would have been a wonderful night for something to happen…
“Well, that’s the thing - I already know that there’s no place on earth it would be safe to keep them locked up,” Steve confessed. “
Tony spent a few minutes watching the numbers, running mental calculations and thinking back to his hypothesis… and then the little surge of satisfaction, as he felt it all fall into place. The equations balancing out, the patterns all locking together – he loved that feeling.
And then Tony began sliding Steve’s hand over the length of him, slowly, letting Steve feel how thick and hard and warm he was…
him to this point. That was all just there to set up the person he was going to be, in this time line.
. It had taken him so long to figure out the language and the culture and the norms of the 21st Century, especially in the months before he even had any friends to talk to.
. In the right. Morally right. It must be hard to do that all the time, without falling back on rules as shortcuts. And, I imagine, you both face a unique emotional pressure, when it comes to questioning those rules.”
Captain America,” he shrugged, a playful look in his eye. “And I just thought - seeing as punching my way to you isn’t an option this time, maybe I’d just... plan it,” And then he took a step back, breaking their embrace so that he could take both of Tony’s hands in his, held close to his chest as he carried on, “I promise, no one is going to know I was here. There won’t be any surveillance footage, any record of me - I honestly think I put more thought into this than I did breaking out of the raft, just so that I could see you… Because I miss you. So much.”
There was a fine spray of water over his chest, as he held the cup under the stream. He watched, mindlessly, as the foam burst into a bright cerise, and then faded into a soft pastel pink… and then into nothing… He carried on like that until a memory piped up out of nowhere. The cheery voice of one of the many nurses he’d met in his first few days out of the ice,
Tony let a heavy palm fall onto Steve’s shoulder, and gently pressed his fingertips to the delicate hollow under Steve’s collarbone.
forgive Steve, he just did, he didn’t even have to move the line or let something go – God, that was wonderful.
The Accords, and I had all these thoughts, and questions, and better ideas…But, you know, I wasn’t sure about them, or it was hard to put into words. I could think of problems with all my ideas too, so I didn’t say them, didn’t think of offering them as a starting point… In fairness to you, it’s harder to listen to someone, if that someone finds it hard to say what they’re thinking anyway…”
“Please…” came out as a whisper. And then, when Tony looked up at him expectantly, Steve realised that he couldn’t find any words except the real ones, “please don’t leave me.”
And then Tony’s whole body was pressed to Steve’s back, the heat of his lips at the curve of Steve’s neck, and then the hint of his teeth…
Steve huffed a kind little laugh at that, and squeezed Tony’s shoulders – and Tony allowed himself a self-depreciating little smile before he continued,
Tony came, sudden and sharp and completely unexpectedly, his whole body trembling with the force of it-
“Well, yes, obviously.” Maribelle replied – a little bit of defensive outrage creeping in, even though she was clearly still frightened. “But I’m not going to write an entire race off on the basis of that, not when
Although, once Tony got over his initial shock – and the glowing awkwardness of Steve, a few feet behind him – he recognised that this place didn’t really host every conceivable sexual fantasy. What was shocking about this place was how casually sex was treated, the fact that it was everywhere… but the sex itself all seemed relatively mainstream.
probably think of it as an opportunity to plan. But the trouble was, the mission wasn’t at the top of his list of priorities. It should have been, but it wasn’t. His immediate concern was how the hell he was going to handle this thing with Steve, when he was forced to actually spend some time with him.
Steve swallowed again, hot and bitter and painful, and forced himself to take a slow breath. For a moment, he was glad neither of them was looking at him.
To be honest, if the fate of the world weren’t hanging in the balance - and if it wasn’t quite so difficult to find time to work on it - Tony would have been quite happy to spend the whole evening just staring at a wall.
And then his eyes happened to fall on one of the many boxes scattered around the workshop - and, like a rescue light in a storm, it occurred to him-
don’t, obviously…” Tony laughed. “And, actually, no one will be wearing that one – that’s an older version. But, yeah, I was sort of thinking about wearable tech that you – that the Avengers, could use…”
“No, we walked in and Stark gave me a strange look,” Steve corrected, tetchily. They’d discussed ‘the look’, several times, and Steve had already made it clear that he wasn’t counting that. Bucky just rolled his eyes again, and gave up on that line of conversation.
But, just under that, there was that practiced charm, the very particular choice of tone and expression and pace that made him seem sort of likeable anyway.
For a while, the whole thing was too performative to be of any real value. Steve knew he was only touring the halls to prove to himself that he could - taking his time simply to spite his urge to rush. He was so busy reminding himself that he was
Something vast and different and more than human, something that Steve didn’t have the words for yet… But he knew this feeling. He recognised it. He
you make a pitch for Bucky, when you’ve not spoken up for anyone else, in all this time?” He asked. And Pepper just absorbed the question, the same way she did at press conferences and board meetings and senate hearings….

“This planet is really called Anni-Vara – which all of the Adams can pronounce, quite easily, and yet they chose to give it a name of their own…” A sadness passed over her face, her eyes losing focus for a second as she remembered something she wasn’t going to share… and then she blinked, and carried on. “It wasn’t like this, before they came here. Anni-Vara has a unique eco-system, and the people here have been using it to make medicines for the body and soul for thousands of years. Generations trained to respect the things they made, and the elements they made them from – and the good they could do. People would travel from every planet in this system to heal here. It was a spiritual place. People would go to our woods and smoke our herbal mixes, and meditate. Sick people would come to bathe in the lakes, to be restored. And yes, couples would come here and take our serums and it would help them to connect, and talk, and feel – but not like this.” And she scrunched up her face, to show her distaste, before she carried on.
He sighed, and put his half empty coffee mug down on the counter, where he decided to leave it until he could be bothered to deal with it-
He knew he should be relieved at that. And, in fairness, there probably would have been a lot more guilt and panic to deal with, had Tony said something else… So, that made it a comfort of sorts, he supposed…
“Well, no one makes me…” Steve sighed, a hint of a blush colouring his cheeks. “I just… I don’t know, I don’t really like the idea of anyone asking what
Tony looked up to find Rhodey’s face looking down on him with calm concern. A familiar expression, a voice that felt like home…
good like this... “ Tony murmured, like he was talking to himself, shifting back so that he could unlace the belt around Steve’s waist. He slid his hand under the fabric, running his palms over Steve’s chest, letting the robe fall open in his wake. Steve did his best to meet Tony’s movements, trying to writhe free of his clothes - wanting to offer himself up.
And he wondered… If, when they’d sat down to discuss The Accords… or ULTRON, or life after the fall of SHIELD, or…
Which had been a tough mantra to stick to, because that was the only type of ‘love’ he was ever offered.
a difference between doing what you think you have to, and just doing whatever the hell you think you will. Your pure motivations do not automatically mean that everything you do will be right, or that
Which was probably the wrong answer. Tony knew he should probably push ahead with the project, try to avoid any lulls that could lead to actual thought or personal conversation-
So, as Steve didn’t have much else to say about that, he finished another glass, and set it aside. Then he cast a weary glance at the drink he was still holding, and decided to give it a moment. The sheer volume of liquid and the sugary taste were a bit much.
“Of course,” he beamed – his stomach clenching at the sound of Steve’s soft little gasp. “What time do you want to come over?”
“Er, yeah, day before yesterday” Tony breathed, smiling too enthusiastically… Belle didn’t seem to notice.
