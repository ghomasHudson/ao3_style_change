Sherlock settled further into the bed, wrapping arms around his son. “Breakfast: now or later?” he asked softly.
“You’re right,” Sherlock says quietly. John cannot look at him. He won’t. He doesn’t have the right to. He does not want to move from this spot, wants to stay rooted there forever.
Sherlock shakes his head, brushing his nose against John’s shirt. He mumbles something John doesn’t understand.
He knew that. Of course he knew that. He’d always known, or at the very least suspected it. Since Magnussen’s office. Didn’t mean hearing it felt any better.
They go slowly, Sherlock guiding with a firm hand at John’s shoulder as John steps into him. They get through the second round before they’re blocked behind Sherlock with furniture.
Because once they’re in the Drift, there is nothing between his mind and Harry’s—absolutely nothing.
Sherlock, however, seemed to only have gotten more graceful with age. Though his movements were lesser, they were more deliberate.
It is both exactly the same and entirely different, this Drift. John remembers all of the feelings, the rush of emotions with the memories and the physical rush of moving outside your own body. But the memories he was seeing in front of him, not all of them were familiar. His, Harry’s, and Sherlock’s.
He is acutely aware of the quietness of the room, and the closeness of his flatmate’s wiry body to his own, stocky frame.
He had a million, million things he wanted to say. Things he dreamed to whisper against Sherlock’s lips; things he ached to shout right in Sherlock’s stupid, insolent face; things that he knew could not be said without an upheaval of the wall he’d built around and inside his heart,  and would only break free in a flood of tears and desperation.
Sherlock gently squeezes John’s hand and they stop, John looking up at him. “Now what?” John breathes.
Being back in the suit of armor required to pilot a Jaeger is both familiar and foreign at the same time. Part of it is the new design, but part of it is at the back of his mind, John can’t stop thinking about that last time he was in a Jaeger, his sister died.
“How fitting it all is,” she says behind him. “Mary took a bullet in the same place she put one in you, but she wasn’t so lucky.” She follows Sherlock toward the front door, closer now. “And, now, I’ve put one in your precious John. How do you think he’ll fare?” She presses the muzzle of the gun into the back of his neck, and whispers, “Best two out of three?”
As he turns toward his own door, he hears something just beyond the heavy steel where Sherlock is hiding. It vaguely sounds like a violin.
“Our parents could no longer deny the danger she presented,” a voice intones from the darkened doorway, and Mycroft comes gliding in after it. “And so our sister was granted an indefinite stay in a psychiatric facility.”
“And you don’t, brother mine? Aren’t you at all interested in where they come from, why they are here?”
Greg and Pete say goodbye to him and Sherlock, promise to catch up more later, and then the tour continues.
With the look of pure, unadulterated venom on John’s face, Sherlock was glad he picked a time when their landlady was out for the shopping.
Sherlock pulls back, crossing his arms and dropping to sit on John’s bunk. “I didn’t know it was possible to hurt so much,” he whispers. “To have a mind ripped away from you like that.”
“Well, yes, I know that,” John says, dropping his hand. “But I meant us, back in the training room. You felt that, right?”
On top of Greg’s shoulders is a boy, about four, with brown hair and grey eyes, and a too-big hat with a Ranger emblem. When Lestrade turns and recognizes John, he grins.
“Ay, freak!” she yells at them. At first, John thinks she means him, but Sherlock’s low growl tells him otherwise. They approach regardless.
“And if I didn’t already know you’re probably going to ignore me, I would highly recommend you stay as far away from me as possible for a very long time.” He deflates slowly, helium leaking out of an old balloon, wheezing and wrinkled.
His brain tries to fill in the empty space but the world around him vibrates, not liking his attempt to change something. And all at once John realizes—
Harry and John Watson were born (November 1995 and December 1998 respectively) in America to an American mother and an English father. They moved to London in 2003.
Sherlock seems rapt with the Kaiju specimens, and rolls up his sleeves as he studies them. John’s eye is immediately caught with the myriad of colors spreading up Sherlock’s arms, and upon closer examination he determines the tattoos are of different Kaiju, some of which he recognizes, and other eclectic scientific symbols like chemical formulas, as well as a distinct honeycomb pattern that starts at his left elbow and disappears up his sleeve.
Immediately, he regrets it. Mary, ever the caretaker, prods him about Sherlock, about his feelings. He manages to talk about small things, at least for a little while, but when the conversation gets too close to his death, John breaks down again, shouting at Mary for pushing him and collapsing onto her couch, head in his hands, breathing heavy but not dangerously. “I’m sorry,” he says, for the second time in her living room.
John took that moment to turn back and disappear through the front door. Sherlock, surprised, followed quickly, letting the door slam not-so-softly behind him.
John takes only a half-step back gripping Sherlock’s fingers in his own. “Like this,” Sherlock demonstrates, pulling John’s hand along with his as he spins—Sherlock ducks slightly to accommodate John’s reach—then ends right where he started, looking at John.
He is only vaguely aware of Mycroft leaving the room, most of his focus on the man mourning against him and the large hole in the middle of his chest. He lets his head drop back but keeps a gentle grip on Sherlock. That’s the last thing he remembers before he falls asleep, morphine heavy and warm in his veins.
John quickly strikes toward Sherlock’s legs, which in his maneuver to avoid drops Sherlock down on one knee, and John gets him in the side. “Two-one. Concentrate,” he warns.
“Don’t you dare.” John fights the urge to break free of Sherlock’s grasp. He does not want to scare him. Can’t hurt him, not again.
“We are not okay,” he spat, a final blow to end the fight. Then he promptly turned and stomped up the stairs, making sure to slam the door to the flat as loud as he possibly could, to let Sherlock know he was not welcome.
“As you wish,” he returned, and they set off in the direction of the familiar sounds of Mrs. Hudson’s baking.
Sherlock inhales, composing himself as best as possible, gives John’s hand one last squeeze, and stands. “And where will we be going, dear sister?”
She knows him by now, knows what conversation points to toe around. She’s even done a little research of her own, just for context. Not enough to understand the whole story, just for a little perspective on John’s past. Together they go through a bottle and a half of wine, and she invites him back to her place for coffee, both of them giggly and a little flushed.
He answers, deliberately not looking at the group, “The blonde is Mary Morstan, she’s one of the candidates for tomorrow’s trials. The other three are the pilots of Striker—Jim Moriarty, Irene Adler, and Sebastian Moran.”
“I saw it,” he whispers, tracing lightly. “I felt it when the Kaiju pierced the Jaeger. When the arm was ripped out.”
Sherlock tosses the Kaiju bits he had been holding back down on the metal table, making Molly jump. He strips off his gloves and throws them haphazardly into a waste bin. And then he walks out of the lab.
“I don’t blame you, not for any of it. Not for Mary, not for anything. I hope you know that,” he whispers.
It takes every ounce of strength left in his slightly-inebriated body to not turn into a sobbing mess, because he won’t do that to Mary, even though he suspects she wouldn’t actually mind it as much as he fears.
He gets his breathing back to normal and Mary brings him a glass of water and some bedding for the couch. She kisses him chastely on the lips, asks him if he’s alright, and when he nods, she leaves him with a quiet “goodnight”.
Sally Donovan and her co-pilot came into view, still in their suits. Sally turned and caught eyes on John and Sherlock.
“Can I at least make you some toast, Sherlock? The doctor said you need to be eating on a more regular schedule.”
“During one of her episodes, she was angry. Redbeard got frightened by the yelling and growled at her. So she lashed out, threw something, nearly hit me. I began to cry, and Redbeard got protective, defensive. She tried to get to me and Redbeard bit her. I don’t even think it really hurt her, just made her angrier, and she kicked him away. She ran out of the house and didn’t come back for several hours. Mycroft tried to run after her, but she was faster. Of course, our parents were terrified. After that day, I don’t think it was ever the same. She avoided me constantly, with or without the dog. While I was away at school, Redbeard got sick. My father took him to the vet, but apparently he was beyond saving. I was devastated.”
“We may be going undercover, and I want to make sure we’re properly equipped for the situation.” He stands, passing into the kitchen and still calling out to John in the sitting room. “Your avoidance of addressing my question implies that you do not, but it wouldn’t be any trouble for me to teach you a few—”
“Boring!” his sister peals. “Well, here we are. Should we get going then?” She levels the gun back at Sherlock. “I assume emergency services have already been called, why don’t we get out of their way, brother mine? Oh, don’t do that.”
“We didn’t know about the poison until later, when the vet inquired about possible exposure. In addition to her seeming unaffected by the loss, my father found the poison hidden in the back of Euros’ wardrobe. When I returned from school, Euros told me that she wouldn’t have had to hurt Redbeard if he hadn’t hurt her first. Of course, I was hysterical, and tried to hit her. She broke my arm, and gave Mycroft a broken nose when he tried to restrain her.”
“What happened to Scott Donovan?” John asked. “I rode with the Donovans before, about six years ago.”
He avoids seeing her anywhere but work for the next week, until she corners him on his lunch break and tells him he has nothing to be embarrassed about. They make another date at her place.
There are an infinite amount of sounds all happening around them, but John focuses on himself and Harry, in the Conn-Pod. He knew the Drift was coming, and wanted one last moment to himself.
But then it happens. Sherlock uses John’s weight against him, rolling them and pinning John’s leg. The crowd roars and the Marshal shouts, “That’s enough!”
He hears the heavy footsteps of another person entering the Conn-Pod. “Hope you don’t mind me taking this side,” he says, turning, “my left arm is kind of…”
“You have nothing to be sorry for, John. It’s obvious he meant a lot to you. I don’t expect you to be okay with any of it, and I’m sorry if I was prying.”
He places a series of sucking, open-mouthed kisses to the root of John's cock, nose buried in his pubic hair. John groans, reaching down to fist the tip of his spit-damp cock frantically, hips pushing up into his grip -
And mindful of the fact that there's only so long before John's thighs begin to burn, of the fact that John - so considerate a lover - is hanging on for
"How do we play?" Sherlock asks, as he accepts the glass tumbler from John, and John pauses, still leaning forward in his seat.
He doesn't linger, and Sherlock's fingers slip through his hair as he ducks lower, kissing a path that loops whimsically around Sherlock's belly button, and Sherlock's stomach is shaking with laughter.
"Mmnn," Sherlock hums, against his mouth, and John's shaking with laughter beneath him - and there's nothing overtly funny; it's a joyous, simply
Sherlock's gaze flits over him for a couple of seconds before he sighs, loudly. "What did my brother want this time?"
of John's touch he craves, and it's nothing more than an unfortunate and previously-insurmountable height difference that doesn't work to their advantage when John bends him over the kitchen table, or takes him on all fours -
Sherlock's gaze is solemn. "Was that a 'no' on the tea-" and he doesn't get the whole sentence out before he cuts himself off with a bark of laughter, as John rolls them over and pulls him back in for another slow kiss.
John's throat is tight. "You're such an arse," he mumbles, tugging Sherlock to his feet, pulling him closer, "pissing all over my proposal like that."
"This," John says, lips brushing the nape of Sherlock's neck as he crouches behind him, "is the most ridiculous position I've ever tried."
and with a huff of a laugh, John starts to move, a little cautiously, at first, testing his balance, hands roaming up Sherlock's sides, gripping his shoulders, before settling clasped across his chest, and Sherlock groans, burying his face in crossed arms on the chair (not yet far gone enough to not be self-conscious of his unforgivably
"Oh, that's lovely," John breathes, lifting his head a little to watch Sherlock again, and Sherlock presses his forehead to the inside of John's thigh for a moment.
And because John has chronicled their lives together, because John remembers those first few hours and days almost as clearly as
John snorts, taking a seat behind his desk. "I heard your conversation. He said 'Piss off, Mycroft,' and hung up." His lips twitch.
He pulls off, shifting up onto his elbows, kissing his way up John's stomach, his chest, and John's hand's still in his hair. He kisses his way up the side of John's neck, and John tilts his head, allowing him better access, and Sherlock kisses along the line of his jaw.
"Good?" John teases, as he presses down again, and Sherlock groans, throaty and low. John holds it for a moment before relaxing his grip. He presses down again, carefully, and watches the way Sherlock's chest rises and falls with his breaths.
"Everything worth knowing," Sherlock amends, and John's expression is thoughtful, strangely unreadable.
. "I knew you weren't listening, you cock," he says, so affectionately that Sherlock inhales, sharply, as he searches for the conversation -
"Oh," he remembers, "Furniture. Clean-up. Dull." Those details hadn't seemed particularly important, but he dutifully rolls the condom on.
"Seeing something he would've liked, and not buying it," John's gaze drifts away for a moment, "Being invited to Christmas parties without him. Not hanging his stocking over the fireplace." John's smile is crooked, a bit sad.
, they're talking about it without talking about it, "Did you ever-" he breaks off, and a muscle in his cheek jumps, and Sherlock knows, he
John sighs, motioning for Sherlock's glass. He tops it up again, and says, concentrating hard on pouring, "The Rizla game. Like Twenty Questions."
; John's hand in his hair, guiding him, coaxing him to take him deeper, chin damp with spit and jaw starting to ache, but John's face slack, breath hitching -)
He sucks in a noisy breath, John still moving slowly inside him, thumbing Sherlock's nipple, almost idly. Sherlock pushes himself up on shaky arms. "Now you," he says, voice not much steadier, and John pulls out, sitting back on his heels, as Sherlock turns around.
Sherlock lets out a choked-off gasp, and John pulls back immediately, and Sherlock closes his eyes for a moment.
; carefully inching down until his nose pressed against John's pubic hair, slow and deliberate, John smoothing the hair back from his forehead almost frantically, feet shifting in the sheets), and he uses some of the spit escaping from his mouth to slick the way for his hand.
, pulling off a bit to tongue at the head of John's prick, to trace the slit, to purse his lips in a filthy kiss against the glans.
"It would appear so," Sherlock murmurs, pushing down his pyjama bottoms and kicking them off the end of the bed. He ducks down again, and although John's doesn't say anything else, he reaches down to run his hand through Sherlock's hair, affectionately, leaving his hand there when Sherlock makes his way up the length of his cock.
"Harder," Sherlock insists, wiggling his toes against John's chest, and John presses down a little more.
Sherlock turns his head on the pillow to look at John, raises an eyebrow. "I just wanted a cup of tea," he says, and John stares at him for a beat before Sherlock cracks, laugh low and unselfconsciously
Sherlock squints. "Did I?" He waves a hand, apologetically, "I don't always listen when you - talk."
"Brilliant," John says again, tightly, this time, and if fellatio perhaps reduces his admittedly already-limited vocabulary, Sherlock can't find it in himself to
"Oh, you're brilliant," John murmurs as he works a hand over himself (the thin layer of latex not dulling the sensation enough to distract him terribly), and John shortens his strokes, rubbing back and forth over Sherlock's prostate, and Sherlock makes a noise not unlike a sob.
(but the first and most important is, of course, sitting opposite him with thoughtfully narrowed eyes).
"When?" Mycroft asks, smile sharp, "Before or after you were dreaming about Emelia Ricoletti?" A beat. "What's the date today, Sherlock?"
"I just," he murmurs into the curve of Sherlock's shoulder; he swallows, hard, "need-" and Sherlock nods, tries to give him a moment, even as he shifts, restlessly, hands scrabbling at the cushion of his seat, the pressure, the
does (breathless and wide-eyed and so obviously on the verge of something special), John hides his laugh behind his fist. "Bit not good," is all he says, lightly, as he stands. "Tea?"
John's foot slips on the chair, ankle pressing against the side of Sherlock's calf through two layers of clothes.
"It sounds fairly straightforward," Sherlock says, with a frown, "Do we just ... ask twenty questions?"
, exactly, to find Mycroft waiting in his office the next morning. Annoyed, yes. Resigned, more so. But no, not surprised.
John fucks him through it, gentling his thrusts, as Sherlock shakes, trying again to lift up, and John follows him, rocking into him, and his toes squeeze together as he clenches down on John through the aftershocks.
"Easy," John says, reaching out; one hand reaching for the bed console, the other landing briefly on Sherlock's shoulder (warm, even through the hospital gown, and he's lived with, known, loved him for
," Sherlock says again, but differently (needy and longing and tightening up John's throat with one word).
He lowers his mouth again, more deliberately, and John's feet move restlessly on the mattress, knees drawing up and straightening as Sherlock gently alternates between sucking and lapping.
Sherlock shifts again, restless; he runs the arch of his right foot over the top of his left and Christ, is this what Sherlock feels like when it all falls into place? -
"No," John agrees, firmly, as Sherlock arches up into something that looks like a push up (this much, John can recognise) before swapping to stretch his other leg and
John grimaces. "I thought you were the smart one," he needles, off-hand and only barely derisive, but enough to get under Mycroft's skin a little, just a little, "Bit obvious."
Sherlock grabs one of his wrists with his free hand, pulling back long enough to murmur, "Not my hair," and John barks out a laugh.
John snorts in laughter, before cocking his head to the side, thoughtfully. "No, but let's - let's do that instead, yeah?" He settles back into his chair and raises his eyebrows at Sherlock, who nods, slightly. "Did you want to start?"
John jerks beneath him, tugging at the tips of their cocks as he comes, one heel bouncing on the bed, and he slows his hand as he wrings out the last of it. He lets his cock slip from his grip, and before he's caught his breath, he wraps his hand around Sherlock (the addition of John's ejaculate on his hand changing the texture of the slick in a minute way he files away to examine later).
Sherlock's jaw drops open as he gets closer, eyes closing as it builds at the base of his spine. John presses their cheeks together and Sherlock grabs at the bedsheet as he comes with a low groan. John strokes him through it, thumb swiping over the head of his cock, until Sherlock collapses to the side, still half-sprawled on John, one leg thrown over John's.
He presses one last kiss to Sherlock's stomach, gives his dick a bit of a quick, friendly rub and sits up. "Coming," he says, with a grin, and Sherlock briefly closes his eyes, like he's searching for patience. John grabs the back of his own shirt as he checks, "Off?" and Sherlock just rolls his eyes (which, John knows, means,
"You're later than you should be, you lack the distinct odour of one pressed up against other commuters, your hair's more windswept than just a walk from the station would warrant-" John touches his hair, automatically, "You accepted a lift from Mycroft - always a mistake - and needed to," he waves one hand, lazily, "cool down after you spoke." He glances up at John. "Like I said. Murder-y."
John's laugh sounds like a sob. He leans forward in his chair, and Sherlock rolls towards him, gingerly, in the bed. He reaches out and catches Sherlock around the back of his neck, thumb rubbing small circles through his hair. "I don't want to do this while you're in a hospital bed," he admits, closing his eyes.
"You don't know how to play Twenty Questions?" he asks, smile growing - but it's the kind of smile Sherlock likes, all desperately fond and
Sherlock turns his head slightly. "If that's true," he says, in mock disappointment, "you've been not nearly as sexually adventurous as your nickname led me to believe." John bites his earlobe gently in response. "Tell me," Sherlock continues, "was it women
Sherlock begin laying the foundation in his mind's eye. He'd have got much further along before morning if he hadn't had to keep pausing to repeatedly delete the irrelevant, intrusive image of Mycroft's knowing smirk.
He'd have to remember to turn off comments on John's blog as well. He'd make this work. John would come around and everything would be fine. He just needed to keep him distracted until then.
“Mr Holmes,” said the elderly man in a nondescript grey suit sitting in the car next to theirs. “I am Charles Waterhouse. I am told you desired a meeting with me.”
“A day after that, I got shot. What I need to know is, did the Army order that, or did Colonel Moran? Just how deep is the shit I’m in, and do I have any chance of surviving?"
"John, please—" He stretched out his hand but John wasn't there. The man who was there instead got off the bed and walked carefully around him without touching and quietly, quietly closed the door behind him when he left.
“You don't have to imagine; you were there,” Sherlock said, and John laughed much harder and longer than the poor witticism deserved, still high on adrenaline and endorphins.
Molly Hooper had been raised to do the right thing, always, even when the right thing hurt. Her mother had believed that good manners were the foundation of a civilised society and that there was no excuse for shirking.
“I realise this is anathema to an upper-class, repressed British male of your age, but as your consultant I need this information. How many episodes in the past week?”
is tricky. Some handlers never learn how to teach it; some dogs never learn to find it. This is a test for both Pixie and Jason.
Sherlock understood now, after the pool, understood how it was possible to be haunted by something that would not stay deleted, and how, even more oddly, the incident did not need to actually have occurred in order to haunt.
“This is Tobin. Passcode Carlo Bergonzi. We're coming in hot from Hoxton. I need Ultra-cleared witnesses and backup. Give me a destination.” Seconds later he said to John, “Moorgate. They'll escort us from there.”
John lathered his hair a fourth time and told himself he was making sure all the trimmed bits were out, which might have been more convincing if any of his hair had been longer than two centimetres.

in the world, genetically related or not. Sherlock did not yet have sufficient data to confirm that so it was still speculation at this point even though he was sure evidence would bear out his thesis eventually. He had a plan to test the theory. It involved a great deal of travel to collect data. Oceanic routes would be most effective for the purpose,
He checked the messages scrolling across Mycroft's phone, blanching when he realised that whatever his new security clearance was, it sure as hell wasn't high enough for him to be reading any of this.
he snarled down the staircase in response to the damned doorbell. He needed to talk to John and tying up Mycroft's loose ends was going to be boring. “He's going to keep at me until this is done. Please be here when I come back.”
Sherlock was a master liar and manipulator and John knew it as well as anyone, but...no. He'd been sincere when he'd taken John to bed, when he'd said he hated wanting something so ordinary as a commitment but wanted it anyway. John didn't doubt he'd played every bit of it for maximum effect, but he'd long ago accepted he lived with a drama queen.
The bed was warm and soft and full of Sherlock, and for once John didn't have to hurry off to the toilet. He left his eyes closed and pressed a kiss to the skin under his lips; Sherlock drew him in closer and sighed deeply.
"A cover story? No, because people will treat us differently and it will affect how we are with each other. You think it won't matter, but it will. It's jumping about six steps ahead of ourselves and that won't lead anywhere good. I know you want to skip the boring bits. I know you—we both know...Sherlock, we both know neither of us is ever leaving. But that doesn't mean we're ready to be...bound together."
He slammed the gearstick into first from third and then into neutral without touching the clutch.  “You're right,” he said over Harris's vehement but unimaginative cursing.  “You'd better drive.”  He stepped out of the driver's seat and tripped awkwardly, catching himself with an outstretched hand and scraping it badly on the wet pavement.
Mycroft ignored Fitzhugh and the handgun in his lap.  He made his way to the decanter, posture erect, gait even.  He kept his back to the man and placed his hands on the table, arms spread wide, clenching his fingers tightly on the edge as if in anger.  In truth, he needed the support.  Breathing was increasingly difficult and he dared not let Fitzhugh know how unsteady he was.
"John," he said, barely whispering, "I must not be taken hostage, not under any circumstances. Do you understand? That must
Robbie's a practical man. All Dog Squad men are, but especially the ones who work with cadaver dogs. You can't be delicate and train dogs to respond to the scents of blood, of brains and guts and bone, of death. Holmes was practical too, and Robbie knows he'd have appreciated the gesture. So he calls his mate Jason, who's training up a new bitch at the Met Police Dog centre, just a pup yet but showing some talent. He says he has a site to test her responses in the field to blood and death and maybe brain matter, given the nature of the fatality. Meet him at Bart's.
“Oh,” breathed Sherlock, glinting in the dark, a huge, demented crow come to peck out his eyes. “You
"I would also," he said, voice rising even though the smarter part of his brain was now jumping frantically up and down and waving warning flags,"like it quite a lot if you could manage to
"Right, then. Well. This is...I haven't thought about marriage for a long time. Things have, um, changed a lot since then. The Army. You. I don't know if what I used to want still applies. Always thought I'd like kids, you know, but now I think I'd be a crap dad." His mouth quirked. "Seems I like juggling grenades too much. Got a taste for it and can't stop. Also, I'm pretty sure kids aren't something you're ever going to want." He raised his eyebrows questioningly and got a hesitant nod in return. "Yeah, thought so. Somehow I don't think Harry or Mycroft is going to give us nieces or nephews, either, so," he blew out his breath regretfully, "no kids. That's...actually a good bit harder to accept than I thought it would be."
“So your justification for forging my signature in the fucking register is that Mycroft gave me a job? You—you—” He stood up and pointed to the sofa. “Our very first night at this flat, you posed yourself
Mycroft stabbed his umbrella spike into the pavement outside that squalid little flat and reminded himself his dentist had warned him not to grind his upper molar lest it crack. Damnable, irresponsible
“It will take him a little while longer to understand he's being—” Mycroft's lips twisted. “—hit upon. He is rather inebriated. Is that wise, given his family history? Well, no concern of mine.” He slid the photo into the pocket of the coat hanging at the door. “I shouldn't wait too long, Sherlock, if I were you. Good evening, Brother,” he said, and tapped down the stair with the insufferable gait of a man who has just landed a particularly well aimed blow.
It was coming on Valentine's Day, and the jeweller's box for his wife in Anderson's pocket undoubtedly had a lot to do with why Donovan had been exceptionally vicious at the crime scene that evening. It had been all John could do to bite his tongue and not escalate matters to the point where Lestrade would have had to get involved, because that wouldn't have ended well for anyone.
They stared at each other in mutual astonishment, John's mouth slightly open, Sherlock's cheeks pinkening. It had suddenly become difficult to swallow.
Because this matters, sod it, far too much to let it go without a fight, and he knows now there is a way back, even if he can’t see it yet.  Those two fools in the alley prove that, don’t they?  There is a way, there has to be, and he’ll be damned if he’s going to give up.
When John's shirt was unfastened, Sherlock paused and then tentatively ran a forefinger down the line of exposed flesh. John sucked in his breath and shivered, watching it move. Pale hands slipped beneath the sides of his open shirt, gliding over his ribs, running up the long muscles of his back. One ghosted over his shoulder, and he said, "Just a little tender. It's fine." Sherlock grunted disbelievingly but dropped the subject. "Weren't we going to talk about this?"
“Who just texted you on Mycroft Holmes's phone?” asked the colonel in a mild tone of voice that meant
“Good evening.” The voice matched the cologne, and when Greg turned around, the clothes matched everything. Wet-fox hair, sharp features, high hairline that would be receding in a few years, lovely soft hands.
John kisses him back, lightly at first, quietly smacking kisses, and when he sucks on Sherlock's top lip, Sherlock presses against him.
," Mycroft laughs, then, tilting his head to the side, as sincere as John's ever seen him, "I do look forward to it."
“Get it yourself,” he grumbled, but they both knew how this was going to end. While he was up, he pulled extra blankets from Sherlock's bed and tossed them on the floor by the hearth.
Heart slamming in his chest, he rested his forehead against the bedframe and swallowed until his stomach stopped heaving.
"Bill Murray" is the BBCSherlock!canon name of ACDSherlock!canon "Murray," the nurse who saved John's life in Afghanistan.  Because it's not hard enough building drama without invoking sodding
It was an understandable mistake, if unfortunate. He sighed. "As you say, he's never met Sherlock. Don't look so anxious, Summers, I'm not going to have him fired, but make sure he understands that nothing concerning my brother is ever classified as low priority, won't you?"
John's eyes went first to the bed, to the patient and the monitors surrounding him. Mycroft looked like hell, naturally, and John ruthlessly shoved back the rising guilt until he had time to deal with it later. He picked up the chart, flipped through it, and frowned again.
A sound like a slurred lisp had Sherlock bedside in an instant. Mycroft's eyes slitted open and his fingers twitched. “Fit. Fitz,” he managed.
John really couldn't blame the man. If their circumstances had been reversed, he'd also have threatened to sit on a patient with double head injuries only hours apart, one of which had occurred in an auto accident, unless said patient agreed to be seen by a doctor. A doctor who was not sharing a concussed brain with the patient.
"When someone sits on them, we will." Sherlock's fingers were at his fly now, and John shuddered when knuckles brushed the line of hair below his navel.
Except that when John checked, the bottle of lube had only a few drops left in it, not nearly enough for another go. Maybe he was flattering himself that Sherlock would want another round before the next trip to the shop, but John had stitched up rectal tears before and thought that for the patient, the pain had to be almost as bad as knowing what the conversation was like among the staff at the hospital. Nor did he trust himself to stick with oral if Sherlock wanted to shag and got persuasive—okay, so, a lube run it was, but just a fast one.
"Oh, right. I didn't see much, so I doubt I'll be much help. Yesterday's a bit of a blur. Tea? I've just got the kettle on again. We've no milk, I'm afraid," he said with a pointed look toward Sherlock, who was regarding Lestrade with a peculiar expression.
Mycroft nodded—this was nothing they hadn't considered—but it confirmed that the person they were searching for had military command experience.
“In addition to the physical symptoms, a degree of cognitive impairment is expected and likely temporary. Expect some emotional lability as well.” Avoid public interaction, in other words. “Mycroft.” He turned his attention back from the garden. “These after-effects are not failings of your body or mind. Please do not attempt to reassert control in ways that could be deemed foolish.”
Was that real gold leaf on the ceiling? Why would anyone even do that, except to show they had so much money they could piss it away on hideous decor? "What was this?" he asked without turning around. "Ballroom?"
John thought it through.  “You're seconded to Mycroft, but you've a primary mission objective from someone higher up.”
"What? Er, no. Just a suit." The comment had obviously gone straight over his head, and Mycroft sighed; he feared a query about a happy announcement in the near future would tip his hand too far.
He was lying, he knew Sherlock was lying and Mycroft was in the house, probably somewhere where he could hear them but apparently John had a kink about some part of that (which he would

Harris followed him like a puppy. There was no bloody way a kid this limp had taken out a Grenadier colonel so something more was going on here and he'd better figure it out fast.
He had, abruptly, a full-colour flashback to Sherlock, clad in a dressing gown and holding a currant bun,  planting himself between Mycroft and John and triumphantly declaring,
There was no chance, he knew, that Fitzhugh would try for anything but a head shot.  His armour was useless here.
There's a big splash in the news, of course, when word gets out. St Swithin's is crawling with reporters and rubberneckers the next day, making it three times as hard to search the woods for more bodies. Robbie and Ava sit quietly by the police van as the constables herd people out of the area. He strokes her ears and watches Holmes and Watson.
When he was finally released, he limped along the pavement, half-squinting against the freezing sleet splattering down around him and trying to flag a cab. He was soaked through and shivering and his knee hurt like mad from the swans' attack. He thought one had hit him with a wing there; he gritted his teeth every time his patella shifted and thought longingly of a warm auto. Naturally, they were few and far between.
Sherlock had devised sixteen ways to flense the epithelial layer from Mycroft's tongue before he noticed John had left the flat again. Shortly afterwards Lestrade phoned with a mysterious decapitation that kept him at Bart's until the small hours of the next morning. When he got home again, the flat smelt of bacon sandwiches and there was one wrapped in cling-film on the coffee table. It had gone soggy but he ate it anyway, pressing the collar of John's jacket to his nose and wondering if John would be unreasonably angry at being woken up by the violin.
Second, Sherlock was deeply dissatisfied with John's current arrangement of semi-casual relationships—
delivery." The sound coming from John started deep in his chest and was the sort of vocalisation normally reserved for sustained prostate stimulation.
“We'll be able to go home soon. You'll be more comfortable there.” He predicted John's next question. “Mycroft is being moved as soon as he's stable. His house is the most secure site possible for him, so equipment—what?”
"If you're trying to bribe me into staying in a sham marriage by offering me children I swear to Christ I will put my fist in your throat. Neither a marriage nor a child is a bloody
They'd been watching some movie. Sherlock remembered that although he had deleted the title and everything else about it. He and John had been watching some ridiculous movie with tedious plot holes and annoyingly stupid characters and he had said, "John, if
Sherlock's words came rapid-fire and he chewed his lips nervously. “The roof was the best place; could never get sniffer dogs up there, the pitch is too steep. But you need,” his respiration was elevated, and John stepped close, puzzled and concerned, “you need to know I understand.” His pale eyes speared John to the spot. “You don't intend to leave. Not ever. You don't intend to do it, but you need to know you
Three minutes later, staring blankly at the phone in his hand and realizing he couldn't remember Sherlock's number (which was not, of course, in the Contacts list, and why had he expected it to be?), he sheepishly conceded that the paramedic might have a point.
there isn't time. Monitor the messages that come through and be ready to drive as soon as we come out. Tobin stays with me.” Then they were sprinting off.
Sherlock had once accused Mycroft of indulging in the delusion that he was a medieval lord with vassals and minions at his command. He'd scored with that hit, but not for the reasons he thought. Fealty ran both ways, and to the extent Mycroft was able, he protected his own; failing that, he made their deaths useful instead of empty and pointless.
Too old to stitch, it turned out once John had a look at it, and full of debris, mostly fibre but glass flakes as well. "You should have had this cleaned at once," he said, knowing he might as well have been scolding a houseplant for all the notice Sherlock would take. "It's probably going to scar. Is this some kind of twisted apology?"
Shit, he thought. We're out of milk. And bread. And bacon. I'll have to fetch something for breakfast.
Keeping his eyes fixed on the ornamental pond barely visible through the murk, he said, "You've met Sebastian Wilkes. Imagine a group of young men like him: boys of privilege from families with the influence to make youthful indiscretions disappear, raised with a sense of entitlement and the knowledge there will be no consequences for their actions. No responsibilities, no obligations, no purpose, unlimited wealth and with it the means to assuage boredom in whatever ways they please, all of them urging one another to greater and greater excesses. Can you imagine a more fearsome pack of wolves? Sebastian was not by any means the worst of them. Victor outstripped him by orders of magnitude."
He pressed the package back into her hands. "Why don't we keep this for later and surprise John? Perhaps Christmas?"
under his hands and mouth, making noises that shot straight to his groin. It was brilliant, fucking brilliant and it'd been much too long, which is why it took hardly any time at all before his mouth was flooded with bitter salt and Sherlock let go of his head to pound a fist against the wall and groan loudly. He pulled off fast, coughing and spluttering. Damn it, Sherlock had
“Such noble sacrifice.  Naturally this has nothing whatsoever to do with my being the only person who knows you're trying to reverse-engineer the codecracker device that would give you full and free access to military drones.  You intend to use them first to re-ignite hostilities and make void the peace treaties I've negotiated.”
Sherlock made a terrible sound when John kissed him. John knew that sound: it was the one you made when you'd hurt for so long that the absence of pain came as a shock. He let it buckle his knees, let himself slide down the long, warm body until he could press his face into the stomach above a belted waistband. His hands slid up the thighs on either side of him, and Sherlock made another awful noise when John tugged his shirt out of his trousers and ran his lips over bare skin.
"I apologize. I'm afraid I miscalculated," (and oh, John would never know how difficult it was to say that so lightly, as if it were nothing of significance), "pushed him too far and panicked him into this. I don't imagine you were prepared to deal with such a declaration at this time."
reprovingly. “Patience, Dr Watson. There is a rhythm to these things. First I put on a show of intimidation, next I explain how I may be of service to you, and then you to me. And then the stick, should the carrot prove inadequate. You've created quite a stir in certain circles. You have enemies in high places. You need friends in similarly lofty places. I could be your friend, Doctor.”
When he woke, he was alone. There was a blanket over him and the Union Jack pillow under his head, but when he called blearily, "Sherlock?" there was no answer. He slept again.
"Huh," he said, scrubbing at his eyes and wincing at an unexpectedly sore cheekbone. He was finally starting to feel warm, which meant he'd been in the cab a lot longer than the trip should have taken. Oh, right—blocked streets.
Oh. She thought they'd had the wedding without her. Well, they had, but they'd had it without John too, and strictly speaking he was supposed to be integral to the proceedings so she could hardly be put out about not being there under those circumstances. It seemed she was, though, if the quivering lip meant anything. Really Quite Extremely Not Good, Not Even a Little.
John rolled a little to the right to take the pressure off his arm and restore circulation. It was coincidence that rolling pressed his...thigh against Sherlock's thigh. He'd barely shifted when the hand on his neck tightened and the
Through all those months of agonizing and soul-searching, the biggest question John had kept coming back to wasn't
Oh Jesus Jesus Jesus let him be right about why Mycroft was still stiff when the treatment for cracked ribs wasn't binding them, not anymore, so there was another reason and oh Jesus fucking Christ let him be right. He aimed for the heart because if he was right—
“So I got the kid patched up and then my heat came on. Wasn’t due for another two days; I had arrangements to meet a friend in Kandahar and spend it with him, but...but the kid brought it on sooner and...I had to get out of there, get back to my own tent, at least. Alphas aren’t deployed into warzones, so I was alone. Bill, my medtech, he tried to help, but he’s human. Christ, it
“No,” Stamford said immediately. Surely he wasn't still upset about the pornography download? It had been for a
He managed to shuffle back on his knees just before Sherlock's legs collapsed entirely and he slid down the plaster to land with a thump. Breathless and panting, one hand still buried in John's hair, he cracked open unfocused eyes and pulled John in for a sloppy, awkward kiss. “Sorry,” he said insincerely.
Furthermore, Molly was being especially persistent today with the—he could only think of it as tidbitting behaviour, bringing coffee and biscuits and and lingering with obvious intent in spite of the fact he was a different
"Idiot," Sherlock said, and then he was up over the table, pulling John across by his shirtfront, kissing him with a desperation that made John's heart flip and his blood run straight to his cock.
John hums in agreement, pecking at his keyboard. "Red herring," he murmurs, turning slightly to look at Sherlock, who gapes at him, before turning back to the screen.
"Every day," Sherlock says, quietly, fingertips tracing the rim of his glass. Honesty is good. John likes honesty.
Sherlock hums a little around his cock, pleased, and John digs his heels into the floor to push up, lazily, into his mouth.
Sherlock's eyes close, as if he's been wounded. "John," he says, opening them, with effort. "John, you're so much more than that." His gaze travels over John's face, as if he's memorising this moment; then, softly, "You always have been."
can't help glancing up in surprise when John pulls out his chair again. He wraps his hands around his mug, loosely and licks his lips just once. "Grief is ... a funny thing," John says - so obviously something his therapist told him and Sherlock clenches his teeth at the triteness - and John holds up a finger "No, just, hang on-" he breaks off.
"Christ, Sherlock," he gasps as he withdraws and pulls frantically at his cock until he comes with a spasm over Sherlock's arse. He sucks his lower lip into his mouth, traces the crease at the top of Sherlock's thigh gently.
John digs the heel of his hand into the meat of Sherlock's thigh as he drags his hand back up. "I find the sensation - satisfactory," Sherlock says.
"I thought it wasn't a proposal," Sherlock says, against his mouth, and John bites down lightly on his lower lip for a moment in retaliation.
, eyebrows drawing together and mouth falling open and it's so ridiculously dramatic and endearing that John can't help but snort in laughter.
John works a foot between Sherlock's spread thighs and presses his shin against the pants-covered bulge there.
Sherlock twists again, writhing on top of John where John all but has him pinned, as he comes over his bare stomach, legs straining against John's hold.
thinks," John says, and he licks his lower lip "that you're worried that me getting married will - change things."
"Sherlock," John says again, like he knows he should be appalled. "Her fiancé?" he raises his eyebrows. "Or - ex-fiancé," he corrects, brow furrowing (and John's forehead is so distractingly fascinating-)
"John," he says again, opening his eyes, and bugger it if there was more to that sentence, because John's leaning in to kiss him hard, hand finally slowing, as he pushes his hip against Sherlock's side.
Sherlock pushes himself up again, straightening his arms. "You're aroused," he says, with a slight frown.
"I'm not," John says, quick and earnest (and, oh, still so carefully navigating these waters). "I," he adds, closing his laptop, putting it aside, "am just a very lucky man."
"Hi," John says, when he reaches John's chin, and he's smiling so hard that the creases at the corners of his eyes deepen, and Sherlock rolls his eyes in reply, but kisses him on the mouth, softly.
"You'd," he pulls back to murmur against John's mouth, "best be getting on with it." John leans away for a disorientating moment, returning to press a condom into his hand; Sherlock blinks, perplexed. "John-" they dispensed with the need for prophylactics
"Shut up," John grins, affectionately, pausing for a moment to take Sherlock's lower lip between his teeth and delicately tug, a gentle rebuke that Sherlock pulls out of when he smiles.
John blows out a breath through slightly-pursed lips; irritated, yes, but - his posture, his hands, both back around the mug again - not irritated at
He pulls it up and over his head, drops it beside the bed, kicks off his jeans for good measure, and grabs the lube from the bedside table. He slicks up his hand and tosses the lube onto the bed, stretches out and presses up against Sherlock on his side, left leg over Sherlock's left.
He turns over a photo delicately, pausing to study the next one, and John glances out the window as the car starts moving.
Reluctantly, he wraps his hands around Sherlock's top leg, presses a quick kiss to his ankle, before moving it back down, so both of Sherlock's legs are hanging off the side of the table again. Sherlock pulls himself up and drapes an arm around John's shoulders as he tugs him into a sweet, light kiss.
“Well, Jim is the most left-brain of the group, while Irene and Seb always ride right-hemisphere. They alternate out. Once, when Jim was out with a bad concussion, Seb rode left-hemisphere. They were great, but Jim really holds the reigns for them.”
“When I was 6, she was 10, and Mycroft was 13, I begged for a dog for Christmas. It was all I wanted. And I got one. He was an Irish Setter, with beautiful red fur.”
The kiss goes from tender to heated very quickly, and before he knows it his jumper and shirt are off and her blouse is open.
Sherlock nods his head in the direction of two other Jaegers. “Those are the Mark V’s, Crimson Sentinel and Rogue Striker.”
Sherlock looks unsure; afraid, but not of John. He looks nervous. He looks at John with some emotion tucked behind all of it, something John recognizes but cannot identify.
The next date, at her place, sees him through a few beers and a couple glasses of whiskey, and he gets chatty. He starts off telling a story that eventually turns into a case he worked with Sherlock, the Connie Prince murder, with the brother and the hairless cat, and by the time he realizes what’s happening he’s almost hyperventilating and Mary’s rubbing his back, trying to calm him down.
John flinches, but recovers. “I don’t know,” he says. “I won’t ever know. And I don’t think I could handle knowing.”
“We managed to keep most of them from reaching Sherlock. Unfortunately, we learned that Euros had managed to escape under the ruse of a suicide attempt, an intentional overdose, injuring several attending staff along the way. She came home, as expected, and attempted to burn down the house.”
“Oh, good, it was Lestrade again. If it was your brother I might have been forced to open the door and rub this in his face.”
They arrive, dressed to the nines. John in his brand new tuxedo—his old one had gotten a bit small and smelled like old mothballs, so Sherlock had insisted on buying him another.
“Capt. Watson, this is my brother, Sherlock Holmes, one of our main Jaeger engineers and Kaiju scientists. He personally overviewed the Mach 3 restoration project.”
His flatmate turns and takes hold of the end of the coffee table and slides it away, clearing a large area of the floor.
“Well,” Sherlock drones, “I was raised in a class where such practices were expected—Mycroft knows, too, but he’s dreadful—but I found dancing was something I enjoyed as a adolescent.”
“Yes, lucky,” a voice booms in behind them. Marshal Holmes joins them on the floor. “That Kaiju broke through the wall in a matter of minutes. If you hadn’t been there, who knows what would’ve happened.”
Sherlock’s sudden appearance only seemed to make all John’s thoughts slow to an indistinguishable pace, and then sprint forward in a flash of fury and relief.
They flirt steadily--mostly she flirts--for the first month or so. He tries to ask her out for coffee, flustered and nervous. Even though he makes a tiny bit of an ass of himself, she accepts graciously. They go during their lunch, and he avoids the topic of Sherlock at all costs, having to redirect the conversation when it veers too close a few times. Not yet. He can’t do that yet.
“Yes, you did.” The words leave him without permission. They taste like Sherlock’s blood on his hands.
Sherlock lets out a low chuckle. It sounds damp, wet. John wants so much to look at him, look into his eyes and see…well, he doesn’t know what he wants to see. Does he want to see light, warmth, and know Sherlock’s going to forgive him anyway? Or does he want emptiness, fear, that Sherlock will actually save himself from whatever future hurt John is sure to cause him?
He goes to comfort Sherlock instinctively, no longer caring about what the contact could insinuate about their relationship and briefly forgetting his wound. He flinches, gasps with a twinge of pain across his chest, but keeps pulling Sherlock closer.
Sherlock clicks his teeth. “Jim thinks he’s God’s gift to Earth, and the other two seem to believe him,” Sherlock scoffs. “My brother was about to move him before we were decommissioned. Now, there aren’t enough of us to spare him.”
“We’ve met,” John says to Sally, “My sister and I rode with you and your cousin about six years ago.”
He hears a voice. His thoughts stop abruptly. His pulse thrums violently through his neck, into his hands.
Maybe too good? This does not occur to John until he gets a package in the mail: a DVD labelled “MISS YOU”. He immediately calls Sherlock, feeling the cold weight of his wedding band as he dials and brings the phone to his ear.
John ties his on. He looks over at Sherlock, who takes one last scan over the room before doing the same.
Sherlock had just picked up three new gray hairs that hadn’t been present before he left and was about to continue looking for more when John was instantly on him, his mouth hot and angry over Sherlock’s.
John is secured into the left side of the Conn-Pod, and Harry on the right. Greg Lestrade’s voice floods over the intercom.
John stopped, locked into Sherlock’s glistening eyes, so full of emotion, clearly betraying the ‘sociopath’ in him.
When he thinks back on it later, he hates himself more in that moment than he ever has before, and what makes him so sick about it is that he doesn’t realize what’s happened until after he’s left, Sherlock shaking and bleeding on the floor of the morgue, and John flees because his body recognizes that he needs to get as far away from Sherlock as possible—for all the wrong reasons.
“John?!” Oh, god. He’s been shot. Sherlock runs to him. “John. John, can you hear me?” John doesn’t respond, body limp on the floor. He’s not dead, he’s still breathing, he’s still bleeding, oh god. “John!”
But then, miracle of miracles, out of nowhere, here comes Sherlock. Dead but 'Not dead’. Mary’s head is spinning and John’s clearly upset.
Sherlock clears his throat. “It will be easier with a proper partner,” he says, dropping his eyes. “Likely they won’t be as tall as I am.”
John pauses, he knows Sherlock’s seen them before, but after the Drift everything is different. Not new, but not quite familiar either. And so he nods, and then pulls off his shirt.
“Well, Watson’s still got a lot of ground to cover, so we’ll have to be going,” Sherlock interjects, quickly turning away from the group.
His head turned away from Sherlock’s chest, and then back. “Seven and thirty six,” Hamish recited. He had only just started grasping the concept of time, but he knew his numbers well enough to accommodate.
“I don’t have a choice, alright?” he shouts. “As much as I hate it, my brother has the authority here. Just let it go, John.” Sherlock pushes past him and disappears into his room.
Mary’s voice ebbs, and John feels something in his perspective shift. Everything suddenly feels…opaque. Shimmering. Like a curtain on a window not actually meant to keep out the light.
For a moment, they are completely still, waiting, and then Sherlock lunges. John quickly side-steps, and as Sherlock loses balance he strikes the staff down, stopping just short of the back of Sherlock’s head. “One-zero,” John says.
John sighs, looking at Sherlock’s door and wondering what is getting the Holmeses all bent out of shape.
Back in John’s bunker, Sherlock is sitting on the edge of his bed, just like the first time they kissed.
As they lean back against the wall outside of 221A, at the bottom of the stairwell toward 221B, heaving and panting and trying to arch their breath, that’s when Sherlock sees it.
“Me too,” John says, taking it and rising from the mat. He gives Sherlock’s hand a shake, the releases it to pat him on the shoulder. “He’s my co-pilot,” John tells Mycroft.
They step together, ending just as they began; with Sherlock flush against him, John feels the heat creeping over his cheeks.
Sherlock smirks, and meets John at the edge of the mat. “This should be interesting,” John says quietly, while Sherlock is unbuttoning his shirt.
Sherlock slid back into consciousness slowly, a warm body snuggled against him. Not the larger, solid form of his husband, but the small, nearly vibrating form of their son.
“How is it relevant?” he asks, avoiding the question. John’s not entirely sure what Sherlock is doing, but he’s not about to just surrender information. He’s surprised Sherlock hasn’t just deduced him.
John’s other hand slips from his forehead, ending up at his side just centimeters from Sherlock’s falling from his neck.
“No.” John took a deep breath. “No. You do not get to come in here, after two years of letting me think you dead, and explain it all away. You were dead, Sherlock, and I grieved you. I’m still grieving you, even with you bloody standing right in front of me,” he rushed, at a loss for breath once again.
They remain somewhere in the middle for some time. Sometimes Mary feels like John’s girlfriend, and other times she feels like his therapist. Most often, she simply feels like his friend, and that’s okay. She doesn’t try to push him any more, and if he feels like sharing usually he will, for a little while. But this is where they hover, on the edges of a relationship, until it’s been a year since they met. He insists on taking her out for a nice anniversary dinner, somewhere special.
Sherlock looks at him for a moment before speaking. “She was brilliant, just like Mycroft and I. More so, even. She felt things more deeply than any of us could ever know. And I think that broke her.”
There’s a hiss of release from outside and then the Conn-Pod is moving, down toward the rest of Atlas Zeta.
They’re still in bed. The early morning sun is breaking through their window, streaking across the duvet.
And for a brief moment, he allows himself to revel. To appreciate. He lets himself want, only just this once, to curl up in this moment and live there. He memorizes this—the pull of his diaphragm as he attempts to reoxygenate his body, the way John looks hunched over and laughing breathlessly, the way his mind reels and he does not observe but only see—against all instincts.
So when the match ends, John winning 4-2, he shakes Mary’s hand and then walks to the edge of the mat. “What’s all this about?” he asks.
He follows him back to the bunkers, where he jogs to catch up with him before he reaches his door. “Sherlock,” he says, stopping him with a hand to hold him back. “What was that back there?”
John nods, shakes her hand. She seems the nicest of the four, also the least intimidating. He doesn’t know how that speaks to their compatibility.
Sherlock sighs, rolls his eyes, and reaches down to gently grab his flatmate’s arm and guide him out of his chair.
He huffs out a laugh. Well, it’s meant to be a laugh, but it’s caught somewhere in the middle between that and a sob. It hurts. “Shut up,” he chokes.
His brain is still spinning with adrenaline and rage and fear and guilt and so many other not-good things that he doesn’t have the capacity to process it all.
“When she took them they made her sick, or they impaired her mind. When she didn’t, she had major manic and depressive episodes. She couldn’t be sent to school, so Mother attempted home-schooling. But still Euros isolated herself, even from us. I once didn’t see her for a week, because she only left her room to get food, and she only did so when we were either asleep or out. The only signs of life were from her violin.”
Hips pumping lazily, John's grip loosens for a moment as he reaches forward and takes Sherlock's right hand in his, lacing their fingers together, tugging his hand up off the chair, guiding it back, behind him,
He pushes John back onto the living room floor, legs unfolding from beneath him as he stretches out his abused thighs. Sherlock all but rips the condom off John, flinging it aside, blindly, and John's groan - part laughter, anyway - breaks off when Sherlock leans down to swallow his prick (pausing only briefly to grimace at the faint taste of latex).
Sherlock lets out a breath and John kisses the trail of hair beneath his belly button, mouthing at his lower abdomen, gently scraping his teeth against the soft skin.
from this), listens to the bustle of John moving around the kitchen (confidently; cupboard doors opening just once, and John had wasted no time undoing all of the changes Janine had made to the kitchen).
"So," he says, raising his eyebrows at Sherlock. "Mary. Moriarty." His left hand clenches, where it lies on his thigh, for a beat. He forces it to relax, wiggles his fingers a little.
Mycroft studies him for a long moment, before nodding to the driver, discretely watching them in the rearview mirror.
"Sorry," he says, unapologetically, scooting back to kiss Sherlock's hip as he wraps a hand loosely around Sherlock's cock.
"Of course you do," he agrees, and Sherlock smiles back at him. Then, as if it's taken a second to sink in, he leans forward, squinting at Sherlock. "
Sherlock's eyelids flutter closed as he arches against the pressure, huffing little breaths through his nose as he sucks John with long, slow pulls, worming a hand between them to press his knuckles gently against John's balls.
"Gyros?" John asks, "Are you hungry?" Turning to Mycroft, standing on the other side of Sherlock's hospital bed, "Is he hungry?"
He reaches up to tease the slick head of John's prick with his fingertips as he places a series of sucking kisses down the length of his shaft, and John's knees lift up, restlessly, at the teasing touch.
He chances a glance back up at John, who's opened the newspaper again; John, who's been working through his grief with Ella, who -
Sherlock reaches up and unbuttons John's trousers for him, making sure to brush the back of his hand along John's cock as he does. He slowly pulls down the zipper - pausing to trace his nose along the length of John's thickening cock through his pants - before tugging the trousers down. He delicately peels John's pants down, and wraps a hand around the base of his cock.
," John says, delighted, trying not to laugh, and Sherlock's expression shutters, feet stilling. "Seriously?"
John adds sugar to one of the mugs, stirring for longer than necessary, teaspoon knocking gently against the ceramic, as he stares at the cupboard (stares at the cupboard while Sherlock stares at his back, stares at
(he brings his legs together and lifts up a bit, for a bit of breathing room, when it all becomes just too
"Can I-" he breathes, "inside-" and Sherlock cups his face and kisses him back, orgasm-soft and sweet, before reaching for the waistband of John's pants. He peels them carefully down, over John's rather insistent erection, and John kneels on the bed.
He nuzzles John's groin through his trousers, and John leans forward to grab the edge of the table. Sherlock rubs his cheek against John's cock, likes, John assumes, from the tiny smile, the way it twitches against his face.
"You've been dreaming about Mary?" John says, lightly (but remembers the last time Sherlock was seeing her every time he closed his eyes).
Unmoved; "That was, essentially, the diagnosis." He glances over at John, now. "Make no mistake, John. The facility was not a guarded fortress on a deserted island." His gaze travels back to Sherlock. "But that is, perhaps, how it might be
John's still breathing hard when Sherlock lifts his head to land a lazy kiss on the corner of his mouth.
(stomach down, hips pushing rhythmically into his pillow, John straddling his thigh, his knuckles teasing -
"Cock," he says, affectionately, relaxing his grip again for a moment. "You got one more in you?" and Sherlock's watching him, fascinated. He gives John another tiny nod. "Right," John says, getting to his feet, "I need you up on the kitchen table for this one."
John squeezes out a little bit more of the Deep Heat for one more pass down Sherlock's legs, and one of Sherlock's hands grips the back of his neck as he leans in for a kiss.
-" bit angry; he sucks in a steadying breath through his nose, "and you had a bad reaction to whatever you took," he amends.
Sherlock glances up at him, lets the moment stretch out between them for a beat, before nudging John back towards a kitchen chair. John collapses backwards into it, trousers and pants still around his knees, and Sherlock drapes himself over John's lap.
Sherlock opens his legs, and John settles atop him more fully, both tacky and drying, and Sherlock hooks one leg over John's, heel resting on his calf.
Sherlock wonders. "You're mourning ... what could've been. You ... Molly would've imagined a future with him. The first Christmas without him will be ... hard."
"Oh!" Sherlock looks stunned, overwhelmed, and John relaxes his grip for a beat before pushing at his legs again. Sherlock's back arches, hand flying over his cock, as John holds his thighs open (can only imagine the burn, the good
"Sherrinford is a real place," Mycroft says, without taking his eyes off his brother, who makes no move to interrupt him, "Neither institution nor asylum; it is a - facility. In which children can be ... assessed."
this'll be in my wedding speech," he says, with a straight face, "Proposing after being threatened by Sherlock's big brother."
- Sherlock arching his back and spreading his legs impossibly wider when John gets the angle just right -
John raises his eyebrows, head jerking, just once. "Cheers. Not asking for it." Mycroft frowns, and John leans forward, studying him. "Oh, God. Is this your version of the 'if you break my brother's heart' speech?" he asks.
John rests his hands on Sherlock's thighs. "Deep Heat?" he suggests, and Sherlock makes a delighted noise in the back of his throat. John kisses him again, quickly, before ducking back into the living room for the tube.
Sherlock's eyes widen momentarily, one of his elbows bending slightly in surprise. He processes that. John lets him.
"No-thing," Sherlock draws out, more breath than voice, as he kicks his feet, heels bouncing on the couch.
"- are idiots, yes, I know," John finishes. He sighs. "Sherlock - proposals, getting married - it should be romantic. Not something blurted out over," he squints at the setup, "what the hell is that?"
He blinks, repeatedly, to clear his head, and John's studying him in the silence of the flat, eyes dark (it's the poor lighting, he knows, that's all). Sherlock swallows. "I found the opportunity has never ... arisen."
"Oh, that's lovely," John says, softly, watching himself sink back in, and Sherlock makes a strangled noise into the seat.
He urges Sherlock backwards again, and Sherlock inhales sharply through his nose when John presses him against their bedroom wall.
John's smile is automatic, helpless. "Yeah?" he murmurs (won't tell Sherlock just yet; he's been an idiot about a few things in his life, but he
Sherlock ducks his head and takes John in his mouth again, slowly inching down, hands resting lightly on John's thighs.
He comes with a long groan, in a few pulses that Sherlock swallows eagerly, pulling back to lap at the head of his prick again, and John lets out a gorgeous sigh.
He pulls him through it, rubs him through the aftershocks with his own come, harder than he'd personally enjoy, but Sherlock shivers, his expression blissful.
"You're just," John swallows, "very flexible." Sherlock pushes up onto his hands again, and, Christ, something about his straining biceps and the pointed toes on his right foot are
"Often am, around this," John says, mildly, with a nod at Sherlock's pyjama-clad form. No point denying it.
"You're not invited," John deadpans, but he doesn't bother schooling his expression as Mycroft studies him for a long moment.
, his leg passing where John would've stopped with little resistance). Sherlock links his fingers together and grips his leg just below his kneecap, holding his leg in place for a long moment.
Sherlock laughs a little (embarrassed, proud) into the fold of his arms, and John's breath is punching out of him through gritted teeth.
Sherlock pushes up on his knees, still mouthing at John, and he shoves his hand down between his legs, palming himself through his pyjama pants. He groans, rubbing the heel of his hand down the length of his cock until he's squirming, rutting back against his hand, pushing himself further into John.
he imagines telling Natalie, lips twitching. He'll tell her about the detective who self-rewards, God help everyone, at crime scenes, in defiance of common sense and common decency, and how he likes the man anyway. He'll tell her, and maybe she'll wrinkle her nose and smile. Maybe she'll laugh again. It's been too long. And maybe they'll start feeling out the way back to each other even if it takes a while to get there, because the separation hurts more than the fumbling, clumsy knocks they may give each other as they try to work it out.
John's world had been a very different place ever since the tailor Mycroft had recommended had discreetly murmured that Sir would perhaps find pants ruined the line of his trousers and that this had been taken into account in the structural details. John's mental faculties had immediately short-circuited whilst trying to remember if he had ever, ever, ever noticed VPL on Sherlock's arse. Oh, God, was he seventeen?
"Sherlock? I'm not packing for you, you know. If you want anything from your room then you'll need to get your lazy arse up here and get it yourself."
John turned quickly to look at Mycroft, hints and clues at last slotting into place: trembling hands, slurred speech, excessive confusion that was growing worse, blurred vision, too, if the way he was squinting at Sherlock and Banks was anything to go by, but not much sweating and no tachycardia because those would be masked by the beta-blocker. He was sliding into hypoglycaemia through gradual insulin overdose. What were the odds that was accidental, when his doctor was a prime cardiologist and intimately familiar with the effects of insulin?
There was some awkwardness as they tried to work around various injuries old and new until John became so frustrated with Sherlock's refusal to stop bearing weight on his injured arm that he barked, "Lie
"It does, it really does. He was right, you know. I can't practice anywhere else and still be free to come when you call. I'd been trying to sort that for months. It
Any plan he could come up with, Sherlock would see through in minutes, so—yes!—he needed a meta-plan. That was good. What if...there was no pattern for Sherlock to deduce? What if John just did random odd things, things he wouldn't normally do, and let Sherlock try to string them together?
The taste of latex was nowhere in his fantasies, but without it he wouldn't get any of this at all. He made up for it by licking the salty crease of a thigh, the nicely heavy bollocks, the trail of hair from navel to flushed cock. When he closed his mouth around the cockhead, the belly under his forehead quivered and a soft hand touched his hair lightly; still polite, still careful, and Greg didn't want that. He wanted him shattered, broken to pieces, shaking and swearing and shoving himself down Greg's throat.
he said, and John said, "I'm here," and took his free hand palm to palm, fingers interlaced, tethering him so that he could let himself fall.
Mycroft watched the transformation: the jaw set, mouth hardened, lines deepened around the eyes. John stood, spine straight, facing Mycroft square on, and the coldly furious look he had seen once before in an abandoned warehouse stared at him out of dark blue eyes. "Mycroft," he said softly, and a foolish man might have thought the mild tone meant John was even-tempered. "Whatever this game is between the two of you, well, clearly you're both getting something out of it because you've been at it forever. Fine. But I won't be the stick you poke Sherlock with. You don't get to hurt him through me."
He blinked his surroundings into focus. Sherlock was crouched in front of him, hair wild, mouth bruised, cheek scraped and bleeding. The scarf hanging out of the pocket near John was wet; he must have used it to...clean himself. John turned his face away, shame burning his gut. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Any potentially awkward question about who would sleep where later that night were answered when Sherlock collapsed shortly after orgasm, sprawling over John's mattress and burrowing into the pillows. Whatever he'd been doing the night before, it clearly hadn't included sleeping.
with cheese straws and praise. This would be an entirely different story without her. You have no idea, truly. As always, all blunders are my own.
But while Mycroft Holmes could personally wrap the entire British government around John Watson to protect him, he could not promise he would not someday require the man to be sacrificed for the greater good, could not promise he would never use John to force Sherlock's hand, and if that day came he would do what he must without hesitation and without remorse. And he would not lie to his brother. At least he would not do that.
Sherlock flushes, and - maybe not sure that John's not taking the piss - waits for John to get to his feet and extend a hand. He grabs John's hand and scrambles up off the couch, and John tugs him closer, lifting his chin to place a delicate kiss at the corner of Sherlock's mouth.
"I ... dreamt?" Sherlock tries out the word, "That Eurus, that she-" his voice catches and John stares at him.
He sucks lightly at the head of John's cock, tries tonguing at the slit (both taste and John's reaction noticeably stronger), and swallows down as much as he can, wrapping his hand around the base.
," Mycroft says, with a bit more disbelief than John feels is really necessary, "For reasons I doubt I'll ever fully understand."
"No." Not tonight. Soldiers into battle. "Whatever happens," John says, haltingly, because he's in the dark about the next phase, and he suspects that's all Sherlock's doing, "it has been - a privilege and an honour. To have been your friend."
John kisses him again, deliberately, once, twice, before pulling back to tug on Sherlock's shirt. "Off," he says, roughly, running his hands over Sherlock's waist, the small of his back.
long few days," John says, voice low and tight, "And if this absolutely can't wait until your brother isn't high as a kite-" Sherlock's mouth opens, affronted, "then can you at least give us
- can say it sometimes (the direct, teeth grazing John's earlobe, "I want to ride you"), (hands pinned to the mattress, John between his naked thighs, a challenge, "Fuck me through the headboard," - a pause, a crinkle appearing at the top of his nose, "Not literally, of course-" and John had ducked his head and pressed their mouths together to avoid killing what remained of the mood), (and the bloody romantic; once, the very first time, with a helpless twitch of his shoulders, "You. Just ... you, John.") -
