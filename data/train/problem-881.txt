He rushed back up the stairs, Greg on his heels, and tried to find their waitress. He found her and asked her if she had seen their friend, the one who had only ordered chips. She hadn’t either but when she saw John’s disappointed face she pointed at the counter.
It had turned out to be a very interesting, challenging case. Naturally, Sherlock had very quickly found the key clue that had taken them through half of London, leading them on a breadcrumb trail, new clues appearing right and left, making it almost impossible for them to catch a break in between changing sceneries.
“I am, “Molly said, looking at him sharply. “Didn’t you hear about the Omega Protection Act from four years ago? They took almost all Omega’s rights away, claiming it was for the good of the nation. It’s because birth rates have dropped significantly, Beta fertility has decreased significantly which is why they’re depending on Omegas to increase the birth rates again.”
“I just wanted to point out, “the familiar baritone said pointedly, “that even though Omegas may seem to have a lower tolerance towards toxicants in general, there are certain specific toxicants they are more immune to, ones which Alphas in specific are weaker too. Alpha physiology is especially weak to carbon tetrachloride, methyl acrylate, and even mercury, for instance. Those are substances to which an Omega’s physiology is much more resilient, due to the additional alarm pheromones only existent in Omegas. So I think it’s a little too easy to say that Omegas are inferior in regards to their anatomy when these facts do exist and need to be taken into consideration as well.”
“Is he still in bed? Do you think I can go over there?” Greg asked nervously: He had never been in the detective’s bedroom as he preferred to let that room stay closed for visitors.
It was approximately fifteen minutes later that Sherlock noticed he was feeling sort of funny. He was hot but the stickiness from the room and the people around him didn’t bother him as much as before. He felt a little drowsy, but also relaxed, his usually so stiff muscles didn’t feel stiff anymore and he was slouched on his chair in a very un-Sherlockian manner.
John’s eyes widened when he looked at the ground: the microscope from Scott and Samantha’s table had dropped to the floor, shattering into hundreds of pieces of glass and steel. It was a mess. Suddenly, it was eerily quiet in the room as everyone stared at the destroyed microscope.
As she raised an eyebrow at him skeptically, he hastened to explain Sherlock’s status to her: “He’s been drugged, probably with flunitrazepam, possibly Rohypnol. His heart rate is rather elevated. I think his blood pressure is a bit on the lower end and he’s on the verge of unconsciousness. He’s hot, and he is sweating. There’s a bite mark on his shoulder which needs tending to.”
Even if everything was quite hazy to him, he remembered waking up at some point in the night. He remembered feeling very hot. It had felt as if his whole body had been set aflame and he desperately wanted to peel off his sticky clothes, step into the shower and revel in the cooling relief the water offered. But then, the heat had transformed into a sudden chill, gripping him tight into its merciless arms, and he had changed his mind. The cold was much worse than the heat, chilling him to the bone, freezing him from the inside, and leaving him weak and immobile. Desperation took over him. It was unbearable.
Greg’s face was full of frustration, then it cleared up a bit when he said, “Maybe he should see a psychiatrist.” John raised his eyebrows skeptically. “No, no, it’s worth a try, he should talk about what happened to him, help him process it.”
The other man’s eyes shone with open excitement. He licked his lips as he stared at Sherlock’s mouth hungrily. He absently brushed his hand through Sherlock’s curls and tilted his head to the side as if he pondered something. Then he looked at his watch.
He hesitated when he took the first steps inside the house and waited for sounds. But there weren’t any which immediately caused John’s heart rate to pick up in concern. He had been prepared for shouting and loud quarreling from Sherlock and whatever poor bloke was assigned to look after him. Had something happened that there were no sounds whatsoever to come out of the flat?
He pulled and a pang of disappointment swept over him as he realized that the door was locked. He kept pulling and pushing at the handle like a madman as if it would make it open magically but nothing happened. He kept on pulling while the walls around him kept rumbling and the grey kept closing in on him. He didn’t care, he needed to know what was behind this door, even to the cost of his own sanity.
He nodded, relieved that he had an excuse to stay away a little longer, to catch up with his friends.
He didn’t seem to understand what was going on, where he was, but he was obviously scared and that alone broke John’s heart. To see the usually so confident and vibrant Sherlock in a state like that, so helpless, so fragile – it truly shook him to the core.
“Ah, yes, that one.” Mike wrinkled his nose a bit. “But it’s the middle of the week, do you really think it’s a good idea, John? We’ll be tired tomorrow, probably hungover, too.”
As he slowly got out of bed, careful not to wake Sherlock up – technically, he didn’t have to bother because Sherlock still wasn’t stirring – he slipped into the bathroom to wash the blood away from his hands. He had to scrub quite a bit because the blood was already encrusted into his skin but eventually most of it was gone. The bruises on his knuckles would stay with him for a while though, to remind him of the night that had turned composed, gentle John Watson into a raging, screaming madman.
Susanna’s father had tried to get to them the legal way, trying to get Watson charged with murder, and he had failed spectacularly. It seemed that Holmes and Watson had some high-level ties that made it possible for them to escape their just punishment.
“Hmmm.” Sherlock smiled, then he coughed violently, and John’s hand shot out at once, steading him by the shoulder. “Okay, that’s enough. Don’t speak. You need to save your energy.” His hand wandered to this face – his beautiful, almost ethereal face – and he stroked his cheekbone with his thumb.
“Alright, Mr. Holmes, your EEG showed no irregular brain activities, it seems you were very lucky with that kind of hit you took. The nurses tell me your vitals were fine as well. So if you want, you can go home. I assume Dr. Watson here will look after you, yes?”
“Are you okay?” the bloke asked and Sherlock was able to discover honest concern in his voice although it made his head hurt just to think about such things. He swayed a little more and then finally managed to really look at the other man.
He gestured towards the phone at the end of the corridor. “Just take the call, alright, John? You have five minutes.”
“That doesn’t have to mean anything, “Greg tried to calm him down, “maybe he hurt one of them, and he managed to escape.”
“Sherlock!” Mycroft’s arms shot forward around his waist to support him and for a few seconds, Sherlock leaned into him, letting him support his weight, because he was feeling light-headed and the room was spinning a little and
“Sherlock, is everything alright?” he asked in his usual acerbic tone, although there was a hint of concern underneath it.
Sherlock didn’t know. He wasn’t even really a hundred percent sure of John’s feelings, he still needed hard proof for those.
The moment passed. The young Alpha correctly answered the question, Magnussen went over to the next student and Sherlock sheepishly realized he had been holding his breath the whole time. His cheeks once again felt annoyingly hot and he took a deep breath, suppressing the urge to fan himself with his notebook.
“What?” John jolted awake at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. “What is it? Are you okay?” He was in doctor mode at once, ready to jump and help his friend with a new injury, or a nightmare, or whatever else was ailing him.
There weren’t any people they could ask if they had seen anything. The streets were dark and empty, and hopelessness crept into John’s heart. They’d never find him at this rate. London was huge, and they had probably disappeared into a cab or a car and driven off.
What a clever devil. Apparently, he had managed to cut John’s ropes at some point before they had been separated in the boat. He had absolutely no idea when he had done it, how, or with what knife. But he had done it, unbelievable genius that he was.
“Great. That’s just great.” Sherlock groaned, and he tried to raise his head, a mistake, he realized quickly. The pounding inside his head increased tenfold and vertigo got a brutal grip on him, blackness creeping in on the edges of his vision.
They had stopped at home to change into more comfortable clothes which meant a fresh brown lumberjack shirt for John as well as his beloved green jacket and a pale blue dress shirt and trousers for Sherlock. He couldn’t persuade his friend to leave his Belstaff at home for once. Well, he wouldn’t be Sherlock without that coat, would he? The scarf, too although it was only early autumn and quite mild outside.
John sighed. “I never said that. I said we can talk about it tomorrow. But let’s not argue about that right now. You really need to rest now, doctor’s orders. I’ll stay here, too.”
Greg noticed but thankfully, he didn’t say anything. He just left him space he knew his friend needed right now.
“You seem like you’re quite upset about it, “John Watson said slowly, his voice annoyingly calm. “Why?”
“Don’t blame yourself, Doctor Watson, “came the sudden unexpected reply. “Sherlock can be …. difficult to keep up with and even more difficult to look after. He has always been a stubborn brat who doesn’t see the danger until he’s already walked into it.”
“Oi, careful there.” A steady hand reached out, cupped his face, and lowered him back to the mattress. “You’re still weak, you mustn’t overdo it, Sherlock. Alright?”
The police officers were just handcuffing the guy against his car when John realized Sherlock hadn’t returned from Mrs. Hudson’s. He looked at his watch, as he seemed to have lost all sense of time and was shocked to see twenty minutes had already passed since Sherlock left.
Dimmock leaned forward, a hungry expression on his face. “Because you wanted to cause her pain. You wanted her to die in agony because she had threatened Sherlock. Isn’t that right?”
After a few more minutes, the wide doors of ICU opened and a tall young man in a doctor’s uniform approached him.
Slowly, he scooted closer and he raised a hand over Sherlock’s head where it hovered in the air, hesitatingly. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice him.
It was also extremely revealing, and he felt as if a piece of a puzzle had slid into its right place. Yet he still didn’t have the full picture.
Greg approached him with a curious look, but he didn’t say anything. He only raised his eyebrow at which John just shook his head, still stunned. With the same dazed expression on his face, he let himself be led back towards his cell. He sat back down on his cot, staring into empty space as he tried to sort his thoughts and emotions whirling around in his head.
As he watched Scott disappear into the dormitory marked ‘House Gilbert’, an angry curse slipped past his lips. His stomach churned, a knot twisting there with sudden anger - anger at himself for his unbelievable stupidity. In his frustration, he kicked a stone heatedly into the wall of the building next to him, a grunt-like noise of frustration leaving his throat, causing passing students to glance at him warily.
“So, I take it you don’t know this bloke?” Ben asked a little nervously. “I’m sorry, I thought he was his friend…”
He pulled out his phone to call Sherlock but of course, he didn’t answer. Then he called Greg to ask if he had heard from the detective, but he hadn’t heard from him – obviously, he had faked calling the Inspector in front of John.
“Sherlock?” he asked as he patted his cheek again. “Hey, Sherlock. I need you to wake up for me, love, just for a minute to drink some water and take your medicine, then you can go back to sleep again. Come on.”
“Well, it was worth a try, “Greg said, obviously trying to comfort him but John didn’t react. He was much too worried about Sherlock now, about what was happening right now.
Afterwards, John took a look at Sherlock’s shoulder. The wound still looked rather inflamed and he cleansed and changed the dressing with utmost care. Sherlock claimed that it didn’t hurt much but he didn’t believe him. Sherlock was a master of bearing physical pain, as well as concealing his pain in front of others, especially John.
But to both Sherlock’s and John’s shock and astonishment, Charles grinned. “Oh, yes, yes I did. I finally decided to do it, was tired of being a coward. Sliced them up nice and good. You would have been proud of me, Billy. I wish you’d have been there to see it. But I made pictures, wait a second.”
He had meddled with his relationships with women, so much that they had all left him. He had taken away John’s time, forced him to come to crime scenes with him when he could have spent his time dating, trying to find the right woman for him, start a family.
He gestured at the tray in the nurse’s hands, which was laden with a bowl of (to be honest) unappealing-looking porridge, two slices of half-toasted toast, a couple of slices of cheese, ham, and a small cup containing an undefinable kind of jam. There was also a green apple, a cup of hot water, and a small collection of different sorts of tea bags from which to choose.
to you but without your body, there’s no place for your incredibly stubborn brilliant mind to stay in, so what good would do that if you ended up losing it? Do you really know what could happen to you when ….”
“I would have known about the case even without the sirens, Lestrade and you know it, “came Sherlock’s cool comment from the background and both men rolled their eyes at each other. Of course, Sherlock was able to simultaneously disassemble the crime scene in front of him and be aware of the conversation around him, too. Hardly anything was missed by the young detective.
“What?!” Scott’s voice rose with anger. “But even if she were never able to breathe on her own again, she is still a human being. She would have been able to live a life, even if it would never have been the same.”
John’s insistence that he wasn’t gay and that he and Sherlock weren’t a couple was a little hurtful, true. But he was sure John didn’t intend to hurt him, it was just a sign of his suppressed homophobia and need to unsure his masculinity that made him repeat so often. It was fine, it didn’t mean anything.
He began CPR. Thirty compressions to the chest, two quick breaths into the cold, stiff mouth, back to the chest.
“Don’t you dare call him that! He’s not a freak, and he’s not a psychopath!” he yelled, triumphing inwardly when he saw a flicker of fear flash in Dimmock’s eyes as the man retreated from him, even though John was held back by Greg. “He’s a human being, like you and me, in fact, he’s even better than you could ever be, so just shut the fuck up!”
“Alright, alright, you don’t have to be mean about it, “Sherlock jumped in, ignoring Mrs. Hudson’s curious side look. “Everyone makes little mistakes from time to time, it doesn't mean anything.”
Opening the safe turned out to be disappointingly easy on the other hand. Apparently, it had been opened so frequently that he was able to pinpoint the combination just by looking at the worn-out tiny pressure keys. As he had suspected there was an impressive pile of documents within the safe, so he cautiously gathered it into his gloved hands, closed the door, and ducked behind the desk. He needed to scan through these documents, collect anything that might be important, and he had to do it quickly.
But then his eyes were drawn to the man’s crotch and he saw the obvious erection straining the man’s pants and without thinking he pounced upon him, a growl rising from deep within his throat.
No wonder he had pissed him off, probably ruining his chances of a romantic date or even just another friendly conversation forever.
“Are you alright?” the Professor asked in a surprisingly soft tone, his eyes looking Sherlock up and down subtly and Sherlock’s eyes widened further.
At once, John felt guilty for yelling at his friend in the state that he was in, but he pushed that guilt aside. Sherlock needed him now.
He blinked. He breathed. He turned onto his back again, but no matter what he did, he couldn’t find a comfortable position.
After what seemed like hours they stopped and settled down side by side, facing each other. They talked in hushed tones: about the best way to persuade Greg to bring Sherlock some cold case files, about Greg and Mycroft’s curious connection and about which side of the bed both of them preferred to sleep on (Sherlock preferred the window side, John the one closest to the door: a perfect match).
He brought his hands up to his mouth and blew into them as if he were blowing into a paper bag. He needed to calm down, it wouldn’t do anyone any good if he worked himself up like that in the face of potential danger. If Sherlock was right about this – and he usually was – he was about to confront people involved with human trafficking and murder. He had to have a clear head for that, and he needed to be calm.
John was back, putting a glass of water onto the bedside table, his brow furrowed as he took in the tense way Sherlock’s body was curled into itself, his grimace of pain as he tried to breathe through the pain.
This seemed to indicate that John had actually never been with another man. Somehow, this thought gave Sherlock relief: that John was as inexperienced in this matter as he was. Even if he had a notion of being in a relationship with someone, as well as the mechanics of sexual intercourse, he didn’t have any experience of being with another man, physically as well as otherwise.
“He’s just one of many talking shit about him.” Frustration and bitterness seeped out of John’s voice and Greg looked at him with surprise.
“I’ll let him do his thing here and then it’s back to Baker Street, “John whispered, addressing Greg while looking at Sherlock. “He promised me.” Greg gave him a skeptical look and John knew he had a point there. But he would press this, Sherlock was still in recovery, even if he didn’t want to admit it. John was especially concerned about the wound on his shoulder.
“Hey, “he said softly, as he sat down beside Sherlock lying on his side and tried to pull him towards him, onto his back. “Come here, love. I need to take your temperature.” He managed to position Sherlock so that he lay with his head on John’s thigh.
“I know it hurts, love, just bear with me, alright?” he said softly. He poured some water into the glass and raised it to Sherlock’s lips, together with the tablet of Ibuprofen.
“I don’t know if that’s true, “he said slowly, “but even if it was, you know better than to lash out at the friendly people taking care of you here, don’t you?” He looked at Sherlock trying to put on a disapproving face in spite of the corners of his mouth twitching upwards. He couldn’t help it, he was enjoying the moment too much. Although they were at a hospital because Sherlock had gotten hurt yet again, the detective was being his usual unnerving self, and it caused John’s stomach to flutter with happiness. He needed that now, a little normality. Something to remind him that someday, they would hopefully both be back at their old lives, with Sherlock bitching about everyone and everything around him and John apologizing for him and chiding him time and again when he went too far.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open again. “J-John?” He seemed very disorientated, his pupils blown wide and John was pretty sure he had a concussion from the blood seeping down from his hairline and the heavy lump he could feel on his head.
Sherlock didn’t react. It seemed he didn’t want to talk about the examination and John understood why. He felt honoured that his friend had wanted him to stay, that he needed him as a friend. But he also knew that it had been hard for him, to surrender his dignity – well, at least in his mind – and to let himself be subjected to this – again, in his mind – ridiculous examination. It meant a lot to John that Sherlock had been willing to let him be present for that, maybe it had even given him the strength to go through with it, he hoped so at least.
John swallowed the lump in his throat and squeezed Sherlock’s hand once again in silent reassurance.
John hid a grin in his sleeve as Sherlock’s eyes widened, a look of utter indignation and betrayal on his face. Even Myroft’s eyes twinkled mischievously, as the man’s lips pressed together. Luckily for him, that particular detail seemed to have evaded Sherlock’s usually so attentive eyes.
Sherlock shoved him a little, but playfully.  “Ah, you’re just jealous, because I was the one who thought of that white vest being the clue and you know it.”
He had met her a few years ago when he had been introduced to Susanna as a silent business partner. Never had he met a woman so ruthless and so inspiringly interesting like her. She had managed to spice up his rather boring business life and he had immensely enjoyed the first few months of their hot, messy affair which evolved into something surprisingly different. He rose high in the ranks at the same time that she did.  A business partnership in which both of them were equals, he respected her and she respected him. They maybe didn’t trust each other, but they valued and admired each other.
“We’re a little behind, thanks to the little test I had to perform on you. We will have to catch up next time. Make sure to read Chapter 2 and 3 of Gupta’s ‘Fundamentals of Toxicology”, I’ll be asking you questions on types and classification of toxicants and poisons, so make sure to be prepared. Alright, class dismissed.”
John looked at him and couldn’t quite suppress the chuckle escaping his mouth. “Come now, Sherlock, you know it’s a little early to chase after criminals. But maybe you would like to watch some fake criminal chasing on the telly with me?”
He had nearly fallen off the sofa, rumpled from sleeping in his clothes from yesterday. He was alarmed to see Sherlock standing over him, already dressed in a white dress shirt and black trousers, looking at him expectantly.
“Is he serious?” John murmured to Mike, momentarily forgetting the beautiful young man in the second row.
“Wait! “Sherlock hissed, this time grabbing the other man’s arm in earnest to stop him from leaving. The Alpha stopped in his tracks, staring at Sherlock’s hand on his arm and it made something in his chest sting with unfamiliar pain.
“Ah, “Sherlock mumbled, and he tried to say more, opened his mouth again to ask for help but found himself unable to form any words, let alone a coherent sentence. His tongue was thick and heavy as well as his jaw.
But to his dismay, he didn’t think of Tonya and her wet kisses as he went to bed that night. It was Scott Williams’ cupid-bow lips instead that filled his mind: the way they had tightened in surprise when John had addressed him, the way they had moved rapidly as he shot out his deductions of John's life at him, or how they had curled up in almost shy joy when John had called him ‘fantastic’ right after. He imagined the way they would feel underneath his own lips, imagined they must feel incredibly soft and sweet and that he would love to know how Scott would react if he pushed him against the wall while he roamed his mouth with his tongue. He imagined the alluring scent of almonds and apples spiking up at this display of dominance and he groaned as he tried to think of something else, something that would make the starting erection between his legs go away.
He sighed and resolutely shoved Sherlock’s taxing brother out of his head. He quickly took Sherlock’s blood pressure again which hadn’t changed, and he managed to get a few tiny sips of water into Sherlock until he began coughing without waking up.
“No, not at all.” Frederic looked chagrined as he shook his head. “He yelled at Mr. Holmes then, too, and he was working himself up so hard that I was scared he was giving himself a heart attack. Or a panic attack. But all of a sudden, all the fight left him, and he went quiet. Honestly, it was quite creepy. As if a switch had been turned off inside him. He hasn’t yelled at me afterward at all. In fact, he has been awfully quiet since then.”
“Are you serious? I told you to be careful!” Magnussen bellowed. “Do you know what a microscope like this costs? Are you all idiots? Who is responsible for this mess?”
There were the obligatory start-of-semester parties planned, a few of which John usually attended with his friends because he would never turn down the opportunity to indulge in some good old-fashioned dancing and drinking with his chums, no matter how diligent a student he aimed to be.
John nodded grimly as he strode up the street leading up to the building’s entrance, Greg falling in line next to him swiftly. “I’m pretty sure.”
“Ahh, dammit!” John yelled suddenly, causing Greg to flinch in surprise. “How could this have happened? God, why does this always happen to him?”
He snorted. Of course, Mycroft would put them under surveillance, this was his way of taking control of the situation. Only, what good would it do Sherlock now?
“I swear, Williams, “Magnussen said, his voice dangerously low now, “I’m really getting fed up with you and your inappropriate behaviour. If you think you can just step in here and wreak havoc as if..”
But he was fine now and there was no reason to delay their conversation any further. Maybe that was a good thing. Maybe not.
“I see.” Mycroft had a knowing look on his face, one that made a fresh burst of anger twist in his stomach, but he ignored it and concentrated on the screen in front of him without so much as a twitch in his face.
“Sir, can you hear me? “she asked as she took Sherlock’s pulse and checked his breathing while he was still in John’s arms. “Can you tell me your name?” She shone a penlight into his eyes.
“Oh no, Sherlock, no.” Sherlock was still right next to him, his body hot and flush against John’s but now he wasn’t clinging to him anymore. Instead, he was trying to get away from John, his hands pushing at John’s chest, his legs kicking frantically against John’s. His eyes were wide open, but he didn’t seem to know where he was as he was desperately trying to get away and John suspected that he had just opened his eyes and wasn’t really awake yet.
It was a little disconcerting, to say the least, to see this kid react that strongly to just one simple unheralded touch. John was worried but he saw that it was better not to approach that topic right now.
Luckily, the bullet hit the ground between him and Greg, and a second after, Greg pulled up his gun and shot the now visible man standing in the doorway right in the shoulder. With a pained grunt, the man collapsed onto his knees, clutching his wounded shoulder.
But just as he was about to press the call button after dialling 999, he stopped himself. Sherlock had begged him not to admit him to the hospital again. Thoughts of Sherlock having a panic attack at the sight of paramedics entered his mind. Images of Sherlock in a hospital bed, crying and lashing out in frustration or even fear, maybe even having to be restrained to the bed, appeared before his inner eye, and his fingers shifted away from his phone.
“Yes, “he said into his phone. “I need you for a job. Not right now, no, we need to lay low for a little while. Could you be here by New Year’s? Give or take a few days. Yeah, great. And bring your tools, we’ll need them.”
John shook his head. “No, I don’t think that’s very likely. Sherlock wouldn’t just let himself be taken away by a stranger, no way. He wouldn’t let himself be “half-carried” by someone he doesn’t know.”
Panic suddenly rising within him, John drew a sharp breath and leaned forward. “Sherlock,“ he began, and Sherlock looked at him in startled surprise.
“John, it’s cold, “Sherlock finally said against his chest and John nodded. He turned off the shower and positioned Sherlock against the edge of the bathtub, asking him to wait a second. Then he got out and held open the huge fluffy towel he had laid out beforehand. With a trembling hand on John’s good shoulder, Sherlock managed to get out of the tub by himself and he closed his eyes gratefully when John gently wrapped the towel around his pale, shivering body.
He dug his heels into the ground at once. “N-no, “he said but his voice was failing him again already.
He dove down deeper until he reached the bottom of the Thames. He swam into what he thought was North – where Billy must have thrown Sherlock into the water. There was a slight current of course, which would have caused him to float to …. the West.
John nodded curtly and sat down on the sofa again. God, he didn’t really need Mycroft around him now. He had enough troubles as it is.
He spent Sunday afternoon trying to prepare for Magnussen’s class, knowing they would be tested as Magnussen had promised. He needed to be prepared, but instead of focussing on his textbook, he found himself thinking of Scott again and how he could apologize to him. After a whole two hours of fussing over the right words, he pounced on Mike, begging him to ask him some mock questions for the class, so that he would stop going crazy over the whole Scott issue. Mike drilled him strictly, making it impossible to think about anything else, and when John went to bed that night, he knew that he was well prepared, feeling immensely thankful for his best friend’s help.
“Yes? You’re really making me nervous here, John, “Sherlock said, his voice rising with anxiousness.
“Right.” Mike smiled in relief, clearly appreciating that John seemed so unconcerned in the face of Professor Magnussen’s daunting sermon. John in turn was glad that he could ease his friend’s mind so easily. They had each other’s backs, as always.
Sherlock glanced at him, insecurity flitting across his face as he bit his bottom lip and looked back down again. He looked to the side for a few seconds, then back up again, directly at John.
“I don’t care, it’s over. Mycroft can take care of him if he likes, you know he can do that. So why force me to do this ridiculous examination if I don’t want it and it’s not necessary? I won’t do it!”
He reached out and cautiously laid an arm around Sherlock’s waist. The urge to pull Sherlock flush against his chest was overwhelming. The concept of them sleeping together with him protectively spooning Sherlock from behind seemed awfully enticing to him, but he kept himself in check and maintained the open space between them, their bodies only connected by John’s arm around Sherlock’s middle.
“Yeah, it’s me, you daft git, “he murmured as he scooted nearer to Sherlock and pulled him into a tight embrace. “Calm down, it’s just me.” Sherlock trembled against him and he closed his eyes again. They lay there for a considerate amount of time, in which they both seemed comfortable drawing comfort from being near each other.
John’s kind and gentle face, a concerned look marking its handsome features, as he talked to him, pressed him to his warm, beautiful body. He couldn’t remember what he had said, but did it matter?
The heat in his face and also creeping down his lower body was suggesting yes, but Sherlock was still overwhelmed by his deduction of John’s feelings. Maybe he was just reacting to what he thought were John’s true feelings towards him, eager to accommodate his best friend, after everything he had done for him?
“Shhh, it’s okay, “John tried to soothe him, as he lowered them down to the bottom of the tub and laid back against the tiles, positioning Sherlock between his legs, “it’s just water, calm down. We need to get your fever down.”
John blinked. Yes, of course, he should examine Sherlock, take a look at his injuries. The need to comfort his friend had been greater than the need to be a doctor.
Maybe it sounded a little corny, but John appreciated being so in tune with his best friend. They didn’t even need many words, they just understood each other. It was as simple as that. When Sherlock was in danger somewhere, being threatened by mad serial killers or dangerous naked women John somehow knew, and Sherlock knew when John was in peril vice versa.
“No, no, why would you think that?” he asked when he realized that he had been staring, appalled. “Because you are beautiful, you idiot!”
He was torn between the stubborn decision to ignore Scott and his childish ways and the desperate wish to get to know the beautiful Beta, despite all these unlucky, uncomfortable encounters the two of them already had gone through.
John just accepted this too and made himself comfortable. With his now filled stomach and his very comfortable pillows, he felt quite sated. Physically at least. But he still needed some answers, so he returned to his thoughts.
The water washed all the exhaustion and tension down the drain, leaving him stronger and refreshed, if not still a little shaking in the knees, forcing him to hold on to the wall for support.
He cradled Sherlock’s head in his lap and patted Sherlock’s cheek softly. “Sherlock? Can you hear me? Wake up, please.” No reaction. He felt his forehead and found it a bit warm. He was breathing normally though.
Blue-green eyes pierced into his as if searching for the honesty in his statement. John was careful not to let his eyes drop and his throat tightened as he met the other man’s curious gaze, something entirely obscure and indiscernible in them.
“Y-yes, of course, “he said quickly. “It’s just a little strange … to be able to be here right now, you know?”
Sherlock simply nodded and with another skeptical look in John’s direction the doctor left. The nurse tried to coax Sherlock into the hospital gown again and this time he accepted it, albeit reluctantly.
“There you go, “John said, as he finally sat down and poured the tea into Sherlock’s cup. Sherlock seemed entranced by the pouring and John tried to focus on what he was doing instead of outright staring at the dazzling creature right in front of him.
Being called by the wrong name in this situation irritated Sherlock even further, but he ignored it.
John’s frustration flashed up again and he went to bed early, deciding that he would go to a party the next day to have some fun. He would ask Tonya if she’d liked to go, too. He would not let one single, arrogant bloke ruin his whole semester.
Sherlock’s tremors decreased until they were suddenly gone completely. Sherlock sighed in content and nuzzled into the collar of John’s shirt as he finally relaxed and once again fell asleep. A wave of tenderness washed over John as he held the sleeping feverish man in his arms, and he felt as if nothing in the world could persuade him to let go of him now. He was holding the most precious thing in his arms and he would protect him from whatever wanted to harm him. Or whoever.
Suddenly, a wave of despair washed over him and threatened to take him down. He felt himself choking and he tried not to panic. To stop himself from doing that, he jumped off the couch and hurried off into the bathroom. Bending over the sink, he splashed cold water into his face and that seemed to help a little. He stood there with his face resting on his arm splayed over the sink, trying to breathe steadily.
There was anger, of course, most of all because of all the brazen insults hurled at him by his arrogant tosser of a flatmate. His mind was dreadfully simple,
Greg shrugged helplessly. “Honestly, I don’t know. But I have put many a man into the detention cell, only to release him 24 hours later. If you’re lucky that’s what’ll happen with you too.”
Greg had a point there. There were no lights on, so apparently, none of the employees or managers working here was still around. That didn’t have to mean Sherlock wasn’t here, though.
Scott met Magnussen’s eyes with remarkable composure, showing absolutely no reaction to his words on his face. Magnussen’s smile widened before it vanished, and the man’s gaze left the young student.
“You’re supposed to be a bloody genius but all I see is an idiot who doesn’t know when to shut the fuck up!”
While there had been some attraction between them on the dancefloor, he found himself getting less and less interested the longer she was talking. She was chattering on and on about her studies and her wealthy parents and even the last boyfriend she had, captain of the football team, that at some point he just lost focus.
Silence. John expected Mycroft to get angry at him now, to raise his voice and tell him he was a bad friend and he should be ashamed of himself for failing Sherlock so. It would have been understandable. He knew how much Mycroft cared for his little brother even if he wouldn’t admit it openly and if something really bad had happened to him, Mycroft would have hunted him down and skinned him alive, he was certain.
“No, I mean it, “Sherlock interrupted, now fully back in power mode. “I really don’t appreciate you molesting me so let’s just forget about that and get on with our evening, alright?” He looked at Jack expectantly and as the other stared at him in amazement he grinned a little, glad he was back to himself again. “Okay, you’re alright with it, I’ve just answered the question for you. Now buzz off, I can’t stand to look at you anymore. In fact, you’re making me sick.”
There were dozens of pictures and all of them were of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. Sherlock Holmes leaving Bart’s Hospital with another tall, elegant man, getting into a limousine. Doctor Watson also leaving the hospital, getting into a police car with what seemed a police officer in civilian clothes. Holmes and the other man getting out of the car at Baker Street. Holmes being ushered into the apartment by the other man, a weary, exhausted expression on his face. Watson, one day later, approaching 221B Baker Street in a cab, the same weary look on his face.
Greg truly looked sorry and John shook his head. “Don’t apologize, Greg. I know you’re on my side.” He locked eyes with his friend. “I’m really thankful, you know? I know this must be hard for you, too.”
He turned in surprise and saw a young sturdy man with short blonde hair look at him from the kitchen. John raised an eyebrow and the man beckoned him to join him with a silent wave of his hand. With one quick look back to Sherlock – he still hadn’t moved – John went over to the kitchen and quietly sat down at the chair, opposite of the young stranger who was eyeing him curiously.
John looked at him in disbelief. “You’re not even studying medicine? So, why are you taking this course then?”
“That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?” He smiled in triumph and John stared at him wide-eyed and slack-jawed.
John smiled despite himself. “I should be. But considering the circumstances, I think I forgive you. We’ll have to talk about your coping mechanisms though, but that can wait for later.”
“You’re quite beautiful when you laugh like that, “the man whispered into his ear, leaning forward, even more, to be able to do so. “I like it.”
But then he recognized the familiar form of his best friend. He was hunched into the corner of the couch, curled into himself, unmoving. He was dressed in a maroon dressing gown hanging loosely around his pale features, around his legs drawn up to his chest, his arms wrapped around them. His eyes were closed. It was obvious he wasn’t asleep but somewhere deep inside his mind palace.
“Oh, stop that nonsense, Mycroft! You’re only interested in me because of the work I do for you and the stupid British government! That’s all, so stop that pseudo-sentimental crap!”
“I really mean. it. I accept your rule. I don’t understand it but I accept that you don’t want to date and that you don’t want to explain yourself. I’m sure you have your reasons. Whatever it is, it’s your decision, and I accept that.”
“J-John, I- I cannt, I juscannnt….” The words out of Sherlock's mouth slurred so badly he could hardly comprehend them. The drug in his system was taking its effect on him more clearly now.
But there was no need to rush things. After a few dances they decided to get some drinks and this time, he went for a vodka tonic instead of a beer. As of yet, the alcohol had almost no effect on him and he felt he needed to speed things up a little. He and Tonya were having fun, but he wasn’t completely in the mood for a tumble in the sheets yet, and getting smashed was a sure way to change that. Mike would not be happy but he would surely understand if John explained it to him later.
“John.” Scott’s voice was hard but John’s inner Alpha preened with joy when he heard the Beta say his name. “Just leave, I can handle this.”
“But your parents were not like that?” he asked quickly to divert her attention back to something less uncomfortable.
“Fine, “he said through gritted teeth. And that was all that needed to be said, the matter was done. Mycroft nodded and they stepped away from each other again, the tension in the room dispersing again.
“But that’s just it, John,” Sherlock said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I feel the same thing.”
The man stopped in his tracks and leaned down to push his face right into Sherlock’s while he still supported his weight on his arms and shoulder. “Ah, now you remember me, huh? Took you a while. What, you’re not feeling alright? Pity.”
He liked Frederic. He seemed a little talkative and also somewhat carefree – something he wouldn’t have deemed possible in staff chosen by Mycroft. But he knew he must be very intelligent as well as professional, or else he wouldn’t have been hired by the strict government man. He cleared his voice and met Frederic’s eyes.
While absently listening to Magnussen carry on about the paper due at the end of the semester, his eyes started to wander around the room. He noticed two large guys sitting slightly more to the left in the row in front of them, both of them probably Alphas. Their heads were stuck together as they whispered to each other, snickering quietly, momentarily unnoticed by Magnussen who was turned towards the other side of the room. John could see one of them pointing at something in front of him: it was a porn magazine, bold red letters announcing ‘Obedient Omega Sluts’ and there was a blur of naked bodies writhing underneath. John rolled his eyes and turned away in disgust. Those were exactly the kind of people he didn’t need to socialise with.
So, no he didn’t think Sherlock had ever had any sexual experience which was quite sad even for him. And then to have him have his first sexual encounter – well, probably – turn out like this, being assaulted, being almost raped – it was simply awful and would probably ruin the man’s chances of ever engaging in a healthy, intimate relationship with someone.
Sherlock didn’t cry but he clung to John like a scared child and John wouldn’t let go of him now unless the world ended. The warmth of Sherlock’s hot breath against his shoulder tickled the edge of his face, making his skin tingle. The thin but wiry body felt warm against his own and he frowned when he realised how his heart was jackrabbiting inside his chest.
Sherlock’s hands trembled in his and his eyes searched John's intensely as if trying to find some answers in them.
Greg cheered even louder but John stood up and leaned into Sherlock’s space cautiously. “Are you alright, Sherlock?” he shouted into his ear. “You never admit when you’re tired, so….” And he looked at Sherlock with his typical worried doctor-face, all the laughter gone from his face. Sherlock’s heart warmed at once and he nodded quickly, a simple motion which made him a little dizzy somehow.
“Please, John, please!” Sherlock’s whole body was trembling, and he was breathing heavily as he wearily laid his head onto the mattress while keeping John in his vision. As if he was expecting him to pounce on him to drag him away. In his weakened state, he wasn’t strong enough to fight John off and they both knew it, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t plead with him to stave off the unavoidable.
Good news though: I've already written the last two chapters of this story. They only need to be edited, I hope I can post them within the next week.
“Right you are, “his mates said unanimously, and John shook his head, crestfallen in his shame. He pulled out his phone and his heart shrunk when he saw that Tonya had texted him, half an hour ago.
“Is Sherlock with you? Has he been here?” He just couldn’t keep the anxiousness out of his voice, and he was already upsetting Mrs. Hudson, he saw it in her face.
“What’s your problem? You think you’re too good for me?” He asked angrily as he made another step towards Sherlock.
But Sherlock wouldn’t calm down and fresh tears flowed from his eyes as he tried to shield himself from being touched.
John was nervous, but he saw that Sherlock was nervous too, and it made him feel a little bit better. As they were eating their lunch, glancing at each other randomly between forkfuls of food, they both knew they were about to have a serious conversation, and it created a kind of nervous tension between them.
He hated feeling helpless over anything else. It was the worst feeling of all and he had always had a problem dealing with it properly.
“The most commonly used pyrethroid synergist, what is it?” Magnussen asked as his eyes pierced into John. His eyebrow twitched when John just glared at him, his anger visible on his face for everybody to see, clear as day. Magnussen scoffed and his eyes twinkled, seemingly amused by John’s blatant display of emotions in the face of his teacher. When he opened his mouth to dismiss him just like the other guy, John interceded quickly.
Unfortunately, the doctors seemed to have started ward round at the very end of the hospital. After a while, John tried to distract himself by taking a quick shower, brushing his teeth. Sherlock was still connected to the EEG and thus was stuck in his bed which annoyed him endlessly. John took pity on him and brought him one of the fresh toothbrushes from the bathroom and an empty cup that he could at least brush his teeth with. Afterwards it was back to watching telly again. It was almost 10 o’clock when Sherlock suddenly jumped from the bed, ripping off the electrodes connected to his head, throwing them onto the bed with violent fury.
“Is that so?” Jack grinned even more, and Sherlock felt disgusted by that slimy leer, the physical attractiveness of the other man fading away in this pathetic display of male arrogance. He couldn’t help flinching when Jack closed his eyes and leaned a little forward to inhale Sherlock’s scent like a total creep. “Hmmm, you smell good, handsome, very inviting.” He opened his eyes again and nudged his nose against Sherlock’s cheek, his breath hot against his skin. “And these cheekbones, God, you’re sexy.”
John’s eyes widened in realization and he changed course as he kicked his feet to swim quicker. After a few wide strokes, he finally recognized a dark shape in front of him. It was a body, completely still, the dark coat floating around his body eerily, like the wings of an angel, but without any energy or life within them.
Sherlock did not seem surprised at John’s quiet agreement. He seemed thankful for John’s hesitancy to start their conversation, apparently giving him time to sort out his own thoughts.
He stopped himself for a few seconds, taking another deep breath, as he was getting more and more agitated by the second.
Isn't it glorious when the boys are fighting? I just love to make them fight, there's so much unresolved tension in the air :)
His eyes travelled rapidly from the big brown Chesterfield sofa to the shelves full of knick-knacks and the occasional book. There were exactly fifty tiny figurines of naked women collected on one particular high shelf – that seemed a little odd although of course, he was on the premises of an escort agency. Every statue was different, they varied in body type, skin colour, measurements. It took him precisely three seconds to make a decision – the room had given him all the information he needed. He took one figurine into his hand – a petite, Asian woman – and studied it.
What had he been thinking? He wasn’t usually like this, he was no stupid Alpha macho. He usually respected people’s boundaries and he really didn’t know what had come over him to behave towards Scott like that.
“Sherlock, “he said with a heavy sigh, “everyone is only trying to help you, don’t you realize that?”
No, it turned easily and he exhaled in relief. Cautiously, he opened the door, half-expecting the blinding white light to make a re-appearance. He was wrong again.
He shook his head as if to rid himself of the unexpected stream of thoughts coursing through his mind and he picked up the pace scanning through the notes, disposing of the useless ones effectively.
Well, there was one thing …. He could contact a certain someone who had the power and the means to really look for a missing person. But John hesitated, shaking his head as he crossed a road and jogged down another street. No, he would wait for now, he wanted to make sure himself that Sherlock wasn’t in the area then he could still contact Mycroft.
Sherlock acquiesced and made his way to the couch without any fuss. He curled up into the corner of the sofa and drew up his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them as he silently watched John make the tea.
Just as he had figured that out a bloodcurdling scream filled the air. John flinched so hard, he nearly collapsed on the spot from terror. He looked and saw what made his best friend scream like that: His attacker was biting him. He was biting him into the shoulder
And who knew what Sherlock wanted to talk to him about? Because Sherlock had tried to start a conversation a couple of times now, which proved that he had something important to say as well. But John had always stopped him, mostly because Sherlock had still been weak and needed to rest more.
Sherlock shifted nearer and John’s heart pounded in his throat. He closed his eyes as Sherlock closed his. He felt hot breath against his mouth and then the descent of warm, plush lips against his.
John run off without thinking. Greg thanked the men and ran after John while he quickly called his colleagues to order them to their location.
Christ, he should apologize. He didn’t know how he could have just forgotten about her. He had come here with the intention of getting drunk, getting laid...well, that hadn’t exactly happened.
He frowned when he realized the bright light wasn’t going away. Frustrated, he slammed the door shut and opened the second room, only to be greeted yet again by the blinding light.
Sherlock took a deep breath and then started rattling down everything he remembered in a clinical voice, while his eyes were fixated on a spot on the wall behind the nurse. “He kissed me, and he sucked at my neck, I think. He bit my lip. He stroked me under my shirt, and he also touched my bottom. I think he scratched me, my hips, I think, and he slapped my face a couple of times.  He pulled my hair. He bit me into the shoulder. I think that’s everything. At least as I can recall.”
John raised his hands dramatically in his defense. “Oh, I’m sorry if I offended you, Sir, please forgive me.” He grinned at Sherlock who grinned back after a few seconds, and warmth spread out in John’s chest once again. It felt nice.
For one split second, John could only gape at the empty space where Sherlock had just sat a second ago, the horrible sound of the splash of water still ringing in his ears.
“Leave me be, “he said calmly as he dared the other to make another move with narrowed eyes. “I don’t want you to touch me like this. I’d like to go back inside.”
“You’re making quite a lot of noise, everyone on this floor can hear you.” His tone was full of disapproval.
If he was honest he wasn’t too keen on dancing. Well, not with Sarah anyhow. He knew she had had a crush on him since they had first met in a seminar on genetics in their second semester a year ago. They had been lab partners which meant that they had spent quite a lot of time together. It had soon become apparent that she was interested in him and she had always tried to get him interested in her as well - unfortunately for her, without any luck. She was a nice, pretty Beta girl, but she was kind of boring and they didn’t seem to have any common interests. He had tried to convey to her that he only wanted to be friends without hurting her feelings but he mustn’t have been clear enough for she still tried to get him to ask her on a date.
He followed Greg into another room and allowed them to take his fingerprints without making a fuss. Somewhere in the back of his head, he was aware of Greg’s increasing concern, but he was too tired to explain or to make an effort to seem better.
“Come on, let’s get you back to bed, “John said, and Sherlock nodded. He looked dead tired and ill, but his eyes were clear now and he was lucid.
A deep sigh left his body, and he clenched his jaw shut, determined not to break down now. He had nothing to do now but wait. Let others decide his fate. There was something mystifyingly deliberating about this. He had no say as to what happened to him now. He couldn’t do anything to change what was going to happen. So he resigned himself to his fate and began his task for the next few hours: waiting.
The mattress dipped as John got off the bed and Sherlock grit his teeth as the pain stubbornly persisted to torment his brain. He was dimly aware of the sweat clinging to the damp skin of his face and for a moment, he felt overwhelmed by disgust. He would try and get into the shower as soon as possible, although he realized that John might forbid him to do so, his overprotective nature taking over, like always when Sherlock was in a less than agreeable condition. He would probably be forced to apply his most persuasive techniques to get what he wanted.
“Sherlock, “John reached out, still desperate to touch his friend, but Sherlock raised his hand to stop him.
John admittedly was very curious about all that. He was very curious about his knot, especially. Being an Alpha, it was a natural part of his anatomy. But he had never used it, never even seen it, being with a Beta. Betas weren’t made for taking a knot, and so he had no idea what it felt like. He was incredibly curious and was dying for a chance to get proof for the legendary tales that were spread around or if it was just some hogwash, one of the many myths that got scattered around because people thought it made them look cool.
Sherlock was still struggling, however. Apparently, the long hours in his mind palace made it hard for him to find his way back into reality.
“Go to sleep, “he said gently as he clasped Sherlock’s shoulder. Now that Sherlock was awake and lucid, it was much harder to maintain the physical intimacy they had shared tonight until now. John knew that Sherlock had not really been awake and had only sought physical comfort because of his weakened state. But he tried to stick to the illusion that it was John’s comfort in particular that Sherlock had needed. His body warmth, his strong arms, his careful embrace – no one else’s would have been good enough.
Sherlock seemed to think about it for a moment and John knew exactly what was going on his head. If Sherlock told John a too high number, he would probably not be released today. If he lied, though, John would see right through him – Sherlock was a terrible liar, at least in John’s eyes – and he would probably make him stay here just out of principle.
It was that bloke from before. He didn’t remember his name anymore, but it was that bloke who had cornered him outside the pub.
“Come now, brother mine, “he said as he pointed towards the stairs, “better not to make her wait, then.”
“Yes?” John Watson asked, raising one eyebrow expectantly. He kept his body only half-turned towards Sherlock, glancing at him in an almost bored manner as if it was of no great importance to him that he was being held up by the younger student out of the blue.
He nodded at Greg and gratefully accepted the cup of coffee from him. Coffee was a little more suitable for him now than tea, for he could surely use that extra caffeine boost for the day that was ahead of him.
John stared at him. “Well, I’d rather make sure myself. “He ignored Sherlock’s groan of exasperation and grabbed his wrist to take his pulse, then he went on to touch his forehead.
Greg nodded grimly. The Inspector knew Sherlock’s tendency to run into trouble better than anybody. He had seen Sherlock ignoring danger first-hand, chasing after criminals without thinking, even provoking them although they were armed. He had seen him get hurt because of that but somehow that never seemed to deter the man from doing it all over again. But this time was a little different. Sherlock was behaving like always, but him having been sexually attacked just two days before, that was a new one. Sherlock was bound to be even more of an unpredictable explosive than usual.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, they are difficult, they are tedious. So what? Just deal with them, you know how. No, I don’t care if it’s messy, just get yourself some help then.”
Bewildered, John handed Greg’s phone to the woman and looked on as she answered the call. “Yes, hello …. well I couldn’t examine him completely, …. Yes, he seems relatively stable, …. yes, it’s possible, I guess …. well, okay then.” She got off the phone, handed it back to Greg, and looked at John with open frustration.
John didn’t know what tomorrow would bring. He didn’t know if they wouldn’t be facing further troubles come tomorrow. But right this moment, he didn’t care. He had Sherlock Holmes in his arms.
The bodies were always left behind in the same manner: the women’s tongues were cut out, and their throats ripped into bloody shreds, the men’s arms and feet were cut off, lying next to the bled-out torsi in neat little slices. What had been particularly strange about the crime scenes, were the candy wrappers left behind on the victims. They were always of the same brand, there was never any DNA on them. Sherlock had been beyond excited and had thrown himself into the mystery behind the killings, pouncing onto significant cues like a bloodhound in a frenzy.
“Well, well, so here we are, “Billy Dickson suddenly said and both brothers stopped rowing. “This is the place. You’re going to tell us now what the police know about us. Or you’re gonna die.”
John simply nodded and got into the ambulance. His mind couldn’t focus on thanking his friend. He just wanted to be at Sherlock’s side again. He couldn’t bear to be away from him for just one second, so he quickly took a seat beside Sherlock’s stretcher and grabbed his hand again.
A low groan escaped his mouth as Sherlock’s shocked face appeared in front of his inner eye, the hurt at John’s words open in those green-blue eyes brimming with tears. Just the simple memory of it caused a twisted ache in his chest that was almost unbearable.
Sherlock did not and John was thankful for small mercies. Maybe they could still salvage this. Maybe Sherlock could do something with this new information at hand. Maybe they weren’t as lost as Sherlock’s panicked expression on his face a few moments ago had suggested.
Well, they were unaware of his involvement. They wouldn’t even know what was happening to them until it would be too late.
His body fell into the routine like a machine remembering its programming. He had done this so many times. This was what he knew, this was what he could do best. Saving lives. Saving people.
“Let me.” Greg gently shoved him aside and made quick work of the lock with a paper clip from his jacket.
John took a few, quick strides forward and practically fell into the grass next to his friend. At once, he put a shaky hand on Sherlock’s head, cupping his face tenderly as he anxiously tried to avoid hurting him any further.
Greg appeared with a generous breakfast of omelet, bacon and eggs, and scones with strawberry jam. He didn’t say anything as he handed John the tray, but his raised eyebrows and slight smirk around his upturned lips said everything.
Every student singled out by Magnussen managed to answer his questions correctly. Which was no surprise, regarding the fact that almost half the class participants had not shown up again today after the professor’s off-putting performance last week. All the remaining students were either forced to stay because they had no alternatives or they were as determined and ambitious as John and Mike were. John suspected that all of the students present had spent their Sunday studying for this class in order to pass this rigorous questioning. He hoped that the professor would not make a habit of doing that every week. He had other classes too, and couldn’t afford to spend all his precious time studying just for ‘Advanced Toxicology’.
“No, Sherlock, “John said, and he squeezed his friend’s shoulder in compassion, “you’re not drunk anymore. You never really were.”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, desperate to chase the unwelcome images and that man’s voice away from his mind.
So, as I said, I'm planning on writing a sequel for this. Please forgive me for the indulgence of the mustache-twirling villain in the epilogue, I just couldn't resist 😉
Back at the flat, Sherlock was still pouting. He let John fuss about him, check his shoulder, clean and bandage it once again without any complaint but as soon as John was finished he retreated onto the couch with his laptop, probably already planning to contact Lestrade.
Sherlock looked up from his lower position on their table – his head felt really heavy - and saw Greg leaning forward to look at him with a twinkle in his eye, but also a curious face as if he was looking at a peculiar species at the zoo instead of simply a drunk man.
And he nibbled at Sherlock’s ear at the same time that Sherlock could feel something hard pressing against his shirt’s fabric over his stomach. Pressing against his navel and that’s when Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore.
“Fuck”, Sherlock cursed again as he stopped abruptly in the middle of the path to the next building. He ran a hand through his unruly curls, biting on his lips to prevent further cussing. He was feeling somewhat hot, his nausea simply refused to abate and he longed to simply go to his room, crawl underneath his covers and tune out the rest of the world.
“Well, I guess, “he said, trying to sound neutral. He beckoned to Mycroft to follow him and quietly they walked over to Sherlock’s bedroom. John opened the door slowly and his heart ached all over again when he saw Sherlock lying completely still in his bed on his back, his chest rising steadily up and down in his sleep. Mrs. Hudson was just patting his forehead with a fresh wet cloth and he could see her hands were trembling. She was obviously distressed.
He sighed wearily and resigned himself to a night without any sleep when steps approached his cell, and someone cleared his voice behind him. He didn’t get up or turned around, just raised his head a little to indicate he was awake.
John’s eyes flew open as the desperate cries next to him finally registered with him. With a start, he raised himself, all his senses on high alert, his body ready to attack any unwelcome intruders. Then he realized what had happened.
“Why did you do that?” Sherlock blurted out, the impatience within him taking over, as he simply couldn’t contain himself anymore. Having to keep quiet back within the confines of the lab had been hard enough and he had bitten his tongue, forcing his restless legs to calm down as he had waited anxiously for the class to end. He needed to know the reason for John Watson doing what he had done. He needed to know now.
“Tell you what?” he said suddenly. “I know a certain Scottish lullaby. My mother used to sing it to me when I was still a little boy and I couldn’t sleep.”
“It’s at 38.4°. Still a little too high for my taste. But it’s dropped quite a bit which is good. I hope that when you’ve rested some more, the fever will have broken completely.”
John’s mouth went dry as he kept watching the student on the other side of the room, completely mesmerized by his angelic features, the Professor’s words only a blurry voice somewhere far far away.
“I heard what you said, “John interrupted and Scott’s eyes widened. “But there hasn’t been an explanation, and in this case, I am unwilling to accept it.”
A warm hand was placed on his shoulder. “He’s lucky to have you, John, “Greg said, squeezing lightly, you‘re a good friend.”
“Ts ts, don’t do that.” He lifted Sherlock’s head up from the pavement with the left hand and stroked over his freshly bruised cheek with his right thumb. “Don’t ruin your beautiful face, “he mumbled, leaning forward a little more and now his lips were only inches away from Sherlock’s face. “I still need it.”
“Hey,” he said as he put on what he hoped was a bright smile that would relax the other bloke. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to work. In fact, it seemed to make him even more suspicious as his expression darkened even further, his mouth tightening impatiently in ever-growing disapproval.
Because Sherlock was an extremely clever and intelligent man: he could solve the hardest puzzles, defeat renowned professors and Nobel Prize-winning scientists in academic debates, but this was where he had reached his limit: he was utterly inexperienced when it came to human relationships, especially the intimate ones, the ones that involved love.
He smiled to himself at the thought of his friend’s innocent belief that he had only left to get a pillow. It had been a little mean to trick him like that, but he just hadn’t been able to stay at home any longer while there was a moderately exciting case to solve out there. He just hoped John would not be too worked up about this, he could be quite tiresome when he was angry with Sherlock. Sometimes he wouldn’t even drink tea with him on those occasions, a fact that had resulted in him apologizing to John just so he would speak with him again.
“Great!” he exclaimed, rubbing his hands together. “I’m glad to see you all seem to possess a solid knowledge in this area. Let’s apply this knowledge about Omega physiology to the knowledge we have about toxicants and the effects they can have on the human body. I have here a few photos for you to give you a first impression. I’d warn you that this is not for the weak-minded but all of you aim to be doctors or at least something in that area, so I expect you to have no problems looking at these.”
John blushed as he realized both Sherlock and the young nurse were staring at him. He really was a bloody idiot, it seemed.
John wanted to scream with frustration when suddenly his phone rang. He chose to ignore it. He had to convince that woman he would take Sherlock home, he wouldn’t let him wake up in a sterile hospital, in that vulnerable state he was in right now.
Sherlock felt anger rising within him. What was this man’s problem? Why couldn’t he just stand outside for a minute and catch a whiff of fresh air without being disturbed by some random arsehole?
On the other hand, he was hardly to blame, was he? He shook his head almost indiscernibly, as he stepped out of the shower and quickly toweled himself dry, wrapping the towel around his hips perfunctorily.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes had always been a very isolated person - a fact that most of the times he had absolutely no issues with. Since he had started studying at Durham, he had begrudgingly met most of the obligatory social expectations a student his age had to deal with by nature: making small talk during seminars or at the cafeteria when being addressed by unnecessarily friendly students. Meeting up with other people to prepare a group presentation, engaging in tedious discussions with individuals who were much less committed to the subject matter than him, not to mention much less talented, resulting in him doing most of the work.
“But … I thought that …” Sherlock stammered a little and wasn’t that a rare thing to behold? “I thought that … there was no way you’d be released.”
“24 hours?” he repeated incredulously. “No, I cannot stay that long! I have to get back home, I need to take care of Sherlock!”
“Oh, you just seemed so….I don’t know.” The Professor’s cold eyes bored into Sherlock’s green ones as he gestured at his body with a wave of his hand. “Lost and helpless. Sitting there like that, all by yourself. So I couldn’t just walk past you.”
Mike grinned at him with an eager nod, and John chuckled fondly. He knew that Mike wasn’t really angry with him. The Beta was a kind, gentle creature who wouldn’t hurt a fly. They had met on their very first day at Uni, both of them nervous but ambitious, and they had been inseparable ever since. It was a good thing they shared an apartment. Mike was his good conscience and his truest supporter, reminding him of upcoming deadlines for essays and papers, sliding up next to him on the couch in front of the TV to watch old Sci-Fi-movies on lazy Sunday afternoons.
“No, apart from a few scrapes and bruises, mostly on his thighs and upper arms. Ah, and the bite wound on the shoulder, but that is an old one, I understand?”
“Makes me wonder, “the man continued, and he pointed between them with the gun in his hand, “are you so much looking forward to your deaths? Are you some kind of masochists or something?”
Needing to feel Sherlock against him, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back and pressed him even tighter against himself, pushing their lips against each other more firmly too. Tiny little breaths escaped Sherlock’s parted plush lips which encouraged John to slowly brush his tongue against the seam of those perfect lips. Sherlock tensed underneath him and John withdrew at once, closing his own lips, and kissing him chastely on the right corner of his lower lip instead, purposely avoiding hitting the spot where the lip was split.
Magnussen slowly turned away from Scott, focussing his cold eyes on John instead. “You?” he asked skeptically.
He began to pull at Sherlock’s arms when he was suddenly and overwhelmingly pushed back against the back of the couch. Long, pale arms flung themselves around his neck and he found himself squeezed into the leather beneath him with an armful of detective.
Heat rose in his cheeks as he mentioned that last part but Sherlock blushed prettily too, which encouraged John to continue.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed and his eyes sparkled dangerously as he leaned forward, right into John’s space. “Especially me? What do you mean?” His voice, low and trembling, caused a shiver to run down John’s spine.
John groaned and sighed and moaned as he turned and tossed as he thought and thought and thought. He didn’t want to, but he couldn’t help it. And somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that he wouldn’t get any rest until he had this sorted out, so he best get on with it. This was important now, for his peace of mind.
A repressed homophobic then. A very easy deduction if not a disappointing one. It had probably something to do with the also repressed nature of the relationship John had with his father, a soldier through and through who believed in conservative role models, masculinity, and the benefits of continuing the Watson line, transferring his genes onto another generation. Being gay would be wrong. Being gay would be weak and that was something John Watson could never bear to be.
Sherlock had realized that from the very start things were different with his new flatmate and at first, that hadn’t been a problem at all. John had been, on the surface just an ordinary guy in his late thirties, an ex-soldier and army doctor with PTSD, easy to read. But the more he got to know him, the more layers of John’s personality made themselves known and he grew more and more fascinated with him.
“Really, John, “Greg said with a smirk, “you must enlighten me sometime how you do it. Make the rich guys do that little wave with their hands so everything just lands in your lap.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth as if to protest. Then he stopped, shrugged, and started to pack his things. He was finished in less than two minutes.
Sherlock didn’t look at her either. “Yes, “he answered, his voice monotonous, almost dull. “Let’s get it over with.”
A jolt of anger shot through John’s body like electricity and he was about to jump up and barge into the room when he caught Greg’s eye and saw the man look at him with wide eyes, shaking his head.
