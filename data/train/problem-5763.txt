Their room would be waiting.  Their room.  Steve’s room, once, so long ago, when separate rooms had seemed like a privilege.  The walls held Steve’s art.  Beautiful landscapes, portraits and vignettes he sketched as they traveled that Tony kept and had framed.  An old woman in a kerchief sitting on the steps of a church with her hand out as people passed. Tony had pressed a wad of bills into her fingers, and she had beamed a gap-toothed smile and said something to him in a language he didn’t know, but it had the feeling of gratitude.  An intricately detailed drawing of the labyrinthine interior of spiral shell they had found on a beach in the Caribbean.  Couples strolling along the Charles Bridge in Prague, under the watchful gazes of stone saints.  A rubbing of a gravestone at Normandy.  Tony, with his head pillowed on his arms atop his desk and DUM-E’s claw resting in his lap, one of Tony’s hands caught mid-stroke along DUM-E’s arm.
It was quiet now.  Of course it was.  Everything was quiet here.  All the better to hear the machines.  Wouldn’t want to miss any of that completely useless information they were providing.  Tony was the only one who raised his voice in here.  Hell, maybe the only one talking above a whisper in the whole damn city for all he knew.  They all just stared at him when he did.  God help him, if someone patted him on the back and told him to hang in there again, Tony thought he might give Skynet a go just for shits and grins.
This is what bittersweet feels like, Tony thought, with a deep, aching tug in his chest where his heart tried to close that gap all on its own.
Soon enough, the world insisted on intruding, and the murky remnants of the dream were swept away.  Steve groaned, grimacing a bit as he shifted on the bed and realization sunk in.  Damn.  Again.  Shame and confusion washed over him, though not nearly as forcefully as they once had. He almost knew to expect it by now, but always hoped, maybe, this time would be different, though apparently not, he thought with a deep sigh. Scrubbing his hands over his face, he stared up at the slanting beams of the roof above his bed, a grimace of frustration marring his features.
“Catchy, I’ll give him that,” Tony nodded.  He felt Steve place a light kiss on the top of his shoulder and sighed into it.  “I just want everything to be perfect this time.  You don’t—you don’t need to worry about anything.  Just, you know, relax.  And don’t think about anything.  At all.  Like stuff that Bruce said, which you shouldn’t think about.  Because I’m not.”
Pushing his wayward thoughts to the back of his mind, Steve reached for one of the water casks and pulled the plug out, though when upended it, only a few drops leaked out into his mouth.  Shellhead gave him a pointed look. Over the past few days, Shellhead had grown increasingly concerned, often holding up one of the empty water casks with his tentacle and shaking it at Steve with a high-pitched sound of distress, as if he shouted about it enough, Steve would finally give in.  In the back of Steve’s mind, he wondered at what point Shellhead would just turn the boat around whether he had Steve’s leave or not. Steve wondered if maybe that wasn’t what he was waiting for, Shellhead to take the decision from his hands, because then...then it would be okay.
These are good men, Steve supposed, listening to them talk.  At least, not evil men, certainly, though something about Strucker gave him pause.  They cared about the people whose safety they were charged with protecting.  They were soldiers, most of them by career from what it sounded like.  Not so very different from the ones I left behind.  And yet, the system they are trying so earnestly to defend is also far too familiar.  One where someone’s worth was measured not by what blood they carried, but by whether their necks bore a collar, arbitrary, meaningless measures, and both systems buttressed by their own kind of violence.  Only here, that violence wasn’t a battlefield, but a story, one woven into the minds of every person, including the slaves themselves, he thought, remembering the other concubines and their easy embrace of this life.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, then shook his head, mouth ticking up into a small smile.  “How were the waffles?”
“Because…” Steve began, then broke off with a frustrated huff, his hands going to his hips.  “Because.”
“I like you, too,” Tony said, voice cracking on the last as he let his head fall back against the seat and closed his eyes.
“Sure,” Steve said, taking it off his arm and handing it to Rhodey, who hefted it and whistled lowly.
God, there had to be such a strange war going on in Steve’s head, Tony told himself, though he wasn’t sure if it was true or just what he had to let himself believe.  Tony was ten steps into their future, and Steve was still deciding on fight or flight.  Obviously, leaning a bit more towards flight at the moment, Tony thought grimly as he cupped a hand under his ribs, where the muscle was pinched and stinging.
“In the middle of that, you show up, and somehow, word that your tech is on offer starts bouncing all over the streets. Not just the usual weapons. Something else, something you've been keeping under wraps,” Fury continued.  “Next thing I know, Stern’s got you dead to rights trying to bribe him, you’re two seconds from a warrant, and then you’re suddenly married to Gypsy Rose there.”
the way a gargoyle waits over a church’s door, on guard for sinners. The way a hungry wolf waits for a lamb to stray too far from the herd. There was waiting, and then there was
“It’s not just---“ Steve shouted, one fisted hand banging on the table hard enough to make the whole thing jump, sending Tony’s coffee sloshing over the rim of the mug.  Tony jerked back, staring at the coffee pooling around the mug.  On the mug, Garfield warned him never to trust a smiling cat.  No shit, Garfield, Tony thought, looking up at Steve.  “You can’t—you can’t ask me to let you go—to—to…watch you…watch that happen when there is any way possible to prevent it,” Steve finished, stone-faced.
“You are always mine,” Steve growled roughly, an edge of possessiveness stoking something sharp up his spine and into his chest. “Always were. The gods marked you so I would know it.”
“Do I?  Is that what I know, Tony?  This wouldn’t even be an issue if you’d think about someone other than yourself for change.  We have thousands of employees.  Investors. Stockholders.  And you, off playing mechanic at SHIELD because your Alpha thinks it’s cute or something,” Howard scoffed.  “No, no, I’m sorry Captain, but it’s the truth.  SI would be the laughingstock of the industry if we let this be anything other than a vanity project for the newly Bonded.  Board won’t like it, but they’ll understand. They’ve all had new Omegas to break in.  It happens,” Howard finished with a commiserating shrug.
Tony opened his mouth to say something else, then snapped it closed again and reached for his coffee instead.  This was one of those switch-flickers, Tony thought.  Tesla.  Of all things.  He should make a list.  Steve liked his little lists, so it seemed appropriate.
“It’s nothing, really. Guess flowers are probably not even a thing anymore, huh?” Steve said, feeling his size all of a sudden, that hyper-aware feeling of all his limbs having nothing to do.  “Just thought it’d be funny or something. I don’t know.”
There’s a path through the mountain, Steve thought, eyes dropping to the table as his hands balled into fists in his lap.
“Pretty sure we’re at least one knife short of a full set,” Steve commented over Tony’s shoulder.  Tony swiveled his head around with a gleeful smirk at that, but Steve just gave him a strange, oddly tight look and slipped his arm from Tony’s grasp.  Steve turned away from them and braced his hands on the rounded edges of the craps table.  He didn’t look back again, which bothered Tony for some reason.  Probably because he’d spent the past day or so watching Steve catch everything head-on, and this was new.  Whatever it was, Tony found he didn’t like it. At all.
Tony stared at him, mouth opening and closing while he waited for the other shoe to drop.  When he couldn’t wait any longer, he finally sucked in a deep breath and stood up, pulling the dogtags over his head.  They were heavier than they looked, solid and cold against his the hollow of his chest, making a slight, roughened noise when they rubbed together.  His left hand snaked around them, clutching them in his fist and pulling the chain tight against the back of his neck until it dug into the crease of skin there.  He meant to ask what he was supposed to do up there at Rogers’ little Alpha hut, but what came out was, predictably, not quite what he’d intended.
“Me?  I haven’t left the state.  Barely left L.A.  Well, until now, I guess,” Tony replied somewhat more defensively than he’d meant to.  Wasn’t his fault the Stark prison work-release program hadn’t gone international.
Well...they're getting somewhere?  Naturally, I can't make it easy for them.  It *is* me.  If you are enjoying this, the only way I know that is a comment or kudos.  It is so very much appreciated.  Thank you again for your continued support.
“And when someone comes in and offers these crofters and smiths in your Free States a few coins for their vote, what then? What manner of person do you get then?” Tony asked.  He slowed and turned to look at Steve, his eyes narrowing shrewdly.
“Got it in one,” Tony said after a beat.  He looked across the table at Steve and waited.  “He supports more protections for Omegas after an Alpha breaks the Bond.  Financial support, at least.  Some kind of temporary stipend, just so, you know, they’d have some time to deal with things.  Because, it’s hard when you—they--don’t have money and can’t really work, so a lot of times, they have to Bond again or go back home to their parents, or—or other stuff.  That’s a—that can be hard,” Tony stammered as he twisted the tines of his fork around on his plate, making a dull, clicking sound that seemed to be the only thing he could hear over the pounding in his ears.
Steve had no idea how to answer.  He opened and closed his mouth, trying to find the right words or something in the King’s manner that would tell him what to say, but the King’s face was closed, carefully blank.
Two days later, Tony’s bed had been completely redone with a new mattress that had a smoothly finished oaken plank covered by a soft top of cotton and down on one side of it. No recriminations, no mention of it, really, just Tony figuring out a way to make work, because that was what he could do, and not letting Steve go was a promise Steve knew Tony intended to keep in all the ways that mattered.
“I’ve wanted it, too,” Steve admitted, his voice coming out in a raspy whisper.  A tremor ran through him as Tony dipped his head again to Steve’s lips, then lower, his mouth gliding along Steve’s jaw and down the column of his throat to settle into the crook of his neck where his blood jumped against his skin in time with Steve’s heart.
“See, I knew you had an ulterior motive for insisting I come down here,” Bruce interrupted with a grimace, though not without some understanding behind it.
“I know. I’m—it’s a lot.  Everything’s happening at once, and it’s…it’s just a lot, okay?” Steve stammered.
“Good-weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that’s about right,” Steve said with a sharp laugh.  “Don’t you need to get to your meeting?”
“You, who have been married for all of a few hours, are suddenly full of wisdom on the subject?” Tony spat out with such bitterness that it made Steve tense up, almost step back with the force of it.   “Does it suit you so well, then, this farce of a—“  Tony broke off, rubbing a hand over his mouth as if to scrub away the words.
“Did the Taliban wave your grunge phase in your face before they tried to blow you up?  Then, no, not the same,” Tony quipped, giving Steve a small, wan smile.  “We could go away.  Just us. I’ve got a place. In Malibu.  Private. Get away until things blow over a bit.”
“Better than the last one?” Tony repeated, rising to the bait.  Barnes shrugged and looked away, towards the one, dingy window next to the apartment’s door.
He frowned a bit as ideas ran through his head as he wrapped his hands with tape, only to discard each of them just as rapidly.  Tony wasn’t just
“Yes, Your Highness,” Steve said slowly, keeping his eyes on Tony.  In his head, he had meant it as a jest, to remind Tony of what he said earlier, but it failed to come out that way.  Instead, he heard his voice sound rough, husky, and filled with the absolute certainty that he loved this man more than anything.  “Yes, Tony. Please.”
“Home,” Steve answered after a moment.  It sounded more barbed than he meant.  Deliberately cruel, but he couldn't seem to help himself.  His head was a storm of emotions. He couldn’t think.  Tony’s words left him reeling, unsure of what it all meant. He should just tell Tony the truth, but he couldn’t seem to make himself, not after everything Tony had said.  I saw you, he thought to himself. I saw you, and I loved you more than anything.
“Do me a favor, okay?  Play at least one or two cassettes before you take it apart, huh?” Stane requested with a jovial grin that made Steve’s desire to punch him dial up to ten.
Steve handed him the bag of fish food from the basket and shook out a red checkered blanket, placing it neatly on the ground beneath one of the tall pines that circled the pond.
He should be beyond happy. Ecstatic. Thrilled. But there was a hollow sort of emptiness settling in his chest, because he’d been given Steve his whole life and not seen it, but Steve never had anyone and never believed he would. He’d signed up to be Erskine’s lab rat and knew when he did it that part of the thing that qualified him was that he was the kind of alone that Tony never truly had been. Steve had loved Peggy and sent the Valkyrie into the icy Arctic waters knowing she would have another chance at happiness.  Had Howard known?  was that what drove him to keep searching?
“I have them Iron Man!” Thor announced in the way only Thor could.  “Have no fear.  They shall be made to respect the bubble!”  Tony seriously considered just leaving the battle to the rest of the team and finding a nice paper bag to put over his head.  But there was Steve and,
“You follow the journals?  Of course, you do.  You’re Tony Stark.  Sorry, I—wow, that’s--thank you!” Jane exclaimed.  “That’s…I mean, coming from you, that’s, wow.”
“Pull the Hammer Industries filings for the past fifteen years or so—get the proxies and D&B reports-- and poke around, would you?” Tony requested.  “We’ll need the PAC reports, too, so go through the FEC and state databases. Then go back and take a look at all the DoD contracts on bid and the ones Hammer got for the same time period and cross reference it against what you’re seeing in their financials and the grease money.  See if there is anything that jumps out at you.”
He tried to focus on those sounds, which had always soothed him, but no matter what he did, he couldn’t get to sleep, just ticked off how much time he had left before he had to wake up in the morning.  Finally, Steve pushed the blanket off and walked over to the window, tugging it open just enough to let the sounds fill the room.  He grabbed a pillow from a nearby chair and sat down on top of it, staring out into the night.
He’d said something like that before, after the ceremony in the stone circle, Steve remembered, and like then, a chill snaked itself down Steve’s spine, as if Tony’s words portended something beyond what Steve could see.
“I’m sure,” Steve replied smoothly.  “Thanks for letting us barge in on your day,” Steve told the agents.
There weren’t any photos of him there, of course, though he spotted a few of Barnes, one that looked to be a group of them leaning against the hood of a Hum-Vee in some patch of sand and rock, holding an Army flag between them, and another set of pictures with Barnes, Nat, Steve, Thor and a man with light brown, closely shaved hair all posing for a wedding photo, smiling politely with a second one next to it where they seemed to be posing like something out of Charlie’s Angels, goofily serious expressions and fingers for guns aiming haphazardly.
Steve turned to study his reflection in the looking glass, wondering, for a moment, what Tony saw when he looked at him.  He was far from the sickly youth he had once been, though perhaps not as different in his own mind’s eye than in the gaze of others. He had been told too many times that his look was pleasing to completely deny it, but there were more beautiful concubines at Tony’s beck and call than him.  More exotic and talented and certainly more suited to this, to be sure.   Yet, Tony apparently rarely indulged, to hear Zola tell it.  At least until now.  He was different, is all, Steve told himself.  Different from what Tony was used to.  Something new and unusual to catch the King’s fancy, though the words hung hollow in his chest.   The fascination would dim soon, certainly.  Tony would likely barely miss him when he was gone.  Perhaps he would not even search.  That would be better, of course.  It would be better if he did not care to bother to look.
Terror warred with a sort of eerie fascination.  This was first contact. He, Tony Stark, proud owner of the actual Captain’s chair from bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which he definitely did not sit in and occasionally give orders, was making first contact with an alien species.
Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding and rubbed a hand at his temples.  He hadn’t gotten this maudlin in years.  No real mystery why now, he supposed, dropping his hand down to the edge of the sink.  He looked up at his reflection in the window.  He was the thing that had changed, when you got down to it.  His hair was still too wild.  The small bit of help from the wind as he walked from the car into the cabin hadn’t done it any favors.  The sculpted goatee and moustache were only a few years old, but he thought they suited him.  His small act of rebellion—hair where hair actually grew naturally? Horrifying, apparently---had driven the media crazy, but Steve told him he was beautiful.  And that it tickled, Tony remembered, eyes crescenting. But, that was another story.
Tony’s tongue darted out and traced the seam of Steve’s mouth, then delved inside, flicking and curling against Steve’s own, sliding along the edge of Steve’s tongue, in and out, then swirling around and around, and drawing Steve into his own mouth with a soft groan.  The hand in Steve’s hair rubbed encouragingly as Tony’s mouth angled against Steve’s.  Steve may not have done this before, but Tony obviously had.  He was all skill and heat and soft movements that sent shivers wracking through Steve, centering on the tip of his cock.  The kiss shifted, deepened.  Steve ground his hips against Tony’s and felt the answering thrust of Tony’s cock sliding next to his own between them.  Steve moaned into Tony’s mouth, a wet, breathy sound, and Tony nipped his bottom lip, then sucked at it, before licking his tongue across the mark.
“Absolutely not, Tony, I cannot put that on letterhead, just no,” Ms. Potts said, slashing her hand through the air for emphasis.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t meant to deposit the check.  He honestly had every intention of doing just that when he got to the bank.  He went through all the steps.  But then, standing at the teller’s window, pen in hand to endorse the check, his mind flashed back to what Tony said about having to pay people to be with him, and he just… couldn't do it.  He couldn’t do that to Tony.  Or, honestly, to himself.  He wasn't that person.  He was someone who
The others.  Ross and his floating prison built to house exactly one kind of inmate.  They’d been caught.   Worse, Steve’s mind had supplied.  How many times will I not be fast enough?  Too many.  That was the answer, and he knew it, and he hated the knowing.  The certainty, spinning round and round like a coin on its edge until the force of it gave way to stillness.  It was going to happen again.  One day. It always did, when you thought you were done or safe or could breathe for a moment.
Steve stumbled after Tony, limbs tangling together. Tony’s hands were on him, everywhere, tugging at his jacket while Steve’s own hands used Tony’s hips for purchase as they staggered together into the room.  Their mouths angled over each other, wanton and shameless, missing almost as much as they connected, but it didn’t seem to matter. Steve could taste Tony’s lips, warm and sweet with champagne, smell the hint of Tony’s cologne when he buried his nose against Tony’s jaw and nudged at his ear, feel the hard press of Tony’s arousal bumping against his thigh when they made contact.  The tightness of his pants against his own. It was too much and not enough.
He should stop. Put this back and go home. Wait it out, then hand it off to the lawyers and let this be done, once and for all. Rhodey was right. This was some serious through-the-looking-glass territory, right here. A sense of wrongness was prickling up and down his spine, niggling at the back of his head like a constant buzzing sound. Partly from his own actions, sure, but the whole thing, this box of relics, Steve’s comments last night, Barnes’ and Natasha’s righteous indignation, the whole fucking mess of it was off, like everyone was playing at opposite day, but he hadn't gotten the memo. Nothing about this box fit the narrative that had been sounding in Tony's head all these years, like he'd stumbled into an earlier draft of a story that had long-since changed.
“Thanks,” Tony said, too quickly. He watched Steve's eyes shift, his stance go rigid, and found himself scrubbing a hand over his face. “Scratch that. I mean, don't. I mean,” Tony stopped, taking a breath. “Thanks, really. For...you know, not being a dick about this.”
“That’s…not a reason to do anything,” Tony protested.  It wasn’t.  That made no sense.  He wished his stomach would un-knot itself from downward-facing-dog position and get onboard with the Steve was being ridiculous train.
“Sunset.  Are you done now? Can we go? We are not even supposed to be in here, I told you,” Almec said in a hushed, urgent tone.  “That Potts woman said—"
At least, he thought with a sigh, that was what he told himself when he berated his presence here instead of where he was most needed.  How many times had he started to pack his things with all the intention of heading off only to change his mind? Find some reason he needed to stay just a little bit longer?  He didn’t think he was a coward, but here he sat, while so many were off laying down their lives for the war, including his best friend.  What did that say about him?
.  Knowing what all of this was doing to him. The thought sent a rush of hot shame through his gut that made Steve want to squirm. It mixed with a deeper heat of arousal that pooled low behind Steve’s cock, which throbbed insistently against the confines of the cage around it.   The combination was almost too much.
There was wine on the table. Something white he'd pulled from the fridge, sweating droplets of condensation on the table. He should've let it breath. Or something. Though, why should the wine get all that glorious oxygen when Tony couldn't seem to get enough air to make his chest stop hurting?
“Oh, nothing, nothing,” Fury said in a placating tone.  “Good family. Howard—the father—he’s in the weapons business, as I’m sure you know. Small company, but they make some decent stuff, or so I’m told. He’s got some pull, a few connections in D.C., but…” he continued, spreading his hands wide.  “Can’t say I know much about the boy. I’ve only met him a few times.”
When he came this time, he let his cock rest inside the warm, slick body for a while. He could feel the hole shuddering and trying to clench around him, even if it was too loose now to really manage it. It was nice like that, just being connected to someone. Accepted. Close. When was the last time he was close to someone, really close to them? He couldn’t remember.
Ideas. Reality. Freedom. Who was right.  Who was wrong.  Accusations. Arguments. Barbed words meant to do damage when he had no other way to inflict it.  He truly wondered sometimes, why everything had to be a fight to be won, no matter who got hurt.
“Don’t think your heart was the organ you were having issues with,” Steve replied around a knowing smirk.
“Hard same, there, gotta admit,” Tony sighed, an answering smile carried on his voice.  “God, see?  We’re like, in simpatico or something.  This whole relationship thing really
“Thaaaaaaat is…definitely true,” Tony acknowledged carefully.  “But, to be fair, the same could be said of a lot of seemingly harmless tech.  Trust me.  Give me a screwdriver and some duct tape, and I could weaponize that iPad into something far more sinister than a glorified storage-eating kid-occupier,” Tony argued.  “Hard to stop that kind of thing.”
By the time Tony shoved the apron over his head and handed it back to another volunteer, he had to admit, serving the unwashed masses with questionable food was, well, surprisingly not awful.  He wasn’t going to pretend it hadn’t started off a little awkward when they pulled up in the Bentley, but the Director turned out to be the most non-judgmental woman on the planet, who just welcomed Steve back and pointed them towards the crate of clean aprons and a food station without a word.
“The kitchen helpers, all they do is chop and boil and talk,” Cam replied.  “They like to talk about the King most of all, of course, and you, too, because he cares for you so.”
“Thanks, Happy. Mr. Rogers, I’m Ms. Potts. We spoke earlier,” the woman said by way of introduction.  Steve nodded.  Not a conversation he was likely to forget. “If you’ll follow me.”
After Tony drank his fill, the alien moved away, down to the end of the table again, waving a hand as he did and sending the not-gel back over Tony so that he was covered entirely again in a warm, heavy blanket.  A warm, heavy blanket that glowed. Whatever.
“Happy, we’ll need to drop Steve at his place on the way home,” Tony finished, and Steve felt his stomach drop as a huge crush of disappointment and humiliation washed over him, Tony’s simple words managing to sting far worse than Hammer’s pointed barbs.
“Boston? Not really.  Haven’t wanted to since.  Well.  You know,” Steve said, looking down at his plate for a moment before he regrouped and looked back up at Tony.  “Be neat to go back. See the old haunts, that kind of thing.  You think our apartment’s still there?  Probably not, huh?”
“I’m going to fuck your mouth now,” Tony told him, which was all the warning he got before Tony slammed his cock back in again, sliding past Steve’s tongue and down his throat again, momentarily making Steve’s vision blacken before he pulled back and started thrusting in earnest.  Tony’s hands were in his hair, gripping his head now, holding him there, anchoring him, keeping him steady.
“Rogers,” Steve said by way of answer as he clicked the button on the phone.  “Now isn’t really…Uh-huh.”  Pause.  “I see.”  Hand on his hip.  Toe of his shoe scuffing against the driveway.  Someone wasn’t happy about things, Tony thought with no small amount of glee. “Fine,” Steve snapped, clicking the phone off and dropping it back into his pocket.  “I have to go.”
“For a good cause. He’s in it with Stane, for sure. I needed to see if it was about the money or something else. Now, I know. He’s Hydra, too,” Tony explained. “Steve, look, I think you’re smart enough to know that I’ve told you enough here that you can hurt me with it. I’m taking a gamble that you’re actually the kind of guy who cares about doing the right thing. Granted, I’m basing that on the fact that you sent my one grand back to me instead of just keeping it, but still. I like to think lap dance integrity still means something in this country.”
“You build robots,” Steve laughed into the fist of his hand, a huge grin splitting his face and taking years off. “Robots,” Steve repeated with a shake of his head.
.  Maybe that was a lot more universal than Steve could have ever realized.  Shellhead stared at him a beat longer, then dropped his eyes and turned, slipping off into the sea.
“Winner of each hole gets one question.  Loser has to answer.  No half-assed, ‘I wasn’t hurt’ crap, either,” Tony challenged.
Tony’s own room was a disordered mess, with piles of clothes, posters stuck to the wall, pictures of Jarvis and his mom,  receipts he’d pulled out of his pocket and hadn’t thrown away yet, a few take-out menus from the drawer in the kitchen, plastic-sleeved comic books in carefully alphabetized rows in cardboard boxes, bits and pieces of various machines dropped in mid-creation, half-filled coffee cups he hadn’t bothered to take to the kitchen, an embarrassing number of action figures lined up along the top of his dresser and a guitar he didn’t play, but secretly thought it made him look cooler to have it leaning against the wall.  He could learn to play it.  One day.  Could happen.
he heard Zola’s words echo in his mind, making his stomach clench and churn.  Rumlow had delighted in shoving that long, leather-clad piece of smoothly-shaped wood down his throat until he gagged and choked and saliva dripped down his chin. Practice, Rumlow had told him with a sadistic, gleeful cut to his smile.  Sometimes, he buckled a strap around Steve’s mouth, holding it in place, leaving him there chained to the wall while he struggled to breathe through his nose and keep whatever little food he had in his belly from killing him.
No uniform.  Showered.  Shaved.  Someone wants to tell, not show, Tony thought to himself.  God, you freak out one time over what was, by any estimation, way more blood than any one person should lose, and he never forgets it, Tony thought, finding a strange, fond comfort in that.
It wouldn’t though, a small voice said from the back of his head.  This, he could do.  He knew he could, the way the LIGO data made sense, the way equations seemed to solve themselves.  He knew it in his bones.  He could do this.
“Then, an extremely surly, one-armed man—Barnes, you said, right?  Steve’s best friend?--mumbled his way through an apology while glaring a hole in my rug.  Seriously, I think he managed to disintegrate the wool fibers with the sheer force of his absolute disgust at being there, but, give the man credit, he got through it,” she said with a roll of her eyes.  “It was hard to get a read on him, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say he doesn’t like you very much. I mean, its subtle, but…”
They worked together, as one, all of them better for it, but even Tony could feel the difference when it was him and Steve.  He would have had to ask Steve what kind of books he liked, but if he landed and pointed his repulsors at Steve, Steve just raised the shield and directed the energy blast toward the approaching robots or Steve would raise his hand and Tony would grab him and toss him on the back of one of the bigger ones, giving Steve and his shield access to the vulnerable necks, as if everything was just done by unspoken agreement worked out in advance.  It was that easy, that natural.
“It would be no shame to admit when you are bested,” Steve said after pinning Tony for what he thought was the fifth time.
. You’ve no reason to, I know, and probably a hundred good reasons not to, but, I don’t think I’m wrong about the kind of man you are,” Rhodes said, clapping Steve’s shoulder and tugging a bit at him.
Then he’d actually met Steve, which had gone spectacularly poorly. Not as if there had been any kind of unrealistic expectations in play, Tony thought dully. It had hurt, he couldn’t deny that, unfair though that may have been to Steve. It had been like every disappointment left festering for years was scraped out of him, leaving him hollow and empty. He’d poured them onto Steve, of course he had, damn Loki and his magic stick.
“Come now, Rhodes, Asgard? Really?” Tony scoffed, shaking his head a bit. “Children’s stories and riders of the wastes? That’s what you would have me worry about? Asgard withdrew from the world after the decimation of Yo’ten, and hasn’t been heard from since. They destroyed their only connection to the mainland and burned their ships. I remember hearing my great-grandmother talk about seeing the smoke rising from fires from her window all the way across the White Sea. They’re a cautionary tale of overreach and arrogance that the old ones tell around a fire, nothing more, you know that. As for Tytahn,” Tony paused, a frown pulling at his mouth. “I’ve heard the tales. And tales are what they are, at least for now. Lord Murdock says spice traders from the East carry them with their other baggage and trade these tales just as eagerly with anyone who will buy them a flagon. Who knows what is to be believed? It makes no sense, which I seem to recall being your exact words. Why attack Xenobaris? It held nothing of value. They’re… fishers and net-makers. Peaceful. Hardly a target for plunder. Far more likely these traders are spreading rumors to raise the price of their wares on some notion of coming scarcity than that the ruler of Tytahn has suddenly decided to attack his neighbors unprovoked and without gain.”
I truly do love and appreciate everyone who leaves a comment and/or kudos. I read every single comment, sometimes multiple times, and it is wonderfully motivating to know people are invested in this.  That being said, I'm not able to reply to comments at the moment, and I'm sorry for that. It doesn't mean I don't appreciate them as much as always, it is just a matter of limited time and mental energy, and I'd rather devote what I have to writing and reading.  Please don't think my lack of response means you did anything wrong or that I don't care anymore.  It's just hard right now, but know that I love that you all care enough to take the time to do so, if you are able. Thank you!!!
“I’m sorry,” Steve said.  He wasn’t sure what else to say or why Rhodes was telling him this, but he understood the pain, the frustration, the questioning, why them and not me? “It’s never fair.  And it always hurts.  Until it doesn’t, and then…”
“Why would I?  Here is good.  Everyone, they want to see Tahir.  Even if they cannot take my cock, they like to say they can, and Tahir is rewarded.  No marching. No standing.  Just fucking,” Tahir shrugged, then grinned.  “These three, they will wither like stalks of grain in the sun, but my cock will always be a gift of the gods.”
Tony smiled then, soft and sure, the nervousness seemingly gone or at least held at bay for now.  He leaned down, putting one hand on each side of Steve’s head and dipped his mouth down to capture Steve’s.  At first, the kiss was sweet, almost chaste, but quickly turned into something far different as Tony flattened his length on top of Steve, moving in slow, sinuous motions, rubbing and grating a wondrous friction in all the right places.  Steve’s hands wound their way under Tony’s arms and splayed over Tony’s back as the kiss deepened.
“I’m just going to look at it, maybe clean it up a bit.  Bruce can decide what more to do when they find us,” Steve assured him, hopefully sounding more sure of that scenario than he felt.
“Good, good.  He was just trying to help, really, because How—my Dad was freaking out.  Anyway, I’m just.  I’m glad.  Is all.  That it was you,” Tony continued hurriedly. “Not someone else.  Some boring asshat who probably doesn’t push cars off cliffs to make a point.”
“I’m not going on a blind date.  Not happening,” Tony said, pushing himself off the creeper and climbing into the driver’s seat of the roadster.  “Okay, first, I can get a date on my own.  You might not know this,” Tony said, wagging his head a bit and squinting at her, “but, I’m kind of what you’d call eligible.  Second, why doesn’t Michelangelo just get his own date? What’s wrong with him?”
They rode up the elevator in silence.  Tony assumed this was largely because they didn’t need words to communicate and also because Tony was busy sniffing Steve, who smelled positively wonderful, and he should see about bottling that scent, but he couldn’t sell it, of course not, because then other people could smell Steve and know how wonderful he smelled and that would be bad, because this was for him.
Tony watched his father’s back as he walked away to join the other men celebrating in the billiards room, then turned and walked slowly up the staircase towards his room.  He stopped on the landing when another round of laughter echoed out into the mansion’s foyer.  He hated them.  Hating Howard was easy enough.  He’d learned how to do that at his father’s knee, after all.  He hated all of them, though, with their cigars and brandy and stupid jokes, with their lingering gazes and averted eyes, because let’s have some fucking decorum here while we’re doing this, by God.
letters, which need my attention,” he said, a hint of amusement in his voice, and Steve remembered,  yes, the letters were important. “So, I’ll have to trust you while I work. Can I do that?”
“I know,” Tony said.  He looked down, then over at Steve.  His mouth was a flat, grim line, his eyes full of sorrow.  “I
“Ms. Potts and your lawyer are probably going to want to talk to me about the reporter thing, aren’t they?” Steve asked, sounding tired, but not particularly worried.  Tony strongly suspected that Steve was the type the drill sergeant yelled at while Steve stood there and took it and then went right back to doing whatever it was that Steve thought was best.  Independent thinking wasn’t something he normally associated with Army enlisted, but Steve kept managing to turn Tony’s other assumptions on their heads, so why not?
There was that moment when the pressure is too much and the water that was a trickle seeping through a crack becomes a flood.  That was what it felt like. Too many emotions pushing through too little space able to deal with it, overwhelming everything in their path.  Tony heard himself make a hiccupping half-sob, almost in startle, then bent over, sucking in a tremulous breath only to find himself wrapped against Steve’s chest with Steve’s face buried in the top his head, telling him it was alright.  And it was.  It was.  Everything was fine, and it was too much.
He didn’t quite know where that from, but a well of pain and frustrated, impotent anger came on its heels. It wasn’t aimed at Steve, exactly, but it wasn’t not aimed at him, either.  Tony had just enough time to think, ‘fuck, too far,’ before Steve drew back like he’d been slapped.  Tony opened his mouth to apologize, but couldn’t get any sounds to come out.
He let his hands fall from Steve’s waist, turned away again and bowed his head.  Steve lifted the pitcher of warm water up and held it there for a moment, hesitating.  Then, he dipped the handle and let the warm water pour over Tony’s hair, washing out the soap and leaving wet curls clinging to the sides of his head.  Anointed, Steve thought, with a flash of memory, shadows on a cave wall that grew into something else, his heart melting into the holy man’s chants as ash and oil were painted over his eyes like a mask.  One is life, one is death, over and over, until it was a drumbeat in Steve’s ears, and he’d asked, the draught at his lips, which one was it to be for him. Each of you are both, the man had said, with his strange laugh echoing in Steve’s ears even as the potion burned a path of fire through his body. They had poured water over his head to cleanse the ash and oil off when it was over, Steve remembered. Warm water, to wash it all away, and then handed him a shield.  His hand curled into a fist of its own accord, and for a moment, Steve could almost feel the familiar weight of it under his fingers. A shiver made its way up Steve’s spine, and the feeling that something had passed between them, some moment he only barely missed, fell over him with a vague sense of disquiet.
Not wanting to waste any precious time, Steve hurried down the hallway, following it as it wound its way behind the foyer and emptied into a long, straight hall lined in a plush, red carpet with doors on either side.  They were all closed for the evening, though Steve’s mind conjured the layout easy enough. Office and conference room for when Howard needed to work from the house. Maid’s closet. Bathroom. A parlor that had been converted to an exercise room, according to Peggy.  Music room. Tony’s mother had played piano, Steve recalled, glancing at it as he passed with a slight pang somewhere in the pit of his stomach. Billiards room. Then,
. His body reached for it, chased it, instinctively wanting more, and the alien obliged, humming that strange chant of his, his hands stroking over Tony’s skin like some kind of balm.
“Good,” Tony said, turning to face the last moments of sunlight just as the Skywalk’s lights flickered on.
Finally, Steve nodded, his hands falling to his sides.  He didn’t even know why it mattered now.  For whatever reason, Tony spared him that night on the road, but he must want to finish what he began, and whatever power it was he held over Steve that brought him here seemed to be enough to keep him here, Steve realized as he looked down into the depths of Tony’s eyes and fell, or it felt like falling.  Surely, this was what it felt like to fall.  This swoop of stomach, this thrill, this terror, this exhilaration as he spiraled downward, ever downward, toward Tony. Everyone falls, we are all made of sin, he remembered the Reverend saying during one of his sermons, and he thought that might be true of him, at least, because he couldn’t seem to stop himself.
He’d been in their apartment, surrounded by all the brand new things Steve had gone binge-shopping to buy with his father’s money, wanting so very desperately for Steve to deny it, but, of course, Steve had owned up to it.  He’d give him credit for that, at least, though all the proof had been right there in front of him.   He remembered what Steve said to him though.  Take care of yourself, Tony.  How fucking flippant.  Take care of yourself?  How, he’d wanted to shout.  How was he supposed to do that, when everything was falling apart around him?  But that was then, and this was a very different kind of now.
“Well, he was a former prosecutor.  God,” Tony said, shaking his head and running a quavering hand through his already mussed hair.  “How could I be so stupid?  It isn’t one shipment, is it?”
“You’re beautiful, Steve,” Tony whispered into his skin, the heat of the words seeming to emblazon them there, absorbing into him as they cooled. “Beautiful.”
“There you go.  Beautiful.  Look at you,” Tony encouraged.  His hand glided up and down twice more over Steve’s cock, wrist twisting at the head.  A sob wracked though Steve’s body, and he curved his back into an arch, head grinding against Tony’s shoulder.  Tony’s other arm caught him as he nearly collapsed forward, a soft groan all he could muster.  “That’s it. So good.  Now, come for me, Steve. Come for me, my love, there you go.”
capisce?” he continued, wagging his fingers and rolling his eyes.  “Steve? Steve,” he called out, snapping his fingers in the air to get Steve’s attention. Steve just raised his eyebrows at him, then gave Tony a sidelong look.  “You treat him right, you hear me? You know what I mean. Um-hmmm. Give the man his due, that’s all I’m saying,” he said, slapping his hand against the top of the table for emphasis.  “You know what I mean, uh-huh, yeah, you do. Gotta earn your keep, am I right? Guys like me and Tony here, we work hard, man, we do, and we need to
Steve dropped his arm to his side, pumped his hips down on Tony’s fingers, then looked hazily down at Tony.
“Take 18,” Steve said, nodding at the green highway signs.  “There are some nice views.  You’ll like it.”
“Um.  Yes?” Steve said, then cleared his throat.  “Yes. I’d—I’d like to do that for you. If you wanted. Not because of anything, but...just because.”
“What about you?” Steve asked, lifting his eyes to look up at Tony from under unfairly long lashes.  “I’m sorry, I—I don’t have…” he trailed off, fisting his hand in his lap and frowning.
“We know.  Everyone knows.  The people in the space station probably know,” Pepper said.  “Hashtag ‘HoneymoonInVegas’ is trending.  Right behind the new Starbucks drink.”
“Right. You already told me about that one,” Steve said.  “The North Star. I read a bit about it, too.”  Tony smiled softly, lowering himself back down to the pillow of Steve’s leg.
No, Steve thought. Cam was not stupid. He was a survivor, far more than Steve ever could be, not that Steve could fault him for it. Surviving in this world required the ability to put things of the past aside and allow the thin bonds that might form between people to stretch until they broke. It was the only way to get through it, Steve supposed.
Steve shouted some nonsense sound as his body rocked and twisted.  He felt Tony’s hand on his hip, steadying him, even as Tony sucked all the harder on the nub as feeling flowed back into it.  It was too much.  Too much pain and pleasure weaving together into one bright burst of heat and need.  So caught up in Tony’s mouth on his nipple and the desperate need to thrust, Steve didn’t notice Tony’s hand draw upon his chest until the other clamp snapped off and Tony caught Steve’s other nipple between his thumb and forefingers, rolling it and squeezing lightly, giving it the smallest of tugs. A long, low keening sound worked its way out of him like a bow drawing back.  Tony moved his mouth the other nipple and lapped at it, swirling his tongue around and around, then flicking it, hard.    Steve was coming before he realized what was happening, hips thrusting hard against Tony’s stomach. Tony’s slick hand found Steve’s cock, pushed the metal skirt aside and worked him through the last of it as long, white streams decorated the both of them.
“What—why—those things they said—“ Steve stuttered, turning and pointing at the crowd of news people outside the limo.
It was wrong to feel that way, he supposed, but it wasn’t as if he could really help the matter.  They were just dreams, and he was a young man, and even Bucky once admitted to having his own wicked dreams, hadn’t he?  Though, those dreams had been about the barmaid down at the tavern, who liked to say the width of the jugs of ale the tavern served were based on her rather ample bosom. Steve didn’t think that was likely true, but he could understand what would cause Bucky to dream about it.  His dreams, though...his dreams were...not that.  Even if he couldn’t quite remember them, he
“Impressive, righ?  Sentry mode,” Tony ordered.  Steve rocked back on his bottom so far that he toppled over to one side, staring up at the suit.  He managed to right himself, and half-scooted, half-crawled in some weird sort of crablike maneuver over to the suit’s feet, grabbing onto one boot and trying to pull himself up while he looked back and forth between Tony and the suit.
Afterwards, he’d asked if they could go to the circus.  She had promised they would.  He’d wanted a balloon, red, like the one the clown was holding, and maybe some cotton candy.  Jarvis had taken him, the first of many half-fulfilled promises that he didn’t realize at the time were each a step away from him.  He’d gotten that and so much more, anything he wanted, in fact.  Everything.  They’d given him everything they could, trying to fill something he didn’t know was empty until years later.
“I do,” Steve replied, feeling resolve harden his limbs as he stared down at the bed.  He wanted this.  He didn’t know why, but he could no longer deny it.  Whatever it was, whatever Tony would give him, he wanted it.  This time he had with Tony, if that was to be it, he would stop pretending that it wasn’t what he wanted.  This part, at least, no matter what happened, this part would not be a lie.  He would not do that to Tony.
“You will never be anything other than exactly what I want.  I’ll keep telling you that until you believe me or death do us part. Admittedly, that makes it seem like a completely safe bet on my part,” Tony said with a shrug. “Speaking of things that might complicate matters,” Tony continued, clearing his throat.  “Do you have any idea what it’ll be like with me?  We aren’t going to be able to keep a lid on this much longer. The press…they’ll pick you apart.  Anything they can get their hands on.  One minute, you’re the Brooklyn boy turned war hero.  They next, you’re some gold-digging janitor.  Have you thought about…are
“It was just a few ideas.  Not much, really,” Steve replied, feeling his cheeks warm at the praise in a different way than the other types of praise Tony heaped on him, but good nonetheless.
“My powers of persuasion are not to be mocked, Rogers,” Tony muttered around a smile.  “Now, lie back and think of America,” he quipped, grinning broadly.  Steve did that little half-eye roll, half-sigh thing that meant he was going to do what Tony asked, tossed the stuffed toys to the side and lay down on the sheet, still clutching the shield pillow to his chest.  “Not—no, not like that,” Tony grumbled.  “Here,” he said.  “Pillow behind the head and you—you just, like this,” Tony instructed, putting one hand behind his own head and angling his elbow out.
“I just don’t want him to get the upper hand here, Tony, it’s too important.  What he did...he needs to pay for that. For all the lives he took. He needs to pay.  With everything he has. I can’t even imagine the kind of person who does that. And there have to be others, Tony, he can’t have just done this on his own, not an operation this big.  God knows even how many people were complicit or looked the other way or just didn’t care enough--” Steve broke off, running a frustrated hand through his hair. “Sorry. Sorry, I...I really do have terrible cuddling talk, don’t I?” he huffed out with a low puff of air.  “Tony?” he said, when Tony didn’t reply. “What is it? I ruined the mood, didn’t I? Sorry. Go to sleep, how about? I shouldn’t have brought it up, but you called it pillow talk earlier and I--anyway. Sorry. Forget I said anything, okay?” Steve asked with a wince. He leaned over and pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s damp forehead.  “Sweet dreams, Tony. I love you."
Finally, Steve heard the door creak open behind him.  He didn’t turn, just kept his eyes forward on the headboard.  Light started to slowly fill the room.  Tony must be lighting candles.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony hold a flame to the candles in the holder on his desk, then place it in its own spot by the bed.  He gave Steve a once-over, almost perfunctory, but seemingly satisfied with what he found, then turned and walked out of Steve’s sight.  He heard the rustle of fabric, and the opening and closing of a cabinet, then a drawer.  Footsteps across the stone, and then softer on the rug, stopping just behind him at the end of the bed.  He felt the heavy weight of Tony’s eyes on him.
“The best things are, Tony,” Steve said, dropping his hand down to wrap around Tony’s.  Tony looked down at where their hands met, fingers intertwined, and held on like nothing in the world could make him let go.
Thank you to everyone still hanging in here for this fic and to anyone new brave enough to try a WiP that has been a WiP for this long.  I am slow, but I do finish things eventually.  This is actually Part I of this Chapter, but I decided to split it up because it was getting long, even by my standards.  Part II is about halfway done, so hopefully not too far off.  With that said, please enjoy!
“No you’re not,” Tony snapped at him. “Do me the courtesy of not compounding the lies. I think I have earned that much, at least,” he said with a grimace, swiping a hand over his face and looking back at Steve, his face softening just a fraction. His eyes, though… the pain stabbed at Steve’s chest, twisting its icy blade deep. Steve wanted to reach out and pull Tony to him, hold him, take it all back and promise him everything he wanted. “Steve…. you know that I can’t grant you what you want, you know that, yet you still--do you know how much it would weaken me if I set you free? The Raj’Inama? Do you even realize--no, of course, you don’t. Half the damn nobles still see only the indiscretions of my youth and the other half would like nothing better than to see the Council’s powers strengthened under the guise that I am too easy to manipulate. I would be playing right into their hands! Besides, free, we can’t be together, not as we are--as I want--you know that! And I can’t let you return to your home. Rhodey’s right on that score. This...this is the only way. I wish it were different.”
be done,” he added, almost muttering under his breath as he glanced down at the table laden with papers and instruments, then lifted his dark eyes back to Steve.
Steve followed Zola inside the chambers, down a small hallway and past two guards who stood silently in front of heavy, red curtains that were drawn back to reveal a large room with a fireplace surrounded by several chairs and low tables, a carved desk spilling over with stacks of parchment and yellow-paged books, and a massive bed against the far wall that drew Steve’s eyes for a long moment before he remembered to look down.
Steve grimaced and shook his head, disappointment and lack of surprise warring with him as he stepped over Brock and headed for the door.  It wasn’t a win.  Whatever it was, it didn’t feel like he’d won anything.  But, it was over.  It was over, thank God, and whatever happened now, Steve decided he would call that a victory.
“It’s not…Tony, that was a long time ago.  You’ve had a shock today.  You—you just need to give this time, and you’ll see.  You’ll think about it, and see.  You—you have this life, and I’m—how would I even begin to fit in there?  I don’t.  I don’t, and we both know it, you’re just…whatever you are about this,” Steve said with the same weary tone from earlier as he slowed to a halt outside his door.  “You’ve got this idea in your head that we can just…turn back the clock, and we can’t.  What happened, it was awful, and I hate it, for you, for me, for what you thought for all those years, but…come on, Tony, you gotta see that this was never going to be a happily ever after.”
“Would you win, if you entered?” Tony asked, tilting his head to the side and narrowing his eyes at the question.
. None of that’s okay, but I know.  It wasn’t him. He’s up on thirty-two.  Him and Nat, and no, I don’t know how I sleep at night, but here we are.”
“Yes,” Steve replied, swallowing hard.  A shiver of something that felt a bit like a warning working its way down his spine.  Like the way the hairs on his arm would raise just before a storm swept across the desert.  Electricity, he thought, seemingly apropos of nothing.
“That’s because you think you should be smart enough to control things that no one can control, and blame yourself when you can’t,” Steve replied, voice tight and thick.  “I wish you wouldn’t do that to yourself.”
“No, I got it. It's fine,” Tony replied without looking up from the table. He was such an idiot. Bless Steve for currently being either oblivious or too polite to call him on it. “You go ahead.”
There were countless other ways Tony tried to open his world to Steve and asked Steve to allow him in, as well. So much of this, so much of each other, was still new to both of them.  The demands of ruling and rebuilding that had kept Tony away during so many days after the battle with Pierce seemed to have lessened, or Tony simply made it so, Steve wasn’t sure.   He could tell it still wore on Tony, how much he had missed before the war, though Steve could hardly judge Tony for trusting the wrong people, all things considered.  Still, it was the common folk who suffered the most for the mistakes of powerful men, and Tony was all too aware of how much the Realm bled for his misplaced faith.
Tony’s gaze darted up to Steve’s face, watching a muscle tic in his jaw.  He wanted to look anywhere but at Steve.  It would be easier that way, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself from looking.  Behind him, he could hear the metallic thunk of a moth hitting the lightbulb and felt hysterical laughter welling up.  I feel you, buddy, he thought scornfully.
clothes, but, be that as it may…” Tony grinned.  “It’ll be a couple hours before dinner, so, take a break.  Hang out.  There’s food in the fridge and a full bar.  Help yourself,” Tony told him as the elevator doors opened to the suite.  “I’ve got to make some calls, and—Pepper!”
“Steve-Steve-Steve,” Tony was chanting and Steve felt a more insistent tugging at his hair, so he pulled back enough to mouth the head and suckle, lightly at first, then hollowing his cheeks to apply a harder suction, earning a shout from Tony, before swallowing the length down again and releasing his grip on Tony’s hips as the other man lost control enough to thrust in hard, rapid strokes against the back of his throat.  Steve felt the warm, salty rush spill down the back of his throat as Tony came, hips jerking a couple final times as Steve pulled off enough to swallow around Tony’s shaft before finally releasing it as it went slack.  He couldn’t help running his cheek along the side again, placing a light kiss as he went.  He felt Tony go boneless and slump over, head resting on Steve’s shoulder.
in.  Though, despite the light that led him up here, no one appeared to be in residence at the moment, Steve realized with a disappointed grimace. The room was empty.  Yet...
“Did they really?” Cam breathed out in awe.  “I should like to see them.  Grandfather and Grandmother fish, I should call them.  Do you think they would let me pet them and feed them?”
“Hear that?  Stranger danger,” Tony teased. “No taking candy from the nice men in the white news van.”
“So,” Tony said, this time leaning far more carefully against the chair and looking down a few times with a blinking, wide-eyed glance just to be sure he wasn’t going to slip off again.  “Don’t you just look like a bad coping mechanism waiting to happen?”
Steve swallowed thickly and felt the new weight of it, heavier than it had any right to be.  He wanted to run his hands over it.  He wanted to claw it off.
“There was nothing you could’ve done, Tony.  The medicine we had wouldn’t have done much of anything for me, and I couldn’t have kept any food down anyway.  There was no point in telling you,” Steve tried, he thought rather reasonably, but he wasn’t sure by the way Tony’s whole body stiffened.  It had seemed reasonable at the time, stuck up there in the cabin with no idea of what to do, but even now, only a week or so removed from it, it had already taken on some kind of a hazy, dreamlike quality, and he wasn’t sure how much had been his mind telling him what he needed to hear to handle the issue of Tony being injured while his own body systematically shut itself down.
That was...thoughtful, Tony supposed, in its own, somewhat self-serving, way. Let the Omega work out his nerves before you have to deal with a breakdown over things like the eight eggs it had taken Tony to make the damn omelet, which had not caused manful tears so much as a fit of pique that led to the unfortunate end of egg number nine, which he'd chucked as far as he could from the deck while Joshua chattered encouragement from the railing. Okay, probably that had been more like squirrel for, where's my fucking handout, you useless, food-tossing human, but Tony felt he could read between the lines.
“Okay,” Steve said.  Wormholes? He didn’t know what that meant.  Maybe it was like with the macramé. A test in a language Steve didn’t understand.  “Really?  Um, well,” he continued, trying to remember what he was supposed to be saying. Tony was still toying with the dog tags, holding them up just below his mouth and peering down at the letters.  Steve felt a hot rush of heat warm his skin, then settle low, and he realized he was half hard. He adjusted his jacket, drawing Tony’s eyes to him, and that was—not helping, Steve decided.
Tony followed Coulson’s gaze.  Stared for a long moment.  Then looked back up at Steve.  Really looked this time.  Beyond the wires and the tubes.  Beyond the blood and the way his skin looked marble-pale under the bright lights.
“Are you sure? We don’t have to do this,” Steve pointed out, leaning down to whisper the words into Tony’s ear.
“Guess you got this,” Rhodey said, standing up and bouncing a bit on his heels, eyebrows raising and a puff of air escaping his mouth.  “Whoo. So.  Sugar.  Good. Going to go, like, run home and maybe back again, then home, and I don’t know, do all my homework for the semester, then probably push-ups.  Pull-ups. Yeah.  Pull-ups.”
.  Yes.  Yes, I want that,” Tony stammered out in a shaky, breathy voice.  “Roll over for me, baby,” he added, nudging lightly at Steve and helping Steve shift onto his back.  Tony stretched up and planted his hands on either side of Steve’s chest, then leaned down and kissed him again, hard and fast.  “You’re gorgeous when you beg me for my cock,” he growled, nipping teasingly at Steve’s mouth and along his jaw until he nuzzled against Steve’s neck, breathing deeply. “Do it again.”
The phrase ‘mind blowing’ gets thrown around a lot, but Steve could honestly say this was the first time he felt like his brain simply exploded into a puddle of useless goo and took all his words with it.  Tony was really--he was actually offering to--it just didn’t quite compute for a moment.  404 error, file not found, Steve thought with a bit of giddy hysteria.  This was...something people did for pornos, not in real life.  Right?  But, here, Tony was just...casually offering. Like it was nothing. Like he
There were records though, if you knew what to look for and where to look for it. You had to read between the lines. Mingi, the cursed children who brought bad luck to some tribes in Ethiopia. The lost ones, they were called by some of the indigenous Pacific Islanders. Changelings in Irish folk tales. Filipino stories told of Aswangs, who sicken and die quickly. Around the world, cultures seemed to have some lore about it, these children who were born wrong. It probably didn’t happen all that often, but it must have happened enough to scare people, to make them create these explanations for something they couldn’t control and couldn’t understand. To give them an excuse for why these children were shunned, hated even. Worse, sometimes.
“I see that we do have an understanding, then.  Until next time,” Zola replied, dipped his head in mock deference and swept out of the room with his guards on his heels.  Steve waited until the lock clicked into place before turning to catch Cam’s wide-eyed stare.
“Not yet, but they aren’t going to be happy about this happening again,” Bucky said with a frustrated sigh.  “How’s your back?”
“No, no, nothing like that.  I just thought, maybe, this might be good for you.  Get out.  Live life a bit.  See what—and who—might be out there,” Natasha said.  “He’s nice.  Good.  Better than I think even he realizes.  I think you’d like him.”
Which, as it turned out, was hole fifteen, when one of the bachelorette party members in the group behind them hit a stray ball and knocked Steve’s ball out of the area of play and towards a row of claw machines promising a winner every time.  They’d run through Tony’s favorite movie—Raiders of the Lost Ark--favorite kind of food—New York pizza--his best childhood memory, an afternoon of building a pinewood derby car with his butler, which had taken far longer to answer than Steve would have anticipated,  and ended on his favorite way to spend his downtime on hole fourteen, when Steve figured Tony was one hole away from stomping his feet in annoyance, but he’d started the whole challenge thing, so Steve wasn’t going to feel guilty about using it to his advantage.
His phone? Oh.  Right. His phone.  The one he programmed, like all of the Avengers’ phones, to alert when one of them hit the emergency beacon.  The phone that had been in his pocket.  Of course, no one but another Avenger would recognize the beacon for what it was, but, well.  Here they were.
Steve’s thrusts sped up, then faltered, turned sloppy as he chased the sensation.  He looked down at Tony, who was watching him with wide, dark eyes.   Tony clutched Steve’s hand tighter, then, keeping his eyes on Steve, brought their joined hands up to his mouth and pressed a kiss against the back Steve’s hand at the same time his body bore down and clenched around the shaft of Steve’s cock.
“It’s even better inside.  You’ll like it,” Tony replied, and Steve could hear the fondness in his voice.  Steve supposed if he had a house like this, he’d be pretty proud of it, too.  Money could buy lots of things, but certainly not taste or the willingness to create something spectacular and beautiful.  And there was no denying what this house was.  Art.  Any other time and he’d be giddy to go inside and explore.  He turned to Tony to say something to that effect, but stopped himself when he found Tony’s liquid brown eyes staring at him instead of the house, seeming to drink him in and Steve blinked, caught off guard for a moment.  Of course, it was his house, so he was probably used to it by now.  It wouldn’t be a big deal to him.  No telling what he would think if Steve started waxing poetic about Gehry’s influence.
Okay, so, that was…well, shocking didn’t really begin to cover it.  Sure, Steve knew what he looked like now, and he knew Tony liked beautiful people and certainly enjoyed sex, but…hell, one of those Steves kept having to let Tony’s cock out of his mouth because he kept having to cough, for Christ’s sake.  Who fantasized about that?
“Grey Poupon!” Rhodey called out, holding up the small, yellow jar from the bag of assorted condiments.  “I’m putting this in my truck.”
“I’m betting you know more than I do about it.  I’ve been kind of…out of the loop you could say,” Steve admitted, looking down at his lap and lacing his hands together.  “Never been really good with politicians, anyway.   Always some butter and egg man behind him, you know?  Can’t trust a word they say.”
“Well,” Tony started, drawing out the word and giving Steve a long-suffering look. “Huge misunderstanding. Steve didn't take the money. He borrowed some from Howard. Paid it back, too, which, yeah, that grates. But, he's a stand-up guy like that. He got this crazy idea in his head that I was just working my way through the help or something, and there's a judge that I'm going to have to go all fire-and-brimstone on because there was a, ah—Jesus, Rhodes, there was a—a legal misunderstanding. Of the restraining order kind.”
“Sam sounds like a bright guy.  Believe it or not, I do understand.  Ask Rhodey.  Not the same as you, I know, but…going through the motions.  Isn’t that what they call it?  I don’t know what that means, but that seems right. Going through the motions,” Tony said, looking over at Steve.  “I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t think you do, either.  It’s harder for you, I know.  A lot harder.  I’m going to help.  We’ll get help, whatever help you need.  Therapy, surgery, a tiny Chinese woman to walk on your back, I don’t care, we’ll do it.”
“Sam’d say it better, I know, but that’s what it comes down to, man.  You’d say you’re coming to things, and then something comes up and you cancel.  You don’t reply to my texts or my voicemail.  Then there was that shitty email Brock sent,” Bucky said.
was good.  Being so good for Tony, even his mind spiraled through trying to catch the thread of pain or pleasure and finally grabbing on the end of both.
.”  Steve kissed him then, hard, purposeful and demanding, tongue rolling across Tony’s and sweeping into his mouth until all Tony could do was take it.
“The money.  Of course,” Tony said flatly, his face blank and unreadable.  “Not enough for you?”, Tony asked, his voice brittle and clipped.
Steve was watching him, quiet and still and far too aware.  His face was shadowed in the dim evening light, but Tony could see a line of muscle ticking in Steve’s jaw.  Steve’s eyes were dark pools, with just the faintest glare from the setting sun making pinpricks where his pupils should be, reminding Tony of the way light catches on the eyes of creatures you didn’t even know where there until it was too late. Steve had to know.  He had to. The car was small.  Suffocating.  Did he know?  Of course, he did.  He was probably just too polite to mention the fact that his Omega couldn’t control himself over one stupid kiss that wasn’t even a real kiss.
Dying didn’t hurt, really.  Not compared to the usual pain of living he had all but gotten used to. Maybe he was already so close to it, that it didn’t take much.  He felt the slip of sharp points into his skin, and then a heady exhaustion filled his limbs, liquifying them.  He felt like he was melting.  Just seeping into the ground like the day’s spilt milk.  Tony jerked his body against him, with a growl, then drew back, and Steve opened glazed eyes to the face of a monster with a blood-red rictus of a smile.  He stretched out a hand and ran it down Tony’s face, over his forehead, his eyes, his nose, and onto his lips, feeling the razor’s edge of Tony’s teeth.  He winced, and watched a bead of blood well up on his finger.  Tony hummed lowly, and sucked it into his mouth, eyes closing in ecstasy.
“How about we get you to bed?  You’re freezing,” Steve said, instead of actually answering.  Tony frowned at that.  Steve usually answered him, at least when Tony asked a direct question.  He wasn’t exactly the kind to dissemble, but Tony supposed there were probably rules about what Steve could and couldn’t talk to him about, at least regarding his work for SHIELD.  It bothered him anyway, rationalizations be damned.  Tony privately thought that part of Steve’s ability to tell the truth all the time came from simply not talking about shit he didn’t want to tell the truth about.
The man nodded, a bored, placid expression falling into place. “There’s an intercom if you need anything.”
“I do.  Okay, I don’t,” Tony corrected at Steve’s look.  “I’m learning.  Whatever it is, though, Steve, we’ll get through it.  Together.  We will.  I know, it’ll be hard, but--”
“Yeah, down an arm, though. IED,” Steve said with a slight grimace.  “He’s doing good, though.  Got married, and she’s fantastic. Really good for him, I think, being settled and all. Having someone like Nat. She was over there, too, so she gets it, I think, so that helps.  She was a defense contractor doing some kind of intel ops that she won’t talk about.  That’s how they met, actually. She was visiting the hospital to interrogate someone they brought in about a heroin shipment that went missing, and Bucky started flirting right there from the hospital bed with no arm, pins all in him, a catheter, head wrapped up in a bandage, you name it.  Didn’t stop him when he saw her, though.”
“I know. I do,” Tony vowed.  “Really.   I do.  Weird thing, you and me.  We always loved each other. So much.  It was…this incredible thing, right?  I didn’t know it could be like that, this Nicholas Sparks kiss in the rain bullshit, but then it happened, and, God, it was amazing. But, thing was, neither of us ever felt like we’re good enough for the other.  We loved each other, but not enough to see in ourselves what the other saw.”
Steve spent the rest of the day at the Met, for what he told himself was no particular reason other than a fondness for it and a desire to see the new exhibit on Goya’s drawings.  Talking to Tony about it made him remember how much he enjoyed it, even if he hadn’t been in ages.  Brock wasn’t what one would call an art enthusiast, and so it wasn’t something they did as a couple, and for whatever reason, Steve hadn’t come by himself, he realized with a slight frown.  Why hadn’t he come?  He couldn’t really remember, other than every time he mentioned it to Brock, the idea got shut down, and he just… hadn’t.  Well, time to change that, Steve thought firmly.  It was free, and he loved to wander around through the galleries.  It calmed him, or helped to provide a distraction, at least.
Steve had…just had enough.  Maybe it was because he had held Tony next him last night and told a story to distract him.  Maybe it was because Tony bought the men who worked the wheel or because Steve knew what was coming and couldn’t prevent that pain and maybe it was because Stone was an asshole.  He wasn’t sure
Tony had always thought there was so much of Steve he kept tucked away, hidden behind persona and uniform, but maybe it had been Tony who was hiding from it, he reflected as they thanked the Director and Tony shoved a check into her hand.  Had he wanted to see the part of Steve that talked in hushed tones to a grizzled, wiry-haired old man about the sounds of shells whistling through the air, or worse, the feeling of waiting for them, constantly being on alert, never able to relax?
Tony brushed past him without a word and opened the door to the limo.  He stopped, with one hand braced on the door and the other gripping the edge of the limo’s roof, back to Steve.  “Why are you here, Steve?” he asked, voice coming out resigned and heavy with an odd sadness.  Steve didn’t know what to make of that, but it was something.
“Please.  Ah, tell him that Steve Rogers called.  He’ll know what it’s about.  Tell him I have the money.  If he can get back with me on when it could be ready, I’d appreciate that,” Steve replied, giving her his phone number again for the hell of it.
“You know how I love to show my patriotism.  I could be patriotic all fucking day with that, I’m telling you,” Calhoun replied around a low, appreciative whistle.
“The nice man loved him back anyway. But both were very stupid, as people in love often are, and you should really know that ahead of time. It will save you loads of trouble.  Seriously, you have no idea,” Tony continued, earning a wan smile from Steve.
“Good, you’re here,” Tony called out, the words coming out garbled around the pin.  “I was just thin—”
“You really don’t think I’m capable of deciding what’s best for myself?” Tony demanded in a tight, pinched voice before he could stop himself.  “It’s my life.”
True, he hadn’t exactly jumped all over keeping that promise with his usual gusto, though he did have JARVIS running a modified version of Zola’s algorithm trying to track down the wayward killer while Tony wondered what his life had become.  He could tell Steve that, and watch Steve thank him with the dull sort of cool politeness that he used to thank Tony for being at the hospital with him or when he found out he lived in the Tower now.  The thing was, he was absolutely certain Steve was being completely sincere in his gratitude.
This wasn’t going to end well, he knew.  Ending well had left the building a long time ago. Tony looked up at the familiar features, formed into a frown of consternation now, and he never had good impulse control to begin with, and that was with things he didn’t want so damn much it hurt, so really, it was hardly a surprise, he thought with something akin to the resignation of someone facing a firing squad.  “I honestly have no fucking clue,” Tony replied, finding he actually meant it, then leaned up and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.
“Only because you’re too stubborn to just admit you’re stupid in love with Tony Stark,” Bucky retorted.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Steve snapped, head swiveling towards Tony.  His mouth flattened, and he sucked in a steadying breath, his face softening.  “There’s nothing wrong with you, Tony.”
“Well, in theory, anyway, portals, bridges, wormholes, whatever you want to call them, they aren’t really like roads, with people staying in their lane. They’re more like those revolving doors…once they start to move, they go in all directions at once,” Tony told him.  “You can go through, but anyone else can step on as it spins, and there’s nothing you can do to stop that without stopping the whole door.  But, problem.  Once its open, once its spinning and has people moving through it, that gets a lot harder to do.  A lot. You’re working against the movement—the energy—of the door, which is going and wants to keep right on going, because that’s what it does.  That’s all it does.  You can’t just wedge something in there and stop the energy. That would just stop the door from spinning, but it’s still open, see?  You’d have to—I don’t know—like, collapse it in on itself.  Basically, spin it so fast, it falls apart.”
“Is it okay if I put some water in my hands and then on your hair?  I was…well, I was thinking I’d wash it. I’ve kind of wanted to get my hands in it for a while now, but we don’t have to, Tony, honestly, it’s okay,” Steve said.
“You can’t…Obie, you can’t.  This would…” Tony stammered, his mind flashing to Steve’s face when he’d pulled out the wrinkled papers and shown them to Tony that night in Steve’s apartment.  “This would destroy him.”
Stane moved closer, and Steve could smell stale cigar on him, sickly sweet.  “I’d hate to see that happen to Tony, after all the hard work he’s done, wouldn’t you, Steve?  I hope I can count on you to do the right thing here.  For Tony.”
“I’m currently imagining ways to torture the cruel bastard,” Steve grumbled, then caught Cam’s shocked expression.  “I’m…I’m jesting, Cam. Mostly,” he amended, then smiled ruefully.  “I think…I think he might be.  Perhaps.”
The cords in Steve’s neck strained against the pull of the hook and the chains clasped to his nipples. Experimentally, he shifted his head just slightly. The metal hook in his ass tugged up, pulling at his rim with a sudden, stabbing pain. A heady rush of pleasure filled him, then retreated, like a wave lapping at the shore. He felt unmoored, free, and reached for it, that feeling waiting just on the other side of the pain.
Steve laughed, continuing to pack up the containers and clean off the plates, ignoring Tony.  “You can’t just leave it out.  It’ll go bad.  And I don’t mind, really.”
“So,” Natasha announced loudly, pulling Bucky hard enough to send him a bit off-balance and earn a laugh. “We’ll be going.  Steve, we’ll see you later.  Sam, Thor, you’re invited to dinner, too.  Bring Jane, she can talk to Tony when he’s not gazing longingly at Steve.”
need a hospital.  A tall, bald African-American man Tony recognized as the head of SHIELD swept in behind them, because why not? Tony tossed his hands up in the air and rolled his eyes towards the ceiling.
A silk robe hung on a hook next to the tub, so he put that on and let Cam call the attendants to empty the bath while Steve explored the rooms.  Taking one of the books off the shelf, he leafed through the pages, then stopped.  Stared wide-eyed at the intricate drawings that filled the pages.  Closed the book and put it back.  Pulling out another, he tried again, though with much the same results.  There was a small room across from the bath that was for an attendant, already strewn with food, clothes and a wooden game board and pieces.
“Might throw up on you, but I think I can make it,” Steve answered as he stood up. Or, Tony assumed he did. Hard to tell, Tony thought with a huff of a laugh.
Tony smiled up at him, bright and beautiful, the neon colors from the nearby washateria lighting up his face.  “I’ll take those odds.”
He gave Bucky the nearest cross-streets, and stepped out of the alley to wait under an awning that advertised the dry cleaner’s underneath.  Bucky kept talking to him, mostly about mundane things to do with his job or Natasha or their new apartment, which seemed to have been possessed by the spirit of an angry Victorian child, at least by Bucky’s estimation.  Steve knew Bucky was doing it on purpose, the constant chatter, keeping Steve on the phone and keeping him from changing his mind, but he still appreciated it.
“No, no. It was true. Or close enough to true not to really matter. So, this is me, trying to make it up to you, and maybe a little to him, too,” Bucky continued. A heavy, expectant silence fell between them, and for a moment, Steve wanted nothing more than to roll over and close his eyes without giving the answer he knew Bucky was waiting on, because saying it meant acknowledging that there was a chance it could happen, and it would be his own doing, like he had already jumped and there was no breaking the fall.
“You…you thought me and Bucky…you…you told Tony?” Steve sputtered, trying to wrap his head around everything whirling around in his head.
“God, fuck, Steve,” Tony gasped, eyes rolling back in his head as his hips bucked and fingers dug into Steve’s thighs.   “Oh my God.  Ngunnngh,” he moaned, tossing his head back as his eyes went wide and unfocused.  “Fuck.”
“You didn’t.  It’s fine.  I was…sleeping wrong, anyway.  So…ah.  Can I come in?  Or, you come out?  I’m…” Tony trailed off, suddenly unsure of what he was.  Steve was in the bathroom, which…okay, not weird, except it was, and Tony wasn’t sure why, but the skittering sound of screws that weren’t screws hitting the tile filled his brain and set off alarm bells that were just getting louder the longer there was a door between them.
“Guys, a little help here?” Tony asked, holding the toddler out at arm’s length again the moment Steve bobbled the handhold he had on the suit.
“They taste better because they once knew freedom, so it doesn’t have that guilty aftertaste,” Stark supplied without looking up from his phone.
Steve woke at dawn the next morning, as usual. He figured he should go ahead and take his morning run, keep to routine, but his head was too full of what Sam had said the night before about kissing Tony to do much of anything but roll off the sofa.  He found a spare shirt waiting for him outside the door to the bathroom, relieved that at least he wouldn’t have to make his way home wearing the entire uniform.  Keeping as silent as possible, he showered and changed, closing and locking the door to Sam’s apartment on his way out.  He could have taken a cab back to the Tower, but decided to walk it, try to clear his head.  He found himself replaying the scene from the banquet last night over and over in his head.  Tony had seemed…off, though he couldn’t quite place why.  After all, Tony had his “thing” last night, but that had never caused him any kind of embarrassment or fluster before.  If anything, the man usually strutted around in anticipation.  Yet…last night, Tony had definitely seemed oddly defeated, something that didn’t sit easily on his features, out of place where bravado and brashness usually warred with good sense.
“Blue!  That’s your color!  Haven’t I told you?  You finally listen when you have an Alpha, I see,” she said with a satisfied smile.  Him in blue. That was an accomplishment for her.  Not the “Army science person,” who was so impressed in twenty minutes of time with Tony, they were getting a contract out of it.  Tony sighed.  He was tired.  Tired of trying to get her to want him to be who he was.  She, at least, didn’t hate who he was.  It wasn’t like with Howard. She just…wanted him to be who
“You don’t watch the news?  It’s all they can talk about now.  Feds raided his place last night, apparently after receiving a download of his server with evidence that he’d been bribing military officers and politicians in return for Hammer Industries being awarded various contracts.  They found that and a lot more when they went out there.  Including some rather disturbing videos involving Hammer and others, including said big-wigs, enough GHB to start a factory, and some of those videos features several slightly under the age of consent boys.  Not from my agency, mind you,” she said quickly, as if that was the important point.
Steve bent his head lower and captured Tony’s mouth, meaning it to be little more than a reassurance, but it quickly turned to something else entirely as Tony’s lips parted and his tongue darted out to trace the curve of Steve’s bottom lip then press inside with a groan. Steve’s hands came up to cup Tony’s face as Tony’s tongue explored his mouth, the hot, wet heat of him sending spikes of pleasure curling in Steve’s belly. He wasn’t sure how far it would have gone, were it not for Happy’s polite cough from somewhere behind them. Steve tore his mouth away and looked over his shoulder, almost started to find the other men still kneeling there, waiting to be acknowledged, having forgotten all about them in his joy at seeing Tony.
The problem was, Steve eventually figured out, Tony had some idea in his head that Steve needed his first time to be perfect and special and apparently fall right out of one of those Nicholas Sparks books Clint read. Steve was tempted to hand Tony the one called “The Longest Ride,” and tell him it was his favorite. Good God, he could hardly believe himself lately.  It was all he thought about.  He’d thought it was bad before, when he was just pining, just wanting something he thought he couldn’t have, but now that it was something he could have, but was being withheld because of…scruples or something…it was exponentially worse.  He’d lost any sense of propriety, morals, restraint.  Restraint.  Huh.  What was he saying?  He put his head in his hands and scrubbed them through his hair, trying to clear his thoughts of Tony enough to focus, and then thank the good Lord above, there were rock monsters.  He’d never been so happy to hear the alarm.
“Look, I get that Howard screwed you both over.  Probably you more than Tony, which, I gotta tell you, was probably an unintentional oversight on his part,” Rhodey went on.  “And I know your head has got to be spinning with all this.  But, I had to watch this man try to get over you once, and I’m telling you, I’m not going through that again.  I’m just not.  He doesn’t deserve that.”
“In detail,” Pepper replied, her smile a bit too gleeful for paperwork, Steve thought.  “I’ll expect comments.”
“I’ve plenty to occupy myself with thanks to the poor recordkeeping of your army stewards,” Steve replied with a grimace, though, in truth, he was enjoying tackling the project, something Tony seemed to find strangely delightful.
Tony’s heart was pounding out a staccato beat in his chest, and he could feel his muscles go loose and quavering, no matter how much he told himself to calm down, nothing was happening, quit being like this.  It wasn’t rational, and he hated that, the idea that fear could so quickly overrule higher brain function, but here he was, shifting to flight mode like he was a Wright brother.
“Bouncer?” Rhodey asked incredulously.  “She’s like this big,” he said, holding his hand out to shoulder height.  Steve just shrugged.
Tony turned around and reached a hand out to wrap it around the edge of the front door.  One of the few changes.  Out of necessity, he thought, with a small, wistful smile as he remembered Steve propping the poor, splintered door parts against the frame the morning after their first time.   Steve found a serviceable replacement door at the local home improvement store.  This one, though. This one was dark oak, elaborately carved with floral swirls wrapping around pheasants, deer, and, at the top, two frolicking squirrels and a stack of acorns, which had sealed the deal.
looking.  He couldn’t tear his eyes away if he tried, and he never wanted to try, not while Steve was looking at him like that, with his eyes soft and dark, unbearably tender, the corners pulled down, a soft, sad smile curving the edges of his lips.
“Do I look busy?” Stark asked around a laugh, his whole body seeming to relax as he smiled and waved Steve over.  “Come here.  Got a picture of this guy on your phone?”
“Bonded,” Rogers offered when Tony stumbled over his words.   Try to control your excitement, Tony thought with a surprising amount of annoyance, but the thought fled as Tony looked up, blinking with something between panic and bitter disappointment as Rogers started to shuck his jacket.  Well, that nice-guy act didn’t last long, Tony had time to think before he realized that Rogers hadn’t actually remove his jacket, just opened it enough to tug something out of the collar.  A necklace, Tony’s mind supplied.  No, wait.  Dog tags.
Steve looked down at the stack of folders and flipped a thumb through the tabs until he saw one labeled ‘Stark, Anthony Edward, Age 17.’  He opened the folder. A large picture was on top, showing a handsome young man in a terrible suit, standing in some sort of living room.  He was smiling, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes.  Wide eyes, a dark, rich brown, and a mop of hair that someone had tried to flatten without the benefit of the Brylcreem Steve remembered.  Steve’s eyes stopped, caught on something. Narrowed.  He frowned.  Looked again.  A huff of a laugh escaped him.
“It really hasn’t been a bother,” Stark said.  “Actually, I’m finding this all rather...fascinating.  In fact,” he continued, glancing over at Brock.  “You know, Brick--”
like you’ve stumbled onto some Grail lore, for pity’s sake.  Dear boy, may I suggest that if you truly wish to know, you stop ruminating over the deeper meaning in your beverage container and tell your Alpha how much you like him?  You might find yourself surprised.”
Before, before, before, Tony mentally chanted.  Everything was before or after, and he hated that.  How this…this thing…had become some kind of line of demarcation for them.  Of course, Steve could draw him. Steve always drew him.  It wasn’t that he hadn’t
“Can we symbolically trash state forests next time?  I’ll give you a brochure and a sharpie. Go crazy,” Coulson suggested mildly.
? Him.  Tony.  For Captain America. His stomach rebelled with a wave of nausea.  The taste bile-flavored coffee filled the back of his throat.  He was going to be sick.  God, what had they done?
Why did Steve want to know about the circuit board he built when he was four or the music he liked—not the kind to clear his head, but the kind he
“I—but--do I just…” Tony stammered, taking the dangling chain for lack of anything better to do than just stare at it.  “Just go back home?”
“Let me guess.  You ‘weren’t hurt,’” Tony said quietly.  He was watching Steve closely, too closely, and it was almost too much for a flicker of a moment, but there wasn’t really anything to tell more than that, so didn’t add anything, just looked back down at the stars reflecting on the tops of his shoes and nudged at the toe with the tip of his golf club.    A shriek of laughter followed by loud whoops from the bachelorette group punctuated the heavy silence that hung between them.
“---and then, I come ‘round the corner, and there he is getting the shit kicked out of him by some Neanderthal three times his size soaking wet, and the obnoxious little shit has the gall to say “I could do this all day,” while literally wiping blood off his face with the shirt I know his momma got him for Church, and damn if I—oh, you have got to be kidding me,” Barnes broke off as he nearly skidded to a halt as he came around the top of the staircase to face Tony and Rhodey.
“Ach, see, our Captain always speaks the truth!” Dugan shouted triumphantly at Jones, a massive smile forming under his moustache. “So, what say you, Captain? Shall we ride on?”
, or—or what I’m supposed…how I’m supposed to do this,” Tony said.  “I hate it.  I hate all of this.  I don’t want to be like this.  I don’t want you to—to think I’m—I’m weak or—”
.  With--with MySpace accounts and Maxim subscriptions and stupid, kid peace sign bullshit, and you—I’m not good for throwing some guilt money at them, okay?  Don’t—just don’t.  I didn’t do it because I’m good.  I did it so I could maybe sleep a few hours a night,” Tony said, raking his hand through his hair.  “And it wasn’t even anything.  Not to me.  What, an hour of interest on some hedge fund, and barely that,” he laughed bitterly.  “So, don’t tell me that it was
“I’m just saying, it’s polite.  We’ve been gone, what, like…okay, a little over an hour. Shut up.  He’s stuck there with grown-up Sid or something, I just want to—seriously, you two are no help,” Tony scoffed.
“It was just a one night thing, that was all there was to it.  I promise, that was one hundred percent all there was to it.  Or will be.  Besides, he’s… like, way out of my league,” Steve told him, letting his gaze fall from Bucky’s far-too-understanding one.  “
“This what you wanted, Tony?” Steve asked, humming out the words in a low, husky voice.  “Is this what shaft you thought about that night?”
“Not you,” the guard said.  “Just him,” he told Zola, nodding at Steve.  Zola shot an annoyed look at Steve, but bowed and murmured some politeness as the door closed in his face.  “In there,” the guard told Steve.
“These people who have not found you for going on seventy years? Those people? Because I have to tell you, I’m not willing to roll the dice on that one, Steve,” Tony balked.
“I think we need to talk, Tony,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice even as he watched the muscles of Tony’s back tense and shift as he dug his knuckles into the table.
He sucked harder, drawing Tony’s cock deeper into his mouth, wanting more.  He flicked and teased with his tongue, then let his teeth scrape ever-so-gently along the path of the vein that throbbed on the underside.  Tony let out a muttered curse, and the hand on Steve’s jaw clenched, then tugged, urging him to open wider.
Tony pursed his lips and blew out a long sigh. Who are we trying so hard to convince there, Tony, he asked himself with a blunt sharpness, as he wiped a hand over his face and looked at the digital clock next to the bed.
“How do--how do you know that? How do you know about my mother?  How do you know--” Steve demanded, shoulders hunching as he looked warily up at the man.
That was the thing that made Steve’s insides squirm in mortification and seem to heat until they melted.  Pulses of pressure sparked down into the shaft of his cock, building, building, building against the head.  And still, Tony knew.  It was the most wonderful, awful, mesmerizing feeling. He didn’t know what to do, and for a moment, he could feel the edges of panic set in.  He blinked at Tony. Licked his lips under the veil. Swallowed. His throat was parched. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears.  He needed something. He had no idea what.  No words would come. No request formed. No entreaty. All his plans for what he would do when he was finally alone with Tony were gone, and there was just…too much. Too much to feel. Too many thoughts in his head.  Too many things he wanted.  He didn’t know what to do. A soft, involuntary cry escaped him.
“Looks like you’re stuck with me, Shellhead,” Steve said, giving the creature a slight smile.  “At least until rescue arrives. Which, based on our current tally of ships sailing past...might be a while.”
.  It wasn’t funny, none of this was, but he found himself laughing, high-pitched and giggly, the way a child laughs when they’ve been caught doing something naughty, not that he had ever laughed like that when he’d been caught as a child, oh no, oh no, that wouldn’t have ended well.
“Not a fan of Obadiah, I take it?” Peggy asked, mouth curving into a small smile.  “Daniel despises him, too, but Howard always trusted him. Not that Howard was the best judge of character,” Peggy added in a hushed voice as they waded into the crowd.  She looked up at him, catching his surprised look. “What? You were never very good at subtlety, you know. You look like you’re ready to grab one of those silver platters the waiters are using for the crudites. Now, off with you.  I’ll find a few old friends to keep myself entertained. When you’re done, come remind me that I have an early morning meeting at the Pentagon.”
“Okay, you say that, but there are actual rules about this, and they are the police, so, I don’t know why they’d care that you said it was fine.  I mean, excuse me, Officer, but my Alpha thinks this is just dandy, so screw your laws is not an actual defense, last I checked,” Tony argued.  “This was a stupid idea.  Can we just forget I said anything?  I don’t know what I was thinking.”
Right.  He was supposed to talk.  Convince Tony this was a good idea.  Steve had imagined this moment over and over in his mind, played out all kinds of scenarios, but he hadn’t known, then, what it would feel like. He hadn’t known that Tony’s happiness would be this strange, brittle, breakable thing that held Steve’s own.
Steve’s own words, reflected back to him.  God, what a mess, he thought, feeling his chin dip down to his chest and his eyes drift shut.    “It wasn’t your fault,” Steve said.
So, they had trudged down the path where steep steps formed out of stone like the spine of some great, skeletal beast. Centuries ago, the king had them carved into the cliffs that led directly to the Castle, and some time after that, the entrance had been connected to the King’s Walk, so rulers could come and go at their leisure.  General Rhodes said this was to give the King an escape route in time of attack.  Tony claimed, with an impish gleam in his eye, that it had truly been done so that his great-great-great-grandfather could bring in dozens of young concubines under the nose of his much older husband, a devoutly religious man who served the stone gods and did not approve of the young king’s appetites.
Big and ugly and stupid, that was him, Anto repeated to himself as he walked.  Except…the Stranger looked like him. Not exactly, of course—he was dark-haired and dark-eyed and his face was smooth, the way an Omega’s was supposed to be, though he could grow a beard, unlike the clan Omegas, who were all bare-faced, though he kept his face carefully shaved.  But the basic features were the same. And Anto didn’t exactly think the Stranger was ugly anymore. Just different. Sometimes, when he thought about it late at night as he lay in his furs, sometimes he even thought the Stranger was pleasing to look upon, with his water-eyes and hair the color of the sun.
There is a path through the mountains, he thought, holding back a sob. He could see the ancient map in his mind’s eye. It’s the only path there is.
“Master Zola said you are to stay here, now, and since I’m to take care of you, I stay here, too,” Cam said with the matter-of-factness of youth.  “I have my own room, just back there,” he added, turning and pointing with a wide grin.  “With a bed and a window and everything.”
Tony clicked the messages app and an unknown number appeared with a short message on the screen below.
“I’ll go,” he heard Steve say, his words echoing in the parking garage, reeking of such shame and humiliation to make Tony’s gut twist.
“You wanted to be more than what everyone saw when they looked at you,” Stark said quietly, then brightened, as if a switch had been flicked.  “Let me guess, just a pretty face?  I get that.  You got the whole big, blond, perfect…everything going.  Probably could hear the hearts breaking in Brooklyn the day you signed up.”
“You beg so prettily, can you blame me?” Tony chuckled.  “Eat. Then ring for Cam. He was already skulking about the hallway this morning when they brought the food.”
“Forget it. Doesn’t matter,” Tony replied, waving his hands in the air in front of him.  “So, swimming? You swim, right? I’ve given mouth to mouth to a dummy before, but that wasn’t exactly Red Cross certified, so…”
Steve vaguely remembered passing through the gate on his way into the city, watching a monkey delight a gaggle of children and collect coins in reward.  A small, bitter laugh escaped him, causing Cam to look his way, though he shook his head and dropped his eyes down from the bright burn of the sun on the rock.
“You—I didn’t, ah.  I didn’t realize you were so involved,” Steve said carefully, because, of course, Stark
“It wasn’t your fault, either, Tony,” Steve said quietly, doing that Vulcan mind-meld thing Steve sometimes did with him.  “You make weapons, which help keep our soldiers safe.  You don’t make decisions about whether to fight or who to fight.  You’re not responsible for every terrorist who ever went shopping on the black market.”
“No, it’s fucking not, quit givin’ me an out!  You were there, the whole time, taking care of me, making sure I got everything I needed, and then me and Nat got together, and I look back and I see it happening, and I’m so fucking mad at myself because I wasn’t there.  I wasn’t there when you needed--so if you need to stay on my fucking couch, then--”
It was acceptable to be in the gym at five in the morning.  Showed dedication. Four was too early, he’d learned. Four concerned people.  They asked if he was getting enough sleep. If anything was wrong.
Natasha moved past the two of them and dug keys out of her purse to unlock the door, making Tony think of Steve’s struggles with the lock.  Which were not his concern.  At all.  And he wasn’t. Concerned. Just, you know, an observation.  That’s all.
“When, exactly, did your involvement with Mr. Stark begin, Captain Rogers?  You two seem to have quite the entangled history. Did you turn down the Medal of Honor because of the videos that are circulating?  Or because you lost half your unit trying to find your boyfriend and then conveniently walked out of what others described as an impossible situation with his location?” another reporter demanded.
“Perhaps something to say thank you with?” the salesman suggested, holding up a diaphanous red nightie, edged in lace and draping open in the front in a swish of fabric.  Tony stared at it for a second, waiting for the horror to come, but instead, there was a rush of wistful sadness.  He blinked at the sudden stinging at the corners of his eyes and looked away.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked softly.  He heard Tony let out a long sigh, then felt the bed shift as Tony rolled over and rested his chin on Steve’s chest.
Of course.  Of course, T’Challa had those things, and of course, Steve couldn’t very well carry the cartridge with him.  He made no move to hand it back, though, just stared at the letters and numbers on the pieces of tape, the way they curved and scrolled so neatly across the labels.
“Offshore accounts,” Tony explained.  “Turns out, my little foray into tracking down where our friendly judge was keeping his ill-gotten gains rather panicked Obie.  I couldn’t find anything that connected the judge to S.I., but I had JARVIS keep looking.  Lift up enough rocks, and you’ll find something.  That whole subsidiary was a front for laundering money.  Money that Obie was getting under the table for selling our weapons to the highest bidder, then hiding in offshore accounts down in the Cayman Islands.”
“Always,” Steve whispered, leaning his forehead down to touch Tony’s, then catching himself and remembering the bump on Tony’s head.  “Sorry,” he winced, gingerly brushing the hair back from Tony’s head to place a kiss just to the right of the bump.  “Doctor,” Steve said sternly.
It had been his design, but it didn’t matter.  None of this small-talk, kumbaya, we’re all adults here, let’s be bygones, bullshit mattered.  He needed to get out of here and away from Steve before Rhodey’s words from earlier became prophetic.  It was too easy, slipping back into this groove with Steve.  He was skating way too close to some edge that if he fell over, he'd probably never manage to crawl out again.  It had been hard enough the first time.  Rhodey was right.  He couldn't do this again.
“I don’t want to live my life not doing the things I want to do, even if everything isn’t exactly the way I’d want it, I suppose is what I mean,” Steve continued, his voice dipping low and soft.  He wasn’t sure if he was even talking to Shellhead as much as himself anymore, but it felt like it needed to be said.
“Well, you’re here now, and generally being annoying. Have I thrown you across the room? Yet?” Tony muttered, watching the numbers on the elevator’s screen count up. “Granted, I kind of want to just on principle and because Steve was apparently really impressed by that and the whole armor thing definitely left an impression…” Tony continued.
“Just the handsome ones,” Steve quipped.  Tony gave a low bark of laughter and went back to eating his dinner, though some of the tightness had drained from his face.
“Oh, well, that’s, I mean, he’s paid, so-wait. What?” Tony asked, blinking up at Steve in confusion.
With your mouth, Steve remembered, and leaned forward, letting his tongue dart out to catch those last few, precious beads from the head of Tony’s cock.
Steve started to gently rock his hips, lifting slightly as he rode Tony, slowly at first, then harder, gyrating his hips as he lifted himself up and sank back down.  He shifted slightly, angled his hips experimentally and thrust down, and oh!  His mind whited out. A shout tore from his lips, then a moan as he repeated the motion.  His own cock tingled and throbbed where it bobbed in front of him, dotting Tony’s tunic with fluid and occasionally rubbing at the soft material as Steve moved.
“We didn’t dance,” Tony blurted out.  “At—at the thing.  We didn’t dance.  We were going to—you—you said.  But, well.”
“Most people don’t get too many second chances,” Steve continued.  “I don’t know why we did, but I’m going to take it. Can you really blame me?  You want to know about Gulmira? The truth is, what I can tell you of it, anyway, is that we were out there doing our jobs. Yes, we went in looking for information on Tony. That was what every unit in the dirt was doing after he was taken, and we weren’t any different,” Steve explained.  “When you suggest that mission was some kind of—of plot or stunt, I think about the faces of the people there who had been helping the coalition forces until we abandoned them to the Ten Rings. About the pictures of their loved ones they shoved in our faces, wanting to know if we had any idea where they were.  I think about my friend, who came home without an arm. About my other friends, who weren’t that lucky. Their families got dog tags, a folded flag and the apathy of a nation that doesn’t seem to want to hear about any of this anymore.”
Tony thought he might see Steve again before they left, but Coulson explained there was an “ongoing situation in Bogota,” which apparently required his Alpha’s undivided attention.  He told himself to be glad of the extra time to adjust, but not seeing Steve again just made the whole afternoon seem that much more surreal.  He was Bonded, he’d choked down a suppressant over a toilet in the middle of SHIELD, and now he was being whisked away to what was probably Site B.  He should have Coulson take a picture so they’d know what he was last seen wearing, but it was too horrifying to contemplate that he might literally be caught dead in this, he mentally groused.  By the time he and Coulson were ensconced in the back of a large, black sedan, his headache was back in full force, pounding steadily at his temples like something was trying to crawl its way out.
