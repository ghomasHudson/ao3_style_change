“Yes, it is,” Replied Sherlock as he watched John’s reaction as he proceeded to suck back down the dildo. Sherlock lowered his hand to his ass and he started fingering his hole as he loudly moaned around the dildo.
John snapped out of his moment of slight terror and self loathing, and realized that Sherlock seemed to be very much on board with hooking up, he wasn't quite sure if he got any new info on the flat mate front. He enthusiastically joined Sherlock in the rutting against each other. It was rather thrilling to do this out in the open, should any one passing by the alley just look to their side they would see them in all their rutting like a pair of teenagers on the dance floor who would probably get pried apart by a priest any second. John grabbed Sherlock by his collar and kissed him intensely, it was pleasurable but occasionally there would be a slip and a quick jolt of pain before it ramped back up to pleasurable.
Sherlock kissed John back, and smiled at John, “well you are stuck with me too. And let’s say it was today, because I rather enjoyed my summer at CalTech back when I was at Cambridge, that school’s lab was a little too permissive in my experiments and I’m sure Lestrade’s daughter would enjoy herself... what is she studying because until this moment I was unaware of this daughter. And not only that we get to upset those idiots while we are at it.
“Of course, you would say that you dirty, slutty boy, you’d do anything to get your hungry hole filled,” teased John as he only inserted a single finger to the first knuckle stroking Sherlock’s entrance before pulling out. He slapped Sherlock’s ass “you know what? I think you have been awfully spoiled today and should take a break; that way you can appreciate everything I give you.”
not only skipped the conversation but they went queerly forward to being one of those annoying couples who refuse to let go of each other’s hands in crowds. And before they knew it, they stood on the doorway of Baker St.
“Yes I think we can be assured that bottoming is now firmly in the green column now,” Replied John, “how was topping for you?”
A continuation of Chapter 6, William's dads make a discovery and decide to leave for the night, while William and Phineas spend the rest of William's 16th birthday together.
John slowed down Sherlock’s descent to the floor. He left Sherlock on the ground as he walked his bags in and closed the door behind him. He started to rummage around his bag and pulled something out.
Mycroft tried to twist and flip John but John managed to wrap his legs around his head, and kept him pinned down.
He did enjoy Sherlock’s gear, he wore leather pants, a plain black button up shirt that looked really soft and was so sheer that you could make out the details of Sherlock’s body if you looked hard enough and a leather jacket, he topped off the whole outfit with leather military hat. He looked ridiculously handsome and almost at home in the clubs they were frequenting for the case. John couldn’t stop staring at Sherlock, he felt bad because he messed up a few needle sticks when he was undercover as an HIV tester because he couldn’t stop thinking about Sherlock’s ass in those pants. John knew Sherlock wasn’t like that, all he cared about was the game, he only saw his body as transport, why would he even get saddled down by the idea of sex.
Sherlock gets a visit from Irene and the girls, John gets a visit from a mysterious stranger, and a warm welcome is had at 221B Baker St.
“Yes, we are quite alone,” Said Sherlock as he pushed the man against one of the heating units. Sherlock smiled as he sunk to his knees in front of the older man. Sherlock mouthed at the older man’s crotch. He pulled back, and looked up at the older man, as he reached for the man’s belt. He suddenly felt his head being held by the older man.
sorry it took me so long to update... I mean let's be real I am actually writing this as a weird little exercise in getting through my CPTSD, I had a nasty habit of maladaptive day dreaming. Focusing it and making it a story, makes it easier to manage. And the thing is these past couple of months I have found my self not slipping as much as I used to thanks to the fact that I am doing new things in an attempt to move past all my trauma. But believe me all this is going somewhere.
"I mean of course you are proud of them all, but we don't know know what Mycroft does other than taking after Uncle Ruddy and I am still not sure if my brother was a malevolent or benevolent force in he government, that boy does seem to keep so many secrets. Sherlock well, we don't need to brag about him, his roommate does that enough and I mean it does make the conversations easier since we aren't the ones who started it," said Siger quite earnestly.
“No,” Said John standing up ramrod straight he dug into his military train to give his posture an air of meaning business.
John sighed, "Sherlock I think you are having Absence Seizures, Ella pointed them out during the appointment today, but we've all been seeing you spacing out a lot more lately. I mean I thought it was just you going into your mind palace, but the more I see, the more I think Ella is right, you are going to need to see a neurologist."
Mycroft laughed, he thought about how Eurus would be able to live after the program. He thought no supportive housing in all of the U.K. would be able to handle her. But then he thought about what if Eurus lived with the parents and who would she live with when they passed on. He certainly didn't want her, but he wondered if Sherlock would. Sherlock was always visiting her and he seemed to be the only one to reach her for a while. He laughed as he imagined John and Sherlock with that child trying to live with Eurus. Oh g-d the violins alone would be insufferable. Or friends, she didn't have friends, the Holmes children don't make friends. John was just some fluke for Sherlock. He laughed further at the idea of Eurus just using her trust fund and living on her own, he didn't like that idea either, that was much too dangerous an option.
Sherlock looked at Jeanine as she refilled his cups once again, “I wasn’t bored.” He gulped down the water in his cups.
Well after every big team effort there must be a debrief meeting to figure out what worked and what can be better. Someone in that group was about to get de-boxerbriefed.
After he put on the hood, he did immediately get a comfortable weight on his head that at least dampened the constant buzzing feeling in his head. Which was something he actually struggled to feel often and to have it dulled so easily was actually a bit amazing. When he started focusing on acting like a dog, he found himself able to actually clear his mind. It was all very unusual for him, and he actually liked it. He figured that this was something he could just do in the privacy of his room and no one would have to know. He especially didn’t want John to know, because despite moving back in with him with his daughter in tow, he still felt like he could still loose them despite John’s attempts to assure him otherwise. He didn’t want to make John feel uncomfortable in anyway and he wasn’t sure how John would react to the pup hood, so he kept it to himself. He was already on high alert for trying to make John feel absolutely comfortable because he felt bad for still indulging in some fairly graphic sexual fantasies about John, that he knew could never happen because John certainly exclaimed enough times that he wasn’t gay.
Sebastian laughed "sorry John, but there is a whole lot of gambling going on this. Oh and just to be get all the answers at this point, is Sherlock a top, bottom, or verse. And can he deep throat? Like this is a gambling pool running since 2002, and he is the only variable stopping us from picking a winner, not that it matters the interest alone on the betting pool has been amazing. I mean we started with £10,000 the pool money is now £42,500.
Violet and Siger looked at each other and nodded. Violet replied, "that sounds doable, what do you think Mycroft? Sherlock?"
"Sorry about that, I tend to slip up on non-binary terms, but I always got to keep working on that, because just because I am Trans doesn't stop me from still messing up with other trans and non-binary folks," said Blaze as he stared at the ground.
He had come home from a rather stressful day, and he found himself on the edge of a meltdown. Fortunately John and Rosie wasn’t home yet, so he was able to just enjoy the feeling of pup-ping out, to the point that he found himself napping. But he suddenly snapped out of it when he felt a weight sink down into his bed. He opened his eyes only to find that John was on his bed closely observing Sherlock. He immediately recoiled and made to removing the hood, but John stopped him.
John reached out for Sherlock's hand, which was balled up in a fist, john's hand hovered for a second as is silently asking permission. Sherlock opened his hand and took hold of john's, their fingers interlocked. Sherlock's frown broke out to a small smile, he started sit a bit more taller in his chair, as if holding John's hand made him a bit more confident. He pulled their hands closer to himself, John being a much shorter man henceforth shorter arms had to shift over closer to Sherlock's side to the point that john ended up sitting shoulder to shoulder with Sherlock.
John grabbed Sherlock and tossed him back over the edge of the bed. He couldn’t think of a way he could easily toss Sherlock fully on to the bed because he was just too long for John to handle like that. “Come on Boy, all fours! UP!”
“You are being quite silly, I’d say foolish but I feel like you actually mean well with your begging, Sherlock,” Said John with a smile, gently jabbing Sherlock as they walked side by side.
Sherlock reached out for John's hand and closed the distance. "John I am doing absolutely fine and I really am glad you came back. Just so you know you can always talk to me, but I am not going to make a fool of myself by thinking I am going to be the one you can turn to for everything you want to talk about, but know that I really do care about you. I am proud of the fact that you are able to reach out to the other people." He turned his head and kissed John's hand and also kissed Rosie on the top of her head as she nestled in closer to Sherlock. "Well we might as well get little Watson ready for bed."
Siger frowned, "You have to admit that seems like it could be fun, talking about the kids with our colleagues, I mean to the point that it is exhausting for others to hear."
"Yeah sure we can always have more," one of them grabs a bottle, "holy shit, this is some quality stuff." He overturns the bottle of scotch, "we'll drink to your good health and further success in keeping sober." The group of young men laugh.
“Well. see. you. soon.” said Mycroft in clipped down tone that caught the total lack of enthusiasm for the situation.
John remembered the family they met during one of their recent cases, where it was a couple that Sherlock was uncharacteristically nice to engaged in something called Pup Play. The wife was apparently the handler and John found it fascinating how she described taking care of her husband when he was in the mindset of a pup. He had to admit the idea of training Sherlock to actually make motions for attempting to make his needs known and some behavior training was appealing. So when he found Sherlock in a pup hood, he immediately wanted to care for him. He also felt a little bad because he felt that Sherlock looked extremtly attractive in his relaxed state.
"You really need to give that woman a raise, I mean look at what she does to survive in this city," said Blaze with a tone that was a cross between indignation and judging, but not really because he wasn't about to judge someone over being a pro-Domme.
“Darling,” Said Irene as she delivered a sharp jab at Sherlock, who whirled around to face Irene. She held up a brown bottle, “it’s on the house. Do you know what to do with this thing?”
“Why would I ever want to do that, John?” Said Sherlock as he slowly pulled away from John’s kiss. He started to walk to the entrance of the alley.
He decided to take himself to Ella Thompson's flat. It was part of a duplex in a quiet neighborhood, Mycroft had an easy time parking. It seemed empty, it was 10pm and her spending reports showed that she went to the movies every Saturday and from her social media, her time of choice would put her prime time to   the movies would be at the hour, and given that she lived alone according to the report. Mycroft assumed that he could easily enter the home, glance through the records, and leave before she even came back. He looked again at the records, which showed that she paid for a ticket to a 9:30 pm showing of some action film, so he knew that he had plenty of time.
“You are very loyal, very fast. And your sister managed to land herself in rehab herself, so what makes you think you can keep my brother from relapse,” Said Mycroft glaring at John.
He approached his sister, “Hey Harry, I was looking for you. Are you...” John stepped back as Harry tossed the drink at his face.
John flipped Sherlock over and kissed him softly, he placed his full body weight onto Sherlock and that smeared the mess all over the two of them, as they started to kiss a little harder. John nipped at Sherlock’s lips before he licked his way into Sherlock’s mouth, their tongues just lazily meeting each other. John felt like Sherlock was reading him because Sherlock was doing everything just right, and he thought that just made sense. After all if Sherlock could figure out John’s life story just by looking at him, he could probably figure out what John liked physically. Eventually his shoulder started to bother him so he just rolled off Sherlock and they both found themselves panting for air.
John and Ella sighed. "You didn't deserve it, i should've used my words but at the time I didn't know what to say. I have been mindful ever since, and I struggle but I have to be better because it isn't just us, there is Rosie too, she doesn't need to live with that. I lived in that kind of household I about to put her through that too," said John. Ella nodded, acknowledging John's words.
Mycroft ascended the stairs and waited at the door. He sighed and tapped his umbrella against his leg because he really didn't want to do this. "Sherlock how long does it take for you to open a door."
John started licking broad strokes all over his chest. He pulled back out of Sherlock’s arms, he pulled out a set of gloves from his holster, and smirked as he put them on under Sherlock’s questioning gaze. He opened another packet of lube, and drizzled it over his hands.  He slammed Sherlock against the wall behind them, and used his knee to spread Sherlock’s legs, he reached a hand behind Sherlock’s  and started stroking that soft spot behind his balls and occasionally brushing against Sherlock's asshole. John sucked in a deep breath when he felt Sherlock pushing down on his hand. John inserted a finger slowly in, enjoying the sounds coming out of Sherlock, he was incredibly responsive and john was in awe that he was making Sherlock come apart like that. John wondered if he could be so distracted that he forgets the count. He inserted another finger into Sherlock, gently stretching him open. John laughed as Sherlock's knees buckled and Sherlock hissed at the scrape of the brick down his back. John hooked his fingers, pressing against his prostate, Sherlock gracelessly flailed pressed his weight against John.
John replied, "not a problem at all, we should be back home by 3:30, but that's around Rosie's nap time, so if you want to be around while Rosie is awake and playful, I'd suggest swinging by  around 5."
Sherlock quickly rolled over onto his chest and pushed himself up into a kneeling position, he ripped the hood off his head and grabbed John as he was trying to leave. “No John, please stay, I would more than welcome it,” Said Sherlock with a rather wide smile. He tentatively leaned into John’s personal space and held back mere centimeters from his face.
Her oldest brother, Francis, and his fiancé, Joey, was showing off an inspiration board with the plans for their wedding, they wanted a huge wedding and decided to have it in San Francisco that way, the majority of Joey’ family didn’t have to travel far. They sped up the wedding process despite being together since 2009, and open about it since the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in 2011. They were taking their time with the whole marriage process because Francis wanted to become an Legal Permanent Resident first, and that process was indeed a long one when you don’t have a job that could issue visas or anyone who could legally sponsor you.
Sherlock smirked, "I can surprise you sometimes." He disposed of the bag and did a quick run up to 221b to wash his hands with Toby following him up. He promptly returned to John, Rosie, and Kayla on the curb.
John paused his door was already open, he knew he locked it in his rush to get out with Sherlock because he didn’t want the front desk person to pack his stuff for him should the management decide to kick him out. He knew the laws changed and it was no longer that DADT bullshit, but he knew there was a good chance they would pull some other reasoning to kick him out.
Rosie waved enthusiastically at the two of them. "Daddy! Sherlock!” She yelled as she ran to them. She pointed at building. “Puppies!”
John nodded and ran after Sherlock, "maybe we should get Rosie first that way we can be sure to get a dog that gets along with her."
But as she just kept finding new ways to do things to keep up her end of the bargain made at the Farm, Eurus promised to get her out, but she had to come back for her. One could easily assume that Eurus was one of the kids who died in the fire, but deep down Aithne thought that Eurus was too smart for that. But she thought 25 years in a secret compound that wasn’t supposed to exist might mean that the Eurus she knew was not the Eurus on that island. Would Eurus even remember her. Did Mycroft remember her? Was that why she was contacted? She smirked, she knew that her house was one of the best programs out there even if it was a bit flying by the seat of their pants at times. She rather liked all of her clients and she did root for them she wanted them to live their best life. Eurus on the other hand always thought it funny to make the other kids at the Farm do what she wanted, and sure it was funny but Aithne always thought such a power can be used for such terrible things, especially when you throw in the inevitable problems that comes with being isolated for so long. She read more of Eurus's file and she saw what Eurus made so many people do to themselves. She smirked, Eurus got really good at her little trick. Maybe if she could use it for good, there would be some real amazing stuff right there. She laughed, oh the terrible mind feedback loops she could break.
"Yeah didn't you always keep him as a house mate no matter what happened, because you and all the other folks in the house , thought his existence in your lives as a bit of a confidence boost... until grades time rolled around," said Aithne. "That man was always getting his hands on coke or whatever other stimulant he could get his hands on."
“I hope you remember the count, private, otherwise we’re done,” said John as he took Sherlock in hand, and squeezed hard. He delivered a stroke in sync with his fingers thrusting against Sherlock's prostate. He delivered some hard bites to Sherlock's neck and chest. John was rather pleased at all the marks that Sherlock's skin took on. He would love to add more, if the bites left marks he could only imagine what a flogger or crops would leave, he would make such a pretty canvas.
“What do you mean by that?” Exclaimed John looking at Mike. “I think i’ve had enough adventure for an entire lifetime.”
“Fantastic, well maybe we can meet up for a pint sometime, but Sherlock and I have to get to business,” Said John with a rather bright tone. He slammed down the phone and turned to Sherlock. “Okay you know what let’s just double the punishment for now because I lost count of everything wrong in the fridge alone. But next time remember I do include the fridge and cabinets when it comes to my definition of cleaning the fridge. I am just being nice for now, and you are really pretty when you are desperate like this.”
John nodded, “That does sound like something you would do. Well do you want to try doing something about it?”
John smiled at Sherlock, “yes I am still very much into the flat.” The internal voice of John tossed in an “into you as well”. He was hoping with the intense gaze that he was receiving from Sherlock meant that he maybe open to hooking up or more... “Shall we check it out right now,” said John.
“You know what dad, it was a pretty great birthday. And don’t worry papa I am pretty sure it was obvious that my friends absolutely ate it up.” he hugged his dads and went up to his room.
"Oh I thought his name was Dandy? And he is personally on my payroll, I'll adjust his rates immediately," said Mycroft now seriously wondering if he is underpaying all his support staff, and how should he go about correcting it. Wait was he misnamming all of them?  "That doesn't need to be part of the wager."
"Can you maybe try to watch where you are going?" Said John bouncing a scared Rosie on his knee to calm her down from the suddenly scare.
“One!” Said Sherlock and he brought a bite of food to his mouth and chewed, he opened his mouth to John and showed that he swallowed the bite. “two!” Sherlock repeated the process. Somewhere around bite number 10, Sherlock slowed down as he remembered just how much this reminded him of being out in the countryside, the doctors always insisted on checking that Sherlock wasn’t cheeking the meds. Unfortunately during med time there was no way he could dispose of the meds without swallowing. He spent a week trying forcing himself to vomit, but a rather annoying doctor placed “potential bulimia” on his chart. And the staff was suggesting a feeding tube would come into play if he didn’t stop. So he stopped with the vomiting.
Mycroft was in his shitty little sedan, distracted by the fact that he was so sloppy during his match against Ella, he knew he was better than that. He knew he was better, why didn't he do better. He could feel the seams of his composure ripping, he wanted to ask all those questions but now he had to pick just one. He turned on the car stereo. And pulled out his MP3 player, he usually preferred to listen to classics with he occasional dive into contemporary orchestra, much harder to hide subliminal messages or secret frequencies into them. But sometimes when he just had to have a good scream he played music that would seem at place in a car that was about to exhibit the behavior he was just about to do. Hmm he swiped through his play list, and picked a playlist full of songs with a ridiculous amount of bass. He cranked the stereo up and let the subwoofer hit such ridiculous levels that windows were shaking.
Sherlock tossed Rosie’s phone over to John. They got her a cellphone because their lives were complicated and the schedule was constantly changing. The phone helped Rosie navigate all the changes in schedule and kept her up to date with her dads. “Look at her phone! The scratches!”
Mycroft nodded, his phone rings, he looked at it, "well duty calls." He left the flat with a flourish.
“Boy is my attention not enough for you?” Said John as he started to add more fingers alongside his tongue. He tugged and was pleased to see that his boy was able to open up his pretty rosebud just for Daddy.
John cleared his threat, "we aren't bumping anyone down a list by getting one of the available dogs?"
John took a deep breath and whispered back, "I wouldn't ever leave him. I won't he means to much to me, I would rather go without sex for the rest of my life than go on without him."
The tore through the streets of London the way only a man with access to the traffic lights can. It made him feel in control, today and tonight he felt that he lost a lot of control. His entire family wanted him out of their business and he was having a hard time sitting with that revelation. He hated that he lost a match which meant not only did he not get as much of a chance to gather as much info as he could but also meant that he had to remove the security devices from Sherlock's home. He didn’t want to do it, but he really thought he would win, he felt really stupid, and he didn’t like feeling stupid. His grip on the moving pieces in his life was falling apart and he hated himself for allowing that to happen. He couldn’t pin point precisely when he lost control so he couldn’t even figure out where he could’ve changed things. He hit a roundabout that was empty, he took some really tight turns, “FUCK! FUCK!FUCK! FUCK! FUCK THIS SHIT! FUCK! FUCK THIS! FUCK THAT! FUCK YOU!” He rarely cursed, but sometimes it was the best way for him to let off steam, since it couldn’t possibly start a war when done in the right place and it certainly replaced the urge to eat enough calories to fuck up his plans for a month. He may have lost control of a lot of interpersonal and familial relationships, but he still could control what went into his mouth, and at least he had that.
Mycroft was laughing, “so you really try timing yourself on your greetings for maximum effect, I mean I heard all those false starts.”
“It’s Captain,” Said John sitting on top of the rather plush over stuffed mattress, he noticed a mirror to the side and thought it rather convenient.
"No I'm a big scary leather man whose strength and accuracy rivals even the strongest of the masc4masc assholes out there," said Blaze as he cracked up laughing.
“Oh come on Mycroft, stop being a fucking drama queen and give us our scolding already,” yelled Sherlock.
John smiled at his pet who was being such a good Pup. He fed it a shortbread biscuit after it finished its meal. He attached a leash and guide his Pup to his room and motioned for the Pup to get on the foot of the bed. “Okay Pup, you did well, so rest up, we have a full day tomorrow. If you need to piddle, the puppy pad is on the floor. And one more thing.” He stepped up to the trunk with all the toys and pulled out a sheath. He lubed the inside of it before guiding his Pup’s cock into it. He figured if he was going to be sharing the bed with a mutt, the mutt should have a knot. He smiled before petting his pup on the head and kissing it on the snoot. “Sweet dreams pup.”
“Yes, William is old enough to understand and practice safety. So of course it is a great idea,” replied Sherlock, as he taught William how to clean the metal before starting a weld. Sherlock looked on with great affection as William managed to make a very clean close of the vehicle and prove that it was back in playable condition.
John pulled back his hips and thrusted back hard into Sherlock, “six.” He pulled back and adjusted his angle, and entered Sherlock again, this time Sherlock let out a loud yelp, “seven, I bet I found that sweet spot, didn’t I.” He placed a hand over Sherlock’s mouth, he started repeating the thrust that delivered full contact to Sherlock’s p-spot. He counted his thrusts, and occasionally tugged on Sherlock’s cock, each time continuing his count. Somewhere around 30; John could feel sherlock clenching around him. He delivered a hard thrust that drove Sherlock flat against the wall, and aggressively started to fuck him, knowing full well that Sherlock could easily acquire some road rash from the brick wall, and Sherlock would be feeling the burn for days afterwards. He felt Sherlock clench even harder and just as he was about to cum, John clamped his mouth firmly onto Sherlock’s shoulder delivering a rather painful bite.
Dad leaned into William’s personal space, “I bet a Dylan dollars, that you feel much better after that sandwich.” Dad laughed, “get it a Dylan dollars, like a million dollars!”
Blaze sighed, “looks like I am out of spoons, Aithne, can you lock up the place when  you all decide to leave.”
“Good Boy,” Said John as he stroked Sherlock’s inner thighs. John smiled as Sherlock bit back a moan. “I can’t take your beautiful cock out, because we are going to try to be decent people. And decent people don’t openly wank off in the middle of cafe, but I can certainly tease you.” John quickly pulled his hand away when someone passed by.
John knew he should feel bad, but he couldn’t stop laughing. He laid a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, “I think we should check out that apartment.”
Mycroft scoffed, "I think he is doing plenty of growing just fine, did you know him and John are together as a "couple", as of two weeks ago, and today they had a couple's therapy appointment mainly because Sherlock is afraid of chasing off John. Which is funny because when they were separated John had to be put on suicide watch and Sherlock kept relapsing every couple of days. Sherlock is just being over dramatic. And they are getting a service dog, I don't know what for but I am assuming it has to do with the nightmares because John does have quite the terrifying reaction to being woken up from his nightmares, it is enough to actually shake Sherlock. I don't know much about their sessions though because Dr. Thompson keeps things hand written and only gives the bare minimum to billing. Which I guess is fine given that most of her clientele are ex-armed forces and special-ops." Mycroft took a deep breath, also amused because his earlier comment about the billing codes was a lie there is a cluster of codes that basically mean the same thing, but he glared at his parents. "Is that why you are here? Is Sherlock putting you up to this, because last week he was also in here asking for a bit of space, something about boundaries being important for healthy relationships. As if Sherlock has boundaries there isn't hiding anything from that man."
John didn’t know what took over him in this moment but he was kissing Sherlock and it felt so right even though Sherlock was writhing against him like a teenager at a dance in a way that wasn’t in any way the usual grace of Sherlock. He looked at Sherlock who was looking at John as if he was staring into the sun. Well he might as well take this all the way he thought, John unzipped his trousers and tugged down his pants, exposing his cock to Sherlock, who was pretty much at perfect blow job level for John, and he looked down in awe as Sherlock, who just opened his mouth for John, and he guided his cock to Sherlock’s waiting mouth.
Violet’s smile went even wider, she was happy her son managed to find this despite every thing that he has gone through. “How has your visits to Eurus been going?”
Andrea giggled, "okay it's settled I'll just send him the address now, and  give details showing that you notes in the living room safe, and when he tries for it, you swoop in, and challenge him to the match." She sat back in her chair and smiled at her wife. "You know this is ridiculous."
“No, we are going to keep you nice and whole, and I am not trying to kink shame you, but that was worrisome,” Said John, he gripped Sherlock’s thigh rather harshly. “Maybe some day I can see how far I can stretch you, I am sure that will give you the sensation of being torn apart if you want that.”
Mycroft smiled, “thanks.” He watched as John dashed out of the bedsit with his backpack and luggage. He laughed as he saw John struggle to catch a cab, feeling a bit of pity he called one to stop and pick him up.
John placed down the box of Toby's stuff on the kitchen table. He placed the grabbed Toby's bed and brought it to their bedroom.
Sherlock relaxes slightly, "yes John I know you are sorry and that you are working on it. I forgive you because what you went through to hit those moments that is my fault I deserved it."
Sherlock grinded back onto John, Sherlock was mildly impressed with the maneuvering John was doing to get Sherlock out of his pants and trousers. Sherlock took a deep breath as he felt John’s cock graze against his well fucked hole. He arched his back getting ready for the intrusion.
Sherlock wasn’t sure where he wanted it, he liked the idea of John’s cum mixing with his against both of their bodies, but on the other hand letting John cum in him would let John reach into him in new and absolutely intimate ways. Oh... that sounded like a great idea,
John shrugged, "i guess one that can thrive with at least two walks a day and occasionally been out the whole day. Probably one that likes to play especially because we have Rosie."
“The cameras are facing away from their usual spot and are off, obviously not tampered outside, so one could deduce that government is involved,” said the first officer.
“William has wonderful supportive parents and family and a school that tries, not every trans kid has that, let him solve his own problems some time. I don’t know how to break it to you Sherlock, but other trans people aren’t exactly nice to other trans people who have had that support. I am not exactly fond of dealing with all the problems, a particular operative of mine faces just because he feels isolated from the larger trans community since he has been passing for so many years. So let him have a little bit of a struggle; it will do him good,” replied Uncle Mycroft as he snatched his laptop away from Sherlock. “Misery loves company, so think of it as guaranteeing some friends for when he is older. Your life certainly improved when you got friends and attachments, didn’t it.”
Sherlock grinned a rather stupid smile at John because he liked what he saw. He was struggling slightly to breath, because of the weight of John on his chest, but he would be more than glad to stop breathing if it meant he could get his mouth around that gorgeous cock. He felt around his belt for one particular keychain.
“Really pretty boy, i’ve lost track of the times I found you passed out from low blood sugar,” said Irene.
Sherlock laughed around John's cock and was amused at how John reacted to the vibrations. He started bobbing his head up and down john’s considerable length. “Sir, I want you fuck my throat till I pass out.” He grabbed John’s hands and placed them on his head.
Sherlock had downcast eyes and stayed as still as possible despite him having a whole butternut squash inside him rearranging his guts. He could see the outline of it in his stomach. He wondered what John had planned for him, he didn’t even allow his eyes to follow John as he exited.
The kiss wasn’t in anyway graceful, and John smiled because this reminded him of a kiss he shared with one of the girls from the field hockey team. He wasn’t expecting it, but she tackled him after his rugby practice, asked him to go with her to the spring dance, and she suddenly went shy for beat, but followed up with a sloppy kiss that took his breath away. All his rugby mates made fun of him for the rest of the season after that, but it was still a damn good kiss.
Solomon grabbed onto Golem's harness and pressed the clicker, "door."  Golem started pulling Solomon to the front entrance. They exited the kennel to a fairly busy street. "There is a park one block up the hill, otherwise there is a Tesco down the hill two blocks. Which one do you think is more indicative of your ADLs... wait activities of daily living?"
Sherlock nodded, "that's all fine." They walked the block to the closest Tesco. Toby kept a good pace along side Sherlock and she wasn't distracted by anyone or anything. When they got to the front of the shop, John and Rosie was there waiting for them. Sherlock waved at them.
"Okay Sherlock, let's start heading that way, but remember Toby is just simply supposed to walk with you, if you sense him pulling you when it isn't an emergency I am going to need you to press the buzzer," said Kayla, as she pulled out a notebook and a vest that said PAWS trainer and she put the vest on. "Just a heads up Sherlock, I am supposed to write down my observations for record keeping purposes."
He was no longer outside of his childhood home, he was on the floor on an exceedingly plush rug, he was getting licked by a dog, it took a few minutes for his brain to catch up, he was in his bed room, no wait. Their bedroom. No wait. Wait. Wait. Why is it a "their" who was the other part of that equation. SHERLOCK his brain screamed at him, he felt a wave of guilt because he knew what usually happened during his nightmares. He slowly got up and saw Sherlock sitting on top of their bed tensed up and curling into himself, he was taking deep breaths while closing his eyes. John stood quietly looking at Sherlock unsure of what to do.
Sherlock shook his head, "yes of course, I am fine."  He wasn't quite sure why he was being asked that question, he didn't like that people always asked that question out of the nowhere.
Solomon nodded, "okay what's you living situation? Also do you have a letter of approval, because as much as I am willing to just let you have one of ours, I do have to tell my boss who is getting a dog and why."
“Yeah I am on my way to a warehouse party, the DJ set has an interesting mix of post modern jazz and breakbeat DJs,” replied Wiggins with a slight shrug.
"Oh John, it is never a problem to have Rosie here, if I am here I can take her in any time, I mean only for emergencies, otherwise date nights you are going to have to pre schedule that with me," replied Mrs. Hudson, taking Rosie from John's arms.
“I take it, that you are bringing Crystal, since they are pretty much in every decision you make about the program. They are likable but again are you sure they are the best person for this job?” Said Athina.
Sherlock once again blocked John’s path and placed a hand on John’s shoulder only to see John twist away from the action. Sherlock sighed, “John, please stop.”
“Oh g-d I feel like such a teenager, I haven’t cum in my pants since I was 17. But how about you?”  John noted that Sherlock was still sporting a bit of boner himself, “I can help you with that if you want.”
Sherlock grinned and while keeping eye contact with John, he pressed his mouth against condom and in one smooth motion, Sherlock rolled the condom on to John’s dick, he enjoyed the light burn in his jaw because it was so fucking thick, his tongue lapped at the veins. Even with the condom he can tell that John had a cock that would hit all the good parts. It was a surprisingly long but not too long, he guessed about 8 inches, but wasn’t completely sure. He has a feeling that John would be rather amenable to the of Sherlock measuring him. He took a moment to let his throat relax around John’s length. John’s cock had a slight curb, Sherlock was willing to bet that john’s cock would his all the right spots if he was to bottom for him sometime. Sherlock thought that if he was had to make the ideal cock to have a good time with, this was the dick. And with that he pulled back keeping a intense suction, he used his tongue to adjust the pressure on John’s cock, he used John’s gasps and grunts as a way to gauge how well he was doing .
First he tried Dylan, because he liked going to the shore, so he thought a name that translated to “son of the sea” would be cool. He found it rather pleasant to use and it felt good to use in at least the cafe settings, but one day Dad and Papa had him tagging along on a case involving a carnival. He had fun, but eventually got hangry. So he ordered a sandwich at one of the stalls, and when they called out his name out, he had a warm feeling of joy to hear it. He sat next to his dad, and upon finishing it.
Sherlock shrugged, “I mean honestly, I probably wouldn’t have bothered with going to to grocery store, and even if I went with John to the store we rarely ever got things done because I would often notice something that easily turned into a case or got us kicked out. I think Toby was pretty good at making sure we got through the task."
Sherlock stood up and looked at his watch, “and you made it with two minutes to spare.” He looked at John who just broke out into a fit of giggling, and kissed him. First it was a tentative kiss, but when John returned the kiss, Sherlock deepened the kiss, providing all kinds of appealing sensations, he pulled away, and John leaned forward as if chasing after the kiss. An alarm went off, “sorry Captain looks like you’re out of time, catch you later. If I am on a case don’t wait up, if not we can get dinner and retrieve the rest of your belongings from the bedsit.” He finished that sentence off with a wink because from what he observed that was a pretty solid way of ensuring that the offer of dinner meant more.
“Fuck you,” yelled the leather daddy, and he swung a punch at Sherlock who ducked out of the way, the man threw another punch.
“There’s a good boy,” John pat Sherlock the head rather gently and swiped a stray droplet of cum with his thumb and smeared it across Sherlock’s lips. “Well you better stay a good boy, I’m going to make us some supper. Now you stay still and don’t you dare swallow  or else there will be a punishment.”
"Oh but he would, and you would be in a world of trouble that you wouldn't even know existed," said John, holding a bit of a laugh. "I mean I don't know what I can do to help with what set you off today."
"Mycroft, this isn't what most people have had to deal with, and I honestly think that we are going about this the wrong way and I think it is time we try to do better by all of you. And we do want to give you a choice in how we do this," said Siger as he uncrossed his legs, leaned back, letting go of the arm rests, he sat with his body open and palms up. "What can we do to make things easier on you?"
John laughed, “really Sherlock you’ve felt this way since we’ve met?” He stopped laughing when Sherlock did a slight pout at him, he ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
John sighed, “it’s a start.” He signed the paper, and Sherlock, promptly returned it to its spot in the desk. “oh and William dear, folding all the blankets and putting it on the foot of the bed doesn’t count.”
"It made things quiet and slowed the info coming in, but it just isn't practical for day to day life," said Sherlock, he finished writing his terms onto the small scraps of paper.
Sherlock nodded, he pulled out the keychain Solomon gave him. He started with Mrs. Hudson's door he clicked the the clicker, "Mrs. hudson's" he said.  He walked around the hallway and when they came across the basement he clicked the buzzer and said, "no" and as they rounded up to the stairs he started clicking the clicker until they got to the door. He said, "home," and opened the door. Toby came in and scanned the room around her. She stayed perfectly still. Sherlock started walking her around the living room and the kitchen. He clicked at the food fridge and buzzed at the experiment fridge.
The next time group met, Willow was over the moon, she had gotten to her appointment with the youth clinic, only to find out that her parents changed their mind with out telling her. The doctors administered the first dose of luprone immediately, since she was getting dangerously close to the cut off period. She said that she was glad, her parents changed her mind, and figured that if they didn’t tell her, then she won’t say anything about it, because she knew how her parents were. She was also glad that her parents never accompanied her to the clinic room and she could talk freely with the medical providers. William was rather pleased to hear the news.
Sherlock reveled in the sensation of John stroking his hair, and felt a slight bit of shame about the fact that this motion seemed to have a direct effect on his entire body, he was getting hard, and now was not the time for that. He struggled to get the words out, “I only want you to be happy, and this makes you happy, Mary makes you happy.” He was kneeling at John’s feet, the measuring tape fallen to the ground. He didn’t want to let John go, but he knew Mary made John happy, so he had to let him go. He didn’t know what was coming over him, but he was glad that John would forget about this shortly after removing the patch.
Mycroft sighed as the helicopter landed, there was better ways to spend a Sunday morning but this was a hell of a lot better than spending it at church, he was quite glad that his parents weren’t super religious. He walked through security and exchanged pleasantries with the regular staff. When he went down to the basement where Eurus was located, he received an update from her direct staff, he was surprised that BSL took him so long to learn, an entire month, it didn’t take him that long to acquire a language since he was a child. But it was definitely a lot faster than doing a back and forth of texting, plus there was some things that just aren’t properly conveyed with text. He walked down the hall to Eurus’ cell. He paused a moment to check that he didn’t receive any new urgent messages. He heard Eurus... wait was she trying to time her greeting for a dramatic entrance, oh she keeps misfiring. Oh this is funny, nice to know she can make mistakes. He was tempted to just leave, just to mess with her.
John rolled over into a sitting position, he looked at Sherlock, “Sherock, I take it rimming is not a thing you like to do.”
Sherlock looked at John, he had to admit he found the man attractive and interesting, and would be an interesting person to spend more time with if only for just the deductions he could make about the man. It also didn’t hurt that he found himself completely dickmatized by the man. He wasn’t even sure if this good idea. “I have my eye on a nice little place in central London, together we can afford it.”
“It took me a while but come to think of it, but wasn’t that the man who was always picking up Clara’s on-again-off-again,” Said Jeanine. “So I think all initial assumptions that our boy could end up dead in the Thames this morning is incorrect.”
Sherlock laughed, "no don't bother he owes me a favor, I can contact him on my own. I solved a murder at their location once, basically one of their therapist was getting charged with manslaughter, but ultimately it wasn't the therapist, it was victim's ex who got it in his head that if he couldn't have the victim no one could.  And slipped some peanut oil into the leather conditioner, so when the bullwhip was used on the victim they got exposed to the peanuts the moment the whip cracked into their skin."
“Thank you,” said John, running a hand through Sherlock’s hair. He got up and quickly put his trousers and pants on. He picked up Sherlock’s clothing and slowly started putting them back on to him, he cleaned them up the best he could, he was doing all of this with a surprising amount of care for someone who just roughly fucked a man he just met on top of warehouse rave.
Sherlock whined, at the loss of contact, but let out a gasp as he was yanked up by his hair. He winced as Sherlock shook him by his locks. He stayed obediently on his knees, as John delivered a few more slaps.
John does the daddy thing and cleans up Sherlock post play session but Sherlock is feeling a little bit bratty.
Scott huffed out a big sigh, “excuse me.” He got up from the table, and exited, he was heard talking in one of those “I want to yell at you, but I won’t and I am incredibly disappointed in all of you,” tones.
"Ooh I was, you know this is the fastest security ever approved me for anything. I take it being part of human rights groups and family reunification projects isn't a bad thing in the U.K." Replied Aithne, "also was my program director approved, because they are invaluable to me making this decision. Also a heads up, my brother is planning to accompany me to this trip across the pond, not to sherringford, but he just needs to check out the new production labs up North. You might want to keep an extra eye on Sherlock's flat because I think he is looking to punch him, but not a bad beating in anyway, but you know just one sucker punch and leaving."  She laughed, "honestly I am just kidding, I think he is saving that for a very special occasion, the punch is for the whole fucking over his computer and back up drives incident, not some weird grudge over cluedo. Plus my brother has an agreement with the rest of us that he'll get in no more brawls."
So William tried another name, he always liked it when he heard Papa say things like “John, my conductor of light!” to his dad. So he thought it fun to have a play on that, so he tried Samson, because it meant “Sun Child”. A few days later his computer caused him a bit of trouble, that no one in the house could figure out, so they went to the Apple Store to get it checked out at the genius bar. The Apple Genius called out “Samson” and once again William felt good about the name. The genius struggled to solve the problem, and ultimately it was an issue that they couldn’t solve in one day so they sent it out for repair.
“Yes captain,” gasped Sherlock. He was intrigued as John wrapped a neoprene strap around the base of his cock. John started stroking him to fullness. Sherlock gasped even more as John stroked him to full hardness. He was positively leaking long strings of pre-cum, he whimpered when John suddenly let go.
“John we live together, one could assume seeing each other later is an inevitability, the length of time between seeing each other is the only varying factor,” said Sherlock with a rather flat affect, but he did have a hint of a smile. “You better get going, can’t keep the huddled masses in search of PEP or Plan B waiting too long.”
Ella raised her eyebrows, "John out of curiosity i'd like to explore that remark a little bit, I mean not to put words in your mouth but the way you listed off a dog, Rosie, and Sherlock, it almost sounds like a list of things you are going to have to take care of."
John on the other hand was delighted at the turn of events. He wasn’t exactly sure what to make of the fact that Sherlock was willing to try all the kinks under the sun as long as John was interested in trying, but some of them did make him feel a little weird. While he had no problem with Sherlock probing his ass with his fingers and cock, Sherlock’s tongue and mouth was a whole other issue, and at this very moment he was moaning into the pillow as Sherlock was delivering gentle kisses all along his spine, John was anticipating what was going to happen next, but was surprised at the rather sharp bite he received. He let out a small gasp and found himself rutting on to the bed spread. He felt Sherlock grab his asscheeks and spread them. He bucked when Sherlock’s tongue breached his hole. He could feel Sherlock practically smiling against him.
Aithne held her hand up, "that isn't the start of it. Do you think if we can pick the three new folks I can take the time for a sabbatical?"
Sherlock continued to writhe at John’s efforts but he wanted more, he tried to reach back to John’s cock in hope of getting him to give him what he wanted.
Mike smirked, “okay, so case WIHO010982 hooked up with the Captain, so none of you have to wonder who jumped the grenade last night and honestly shame on all of you, I know how you all talk about him, the man’s brother is a huge advocate for our program. Also he is actually not that bad if you get to know him. If anything it is all on you for being uncomfortable with him reading you to filth. Sure he has no perception of social mores, personal space, and seems to be stuck in a constant tug of war between overstimulation and mind killing boredness, but he is really caring underneath it all, I don’t think he can help it. I am pretty sure they will be very happy I mean Val seconds my decision of making them meet, but I do wish I made him change shirts before dismissing him for the day. But again try not to talk ill of WIHO010982 or his brother because since the brother got involved we have just been having a lot more easier of a time making progress in getting PrEP covered.”
Billy glared at Mycroft, “You know Mikey, you can just stop and ask me without all of this. I think it would make your car so much cleaner.”
John smiled, "thanks for being considerate." Sherlock smiled and offered his hand to John, and with that John and Sherlock walked away holding hands.
“Good boy,” John’s hand in Sherlock hair suddenly went from the gentle carding to the twisting tug. John shoved a knee between Sherlock’s legs to knock him off balance slightly. “On your knees with your hands behind your head, dropping your hands is the same as a red. Do you hear me?”
John was amused at the hitched breath Sherlock took, he was so flustered, and quite frankly John found it adorable. “After we are done eating, we are going to find a nice dark little corner and each bite is going to equal a stroke. It is up to you what the definition of stroke means.”
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, he delivered a light kiss to John’s cheek, which left John smiling.
John looked at Sherlock, "Sherlock, Kayla is here to train us on using Toby. We should probably go to the shops to get used to taking Toby in public. Also it is way to late to order anything to come in on time."
John rolled in a big closer to Sherlock because he knew that was usually Sherlock’s signal for cuddle me. He settled in as Sherlock wrapped his arms around John. “What does that have to do with anything?”
“Are you saying we are going to have to stop two parents at this wedding?” Said Francis, with a heavy sigh.
John laughed, “oh really you sure it wasn’t because you were wondering if you absorbs bit of me through your rectal lining because you said some really weird things post orgasm.” He kissed Sherlock before rolling on to his side.
John looked at Sherlock when his breathing changed, he loosened his grasp on Sherlock's cock and ran his fingers through Sherlock’s cum and shoved his fingers into Sherlock’s mouth. John smiled as Sherlock moaned around his fingers sucking his own cum off of John’s fingers.  “I think this would be a good time to get out of this alley and check out this apartment you keep talking about.” He removed his fingers from Sherlock’s mouth with an amusing pop and grabbed Sherlock’s clothes and handed them to him.
"Well just remember he is actually good at fighting, and you fight like the femme sissy you are," joked Aithne.
“Oh no one, i hear and see things and I make deductions, I pick what ever I think would create the most amusing result,” said Josephine. “But feel free to elaborate in how that came into the story.”
One of the formulas for deciding to cease the use of condoms is AATM (do they hold your attention, do you find them attractive, how long have you been together, would you trust them with your money enough for you to give them you ATM pin.)
Yeah this stuff falls firmly in the world of Risk Aware Consensual Kink, but let’s pretend they had a consent conversation that went beyond “yes until it’s a no.”
Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson where frantically trying to clean up. Mrs. Hudson was very surprised to see him help.
"Maybe you shouldn't sit in such a precarious spot," snapped back Mycroft. "Also nice words back there, they sounded exactly like one would say after finishing a program and now uses the program as a script when trying to construct acceptable answers for awkward situations in life. I don't know if you are being sincere with those words or are just parroting stuff so as to cover up what you have done to my brother, but know this. If you hurt my brother ever again, I will make you disappear so thoroughly that no one will ever find you. But don't worry Rosie will be fine, I'll stonewall whoever other than Sherlock tries for custody so hard they would need to have an entire team of lawyers on retainer every hour of every day to even dream of getting Rosie before she becomes of age, because while I am sure Sherlock can eventually learn live without you, I think loosing Rosie would kill him. But don't worry, I'll steer him in the right way to ensure she gets the best of care, you already know what our parents offered, so it isn't an empty promise, it's a guarantee. Rosie will want for nothing and have the best provided for her.”
Irene let out a laugh, “looks like I know who you are going to be sharing that popper with.” She touched his shoulder as she walked away, “I am going to miss you, but do visit me in San Francisco.”
Sherlock was rather pleased with how fast William figured that out. He left a set of lock picks in the living room and locked all the doors before heading off to the lab with all the house keys in hand. He was impressed that when he came back that evening, all the doors were opened, and John made no mention of coming home to a flat full of locked doors. William was sitting at kitchen table with a small smile.
"I haven't thought that far, yeah I probably can't fly by wire this," said Aithne leaning on the table.
John smirked, “well this is going to be really, really good.” He slapped Sherlock’s ass. “A posh boy like you even has the good stuff, we’re not going to be having a nasty headache with this one are we?”
Mycroft sighed, "okay I'll look more into Dr. Hunter and I'll give you call. Also i'll talk with Sherlock, otherwise, I don't know if you want to do this experiment so badly why not have him try to go take a vacation in some country where I cannot access their security." Mycroft laughed, "good luck finding a country that does that as well."
Kate smirked, “let’s be real he only does it because he is bored we’re just lucky he is solving crimes and not out there committing them.”
“I just remembered something Ro did that should’ve tipped us off on the whole trans thing, you know I hate repeating myself,” replied Sherlock as he looked at John.
"Mycroft, it may be easiest for you but does it work for everyone? Also has the constant observance prevented the things you feared most." Said Violet.
She met Andrea when they were in school on the base, they rarely ever shared classes but given that both of their parents seemed to be on similar deployment routes, they always were in the same base. They finally met at her father's retirement party and they really hit it off and became a pair, it wasn't like anything spectacular happened they just happened to come along together quite well. Plus they both worked jobs that required privacy and confidentiality, which made it quite easy to keep the separation between home and work life. Of course the current Boss problem would violate their separation of home and work rule, but ultimately Mycroft fucking Holmes has proved himself a nuissance long enough, not so much a nuissance more of a concern.
Mike rolled his eyes but still looked a bit amused at the situation as a whole, “sorry Sherlock you aren't immune to the rule, for some odd reason this floor is popular for cottaging and we had to put a stop to it. And rather than sending in cops, we figure embarrassing the last one to exit would do the trick. Not trying to be sex shaming, but the last thing this program needs is men cottaging in the building this program runs in. I mean that would be a funny way to recruit participants for the study, but we really can’t have that stuff going on here. I mean can you imagine how the folks who want this program shut down would react.”
"Well I am not exactly sure how much further I should be pushing this whole new experiences thing for today, but would you like to join me in the bath?" Said Sherlock, giving John a hopeful look.
John and Sherlock just found out their kid is trans, he still doesn’t have a name yet, but they call him Ro. They feel a terrible about not seeing Ro’s outbursts as a sign, but some things are starting to make sense. And some of those things include biting an obnoxious woman at the supermarket while trying to prepare for a shelter in place order.
John smiled at the fact that Sherlock lit up at the idea. Okay I am counting about 10 little messes so your count is already at 10 and it is only going to get higher from there.”
Harry nervously laughed as they returned their hot chocolate and made an attempt to ask Kate and Irene how they know John and Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled at John and stood up in front of him, “Thank you John, and I really do want to try getting to some level of physical intimacy with you. Uh… Can I try something?”
“To be honest I don’t know you seem to have been a priority to me since we met, I don’t know when the feelings turned this way, part of me started to identify those feelings around the whole Irene incident... unfortunately I didn’t know exactly what I wanted until you were gone, and by the time you came back I was so set on moving on, I didn’t think about what I actually wanted.” John smiled and gently touched Sherlock’s face, “but you are it for me, we been through so much and you are still here. And you just take everything that comes our way, and you have been absolutely wonderful with Rosie, I don’t think I would be able to do this without you.” He pulled Sherlock down for a kiss.
"You are enough, and despite all we have gone through together, we are still here and doing our best," Sherlock pulled John back to the bed and curled up around him. "And hey if you are really so worried about messing up Rosie we can do our very best to make sure she is a socially competent child by 8 years old and put her in a boarding school, I mean I can really hype her up with some selective use of reading materials so that she romances the idea of going away, therefore cutting down on any possible chances of homesickness or feeling abandoned. That way we can be really fantastic parents on the weekends and holidays because she can't possible be around us long enough for us to mess her up that way." He was cracking up by the time he finished that sentence.
Sherlock looked at her, "I'd like that." He dropped the jar of pasteurized honey into the cart and grabbed more sugar and baking soda than one should use, hinting that him and Rosie might make more experiments.
Aithne scowled at her little sister, “i’m not stupid, I am bringing a coworker, they're really good at talking sense into me before I do something stupid.”
"Well that just means we need some baking soda too. And can we get more honey, but not the fake stuff real hone," asked Sherlock.
“Oh you think you’re so fucking great with all your fucking war hero shit and you being a fucking doctor, but guess what you are nothing you ain’t got either of that shit anymore,” yelled Harry.
Mrs.Hudson smiled to herself, they may not be married ones but Mrs. turners' couple doesn't have a child or a dog, so really her John and Sherlock really have them beat. She joined them at the door.
"Ooh Sherlock, doesn't that sound nice, we still have a couple bolts of that fabric your favorite scarf is made from, maybe we can use one of the bolts for that blanket," said Violet as she also wrote her terms onto her scraps of paper.
Ella took a step forward and lunged at Mycroft, who parried against Ella's foil. Who in turn did a quick upward movement that caused Mycroft to quickly stumble forward that ended with Ella tapping Mycroft in the chest. A red light flashed, Ella smiled behind her mask.
Aithne read his expression as concern, and that didn't bother her, "I mean you can tag along, we got a private jet."
Sherlock went to grab the groceries, and noticed that Toby was already holding a bag, Sherlock smiled and went up with Toby at his side.
John pulled out the shower shot. “Okay be a really good boy for your daddy, and I want you to hold it for as long as you can.” He rubbed Sherlock’s bulging stomach before moving downward to his cock. He stroked Sherlock’s cock slowly which caused Sherlock to loose a little bit of control meaning that water started to spray out of him. John noted that Sherlock was in need of another round of water and admired the small gape that Sherlock was still sporting. He then got an idea, he pressed the tip of his still hardening cock against Sherlock’s hole and started to take a piss.
Joey pulled out his phone and started going through the calendar apps, “I mean it is starting to look like we might need to shift around the July Date to before Up Your Alley because I mean let’s be real there is a good chunk of our friends would be in for Up Your Alley, so if they can attend the wedding before the events happen we will be good. Also I am sure some of the folks would appreciate the free ride into San Francisco. It would be nice to see Johnny and Jamie again. Remember Private Carlos, he was definitely the baby of the bunch, but I bet you he’d try to pounce on Jamie if given a chance.”
Andrea smirked, "oh Ella, it is going to take so much work to get anything out of him, but I will absolutely enjoy watching unleash your mental tool box on him."
Aithne looked at her brother slightly mortified, "I am so glad I am not an MSM, because all of that just sounds terrible awkwardness."
“Sir, yes, sir on both counts,” said Sherlock, absolutely giddy with how thiings were going, he initially thought he fucked up when he first laid hands on John and ended up on the ground. He realized in that moment if he was going to be having a veteran for a roommate, one probably should’ve considered the possibility that said veteran might have PTSD.
John looked off in the distance, realizing what he had just done. He knew he would have to be careful, because this was the year William decided to really up the ante with the contract. It wasn’t something spectacularly terrible, it would just be inconvenient. William wanted a dog, and not just any dog, no he had to want a corgi basset, and he wanted it to be a puppy, because apparently he had plans. Plans that he would not share with his parents. John and Sherlock also agreed that William was little too young for a dog especially one that was known to be stubborn and incredibly intelligent. Also John wasn’t quite sure just how much of the combo of stubborn and intelligent can be added to their household.
The third teen, “Come on Doc, Andrea, just finish it, the software don’t lie and that man just looks sad, and when you fight a sad guy no one wins. So take Mr. Sadsacks off the roof and him process his shit and you use some kind of motivational interviewing to get his ass to realize whatever it is you need Mr. Sadsacks to realize.”
Sherlock perfectly held the condom in his mouth until it was completely rolled onto John’s cock. He moaned as John kept fucking his mouth, he tried to stay as quiet as he could but with every thrust he couldn’t stop a little sound escaping from him. Sherlock raised a hand to the side of his throat and held down, he felt instantly lightheaded as he pressed down on the carotid vein, which temporarily shut off oxygen to his brain, but as soon as he released the vein he would quickly recover. He figured he couldn’t be making sounds if he was to pass out.
Papa was look in at William with a small bit of frustration, but also understanding since Sherlock had done the exact same thing multiple times. “William, you need to remember to turn off the stove, every time you use it. Also what are you doing? Judging by the colors I am assuming these are all for Valentines Day. Which I still think is a little odd for 9 years olds to be celebrating in school. Also we already made those star shaped crayons for everyone in your class. I know you like school, but surely you don’t need to do more?”
But one year, Harry deviated from the usual and went with an raspberry pi computer for William, but continued with the pajamas for John and Sherlock. They knew that despite the fact that John and Sherlock were in a queer relationship that the pair did skip over cruising culture. Harry knew that lack of knowledge would make for a hilarious moment. They took a stab at it and assumed that Sherlock had bottom tendencies while John had some Top energy, they were cackling when they found the pajamas a few years back at a boutique owned by their friend Kate, back in San Francisco, so they decided to start playing the long game of getting them used to receiving pajama for Christmas and Harry insisting in taking a photo of them in the pajamas. So they finally had John and Sherlock, right how they want them.They giggled as they took the photo, they sent it to a group chat of theirs which had all of their queer friends who loved talking about the wild shit their siblings got into. Shortly after Harry was confused to hear a moaning sound.
John grabs the ruined cake and puts in the cart while grabbing another cake so that they could at least have a good cake.
“Hey now, we moved in together with in a week of dating,” Said Kate laughing while playfully shoving at Irene. “So you can’t be one to talk shit to Sherlock.”
he wants that he wants John to reach him that way. He moaned loudly as John continued to fuck him enthusiastically. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder and John paused and their eyes met. “I want you in me John,” Said Sherlock as he wrapped his legs around John’s waist and he pulled John in for a kiss.
"Say that now but you watch we're going to get a phone call someday saying she is violating school dress code and we are going to be stuck with an emergency color removal just to keep her on track for school. Of course kids think what I do is cool, they are kids, and as far as it goes I think most adults think I am just being annoying.” replied Sherlock, he said with a slight smile.
Sherlock swallowed and awkwardly got out of his underwear, it was almost like he forgot how to move gracefully and now he remembered the issue with leather underwear, like sure the fact that it was a jockstrap meant that things had a chance to air out but it was always a bit of a shock of cold hitting the gathered sweat when it was finally removed. He took a deep breath and crawled over to John stopping just a few inches away.
William nuzzled the part of his Papa’s shirt he found softest, he wasn’t going to lie he liked the feel of Papa’s shirts a whole lot more than dad’s jumpers. “So what are you getting Dad for valentines?”
Sherlock filled each container with the slime and the dough, he thought it a good idea to get containers that could easily fit in pockets. He slipped the rubber bands in place so that it would snap back shut when it wasn’t actively being opened.
Sherlock looked slightly flustered, “because it is considered stealing when you spend other people’s money with out their permission but sometimes it’s okay for the greater good?"
John nodded, and pushed Rosie's stroller into the stroller parking and grabbed a cart to putting her into it. He wore Rosie's baby bag, one of those weird ones that looked like an engineer corps bag, it was a gag gift from one of the guys in his Veteran PTSD group. After one of the group members saw him running around with a floral bag petunia pickle bottom that Mary got. It was an impractical thing that while everything had it's place there is such thing as too many things to fit in such a large bag. It was at one point bigger than Rosie. He really didn't like the thing, but he wasn't about to let toxic masculinity stop him from using a £200 bag. Rosie laughed as she was put in the shopping cart.
Sherlock let out a hoarse scream, the sudden intrusion was welcomed but at the same time a bit too much, too fast but he was glad that John was willing to give it to him like that. He moaned as he lightly thrusted against the bed, relishing the feel of john’s thick cock weighing heavily inside of him. John’s cock had some rather pronounced veins that made for some delightful friction with his prostate. He found the fact that John was still clothed to he rather hot, especially because it was his fatigues, and as much as Sherlock didn’t like to think of it, he was a huge sucker for military men, he assumed it had something to do with the shoulders. His moans turned into awkward grunts as John started to plow into him with long thrusts where with each movement John almost withdrew his entire length only for him to slam right back in again. John was grasping onto his hips with enough pressure that he felt he might wake up bruised later. Sherlock tried his best to stay on all fours but struggled and was rocked forward roughly with every thrust. He felt his arms weakening with every movement but tried to hold himself up in hopes of keeping John happy.
Violet added "of course we'll take her after to the program. Where else do you think she is going to go?"
John watched him walk away with a bit of affection, “oh he is going to ruin me, and I am going to love ever moment of it. Hey, what the fuck!” John turned around to look at what hit him. It was a hose.
vigorously but the movement was impeded by the tight grip. John smiled and pulled out of Sherlock, who let out a rather pathetic whimper at the sudden emptiness. John lead Sherlock around by his hair, until he was on his knees in the middle of the alley.
Sherlock panicked for a hot second because he wasn’t in anyway close to being able to take a cock up his ass, at the moment, especially one the size of John’s. Sherlock let out a loud gasp as he felt John’s rough hands take a firm grip of his ass cheeks and started spreading them. He did a slight jump when he suddenly found a tongue gently probing his asshole.
"Well I mean I shouldn't have panicked in the bath tub, I mean I thought I was going to be okay with it but suddenly I wasn't when I realized you had full view of my scars. And now you got a weird bruise on your nose," said Sherlock shifting uncomfortably.
Sherlock quickly scrambled to get on all fours, his legs spread wide and he rested on his elbows, he wanted to give John all the space needed to check him for readiness because while John cared about keeping Sherlock’s hole in good condition, Sherlock really didn’t care. He almost desired that his hole was constantly used and abused. He moaned as John pried apart his ass cheeks to get a good look at his hole. He only got louder as John traced a finger along the sensitive tissue, he pushed back in hopes of John probing his hole. He let out a yelp when John slapped his ass over his impatience. Please Daddy, I’ll be extra good just fill me up.”
“Yes, I did, I am coming over, I currently don’t have set travel time, but I can make the time to do it, if you give me coordinates to know where to come. I’ll tell you when things are set up,” replied Aithne.
bobbed up and down John’s cock, he started to stroke John’s balls. He would sometimes pull off completely with a wet pop and suck John’s balls. He grinned whenever John would thrust up into his mouth, he noticed that John had his head thrown back and eyes closed, savoring Sherlock’s efforts. Sherlock reached for the lube and drizzled some over his fingers, never once letting John’s cock leave his mouth. He pulled back almost letting John out of his mouth completely and with one fluid motion he took John’s length completely while probing one of his fingers into John’s hole, with enough accuracy to poke right at that specific spot. He felt John thrust up rather roughly, but he still kept bobbing up and down John’s length occasionally stroking the underside with his tongue. He added another finger and continued to press at that spot, milking John’s prostate with rather intense precision. He always sucked in a slight breath on every back pull, sure he liked the feeling of being on the edge of passing out but felt that John probably didn’t need that at the moment. He moaned the best he could given the obstruction down his throat, as John gripped firmly onto Sherock’s head and forced him down.
John and Sherlock have now moved on to an established relationship. Sherlock now has a sex drive and he wants to try everything.
Mike sighed, “you are all terrible, but also good for those of you who acknowledge that neurodivergent folks are perfectly capable of having sexual identities and deserve to be treated in prevention programs just as much as anyone else.” The words didn't carry much impact because he broke out into laughter soon after shooting his staff a disapproving look.
Sherlock nodded as the cum in his mouth mixed with his saliva and every time he took a breath through his mouth it made an amusing amount of bubbles. He hated it, and he knew John knew he hated it. Because as much as he loved being covered and marked by John Watson, he very much preferred to swallow right away instead of just letting it linger on his tongue. Still he knelt obediently as John went on with making supper.
“Boy, I know what you’re doing,” Said John, as he grabbed Sherlock’s waist and forced him to be fully seated on his cock, he managed to maneuver himself into a seated position as well and grabbed Sherlock’s cock and started to pull him off roughly while he shallowly thrusted into Sherlock. He bit into Sherlock’s shoulder and with that Sherlock started to cum with a loud shout and quite a bit of explosive force and he made a bit of a mess of John’s pants and boots.
Mike sighed, “John you have volunteered enough for the weekend you did Friday night, last night, and almost all of today. I think you need to enjoy a bit of Pride for yourself. Given that you haven’t taken your breaks and we have enough coverage, I think you should just go for the day. You can wait for Sherlock if you want, just don’t touch the filing boxes because we don’t want to accidentally cause a you to get in trouble over privacy rights.”
“Nah, there is definitely someone else in here, don’t think me stupid,” Sebastian turned to the curtain with a raised eyebrow. “You know I bet you don’t even have a girl hiding because you are obviously trying to hide something, who knew you were a fucking faggot.” He suddenly threw a punch at the curtain at right about the head level of Sherlock’s head. He was met with the rather solid weight of John as he tackled Sebastian and started raining down on him with a multitude of intense punches.
It was Christopher Street Day and London Pride was in full swing. He was sure there was more local queer uprisings that London could use, but he wasn’t going to think about too much. It was their busiest day for testing, they had the whole team on deck. John just finishing up  yet another HIV and STI test, “everything came up negative, but given your risk profile, I would suggest that you talk with us further about PrEP, Pre-Exposure Prophalaxsys, which is a daily pill you can take to reduce your chances of acquiring HIV by 99% if you take it every day, drop down to 4 day a week and you are only covered 92%, you should still use a condom, because it is only good for HIV, and treatment resistant gonarhea has been going around. If you are interested we can link you up with a PrEP navigator so that they can help link you up. Another option is PEP or Post Exposure Prophalaxysis, just come into any A&E and they’ll be able to get you started on a round, but just so you know you only have up to 72 hours after an exposure to get that started.  But either way here is your £20 and enjoy the rest of your Pride.” Mike stuck his head inside of the testing RV and motioned for him to come out  of the RV. “Do we have another preliminary positive you want me to counsel?”
Her brother Francis, was in the Army and for some odd reason she really couldn’t remember much of his service history. He didn’t really talk much about it other than the fact that he was sent home after his unit got ambushed, then again talking was just difficult for him them these days. Francis currently worked as a security guard and did some odd jobs for Geneticorp Science and Labs, which was the company ran by his twin Scott and her twin Blaze. It wasn’t exactly fulfilling work in his opinion, but at least this way he was able to be around people he actually liked and be with his boyfriend, the idea of staying in England using his pension and inheritance did not seem appealing especially given the chance that he most likely would be the new focus of their mother’s intense hovering. He was tall, fair skinned, freckled with light brown hair and emerald eyes. His hair was cut into a crew cut and his posture was bolt straight, much like one would expect from the army, but it had a certain unevenness, that unevenness popped up in all sorts of places on him, ranging from his lopsided smile to the shaky grip in his right hand.
Aithne rolled her eyes, “okay well my brothers were all not having a good time, but I met Eurus and we got along right away because it just worked, nothing had to be explained to her, it was as if she could just read everything about me in a glance and she understood. It was nice to be understood without explanation, especially the whole thing about pain.. I mean I don’t think she has CIPA but I think she really couldn’t identify pain because it was so below and beyond her ability to figure it out. But like we understood each other in a way I never felt in my life. A lot of our ideas about navigating the world overlapped and it was nice to see someone else like me.” Aithne shrugged her shoulders. “Well yeah that's why I am interested in seeing her again.” She nodded and stayed quiet, pouring herself another glass of wine.
Sherlock laughed, “okay, you haves point there, but I am sure Untie Harry would listen to what you want before making any major decision like that’s”
“Sherlock, darling, I really can’t with open mouths while eating. So let’s call it 40 bites and get moving. Unless you want to do something that would make Molly hate you,” said John.
He got a nice striped pattern with the tape and the rubber band was securely in place. William placed the play dough, slime, and custom spinner into a red paper bag, and tied some ribbon around it.
Mycroft stood back with his foil slightly raised, obviously waiting for Ella to make the first move.she stayed back not even looking to make and effort to approach she eventually even lowered her weapon.
"Yeah and dad asked her permission and she let him, so I don't know if really isn't as big of a deal as she thinks it is" said Aithne, "I mean if anything the whole 'all her kids are either gay, bi, or trans, is something she could use as a driving force of suffering."
"You know I don't need this," snapped Mycroft, he really hated loosing control. He stood up and started going towards the door, "also just so you know I did call Dr. Hunter, she'll be available to come in for a consultation but she won't guarantee that Eurus will be entered into the program. And I checked the programs closer to here, but none of them seem to be prepared for a case such as Eurus, I doubt Dr. Hunter is prepared either, but given the history they share and the unique history and tactics of her staff, I think I am reluctantly willing to give the doctor a chance but that is if and only if she is able to prove that Eurus is a candidate for the program. But I emphasize that one of the three of you must be willing to take her in after her stint in the program, but if you cannot she goes back to Sherringford because I don't know anywhere else to place her."
"You got that right, and mother is trying to make up for that with her level of disapproval in all of our life decisions," said Aithne, she laughed a bit.
Solomon smiled, "well I can assure you that you are going to be helping a lot of folks with this donation."
Mycroft snorted into his tea, of course he read all the academia on the subject and he had to because he had to justify the increase of CCTV cameras, but this like of questioning was getting boring real fast. "Of course I do, it is my job to know."
“Oh shit,” snapped John, and he quickly pulled away as he realized his dick slipped and accidentally breached Sherlock’s hole, but Sherlock held on. “I’m sorry.” He stopped pulling away from Sherlock.
John stroked his cock to full hardness again, and started slapping it against Sherlock’s face as he continued to jack off. He rather enjoyed the look of adoration tinged with a bit of petulance Sherlock was giving him, but Sherlock shouldn’t fret, he was going to be filled with something soon enough. John felt his orgasm about to hit, “okay be my good boy and hold this in your mouth until I say so.”
John stood still clenching his fists, he wanted to say something but he knew Harry was not in a state to be talked to at this moment. But deep down he knew she was right, he didn’t have the army, he couldn’t even perform what he was trained to do because of the damn hand tremor. He couldn’t find a fucking job to stay in fucking London, he knew that moving back to the village with his aunt would mean he would save money, but he would be bored to death. He would be better off dead and given that spectacularly great fuck he just had, it might just be better on a high note, he didn’t need to infect Sherlock with all the misery that seems to follow him. Sherlock was an attractive man, he wouldn’t have any trouble finding a new person. He decided that he was just going to to go back to his bedsit and use the pistol, he had been thinking about perpetually ever since he came back and now was a good as ever a time to do it. He sighed and walked away with resignation his shoulder dropped and looking downward, he headed towards the exit.
Molly had a slight look of disappointment as she accepted him into her testing RV. she sighed as closed the door behind Sherlock.
Dr. Aithne Hunter stared at her brother Blaze, as he sat across the table pouring over lab reports. "So what do you think?"
They all proceeded back to the cart coral and unlocked Rosie’s stroller from the stroller parking. John and Sherlock placed all the groceries  and Rosie in the stroller and made their way back to 221 B Baker Street.
Andrea pondered for a minute, and smiled, "you remove all the in-house surveillance from Sherlock and John's apartment, you can still observe from outside. Maybe offer them some cameras they are in control of, but you'll have to ask permission to do so. I still want to get a guaranteed vacation," said andrea.
Sherlock knelt before John, willing to take whatever John was willing to give him, he never found himself so open to anyone before in his life and they had only known each other a few hours. He felt that keeping John in his life was going to be a step in the right direction. He found John so exciting, so interesting that he felt that the urge to use was just completely dampened. The gnawing boredom that usually plagued him every moment of his life was gone. He knew it stupid to say a person was the catalyst for his change this big, because he couldn’t possibly control how John would react ever, but he just knew John was going to be important to him. So he knelt on the ground absolutely adoring John. He knelt naked in the alley, in a proper kneel with his
John and Sherlock let out a breath of relief and also took their seats. Rosie squirmed uncomfortable, Sherlock pat the bottom of Rosie’s diaper, “looks like it is time for a change, bye.”
“Well the posh mum decided to talk about how I was lucky to have a girl because a girl doesn’t go around touching everything and how she had a hard time managing her boys,” said Sherlock as he pulled John in closer. “Well I wasn’t paying attention to the mum, but I guess Ro did. So he snuck up to mum and when she tried to tell Ro that he was pretty and had lovely hair, she tried to touch Ro. And Ro jumped up and bit the woman’s hand so hard that she got a bruise. The woman yelled loudly, and I kept trying to tell the employees that she tried to touch my kid, but to them it didn’t matter, so they banned us.” He sighed, “that really should’ve stuck out to me before all of this.”
Sherlock sat up and smiled, "your letter writing exercise it kinda spilled over into other emotions."
Rudy nodded, “and Sherlock will never know what I do, that’s his brother’s burden. But yes I posted bail for the two of you. I mean surely you could’ve waited just a bit more to go back to your flat rather than fucking in the clinic’s fire escape. This is your only time, I’m not going to tell your brother or your parents but next time you decide to pull such a stunt I am letting Mycroft handle that mess, and you know he is going to lord over you with that for ages to come.
"What Sherlock are you at a loss for words? That rarely happens, oh I am just going to have to cherish this moment,” said Mycroft with a slight smile. Mycroft noticed his eyes and they were flickering, he didn’t pay much mind to it. Sherlock looked like he was chewing on something, but him eating was too damn rare. "Chewing on your words aren't you, don't worry they'll come eventually. Can you shut that hound up?"
John squeezed Sherlock, “okay I trust you, let’s get tested.” He cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “I mean if you’ll have me,” said John, as he started to unbutton his shirt.
"Well William now goes by Sherlock, and is sharing a flat with another man and his daughter and Mycroft is still being a mysterious asshole, but now Wil-Sherlock's mom seems to talk about him with a bit of an edge. So I can only imagine the kind of drama going on there," said Blaze, his voice filled with excitement and a slight lisp. "But they didn't mention Eurus, but Sherlock's mom, did light up when she heard about your work."
He cautiously pushed open his door only to see a man in a pressed suit and an umbrella sitting by his desk. “Can I help you?” Asked John with a bit of caution. The only people who even entered another person’s room in the bedsit without permission were also the most likely to start a fight. He was not in the mood for a fight.
Sherlock was deeply concerned because usually by now he was awake, he wanted to try reaching out for John again but he knew better. Toby was putting up a heroic effort to wake up John whose nightmare seemed to be full on night terror at this point. Sherlock took a deep breath and tried to think of a way to handle this but his brain seemed to be on pause, he tried to open the door to the library and took shop in his mind palace but nothing seems to be accessible at the moment. So he kept deep breathing, he considered leaving the room, but he thought John waking up in an empty room would make the needed processing conversation afterwards much harder to start. He thought about possibly approaching John, but he wasn't sure he could do that and keep himself safe. He knew that if John was awake he wouldn't attack him, but in this state he wasn't guaranteed to stay safe. So he just stayed and let Toby do her job.
“Boy, obviously the twink done it the burn mark has glitter all over it,” said a leather daddy with a cigar in hand.
"Because you cock face, it got back to me and some of the fellows are giving me shit over it, and you know how much I hate to be undermined. Also I find it weird that your group finds it acceptable to confront siblings over these matters like it really squicks me out," snarked Aithne.
John joined them in the living room, he sighed. "Sherlock we should probably have a go at the shops because I am not thrilled at the idea that somehow we will have your family over for tea, with only. 1.2.3.4 bags of tea." He said as he was rummaging through the cabinets of the kitchen. Not too much food in there was appropriate for tea. Most of it was essentially toddler snacks, stale ginger nuts, potato crisps,and nutrition bars. There was some vegetables and milk in the fridge but ultimately the kitchen didn't have much.  They were the kind of folks who had a lot of take out, because well Sherlock has a lot of people who owe him favors.
“Oh,” Sherlock nodded and thought it through. He sighed, “okay John, we have enough data points, I now agree that the observation is no longer applicable and I won’t jumped to conclusions based on the state of people’s phones.” He waved at the patrons of the cafe.
John started laughing, he got out of the bed and offered Sherlock a hand, “yeah let‘ s get cleaned up.” He pulled Sherlock out of the bed, and he held his hand as he guided a naked Sherlock to another door in his room, it turned out to be a bathroom that was obviously shared.
