“Then pretend that I am one,” I smiled, “and I shall pretend to be impressed. I’d still like to know what sort of stories my hands have to tell.”
Holmes opened his mouth as if to say something, then shut it again, apparently thinking better of it. When he continued his lecture, his voice was still just as level, but I noticed his hands had started to fiddle with his dressing gown pockets along with his pacing.
I clicked my tongue at the jibe, but we were still both smiling and chuckling as I crossed the room to sit on the arm of his chair. He held out his long, pale hands to me, and I took his left one, holding it close to my face as he had done with mine.
Strange.
As he spoke, Holmes paced around the room, puffing thoughtfully on his pipe. I knew him to sometimes have trouble slowing down his thoughts enough to organize them coherently, and that pacing helped him focus. “That you were an army doctor is very likely from your left hand,” he said slowly. “You use it for firearms, likely because you are right handed and, as a surgeon, cannot afford to risk the recoil injuring your dominant hand.”
“Oh? And what might that be?”
"Pah," Holmes sniffed derisively, puffing on his greasy old clay pipe. "Complete and utter rot."
He repeated the process for my right hand, occasionally letting out little hums of interest or satisfaction. Throughout the entire examination, I thought with some surprise that although he seemed to completely forget my presence and regard my hands as if they were some fascinating piece of evidence, his touch was incredibly gentle. I had noticed many times before the light, careful touch with which he handled all precious and interesting things, but it was quite something else to experience it. I felt oddly soothed as he traced the creases of my palms and massaged my fingertips.
“Excellent, Watson.”
“Ha! I’d say that’s cheating, but I suppose it would be hard to miss with my hand right in front of your face.”
For a while, we were both silent. Maybe he thought that I was still conducting my little investigation, or maybe he was waiting for judgment. For whatever reason, Holmes was quiet as I held his injured hand in mine and felt the sting of old wounds. All this time, and we still bore the marks of those three lonely years.
I stood and crossed the room until I was directly behind him, and I took his hand in mine. When I turned him around to face me, his face was pale and tight, as if he were waiting for it all to come crashing down around him – this illusion that everything was as it had always been, that he had not been dead to the world for three years, that my wife had not died in his absence, that there was nothing for me to forgive.
He still did not turn to face me as he spoke. "To tell the truth, Watson, there is much more to be deduced from a pair of hands in action than a pair of hands at rest."
The implied apology hung in the air like tobacco smoke. A lump rose in my throat at the sight of Holmes, his back small and rounded and his hand clinging tightly to the doorframe.
But his gaze lingered on my left ring finger, where anyone could still plainly see the indentations from my old wedding ring. He must have felt me tense up, because he quickly resumed his examination elsewhere and I breathed in quiet relief.
A smile played at the corners of Holmes’s mouth. “Well then, sir, I shall start by saying that you are a doctor—”
“Now, now, you are not a doctor at the moment, you are a detective.”
"...You have made some other deduction."
“Good heavens!” I cried exaggeratedly. “How
Holmes bit back a smile, fingers tapping against the bowl of his pipe. "Well, perhaps not always. But to my credit, I could have been far
Holmes squinted at me across the fire. “It would be hard to say for sure, even for myself,” he admitted begrudgingly. “I have some difficulty retracing my steps, so to speak.”
My heart swelled and ached. "My dear, dear Holmes..."
And someday, I would tell him that all was forgiven. Someday, when it felt true.
"True," I laughed. "You are quite unique."
“Still,” I said thoughtfully, “aside from... well, that last thing, I do wonder if you would have been so confident in those deductions if you didn’t already know my history and habits, or if you weren’t working in reverse, intentionally or not.”
“Oh, something like that.”
To my surprise, when I glanced up at Holmes, his face was turned away, his eyes darting around the room, anywhere but at me.
the only one in the world. You would be hard pressed to figure it out."
There it was. His lips pursed just slightly, his brow twitched barely. But it was enough.
I did not, however, imagine him lingering in the doorway. "Watson?" he said quietly, his back to me and one hand resting on the doorframe.
a violin.”
I turned his right hand back over, and spotted a particularly irregular scar across the top of his palm, as if he had torn the flesh on something. When I traced a light finger over it, he seemed to start, his hand jerking slightly in my grip.
I swallowed and looked back to my book, trying to keep such unpleasant thoughts at bay. Scarred we may have been, but we were both assuredly alive. By some miracle, I was here again in Baker Street, and I had held his hands and felt his pulse and seen the proof of his survival.
“Both,” I laughed.
“Why don’t you let me examine
Yes, that was the word. We had survived. And someday, I would let him examine all the scars upon my heart, and perhaps he would let me do the same.
It was a minute before he continued, but I waited patiently, for he seemed to be struggling to put it into words.
"Yes, Holmes?"
"I am afraid that I fall short in that respect," he continued quietly. "I examine things like problems to be solved and made sense of. I do not like to think of pain, because pain is senseless. And so I fear that I have treated yours like an inconvenience that will go away with time. It is not, and it will not."
I smiled and stretched out my hands. Holmes’s eyes took on that familiar dreamy gaze as he took my left hand in both of his and began his examination. He bent quite close over my palm, his fingers restless in their strange ministrations. He bent and stretched my fingers, one by one, examining the nails closely and feeling for callouses. Then, he moved down to spread my palm and run his fingers lightly over the skin. Once satisfied, he turned my hand over and once again bent and stretched my fingers, though this time he seemed to be observing the muscles and tendons of the hand rather than the fingers.
“Indeed.” He finally sat back down in his armchair, sighing a little. “Apart from that, I’m afraid I can’t deduce much thanks to your habit of washing your hands so frequently. Save that Thurston’s wife has finally decided to leave him.”
I snorted at him, leaning back in my chair with arms folded. "You really think you could do your usual trick just by looking at someone's hands, old man?"
One long scar across the back of his right hand I thought I recognized, courtesy of Joseph Harrison and his knife. As for the rest, I could not be sure which were from villains and which were from Holmes’s own carelessness.
I laughed ruefully. “You’re right, though that happened after I came back to London, old fellow. After you—”
“Mm,” he hummed, still not looking at me. “Perhaps that is true.”
Holmes nodded, looking a little rueful. “Agreed.”
"You examine me like I am the most interesting thing in all the world," I said softly. "I shall likely never understand why you chose me as a companion out of all the people in this city, but I will never be anything less than grateful. We have much to talk about, but I want you to know that I never once regretted any of it, and I never will. It is my greatest joy and privilege to be with you."
"...Well, old man," I finally said, patting his hand and releasing it, "I'm afraid that's all I can fairly deduce. Even when I first moved in, I couldn't peg you as a consulting detective."
you know that?”
"My dear Watson, I would be delighted." He leapt from his chair, clearly eager for a chance to occupy his mind. He knelt down beside me and held out a hand.
"That you are a doctor is obvious," he finally said, his voice oddly hesitant. "That you are a
Again, he looked as if he wanted to say something, only to then change his mind. He puffed on his pipe in silence as I sat back in my chair and picked up a book from the side table, and for a while he remained silent, his expression obscured by the cloud of tobacco smoke. But I could see his hands, one tapping restlessly on his knee, the other clutching his pipe in his long, slender fingers.
Holmes’s eyes glittered with humor. “Interesting idea! Well, Watson, be my guest. You have said before that my trick is a very superficial one, perhaps this time you’ll land it.”
“Ah, but I’m a doctor, remember?” I chided him with a twinkle in my eye. “I could be an author of monographs, not popular literature.”
out of it. Today, you came home from the club far later than usual, with chalk upon your left hand and a grave look on your face, and you have since been so preoccupied that you still have yet to wash off the chalk. I could only fear the worst for your friend Thurston. But you need not confirm or deny,” he added quickly, seeing my guilty countenance, “for I know that would put you in a false position. Forgive me, perhaps I should have kept that last deduction to myself.”
“It would be a safe assumption that you are a writer,” he went on, “thanks to the callous on the second finger of your right hand, consistent with how you hold a pen rather than a knife.”
Holmes smiled a little at that. "Well, to be fair, I
I resumed my examination, already a bit stumped for what else to look for. His hands were plenty scarred, but where he got each one from, heaven only knew. His finger tips bore the marks of him having drawn blood many times for his chemical experiments, his palms had undoubtedly been scratched up repeatedly from climbing up rough walls and rooftops and searching for clues in the dirt, and on the backs of his hands and even down his arms, I could see countless battle scars.
"Perhaps you'd care to demonstrate?" I asked, playing along.
“No no, it is no indiscretion on your part,” Holmes assured me, “simply nosiness, perhaps, on mine. I have told you before how I noticed that you use chalk between your left forefinger and thumb when you play billiards with Thurston, yes? Well, last week you asked for the key to the drawer to fetch your pocketbook so that you could lend Thurston some money to take his wife to dinner. I can only assume that his little investment in South African securities went belly up and his wife was sore with him, and you, in your infinite kindness, tried to help him smooth it over, since you were wise enough not to invest but not quite convincing enough to talk
"Sherlock?" John asked, somewhat worriedly. "What's wrong?"
you had something urgent to do. You don't.”
“Say it now,” she suggested.
“But he missed it.”
Whatever had come into the bedroom did resemble a cape, like Helen had described. But it hadn’t been one. It was different. It was
Sherlock nodded, slowly taking that in. "So what do you do now that I've found out?" he asked, not sure whether he wanted to know.
John scratched his neck, thinking. "It'd take a bit of practice to do that from downstairs”, he said, “but I don't see why not."
John had pressed his lips. "Why are you telling me this?"
“Hey.”
“The phone call was being monitored,” Sherlock responded from his spot near the sofa. “I had to convince Moriarty’s minions that you wouldn’t find out the truth so they’d leave you alone.”
, he thought.
Helen blinked. “What… what do you mean? I’ve told you everything I know, I-”
“Partner?”
But aside from that, it was the one thing most people failed to notice about Sherlock Holmes: the fact that he, under his cold ‘high-functioning-sociopath’ facade, actually had feelings. He wasn’t a machine. He was odd, yes, and he hardly ever thought with his heart; but he was human after all.
“You, trying to pull out the knife. Is it some project you’re working on?”
That “other day” came a week later.
His gaze fell upon Sherlock, sitting there on Helen’s bed, lost in a sea of deductions and speculations. To that day, John still found himself marvelling at Sherlock’s brilliance. He had been captivated by him as soon as he’d met him. But instead of diminishing over time, the admiration John had for him just kept growing.
meant. The fact that he barely understood wizarding terms did not mean that he wanted to look like an idiot.
Then there was Helen’s stepfather. Although it didn’t fit with Helen’s claims about the cape, Sherlock could still tell the man knew something about the circumstances of Julia’s disappearance. And not only did he know, but he had threatened Sherlock, who he knew was a detective. He was definitely trying to keep the truth from surfacing.
“Sherlock?” John called, sensing the uneasiness in his silence.
“Still, however it happened”, he continued, “they got away with it. The case is closed, which takes me to the next important question”, he paused. “If Julia was reported missing, the police should still be searching for her. But they stopped investigating after three weeks; they declared her dead.”
She looked up at Anna, tears beginning to form in her eyes. “I know.”
He breathed in, gazing at the ground for a second, then up. “You told me once that you weren’t a hero. There were times I didn’t even think you were human, but let me tell you this,” he paused. “You were... the best man, and the most human human being that I have ever known. I was so alone... and I owe you so much,” he said, his voice breaking.
, but if John was sleeping, he realised, he there
“Cemetery,” John said, simply. “You wanted to see your grave. We’re going.”
He passed Sherlock his gun. While it was true that it wasn't the best weapon against magic, he needed Sherlock to be able to defend himself.
Sherlock heard the front door click open. Those must be John and Mrs. Hudson. “Well,” said she, her voice rather small. She’d been crying. “You’re always welcome to come downstairs... for a cuppa, if you want...”
John frowned. What good would that do?
Though Mycroft didn’t tell them, Sherlock knew he’d be slipping money into John’s bank account until he could start work again.
“So you feel that this is your fault?” said Ella in a professionally calm voice.
Sherlock smirked, evidently having connected the dots. John, on the other hand, fidgeted with his wand, not quite following him.
Sherlock watched powerless as John reached his gravestone, sat down against it, and swallowed sip after sip. “This is it,” he said. “Your grave.”
Thanks to Steph for the beta!
“You read the papers?” John asked, baffled.
He couldn’t. He went right through it, not even feeling it brush against him.
It was going to be a long, arduous conversation, so John made tea as Mycroft took a seat on Sherlock’s armchair. “But that’s
Sherlock smiled, shyly, tenderly. “I was always afraid to tell you”, he confessed.
Suddenly, John's hand was holding his, and before Sherlock could even begin to ask, he felt his whole body contort. It bent in all directions, his eyes sinking into his skull, his arms stretching out. It was as though he was being sucked by a vacuum cleaner. And then…
You give me too much credit. I’ve simply come to this park often enough to remember. There is a definite advantage to devoting my work to one city. Did you know I could tell where you have been in London by the dirt on your shoes?
“Sir…”
“Half the world would want you, could they see you now.” John pushed Sherlock’s legs up, so that his feet were nearly against his bottom.
He wandered throughout the library, trying to occupy his mind with other things. Again, he wished that he could read the books, so that he might have some other subject to think about. It would have been a pleasure to read more about chemistry, or some other interesting subject, such as music. Unfortunately, the language of those books was too complicated for him to decipher.
LESTRADE
“Pardon?”
John wasn’t sure how far up his master’s leg he was permitted or expected to clean, but the temptation was immense. As respectfully as he could, he carefully glided the sponge past William’s knee and just up his thigh, into the water.
“Sir… Could I have your seed, anyway?”
Lestrade sighed, and slowly, he said, “My lord, I’ve devoted most of my time to his company for these two years of your reign.”
Looking directly at his mirror image, Sherlock saw the colour of his skin, which was always too white, no matter how much time he spent outside. The contrast against his dark hair made his skin look even whiter. His fair complexion made him look delicate, and fragile. This was, again, sadly indicative of Sherlock himself.
Sherlock folded his arms and huffed. “Then what are you waiting for?”
He is a detective, and he will do more for you than anyone else could. Do not underestimate his powers of deduction and observation. He does not see. He
Why not? If two chaps, as you call them, want to move as one, trusting that the other will feel their movements and match them with the upmost care and grace, why would that be a problem?
SHERLOCK
John was shaking, and he groaned. “Oh, Sherlock, please join me, won’t you?”
“Then,” Sherlock murmured, “it really is okay if I can’t sire your children.”
The most neutral territory was far away from the castle, in the middle of town. The location was an old public house that had been a staple of the area for many years. It was time for midday lunch, so there were working folk in the place who swallowed down their drinks and made just enough noise to make each conversation private.
WATSON
A little flame burst inside William’s chest. Oh, to be the man who could throw royal propriety to the wind and sniff whatever part of John that John allowed him to! He was not Sherlock, but it was hard for William to care about that at this moment. The king dropped to his knees, and lifted one of John’s feet, enjoying how John touched him to keep balance.
Keeping his voice humble and not impertinent, John dared, “You did enjoy it, though? Uh, last evening more than this morning, no doubt.”
An imaginative, almost mischievous light sparkled in John’s eyes. “Would you lie back, m’lord?”
Your brother pays me nothing.
As he reached for the chair across from me, the strange man cried, “Oh!” and faced me again. “I have forgotten to introduce myself! Awfully inconsiderate of me.” He thrust his hand forward. “I’m Bertie.”
“John, I’m a-about to… I can’t…”
It was devastating to Sherlock. His failure to serve the king’s intimate needs adequately must have been what had left the man despondent. It was probably difficult for the king to be cheerful when Sherlock was such a disappointment. Perhaps he pitied his poor servant, and did not tell him this out of altruism.
“We do not have to.”
“That’s it, Sherlock. You’re so good. Just like that, just let it happen.”
What was he to do now? Dress himself in the dark? Draw the curtains and wake his master?
Bertie laughed. “We’re a real pair, aren’t we?”
“I know, sir,” John murmured, though he still looked down at the floor. His sweet, beloved John. He deserved all that William could give him, and all that Sherlock felt for him.
WATSON (V.O.)
“No, don’t be sorry. I thought that was a charming sound.”
SHERLOCK
“Isn’t it obvious? I must be married to have an heir. I hope that wearing a veil is acceptable to you, and a dress, I should add. Such a disguise will be sufficient from afar, especially as the priest will be our confederate.”
MYCROFT
“John?” Lestrade asked, with emphasis. At last, John snapped to attention. “That’s better. I know that you have a lot to think about right now, but you need to know the state of things in the castle.”
“Ah, well… No secrets, yes?” Mycroft hesitated. “If you must know, Lestrade is a very creative man, and sometimes, we—”
“It’s all right.” William smiled. “It is the least I could do after you saved my life.”
Sherlock’s hand moved further down John’s body, well into the water, circling over the man’s stomach. “Of course, if you wish… Ah!” He briefly came into contact with the aroused part of John’s body before he meant to, but was overjoyed to feel that John was excited already.
John held Sherlock and murmured softly to him as the beautiful servant finished in the king’s grip. There was a raging ache in his own trousers, but John did not want to bother with that now. He simply wanted to hold Sherlock.
John anchored himself with a knee to lean over Sherlock’s lap, and he kissed his servant’s forehead again. He loved Sherlock so much.
“I’ve kept it in my office, though I think I could carve a compartment in Silver Blaze for it.”
Then John bowed, filling his master with a host of indecipherable feelings, and left him, into the castle where apparently Lestrade was hidden. It occurred to William that he could follow John to discover where the elusive priest had gone. That step was unnecessary, though. John was a reliable attendant who would take care of his master’s request.
The servant’s heart was breaking inside. William sounded so sweet, and it made John miss his close presence even more. To hold back the deluge of his solitude and offer his lord a response at the same time was infeasible, and he only trembled, burying himself further into his sheets.
Surrounded by thyme, rosemary, and the warmth of his servant, Sherlock could do nothing but cry out his beloved’s name and think of all the times he had rested under John’s attentive care while the sweet man told him stories.
“He wanted her passionately.”
You’re sure you’re not having me on, Holmes? You, and Dr. Watson?
Carefully, John removed himself from the fine linens he had slept in, and made the bed immediately. He wished he knew more about his duties, but keeping this bedroom tidy must be one of them.
It was a nice enough piece, done in a realistic style by a competent hand. The hues were light and soft, conveying a gentle, peaceful feeling.
Sherlock felt a touch of pride for lighting the fire himself, by striking flint and steel. Now he liked to think that, through it, he was somehow reaching out to try to warm the majestic king.
MYCROFT
“Oh J-John, Your Majesty,” Sherlock moaned, arching up from the built-in bed of the caravan.
SHERLOCK
“Dr. Watson, I know that you are trying to be helpful to Mr. Wooster. I have come across your blog, and I believe that you generally intend to be helpful.”
Sherlock was touched, and eventually, he had to speak up. “Is something bothering you, sir?”
John felt at peace as he woke, slowly opening his eyes to the dim calmness of morning. He was nestled in luxurious linens, and comforted by the warm, firm body in a dressing gown behind him, and by the solid arm around him.
John couldn’t count on anyone else in his life, not even the enchanting man who sat next to him in church, who was so captivating under the waning evening light that fell through stained glass upon his graceful form. Sherlock now turned wistfully towards the glass. “There must be something I can do.”
A barmaid came to ask him what he would have. Acting with more confidence than he truly had at the moment, Sherlock told her that he had a friend coming soon, and they would each appreciate a dark, frothy mug. He chose the finest of their ales. While nobody unfamiliar with the castle would spot the king in his plain coat, he was still a gentleman, albeit one quirky enough to find company amongst farmers and craftsmen. In any case, there were more than a few men of high station seeking a night of genuine enjoyment in the establishment. Sherlock Holmes did not seem out of place.
I have come upon Mycroft curled up on his couch, staring at one of the inspector’s fabled letters, wishing under his breath that he didn’t have to hide from Lestrade.
John turned to face William. “No, please, you can tell me,” he said, hopeful and sympathetic.
The king recalled the unassuming question he had posed to this enchanting servant.
With as much care as a man walking on a narrow bridge, Sherlock walked to where Mycroft was standing. He muttered a soft hello to the woman, and smiled at the baby.
“You don’t have to feel so guilty, sir,” John said. It was crazy that he could not address this man as openly as he had in the chapel, but the servant felt no less desire to reassure his friend.
“He’s an arrogant, cowardly fool!”
Please.
You make too many assumptions from penmanship. This is why everyone should use Braille!
Still dressed in his dressing gown, Sherlock took hold of the sponge and soap, kneeling at the side of the bath. “You may call me Sherlock,” he said, his own voice deeper than he would have expected. He was not immune to the sight of John, naked and flushed, in his own bath.
“Leaving this town?” The idea was incredible to Sherlock. This town was the only place he had ever known. Living somewhere new was an exciting prospect, as well as a frightening one. In any case, such a thing was not feasible. “I hardly have the means for travel, sir, and I would not know where to go.”
LESTRADE
That was fine with the attendant. William had been very kind to John, so it was all right to be ignored today. To let his king enjoy leisure time alone, John turned to leave the room.
Sherlock smiled. “I learned that and many other things from your charming family.”
Some part of John’s fogged mind knew that the words he had just spoken aloud were very important, and would bring consequences later. He didn’t want to think about those consequences right now, however. It seemed far better to lie in contentment, to hold Sherlock close and keep him safe.
“There are a lot of things I’d like to do with you, John. You said that I would never have to fight it, if I need you.” Returning to the bed, Sherlock, blushing, couldn’t quite meet John’s eyes. “Please, sir, take me. I want to be your maid, I want you to serve you in every way.”
There was some truth to that, but Sherlock didn’t see anything wrong with it. “I told you before, I’m not religious.”
John couldn’t face the inexplicable gratitude in Sherlock’s features. The king turned towards the window instead. “You shouldn’t say that. It’s not a good, pure feeling, Sherlock, that I have for you. It’s possessive, and greedy. Don’t mistake me for one of those romantic heroes from fairy tales.”
At the end of the night, when his dear John was sleeping soundly, William knew he was bound to the man whose stomach he was stroking gently. The royal heart in William’s chest could be given to no other. But he could not fail his kingdom either.
“What ho, old scout!” Bertie greeted me, using a couple of old-fashioned expressions that he was fond of. I supposed he read a lot of old books. “Want a drop of something to drink?”
What did you think of my little disguise?
Soon, William was taken under John’s power as John told him mysteries that engaged his mind. It was incredible to be under John’s influence in such a way. William longed to give himself to his healer. He wanted his storyteller to entrance him with tales of excitement, danger, victory, of all kinds of stories.
Sherlock nodded, but he said nothing.
His mind had been hard at work that day, sorting through the traditions and views of his kingdom. When he returned to his stately bedroom, however, and saw what was waiting for him on his regal bed, his mind went utterly blank.
Tenderly, John pushed another finger into Sherlock. “I’ll fill you with me, I’ll take you completely. It’ll mean so much. We’re together, we’re connected, we’re doing what we both want to do with each other. And it will leave a lasting feeling in both of us. It’s natural and beautiful. It’ll feel so lovely, when I fill you with my seed.”
“My dear John.”
MYCROFT
WATSON
“John, I’m sorry, I did not—”
WATSON
WATSON
Sherlock gasped, and reflexively grabbed onto John. It made the king happy that his servant would reach for him like that.
He went to the chest at the foot of the smaller bed he no longer used, in order to store his new clothes with the rest of his belongings. When he opened the chest, a small toy that had been in his possession for years caught his eye. It was a little wooden horse with a rocking base.
“But…” And here I finally gave in to the question that had been burning in my mind hotter than the tea in my mug. “Aren’t you two dating now?”
The priest had given his ear freely to William more times than the king could count. Though part of that was in the priest’s regular duties, there had always been a concern in Lestrade for the sovereign that transcended professional obligation. In fact, considering the petulant demands and damning confessions, there must have been something powerful that kept Lestrade in the service of the exacting king.
“I wanted to have your children. I truly did.”
If Mycroft was amused by Sherlock’s unpredictable moods, he didn’t show it. “Although, if you want the total truth, I should say that, in a sense, he is generally the one shagging me.”
“She’s beautiful,” Sherlock whispered.
There were many different rooms in the temple. There were discussion rooms, altars, and an enormous hall with colourful stained windows. At the moment, the hall was being used by a chorus of monks, who sang to the accompaniment of the pipe organ.
“Not for lack of trying, I observe,” Mycroft noted affably.
WATSON
“His umbrella? Are you sure?” The king sounded steadier than his shocked state should have allowed. William had never thought it possible that his brother would have held onto it. “Was it made of wood?”
“Would you please sit on,” Sherlock considered his words, “on our bed, John?”
“You mean, when I got so jealous at that tavern, that I brought you to the caravan just to keep you to myself?” John asked, gratified when his servant blushed and giggled. “It meant so much to me, to hear you cry my name like that. And then the second time, I asked you to call me by name, didn’t I? You made it sound like music.”
Overcome with a desire to comfort Sherlock, John climbed onto the bed, onto his blushing servant’s lap. The king, bearing his usual confidence and dressed in his noble finery, felt acutely how different they must have looked. The shy, slender, modestly-dressed servant was nothing like the proud, broad-shouldered, formally-attired king.
This struck John as particularly odd. Weren’t they merely talking about music? Why shouldn’t they talk about music?
“Where is John.” It was definitely more of a statement than a question.
John stepped closer to where his servant sat, and reached around him so that he was holding Sherlock, with his hands on Sherlock’s back.
WATSON
John’s eyes were wide. “You wish for us to do that?”
LESTRADE
“Let yourself enjoy it, Sherlock.” The king’s hands drifted away from Sherlock’s rear, to stroke over his thighs and rest soothingly on his servant’s smooth legs, which were secure over John’s shoulders.
He perceived that the sky was growing darker outside. It was time for him to return to the elegant inn used by the richest members of their convoy, where King John was staying. Sherlock would not be sleeping there, of course, as he was to stay with the other servants in modest accommodations more appropriate for someone of his position, but it was Sherlock’s duty to make sure that King John had everything he needed for the night.
“Oh, John…“
“No, I think you truly are magical. You use your magic on me, so that I can’t think of anything else but making you my own.” Once again, John gave Sherlock a light squeeze, which provoked another enchanting whimper. “If you’d let me, Sherlock, then tonight, I’d show you what you do to me. I’d use those chains to keep you still, so that you would be completely mine.”
“What?”
Noticing that King John was not undressing himself, Sherlock asked, “Sir, what do you need me to do?”
Now it was William, John noticed, who was trembling. The noble lord grunted in an obvious effort to control himself, but then William thrust once against John’s thigh. “Oh, sorry…”
That was all that John needed to hear.
John held firm. He didn’t want to fail William. “But he could help me acquire clothes that would meet with m’lord’s approval?”
Anyway, I’ve cleared that up, so I’ll go on with what happened next:
They had left the library and its settlement behind, and were continuing their journey along with the rest of the convoy.
Then William groaned, and joined him whole-heartedly, despite the streaks down his face.
“No, John, I will do something for you.” Sherlock took John’s hand, and gently helped the servant onto his feet. John, though a little flustered, followed without complaint. He walked quietly as he was led to the bathroom.
“And that look, too,” the king added, smiling.
Still, people of all stations could hum.
Thank you, Watson. I’ve learned much today. This should aid me in my investigations considerably.
“I’m still a novice sir,” Sherlock remarked, though he couldn’t hide a smile.
“Let’s go see it, then. They won’t turn me way,” the king, who was dressed like the proud nobleman he was as usual, proclaimed with certainty. “You’ll come in with me, of course.”
not hold himself back from doing as he truly desired? Sherlock moaned softly, as affected by the kiss as he was by the desires encouraged by John’s closeness.
It’s time we left, isn’t it?
SHERLOCK
Ah. This detective might discover what others could not. How did I not think of that before? Watson, and perhaps you too, Lestrade… I will have answers to the questions we cannot ask. I will have you reveal everything, and you will not even realise it.
John stood up from his chair. “What’s the way you can’t serve me?”
LESTRADE
Sherlock had acquired a closer seat for that contest, but the king had worn a helmet, so the servant could not make out anything more of the king’s face. Truly, that was a pity. Sherlock would have appreciated having a face to hold in his mind as he cleaned yet another sword. This task would be so much more interesting if he could picture the features of one who had the strength and character to wield this weapon and use it as only the noblest warrior could. He would have liked to know how the king looked when he grunted from the exertion of swinging a sword against his inferior opponent.
Charmed and flattered, Sherlock giggled. At once, he tried to muffle himself against the pillow.
“Yes, sir. For the horse, one thing means another thing, and that’s that, as you said. I envy such a simple existence.”
Sherlock didn’t recognise the voice, which was strange, as he would have remembered such an authoritative tone. “No, I—oh!” he exclaimed, when at last he turned.
John noticed Sherlock’s hand bunching up the sheets on the bed. “I didn’t know this weighed so heavily on you.”
“Welcome to the party.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock. You don’t need to learn it right away.”
“It is
SHERLOCK
“I hope I will see you in the audience at the joust.”
“My car is here,” Bertie said, glancing at the window. “There he is.”
But then…
“Thank you.”
John kissed his servant then. He did not want to overwhelm Sherlock, so he restrained himself, though he could not keep some of his passion out of their kiss, especially when Sherlock softly moaned. This embrace was terrifically pleasing, though it did more to tease the king than to satisfy him. Alas, they were in a public place, and the kiss could not last.
“I’m turning in for the night,” the king muttered, solemnly.
It was the least John could do, when he had just done the cruelty of telling Sherlock he loved him, as well as the bit about John’s name. He only hoped that Sherlock would forgive him, when circumstances forced them apart, as they someday must.
MYCROFT
For reasons I need not discuss at this moment, yes. It seems I am lost without an instructor, though.
There would be challenges to overcome in this life, and no doubt there would be still more after that; Sherlock was eager to face them all with John at his side.
“I, um,” Sherlock muttered. “This is like when we first sat together, at the tournament. Isn’t it? Sitting on a bench like this. I was thinking similar things, then. That I was insufficient. And you are a great king! Why should you want me around?”
Sherlock had said quietly, almost inaudibly, blushing a pretty pink.
“Um, no.” John was caught between his bittersweet amusement at Sherlock’s request and the dizzying fact that he had just been deemed William’s cherished servant.
Sherlock stared, shocked. “Never. Do you think you have?”
Sherlock removed the belts from John’s storage chest, and the tall bottle as well. “What should I do with these, John?”
The king would have loved to slip his hands into Sherlock’s curls, but he didn’t trust himself not to clutch Sherlock’s hair too fiercely. The reality of this was overwhelming; it was a struggle for him simply to stay still. Adamantly, he reminded himself that he could not lose control. No matter what desires coursed through his limbs, he could not hold Sherlock jealously and thrust wildly into his mouth, even if his body screamed for it.
“Well, the look on your face just now. I hope I get to see you look at many things with such awe.” The king turned his attention back to the horse, and the road. “It’s good to travel with someone who can appreciate the wonders of the world.”
“How can I serve you, sir?” Sherlock asked, devotedly.
“It is generous of you, Dr. Watson, to take so strong an interest in my issue,” Jeeves said graciously, “and very understanding of you, Mr. Wooster, to be so patient with me. I am grateful that you are allowing me another opportunity, sir.”
“Y-Your Majesty!”
SHERLOCK
“O-Oh,” Sherlock stammered, tilting his head down, hiding a smile in his shy, adorable way.
WATSON (V.O.)
It felt to Sherlock as if the breath was knocked out of his lungs. He finally considered how odd speaking of this with Mycroft was. He stared at his brother.
John’s insides ached at that thought. If he were to be kept in the castle at all times, he wouldn’t be visiting the church, not the one where he saw Sherlock. John would no longer sit on a plain pew and hear the magnificent voice of his friend. Maybe Sherlock would visit the castle? Clearly Sherlock was a nobleman of importance. It was possible that Sherlock occasionally had business with the monarch or one of his advisors.
“Absolutely. In fact, I wanted to talk to you about something. Hah, you really do distract me!” John chuckled, and Sherlock smirked a little. “I forgot to tell you that I spoke with my advisors today. They think it’s possible for me to will the throne to an heir of my choosing, and it seems likely that the public will support a tournament.”
“Well, I don’t think there’s any doubt about that.” Bertie laughed, in a feeble and nervous way. I think he was starting to think this wasn’t such a good idea, because the hopeful spring from before was already fading, but he carried on. “You see, it’s up to you whether you give us the answer. You’ll know the answer, of course, if an answer there be, but one doesn’t like to pry where prying’s not wanted. Not that you’d want any prying at all. We know you’re a private fellow, certainly. And there’s no harm in giving it a miss. Oh, not that we don’t want to know, though.”
WATSON
Having been brought by his passionate king to this private room, which contained such an indulgent piece of furniture, Sherlock’s imagination ran wild. He blushed intensely.
Oh, I see! You are
As things were starting to get out of hand between the two men of famed intelligence and personality (to put it one way), I was also becoming weary of our situation, yet I was intrigued by Sherlock’s observation. I had no idea Jeeves had been in the true rank and file. Should’ve seen it in his résumé, I imagine, but then again, I’d more or less hired him as soon as looked at him.
But that did not mean he was eager to drive the big, intimidating horse standing in front of their caravan. He knew that King John was able to direct the large animal, but that said little for Sherlock’s chance of success.
Like lightning, William whipped around to stare him down, making John flinch.
to search for a child for you. Do you expect that I could find one simply by strolling through the trade district, or visiting a few churches?”
I understand.
John hummed in thought. “Does he know how much you like stories?”
“I’m s-sorry,” Sherlock stammered, at a complete loss for what to do when being touched by both of King John’s hands and enveloped by his gaze, “I d-didn’t mean to alarm you. My mind sometimes wanders.”
SHERLOCK
means slow down. Don’t mix those two up. Also, you can tell the horse to walk, to trot, or to canter.”
Suddenly, Sherlock sat straight up in his chair.
“It’s remarkable, isn’t it? You can tell which part of town you are in by the soil alone.”
Heavy guilt inundated John. “I put that burden on you, didn’t I? I talked about heirs and all that…”
Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat. “On your bed, sir?”
Perhaps, Sherlock, he admitted having some shallow fondness for me. You must have misunderstood him if you think otherwise.
SHERLOCK
“Those are all different things?” Sherlock asked, bemused. He didn’t see how there could be much of a difference between walking and trotting and such. The king really did know so much about the world, so many curious facts that interested the inexperienced servant.
Sherlock recognized it instantly, that melancholy that he sometimes observed in King John. Something had caused King John to be sad again. The urge rose within the servant to ask what the matter was, but he was only a servant, and asking about what was undoubtedly a personal matter would be inappropriate.
“J-John, yes, more… Oh!” Sherlock cried, when John moved just right in him.
Sherlock shuddered in fear of the bitterness this comment might provoke, but instead, Mycroft was merely charmed.
“Relax, Sherlock.” John could not say in good conscience that he was in love with his servant, but at least he could make him feel pleasant things.
Good. There, that’s the basic steps. Easy enough.
You must see some redeeming quality in me. After all, you let me move in with you.
Did you not observe that two individuals who care deeply about each other could share love regardless of what they look like? Regardless of colour, or if they should both be men?
“I apologise for not announcing my visit. I’ve barely had any time, and I’m doing my best to handle the press
“I know that silence. You’re thinking,” said John.
John shot a deadly look in his general direction. “I’m not gonna tell him that, Sherlock. He’s in shock.”
for britpicking this chapter, and to Steph for betaing it! I'd be lost without them.
He knew it must’ve been Sherlock who left that note. It wasn’t his typical handwriting – it looked much less neat now, almost like he didn’t know how to hold a pen – but he’d signed it:
John was silent, head still trying to process the new information. He didn’t mean to blame Sherlock for it, let alone expect him to be able to stop it happening; but it seemed so strange. All this supernatural business was so alien, so irrational, that it felt nearly impossible to understand how it worked. But then again, the fact that they were having this conversation would’ve seemed absurd a month ago; so John guessed they’d just have to expect the unexpected from now on.
The door opened.
“Sherlock…” John begged. “Believe me, if I had told anyone, it would've been you. I just…” he paused. “I couldn’t. The wizarding world… it’s bigger and more complex than you can imagine. There’s a statute of secrecy. So many laws and measures… I wasn’t
Meanwhile, John was staring at the living room. To be precise, he was longingly looking at his friend’s armchair. He couldn’t believe it. Sherlock was gone. He had killed himself. He had admitted to being a fraud.
“Sorry,
, John would be alright. Sure, John was alive; the whole point of jumping was to keep him safe. But he wasn’t fine. He was a mess, even when he tried to pretend otherwise. At the end of the day, they both knew Sherlock wasn’t easily fooled.
But Sherlock remained immobile, staring blankly at the cabinet. John frowned. They had to go after the Lethifold, they had to find more clues. Why wasn't Sherlock coming?
John shook his head. “You wish, Watson,” he whispered to himself.
Again, thanks to Steph for the beta
“Downstairs”, Sherlock exclaimed. “The dentist’s practice, remember? I paid it little attention earlier, it didn’t seem too important. It’s Helen’s mother’s! Dolores Stoner! It would be the easiest thing for Roylott to sneak in there and let the beast out through the back window", he explained. "A window
The flat was eerily quiet; no sound but the electric hum of the fridge and the ticking of a clock. John and Sherlock stepped inside, trying to make as little noise as possible so as not to startle Helen, thinking her asleep. But as John approached the sofa to wake her up, he realised she was not there.
Sherlock had no time to respond, for right then, three people teleported into the practice.
He had been wrong, he supposed.
Sherlock looked back at him, every inch of him trembling.
The wizarding one has hurt him enough already.
, he thought,
“John, please, we should go back home,” Sherlock begged. “We can come back another day.”
. Yet his words betrayed him, for they escaped his mouth before he could stop himself. “Was it something I said?”
and could
, per se, in the flesh and bone. And it felt so wrong, ‘cause Sherlock was right here! Eternally loyal to him from beyond the grave!
This was not a field in which he had expertise, though he saw that there were similarities between the works of each individual artist. However, across all the pieces, there was great variety in size and style. John didn’t personally like all the works himself, but he supposed that everybody had different tastes.
WATSON
What he told me about his life was rather interesting, though I wonder if he meant his stories to come across as more serious than they seemed to me. They were actually pretty funny. Bertie got into a lot of ridiculous situations.
WATSON
“You are familiar with herbs?” John asked, sounding genuinely pleased.
MYCROFT
“Absolutely,” John said, without hesitation. “Do you want the painting after all?” He would happily purchase the painting for Sherlock. He would give his servant anything.
The other man visibly relaxed. “I see,” he said, a new interest in his voice. He stood up, and approached John, appraising him effortlessly. “An apothecary… The son of one, rather, though you are an expert in your own right. You served in the war, no doubt.”
LESTRADE
WATSON
John felt sympathy for the arrogant brothers who had once been so close. “And you were Sherlock to him?” he asked.
Jeeves stood up from the table, and gave me some obscure expression, like a smile, but more subtle than that.
John swallowed the words of affection he longed to say. He settled for something more suitable. “That’s what I’m here for, m’lord.”
Holmes.
“Well, there you are.” John grinned. “You give me everything I need. There’s nothing else I want.”
“Hah, did I say too much?” John sat on one of the old benches, and was relieved that the thing felt sturdy under him. “Sorry. Go on, keep looking at the flowers.”
“I would not mind, sir.”
Just like that, Sherlock was off, with as much enthusiasm as I imagined he had for the most interesting cases.
“You don't need to. Stay with me.” Now William opened his dressing gown—his own significant need apparent through his clothes—and closed his thighs around John’s length.
“Is this all right?”
Sherlock could not contain his desire for John any longer. “Lie on your stomach,” he murmured. “And keep your hands together.”
I have never seen your eyes before.
At last Mycroft spoke. “Not quite on the same level as my shame, but I appreciate your effort.”
“You have a very active mind, don't you, Sherlock?”
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
What?
“Of course. There is no risk. You will be at my side, won’t you? Fetch a sword from the gatehouse.”
SHERLOCK
Oh. Yes. Certainly. Splendid.
“I give you a few things, maybe. I provide a little company, and some… physical diversion, though I am inexperienced in bed.”
John stepped closer to William, modestly clasping his hands behind his back. “That’s beautiful, sir.”
“What is it?”
Hoping to work off some excess energy, John had decided to shoot a few apples for sport. Having paid the orchard for the privilege, he did just that, making sure to do so while Sherlock watched.
SHERLOCK
“Don’t worry about that.” There could be no doubt that John had been physically stirred by sharing this intimacy with Sherlock, yet it was not the most important matter to John at the moment. “I’d rather lie with you like this for a bit longer.”
John wasn’t sure what that reaction meant. “Sherlock? Are you all right?” Concerned as always for the comfort of his sweet maid, John took his hands back.
MYCROFT
Heat rose in the king’s body at that instant. To be asked about these foul devices by his innocent maid suddenly brought images to his mind that were deplorable.
Furthermore, I hadn’t thought Jeeves would be at Bertie’s home. In my mind, a personal assistant was someone who drove all over the place, constantly picking up coffee and laundered clothes. It was reasonable to think that a PA does some work in an office, too, arranging schedules and setting up meetings, yet that hardly accounted for him being in Bertie’s apartment. Unless Jeeves was here as Bertie’s boyfriend, and not as his PA?
SHERLOCK
Indeed! You will see that he is a brilliant man. Clever, resourceful, and discreet, of course. He will solve your problem.
It was impossible for John to look away from what Sherlock was doing for him. Those pink lips of his servant looked so beautiful around his length. Sherlock tasted him, sucked him, and moaned around him. It thrilled John to know that Sherlock would do this for John, and would find pleasure in it.
They left, and so Sherlock and John were left alone, finally. Sherlock was starting to wonder if he’d have to be the one to start the conversation, when John spoke. “Sorry.”
Greg knocked on his bedroom door. “John?” he asked, but there was no reply. Why wasn’t he surprised? He knocked again. “I’m coming in. Better be decent,” he warned.
John didn’t say it out loud, but he had to admit, it
“That doesn’t matter!” John shouted, exasperated. “To Helen, she’s dead, so you’ll respect that”, he ordered. “And you’d better explain that brilliant plan of yours, because I don’t see how we’re going to get a bloody cape to come here and try to kill us.”
There was silence for a second, during which John thought maybe it
“Couldn’t you... I don’t know, sleep?” he proposed.
“Alright,” Sherlock pursed his lips, trying to decide where to start explaining. “I... You know that dreadful film we saw the last time we had a movie night?”
Sherlock had sacrificed himself for the person he loved. And John loved him in return.
That’s when it came back to him: how Jim Moriarty had planned to ruin his image, how he told Sherlock that he had to commit suicide to spare his friends’ lives, how he needed to hit the airbag to survive... He’d thought he’d make it out alive, he really had. Or at least, he’d hoped. But then again, he noticed that he could feel no heartbeat; and he thanked God, or whoever was up there, that he wasn’t breathing either, because otherwise he knew he would have been hyperventilating by now.
“To keep Helen silent”, John murmured, understanding Sherlock’s point. “So that’s the plan. We stay here and see if Roylott tries again?” he asked. “What if he doesn’t? What if it wasn’t even him who killed Julia?”
Sherlock stood up. “I've got to go”, he said hurriedly, already heading to the door.
“Could we go to the cemetery?” Sherlock asked, tentatively. “It’s not far from here.”
. I’m not okay. I’m never going to be. But it is what it is, and what it is is...
They were downstairs.
So he’d just pretend he was alright. Break the silence, not let him suspect the storm that was going on inside him. That’s what he told himself as he tried to sustain the conversation about metaphysical energy and God-knew-what.
. Without John, he was nothing. He was air, oblivion, a figure of the past to everybody else. He was alone. The only thing, the only
He hung it on the fridge door just as John climbed down the stairs. All he could do now was hope that Lestrade would see it.
Helen shook her head, confused. “It can’t be. I told you, I saw a… a black cape!
While Sherlock didn't know the word's exact definition, he deduced it must have meant non-wizard folk – after all, the spell had only affected
They pulled away, slowly, hesitantly; lost in each other’s eyes. Light was beginning to surround them, the hospital bedroom and the staff’s efforts to revive John long forgotten. Sherlock took John’s hand in his, cupping his cheek with the other.
authorities?” Helen interrupted.
In the kitchen, Sherlock’s mind was racing. He couldn’t find enough clues, and it was driving him up the walls. There was more to this case; there had to be! It was obvious that Helen’s stepfather was hiding something. Why else would he have threatened them? But there was something about the man that Sherlock was not seeing. Something staring right back at him.
Trust him? How could he

But Roylott… Roylott had dozens, perhaps hundreds of creatures, all within arm’s reach. And the Lethifold was ideal: a killer beast that left no trace of its presence. Julia would’ve stood no chance against it, being a Muggle.
John blinked. That completely sounded like Mycroft, but they couldn’t have been so obvious, could they? They’d been careful. All John had done was speak to Sherlock when nobody was watching. Anyone would’ve assumed he was thinking out loud.
“John, please...”
He cleared his throat. “We should, um… we should probably get back downstairs”, he said.
“Julia was always trying to convince Mum to leave him. I used to do the same, at first; but I gave up after a while. It was pointless”, she explained. “Mum always says she can’t; says he’s gonna hurt her if she even thinks about it. And what could I do? What could Julia have done?” she asked. “We couldn’t tell the police our stepdad was a dangerous wizard; they would’ve thought we were mad.”
He controlled John’s every move via CCTV: every time he left the flat, everything he did inside it (at least what he could see from the security camera across the street), his strolls across Regent’s Park, and so on.
“Can I turn on the lights?” Greg asked.
. He had pointed a
“Sherlock”, John said, warningly.
Septimus Loptson is a minor OC that I created for this fic. Feel free to make a deduction about him in the comments! I left some clues ;)
“John”, Sherlock whispered. His eyes were open wide, examining John as though they were seeing him for the first time. He covered his mouth with shaking hands, unknowingly attempting to conceal the fact that he could not find his words.
. That was what terrified Sherlock the most: he had no name for what had attacked them.
John sighed. "We have to obliviate her after we're done here”, he explained. “I told you, there's a Statute of Secrecy."
I wasn't going to post this today, but it's our favourite heale- I mean,
And besides, John didn't feel welcome among wizards. Being muggleborn, he had been terrified during the war. Every day, he would wake, not knowing if he would live to see the sunset; not knowing if Harry and his mum were still alive. And even when the war had ended, John hadn't forgotten: hatred was still present. It was still out there, pumping through the veins of every blood supremacist, even those who hadn't joined the Death Eaters.
Although John tried his best not to let any of his worries show on his face, Mycroft was far too observant to be fooled. Something was amiss. Still, he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Was it anger? No, John usually smiled when he was angry. Sadness seemed unlikely. If Mycroft didn’t know better, he would’ve said his expression held guilt; yet even that option didn’t fit the puzzle.
“He had to, to convince the snipers. In all likelihood, the conversation was being monitored. He couldn’t tell you,” Mycroft sighed. “I think he would have wanted you to know. He never intended to go on with the lie once you were safe.”
“Indeed”, said Sherlock. “He was the one who killed Julia. Upon realising this, we went after him, but he attacked us, and in defending ourselves, we had to kill him.”
“I’ve been trying to pull that bloody knife out of the mantelpiece for the last six hours, but I can’t do it.”
He managed to pick up a psychology book from one of the shelves, and read all of it to try and understand what he could do. He got a better understanding of some things, like, for example, how recovery is never linear; but aside from that, he didn’t find much useful advice.
“You can sleep, you know”, Sherlock spoke suddenly. “I’ll wake you up if something happens.”
-Helen's stepfather being manipulative and violent.
“Expelliarmus!” Roylott shouted.
“Helen, um…” he hesitated. “Roylott’s dead.”
“Yeah”, John said. “Most wizards describe it as a black cloak, so it’s not strange that you thought that’s what you saw. This thing… it, well…” he sighed. There was no way to put it nicely, he supposed. “It suffocates people and eats them”, he said. “It’s one of the most dangerous beasts in the world.”
John blinked. Was Sherlock trying to get away from him? Was he really so mad at him? “Sherlock…”
“I need to tell you something, but... I’m not sure how you’ll feel about it,” he said, trying to break it slowly.

“Eighteen months since our last appointment.”
, he thought,
He could read people’s entire lives just by looking at them. Whether they were married, what kind of job they had, whether they liked it, where they had been the night before… It was all displayed in front of him like a painting at a museum.
The skull slid across the mantelpiece.
Hello!
John had to admit, if this was indeed his imagination, it was doing a bloody good job. Everything Sherlock had said made sense. It sounded just like him. It wasn’t just his timbre – it was the way of expressing himself, the details of his plan, the fact that he’d known this might happen...
Quietly, he ran a hand through his hair, careful to be gentle when he woke him. A curve made its way up Sherlock’s lips, fond and trembling. He wished it didn’t have to be now, but he knew it was time.
“In any case”, Sherlock went on, as though he were pretending he hadn’t just said ‘brilliant’, “it was a happy coincidence for Roylott that you moved here after you and your girlfriend broke up. That way, he would be able to kill you easily if you tried to finish Julia’s plans to make your mother leave him, or if you ever got the police to reopen Julia’s case”, he explained. “That’s why tonight, seeing that you had come to us, he let the Lethifold into your bedroom, thinking you were there. He repeated the operation.”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Nothing of importance, really”, he said, walking into the living room. “You’ve kept Julia’s furniture, have you?” he asked Helen.
After some minutes of fighting with a pencil, Sherlock finally managed to write a note. It was scribbly, as if it’d been written by a five-year-old, but it was legible enough. He picked it up, holding it against the window and hoping Mycroft was still watching them.
And even though he knew the reason, it was something he was not ready to admit. How on Earth was he ever supposed to acknowledge that the man he loved was gone before he could take his chance to tell him?
“We do need to ask you some things, though”, Sherlock interrupted.
, thought Sherlock, who was leaning against the wall behind Ella,
he wrote, drawing a smiley face next to it.
“No, Miss Stoner, you haven’t”, Sherlock responded.
It’s useless in the end. She doesn’t make it.
Special thanks to
It was larger in size than John would have imagined, but he recognised it at once. A Lethifold. It was sliding under the window, but it wasn’t touching the wall - instead, it glided above it. The beast’s skin was jet black; and had John been a muggle, he too would have easily mistaken it for a cape.
“Well, uh, I’ll be in the kitchen, then,” said Lestrade. “Need some water.”
Helen nodded slowly, moving towards the sofa and sitting down. John and Sherlock followed.
been closed, so the question was: why? Perhaps the judge had been bribed into it. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time the justice system was corrupted.
John pursed his lips, thinking. “I dunno”, he sighed. “Perhaps… a Confundus Charm, or the Imperius Curse”, he suggested.
“Well, yes. Not that there was anything else to do,” Sherlock replied. “I was bored.”
John.
“What Ministry?” Sherlock asked. He was almost begging John to be clearer at this point. There was so much he still didn’t understand. And yes, Sherlock knew it was too much to learn in one night – it hadn’t even been an hour since he’d found out about magic, for God’s sakes. But John kept using all these strange terms, like
John sighed. “Look, it doesn’t matter, Greg,” he spoke, still dizzy. “What are you doing here?”
I know the hedgehog's a bit cliché, but I had my reasons to choose it as John's Patronus.
“I see you’re getting better at deducing,” Sherlock joked. “Timing. Sorry.”
SHERLOCK
What?
The barmaid returned with their drinks. She obviously noticed the unspoken tension between the two men and gave them their refreshments quickly before seeing to the next patrons.
Thinking of how much more he was soon to be filled brought hot excitement to Sherlock’s spirit, though it was a calming and consoling thought also, that his king would truly use him that way.
Do not let yourself get carried away, just because you are attached to a man—
Stunned by the king’s sympathy, Sherlock could hardly speak. “I owe you much for this, sir,” he managed to say. He trembled with gratitude, and his voice was close to breaking. “I wish I had some way to repay you. There’s nothing I can give you.”
“I could not bear to let any man take you from me… Oh, my dear Sherlock…”
Father Lestrade nodded. “He is in a particularly sour mood today, and I don’t want anything to upset him.”
You daft pillock…
Without getting onto the bed, Sherlock stroked John’s foot. “You can ask me anything.”
“You’re so lively, Sherlock. You’re curious about so many things. There’s beautiful energy in you. I could barely stand it. When you were humming to the music of the chorus, you were so enchanting. It took all my willpower not to hold you close like the treasure you are. And then you were so fascinated by the bees! It was too much. And now, I must watch you admire these flowers, and I can do nothing but admire you. There’s nothing wrong with you touching the flowers, but I shouldn’t touch you.”
“Good memories,” Sherlock added, making John feel better. “It’s a shame I can’t be more like the woman was in your story.”
“Oh, and now I can talk again?”
“I’m y-yours, sir…”
Sherlock grinned, pleased with himself for surprising John. “It is true. Mycroft was, unfortunately, quite clear with me on the matter.”
That devastated John like a splash of cold water. “Oh, Sherlock. No, that’s not why I want you. You don’t need to give me a baby.”
If he held with him the memory of a broad-shouldered king with a commanding voice and caring eyes, then that was his own business.
“That’s it—just no? Well, I see speaking to you will not only be fruitless but excruciatingly boring.”
This question seemed to catch the servant off guard. “Um, yes, sir. Do you remember that?”
“Sherlock, you’re doing a great job here. You’ve cleaned the swords well.”
SHERLOCK
Better to turn them away quickly.
Eventually, they were returned to the castle. At once, Sherlock took John’s hand and led him to their bedroom. The king wondered if his love was blushing under that veil. Would things be different between them, now that they had promised themselves to each other?
“This is okay, yeah? We don’t need to do this.”
“What about you and Bertie? You two aren’t on a first name basis either?”
John stopped eating immediately. What was William saying?
“Don’t worry, I’ve got you.”
“You are a good master, sir,” Sherlock murmured. “I like being yours.”
“It’s all right. Well, it’s true that I didn’t get what I wanted out of the tournament. To be honest, it’s a relief to be away from that place. I’ve got nothing against your town, Sherlock, but the tournament…. I’d hoped to find some excitement in the tournament. I used to love doing things like that. It’s just not enough, now. It’s not what I really want. I suppose I knew that already.”
Sherlock still looked uncertain, so John placed his hand on his servant’s shoulder. It was a discreet and brief action, but it seemed to help Sherlock somewhat. His shoulders relaxed, and he smiled. “Really, sir?”
The first item he showed to John was a small bottle with crushed herbs inside. Sherlock opened the bottle, and held it under John’s nose. With the discerning instincts of an apothecary, John sniffed the mixture.
“Lestrade is probably in the chapel now. Bring him here, please.”
Are you sure? It is not my place to say, but a jealous Mycroft might be to your advantage later on.
“Did you not like the music we heard?”
“That’s fine, we can take it. I don’t see why not, since it was probably forgotten here. It looks a bit heavy, though. I’ll carry it for you.”
They walked down the quiet road, and returned to the tavern where their carriage awaited. King William crisply informed the coachman that he was ready to return to the castle. They set off without further delay, William wordlessly taking his seat opposite his anxious servant.
Mycroft smiled, and then he was laughing too.
Sherlock gasped. “Is there no indecency you two have not pioneered?”
WATSON (V.O.)
Bertie went on a little more about Jeeves’s virtues, yet I was still stuck on what he had said. Considering his relatively young age, I hadn’t thought Bertie’s money was inherited. So Bertie had lost his parents at least, and maybe other relatives. I had also been left almost without family (and sometimes it seemed like I hardly knew my sister anymore), so I could relate to at least that aspect of his life. There was also the fact that Bertie was younger than me, which probably made it harder for him. I wondered how long he had been on his own, though I didn’t think it would be right to ask.
The servant was smitten with this man, with what they were doing together, although his joy was diminished by a fear that he would not be allowed to do this again. Noblemen were still men, and they could become lonely as many others did, but John did not think that he was worthy enough to hold a place of meaning in Sherlock’s heart. He was King William, after all, which meant that he had his pick of all the country had to offer, but for this moment at least, he had John, and John could give him everything.
SHERLOCK
My letters…
LESTRADE
Again struck by the king’s compassion, Sherlock almost giggled again from sheer embarrassment. “Well, I don’t know about that. But this town is very boring. It would be an adventure, to go somewhere new. Of course, that is impossible.”
“You do not need to assist me,” William said, loudly enough to be heard over the filling water, but in a subdued tone.
Without bothering to discuss it, William adjusted his clothes back to a reasonably proper state, then wrapped his arms around John and pulled him under the blankets, hugging him. “You wouldn’t make your master sleep alone, would you?” William asked, yet despite the arrogant words, there was nothing but vulnerability in his voice.
SHERLOCK
“Sir. Please, sir.” There was rattling as Sherlock’s arms started to shake excitedly. His legs also quivered where they lied on the bed at either side of the king. John thought those legs were long and elegant, as pretty as the rest of Sherlock. Easily, John raised his servant’s legs and steadied them over his shoulders. They felt light on his broad, strong body.
Sherlock, you utter blight!
“After we are wed…” John repeated dazedly. “Oh! M’lord! I’m sorry, I forgot to ask Father Lestrade…”
“Sir,” Sherlock said, affectionately. “I’m glad to finally be in your kingdom.”
By the time Sherlock had finished changing for bed, into his sleeping gown and bonnet, his master had changed into a loose shirt and trousers. It brought mixed feelings to Sherlock to see that the king’s chest was mostly covered—the servant was relieved that the handsome sight no longer taunted him, but he missed it sorely—yet the collar of the king’s shirt was a low one, so that Sherlock could still see some of the hair on his chest. Another notable aspect of the shirt was that it had no sleeves.
“Oh, yes, please, sir!”
“Lord above, Sherlock…” That was one image that didn’t help John resist this at all.
LESTRADE
“Well, John, there’s more. It might be justified, since his Highness has some strange demands for this position. You’d have to stay in the castle all the time, and do everything he says.”
“What is it?” John asked.
“Ah, and that’s how William came to be the present King Holloway,” John noted. “But I thought our side did pretty well during the conflict? I mean, when all was over with. I was there, I should know.”
John couldn’t say no to his servant. It was shameful, how quickly he gave in. Whereas he ought to have refused, he swiftly undressed himself, with a little help from Sherlock. Before long, he was exposed in front of Sherlock, who stared at the thick, flushed evidence of his master’s longing. Sherlock licked his lips, and the king felt himself grow heavier.
The dungeon was like new to John now. Shackles and chains seemed to glow with a meaning that John had never comprehended before. He saw with startling clarity that these tools could help him please his servant. Were Sherlock restrained in such things, the king could satisfy his shy servant completely and endlessly. Sherlock was often too modest to give into pleasure entirely, but if he gave his permission to the king, then John could hold him still with these bonds and fill him with pleasure and bliss. His dear Sherlock would be helpless to desire and gratification. He would be free to writhe and scream in ecstasy under his king.
“Oh. Splendid!” Bertie cried, joyously clapping his hands together.
Indeed, it is a wonder I did not feel this exemplar of moustaches from across the room!
“What do you mean, old top?”
SHERLOCK
“I hope so,” John said.
SHERLOCK
“May I?” The question was asked by the lowest, roughest voice Sherlock had ever heard.
Despite the sorry implication that Sherlock had been distanced from his brother for so long, John chuckled.
It was a struggle to reach the inn while he was plagued by these thoughts, but the full force of this impossible desire did not hit John entirely until he and his servant were alone in the room they were staying in at the inn. Once he was away from prying eyes, John knew abruptly how hard he had been working to subdue the yearning within him. He couldn’t keep it up any longer. It was too much to suppress. He also couldn’t impose on Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
WATSON
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock replied playfully. “After all, it’s only fair that you have flaws to balance my own bad habits, isn’t it?”
“Mmm,” John sleepily replied. His eyelids were becoming heavy.
He had to admit that there was a certain aspect to the chore that was a little fascinating, at least at first. It was interesting to feel the weight and smoothness of the weapons used by the esteemed fighters who had come from faraway lands to compete in the tournament. The ways in which the heaviness and sharpness differed between the weapons used by warriors from different kingdoms, who each employed varying materials and fought with different techniques, absorbed the under-used faculties of Sherlock’s mind.
Sitting up from the driver’s bench, the king appeared to give some signals with his hand to the caravans behind them, and then he turned to Sherlock, though his manner was still distant. “We’re stopping to rest, here. Just for a little while.”
Sherlock moaned. Witnessing this jealous side of his king, expressed solely for the sake of keeping a servant, made the sensations Sherlock was experiencing even more exquisite.
Do my ears deceive me? Mycroft would never venture this far out of his way.
“I’ll always love you,” Sherlock told him, tenderly reaching around John to free his hands.
Well, Mr. Peterson, it’s a private matter.
Surprised and delighted, Sherlock giggled, and the adorableness of it charmed John completely.
“There is nothing to be said.” William’s voice sounded lifeless to his own ears. “Nothing at all,” he muttered, and now all he heard was bitterness.
“Wayward infants end up in the care of priests in one way or another, I’m sure.”
After climbing into the caravan, John helped Sherlock into the vehicle, too. They sat together on the built-in sofa, looking around at the gold-painted details and fine tapestries of the interior, faintly illuminated by windows that were partially covered.
Footsteps drew near, and a deep voice distracted John completely. “Is God treating you well, John?” A tall man with dark, curly hair and a wool blue scarf sat next to him on the pew. “He owes you that much.”
Sherlock turned them down, being surprised by their attentions, but quickly concluding that these were noblemen with neither good taste nor good intentions.
MYCROFT
“You wouldn’t be able to divulge it to me. And Montgomery made his disapproving view of confessing to a priest very clear to me in the past. He wouldn’t have told you anything.”
SHERLOCK
“No, sir,” John said. He returned to his place by King William’s side. William was looking at him, his hands trembling so much that he placed his carving knife on the table, and John was entranced.
Sherlock was on the bed, on his knees, wearing a black gown and a white apron with intricate patterns. He was also wearing a dainty headpiece that was tied in the back in a large bow. The dress was familiar, though it took several long moments for John, dumbfounded as he was, to recall that the ensemble had belonged to his previous maid.
It took a very long time for Sherlock to fall asleep after that. His body and heart wanted other things, and his mind worked relentlessly to find some way to make himself suitable for his master. Sherlock wondered if it took a long time for the king to fall asleep, too, though probably, being near no better muse than Sherlock, the king was able to quickly forget about the passing desire that had undoubtedly come about merely from prolonged physical contact.
SHERLOCK
Though he had just been thoroughly satisfied by his master, the servant’s heart hammered away in his chest. “I pleased you, sir?”
The tension that John had felt in the caravan when he’d had Sherlock in his mouth, the longing that had simmered in the king for ages, possibly this entire time, returned to the king all at once. The force of his urge to possess his dear maid was beyond stopping now. He had never needed anything like he needed Sherlock.
What, do you think Watson would not accept that my brother is a black man? Assuming you’re still black. I’m still not sure how much these things change. Well, Mycroft, then you don’t know my companion.
A cold feeling gripped Sherlock. “Have I done something wrong, sir?”
He grunted from the onslaught of gratification and perfection, and listened to the charming music of Sherlock crying out in pleasure.
John deserved to be treated with more generous care than a pompous king could ever bestow.
John’s grasp on Sherlock’s hand was no longer light. “Sherlock, you’re in my heart. Having a child with you isn’t going to make that any more legitimate. I want you, baby or no.”
“I’ll do with the shower, but I’m not in the mood for telly.”
“Simple”, said Sherlock. “Your stepfather was abusive and controlling. He managed to stay married to your mother for quite a long time; even though she had long fallen out of love with him. He liked being in control - making her scared of leaving him, cutting her off from others.
to. Magic was a part of John, as much as were the little crinkles by his eyes or his questionable taste in jumpers; and Sherlock wanted to embrace every single detail about him.
Helen smiled at them, somewhat tiredly. “Alright”, she said.
He considered the possibilities. Julia’s case couldn’t have been closed just after three weeks, that alone was fishy. But it
what killed my sister!”
"As are a few other people, including myself", Mycroft had remarked. "My brother seems very fond of you, doctor", he'd said, "so I'll give you a piece of advice. Don't perform magic anymore."
to tell you.”
Stepping back, John vanished in the air.
Sherlock paused. “When I recovered consciousness, I was confused at first. I didn’t understand why I was standing by St. Bart’s, and for a split moment I forgot what I’d done. Then I saw you, and everybody else, standing around something on the pavement. I assumed there had been a murder, I wanted to examine it...” He sighed. “But I instantly recognised my own body. I’m not much for feelings, you know. But I can’t begin to tell you how horrifying it was. I panicked... After that, I lost consciousness again. And now here I am.”
He was hooked. Sherlock was like unicorn blood: he had saved him so many times, and in so many ways, and now John couldn’t let go.
London greeted them with heavy rain, which was most unfamiliar to Sherlock now. If he extended his hand, he could see the raindrops go right through it. He could feel them if he concentrated, but he tried not to. It wasn’t exactly pleasant.
John chuckled. “The Confundus Charm would make them confused and probably forget about the case for a while. And the Imperius Curse is… much worse”, he said. “He’d have complete control of their actions; he could force them to close the case or something if he wanted to.”
“I’ve got an idea. What if you take a shower,” Greg offered, “and I’ll make us some popcorn? I brought some films for us to watch.”
“Ah-ah,” John denied, gripping the bottles so tight Sherlock couldn’t toss them away from him. He wasn’t strong enough to, and John was using that to his own advantage. “We need to talk, and I need to drink.”
John narrowed his eyes. “So... you can’t leave the flat?” he asked. “I guessed that. I mean, you would’ve said something about how useful it is when you want to run after criminals without been seen.”
“I love you too, John Watson.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure how, but he was now at Baker Street. A few days had passed, he assumed, since things looked slightly different than they were the moment he’d last left his flat.
John sighed. “First, we’ve got to make sure Helen will be safe.” He stood up and walked to the door, only to find it locked. Just like it had been when Julia died.
“Help’s here”, John said to Sherlock, awkwardly.
“It’s not, though I do suppose it was the only logical way for me to react; but it was still wrong of me to ignore you after everything we’re both going through.”
“Ah,” he said. “Odd, all of it. But then again, I’ve always liked it when impossibilities come true. I find it... fascinating.”
Mycroft grinned, studying John’s face. “He says I’ve been spying on you.” It wasn’t a question.
Of course John didn’t fall for it. Mycroft lived for the drama, even though he pretended otherwise. He could’ve phoned John like a normal human being and asked if he’d be welcome, but both of them knew John would’ve told him to mind his own business and spare the formalities. Naturally, he would’ve used far less kind words.
, Mycroft thought, his lips rounding. John must be seeing Sherlock, pretending he was still there. It was a coping mechanism, then. Loss was a tricky thing.
He cleared his throat. “John?” he called.
“No, I do,” John said. “I’m sorry I put you through that. It wasn’t okay. But what’s worse is, I still want to die,” he admitted. “And you’re probably right, when you say it’s no fun being dead and you try to stop me. I can’t help it though. Life seems so worthless without you in it.”
John sighed, pressing to fingers to his temple. “He says not to worry; he won’t haunt your house. He says haunting the flat is ‘more fun’.”
John shrugged, the corner of his lip slightly rising in empathy.
of paperwork at the Ministry”, Loptson commented humorously. “But back to the Living Shroud. Naja, you go left; Fernández, you go right”, he instructed the other officers. “I’ll check the back. And John”, he said, “let us know if you see anything.”
“No, Sherlock,” John said. “I’m staying here.”
“On top of that”, Sherlock continued, “he made sure Scotland Yard wouldn’t get too deep into this case. At first I thought he had bribed some officers”, he explained, “but now I wonder if he put some spell on them. John? Any ideas?”
John let out a dry chuckle, then sighed. “I know,” he said, his voice hoarse. “But there’s things I want, I
John smiled at Helen, apologetic. “If you, er, need anything, just let us know.” And with that, he too walked away.
“I… I can't go in", Sherlock muttered. "It's got that… charm… thing", he tried to explain, struggling to find the right terms.
There was something in Sherlock’s expression that John couldn’t quite put his finger on. He would’ve said he looked sad but… that wasn’t it. It wasn’t just sadness. Was it anger? Denial?
Hallucinations, right?
“Morning,” John said.
The next few weeks weren’t good. The realisation that Sherlock really was dead was hitting John hard. He’d rarely leave his bedroom, save the moments when Mrs. Hudson went upstairs and tried to make him eat. He usually refused to.
Sherlock bit his lip. “I can’t deny I’m surprised you didn’t trust me with your secret”, he admitted.
He tried to reach the body, but every inch of him was trembling, holding him frozen in place. The shock made its way through him as he used everything he had in him to remember.
“So, what is it that you wanted to tell me?” John asked as he sat down near the fireplace.
“That was like three days ago.”
"Only the Prime Minister is allowed to know about wizards."
He didn’t voice it, but John could make out the unspoken sentence.
“Oh,” said Sherlock. “Alright.”
“It’s...” he sighed. “Remember what happened after St. Bart’s, when I popped up in the flat without actually meaning to?”
Perhaps Sherlock didn't understand magic or the seemingly underlying cultural differences between wizards and non-magical people. But he
“And good evening to you too, John. I’m glad to hear you’re looking after yourself,” spoke an unexpected voice from the sofa.
His mobile buzzed in his pocket. He took it out, glad to see he’d just got a text from Lestrade.
“I...” Sherlock started.
Nothing happened. Sherlock grunted, refusing to be defeated by his non-corporeality. He had to keep working on it. The whole night long he spent attempting to make it move, but nothing came out of his efforts. The more he tried, the more frustrated he grew; hence, the less he could focus on it.
John let out a smile, though it was not a happy one.
Opposite the entrance door was the kitchen, which was separated from the living room by a long counter. Indeed, just like Helen had described, there was a window there from which the bedroom could be seen. The window was on the left wall, and it opened out to an inner area, as did the bedroom window. This area was so small and narrow that it couldn’t be described as a courtyard. It seemed its only purpose was to ventilate the building and let in sunlight.
, he remembered,
Decidedly, yet unsure where to begin, Sherlock set to work.
had his suspicions about whether John loved him back, it was also true that he could've got it wrong. But what else could he do? He didn't want John to hide himself from him anymore.
“Looking for… ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!” John cried. “I leave you here for ten minutes, TEN MINUTES, and your first instinct is to go searching for a beast that could kill you on the spot! Do you even realise how dangerous that was?!”
Catherine smiled at her. “Yeah, he is. He’s been through a lot, you know? Besides this, I mean. And he’s always managed to make it,” she glanced at John, who was asleep on his hospital bed. He’d been in and out those days. “And I really hope he will now, too. But I’m scared,” she said. “He could die. His heart’s really weak.”
He needed more information. That could wait, however. He wasn’t here on an enquiry, but to express his condolences... and an apology.
, thought the detective. He and Mrs. Hudson must’ve been to his funeral.
, Sherlock thought to himself.
John sniffled. “My best friend, Sherlock Holmes... is dead.”
Sherlock dropped the mop abruptly. The animal, startled, sneaked back inside the cabinet.
John ignored him. “You need the loo? I just have to brush my teeth, but you can go first if you need to.”
Together, they walked away, stepping into the eternity that awaited them on the other side.
Greg had been thinking a lot since last week; mostly about John, naturally. He’d been sick with worry, and he was even disappointed in himself for not having seen the signs. But there was also Sherlock.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He knew John was right, but he wouldn’t admit it.
“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “Cry all you need. Better out than in,” he assured.
“I… I didn’t know you felt that way”, John spoke, after what had seemed centuries.
John looked up at Greg, who offered him his hand and helped him up. “I’m sorry,” he sobbed. The tears started to make their way down his face, and Lestrade embraced him, scared that he might break him if he held him too tight.
“And you know why?” John carried on. “‘Cause I should be happy. You came back for me, you
, instead of just paraphrasing things; and it really wasn’t helping.
Even if he’d been planning to, Sherlock couldn’t have spent the afternoon haunting Mrs. Hudson.
“You’ve just said you panicked.”
And if John had no sense of self-preservation left, Sherlock was running out of options. Because there was one thing he was not willing to let happen: he would not have John Watson die on him. He would not let him starve to death, nor would he let sorrow consume him.
John thought for a moment. “‘Ghost’?” he chuckled.
“Yeah?” he scoffed. “What good has my blog ever done? My blog made Sherlock a public figure,” he said, furious. “It made him vulnerable to the media, to enemies. Enemies who used his fame to ruin him, to bring him down bit by bit until people didn’t trust him anymore. And you know what?” he asked, a menacing smile making its way up his lips. “Maybe, if I’d never written that bloody blog, Sherlock would still be alive.”
They were standing outside Helen’s door. Sherlock had suggested that they knock, but John had responded, far too calmly, that if he didn’t remove the protective charms first, they’d disintegrate as soon as they crossed the door.
He was still trying to process everything that had just happened. There was so much he didn’t understand. And Sherlock loathed not understanding things.
“Experiment,” Sherlock corrected. “Yes, I guess. I figured I should be able to do it, but it’s actually so much harder than it seems,” he sighed.
he tried again.
“Why today?” she asked, as a way of greeting.
Sherlock smirked. “Perhaps”, he said. “And if he got away with murder once, what makes you think he wouldn’t try again?”
As they made their way down the ladder, the place grew darker and darker. In fact, there was barely any light at all. Sherlock instinctively reached into his pocket for his mobile, so that he could turn on the flashlight; but then he remembered that a creature had taken it from him. Luckily, however, John seemed to catch on, and so did the other wizards: almost in unison, they whispered, “Lumos.”
A million questions crossed his mind, overlapping. He tried to catch up with his train of thought, struggling to comprehend what had just happened - he didn’t even know where to begin.
She sighed, lost in her thoughts. “I think I’ll tell you about it some other day,” she said.
, he thought.
“Oh,” John said. “Well, okay. I’m listening.”
John could hardly sleep. He lay awake most of the night, biting back the tears, not knowing why they even wanted to come out. His emotions were all tangled. His grief mixed with confusion, anger burned his stomach; the ghost of Sherlock’s voice this afternoon unsure which path to follow. Was he glad to be able to hear him? Was he mad at him? What was he even supposed to feel?
And then there was the bottle. That had cleared him of all doubts. It had flown away, like magic! It couldn’t have been John who’d done that, could it?
“John,” Sherlock said, looking out the window. “You’ll probably want to brew some tea. We’ve got a visitor.”
John ignored him and hailed a cab.
Truth be told, John wasn't as comfortable with this case as he was trying to make Sherlock believe. He had had no contact with the wizarding world in over a decade, and he had no intention of going back. It brought back too many painful memories.
“They think you lied,” continued John. “But I never did. Not for one second. I asked you to stop being dead,” he said, still drinking, “at your funeral. I thought you might be listening, but it turns out you weren’t. And then I come home, right after that, and you’re there. You were there!” he laughed, the alcohol taking effect. “As if you’d known that I needed you; that I can’t live without you. And it’s so
“What is?”
ARE YOU DOING?"
And still, he could’ve tried to find a thousand explanations for it. He could’ve blamed it on drugs, or fear… but there was one thing which he could not account for:
God, he’d been so right.
Sherlock refrained from saying it aloud, though. This was not the moment to argue; they were in the middle of a case. They had to work together. Instead, he tried to deduce as best as he could with the little information he possessed. It was the only thing he could do to overcome the shock.
“What now?” Sherlock asked suddenly.
“Not really. He’s here, I hear him, and wherever I go he goes too. Seems he’s tied to me or something,” John answered. “And there’s the skull thing as well,” he added.
“He doesn’t know. Not yet. We’re... still trying to figure it out, I guess.”
Sherlock smiled, cupping John’s face and kissing him back. “I know”, he said when they pulled apart. “Though”, he smirked, teasingly, “this case would've been much easier if you’d just told me you were a wizard before.”
John lifted Sherlock’s chin, making him look John in the eye. “It’s alright”, he said. “Now, listen. There’s a patrol on the way; they’ll be here any second. I need you to be nice, okay? Please”, he added. “For me.”
“Sherlock had worked out several possible outcomes to his encounter with Moriarty,” Mycroft explained. “Each of them had its own protocol, all of which were given a specific code name. After a while, Sherlock texted me, and we rushed into action.
There was a knock on the door.
So why wasn’t he?
“I’m afraid we’ll have to borrow your bedroom, though”, Sherlock explained. “I want to recreate the circumstances of Julia’s disappearance as accurately as possible. You’re to stay in the living room.”
Sherlock sighed, clearly frustrated by having to explain. "You said you lot can tell family, can't you?" he asked. "Roylott was her stepfather. Helen might
The nurse (Anna, if Sherlock got her name right) gently put her hand on her shoulder. “What matters is you’re here with him. It’s good for him to have company.”
“Sounds nice,” said Sherlock. “I guess I’ll just wait here and do some ghostly experiments.”
“Sometimes,” Ella replied.
Sherlock continued, not letting John speak. “What if I were… your partner?”
and said that.” He was lying. He did know (or so he thought), but Mycroft couldn’t know that, because where would he have found out? Only Sherlock could’ve told him, and that was the point, actually: he couldn’t admit it to himself. He couldn’t face the fact that Sherlock’s ghost was
John looked away. “For not telling you… that I’m a wizard.”
John frowned. Abilities? What abilities?
Around three in the morning, after centuries staring at the ceiling, John got up from his bed and reached for his cane. Under any other circumstances, Sherlock would’ve simply assumed John was having nightmares and needed a stroll around London to clear his mind. But tonight, he was worried sick.
for me and still this is how I’m paying you. But I can’t help it,” he spoke, his voice small and his vision swelling with tears. “I’m broken, Sherlock. There’s a part of me that’s not completely there and
If Sherlock hadn’t died, they could’ve had a future together. As friends, as more than friends; God only knew. But with him dead, all of it was reduced to a conversation that was barely even there, the reminiscence of what it used to be. Even if he named every little detail – the criminal-chasing, dinner, the Bond-movie marathons – it would never be enough. He missed
Mycroft studied John. “What’s he saying?”
John turned around and grabbed a cup to serve himself tea. He hesitated before he spoke again. “Never mind. We’ll talk feelings when you’re ready.”
John frowned. "Come again?"
John’s eyes opened wide, the surprise and astonishment growing in them. He must be dreaming, or hallucinating. This couldn’t be Sherlock. He’d jumped off the roof. John had seen him do it. He’d seen him fall and hit the ground. He’d taken his pulse. For the love of God, the sight of Sherlock’s lifeless body was still there, haunting him, torturing him, driving him into insanity. Sherlock simply couldn’t be talking to him right now. The deceased couldn’t speak.
As it turned out, John didn’t like to talk about Sherlock’s death, but Catherine had managed to find out what had happened all the same. Sherlock had died saving John’s life, Uncle Greg had told her, and John had been so depressed that he’d almost killed himself. After that, they’d sent him to therapy, and it had taken a while but he recovered eventually.
“Shall we?” he asked.
This wasn’t good. Sherlock hurried to the kitchen, deciding he must make good use of the little time he had left in the flat before John walked too far. He quickly scanned the room and found what he needed: a pen and paper. Struggling, he wrote:
His recent visit to Baker Street had gone mostly according to plan, but something was off, like one small section of a wall painted a slightly different shade. He couldn’t tell exactly what it was, but he
The place was desolated, naturally. Not many people liked to go there at night, possibly because they heard too many ghost stories. Sherlock would have laughed at the irony, but right now, all he was was concerned. There was nobody around to help him. He was counting on John’s limp to buy them some time, but he had no way of knowing if Lestrade had gotten his message, and he had to fear the worst.
Sherlock looked up. “Oh, right, you mentioned something. Who was she again?”
“What happened, John?” Ella said.
So he wondered. What exactly was it that he wasn’t seeing?
“Please, he’s my friend,” Sherlock could hear, among many other murmurs.
know about wizards."
People celebrate in the Great Hall, but it’s not over. They cheer and jump and hug; the wails and cries of the injured silenced, too weak for anyone but the healers to notice.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked, dropping his gun aside and searching John for injuries.
“Expecto Patronum!”
“It was”, Sherlock replied. “Mr Roylott was a smuggler; he traded illegal magical creatures. The cape you saw was one of them. It’s called a… Lethifold, was it, John?”
“Sherlock,” John interrupted. “Whatever it is, just say it.”
John closed his eyes. “Sher–” he started, but couldn’t go on.
“Did you say something, Sherlock?” John asked.
“It was the only way. Something was off, and I knew you wouldn’t tell me what it was,” he said. He then gazed around the living room, not quite knowing where to look. “I must say, dear brother, that your
Uncle Greg would say.
John opened the door and peeked in. Inside the cabinet was a long ladder, which led to some sort of underground office. He couldn’t see much farther, but the place seemed to be huge. It was clear Roylott had used an Extension Charm.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
John didn’t answer.
“What was your stepdad’s name?” John asked Helen, trying to make small talk. “He didn’t say.”
John smiled at Sherlock, cupping his cheek with one hand. “I love you”, he whispered.
John felt himself leave his body, peacefully and slow. And as Sherlock finally held him in his arms, the world was brighter, kinder; and he was younger as their lips touched, that long-awaited instant filling them with joy and relief. They were reunited, the dark nights slipping away, peace finding them at last.
John looked down. “Why do you wanna go?” he asked, dubious.
“Well, it’s like that. Except I’m conscious when it happens now, and it’s not exactly nice; so I just walk after you to avoid it.” He explained.
He turned to face the mantelpiece, trying to find something worth testing on. As his eyes landed on a small knife plunged into the wood, a sense of enthusiasm bloomed in his mind. Grinning, he drew his hand close to it and tried to focus.
After what had happened at the cemetery, it had been decided not to leave John out of sight for more than fifteen minutes. Mycroft, Greg, and even Mike had been coming round to keep him company. John preferred the latter two, but he hated not being able to talk to Sherlock in their presence, so it was good that Mycroft came as well.
“Someone must’ve brought it here”, Sherlock reasoned. Suddenly, he gasped, saying, “Roylott. He’s in on it, remember? He was hiding something."
It was followed by the sound of porcelain shattering against the floor.
Finally, the car stopped outside the practice.
Before John could stop him, Sherlock turned around and went into Helen’s bedroom, not saying another word.
No, it couldn’t be. It just couldn’t be possible. How could he be...?
No matter how many times John did magic, Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever get used to it.
He put it down five minutes later, knowing it would be foolish to spend all his energy in holding a sheet of paper up. If he was right about Mycroft, it should be enough time for him to get the message. Sighing, he lay down on the floor and waited.
“Roylott had always known that this was a possibility. So he made a plan: to keep Julia close, in case he should need to get her out of the way. He gave her this flat, just above your mother’s practice, because it was very strategically located. He had easy access to the practice, so he used his magic to hide his beasts there; and then, when he realised that Julia had finally convinced Mrs Stoner to leave him, he let one of the beasts out through the back window and into Julia’s bedroom. It was a flawless plan: the area the windows lead to is closed; it can’t be seen from the streets or alleys. There would’ve been no witnesses at all.”
I'm so sorry it's been so long since the last update. I've had a lot less free time since uni started. Besides, I had to rewrite this chapter from scratch about four different times because I didn't like it, and I didn't want to post anything until I was 100% sure I liked it.
Except he wasn’t really here. Instead, John felt like he was being constantly reminded of what they could never have; of the fact that they were so close, yet completely unable to reach each other. And that was all there’d ever be: the ghost of a friendship, of a life, that could’ve been more but never would.
There was seemingly nothing out of the ordinary. The only strange thing he did, Mycroft noticed, was talk to himself. Perhaps he was thinking out loud, wasn’t he? Lots of people did that. Still, that wasn’t like John. His time in the army had trained him to keep his thoughts to himself. So the only other possibility was...
It had only been a few minutes since John had left – Sherlock was fruitlessly trying to pluck the E string of his Stradivarius – when he felt himself being torn apart, as if he were fading. He panicked at first, thinking he was moving onto another existential plane (maybe Heaven, or Hell, or perhaps a different form of afterlife from some religion he’d deleted from his mind); but after some moments, he opened his eyes and found himself out on the street, standing just a few metres from John.
Sherlock looked up at him, his gaze emotional. “I love you too, John,” he said. “I’m sorry I never told you.”
John's expression turned sombre for a second, but he quickly managed to hide it. He pointed his wand at Sherlock (or, technically, poked him with it, since they were standing so close to each other) and said, “Protego totalum.”
Sherlock seemed taken aback at this. Clearly, it wasn’t the response he’d been expecting. “No, don’t you worry about that.” He smiled, though John couldn’t see.
John mouthed, holding Sherlock by the shoulders. The latter gulped, still confused, but nodded nonetheless.
Helen looked up. “D- Dead?”
, John thought,
“Oh, the limp is back”.
Mycroft pursed his lips, clearly frustrated by not understanding something. “Sherlock. He... he’s here, isn’t he?” he asked. “John, is my brother here?”
“I said ‘disappearance’, not ‘death’”, Sherlock corrected.
“You should get some sleep,” Lestrade said, once they’d finished dinner. “It’ll do you good.”
. Didn’t anybody understand? He didn’t want company. He didn’t want anything to do with anybody, living or dead. Instead, he wished that maybe, if he closed his eyes for long enough, he’d sleep for a thousand years. He just needed to lie down and vanish into nothingness. Hopefully, he’d cease to exist, or he’d forget that he did.
The words died in my throat. Holmes eyed me curiously, but it wasn’t long before his expression clouded, as though he could read my mind.
“Well, Watson,” he sighed, scratching his head, “I’m afraid that I cannot tell you very much that I did not already know after all these years. A stranger would have provided a much better demonstration.”
dishonest. It's a lucky thing that I never was tempted to try such a grift myself, as I have no doubt that I would have been quite good at it."
"Most certainly."
And so it did, but I knew that we would survive it. I took his other hand in mind, holding them both tightly.
“...Perhaps,” he said softly.
“...You seem to have had a real misadventure. I would wager your hand slipped while climbing something.”
I turned his hand over and examined his knuckles closely, running my thumb over the roughened and calloused flesh. “Your knuckles have been severely tried. Either you are a boxer or you have a habit of getting yourself into trouble.”
“Or a cellist,” Holmes said demurely. “Or perhaps a viola player. Or—”
"You aren't a spiritualist, Holmes?" I said in mock surprise, grinning.
“...It’s quite all right,” I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose and trying not to think on such heavy things. “Let’s just not speak of it again.”
And then, suddenly, his hands pulled away, leaving the skin of my palms strangely sensitive from overstimulation.
Holmes's eyes twinkled at me challengingly from behind a puff of tobacco smoke.
"Yes."
“Which would be your guess?”
hands, and we’ll see how much I can pick up even without your great deductive power and just from knowing you well.”
On one such day, sitting in our armchairs by the fire on a cool winter's night, a letter from our friend Dr. Mortimer prompted a discussion about about the failings of phrenology and other pseudosciences until we landed upon palmistry.
When I looked up at him, though his face had gone quite blank and masked, I thought I saw traces of something like... guilt.
doctor and... and a good friend is even more so. You always examine me like a doctor, seeking to find what ails me and how to heal it. That is because you are kind at heart."
“May I?”
“All right, all right, you at least play some sort of bowing instrument, most
Sherlock leaned against the wall, pleased. “Ask him if he liked the little touch with the skull.”
Sherlock nodded, resisting the urge to ask what exactly
“Muggle”, said John. “It means non-wizard people. Wizarding communities aren’t really involved with Muggles”, he explained. “We have our own government, schools, police force…”
Sherlock’s eyes opened so wide they were nearly popping out of their sockets, and his pitch rose by a few octaves. “
John closed his eyes.
John blinked. “Do you wanna hear me say it?”
“No,” he said. “Sorry. I can’t.”
Sherlock supposed magic must have had its logic. But how to unravel it? He was lacking so much information. How did it work? Where did it come from? Could it be learnt? Could he, too, perform magic if it was taught to him?
They were both silent for a while. There wasn’t much they could do, really, and John supposed they would just have to wait.
“He’s a fighter, your uncle,” Sherlock heard one of the nurses say.
A few days had passed, but Sherlock still hadn’t told John about his new discovery – that he was, somehow, apparently anchored to him. He simply followed him around, silently, as he pretended to stay at their flat during John’s absences. They could have this conversation later, when he figured out how to bring the subject properly.
In fact, when John stood up to look outside, he saw Mycroft hastening to the door. This couldn’t be good. Mycroft was generally well-mannered. He always said hello to Mrs. Hudson before going upstairs, and rarely did he walk into the flat without knocking, despite owning a spare key. But today, he’d straight up rushed inside, nearly knocking down the door to the flat as he opened it.
“No, tell me,” Mycroft begged. “I want to know.”
Two of them were women, one in her late twenties and the other no older than thirty-four. There was also a man around John’s age whose face and neck were full of scars. They were all dressed in identical black cloaks; which, although it was obviously a standard uniform, Sherlock found rather odd. Who in their right mind would wear a
He couldn’t believe it. She must know why he’d come. Everyone had been talking about Sherlock, even before he’d fallen to his... even before he’d fallen. His name was on every single news channel, and so was John’s, in one way or the other. And if Ella was as good a therapist as she thought, she must have been reading John’s blog as well. He hadn’t posted anything since, but that didn’t stop hate comments from being thrown at him on all of his blog updates. So she wanted him to say it out loud.
, thought John. She wouldn’t want to relive such a traumatic moment. God only knew how much courage it had taken her to even ask them to investigate.
Helen shook her head. “I don’t think so”, she muttered. “She and Mum argued a lot because of that, actually. Although”, she added, “they were starting to settle their differences not long before Julia died. I remember her saying.”
Mycroft had warned him.
Lestrade still had many questions, Sherlock noticed. The former had grabbed the pen again and was fidgeting with it, dubious about what to say next. Sherlock wouldn’t mind answering all of those questions, but Mycroft was about to leave and he didn’t want to do it in front of John.
“No, I’m afraid we can’t,” Mycroft forced an empathetic smile, “but I suppose that’s why I’ve come after all,” he paused, his gaze softer, searching for a spot to get lost in. “I owe you my deepest apologies, John. The last time we met, you were right. Feeding Moriarty information about Sherlock was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. It’s cost my brother’s life, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get rid of the terrible guilt that’s taken hold of my heart.”
"Sherlock?" he called. "What's wrong? What are you thinking about?"
“Do you think I’m not?” Sherlock said. John opened his mouth to respond, but Sherlock was quicker. “I’m angry too, John. I’m furious. Believe it or not, losing your own life is no fun. I know what you’re trying to do. That’s blended scotch. It’s 68% alcohol and you’ve brought
John frowned. “Go where?”
But then again, here he was. This was no coping mechanism made up by his subconscious. Sherlock bloody Holmes was really back from the dead. Well, kind of, because he was
perform magic", Mycroft had clarified. "Sherlock doesn't miss a detail. Should you cast the tiniest spell miles away, he would know something was off. I don't think he'd jump to the conclusion of magic… but I wouldn't risk it if I were you."
“Well, yes”, Helen said. “After Persia and I broke up, she kept everything, so it was good Julia’s things were still here.”
“Are you sure you’ll be okay?” John asked. “Do you want us to stay, or call someone?”
something he could do: experiment on himself! There was so much to learn about the spiritual world that he hadn’t explored. What if he
And even though he wanted to thank Mycroft for telling him all of this, how could he? His words were failing him and his entire body was shaking, his voice numb. Struggling, he managed to speak. “Why did he phone me?”
“Well, yes. That’s basic for the plot. How would he have met Whoopi Goldberg if he couldn’t?” John said.
His funeral, he realised. The word made it seem more real.
“Grimesby Roylott”, she responded.
be repelled?
John cleared his throat. “The cabinet’s bigger on the inside. I think the Lethifold might be in there”, he said.
Less than five minutes later, Sherlock had come up with a solution.
“Not hungry,” John replied.
He’d also told her about Sherlock. Sherlock, who’d brought a purpose to John’s life after the war. Sherlock, with whom he would run around London, chasing down murderers and solving crimes. Sherlock, blessed Sherlock, whose death had nearly destroyed John.
“I don’t even know why I bother to repeat what he says. It’s like you know it already,” replied John, taking a seat. “So you
John looked up at this. He should have expected Mycroft to drop by uninvited, but he hadn’t thought it’d be so soon after Sherlock’s death. His confusion must have shown on his face, for Mycroft was quick to explain.
“Nope,” Greg said. “Not gonna happen. But I’ll leave the lights off if that makes you happy.”
He hated this whole situation. He felt useless. What good was he here? He couldn’t do magic. All he had was a gun. He couldn’t even use his intellect in their favour - he knew nothing about spells or magical creatures or bloody
Lestrade’s eyes opened like saucers. It wasn’t that he wasn’t expecting a response, but it was still a bit shocking to see a pen move by itself – or, actually, being moved by his dead friend.
And by that, Sherlock meant that John didn’t usually seem to be hearing voices that nobody else could, or anything similar. Besides, he wouldn’t have dropped his cup in such shock if he was used to this sort of supernatural events. Still, this was the action that confirmed Sherlock’s hypothesis.
Sherlock was bored.
“No, I know that’s what he wanted,” John interrupted. “What I don’t understand is why Sherlock
The giggles eventually died out, and the minutes stretched into hours. The clock struck midnight, then one, then two… John was beginning to wonder whether he
John supposed, in the end, he hadn’t had a choice. The only known way to repel a Lethifold was through the Patronus Charm. No other spell, nor Muggle weapon of any kind, would've had any effect on the beast.
Though Sherlock hated accepting help from his brother, he was thankful he’d sent Lestrade to Baker Street. Not that John was actually doing any better, but at least there was somebody there to keep a good eye on him. Lestrade, unlike Sherlock, could call 999 or give John first aid should there be an emergency. He could talk to him and listen in a more tactful way than Sherlock could have done. John was in good hands.
and gone for good, and what did it matter that they could still talk? It was worthless compared to what they could have,
“I had anticipated that he’d try something like this, I had a plan. I was going to fake my death. But... it all went wrong.” If Sherlock’s voice was breaking, John thought, he was trying truly hard not to let it show. “There was an airbag; you couldn’t see it from where you were standing. I had to hit it when I fell. But I didn’t. I missed it by half a metre, I think.”
"There", he said to Sherlock. "We're good to go." He gestured for Sherlock to follow, and began to climb down the ladder.
So this was, it seemed, the final evidence that caring was not an advantage. What had Sherlock ever gained from it that he had not lost?
, thought Sherlock
Once tea was ready, he began to walk towards his armchair; but a voice made him stop dead in his tracks:
“Oh, like I said, I found it most impressive. I don’t suppose it’s something easy to do,” Mycroft said, honest. Because even though the mere fact of his brother’s afterlife was impossible, here they were. And frankly, he was intrigued by it. How did he do it? Moving things, having John hear him... He was also frustrated, anyway. He needed to understand, and yet he couldn’t.
PLEASE READ NOTES:
he wrote.
He walked towards him, thankful that his invisibility allowed him not to distract John. Smirking, he took the pen.
Sherlock did not understand.
John could still remember it. The very night he had shot the cabbie, Mycroft had called him aside from the crime scene. Looking back, John supposed he should have expected him to figure it out within seconds. But that night, he had taken him by surprise.
He remained silent for the rest of the day.
“Sure.”
Sherlock leaned in to take a closer look at the corpse, but nothing could’ve prepared him for what he saw: a tall, pale dark-haired man in his thirties, dressed in a suit and an expensive coat, with a significant amount of blood coming out of his forehead. Was he... was he staring at his own body?
And as the realisation finally hit him like a ton of bricks, Sherlock fell to the ground.
Sherlock looked down. “I'm sorry", he muttered.
Sherlock smiled.
, more than Sherlock would have liked to admit. Because on one hand, it was a constant reminder of his death, of the fact that he didn’t belong to the world of the living anymore; and on the other hand, he felt
Sherlock sighed. “I was so worried”, he said, voice almost trembling. “I didn’t know what he could do to you, I… I was scared, John.”
It was fairly simple, really: to open the cabinet, he pulled the door using a mop, which he had borrowed from the janitor’s closet. He had taped his mobile to one end of the mop, opening the camera to record. That way, he could use it to peek inside without having to come closer.
John chuckled fondly, taking Sherlock’s hands in his. “I’d love to have you as my partner”, he smiled back.
A few minutes later, Mycroft got up from his seat, taking his umbrella in one hand. “Well,” he said, “I shall be leaving.”
Sherlock tried to ignore the way John flinched. “Yes,” he replied.
“I was looking for clues”, Sherlock explained.
“Don’t worry. I’m okay”, she assured. “It will never be easy to live without Julia. But now that I know what happened to her, at least I’ve found a little peace. It’s not perfect”, she said, “but it’s better than nothing.”
“Wait, what skull?” asked John, standing up. “What are you talking about?”
I'll probably write a short sequel. And who knows? I might write more of this ficverse after that as well. Please let me know if you'd be interested in reading that!
There was one thing that kept roaming round his head, and that was Sherlock. It was always Sherlock, though he’d never let him know.
Sherlock remained silent for a moment – well, he was actually speechless, to be precise. John had heard him, he was almost sure. But that wouldn’t make sense, would it? He’d never shown any sign of being... what was the word, psychic?
“Yes, but not really, are you?” John deadpanned. “There’s so much you’re going to miss out on, and all because you died to save my life. And you know what?” he asked. “Ella was right. There’s so many things I should’ve said before.
“Hm?” John hummed.
– whatever that was.
Suddenly, he was startled by a loud metallic clank coming from the back room. Someone had dropped something - dental tweezers, judging by the sound. Probably they’d stumbled upon them. They must’ve been startled, taken by surprise...
Sherlock hummed in agreement, still lost in thought, as he sat down on his armchair. There must be something he was missing. If John could hear him, that meant he could affect the physical world in some way or another. And if so, then there must be a way for him to touch things, right? He was energy now, and that never disappears, it just transforms. He must be able to canalise that energy. He just knew it.
John couldn’t believe it. What in the name of Merlin had Sherlock been thinking? If the Lethifold had attacked him, he would’ve had no way to defend himself. He could have
“However, Julia was a threat to that control, and she was starting to succeed. You said that she and your mother were settling their differences. Now, Julia was very determined to make her leave Roylott. She wouldn’t have been the one to give in. No, it was your mother who was finally taking Julia’s advice.
"Why did you leave Wizarding Britain, Dr Watson?" Mycroft had asked.
Sherlock smiled at him. “It’s time to go.”
Sherlock pursed his lips. Of course John wouldn’t know. “Can’t. No body, no sleep.”
As always, a huge thank you to Steph and Kittie! I couldn't do this without their help.
"You seem to be as fond of Sherlock as he is of you", Mycroft had responded, "and I think it would be a pity for him to become so lonely again."
. But John should be happy, right? His friend was still here with him, and they could talk and clear things up and have a laugh and forget that this all ever happened, couldn’t they?
Besides, he had the feeling that John needed to talk to him in private. This was his chance to get said privacy.
John huffed. “Alright,” he said, not entirely happy with it but knowing his friend was right. “Just a few, and then we’re leaving.”
go to sleep, when he saw it.
And then he realised: these creatures must all be illegal – or quite hard to get one's hands on, at least. They were trapped in cages in a magically-concealed cabinet, so that they couldn't escape or be found. That could be no coincidence.
He cleared his throat. “John?” he called.
“Scotland Yard. It's urgent”, Sherlock responded.
“Moriarty wanted to ruin Sherlock’s image, John, you knew–”
Sherlock chuckled. “No, I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem like a good enough reason.” He was quiet for a few seconds. “John... you do know I wasn’t a fraud, don’t you?” he’d moved closer, John could tell. Sherlock must be facing him.
. The margin of error in his deductions was abysmal.
“I don’t know”, Helen said. “I suppose so. It was a present from Grimesby; Julia only accepted it so she wouldn’t have to worry about rent while finishing her studies”, she explained.
It was only around five that something caught his attention: a car engine. Not his brother’s, this one was a few years older, manual-driven.
-Murder. (This is a murder story. It's not
“That’s what I should be asking you,” Lestrade responded. “Seriously, John, this is no joke. This much alcohol could kill you! Do you really think that’s okay?”
he wrote.
“Hm?”
“Hello,” said Lestrade, coming in.
He loved John. He couldn't let him go.
