debacle.
Her green eyes met his. Slightly bashful she ran a hand through her short, black hair. "Yeah. I Marty McFly'd myself. Didn't mean to go back this far though. But maybe..."
"This isn't the first time you messed up though is it?" Gabriel asked already knowing the answer. The cherub shook his head. Leave it to the Winchester's to mess something up without knowing they had. "Don't worry kid. We can fix this."
. After the Righteous Man broke the first seal, we all know what would happen. What should have happened. There was an order that was supposed to follow. An order that had been set in motion since before the dawn of man.” Zachariah clapped the back of Castiel’s neck tightly, using his grace to inflict pain on the Seraph. Castiel’s face remained impassive, despite the pain he felt. Zachariah continued, “But now
is messing with that plan. Lilith has been killed, and not by Sam Winchester. The final seal is lost to us. Did you know that Castiel? All those millennia passed, all of us expecting her to die at the rise of our brother. And yet?”
“Oh,” was all Coop responded. Then a thoughtful look came over him. “But what about Sam?”
“Oh we both know that’s a lie,
The view wasn’t so bad either. He barked out in appreciation.
The door swung open, revealing a short man –average by non-Winchester standards- with golden, whiskey eyes. On the surface he looked like a plain man having just got home from work as a custodian. That wasn’t what Bertie saw however.
“They did.”
"You're grounded too!" The elder Winchester pouted.
It's been forever, I know I know.  Writer's block plus depression sucks. But here ya go... Have some angst.
Sam placed a hand on his niece’s shoulder. “Bertie. What aren’t you telling us?”
“Archangel, yeah.”
Bertie’s gaze never left her dad. A chill ran through her at the voice. It had been Adam, but not.
Dean narrowed his green eyes. “To be fair, we don’t have to trust you. You appeared out of nowhere, claimed to be mine and Cas’ kid from some future that’s falling apart at the seams.”
"I had to hunt down a few things. Dug a grave, found a person. Tried to figure out my next step. How about you? Have you had enough time to freak out or are you done? I can't save the universe without you, you know." Admitting that she still needed her Dad to help her was a big deal. Winchester's certainly weren't known for their emotional openness. Even Grandma Mary hadn't been.
“Gramps…We need your help,” she begged, ignoring both questions. Behind her Gabriel and Sam gasped. “Everything you created will end. Everything. The universe will collapse on itself and the only thing that will be left… Will be you. You will be alone. Completely alone.”
"Sonofabitch!" Dean ran a hand over his face. "Oh, she is so grounded when she gets back."
“One thing is for sure; Michael is an asshole. And he is wearing your brother.” The brothers paused at that. Taking a deep breath, Bertie knew what she would have to do. She couldn’t let her family get hurt anymore. “That is going to make things even more difficult.”
"You just did it because your 'daughter' told you too! How do you even know she is who she claims? Huh? She could just be another big bad demon herself." Sam argued, giving voice to the thought that they had all had at some point during the past day.
Dean also opens his door and makes himself comfortable in the driver’s seat. Knowing him, it’s probably the most comforting place to sit anyway. I am aware he is looking at me, but my head remains tilted down towards my lap. I don’t really feel like conversation right now; it must be another human-felt disadvantage to social interaction.
“I know.” Cas gives a warm smile and steps forwards to give Dean a hug. He feels happy inside when his arms wrap around Cas’ body. Cas is warm and, again, Dean just doesn’t want to let go.
“That’s disgusting Gabe, at least have
They both slowly make their way across the stony beach and try not to step on any loose rocks. Dean nearly tumbles over when his walking causes a mini pebble avalanche beneath his feet, but Cas grips his hand tight and yanks him just in time to stop him toppling over.
Gabe rolls his eyes and shoves his sister back.
Dean manages to catch Michael’s eye. “We’re gonna go now but we might be back for the sleepover.”
That just leaves me, Cas and a sleeping Sam.
“I wish that I could fly too.” Cas said simply. “It’d be so…freeing.”
(If I can't, I'll bombard you with chapters when I get back).
“Travelling while being human is so…obnoxious. And slow.” He thinks out loud.
Cas takes in a breath, snuggling deeper into bed. It’s nice and warm and he’s cozy.
her. He still hates that woman with
there before. Jesus.
Dean is so sidetracked by his thoughts that he doesn’t realise Jarah has returned.
“As long as he’s safe.” The man nods to him and Gabe gives a weak smile.
Cas shakes his head. “There’s nothing to apologize for. It’s okay to get scared. I’m just saying that in the future, even though it’s hard, really try and think about the situation you’re in. Think about what’s best for you to do if it means you don’t feel you need to run away.”
His head rolls forwards and he’s out like a light. Just like that. I shrug and notice that Sam found a bag and has sealed the shirt away. “Sammy, can you help me get ‘m up?”
Cas comes back to the present with a frown. “I thought that was next week?”
Dean’s lips lingered against his own and suddenly he felt his boyfriend’s hand on his aching dick, squeezing gently as the movement of his hips slowed.
This is it. We’re actually gonna do this.
. He’d been thrown out of his own house and was now inside Dean’s.
Feeling hot and cold will never be a pleasant sensation, neither will a foggy head. He feels overly tired too, but he’ll just do what he does every day and get on with it. Hopefully some fresh air will help.
“Your father would be so proud of you.” I assure, and she looks at me sadly.
Eventually though, Cas loses balance too and we both go crashing down to the floor, Cas still laughing his ass off for some reason. Is he still giggling because of being ticklish, or at the sight of me flipping around trying to stay standing?
“Is he going to c-come home?”
“…flying ones?”
necessarily; but heartfelt. They were entering a delicate conversation, he could feel it. He liked the feeling.
“Well, you always seem fully-energized when you eat one so I thought that maybe it would help to restore my own strength.”
“Ugh, fine, let’s just get this over with. What do you need that you’re so desperate for anyway?”
“Mmm.” Dean hummed against his mouth, pulling away ever so slightly. He stared at Cas’ face, gently grasping his chin with his free hand so Cas would make eye contact. “Up for it?” He rasped.
Their voices have lowered considerably since they started talking about sex. Cas just hopes that people can’t hear them talking.
Jimmy squirms a little and goes still, making Dean wonder whether he needs to be changed. He gently pushes two fingers under Jimmy’s waistband to feel the pull up and finds it pretty wet.
I scrunch my eyes up when the examination starts and the doctor looks at my penis first. I take hold of Dean’s hand again to remind myself that I’m
I finally stop and settle for just admiring the sight before me. Cas is breathing heavily underneath me and a smirk is still plastered on his face. As his face is turned away from me, I can see that small tears have collected at the corners of his eyes from all of the laughter. Can I kiss him now?
He finds the jeans a moment later and grabs a black t-shirt, some boxers and a red plaid shirt to put on in the bathroom.
My brother nods and the door closes.
“What do you mean?”
Cas stays silent and still. There is no evidence of the grace working inside him. It’s too late.
“Seriously?” Cas actually laughs a little at that. “That thing is basically solid wood.”
“Nothing, I’m just-fuck-you look so hot right now.” The angel blushes and looks down at my hard-on.
Dean pulls them over Cas’ feet so he doesn’t have to bend down and soon Cas is comfortable in a sweatshirt and his sweatpants.
situation hits him quite hard. He
“Nice to meet you Jody.” She smiles and the two of them hug before starting a conversation.
He’ll have to ask Cas when he gets back to his own world; see if Cas will talk about it.
“Alright. Okay.” I soothe to make him stop shaking. He’s obviously got himself kind of worked up about this. It’s obvious, so I’m glad we were able to resolve it before it got too out of hand.
“Um, well, I uh…y-yeah-“
They all watch the boy pick up a cat plushie. Dean smiles. He hopes Jimmy never has to go through being so upset again. Ever. Dean will always do his best to make sure.
The four of them manage to get inside the house with no other problems.
“That’s okay, you drank most of it.” She shrugs, passing the glass to Gabe. Cas closes his eyes when another bout of shivers rattle through him. Anna watches him, but it doesn’t seem like he’s falling asleep so she doesn’t say anything about it. “Dean, I spoke to his doctor and he said Cas should be okay, but if he passes out again, we should consider taking him to the hospital. But that won’t happen because we’re gonna handle it.”
Dean says nothing and cries into my shoulder. “I love you.” He forces out and with that, I close my eyes, and let myself slip away from him. From everything.
“Alright. Alright.” I try and comfort as I think of something to do.
“I was a dork in Elementary school basically.” She laughs.
“I cwan do thcat.” His words are changed by the pacifier again. It’s actually really cute.
“Remember Cas, whatever you decide I support you, all right? We can afford it if you just want to focus on getting better without having to worry about work. If you’re in there and you decide you want to quit, don’t think about money. We’d be more than fine, even if Gabe
Once we have both finished our coffee, I move my legs and sit with them crossed before dragging Cas into my lap so he can sit more comfortably in the gap in the middle. He doesn’t say anything or act surprised, he just leans back against me and rests his head on my shoulder.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He just continues jerking Dean in increasingly fast strokes, touching his slit every so often.
It’s pretty snug, but it’s very comfortable. As soon as Dean is laid down, Cas snuggles up into his chest and tangles their legs together. Dean feels Cas bunch up the front of his sweater and press his face into the material. Dean’s hand finds its way into Cas’ hair and he presses in close, able to kiss the top of Cas’ head.
Cas shakes in my arms as he lets out a heart-wrenching cry out.
. Humiliated and ashamed, I cleaned up my mess and ran. I never went back. That’s how I started working cases. I had nightmares every night where I was lost and alone, and
. I carried Cas to bed.” Dean runs both hands through his hair. “It’s like he’s hit a brick wall. Everything’s caught up with him – he’s exhausted.”
“So Cas, what she said about you that day doesn’t affect you now?”
“Yeah, course you can!” Cas smiles. “You can take Husky and your favourite blanket and sleep next to your friends. You’ll have a lot of fun, I promise.”
“Just your pants, Cas, then you can have ‘em back. We need to just give you this shot and replace your bandages.”
Now we are all sitting around in the living room, watching some crappy film. Everyone has reached the point of saturation when it comes to conversation. We’re all just lazing around, watching mindlessly.
At this, Dean slows down until he comes to a stop, slowly slipping out of Cas.
Upon the sight of Cas all messy and sex-shaken, I too feel a tight knot in my gut untying and with a sharp gasp I shoot my load inside Cas into the condom, whispering his name over and over again as I enjoy my equally as powerful orgasm.
“You alright?” He asks, his voice thick with sleep.
Jimmy gives a big smile and holds his arms up so Cas’ mom can take him. “How are you three? Doing good, I hope?” She beams, fussing over Jimmy.
“I love you.” He murmurs lovingly over Cas’ shoulder. Dean grits his teeth, trying to compose himself. He’s planned this for a long time. A
“Yeah, but I’m still pissed off at you.”
He’ll tell Dean every speck of detail about it all later, but for now, he’ll do as Naomi said.
“Okay, okay.” Dean nods in understanding. “You’re okay.” His voice is soft and comforting.
?” Dean asks and there’s a shimmer of hope swimming in Cas’ eyes.
His heart sank when he saw that he had thirty two missed called from Naomi, and the texts were still coming through.
“Sorry.” He smiled.
“Come on, tell me what’s wrong Cas.” I mutter, carding my fingers through his hair.
, and I’ll do
to save people.
time…is he…are you there for him too?”
him to be good at this. Dammit Sam. I half expect his hair to start flipping around as he goes, frolicking in his dress.
“Then take it out of him!” Dean says desperately through an angry tone. These angels need to get their facts straight.
“Nice. Do you always cook breakfast after a night of sex with a random person?”
Cas is already asleep, his back turned to me, so I climb into bed slowly as to not wake him up. I close my eyes and drift off into a peaceful sleep, Cas’ untold feelings still bothering me.
“Love too!” The little boy throws his arms up.
“I don’t know, I just feel kinda guilty. I was convinced she was going to try and take Jimmy from us or something. She’s just as nice as she used to be and I feel like a dick for assuming that she’d try to do that.” Cas huffs while he places some pull ups for Jimmy into the shopping cart.
“I’m sorry for not doing more.”
Cas only stands under the water for a second or two before wrapping both arms around Dean’ waist tightly. He buries his face into Dean’s shoulder. He doesn’t say a word but Dean doesn’t need him to.
Dean laughs quietly. “I guess that’s kinda my fault for proposing to you.”
“I think I’ll be okay. We don’t have too long left.” Cas swats his hand away and unscrews the cap on the bottle.
A lot of your cases involve thunderstorms. It makes sense.”
said I guess.”
“I think so, yeah. If I think of something, I’ll text you.” Dean decides, standing up again.
Dean sees Gabe notice Cas’ strange behaviour too, and Dean is about to speak up so Gabe doesn’t figure out something’s not right, but Michael beats him to it.
“Castiel, apart from Sam, you’re my best friend. I hate seeing you like this. And before you say anything, I can tell you’re sad. I’ve known you for like four years now. What’s up buddy?”
“Please, Jimmy. Close the door. We
Dean shakes his head as he says “Cas, we’re just glad you’re okay. None of this was your fault. I’m just so happy that you’re alright.”
“What the
“Because no one knows you like I do. I can see difference in your personality.”
Nice.
Cas pulls away from his brother slowly, wiping the last of his tears with his sleeve. “I felt like that too but…it’s been easier to move away and pretend it’s not real rather than face it. I- I only told Dean a couple of days ago.”
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
“M-my pants.” Cas said, trying to reach down to take them off.
Long after Jimmy had left the vessel, after Lucifer had exploded Castiel, after Castiel had been remade, Castiel found himself unintentionally using that quote.
Sam froze beside the shorter angel. He wanted to reach out a comforting hand to Gabriel but wasn’t sure it would be welcome. Probably not the best time for it either, he thought. He did his best to remain as still as possible. Being a mere human in a room with two Archangels and
had missed the memo that the universe had sent out about ‘Destiel’. “Oh, puh-
Sam screamed.
“Oh I know who you are Gabriel. And I gotta say, little disappointed by some of the things you’ve done.” Chuck stood up. In a blink he changed into jeans, a red button down shirt and green army jacket, similar to his son’s own attire. “But like I said… I don’t know who
But Jimmy had. Castiel could hear Jimmy quote along with Dean, could sense his love and amusement at what Dean had said. It had piqued Castiel’s curiosity.
"Crap. Son of a biscuit!" The woman groaned out as she fell out of the closet of the dingy motel room. That hadn't gone as well as planned. Before she could adjust herself to her new surroundings the click of a gun's safety echoed in the room a mere second before the cold metal was pressed to her forehead. She looked up at the two men standing over her. "Balls."
And another…
on the laptop.
<3<3<3
<3<3<3
Literally.
Dean met his gaze. Might as well go for broke. Damn angel saw into his soul most days anyways. “I’m not against it Cas. But I can understand why you wouldn’t want this with me. I’m more trouble than it’s probably worth.”
The impala rolled to a stop. Dean was going to be super pissed that they had left with it, but they wanted to be certain that he remained at the bunker. Bertie had made sure that when she knocked him out he would be asleep for at least ten hours, leaving plenty of time for them to drive off in their search. And since the angels didn’t need to sleep, they would be driving straight through.
"Because she needed to be taken off the board. She was nothing but trouble Sam and you know it!" He had no regret about killing the she-demon behind his brother's back. He would do it again in a heartbeat if asked.
Chuck eyed his son, not denying the accusation. But what Bertie had shown him wasn’t how he wanted this story to end. And clearly his future self didn’t want it to end either. He had seen his own choice of sending her back this far, unknown to her. He had seen that he wanted to change what had been happening but had been too late and powerless to stop it. He had seen his own Death.
before Bertie swung another door open. It led to the metal staircase she had spent the better part of her childhood running up. At the balcony, the brothers stood gaping at the rooms below them. It wasn’t anything that they had been expecting. Sam immediately noticed the library, his face lighting up.
“Hey! No! Where are you going?!!” Sam shouted as the dog shot off down the hallway. He really needed to come up with a name for the pup. He cursed himself that he hadn’t grabbed clothes to change into before his shower. Now look at him, running down the bunker, practically naked, chasing a dog that he hadn’t told his brother about yet. Yeah, Dean was going to kill him.
Not that he was going to tell anyone that.
“You gotta come back from this fight, Cas. Ya hear me?”
The man practically radiated power, red from his pagan god side and pure gold from his archangel side. It was blinding to say the least. Even she had to blink at the brightness his wings held. Then a thought crossed her mind. She panicked. Originally she had meant to come here and appeal to his Trickster side, fool the god of mischief into helping end the war his brothers wanted to start. That wasn’t going to work, because if she could see
For the week following Valentine’s Day, or as Dean liked to call it -Drifter Christmas-, Sam had to watch the unexpected yet painful attempts at flirting Castiel was using on Dean. It had started small, with the former angel standing a bit too close to Dean. Which, to be fair, was pretty standard for them. Then he offered to help Dean with the cooking. Castiel claimed that he wanted to be self-sufficient, which was a major step forward and an idea the Winchester’s supported wholly. It was great idea, really… In theory. But in the execution it resulted in breaking out the fire extinguisher for the first time since moving into the bunker.
“And I didn’t heal him. You did that Gabriel,” Bertie nonchalantly let the zoo out of the bag.
That was the question wasn’t it? What about that flannel covered, mountain of a man? The man destined to help change Destiny? The man who had, frankly, captured Gabriel’s attention at their first meeting. He had known then that Sam was his big brother’s Vessel, destined to end the world as he knew it. He knew that he had lost any chance he had with Sam during that whole
His girlfriend slapped his chest. "Clearly he is hiding something that he doesn't want anyone to know."
Fully clothed.
“You’ve been spending a large amount of time lately with the Winchesters, brother.” It wasn’t a question. Uriel allowed his disgust to show on his meat-suit. The angel couldn’t understand Castiel’s fascination with the mud monkeys. Despite their Father’s love of them, he couldn’t understand why any
“I really thought he would help after everything I showed him.” Bertie sighed, defeated. If Gramps didn’t bring her Father back soon, time would settle, and she would disappear. She looked up to her uncle. Hopefully, she had already done enough to change the Winchester history for the better. “Come on. Dad will still want to kick our asses for taking the Impala. Might as well get it over with.”
From his vantage point at the kitchen window, Gabriel whistled low. Curious as to what had caught the archangel’s attention, Sam wandered closer. Then he scrunched his face in disgust.
Smitey Gabe, simpering Naomi, violent Dean...
"Look, I promise to tell you everything but I need you to tell me something first," Bertie started.
“What happened, Gabriel?” She barely got the words out.
Dean gazed at Cas, at the eyes that were exactly as Buttercup was saying on screen. Dean’s heart stopped then jumped to beat triple time. He couldn’t hold back any longer. He was so stupid as to hide years of feelings from this perfect man beside him. If Zeke hadn’t been there that night, Dean would never have the chance to tell Cas the truth.
"Sam's been sucking down demon blood in order to be strong enough to stop Lilith." Bertie answered. She sunk back against the wall when he shot her a look she was well acquainted with, though it wasn't one she had been given for several years.
She sighed, taking a deep breath. Rubbing the back of her neck, nervously, she said. “Father should be here for this.”
wings…
"Because she is my daughter as well, Dean."
"What the hell did you do to him?" Lifting his gigantic brother into his lap, he checked for any signs of injury. The woman may claim she's his daughter, but he didn't know her, didn't trust her. And what the hell was with that power?
“Wait. I have
“C’mon Dean. You know it’s the right coordinates. This is where she said to meet up. Might as well knock.” Sam cajoled from the passenger side, before reaching for the side handle.
Dean felt a rush of pride when he saw the graphic shirt she wore stating ‘
“As you wish.”
He was afraid to admit to himself that he came back for ‘
Bertie rolled her eyes. “You’re right, Dad. I could have but then we would still be dealing with the first ghost hunt we did ‘cus you two would have still been digging up the graves.”
Sam raced into the room in time to watch his brother catch the angel. He rolled his eyes as the pair stared into each other’s eyes, despite being less than an inch away. Moving past them, he lifted the corgi into his arms. “You, bud, are definitely a troublemaker. Think I finally figured out what to call you.”
To everyone who knew him, they would disbelieve that he would have ever brought himself to watch
“I take it that means you’re in?”
Sam stormed off, pissed at his brother and …
He and his mother both glanced at the bodies on the floor. Bodies that looked exactly like themselves.
With Sam next to her, covered in blood.
The Cupid startled. The voice had come from nowhere. It was impossible to come up on an angel unawares, even when they were having a panic attack. Even other angels couldn't manage it. Only two things in all existence would be able to: God and Archangels. God had yet to return. As for the archangels... Well that was impossible since they were all either dead or in the Pit.
“Why do you fight this, Sam? It’s your destiny.” Lilith stepped forward, demon blade in her hand. Bitch must have taken it from him when he had been captured. He was able to take out a couple of the bastards before she had though.
"I'm showing him what is to come. I'm showing him what he will have to live with for eternity if he doesn't allow me to change this," she answered calmly. "I'm showing him... your death."
Sam hated to admit that it took him so long to notice what was going on with his brother and their resident former angel. Not that he had been oblivious to the eye fucking that had been between the two of them for years. To be fair he had been more focused on organizing the bunkers files this week instead of helping Castiel adjust to being human now that he started showering again. Sam may have taken the opportunity to throw his bedding into the wash during that first one. The smell had begun to permeate out into the hallway. He shook his head. Who would have thought that the former angel could be such a binger?
“It looks like your plan is working.”
TW: Temporary character death. I repeat TEMPORARY!!! Tags have been updated for this as well.
“A Nephilim?” Gabriel asked.
Blue in the face, Sam had to choke back his laughter. Dean’s face was bright red, eyes wide in stunned silence. What had gotten into the angel? Where had he even heard those lines?
<3<3<3
“Dean-”
He waved his hand in her direction. Bertie could feel the power wash over her. He was trying to send her away. She smirked. “Yeah. That’s not going to work on me.”
thing isn’t it?” the writer whined. “Wait… How do you know that name? I never put it in the books.”
Twice.
"Dad? Come on Dad, wake up." She smacked his face. Slowly he came to as she helped him to sit up. "It isn't the end of the world, you know. Okay maybe technically it is. But having an awesome daughter like me isn't. So get a grip would ya."
“It’s our home.” Her response was simple and heartbreaking. Dean’s gaze caught hers. She blinked and cleared her throat. “We’re legacies. Great grandpa Henry was a Man of Letters. This was one of their main bunkers. In a few years, you guys will meet him. That part hasn’t changed. He was the one to lead you both here the first time around.”
To Dean they were so much more.
"Fuck!" she shouted, then cringed. Bertie shot them a look as though expecting to be yelled at for the profanity. It wasn't any worse than what the hunters said; she did learn most of them from her Dad. Rubbing the back of her neck, she muttered under her breath. "At least it's after Hell."
There was so much she wanted for them to know, so much she wished she could share with her family, to be there with them, but deep in her grace she knew what needed to happen.
The effort for both projects, the filing and human-Cas, was immense. Though it would go a hell of a lot easier if a certain jerk of a brother would help out, Sam thought bitterly.
The younger hunter decided to escape before he broke a rib listening to these two idiots.
“Dean?” Sam opened the door to his brother’s room a few minutes later, expecting him to be either drinking or sleeping. He was surprised when he saw Dean rushing around the room in a panic, packing one of his duffel bags. Clothes were tossed in, weapons carefully stored in the canvas bag. “Hey man. What’s going on?”
Bertie did something unexpected, grabbing the deity’s hand and bringing it to her head. Chuck’s eyes widened as he saw her future, the universe she came from, the destruction His firstborns had wrought to His creation. He saw her creation as well, knew why He had brought her into being. Releasing her finally he glanced at the two standing at her side.
“Shut up kid.”
Castiel had been standing guard, leaning against the floral covered walls. He frowned as they arrived. He had spent the last day looking in the Heavenly archives, trying to find precedence for Bertie. There was none. She had already changed the course of what Michael and Lucifer had begun. "Where have you been?"
“That’s what they tell me. And by they I mean Dad and the dumbasses that are my older brothers.” Gabriel gave an unnecessary bow. He snapped his fingers and a daiquiri appeared in his hand. Taking an enormous slurp, he kept his eyes on the taller Winchester. “Now before we get into what I’m doing here, I got some questions that need answering. And if I’m guessing correctly, you bozos want these answers too.”
There had been one hitch, unless she went further back in time to get the key from her great-grandfather Henry –which was a hell no- she would have to find another key in this time frame. That meant she had to deal with the British Men of Letters asshats.
"So who are you, kid? Normal people don't just appear out of closets," Dean pointed out.
“You know I don’t step in.” Chuck swallowed. He had also seen who had been at his side toward the end. How could he have let the Darkness creep in?
The shorter man nodded.
Sam’s bitch face activated. “I am. I just don’t want to see it if one of the men is my brother. That’s just gross.”
"Oh, yeah. Getting her removed from the board is going to be a good thing in the long run. After that though we have to figure out a way to banish Lilith back to hell permanently." Reaching across the table she grabbed half of the sandwich off her Dad's plate. He always made good ones.
"And how exactly do you know that, Cas?"
“Well, well, well…” Gabriel scratched at his chin. “I may not recognize those wings but I sure as heck know Dad’s handy work. Who are you?”
"No problem, hon." The woman laughed.
"What is it?" Dean stood up. Turning on Bertie, he yelled. "What are you doing to him?"
Deep condensation escaped his lips while Sam ran. The rain from earlier in the day had soaked the ground and trees, leaving a scent of ozone lingering in the air. The rhythmic
“As you wish, Dean.”
Then came the moment when the world stopped spinning.
“I can’t believe you’re keeping that mutt Sam. What are you going to do with him when we have to go out on a case? You know we can’t take him with us.” Dean shook his head. He slapped the top piece of bread down for the final sandwich. He had been in the middle of preparing lunch for everyone when the argument started. Well, when
Bertie nodded.
And he never would tell Sam.
“You know John?” the woman, Kate, asked, eyes widening.
“This is some sort of
Also NOTE: Dean knows that Sam is working with Ruby, but he doesn't know about the demon blood.
“Oh yeah? Dad dump you on someone, huh? Sounds like the old man. Come on in. You want a drink?” He left the door open and waved her inside. “So, if you don’t mind my asking, how is it I never noticed your presence before now?”
Snapping her fingers, a black leather journal appeared. Holding it between her hands, her eyes glowed bright as she filled it with all the knowledge she had, knowledge her parents had taught her from mistakes they had once made. The Mark of Cain, the British Men of Letters, the Darkness were but a few things she covered. Even Zanna. A few had disclaimers on them, including how to close the gates of hell, but only if the person was willing to die for the cause. There were even notes on who to trust. Rowena to some extent, don’t trust Crowley at anything he says or does without thoroughly double checking all the facts first, including what the repercussions would be. How they should seriously consider taking out Metatron and try giving Gadreel a second chance to prove himself.
Gabriel stood over the corpses of his brothers. While Uriel and Zachariah had fallen across the room from one another, the burnt shape of their wings overlapped. Gabriel’s raging blue eyes landed on the weeping angel in the corner, trying to make herself appear smaller behind the desk. The fury the Archangel felt was barely contained. He had immediately ended the other two once he realized what had happened to his younger brother. To find Uriel removing his hands from the lifeless vessel while Zachariah pulled his angel blade free from Castiel’s chest… It was all Gabriel had been able to do not to destroy all of Heaven itself.
The was an awkward moment where neither was willing to talk first. Suddenly as though poke with a cattle prod, Gabriel yelped.
*****
Then it continued, followed by the staring. The unearthly blue eyes never blinking, seeming to pierce his soul, which was annoying considering Cas got a close-up of his soul in hell. Dean couldn’t stop his heart from racing during those moments where Cas stood just a little too close.
Two days earlier…
He covered his eyes a moment, willing the visions away. He looked like he was about to cry when he dropped his hand and they were still standing there. “What do you want?” he cried out.
"Balls!"
“We were hoping you might be able to help us…” Sam began.
“Angels don’t have balls Dean,” he squinted.
At everyone's looks of confusion, Bertie sighed in resignation. "Mary. Mary taught me that move."
Automatically, the Cupid marked the younger hunter. Sam. Sam Winchester. At least he got that one correct. But it also meant that the arrow meant for Dean had been used on a former angel of the Lord.
‘Hey Cas.’
Then Castiel had done the unthinkable.
At least until he could come up with an idea to deal with Dean that is.
“Yes Sam. I’ve tried praying, I’ve tried calling. I’ve left voice mails and texts. He’s not answering.” Dean was growing more agitated the longer the conversation left him with no answers.
Or if they just didn’t want to do it.
(runs and hides)
“One of the perks of free will, the ability to change Fate. And there are too many possible futures for even Me to keep track of. So who are you?” Chuck asked again.
A large metal door opened on the side of the building. Its hinges creaked and groaned, grating from disuse. Bertie stepped out, smiling when she saw the hunters. They had said they would come, but she knew how they could be when they weren’t sure of something.
“Maybe at one time you were meant to do that. But I have a feeling that this movie has a new director. Maybe even a new cast, whole new direction if you get my meaning.” The Trickster laughed coldly. “Now say goodnight, Gracie.”
“Thought you knew everything?” Sam whispered nervously.
<3<3<3
"She's as old as you are Dean. I don't think that that is going to go over too well," Sam pointed out.
Bertie smirked, then let out some Winchester sarcasm. “I did do my chores Dad. Dusted and everything.”
“I’m not saying that either, Dean. He was a soldier for only Chuck knows how long. I know he knows how to fight. But now he could be seriously hurt or even killed. Just like we could.”
Jumping down from the hood of the Impala, Dean started gathering up his empty bottles. He avoided Castiel’s penetrating gaze. He didn’t have to see it to know that he was doing that stupid head tilt of his when trying to understand something inanely human.
“Of course. Why do you ask?”
Her dad had the grace to look sheepish. “Oh, yeah. Kinda forgot about that little pipsqueak.”
The crack of a bottle opening sounded behind him. A second later a bottle was thrust in his face as Bobby Singer handed the drink to him. Taking it in confusion, he gingerly held it. He didn't understand the human need for alcohol at all hours of the day. Though the trait did seem prevalent to the Winchesters.
Bertie tilted her head, squinting at the man.
The question threw the hunters. It wasn't what they had been expecting. Dean recovered faster than his mentor, it wasn't the first time he had encountered something like this after all. He just wasn't sure why it was happening so close to him coming back from his own trip to the past. Was this something that he would have to deal with on a regular basis now that he was back from Hell?
A duty that I take seriously.” In spite of all the unforeseen events in dealing with a future child, his new emotions regarding Dean, and a rogue archangel making himself a nuisance…yes. Yes, Castiel did take his charge of watching over the Winchesters seriously.
“Bertie.” Before she could say anything else, Gabriel barked with laughter.
It was the other one, with the giant Loreal locks that he had no clue how to help.
Yeah. This Cupid's work was cut out for him.
"Exactly. Just some father-daughter bonding time," Dean agreed. "Man, you should have seen it. Who trained you how to do that move you used on that one demon, spitfire?"
*****
Chuck snapped his eyes up, clearing, sobering. “I don’t know who you are but I’m not your ‘gramps’.”
At age five, Bertie had been annoyingly curious. Constantly asking her Papa’s everything she could to understand her small universe. Of course being created by God as a ready-made archangel, she already knew that the universe was far bigger than she should have been able to comprehend. But she loved hearing how the hunters would explain things to her child-like veneer.
Dean’s bed.
. He swallowed it down as he walked over. Scoffing, he crossed his arms nonchalantly. “So
“He said yes, didn’t he?” Castiel said in a small voice. His daughter nodded to him sadly. She had shown him how it ended. It didn’t make it hurt any less though.
"Not quite. But good to know that I still got it." The Messenger appeared in front of the young cupid. Young enough that Gabriel was certain that he hadn't been created yet when he left Heaven. "What's your name kid?"
"Drink up. You're gonna need it. Little missy here came back to save the whole dang universe." Bobby finished off his own as he frowned at the room at large.
. Fucking Lilith.
“Man, I’m exhausted. And starving. And sore as hell,” Dean rubbed at his shoulder. That last ghost had been one mean sonofabitch. It had thrown the brothers into the wall repeatedly while Bertie had been hunting down it’s remains. “Why were we the ones who had to play distraction each time? You could’ve taken a turn. Gender equality and all that.”
“Yeah, yeah. So tell me something. How is it you found this place, huh? I mean this is pretty out in the middle of nowhere. Didn’t you say this was abandoned?” Dean finally asked after a few minutes. Sam was already delving into some of the lore books on the shelves of the library. No way was this place going to be a good thing. Dean couldn’t allow himself to believe it. Good things didn’t just happen for them without there being a catch.
Gabriel met his eyes, then Sam’s. He could tell that the younger Winchester knew when he nodded to the angel to continue. Already tears were forming in the taller man’s eyes. Even though his vessel didn’t require oxygen, Gabriel took in a deep breath. “His vessel is somewhere safe.”
"We should test her, Dean." The older man passed a silver flask over to her. "You don't wanna be shot, you drink."
Bertie threw her hands up in the air. “He didn’t… Ugh! He went to the future and sacrificed himself for you! But maybe this time around we can stop that from happening too.”
Each interaction was generally followed by a long, drawn out gaze-fest between the angel and the hunter. Eventually, it wasn’t just Dean asking for help with hunts, but for things far more personal.
Even though Gabriel couldn’t really show it in this form, he grinned. He had the younger Winchester chasing him, towel slipping dangerously low. Ahead of him were the other two idiots. Going for broke he ran straight at them, knocking purposefully into his own brother. The sudden impact sent Castiel reeling into Dean’s arms. He didn’t have time to enjoy the aftermath as he bounced off Castiel’s legs and skidded into the wall. He whimpered as the impact knocked the wind from him.
Sam didn't know what he had walked into. He had come back to the hotel after practicing with Ruby, attempting to sneak in so Dean hopefully wouldn't notice that he had been gone. Unfortunately the lights in the room had been on when he arrived. He felt stronger than he had when he had left as Ruby had thankfully given him a fill up on her blood. He felt stronger and more powerful than he had ever in fact. He had been able to exorcise the demon without killing the host. It was a win.
.” He sighs, palming between his own legs. “Just seeing it…”
Dean finds the key and unlocks the door so Cas can go in and investigate. Dean goes back for Jimmy and unstraps the sleeping boy from his car seat.
Alfie starts to snicker. “Dean,
“No, it’s okay, I understand.” Cas nodded.
I swing my fist at her and it’s like hitting steel causing the skin on my knuckles to split. She spins back around to me. “I was going to wait to kill you, but turns out you’re practically asking for it.”
“Yeah.” Dean nods in agreement with a small chuckle. “I’ve never heard that much about his dad, though.”
Cas makes eye contact with a nurse on her way past, and she smiles at him, looking a little confused because he’s literally just standing there. Cas doesn’t want her to comment, but to his disappointment she stops and tries to make conversation.
The angel’s hands also roam around my chest, and for some reason, the atmosphere this time feels different. It’s loving and not rushed. We’re taking it slow and it makes me think
“I know I keep fidgeting.” Cas admits. “I’m trying not to think about the food.”
The cloth cleaned him everywhere before he felt a warm hand on his cheek. “Cas?”
Cas smiles back, relaxing a little now Dean has reassured him. He runs his hand over the kitten again and pets it between the ears. It carries on purring.
“…what?” Cas mumbles sleepily, shifting just a little under the covers, but he feels it. Is it real?
“Why?!”
“Dean, I know I’m going through shit, but please promise me that you know I’m here for you too. I don’t want you to have things you feel like you can’t tell me. I’ll
“Have you come down with something else? You seem a bit under.” Dean frowns.
I yawn and pull Cas even closer, happy that he told me everything, before falling into a deep sleep ready for a long day tomorrow.
My foot collides with the wall as I grumble to myself angrily, wanting someone to smash a thousand glass bottles on my head for being such a heartless bastard.
“What you eating grass for, kid? Ask daddy for cake or some potato chips instead. They taste much nicer.” Alfie laughs. Jimmy nods, probably storing the information for future reference.
that show and Bailey the wizard is his all-time favorite character.
“Go back to sleep. I’m gonna be right here, Cas. Always.”
something off about his fever. It’s not a common one, that’s for sure.
“Okay. In a min.” Dean leans forward for a few short kisses before leaving. Cas follows and diverts off to the bathroom to change Jimmy before getting to their bedroom.
Before long, I am practically storming down a street, shotgun in hand. It may not do much to an angel, but it will slow her down. I think I feel something that Dean usually calls ‘badass’, and I like it.
“Alright. I just wanted to make sure.” He smiles. “But just know that if you don’t want to do something, you can tell him, right? He’s not gonna be mad or anything. He just wants you to be comfortable and get better. So if and when you think about taking your relationship to the next level, he’ll completely understand if you want to wait.”
“Dean, why didn’t you wake me?” The angel asks, and I grip his hand that is still under the table.
Castiel’s dick is a little thicker than his own but not quite as long. It’s enough to admire because, even in Dean’s mouth, it feels goddamn huge. He hums around it at the thought and feels another bit of precome dribble from the tip when Cas moans again, the added vibration from Dean’s mouth coaxing out another little noise.
Cas has
“Okie dokie.” Gabe says.
Cas’ lips pull into a smile. “I usually wear it after having a shower. It must smell like my aftershave or something.”
clicks and he just gets up and puts on a brave face.” Gabriel shrugs. “And since I’m giving him all of these compliments, I better go the other way and warn you about Cas and Mexican food. Stay far away, the gas is suffocating.”
Cas nods, taking the information in. He gets the vibe that his brother already feels awful for so much as letting the boys out of his sight for thirty seconds; he doesn’t need any confirmation from Cas.
worry about that.” Gabe shrugs, dropping some deodorant for both of them into the cart.
Jimmy stomps back inside and runs away out of the living room. Cas hears a door slam shut.
“Bit greasy for me, Dean.” Sam admits, but smiles after he says it showing he’s joking.
Cas smiles back. “I
“What’s wrong? Is everything okay?” Dean suddenly questions, looking down at Nicky and stroking his hair to check their son is okay. He places his other hand on Cas’ shoulder.
His boyfriend pressed against his hole again. Cas flinched slightly when the bluntness split him open.
Cas looks confused at first and then joins in my laughter even though he doesn’t know what I’m laughing about, “what?” He chuckles.
“Yes. My son won’t stop talking about him. Um, why do you want to know?”
“Yeah, I’ll be fine. It’s not like we’ll get to sleep for long anyway.” He jokes. “We should land at about 8am. Think we should go straight to the doctors or make an appointment?”
“Honestly? Amazing. She’s so great.” Their boss sighs in delight. “For a while I thought she was gonna stay with AJ but she’s here now. And she’s with me. And I couldn’t be happier.”
“Sacrificed himself? How?” Sam’s interest was definitely peaked.
After returning to Kansas a little bruised and banged up, Bertie was able to get holed away in her future-old room at the bunker. She spent all of one day using her mojo to snap things clean, preparing for her family to eventually move in. Including stocking the kitchen with several pies to bribe Dean if need be.
“They did fight it out. When I’m from the universes are collapsing on each other because of it. Michael…he… he destroyed my family. Destroyed the world. If I can’t even
Before they could stop her or Castiel could track her, she disappeared.
“What happened to Sam,” Sam said, rolling his eyes at his brother. “Is that Sam got captured by Lilith and some of her cronies.”
A chilly laugh sounded from the corner of the room at each resounding
“How do you, uh, feel about that? The fact that we’re, you know?” Dean gestured with his hand helplessly. He really hoped that the normally clueless angel understood what it was that he was trying to say.
Bertie’s eyes snapped to his. She swallowed. “Uh…”
<3<3<3
Sam coughed, clearing his throat. "What did I miss?"
, had him widening his eyes.
Sam left unsaid. He cleared his throat. "But might I suggest a shower and clean clothes first? You know, before heading out into the drunken masses? You can wear some of those new clothes we got for you."
“Wow. Way to kill a boner, Samsquatch.” Gabriel sank back, though his eyes lingered briefly on the hunter’s lips. He should have known that prayer was too good to be true. He had to admit that he had had some issue with getting the younger Winchester off his mind. He tended to get off with him on his mind, but that was neither here nor there. Wait, where was he? Oh right. “So baby blue eyes is missing, huh? You try praying?”
“Demons have him. Follow me if you want.” Within a blink she was gone, leaving him gaping at the empty spot on his carpet.
“Exactly how big is this place?” Sam asked. He was itching to start looking around. There was obviously a lot of history here.
Gabriel shouldn’t have been so surprised that Sam’s verbal beat down on his idiot older brother worked. He had put his faith in Sam fucking Winchester to stop the apocalypse, of course the moose would have been able to get through to his brother.
That thought brought up more questions. When had he died? When had Sam? Who was her mother? Her older brother? Dean's mind brought up an image of Lisa and Ben. It would certainly explain Bertie's hair color.
“Is that a mirror in your pocket? Because I can see myself in your pants.”
And that meant she would just have to put up with dealing with these men, these hunters.
Bertie landed back in the bunker, unmoved by the weight of her Dad and Uncle. That had been an interesting run. In a matter of hours they had gone on a hunting spree, visiting several locations where there were known to be ghosts. She had memorized the hunts her family had gone on years before her birth, studying their journals as a child. They had gotten to a small hotel where the murderous ghosts of children liked to ‘play’. Then they had hit an old mansion that was once a speak-easy, destroying the vengeful owner and releasing the spirits he had held captive inside. There was even one that involved plague masks. She shuddered. That one had been quite disturbing. They had also managed to get in a few basic salt-n-burns in there as well.
Sam glanced over from the section he was currently working through of the old cataloging system the MOL had in place. He closed the binder in his hands. He could tell that beneath the gruffness of Dean’s question, his older brother was worried. “You tried praying to Cas?”
.” Standing and still holding Trickster and juggling the drink in one hand, Sam moved to grab a sandwich with his free one. Dean was going to fight him on this, deny it to his dying breath, but he needed to hear it whether he wanted to or not. “You’re allowed to be happy Dean, and Cas makes you happy. Maybe it’s time for you to admit it to yourself.”
"No. No you cannot show me that!" Castiel clasped his head, trying to block out the scene, the overwhelming pain it caused.
Comments, kudos, and yada yada
Now he was tied to a chair in some dark, dank abandoned warehouse. They had started with beating him, expecting him to fall in line with what they wanted. Just let them open the seals in peace and they’d let him go.
Bertie simply laughed. “Actually, the whole Munchkin thing isn’t that far off.” Her parents had told her how Charlie had gone to Oz from the bunker after they had read her
Bobby had snorted and returned to his whiskey after calling them all ‘idjits’.
As for Dean? Her Dad had never looked so young.
Gabriel remained silent. He looked like a petulant five year old, arms crossed and pouting.
Naomi choked back a sob. Gabriel was alive! She barely knew what to think. She had been in this position for over a millennia. Ordered by Michael himself as to her directive, and she always followed his orders. But Gabriel, the once playful and kind angel she once admired from afar was alive before her, demanding answers to questions she dare not ask herself. She nodded tearfully and began.
- she was supposed to be. The plan had been to only go back a few months, a year at most. But looking at the man holding a gun to her, she knew she had messed up. But with the universes clashing against each other the way they were back in her time, something was bound to have gone wrong. Jack had warned her the dangers. She didn't care, not if it meant saving everything.
Dean smiled and said what he had wanted to for years.
He slammed the door shut to his room, blocking out the sound of his brother and angel talking downstairs. He ran a frustrated hand through his locks. Sam had to get out of here, he couldn’t be around his brother right now without causing Dean some serious harm.
Sam gaped as his brother passed out, falling hard to the dirty motel carpet. The woman rushed to his side.
"Why are you here? You shouldn't be here." Castiel's vessel was shaking. Were these emotions? It wasn't something he had ever before experienced, not to this extent. Perhaps it had to do with the fact he didn't know how to feel about what she had just sent him over angelic communication.
"Looks like you messed up a bit, Buck-o."
“What do you mean, I said yes? Yes to what?” Dean frowned, unsure of what they were talking about. He wondered if this had anything to do with the work Heaven had wanted him for.
His looked up in the shower, ignoring the water splashing his face, to take in the view. Sam was rinsing off his hair, arms raised, muscles ripped and soapy. Gabriel had to admit that this had to be in the top five best showers he had ever had. There hadn’t even been any hanky-panky happening. Just the large hunter cleansing him gently and with more care than the Trickster had ever been given.
*****
It was well past one AM when the a car starting out in the yard could be heard. Dean’s eyes snapped open, knowing it was Sammy making his escape.
” Michael gaped.
On a plane of existence outside of the human range of perception the Cupid was having a mild panic attack. He didn't know what to do. If he didn't fix quickly this he was going to be not only fired but lose his wings. He chewed on his nails, wings twitching in fear.
But first she needed to find out was when she was before she started to change anything, and damn the consequences.
“Hey, there buddy. How’d you get in there?” Sam let the animal sniff his hand, letting the dog know he could trust him. As gently as he could, Sam untangled the branches from the pup’s fur. The corgi was covered in mud and shivering with cold. Sam unzipped his hoodie, wrapping the small animal in it before picking him up. Sam checked but there was no collar. “Easy buddy. I got ya.”
“Chuck Shurley,” she answered, turning off the ignition.
Currently invisible inside the old Men of Letters bunker the Cupid snuck down the winding hallways. He phased through the closed door, sneaking into Sam Winchester's bedroom.
"No one asked you."
Dean took a second to center himself. No one grabs food from his plate, with the exception of Sammy. But the action had come second nature to her, that it wasn't the first time she had done that. "Why not just kill her?"
And now had been hit with an arrow earmarked for a Winchester. The Cupid began to panic as he watched his mistake unfold.
Castiel looked at both his charge and the woman, tilting his head in confusion. He didn't know who this woman was, or what this woman was. For all appearances, even to his angelic eyes, she was human. But no human would have been able to purge the demon blood from a host the way she had. No angel either. Only an Archangel or God would be able to accomplish such a feat. He needed to test her, to see if she could hear him. He sent out a question over angelic wavelengths.
Comments, kudos and yada yada
“I honestly don’t have a response to that.” Grabbing another beer out of the cooler, he asked again. “Is Bertie right, though? Can we stop this now? Can we prevent all that from happening?”
“Why aren’t you more upset?” Sam asked. While he and Castiel may not have been extremely close, Sam still felt the loss of his friend. “He is -was your father. Why are you so calm?”
“Dean, we haven’t been on any case in months. Not since Cas became human.” Sam knew he was going to push his brother’s comfort level with this, but it needed said. “And I’m pretty sure it’s for the same reasons I don’t want to take Trickster out on a case either.”
Dean looked up at the trench coated angel. "What demon blood?" he asked angrily.
“Gramps didn’t name me. He just created me. I was named by my fathers.”
He was still yelling when new visitors to the demon party appeared. Tears distorted his view but that didn’t stop him from watching as one by one his demon torturers were lit up like 4th of July fireworks as they were smote by the pair.
She didn’t realize that she had started to cry until she was pulled into Dean’s arms. She had lost so much, her parents, her brother, her uncle and friends. She couldn’t allow them to die that way, not again. Not when she could stop it.
*****
It had been over a week since Cas had just disappeared from Bobby’s, and less than that since they had fist ventured to the bunker. Or as Dean had taken to calling it: The Batcave. The move into the bunker had been fairly painless and quick. Bertie had done the bulk of the move, using a simple snap of her archangel mojo put everything away. Bobby decided to stay at his home, but most of his library got transferred over for safe keeping.
"That means..." Surprising everyone present, Dean's sentence cut off as he fell backwards, blacking out.
“We aren’t asking you too, just for one small miracle. Bring Cas back. Bring back my Father. Please.” Bertie pleaded.
going to insult his daughter.
“And I’m not a freak,” Sam had a hard time not taking offense to the term after finding out about the demon blood in his system. His jaw clenched in anger. Gabriel held up his hands, with a sincere “Sorry.”
“With ya in a minute Samsquatch.” He returned his golden gaze back to the bitch demon. Across the room, Bertie was handling the remainder of Lilith’s crew. “Now, Lilly-doll. I think it’s time you give up on this, don’t you?”
“Michael? That’s who has Cas?” Dean glared. Now he had a name for the dickbag he would be killing.
Bobby removed his cap, scratching the back of his head. "Huh, who'da thunk it?"
“Shut up!” The blond man commanded, before turning to address the other two. “Hannah, you and Inias take the woman. I’ll deal with the Winchester child and prepare him for Michael.”
The rating has changed from Mature to Explicit and I have added appropriate tagging.
“Hey! I’m not saying that Cas can’t take care of himself.” Dean argued. Grabbing a few beers from the refrigerator, he passed one to his brother.
“Really Dean? I was unaware of that,” Cas responded with a tilt of his head.
“Jack. My brother.” Bertie nodded. “He may have been born of Lucifer but he is pure Winchester. Was pure Winchester. When he was born he accidentally created a rift between universes. Michael came through with his armies. Lucifer thought he could fight him off if he had more power. He stole Jack’s grace, and kidnapped him, to keep taking it.”
Max’s, not Gabriel’s.
Sam walked back over to them. As much as he wanted to learn of this new shelter, he was much more interested in learning more of his own family history. “Henry Winchester? He was a Man of Letters? I thought they were just a myth.”
“Hey Cas, can you look up such and such?”
The air grew thick with tension around them. Bobby decided to intercede. "Just what gives you the right to can just come in here and change the game?"
Michael scoffed. “What do I want?
other than debate on what to binge watch next on Netflix.
As always Comments, Kudos and yada yada yada ya'll
"Mary? Not..." Sam refused to believe it.
“Bitch.”
Who was this hunter's soul mate? Cupids weren't always told who the match would be, if ever, but sometimes they could sense the proximity. This man's was very close. As a general rule Cupid's were only sent on assignment if the subjects were soon to be near their matches.
“Now what?” Sam asked, not noticing the look Gabriel and Bertie gave each other. In a blink they were gone. Two seconds later he heard Chuck yelp from inside the house. He grinned. Letting himself inside, he found the others in the living room. Chuck was scrunched down in a broken recliner, clutching a bottle of whiskey. Bertie and Gabriel stood in front of him, mirroring each other with arms crossed.
It was time.
She shouldn't tell him, tell them that part yet, even when they found out the rest. She shouldn't, yet the urge to spill everything hovered at the tip of her tongue. The admittance was held off as the door to the hotel room opened and someone she hadn't seen since his death stepped into the room. Her heart jumped to her throat. Now wasn't the time to dwell on something that might not come to pass. She forcibly held back her human emotions.
Dean was confused. “His vessel? What, did the dicks upstairs expel him from his meat-suit or something? Can’t you just put him back?”
Five hours later they reappeared in Bobby's study, exhausted, laughing and covered in blood. Their appearance startled the rooms occupants. Bobby, who had been pouring over an old manuscript at his desk, shouted, "Balls!" Sam, who had been pacing the floor at the time, had almost walked right into the pair.
"Yeah, right." Sam was speechless. He looked at the stranger - his
Demons had him. No.
her safe.”
“Hey! Ass-butt!” Bertie called out, stepping out from behind Sam. “What do you want?”
Coming into the room behind her uncle, Bertie looked worriedly at Dean. He was upset, but not the way they had left him. This was pissed off Dean. And an angry Dean Winchester was a dangerous one. “Dad?”
**8***8***
“No!” Gabriel’s heart broke as he flew into the room, breaking the wall apart in his rage. He didn’t care if his older brothers found out that he was alive. He couldn’t care while Castiel…
Butting his head into Sam’s leg a few times, Gabriel tried to get him to hurry up. As much as he would love to dawdle in the shower with the naked Winchester, the archangel could sense the other two morons out in the war room. Sam laughed at his antics.
Now Sam on the other wing, poor soul, had lost several potential soul mates to death in his young life. First Jessica being killed by a demon, Madison out of necessity from going bad as a werewolf, Sarah had been killed by Crowley. Even his first "girlfriend" Amy had been killed by his brother.
* * * * *
She stood up slowly, knowing how they could probably get fairly trigger happy. "No. Not an angel dick bag."
He is however taken by surprise when Dean reaches between his own legs, squeezing and stroking gently even though he isn’t hard. It feels calming and really nice, just like when they had that bath.
“Okay.” Jimmy replies and rests his head to the side against Dean’s arm.
“Don’t worry.” Cas says when Jimmy sniffles again. “It’s okay, it’s okay.”
I circle the car and help the angel walk across the gravel and then the grass. He helps me place the blanket down and spread it so we can sit on it.

“What’s this about, hmm?” Dean takes hold of Cas’ hands to stop him.
. His boots seem to have no grip when it comes to this godforsaken mud. Everyone around him is struggling to keep balance as well. The hill they’re trekking across is a watery, marshy mess of mud and grass. It just slides out from underneath them as soon as they step. It’s slowing the mission down and they’re losing time.
“Cas Cas Cas it’s okay. I’m right here.” Dean fussed over him but he
sound weird.
Gabe turns around, seeing Cas sitting on Dean’s knee. “You two look like a cute couple.”
“Were you the one that asked that breakfast van about a guy in a trench coat?”
It happens sometimes. He stands up and his vision just starts going black. They were told to be careful because he could still pass out. What joy.
I needed to clear up one of Cas' problems.
question he can answer with every bit of confidence possible. “Yes. Yes I am.” Dean laughs quietly, squeezing Jimmy in a hug. “I love you and your dad very very much.”

“I need to see the doctor again, mom.” Cas continues the sentence. Dean realizes Cas has never actually said that –
Gabe feels really guilty about all of this, but he can explain and apologize to them when they get off the boat. He reminds himself that Dean is just as much Jimmy’s dad as Cas is now. Especially after Dean showed him the engagement ring.
become an angel again, you won’t have to be around me intimately anymore. I’ll need no physical help, so you won’t, well, you won’t fall asleep with me or anything.” His voice wobbles and he shakes a little in my arms.
“Hi Mary.” He greets cheerfully.
“Sure. Go get them.” Cas smiles back and Jimmy practically jumps off him before running to his bedroom.
“Look, I know you’re scared, but you’re safe here. We’ve got you. We’ve got you buddy.”
“Ribs are sore, got a headache, hate the feeling of having tubes stuck in everywhere but overall not too bad I guess. I don’t feel sick anymore. But I’m quite tired though.”
“Cas, is think your mom is here.” He whispers, shifting on the bed to sit up. Cas forces his eyes open and sets them on Dean. Dean can see that he is in pain, but he
pressure, as if he’s doing to Dean what he likes himself. There’s something about all of those factors that have Dean getting worked up all of a sudden, having to shove his hand into his pants to take Cas’ hand away. He doesn’t want to come yet. Not yet.
“There.” Dean whispered, and Cas felt the blankets being pulled up to his waist.
I laugh at his face and he rolls his eyes, leaning forward and kissing me passionately.
“Thanks Eileen.” I smile again and take a detour to me and Cas’ room.
I lead us over to the tree and help Cas down onto the grass beside it. We’re still in the sun, just not as directly.
“Goodbye, Castiel.” She replies, her voice reassuring. She nods towards the door after a moment, encouraging Cas to leave and ‘forget about her’.
Cas watches Gabe and Dean walk ahead towards the diner. He looks down to Jimmy when he twists around in his arms.
“Okay, okay” Dean readjusts his grip on Cas “not much longer now and then it’ll all be gone. You just have a little longer and then you can rest. You can rest.”
“I look like a prisoner. Or some kind of…I dunno, some kind of
The other people who are possessed pull out their weapons suddenly and start to attack viciously. Blood starts to spill.
Dean had found out that Michael had been extremely rude and belittling to Cas when he had accidentally spilled a cup of milk. It was easily done –
“Is he gonna be okay?” Is the first thing Dean can think to say. Considering Anna has a certain level of expertise, she might know.
I kiss his hair before glancing at my watch. We still have another 35 minutes or so. That should give enough time for a quick power up for me too I guess.
Everyone looks at him when he appears, including Jimmy who is looking at him hopefully.
I get out of the car and lick my lips, hoping to God that they’re not too obviously swollen from me and Cas’ make-out session. Mind you, what the fuck is God gonna do about it? He wouldn’t give a damn anyway. He hasn’t even come to talk to Cas after I asked him so nicely (which is admittedly not common for me).
Nine. One. One.
“You’re together aren’t you.” Dean murmurs, shifting his eyes back over to look at Cas. As soon as he admits that he’s figured it out, Castiel’s face changes as if he’s slipped his
Cas halts at the door, looking at him for a second before entering the room silently, walking over to his bed and starting to get ready in his pajamas.
“It’s okay, Cas. They don’t mind waiting. So, you want to know about everything after you fell?”
However, I don’t notice Cas open his eyes and grip onto my shirt until he is tugging me upwards to straddle him on the chair.
“Sort of.” I mutter, dreading where this is going.
“Just like last time, Cas. It’ll make your leg feel better and you’ll be able to relax. Look at me, kay? It’s just me.”
Dean chuckles back, kissing him again. “See you later. Text me when you get up?”
“Sounds good.” Charlie nods.
Jody, who is now watching Cas, gives me a confused look.
idiot.
“Not severe.” He shrugs.
Dean smiled and leant to kiss his forehead. “Me too.”
“Okay. Come on Cas, let’s get you to the bathroom before your bladder bursts or something.”
“Cas, you uh” Gabe gestures to Cas’ front.
With a bottle of milk in hand, Dean climbs the stairs, feeling when Jimmy starts to get worked up again. “Hey, what’s wrong buddy?” He asks softly.
“Why?”
Dean shifts his position a little so Cas’ head rests against him more comfortably.
A deep groan rumbled from Dean’s chest when Cas pressed his knee harder, suddenly flipping them over. His gave a playful smirk when Dean looked at him in surprise.
“What?” Dean asks with an amused smile.
Cas hesitates when he sees it, looking up at me. I nod in reassurance and he finally opens the box.
(Lots of fluff...annnnnd a little bit of smut)
“I’ll go check. Will you be okay?” Gabe lets go of Cas’ hand and stands up.
“Seven fifteen. Jimmy woke up at six and couldn’t sleep so I got up with him. We’re meeting everyone at the diner at eight, but Cas if you need some more sleep, just stay here, yeah? No one minds. I’ll just tell people that you were up with Jimmy in the night.”
When Cas stirs from sleep, he can tell he isn’t feeling great. He feels too cold, but also a little too warm and he can’t decide whether he wants to bundle up under the covers or kick them off altogether.
“I don’t understand what you mean.” Cas frowns, letting someone scoop some mash up before splatting it on his tray.
“Okay!”
“Y-yeah?” I hate myself for stuttering, I really do, but I can’t help it after thinking about all of that.
He jumped when he felt something cold against his hole, realising it was Dean’s finger.
“Fine. Cas, didn’t you say the angel had those blades for her well-being or something? They might have threatened her since it was a false case. You know, to lure us there.”
let that happen. Not anymore.
look, but he keeps his mouth shut for the rest of the walk.
buying condoms?”
, not just for hanging out in?! What the hell were you doing in the other one?! Fucking tap dancing?”
Cas hops out of the car, smile still stuck on his face. He’s really amused himself, and he laughs when he makes eye contact with Dean as he walks towards the doors of the building.
. He might have pissed a load of angels off majorly, but on the inside he’s just a child, and there’s nothing wrong with that. That’s why we’re friends with him, why we
“I need to go to the bathroom.” He laughs and I roll my eyes.
God looks up to what must be the sky in this white atmosphere, and we both watch a small vial drop into my cupped hands. It has a blue, luminescent glow, and when I realise what it is, I stare in shock.
“No, it’s fine. He was gonna find out sometime. And anyway, I told him about-” Cas cuts himself off, suddenly realizing he was about to accidentally spill the truth about Chuck. He’s not sure if he wants Gabe to know just yet. Damn, he needs to wake up and get his head screwed on.
“I’m afraid we can’t do that. The compound is bound to his body. It cannot be removed or passed to another.”
“And I’ll be here for you.” Dean ran his fingers through Cas’ hair. “All the way.”
“…um…hey.” He says, a little embarrassed.
“Coming inside?”
have, and I haven’t known
“Nah, them ones are all sold out.” She admits, “we got a load ‘a doubles though.”
Cas smiles. “Are you gonna give the thing to Jimmy?”
if you need to come home any time, I’ll come get you. Okay?”
I dab at another cut gently, examining the angel’s body further. There are burn marks across his skin, and his back is also covered in small injuries.
“He’s good! That’s all thank you.”
Cas rolls his eyes fondly. “Okay.” He agrees, moving his hands down under the table.
“Cas, wake up.” Dean whispers again and Cas forces his eyes open to see Dean propped up on his elbow, looking at him through the dark. There’s a…
“He’s
“Wait, I need the toilet before we go.”
drive because he absolutely
Dean’s words sunk in. He turned them around in his head for a silent minute or two, starting to feel like Dean had wrapped a warm safety blanket around him.
“Isn’t that a violation of your own privacy?” Dean chuckled despite the heavy subject, running his thumb across Cas’ back where it was positioned around him.
“Fine.” He gives in and takes the bottle from my hand before uncapping it and taking a few gulps.
Cas swallows, almost like he doesn’t want to tell the truth. “It hurts.” Cas closes his eyes, snaking an arm across his chest.
“Thank you.” He murmurs, sitting up so he can press our lips together. Our mouths move tenderly against each other for a few minutes until I can tell that the angel is struggling to stay awake.
“We don’t get long, do we.” Dean says and his friends nod.
“Um, Cas?”
to be nice to him.
The light engulfs me and I feel it take me somewhere. Somewhere high.
He looked at his feet. “I mean, it hurt that my own
better than he did five minutes ago. He feels an exhausted sense of relief spin through him.
“…so yeah. That’s how.” I decide and Cas looks at me, amazed.
Dean rolled his eyes fondly. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“Hey, just think of bed. All the cozy blankets and your teddies.” Cas adds and it does the trick. Jimmy lets him stand up slowly and Cas is able to carry him to his room. He helps Jimmy into his pajamas and get ready in the bathroom before tucking him into bed. Dean appears shortly after with a sippy cup full of warm milk.
Cas takes a few moments to himself, organising his thoughts and processing what just happened. He’s going to have to talk to Michael about Luke. He can’t let a hurtful word like that slide. He just hopes Jimmy isn’t pretending to be okay about it, and he hopes to god it doesn’t stick with him for too long.
He’s breathing heavily and squirming everywhere, added to the occasional whimper that escapes his mouth.
They finish getting food and make their way to the table.
He slides his hands down and fumbles with mine to stop me stroking so he can do it for me, and when he does, it’s fucking amazing.
“Dean!” Cas panics when he wobbles a little when we go over a small bump in the ice.
He apologizes to people as he walks through the crowd, eyes scanning for Jack’s red hat and Jimmy’s little blue coat.
When he enters Jimmy’s room, his son is sitting up in bed. He’s looking straight ahead, not exactly moving, but when Cas moves closer, he looks up.
.” I cut him off, wanting to kick myself for sounding harsher than I meant to be.
“You probably need some rest now, hmm?” Dean leans forwards in the seat, placing his hand on Cas’ leg on top of the covers.
I sigh and realise that I have already retrieved the box and am making my way back to the main room.
It feels cold without him here with me.
Cas smiles again and shuffles closer to me until our shoulders are touching. He reaches forward and takes my right hand that is resting on my thigh into his own then threads our fingers together.
“There’s a lot of laughing going on in here.” Dean says with a smile as he pushes the door open.
“Cas, wait up. Why are you walking so fast? We got ages yet.” Dean has to do a small, awkward jog to catch up with Cas.
Cas gives him a playful shove before slowly turning his head to kiss Dean. Dean places a warm hand on the side of his neck, kissing back a little more open-mouthed than usual. They haven’t made out for a good while because they haven’t really had a minute to spare with settling into the house, so it feels nice to share a little intimate moment with the added cover of the booth they’re sitting in.
I open the first aid kit and pull out anti-bacterial wipes and bandages to clear Cas up. He only has his dress pants on so it is easy enough to see where he needs cleaning up. I tear the packet with my teeth and pull the wipe out before slowly dragging it across the skin where blood has dried. He is covered in bruises and looks absolutely terrible. He’s
“Uriel? Why have I been summoned?” The blue eyed angel eyed his brother warily. They weren’t meeting in one of their usual spots. Instead Castiel had been called to an abandoned amusement park, long forgotten by the humans who lived nearby. The rusted Ferris wheel was overgrown by the forest trying to reclaim it back into its natural elements. Shoots of ivy and wild grape vines inched ever higher around the dilapidated structure.
"Yeah, Mary Campbell Winchester. It's a long story." That was all that she was willing to tell them. It still hurt too much to think about. It hurt too much to admit it was her fault. She needed to step away. She cleared her throat. "I don't know about you but I'm exhausted. I'll be back tomorrow."
him. He’s different – he actually has a heart underneath all of that angel warrior-ness.
Sam rubs Cas’ back until he finishes heaving. As the angel was leaning forward, I lean him back to rest on my shoulder, tilting his head up so he can breathe more easily. We stay like that for a few moments until we’re sure he’s done.
Sam cautiously enters the bathroom and takes hold of one side of Cas while I hold the other. We escort him back into the main room and lay him down on the bed so we can put dressings on his cuts, especially the one on his leg. It looks like the knife went straight through.
“I don’t know, but I love putting up with you. It’s great.” He admitted. He was in love. He really was. So much.
Dean bites his lip while he waits for Jimmy to reply. If worst comes to the worst, Dean can try and look after him tonight. It’s just not ideal given that Cas is going to be in pain and it’s not something they want Jimmy to be around for. Cas isn’t going to be screaming or anything, it’s just…Jimmy will get upset if he sees Cas unwell in bed.
“No. Not this time Dean. You’re the last person he wants to see right now and you know it. Now, you’re going to go over to the car and get in the driver’s seat while
If I dream, it’s never really a dream, more of a nightmare unless it’s about women and- let’s not get into that. When I wake, all I can remember is Cas, screaming for help up to the sky, standing completely alone on a highway, injured and scared with tears in his eyes. He was screaming for me.
“Yeah you are. Tell me what you’re thinking, Cas.” I tell him, keeping my tone soft.
“Finally.” I laugh, “no more wallet stealing and father-like scolding.”
“Hey Castiel.” Claire greets almost shyly. That’s not like her at all. At. All.
in my arms Cas. I want to fall asleep with you, I want to be able to love you. Please!” His hand runs through my hair frantically but gently.
“I love
“I’ll try.” Cas agrees, looking weak where he’s standing.
I look down at my injured leg and realise I’m wearing Dean’s clothes. If the wound is deep, they must have put bandages on my leg, so if there’s bandages, there’s no way they can get painkiller anywhere near it while I have clothes on.
There is a small knock on the door and I turn to look who it came from.
Something’s wrong, and Dean’s going to find what it is and fix it.
“Yes, and we live with our son very happily.”
I nod and keep staring into the hunter’s eyes, searching for any kind of lie but there is none. When I feel the needle pierce my skin, I ball some of the bed sheets up in my hand and grip onto them before finding Dean’s hand and gripping that instead.
“What happened
“Just one more? Pleeease.” Dean makes a noise of effort when he reaches across Cas again.
Cas giggles. “I think I’m gonna take some online classes for something, I don’t know.”
Forcing myself out of bed and away from the warmth that is Cas, I wander over to the door groggily to open it up, which reveals an angry but worried looking Sam who is fully dressed.
“Good. I know you can.” Cas smiled. “I gotta go, but I’ll see you soon, yeah?”
I give in and bat his hands away quickly, moving his t-shirt up a little so I can grab hold of the waistband of his pants and yank them down enough for him to get this going before it’s too late.
Everyone is sitting in the main room now on all of the couches, apart from Sam who is in the kitchen getting himself and Eileen another round of beers.
We dig in to our food and damn, it tastes good.
“Dean.” He says.
Cas walks over to the sink and washes his hands before walking back over to me and backing me against the wall.
“I-” Cas stops to breathe again, curling an arm over his ribs as if it’ll make them hurt less. “I heard a door slam. I don’t know where he went.”
“Sit.” Blonde-hair tells him with the same tone that mystery voice used. Dean sits down but disregards the firmness in his voice and is about to start firing questions, but somehow blonde-hair’s gaze keeps him quiet. Dean looks him up and down, seeing from his body language that he’s definitely an angel. He’s staring at Dean stoic-faced, and is standing straight as a board, his arms hanging limply but neatly by his sides. Yep. Angel.
“Oh yeah, I know the one. He seems a little quieter than the others, don’t you think?”
“Hey Cas.” He says softly before reaching forwards to where my hand is. I pull away and look at him.
“What the
My fingers linger in his hair for a couple more seconds before I guide Cas under the water. He loses his balance a bit, but I catch him and hold him close to make sure he doesn’t nearly fall again.
“It’s has no real biological relations to your demon knife as Dean assumed, but I remember there being more knives similar to yours. They come in a set, and you have the weakest one. Obviously, the more advanced, the more damage it does to the demon’s vessel.”
my dad!” Cas snaps in a loud, defensive burst. Only after the words leave his mouth does he realize that he just accidentally revealed the truth. Maybe it was the sleepiness talking, but hearing the word
“Dean, will you…I mean…since you’re okay with us being close…”
I lean down and peck him on the lips. “Anyway,” I wrap my arm around my warm boyfriend, “good morning, sweetheart.”
“It’s a bunch of cookies stacked up next to some donuts. Simple but effective.” Gabe shows a picture of it on the phone and Cal hums in approval.
“Jus’ five more minutes.” I grumble into the pillow sleepily.
“Now.” He agrees, and we move away from each other, crawling into the trees so no one sees or knows that we’ve gone.
There’s a delicate carving of a feather, next to the words
“Ha-ha. He
“How did you get hard so fast?” I laugh again and he shrugs, smirking. “Wanna go back home?”
.” Dean reasons.
“I have my reasons.” Gabriel shrugs.
“Sorry. It just smells really good.”
“Yeah.”
“You don’t know that. Besides, that soda tasted really good as well. Should I go?”
, you’re my best friend, and you’re also the person I love-“
“Cas, buddy, you scared me.” I say, sitting down on the decking next to him. This is when I find that he is watching a ladybird crawl around on his arm. The little smile that pulls across his face makes my heart flutter with affection. The admiration in his eyes for that small creature along with the way his face is lit up by the soft light makes me smile too, and all I want to do is hug him.
“What got you two all amused?” Jody smiles when we make an appearance, and I am happy that none of them appear to have heard Cas’ little episode.
“I guess I was just thinking about how they will have hired a new receptionist by the time I’m ready. I know David said I could come back but his offer might have an expiration date.”
Dean rubs his arm. “We’ll fix it together. With a couple doctors. It’s all going to be okay, I promise.”
“Wait, what?”
“Good morning to you too.” Dean chuckled, placing a hand against the sleep-warmed skin of Cas’ cheek. “How ya feelin’?”
I go to do the same for Cas but remember him being unsure about taking clothes off. “You okay with this?” I mutter between kisses and Cas nods, letting me remove his hoodie and his t-shirt.
“Sounds good. I’ll be there at ten.”
am I glad she did because it gives me a chance to actually watch Cas, yes
He’s only wearing his green t-shirt and white boxers, but I don’t think he particularly cares right now.
The thought made him smile, as did Cas. “Did you do any better?”
“Are you still going grocery shopping tomorrow?” Dean wonders when he re-enters the room, a plate of pie in hand.
“Didn’t wanna ask in front- in front of Dean and Uncle Gabe.”
“It didn’t happen that way, Cas. That didn’t happen, alright? Don’t worry about things that didn’t happen because it’ll stress you out. You hear me?” He searches Cas’ face for understanding and thankfully Cas gives a small nod.
“It’s snowing too.” Claire tells us, shivering.
He nods to himself, walking inside just thinking.
This unbearable torture has been going on incessantly. Cut after cut, burn after burn, hit after hit.
“I’m Dr. Clarke and I’ll be helping you today Eddie.” Dr. Clarke smiles at Cas, and he gives a faint nod in return. He’s gone all shy or something. Not that I blame him. “Ok, follow me then.” It looks like we got a good doctor this time. She seems really nice, which is great for Cas. In the past, me and Sam have had monsters taking care of us. Even Jody’s had a couple of Leviathans.
Dean stands gaping at his surroundings for a few moments, thinking of ways he might be able to find Sam or Cas if they’re here too. “Think think think.” He says quietly to himself, twisting the blade in his hand over and over.
Cas feels right. Cas is love...
“I like it.” Cas laughs and I roll my eyes.
a tear slip down my face, but this time, it isn’t from sadness, or embarrassment or humiliation or anything else. It’s
“What do you think of Eileen?” I ask, swinging Cas’ hand in my own.
All of these questions run through my head, but I can’t mull them over for long because Cas finally throws up. Again. Poor guy.
Uriel chuckled coldly at the treatment given to his former superior.
Bertie rolled her eyes. Some things didn’t really change.
<3<3<3
Bertie reached out, tapping his forehead. Before Dean blacked out on the ground she snapped her fingers sending him to his room to sleep undisturbed for the next ten hours or so. She knew her father wouldn’t be in the right mind set to do what needed to be done next.
As he met the Sasquatch’s eye, his for all intents and purposes,
“Cas! Cas, are you okay?” Dean shouted. His heart raced at seeing how his angel had been treated. This wasn’t exactly the reunion he wanted them to have if Cas was lucky enough to be brought back.
started one. To be fair though, it was a legitimate concern and safety hazard to bring along a pet when they went hunting.
She knew she needed to give him time to think everything over. Standing, she took a breath to tell him so, when she felt it. The panicked prayer reaching out to her.
“Dean…”
Someone finally notices that things are changing and not in the way they want...
“Sammy-”
Golden knowing eyes narrowed as he considered his next move. "Look Coop. I get that it was a mistake, shooting Cassie-pants instead of Dean-o, right? You got a plan yet to fix it?"
Good news is I have the next few chapters slightly plotted (for once) so that means this actually might get finished!
Uh oops. Didn't mean to leave this for a year. Sorry.
“We go find Gramps.”
just blow his mind?- she had remained fairly silent.
“Wait! What do you mean ‘help Sam’?” For the first time since they started talking, Gabriel was invested in something she was saying.
“He’s not
in this situation would feel what you’re feeling, Cas”) Dean had said to him – but still, he feels an unsteady feeling twisting his insides around and around.
Cas works on breathing in and out slowly as he wanders past each hospital room. He hates hospitals with an absolute passion. They’re so
at the minute, and that’s fine.” Dean kisses the top of his head. Cas lets his tears fall freely. Dean wipes them away each time they fall. “You’re sick, so
fibre of his being. But…he has her acceptance. And it makes him feel…complete. He feels whole, even though she did what she did to him. That’s all over now, and she’s changed her way of looking at things, even though she’s still an annoyingly proud, stupid-ass bitch.
It just so happens that this mission exists, and Cas sees it as a way out – a way to just
“Dean.” He moans quietly, appreciating the sparks coursing through his veins while Dean nibbles at his ear.
Dean follows Gabe inside who has Jimmy held in one arm. He places the little boy on the couch while he goes back to the car to get their stuff and his duffel bag ready for tomorrow.
“That explains it! He’s related to you?” Dean says with fake surprise.
“As soon as the others get back we’re going straight home, okay? We need to get you into bed.”
Cas tenses up, his eyes locked onto Dean. Blood spills from his mouth but he manages to get a few words out. “W- whatever world I find myself in…I-I will always feel the s-same about you, Dean.” Cas’ voice is small and pained. Dean guesses the bomb damaged him internally.
in the afternoon.” Dean explains for the fifth time. They’re brainstorming what to do – they both think it’s time for Cas to go home. “I get that he’s catching up on sleep but he slept ten pm to two pm, and now it’s what” Dean looks at his watch “six – and he’s asleep in bed again.”
Cas hears him say (pretty loudly)
“Yeah. Tired himself out I think.” Cas replies. “Thanks for staying with him. Really, thank you.”
Much to my surprise though, Cas turns back to me, lifts himself up and straddles my own hips. His eyes are full of doubt, but he gazes down at me, licking his lips. I watch him carefully as his eyes flicker down to look at my lips. And slowly, he leans down cautiously before pressing his lips against mine. We stay still for a moment before I move my mouth against his. He follows my lead and you can tell he’s inexperienced, but it’s genuinely the best kiss of my life.
As it’s quite late, it doesn’t take Sammy long to drop off. He got barely any sleep the last couple of nights so I don’t blame him to be honest.
“You all done, Cas?” Dean asks, seeming concerned about the amount of food Cas has eaten
“I was crumpled in a cupboard for fifteen minutes.” Cas explains.
“So I put some decent clothes on and some cologne and we went to this club. I’ve always hated clubbing, so I didn’t feel like staying long, but there was this guy who kept looking at me. Gabe pushed me over to him and being the awkward shit I am, I just stared at this guy like a rabbit in a headlight.”
“Yeah.” She laughs. “But, look, let’s start fresh. I want to make it up to you for being a pain in the arse most of the time.”
Dean nodded, taking the information in. The only sounds in the room were the soft humming noises of the appliances and the rain against the windows.
A Christmas classic starts playing from the speaker Sam has and it finally starts to get me into a
“We’re a bit down about what happened today, aren’t we bud.” Dean fills him in, taking Cas’ free hand to lock their fingers together. Cas squeezes Dean’s hand.
“Coward.” Roan chuckles and this is when Cas snaps, standing up and throwing a hard punch at the guy’s face.
Dean sighs sympathetically. “Cas, look, I…I know what happened okay?” He sighs, sliding down to sit next to Cas on the floor. Cas’ eyes look watery.
“It’s fine. We can handle this. It’s gonna be okay.” Dean pulls him into another hug and Cas hugs back firmly.
proud of you so…we’re not here just to look at animals. We’re here to adopt one.” Cas explains, trying to gauge Jimmy’s reaction. Jimmy looks confused for a moment before it clicks.
Cas smiles back at them both. “Recovering thankfully.”
Cas begins to feel exhaustion creeping into his shoulders. Shopping always tires him out and he still feels a little shaken from his meeting with David earlier. He still doesn’t know what to do about it but he’ll sleep on it and see what he thinks tomorrow.
“Are you okay?” I ask, walking over to the pair.
He hums at the feeling – it’s relaxing.
Jimmy wanders into the kitchen with his sippy cup half full of milk. He looks up at Cas.
He’s sick. Sure, he can’t do the things he wants to and that’s annoying in general, but it’s okay. Feeling tired is okay. No one is forcing him to do anything.
“When do you think that’ll be…do you think?”
“That’s ridiculous. They’ll be killed before they get to the edge.”
“I did at the time because I woke up like that and didn’t know what to do with it, and it was an amazing experience. But then in the morning I was feeling really sick and horrible so I didn’t really give it another thought.”
imagine how happy he’d be if you died with him when he goes boom.”
When I get back to mom and Sam, they are talking but stop when I get in to the room.
“I know. I know.” Dean shakes his head, trying not to get too worked up and worried. He whispers comfort to Cas over and over and tries to avoid looking at the clock every five seconds. He swears that the time has been stuck at three for
“No daddy…no Dean…” Jimmy says, his lip wobbling.
“All in a panic?”
His mom raises an eyebrow at Cas. “Okay, I may have dipped his toes in a little too long…” he smiles sheepishly.
“Yeah, just…just be gentle. It’s all really sore.”
“This way, I will always be with you and you will be with me. You never have to be on your own ever again, and I just need you to know that,” I have to pause for a moment, the emotion making my voice crack, “I need you to know that I love you so fucking much, and I am never ever leaving again. You mean the world to me, and I’m always going to be there for you. I’m always going to care about you, and I’m always going to love you so much it hurts.”
That night, Dean, Cas and Jimmy all sleep in the big bed, tucked up in each other’s arms tightly. Now he’s fully moved in, Dean is part of the family. And honestly, he couldn’t be happier. Cas is okay, Jimmy is okay; his boys are okay. And that’s enough for him.
For some reason, Cas starts giggling into the kiss and I pull back smiling, “are you laughing?”
me. And he never told me why.” Cas says flatly, but Dean can sense the deeply-felt anger buried within his voice. Cas makes a noise of effort when he throws another stone, a little harder this time. “No one else knew why either. Gabe fought with him –
“I don’t see why not. We need to tell Castiel though.”
Cas isn’t hungry and Sam is sticking to a smoothie. I don’t care though, that’s their problem. I’m going to enjoy my breakfast.
When they pull away, Dean is still smiling but it fades a little when he sees the look in Cas’ eyes. Apparently Dean can read him like a book.
Once the door clicks shut, Dr. Clarke starts speaking, “I think you need to wait outside while I do this. The questions, I mean.”
“You’re not going to ask me to leave this time?” Cas asks surprisingly calmly.
I finally look into his eyes, my own still producing tears that won’t stop flowing down my face. They are doubly annoying because it reminds me of what just happened even more – not being able to control the flood barriers. Oh, why did I word it like that? I flush redder if at all possible.
Dean knew Cas trusted him and he never wanted that to change.
Blondie sees that he’s not a shifter or a vamp or a werewolf or whatever other supernatural
“I’m sorry you had to leave your food.” Cas mumbles quietly.
We sit quietly for a while longer until Cas gets a small tug on his line and the float bobs up and down on the still-looking water. He doesn’t notice and I point it out to him, “Cas, I think you got a nibbler buddy.”
"Apart from bald people." I point out.
cool. It’s like a freakin’ Hogwarts feast.
know, Dean. That you love him. That you value him. That he isn’t just a burden chained to you and Sam’s feet.”
“Mmm?” He turned his head and mumbled into the blanket by his head.
“You usually love driving, are you feeling okay?” Cas wonders.
“Has this just come on?” Dean wonders whether the shivering set it off. He strokes Cas’ hair, hoping it helps him keep calm.
“Cas, you didn’t tell me your brother is on a never-ending sugar rush.” Dean points out, smiling as he pulls Jimmy over to sit on his lap.
“So by that, you mean it was fucking expensive.” Gabe says. “May I?”
“It’s his choice, Dean. You
“I need a photo of you for my home screen. Smile, Cas. You look all pretty in the sun.” Dean held up his phone.
“Yeah, I can do that.” I nod so Dean strolls over and dumps a small pile of crumpled up clothes next to me.
“Cas.” Dean’s soft voice makes him jump. He hadn’t noticed him at the door.
. We were fucking loud last night and
“Sounds hot.”
“You can stay for a little longer if you want?” Cas asks – as unannounced as this visit was, he still wants to be kind to them.
“Maybe.”
“Never.”
We all walk out of the doors, chattering happily.
for it. It’d be well worth it.”
“I know, it’s just…can we really afford to do this?”
“Oh my! Boys, I’m so happy! Oh Cas, lovely to have you part of the family!” His mom seems ecstatic.
He does seem completely finished, and as I’m kneeling more or less behind him, I push lightly on Cas’ shoulder to guide him backwards so he can lean on me. He can relax like this and catch his breath.
After sitting quietly for a few minutes to let Cas recover, Sam uncaps the bottle and pours some of the water onto the washcloth to dampen it. He hands it to me before letting go of Cas and saying, “We should get his shirt off, then I’ll go get a plastic bag for it.”
“I know right. I even surprise myself sometimes.” Gabe says as he puts some frozen peas into the cart. He’s lost in thought for a good while before he finally speaks again. “Cas, about that thing I wanted to talk to you about…”
Cas shakes his head. He meets Dean’s eyes. “No, it’s…it’s for the best.”
She reaches into a gift bag and hands him a square-shaped package. It’s about the same size as the angel/demon tablet.
“It really isn’t what it looks like, Sam.” I mutter and he rolls his eyes.
with a hiss because he’s being loud.
“The doc said that he probably passed out because of a combination of low blood sugar and him panicking about the stairs.” Gabe adds.
“Yeah. Close. Just need to wait for Michael.” Dean watched Jo roll her eyes. No one liked Michael all that much. He was too up tight and the employees didn’t like that (obviously). A fair manager was a good manager, just like Dean. “Good luck.” He smiled.
that she is telling the truth; that she
There seems to be another bag with the new things Jimmy bought inside, so he lifts that with one hand and holds Jimmy’s hand with the other.
“That’s a good then. You ready?” She tilted her head. He nodded, looking at his phone. He started a voice recording just so, if he did happen to talk to Dean about all of this, he could refer back to this session. He wanted Dean to know everything that Angela knew, and the recording may fill in some gaps that he could miss when telling Dean.
“Cas, I heard you gasp. Nightmare?”
The angel laughs and glances at the both of us before her smile disappears, “wait, you guys are serious? You
Cas melted a little at the endearing pet name of which Dean didn’t use often. When Dean used words like that, Cas knew he was going to say something, well, not
“Wanna go sit down?”
“This wasn’t too long before you met Dean, right? Correct me if I’m wrong, but you got the night shift job at the coffee shop to fit around Naomi? I’m guessing the deal was that you did night shifts so you could look after your siblings during the day?”
Cas turns away from the mirror and starts off the shower, brushing his teeth while the water warms up before stepping inside and letting the hot water wash over him. It’s comforting beyond comprehension, just the feeling of it running down his back and into his hair.
. But having Cas in in his arms, knowing he’s bringing some calm to him, is something he loves to do.
I pull the angel closer to me so his face is pressed against my chest. He lets it all out, crying and crying and crying. It just doesn’t stop. He’s having an absolute meltdown.
The angel steps back and looks at me in disbelief, “dad doesn’t care, Castiel. He never did! Everyone else saw that, but not you, Castiel. He hates all of us which is why he created those earth mites. He hates me, he hates you, he hated Gabriel, he hated Uriel, Michael, Zachariah, even Hannah, shall I keep going? He’s ditched all of us for Amara-“
you around, Cas. Because I like you and you mean a hell of a lot more to me than you think.”
Dean shakes his head in annoyance. Arrogant bastard.
“He’s at his apartment packing remember?” He ruffles Jimmy’s hair. “Then we’re meeting him at his mom’s house so we can celebrate him coming to live with us.”
“Fuck Cas, you’re a loud one aren’t you?” I laugh, feeling a blob of hot precome drop on to my hand from Cas.
“I’m sorry, ok!” He cries.
“Hey.” He calls to her, keeping his voice on the lower side of volume. “It’s okay, you can come in.”
Jimmy looks up from playing with Husky in the kitchen when he hears bangs coming from the stairs. He flinches at every bang until they just stop. Was it daddy?
Dean returns the kiss for a moment. “I love you.”
After tending to all of the cuts I can see, I move on to Castiel’s wrists. They are red and dented from where the metal was pressing into them. The skin is inflamed and sore, so I guess cream is the best option for those. I pull out the cream for his wrists and grab his left hand, rubbing the cream in with my other hand.
“Nope. You?”
“…yeah.” He admitted. “When I got home she was waiting up because I got back a little bit late. I only stopped to get a bottle of water from the corner shop thing. I was thirsty.” Cas shrugged. He didn’t meet Dean’s eyes.
“You alright Cas?” Sam asks.
“Did you see it?” I ask him when he opens his eyes and looks around.
going to be my
“No, don’t do anything. It’s a distraction – look!” Harien points towards the tree line and Dean feels a rush of slight panic roll through him when hundreds of supernatural beings crack through the vegetation and start charging towards them. “They let us climb this hill, they’re going to surround us!”
“Hi Dean, nice to meet you.” Alfie gives Dean a bro hug with a shoulder pat.
you done? I know you hug and kiss and stuff, but is there anything else? I know it’s personal, but I just want to see if Dean is thinking things through properly.”
“But…why…why won’t he wake up?” He cries out, taking the phone with him into the corner.
. Jimmy falling towards the bottom of the stairs, him not being able to do anything about it-
I pick it up carefully and go back to Cas, “hold out your arms, dude.”
“Now,” the officer starts, gesturing to the body, “there is obviously the evidence of the stab wound you saw yesterday along with the burns, but we found that this guy’s insides, they were completely obliterated. They’re practically mushed together, so whoever did this went to pretty drastic measures to make him suffer.”
It all just goes black.
“Yeah. Thanks Dean.” He gives a small smile before wandering off to the bathroom, all done just a minute later.
“I know what you mean. You’re right, it’ll feel good to tell someone.”
Mickey nods before standing up and flinging his arms around while explaining what he saw:  “I saw him. Like, he appeared out of nowhere then looked confused! Then these other two guys appeared and were like
“I’ll get Jimmy into bed, you can go get ready if you want.” Cas says as he toes his shoes off next to the door.
Dean stood in the doorway in amusement, waiting for Cas to realise he was there. A minute or so passed before Cas glanced up from above his laptop and jumped, placing his hand on his chest. “Fuck me.” He gasped in surprise so clearly Dean’s presence was unexpected.
I lift my arm up to the angel’s back, moving it up and down. “Buddy.” I whisper and Cas just snuggles closer to me, his head now in the crook of my neck and his hair brushing across my face. “We gotta get up.”
“If you didn’t book out one of the cabins, where are you staying?” Cas wonders as he watches Jimmy climbing all over his brother, giggling.
When he re-emerges from the en-suite, he sees Dean roll his eyes, a smile plastered on his face.
“Cas…you don’t have to be around her anymore alright? You never have to see her again if you don’t want to. Being here, that’s a big step in the right direction. I can help you get back on your feet. Like, how about I come to the doctors with you, hmm? You can get something to help you sleep then we can sit down and look at some college courses – a nearby one so you can still live here.”
Cas gets into the driver’s seat and pulls into the road, just thinking and thinking and thinking about everything.
They sat quiet for a while longer until Dean’s ass got sore from sitting on the wooden bench so long. “Wanna walk around?”
“I, uhm. I-I don’t know.” the angel admits, flushing red and looking miserable.
“Slow.” I scold, and Cas shoots me a glare but I know he knows I’m right. He really will make himself more ill than he needs to be if he drinks too quick.
“Oh, so you were one of those kids that did all the extracurricular stuff? That sounds like Sam.” I laugh.
“You really hurt him Dean.”
“Oh my god.” I mutter.
“Yeah. She helped me process it.” He explains, pushing the shopping cart absentmindedly. He’s starting to get tired. “I’ve never topped Dean before.” He just comes out and says it. “Y’know, because of some stuff I had in my head about what happened with Greg, but now…I think I’m ready.”
much for having us.” I smile and the sheriff encloses me and Cas both in a hug.
“Crap.” Cas shrugged.
Cas shakes his head. “It’s okay. It’s nice to be out. Fresh air.”
I walk to the door and step outside, leaning against the wall while breathing in the cool night air. Letting my head roll back and hit the wall, I take a deep breath, thinking of my friend. My eyes close as I try to keep myself calm.
“A- about something I heard. That Luke said...” Jimmy explains.
“You’ll get the hang of it.” Sam laughs, “practice makes perfect right?”
“I’ll be fine.” He assures. I suppose he
“I’m sorry if it upset you, or…” he started but Dean pulled him close and wrapped his arm further across Cas’ back.
“Because you are.” Dean smiles and places a hand on Cas’ shoulder, leaning down the side of him to kiss his cheek. Cas turns his head to make it a proper kiss. They only break apart when the doors open.
After last night, it took me and Cas a really long time to get out of bed. He’s still recovering from his illness and I’m just tired out of my mind. We didn’t speak about the actual
Dean can’t help but laugh, trying to do it as quietly as possible. “I love you.”
Jimmy sits down on the floor cross-legged with Cas and the assistant slowly places the kitten on Jimmy’s lap.
“We still have a bunch of stuff to get yet.” Cas sighs. “I’m gonna go to sleep when we get home. Ugh.”
Dean nods with a smile. “Alright. Love ya.”
The angels scream at people to keep moving, and some do fall over. They manage to scramble back to their feet though and not stop the flow of people moving across the bottom of the hill. That is, until Dean feels Cas jerk where he’s supporting him across his back. Cas yells in pain and his legs buckle underneath him. His feet slip as he falls, leaving him in a heap on the floor.
“Don’t worry, okay? It was just an accident. Accidents happen.” Dean assures, patting my shoulder while his other hand rubs my back soothingly.
what your puke face looks like. I could have easily dodged it but I didn’t want to. There was no way I was letting go of you. No way.” Dean shrugs with a reassuring smile. He urges Cas to stand from the bed so they can get his pants off.
“Yeah.”
Gasping, he stumbles away, crying and trying not to look at daddy until he reaches the kitchen.
I try not to laugh at the terror on his face, but a few chuckles creep out of my mouth and the angel glares at me. “What? I’m sorry, it’s just really funny seeing an angel of the lord try to ice skate.”
“I’d love that.” Cas’ dad nods before returning his attention to Nicky.
I search through the contacts of my phone and send the picture to Cas, captioning  it with ‘Sleeping Beauty’.
Cas blushes at the mention of the shotgun thing and smiles shyly to himself, “yeah, I am.”
But yeah, this is it! Hope you enjoy it.
“I think we might have a night in tonight, right Cas? Jimmy’s tired and we could use a quiet evening.”
“Why not.” I state, sinking further into the cushions.
I reach down again, touching him until I feel his sac start to tighten.
“And your boxers.” Dean instructs.
Dean knows when he starts to get it just right when Castiel’s grip tightens on his hair, pulling it a little. He probably doesn’t even know he’s doing it since when Dean glances up, his eyes are closed – scrunched up even – and he’s
“Th-” his voice breaks slightly. “Through here.” Dean calls back, and soon a man and a woman appear through the doorway.
He is drawn from his thoughts when he feels his phone buzzing in his pocket. He would ignore it, but it could be Gabe calling about Jimmy.
“I’m so glad. How was your drive down?”
“Hi guys.” Alfie and Daniel walk up to them. “Look what we taught Jimmy.”
.” I cringe through my teeth, not wanting my brother to get too much information about what we did that one time behind closed doors.
“Okay daddy.” Jimmy rests his head on Cas’ shoulder, drinking his milk.
I know I switch between Dean and Cas' POV a lot. Sorry if it's confusing :3
“Tell him I’ll see him tomorrow? And know knows, I might end up calling you guys later anyway to talk about tomorrow and I can speak to him then.”
“Thank you.” Cas said. He didn’t know how he’d be able to thank Dean for everything else he’s done for him. If he was honest, he didn’t realise Dean cared that much.
He didn’t reply. What if Dean thought he was trouble, knowing that he got kicked out of his own house, and turned him away? He couldn’t manage the pain of that. It was like his mind was spiraling out of control with
“Dean, do you want this, I don’t think I can eat any more.” Cas asks, gesturing to the burger in his lap that he has long since stopped eating.
“You didn’t consent and you told him to stop touching you, right.  You also said it didn't feel good? Would you mind telling me a bit about that?”
“Okay, you’re on.” He laughs. “Just to mention, he hasn’t been eating a lot so maybe do a smaller portion.”
“I can’t believe we went so long without being together.” The angel thinks aloud. “It feels like it would be impossible to separate us now we’ve finally come to terms with our feelings.”
“Promise you’ll drive home safe?” Cas looks up at him with those blue eyes. “Don’t road rage or speed or anything.” He pleads.
“So not too boring then?”
“Fine.” Gabe chuckles, swatting Cas back.
Dean frowns in question. Robyn answers this time.
“Did you really just try that? Really? That’s the oldest trick in the book! I’m almost tempted to kill you
Dean grabs Cas’ arm to help him out from under the table. “Thanks Dean.” He says as he dusts himself down in his chair.
“Oh, but you do, Cas. If anything, it’s
This is really happening. Just yesterday, he would have never thought this would happen.
could draw something, eat food then call it quits.” He chuckles.
“Don’t understand what?”
– Dean thinks it’s kinda cute. And nevertheless, human or angel, Dean finds Cas’ innocent honesty endearing too. Turns out Cas’ entire existence is endearing.
I listen to his soft breathing for a while until he turns his head and kisses the corner of my mouth. I move my head around too so we can meet properly and our lips press together, starting a gentle kiss in the moonlight.
“That’s good to hear. Is he asleep?” Mom points at Jimmy.
“Be quiet and walk.” The voice commands. “And don’t even think of trying anything unless you want to join all of those bodies back there.” She says, pressing the shotgun harder against him, urging him to move forwards.
The angel looks at me confusedly, but sits down anyway.
“Cas.” He says hoarsely. His throat is sore from shouting for the last hour of fighting. “Cas, wake up.” Dean shoves him a few times, taking the time to look at his surroundings. Lucifer’s army is gone;
“Well that sounds like a lot of fun, sweetheart.” Cas smiles and strokes Jimmy’s hair, looking across the room. “Go on then, I think Jack’s waiting for you.” He points at the other little boy.
“Sam, I found Cas’ cell. S’ bollocked up though.”
“Yeah?” Gabe looks up at him with curious hazel eyes.
Cas also couldn’t believe that this was
Dean helps Jimmy into his coat. “Do you need the bathroom before we go, bud?”
“You want to?” Dean whispers, shifting a little causing their dicks to rub against each other. Cas closes his eyes briefly at the feeling then opens them again to look at Dean.
Dean listened to the birds, watching a family of geese kamikaze into the water from of the ledges of the lake that people fished from. The rustling of the trees reminded him he was really here. Cas was really here. And this was
“There haven’t been any more strange murders. Did you get to the bottom of the case you were working on before?” She questions, picking up some paperwork from her desk and straightening it out.
“Anywhere but here.” The angel admits, his voice raw and grating.
After this, people begin to get bored of the game and go their separate ways to do their own thing. Some of them go to get leftovers before they are cleaned up and some go to check on the kids watching the movie.
Gus looks like he’s well built – a strong fighter – and he seems to be keeping his light brown hair ship shape and in good condition despite the conditions of this place. “Yeah, his name rings a bell.” Dean nods, looking at the other person. “Who’s that?”
The angel points to Cas first, and Roan next. “You, go back to your room. And you, get yourself together or there will be consequences. Rat.” The angel grabs Roan’s arm and drags him away back to the correct side of the room.
“Dean.” His breaths are becoming more shallow.
Dean picks it up and slings it over his arm with his own. “Give this to me instead of the floor next time bud, okay?” He asks.
“Are you coming Mr. Winchester?”
The paper rustles as I unfold it and stare at the printed words i.e. Cas’ pain.
“We’re excited too.” Dean agrees. He feels Cas nod where his head is resting on his shoulder.
“You keepin’ that tonight?” He smiles softly at the boy who nods, reaching back over for the milk.
“Mom can you sort Jack out, some older kids pushed past them and split them up and Jimmy’s ran off somewhere.” Gabe explains to his mom, urging Jack over to his grandma.
“Alright. Cas, can you hear me?” Paula asks, placing a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“Moving on.” Bartholomew rolls his eyes at his younger brothers. “It’s Michael and Cas next.”
Dean returns with some water and kneels next to the bed, handing the pills and the glass to him.
and raining out there. He could have
At least five minutes pass as Dean watches a continuous line of people marching down the corridor, prepared for battle. He’s about to give up searching for Cas when he hears shouting inside one of the rooms in the corridor. Of course! Cas might be…he might be with the angels.
“Hmm.” Cas hums, reaching down to touch Dean’s dick. It’s warm, a little moist, and heavy. He smiles, gently playing with the tip which draws a deep sigh from Dean.
“Please elaborate.” Cas insisted, but Dean shook his head.
“I-I’m kissing you, Cas.” He mutters before pressing his lips against mine softly. I freeze up at the beginning, but discover I quite like the feeling. I kiss back unsurely but soon warm up to it. I can taste remnants of coke on his lips as we share the moment. We just stand there for a while until Dean breaks the kiss slowly. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.” He mutters, placing a few kisses to my neck before backing away from me. “We should get in the car.”
.” I laugh and he chuckles as well. “But Cas?”
“Thirty two!” Alfie announces once again.
“Look, I’m just saying. I know you’re doing everything to help him right now, but
“Anything.” He broke out. He felt dizzy.
“Daddy!” He shouts. Why isn’t he waking up?! “Daddy? Daddy!”
“I owed
He feels like his heart is slowly expanding the longer this goes on, just feeling the warmth of Cas so close to him and that fruity smell that smells kinda like blackberries. The feel of Castiel’s soft, warm lips against his own just feels
with stupid empty promises. I guess I just stuck with it because I was striving for her to so much as look at me like she was proud but…she never did.
It only ever happened when Cas had a shift when Dean wasn’t there. Sometimes it just fell that way. Dean had night shift A with Jo and Garth, the other barista, and then Cas had night shift B with Michael and Charlie.
My lips find their way to his left nipple, and I run my tongue along the hardened nub making the angel whimper softly at the good feeling. He groans again when I move on to his right nipple, a deep rumble in his chest that vibrates along to where my mouth is.
“Dad, has something happened?”
“Yeah, we got straight in the car. I forgot to set the alarm so we slept over and had to get ready fast.”
for the whole way, he reaches their house quicker than usual, pulling up in the drive with a screech of wheels. Looks like he’s got here before the ambulance. It probably won’t be long now.
We stay like this for a while until Cas pulls back for air. He tilts his head to the side and nuzzles against my neck, seeming kind of sleepy. I bury my face in his hair for a moment and place another gentle kiss to his temple before closing my eyes and drifting into a peaceful sleep.
twitch in Dean’s mouth and come starts to spurt out of him. Cas moans filthily into the pillow, aware that Dean is repeatedly swallowing around him.
“Sure, we’d love to.” Cas watches Nina pull out her phone.
“Cas, you just lost me five bucks!” He laughs as he carefully crawls off the mat in an attempt to not make anyone else fall.
.” He says with finality, and she laughs happily.
“It’s okay, I think everyone thinks that. Especially Michael and Bartholomew.” Cas laughs with Dean, going into the bathroom but leaving the door open so they can carry on speaking. “This is for future reference, yeah? You listening?”
“He’s so mortified about it.” I shake my head.
Dean looks away. The moment is gone.
“I haven’t either, although I did come close when I had an odd obsession with hamburgers while being affected by famine.” He tries to say through a yawn that could be strongly associated with one of a kitten.
“Aw, he’s completely gone.” Anna smiles. “Bless him.”
“Look, just talk to him
They both say in unison which makes the two of them share an amused few moments.

“Hey there, Cas.” Jody greets as the angel looks around the table at our friends who, in his eyes, have just randomly appeared from nowhere.
seen her cry. Never
Luke gives him a smile. “Do you want to play with us?” He points at all the other kids at the smaller table, all talking and chatting amongst each other. Jack is there too.
“…not exactly. When I had sex with April, she was the one that uh-that-well, she did all the-the touching.” I admit, rubbing my neck, embarrassed. “Do you need to be with another person to be able to successfully ‘touch yourself’?”
“So, the man that was with you hurt you with penetration as well with no consent. Did he perform any preparation before doing this?”
“Hot, fast sex outside? Like I said, sounds hot.”
Cas manages to make eye contact with Dean and gesture to the bathroom. His boyfriend nods and smiles at Jimmy reassuringly as well.
Dean has been watching them. Cas makes eye contact with him and mouths
Jimmy nods, gaze downcast.
“The medieval humans truly had the best torture methods, I mean, look at you.”
“Alright Cas, I think you should think about getting ready for bed.” I decide, sitting up from my slouching position before draining the last of my beer.
Cas dips his head to the side “okay yeah, it might have been a good idea to stay closer but still. Just don’t worry about it. It’s okay.” He reassures, placing a hand on Gabe’s shoulder. “Looking after kids is hard. Even if you rule out everything you think could go wrong, shit still goes wrong.” Cas jokes and Gabe smiles at that.
“And that means it doesn’t matter? Cas,
Yeah, none of this behaviour stuff was going on when all of this first happened, but like I said, we think it’s part of the healing process.
Anna snorts and starts laughing at Gabe.
“Well, if any people I ‘lay’” he says, making quote marks with his fingers, “turn out to be like April, I’d rather not go through the trouble.”
He locked the door and dumped his bag on the couch, not bothering to stay up and watch TV. He fancied just curling up next to Cas in bed and trying to go to sleep.
Charlie nods enthusiastically, “totally yeah!”
Cas shakes his head. “No, it’s okay. I won’t be long.” He nods to Dean before wandering into the bathroom.
“Let’s not walk backwards anymore, huh?” Dean suggested, amusement tickling his voice now. He couldn’t help but chuckle to himself.
bliss. This confirms one thing. I just hit his prostate.
carton of milk in that time, let alone
gas station!
“I’m cold all over, really.” The angel shrugs.
“The food’s here. Eat something and then you can go back to sleep, yeah?” He murmurs. Jimmy twists to look at the food.
Dean’s mom points at Cas. “Feel free to boss Dean around. Make sure you get your money’s worth.”
Cas’ voice may be unsteady and tired, but his words are sure.
Cas presses his hand against his mouth and Dean watches him take a few steps back before heading to the bathrooms they walked past not too far away.
“Yes they do.” Cas smiles, exchanging a fond look with his brother.
“Oh great, the Winchesters need my help
hard to get this right. This one little thing right.
“Don’t fall or your dad will have my head.”
“Did you hear the words? About how if someone tries to get you down, you just turn around and ignore them?”
“As you can see, Anna enjoys embarrassing us.” Gabe joins the conversation.
Alex is cool, I like her. Jody’s done a good job of looking after her and bringing her out of her shell.
“There’s an arcade close by...” Dean admits with a smirk. Cas rolls his eyes.
“About everything.”
Cas smiles and leans forward, pushing his mouth against mine. My fingers find the back of his head and lace through his hair, pulling him closer to me.
“What’s his name?”
“Here. You have pine needles in your hair.” She tells Cas and starts picking the green spikes out of Cas’ thick tufts of hair.
I'm going on holiday again, but there should be wifi, so I will do my best to update :)
All of the adults are crammed around the coffee table in the living room. Cas and Dean were lucky to get seats on the couch. Dean fingers are locked with Cas’ who is still a little uncomfortable from getting sick, but he’s all right. Dean runs his thumb across the back of Cas’ hand.
