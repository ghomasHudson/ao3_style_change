“Of course. As if anything can stop me from coming home to you, Tony. I’ll fight death herself if she stands in my way. I won’t let anyone or anything come between us right now. Especially now that I know that there’s a high chance that my feelings are reciprocated.”  That made Tony flush. He was thankful that they were hugging or else Steve would have seen his red face.
The span between the village and the base is roughly 30 kilometers, too close for their comfort and liking. With the camouflage setting in the place, the jet landed in between the two locations. A sort of safety precaution. It was around noon when they set off to work. The Clint and Bucky had went to do some surveilling while Scott, Vision and Wanda went to check the nearby area. Sam stayed behind on the jet to serve as their eye on the sky while Steve and Natasha (who’s the only one who can speak Italian) went off to the town to talk to the mayor, An hour later, they regrouped. The grim looks on everyone’s faces were an indication that they all had come up to the same conclusion. The base is active.
“How did you mess your arm up?” Was Tony’s attempt to jumpstart a conversation. The genius frowned when the super-soldier grunted before he started flexing his fingers as if wanting to hold or well, choke something.
“Yeah. I was on an engineering binge. I couldn’t really risk losing my momentum by leaving. Anyways, did anything interesting happen while I was gone?” He asked, trying to make his voice sound casual. He avoided eye contact by heading towards the coffee machine and kept himself busy by pressing buttons and checking the counter for snacks. He was too distracted to notice Sam following him.
“JOCASTA? Can you display the visuals from Red Wing’s camera?” Sam had sent out his drone to serve as their eye in the sky. This way, he could see the base from an aerial point of view.
“H-He did. Wow. I didn’t think he’d..” Scott trailed off, not knowing how to finish his line of thought.
The Rogues had no idea what to expect, certainly not this. They were all in disbelief hearing the announcement the genius had made.
That was what greeted them when they entered the Council Room. Inside was the Rogue Avengers, huddled together on one corner of the room, and the Dora Milaje who were more scattered. Upon entering, both sides settled with staring at each other. It took every bit of courage Tony has to meet his former team’s gazes. His breath hitched every time his eyes jumps from one person to another. Sam. Clint. Scott. Wanda. Natasha. His stomach dropped when his gaze landed on Barnes.
“But this is not a field of your mastery. You truly are a genius and wise man, Son of Stark, but this goes beyond even your understanding. Though, you are correct. Thanos can be defeated. But he is a Titan which should not be brushed off lightly. Their kind is powerful, almost that of a God. What more, only special kind of weapons can harm a Titan. Storm breaker may affect him but it is not quite enough to vanquish him. He truly is a foe that is difficult to best. There are very few stories of Titans being defeated and overpowered, unfortunately not all of them are true.” Tony sighed. He can’t let this go on. While he knew that Thor had a point, it was no use to dampen everyone’s spirit like this. While the engineer disagree wholeheartedly with Thor, he can still empathize with the demigod. Thor just lost his home. His birthplace. Now, his people are looking at him to accomplish such a difficult task. He must be truly disheartened.
“Ah, what do we have here? The great Avengers? Being overwhelmed by mere HYDRA Agents?” The agents had parted like the red sea as one man walked towards them. Bucky and Steve growled as the other Avengers’ displayed varied degrees of surprise.
Everything was going fine but the team can’t help but feel like they’re missing something. Or rather, someone. They didn’t know how much they rely on both Iron Man and Tony Stark until they were gone. Sam and Rhodey were great aerial support but they weren’t as intuitive and resourceful as Iron Man. They can’t compute contingencies or make on-the-spot decisions like the genius do. They rely on Steve to give orders and follow them blindly without question. Steve is dismayed at that. He has enough soldiers as it is. What he needs is a co-captain. It wasn’t official but that was how he always treated Stark. As a co-captain. Their previous missions were successful mostly due to Iron Man’s input and suggestions. That’s probably why the Avengers weren’t as efficient and effective as they were before. They lost their other leader. They lost Iron Man.
” That caused the archer to snicker, delighted that he had managed to catch the genius completely off guard. The billionaire can only glare at the former agent as he placed a hand over his reactor, a defense mechanism that he started to develop again after the Bucky scene last week.
The billionaire opened his mouth to spit a snarky remark when he was cut off by a loud clapping sounds of an aircraft. They all looked towards the nearing jet.
“They’re at the Palace right now with my brother.” The Princess of Wakanda offered him a sympathetic smile. T’Challa knew of what had actually gone down in Siberia. He was the only one who knows the full story. Tony hadn’t told anyone, not even Rhodey or Pepper. Judging by the pitying look the princess had given him, Tony bets that she knows too. It wouldn’t surprise the billionaire if the king told her what went down there, seeing how close they are. That, or she somehow figured it out herself. She is also a genius after all. Other than the siblings, only he, Steve and Barnes knew.
"Tony's right. If we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts." Bruce commented, also deep in thought.
“Anyway, as I was saying, I am officially resigning as Iron Man. I don’t have a successor which means if you see any Iron Man knock offs around, I have nothing to do with them. Better sic the authorities on them.” The crowd did let out a few laughs at his words.
“Clint’s right, though. I don’t think any of us could have called this. Are you both sure you’re on your right mind and not under any kind of influence? Say, magical?” The decorated military man and Colonel asked, crossing his arms as he looked at his best friend and Captain suspiciously.
The Avengers were too busy dealing with the agents that they almost failed to notice the Sokovian was preparing to retreat. They only realized when a small jet seemingly appear out of thin air, most probably in stealth mode. Zemo and about three or four of his men boarded the jet and took off. Steve saw the aircraft before it suspended and made a break to it. He run towards it but was slowed down when the jet used its gun to fire at the super soldier. Steve was forced to dodge and take cover, giving the jet ample time to create more distance between them.
Hill, to Tony’s surprise, also gave him the shovel talk. He received an email from SHIELD, containing a standard list of tech they need from him.  After the fall of the Helicarrier in Triskelion, the remnants of SHIELD went underground. Fury was more far stricter in selecting his agents this time around. While Tony’s listed as an official Avenger, he still fulfills his role as their consultant.
Tony stood in his place for about three minutes, staring in space. Not moving, afraid even to breathe. His face has gone snow white and his hands trembled. He was kind of surprised that he could still stand since he felt like his knees were jello. When it seemed he wasn’t moving, FRIDAY called out to him.
“I’m sorry, Cap. I know he used to be your ex-boyfriend and all but you agree with me!” The national icon spluttered at his teammate’s choice of word. He could feel the warmth climbing to his face.
“Boss, the Vision, Spiderman and the Colonel are already assembled at the Common Room. They are inquiring on what is happening.” That made the genius stop in his tracks. He took a deep breath as he tried to relax his breathing and frantic heartbeat. Inhale Exhale. Inhale Exhale. A minute later, he stood up and saved all his works.
“That is still the coolest thing like EVER.” The teenage hero exclaimed as they walked through the portal Dr. Strange has created with magic. Beside him, Tony just rolled his eyes in fond exasperation while Rhodes snorted amusedly. Meanwhile, Vision floated just right after them, his face was void with any kind of emotion. The current Sorcerer Supreme and a master of the Mystic Arts, Wong, trailed behind them. They stood at the edge of the technologically advance African Kingdom, just by the forest where they have the perfect view of the capital city. They weren’t even in the city yet but Tony already has goosebumps. Annie would lose her mind with jealousy if she find out where he is. That girl is crazy with architecture and seeing the majestic buildings even from this far is enough for Tony to confirm that Wakanda was indeed the very definition of Annabeth’s candy land. He’ll be dead if she finds out about this. Scratch that. Annabeth wasn’t the only one who’ll kill him if they find out where he is and who’s he going to meet. The rest of the seven will have his head for being a damn idiot but what can he do? The sake of the world comes first.
And that’s why I left you behind. Loki and Osbourne are of the same special breed that have a reason for everything they do, and not usually a good one. For all we know this is all part of some giant distraction. I’m not leaving the city undefended. And I’m not leaving Loki unsupervised. Watch him closely, okay? And whatever you do, don’t let Ultron get into the Avengers mainframe.
Don't worry, Aunt May will be on photo duty. She seems pretty excited that I'm going to a dance for once. She even helped Pepper pick out a dress, and by help I mean argue about which colour suited me better. I didn't go with the red and gold one, just in case you told Pepper to recommend it. That is a bit too flashy for me. I went with blue instead, blue suits me :P
I'm gonna guess you aren't happy I didn't let you come straight home, but I thought it better you get checked out at the hospital first. I don't exactly trust that the prison gave you the best medical care available and you were in pretty bad shape.
You should be careful out there. I know most normal humans can't hurt you, but I don't think even you can stand up to an angry mob, especially when knowing you, you wouldn't fight back.
From what we can tell, you only really lost control to 'Venom' when you found your aunt collapsed. According to lady-Loki, you thought she was dead, lost it and went off on a bit of a rampage while (s)he waited for the ambulance. Venom apparently tossed a few cars through store windows and stuff, wreaked some havoc. There were probably some bumps and bruises amongst quite a lot of the public, but I don't think anyone died. I got there and managed to pin it down before it went too far.
None of the Hydra bases in this country survived. There were hardly any anyway, and Shield made sure any buildings were bulldozed. If there are any left, Shield doesn't know about them. You've probably already worked that out, but it probably took hours of lab work instead of the seconds it would have taken if I'd been there to tell you, if, you know, I wasn't IN CANADA.
So what happened with the guy this morning? You really did a number on him from the sounds of it. Pro tip for having an identity out in the open- don't do anything that could get you arrested. Sued, sure, go for it; I can pay those off fine. I currently have the biggest record for a court pay out (of course :P) but surprisingly, after that, it's Clint. Things just seem to get destroyed when he's in the field. I swear Shield spends half their budget on repaying damages after his missions.
Wait, if you appear in all the run-up to the referendum with your hair like that, won't it defeat the object of it being it disguise? Speaking of, guess who got invited to go speak at New York University? I guess Candice liked my answer to her question more than yours. :P
My mom wasn’t really around much- the lot of the boarding school child, I’m afraid. Did you get on with yours?
Don't worry...I wasn't planning on saying anything to Harry..or anyone. I'm in high school, if I said something like that without proof I'd be known as a liar until I graduated...
Florida is not too hot, New York is too cold. You know, I have a beach house out that way if you want it?
Sorry, I was pissed at Cap, not you. Or more precisely Cap was pissed at me and wouldn’t explain why. He’ll still go off buddying up with you though. He can really be an asshole when he wants to be, and he is really bad at playing the piano. Just so you know.
So do you know exactly where he was hiding in my house? Because I do tend to use my bedroom for stuff like, for example, GETTING DRESSED!
“This has always been about doing the right thing. Superhumans on both sides of the debate began fighting because they felt strongly about registration, and I know all of them still do. But when we start forgetting what we're here for, things get dangerous. I believe this act is worth fighting, but I don't believe it was worth the death of a good man and friend. It will never be worth that. Handing myself in is an act of good faith in the hope of restoring peace.”
I don't give a damn about being Captain America anymore. I'm not too interested in representing a country I don't agree with. Let them find some other spokesperson to do it, because I'm out.
I still say you'd be safer here. Especially if Loki is still hanging round you like a bad smell. He was damn right to think we wouldn't have trusted him, and we still wouldn't now. Even if, for the sake of argument, we say everything he told you was true, it's not exactly a shining example of virtue, is it? For one thing, he was only interested in saving you and didn't give a crap about the twins, and for another, he put his personal glory and shot at being the hero ahead of keeping you safe. Maybe you need to remind Aunt May that this guy was squatting in your house whilst on the run and was reading and editing your letters. Not to mention the whole destroying-New-York thing that everyone seems so happy to forget. And yet it's me May doesn't trust. Right.
Honestly, I knew he was in two minds from the start. He was in favour of there being more accountability, I knew that. But he also had a reason for having a secret identity, you know. He's just a kid. Do you have any idea how many people will be after him now? After his friends, his family? Did you want to see another school get blown up? Because that's what's going to happen.
It is too hot to do anything fun. I'll probably just go hang out round Lucy's and play video games or something.
P.S. I'd like to hang out with you not in a suit, but lets wait until you actually want to. Not just when you want me to do something.
And it is different to a gun register! People go out and buy a gun. For whatever reason, they want to have one; maybe they want to have it to hurt someone. People with powers (usually) didn't ask and couldn't get rid of them if they wanted to. You might call it 'a little loss of privacy' but for some people their privacy is their only hope of a normal life.
Okay, first, if I’m old enough to be their dad than Steve is old enough to be their granddad. Great granddad even. He was born in 1917, he’s almost a hundred. Just saying.
You don't like it? Sorry, I guess I should have checked first. I was just so mad I went ahead and did it.
I don’t know who Spiderman is, but I can guarantee he is not as cool as me. So good choice, nice to know you have some common sense.
You can't just send your lawyers away! I didn't send them to get you off on a technicality, I sent them to make sure you aren't given a harsher punishment just so they could make an example of you! I'm sending them back.
You don't know Loki is involved. He might have just gone to track Osbourne down himself while I was out...
Until you are back!? When is that going to be? I thought this would just be till morning! You know you are basically keeping us prisoner right?
Jarvis can handle it. All he really needs to do is put a play list together and order some drinks and snacks. Nothing he can’t manage. But thanks.
Even Spiderman came to see me. He said he wanted me to know he didn't believe it. I appreciate the support, but to be honest I would rather if he wanted to support me he hadn't pulled that stunt for you.
One more thing. If I was a proper dad and not just a biological one, I’d tell you to go to Xavier’s School. I’d want you to be safe, because losing you would probably be the worst thing I could imagine.
Fine, then I’ll get Loki out of the school. I’ll show up as Iron Man if I have to. In the meantime, take a couple of sick days, okay? Call it a compromise. Just do not not not get a crush on him. I don’t care what he looks like, don’t let it undo the killed hundreds of people thing.
Third, Eugene is coming to your party. He’s the entertainment, ie. I am going to get in the armour and drag his face along the rock. Then I’m going to climb two hundred feet and drop him in the ocean. Asshole. One day you’ll make in an hour what he makes in a month.
HECK does Loki even have your phone number?! When I get home you and me are going to have serious words about the proper use of a Stark Phone. Also, according to Thor, they don’t work on Asgard. So you know, the god of lies is probably lying. What a shock.
in the Tower. Because, you know, it’s not like it’s my Tower and I get to choose who stays in the guest suite or anything. He’s just been looking for reasons to be mad lately. You know I said he was being an asshole? Well, he was kind of in a mood because I didn’t tell him about you being my kid/being Spiderman, even though it’s none of his business. I hope it’s okay that I told him before now, but you were the one who said I shouldn’t lie after the cancer thing.
Well, maybe they think I'll need someone to help me break out now because I have two broken legs and can't walk? (Although I'm healing nicely and much faster than anyone else would, so maybe they think I'm going to be better before the trial ends). Or maybe because they know you're on my side now and want to at least try and stop you from helping me.
'Women for easy sex'? Did you seriously just write that? Do you maybe want to re-phrase that in a way that doesn't make you sounds like a misogynistic prick? Bearing in mind you, you know, SLEPT WITH MY MOTHER!
P.S. It occurs to me now that Cap may have put two and two together. You’d be worried too if you thought a terminal cancer kid was out playing superhero, right?
This is ridiculous! Since when has anyone cared what Beetle has to say?! I've hit that bitch twice as hard as you ever had and she deserved it!
Last week, lead psychologist Norman Skyers changed the way we view the Cap/Iron Woman split when he revealed the secret body language between the two suggested this fight was less about politics than it was about procreation. Now, however, a colleague in the field brings a different perspective to the table.
At least there was another new girl I could stick with, and helped me shake off my more persistant fans. Hey name is Lucy and she seems pretty cool. She lives on the same street as Aunt May and me so hopefully we can be friends and I can hang out at hers. Things between me and Aunt May are a little...strained right now. I think some space might be good for both of us.
Look, I don’t really get what you want from me. If you want me to be a dad, it’s better we get that hurt out of the way fast. It isn’t going to happen. It will never happen. Whatever father figure you have, (s)he’ll be way better than I ever would be or could be. My best advice is take the money and run. Trust me, you’ll like me better if you never meet me, and I won’t have to deal with the guilt of messing you up. It’s win/win, right?
As much as I want to have a secret tryst with you, it would kind of undermine the point of me moving out in the first place. So we have to make absolutely sure no-one finds out :P
Bacon tastes better off a Bunsen burner. Fact. And like I know what kitchen appliances I own. I’m not even totally sure where my kitchen is.
And for the record although there are some people who think it is someone at the school, they are still looking at the guys so no one suspects me. There are those who think I called Spiderman and asked him to come help, since I take his photo all the time, and guess what? That has put me square on Loki's radar. He hadn't even noticed me before, being that I'm in high school and my breasts are about two cups smaller than most of the girls, but now? Guess who showed up at my locker?
I tried to say it was before you knew me, but she says that it doesn't matter, because I always admired you growing up anyway, and that you 'showing off as Ironman' has made a generation of kids want to take stupid risks to be a hero like you.
Not being able to pull off the phrase ‘don’t be jelly’ is not a question of you not being cool enough, it’s a question of you being too smart. (That said, I can totally pull it off and am now saying it to Steve all the time. It drives him crazy and it is hilarious.)
P.S. You know I don’t mind if people find out you’re my daughter, right? I just know you might mind them finding out I’m your dad.
Please note that misuse of or false claims upon the charity’s money are considered fraudulent and are subject to criminal investigation.
You know I could just come tell you all this in person, since you are obviously still awake up there :P
I tried to talk to Harry, but he seems pretty mad about his Dad being arrested. I don't get why he is mad at me when it was his Dad who is the bad guy! We've taken him home anyway, so we'll see what happens now I guess...
The shutters are totally necessary, that’s what lockdown means. And do you really think I’d use something as flimsy as plain old steel? :P Give me some credit. You’re staying there and you’re staying safe until we get back. I’ve sent half the Iron Legion back your way just in case Loki and/or Osbourne tries anything.
He promised to keep it a secret and I know what you are gonna say 'oh he did such a great job of that last time', but I explained to him that telling anyone could put everyone in the school in danger and he seemed to get it.
P.S. I may not be a dad but hey, if you ever need money/favours hit me up. I have assets coming out of my ass :P
Lucy is cool. She is really pretty and has a quick wit, and she isn't a bad influence! Can't I have one friend that you actually like?
You know I'd come home if I could, but I need to keep them safe too. We have to think about what sort of world we want our children to grow up in, and I can't in good conscience let them grow up in a world where superhumans are branded and controlled like some sort of dangerous animal. I have to see this through to the end, so they can grow up free and without fear.
You know it isn't fair to leave me behind when I totally stopped your evil robot from hurting Dr Cho. I could help and you know it!
I told him there wasn't a problem, so that seemed to make him feel better. Plus he gave me a hug, which was nice ~~
Well, the debate was interesting, wasn't it? Thanks for standing up for me. I mean it though, I would never hurt you. Couldn't if I wanted to, wouldn't ever want to. And you got us back on track ruthlessly fast. That article a few weeks ago wasn't wrong, you know. You are hot when you argue passionately about something.
You’re the kind of person that invites strangers into your home for a glass of water, aren’t you? Listen, I’m sure Spiderman is a stand-up guy that is hero-ing for all the right reasons, but until we know for sure don’t rely on him. I tried talking to him again yesterday, but he ran off and disappeared. Seems kind of suspicious that he’d try to hide if he isn’t doing anything wrong.
So it's possible, just possible, that I may have been interrupted last night while I was doing the update. And then it's just possible that I went to the circus and in the process forgot to post the last chapter of yesterday's section. My apologies.
Natalia is on my side (though she is claiming I stole her hair style. Please my hair is like 3 shades lighter than hers!) and so are the Fantastic Four since Johnny was attacked.
I will be Ironwoman again once the baby is born, and i'll do it like i've always done. With my face out there, accepting complete responsibility for all my actions!
What? That isn't fair! All my friends go to Midtown, I'm not transferring just to run away from Loki!!
Have you seen this? It's beyond ridiculous. Let me know if you want me to make a statement or something. What a joke.
We asked Laura to elaborate on what exactly she thought these tensions were, and the answer was simple- Natasha Stark is a challenge to the traditional male dominance of the husband. Not only is she the main bread-winner, but she kept her own name after her marriage, something that simply wouldn't have been done in the 1930s and 1940s. 'What we have here,' Laura summarised, 'Is a man trying to find his place in the modern world, and reclaim the position and power he feels his wife has taken from him by keeping her own name.'
I was going to go and say my piece but the comments have already turned into a flame war. At least the feminists have my back.
So you've seen Spiderman under that thing? And here I thought we were fighting over whether or not heroes should be allowed to keep their identity secret :P
As for Mr Osbourn? Well he doesn't have a whole alien army, nor does he know I'm Spiderman, so i'm pretty confident I could take him if he tried to attack me.
Me and James are gonna head back to the States, so we can come visit you...if you'd like. I can send James with someone else if you don't want to see me right now....
I’m gonna guess you have some questions, so I’ll save us both some time and say yes, I’m technically what you’d call bi, but I’d lean more towards gay. Women for easy sex, men for meaningful sex and relationships, if you want specifics. Steve Rogers, on the other hand, is the definition of bi in all its rainbow-coloured forms. He says love is love and the rest is (ACTUAL QUOTE) ‘just a matter of what goes where’.
Anyway, we just have one more base to go according to Cap, so it should only be another couple of days, tops. Sit tight, Spidey.
And you are doing it again! Acting like it was all me! You are the one who threatened to steal him! So yeah, maybe I didn't much feel like talking to you about how hard I was finding being alone!
However, if inside sources in the court are to be believed, Rogers is likely indeed to be proven 'very, very guilty'; as on top of the existing charges for which he was standing trial, he is now wanted for escaping imprisonment- an action that carries a minimum of a fifteen year sentence purely on it's own. Jennifer Walters, lawyer to much of the superhuman population and hero 'She Hulk' in her own right, gave us the following blunt statement:
And how dare you criticize me for needing a break, you self righteous bastard. I left him with someone I could trust, or at least I someone I thought I could.
So... having just looked at how little of this story there actually is left, I have decided that the last few chapters will be posted tomorrow and Monday as we run down to the end. Please stick with us until we're through! :)
As for the clone, let's go to Shield and shut it down once and for all. Let's go together and get it done. We owe that to Thor.
I trust the matter is now closed. However, if you have any further questions regarding the contents of this letter or other legal implications, please do not hesitate to contact myself. Enquiries of non-legal nature should be directed to Ms Pepper Potts, personal assistant to Mr Stark.
I don't know what I'll spend the money you gave me on...I've never really had money before. I guess I could do with a new camera, but that's about it.
I'm sorry, really. I wanted to come home too, and I was planning to; I really was, whatever the result was. But you have to understand, a lot of people aren't able to comply with this act. There's a lot of heroes out there that are freaking out right now and they're coming to me to see what they should do. This is bigger than the two of us, I can't just leave them. They need someone to look to.
There. I explained all my personal business to my teenage kid. I even used caps because you seem to like them so much. Are you happy now? Will you stop with the silent treatment? Or are you going to keep on judging me for having consensual, good spirited, light hearted sex with a woman just because she turned out to be your mother?
I asked him why he didn't just go get The Avengers, and he said that he wasn't sure you'd trust him. He thought if he got me out first, you'd trust him when he told you the location of the Twins, plus he'd 'get to play the hero for once'.
You are gonna be mad. You are going to be really mad, but you know what? I don't care! Cause i'm mad! I'm mad at you! For being so...pig headed and putting your feelings on this stupid act above your family again and again! You could just register, but nooo Captain America doesn't back down! Well you know what you aren't Captain America any more, you are Steve Rogers and you have a son to think about! So no, you don't get to stay in jail and be the martyr.
“The worst thing about this super-separation is the unbearable sexual tension. Half the time I wasn't sure if they were going to tear into each other's politics or just tear off their clothes!”
Fine. I'll smile and be polite if it gets me outta here, but I'm not saying sorry! I was out there helping people! She is acting like I was doing drugs or something.
Nattie... Captain America is supposed to stand for democracy and justice. I guess I haven't done a very good job of representing democracy lately, but justice I can still do. You have to let this run its course naturally, without trying to sway juries or get fancy lawyers. If I haven't done anything wrong, I won't be convicted. We have to try to believe that.
P.S. My dad never apologised to me. On the rare, rare occasion he felt guilty, he just bought me something. So I guess what I’m trying to say is sorry. If I need to apologise for trying to do something nice for you, then I’m sorry.
So what is up with you? Is this the teenage rebel stage or something, because I have to tell you, most people start on that earlier than 17. Are you an emo now? Because honestly they kind of weird me out.
Well now we're having to hold Harry prisoner or he's going to reveal who you are. At least on Asgard he could have free range. Now we're keeping him on a Shield base and no-one feels comfortable with it, but what else can we do? If he gets out, I don't think he'll tell the papers Osbourne was imprisoned for being the Green Goblin, somehow. Plus, you know, no-one will hear our side of things if some kid comes out saying we kept him to stop him from talking. Even Steve is saying this is corrupt. So yeah, if I were you, I'd go to Florida, change your name, and lie low for a while because the proverbial is about to hit the fan.
Look, I guess if I'm honest... I didn't like us having different last names. I understood your reasons for it, and they were way better than 'I want us to sound like a family', so I tried not to make anything out of it, but it bothered me a little. I never doubted your commitment or anything like that, so honestly wanting you to have my last name just made me feel petty. But you know, you said to me at the time I could take yours, I pretended I thought you were joking and, well, I guess there was more than a little pride involved. I should have just changed it when we first got married. I'm sorry I didn't. I love you, and I'm proud to take your name. Though realising I have the same name as your dad now is kind of uncomfortable and I wish you had never pointed it out, especially when I was trying to be romantic and all.
I've honestly never thought about myself being a Mother...and if you aren't here i'm not sure I can do it. Steve I can barely look after myself! What if I lose it because I'm working too much, or not eating enough. And what about drinking!? I'm basically an alcoholic, how am I going to last nine months without you knocking the bottle out of my hand!?
As for the dating part, I don't really know where I stand. Steve hasn't been right since Wanda messed with his head. I guess I'm worried if I ask him to talk about it, it'll just get worse again. But whatever, you don't want to hear about your old man's love life and/or lack thereof.
She is in Quarantine. Fury wants to keep her there until he can be sure all that...'Vemon' is out of her system. Bruce is on the team looking after her, he'll make sure they take care of her.
The end :) A little contrived, perhaps, but we were struggling to find time to work on it and figured some ending was better than none! I hope you enjoyed and thanks for reading :)
I'll come pick you up in a little while. I've moved most of our stuff in, but it is still in boxes. Un-packing can be your punishment for getting yourself put in prison.
You don't need to worry about me, either, you know Peter will always step in to babysit if I ask him. He's cheap, too; he usually just asks for $10, use of the TV and a peek into the basement-lab-of-doom if he promises not to touch anything. Besides, Jamie loves him.
If you or your legal representative have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
You probably shouldn't have done that to the police. You know I need to hand myself back in sooner rather than later, and that won't help my case.
Loki should never have left you alone with Harry. And, like I keep saying, for all we know this is all part of his plan. He's a liar, remember. He's good at it.
Well I'm pretty good at building things, I built my webshooters after all, and designed the web fluid.(I can't remember if I mentioned that my spider powers don't include the ability to shoot webs, I had to add that part myself.) But I guess over all I prefer Chemistry and Biology. I'll still take a look at MIT though, who knows I might like that place best whatever I take.
I'll ask her to talk to Captain America, maybe she can convince him she is alright on her own, or atleast get him to take a break and catch up on Disney films. It is sweet that he is worried about her, but he doesn't have to be. She has everything under control.
But I doubt you care about that right now, I think you are probably more concerned about why I didn't show up with the others at your little prison break.
School was horrible! Everyone saw the news and they were all whispering and pointing, or coming up to me and asking me stupid questions. I must have had 15 guys ask if they could try the suit, it was ridiculous! Half of them had never even spoken to me before, but now I'm 'rich' apparently everyone wants to be my friend. I spent most of the day hiding so I wouldn't have to talk to people.....
”  Steve’s voice cracked at that simple two syllable name. His tone was filled with so much emotion that it gave partway. He hadn’t seen the genius in 2 years. It’s even been longer since they last talked. Seeing the titanium gold alloy armor glistened under the sun as he stood before all of them was magnificent. It was breath taking. Steve could hardly breathe.
Steve wasn’t faring any better, health wise. He, like Wanda, was sporting a concussion. He was also within range of the second bomb. He has bruised ribs and a dislocated shoulder. Seeing as they were being overpowered, Steve hastily called for them to regroup.
“How did you escape?” The level headed Black Widow asked, her face shifting to a more neutral expression. Zemo let out a loud laugh.
"Just.. Listen, Tony. The big guy likes Steve so please don't hurt him? I don't know how he would take it if he's favorite Captain is hurt."
The former SHIELD agent had nothing to counter that so he settled with glaring instead. Tony had to fight the smug smile that was attempting to form on his lips.
” The red head demanded as she socked an agent that attempted to sneak up on her before kicking another one. All this without letting Barton slip from her grasp.
“Chill, man. You’re way too tense.” The spy snickered at his reaction, eyes lighting up with full mirth. Tony could only roll his eyes at the childish man. Though, he needed to do a double-take when he saw the archer in full gear, with his bow and arrow.
Steve knew that he was taking Zemo’s sudden appearance harder than he should. He personally hold a deep grudge on the Sokovian. He was the mind behind the bombing in Vienna which ultimately nailed his best friend and forced him out of hiding. He was also the reason why he and Tony had such a bad fall out.
“Mr. Stark.” The King of Wakanda greeted him with a small smile and a regal nod. He was standing before the entrance of the palace, wanting to welcome them personally.
“Okay, so it settles then. We’ll drive to the hospital while Vision, Lang and Wilson stays here till the UN comes. We’ll see you three back at the hospital when you’re done here. I’m pretty confident that you won’t get lose since the town isn’t really that big. Just find a big white building that says
Tony gave the bug themed hero a smile and wink before moving on to the two super soldier who stood straighter. Unlike his sure movements with the others, he was more hesitant and wary with the two of them. He approached the brunette first, his hands hovering over the metal arm as he silently asked permission to touch. When it was given, he wasted no time as he started inspecting it.
It wasn’t only Steve who heard the AI. It seems that she hacked everyone’s comm as they too reacted at the news. They all hesitated in their movements but seemed to catch on quickly, not wanting to give HYDRA the upper hand again.
“Why won’t he just evacuate the village? Isn’t that safer?” Sam asked which got a few mutters of agreement from the rest.
He can’t really face Barnes without risking a panic attack. His words kept on replaying on the genius’s head like a loop. He’s afraid that he’ll shut down or have a flashback at the mere sight of the super-soldier. That’s why he waited till he left the compound to leave his lab. It’s safer this way.
Tony sighed. Steve’s two best friends had already given him the talk. That’s probably the last of it. They had their fun. He could finally let his guard down.
"If we can't use them, how about we just destroy them? Thanos wouldn't be have a chance to get all 6 of them if 2 of them are destroyed, right?" Natasha asked which earned her noises of agreement.
The rest of the day continued on rather peacefully. Steve’s group returned to the jet two hours later with no new information. An hour later, the group of spies followed. Pretty much empty handed too. It turns out that the base is indeed one of HYDRA’s but was long ago abandoned judging by the collection of vines and moss that littered the base’s metal walls. The spies, seeing no threat, had entered the base and dug deep through their computers but found nothing valuable. They did, however, found something useful. Natasha noticed that one of the computers was less dusty and smudged than the rest. The screen was wiped, albeit not thoroughly as the edges still has a bit of dust. And there were a few keys on the keyboard that were undusted. This indicates that someone used it and recently too. There were other signs that says that there were people that came to the base not long ago. This just proves it. The lead wasn’t wrong. The base was, in fact, active a few days ago, which probably triggered the algorithm that the panel was talking about. They were just too late to catch them.
“You have 64 properties to your name, Boss. 48 are currently ready and are in working condition. Also, I find it notable to mention that you have two islands registered under your name.” That made the genius pause in his packing and raise an eyebrow.
"But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision." The Captain's voice penetrated throughout the room, his tone was firm. It was obvious that he does not agree.
“You also have a concussion, Missy. Go have a seat at the jeep. We’ll just finish up here.” The engineer said, patting her shoulder before moving to Vision who was behind her. Wanda was confused by the dismissal and instruction but followed nonetheless.
Tony and Rhodey was held back by T’Challa for a brief discussion about the Accords. It lasted for a couple of minutes. At the time they finished, the council room was mostly empty, aside from Steve who apparently stayed behind. This was how he caught up to them.
“They’re a bit antsy because it’s suspected HYDRA activity. They want us to destroy every and any chance they have of reforming again. They don’t want another SHIELD incident.” The red head explained. The super soldier hummed, accepting her answer since it does makes sense. He voiced as much.
“Clint, don’t aggravate Sam. He had his reasons to worry.” The tone Steve used made the archer slightly drop his smile as he realize the reason behind his teammate’s hovering. He gave Sam an apologetic grin which the former Air Force returned. Clint gave them both a mock salute before running towards the archery range to practice his shooting. Bucky was already there, giving it a go. Sam and Steve headed towards the mats to start sparing. On the left side of the gym, Wanda was with Vision as they practiced her control over her powers.
“Good. No. It’s great actually. No delays whatsoever. Not to mention the extra upgrades your tech guy added. Tell them thank you for me.” That got a soft and fond smile from the active soldier.
They weren’t star struck or anything. The expressions they all had on were pure disbelief, confusion and incredulity. The reality that Tony is really here after 3 years hasn’t really sunk in yet. Here, alive and helping. It was hard to believe.
“What? You’re going to kill me in my sleep? Choke me with your legs? Torture me to kingdom high? I’ve received plenty of threats in the past weeks. So, get on with it. I have a meeting in 2 hours.”
Tony was visibly hesitating. The way he was biting his lips and shifting his weight was clear indicators of that. The genius knew the right thing to do. He already decided that he’ll tell them. Though, it still is understandable that he’s nervous. He is about to reveal a huge secret. One that can change the course of the world.
“Under other circumstances, I wouldn’t question your intelligence, Son of Stark, as you had proven your wisdom time and time again.”
Hey, guys! I received positive reviews and comments for this story! I'm truly grateful to you all. I'll try my best to deliver a good story. Thank you, guys! Love you 3000!
“By Tony standing up for us by giving our side of the story? It would surely lessen the public scrutiny against us. We might even gain some of the public’s sympathy back.” Natasha commented, her brows furrowed together, an expression that she’s thinking deeply.
"Did you just seriously say hitherto undreamt of?" Tony attempted to joke though it fell kind of short after the heavy revelation. He did receive a single snort from Lang and one of the guardians, a man called Quill. He did get thrown a few glares from Clint and Wanda. And surprisingly, a rather amused look from Steve. He kind of expected the blond to reprimand him for not taking things seriously but taking into account their earlier conversation... Yeah. He's not going there. Tony can't afford to get distracted now. Especially not because of an insanely attractive bearded super soldier who is apparently in love with him.
But post-Afghanistan Tony? With everything that went down, he’s surprised that he hadn’t broken down yet. Sure he had more panic attacks in the past week compared to the past year combine. But that’s to be expected, right? He’s so fucked up that just couldn’t take a
As all hope seem to have been lost, a miracle came just in the nick of time. Small missiles came out of nowhere and started taking out multiple agents at the same time. Everyone snapped their heads up towards the sky and like a falling star, the Iron Man whipped past them all and landed in his trademark kneeling landing.
“It’s only been 2 weeks since you were released from medical. Are you sure you’re up for training already?” The former pararescuer asked, a frown visible on his face as he inspected his fellow bird themed friend for any sign of discomfort. The full time Avengers, san Rhodey and Natasha, were gathered at the Compound’s gymnasium. They were all gearing up for another training session.
From an outsider’s point of view, he looked bone tired. With his dark bags and slouch posture. However, for those who personally knew the billionaire, they can tell that there is something wrong. That there is something more going on. He
“Heritage Stories? Tones..? What? What’s happening? What are they saying?” was Rhodey’s question as he stood up and slowly walked towards Tony. He eyed the two Asgardians cautiously, leaning towards his best friend as if gearing to jump in front of him at the first sign of attack.
Vision and Wanda guarded each other’s back as they eliminated as much agents as they could. Sam was circling them from above, calling out warnings as he shot down the enemies who got too close. Barnes, Natasha and Clint were a force of their own as the three assassins danced around each other with grace that would make any dancer envious. Scott was ant size and disabling weapons here and there. Iron Man and Steve were back to back as they always were during previous missions.
“As I said earlier, I am not answering questions. Those who refuses to respect that shall be escorted outside. These guys aren’t just for show. They have a job which I must say, does pay generously.” The genius gestured to the four men stationed below the stage. They were the standard looking bodyguards. Bulky, huge, black suit, shades and ear piece.
btw, the village is made up. At least the name is. Riscoprire simply means 'rediscover' in Italian (according to google translate that is). Sorry this took a while! Got caught up with life and other things! I can't promise that I will be able to update regularly but I will do my best!
“I believe the messenger is expecting an immediate reply, Boss.” The genius let out a shaky breath as he typed out a haste reply.
"We don't really know how many stones Thanos currently have. The space stone is the only one we’re sure of. It is possible that he acquired a few more already. Also, we don't really want to play with these stones. They're not created to be wielded by any human." Bruce said waringly.
“The better question is when, to be honest. I escaped that prison about two weeks ago. My break out was long planned and orchestrated. It was hard but being one of HYDRA’s top agent, I was given the proper resources for my escape. I’m essential for our comeback, after all. They can’t have me staying in that jail for too long.” Both SHIELD agents gave each other side glances, easily realizing that they were thinking the same thing. Gather Intel and information as much as possible.
“The fall of SHIELD did a number on us, as expected. It lured out most of our sponsors, plants and protectors. We needed to hide back in the shadows and regroup.” It baffled the Avengers. SHIELD fell 4 years ago. That means almost 4 years of preparation.
“Where is he, FRIDAY? Is he o-okay? Is Tony h-hurt?!” The super soldier, panic started rising as he struggled to keep his focus.
An hour later, Rhodey and Natasha entered the gym as Steve and Sam were just finishing up their sparring. Sam was sweating heavily as he slumped down on the mat while Steve was, of course, still unruffled. There were no clear signs of exhaustion as he made his way towards the benches to grab a drink. He gave the two a smile and a nod as he saw them approach.
“Oh, right. You weren’t in a relationship with Stark. But you were pining after him.” At Clint’s words, the super soldier groaned.
The tech guys provided by the government were good but not as creative or brilliant as Tony Stark. The genius always knew what the team needed, no question asked. He always did give them the best toys and gadgets. While the tech the government provide them were good, they were below in terms of quality as they were used to.
“Yes. Now stop hovering, you worrywart. You are worse than Cap, I swear. Doc already released me for fieldwork yesterday.” The archer snorted as he warmed up, stretching his over rested muscles. The mentioned super soldier rolled his eyes at the implication.
"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki.. The attack on New York? That was him." That made the original Avengers, minus Bruce and Thor, rear back. They didn't once thought that the God of Mischief had someone like him on his side. They didn't think that he would play pawn for someone else's game.
He kept his eyes on the city lights and focused on his breathing. It was slowly beginning to get harder and harder for him to even get air in as he tried everything in his body to look normal and functioning for Steve. Steve had pushed himself off the railing and walked towards Tony to investigate why he was breathing so loud.
"Since when did I get a therapist?" Tony remarked while getting out of bed and realizing that he was only wearing his boxer briefs. He reached into his closet to get a clean shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants.
"I'll take care of the bad guys. I'll just talk to them and make sure they understand not to mess with you." He said while walking into the kitchen and opening the refrigerator. Peter looked inside and saw all the different types of colorful foods and snacks to pick from. He hopped out of Tony's arm and landed on his feet gracefully. He saw a jug of milk and took it while turning back at Tony.
Stark began to worry about everyone back on earth. He wondered if his friends made the out alive; Banner, Thor, Rodgers, and Romanova. Although he wasn't quite on speaking terms with Rodgers he was still hoping that he made it out alive. Back at home, he was imagining Pepper watching the scenes on the news and seeing everyone turn into ash. God, she must be so worried for him and calling him. He wasn't sure if he turned off his phone or not, but his thought was interrupted by a soft voice speaking out.
Cold. From his fingertips to the broken-off iron suit everything was numbing cold. Red and golden painted metal scattered across the ground of Titan. Quill, Parker, Drax, Mantis, and Strange were just recovering from the intense battle between Thanos. To no avail, they could barely make a scratch on his face with every effort they made. Their best chance of winning was shattered to the ground after Quill lost control of himself after realized what happened to Gamora. Stark was quickly recovering from the wound Thanos left before leaving to retrieve the last Infinity Stone and was left sitting a few yards away from the guardian of one of the Infinity Stones. Strange was "meditating" with his eyes closed and refused to say another word to Stark. Quill knew that they had lost and was staring at the ground, a mixture of anger and dismay brewing deep within him. Parker, Drax, and Nebula were exchanging each other looks to silently confirm that what just happened was real and that they had lost.
"He's gonna pay for that. He's going to only wish he could die once he's done with me." Tony angrily said as he looked at the orange sky. His heart beating rhythmically and a new surge of energy flowing through his veins. Now wasn't the time to mourn any longer. It's now the time to act and make all of his friends proud.
"Kid I need you to stay awake. You could have a concussion or something serious. Do you know who you are and where you are?"
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault I wasn't looking and if I was I could've caught you. Pete why?" Tony asked.
"-Today you have an appointment at noon with the Secretary of State and a meeting with Karen at five.-"
Steve took a deep breath as he looked at Tony and knew he was on the brink of breaking down. He glanced behind himself and walked towards the door. As he walked towards the door he heard footsteps coming towards him and stopped to turn around to see who was coming for him. He saw no one behind him and started walking again. He heard the noise again and stopped walking to see who it was. He had his hand on the doorknob and felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around to see who it was and saw that it was Tony's hand. Before Steve was able to ask him why he's here, Tony hugged him from behind and tried his best to not cry. Steve froze in place and looked down at his hand that was on the doorknob. He slowly let go of it and held Tony's arms carefully. He didn't want to check his wrists to see any straight lines he didn't want to see.
Steve saw the mortified look on his face and remembered that was the exact same face he had before he smashed his shield against Tony's chest. All the pain Steve felt in his heart returned as he wanted to apologize to Tony. He wanted to comfort him and tell him that he regretted that fight. He wanted to tell him all of his regrets, but he was choked up. He finally gathered the strength to step closer to Tony.
"Mr.Stark please I don't want to go. Please." He cried in defeat. He let go of Tony and went numb. He didn't or couldn't move his body. Tony cautiously put him on the ground and held his hands to comfort him during this moment. He was at a loss of words on what to say to the kid and wanted to look strong for him, however, the drops of tears didn't help.
"Oh my god," Tony mumbled to himself as he ran his fingers through his hair and walked out the room. He didn't know where his glasses were but didn't mind it. All that was important was knowing where the hell he was and what happened while he was "out."
"Be careful. You might get your own superpowers if you look too closely at it." Pepper scoffed lightly at him and pushed his shoulder.
He woke up covered in sweat and blurry vision that wouldn't go away immediately. Tony shot himself on his feet and was ready to attack anyone he saw. He blinked rapidly to get rid of the blurry vision and saw Mantis on the ground with her antennas glowing faintly. She had a depressed look on her face and her skin looked more pale than usual. Tony wiped his face and could feel the ash all over himself. He wiped his forehead with his sleeve and sat back down next to Mantis with a deep and tired sigh. He looked at the ground then at her and cleared his throat in an attempt to break the ice. Mantis looked at him at the corner of her eyes and frowned.
He forgot who made it for him as he tried to depict images from the clouds. He forgot many small things as he watched the clouds, but the images and moments that happened years ago stuck onto him and would not shake off. How proud he was of himself before he was taught how to be humble and selfless for others. How he did not have to sacrifice himself for his city but did it anyway.
"While you boys are having breakfast, I'll be out working on the repairs to the building. Stay away from the balcony and don't touch any cracks." She said while leaving the room. The sound of her heels clicking against the floor echoed throughout the empty room and then slowly died out. Tony waited a few moments to make sure Pepper was gone and looked directly down at Peter. His big brown eyes looked back up at him and a smile cracked on Peter's face.
"Well," He said while taking out a black, ceramic bowl and metal spoon and put it on the table, next to the milk and cereal, "you better tell her that she's right. I tell Jarvis to print out special boxes that say that they're reduced sugar and with fewer marshmallows and temporarily change google whenever she asks about if it's real or not." He pulled up a chair for Peter to sit at and saw that he was too small to get on himself. He hoisted him up and pushed him in.
"Tony, there was no other way." He said as calm as he could manage before he turned to dust and beams one with the air. Nebula gave one look at Peter and Stark before realizing that she too was dissolving in thin air. Peter saw her turn into ash and felt tears build up in his eyes.  Stark could feel his chest and heart-pounding for not being able to ask what he meant by that. The memory hit him like a rock to the head; he remembered when Strange saw every possible outcome to see if they would win and it was one out of fourteen million. This could be their only shot at winning, but everything and everyone is crumbling away and so is their will to fight. All the disappearings could mean that Thanos snapped his fingers after taking the mind stone. There was no turning back now and half of the universe is gone because they couldn't keep Thanos away from the time and mind stone long enough.
Steve missed the contact he had with Tony and wished that he could hold onto the moment forever. He knew moments like these would only last for a minute and wanted to enjoy all of it. He wanted to apologize for all the arguments and fights they've had, but all those years of conflict were stuck on his lips and forever silent.
"No thanks, kid. I don't really like eating fermented milk. I'm more of a doughnut kind of guy. Hell, blueberries could work too in a pinch." He gave it one last look before closing it. "I'm not even hungry anymore."
"Who the hell is Karen?" Tony asked while sitting up and rubbing his chin. He blinked a few times to wake himself up and saw the view from Stark Towers. He moved his hand from his chin and scratched his chest. He stopped himself immediately and saw that the Arc Reactor was still in his chest and working normally.
"I'm sorry for scaring you, dad. It'll never happen again!" The final word that he said was like the last nail in the coffin.
"Don't make me go through that again. Just shut up and take my apology." Tony said before letting go of Steve.
"Tony giving you a hard time?" He asked without looking up. Steve nodded his head at him before sitting down next to him, careful not to bother him.
"I felt heartbreak when you first saw the kid. I felt lost when you were in your old house and how much you missed it. I felt defeat when you heard Jarvis' name and how friendly he was towards you."
"When I'm older, I'm gonna be just like you. Only less old- but you're still perfect!" Peter interjected himself loudly. Tony lifted Peter from the ground and held him with one arm. Tony ruffled Peter's hair and smiled weakly.
"Hey. Hey, c'mon, you're alright kid. Pete c'mon." Tony said in a hushed tone. Peter held onto Tony for dear life as he began breathing heavily and mumbling about not wanting to go. For a moment Tony didn't know what he was talking about until the puzzle pieces came together. He knew what Peter was talking about and held onto him tighter.
"Not as cool as your aunt. You just don't know it yet. And kid..." he felt his own smile fade away as he was beginning to chose his next words very carefully. "Stay in school."
"I didn't know you had allergies," Steve replied while copying Tony by leaning against the railing and took a deep breath with him, trying to be in sync with him.
"Are you sure? You're acting a bit... off." Steve said while shrugging his shoulders as if he was uncertain about his own suggestion.
Peter finished his bowl of cereal and put away the plate and spoon near the edge of the table to tell anyone that it was dirty and needed to be washed. He moved the box of cereal towards the pantry but paused halfway to grab a few marshmallows and quickly scarfed them down. He tried to shove the cereal box back where it was but he was too short. He looked back at Tony for help but saw him deep in his thoughts. He shrugged his shoulders and began to climb the pantry with one hand and the other carrying the box. He stopped where he could see the space where the box once was and attempted to put it back, but he lost his balance and fell on his back. The box of cereal was barely sitting where it once was when Peter shoved it away from him once he knew he lost his grip. Tony snapped out of thought and immediately went on his knees to check upon him. He pulled him up and put his hands on his cheeks to make sure that his face wasn't hurt. He then felt his body for any broken limbs and held up two fingers. Peter was on the brink of crying, but Tony wanted to make sure there wasn't any brain damage.
Tony scooted closer to Steve and put his trembling hand against his arm to silently tell him to stop talking. Steve slowly moved his hand on Tony's and rubbed it gently to make the shaking go away. Steve smiled softly at Tony to tell him that everything was alright. He smiled back at him and moved his hand away from Steve and pressed his shoulder close to Steve's. He could feel a little piece of him start to calm down, but something deep in his heart told him to get away from him and run. He ignored the feeling.
"So then why are you outside right now?" Steve asked without hesitation or emotion. Tony could feel the question reign down on him with fury as he tried to think up of another believable lie. He felt dirty lying to anyone. Even to his enemies.
The words "are you okay" rang throughout his mind like an alarm. Everything around him slowed down to a halt and gravity seemed to have gone off.  Tony felt as if he were floating in the middle of space and nothing was making sense. The scenery around him faded black slowly then all at once.
Tony saw the smile on Steve's face and saw the familiar twinkle he had in his eyes. He started to remember the same sparkling eyes in Siberia. Those same eyes were just the way they were right now but weren't filled with rage or pure emotion. The memory of all the punches he pulled on Steve and all the punches that Steve didn't pull started to flood back. He felt the familiar lump in his throat and swallowed hard to get rid of it but to no avail.
"Tony..." Steve stammered. He was terrified if Tony would attack him or have an attack. He wasn't sure if it was a panic attack or a heart attack, but wished it was neither.
"Tony I'm sorry." Steve pleaded. Tony turned around with a sigh and rubbed his eyes quickly before turning back around. His eyes were puffy and even more teary eyed than before, making Steve's heartache. "Please, Tony I'm sorry for Siberia. I'm sorry for what Bucky did. I'm sorry for what happened to Rhodey. I'm sorry for not standing with you. What else do you want from me?" He said the last sentence with more anger than he intended. His tone made Tony clench his jaw and stand firmly.
"You sure you feeling alright?" Steve urged while handing him the cup. Tony took a step closer to reach the cup and accidentally grazed his hand over Steve's. He remembered back when he cared about his touch and approval and smiled weakly at the thoughts of the past. He looked up at Steve and saw that he smiled back at him with a slightly bigger smile. He had the kind of smile that people would only see three times in their life. He wore the same goofy and innocent smile when the first met and before they fought in Siberia. Tony's smile crumbled the longer he looked at the smile and felt rage build up in his stomach. He snatched the cup from him and walked back indoors. Steve followed him behind like a puppy following their owner.
Peter poured himself a bowl of cereal and hungrily dug in. Tony was pretending to look in the fridge in search of something to eat, but he couldn't get a lingering thought out of his mind. He wasn't sure if this was real or not and if what happened after the attack near Stark Towers was real or not. He scratched his chin and saw a bottle of beer hiding between several suave bottles and a year-old supply of soy sauce packets. He reached out to grab it, but stopped himself and pulled his hand away.
Tony didn't know what to do or say after he clenched his fists and was ready to connect them with Steve's face. He stopped himself before he could do anything that would harm Steve and felt his hands shake as he stared back at him. He felt painful tears form in his eyes as he stared. He was frozen all over and couldn't put down his hands to relax.
Peter looked up at the sky and saw the orange hombre. He thought it would help him calm down, but it made him choke up. He missed watching the sunsets and watching the orange colors dance with the pink and dark blue clouds. All he could see was a single part of sunset and nothing to help him. He looked at Tony and saw him holding his hands as tight as possible and him holding back tears the best he could.
"Sir, if I may," Jarvis interrupted with a hesitant tone, "but I'm detecting elevated blood pressure and intense stress coming from you. You do know what could happen, right? Are you okay?"
"Hmm. Did you also see me dancing without any clothing or me making a big, metal... tube to tell Jarvis that he can go mess with himself?" He laughed softly.
"You like those?" Tony asked while grabbing it and put it on the table. Peter handed him the jug of milk and shook his head.
"No!" Tony's voice was sharp. He held venom in his voice as his eyes hardened. Steve nodded his head obediently as he held his hands behind his back. "You listen to me, Rodgers. You should have told me when you found out and none of this would have happened! You should have let me die back there instead of leaving me. I didn't want to fight you. I didn't know what to do or think when I realized you lied to me. Steve, you lied to me. That hurt more than the fight. Were you even pulling your punches back there? Did you really want to kill me or was it all self-defense?" Tony hissed. He held back his tears to not show how broken he was but his voice broke multiple times. Steve shook his head at the question and searched Tony's face for an answer.
"Tony," she started, "I'm sorry." She said while quickly putting her hand over his temples as her antennas started to glow again. He immediately closed his eyes without realizing what was happening and collapsed onto his side. Mantis kept her hand on his temple to feel what he was experiencing and to know when to wake him up.
"Yeah. And then he started breathing like his lungs were collapsing. He even freaked out about his drink."
"Were you pulling your punches or not?" Tony's voice broke before he lost his voice. He could barely say "your" without his voice cracking. Steve felt his heart shatter to a million pieces from how sad Tony sounded and looked.
Tony wakes up in his bed with a sharp and quick gasp. He hears Pepper talking with someone downstairs and congratulating them over something. He hears Jarvis's voice but can't make out what he said in the first sentence.
"Oh my God- Pepper?" He called out her name loudly. "Pepper please tell me you're alive!" He rushed down the sleek and metal stairs as fast as he could and saw Pepper talking to someone, but her body was covering whom she was talking to. She turned around and looked at Tony with wide eyes.
"I'm fine," Tony repeated with more assertion in his voice as he backed away from Steve again. This time he could feel his chest begin to physically hurt as he started to lose feeling in his knees. He hated himself for forcing himself to lean up against the railing and had to look away from Steve to play it off that he meant to lean up against the railing. He exhaled deeply and closed his eyes slowly to get a grip on how to breathe. He never allowed himself to do it in front of people, but this time he had to control his breathing or something worse could happen. He opened his eyes and slowly nodded at himself as he took a deep breath in through his nose.
Mantis was watching Tony from afar and decided to do something to help him calm down once he stomped his foot. She carefully approached him from the side and crouched down to make sure he was breathing. He moved his hands away from his face and covered his mouth and nose while staring at the ground after a solid minute of staying stationary.
"The things... you've seen. What you've done to yourself. How you are slowly dying from the inside out." She said between sobs.
"Huh." Tony sniffled and wiped his nose as he glanced down at the ground. "Not about the cereal part?"
Tony stood up from the ground and felt his back crack. He cracked his knuckles and looked off in the distance where Peter was once staring at. He remained silent when Mantis followed him and asked him where he was going. She held her own hand and stood behind him submissively. Tony could feel her presence behind him and he could not ignore her. He turned around and told her to come forward and to stand next to him. She looked confused but ready to follow orders no matter what.
Tony sat down on the couch next to Steve with a heavy sigh. Steve looked over at him and saw that he was rubbing his chin as he steadily looked down at the ground. He was leaning towards the floor and looked as if he was about to pass out.
"I felt sick and thought the fresh air would help me relax. I forgot about my allergies and didn't take the meds." He confessed while bowing his head down, feeling the lump in his throat again. He did know it would come and go whenever he felt one of his attacks coming. He was just thankful that it came after he was done talking.
"You know how to handle stuff like that? I should go because I don't know what he would do if he sees you again." Rhodey said while trying to sit back up.
"-What did I just say? Get out." He said haltingly, afraid of what he was about to say next. He knew that he was beginning to lose control over his words and his actions and wanted to stop, but the surge of emotions was overwhelming.
The lump in his throat felt to be the size of a softball but he forced out a singular word. "Stay." He finally croaked out.
Tony got up from his chair and leaned up against the railing to look directly down at the people below. He saw a handful of reporters chatting amongst themselves and the boom of civilian life and the sounds of commotion. He wondered what most did on their Friday nights off in the wonderful city of New York. At the corner of his right eye he saw the cup of tea and slowly reached for it without even looking. The cup nearly slipped in his grasp and he was lucky enough to have caught it and only spilled a quarter of tea on the floor. He looked around to see if anyone saw him and quickly kicked the puddle with the side of his shoe off the porch and onto the traffic below him. What's a little cold tea, he thought to himself as he was finally able to get rid of most of the mess. As he took a taste from his cup, he wasn't able to hear the screen door being slowly pushed open.
"What's your poison?" Tony asked while walking towards a pantry. He opened it and revealed a mixture of different types of cereal and chips to fill any heart's desires. Peter closed the refrigerator and walked to where Tony was and quickly scanned it. He pointed at the Lucky Charms and smiled.
"You could spend your entire life not having allergies and then boom. You randomly get them." Tony said while glancing at the city streets and the bright buildings. He didn't know where to look as he tried to form a believable lie to Steve.
His mind started to flood with god-awful memories back in Siberia. He could still feel the cold ground against his bruised back as he was being beaten down by Steve. He could still feel the vibrations after every punch throughout his armor and the rush of cold air when his faceplate was ripped off. The single part he wished he could forget was the final one to his chest. He thought he was going to die right then and there and wished he did. That was the only time in a battle did he ever close his eyes and shielded his face as he hoped that he would finally lose the fight.
**Warning** This story has an anxiety attack trigger warning and I'm sorry in advance if anyone of y'all are affected.
"Hey there," Steve said while glancing back at all the light the city had to offer. The buildings illuminated the night and everyone was beginning to come out of their homes to feel themselves tonight.
"I got it. Don't worry." Steve reassured him. He was terrified that the reason why he was wincing was because of his injury.
"I know. Give me it before it starts to freeze over and people start calling it 'Captain Tea.'" He insinuated.
Her tone made Parker and Drax worried for her and what she meant but something diverted their attention and thought. Quill reached out his hand and saw particles of himself fading off in the wind. His eyes widened at the sight and he tried to move his arm to see if it would help. Within seconds nearly his entire body was disappearing and he could only manage to say "oh man" before disappearing. And within three seconds Drax followed and was only able to share a look of sorrow at Mantis. Strange opened his eyes and saw the final particles of Drax disappearing. His blank expression twisted into a worried look as he turned to Stark. He kept his back straight and his eyes fixed on Starks.
"There might be some small bruising, but he's fine, sir. Please don't be so worried. He's alright." Tony pulled away from the hug and saw Peter stand up without any struggle. He dusted himself off and did a superhero pose with a toothy grin.
"That's an attack!" Rhodey slammed his book shut and tried to sit up, but winced at the numbing and tingling sensation he got in his legs from lying in an awkward position. Steve quickly sat up and gently pushed Rhodey back down to prevent him from moving too much.
"I'm sorry, dad." He looked back at the sky with wide eyes one final time before disappearing forever.
"Since yesterday. You know, with that attack with Loki. Should I brew you a cup of coffee for you?" Jarvis asked with full interest.
"I didn't want to kill you. I didn't mean anything I did. I lied to try to protect you, but look where that lead us. Tony, I'm so sorry for what happened in Siberia. I'm sorry for ever disrespecting you and thinking you were lower than me. I shouldn't have hit you with the shield. I shouldn't have fought back. Tony please. I'm sorry."
"Oh," Pepper said as she crouched down and put her hands on the child's shoulders and looked up at Tony, "this is Peter. You found him a few nights ago while you were fighting off Loki. You asked him where his parents were and then you took him. His aunt and uncle are more than willing to help out with anything and will visit as much as possible." She informed him.
"You don't remember what you did? You saved the earth by sending that missile to space and destroying everything. Even Loki agreed to destroy the tesseract and did it in front of everyone. You're even hosting a celebration party today. Don't you remember?"
"I used to sneak them in my room when  Dad wasn't looking and just stay up all night eating the entire box." Tony laughed softly.
"No no! Don't be. You're fine. Don't apologize for that. If anything it was my fault." Steve shot back as he talked with his hands.
Tony nodded at what he had to say and wanted to respond back, but a sudden and large lump in his throat prevented him from even swallowing his spit. He coughed into his arm once to clear his throat and shook his head.
"Did you hit your head that hard?" She asked dumbfounded. The figure behind her peaked a quick look at Tony before hiding behind Pepper again. All Tony could see was a small hand and took a step back in reaction.
"Did it make you feel better? I can help you go back inside if you need to. Do you have to take your meds?" Steve reassured him while slowly moved closer to Tony. He didn't know why he was moving closer to him but wanted to make sure that Tony knew that he was here for him.
"I felt excited when you heard that you were having a celebration party with all of your friends." She said.
From the corner of his eye, he saw a faint blue glow coming from Mantis' antennae and a frown on her face that quickly crumbled into a painful expression of heartbreak and loss. He knew what she was doing and held onto her hand to try to comfort her since he didn't know how. He looked at her eyes and saw them turn red as she started to cry. He decided enough was enough and pulled his hand away and began to think all of this was his fault.
"How about Wanda's magic? It came from the mind stone, right? Maybe it being from the same source, it'll have the correct properties and energy to break the stones." Tony was already halfway through his sentence when he realize that it was him speaking. He almost winced when every eyes turned towards him, calculating and considering looks on their faces. Though, he wanted to take it back when he saw the realization dawn on Wanda. Her eyes widened.
“I said initiate the blackout, FRIDAY. I swear to God, I will force you out of the lab’s system and initiate the protocol myself in a way that even you wouldn’t get in.”
"Honeybear! You missed me already? Isn't your next scheduled visit supposed to be next week? Wait. Is it next week already? Shit. Tell me i'm wrong, Rhodey. Tell me! Nana Rosa will have my head if I had the days mixed up again!" The military man chuckled at his best friend's rambling. He always did find the genius' tendency to drift continuously, mostly from one topic to another, endearing. Some would find it annoying but the Colonel always did listed it as one of his charms.
“What other ‘good’ reason is there aside from being a selfish prick?” The blond bit back. Natasha slapped the archer behind the head which made him grumble and glare.
“Wait. At least a week? That long? For a small technological mishap? Seriously, who are these tech guys the government’s providing you all?” The Colonel sounded surprised at that, his frown deepening as a more calculating look covered his face. Unlike the other Avengers, his suit is given weekly upgrades and checks by a more private sponsor. He always says along the lines of ‘someone from SI’ whenever one of the Avengers ask but they all knew it was a codename for ‘Tony Stark’ who, after his extremely controversial press conference months ago, had disappeared without a trace. Not just from the public, but from almost everyone else, with the exception of a handful of people of course.
Maybe that’s why his own best friends automatically took the side of his boyfriend without even asking him what’s going on. God. They didn’t even ask him how he was or if he was alright. They just didn’t
"If I'm up for it? Why, Platypus, it's almost as if you don't know me at all! Of course I'm up for it! Gimme!"
“The Sling Ring, while a powerful mystical object, has its limitation. I need to visualize a clear image of my destination. While I’ve been to Wakanda before, I hadn’t actually entered the capital.” Said the former surgeon as he shrugged at the annoyed look the genius threw at him.
During the rather short walk, he felt the others give him hesitant side glances. Now, being this near, they stopped trying to be subtle about it and settled with openly looking at him. They also stood a bit closer to him, as if wanting to trap him inside a protective circle. Normally, Tony would have berated them. He would have glared at them and tell them to fuck off. He doesn’t need to be coddled. But given the situation and circumstances, he felt himself relaxing. Tony was surprised when he found himself appreciating the closeness and security.
He wanted to listen to his team right now. He wanted to will himself to calm down and think more rationally because his impulsiveness and recklessness can very well sabotage not just the mission, but end up with someone getting even more hurt.
It’s not fine. In fact, everything’s falling apart. What’s worse? It only took a month for the whole thing to fall to pieces.
He was drinking and screaming during intervals. Good thing the lab was soundproof or else someone would have run down. Tony didn’t know what he'd do if that happened.
The silence in the workshop carried on for almost half an hour. It was uncomfortable and suffocating that Tony just wanted to squirm on his seat by the end of it. Bucky was just staring at him with a level of ferocity and sharpness that made the billionaire nervous and uncomfortable. The razor-sharp eyes traveled throughout his body, mostly lasting on his neck, arm and chest (or reactor as it sits on his chest and displayed through the hole of his shirt). When he finally screws the latch shut, Tony can’t help but feel relieved. He has nothing against the super soldier but the way he’s currently acting is making Tony incredibly restless.
“Brother. Finish your sentences for Odin’s sake. You sound like bumbling buffoon. So it seems that the Man of Iron is more than meets the eye. Get over it already. We have no time to sit down, hold hands and tell each other heritage stories. Thanos is coming and we have yet to form a concrete plan!” Loki interjected, though his voice lack any heat. While his statement was aimed to his brother, he was looking at Tony with interest and curiosity.
“Sam? You do know it’s not your fault, right?” The Colonel said, his eyes sympathetic. His words captured the whole room’s attention.
“Regardless, we need to continue. We’ll just have to try extra harder to protect the villagers.” Was Steve’s reply. The others nodded their assent.
“Come on, Honey bear! I’m seriously hurt! You think I don’t have the appeal to charm and seduce this super soldier’s pants off?” The billionaire said, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively as he dropped his hand from the blond’s waist to start playing with his waistband. Steve can only huff in amusement as he removed Tony’s hand from his pants, only to interlace their fingers together. The genius looked at their joined hands with slight shock before it melted into a soft smile.
“I guess it’s our fault for doubting Stark.” The former pararescue said, guilt present on his expression. In fact, every one of them felt the crippling sense of guilt. Even Clint who was bad mouthing the genius earlier looked properly chastened
“Hey, man. Are you okay? You’re a bit jumpy and not to mention pale.” Sam reached out to pat him on his shoulder but the genius let out an involuntary flinch which halted his movement. He was frowning deeply, his hand hovering in the air as he stared at Tony in confusion. They stared at each other for a minute longer. They only snapped out of it when the coffee machine beeped. Startled, Tony averted his eyes, took a clean mug from the counter, and poured his coffee.
The same day, at 1 pm, the Avengers going to the mission were assembled at the conference room of the Compound. They were on video call with the Accords Panel which consisted of the most eligible and competent world leader. The official members were decided through voting amongst the 123 nation leaders that had signed the Accords. The current panel is consisted of the presidents of US, Germany, Russia, Italy, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Korea and of course, Sokovia. They had not shown any acts of hostility nor unfairness towards them which made the Avengers content and satisfied. They always talked with a level of indifference and coolness but not in a way that would make them feel like a threat. The panel treated them like they would a soldier or part of military. That was enough for them.
Bucky was much more successful in fending off agents but he wasn’t on top shape either because in the midst of the battle, his metal arm started malfunctioning. It was letting out small sparks and was just mainly being a nuisance to the super soldier as it kept on lagging and hindering his movements. Bucky was seriously debating on whether he should just remove it. Scott was nowhere in sight, probably ant size and diving into their enemies’ weapons to mess them up. Vision, being an android and made of Vibranium, has no injury. But he is being overwhelmed by the number of agents that kept on attacking.
It surprised Steve. It caught him completely off guard. He was almost certain that Tony would be angry or at least indifferent with him after everything. Amused was not something he expected.
That was the name Bruce, Thor and surprisingly, Loki and another strange group calling themselves Guardians of the Galaxy, had given them. The ship that infiltrated the Wakandan borders contained hundreds of Asgardians, all seeking for a place to call home. From what little Thor had told them, Asgard is destroyed after Ragnarok was unleashed. The Prince refused to regale them the whole story as he didn't want to take too much of their time. He said he'll tell them after the threat is dealt with. The Asgardian Refugees were all now being settled in rooms that T'Challa had asked his people to prepare. It is agreed upon that the Asgardians will stay and help them fight if need to be. For the time being, Wakanda will provide them with everything they need till they find a place of their own. After that was settled, Bruce, Thor, Loki and the Guardians had joined them in the council room to further discuss the incoming threat. That's when his name was dropped.
Tony found out that Steve’s betrayal hurt far worse than having his godfather literally rip out his heart. The pain he experienced from Obie’s betrayal, the man who watched him grow up, paled in comparison to the suffering he felt from Steve’s. And that’s saying something.
“Bring what up? I hope it’s the part where I called you a beautiful lady because I will be deeply offended and hurt if it’s the part where I called myself little and old.” That did make the corners of her lips twitch a bit. Not actually a smile but Tony will consider that as a success. While he was internally celebrating, Natasha schooled back her cold expression. Even enforcing a harder stare.
“Of course, Mr. Wilson.” Came the monochrome female voice of the AI. The screen on Sam and Wanda’s right flickered on as the aerial view of the base was displayed.
“D-Did he just defended us?” Wanda asked, dumbfounded. Once again, the Rogues find themselves shocked.
“W-What?” That made Steve falter in his steps as he lost his momentum for a second. He was almost a second late from blocking a blow launched by a near agent. Steve grunted as he lifted his shield to intercept it before stroking it upwards to clock the man in the jaw.
“You should have seen your best friend, Barnes! He looked like a sad puppy trailing after Stark all the time! Steve also kept on ogling his ass whenever he enters the room! It was a wonder how Stark didn’t caught on.” The teasing was half-hearted, a way to somehow forget the gravity of the situation.
“And that’s it. Thanos is just a Titan. He’s no God. He cannot be killed but he sure as hell can be defeated.” That statement did help raise a bit of hope. Only little.
“Ahh, Robocop? Might want to loosen your grip there. I’m quite fond of that hand so if you could please-”
- anymore, right? He was devastated as he realized this. Now hearing that Tony is indeed coming? It ignited hope in him.
"So he already has one stone. But we have two right here with us, right? Doesn't that give us the clear advantage?" Rhodey asked. He was sitting on one of the plush chairs located on the room, his arms crossed as he gave everyone a grimace.
"There's no telling. He already has the power of the space stone. That already makes him the strongest creature in the universe. If he gets his hands on all 6 stones, Tony..."
“Nothing really. Just the usual.” The genius jumped a little when he heard the veteran’s voice near him. He immediately whisked around to face Sam, almost dropping the pack of blueberries in his hand. The African American frowned at the billionaire’s twitchy and wired-up reaction.
“In relation to the disbandment of the Avengers, I assure you. While the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are gone, there are still other heroes around that are more than capable of keeping the world safe. There’s the Fantastic Four and the X-Men. If there does come a time when a large global threat surpasses and threatens the safety of the world, the Avengers will return. How can I be so sure of that?” everyone leaned forward as Tony trailed off.
The genius sobbed out. The arm around him tightened even more as the mechanic let out another whimper.
“Well, have fun with being Fury’s errand boy.” The engineer snorted, his hands moving gracefully across the hologram. A few seconds later, he realized something and stopped to look at the archer.
“I know what you are all thinking. It’s the Accords. That the reason behind all of this is the Accords. I’m not going to deny that. While I support the Accords and its purpose, I don’t fully trust the people behind it. The Accords have potential. It talks about accountability and oversight which I believe in. What went wrong is the way it was rushed and implemented. The 796 paged manuscript was dropped on our lap by the Secretary himself, on our own home. We were given three days to go through all of that before it become an official law. Three days to read and decide. Sign or retire. We were trapped, our hands tied behind our backs. Metaphorically, of course.” That earned him a few laughs.
“That’s what I’m here for actually. Thank you for bringing it up.” Her voice was pure ice that he needed to suppress a shudder.
is he?” Natasha asked as she reached out to support the archer who was again swaying dangerously on his feet as his injury was slowly catching up.
“Cap! On your left!” Sam was in better shape than most of them. He was in the air and shouting out warnings on their comm.
“Wasn’t really asking for permission but seeing as you’re the one that’s going to be stuck with these bunch of wackos for a few days, I guess I’ll let it slide.” Both exchanged a laugh at that which made the two original Avengers roll their eyes.
Taking a deep breath, Steve let himself be pulled by Bucky. He gave his best friend a grateful nod. As he was trying to reign in his emotions, Zemo said something that finally snapped his last bit of control.
“Uhh, Tones? You did tell T’Challa that we’re coming. Right?” Rhodes asked, his tone held apprehension. At the implication, Peter let out a sound similar to a squeak.
“The base is certainly active. We’ve seen a few agents guarding the area.” Clint said, his face on a scowl.
“Shit. Cap. They blew up the jet.” Sam cursed on his comm while he maneuvered in the air as he dodged the bullets coming his way. The veteran swooped down as he started shooting at the stray agents who bombed the jet. He took them down easily. Hearing Sam’s announcement, a few of the Avengers let out their own curses as they struggled on their own fights.
“We already talked to the mayor. Turns out that the president of Italy already briefed him of the situation. He was already expecting us. He said he’ll keep the villagers from snooping around.” Natasha explained, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
During meetings like these, it wasn’t necessary for every member of the panel to attend. They are forced to attend, however, when the threat affects their own nation or those they are closely affiliated to. The ones that are required to attend are the US, Sokovia and Germany as they are the front runners of the Accords. For this meeting, the aforementioned leaders are joined by Italy and United Kingdom.
