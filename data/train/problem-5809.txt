“A strike means that I’ll remember how many times you behaved poorly and when there’s quite a bit tallied up…” Tony smirked evilly. “You won’t like the consequences.” He paused. “So what will it be then? You let me do what needs to be done or are you going to fight me?”
"Yes!" Steve said, which got him a ‘lovable shithead’. Steve pinched his plump ass in retaliation and swallowed the protests with his lips.
“Well, it’s nothing we have to worry about anyway,” Tony said drily, “Obie will undoubtedly have a car with dark windows to limit the exposure as much as he can.”
They sat in the bar until it started to close, then headed up to Steve’s room. If they played at hooking up, they could go to the car shop together in the morning.
The official’s wide eyes snapped from the badge to ID, to Steve’s face, to the papers and then finally to Tony where they stayed longer than strictly necessary. It was very clear that it was the most interesting thing that had happened to the woman in a very long time, but all her excitement turned into an abashed flush as soon as she laid her eyes on the omega. Inwardly, Steve scoffed, imagining the arrogantly rakish grin that Tony was undoubtedly wearing on his face. And apparently, it was working. Even betas seemed to fall under the O’s charms.
“I…” Shit. “I might’ve flushed them down the toilet at the airport," Steve finished relatively calmly, all things considered.
Sharply, he raised the crop and smacked it down over Steve’s left nipple. Steve jerked but didn’t make a sound. Right. Left, right. Fuck it felt good. Every time the crop landed, Steve flinched but a part of him was already starting to succumb to the pain again.
The local Midas (their runaway) would come in the next morning, so, as per plan, Steve checked in at the local inn. It would be smart to scout the place out, see what resources Stark might have.
He got out the back, locked the door and got behind the wheel. The drive to his secret hideaway in the woods wasn't long from here but Tony's nerves were making it feel longer. Three times Tony had to talk himself out of checking on his captive.
“Yes,” Kwazoffsky confirmed. “Mr. Stane needs all his people for another event this evening and possibly through the night, so we are taking you both to a safe house until then.”
Tony cupped Steve's face and caressed his cheek with his thumb. Steve was frowning, but other than that he looked calm. "Second, as you can already see - no clothes. I've removed them because covering up is a privilege but also not something that beautiful boys like you need. You shouldn't deprive other people of the pleasure of looking at you, especially me, okay?”
“I don’t know, I think he…” Tony trailed off for a moment. “I think Rhody is seeing someone already. Seems serious.”
Tony pursed his lips thoughtfully. “If we marry, Obie will never be able to do anything about it unless he sues you in civil court for kidnapping, but without my testimony, he’s got bupkis.”
“A million," the omega repeated. "You know who I am, so you know I can get it. That’s how you help me, okay?”
“You need some fresh air in here,” he said flatly, turning around and setting his feet towards the kitchen. “You coming?”
I rewrote some places like... a thousand times! Seriously. I really hope it didn't come off as sloppy work bc I make mistakes when I rewrite and nothing helps. But I did give it my best.
of money. More than Steve had ever gotten for any other job before. Mainly because even as the best bounty hunter this side of the pond, Steve Rogers, 29, a retired vet, never took on runaways. Finding rich omega runaways paid a lot more than catching criminals, even the most dangerous ones. Still, making the rare and precious behave wasn’t a service Steve generally offered. He was the last one to tell a person, an O or otherwise, what they should be doing with their lives. In this case, however, Steve was willing to make an exception. Everyone had seen the widely publicized ToTy romance and it was clear that the two men were smitten with each other. That Stark ended up being addicted to coke was unfortunate. He needed help.
“Oh come on, Steve! I’m not an idiot!” Tony pursed his lips while drumming his fingers on the kitchen table. “You’ll be charged with kidnapping. It’s a serious crime!”
Steve glared, but he was also blushing, so Tony counted that as a win. Smiling, he went on to get the cleaning rag.
Steve turned to Nat and smiled at her in a way that he hoped was flirtatious. “Seems like I might need to stick around. You gonna keep me company?”
“It's not about the money," Steve pressed through his teeth. He wasn't even lying, not anymore. Once Steve had a contract, he was loyal, he prided himself on it. He couldn't be bought, not for any price. "I can't go back on my contract," Steve explained. "Besides, how would you even get your money? Doesn't it go through your guardian?"
He pulled and squeezed at the poor boy’s scrotum and finally, finally, he got the plastic sheath on and locked. Good.
“So, so pretty,” he repeated, picking up the longer chains that were also fixed to the clamps. Humming from a slight dom high Tony played with the tiny pegs at the end of the chains. Steve’s eyes were trailing his movements with apprehension and feeling affection for his poor boy’s bewildered gaze, Tony showed him.
Steve made a small discontent noise, squirming a little as if trying to get free, so Tony put his palms on the man's shoulders and prepared for the worst.
Sighing, Tony rolled his eyes. “What are you even talking about? You were the one who confiscated my pills!”
He opened the cupboard and brought all the necessary equipment. It wasn't much — thankfully, the boy was already shaved so Tony simply needed to slick him up, slip the tight ring around the whole equipment and squeeze his balls tightly.
“Not your fault,” the O said, turning in an uncannily clever maneuver that put him directly next to the tool cupboard. “You’d fool any other mechanic out there. Told you, I’m the best.”
Steve cleared his throat. It was abundantly clear now that whatever he thought he’d smelt last night had been relatively weak because of the scent dampeners that were still lingering in the O’s system.
“You think I’ll escape from a plane somehow?” Tony asked with a sigh. “Take a pilot hostage?” He raised his cuffed hands and an eyebrow.
Steve was trying to pull away from the tight grip, the noise of his distress and the wet tear ducts were tugging at Tony’s heart-strings, but he knew it was the only right thing to do at the moment.
Steve cleared his throat. “Stevens. Roger Stevens.” He could just feel Nat cackling at him on the inside.
“Can’t risk you trying to cause an accident,” Steve explained, but Stark just stared mutinously out of the window. “Look. This is for your own good. You know that your guardian and Mr. Stone just want what’s best for you.”
“I know you are a good man, Tony. Talented, handsome. I know it would be you who’s stepping down on a ladder rung here. I know I don’t have much to my name, but I would treat you fair, and I would let you live your life like you want. And if later, you want to divorce me, I’ll give you that too. With no contest on your assets.”
Steve was jerking in aftershocks of his obviously unsatisfying climax, his face wet with tears, sobbing.
"What? What do you…?" But he knew. It didn't take a genius to understand what had happened. He took a deep breath, grabbed Tony's elbow and guided him back to sit on the porch, then sat down next to him. "Ok, first of all, marrying a pretty and talented omega — not a mistake. Second…"
Ignoring the omega’, the taller man nodded at Steve. “My name is Brennan Kwazoffsky, I’m Mr. Stane’s head of security.”
Not expecting an answer, Tony bent over and pulled a spreader bar out from under the bed. Quickly, he fixed it between Steve’s ankles, undid the leg cuffs from the bedposts, and pulled the bar up via the pulley system above the bed. Steve shifted on his back again and whimpered.
“You sure it’s him?” he asked Nat a couple of hours later, after making a show of their staged meet-and-flirt at the inn's bar.
For all their strategizing on the plane, their plans were still mostly up in the air. The good thing was that getting to the servers was relatively easy, but the downside was that getting to them without alerting the security team guarding Tony would be problematic. Compromising himself wasn’t something Steve was keen on doing. He understood that Tony’s options were mostly to take the money and run or remain a captive for the rest of his life, but for Steve, it was becoming a criminal, and that, despite how righteous it felt, didn’t seem like an ideal choice.
"I don't know yet," Steve responded absently. His thoughts were running a mile a minute. Variables, questions, strategies, plans, and options.
Once up, he took out the key Natasha had acquired and very quietly unlocked the door. With a barely-there click, he pushed the door open and heard a very quiet beeping start in the bedroom.
For a moment, the other Steve’s eyes widened comically. “For real? Imagine if we got married — Steve Stevens… Or you could be Roger Rogers-Stevens. I’m a beta, see?” Then he shook his head and turned to Natasha. “And you, beautiful?”
Waiting for no further reactions, Tony just moved back to the foot of the bed and without any warning smacked Steve’s exposed asshole.
“See these? These… are going on your balls,” he said, pulled them taut, and carefully fastened them on the tender skin of each testicle.
Tony petted Steve’s hair, putting the other hand lightly on his shoulder. It was important to start introducing intimate touch with gentleness at this stage.
Heart beating excitedly in his ribcage, Steve climbed up the stairs, unlocked the door, and… had to force himself not to stagger back. The room was filled with a sweet, sweet scent that Steve could only assume was the ambrosia— um... pheromones of an unbonded omega. Having been lounging on a bed, Tony looked at him in surprise.
“I’m going to untie your left wrist from the headboard now,” Tony explained gently, “and you are going to be a good boy and let me tie it together with your right wrist, understood?”
Once inside the airport, Steve guided Tony to walk in front of him toward the commercial flight area and went straight to the ticketing clerk.
He rubbed his wrists as if they had actually been too tight and Steve had to struggle not to roll his eyes in relief. Seemed that they weren’t doomed to spend the flight in silence after all.
“Lift your head a little, will you?” Tony said, put his palm under Steve’s head and helped to get it just high enough to fasten the carabinier to the one side of the ball gag. “Very good,” he praised, fastening the other nipple clamp to the other side of the gag the same way.
Steve’s all-body shiver was the most graphic image Tony had ever seen. Accompanied by a soft moan, it lasted for several seconds. Steve struggled to move and to stay in place at the same time,  the noise coming from behind the gag morphing into a moan that sounded desperate and thankful. Tony was staring and never wanted to stop.
Steve shivered. He turned his face as if requesting a kiss but he was still gagged, and chuckling quietly, Tony simply nuzzled his face. He kissed Steve’s cheek and nose, eyebrow. Then, unfastening the gag, he gave in and pressed his lips to Steve’s.
Steve’s eyes were large, aroused and alarmed as they stared at him and Tony couldn’t keep from smiling.
More protests but thankfully, Steve still didn't manage to muster up any actual anger or other strong emotion.
“We’ll load your bike on it for the ride back, don’t worry,” Nat continued, “it’s a bit too clunky to ride comfortably for me.”
Tony would have to recite good reasons, but it was his right as an omega to file for a divorce after five years.
Steve’s whimper was high and needy, and singing in happiness, Tony tucked himself away, grabbed a middle-sized plug from the dresser, and inserted it.
Tony looked at him for a moment longer, then his face crumpled. "I didn't want you to make a mistake," he blurted.
“You sound drunk, Steve. Take a stroll in the garden at the back, clear your head, and if you are still determined to marry my sorry ass in fifteen minutes, I’ll go wherever you want with you, okay?”
The ride lasted for over an hour, and when they finally pulled up before a medium-sized suburban home, Steve felt mildly surprised. Didn’t Obadiah Stane own something grander? Another thing that surprised him was that once Tony was safely locked into a third-floor bedroom, both men left and Steve was, once again, alone with Tony.
“What exactly,” he started off slowly, “makes you think that Mr. Stane would not allow you suppressants? This is not the dark ages. Of course, he's going to allow you the suppressants. It’s your right! And especially now that you are breaking up with your fiance. I mean, only the pious folk in the south…” He trailed off at Tony’s face getting progressively incredulous. “He didn’t come across as…” he halted. Had he really misread the situation
“In the flesh,” she confirmed. “Well – in a manner of speaking, of course. Once a year I get to shuffle back on the mortal coil so I can help a couple of lost souls like yourselves.”
“You betrayed them all, including Skye.” Ward’s hand gave a visible twitch. “And she wanted me to tell you: she knows you’re HYDRA. She knows you killed Victoria Hand. And she hates your fucking guts.”
"I won't keep you long, but I have something you really need to know, and it honestly can't really wait."
Tony looked back at James and just had time to register that he was somehow holding his own against four of the men - though he was still far too far away to do anything for Tony - before the butt of a gun appeared in Tony's peripheral vision and cracked against his head.
"Okay, I'm going to follow you, and then will you come to my office for some coffee after? You must have nearly had a heart attack spinning out. The shock might hit you later, and you shouldn't be alone."
“I can’t believe I’m going to die in a place that just got cut from the ‘25 Most Haunted Houses in America’ list. Christ, that’s embarrassing.”
“It’s a good thing that you did,” Steve found himself saying abruptly. “In the press conference. I can tell it’s going to make some people unhappy. But you were right to do it. The world doesn’t need more weapons.”
“Shit,” Tony swore, louder than was probably merited. “JARVIS you’re a traitor, and I’m scrapping your programing for this insurrection.” He grabbed the phone and swiped angrily to answer.
Tony took his double-chocolate macadamia back out towards the side door, but a large table filled with students caught his eye, and he did a double take when he realized who was leading the study group. Of course Dr. "Man of the People" Grant ate lunch with his students and offered crit on their course work. Tony couldn't help himself. "How was the pie?"
Steve hit the button for the roof, paused, then ran his finger down the whole column, hitting every button along the way.
Hauling Tony bodily out of his lab hadn’t been Steve’s intention when he’d decided to drop by with some chili left over from the team dinner. It hadn’t even been Steve’s intention when he’d noticed that Tony’s monologuing had increased in pace – from a mile a minute to a brisk, two-minute 5k – even though that was a sure sign that Tony was riding a caffeine bender through serious sleep deprivation. Ever since their fight about the infamous “sentient espresso machine” episode had ended in Clint adding “no yelling during
He used his grip on Steve’s shoulders to ease himself forward, pausing when his lips were just an inch away from Steve’s, offering Steve a chance to shift away. But Steve was already moving toward him, his hands coming up to cup the sides of Tony’s face and pull him into a kiss. It was gentle and quiet, each press of lips or brush of noses bringing a tingle of warmth back to the places where their skin had been exposed to the cold.
He made his way back to his car, noting with some apprehension that the storm had taken a definite turn toward “wintery mix” while he’d been inside. The smart thing to do, probably, would be to head straight home. But Tony had left the file folder with his copies from the Carter collection in his office on campus, and if he had to wait another twenty-four hours before he could compare the two sources, there was a 50/50 chance that he was going to crawl out of his own skin.
“That’s terrible labor politics,” Bruce whispered back, and Jane Foster turned around to give them a pointed look.
“Coulson?” Tony spluttered, finally tearing his eyes off Steve to gape at Clint. “Coulson’s alive?! What the fuck.”
Suddenly, Tony felt drained, as if trying to hold that confession back had been the only thing keeping him standing. He slumped onto the stool behind him. His body was heavy with exhaustion and vodka and some muzzy-but-desperate yearning. For a second, he thought about finding something to weld or hammer – anything to put a little metal between the world and his abrupt urge to weep without ceasing – but his hands had started shaking, and he wasn’t sure he should risk it.
“Let me go!” Steve yelled, jabbing at Natasha’s midsection with his elbow while he wrestled the gun back toward his head.
His sluggish train of thought was interrupted by the sounds of AC/DC blasting from his cell phone. It was Tony’s ring tone – the song he had programmed as his call sign after Steve told him it sounded like cats falling down a metal staircase. Hearing it now, Steve felt like he might collapse with relief.
He smirked up at Steve with an expression on his face that looked – unfortunately for Tony – like a dare.
As the clock on the mantle ticked closer to midnight, Clint Barton and Natasha Romanov sat back in their chairs by the fireplace, enjoying the last sensations of warmth before the new day came. The lamps in the library had been dimming one by one as the hour approached, but the faint sounds of the record player could still be heard from the floor below, the notes floating upward like a whispered promise.
He took advantage of James’ focus on coffee preparations to scan the shelves of his office. They were a bit on the bare side - Tony supposed that traveling light must come with the territory for a short-term position - but James had made the most with a minimalist style, including a few gorgeous modernist prints, a collection of poetry from the Harlem Renaissance, and what looked like a first edition of
But even as he spoke, the pieces were falling horribly into place: the leak at SHIELD, Harrison telling him to turn off his comms, the bad intel during their extraction missions, the Mandarin disguise, even Rumlow’s behavior on the Lemurian Star – and most of all, the nagging feeling that he was missing something he should recognize.
“Bullying. This is unprovoked bullying, Rogers, and I am going to march right downstairs and report you to Fury for creating a hostile workplace environment.”
“We’re just in time, I see,” Bruce’s voice commented wryly. He and Thor had appeared at the end of the hallway; and apparently they had seen the GIF of Liz Lemon flipping a table that Natasha had added to the group text, because Bruce had a bag of fast food in his hands. He reached into it and retrieved a box of onion rings for Natasha, who let out a noise of appreciation that made Bruce blush slightly.
“You know why,” Steve answered softly, and suddenly Tony did. Like a spur to the flank, the knowledge snapped into place and drove him forward, until his hands were cradling Steve’s jaw, and his lips were chasing Steve’s lips. Steve gasped at the contact, and for a moment his muscles tensed under Tony’s fingers. But then he melted forward, one hand pressed to the small of Tony’s back and the other brushing softly at the nape of his neck. When Tony tightened his grip, Steve relaxed into the hold, parting his lips with a soft sigh.
“Not us,” she agreed. And when the clock struck twelve, she leaned forward to brush her lover’s lips with one last ghost of a kiss.
“Well, when you say it like that, it sounds stupid,” Clint replied. “But haunting, possession, the alienating social relations caused by a system of private property – whatever you want to call it – there’s no law against getting to know each other a bit first, right? It’s been a while since we had a ghost hunter pass through.”
“It’s really creepy when she does that,” Coulson observed. “And my team makes their own decisions, Stark. But SHIELD isn’t done with me yet. I’ve made messes I need to clean up.”
“You’re not responsible for the way other people used your products,” Steve replied, and then, because something had started itching at the back of his mind, “but you thought you were. The press conference…you announced the end of weapons development the next week.”
“Now, if your majesty had been willing to avoid the battle as you were counseled,” Rhodes offered blandly, “perhaps I could be sending my two best spies to discover how Lord Pierce knew we were low on supplies and couldn’t survive a siege – rather than asking them to ply foot soldiers with pints or turn a mysterious stranger in cast-off armor into the subject of courtly flirtation.”
Tony’s finger hovered over the final name. Even as Google spit back another negative (Steven Carter had gone to Dartmouth), Tony found himself scrolling through result after result, looking for something that might explain the niggling feeling at the back of his brain. Steven was a common enough name. There was no particular reason to suspect a connection between Peggy Carter’s former-rugby-captain son and the private Steven Rogers whose name had popped up in Erksine’s notes. Still.
“Check her wrists,” the woman commands, closer now. “Stark rigged her up with some fancy new power suppressors. Some sort of bracelet.” Hands dig into my jeans pockets, and I automatically swivel on my knees, rolling back so that my legs can come up to knee my assailant’s arms away before shooting out to kick them in the center of the torso. The man lets out an “oomph” as he stumbles back, and I bare my teeth at him in a snarl.
"I need to take him," Maria says softly, voice strained. She's been crying, I can tell without looking.
“You got some snazzy tech here,” I comment as Stark advances towards me. We’re both ignoring the elephant in the room—or walkway, if you will. I drift up and to the side as the billionaire gets closer in order not to fuck up the process, drifting beside the ravenette as he nears a set of what I assume are glass doors, even if I can’t see a crack that divides two panes in half.
Taking a step back, I look at the not-roomba warily. The not-roomba rotates, before setting off into the workshop.
"We won," the supersoldier says, almost like he can't believe it. I can barely believe it either. The battle was a blur, but the feeling of hopelessness is still lingering, scattered images from the battle blurring together in my mind.
"This is the hard drive that I gave to Nick after we got back from the Lemurian Star," she says, brow furrowed.
I breathe out slowly. “He is,” I say quietly. I turn off the stove, stirring the eggs one final time before I turn to take the toast out of the toaster. “Maybe think about taking a page out of his book.”
"Yeah, I wish." A pause. "Specimen." I glance over just in time to see the guy beam. "If you guys need anything, I've been Aaron."
“Selvig?” Thor asks. Something like shock and worry taints his tone. My gut tells me that these two are connected.
“Sure we do,” Clint says, sitting backwards on a chair with his head resting on his folded arms, balanced on the back of the chair itself. “Go to wherever Dr. Cho is and kick Ultron’s ass.”
“Change of plans, Lynx,” Tony suddenly says. “These fuckers are getting into the city. I need you to go down and pick them off.” I groan, reversing my position so that I’m head down.
"Accidents will happen," Zola admits. My eyes widen when a picture of Maria and Howard Stark pop up, the headline above them declaring their deaths by tragic car accident. A picture of Nick, and I nearly choke. "Hydra created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrific its freedom to gain its security." Flashes of footage, and then a clip of the launch bay for Project Insight. "Once the purification process is complete, Hyrdra's new world order will arise." A clip of old '40's newspaper declare Steve missing, another more recent one depicting him as 'The Hero Who Lost Everything'. "We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your life. A zero sum."
I grin, squeezing her hand even when we know that Clint would notice the second something was wrong with either of us. “Well, you’ve always got a room here,” I declare, tugging her to her feet. “But in the meantime, I think we should get the kids their paper.”
"Dude, if your wife kicked you out then I don't think I want to meet her," Clint says, crossing his arms, arrow tucked under one arm. We both know that Nick isn't married.
"Hey, assholes!" I holler, already bringing my whip around to snag the nearest alien. Electricity courses through it, and I drag it towards me before yanking my whip away in order to slam my booted foot into the aliens chest, sending it flying over the railing. Two more charge at me, and I duck under their guns. Grabbing the other end of my whip, electricity tickling the palm of my hand through the glove, I fling the loop of whip over the head of another Chitauri, tightening it around its windpipe. Yanking tight, I hear the sickening snap of its neck snapping.
"The file came from these coordinates," Natasha replies. She has her StarkPhone out, display lit up. Clint's grip on the rise of his bow is white-knuckled, and his hand keeps on drifting towards his quiver.
An hour later, I'm sitting against the wall, Steve and Clint standing on either side of me. Natasha stands next to Nick's body, blocking his face from view.
Stark sends him a look colder than the ice that the blonde had been encased in, and he cuts himself off, crossing his arms.
“They keeping you here?” I ask, entering the room completely and walking over to stand beside the bed.
There’s a boom and a car goes flying over the railing. I take the opportunity to launch myself across the bridge and over the side, rolling and catching myself mid-drop, flying sideways under the bridge. Nat has landed safely below, guns in hand and pointed straight up. I hear a crack from up above, and return fire ceases.
"That's up to you," my boss says casually. But there's nothing else that he can say, because at that moment, gunshots shatter the semi-silence, and Nick cries out. He collapses to the floor, and Clint dives for his bow and quiver, rolling behind the couch that Nick is slumped against now. I swear, abandoning the flannel and lunging behind the couch, yanking the handgun concealed under it out from its hiding place. I make to rise in order to peer over the couch, but a hand on my ankle stops me. I nearly scream, but manage to hold it in. Dammit, Supernatural isn't something I should be binging so late into the night.
Even Captain America, it seems, can’t go up against a fire-breathing T-Rex and a squad of Doombots and come out of it unscathed.
I brace my hands against the table, using it as an anchor for me to lift myself off the ground and tip forwards in order to see what the others are talking about. It’s red, burnt into the skin, a box with tapered points and two swirling crescents facing in opposite directions on each side.
"Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull," the blonde says as Clint circles around the computer, inspecting the ancient contraption. "He's been dead for years."
I snort. “Only if Katie didn’t pop in for a surprise visit.” I open the door, stepping inside and kicking off my boots. “Lucky!”
"Dramatic effect," our partner replies, staight-faced. Steve looks wary, and begins to back away slowly. Natasha holds up a hand. "Calm down, Rogers, I'm not here to bring you in. This one" —she points at me, sticking her phone back into her pocket with her other hand— "has something to tell you." I shoot Nat a look, before grabbing both her and Clint by the wrist, trusting Steve to follow us into a room opposite of the vending machine Clint and I had met Nat outside of.
“I thought your father said he got the last of it?” Steve replies, a crease forming in between his eyebrows.
I’ve been planning a coming out scene for Cam ever since I first created her character. I thought that maybe the scene in Chapter 8 (where Cam pretends to be dating a girl to avoid the STRIKE team) was enough, but decided it was flexible and could be interpreted differently. Then I thought about Cam’s attitude about being ‘different’. So, here’s Cam expressing that she’s a flaming homosexual through a joke. Another note about Cam’s sexuality: she’s from the ‘40s. She’s only got a vague understanding of ‘queer’ (and I apologize if that word is offensive to some people; I, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, never found it insulting) even if she’s been in the 21st century for almost thirteen years. SHIELD had her running around on missions and training, so she never really had free time. When she hit puberty, people who were invested in Cam having a semi-childhood started asking her teasing questions about boys. She was confused as fuck, for lack of words. In the end, she made her peace with it, and doesn’t really see the need, nor have the time, to dwell on it even further. Even having been exposed to people like Clint (who I headcanon bisexual) and Nat (aro ace), she’s never needed a label to feel comfortable about how she’s not strictly attracted to the opposite gender.
"I'm not as young as I look, Cap." I rest my elbows on the table, lacing my hands together in order to rest my chin on them. "Waaaaaay back in '42, Hydra was doing all these tests on people, right? Well, they were doing that way before ‘42." A sharp intake of breath from Rogers. "As far as SHIELD could tell, Hydra swiped me when I was eight so they could expermiment on me. The motive was pretty obvious; I was a kid and I was easy to get to and I already had powers. They took the pre-existing powers and used them to give me a few more. After they were done with me, Hydra froze me like a popsicle when I was ten in ‘42. SHIELD dug me up sixty years later, trained me until last year.
Surging forwards, hands outstretched, I slam into the Legionaire, gun lodging in the curve of its throat, pushing it back into the railing of the catwalk, where it shatters from the force of the impact. Grinning ferociously, straps of my mask digging into my cheeks, I use the sudden stop to propel my body up and into a handstand, letting my body tip over. My feet hit the catwalk just as gunfire breaks out, and I swear, ducking on instinct.
"Not anymore," Natasha replies. "Pack your stuff, come over to DC. Bring Clint, Fury has a mission for us."
"Should've known that you'd only get out of bed fo food," the supersoldier says. I stick my tongue out at him, but then Sam sets down a plate of eggs and bacon in front of me and I'm distracted for a good while.
"But that's only temporary," Natasha says. "Selvig says that we can shut it down with Loki's sceptre."
"25," the STRIKE operative replies, flipping past something and clicking on another icon. A photo pops up of a man with huge-ass ears and a massive nose. "Top mercs led by this guy, Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had 36 kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualities."
“He does have a point,” I say, crossing my legs. “SHIELD is an intelligence organization, don’t let the name fool you. And an intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.” I pop a blueberry into my mouth, pushing it into my cheek so that I can speak. “My hypothetically nonexistent soul is on Loki trying to wind us up, though. He wants to start a war, and if we don’t cover every base, he’ll get exactly what he wants. If we don’t look into whatever Nick is squirreling away, we only have half of the puzzle to poke at.”
Poking my head into the room, I see that Natasha has wedged herself into the hospital bed beside our resident archer. I grin.
And the way that Tony says it is sad, almost, resigned. He points his StarkPhone at the nearest patch of empty floor, and a 3D schematic of wrecked code pops up.
The warm water feels amazing, seeming to wash everything away. Watching the grime from the past day swirl down the drain, I feel like an entire weight has been lifted from my back.
"Sooooo, how do those gloves of yours work, Hinojosa?" Tony asks. I hum vaguely, setting aside a textbook I'll probably need.
“We trained with Cam, Nat,” Clint replies flatly. “That’s practically what we were groomed for.” Another short stretch of silence, and I spot the sandy-blonde’s shoulders slump in defeat out of my peripheral vision. “Loki,” he says thickly, “he got away?” I don’t know who he’s directing it at, but Nat and I both nod anyways.
I don't know why I thought living with Clint would be uneventful. A month and a half after the Battle of New York and we're in some sort of tangle with what Clint had dubbed the tracksuit mafia.
The two break apart, turning to face the rest of the team. I drop back onto the couch, kicking my feet up on the nearby coffee table. Laura waves awkwardly. “Hi.”
“Fuck, I need some coffee,” I mumble to myself. Straightening, I face the ravenette with resigned posture. Underestimation is the key to prying out information, and with my first impression it’ll be easy. Assuming Clint hasn’t spilt the beans yet, that is. At least now I’m not in a decaffeinated zombie trance. I hide my hands behind my back in order to conceal the telltale black gloves. The so-called god seems surprised, though, so that’s another bonus.
“Fine,” Tony replies grimly. “Let’s keep ‘em occupied.” I tilt in order to go between two speeders, extending my arms to slice gashes in the sides of the speeders. Sparks of electricity tickle my skin, but I pay them no attention as I do a sharp, 180 turn in order to head for Stark Tower. There’s no doubt in my mind that Thor had headed straight to confront Loki, and Nat and Clint would probably want to offer backup.
“Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off,” Loki replies with a sneer, waving his scepter. But behind the facade I can see that his stance is wide and defensive, tense, wound up and ready to attack or react at the slightest notice.
Behind him, Legionnaires fly out of the open back of the truck, heading towards the Quinjet—the source of the surprise attack.
“I’ll have you know I’m an actual adult,” I say mock-seriously. “I can even drink legally now. It’s awesome.”
“Roll call,” I call, coming to a stop and resting a hand on my hip. Thor, Rogers and Banner's heads swivel around to face me. I strangle my unease quickly, before it can grow into an ugly-ass monster. “Two assassins, one popsicle, one otherworldly being, one green giant? All here? Good. I heard that we’re supposed to get the glowing square of destiny back from reindeer god.”
"You're evil, you know that?" I mutter, clambering to my feet. Lucky is waiting outside the door, tail thumping against the floor of the apartment.
“Rogers, I want you to get your patriotic ass, American frisbee of death and national anthem of healing down to engine three!” I call over the rush of wind. “You better bring Stark as well; I won’t be able to check the engines from where I’ll be, and I’ve got no clue how this shit works. Don’t think anyone would want me in their either, ‘cause one wrong move sends us all down.”
“Found anything, doctor?” I ask, waltzing into the lab, a piping-hot mug of coffee in one hand. It’s much more crowded in here than when I left. “I’m on a schedule, so if you’ve got anything, I can get there fast if you need me to. Procrastination is at five, then I’ve got assassinations at seven and eight thirty.”
"As a team," Steve replies. I roll my shoulder as I rise, just as Steve and Thor turn back to Natasha, Clint and me.
"Well, apparently Batroc doesn't want to be captured," I say, forgoing the steps and flying down. "Who knew, huh?"
The wait is agony, but eventually Jasper Sitwell emerges from some sort of hotel with another man and a few bodyguards. They chat for a while. Hug. Then the other man leaves. That's Sam's cue, and Clint readies the rifle. Natasha had hooked us all up with devices that were tapped into Sam's phone, which meant we could hear everything that happened.
And there was even more that I wanted to leave behind, shed like a snake shed its skin, but I didn’t have that privilege. I’ll always carry pain with me. Everyone will at some point in their life, but some people’s burdens are heavier than others’. The baggage I dragged with every step I took was something that others used to help me bear, but I had to leave them behind with everything else I was forced to drop in return for that twisted freedom.
The knife in my hand clatters to the floor as a searing pain erupts in my head. I double over, hands flying up to my head. As soon as the tips of my fingers make contact with my temples, the red dissipates, and the crushing pressure on my skull lessens. Letting out a heaving breath, I quickly straighten up, greeted only by silence.
The kettle whistles from the kitchen, and I swear when I bang my head against the metal walls of the vents.
Somebody pokes me, and my hand shoots out on autopilot, snagging the wrist attached to the hand attached to the finger and twisting it hard. A sharp yell of pain snaps me out of it, and I quickly let go.
Taking a deep breath, I reach towards the top one and drag it towards me in order to pry the lid off.
"I didn’t need to know,” Clint replies, shifting so that he’s sitting next to Nat. I force myself to look him in the eye, but quickly look a bit to his right. “I didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today.”
Clint and the supersoldier exchange looks, some sort of unspoken communication passing between them.
The force of which the hook leaves my hand leaves another welt on my palm, identical to the one from earlier, but I count myself lucky that the grapple didn’t catch me on its way back.
“Thanks, but the last time I was in New York, I kinda broke Harlem,” Banner replies sheepishly. I snort.
“We… we don’t have time,” I admit guiltily. Because Clint deserves so much more, deserves to have all the time in the world to heal. Someone who can care without hurting. The archer’s gaze bores into me.
“I have an army,” Loki says defiantly, almost like a child. A child who’s the Norse god of mischief with a scepter that can mind control people, but a child nonetheless.
Sparks fly when the vibration collides with whatever the Soldier’s arm is made of, and I quickly launch off the catwalk as Steve advances, catching his shield just as the Soldier aims a few shots at him.
“One op,” I say firmly, holding up a gloved finger. A silver cord woven into the black material glints in the sun. Fury hands me the tablet under his arm.
“Uncle Clint!” Lila exclaims happily. Clint’s grin grows into a smile as he bends down to hoist his niece up against his chest, reaching down to ruffle Cooper’s hair.
It’s hard for me to keep my eyebrows from flying up and off my face, jaw unhinging just a little bit.
Steve and I take down three more mercs. Just as I vault up onto the railing of the next floor, though, a fourth merc emerges from wherever he'd been hiding, gun pointed at the supersoldiers head.
“Yeah,” the billionaire agrees, walking down a few steps. “Seen a bit of mileage, and you’ve got the uh—how’d Cam put it—the ultimate glow stick of destiny.” I seesaw my hand back and forth with a shrug, leaning against the bar as the genius approaches.
“Sam and I are leaving tomorrow,” he tells me. There’s something sad in his voice. It reminds me of Ckint whenever he talks about SHIELD. It speaks of things lost but not forgotten.
“Cooper, Lila, be good for your mom,” I say, tucking a knife into one of the sheathes on the inside of my jacket. “And remember, if anyone bad comes—“
There’s crashing down below, but I don’t have time to worry about that because there are men with guns and they’re aiming at me so I fuck behind stopped cars, empty of their owners.
Both of us shoot to our feet, concealed weapons at the ready in the blink of an eye—but then my eyes register that that hunched-over form is familiar, and I lower my knife.
“Oh, it’s definitely the end times,” Bruce mutters, glasses removed as he punches the bridge of his nose between two fingers.
"Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash." Clint and Tony both nod affirmatively, and the archer glances at the genius.
“I’ll think about it if you do,” Tony fires back, sitting up. I sigh, picking up the pan on the stove to scrape the eggs out.
"Thanks, Cap," I say dryly. "I'm actually nineteen." Rogers' brow furrows, and I can see his fists clench on the table.
Slipping my phone out of my pocket, I bring it up, waiting for the right moment. Steve flings his shield, taking out the first guy, then grabs the arm of the second guy, throwing himself forwards so that it looks like the merc had picked him up bridal-style. I press my finger to the photo button. The merc falls forwards, and Steve punches him to ensure that he's unconscious. Then he turns to me, and I can see the raised eyebrows from underneath the cowl. I shrug, tucking my phone into my pocket.
as he turns around to face the room at large. “It’s probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so—is it so—it is. It’s so terrible.”
There’s only a few shots before the arrow latches onto the Soldier’s metal arm, electrocuting it immediately. The dark-haired man is forced to drop the gun, rolling over the other side of the car he’s on top of, sitting after having fallen back to absorb the impact of his kick that sent Steve flying.
"Fuck Fury," I mumble. "Call me at a reasonable hour and I might just say yes. Even better, call someone else. Like Ghost. Annoy her."
I mull over the words, carefully forming my reply. Steve likes to hear the truth, I know that. He may not like it, but he needs to hear it. But there’s a difference between telling the truth and telling the
"Fury was right about that ship," Natasha murmurs. I merge a four with another four. "Somebody's trying to hide something." I strain to hear anything over a slight increase of customers. "This drive is protected by some sort of AI. It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands."
“It seems to run on some form of electricity,” the Captain finally replies with a noise of frustration.
And then we’re there and Steve is too and there are sparks flying as a metal fist collides with an unbreakable shield.
spy. His secrets have secrets.” He pauses to pop a handful of whatever is in the silver bag into his mouth. “It’s bugging him too, isn’t it?” the brunette continues without hesitation, gesturing at Banner.
"Naturally, they let me retire. One year later, and everything that I did to escape this hellhole failed." I spread both arms, slumping back in my chair. "Guess who's back, bitches?" There's a shift in movement behind me, and I glance over my shoulder for a second. Phil is leaving. Thor looks thoughtful, and when he sees me looking at him, he smiles.
“I’m going to say this once,” Steve says, voice full of authority, commanding aura exuding from his every word.
"Congratulations!" the employee says. He's beaming, but it's almost a little too bright. I roll my eyes at myself. You're in a store. He's an employee. They all have to be a little bit extra if they want to get paid. "Where are you guys thinking about going?"
“Yes ma’am,” I hear the Captain reply. Veering right, I cough as I inhale errant smoke from the burning engine, quickly diving down under the helicarrier. A red and gold shape quickly comes into view, and I salute Stark as I speed past him, heading for the underside of the helicarrier.
Something twisted quickly across Tony’s features and then disappeared, but he made no other move to respond. The quiet stretched out between them, and Steve felt a flush creep up the back of his neck. Shit. Natasha had bet him fifty dollars that he wasn’t going to be able to keep his feelings secret for longer than a week, and here he was blowing it already, just three days after he'd realized he was falling for Tony Stark.
“Thanks for bringing this to us, Ward,” Natasha said, in what Steve recognized as her Black Widow voice. She moved in close to the other agent, swaying into his space, and then pressed his hand warmly before smoothly sliding the disk into her own. “This footage is going to be a huge help to us.”
And he must have been right, because the searching hands had reached the place on Steve’s abdomen where his uniform had been torn open by a crow bar, and Tony’s face had frozen in horror.
“I should go, actually,” he blurted out, trying to ignore the quick flash of disappointment on James’s face. “Gotta get the files from my office, and then I’ll probably just...look through them there. Get in a few hours of work.”
“But it’s fine to take chances with yourself?” Tony demanded. He walked into the bathroom and returned with a wet washcloth, which he held gingerly against Steve’s forehead. “It’s fine to let yourself be used as leverage against us.”
never, he realized: just like floorboards couldn’t regenerate, and a ladder couldn’t disappear and reappear, and a house couldn’t be built like an M.C. Escher drawing from hell. And indeed, the longer he concentrated on the complete impossibility of his ever shooting Tony in the stomach, the more the pain in his own abdomen subsided. He probed his side with his right hand and found nothing but smooth skin under the wet slick of his shirt. Emboldened by that experiment, he sat up. If anything the pain felt more distant than when he had been lying down.
“I think I’m capable of forming my own impressions of my colleagues, Dr. – Stark, was it?” Grant lingered over the surname, his eyes scrutinizing Tony’s features as if to illustrate the distinctly unfavorable impressions he was forming as they spoke.
“How did you know they were coming?” Steve asked, trying to keep his mind off the burning in his gut. The smoke was even thicker now, and Steve breathed as shallowly as he could as they moved past the fourth floor.
He could hear Ward and Rumlow cursing, and he knew he couldn’t give them time to realize they could still use Tony for leverage. Reaching for a tray of implements on the table beside him, he whipped it at Ward’s face and followed it with a flying tackle, colliding hard enough to knock the gun out of his hand. Ward struck back, forcing Steve to fend off quick jabs to the throat and ribs.
Well, morose and hot, Tony allowed. But the “hot” part kind of went without saying at this point: it was the unspoken subtext of every sentence his brain generated about Steve Rogers. “This is my (hot) roommate, Steve.” “Where’s Steve? Oh, he’s at football practice (being hot).” Or, if it was a day ending in “y,” “stop looking so judgy (and hot), Rogers. I already told you: I ate dinner yesterday.”
Steve paused for a moment, his jaw still clenching like he was working over something painful in his throat. Then he reached up and squeezed the gauntlet on his shoulder, his grip strong enough for Tony to feel it through the metal.
Tony made an effort to keep the disappointment off his face, but he couldn’t stop himself from rapping his knuckles irritably against the arm of his chair. The skin on his fingers was still raw from the now-unfamiliar work of wielding a sword – a few pale red lines marking the places where the edges of his gauntlets had pinched against his gloves. But the sting of oak against bone grounded him. It transposed the rattling sensation at the base of his skull into a rhythm of pain he could control.
Tony tapped a few times at the edge of the lectern, waiting for a gradual quiet to fall over the fourth floor of the library, where a group of colleagues and a few over-eager students had gathered for his much-postponed talk.
existed. He had enlisted in the Army, he had served overseas, and, somehow, he had been erased from official records. It felt like the surest sign yet that Project Rebirth was something big – something that could change the whole narrative of his book.
Tony drew a circle around “Carter, Steven” in his book and turned his attention back to the press release. It was sparse on detail, but it did contain a small note at the bottom enumerating some of the specific terms of Peggy Carter’s generosity: a needs-based scholarship in the Art department, three artist sketches for the college’s art museum, and a small collection of archival materials for the library.
The agony of that sight was an incalculable order of magnitude worse than anything he’d imagined when he first saw the helicopters approaching his house in Malibu. Waking up tied to a metal chair was a mere annoyance by comparison. Even realizing that his attackers were going to take out his whole house to get to him hadn’t managed to put this abduction into the top five. Tony had gotten Pepper out safely. And while he had already begun plotting the comeuppance richly deserved by anyone who had so much as threatened to hurt her, Tony had resigned himself to rolling his eyes through the perfunctory “roughing up” sessions before the goons in question made whatever mistake would eventually allow him to jury-rig his way out. Most kidnappers, after all, turned out to be less experienced with kidnapping than Tony Stark.
“All right, chumps,” Clint said, flicking cards deftly across the table from his perch on the kitchen counter, “the little blind is a sock, and the big blind is an item of outerwear of your choice.”
Steve nodded, leaning back against the counter with a dishtowel thrown over one shoulder. The pain and tension were gone from his stance now, but so was whatever reckless edge had been building before the call.
“But why attack Tony?” Steve wondered. “He isn’t even a part of SHIELD. He didn’t know any more about TAHITI than we did.”
Instead, Steve had been seized by a spirit of mischief. Putting on his most morose poker face, he had proceeded to invent a series of Depression-era dishes, from “Hoover Rolls” to “Poor Man’s Potatoes,” the recipes for which he concocted out of the blandest ingredients he could imagine. By the time he was in the process of describing his
“They’re everywhere,” Coulson confirmed grimly. “There are incursions at the Triskelion, the Academy, the Hub. I started flying to New York as soon as I heard.”
“I’m afraid I can’t disclose that information,” Steve said, laying one hand on Tony’s shoulder to signal a pause while he scanned the perimeter of the room. “There are two very specific clauses in our contracts: no talking about former clients and no disclosing our personal opinions about Posh Spice.”
“Goddamn it, Steve!” Tony shouted from the other side. Steve could still see a square of his face and torso through a plate-glass panel in the upper half of the door: enough of a view to know that Tony’s hands were probing frantically for a catch or a handhold.
“I loved them both,” Steve replied, a stubborn set to his jaw. “Bucky and I didn’t know how to picture a future for what we had before the war. So when he decided to enlist, we gave it up. We both figured we’d get married eventually anyway. Have families. But some things really are better nowadays. If I could only tell him what was going to be possible later –”
“You’re conspiring with my tech now? This is treason. What other allegiances have you corrupted?” Tony responded. He grimaced apologetically at Steve, but Steve’s expression was smooth and neutral. He waved his hand to indicate Tony should take the call, then turned around to busy himself with the dishes in the sink.
One block: he should never have let Tony talk him into leaving the rest of the security team in D.C. If Tony would just take the threats
The problem was that the discovery of his father’s notebook had made the web of connections between Tony’s data points seem even denser than he’d imagined. Howard’s notes were often frustratingly short on narrative detail, but Tony had been able to piece together a few bits of information to add to the whiteboard propped against the back wall, which now read:
? It was an infuriating tendency, Tony reflected, and one that was only partially counterbalanced by the not-entirely-displeasing spectacle presented by his retreating ass.
He paused for a moment, one foot still hanging above the bottom stair, as his memory flashed back to the horrible weekend he’d spent carting his father’s old things to a storage unit in Medford. He’d made only a half-hearted attempt to sort through the mess before shoving the rest of the boxes toward the back and picking up stress donuts for the drive home. But suddenly he felt absolutely certain that among the items he’d examined had been a faded black notebook, covered with the diagram sketch of a circular, star-patterned shield.
Tony knew who it was without looking: his body sagged at the sound of Steve’s voice, his limbs going loose with something that could have been relief or embarrassment.
“It’s what I was literally made to do, Tony,” Steve shrugged. “I’m government funded and Stark engineered.” He winced. “Sorry, I didn’t mean –”
“Give a guy a goddamn minute, Steve,” he said softly. “I’m having to do a major cognitive reboot over here. It takes a while for the operating system to come back online. Just…sit down? Let me show you the new flame retardants I’m adding to your uniform.”
Tony took a few deep breaths, trying to take in the newest low in Ty’s long list of predatory behaviors while also scrambling for something he could say that might distract Steve from how horribly bad Tony’s judgment had been in letting such a vicious asshole into his life.
“How about adored?” Steve asked, feeling himself flush with the embarrassment and pleasure of saying it. “If you’ll let me.”
Almost before Sitwell was down, Tony was lurching back toward Steve. He straddled Steve’s waist, crossing his hands over Steve’s chest and heaving downward.
“My best friend,” Steve answered finally. “Bucky. Our unit was conducting a rescue operation, and we got pinned down, took shelter in a general store. A missile came through the window and landed just feet away from me. It didn’t go off right away, but I was afraid any movement would trigger it. Bucky was already hurt: he’d taken a bullet to the thigh the day before. I told him to get out, and he didn’t.”
“And he’s going to catch more than he bargained for,” Tony replied. “Cap, you can take the team and go get Barnes out of Bucharest. I’ll meet Zemo and politely remind him that this isn’t my first revenge rodeo.”
Tony navigated his way to the web pages for both the museum and the library to see if he could find any clues about what might have been included in the Carter collections. But none of the materials seemed to be digitized, and none of the library guides flagged World War II as an area of interest.
“A car accident, Tony,” Steve answered finally, jaw clenching around the words. “God. All the time we spend training for the field, trying to prepare for every possible scenario, and then a car accident. We could take down half of HYDRA in a week, and still all it would take is one asshole missing a stop sign.”
Well, awful on the scale of Steve Rogers, Tony amended. His jawline could still give a sculptor a stroke. And the lines that flexed through his forearms still filled Tony with the kind of feeling he imagined must have made Gustav Klimt paint Emilie Flöge. But Steve’s shirt was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot, his expression slack. And as he stared into space – not so much
They blasted off quickly, as they knew that once the armor was in the air the element of surprise wouldn’t last long.
“Virginia Pepper Potts – I have no choice but to listen. You have literally extorted my attention at the hands of my own A.I. My ears are completely at your mercy, you devious tech-jacker.”
“Well in that case,” he said, grabbing a fistful of Steve’s shirt with one hand, “you want to take me to bed, soldier?” He pulled Steve in for a kiss, and Steve felt his stomach dip, as if he had taken the first leap off a plane.
story about Gulmira. Steve’s eyes jumped away from the accompanying photo: a group of men, huddled behind the remains of a wall that was still exploding toward the camera, dust and debris obscuring all of their faces except one. Shortly after the picture had been taken, the photojournalist had won second prize in the White House News Photographer’s Association awards, Captain Steven Grant Rogers had been awarded a Medal of Honor, and over a hundred people had been killed.
“Did you ever consider that they would use that against me too?” Tony retorted. “They sent me videos, Steve. Every hour, a new video. Do you have any idea –”
” to the list of Tower rules on the refrigerator, Steve had been making a real effort to stop micro-managing Tony’s coping strategies. And so, despite a worrying number of coffee mugs littered around the room and what looked suspiciously like a muscle twitch developing in Tony’s left cheek, Steve had tried to limit his expressions of concern to one pointed look, which he directed at the spoon that Tony had picked up, not in order to eat the chili, but rather to tap out a drum solo against the side of his desk.
He pulled a small metal disk out of his pocket and clicked a button on the side. A video image appeared projected above it.
Tony’s voice was rough with anger, but his hands were gentle as they ran over Steve’s body, looking for injuries. He plucked the bobby pin away from the charred sleeve and burnt skin at Steve’s wrist. Then he made his way down to the sharp pain in his calf.
“It’s a pretty common way to go, Steve,” Tony said gently. “I know our lives carry some pretty strange risks, but that doesn’t mean we get to skip the everyday variety.”
Tony had intended it as a barb - a bit of spice to season the pan for a verbal sparring match he’d been anticipating all day - but he found a very different kind of warmth spreading through his chest when Grant gave him a small, wry smile in return.
(last week a group of Stark Industries shareholders had been treated to the first thirty seconds of “I’m Every Woman” when Steve had forgotten to silence his phone before a Board meeting), but the corner of his mouth was tugging upward as he slid right to cut off a dramatic key change.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, and then he hunched forward in shock as a bullet sliced between his ribs. A burning sensation spread out from his side across his abdomen, and he tried to will away a wave of lightheadedness as he felt his own shirt start to grow wet and heavy.
“Oh trust me, I know the drill,” Tony agreed, “which is why I did a little preliminary research to get us started. You’ve buried this one very, very deep, so I couldn’t get much.” He tapped a few buttons on his phone, and an image of a medical facility appeared next to the blacked-out files. The examination chair in the middle was empty, but it was surrounded by monitoring equipment, IV tubes, a ventilator, and what looked like an injection gun. “It seems like SHIELD has gotten back into the human experimentation game.”
"Thank you!" Parker called again, and then he was off, heading towards the back door to the kitchen. Parker's aunt, May, worked two afternoons a week in the cafeteria to help pay for Parker's tuition, and on Sundays, Parker bussed as well to thank her. He was a brilliant kid, and Tony suffered the guilty reminder that he still had a half-finished nomination for the Exemplary Leadership Award to submit for him. Parker deserved it.
“I’ll go through every door you do,” Steve agreed, leaning in to press a kiss to Tony’s lips, “for as long as I can – until the very last one.”
“Maybe the Mandarin was bluffing all along,” Bruce suggested when they talked through the mystery over late-night sushi. “Maybe he got lucky with the first bombing and never actually had the resources to keep it going.”
“Well, now, someone’s looking much better,” a voice purred suddenly in his ear, and Tony’s stomach reeled horribly.
Clint and Natasha shared one of their looks – the kind that made it seem like they were speaking Morse code with their pupils.
“Trust me, I’ll definitely ‘knock you out’ later,” Steve smiled, throwing in an eyebrow raise of his own as he ran a hand through Tony’s hair, “but let’s all be together when the call comes. I’d like…it would be good to hear it as a team.”
His first impulse was to clasp Tony’s arm: a gesture Steve had performed a hundred times when he needed to show Tony that he was on his side. Somehow that had always seemed like a simpler way of saying it – like a language they could share precisely because they didn’t remember how or when they’d learned it – and Steve felt like if he could just make contact, Tony would know: he wasn’t angry that Tony hadn’t told him what he was up to. He was scared. Steve remembered the fear that had led him to keep the fights with HYDRA to himself, and he was worried Tony was keeping something from him for the same reason.
Steve walked over to put Tony’s coffee on the table and then felt his breath catch in his throat when Tony reached out and took the mug from his hand instead.
“I have a biological tracker I’ve been working on,” Bruce put in, “undetectable unless you know what you’re looking for. We can use it to follow you.”
“Well excuse me for being concerned,” Steve retorted, his stance shifting as he leaned toward Tony. “We don’t hear from you in months, and then you drop this in our laps with no explanation? How am I supposed to react?”
Moments later, Tony heard a sharp crunch followed by a heavy thud, and Tiberius Stone was flat on the ground.
“Hey,” Tony said softly, squeezing Steve’s hand in his, “you didn’t lose me. You can’t. That’s what I should have told you that night at Barton’s instead of walking away, but I was too jealous and scared to admit it. I’m so totally gone for you, Rogers. I have been for a long time. I can’t promise I’m not going to make terrible decisions because of it. But I won’t leave you. Not ever again.”
“I guess I’ll head to my rooms,” Steve replied evenly, pressing the button for his floor and carefully studying the numbers as they ticked downward. “I should get cleaned up anyway.”
Steve paused for a moment, and Tony realized he had started drumming nervously on the back of the chair he had vacated, trying to wait to call the armor until Steve actually asked him to come.
Many miles away, and well beyond the range of either Steve or Tony’s thoughts by now, the last light in the Red Manor winked out, as if the house were settling in for another year’s sleep.
Tony hesitated a moment, struggling against the fight instinct insisting he should keep working to prove a point (what point? unimportant) and the flight reflex screaming at him to high-tail it out of there before he curled up in Steve’s lap like a cat. But finally he surrendered, shuffling over and lying across the length of the couch, the top of his head barely resting on the edge of Steve’s thigh.
Steve risked a glance in Tony’s direction and saw that he was running his eyes slowly and deliberately over Steve’s torso.
“Do you think we could save this conversation until after I’ve had my hospital pudding?” Steve asked, trying to massage one of his temples and wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches running up his side.
That development was just as surprising to Steve as it was to the top executives at the Bureau, who had had very different intentions when they’d assigned him as Tony’s partner two years ago. Exhausted by Special Agent Stark’s monomaniacal pursuit of the so-called “X-Files,” the top brass had looked at Steve’s record – a working-class kid from Brooklyn, recruited by the Army out of community college, promoted through the ranks, awarded a Purple Heart and a Distinguished Service Cross before his honorable discharge – and taken him for a company man: the kind of agent who would deliver orderly reports about his partner’s misconduct to a concerned superior officer. But thanks to Colonel Phillips’s selective record keeping, Steve’s new bosses didn’t know that he had earned most of his military honors on a rescue operation he’d been explicitly ordered not to attempt. If the Bureau chiefs had seen the smirk on Captain Rogers’ face when he returned to base with ten POWs and a hot-wired jeep in tow, they might have thought twice about pairing him up with Tony Stark.
“A big hulking guy like you can’t budge them?” Tony asked, one eyebrow raised. “What do you expect me to do? Sweet talk them? I’m going to check out the second floor.”
A polite smattering of laughter followed, and Tony flashed a tight smile, only to have it stretch a notch tighter when he saw Dr. Grant slipping into an open chair near the back. So much for Tony’s hopes that Grant would be too busy getting ready for his students’ gallery opening to attend the talk - not that anything about the past few months had suggested Tony would catch a break.
But ever since the first sketch, Grant had continued to look distracted - almost unwell - and when his hands stayed clenched in his lap through the entire Q&A, Tony found himself vibrating with a feeling that he decided to label “irritation at a colleague’s refusal to provide valuable feedback.”
Steve looked up, and the fight seemed to seep out of him. His grip on the table went loose, and he let out a long sigh.
hoped to leave out, and it would have been so much easier to hide over email or the phone. But now Steve was staring at him earnestly, the furrow back between his brows, and Tony’s anger wasn’t so righteous that he couldn’t recognize he was about to pull the same move they’d both been trying on each other for years. Playing things close to the vest wasn’t doing a great job of keeping anyone safer.
He held out the disentangled heating coil with a slight smirk. Tony blinked at it for a few moments, and then a broad smile spread across his face, so brilliant that all signs of fatigue momentarily faded away.
“Exactly,” Tony nodded. “Those first few days, that was when I had my highest opinion of you. Of course I wouldn’t hold that press conference
Steve’s brow furrowed, and Tony could see the muscles along his jaw working as he stared down at the blankets between them.
Rumlow yanked Tony’s head backward, and he came up spluttering and gasping. Steve could feel his own muscles constricting in agony and rage, but he forced himself to concentrate his reaction into a controlled jerk of his right arm, which snapped the restraint on his bicep without revealing his free wrist.
“When you’re subpoenaed for the inevitable senate hearing about this, just remember: it was all Steve’s fault,” Tony advised.
“Fine!” Steve snapped. “Please. I’ll tell you. Ward, I’ll tell you, because the message comes from Coulson.”
A little knot of people entered from the direction of the science building, and Tony shifted his feet back to the floor to allow Bruce Banner to drop into the seat next to him. Bruce was clutching a load of books under one arm and holding onto a Styrofoam plate of precariously piled snacks with the other. When his attempts to shift the books to the table dislodged a cheese cube from the stack, Tony plucked it out of the air and popped it into his mouth.
And hit him again, seven times in a row, but since Steve was actively trying to get away now, not every hit struck home.
Closing his eyes, Tony pressed his lips to the center of Steve’s gag, then a corner of his mouth, on the chin.
Steve raised his eyebrows and slowly turned back to look at Tony. "You're offering me five million bucks for something most mercs would agree to do for fifty grand, and I'm the one who’s unreasonable?"
He grinned and struck. Thigh, cheek, cheek, glutes: the maximus, medium, and maximus again. Steve grunted, he jerked, but inevitably, his wide alert eyes trained on Tony’s face and stayed there.
Which they did. When they arrived at the garage, the doors were open and the sound of a radio could be heard from the back.
“Shall we start with a riding crop? Because your position is a little uncomfortable for me to use a hand.”
“Just move,” Steve said dully. “You know I can’t let you get away and there’s no way you can best me.”
They stared at each other while Steve drank. Intently, questioningly. What now, Steve seemed to be asking, and Tony smiled.
Tony lifted his head to look him in the eyes, searchingly, but also with some smidgeon of hope, and that made Steve bold.
“The new forehead of security?” Tony said feigning delight. “Nice! And the Dave Bautista here? He the butt?”
“Or another thought... I’ll just fix your hips via a metal rod in your bum,” Tony said, smirking viciously.
"If you don't settle, I'll have to sedate you, is that what you want?" he asked with a hint of steel in his voice.
“Okay, third,” he continued intently, “your pleasure is mine. I’m going to lock up your cock for the foreseeable future. Of course, I’m always happy to see it trying to get enthusiastic, but being erect is a privilege that will need to be earned.” Now, Steve’s pupils were definitely blown, and Tony leaned into the boy’s ear and whispered, “See? I knew you could be good. So perfect for me, my little toy.”
They were sitting in a booth with a view of the door, trying to maintain their cover. Natasha put her fingers on the back of his hand and caressed it irritatingly.
It would be risky. No way Stark wouldn’t run if they just turned around here and left, but the alternative was decking him over his head or carrying him out kicking and screaming in broad daylight. Both options were unfortunately out of the question.
“I’m gonna tell you what you are not gonna do, Mr. Stark,” Payne said. “You’re not gonna bite my arse.”
“And now we wait,” Tony replied, meeting no resistance when he put the gag back into his captive’s mouth. “Until you’ve learned all the lessons I want to teach you.”
“Okay, boy,” Tony said, keeping his voice firm. “This is how it’s going to be: for discipline, you get this crop or a flog or I might choose to spank you. In thanks, you do as you are told, nothing more, nothing less. If you are good, you get my care and admiration, if not there is going to be a punishment.” He paused for effect. “And believe me, you don’t want to get punished.”
Tony gasped mockingly. “The forehead and a butt leaving me with a pretty face here? Uncle Obie is getting cheap in his old age…”
Like a jack-in-the-box, Tony got up from the bed. His eyes were alert and alarmed as if he had no idea what he was doing to Steve’s alpha biology. Steve felt his stupid heart squeezing in his chest, and he went to the only window in the room to open it, only to suddenly realize that it had honest-to-god bars on it.
“You can marry me,” he blurted, blushed, and squashing all his anxiousness continued recklessly, “We could marry — you and me. I would sign whatever you want, so that you can have your money and your company. You can...” He paused to breathe. “Work. I don't care about convention or any of that.”
“I don’t care!” Steve’s nostrils flared; he was thinking hard and fast how to sell his harebrained idea. “So they won’t pay me, so what?”
“Can you honestly tell me that you didn’t feel it too?" he asked. "The connection?” He knew he sounded naive, but in his
“I’ll put you in a different position in the morning after I’ve fucked you,” he added and rubbed himself against Steve’s body.
For a second, Tony watched him, then his lips twitched and he threw his head back in a full-belly laugh.
“Sleep,” Tony repeated, and nestling his own cock between Steve’s ass cheeks, settled into a more comfortable position.
“I’m so glad I chose you,” Tony whispered possessively. “Gonna keep you for a really long time. Forever.”
“No idea what you are talking about,” Natasha said, but she was pissed, Steve could tell Clint was going to hear about it later.
His jeans getting tighter, Tony’s breathing picked up and he widened the area of his attention. Shoulders arms, inside of the elbow, sides, his chiseled six-pack, nipples again.
He paused to gauge Steve’s response to all of what he was saying, but it seemed his pretty boy had gone into some sort of trance. Maybe it was shock and incredulity, but Tony thought that he could also see a hint of arousal in his eyes. Tony checked, and yes, indeed: Steve's cock was definitely starting to get on with the program. A wave of dark excitement rippled through Tony.
Stark’s face lit up. “You know the naked marine? America’s Ass? I’m only his namesake, unfortunately. Although, admittedly, my ass is pretty spectacular too.” Stark grinned winningly again. “So, what do I call you?”
They kissed for a while, Tony drinking Steve’s fervor and soothing him into acceptance. Steve succumbed. Tony held Steve for a little longer until he was again taking deep breaths, his body not exactly relaxed, but not any more trembling. His tears were dried up at least. Steve looked serene, but now with a distinct air of embarrassment as if ashamed of seeking comfort from his captor but unable or unwilling to deny himself.
Muscles straining, Tony nudged his van’s backdoor open and heaved the blond (he could clearly see the colour of his captive’s light soft hair now) into the back of the van. Jumping in after him, Tony closed the door, put on the light, and ginned.
Shaving two years off, huh? Smart. Well, he could definitely carry it off without facial hair like he was.
“Tut-tut, boy,” Tony reprimanded softly. “You have to keep still for this or I’ll have to fix your legs and that might end up being unpleasant. Plus”, he added, flashing him a dark grin, “that will earn you a strike.”
“Next step,” he said, making Steve’s eyes pop open. “Don’t tense up,” he said cheerfully, “it won’t play well. Besides, you were just starting to enjoy it — no, don’t deny it. It was obvious.”
“No, no, no, Stevie boy,” Tony soothed, admiring his handiwork. “Hold it. That’s it! Yes, very pretty,” he approved.
“Yeah, don’t I know it.” His eyes were roaming the shelf to his left while keeping Steve and Nat in his view. “And that other buff alpha lurking in a shiny dark vintage at the edge of the town? Also a coincidence?”
Steve’s face split into a wide smile, and he tilted his head to look at the beautiful person standing in front of him. An omega.
It wasn’t just an offer, it was an attack, an offense in the form of a bribe. An insult, not a negotiation. Steve glanced at Stark. His big dark eyes were staring at Steve with the burning fire of desperation.
Steve nodded again and slumped back onto the bed, his body not quite limp. The sensation of quiet triumph was warming Tony from the inside and carefully, he released Steve. They stared at each other for several seconds before Steve dropped his gaze and blushing, stayed lying as he was, limbs tethered to where Tony had assigned, and his cock weeping precum despite the tight little cage making it look small and cute. The sight was mesmerizing and Tony shivered.
know what's wrong?” he replied, not without humor in his voice. “What's wrong is that my bike has died and cannot start.”
Tony was silent while he let Steve process the information. Sitting quietly, his elbow on the edge of the window, looking out of it as if the whole situation wasn’t one impossibly huge clusterfuck.
Shifting on his back, Steve looked desperately confused, but Tony thought it was more out of uncertainty and surprisingly strong arousal than anything else. He was flexing his hands into fists, moving his legs sensually back and forth on the linen sheets as if his skin was sensitized but it was a novel experience or as if he wasn’t sure if he liked being aroused. He looked deliciously flushed with his nipples perked up.
The takeout came only twelve minutes later, and Steve went to retrieve it while Tony kept out of view. They ate.
“Look,” Nat said in her most reassuring tone, “We’re not here because of you, okay? We are on a job but I’ve no idea who you are.”
Tony exited his vehicle quietly, and trying not to actually sneak, walked quietly around his van and stopped behind it, waiting.
“I’m the best damn mechanic in the country. And probably several others. Possibly on this planet. Or this dimension even.”
It was only twenty minutes later that he saw a tall blond hunk coming out of a bar. Tony’s breath hitched, his palms started sweating in his gloves. Quickly, he pulled a black knit cap low over his hair, so that only people who saw his face directly, could have a chance of recognizing him.
Tony frowned. “What do you mean what? Jesus, Steve! The least you can do is buy some coke to know what it looks like for the next time!”
“That’s just your hormones talking,” Tony replied with a wry twist to his lips. “Trust me, I’ve gotten more than a few spontaneous proposals over the years.” He looked away, clearly uncomfortable. “If I agree now, I’d feel like I’m taking advantage of you.”
He paused to see if Steve would pose any more protests and when none came, Tony fixed the thing around his head. It was tight but fairly comfortable (Tony had tried it himself), and looked absolutely wonderful. Tony grinned and leaned down to kiss Steve straight on the spot where the black fabric was covering his lips.
“Fine,” he said, taking the key out. “But they go back on once we start landing.” He uncuffed the omega. “After all, I do love our public games.”
“If you keep so tense, it will only hurt more,” Tony cautioned. “You have to relax, feel the impact, absorb it.” He glanced at Steve’s stressed face and gave him a half-smile. “Don’t worry. You’ll learn.”
"Maybe you misunderstood?" Steve asked, and wanted immediately to take it back. As if he hadn’t sounded naive enough already.
They kissed for a little longer, and were now possibly giving the neighbors something to look at, but at least it was dark. Steve’s hands were on Tony’s butt, Tony’s in Steve’s hair—
“I’m so proud of you, Steve,” Tony continued. “Okay, so just because you did so good on your first test, I’m going to tell you what is going on now, okay?”
“Yeah, I know,” Tony said quietly into the dark. “But you’ll get used to it. The constant want, desire, dissatisfaction.”
“Fine,” Steve decided. “We’re going. Just keep your thoughts about us to yourself so we can get the bastard we are after, deal?”
—the feel of those hands on his thigh. Steve’s cock twitched, and he looked away, feeling that thrice-damned blush creeping up his stupid cheeks again.
“Good,” Tony praised, “that’s good.” He smiled at Steve proudly. “And how about your work? Do you need to go in during the next week or so?”
“Yes, feels good, doesn’t it?” Tony smiled. “Okay, let me just secure you before you get too hard and then we’ll talk, okay?”
She sounded light but her gaze was sharp on Stark, who, as Steve only now realized, had gone suspiciously still if only for a moment. When he stood up, his bright grin still seemed genuine but it didn’t reach his eyes and Steve tensed.
“Tony,” he started, before shaking his head and mentally rolling his eyes at himself. “We’re alone until tomorrow,” he explained in what he hoped was a neutral tone.
At first, it seemed to be an easy job: find the O, secure the O, and hand him over to his guardian and the fiance. Simple. Unfortunately, no one had informed the O of how the mission was supposed to go.
Smiling, Tony leaned down to kiss the little pucker and unbuckled his jeans. Steve tried jerking away but the pain in his nipples and testicles held him in place more than anything else.
“So basically, it’s going to be like this now: you, Steve, are mine, okay?” Ignoring Steve’s shaking and weak, muffled protests, Tony went on, “It’s about trust, yes? It has to be earned, on both sides, I realize that, but first, I’ll need to train you. This part can sometimes be difficult, but we'll manage, yeah?"
"Okay.” Tony sighed, closing his eyes for only a moment. “You need time to think, fine. You have three hours; we should check in before landing. For now, I’ll settle for you giving me my suppressants and blockers back."
“And your cover?” Steve changed the topic, and on the pretext of checking his phone, he pulled his hand out from under hers.
“Fate? You know how it sometimes is - a powerful A and a pretty B, sparks fly...” Nat shrugged, quite naturally in Steve’s opinion, but Stark huffed.
Tony rolled his eyes, but compared to how he'd been acting before, it came off as somehow muted, and Steve felt a pang of regret.
“The suppressants help with that too actually,” Tony said into his ear, sounding almost sleepy. "And after bonding, the pheromones will settle. Suppressants should be good enough until…" he cut himself off and Steve felt a flutter of happy anticipation form a warm knot deep inside his soul.
Ignoring his boy’s further pleas, he fixed the spreader bar to the foot of the bed and not wanting to distract Steve much from his building pleasure, removed the nipple and ball clamps at the same time with raising the vibration lever a level.
“It’s okay.” Steve tried using his most calming voice. “I wasn’t lying about not wanting to hurt you.”
Eyes burning with need and arousal, Steve tried shaking his head, but the chains stopped him, and he made a soft noise that went straight into Tony’s cock.
Steve peered up to the second-floor windows but it was too sunny to see inside. He slipped around the building. Thankfully, there weren’t any people around, and quietly, he started creeping up the stairs of a second-floor apartment where, according to Clint, Stark was staying. Steve really hoped he wasn’t too late. He needed that bounty.
Suddenly, they heard a mighty roar from some kind of engine and, under that, a faint whoop of success. A few seconds later, the engine was turned off and a dark-haired young ma- oh god, this was Stark. He’d shaved his goatee which now made him look like a — honest to god — a highschooler. Steve frowned. Stark was wiping his hands on a rag, was gangly, as if he’d lost a lot of weight (which was consistent with him using), but only half a head shorter than Steve. His huge chocolate brown eyes framed with gorgeous eyelashes were even more impressive up close. Well, not
The man was walking in his general direction and in anticipation, Tony stopped breathing. Fingers tight around his syringe, he was standing frozen, listening to his mark’s steps.
some more mild violence between Tony and Steve. It's along the lines of what you've already seen in ch1, but I suddenly realized that maybe it's triggering for some people? If you have triggers with domestic or sexual violence, you can take a look at the endnotes before reading.
Tony’s head snapped up to stare at him. “You mean..? The Stark Industries servers?” His eyes came alive with hope and Steve’s breath hitched. “Stark Tower, hidden floor. 54th.”
“Look at you… So beautiful.” Thrust, moan, grunt. “There’s no real resistance in your slutty hole at all, is there?”
Steve’s head was now held up at a deliciously awkward angle. He tried to pull his head away but with a soft yelp, stopped.
A short while later, he heard the front door creak and leaped up in alarm. He ran around the house and what he saw made his blood boil in betrayal — Tony, his backpack over his shoulder, was creeping as quietly as he could down the porch stairs.
“Hey, can I see some ID here?” Tony inserted, refusing to be ignored. “How do I know you’re certified to escort someone as desperately charismatic as me?”
WARNINGS: Steve slaps Tony and he has to physically restrain and carry him. IDK if I'm being too cautious here, but it occurred to me that some of it might feel like domestic abuse and some is similar to sexual violence. I think it's because Steve is confused about his own feelings and prejudice (he's working on it), and Tony does not know Steve at all and is actually afraid. Steve, as an alpha, is just so much stronger than Tony, and most of his actions are done under duress. Nothing bad actually happens imo, and I think most of it gets resolved in this chapter, but who knows how it is for other people. So this is my warning. Be careful and love yourself. <3
Probably the only reason people didn’t recognize him on the spot was that the Stark heir going missing was a closely-guarded secret. That, and the fact that he smelt nothing like an O at the moment.
“Clint and I have that other job lined up. You can handle one omega, can’t you?” Nat smirked, but let it go. “I’m guessing you’ll want my car, not Clint’s?”
There was no answer, and half a minute later, Steve heard Tony moving around: putting the chair upright and clearing the cartons off the table.
He pulled his lips over his teeth into a rictus of a smile and Steve’s fists tightened. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch the omega or put his arms around him. To squeeze and press his face near the biting gland; or maybe just wipe that painful expression off Tony’s face with his own version of a smile, his lips on the O’s.
Steve seemed to be suppressing a shiver as he let his head fall back on the bed, probably to internalize the sensation.
Well… Steve nodded. The crazy idea was suddenly fighting its way out of Steve's brain and onto his lips, but—
Steve glared, but when Tony slowly slid the tip of the riding crop from the meat of Steve’s ass up his side, over his chest and a nipple, his eyes fluttered. Yes. Tony had him.
“You the local miracle mechanic? You sure, you out of high school yet?” Steve said, trying to keep himself together.
Steve made a tiny pleading noise and Tony urged himself to say, “I’ll be right back. I’m just fetching your sleeping muzzle.”
Fuck. He never wanted to let go but he had to. He pulled away and stood up. Steve’s gaze was soft, clear and full of adoration and Tony faltered, his planned cruel smirk morphing on something softer.
“It’s just so that your erection would go down a bit,” he explained gently. “The cage I chose might be a bit tight, but I promise, it’ll fit. It’s always better to go a bit smaller to avoid accidents.”
“What do you mean you don’t need my money?” Tony exclaimed, looking affronted. “I promised you five million and I'm going to give you five million!”
Tony nodded as if indulging Steve. “Tell you what,” he said, “go outside for a bit and clear your head.”
“Wire five mil into an offshore account and text you how to access it,” Tony replied, his eyes trained on his food.
In the end, getting dear Steve out of the car and through the garage into the specially prepared guest room was physically challenging, but with the bots’ help, it was done quickly. Steve was mildly responsive but while restless, he didn’t seem to be in any fighting condition.
Tony’s lips quivered in something like unhappiness but before Steve could ask about it, he grinned winningly and raised his face to touch his lips to Steve’s nose.
This startled Steve into action: he twisted and bucked and yelled and squealed. Jerked on his cuffs and the bar his legs were fixed to, but everything was reinforced and nothing gave. Still, Tony, ducking behind Steve, grabbed his testicles into an iron grip and squeezed.
Steve stilled. His eyes were wide and quite alert now, the drug having probably worn off, his chest was rising and falling rapidly, his nostrils flaring. Still aroused but on the verge of panic.
"I'm good." He waved his hand in front of himself. “Lots of fresh air. Probably don’t even need that much.” He stepped closer and pulled his omega back into a hug. "But maybe we should get you a scent blocker prescription too. Before you go to work, at least. You're a walking temptation.”
They both knew that it wasn’t really a question though, so Tony proceeded without waiting for Steve’s input. He removed the spreader bar from between Steve’s legs and tied his ankles together.
To give him time to get used to the new sensation, Tony stepped away for a moment and standing so that Steve wouldn't see, he checked the boy’s phone. There was one message from Sam inviting Steve to meet up the next day for a game. Tony looked through some recent message history between the two, and sent him ‘Sorry, I’ve got a busy week coming up. Raincheck?’ It was only three seconds later that he got a reply in the form of ‘NP. Njoy.’ He put the phone back into the drawer and turned around.
He slid the tip of the crop down over Steve’s shaved balls and to his delight, Steve visibly shivered.
They stared at each other, Steve’s face hard as if carved of stone, his teeth grinding around his blue gag, his fingers holding onto the chain links of his cuffs for dear life.
“I’m sorry, kid,” Natasha said, clearly more amused than anything. “No offense, but you don't look old enough for that.”
Steve and Nat both knew that even though Stark had been on the run for almost six months now, he’d been here for only a couple of them.
“Comfy now, Pretty?” Tony winked and the foggy eyes blinking back at him. “It’s okay, don’t worry, I’m gonna take care of you, yeah?” He trailed his finger gently along Steve’s eyebrow and down his cheek. “So, so beautiful.”
“Oh, new people!” Tony called out cheerfully. “What happened to the old dream team? Obie fired them for letting me escape?”
Overcome with tenderness, Tony kissed him again: sweetly, soothingly, gratefully. Steve didn’t respond in any way, but he also didn’t fight it.
Steve put his nose into the dark wavy hair and inhaled in pleasure. Tony relaxed into his embrace and hummed.
They were sitting in the last row near the toilets, and the nearest passengers were seated a row away. Tony at the window, still cuffed, not talking to him. Steve sighed. It was going to be some long four hours. He was proven wrong three minutes in.
“Richard Payne,” the other man said to Steve, not at all rattled. “We are here to escort you and your charge to your temporary safe house.”
“Well, maybe,” Tony drawled, “if the Pretty Face’s butt is cute… comparatively...” He leaned back to check out Steve’s ass, then as if to compare, also Payne’s and Kwazoffsky’s.
“We weren't in love or anything. We never saw each other that way just… He thought it would be easier for me, and after my parents died I actually considered asking him myself, but…”
When he got back, Steve’s eyes were closed, his face scrunched up in an exquisite expression of misery and pleasure, and his hips were grinding down into the mattress as if seeking for any additional friction he could get.
It's ok, it's okay, it's gonna be okay, he kept telling himself. We're gonna be there before he wakes.
He tried to protest to the undressing, but his limbs had still been weak and tongue soft, so feeling already half-hard from anticipation, Tony stripped him, tied him spread eagle on the bed, and gagged him with a pretty light blue ball-gag that complimented his eyes perfectly.
“I like this new normal,” he said, and lying down next to Steve, pulled the covers up over them both.
Tony’s pace was fast now, turning erratic. Steve was panting in tandem with him, his body in place and compliant through the sheer force of will, sweat above his eyebrows.
Steve grunted. He’d fucked up. Besides Obie’s people, the airport would have its own security, and Stane had probably already secured their cooperation.
Tony pursed his lips. “I remember.” His face becoming somber, Tony shifted to relax more comfortably into his seat. Or maybe to hide into it. “Well, the long and short of it is that I believe in the universally abhorred idea of having the right to choose when and even
“I love watching your reactions,” Tony said. “I know you will want to object to everything, but you are mine now and you are going to do as told, yes?”
“See this?” he showed him the beautiful crop only to see Steve’s eyes widening in alarm. “I got it made especially for today. It matches your lighter blue gag and the plug I’ll use later.” He smiled at how Steve was squirming at Tony’s words, desperately trying to hide his arousal.
“You're… you’re serious.” Tony sighed. “Of course you are.” He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “And you just destroyed my anonymity, you dumbass.” Raising his angry eyes to Steve’s, he continued in a low, dangerous voice, “You do realize that by tomorrow morning, every dumbass is going to know that I’m an omega?”
Steve took the phone, his fingers brushing slightly against Tony’s as he did. Even that small contact sent pins and needles up his arm, and the question of whether to risk a hug was decided on the spot.
That earned him an eye roll, and Tony wondered how fondness could feel like someone was sewing your insides together with hot wire.
“We almost had ‘em this year,” Clint said wistfully, stretching out his legs to get his feet closer to the fire. “I thought for sure those two saps were the perfect targets.”
“I was starting to think I’d been stood up,” Tony greeted his partner as they rolled down their windows.
“But he fully let us think – I threw a goddamn memorial service! I sent a very rare antique car to a cellist!”
“If you insist,” Natasha said sadly, and she let her dressing gown fall over her stomach as she walked over to open the door.
She groaned, and Steve’s chest felt suddenly tight. The wound didn’t look terribly deep, but what if she had a concussion? There could be internal injuries that would take hours to show up. Could they even risk going to SHIELD medical – or to an ordinary hospital for that matter – if HYDRA was impersonating cops in broad daylight?
“Careful waving that thing around, soldier,” a voice chastised slyly, and by the time Steve had settled into a defensive stance there was a red-haired woman in a black dressing gown leaning against the second-story doorway, a small smile playing at her lips.
Or else he would type, “I miss you” into the flip-phone in the middle of the night, the sequence of keys as instinctive as the Stations of the Cross. Then something would make him jump – maybe Sam or Wanda jerking awake from another nightmare – and his thumb would slip as it hovered over the send button. He would spend hours lost in a sea of roiling panic, sure that he had torched the only bridge he had left, but when he came up for air, it would be to the buzz of the phone. “Then come home, you idiot,” the text would read, and Steve wouldn’t even bother to pack the clothes he had left strewn across the floor.
“Judging by the bioscans, Agent Harrison seems to be alive, though in some distress,” a second new voice – Jemma Simmons – followed up.
“Fury said there might be a leak,” Clint chimed in. He was leaning back in his chair, balancing it on two legs while he juggled packets of soy sauce. Every few minutes Thor threw another packet into the air, and Clint caught it and added it to the mix. “Maybe the Mandarin’s got a homicidal inside man,” he continued, and then, at a glance from Natasha, amended, “I mean a homicidal inside person.”
Grant was nodding along gamely, clearly unaware of the net being cinched tight around him, and Tony finally relented. Not even a glass-juggling, meeting-prolonging pie thief deserved to be tricked into LARPing with the Philosophy Department.
Thank you so much for reading!! We had a fantastic time writing this together and we've enjoyed all your lovely comments. We hope you enjoyed it too!! <3
“Yeah, Tony, it’s a real surprise to learn that you’re a twitchy sleeper,” Steve said dryly. “I never would have guessed. You’re otherwise so restrained.”
“Mace and Sitwell are on the committee this year,” he observed to Dummy, “so we’re going to put a little experiential-learning cherry on top, and those pencil pushers are going to eat it right up.”
Steve let out a shallow sigh as the elevator started moving, the tension in his shoulders somehow feeling worse than it had before his run.
Steve felt like someone had dropped hot coals into his chest. He wanted to lie – to tell Tony he would be fine, take some force out of the fear that was pinching at Tony’s features. It
Between the two problems - the stalled research and the accelerating infatuation - Tony spent the month of March a little distracted. And that might have been why, on this particular Thursday, he had forgotten to download his PowerPoint on the Cuban Missile Crisis until midway through his afternoon section of American History II.
Tony paused for a moment, pretending to look at the progress of the fire to buy himself some time. Probing conversations with Steve were no longer rare. These days, Tony often found himself looking for Steve when he needed to untangle thoughts that had gotten snarled up in his mind. Or else Steve would show up in Tony’s workshop with his hands fisted on his hips, and Tony would launch into a monologue until Steve had loosened up enough to complain about the SHIELD meeting – or to admit that Peggy had forgotten who he was for a full hour during his last visit. But Steve had never started a discussion that put such direct pressure on the one place where their deepening friendship bruised and didn’t heal: on the place where Tony dreamed of what he knew he couldn’t have.
“Thanks for being sloppy with punctuation, Dad,” he muttered as he reread the paragraph, inserting the missing periods.
“Shit,” Tony swore, eyes darting to the spot where Steve had started to sink to one knee. Steve looked up at him with a small, hopeful smile, and Tony reached out to grab his hands and press Steve’s knuckles to his lips. Tony’s hands were shaking, but so were Steve’s, and the smile on Steve’s face was brightening as he held Tony’s eyes.
“You can save it for the Big Senate Subcommittee in the sky, Romanov, because I already did the ‘generic psychobabble’ routine with your accomplice,” Tony retorted. “Now, if you want to tell me where the hell you’re keeping my partner, I’m all ears.”
“Why?” Tony whispered hoarsely. His stomach was roiling as the battle replayed in his head – only this time when the unknown knight rushed between Tony and his attacker, it was Steve’s blue eyes behind the visor, and Steve’s broad chest curling over Tony’s body as the sword fell. Tony traced a finger along to the edges of the wound, and when Steve shivered, Tony felt the sensation reverberate up his arm as if he’d swung a hammer against hot iron.
“I’m serious,” Tony continued, having taken a pause that could have been for dramatic effect if his chest weren’t also rising an extra half inch with each breath. “Personalized booby traps and control panels with nothing but a ‘close’ button? This guy missed out on an incredible career designing carnival fun houses…or like, user interfaces for tax-filing software.”
“I can’t be sorry you became who you did,” Tony whispered, tracing oblique angles across Steve’s shoulders toward the nape of his neck. “It’s the only reason I got to have you at all, and I don’t think there’s a version of me in any universe good enough to give that up. But I promise I’ll try to make it worth it for as long as I can.”
“Steve,” Tony grit out, fighting against the black tendrils crawling over his vision, “don’t.” For a moment, the room seemed to shiver, and in the last image Tony saw, Steve wavered, his features threatening to dissolve. Only moments after Tony lost consciousness, they resolved themselves, settling into the rougher features of the ex-sniper who had trapped Tony behind a brick wall.
“I’m betting two tanks of gas and a three-point hit on the ‘returns work in a timely manner’ portion of my student evals that the answer to that is ‘yes,’” Tony responded. “Tony Stark. I’m sorry I didn’t call ahead. I’m a professor of history at Stanley College, and I’m hoping I can take a look at the special collections donated by Margaret Carter.”
He was digging around in his bag for his phone when a flash of light drew his eyes up, and he saw a car pulling deftly over to the shoulder beside him. Tony opened the door and stepped out, hastening to show the good samaritan that he wasn't hurt.
“Obie is my business partner,” Tony said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “You can’t just give him the forearm shiver on national television.”
“Great work today, everyone,” he said loudly. “In fact, let’s reward ourselves. We’ll circle back to these questions on Thursday. Everyone go take a nap or start that paper that’s due tomorrow or grab a soft serve or something.”
— like seriously, you would send Steven Meisel straight to a new plane of existence with that waistline alone — and instead of soaking up the glory you come with me to a party I know you’re dreading and do something so publicly, long-lastingly stupid that it frankly makes me feel a little crazy.”
For the first week after their impromptu coffee date in James’s office, Tony had almost been able to persuade himself the attraction was merely physical (it was true, after all, that the first time he’d spotted James in a suit at his students’ gallery openings, Tony had tripped over a perfectly flat floor). But by the time he caught himself staring dopily at the wrinkle of concentration on James’ face as he tried to understand the Assistant Dean’s pitch for the vital importance of “Take an Intern to Lunch Day,” Tony had to admit the situation was far worse than that.
“You called the clerk at the desk a ‘narrow-minded stooge, licking the boots of a backwater bureaucracy,’” Tony pointed out mildly.
The other passenger was Tony Stark, who was currently slumped in one of the corners, his eyes closed and his mouth slightly ajar, looking as if he’d fallen asleep standing up. Which...was exactly what had happened, Steve realized, because Tony was now emitting the tiniest of snores, his head bobbing back against the mirrored glass behind him.
“And you still need to,” Steve said, his mind suddenly catching up to their situation. “Tony, there’s a good chance there are more agents searching the other floors. I’m not going to be able to move as quickly now. I need you to –”
Steve stared at him for a long moment, his face unreadable, and then turned and walked resolutely over to the couch in the corner of the workshop.
They were just starting to make their way toward the exit when Steve’s eyes suddenly froze on a stocky man with slicked-back hair: his shoes were too scuffed, his weight too far forward on the balls of his feet, and even from a distance, his right hand seemed to shake as it reached across his body. By the time something metallic glinted at the edge of the man’s jacket, Steve was already moving.
“We don’t have confirmation of their status,” Steve said, stacking the words like mental weights against a door he couldn’t afford to open. “First priority is gathering our forces and conducting search and rescue.”
“I believe the general policy is to allow for discussion on all business to do with the faculty handbook,” said Hot Hall Monitor.
Another bang snapped Tony's attention back to the immediate situation. He had to admit there was a chance he was in quite a bit of danger, so now was probably not the time to get lustful.
“Steve,” Tony whispered, his voice barely rising above the crackle of wood in the stove, “next Christmas I want to be here, just like this – with you.”
“I’ll come collect you later,” Ty said, giving Tony a wink that made his stomach turn over, “when you’re in a better mood.”
A Top-40 hit Steve vaguely recognized had started playing on the television, which was showing cell-phone videos of people dancing in their bedrooms and living rooms. Clint heaved himself to his feet, wobbling only briefly on the left ankle he’d twisted jumping out of a window, and started shaking his hips to the music.
The smile dropped suddenly from Steve’s face, his eyebrows pinching together suddenly as if he were in pain. His jaw clenched, and Tony felt his heart sink. So much for the hope that he’d just gotten a socially acceptable amount of wasted: he must have done something really humiliating to make Steve feel so frustrated and uncomfortable.
The better part of valor might have reminded him that his ancient Honda Civic wasn’t exactly a road warrior in inclement weather, and so perhaps a drive to Medford should not have been attempted under current conditions. But the worser part of desperation had kept him up until the wee hours of the morning watching Dummy hit his cardio peak zone on the wheel and speculating about when and where his father might have crossed paths with the names in his research notes. And in any case, the worst of the storm wasn’t expected until later that afternoon.
The lobby was deserted, the only sound the slow wail of the fire alarm. Steve paused for only a cursory scan before he headed for the stairwell, taking the steps two at a time, gun at the ready. As he neared the fourth floor, the air thickened with haze, and Steve could see a steady stream of smoke pouring out from underneath the door to their hallway. He was about to reach for the handle when he heard a muffled shout from above, and his heart did a horrible, hopeful leap in his chest: a shout meant a struggle, but a struggle meant that Tony was still alive. It meant that Steve might still be in time. Pulse pounding in his ears, he sprinted the last set of stairs, took a deep breath, and cracked the door slowly open.
“Let’s not, Cap,” Tony snapped. “I get that ‘stoic but kind’ is your professional M.O., but it would be a lot easier to pretend I’m not trapped in a small, dark box with the man who’s been ignoring me for weeks if you would just...you know...keep ignoring me.”
situation’s going on back home. But Banner’s moving in this week, and I’m going to work on the spy kids. I could use a man of your talents in the Tower to protect me if Banner hulks out when we run out of tortilla chips – or if Romanov decides to stab me in the neck with another needle.”
“We’ve got evac incoming,” Tony said, his free hand moving over Steve’s arms and shoulders as he scanned for the worst injuries. “What’s your status, Cap?”
More and more, Tony would banter with Steve too – even call him over to lift something or to test a piece of equipment. That’s how Steve learned that as bewilderingly fast as Tony’s words moved, his mind moved faster. Watching Tony work was like being on his bike: the more the machine accelerated, the quicker his instincts would get.
“I don’t know what you heard or saw in there,” Steve said, “but I wanted to tell you that the reason I care about the X-Files – it's not because I always need to feel like I’m in the right – or, that’s not the only reason anyway. That’s not why I wanted to be out there with you.”
Steve moved quickly to put himself between Tony and the door, but before he could get to work on Tony’s restraints an agonizing pressure hammered through his skull. The pain was so sudden that Steve stumbled and dropped to one knee, his hands coming up to grip the sides of his head.
“The sun’s going down…sun’s getting real low!” he boomed, rubbing vigorously at Bruce’s shoulders as the doctor slid to a halt.
Pepper Potts had only spoken to Steve once before today’s meeting. But everything about her appearance – from her impeccably coordinated accessories to the promise of efficiency she had telegraphed with just three taps of her nails against the conference table – tended to confirm his sense of someone who would tighten any ship she was running. Even Steve, who had taken orders from four-star generals, had found his spine straightening when she shook his hand. And considering the finely honed stare she was currently leveling in her boss’s direction, Steve supposed that Tony Stark’s display of nonchalance might have been almost impressive – if it weren’t also so annoying.
He’d have to try again the next morning: no point speculating when fewer than twenty-four hours stood between him and knowing whether some key to his professional salvation was or wasn’t sitting in the basement of an aging Gothic library in Brooklyn. The sensible thing to do would be to put it out of his mind and get back to the midterms he’d promised his American History II students last Friday.
“Hey, soldier,” he murmured. “I would like nothing more than to be thoroughly debauched by you on every surface in this room. But there is still medical equipment attached to your body, so – and I truly cannot believe I'm saying this – seriously, someone call Sorenson, because this is Profiles-in-Courage-level material over here – but maybe we should save some of the heavier lifting until the doctors are done with you.”
“All right,” he said grimly. “We’ve got four hours to turn me into HYDRA bait before I have to rendez-vous. Let’s get to work.”
They glanced back and forth between the tan trench coats and maroon button-downs adorning both Steve and the body buried in the floor.
He held both his hands out to the side to demonstrate. But he had barely gotten his gun pointed toward the ceiling when Steve’s fired, and Tony looked down to see a horrible flowering of red unfolding across his gut.
“Steve,” Tony said, as the other Avengers filed out of the kitchen. “Why are our friends leaving us alone with the pumpkins?”
“Just in case you need back-up for a gig,” he explained. He swiped one finger across the screen to reveal a shortcut to “Call Avengers,” which was accompanied by the exhausted selfie Tony had taken of the group at the shawarma joint. Thor was grinning and had one arm wrapped around a beleaguered Bruce. Clint was smirking and flipping off the camera while Natasha stole his fries. And Steve was smiling, not at the camera but at Tony – a softness in his eyes that he couldn’t believe Tony hadn’t already seen and interpreted.
“Please tell me that’s not what it looks like,” Bruce said. His voice deceptively quiet, but Tony noticed a tinge of green around his neck. Natasha reached out to cover his clenched hands with one of hers.
Tony broke off, unable to complete the sentence. Steve was watching him steadily, his body completely still as if he feared any sudden movement might startle Tony out of talking.
“That’s true,” Natasha piped up from the middle of what had seemed like an entirely separate conversation.
That line of reasoning was still holding up, barely, by the time that Tony arrived at the storage facility, where his car only took a second longer than usual to come to a stop in the first two inches of snow. He took a few moments to prepare himself for the cold - and for the possible disappointment of a wasted trip - and then he bundled up to face the results of his risky cross-town drive.
“Nat?” he asked, using his free hand to push her hair gently away from her face so he could check the cut slicing diagonally toward her left ear.
He couldn’t imagine who would be outside his apartment at 4:00 AM on Christmas morning, but he shoved his feet into his slippers and padded over to open the door. The sight that greeted him – a somewhat bleary-looking Steve Rogers, his hair mussed on one side – caused a momentary, traitorous flutter in Tony’s chest.
“They slipped by all our networks,” Natasha pointed out. “I gathered intel for decades and never heard the name.”
They made their way across the library a second time, and Tony opened the door on the other side to reveal a walkway, books, Persian carpets, and a hole in the floor.
"Yeah, you'd better swear." Tony spun on his heel and marched down the row to where Darcy was now looking resigned to her fate. "You know what I'm going to say, and you also know I have to say it anyway."
Clint had just stepped off the helicopter and begun to make his way in Steve’s direction, but he stopped when May called out his name. Clint turned to look at her, and Steve could see his posture go rigid when she pulled him into a hug. Over her shoulder, Clint’s face looked startled, then alert. As she pulled back, his eyes scanned rapidly across her face, and then his tense expression shifted into a carefully harmless grin.
“So I’m thinking the Mark II ornaments should come with a fail-safe button,” Tony mused, looking up at Steve with his head still resting in the crook of Steve’s arm.
“I want you to have someone,” Steve managed, “who makes you feel at home – the way you make me feel.”
“Obie sold me out,” Tony grimaced, “at the least. At worst…well, you did say HYDRA likes to work from within.”
“Okay, since you’re determined to make this a thing: I hereby absolve you, Steven Grant Rogers, of all emotional support duties, henceforth and in perpetuity. The end. Is that what you need to hear? You’ve made it pretty clear that you’re not interested in being involved.”
“I’m going to stop you right there,” Coulson interrupted, and it really was remarkable how he managed to cut off all possibility of future speech without changing either his volume or his position. “Because I have to ask, first, what earthly explanation you might offer for having hacked into another department’s calendar to look at Dr. Grant’s teaching schedule in the first place.”
When they touched down, a group of agents ran toward them, including a young pair that Steve assumed must be Fitz and Simmons. Simmons took charge of Harrison’s body while Fitz hurried around the other side of the helicopter to collect the battered case from Rumlow.
It had been an offhand comment, but when he looked over, he saw that Steve was regarding him steadily, his face illuminated by the new blaze of the fire.
Tony glared. Any forgiveness he'd been feeling towards Dr. Grant immediately evaporated. "Doing just fine on my own, actually. I wouldn't want to disrupt what must be a very carefully crafted workout." He indicated Dr. Grant's carefully crafted calves. "Thank you, though."
“Or maybe he felt awkward getting involved in your historical crush on Steve Rogers,” Bruce suggested, sighing and surrendering his plate of snacks to Tony.
His body was warm and pliant against Steve’s and for a second, Steve just breathed in the neutral scent that more than anything, resembled a beta’s, but it still made his gut tighten in a distinctly pleasurable way.
Steve frowned. “You’re talking nonsense. I’m a vet with nothing to offer and you are the omega with a dowry and almost no options.” He swallowed. “But if you say a word, I’ll help you get the money and disappear off the face of the earth, no questions asked and no reprimands made.”
“If you don’t start moving, I’ll just tie you up and carry you,” Steve said with all seriousness, and the other guy blanched.
Payne produced a pair of handcuffs and quirked his eyebrow at Tony, who sighed, but held out his wrists.
He was smart, though. It took Natasha almost two weeks to catch up to him. So now, here Steve was, at an auto shop, in the middle of nowhere with his self-sabotaged bike, hoping that he'd interpreted Widow’s message correctly.
After they landed at Reagan Airport, everything happened very swiftly. A detainee transport dictated that they were immediately led to a separate room with Stane’s people already present.
Slowly, very deliberately, Steve pulled in a lungful of air. “That…” he started, held the air in his lungs, then let it out with an almost noisy asthmatic whoosh, “...might be a problem.”
“What's wrong?” Stark’s smile was wry. “How about the fact that two total strangers appear the same day in a place where you can go several weeks without meeting an unfamiliar face and suddenly they're doing everything together. How's that for wrong?”
“How would you interpret, ‘I want the boy off the pills. Knocking him up should keep him in line well enough'?”
“Nah. Got some family here though. The garage owner is my uncle, he happened to need some hospital rest for a bit, so I decided to spend my gap year here. Match made in heaven, really.” There was a brief pause and then Steve heard a quiet murmur, “Harley, darling, talk to me.”
He patted Steve’s cock, which earned him another delicious whimper and a look that was too aroused to accomplish an actual glare it was attempting. Flashing Steve a victorious grin, Tony unhooked the spreader bar from the contraption that was holding it upwards and carefully lowered Steve’s legs back on the bed.
“Here. That’ll keep it.” He patted Steve’s thigh. “I’m going to keep adding to this until you’re feeling nice and full.”
The only warnings I can think of are treating people like things and really heated kissing. If you think I'm missing tags, let me know. :)
Breathing in deep in satisfaction, Tony resumed: soles, calves, the insides of his knees, the wide thigh muscles, his ass. After a while, Steve began to drift. Tony wanted to chuckle.
He took a sip of his beer and leaning back, glanced around the room before bringing his gaze back next to Nat’s head. Her fingers were still on his. She shrugged, still looking into the mirror behind Steve.
“Aww, my poor little boy,” Tony said soothingly now that his own need was satisfied. He caressed Steve’s chest eliciting goosebumps rising on his skin.
“Mr. Stane is entertaining until late tonight,” Kwazoffsky said from the front seat as the car took off from the curb. “So he’ll send a car when it’s safe to return to the mansion. After that you will be relieved of your duties, Marshal.”
Tony waited for the silent confirmation, then continued, “Alright then,” he paused, “Not yet, at least.”
“I… what?” Steve muttered, feeling confused. “But they were…” Sharply, all the blocks of information slotted into place and bile rose into his mouth. “Mr. Stane thought they were narcotics.” But even as he was saying the words, he knew that it wasn’t the truth.
"Okay.” Tony finally gave an impatient half-shrug. “Okay, you win," he repeated. "We’ll try it your way. Make it a real marriage.”
Steve’s feet were now wide apart, hanging above his torso, knees slightly bent, and his beautifully constricted cock framed between his thighs. He whined, then said something, but Tony shushed him gently.
"No, Steve… wait..." Tony said, put his hands around Steve's neck and lifted his legs around his waist—
Tony leaped out, took the man into a chokehold and plunged the needle into his strong neck muscles. The man gasped, grabbed after Tony’s forearm and struggled, but slumped only after two seconds.
The room was big enough for the sound to carry, but where the young, cheerful voice came from was unclear. Somewhere in the back, probably.
Steve huffed. “So yeah, maybe I got a little… elated in there, but I do like you, Tony, okay?” He looked up, eyes searching for the horizon, but it was filled with rows and rows of similar dark roofs. Damn it. He shouldn’t have told Tony that he loved him. Clearly, it was too soon. Hell, Steve would be the first to admit, now that he was thoroughly detoxicated, that having a big crush on the first omega he’d ever interacted with looked a little stupid. "I
They were silent for a beat, then like a purring cat, Tony pressed himself even closer and nuzzled his face into the crook of Steve's neck.
Steve’s chin was on his chest, trying to see what the pile of chains actually was, but despite seeing it perfectly well, he seemed confused.
Tony shook his head. “No. And even if I could, Obie’s too rich and powerful for it to stick properly. The best-case outcome is me getting a lot of psychological evaluation and monitored living conditions that everybody will pretend is to make sure that Obie can’t abuse me. And ultimately I will be pressured to get married as quickly as possible so that the whole scandal could be suffocated and buried.” He glanced at Steve grimly. “No. I think it’s best if I just go alone. Too great a risk for you even if they never catch you.”
Steve stifled his own moan and tried shaking his head before realizing again that it was impossible. Another hard thrust and Steve seemed to be succumbing to the necessity. He was clenching, pushing back, inviting Tony’s cock in.
Steve stared into his omega’s eyes, then sighed happily and nodded. Everything was going to be okay. Happiness made Steve feel powerful. He would protect Tony. Everything was going to be alright.
Natasha smirked. “I'm a novelist. I'm writing about the accident that took place at the mines around here two centuries back.”
“I’ll ungag you for a bit, but don’t scream or I’ll shove it back in, understand?” he asked with a steely note in his voice.
“No, seriously.” Steve was trying to talk quietly so that the rest of the cabin wouldn’t hear them. “Imagine I’m an idiot.”
Purchasing the tickets and the paperwork didn’t take much time. Steve only had to place a phone call to Mr. Stane’s office about their arrival, and soon, Steve was ushering Tony into the food court. Despite the previous devil-may-care attitude, all through getting their food and carrying it to the table, Tony was strangely subdued and Steve started feeling bad for him.
“Think a minute about what you really want here, yeah? Do you want to be sedated for this or do you want to be aware? Because I can work with either. I will beat you and will give you pleasure however and whenever I want, and you will thank me for both. So tell me — do I tranq you or can you behave?”
“Well…” Steve dropped his eyes, not even sure what he was going to say. “It’s not like it would be a hardship to be married to you.” God, he was crazy, was he really offering? Shit. Steve didn't have much. Nothing to offer a rich, smart and beautiful omega—
Tony rolled his eyes. “But then, Obie will know that you breached the contract and you’ll be in trouble.”
“That’s okay, Steve, don’t worry. I can give you a sedative if you feel frightened?” he offered but almost desperately, Steve shook his head. “It’s, okay, it’s okay, I won’t.”
Tony had everything planned and ready. He had the zip ties and ropes, the syringe. Now he was sitting in his van, in a dark parking lot, waiting for his chance. God, he couldn’t wait!
Tony grinned disarmingly, no doubt, to give him an example of how charming he is, but Steve scowled. He realized that maybe Tony was right, the risk was minimal, and yet, the stupid idea of a simpler solution was like poison making his skin itch. Simpler, but also self-serving in the extreme. He couldn’t… It would be idiotic to even voice it. There was no way Tony would ever agree. He watched Tony pour out coffee and tried not to breathe too deeply.
Steve felt unease dribbling from his spine to his toes. Something had tipped Stark off and Steve had no idea what. But they couldn’t just cause a scene in broad daylight. The plan was to capture him after dark from wherever he was staying. Damn.
“So obviously," he went on in a calming tone when Steve started looking at him with a modicum of trust again, "we’ll need to work out some ground rules. First, your place, for now, is this very same bed. You are going to remain here, comfy and safe until I can see that I can trust you. After that happens, you’ll get the privilege to move around this room, and maybe even outside, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, right?"
Tony was forced to do another chest press, resisting the urge to whimper as he eased back down again. "Yep. She reminds me of me at that age. And most other ages. Except I'm a better rapper. You should see me do
“You knew who he was before I even grabbed the mask,” Tony pointed out. “You stopped me from shooting him.”
“It’s about time, man,” Sam said, giving Tony a steady look. “It takes an explosion to get you to talk to him again?”
Of course, this whole process would be a lot easier if he had taken time to catalogue the contents of the unit on the previous visit - or if his dad hadn’t been such a goddamn paranoid hoarder in the first place, Tony amended.
Though, considering how many Cheetos he'd already eaten today, it might be a necessity. He dropped the last neon-orange puff in Dummy's cage for him to find when he deigned to reappear later and grabbed his gym bag.
He was probably going to pay for that later, but for the moment all he could think about was getting to James’ office as quickly as possible. Because if knowing about SHIELD was dangerous, James was in danger. James was the one who’d first mentioned the name to Tony after all - and directly afterward he’d been picked up by men in suits and put into a dark van. Tony had to warn him about what he was dealing with.
Steve wanted nothing more than to relax into Tony’s touch, letting him soothe the aches and stings the way he had in the kitchen that night, but another jagged pulse in his skull reminded him they were on the clock.
because you fill me with incredibly casual, ordinary thoughts. Of course you drive me nuts, you idiot. I’ve been crazy about you for years.”
“Why don’t we let you two work this out while we get the movies ready for later?” Natasha said, standing up and giving Thor a firm pat on the shoulder.
“I know what you’re thinking,” he murmured to Dummy, who was busily nibbling on a much healthier snack in his cage. “But I think we’re still at least three steps away from
“Do you want to pick a floor there, Rogers?” Tony asked, a small smile creeping across his face. “Or would you rather keep ogling my biceps?”
Any trace of stoicism was burned off in a surge of adrenaline, and suddenly Steve needed to get out immediately.
“Test subject Steve Rogers exhibited remarkable results,” the paragraph announced, the letters pressed tightly together as if under stress, “However, after destruction of the remaining materials in the HYDRA attack, Project Rebirth is officially D.O.A. All affiliated research has been classified permanently to protect the identity and unrepeatability of the Captain America initiative.”
Tony took the handles and breathed out as he pressed away from him. He instantly wished he'd taken it down a few more pounds. "Yeah, I think every faculty member at the entire college has Darcy in one of their classes. She's brilliant, but 'focused' isn't a word I'd use to describe her."
He paused to consider the half-eaten bowl of Rocky Road that was partially covering his photocopy of Dum Dum Dugan’s enlistment form.
"This is all shit," he told the hamster who emerged from his pocket, cheeks fit to bursting, and eyed him up. "And I have to stand in front of everyone in two weeks and pretend it's not shit."
Tony stared blankly at the black-and-white image on the screen, his head slumped over on the armrest of the couch and one hand still closed loosely around a now-forgotten file folder. He used the other hand to grope across the table in search of his coffee, only to find that the mug was just slightly out of reach. Immediately giving up the remaining five inches as a lost cause, Tony began contemplating making a third attempt to go to bed, but before he could muster the energy to sit up, he heard a knock at his door.
be there. Tony hadn't actually booked the library space yet, so he had some leeway. Maybe he could find a time when Dr. Grant had class, or professional development, or was on vacation. Then even though he had nothing at all of substance to present, he wouldn't be embarrassing himself in front of his arch-nemesis. At the very least.
The instant when Sitwell shot the explosive into Steve’s skull had felt like having the arc reactor ripped out of its socket. When Steve had dropped to his knee, the bottom of Tony’s stomach had fallen out. And in the end, all of those moments had just been a warm-up for this one: the horrible, never-ending seconds when all Tony’s muscles screamed and locked in protest because Steve was lying on the floor, eyes open, not breathing.
“Spirit!” the terrified voice on Tony’s television called, “hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”
“She works on the floor above us, Tony,” Steve responded. “You’ve met her at least three times. You came over to her apartment last month when I was cat sitting.”
“Open the door,” Tony snapped. He drew his gun, more out of frustration than out of any sense that it would be an effective motivator.
So that’s what he had been doing in Stuttgart – going through the Captain-America motions – when Tony Stark had dropped in and hijacked the mood, music blaring and mouth running as if he were on a one-man mission to demonstrate how out of place Steve was in this century. And that had thawed out something inside Steve all right: confusion, irritation, attraction, anger, regret, terror, and a heady relief he was aware must have been all over his face when Tony finally opened his eyes on the streets of New York. Watching Tony start breathing again was the closest Steve had felt to warm since his plane went down, and also the most exposed.
“Barton says that if you don’t quit making out and get on the bus, he gets to put a margarita maker where the TV used to be.”
“Not anymore,” Steve replied evenly. “Now I’m your protection agent, Mr. Stark. That is, I will be, if you agree to my conditions.”
“I'm glad you stole my keys,” Steve replied with a soft smile. He took a step forward and then paused, staring up at the archway he’d been about to pass through. “You have mistletoe,” he remarked in surprise. “I wouldn’t have thought you’d be the type to decorate.”
