Sherlock slid back, impaling himself on the dildo. He hollowed his cheeks and sucked as he did, looking up at John through his lashes. John was biting his lip.
It was pointless to think about that now. He’d soon belong to a stranger with a ring on his finger instead of a collar around his neck. He wasn’t looking forward to that. His sister had been married off and the stress had driven her to drink. Her poor sub was filing for a divorce.
John frowned. What was he getting into here? His tastes in sex certainly weren’t vanilla by any means, but wax play wasn’t something he’d ever tried. It wasn’t something he’d ever wanted to try either. He was too afraid of injuring his partner or getting injured himself. Serious burns weren’t fun and wax play done wrong could leave scars.
He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to feel about Sherlock’s new attitude to casework. John knew he had to be there for his daughter. But he hated it when Sherlock came back with injuries. Plus, he’d be lying if he said he didn’t miss it. Sure, he still chased down criminals, but it was different tackling blackmailers that had been cornered. Just didn’t give him the same rush that dodging poisoned darts did.
Sherlock knew that John would want some sort of revenge for making him come in his pants when he still needed to go out and couldn’t take a shower. Sherlock just wasn’t sure what form that revenge would take.
“Yeah,” John said without feeling. If this William Holmes person pushed for a sexual relationship he hoped it would be like the one John had with his commander. Sholto had respected John’s no penetration rule and they’d gotten along fine with hand and blow jobs.
Sherlock pouted. He’d never experienced that. He trusted John to do the job properly. To not leave any lasting marks, to not do any permeant damage.
Sherlock opened his eyes and the corner of his mouth lifted in a filthy smile. “John?” he asked in a deep rumbling baritone.
John went tense as he waited and there it was once more. He raised his head and saw Sherlock curl forward into himself.
Sherlock watched the process with wide eyes. John was aroused and he was taking that arousal outside the room.
“You told me you loved me! That you were in love with me!” John shouted. He wanted to say that he was in love with Sherlock and he’d forced a confession. But he held that in. No need to admit his feelings again.
He checked his mobile and saw he had an unheard message. It was the surgery he’d gone to for his test. He phoned them back, sure it was just a formality.
John was terrified Sherlock might get the wrong idea. Yeah, he did come to thoughts of cupid bow lips wrapped around his prick with his hands buried in inky curls but he respected Sherlock. His friend. His best friend. His heterosexual friend.
Sherlock had a slice of toast on its own plate in front of himself and in front of John’s chair. He took the honey and dripped it messily onto his toast, catching his finger in the process.
Sherlock felt the sting when John added another finger. John scissored and stretched and Sherlock shivered expectantly.
Moving up along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh John moved in this time, but instead of brushing over the top of Sherlock’s prick he went lower, tangling the feather in the wiry hair of Sherlock’s bollox.
John waited anxiously. He’d looked up marriage ceremonies so he knew what to expect but he was worried about his new Dom. He’d been peeked in on by an older female Dom (he assumed she was the mother of his future Dom) she’d claimed she’d gotten lost but John knew better. He took comfort in the softness in her expression. He thought she approved.
Sherlock chuckled and John giggled and a piece of plaster from a crack they’d created up the wall fell between them, causing him the laugh harder.
John reached down and took Sherlock in hand. Neither of them had put on pyjamas last night. He rubbed his thumb over the head of Sherlock’s cock, smearing precome around and teasing him.
“I’ve locked up flat B and C, just in case. They seemed trustworthy enough but I can’t have them getting into Sherlock’s things and I don’t want them near his lab.”
John followed Sherlock after picking up the headband. He felt bad about the whole thing. He figured he probably did order the “costume” Sherlock was wearing. He thought the website looked a little odd but he didn’t think anything of it. Really, who actually knew that this was a thing?
People were staring at him, at them. He hated it. His whole family had come for the wedding. His side of the room was full of uncles and cousins and aunts and people he didn’t care for and hadn’t seen for years. His grandmother was giving him a stern look.
“What?” John asked. But Sherlock was already sliding past him. John stepped to the side only to find the door shut in his face.
“Do you want to change or do you want food? We only have time for one,” Sherlock said. He could see John was uncomfortable in his uniform and that he hadn’t eaten at all in at least twelve hours. Either way, he was going to be very uncomfortable at their appointment.
Inside was a new cell phone, a tablet and a dossier that contained the excuses the other members had told the government to explain his absence and official documents he needed including a renewed passport and driving licence.
“Aaah! Sher—! I’m--! Nnguh!” John came, the effort of keeping still made his whole body shake and he was grateful for Sherlock’s hand on his hip as his knees went weak.
John only took a nap, wanting to keep his sleep schedule as normal as it could be when he lived with Sherlock Holmes. He almost felt like this morning had been a dream. It didn’t seem possible, that Sherlock had fucked him and sucked him off at the same time. But he had the evidence of it on his stomach.
Sherlock came out of the shower running a large towel through his curls and had a small towel hanging low on his hips.
“Filthy little creature, you are,” John said, pupils blown wide. He took Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissed him deeply.
The ring, which had been discarded in favour of touching, was retrieved and placed on John’s finger.
Mike Stamford, an old mate from Bart’s. He wanted to catch up and John decided he didn’t want to go back to his depressing bedsit. When Mike inquired about John’s living situation, John regretted his decision. Then Mike mentioned someone who was looking for a flatmate.
“Arugh!” Sherlock arched his back and flinched his foot, drawing it back sharply so it pulled against the restraint.
After a minute Sherlock started shifting uncomfortably. John watched Sherlock’s reflection in the rear-view mirror. He opened his mouth to speak several times before thinking better of it and closing it.
John handed the lube over to his superior and walked up to Sherlock, who’d leaned slightly forward in anticipation. He held his cock in front of Sherlock’s face and Sherlock stuck his tongue out, giving it a little lick.
John walked down to the foot of the bed and stood, not touching Sherlock, letting Sherlock work himself up. Sherlock whimpered and curled his toes and still, John just stood. Sherlock whined out of his nose and balled his fists but that couldn’t get John to just do it already.
It would take a while for NASA to get back to John. John wasn't sure exactly how long, Mary was the one who knew how to look up the satellite positions. He'd had enough training to know how to flip the switch that broadcasted NASA's transmissions to the crew's suits. He did so because he wanted to find the rest of his crew as soon as possible.
Sherlock was well aware that John found him attractive. He had been hitting on him over dinner at Angelo’s, no matter how much he denied it after. But he hadn’t tried again after that. Even mocking Sherlock for when he asked him out during the Blind Banker case. As if Sherlock were so dim-witted as to not know what a date was.
The eulogy continued but John didn’t hear it. He was back in 221B, telling Mrs Hudson that he was getting married, her disbelief and laughter when she learned it was a woman. He’d found it insulting, frankly, considering that she knew he only dated women.
Murry walked in front of John when they got to the main room. John focused on not falling with his cane. His leg ached and he had to grind his teeth to make it across the room.
"Did anyone else survive?" John heard a static crackle and then silence. While he was waiting, John tried to put together what happened that led to him being the first person on Mars (and tried not to get distracted by the fact that he was the first person on Mars). He remembered the alert that said they had an object on a collision course. They were planning on dropping the supplies and using thrusters to avoid a collision. They'd all donned suits in case something went wrong but they'd had plenty of time to act. What happened?
Sherlock sighed. “I’m tired of this game, aren’t you? I turned you down eight years ago. It was a mistake.”  Sherlock was agitated talking faster and faster. “I tried, so many times, to tell you, to show you.” He stood and started pacing.
John’s cock. The suction, the depth, how he still managed to work his tongue… It was the best blowjob of John’s life.
John sat back on his bed. He’d only been back about a month, and already the bills were piling up. He probably shouldn’t have spent all that money smuggling his gun in and helping Harry pay for her divorce. His pension didn’t cover everything, even living in this horrible bedsit. It was old-fashioned but people believed that Doms took care of those things for their subs.
“No, it’s not.” Sherlock felt horrible. Now John would think that either there was something wrong with him or that Sherlock wasn’t interested in John enough to keep an erection.
“Oh, Johnny. I…. Yeah. I would normally. But…. This isn’t like a collaring. Have you even met your new….”
Sherlock nuzzled his nose against John’s crown and pressed his forehead to the back of John’s head. John figured Sherlock’s arm would fall asleep and they’d separate, perhaps allowing a moment for John to hold Sherlock, but Sherlock’s breathing evened out and his arm slowly went slack. Sherlock’s fingers stayed twined with John’s, but only just. John thought he should probably scoot away to save Sherlock pain in the morning. Even though he was loathe to do so, he lifted his head and moved to slide to the side of the bed.
“I know. And I don’t want to make things harder for you. If this could have waited I would have put it off,” John said.
John was livid. “Sherlock Holmes is a bloody saint compared to you lot,” John hissed quietly, trying not to make a scene. He glared at the man before stalking to the elevator.
“Yes!” Sherlock interrupted. He removed the last item he was wearing (a sock) and threw it over his shoulder.
John laid Sherlock out on his front and said, “I’m going to get some cream and some more water. I’ll be right back pet. Ok?”
He climbed the steps with purpose. Sherlock was holding his violin and standing by the window. Probably watching the street for John’s return. Or, maybe he was just emotional and needed to play. It was impossible for John to tell. Sherlock had turned at John’s arrival and looked at him warily. When John strode across the room to him, Sherlock set his violin down.
Sherlock crowded John up against the tile. He kissed John, groaning into his mouth when John reached down between them and stroked Sherlock’s erection. Sherlock broke the kiss to thrust forward. He rolled his head back as John stroked him.
“Yes, sir. Please,” Sherlock could feel himself sink into the fog. This was why they did this, this was why Sherlock pushed John for more, harder, to get here. It was better than the drugs. He was high.
With a shout James came. No one stopped; in fact, it seemed to turn Bill on. He dislodged John, he started thrusting so violently. James stepped back and Sherlock dropped his hand, holding onto the cot instead.
Another hit right between where the last three were and the previous three. It was hard and Sherlock’s whole body moved. His erection and nipples dragged over the sheet, his welts from the crop stung, his whole arse and feet were on fire and he still had pleasant tingles from the belt. The butt plug pounded his prostate and Sherlock could feel the precome rush out of his tip. He cried out, long and high pitched, his back arched and he threw his head back.
Those that had started trouble been kept drugged and had all been collared by their captors. Most of them had either started out so submissive or had been rendered so they’d needed direction to eat and drink.
The clues led them to a nightclub that didn’t open until nine so Sherlock took John home and tried to have sex with him again.
The sub was panting, his hands curling into fists before relaxing then curling again. He was breathing heavily.
God, John was so, “Creative, Ah! So perfect. Ah! God, sir, you’re- Ah! You’re brilliant,” Sherlock was babbling aloud his words cut with cries of pleasure-pain as John rained down blows on his back.
Compared to the rest of the flat, Sherlock’s room was tidy. He didn’t keep experiments here and there was none of the case related clutter. Sherlock only spent time in the room to dress and sleep (and the latter could just as easily happen on the couch).
If you feel the need to write more of this to deliver on everything I should have done I am allowing my account to auto add to collections because I'm not sure works inspired will auto connect? Try that first tho.
A drop of sweat fell from John’s chin onto Sherlock’s nose, joining the sweat running off Sherlock’s brow.
He was in a dour mood when he came home. Sherlock was still asleep so he put the shopping away and did some tidying up though that was half-hearted at best. He really felt that the eels were Sherlock’s problem and Mrs Hudson had been up recently to hoover.
He didn’t know. He wasn’t allowed contact with John until the ceremony. It was an obvious attempt by the government to keep people from deciding they hated each other and fleeing the country. The fact that his marriage was in three days was another sign they wanted to speed things along. It took most people more than three days to up and leave. After the ceremony, they’d be given counselling and there they’d decide where they wanted to live and discuss limits and all the other things Sherlock wanted no part of. Maybe he’d be lucky and this John wouldn’t want to live with him. It wouldn’t be unheard of for a married couple to live apart. As long as the time they spent together equalled three months of the year the government didn’t care. And if John didn’t want to have sex with him he’d be spared talking about limits.
Sherlock didn’t understand. He knew John liked gardening and had one when he was a child and wanted one now but how was that a gift?
John started the shower. Sherlock had wiped him with a wet flannel but he didn’t seem to have done a proper job because John still felt itchy. Sherlock seemed to be a little put out that John wasn’t hard but John wished he wouldn’t be. Just because he didn’t come didn’t mean he didn’t enjoy himself. It made him happy to get Sherlock off.
And now, he’d been injured, again. Because of Sherlock, again. If Sherlock hadn’t gone in there blind John wouldn’t have had to take the metaphorical bullet. What if it was a real bullet next time?
“No,” Sherlock said, picking at the flaking mess. How had it dried so fast? He was still covered in sweat. It was rolling down his back and his hair was plastered to his head. Then he registered what John said and gaped at him. John wanted to help? To spend time with him? Sherlock could be here to review paperwork for all he knew. He was busy, he had responsibilities. Why would he want to spend his precious free time with Sherlock if they weren’t having sex?
He had John step out of one, then the other, removing the socks with the shoes. Then he undid John’s flies and had John step out of his jeans and pants.
But, he’d put a ring on John’s finger. And when that piece of metal slid into place something clicked in Sherlock’s head. John was
Sherlock didn’t seem offended. Whenever John started to slow Sherlock moved his head to encourage John to continue. John didn’t stop when Sherlock turned, resting his back against the bed.
Sherloc followed their Terran throughout the wreckage of his ship. They wanted to touch everything but their Terran had told them not to touch anything and they didn't want to touch the wrong thing and kill their Terran. They were getting sick of calling their Terran "their Terran." It made it very difficult to ignore the fact that they'd claimed him.
John pulled it out and set it aside to be washed. Sherlock walked into the loo and did his business.
“I want him to come to whatever quarters you have set up for me—I’m sure they’re private and out of the way, and…” Sherlock made a vaguely crude hand gesture before saying, “Well, I’m sure you can guess.”
John pounced on him, pinning him to the bed he stroked Sherlock to full hardness roughly. Sherlock fumbled in the bedside cabinet for condoms and lube. When he turned back John’s arse was in his face. He was playing with the plug, moving it in circles, teasing it out but before it was free he pushed it back in.
John was in the sitting room, on the couch. He must have fallen asleep at some point during his show. And Sherlock was there, curled around him like an octopus. Sherlock was on his back and had pulled John down so John was laying on top of him.
Sherlock wasn’t looking for something long distance; he didn’t do relationships. He’d taken the case to pay off a favour. Now Mycroft and he were even. He figured he had at least three days before Mycroft called asking for an update. After Sherlock was
John looked down at Sherlock, who was in the middle of a nap, and smiled. They might have gone the long way round but they ended up in the right place.
“Oh, my god,” he heard and he turned his head. He’d forgotten that the glass from the bathroom was clear, though the angle wasn’t good it didn’t take him to observe that he was masturbating on his bed.
“What?” John asked. He had the same feeling he’d had when they’d met. Sherlock had taken the conversation and moved forward, leaving John stumbling to catch up and desperate to do so.
“Okay?” John asked as he gave himself a leisurely stroke. “We’re… I mean… It’s not going to be easy.” After a moment he asked, “You still want to—”
John was overcome with all the different sensations and Sherlock slipped his finger in. John thrust forward, brushing his cock against Sherlock’s and when he arched back he shoved Sherlock’s finger deeper.
Sherlock yawned and stood, scratching flakes of semen off his side (he’d fallen asleep in dirty sheets). John had probably taken care of himself and when he found the bathroom steamy he was sure of it. He wrinkled his nose grumpily. He’d wanted to take care of John’s erection. He needed to keep John sexually satisfied to show him he could be happy here. So when he proposed John would say yes. Sherlock already had cases for them to work, he could keep John busy and provide a life of danger and excitement and he had more than enough money for the two of them. All that was left was the sex.
. They blinked, looking up at where the head would be on a Terran but all they saw there was a reflective sphere. "Need help; can't breathe," they said and took a deep breath for emphasis. The thing seemed to understand and took their hand, leading them to the wreckage of the large white thing.
"Right," John said and opened his mouth to say more but changed his mind. This discussion could happen at a later time. "Right." John made an about-face and went to find his crewmen.
A touch to his cock made Sherlock moan. John was very careful, not wanting to ruin his experiment. But the leaking red thing was too enticing to leave alone.
John turned around, took the condom from Sherlock and put it on him. Then he lubed it up. Sherlock just reached out and petted John, touching every bit of exposed skin he could reach.
They scratched and bit and tried to dig into the dirt. John wouldn’t let them. He laid himself down over the mud and felt himself start sinking too.
He knew that even though several people had multiple subs the matching system didn’t allow subs to go to Doms that already had a sub collared.
After a moment he decided he was being dramatic. Just because his sister’s match hadn’t worked out didn’t mean his wouldn’t. And the government provided marriage counselling. If the man was truly terrible he could save up for a divorce, and it would be easier to get a job when he was married.
. Omegas smelled sickly sweet. Like the burnt sugar or those toasted marshmallows he’d seen the humans with.
“Shh,” John soothed, and scratched Sherlock’s scalp lightly. He pulled Sherlock’s hair a bit once James’s breathing started to even out.
She could tell he wasn’t going to budge. Sherlock was frowning. She didn’t want an argument so she asked the next question, “Ok, let’s discuss command. How much is too much, how much is too little?” Before they spoke she said, “To give a clear idea, Sherlock, I want you to command John as you would in day to day life.”
Once he had calmed down a bit he removed his arm but kept his eyes on the ceiling. “That was amazing. That was the best blow job of my entire life. You’re brilliant.”
He’d never actually been restrained before, although he’d imagined it plenty of times. It was better than his fantasies.
Instead, he went to their drawer. He showered then he used some of the strawberry lube to put the plug in place and went out to shop.
John had wanted to go off and buy Sherlock a present but he couldn’t leave in the middle of a case for no reason and he didn’t want Sherlock to know he hadn’t gotten him a gift if he didn’t already.
John tried to keep up. He explored Sherlock’s neck, but there was a lot of it and everything Sherlock was doing felt so good.
Sherlock arched his back, oh, yes, this was nearly perfect. Sherlock wrapped his hand around John’s forearm and squeezed.
John’s fingers slid in Sherlock’s hair and massaged his scalp. Sherlock looked up to see John’s head thrown back, mouth open.
“Boring,” Sherlock said. “I’ve already solved two cases relating to paintings and I detest repetition.”
That seemed to surprise Sholto, as Sherlock suspected it would. He straightened his posture into something more professional and said, “Oh, Mr Holmes, we weren’t expecting you personally—”
John was nonplussed. What kind of name was Sherlock? Was it a middle name? He tried not to let his confusion show. “Okay, Sherlock, would you like an apple?”
John grumbled something about being late and accused Sherlock and the sex for it. Sherlock watched from the window as his John left the flat and walked down the street.
Sherlock frowned. “I don’t want to give sex with you if you’re not going to come. Wouldn’t that hurt?”
John scooted across the bed, and with gentle touches rolled Sherlock over. John slid one arm under Sherlock’s neck, and the other he set on his waist. John kissed Sherlock’s spine, just at the base of his neck.
The room stopped spinning for a moment and Sherlock realized this was the serial killer Lestrade was after. He
With each second of John’s silence, Sherlock looked more and more distressed. He tried to hide it, but John could tell.
Sherlock fell like a puppet that strings were cut. He endured it as the wheel ran circles around the sensitive flesh, as it ran back and forth, until no part his flesh wasn’t hot and sporting little red marks.
Sherlock had to spread his legs wide so he wasn’t too tall. He had trouble thrusting and he kept slipping out of the slick channel of John’s thighs.
“Yes,” John said eagerly. “I want a relationship,” he added quickly lest Sherlock get the wrong idea.
Sherlock did and John pushed in. Sherlock had to bend over because John was so short but John checked and Sherlock’s torso wasn’t touching his penis. Sherlock wrapped his ungloved hand around the base of his cock to hold it while he sucked.
“It’s ok, pet, just let it fall. You’re doing so good.” John licked his lips and started running his hand up and down his cock.
Mycroft clicked on the link with unsteady hands. The story covered the astronauts that were headed to Mars and the planes NASA had for the next mission. Mycroft checked the date but it was too late to stop the mission. They'd launched so long ago they'd be arriving any day now. Mycroft ran a search to see if there'd been any of what the humans called solar storms or other disasters in the time they'd been gone in the hopes that the astronauts were deceased but there was nothing. NASA's website updated daily and it seemed the crew was doing well and they were expected to enter an orbit today.
Sherlock tugged, testing his range of movement as arousal pooled in his groin. The angle he had to maintain was slightly uncomfortable, he wouldn’t be able to ignore it. His head fell back and his back arched as he gave in and moaned. He felt his legs splay wantonly.
John’s gasps and panting mixed with the video and Sherlock found himself losing control. His aim with the dildo failed, he moved it in and out as best he could while stroking his cock, working the shaft with a slight twist at the end. John gave up all pretence of watching the video and knocked his laptop to the side so he could watch Sherlock.
“Good,” John said and started gently thrusting. The movement couldn’t have been more than three centimetres back and forth, in and out. But he was deep enough that Sherlock had to focus so John wouldn’t hit the back of his throat.
He kept looking down at John, smiling smugly whenever he caught John adjusting himself. Since the pavement was empty John started doing it just to see that expression. Sherlock was preening and John thought he deserved to be.
Sherlock knew at any point he could command John to touch his penis, to tease it, to expose his glans, to make a fist and move his hand up and down, to take it in his mouth and work it with his tongue until Sherlock came down his throat. The fact that he didn’t, that he let John move slowly, was killing him in the best way.
“Is this your revenge?” Sherlock asked. He found himself half hard already. If John ended it now he’d have to have a wank.
Before John could ask, Mike continued, “I think he likes you. I’ve never seen him so…” he trailed off.
Sherlock said as he swayed his knee back and forth, implying his legs would spread but still keeping the bit John was trying not to stare at covered.
John took his normal seat, the bench in front of the window and Sherlock relaxed. It would be very hard for John to get down on one knee in front of Sherlock in that seat.
The sexual scores were promising. It wasn’t rare for a sub to be more submissive inside the bedroom than in day to day life. And with John’s scores, it was possible that Sherlock would be able to get him into subspace with careful planning.
He was paying attention though and he was frozen. That wasn’t a bill. Oh, no. Only one thing came in a bright orange envelope.
Sherlock frowned at him. He thought they already established that. “Yes,” he said when John didn’t say anything.
Special thanks to my beta for looking this over. I messed with it after they had a look so all mistakes are my own.
With a fast motion, the cabbie’s hand moved and Sherlock felt a sharp stab in his arm. He reeled backwards, seeing a hypodermic needle, the plunger pressed all the way down. Sherlock yanked it out and threw it from his body. Too slow, his reactions were normally exceptional, but he’d had too much wine and the orgasm didn’t help.
“Yes,” John said. They’d met before as she’d visited Baker Street on multiple occasions, but John was the forgettable one and he’d grown used to it.
Sherlock didn’t want John to think of any threats. Because the threats John would think of would involve withholding sex or ending their new relationship.
Sherlock pulled off at the last minute with a frown. He worked John through his orgasm with his hand.
Sherlock unravelled himself, leaning over to examine John’s neck, sniff his breath, smell his hair, examine his nails, doing all that without moving enough to wake him was difficult and Sherlock carefully placed his hand between John’s legs. He noticed something interesting as he did.
John pursed his lips. He couldn’t. He’d ruin it. Sherlock might put up with his PTSD for a while, but eventually John would go too far. Even if Sherlock stayed through it, John would have to look at the bruises and live with the knowledge that he’d done that.
“Patience,” Sherlock said, nipping on John’s ear. He moved his hand back under John's shirt and stoked up and down his flank.
John’s legs were shaking, his breathing was laboured. He felt like he might explode. God, he needed something to thrust into. He reached underneath himself, grasping for his cock, wanting to get off with Sherlock’s tongue in his arse.
Sherlock stood and explained quickly. “It’s a gay engagement ring. It’s supposed to sit on your ring finger there. It’s a new idea. I've got one too, at home.”
This was getting out of hand. He thought that maybe he should stop, that they should take it slow. Have some time to process their new relationship before having sex. He stood over Sherlock, looking at the tent in Sherlock’s trousers, his flushed cheeks, his dark eyes, his swollen and moist lips.
The creature moved away and John came out of the spell he'd been trapped in. "I need to contact NASA. Don't touch anything," he told the creature and picked up the radio.
The air sang and a loud crack sounded. Pleasure erupted over Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock mewled and writhed on the bed. “Twenty,” he said reverently.
At that question, Sherlock’s eyes lit up and John realized that sometime soon he’d be experiment fodder. This was one experiment he didn’t mind participating in.
Sherlock rolled his hips and gripped John’s cock tighter, working him rougher. He could feel himself getting close. He looked up to John.
It was quiet for a few seconds and John asked less tentatively, “Where are we going? We have an hour before our session.”
So he pulled back, disappeared and caused a sharp pain to blossom in Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock gasped and it seemed to take him longer than it should have to realize John was using the Wartenberg Pinwheel on his nipple. Sherlock arched off the bed, writhing.
John, according to his deductions, was fierce, loyal, romantic, dangerous, and (relatively) smart. There were things he was hiding and things that Sherlock couldn’t quite get a read on yet.
The words made the Dom’s expression sour. John was surprised. His original expression hadn’t indicated that he found John unsuitable. Did John do something to make that change?
Presently, the woman was needed to say goodbye to someone or something and John made his escape. On the train he texted a goodbye to Mrs Hudson, using his daughter as an excuse even though Molly had said she could watch her all weekend.
Sherlock leapt out of his seat and when it became clear that John wasn’t going to get back on the couch Sherlock helped him kneel.
John smiled back at him and then was tackled and pushed onto his back. He looked up just in time to turn his head for a messy kiss. John allowed Sherlock to take control. He was swept up in Sherlock’s passion. Sherlock kissed and nibbled and stroked and groped and John just tried to hold on for the ride.
Water dripped from his erection and Sherlock leaned forward to lick. John jumped and a stream of water hit Sherlock’s face instead of John’s back.
“If it’s too much you’re supposed to tell me!” John said angerly. He carefully checked Sherlock’s head and examined his eyes.
What was he wrong about? Did he read that John was considering a relationship with him? Was John about to be turned down? Would Sherlock tease him for thinking he had a chance?
Sherlock breached him and John yelled into the pillow. He bit into it, wanting to keep quiet for Mrs Hudson’s sake below them.
John’s hand blurred as he worked himself and Sherlock had to stop John’s muscles seized so much and John’s mouth opened in a silent scream and his back bowed as he came. Come splattered over Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock looked stunned, and John took the expression as a good sign. Since he didn’t look repulsed or embarrassed, John continued, “I know you’re married to your work. I don’t know if you said that because you’re not interested in me, or if you’re just not interested in a relationship. Either way, it doesn’t matter. While you were dead, my biggest regret was that you didn’t know, that you’d never know. Nothing has to change between us. I—”
“Alright, alright,” John said. He knelt and pulled apart Sherlock’s arse cheeks. The dark furled hole had a few hairs around it.
John ran the feathers over the right side of Sherlock’s ribcage and down tracing patterns into Sherlock’s sides. Sherlock clenched his abs willing his transport to ignore the input, to not flinch away, to endure. John moved the feathers up into Sherlock’s armpit and Sherlock shouted a laugh. Sherlock’s legs tense and John watched his toes curl.
There was the sound of clothing being removed in a rush but Sherlock barely registered it. His neck was being attacked -- licks, kisses, suction, and bites were peppered up and down it and then James started working on his collarbones and his shoulders. All through this, Sherlock was able to make small thrusts against James’ abdomen, but he didn’t have enough movement to do anything other than tease himself.
“Careful!” John said to James. He pushed on Sherlock’s shoulder and forced him down slowly, impaling him on James until James bottomed out.
“Patience, beautiful,” John murmured as he dragged the feather down, around Sherlock’s kneecap and up along the outside of Sherlock’s thigh. The feather caught on Sherlock’s leg hair and Sherlock’s muscles jumped as he tried to stay still.
“I…” John didn’t know what to say. He still couldn’t believe this was happening. How had he gotten here?
Well, she’d hoped for more but clearly, she wasn’t going to get it. She decided to change the subject. “And what is your profession, Sherlock?”
The crime scene had just enough information for Sherlock to get a lead. Whoever the murderer was they were smart. Not brilliant, this person didn’t want to get caught. Sherlock was excited. He detailed the clues for John. John found it helpful when Sherlock did this when he wrote up his blog entries.
“John said you’re having trouble coming. I think I know the problem,” Bill said. He whispered into Sherlock’s ear, “You need to be the centre of attention, don’t you?”
Sherlock removed John’s shirt, draping it half inside the sink and dropped to his knees. John swallowed but Sherlock wasn’t about to give him a blow job. He’d turned his attention to John’s shoes and was undoing the laces.
Well, Sherlock wasn’t going to tell John to be quiet. He rather liked hearing him gasp, moan and shout below him. And when he screamed it made Sherlock’s toes curl.
“Condom?” John asked. He wasn’t sure whether they needed one or not but it was always better to be safe than sorry.
John chatted happily with Sherlock while they walked to Angelo’s and Sherlock tried to keep up but he was busy watching John, deducing every little action, searching for a sign that John was going to steal Sherlock’s thunder and propose.
However, he wasn’t going to just walk away either. He had singled out Watson. Blond, muscular, in uniform, high enough up that he liked giving commands and had access to medical lubricant (in fact, Watson had some on him now). After following him a bit he’d deduced that he had a lover on base (but it wasn’t serious) and that he occasionally slept with others; he was bisexual and career military, and, based on his walk, he had a huge cock.
Of course, he’d just orgasmed. He’d be too sensitive to have sex now. Sherlock didn’t feel he was aroused enough to be this addlebrained.
John snorted. Though he found no argument and was happy to sit and take a nap while Sherlock watched what was obviously a deserted house.
“Please, please, Sherlock…” John begged when Sherlock started dragging his tongue along the vein on the bottom of his prick. Sherlock wasn’t holding John’s cock and it bounced around with every light lick. It struck John that Sherlock was a virgin, he didn’t know what he was doing. John thought Sherlock was far too good at that to have never done it before. But he clearly hadn’t and the fact that John was his first, the first cock to ever touch those perfect lips…
Sherlock spun around the room and took a seat in one of the armchairs. John decided on the couch. He couldn’t decide if he was disappointed Sherlock hadn’t selected the couch so they could sit together or if he was glad Sherlock had given him space.
“Green, sir. Please, spank me harder.” He knew it’d wind John up and he was right, John groaned from his spot behind him.
Regarding the hooks on the wall and whatnot, this is a kinky universe. I imagine all sorts of things would be normal fixtures in master bedrooms.
“Yes,” John said. He had a bad feeling about where this conversation was going. “Why were they in your flat to begin with?”
He took Sherlock’s cock back into his mouth and worked his way down until his lips were touching his hands. He twirled his tongue around Sherlock’s cock, licking away all the lube and teasing Sherlock’s skin and precome. John took Sherlock’s bollox in hand and massaged them gently.
And Sherlock relaxed further. John was clearly looking out for him. Nothing horrible would happen. He’d deduced this, he knew this. John cared about people; he wasn’t cruel and he didn’t like seeing people hurt, a deduction Sherlock had factored in subconsciously. Sherlock had been looking for a bit of rough sex and had decided on John, thought he was perfect. Sherlock wanted rough, not to be abused.
“Oh, fuck,” John said, and added his other hand too. They carded through Sherlock’s curls a bit before they pulled.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. He spun and opened the door. “The address is two, two, one B Baker Street.” And with a click and a wink he left.
“Come along, John,” he said without any of his command. He’d gotten used to not using it since when he did he could make other Doms drop to their knees. He decided it was good he hadn’t, if he made John drop to his knees it might hurt him.
She stood and glared at him, “Sherlock Holmes, you are an omega. The sooner you accept your place the happier you’ll be.”
John only paused when he heard a sound. Sherlock didn’t move to make him continue so John started to pull his hand away when he heard it again.
That earned him a sharp slap to his thigh and he looked down to see Sherlock’s lips glossy and rubbed red slipping up and down along his shaft.
Rosie threw a plastic ball at John’s head and he narrowly avoided it. “Sorry, I know. I’ve been a bit busy.”
Sherlock tried to hold in a laugh but he couldn’t, he broke into laughter and John started giggling. Mary wasn’t a beard, not really, but god, she hadn’t suited John at all! They fell against each other and the wall of the entrance to Baker Street. Sherlock started mocking some of John’s old girlfriends and John was laughing so hard his ribs hurt. They slid down until they were sitting on the floor, arms wrapped around each other.
John made a small involuntary noise in the back of his throat and took one of Sherlock’s wrists in his hand. He tied a knot around it with the end of the scarf. It wasn’t one of the normal bondage knots, the ones where you could pull an end and slip free.
“Husband?” John guessed at finishing her sentence. When she didn’t say anything he assumed he’d guessed correctly. “No, of course not.”
The counsellor wondered if she should open an investigation. The sub was clearly abandoned. But, this Dom was very attentive. It looked like the sub would recover as long as he had his Dom. She made a note to have health and human services check up on them in a month or two.
“She texts me occasionally, to tease me for being in the closet or to encourage me to come out to you.” He put the phone down on the bedside table. “I just informed her we’re together.”
He was braving the crowds today, putting up with the lights and sounds and people to find a Christmas present for John. He had been thinking of an antique doctor’s bag but after John losing his job—and it being partially Sherlock’s fault (though not really)—Sherlock rather thought it might be a bad idea. Everything he thought of while he was in the flat he’d discarded. He thought that maybe, if he went out, he’d stumble across something.
“No, you need to go now,” John said firmly. Then, in a more gentle tone, he asked, “Do you want me to remove the massager?”
Sherlock licked his lips. He wanted to strip John but he settled for taking off his own clothes. Naked was good, naked meant they got to have sex.
John threw himself over Sherlock and held him. He was partly protecting the idiot from further sniper fire, but mostly he was so grateful that Sherlock was alive to hold that he couldn’t make himself let go.
“I just need to make sure you’re not bleeding. And you need to flush your urethra.” John wasn’t into watersports.
John looked down at the creature in his arms. The person seemed to be in their mid-twenties and they looked like they'd been carved from marble. They had a surreal beauty that the contrast between their dark hair and fair skin seemed to emphasize.
Sherlock huffed and scrawled his name at the bottom of the sheet. He was about to put the package aside so John could come and deal with it when he saw the return address. It had the word Pokemon in it.
Sherlock opened his eyes and John marvelled at him. Pale skin with a pink flush slightly glistening with sweat, eyes large and dark, his white teeth biting into his plush red lip. Dark curls hallowed his head, frizzy and tousled.
Ok, I made all the medical stuff up. If none of this works that way chalk it up to the au part of this au. :P
Sherlock gasped and watched as John worked his way down Sherlock’s cock. John fondled his testicles and looked up at him. Then he hollowed his cheeks and worked up and down.
Sherlock looked over, brow furrowed. He looked John up and down before his eyes lit with understanding. The corner of his mouth quirked up and he turned back to the phone.
It had been crumpled and smoothed - the crease folding it in half was worn - showing it had been read many times.
John looked up in horror; O'Murtagh had rolled within reach of an airlock. "No! You'll kill us all," John cried out.
When John hesitated, torn between following the order and wanting to protest but being unable to, Sherlock said, “Don’t worry about the landlady, she knows better than to disturb us.” He knew John’s worry, that he’d get caught naked would dominate his thoughts and he wouldn’t think about his leg at all.
John swatted him away. “You’ve killed me, Sherlock. Sucked all the energy right out of me. Succubus,” he accused.
John could feel his orgasm building. He chased it, resting his back on the brick of a building so he could thrust better. Sherlock started twisting his hand and it lit a fire in John’s cock. Pressure built in his testicles and he muffled his shout with his arm as he came.
John groaned and his knees buckled. He locked them before Sherlock had to do anything to keep him upright.
“No, it’s wonderful, Sherlock. I just—” John lunged forward and cut himself off by pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock wanted to tease John, to play with him in his cage and John wanted that too so he didn’t allow it.
He found Sherlock there, waiting for him. The house was otherwise empty, the bed by the front door, the boxes and strangers were gone.
He took John’s erection in hand and bent forward until his lips were wrapped around the head. Then he held John in his mouth while slid in. He couldn’t get fully seated. He slid out and at the same time, he lowered his head, taking in more of John’s cock. He kept one hand on John’s cock and one on John’s hip.
John waved the apology off. He didn’t know if Mycroft was lying but if he was it wasn’t worth the effort to argue.
“So, I believe he conned you into a scheme. Got you to go along with him because you’re in a tight spot.” Her
was etched into Sherlock’s skin. He kissed up and down John’s neck, licking the sweat from his skin, biting little marks of his own on John’s body. The ones he’d left before were still vibrant.
Sherlock tried to stay awake but John took him upstairs and put him to bed. He hadn’t slept at all during the case where John had stolen a nap whenever he could. John knew Sherlock had some plan for John in his cage so he didn’t take the keys from Sherlock’s neck.
John wasn’t asking if Sherlock loved her if Sherlock wanted to keep her. No, he was asking if Sherlock knew she wasn’t John’s.
They moved together, finding a rhythm quickly and abandoning it just as quick. Sherlock started feeling on edge and he could tell from John’s cock and face that he was close too. Sherlock pushed on John’s hip with one hand. John got the message and sat back on his heels so Sherlock’s mouth was free.
John’s cock was red, pushing out around the rings as it tried to get hard. Clear fluid dripped from the tip.
After the service he didn’t have a chance to ask, and John didn’t want to corner her at the wake. He was just wondering how inappropriate it would be if he went snooping when her niece came up to him.
The water-based lubricant was starting to get sticky and Sherlock felt John’s movements drag. This couldn’t go on much longer without risking getting sore.
They chatted. Mrs Hudson’s sister was doing poorly, and Mrs Hudson wanted John’s medical opinion on the different treatment options.
“Mrs Hudson’s…?” he trailed off, unsure of their relationship and not wanting to say something maudlin like
With a deep breath, John tried to focus the conversation. “Well, I went over there but no one answered the door. Called Mrs Hudson but she said she was visiting her sister, been there for a week, and hasn’t seen Sherlock since you took him on ‘one of his little family outings.’” John couldn’t help but use a mocking tone when he borrowed Mrs Hudson’s euphemistic phrase. He didn’t understand why Eurus was still alive, let alone why the whole family visited her regularly.
John guessed that Sherlock was going to be pretty noisy so they went upstairs. John set his tools on a nightstand away from the bed so they wouldn’t get tipped over.
John mulled that over. He looked upset, but Sherlock deduced he was more upset about wasted time. That he would have made another move, tried again if only he’d known.
With a whimper John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock and started moving it up and down, the grip strong and tight.
John was squirming below him, face bright red in embarrassment. Sherlock figured he probably felt like a teenager, getting caught snogging on the couch by their parents. Sherlock himself wasn’t fussed. They weren’t being quiet, Mrs Hudson probably came up just to catch them at it. She’d have the best gossip at her next game of bridge.
Sherlock pulled him down into the bed with him and John watched Sherlock doze for a bit before picking up his book and reading. He wanted to be right here when Sherlock woke. Because it had been a Dom/sub scene and Sherlock might drop, because Sherlock might have hurt himself and John wanted to be there to see the signs if he did and because John didn’t want to be anywhere other than right at Sherlock’s side.
It seemed Sherlock could deduce his thoughts. He said, “Look, just a scratch. I’m fine. I’m not going anywhere.”
The counsellor was alarmed. She looked through her notes but didn’t see anything that would account for this reaction. He had a sister who was a Dom. He shouldn’t be reacting this way to a simple command.
It tickles me that it’s canon that John Watson shaves his legs. I know it was for The Hobbit but still!
Sherlock watched John flop onto the bed. His eyes raked over John’s glistening body, flushed and slightly twitching, his cock spent and slightly moist and Sherlock was struck by the realization that he had done this. He’d brought John pleasure.
“I can’t think of a better place to be,” Sherlock replied lazily. He lifted his hips as much as he could, grinding his crotch against John, just in case John didn’t understand.
Sherlock did the same, throwing his clothing from his body as he followed John. He was nearly naked when John stopped and grabbed him. John kissed him soundly before throwing him back onto the bed.
Of all the things John thought he’d say he hadn’t been expecting that. He’d expected excuses, lies or even changes of subject, not this.
Soon the man was sitting on a prick while the captain was sucking his dick and he was sucking the major’s.
Their hands were rough as they moved over his body, bits of roughened skin catching on his arm and chest hair and callouses scraping his sensitive nipples. The room was filled with the sounds of their heavy breathing and moans.
Hollowing his cheeks John looked up at Sherlock causing him to swear. John rubbed the spot just under the glans with his tongue as he bobbed and felt Sherlock’s testicles tighten.
"No one is here," Sherloc said. They were wondering if their Jawn was injured and was seeing Terrans were there were none.
“Someone’s got to protect you,” John said. “Going in there blind. What were you thinking? There could have been anything in that flat.”
Sherlock worked him through it and when John hissed with oversensitivity Sherlock wiped his hand on John’s trousers.
“That’s great!” John said. Molly hadn’t really gotten over Sherlock telling her he loved her. Her smiles since had been a bit watery.
The funeral for Mrs Hudson’s sister was nice. Not as nice as the fake one for Sherlock had been, or the one for Mary. It was good and John was able to stomach the ceremony. Mrs Hudson cried quietly on his shoulder as people spoke until it was her turn.
He looked at his oversized jumpers and jeans and wondered what he should wear. He decided on a nice button up and his best fitting jumper, a cable knit beige affair. He took out his best jeans and his good shoes. He only had a dark denim jacket, he’d been intending to get a real coat next month. Still, he took it so he wouldn’t get cold. He knew his Dom wouldn’t be impressed but at least he could show that he took care of himself.
He looked at the man standing with an umbrella. John had hoped to have the upper hand by having a weapon (his cane) but no luck there. The man across was clearly a Dom and John didn’t know what training he had. With a bum leg, a shaky hand and no Dom himself he was about as weak as he could get.
“You promised you wouldn’t leave, you dick,” John shouted at him. He threw off his pack and made it over to the menace through sheer force of will.
To make things worse (worse?), last night in his drama his favourite couple finally got together in a steamy sex scene. Then Sherlock’s toes had flexed and wiggled and John completely lost it. Sherlock must have deduced that John had gone to the loo to masturbate. He had to have. It was Sherlock.
“Shut up, we can’t all be killed in action by terrorists while carrying out secret missions for MI6,” John said and pulled Sherlock into a hug. “Some of us had children to raise.”
He wasn’t looking forward to telling Sherlock this. It wasn’t the worst news, Chlamydia was easily cured with antibiotics, but it wasn’t going to be a comfortable conversation.
He wasn’t okay. But that’s not what John was really asking. “It was the best sex of my life,” Sherlock said.
He removed the peas, dropping them to the ground, and he quickly worked the rings off John’s cock, one by one.
“John!” Sherlock said, demanding he come back and let him have at that erection and the rest of John with it.
“I should get dressed,” Sherlock said. John was interested but his embarrassment from being caught by Mrs Hudson would persist and he wouldn’t be as uninhibited as Sherlock wanted him to be.
There was a little manoeuvring as James wanted Sherlock to give him some attention first, so Sherlock sucked him down to the root, hollowed his cheekbones and drooled, but his heart wasn’t in it. It was distracting him from his own pleasure. A drop of sweat rolling down his back tickled him.
The drag of James’ huge prick was wonderful; the angle on his prostate wasn’t perfect, but it was stimulation. Now James’ grip around his cock was too tight. Sherlock huffed out his nose in annoyance.
“My shift started fifteen minutes ago. God, I’m a mess. This is going to be miserable.” He sighed and scratched his stomach, where he’d gotten Sherlock’s semen dried across it. “Oh, well. Nothing for it now.” John rambled as he pulled on his clothes. Once he had the jacket in place he looked at Sherlock.
Sherlock writhed a little and wrapped a hand around his erection. He nodded his head as he panted. John still waited and Sherlock felt his toes curl. “Yes. Please.”
Bill laid flat, his knees bent over the end of the cot and had Sherlock straddle him. There was plenty of lube and Sherlock was still stretched, so it was easy to sink down. Sherlock bounced a couple times, angling his hips so Bill hit his prostate before John caught his swaying cock and started sucking again.
John wasn’t going to pretend Sherlock was a saint, especially after that car ride. Plus he was still a little peeved at him for the gunshots this morning. With two officers after him, it likely wasn’t an acephobic, homophobic or a biphobic thing. He knew how irritating consultants were in the army. Especially when they refused to follow protocol. Still, this bullying needed to stop.
“Thaaans,” Sherlock slurred out. He blinked and wondered why he wasn’t getting more. He had to focus to get out the question, “More?”
Still, he much preferred Sherlock’s cleaning of his wounds than some nurse’s. Especially as he’d have to tell them what happened.
He smiled happily as he hung up. He had a special meal planned and over dessert he’d tell Sherlock about his beekeeping plans. It would be perfect.
John woke, yawning widely. He was firmly entangled in the clutches of his favourite creature, the Sherloctopus. John was fairly certain he’d never tell Sherlock his little nickname for him when he cuddled because then the cuddling might stop and he wanted it to continue. He didn’t have nightmares when he fell asleep in Sherlock’s arms. He felt safe.
He made a mental note of the licence plate, storing it in his mind as the cab pulled away and down the street. John might have been stuck against this wall, but he wasn’t commanded to not call for help. He fumbled with his mobile, dialling 999 with shaking hands.
Sherlock dropped to his knees, took John’s face in his hands and kissed him, licking into his mouth and pushing and pawing at John until John was on his back.
He attached his buttonhole, making sure the flowers sat perfectly. Mummy would skewer him if he didn’t do this properly.
Sherlock relaxed and revelled in the sensation of his sub touching him. John’s movements were near worshipful as they avoided the obvious erogenous zones and dragged across Sherlock’s arms after he was done with the torso.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He didn’t understand why John had to compliment him all the time. He wasn’t traditionally beautiful, in fact, he looked a little weird, but then, love blinded people.
“Ah…” Sherlock needed to say something, to do something. John was waiting for him. John depended on him. This sub, this person he’d only met today, was his responsibility,
Lestrade hadn’t teased John about the marks all over his neck. Just said, “About damn time,” (which made Sherlock strut around the scene proudly) and moved on to the case.
John decided to keep his suit on as he opened the door to the craft. He didn't know the extent of the damage yet and he wasn't as sturdy as the creature he'd saved. The creature hovered behind him like an annoying fly as he made his way through the spacecraft. Several times John had to stop the creature from reaching out and touching things. But John thought they were just curious because whenever he caught the creature's hand out they stopped.
John sat down, sitting stiffly as he watched his show. Sherlock watched too, hyperaware of his flatmate next to him.
There was no arguing with Sherlock when he was like this. John gave in and removed his shoes, socks and jeans. Sherlock knelt between his legs and John swallowed thickly. Sherlock carefully blotted away dried blood with a cold flannel. Sherlock was methodical yet gentle. There was nothing inherently sexual about the act but John felt worshipped.
John was staring down, his mouth open to try to get more oxygen. This could not be happening. His Dom was giving him a blowjob without John having to earn it somehow.
it. He fell forward against John’s leg. He needed to feel him. To smell him. To be connected to him.
“Good,” John said. Yesterday they’d agreed that he’d be able to try and make Sherlock come untouched.
Sherlock stood, sending his stool clattering to the ground. “No,” he says with finality; as if he argued enough it wouldn’t be true.
Sherlock yelped. Then he lifted his head to wipe the spit from his lips and chin. He’d left it there, pretending it was come.
Therefore, John was naked sooner than Sherlock was. It wasn’t bad for Sherlock’s plan, John was thoroughly distracted. The problem was that Sherlock was starting to get self-conscious. He knew he wasn’t traditionally attractive, his features a little too sharp and alien for most people. Those who were able to look past that lost interest at his caustic personality.
Two hands groped at his arse, pushing into pained flesh and pulling his arse cheeks apart. The butt plug was twisted and pulled in and out.
He decided to change the subject. He kissed across John’s chest, noting every scar and freckle in his mind palace.
John knew he could lie, he could find someone off the street and say he was already collared and he had forgotten to inform the government. But that would be punishable by fines. The Dom was supposed to register the collar before asking the sub and if the sub accepted they were to go sign the paper after the ceremony. People acted spontaneously with collaring all the time and the law really wasn’t enforced unless one of the people had been matched.
Manoeuvring onto one knee Sherlock knelt before John and opened a ring box. Inside was the ring John had picked out. “And you’re an essential part of it.”
They tried again, turning so the spray hit both of them but it washed whatever they tried to use as lube down the drain.
The cab door opened and John, already torn between running to help his Dom and maintaining a tactical advantage, froze.
“My sister was brave - far braver than me - though I thought I was the brave one.” She smiled sadly, talking about how her sister had met the love of her life in elementary school, how they courted until they graduated before marrying and having children. She had thought her sister mad, tying her life to a man without playing the field. “She told me, she said, ‘That man loves you, and if you toss him aside because you think you’re too young you’ll regret it.’”
Sherlock couldn’t bounce on Bill’s cock without risking the cock in his mouth, so Bill spread his legs, spreading Sherlock’s further and thrust, holding Sherlock’s hips up and pushing them down. John caught on quickly and he worked Sherlock with his mouth and hand. Sherlock could feel John’s other hand brush his testicles every once in a while; then he felt John’s fingers at his entrance and John moaned.
Sherlock even seemed to enjoy it, as if she hadn’t tried to kill John just as she’d killed his childhood friend.
John's life was in shambles. He'd been shot trying to save a soldier. He'd heard the call to retreat but didn't heed it, he could save the other sub, he just needed time, a few seconds was all. John looked up and blinked rapidly. He wasn't going to think of all the brave soldiers who were gunned down trying to save him. He wasn't going to think about how the other sub, his friend, died anyway because there was no other doctor to help. John unclenched his fist and set about doing the exercises that didn't seem help the tremor.
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed and straightened his sleeves again. He wished he’d looked up what the ceremony involved. He’d been to Mycroft’s but he’d mostly deleted it. He was regretting that now. He didn’t want to look foolish but he was unprepared.
“John! We have to go again!” he demanded he had to compare it to the face John made when he when coming in his pants after a case.
for asexual like John would have assumed from the packet. It was a nice that his Dom thought he’d like taking it up the arse but in his experience people thinking they’d like it and people actually liking it were completely different. And, it honestly looked like his Dom had just said random stuff to ensure he wouldn’t be matched. It wouldn’t be unheard of.
Sherlock was trying to get the tail unlodged. When he saw John he threw on a dressing gown and knotted it tightly around his waist.
Honestly, he was a little surprised he was allowed to have sex with Sherlock. He’d always thought he didn’t have a chance. If Sherlock wanted to experiment sexually with him he was more than willing to participate.
Sherlock gagged a bit at how fast John’s cock moved out of his throat. He rolled onto his back and spread his legs.
The sexual score was alarmingly low for someone with the other scores. John double checked and there was a little
Sherlock bit his lip and whined out of his nose and so John moved up. John bypassed Sherlock’s cock, dragging the feathers up along the sides of Sherlock’s abs, tracing the inside of Sherlock’s rib cage and tangling the feathers in Sherlock’s sparse chest hair.
“Relax, I don’t want anyone then you,” Sherlock said. As exciting as it would be to do this with another person Sherlock didn’t share. John was
written across its suit. That Terran raised the pipe and was about to bring it down on their Jawn's head. The Terran O'Murtagh was clearly the Terran female’s killer.
John frowned. Those were Sherlock’s initials. Did he not want to be flatmates, then? Before John could get too worried, another text came in.
“Five,” Sherlock groaned as the belt hit up along his spine. He was tempted to lean up into the hits but John would just tell him to lay down. He wanted to be good for John so he held still.
Of course, he wouldn’t know that Sherlock had been staring at John’s arse the entire time he’d walked out in front. Admiring his legs in those dark jeans, licking his lips as he pictured the muscles in John’s broad shoulders as he moved. Thinking about John’s cock and how it would look. Would it match John, be short and wide? Or would it be thin and grow to an impressive length? How would it feel when John breached him for the first time?
"What are you talking about?!" John asked as he held O'Murtagh's arm so the latch was just out of reach. "You'll go down as one of the first people on Mars!"
John couldn’t resist kissing him again, more teeth than tongue this time. Sherlock fought his restraints and John needed to discourage that.
He’d needlessly exposed Sherlock to an STI, he’d not thought about getting him a Christmas present, he’d denied that Sherlock and he were dating even though they’d said, “I love you,” to each other on multiple occasions.
Sherlock sucked and licked, rolled John’s bollocks with one hand, massaging them. Then he pulled off, looked up at John and used his other hand to massage the head of his prick.
They both groaned as John breached him. Sherlock bore down but John didn’t go any faster. He tried to scoot but all he managed was to angle his hips so that John hit his prostate as he pushed in.
His hands went to his flies and in no time he had John’s hard cock out. He dove for it, taking it deep into his mouth causing John to swear.
“Well spotted, John.” Sherlock ignored John’s eye-roll and narrowed his eyes, trying to deduce why John seemed so uncomfortable.
Sherlock looked up at John and scanned him head to toe. New haircut, shaved recently, nice sweater, date shoes, a stain on the cuff of John’s jeans…
He knew what he was supposed to do theoretically, he’d been through all the sex ed classes in school and med school and the refresher with the counsellor, but now that it was time to put that knowledge into action he was frozen.
Sherlock was incandescently happy. His sub was plodding along beside him, reaching down and trying to adjust himself rather frequently. His mouth always made a little frown when he did but his eyes were bright and Sherlock was rather pleased with himself. He’d gotten John to come in his pants and now anyone they came into contact with would know—well, maybe not, they weren’t observant.
John woke warm. There was a weight on him but he didn’t feel trapped, he felt safe. He cuddled into the warmth, thinking he could enjoy a lie-in. He deserved a break once in a while. He didn’t often get an opportunity. Sherlock was between cases at the moment and he didn’t have to go to work. There was nothing on.
After getting Rosie some medicine he managed to get her back to bed. She was so miserable she didn’t even ask who was at the door.
John rolled his hips and Sherlock moaned. He felt no need to keep quiet and he encouraged John with loud vocalizations.
Sherlock stopped mid-sentence. He didn’t think he blushed, because all the blood in his body was rushing south. It had been a very long time since he’d heard John call him brilliant like that.
Sherlock fucked himself on the dildo wildly and came with a shout not a minute later. When he was spent he slid forward and freed himself from the dildo. He winced as he stood, his knees ached. The towels and blanket weren’t adequate protection against the tiled floor.
Maybe, when they got back he could have a shower and have Sherlock bandage him up again. He'd take off his pants next time.
John heard his squad leader shout before John’s world erupted into pain. He flapped his wings, trying to stay airborne, trying to find his attackers, but he was spiralling wildly. Blood was pouring out of his left wing, each beat with it caused his plagiopatagium to tear worse.
John tensed and Sherlock decided that his exploration would have to wait. He’d expected John’s wariness, it’s why he needed the scarf.
Blankets were put on the floor of the bathroom and the dildo stuck to the side of the claw foot tub. Sherlock knelt, legs under the tub, and worked the lubed dildo into himself. Then John knelt in front of him, erection bobbing in his face.
Floating a bit Sherlock wasn’t deducing where the hits would land next and he was surprised when, “Six, seven, eight, nine,” hit up and down his thighs. With each one of those hits, Sherlock thrust into the sheets. He could feel a puddle from his precome gathering underneath his trapped erection.
John stared at him. Traditionally the first command was to have the sub kneel. But maybe his Dom noticed that he had a cane and was trying to come up with something different. The thought made John hopeful, if he’d been matched with a thoughtful Dom it’d make life a lot easier.
Sherlock took John out for a quiet dinner and helped him pack away the rest of the things in the house after.
“I am in love with you,” Sherlock said. He annunciated each word slowly and clearly as though John was being particularly dim-witted.
She frowned at that. It was recommended that couples engaged in regular intercourse to keep their relationship strong. She said, “John, is that ok with you?” to get through this part.
Sherlock’s head flew back and his mouth opened, though no sound came out. He came and came and came, distantly hearing John curse above him.
John growled low in his throat and dived at O'Murtagh. They fought on the ground, neither gaining the upper hand due to their suits.
John smirked proudly, then the expression softened into a smile. “Me too. I’ll find you after my shift?”
“Isn’t it?” John asked. It wasn’t; Sherlock wasn’t dead, he hadn’t jumped off a building, and there hadn’t been a funeral.
“Finally,” John gasped. He slid off to the side before spreading Sherlock’s legs and climbing back and settling between them.
“What?” John asked, thrown again. He’d suspected Sherlock could read minds. He always seemed to know when he was using to much pressure, how he needed to move his tongue, when to clench and how to press every single one of John’s buttons. It was almost as if he were some sort of succubus.
When they got home, he wasn’t tired but John was. Sherlock didn’t want John to sleep in this mindset. He’d have nightmares.
Then there were hands holding him down. “Let him put the condom on,” Bill said before kissing him upside down.
Sherlock’s hands roamed John’s body. Running a flannel over every inch of skin. The movement wasn’t impersonal or sexual, it was worshipful. He turned John with gentle nudges and didn’t say a word. He would pepper kisses to John’s skin when John moved.
Probably not, John decided. After all, Sherlock had taken the initiative to start their relationship in the first place.
When the man was on his knees, taking it from behind, Sherlock lubed up the dildo and slid his hips down.
So, Sherlock crawled in bed with him, peppering his face with kisses, whispering “I love you,” into his skin.
John moaned delightfully as Sherlock teased his hole. Sherlock ran his finger around John’s rim, sliding over the hole but not entering. Clockwise then counterclockwise until—
John thought that Sherlock solved an awful lot of murders and never said that but thought it best to keep his mouth shut.
“Christ,” he said as he covered his eyes with his forearm. If he looked at Sherlock right now he would combust.
When John was nice and open Sherlock used his tongue to lick out the lube. He wanted it all gone, he wanted to taste John and only John before he fucked him. It wasn’t the best system and Sherlock decided to make a seal with his lips and suck.
Sherlock kept moving his hands as he felt John’s cock slide inside him and John caught his hand. And twined their fingers. Sherlock could feel his ring on John’s finger and it made his cock twitch. He felt it drip onto his stomach.
James pulled out and Sherlock protested the loss. James ignored him so Sherlock sat up, disgruntled, and glared at James. John dressed quickly, leaving his vest on the floor. He said something to Murray once he was done.
John wasn’t tempted by the offer of money. Sure, he wasn’t a wealthy man and he could really use the cash and he didn’t know if his new Dom would provide for him… but it wasn’t a proper way to start out a relationship. He liked to think he had some honour and he wasn’t going to sully it by spying on someone he was supposed to trust.
"On the planet's surface," John responded and stood to see if he could find their spacecraft. Even though the suit was heated he was starting to get cold. He saw half their craft on the horizon and... What was that?
Of course, the antibiotics had to be taken with food so they had to stop to eat. They had to be taken at the same time every day so John set an alarm on his mobile.
Sherlock smiled, thinking he wanted John to leave it. There was more come than usual, thanks to the prostate stimulation.
John released Sherlock’s penis and Sherlock didn’t think he imagined John’s reluctance to do so. John bent forward on his hands and knees, his breath hot as his mouth hovered over Sherlock’s cock. Before Sherlock could get any ideas John shimmied backwards and slid off the foot of the bed. He practically ran to the nightstand and opened it with more force than necessary. He rummaged a bit before raising his prize. He uncapped it and turned it over in his hand.
Sherlock was frustrated. He’d had a lot of sex recently so he was horny and his plan to show John he could take care of him sexually wouldn’t work if they weren’t having sex.
Sherlock didn’t care, he was already thinking of ways he could get out of it. John must have noticed his apathy because he made the appointment and even said, “I’ll make sure he’s there.”
“Yes, please, sir,” Sherlock said. He looked up at his Dom and saw him working out his shoulder. “Do you need a break, sir?”
Sherlock didn’t want him to change out of his uniform but it would be easier for him to focus if John did.
John had been at it for minutes, how many John didn’t know, it felt like ages that he had focused on his right side.
The sensation was glorious--John worked with the condom, he was skilled and must have done this a lot. He twisted his wrist as he accidently hit Sherlock with his tooth.
Besides, it’d been a year. Rosie was actively getting into everything now, John wasn’t sure it was a good idea to have her around the thumbs, scalpels and all the other dangerous and disgusting things Sherlock experimented with.
Sherlock went back to John’s hole and after a minute of sucking and licking the flavour of the lube was gone. He leaned back, wiping the saliva from his cheeks and chin and went to get the lube. He could finally fuck John without a condom and he was looking forward to seeing his come dripping out of John’s dark hole.
“Alright?” John asked. He was gritting his teeth. Sherlock could see it was a collocal effort to stay still.
Sherlock didn’t know. He’d just wanted to escape. He had told the cabbie to take them to Baker Street without thinking. But they wouldn’t even have time to have tea before they needed to leave. He examined John, seeing if there was anywhere he needed or wanted to go.
John relaxed at that. He was happy that Sherlock had friends. That he had people who cared about him, people he could talk with. He knew from Harry that being gay wasn’t easy and it was good to have other gay people to talk to.
“Yes,” Sholto, James, said decisively. Turning to Sherlock he became authoritative,  “Follow me to your quarters.”
“But now I’ve got a second chance and it might be too soon but I don’t want to wait. It’s only been a month—well, not a full month, but still—I think I’ve proven that I can make you happy.”
He trusted Sherlock, though. Sure, Sherlock experimented on him occasionally but never with anything that had lasting consequences. He was careful, methodical and always made sure John was ok after. Much like he was being with John’s bites and scratches.
Feeling a little impish, Sherlock swept John off his feet and carried him bridal style. John wiggled and yelled and Sherlock was reminded of the cat that caused this whole mess. The shots had energized John but not so much that he was able to free himself.
“I wouldn’t treat the people who hold your fate in their hands like this,” she said coldly and swept out of the room.
Knowing it was pointless, he hadn’t been able to come with the cock ring yet and this wouldn’t change that, Sherlock thrust into the sheets when John gave him a breather anyway. He shivered and realized he was cold. He’d been sweating without realizing it.
John didn’t pull up, just doubled his efforts and suddenly his mouth was flooded. Come dribbled down his chin and the amount of it nearly choked him but he swallowed as much as he could.
He walked as he dragged the wheel knowing the pressure changed with each of his steps. He dragged the wheel up Sherlock’s midline not deviating and heading to his nipple like he was expecting. John went up Sherlock’s neck, over his chin, watching the individual pins across the sensitive skin of his lips. Sherlock shivered, as John ran over Sherlock’s cheekbone several times.
Mrs Hudson had said. And as much as he hated to admit it he did. So, he’d focused on the first time they’d interact. But it wasn’t the first time they’d interact. The ceremony was the first time.
Sherlock moved his hand behind him and groped Bill. He was average sized, fourteen—no, thirteen—centimetres. No, fifteen. Wait—
“You can’t put that against the headboard,” John said, tilting his head at the crack they’d put in the wall yesterday.
It was him. It was Sherlock. He didn’t recognize him though. Sherlock probably hadn’t ever thought of him again. How could John have been so stupid?! When they ran into each other on the street Sherlock wouldn’t say,
When Sherlock’s hips finally stilled John kissed him. A peck, a small nibble of that perfect cupid’s bow softened with a lick.
Sherlock tried not to look too smug or nervous. He hadn’t told Lestrade that he was proposing just in case John said no, he only said it was for John’s Christmas present. He couldn’t bear the idea of Lestrade and Molly giving him pitting looks if John didn’t say yes. Now that the two were a couple they’d gossip worse than ever.
Sherlock blinked himself out of his head as James said, “I don’t think he’s bowing out. I think he’s losing focus.” He walked up and tilted Sherlock’s head to his. “Aren’t you?”
“My brother’s estate has been settled. I was charged with delivering this to you. Apologies for the delay, we had to be sure.”
The fingers pinched and rubbed, then with a word from John, twisted. The hand in his hair yanked, the cock in his arse stiffened.
Miffed, John took savage a bite of his apple. It’s not like he was being rude by offering, and Sherlock was too skinny. It was unhealthy.
John waited for Sherlock to exit the elevator first and followed two steps behind. Sherlock knew a lot of Doms wanted their subs to do that but Sherlock found it aggravating. He wanted to look at his sub, to reassure himself that John was there. Even though he could hear John and his cane clearly Sherlock wanted the visual confirmation. Maybe he wouldn’t when he knew John better and he could deduce his mood by his tread.
John undid Sherlock’s wrist restraints and massaged the joints. He rubbed out the red marks and kissed them before he planted a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead.
He gave Sherlock a firm look and Sherlock rolled his eyes in response. He stood and went upstairs to change out of his pyjamas. He’d worn his best suit yesterday so he settled for his nice blue one with a light blue shirt.
Sherlock had to use a little pressure to slide the plug into place and John had to grip the base of his cock hard to keep from coming at Sherlock’s tortured-pleasure expression.
John thought he should probably call Sherlock back so he could ask if he could use it but it wouldn’t matter in the end. John couldn’t pay. Sherlock would have to. He handed the card to the cabbie and after running it the cabbie handed it back.
Please remember that I don’t have a beta for these because I decided to do this last minute and I’m not even doing the advent calendar challenge properly. I am posting these immediately after I write them. Hopefully the chapters aren't so horrible that you can overlook the little things.
"Sher-loc," Jawn used the tone Mycroft used when he was frustrated with them, "keep up. I have to check on everyone else."
“You think this is all some experiment,” Sherlock said. Before John could answer he said, “You’re right.”
He flipped to the front of the packet and read Sherlock’s scores. It wouldn’t be a lie and he could actually learn something from them.
What Sherlock hadn’t expected was how fun the game was and how much he enjoyed playing it. He was drawn in.
John’s hips smacked into his and Sherlock found himself getting close. He reached his hand between them to let John know. John noticed and sped up his thrusts.
She shifted the papers around Lestrade’s desk, pulling out a folder. She rifled through it before turning it to John.
But Sherlock didn’t turn them on John. He only set them down and turned off the light. He lifted his violin and bow from the toilet lid and started to play.
“Nnguh,” Sherlock groaned into his pillow. No matter how many essays John wrote he never would have understood.
Ella told him to write a blog about everything that happened to him but nothing happened to him. Ella told him to put in for a private matching to get him through until marriage and John just barely managed not to laugh. What Dom would want him? He was headstrong, independent... damaged... old. Only thirty-five but without any submissive training, professional or private. He had PTSD for Christ sakes. John came home and cleaned the weapon he'd smuggled into the country and didn't tell Ella that if he started writing about his pointless life he'd end it.
If that wasn’t bad enough he nearly dropped. Over one little command. He hadn’t even been at risk of dropping in ten years.
Sherlock woke, groggy and nauseated. He hadn’t been this hungover in a long time. What had he taken last night? Oh, god, he’d gotten high. Why? He’d been doing so well!
There were more tan lines indicating they went shirtless sometimes. John’s erection was indeed impressive. Sherlock couldn’t be sure as he was too aroused to make accurate measurements, but it was at least twenty centimetres long and the girth was remarkable. He regretted his decision—
John exited the car, leaning heavily on his cane. He wasn’t scared, even though most people in his position would be, he was angry. His wedding was tomorrow and as little as he was looking forward to it he wanted to be prepared. His dress uniform was being taken in (he’d decided on it for his wedding suit, he couldn’t exactly afford a new one), and he’d been on his way to collect it when the phones had started ringing.
Sherlock held the condom’s base as John fell sideways off of him. Then he removed it, tying a knot to keep the come inside. He wanted to compare it to the last sperm sample he’d taken from himself.
Sherlock looked up from his experiment. He didn’t really have time to talk to anyone right now, but his mother’s tone made him pause. Her body language told him she was upset. Sherlock’s brow furrowed. He couldn’t deduce what was wrong. She was sad about him and he hadn’t done anything to disappoint her recently. Well, not that he knew of or intended to do, anyway. Perhaps he had offended someone by telling the truth about their intelligence again.
Sherlock wrapped both his hands around the edge of the cot and tried to encourage James to move faster, to go deeper.
Sherlock would appreciate the thought and getting Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner’s permission and that Mrs Turner had said she’d talk to the other neighbours so John could have a bigger garden as long as he grew her some tomatoes.
Mycroft ignored him and walked to the door. “Someone will be along with the paperwork for the trust tomorrow afternoon. Also, I believe he left some items for you at Baker Street,
Sherlock was disappointed. He knew John wouldn’t up the count and more pleasure was coming so he begged, “Please, John, the crop, I need it. The last one, make it good.” He was having trouble stringing together coherent sentences.
John moved Sherlock’s wrists above his head and pressed them into the mattress, a silent order to keep them there. “I think we’ll use the riding crop next. You like it. Twenty strokes, yeah?”
“Ah!” Sherlock’s legs twitched; he wanted to thrust. He wasn’t huge, only twelve centimetres, still enough to choke someone. Thankfully he didn’t have to work to restrain himself -- his position didn’t allow for it.
“Uh,” John said. He wasn’t sure he wanted to do this now. Was Sherlock having him on? Was this all some sort of experiment or test or something?
John’s tongue peeked out to moisten his lips and when Sherlock still didn’t say anything John’s face started to fall. He was thinking that Sherlock was having second thoughts about him. That Sherlock didn’t want him. As if he was somehow not desirable.
John had never asked; he’d just assumed because The Woman had texted. If she wasn’t texting because it was Sherlock’s birthday, then why?
John caught his hips and held them as he asked, “You ok?” His arms shook with the effort of holding Sherlock’s hips in place.
In the end he just wiped the tears from the screen, set the mobile aside, and sobbed into his hands.
Sherlock rounded on the counsellor, “You should have known better. Why did you have me command him?” He was distraught, with good reason.
Three more hits and Sherlock was nearly incoherent. These came down directly on his arse, shoving the plug deep and pushing it in hard. It pounded his prostate and Sherlock cried out, “Ah! Ah! Ah!”
It was a quick walk. As Sherlock expected, the space set aside for him was somewhat secluded. Admittedly, he’d expected more than a glorified broom closet in a tent. The space was a little over three metres by slightly under four. Clearly they’d set him up here, in a place without air conditioning or any comforts in a ploy to ask for more funding. There was a cot covered in threadbare sheets and a thin pillow. A hideous orange carpet was covering the floor. A rather attractive wardrobe took up the back of the room.  Sherlock had actually hoped to have never used the room, to just bounce around various private spaces, perhaps even being walked in on and having another man join in, but that wasn’t necessary anymore.
Mycroft's ship landed in the middle of a fireworks show in the country. He blended into the crowd and took a train back to London. His flat was just as he left it and he began pulling sheets from his furniture. He left the rooms he wouldn't use until later. His fridge was unplugged and he plugged it back in before checking his care package from the other Terran council members.
“Yeah?” John was anxious to fix her mood. He hadn’t meant to look sad, but he had never figured out how to hide his emotions from her. She was a lot like her mother.
He flipped through the envelopes, diving the bills into “pay now” and “pay next month” (the second was alarmingly large) when he saw it.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it,” Sherlock said as he walked away.
Sherlock did, raised his hands over his head and pushed his hips into the air. The welts stung as he moved and he plug shifted and he was panting with pleasure.
Sherlock kissed John’s hole once, twice, three times before there was pressure. Sherlock was pushing his tongue in, trying breach John’s body.
There was a rough hand on his cock and Sherlock opened his eyes to see John’s tongue poking out from between his lips. His eyes were filled with fire.
John felt Sherlock’s forehead fall against his thigh. The dark curls tickled his leg. John wiggled so he could reach down and tangle his fingers in that sexy hair. He ran his nails gently across Sherlock’s scalp, back and forth, like he was petting him.
his squad leader replied in his mind before leading the whole team in a rallying cry before they took to the skies.
“Oh, righ—ah!” John gasped when Sherlock rested up on both elbows in order to grab and hold John’s hips in place. His fingers dug into John’s thighs.
“Ah!” the tip of the dildo rubbed his prostate. He arched his back and the laptop teetered dangerously.
Sherlock knew he could force the issue, could blackmail them, could coerce Watson (and maybe Sholto) into bed with him. But that wasn’t how he operated. If they decided to carry on a forbidden romance it wasn’t any of his business and them not wanting to have sex with him would result in inferior sex. It would ruin the whole thing.
Sherlock would say it was sentimental nonsense, but John couldn’t help but think it was fate. They were meant for each other.
After taking the cane John thanked him with a tight smile and Sherlock realized he’d failed. He shouldn’t have done that, his sub wanted to be independent. It was good, Sherlock really didn’t have it in him to provide everything a typical sub needed. Still, he should be adjusting his behaviour according to his sub’s needs, not doing things that irritated him. It rankled Sherlock that he’d gotten it wrong.
.” And, dear god, did he really just say that? It sounded like a line out of a bad porno. Thankfully, the soldiers weren’t laughing. In fact, it looked like Watson was flustered.
“No, I hurt you when I left. There were bound to be consequences. If the worst is that I have to be careful when I wake you from nightmares... Well,” Sherlock paused, his hand tightening around John’s, “it’s worth it to share your bed.”
“…I’m on holiday.” Sherlock looked at Sholto through his lashes. He turned his triumphant smirk, which had appeared when Watson and Sholto confirmed his deduction, filthy. “And since my work is done I’d like to have some fun.”
They seemed disappointed by this answer, or maybe they were frustrated. John was starting to get a migraine.
John scooted forward and Sherlock shuffled back so his arse was pressed against the tub and the head of John’s cock was heavy on his tongue. Then Sherlock shifted his weight forward, the smooth slippery slide of the dildo as it moved out of him made him groan around the cock in his mouth making John twitch. He didn’t move forward though, just held still and let Sherlock take him in at his own pace.
Happy Thanksgiving my American friends. Hopefully this update finds you well or gives you a much needed distraction.
Sherlock decided to just go for it. He couldn’t possibly make the situation any worse. “Are you both free?”
John felt his pants get moist from Sherlock’s saliva. He groaned at the sensations. He didn’t want Sherlock to stop but he desperately wanted to pull Sherlock off so he could remove the damn pants and let Sherlock go to town on his cock directly.
“Really?” John’s heart sank. He’d thought that Sherlock was flirting with him. Did Sherlock just hit on everyone then?
The only thing that brought him comfort was that it’d be hard for him to find a match. He had unorthodox desires in the bedroom and finding a Dom that wanted what he did was difficult. Most of the women John had been with preferred pegging. John hated taking it up the arse. It was one of the reasons he didn’t try to date men.
Thanks to my beta for pointing out all the things out that I should know but forgot. They made this brilliant instead of lacklustre.
“Yeah? You always call when you need something. What is it this time? I don’t have the money to pay you back if that’s what you’re after.” She sniffed and added snidely, “Even though you said you didn’t expect it back.”
John reached down and worked a finger into Sherlock’s hole. John was careful with Sherlock’s prostate and his movements were gentle. Sherlock tried to relax, he needed John in him now!
Or he was upset, did he think he cheated on his commander? Probably not, John had frequent liaisons with Bill, after all. James too, he was their third.
He forgave Sherlock for thinking he was into this. He knew he’d draw the same conclusion if he’d been the one to receive the package. Of course, John wouldn’t have gone through and opened Sherlock’s mail in the first place. But, it was an understandable conclusion.
Sherlock was nonplussed. He listed to the sound of the shower turning on, John adjusting the taps, watching the clear glass start to fog with the steam, in bewilderment.
Then John’s back arched and he screamed. His muscles clamped around Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock was almost forced out.
He ran the sharp pricks and cool metal of the Wartenberg Pinwheel along the outside of Sherlock’s right foot.
“Now,” Sherlock said. He rolled over and thrust in the air to prove to John he was enjoying himself. His erection was deep red and leaking.
For several minutes they were in a stalemate. John didn't know what to do. As the medical officer, he knew that letting an alien on the ship was a bad idea and he was possibly dooming them all, but when Sherlock ran up and asked for help John couldn't let him die. John wasn't going to let him be murdered either.
