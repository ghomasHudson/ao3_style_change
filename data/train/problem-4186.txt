The man whose name was Singers on the list barked out laughter. Castiel’s jaw locked. It was the fifth call of someone laughing on the other end. If only he could also find it funny.
“Hey, no fair,” Dean said as he put both hands on Castiel’s shoulder and pushed him down the bed. From there, he sneaked his palms straight inside Castiel’s shirt to cup his chest. The shirt got pulled up to Castiel’s shoulder, revealing his body for Dean to feist his eyes. Castiel wanted to melt on the spot but Dean didn’t give him time to hide. The man swiftly pulled his shirt next and then his pants. Then Dean stopped to admire the view. Castiel had to pull him down to remind him what to do next. He wanted to kiss Dean, wanted to keep that heat in his body flaming as he felt his own reaction to Dean’s every touch. Dean’s kiss was full and gratifying. Castiel once again questioned Dean’s expertise on the act, and found himself growing irritable at the thought of Dean dating other people. How jealousy works sometimes. It’s so irrational, like the tingling sensation occupying his lower regions.
“Jack, I wouldn’t call it being responsible—”
The demon’s growl was loud and pathetic, affecting him in a way it sounded too Dean. He’s heard it many times in Dean’s private hours, knowing how Dean liked to pleasure himself. Making up his mind, Castiel dragged Dean to the bed and threw him on the pile of sheets the demon had copiously rolled there himself.
Yas! Go check
“Well, you’re alone in your house. It doesn’t count that you’re living in the suburb. Crime doesn’t choose its prey.”
Ms. Barnes gave him a look, “We do if its growth is compromised. We sometimes feed it extra milk. But we usually leave things up to nature.”
Dean saw Cas' eyes glinted like billions of stars. He nodded breathlessly. Cas softly smiled and kissed him again, slow and catching, n more tasting when he pushed the tip of his tongue inside his mouth and Dean could’ve combusted at how hot it was. Castiel licked inside him, let his tongue savor every corner of Dean’s mouth before engaging his tongue in a swift dance that made Dean groan. He grabbed on Castiel’s upper shoulder and they were firm and sturdy. He melted just sinking his fingers in bruising point, knowing Castiel would never mind. He wished he could leave marks on the angel to prove that he was owned, that he was loved
“Yes.”
“We have to check if she got all her cats rounded up. We don’t want any cats trapped in your drywall, Cas. You really want contractors to come around knocking your walls off? I can tell you a story about a couple who left their cat with a babysitter in the middle of renovation. They were called back when they heard their cat was missing. They posted fliers, rewards to anyone who could help them locate the cat. For one week they did that until one night they heard some scratching on the wall. They figured what happened and called animal support who called contractors. Their newly renovated house ended with cut holes in the bathroom, the kitchen ceiling—everywhere until they found two sparkling orbs in the dark—like Gollum eyes. It was a disaster, so if you don’t want to end up like that—"
“Single as I was born,” Dean harked a laugh. Castiel looked away and pretended to fix his things, knowing his face was probably as red as this farm’s tomato.
Dean licked his lips, eyes narrowed as he followed Castiel’s back. Sam elbowed him.
He found Dean smirking at him.
Of all the excuses. Do you remember you brought down heaven with you for one man? Castiel, you’ve been choosing him ever since you branded him your mark in hell. You really have no choice but to stick with it, y’know.”
“Dean,” Castiel breathed in relief.
Growling, Castiel began undoing his buttons, Dean not shying away from the strip show his friend is providing, not entirely feeling guilty of the slight reaction it caused his nether regions because as far as he was concerned, he’s always reacted when Castiel does something.
“He’s that smart and special. Wait here.”
“Aw, come on, just in the cheek? Pretty please?”
There’s a blinding flash behind him. Castiel jumped and turned to see a demon upon him with face screwed into a painful scream before falling down the floor, dead.
“Yeah, before the shift of schedule to another practicum, that fast, isn’t it? I hope everything is this easy.”
He slowly stared up the ceiling in horror.
But try as he might, without wings, Cas was only able to get into the aftermath of the celebration the next day. That’s how he found Dean leaning precariously at the edge of the metal railing overviewing the war table. Castiel moved on instinct and pulled Dean back by wrapping an arm around Dean’s waist for his lack of better judgment.
“Hello.” he took his hand, still unable to pull his gaze away at this drop of the gods of Olympus. He was being dramatic, but this was a complete drama. Whatever he was feeling must’ve been obvious because Dean was staring back at him with a slight curving of his lips, like he caught Castiel peeking at him in the bathroom.
“Some says it’s better when its half rotten. It’s about amino acid, right?” Gavin turned and raised a hand to their chemistry teacher, Mr. Corbin Tilghman, who was just about to leave the classroom.
Dean stares at Sam like he grew another head.
“Hey, he’s not taking any!” Dean growled at the bartender, snatching Castiel’s wrist, turned him around and began pushing his back. He gritted his teeth at Jason, “You go after him, I’ll kick your ass!”
not just in front of Dean.
“I apologize that you had to remember something traumatic because of my actions. It was my mistake.”
“Does that mean you’re not going home for summer vacation?”
“Um…”
People were everywhere playing beach volleyball, playing in the water, or playing with the sand. The vendors on the side were active too as tourists all over the place poured in one after another.
Dean cursed again and removed his head gear. “If I’d known they were gonna let him slip away, I’d have chased him instead of the older brother.”
Castiel bit his lower lip. “There are scratches again?”
The touch on his chin had him licking his lips, exactly where Cas was paying attention. The world was theirs.
Meg came up behind him with that mischievous smirk playing across her face.
“I look forward to our meal,” Castiel said as he dropped his bags on the bed. The room was neat with bookshelves too. He remembered Dean saying his brother was a smart guy. “Are you sure it’s okay to use this room?”
“Right?” Adam smirked at him knowingly.
“Are you still scared of horses, Cas? I mean, they may look big and intimidating at first glance, but they’re actually very timid and sensitive. They get easily scared too,” Dean’s laughter was enticing. Castiel glanced at him fondly.
“Why do you sound so surprised? All my ideas are great?”
Castiel let out the air he didn’t think he was holding and just grabbed Dean back, clawing at his flannel, wanting nothing but to feel him nearer and buried his face in the crook of Dean’s neck. The pain all melted the way Dean pulled him deeper into the embrace, whispering his name like a prayer and Castiel was forever healed. It was comforting, it cleared his head having Dean on his arms and he basked in it. He would never love anyone the way he loved Dean.
“Alright, I’ll make dinner. Then we can talk about commitments.”
“Nah, don’t bother. Sam Winchester is a vegetarian freak.”
Dean pressed his lips.
“Hey, you guys,” called Mr. Harvell, their Dairy Farm teacher as he stood by the doorway, “Get change already. We’re meeting up on the field for raising crops. Also, those who haven’t submitted which club they’re joining; you have until after class today to submit your application.”
“So…Thanksgiving?”
“So, uh… this is it, right? You and me? The couch? The talk? Back in Psychiatry 101?” he grinned foolishly which only earned him a lift of eyebrow from the unamused doctor.
“He just doesn’t change,” he straightened to get
“What did you tell him?”
Castiel grumbled all the way to the coffee machine. He was going to have his report handed to his client after lunch and he really needed to snap out of this. Quietly settling down the break room area, he pressed his thumb on the bridge of his nose when he heard his phone ring. He didn’t have the patience to read the screen, he put it straight over his ear.
“Something bothering you?” Inias asked from the top bunk in the act of putting his headphones on, “Are you worried for Dean?”
“Yeah, you said I have fear of dying. That’s impossible. I have many near-death encounters,” his lid felt heavy.
“I nap occasionally on the couch, steal some in the afternoon, but no. I don’t even remember half the things I do at work,” Dean laughed half-heartedly and ran his fingers through his short hair, “talk about not stressing myself, huh?”
“Dean.”
Castiel couldn’t help exhaling and closing his eyes. When spoke, he found the man staring at him with a quiet smile on his lips.
Castiel snaked a hand behind Dean’s neck looking positively in love.
“Ready for some farm work?” Dean pulled his sleeves up with a grin. Castiel joined him and the two cleaned the stables and brushed the horses. Carrying straws to the shed and disposing of manure was something Castiel had gotten used to in taking care of the horses back at CALS. By the time he noticed it, the sun was almost setting. Castiel leaned on the rake he was using to clean one of the stables when he checked his phone again.
He moaned against Castiel’s kiss and rolled their bodies so he was on top of this time. The angel stared back at him with blue eyes so round and blown so Dean enjoyed the view. Packed muscles, full mound, toned in places Dean just wanted to kiss. How on earth he got the angel on the bed, he's sure he'll go to hell for it. But it's Cas fault looking at him that way, like Dean's everything he wished for served on a silver platter.
Dean hummed, warm beside Cas. “How lucky my husband’s practically my angel?”
“Oh,” Dean’s eyes sparkled, his body falling into a familiar stance that read as comfortable with a huge smirk on his face, “Seems like I’m learning more about you each day.”
Dean beckoned his men back on the monitor quietly.
“Look—even if he did mention him, he was unlikely to tell me his brother was some bomb fanatic, okay? I just want them to be out of my life, that’s not some grand wish, is it? So why am I suddenly receiving death threats
Benny finished.
"We're both saps," he grinned.
“Doesn’t that mean you have to avoid getting more warnings and study harder so your grades won’t fail? Otherwise, she’ll leave you.” Anna said in a matter-of-fact tone. There was a round of snickers. Gavin looked shaken before turning to Castiel with a pleading look.
“If you’re not so goddamned good looking—"
“Fine.” Castiel led the way out into the porch, out to the side street to his neighbor, “But you’re the one knocking. I doubt Mrs. Butters remember me.”
“Oh, cheese caves!” Dean’s face lit up while Castiel squinted. Cheese caves are essentially temperature-controlled spaces where cheese can be aged, as what he had learned from the book but he hadn’t actually seen one.
It was a while before Dean finally dropped down from cloud nine as he started to feel his cock ready to explode. He grabbed one of Castiel’s hand which were digging on his back as Castiel was still thrusting inside him in desperation. It took five more thrust before Castiel spilled inside him and it was all the explosion Dean needed as his gruff voice echoed in the hallway but it wasn’t over. Castiel flipped him again, this time making Dean sit on the table. It was their way so as not to spill too much evidence.
“I think someone’s trying to get in your house.”
Fortunately, Dr. Novak didn’t push him on the subject, he just nodded but didn’t say anything. He adjusted the object in his hand and Dean saw a pocket watch.
“Dean,” he croaked when their lips parted to finally catch their breath, “clothes.”
“The deal.” he repeated with an edge in his tone, he just wouldn’t let it off, “Why?”
A beat passed. Castiel was sure there was something his brain was trying to tell him and that included not to laugh because it was all—
“Well,” Dean began as Castiel crossed his arms and gazed down his feet. He listened to Dean explain the situation. The last time he made an assertive move like this with Mrs. Butters was when he explained about the vegetable patch which she strongly ignored. Listening to Dean talk about her cats getting trapped in the ceiling like catacomb was enough to make her alarmed and call her cats one by one. It was a pretty surreal show the way Mrs. Butters just called the names and instantly the felines appeared and sat in their respective corners.
“Body check? What body check?” Dean’s head shot up in confusion. Crowley gave a nonchalant shrug like it’s always been known.
“Why would Sam…?”
“I won’t know if I don’t try,” Jack repeated, making Castiel and Sam glower at the older Winchester.
Dean slumped back at the foot of the bed with hands on his hair. "I made you do it, Cas. Don't think for a second you did anything wrong."
“You let him in there, the guy will lose a literal arm and a leg.”
“I think I can manage that,” Dean told him while they followed Bobby who pointed at the large field of crops ahead, then led them to the storage house.
“I’m really getting good at this,” Gavin said thirty minutes later as Castiel finished checking his answer sheet, “I might even say I deserve an award!”
He closed his fist. From someone who came here with nothing, he was now someone who could lose everything. He glanced at Dean who was still looking calm as ever. Could he keep being by Dean’s side no matter the verdict?
“Dean?”
“Agreed. Do I have to write the check now or—?"
"Stay back!  This nutcase is after you!" glaring down his prey, Dean grappled the man's collar, “What do you want from my boyfriend, huh?"
They said if one is overwhelmed by a new situation, one can find comfort in routine.
Cas happened to pass the kitchen when he saw Dean eating inside.
“What? Yeah, yeah. That.”
Dean called and postponed his visit early morning, saying something about an urgent business in the shop. Castiel who had called in for a leave was left wondering if he was again, getting in his too quick. He excused the behavior because for one no one would be left to look after the house and two, he couldn’t give Dean his keys yet.
“Hmm? I just observe people, that’s all. I’m good at that. So, when I say stuff like this you better believe it. Sometimes it’s hard for people to see the good things about themselves. I think you’re more than good, Cas. You work harder than everyone else, and you’re good-looking! So why are you so sad sometimes, I wonder? I mean, I understand why you’re frustrated, you’re a kid from the city who probably broke a few muscles in this school, but you persevered and are open to learning a lot—but sad? It makes me—and everyone else just cheers for you a lot, y’know? I mean, you don’t show it a lot, but I think you’re really a pretty reserved guy who’s trying to understand everyone around him. You’re so cool, you know?”
“Bedroom.”
“Keep acting like that, we’ll be labeled as a husband by our enemies next time.” Dean joked, watching Cas drink with interest. He had his weirdo face bowing, completely into the coconut and Dean knew it’s sinful, but he cannot stop admiring the way Castiel’s long lashes dip on his cheeks, the fringes of his dark hair curling in places they weren’t supposed to be seen, the way his throat bobbed—and it’s hell for Dean in the afterlife.
If this was the demon’s way of angering him further, it was working. He pulled Dean to his eye level roughly, uncaring that his right knee slipped between Dean’s legs.  giving the dark eyes a searching look. There’s only pure red and anger, said words in Enochian only understandable to a demon where his Dean had no business to understand.
“Anytime, Cas.”
“Dean?” he could swear Dean was in his room. Dean was munching on a large piece of sandwich put together in layers the way he liked it. But there was something off as Castiel stepped into the threshold, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Dean hadn’t given him any acknowledgment, nor did he stop chewing on his sandwich. Not even Castiel standing opposite him could get the man from looking up which was very concerning. It was a given Dean prefers his food over anything, but he’d never intentionally ignored anyone.
Dean looked over his shoulder and grinned. “Your ears are red. You really are cute for a guy.”
“I don’t like this, Dean.” Castiel observed, “She seems pretty smitten by you.”
Dean shrugged and acquiesced.
Castiel called everyone’s attention when the oven’s temperature reached its peak.
“Yes, I am. Desperately so.”
“Well, no point going here without you so around the time you get home. Same time, then?”
He drove towards town, his thoughts on the demon’s tactical of keeping his presence in the dark. He got a motel room, checked in and then did a quick sweep of the town in case there were unnatural events in the area. He wasn’t sure what changed, but in the middle of this chasing game they’d been playing, something shifted that constantly had Castiel eyeing his back.
“My parents? It’s not like they’ll be the one you’re marrying—”
“We’ll never meet up in heaven, right?”
“Oh, sweet, now I’m even hungrier, I’ll die,” Dean complained and threw himself into Castiel's arms. “Can’t you kiss your boyfriend so I’d get revived?” he pleaded only to receive a grim smile from his boyfriend. “Come on, Cas, we’re alone.” Saying so, he rubbed his cheeks on Castiel’s nose, being all over him that Castiel felt it dangerous.
“It’s fine, I can fight my own battles, Dean,” Castiel hooked up his other leg and inhaled the air from his height at the back of the horse. “He already apologized and received another three days’ labor for false information. Besides, I can’t have you punch anyone with an injury like that,”
How attractive Castiel looked, how sexy and hot that was beyond measure, no wonder people kept staring. But this was his Cas and he was more than the vessel. This was the Castiel that stuck with him till the end, never have imagined they would both survive it. Now they’re here…
“Cas,” Dean called before Castiel could close the door. Castiel paused his hand on the doorknob, feeling blue.
“Anyone recognized his vehicle?” Castiel was saying with his eyes on the playing video where they watch a man enter the store wearing a suit.
Dean stared at Gadreel severely, “Is this other Cartwright in direct vicinity?”
“Keep him alive, he’s gonna have to pay for a lot of stuff,” Gabriel said in his livid voice.
Dean rounded on Sam, nonplussed.
“And what?”
“Dean, I’m here- I’m—” Castiel choked, cheeks tear-streaked. He wanted to be with Dean so bad. He wanted to fix it, he wanted to embrace him, apologize and see that he wasn’t left behind again— he needed to make Dean see—wanted to keep Dean safe— make him smile and protect him forever.
Castiel tilted his head.
“Can I call you Cas?”
Castiel told himself he would never be a burden to Dean. But he couldn’t find it in him to stop when he poured everything to the Dean about the missing key, the locked door, the empty street, being alone—everything—
“But that wasn’t a rumor!”
Only Adam was not around which made Castiel worry. By the time he came at half-past ten, everyone had helped in kneading the dough and had shaped it with a rolling pin.
Castiel actually laughed. But as he stared up at the ceiling of his bed bunk, he couldn’t help feeling that his hopes had been raised. It was true, having a relationship with another guy would probably raise his family’s eyebrows, but it’s not them that he cared about. At this point, it was not about him, but Dean.
“Now, this cryptic message being incomplete is an assurance, though for the time being,” Castiel was saying after Dean placed their breakfast on the counter. Dean munched on the toast, nodding at his husband, “If it is incomplete, then we will probably be expecting one more message before any actual attack.”
“Hell yeah, I panicked! I thought you were gone without saying goodbye!” Dean said harshly, fist closing on the lapel of Castiel’s suit and tugging him closer. The doctor didn’t immediately lean down, he studied Dean’s face before breaking into a refreshing smile that Dean hadn’t seen before.
Dean grabbed the car handle and stopped. What the hell was he thinking expecting someone like this guy to help him out? There are many more doctors who could help. Why must this one be the first one he approached with full of hope? He glared back at the doctor who had already lost interest in him. He was already staring out the other window with a blank look on his face. Dean wanted to grab him by the collar and punch him in the face—or maybe slap him. That kind of face was too pristine to be damaged, but a part of him wanted to try. But the way his hand was already trembling from the sudden movement had Dean blinking to himself. Exactly what was he here for? Will getting out of the car help him?
No, he shouldn’t think about it. He pulled his wet clothes and discarded it on the floor. He shouldn’t—
“Oh, damn… yes!” Dean looked so red in the face it was nearly impossible not to kiss him on the spot. It was adorable to see Dean behave this way, also that Dean listens to him. True, he prefers it if Dean became more aggressive, but just remembering how the man was during the long break reminded him Dean was no pushover. That Dean was someone who just respects his wishes this way. Dean was truly beautiful the way he just cares about Castiel.
“It’s just like the city dump,” Castiel muttered to himself, “How did these things get here? No respect for school property.” He walked a few more and thought the task was endless. He got most of the small trash but then groaned when he emerged from the trees and saw a pile of rubbish left in the middle of the forest.
"We'll be back to hunting soon… and I suppose things will be back to normal again..."
"Who the fuck are you, huh? Who?!"
He was sure if he wasn’t an angel, it would leave a bruise. Not that Dean Winchester hadn’t bruised him in the past few months that they’ve been together, he just didn’t understand why Dean had to mark him like a territory—a point taken for his mark on Dean’s shoulder—but that’s just it. Ever since another mark was bestowed on Castiel, Dean had been very territorial on marking every other part of him.
After the sex, Castiel had become even more possessive which was sending Dean to places. He had never seen anyone wanting to be with him so bad before. And he wouldn’t preach—he knows if anyone flirted with his Cas, he’ll throw a fit but the short display of temper was forgotten when Jason spotted them and chatted with Dean too, inviting him to a bonfire event.
“University. He’s gonna become a lawyer.”
"You'll forget me too. The Mark will do that," the calmness of his voice was opposite the radiating feeling of excitement Castiel felt from their pressed body.
“Stop saying that.”
” Dean breathed, hot press of his mouth over Castiel’s ear. Their gazes meet, Dean was all fire. “
Dean's grin was wide. "No raincheck over that ever again.
This was all a trap.
“You said you’d do what’s customary? And you do it so you don’t stand out, you blend in—that’s the whole purpose of your training being a hunter, right?”
“Wow, Cas, you remember that?” Dean was in awe. “You’re really something, buddy.”
He could get used to this every day as long as Dean would have him.
“Novak. Castiel Novak?” called his teacher.
It was mind blowing the way Dean buries inched deeper every time Castiel pressed down. Dean's free hand left his left hipbones to jack his over leaking cock. The sensation it brought was too stimulating.
“It was an overreaction.” Dean agreed.
Then Sam spoke first, throwing Dean off, Castiel sensed. What they found out from Sam had Castiel clutch his arm where the Mark suddenly burned anew. He and Dean exchanged looks and one look—just one look told him of the horror that Dean was going through in his head—and once again it was like getting trapped in Purgatory again where Castiel watched Dean get knocked down his feet. The terrifying feeling, he felt while Dean was praying to him resonated that moment in the car.
How can someone be so… brave?  And who was the culprit? He tried to get up, but only managed to get entangled with his pants halfway down his knees. Cursing under his breath, he never wanted to run after someone and haul him back to his arms, the same way he never wants to punch someone for disturbing them. He scrambled to get his pants back and hurried after Dean.  His heart skipped a beat when he heard Dean roar angrily from inside the kitchen, followed by loud clangs and clatters on the floor.
“Yeah, I get it, but we’ll grab lunch first before we run amok around. Don’t be in a hurry to ditch me, Cas.”
“We did, but there will be Federal meeting later at 1600 so get in my office once you finish debriefing him too. Officer Novak here will be in charge of the Alpha unit every time there are targets out. Anyway, you don’t seem like you have a problem with that anymore, right, Winchester?”
Castiel stayed by the wall and pressed the earphone on his ear wishing Dean would speak and announce his position already. That was when he saw a shadow hiding on one of the containers and aimed a warning shot there. The shadow hid at once and Castiel's eyes glinted in the dark and the exchange of shots happened to the bullet missing his head by an inch. He took the guy down.
“No, they taught us how to look for pattern and identify bombs. He’s got a disturbing list of items that I haven’t seen outside my days in Kosovo.”
“What—hey—” But Castiel had gone with Baby into the field for a ride. The hurdles were still at the sides and they won’t be getting into that until late in the afternoon. So Castiel enjoyed the ride with Dean alongside him. They crossed the field to the forestry, even enjoyed the view by the rice fields which, to Castiel’s not so surprise, were still part of CALS.
“Where are you going, we’re not done.”
“Cas, do warn when you unfold your wings, dammit. A guy’s trying not to be swept away here.” He straightened himself and got on his feet too like the angel.
“As you wish.”
The cash register dings and Nora looked up beaming.
“Oh, they’re so cute!” wailed the girls as they gathered near the pen to pet the tiny souls. “I want to keep one if they stay that size forever!”
Castiel listened closely, finding comfort at Dean’s shoulder bumping into his. “Why does the school have two baseball fields? Is that normal?”
“That’s sensational media for you, Dean. That’s why you should never believe anything without verifying your facts.”
“A trap door!” Anna said excitedly as she surprised their teacher Castiel recognized as Mr. Sergei, who stepped back in astonishment.
Dean’s grin was too meaningful and Castiel found himself thinking of the room on the opposite wing. It was Dean’s room, what did it look like inside…
The night was long for Castiel beside Dean. He was grateful Dean’s parents were nowhere around. The noise they made was not so subtle, leaving Castiel embarrassed when Dean slumped back beside him on the bed, their bodies sticky and sweaty from hours of action. He leaned to Dean, the side of his head on top of Dean’s chest as they wrapped in each other’s warmth.
“Just. There.” And he stepped backward from Dean, eyeing the doors carefully in case anybody saw them. Thankfully there was no one in the room except the horses.
“Sure is too early. I can’t have a handyman distracted in the first five seconds, that’d be a bad start for porn clip, right?” The fork fell down from Dean’s hand with a clatter. Castiel was so pleased with himself watching Dean’s whole face flush red to the point of bursting.
“I didn’t say I was going to name the piglet—” Castiel insisted.
Castiel nodded because why not? But he was getting disheartened at his slow progress and it was already Monday. Aside from the cost, there are now more people planning to come. What if he couldn’t do it? Maybe he should put the idea into a halt until he was certain it was really possible for someone like him to do it.
In which they learned of ovens
“I'm nervous, my legs won’t stop shaking,” Charlie admitted as they waited for their turn with Dean and the more experienced seniors showed them the proper ways of jumping the hurdles. Castiel watched Dean attentively. He was really good. There were no errors on the hurdle jump and he looked so happy. Castiel aimed for that too. He had progressed well with practices; he was sure he could nail it. But at the end of the day, Baby would just stop before the hurdle and refuse to jump.
“So, what’s your plan? It’s almost half-past two and Eileen’s on the way. You don’t want me hanging around for that so are we doing the divorce?”
Castiel looked around from his notes while massaging his knees. It was his study time and he was in his dorm with his two roommates who were also on their computers. The room was large enough to accommodate three tall college students. There were two double-deck beds and while Castiel occupied the lower bunk, Inias took the upper bunk while Adam had the last bunk all to himself. They put most of their extra sheets on the empty upper bunker.
Dean chuckled behind him, moving his legs with the sound of the fabric against his skin, deliberately wrapping his right leg on top of Castiel’s bent thigh, and spooning the angel impossibly closer and kissing his exposed skin. Castiel was pretending to sleep by this time, waiting to see how far Dean would go in provoking him. It wasn’t that he was uninterested, he’d kiss the life of Dean if he could, but letting Dean initiate was a kind of Castiel’s guilty pleasure given the number of missed opportunities the hunter had made him endure. But now that they are together and so out of the closet, Dean could barely keep his hands off him. Castiel enjoys every minute of it.
“That’s not—” Castile half rose from his chair, heart thudding in his chest. Dean sounded so frustrated and weak in his ear.
Dean looked up with Castiel’s cock half in his mouth, green eyes bright. Castiel bit his lips. He caressed his cheeks and to his surprise, the demon leaned on his touch while he licked the head of Castiel’s cock. When he opened his eyes, they were still full green.
Castiel’s lips trembled.
“We’re eating for sure.” Castiel told him.
Dr. Novak ticked something on his note. Dean couldn’t be bothered.
“On the contrary,” April caught his eyes, “I think you just made everyone reconsider what we’ve taken for granted.”
"Yeah?”
, keeping most of the teens near the platform swaying in the music.
"What?"
Or that was what Sam said. Dean gave in in the end. The way Sam sounded; he was doing that puppy eyes on the phone. Dean grunted and agreed but truthfully, he didn’t even know if he could set an appointment with the guy, let alone if he was accepting patients. But once Sam had made up his mind to do something it would only be a matter of time before Dean has everything he needed.
said a rough voice of an old man from the receiving end.
"I'm doing it already," the hunter answered.
He palmed his face as he stayed in the library, wishing he could just hold Dean.
"I said drop your weapon!" Roman commanded but the Dean didn't make any movements aside from pointing the gun at him. Castiel couldn’t quite make out Dean’s form as the focus light from the helicopter was only on the hostage taker but something seemed wrong. Abaddon wasn’t struggling as she should. Castiel frowned. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Dean’s other SWAT members cover the area. It was an all-out situation.
“Yes, my husband?” he had to say it. Cas’ deep voice was just too full of concern and Dean was still clueless about how he got so damn lucky to have him.
“That? It’s to remind my enemies that I have returned successfully. Possibly to also stir some effect on the underground world.”
"You're confident," Castiel couldn't help smiling. "I feel... If I could wrench my heart for you, I'd give it to you."
“You enjoying yourself, Cas? You look like you’re pooping.”
Before Dean could say anything, he was yanked by the hood of his clothing. It was the bodyguard ready to chew him out. Dean’s initial instinct to punch was toned down by his weak limbs. But collapsing on a bodyguard’s arm seemed pathetic. The crowd was growing restless and Dean was beginning to panic when the deep growly voice pulled him back to focus. Those translucent eyes were his sedative.
"Dean Winchester?" called the teacher.
Castiel’s heart stopped.
“Really? Wow, I never really know anyone who’d be here if they’re not from a family that runs a farm. I didn’t even have to take the exam to get in. If you went here for a purpose, that must mean you have a certain dream, right?
Eyes flooded his surroundings.
“You don’t have to keep giving me stuff, I already owe you a lot,” Dean said, flushing as he cradled a dozen of red roses on his arms.
“Yes.” Dean breathed.
“It’s also very impressive. It’s not like any cutting of the meat…it’s more like dissecting. I think it’s really cool to do anything with that kind of focus.”
“Oh yeah, we’re also going to have a horse-riding event, that should be cool…”
Jason laughed.
"Of course,” Castiel says without hesitation, “I enjoyed our moments together, Dean. I’d really like to have all my firsts with you.”
“Doing so, boy, I thought for a second there I was dead.”
“Stalking?”
Too bad Castiel had to share it with a silent Dean. They walked in the darkness of the night and headed to the greenhouses with a space between them. The strawberry greenhouse was peaceful when they arrived. He followed Dean to the tiny shed house where they were keeping the garden tools and sat by the door without preamble. They had a good view of the greenhouse’s door from their position. Castiel leaned his back on the wall and sighed.
“Okay, souvenir freak—"
That did it and before Castiel can stop himself, he leapt forward and thrashed Dean on the wall, knocking everything on the floor and crashed while he grappled the demon’s thick neck, a hand enclosed on his throat. His anger was palpable at the provocation. He knew the demon could read him as easily as he could read it and that’s what frightened him—but nothing goes before saving Dean.
“Alright.” Castiel excused himself from the kitchen with a hidden smile on his lips. He checked on the delivery and was advised another fifteen minutes so he grabbed his laptop to the kitchen just to accompany Dean who had insisted something was wrong with his doorknob.
"You must not let anything to happen to this person."
“I like normal.”
“In any case we came here for the arrangement of her personal bodyguard.”
Castiel gritted his teeth. The gall of the demon to threaten him and to touch Dean in a way only Castiel knows how. The audacity of the demon to even think he would make love with Dean in this form—
“I’ve been told,” Castiel immediately tightened his hold on Dean’s waist jacket as the horse moved. It walked lightly with hooves falling in rhythmic clip-clop-clip-clop. It took him a little while to adjust, but it was still impossible to get comfortable with something moving beneath his thighs at this height.
“This is not running away; this is being methodical. C’mon, let’s get you up, buddy.”
“I—” Castiel swallowed, momentarily lost.
“I’m not sure—”
“Of course.” Castiel shouted back grimly, “Go!”
“I want you. I’ll make you mine. You’re mine,” Dean huffed behind him, grinding his length at the crack of Castiel's ass; keeping a very strong hold on the angel’s arms, pressing him against the bathroom wall.
How he wanted to ask Dean a lot of questions but instead—
“You’re so beautiful, I’m sorry I can’t stop now…” Castiel was debauched and pink in the face. Dean was still hot as a ray of sunshine. Dean licked his cheeks and bit his chin. “You’re so soft, you taste like cotton candy.” Dean breathed, leaning again to kiss him again.
“Dean, your… you’ll burn your back…”
Dean’s face flushed. “Y-you wanted to do that to me?” he forgot to breathe as Castiel grabbed his waist and loaded Dean back on his lap so Castiel was staring up at him from the bed. To think that his Castiel—his angel—thinking of doing it with him—of wanting Dean was enough to exorcise his soul out of that body.
“No, let him." the celebrity doctor eyed him and Dean felt conscious of his appearance. "Do you want a ride?”
“He only says that because he got on the fifth base with Eileen.” Dean grinned.
The next events were blurred in Dean’s mind. There was a moment they had to stop to breathe, and then they were out of the car and making out boldly in some large hall. The kissing didn’t stop even while they were dragging their feet on stairs—why were there stairs? Dean couldn’t get out of the kiss long enough to see where they were but there was a tall-ass ceiling and roof. Dr. Novak kissed Dean like a pro-sucker puncher. Whatever reservation and coldness the doctor had, he left them all in the car. His power kiss was distracting enough and soon they were behind closed doors. That’s when Dean’s heart really plummeted from the sky when he glimpsed a bed— his whole body shut down.
“I’m okay, Dean,” he said quietly, really looking him deep in the eyes, "I'm sorry for worrying you." Dean bit back his response and bowed his head. Castiel rubbed his thumb on Dean's wrist. "You said you wanted to tell me something after I jumped, right? I really want to hear it."
When he returned, Castiel welcomed him with open arms as they make out on the couch. Castiel couldn’t describe his excitement upon having Dean slowly pushed him down the couch, hands pressing down his sides. Feeling his stomach up to his chest until Castiel’s back is plastered on the soft couch.
“Dream?” Castiel paused, his mind blank. It must be nice if that was the case, but he was just only running away from his parents. That didn’t sound like something he could share. “I’m here to find out. Maybe.”
Their next teacher for food science came in, heard what was being explained about food flavor and started writing on the board as well. Castiel listened aptly to the discussion of the two.
A thought disrupted by his Lieutenant, Gabriel Novak waving a hand.
“Take it.” Dean said crisply. A swift sound in the air. Abaddon screamed. Dean tackled the man who cried in pain while holding his right hand but it didn’t stop him colliding his head with Dean’s jaw. The captain growled and elbow-pressed him on the ground. His men flooded in and the woman was taken to safety.
“Um… doing this in the stable,” he said in embarrassment.
Even then he was very careful of watching Dean’s eyes in case it turned into chaotic black until— Dean was suddenly all over him, pressing close and knocking his nose sharply.
The wail got louder and closer, the kind that distracts like an alarm. Castiel’s gaze dug a hole as he glanced up at the window. These cats have been at it lately, this summer heat in June. He had suspected his neighbor, Mrs. Butters, had never gotten her cats neutered, so no wonder every two weeks was a nightmare. He was just glad there were no ticks to deal with. He was a very tidy person that gave room to no pest, but he was amenable to pets as long as they don’t bother him.
The man nodded with a grimace. “Abusive relationship?”
Castiel had been following the conversation on the communicator and sighed deeply when he heard Dean’s voice. He just had to trust that his husband there. Setting on the radio with the Bravo team and calling more bomb squad officer, Castiel gave them the type of improvised explosives at hand and then grabbed the closes bulletproof vest and followed the Alpha team. He was a member of that and was just right to be right with them to the end.
“Easy for you to say,” Dean muttered to which the angel tilted his head but Dean will be damned if he told his friend the reason for his restlessness. Maybe staying with Cas in such close proximity was a bad idea after all.
The radio crackled on Benny’s side. Report from Team Charlie came. Dean caught Benny’s grunt as he surveyed himself on his car’s side mirror and waited for the report to come in. Did they get Roman Cartwright or not?”
Castiel couldn't help it, he reached for Dean's shoulder to soothe him.
Dean was sure he wouldn’t complain. They were still at it till the break of dawn, Castiel bouncing on Dean’s lap, legs spread, dick springing in the air the way he was so lost into getting Dean deeper inside him. He was so damn loud, so damn hot and sexy and all for Dean. Hell, if this was what it meant for the angel to be free, Dean will be with him in the ride along the way. He reached out to Castiel’s nipples and twisted them then held his waist as Castiel was exclaiming Enochian profanities in the air. They were loud it was impossible that the whole Bunker did not hear them.
“Consider it free service. No one’s getting to you, they have to get through me.” Dean knocked a knuckle on the flat door.
"You know, ever since Purgatory when I nearly lost you again, I've been thinking a lot of things about you. So much, but the mark nearly had me throwing it away"
“B-but the last time with—with this rumor I thought you’d remove me from the school since this time it’s true!”
“This is insane,” April’s eyebrows were both up in the sky, “You mean with him?” she pointed at Castiel who felt her consternation.
“So why show up at that interview?”
"Be quiet! If you wanted to die so badly, then go ahead— you already got a grazing bullet on your arm saving me—and you wanted to blow up now too? How many bombs and bullets do you plan to take!? You're not bulletproof you know—!”
Castiel watched him quietly for a while before sighing and putting his hands together. He leaned his arms on his knees and looked at him gravely.
In the morning he did his routine. He fixed breakfast, took a shower in less than two minutes and sat on the couch. On weekdays, his routing would include preparing for work in the local post office. People say it was the dullest job, but for Dean, it was just the right amount of work. In his spare time, he calls his brother and if time allowed it, Sam, his younger brother calls him from University. Sam was his very smart, highly intelligent younger brother whom Dean loved very much. He always boasted to his co-workers how Sam Winchester was going to be the best lawyer in all states, something which his younger brother was only too humble to claim. He was also living far away from Dean which worked just fine. The way he was now, he’d never let his younger brother see him. But it must’ve been for the worse that Sunday morning when Sam called him unexpectedly through zoom.
Gavin promised Castiel that he would crash in the dormitory for a private tutorial tonight after all their tasks. Castiel agreed while his mind drifted to the club he still needed to choose.
“—ever.” He supplied.
"You're obviously not one!" he growled.
Dean gritted his teeth. What the hell? Did the guy just insult him—!? Dean will have him know that when he was in a good form, he was a hot piece of ass! And what the fuck’s with that attitude?
“But I’m ecstatic with yours.”
“My husband was hurt; I hope you don’t take that lightly.” Castiel on the other hand, move around Dean’s bed and stood closer to him, placing a comforting hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean had scrutinized Cas from head to foot and sighed in relief to know he too was unharmed. He eased back on the bed and dropped his head back as Castiel tucked the blanket up to his chest with the gentlest touch.
“You never sleep."
“So, do you have a family? Steve?”
In a few strides, Dean pulled him into a tight embrace that crashed Castiel's wall and numbed his skill
“What is it?”
Castiel thought about it. Maybe he will aim for being top after all. No big deal, small goals. He listened to the rest of his classmates and made a conclusion that yes, he really was unlike any other. Will this school also be concerned with high grades?
Dean could feel his heart race not because of the danger at hand, but because of the memory of hiding in the closet as his parents fought. It rattled his mind, it made him lose his footing and before long, he was gone into the darkness. The next events came in flashes of memory. The door opening, men crowding them. The shouts. Castiel holding on to him and him to Cas. Dean could understand the gravity of the situation, he wanted to help out. Yet...
“My dads are hunters too. They catch monsters.” Jack blinked at the astonished smile he received from the mother.
"You asshole, I know a body contract-- but an angel like you--"
“Guys? Um… a room? There seemed to be nothing left here to breathe…”
“It was just there when I turned it on.”
"Is that right?"'
“Who started this rumor?” and they all pointed at the pale Gavin.
“You are covered in sweat. Did you panic again?”
“Gavin, that’s too much to ask from Castiel, y’know?” laughed Cole Trenton in good humor, “C’mon, we’ll have a rotation with the practicum, school stuff and a mandatory club activity—give him a break.”
“It is until you attach a good bridge to it, but still an island, right?”
Castiel tilted his head at the pet house and drew near. Something pink and round with pointy ears emerged from the inside. Castiel’s jaw dropped at how cute—very cute the piglets were with their clean tiny body, beady eyes and curly tails— they were all immediately heart struck.
“Geez—”
There’s a skip of his heart when he thought Castiel let go—and Dean almost lost control but the angel’s strong arms are around him the next second. He felt Castiel’s hold on him tightened.
His father was forever just a title. He was never Castiel’s family. He remembered Dean. Thought of Dean’s family, their friends, the connection he made here. No, family doesn’t simply describe it. Family doesn’t end in blood.
Castiel stood at the back as she called for attendance and began the day’s lesson with piggery in the background.
“You were saying about cats?”
It all felt like a wild dream.
“What can I do for you handsome men?”
"My… my, aren't you looking as dull as ever?"
black eyes swirls to green then black again, red tongue licking out. Castiel threw him a look.
Castiel’s heart sank when Dean's face crumpled and his lips began to tremble.
“Fuck me, you dumbass.” Dean grinned.
Dean didn’t answer at once. Exactly how he tells Cas he wanted to spend this vacation with him seemed out of the option now that the angel has given him a free pass. Dean understood of course, but somehow this vacation is turning out of the least of his expectation.
“You’re getting in over your head again. I don’t want
“Dean? Are you alright?”
“Yeah, so she’d know you by sight and get used to you. I think she already recognizes you, though. You did ride her once. Go ahead, just put it in your palm like this.” Dean took his wrist and planted the carrot on his palm with its point upward. He gently pulled Cas near Baby who snorted at Dean.
Or at least hot in everyone’s eyes.
“So, the bartender…” Castiel hesitated.
"What are you doing?" he asked, knowing exactly the answer. Dean's eyes twinkled playfully as his hand reached under the hem of Castiel's red shirt and flip it up, revealing Castiel's soft staff.
“Cas, believe me when I say you are, okay? But since you seem to like me too, I—I want to be committed—”
“You’re fully covered,” Castiel commented, impressed when Dean carried everything on his broad shoulders and stopped in front of him. “Is it going to be noisy unscrewing the ceiling?”
They watched Adam leave. Inias and Castiel glanced at each other. As if on cue, there was a knock on the door and Gavin came in for his late-night tutorial.
Castiel fell back on the chair, blue eyes at Dean. Something about the way Dean said it, the way he firmly put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder to keep him on the couch before walking to the door and opening it. The accountant waited in silence until Dean closed the door. He didn’t know how to break the ice until Dean opened the box and inhaled the steaming content.
The doctor told him that the real success was once Dean was able to sleep on the bed without needing to be hypnotized. Most of the time, Castiel just lived on, if he wasn’t stuck with Dean, he was in his office doing god knows what for his own science. Dean only interrupted him once in the library when it was almost time for Dean’s afternoon practice of nap on the bed. Contrary to his fantasy, the doctor never touched him or made any untoward actions after their brief kisses. Dean wished the doctor would be more spontaneous.
Had Castiel looked back, he would’ve seen the complete shock on Gavin’s face.
He could just hear Gabriel’s exasperated sigh.
“If it’s about flavor factor, then it’s got to be the whey pig. Whey comes from milk. It is the liquid left over when the milk has been curdled and strained. You end up with quite a lot during the cheese-making process. In the past, it just ended up being thrown away. So, what I’m saying is a great example of this is the whey pigs. They are a brand of pig raised on a diet—”
he shouted amidst the explosion they were both caught in. Fiery smoke covered the air, blasting heat scorching his skin, and Dean realized that no—
his inspiration was. Meg teased him. Hanna was obviously very curious, but Castiel’s lips were sealed. He wanted to savor it without spoiling it around and no peer pressure could make him spill, especially if he thought he really wanted to give it a chance. He and Dean had been texting since Wednesday, Dean dropped by on Thursday evening to check the house and consequently have dinner. It was a really nice evening with them catching up with each other, Castiel asked about Sam and Dean’s job at Bobby’s Services and Dean asking about the door.
Castiel thought he had seen it all but it was nothing when he scaled just how large the horse field could be. The stable was huge where eight horses were kept. There were also two large paddocks with tall fences for practice riding and beyond it was a free field. Castiel watched Dean practice with Baby with three more seniors from the Agricultural Engineering Department, Lee, Joe and Ash. They were all on the paddock riding horses elegantly that had him envious. Dean saw him watching and waved at him, even so, he never looked as if he’d fall. He was that good. Dean winked at him and Castiel just fell in love all over again.
“Don’t get scared now. Horses can feel if you’re scared so it might just panic and throw us out of its back so hold tight.” The guy chuckled like being thrown away was the funniest thing in the world.
“You’re quite good at wrapping things up, aren’t you officer?”
. He jolted at the mere thought of his bedroom locked at the far end of the apartment. He had no need for it. So let it go, let it be over, let it be gone, let it pass.
Find out, the school did. Before lunchtime, Dean and Castiel were called in the guidance office by their adviser, Mr. Henriksen.
Castiel swallowed his impatience. This was the last lead he got from his trusted source, the last bit of information before he loses the thread leading to his friend. It’s been three months since Dean escaped the Bunker before they could even perform the ritual to turn him human again, the same night Sam was nearly killed by his own brother if he hadn’t intervened in time. But just like Dean to slip his fingers.
“Did you get it?” he called behind him.
“Occasionally. But I’ve been told I’m bad if there’s company.”
“No, sweetie, you can talk about it all you want,” Jason coed, indicating the stool, “Why don’t you sit down and entertain me of this ‘education’ while I get you a free drink?”
“My mom said dad hit a deer accidentally on the road last week and leftovers were in the refrigerator. There’s only him and dad living here so it’s really impossible to finish the entire deer meat. Ah, I should’ve told you before cooking it,”
Dean made outrageous noise and struggled. Castiel gave his first order. "Stop."
"Dean already made a decision, Castiel. I would grant it in a heartbeat but I am trying to make you see what you two are doing to each other. Secrets are good, secrets are sexy but isn’t it about too late? Look at you now? Look where you both are. You still want to deny this choice?” a heartbeat of silence. "Do you let go or do you hold on?”
“Oh, am I?” Dean leered, “You know this place has got about a dozen other demons just waiting to jump you?”
There were cheers but Dean sure didn’t miss it.
Dean listened as Castiel washed his face in the bathroom of the small office. They both didn’t say anything after the AFT team got there and Cas got his bomb gear good enough to disarm it. By the end of it, Cas had fallen in silent reverie, only exchanging a few words once the content of the improvised bomb was done.
Castiel did as he was told and groaned loudly when he sunk into Dean’s tightness. Dean’s proud of that, he’s never let anyone touched him there for the best of years.
“Hey, Dean, stop flirting in the corridor,” Cole nudged past them with a huge smirk on his face. Castiel rolled his eyes and glanced back at Dean, curious at the tinge of pink that suddenly shaded his freckled cheeks.
“Do you trust me?”
“Thank you, Jack. That is sweet.” He caught Dean staring at him in awe.
Dean could only nod. From their debriefing with the bomb squad earlier, it was agreed that the possibility of this Cartwright brother to strike is out of the question. It will happen. So he understood where his husband was coming from and vowed never to make his lovely husband that anxious. Castiel moved to the
And what would happen to him if he gives up now? Return to his house and be the same petrified guy? Dean would rather get chummy with this handsome asshole than be back in his den of darkness.
Dean’s body stiffened. Castiel stood by what he said and waited for what he dreaded the most to steal him from Dean’s warmth, but it never came. Castiel sat up straight to find Dean watching him while Amara was staring at something they couldn’t see on the wall. Castiel felt it, the tug of something dangerous lingering by and he took extra measures to really dig Dean back.
“CAS!?
“No, no you’re not destroying any mood at all.”
“He was completely mad, simple as that.” Castiel quietly leaned his chin on his hand, raising a dominant eyebrow at everyone in the meeting room. “He wanted to erase all evidences in the Forensics building that utter fool. There was no way he was thinking straight. We’re just luck he is a fixated guy who’d rather get toe to toe with us than involve innocent civilian.”
“Others?” Castiel blinked.
“Um… Dean? Am I paying you enough for this?”
Soon, the air was filled with the most delicious scent of pizza and everyone’s mouth watered. Castiel saw Dean swallow hard and so he took the spatula and nodded at his classmates.
“Catch up with what?”
“I think this is amazing, Dean, I’m sure it tastes good.”
“Cas…” Dean pressed his lips thin, but Castiel didn’t budge either until the hunter was scratching the back of his head. “Fine. What do you wanna do?”
“Dr. Novak?”
“You are clearly stressed out.”
“Yes, sir, I’m quite interested in that too,” he said, feeling the meaningful eyes of the teacher. So maybe the affair of him and the pig did reach the staff as well because Mr. Tilghman was quite agreeable to explain. He even drew a cycle on the board.
“I uh… I don’t have any comfortable shirt… I know you bought me some new clothes but I don’t feel… Is it okay if I borrow your shirt?”
“That’s not good for the skin, Dean.”
“Gabe, where’s Abaddon?”
“Who knows. Maybe if I got bored tonight.”
“So, you were listening?”
"I wish it'd be that easy," Castiel answered as he drives with one eye at his partner, "if all clues point correctly at him then all we have to worry about is his whereabouts... by the way, what do you make out of Abaddon 's story?”
“I wasn’t just your guinea pig, aren’t I?” he asked out of nowhere just as the doctor leaned forward and sat closer to his head. Unlike before, Castiel didn’t take out his pocket watch. Instead, he put his slender fingers together and just watched Dean for some time.
So, he found and exorcised demons like when he was in hell, it ended with flashing light of his grace bursting and smiting every demon on sight, leaving him exhausted. He stumbled raggedly out of the bar. There was no one at the gloomy parking lot that was filled with people an hour ago.
“It’ because you misunderstood…”
“Yes, sir!” snickered the team.
"Me?"
“Mmm?”
He took Dean’s hand and lead him to the bathroom but before he could turn on the water, Dean pressed behind him, hands holding his hips firmly. He felt Dean’s already hard cock poking the meat of his ass.
“What!?” They all stopped to stare at the boy who looked smug under the afternoon light. Castiel stared back too. Only Dean didn’t seem surprised.
“Calm down, we have summer breaks and winter breaks so you don’t need to exaggerate. Plus, aren’t second years allowed to take a dormitory? We could if you want.”
Castiel watched Dean’s every move. The man punched the pillows then threw the blanket over them, raising a leg on the couch and playing the button on the remote.
Castiel’s whole body numbed and went on a long pause for his mind to catch up. Coldness washed through his entire being, of sorrow and guilt at finally understanding. Dean left all alone that night when the empty took him. Seeing him there, punching and clawing the stone wall tightened the grip in his heart. He had never seen- he never knew what happened to Dean after. Not after he left him, alone yes, but safe. But looking back, it was never about being saved—it was about being together. Something Castiel had never regretted until now, seeing the way Dean was breaking from the inside.
“It like a parody of Sound of Music with whiskers and furs.”
“Yeah? Like you'd keep your promise. You know what you look like when you lie? But you won’t let me fuck you or let me touch you when we get back. You’re going to avoid me and I don’t like that. Screw you, I’ll make you mine,” he sucked Castiel’s earlobes before running his teeth on his shoulder and biting his skin. Biting his lip to still the stifle of cry, Castiel raised his broken arm and pressed the shower button.
It’s really strange how he was thinking too much about a guy he barely knew, but what was most interesting, as he let the water run down his body, was how he also thought Dean was an ass. Yet someone with a temper who happened to be willing to help him not burn his house in the first place could be considered nice in his vocabulary. Castiel thought that’s what counts. People couldn’t help it if they have limitations and cat dump was a sure way to say no, but it’s when they got their hands full and still willing to help that really makes them shine.
“It’s a barn house,” Sam said when Dean stood beside him.
“Hey, love birds, let’s go.” Adam called, “Or we’re leaving you behind.”
“Dean,” Castiel clasped Dean’s upper arm and clung on his firmly. He had a bad feeling if he let go that Dean would really charge at something in the dark and get hurt. Dean’s face was screwed in vigilance, his brows furrowed so deep, his dark eyes glinting darkly that Castiel tightened his hold. “Dean, maybe it’s just the cat…”
“Vacation, Cas. It’s about doing what you like best.” Dean tipped his shades staring directly at his brother, “Well? Are you going or you watching me nap—? I mean, relax?”
"Don't ever think I don't know what to do with you."
Castiel didn't realize he stopped breathing. Dean was beside himself angry and threatening.
“Dean, when was the last time you’ve eaten?” Sam repeated like it was something very important.
A few minutes must’ve gone by. The Dean in the memory was nowhere to be seen, leaving Castiel with his face on his palms, breathing heavily where he sat. He felt Dean step in the room. Castiel grinded his teeth. Never again.
“Yes.” Castiel sighed, “he is special to me.”
He trailed the corridor, ignoring all the portraits until he reached the hallway leading to the huge dine room. The door got caught on something as he opened it. Looking down to the cause of the delay, Dean saw legs—and then a body sprawled on the ground.
“I’m fine, it’s only a scratch.” Dean hissed as he tried to get Cas off him but to no avail. Then there were other officers rushing in from the exit.
“Yeah?”
“Sure. You’re Cas. You’re an angel, damn right we’re gonna find a way again. There’s always away. We’ll find it.
“Cas….”
A red dot. appeared on the man’s body. Dean narrowed eyes.
“That’s not really comforting, Anna.”
“Did you see the way Sam looked at me, Cas?”
Amara smiled at him.
“That’s gonna leave a mark,” he muttered under his breath when he got back to his office and stood in front of the mirror of the tiny cubicle for officers.  Holsters empty, guns unloaded on the table, he washed his hand feeling the sting on his lips. Paper works will have to be done now and god knows how many Dean had to finish when there’s a knock on his door.
For me? Dean wanted to kiss him, but then, "Cas, your butler-"
“I couldn’t survive without you is what I understood; you could always move on from my death.”
“There are rumors that the two of you are in a relationship—”
Dean wet his lips noticing Castiel backing at the edge of the bed a little, giving Dean a room to splay his legs. Castiel sure had a nice lewd view since he was the type of guy to enjoy the view too much. Once again, Castiel’s patience seemed solid as a rock the way he just reached for Dean’s ankle, rubbing his thumb along the hollow, then ran his hand up Dean’s leg. Dean had to take a breath of his own by the time Castiel reached his inner thighs and stroke his thumb just close enough to the space of Dean’s cock.
“Fine my ass, hold it, I’m gonna get the first aid kit in the car.”
“Someone’s been cleaning here before us.”
“So, are your fingers okay now?” Dean reached for his hand seeing that there was still a couple of bandages on Castiel’s fingers. “It’s been a few days since then, and your fingers are still bruised.”
“Yeah, but you still can’t stand real blood and guts, right?” Cole said from the next table. “So, he has it tough.”
“He’s been showing off what you taught him,” said a primly cut dark-haired guy with gleaming eyes Castiel knew to be Benny Lafitte from Forestry Department and Dean’s ‘good friend’, “but he’s got to be right to say you’re something else too. He’s been talking nonstop about ‘Cas this and that’. He’s also been showing you off as a good-looking pizza man. I can see why.”
But the stares kept coming.
He saw three miscalls from his brother. Only three? Dean thought he disappeared last night and Sam only called thrice? Two last night and one this morning. Dean had no friends.
Dean fell silent but it was okay. Castiel could touch him now. Dean’s cheek was warm and his cheekbones felt like they could cut. Castiel wished it cut him so he’d feel more alive. He caressed Dean’s face, ran his fingers down his jaw, palms pressing to Dean’s neck where he could feel his pulse beat. Alive. Castiel felt like crying.
Dean hated himself as he slowly succumbed to the darkness. If he could, he would have wanted to hold on much longer to reality and keep those lips seared hot against his.
"Don't lie."
"I can't lose you, Dean. Not like that, I can't have you forget. I'll lose my mind."
The pain in Dean’s eyes made Castiel grab his hand back and hold tight. This was the anchor that Dean seemed to need so he stayed. They mutually understood there was no repeating what they’ve already gone through for the past month ignoring each other. So, deal with it, they will.
“Oh, it won’t come here. Not when it senses me here. I’ll deal with it, it’s house is practically my Nirvana,” she said pertaining to the Empty before her eyes fell on Dean and Castiel again. “So now what, can I be witness to your cosmic wedding now?”
“Gabriel.” Castiel emerged from the bathroom, toweling his arms with long sleeves pulled up to his elbow. The look on his face tells them he had been doing some really serious contemplation. And it was always regarding Dean.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck and bit his flesh while Castiel panted.  The moment Castiel stroked Dean in earnest, the hunter’s body turned stiff in a silent storm. It took one last thrust from the angel before they were both overwhelmed and cumming together, Castiel filling Dean inside. Dean exploded in Castiel’s hand with every fiber of his being, leaving him panting and pulsating in the angel’s care.
“Yeah, coming, Jack.” Sam suppressed his emotions which was very like him in Castiel’s opinion. Turning to his adopted son, Castiel smiled.
“Oh… he’s… Balthazar from Food Science and uh…” Castiel remembered distinctly how the chicken had been beheaded, “remember we helped them catch the runaway chickens last time?”
“It’s fine, wear it. I’m all covered with lotion, remember?” he smirked and that’s when he really saw Castiel blush. Dean plastered a smile on his face, feeling woozy and delighted.
“Something like that. So, there’s no need to refer me to any red-light district, I’m doing just fine. I’m sorry I had to quit—”
“I’m not ancient.” Castiel bristled.
“Is it really alright for us to be together, Dean? I mean you and I, we’re from different worlds… I mean, I’m sure we’ll discover each other’s differences soon as we continue this relationship and if you want to change your mind because of those differences—”
“What is this?” he surveyed the area and saw more broken things like tv, aircon, cabinets and tireless bicycles in the surrounding, “This stuff must be from the school itself, dammit.”
“Well, folks do buy their race horses from us sometimes too. It’s been planned that I will take over after my dad. It’s usually how it is for most students in CALS. What about you? If you’re not a farmer’s child, you must’ve come from somewhere far.”
“Dean? Are you alright?” Castiel leaned down to him while Dean scrambled to his feet in panic and pain. He could feel his cheeks heating when he looked Castiel over where there’s too much flash of skin it’s almost indecent. Only on his shorts and nothing else like some hunky barbarian in Baywatch with blinding flesh and muscle everywhere he looked, humps lips lush and inviting. Fucking sex hair brushed up was distracting. Castiel topless was Dean’s catnip. Castiel looked so delectable and handsome it’s almost tempting. Dean bit his bottom lip, heart beating in his ears.
“Let me repeat before you have any panic attacks,” the doctor drawled on with a complete with a bored face, “The way you are now, you
Castiel just watched him with a squint before nodding back at the cottage. “You easily make friends. Are you planning to sleep with him tonight?”
Dean was lost in his movements. Slamming his hips forward again and again, the sound of skin slapping on the 1skin, they relished in the moment of passion. Dean bowed his head, hot breath on Castiel’s neck as he bit down and left a mark against his hot neck. It was too much warmth, too much filling until Castiel couldn’t hold his voice back any longer.
Castiel blinked.
"Roman …You're that person who kept sending Abaddon those love letters, weren't you…? The one that provoked your older brother to think you were having an affair?  That’s when he took matters to his hand with that assault that day on her building." Dean took something from his pocket and showed it to him. It was a picture of Abaddon and Roman Cartwright.
The politeness caught Castiel off-guard. He was expecting a more
They never really had a break after. So, it came to a point that Castiel finally lost his battle to the Empty, but not after finally confessing his feelings to the man who deserved the world. Saving Dean was his final swan song. Those memories flashing before one’s death? He had them. They were all about Dean.
Clues lead them around one place and it lead to another!
"He's the pizzaman."
“I mean, the instructions are pretty much textbook and as far as ingredients go, they are easy to find. I think it’s simple.”
Until it was not. Until Sam was telling him it wasn’t working. Why? What could Sam see that Dean couldn’t?
“I was kidding, Dean.” Castiel concealed a happy smile as he bowed his head, then added quietly, "But you try and flirt with her in public and I'll drag you out of the case, you got that!?"
“I didn’t want to cause any trouble,” Dean said shakily, head bowed.
Castiel paused and stared at Dean hard. Wiping the dribble of precum from the corner of his shiny lips, Castiel watched warily as the demon tilted his head.
It was cut short with the angel sealing his loud mouth with a kiss. He melted in Dean’s mouth, feeling the same heat and pleasure of finally touching Dean again. He can’t help sighing, elbows on either side of the demon, trapping him, sinking his lips down to him so Dean’s head gets trapped on the soft linen as he fought to kiss back. The demon had hands on him but Castiel immediately locked both his wrists on the pillow on either side of his bed.
“It’s a storage house keychain, I’m sure,” Castiel said as they drove to where their clues were leading them. The sky was bleak and the cool air made their breathes into a billow of whiteclouds. “I told you I was planning to rent one of the storage houses here because our house is just full of your toys.”
“Jealous bastard,” he chuckled, followed by his sexy grunts in a match of Cas’.
“No.”
Somehow the music from the island still reached them.
God… it was good.
“Problem, Cas?” Dean noticed as they walked back to the truck with Uncle Bobby, “Oh, signal? We don’t get that much coverage here. Do you want to message anyone?”
Kevin Tran.
"That's actually...sweet," Castiel swore no one could move him like Dean does.  So, it was impossible not to initiate when someone so loving and caring was right before his eyes. Someone who wouldn't stop staring down his lips or dive down deep in his eyes as if searching for answers only Castiel held.
“Time-consuming?” that was something he never heard before. But was he disappointed? “Well, you’re right—", No he wasn’t.
“You don’t look too good, squirrel. If it’s insomnia, you know the healthy road. Seems unworking though. But if you really want something else that could tire you out, I know a place in the red-light district. If you really want help scratch the itch. That’s all I’m saying.”
Dutifully, Dean closed his eyes.
The tourist stared at Dean and blinked uncertainly.
“Right, well, you always have to do firsts with me so…”
"Fuck, Dean,"
“What the
"What are you doing?" he mumbled, annoyed as his brain was reacting late to everything his eyes were feasting on. Dean turned and Castiel watched his mouth drop open, his eyes widen. Castiel blinked owlishly at the man, feeling the heat of Dean's eyes raking his body.
“And… who is this young man?”
“I just wasn’t used to it so my hands got all cramped and stiff. Maybe I’m not really cut out to be a chef, whereas you, Dean Winchester. You’ve got such good hands, I’m sure you can cook anything in the world if you want to.”
“Oh, thinking of the devil,” coughed Adam behind him and Castiel turned. His eyes widened to see Dean riding Baby towards the stall with passerby making way for him in fear of the gigantic black horse.
Until Dean licked his lips. Castiel's heart thunders. Dean never does that, not to him. Not until he was really interested in something.
“You bet it is. Let me just call uncle and we can eat.
“You’re in no position to talk!” Castiel extracted three wires from the best and traced it up to Dean’ shoulder, “This is no good. Removing the jacket will automatically set it off. How did you get strapped like this?”
“I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been in a relationship. Do you guys usually set up marriages on the first date? We barely know each other.”
Mr. Eye-lashes beheaded the chicken in one swift cut of his blade. Blood spurted like a fountain around the smiling sophomore.
“H-hey, I—I’m not hitting on you, Cas! I’m just saying the truth is all!” The blush on his cheek had Castiel staring.
Castiel felt strangely nostalgic. It hasn’t been a few months since he met Dean but it felt like he was his whole life. From the old him who was so lost and uncertain of his future, to this person that he is now who had found his place beside Dean, who was now looking at the future, who would have thought the countryside could give him such a gift?
“Then!” he said without another beat, “We need flour—!”
“I am being responsible, Cas. I left him back in the garden. No one can go there, I swear. I don’t want that power. I just want to be here, to be a regular kid. To be with my family. Do you want me to beg to stay?”
Soft laughter filled their table as they began to eat, sounds of utensils on plates, Dean falling in love with the steak and seafood while Sam enjoyed his salad. Even Castiel praised the bacon and toasted bread. Dean did not miss the cheesecake tropical salad he ate sinfully. Cas never touched his, only saying it tasted funny. But he did get into a conversation with Sam about the dangers of not wearing a life jacket, and that moving more in water actually makes you colder.
“Well, you look underfed and scrawny than the last body check,” Crowley smoothed his tie as he sat behind his desk wearing a neat tailored dark suit, “Can’t afford any health rumors roam around, you see? Don’t want to get unnecessary attention
Dean’s eyes flickered in the dark.
“Way to rub it in,” Dean exhaled.
The silence that followed was deafening.
“It’s me.” Castiel couldn’t take his eyes from Dean.
But this time he figured, there was no reason to be afraid. He saw Dean’s eyes dilate, saw how his mouth worked to say something but leaving everything in the air empty. He could feel Dean’s heart racing once again, Dean living and breathing was everything Castiel wanted.
He was wrong. Dean pulled him up and kissed him before saying—
"Oh? Really?" Sam glanced at Dean who schooled his expression but he noticed a different glint behind Sam’s eyes that looked almost ominous. Dean frowned but Eileen waved at him and sighed a hello.
Dean was cut off from everything except the voice coming above him.
“Have done so. But who says my phones aren’t tapped?”
Castiel focused on licking inside Dean’s lips. It was hot, molten, like how he imagined kissing Dean. He could feel the demon’s hot breath gasping as he worked his mouth. Dean’s fingers had found its place on his chest, rubbing the bud of his nipples and pinching them enough to be both painful and uncomfortable.
“Oh god, was I that rude?” Castiel wanted to melt on the spot.
“You’re too damn hot, I can’t help myself. The moment my eyes fell on you I wanted you so bad, Cas.”
Dean blinked, “But the school is close for a yearly renovation,”
The next few days were spent with club labor and preparing for the upcoming school fair. Castiel was left to organize the stalls assigned for dairy products. As he understood it, people from all over the place visit CALs as it is famous for its varied products from meat to vegetables. Thinking about it, CALs was really a prestigious school with a name already famous to local people that a country fare seemed appropriate. So, it will be an open campus for two days over the weekend, where all their products will be judged by real consumers.
“We’ll get that well deserved vacation soon. Say hi to Eileen for me.”
Unless Dean had gotten a whiff that he was here and purposely slipped away again. Castiel clutched the glasses between his hands. Now what?
“Of course. Though the higher-ups would rather there were less compensations to be made. Let’s be glad again that he didn’t detonate all the six bombs found in the pillar of the building. Hate to say it when mad geniuses really turn it, they flip. Never again. Now you two get out of this building and take your rest before I kick you both in the ass for overworking. Your younger brother sure knew how to spice up words, Dean.”
Dean’s ears pinged. The doctor barely even glanced his way. Why did it feel like he wants to prove himself worthy for this douche? And why was he so insulted just because he initially had some admiration for the doctor? Hell, Dean was clearly attracted to him for some reason and the bull’s eye was he was a jerk. Out if Dean’s many qualities, choosing self-sabotage relationship had been an occurrence. To think he was getting rejected right before they even started flirting—? And for what—
“Mmm…”
“You were having a bad dream.”
“I know he’s dead! But there he was here! With the first blade and I—” he had no words to describe what it was he just saw. Cas’ expression softened and the grip on Dean’s shoulder tightened.
“Yeah, yeah I trust you. But just don’t— don’t do anything to me—hypnotically to make me, you know—uh—unaware of what I’m doing with you? Cuz, uh—y’know—I’m game with anything, I’m mean— just with you—I’ve made up my mind about that," he hated that he was blushing. Was it his fault that guy was like a beacon of light in his nightmares and restless night? That he conceived him as a hero who took him when he was desperate and was kind enough to let him stay in this luxurious place? If anything—wasn’t that kind?
"That's not true," Castiel stared at Dean, perplexed, "Dean, I—"
“Is that why you knocked me out the first time we met each other?”
“Me?” Dean thought about it with arms crossed, making sure not to brush closer to Castiel’s naked blades. He glanced around, “Beats me, I’ve slept enough, ate enough, didn’t even drink that much, it’s tolerable. It’s almost sunset maybe now I’m just going to enjoy the view.”
“Dean! Eat it!”
It was breathtaking.
“Do what you like.” Castiel grumbled just to appease the very active handyman serious with his job. By the end of the day, Castiel was amazed and somewhat amused again at the job Dean Winchester did with his doorknob. He completely changed it and gave Castiel both locks. Castiel almost handed him one just to see how Dean would react but instead told Dean where he kept most of his keys anyway—just inside the pot of hanging plant by the veranda.
“Sergei. Large guy with horse pheromone,” Dean greeted everyone else on the table.
“This is not about me, Dean. Listen to my voice. How do you feel whenever you go to sleep?”
“You’re making selfish decisions again,” Amara said which startled the angel. “I’m sorry, I was still in your head, and really you couldn’t be anymore similar with the Winchesters put together. But you heard me right, what you just had in your head just now? Bad decision, honey.”
“Fine. But you people don’t make it easy. Do you know why I have three therapists so far? Because none of them took me seriously. They told me it’s just insomnia. They even told me to just fuck a woman around to sleep.”
It took Dean a second to calm himself and when it came back to him, he was tongue-tied.
Dean blinked. This guy was an asshole, right? "What?"
Castiel felt eyes bore on him. He didn’t realize he was speaking his thoughts aloud. Clearing his throat, he went on, “I’m sure Dean will find a partner that will suit his needs too,” Castiel said more to himself, “He’s a nice person to begin with.”
“Oh, I just assumed you’re interested in colors—”
“Right. Why are you telling me?”
“But doc, isn’t that an underground organization? Then that means there might be other groups webbed with them? Will you be alright?” he was honestly concerned for the doctor who looked calm despite the possibilities.
“Who’s checking the back door of the building?” he heard one reporter say and Dean’s spirit plummeted to his feet. Did Doctor Novak escape him?
"If you tell me, in the end, to live my life happily and continue fighting, I’ll do exactly that. But I'll forget you. I'll do anything to forget you. I won't even pray to you…" Dean swallowed hard, head bent, tears streaming down his chin. Castiel was shaken. He never thought it would come to this… for Dean to hurt so much he'll relinquish what they had. Dean was not running away, he was… making a choice.
“Cas!” Dean pushed him out of the way where they both landed on the other side of the ground. The pickup truck halted right at the spot where Castiel was just standing moments ago.
“To the infirmary. Let’s hope that’s the only wound you got from that catastrophe. What if you broke your neck?”
“Anyway, I’ll get that cat hole later, tomorrow I’ll come back to fix your door.”
“Yes—you had the potential to make me happy— you pray to me in Purgatory nearly sent half of me to death. That’s why I had to stop you saying it to my face to face or I’d really plunge to my death. But knowing now what’ll happen to you once I’m taken. It’s ironic, it’s a full circle and pointless, but I just—it always comes down to one thing, Dean. I want you—to be happy.”
“I love you,” Castiel murmured. Dean smiled and returned the kiss with fervor.
” Dean began with a laugh.
Dean dropped his head on the angel’s shoulder with a groan. He felt Castiel smile on his cheek, followed by a bite on his earlobe.
Castiel cocked an eyebrow.
Castiel grabbed the scent spray from the cupboard hoping it would work as he sprayed around, but the horrid smell lingered amid the sweet flowery aroma. The nasty smell was all over the place. He went around the house trying to locate where the pungent smell was stronger. He noted that the atrocious dung smell lessened when he stepped in the living room so it wasn’t there, and the more he got nearer the kitchen, the more his olfactory got attacked. So the kitchen it was but look high and low, he still couldn’t find it. Checking his watch, Castiel cursed and considered taking a leave for the day, deciding against it and running up to his room to take a shower. He couldn’t afford to be late on a Monday.
“What are you doing here? If you’re here for Dean—”
To Castiel’s surprise, he wasn’t the first one in the oven area after breakfast. There were already groups from different departments carrying different ingredients that Castiel had asked of them the previous days. A long parallel line of tables was set up on either side of the oven. Anna was there with ten whole pieces of cheese instead of six much to Mr. Sergei’s chagrin. Dean was already being helped by the Forestry department to heat up the oven. The flour was already prepared by the Agricultural Science department while the food processing had it milled. Balthazar had brought a kilo of ham that he asked too, plus the spatulas from their seniors were magnificently done and ready for use.
Castiel pressed his lips. Dean turned to him the moment the class was allowed to explore the rest of the pigpen as Castiel didn’t leave the side of the nursing station.
“My boyfriend.”
A flash of a lady with red-hair crying in the middle of a hostage situation flashed in his mind. But Dean was only concerned with the connection on the case. This was something they already predicted.
Gavin was blushing furiously when he left them after a long talk with the two. He did promise to keep it a secret but Castiel wasn’t sure. After all, it was Gavin who spread the rumor about him and a fellow classmate. Still, the way Dean was so composed as they walked towards the stables for club duties made him feel at ease. He had known Dean to be calm around horses, mostly keeping thoughts to himself but when he reacts it’s all over his face. It was one of those things he found cute about his boyfriend.
“I wouldn’t know,” Castiel replied coolly, “I could get rid of it if it was just on the floor but no, I need someone with expertise. I can pay a good amount for the time and trouble.”
The accountant didn’t hear him right. He was certain some bells above heaven were just ringing in his ears. Magnets buzz in the pit of his stomach, drawing him a step closer, but not too close to be awkward in space. Then he squinted at his serviceman, wondering if he was real.
They were joined shortly by Jack who was carrying a box of decorations with Sam right behind him. It ended with the four of them around the map table with beer and milkshakes to share. By the time they were finished telling the story, and by the time Dean had stopped giving Jack those little shakes of heads conspiringly, Castiel was already frowning hard.
Dean breathed a laugh, “How about in the morning?”
“I’ve eaten pizza before, but it’s frozen and only during Christmas,” Inias admitted. Castiel blinked at them and then there’s Dean already touching the screen with his palm.
"Are we done talking Cas?" the hunter asked with eyes on Castiel's lips. "It's a no to forgetting each other?"
“Do you always treat your patients like this?” Dean followed Castiel in the large corridor with dozens of portraits of people he couldn’t recognize, “Give them gifts?” he didn’t mean to sound jealous—
For Dean to initiate the fix, Castiel could believe that but he's certain there's more to it than a snap of a hand. They could heal but not without struggling. The important thing was Dean is willing, for without it Castiel would not find it in him to forgive himself because above his self loathing, is his vast feelings for Dean. He can believe in that. He can give love a chance if it's Dean.
Morning came, Castiel woke up in a better mood. It was saying something as he was not a morning person without coffee. He didn’t have to wonder about the good feeling, the first ping on his phone was the handsome handyman. The smile upon his lips was wide when he got up to take a shower. He wondered if it showed too much that day because the next thing he knew, his coworkers were pulling him on one corner of the cafeteria. Charlie with her best friend and girlfriend, Pearl who were both working in CSS management began bombarding him with questions.
“I don’t see any problem with it, I think that’s also your biggest charm,” Dean smiled down at him and if Castiel wasn’t blushing, it must be the sun reflecting on his face, “My father said I shouldn’t get attached to animals before too, and for as long as I remember, that’s how it’s been for us. Because it makes things easy. But as I have told you before, you never run away from those. You always look at challenges with eyes forward, even though you know you’d be hurt. That's the kind of honesty other people may seem complicated, but for you, it’s a way of life. I like that about you. I also think about when my dad said big boys shouldn’t cry anymore, but I think that’s also not good. Adults or not, big boys or not, crying shouldn’t be controlled. When you’re hurt, just cry. So go ahead, there’s no better place to do it than with my body, right?”
“What are you saying?”
“It will be alright, Dean. The way you slept last night was so soundly, I didn’t even have the heart to wake you up from your slumber.”
He pointed at Castiel's shirt. The angel blinked and then smiled.
“I already said Dean’s not my boyfriend. We’re just good friends,” he thanked Balthazar for the tools and promised he will return them on time. Someone peered on the doorway carrying a medium sized pig. It was a girl with long blonde hair and pretty petite face.
Dean could only grin.
“I remember you saying in one of your statements that you’ve never seen the guy?” Dean caught Abaddon’s eyes and watch her expression for any clues but she returned his gaze blankly.
“I thought you live reclusively?”
“Okay.”
“It’s Castiel.”
“I know babe, it’s fine. You got me. Now come save me, babe. We gotta have a look at that gash on your cheek. I mean whoever did that to you’s probably dead, but let me kill him many times over for daring to leave a mark on you dammit.”
“W-wait—” Castiel mumbled through the kiss reaching to grip Dean’s shoulder and pushed him back. The blaze on Dean’s predatory look only ignited more.
“Around Friday, then,” Dean tapped a finger on the table.
“Yes,” he took out the cash he got from working at Dean's farm plus his savings for around the same month. He handed it to Ms. Barnes then advised him that he could keep the meat in the meat processing room for as long as he wanted to.
“I feel love.”
“Aren’t we a couple now? You only kiss someone you like, right? What? I thought we’ve been a couple since our first kiss!”
Peeking from the wash room, he saw Garth pointing a thumb over his shoulder, eyes twinkling.
“It’s like nothing really changed from that time—from every mistake I made. From Charlie to the Mark of Cain, all those people I killed— the kid I killed! I got them all killed because I was reckless and irresponsible and do not tell me I did all those for the right reasons! Right reasons never return anyone’s life! So, what the hell are we doing back here after we all died, huh?”
“He’s good. Blending in and relating,” Dean whispered to Cas beside him, shoulders pressing, “It was a right call to bring him along. It unhinges suspicions.”
"So, you decided to put me through these mind games instead?" Dean growled.
“Okay, hey Cas,” Dean nudged Cas and they brought in their bags inside the house where Dean led him in the second room to the left. “You’ll be using my brother’s room. He’s been away for almost a year now too. Do you mind eating anything I could whip from the fridge? I’m sure there is meat there, I just don’t want to surprise you.”
“Son of a bitch.”
Unlike the success of the first night, the following days were not so easy for Dean. Dr. Novak was able to mesmerize him into sleep for a few minutes before waking up ten minutes or so later. Dean would find himself on the bed and scramble out.
"Alpha, Bravo on the Forensics building now!”
“Cas, when I think of happiness,” Dean smiled, “I think of you.
"Oow… Understood…"
“What’s there to be embarrassed about? You bet you can do whatever you want and I’m not going to be around to spoil it. I got us four separate rooms right in front of the beachside.”
The restaurant was almost empty when they arrived, it was past one o’clock and they sat at the family corner facing the blue ocean with the sound of the large waves filling their ears. The wooden rails smelt of cashmere, the seats, and table all elkwood that had Castiel touching the surface like he understood something they don’t.
“I can.” Cas offered grimly that earned him an amused look from his boyfriend. Dean chuckled and pointed at Cas with hands crossed by his chest.
“Clarence—”
“Believe what you want, it’s my body now, I do what I want with it.” his eyes turn green. Castiel dropped his eyes feeling sick. He hated the way the demon chuckled at his retreat. Images of dead women and men flashed before his mind, all brutally killed by someone inhuman. To think that Dean, someone whose hands protected the same people… it made him sick.
Castiel gasped. Dean sucked him down to the hilt, bulging his mouth and pulling up to watch the spread of sticky cum mixed with his saliva. Nose flaring, Dean swooped down to suck him again, engrossed at the sound of his breath and Castiel’s cries of ecstasy. Castiel couldn’t see straight, he was having a very difficult time even taking a breath that wasn’t laced with a moan but he didn’t want Dean to stop. He didn’t want those lips to stop sucking him, taking everything out of him leaving him panting.
Dean refrains from talking about his freckles, which now he realized, Castiel must’ve had some preference.
Castiel pushed him back the bed with one flick of his wrist. The demon slammed back the bed in surprise as Castiel wriggled out of his trench coat, eyes lingering on Dean. The demon could barely breathe under his gaze.
It was because apart from Crowley being in his room and not giving a damn about him, it was also that he was staring at something on Dean’s bed. Following the demon’s dark eyes, Dean had the shock of his life to see himself lying on the bed, bruised and dead to the world.
Dean froze after Cas gave him that cold stare as a punishment for getting him worried. The Alpha team leader just dropped his head in defeat. He was fucking hard and Cas was a sadist.
“We will.” The man promised. The truck pulled out and was gone in a minute. Castiel watched it go, watched the pigs inside disappear in sight, leaving only him and his conflicted feelings.
"You know," Dean was blushing terribly, but he could still turn a shadier darker and Castiel will still be mesmerized. His dimples were more attractive than before. "I mean I know you don't think much of label but well... You know, like Sam and Eileen… a couple"
Taking it out from the oven and grilling it with cheese added to the color and soon everyone’s stomach was rumbling.  A few minutes more, the whole set up with rice, each plate filling with bacon had everyone nearly crying out.
“You guys, we have to clean the pen as spotlessly as possible. The new piglets are about to be moved here.” Ms. Barnes told the group, “Also, Castiel, I will let you know when the meat is processed and ready for delivery.”
The faculty was already up on the stage with the School Dean. It was not a gym, it was more like an open field where there is a stage and a podium and a roof. He glanced around the familiar faces of the students he met already, including his two roommates, Inias and Milligan, who were aptly listening to the School Dean.
Castiel composed himself this time. He gave the handyman a nasty look who in turn winked at him again. But Dean wasn’t the only one who could play this game.
“Yes, again.”
Everyone was quietly staring at it until Ms. Barnes stood opposite them from the table.
“I’m here to save him.” He insisted.
Castiel grimaced.
Castiel smiled. “Your brother sounds smart.”
Dean thought the angel was the one causing the trouble the way people took a second glance at him as they walk by. Who could blame them? Castiel looked like he’s a fanatic of the gym and work out much more than Sam.
Dean was still in two minds when an incident that afternoon made him finally decide. He was putting on stamps on some international parcel when Meg came in and yelled in his direction. Dean’s eardrum was still hurting.
Castiel nodded then he too leaned down to rest on his own folding pad, leaving Dean nodding and sinking on his own chair again enjoying the warmth of the sun against his skin.
“Hello, Bobby.”
“You’re going out?” Inias asked Adam that night when their roommate grabbed his work jacket and brought his flashlight.
It was like waking up with blinking lights and flash of memories of the night’s event. Dean doesn’t remember most of it but he sat bolt up right feeling a knot in his stomach. He looked wildly around, ready to call his name when he saw Castiel perfectly seated on the side chair looking cool and collected.
“I’m sorry, Cas… there’s something I have to fix first…” Dean hesitated but when he met Castiel’s eyes, it only made Castiel worry more.
“You’re not just a human. You’re my Dean Winchester.”
Leaning on the wall with another inhale and saw the handyman with gratefulness. Dean was under the fluorescent, so yes, he was literally the epitome of hope for Castiel now. He watched Dean use his wireless drill to finish patching up the last corner of the new sheet. The drilling took a while, but Castiel stayed, hypnotize by how familiar Dean’s hands were with his equipment hanging around his waist. He just left the drill on top of the ladder, grabbed his pick with a little twirl over his palm, then went on pressing the head of the screw hard. He returned the pick easily without looking at his belt, it fits down the pocket without a hitch.
“I had to watch it till the end. I wanted to see how good it was with you, Dean.”
Her mother beside her smiled at Jack and whispered encouragement at the toddler being a witness to the supernatural, as Castiel said who apparently also does ‘baby talks’ to Dean’s amusement.
It took Dean a moment to process before he was contacting Gabriel.
“You’ve finally come into?” Dean began, leaning on the doorway as if to block whatever thoughts of escape that would overcome the angel. But Castiel had no intention of running away.
Dean looked up looking upset. Castiel suddenly understood why another guy would call someone ‘cute’. It was a delight to see Dean’s pouty lips, let alone the
Castiel kissed Dean. It was enough answer.
“Dean,” he panted when Dean’s paced turned faster,
Castiel woke up early the next day to attend to his morning duties. Surprisingly, unlike before, he never minded the time. It was one of those adjustments he expected his body to go through after nearly two months in the school. As any day, Ham and the rest of the pigs were excited to see him. A lot of students say Castiel spoils them, but that wasn’t true. It was a level of nurture they haven’t just explored. So, he brushes them regularly so that they’d become so friendly. He watched Ham eat the special feeds as he lounged inside the pig pen while its siblings fought over the tray. Ham had gotten bigger, almost as big as the rest. A month from now…
“I thought we made that clear enough?”
“What do you want to hear from me, then?”
“I think whoever will have Dean will be lucky.”
“Hey, doc. I heard you were removed from your connections in the medical world because of your ‘unorthodox’ methods. What did you do? Opened a guy’s mind without anesthesia?” Dean pressed a grin once Castiel gave him a deadpan look. At least he was getting a reaction from the doctor these days. He wondered if he was getting on the doctor’s good graces.
“I’ll be annoyed if you don’t.” Castiel tapped on the tab and pointed at the folder between them. Dean caught sight of the screen and sat straight looking interested.
To say he melted when Dean’s skin made contact with his when the hunter straddled him was an understatement. He was downright breathless when Dean’s hand slipped between them to grab both their cocks. The first contact had them groaning appreciatively, heads tipping forward to rest against the other’s temple. Castiel followed Dean’s every movement intently. He watched the expression of pure pleasure warped his whole being from his half open mouth that needed air as their cocks grinded. He used to watch that from afar but now, he was involved and he enjoyed every minute of it. He was beautiful that way too.
“Well… maybe we can make one since there’s an available oven?”
“It’s fine, ae you gripping tight?"
“Dean.” The name came out weakly. He too was tired.
"How many doctors do you think I've had? I consider myself an expert by now."
The way Cas was growling made Dean wish they were in the same room. He could just imagine how worried his husband was and was sure to not leave his side starting this day. As much as Dean wanted that, a part of him wanted to push Cas away, but he knew that wouldn’t be smart. If it’s about trust, there’s absolutely no one else he would want beside him at this time except Castiel. He needed Cas and it was a relief to know he’s got somebody to count on. Especially Castiel Novak.
“Adam?” Castiel walked to the tractor with Dean right behind him. “You can drive this thing? I read you can drive even without a license as long as it’s private property, but this is amazing.”
“He’s just a friend… he’s cool.”
“Okay, but only for a few days,” he said cautiously, casting Dean a narrowed look.
How careless of him to be sleeping like this where he is vulnerable. Enemies could be lurking around and he’s down here, sprawled before Castiel, unafraid.
“Nothing I can’t find on google,” Dean was tired. He allowed himself to fall back on the couch and just watch Sam’s mouth move like a clucking hen. He was pulled from his pensive state when Sam’s voice got sharper.
"What does that mean?"
5:00 AM?
“Don’t make a sound.”
“Yes! Thank you for setting it up,” silence followed his words. He glanced just in time to see Dean still just watching him. Like he wanted to say something looking somber like that. Castiel stopped and would've touched Dean's cheek if he was near.
“You’ve got cool hands, Cas,” Dean said next, “I’ll give you compresses from natural ingredients later. My brother, Sam, sent it to me a few days ago just after our break.”
“That’s why you gotta lock the doors, man. You don’t trust a neighborhood just because it’s quiet.”
Dean sat up to observe. Not five minutes later, he found another number of people watching the angel sleep with curious eyes.
The demon stopped trying to grind his ass on Castiel’s knee and locked eyes with him. A curious glimmer appeared in the black space of his eyes that used to be green and so full of life but just as Castiel hoped to see the most missed lush green, the demon grinded its teeth and struggled to be set free.
“Really? Thanks, they’d really love that. I don’t mind eating it here, too,” Dean licked his lips.
one slip of the finger and the pizza came turning in the air straight to Castiel’s waiting hand.
“For two?” asked the rental guy.
Dean dropped his face on his hands. “I’m fine.”
“Will you be selling more tomorrow?”
“You don’t have a ‘doctor’ to it.”
"What did you think about it?"
“Yeah, not the first time I’ve heard about it. The school property is just too vast, thieves can come from any corner since the forest area is open. I heard fugitives used to hide around here in the mountains too.”
“They’re nothing compared to my butler.”
“Yes. I will be leaving town tomorrow to meet my brothers in their villa. I know I made an oath not to see any of them again, but they insisted I attend the gathering or they will come here uninvited. Now, I do not want anything that will put any stress of any kind on to you so leave I must. I will be gone for three days.”
“I didn’t say I’d buy him alive.”
“It’s unique and cute,” Dean watched Cas hang around the ice cream line with Jack talking animatedly beside him. “Cas liked it, right?”
“Angel proofed?” Castiel tilts his head, then nodded in understanding. “Oh… so the angels after me wouldn’t be able to enter?” Of course. He was still a burden.
but the bartend ignored him. He was smiling at Castiel with a knowing look that Dean didn’t like. The angel turned to face him with a challenge in his eyes.
“Yep,” Adam nodded, “I came here for the Agricultural program. Our potatoes are the best. CALS is really impressive with its crop farm so I’m learning a lot.”
“Then this one will not kill you. Close your eyes.”
Dean wanted him, there was no doubt about it.
“Believe me, you’re not. And if you want to make up for this then,” Dr. Novak ran a finger to trace Dean’s jaw and lifted his chin up. Dean’s brain was still processing before he realized soft lips pressed on his own and took his breath away.
“All of you carry something heavy at a young age…”
“Then this is the last time you will sleep this afternoon without my hypnosis.”
Castiel nearly choked on his drink. Dean did choke on the pizza he just shoved it on his mouth. Benny laughed at the two of them and clinked a cup with Castiel.
Then he was pinned on the wall and he lost all thoughts possible and gave in to Castiel’s sexy summon, to which, he’d gladly drown in any time of the day. The way Cas could always carry showed how his husband could manage that 8-pounds bomb suit without breaking a sweat.
“What about work? You said you won’t be here—”
Dean stared him dead in the eyes then lifted a hand to touch his cheek. Castiel stiffened at the palm on his left cheek. It wasn’t like the demon to act so considerate or gentle, and in hindsight he knew it was a trick and yet found himself leaning on the touch instead.
"Psychopaths don’t see it that way," Castiel nodded on the phone, "so it's a rivalry."
—why was the door left open!” came the growl so deep in worry the accountant had no words for it. He stayed still as Dean pulled him closer. It was the first time someone had held him so tight. Someone who’d turn pale at the mere thought of him being hurt. Someone who cared so much whose heart was pounding hard against his chest. Castiel felt his legs turn to jelly. How could he not fall in love with him?
Castiel had never taken in so much information for application in mind. The next few days were more of him focusing on the horses now that Ham is gone. Dean was still looking out for him and his classmates were very considerate too, but slowly Castiel was able to get his focus and found it quite intriguing that students kept asking him about meat.
“What?”
Castiel watched Dean’s bright face of longing.
"You’re idjits.” Dean boomed, but he was eyeing Castiel too who stayed silent but the twitch on his face says it all. He was extremely jealous and Dean was gonna have it later.
“Stop it. Do you flirt with anyone you meet?”
"Yeah, just a little beaten but I can move my legs, see?" to prove his point, he stood up. He really didn't need any assistance but there was Dean holding tight beside him.
“Angel, c’mon, this body can’t be hurt, nothing can, please—”
Castiel felt electric shock ran down his spine. He watched Amara pace the room slowly from the foot of their bed, eyes flickering to him then to Dean.
The breach happened in five minutes. Two attacked from the roof, breaking glass and throwing in flash bang before Dean’s team broke the door. The room had tables turned and hiding behind a steel cabinet with the female hostage on his hand. She was an ugly sight with bloody cut lip and gun pointed at her ribs. Threat level 5 so he decided to give ten seconds to see if it’s worth it. It wasn’t, he was delusional. Dean did not hesitate. Seemed like only one will survive today.
Dean stopped on his tracks. “Well, stop doing it.” The words were out even before he could process what to say. Their footsteps died in the corridor as Dr. Novak turned and gave a long pause while Dean stared at the flowers and swallowed hard.
Castiel's eyes glinted. "Raises the question why he would want to blow her up, right?”
"You—you and my angel-"
“Get more pizza here!” Dean was already putting the spatula with pizza back in the oven. A collective cheer and laughter filled the yard. Castiel delivered pizza to other tables and thanked those who helped him. An ongoing discussion was happening with each group of students inquiring about the crunchy fresh vegetable which Adam said was just expected since asparagus was really good if eaten after getting picked. The cheese question couldn’t be answered and Castiel was sure Mr. Sergei was alert with anyone ratting on him. Drinks were brought in by others who joined in so it was really like a picnic.
“Yes.”

“Not really,” Lee shrugged, “I’m not really deep into those kinds of things, you know. “If anything, I want to do as little as possible,” he grinned. “It’s super cool to find a job that suits you, but I think there’s nothing wrong with making yourself suit the job.”
to do it.” Dean sighed early in the morning as he hung out by the pig pen, hunched over the metal rails as he watched Castiel feed the pigs. They had just returned to the dormitory after the two weeks’ vacation and Castiel was already eager to see Ham.
“You are still here?” Mr. Sergei came around holding the club key, “I was just about to lock up,”
Castiel ran to the threshold and saw Dean throw someone bodily into the kitchen counter, someone tall and lanky with blonde greasy hair but familiar watery blue eyes.  It was someone he recognized, but before he could speak, he saw the tall man's hand landed on the knife in the counter. The way his body moved in its own accord scared him.  Scared in a way he might be too late as he charged towards the culprit who pointed the knife to Dean. Dean's eyes flickered to Castiel and it was the only distraction the other man needed. Castiel heard himself shout. Things were very slow, his body heavy it seemed to take him ages to reach Dean. He saw Dean moved twice as fast to the criminal instead, making Cas numb. The blade seemed to flash before his eyes but with quick hand movements. Dean deflected the weapon off the culprit's hand and grabbed him by the arm before the aggressor could notice Castiel's presence. There's another beat where Dean turned, elbowing the guy's face. Then he hauled him in the air using his shoulder and effectively slammed his face down the floor.
“What’s happening?” he asked, “They’re really noisy today.”
“No, you haven’t. Why do you think I called early in the morning? It’s because the last time we spoke, you were complaining about your insomnia and now that I see you, something’s not right. When was the last time you looked into the mirror? Have you seen your eyes?”
“I would if you occupy my mouth.” His blue eyes glinted meaningfully. Dean smiled at him and put both hands above his head, enjoying the way Castiel’s fingers were circling his stomach.
Sam rolled eyeballs.
“Hey, you forgot your bag,” Dean called to her and was just about to reach for the red bag’s handle when Abaddon turned to him.
“We both looked like we jumped in the ocean. If Sam and Jack saw us, let’s tell them a giant octopus pulled us in the water!” he giggled. Castiel chuckled with him.
“You seemed happy with her attention?”
“You’re beautiful like this, Cas… all for me… bend for me?”
“Then stick around, I’ll show you more,” Dean grinned.
“What kind of brother doesn’t?”
They kissed on the couch until the man was manhandling him again. The kiss lasted for long, Dean’s hands all over his body. The TV was turned off and Dean was shoving his tongue inside Castiel, who loved the way his skin burned under his rough touch. Somewhere a far, the neighbor's cats made such scandalous sounds but it didn't stop Castiel grinding against Dean's hard bulge.
The case with the Rit Zien was anticlimactic. Dean came in time to save him and together they killed one of the most dangerous creatures on earth, at least for Castiel who understood why it was attracted to him. He was just glad it didn’t go after the baby, or Dean for that matter because believed it or not, Castiel could remember Dean’s pain, even if he could no longer see it in this form. That night, Castiel had Dean drive him to the nearest clinic, made sure the baby was okay before returning to Nora’s residence where Dean also had to help with the cleaning of the place.
“From the feeds, there’s only one Cartwright that infiltrated the building. The potential hostage is Angela Abaddon who filed a restraining order on Dick Cartwright, same guy. Last footage in her office about ten minutes ago before the feeds got busted up.”
“Hey, what?”
Castiel grimaced. “No. I’ve been told I consume almost all alcohol in the vicinity to the point of monopoly and um… well, no one wants their drinks be taken by other guys right.”
“What the hell are you talking about now?” Dean pressed his fingers on his eyelids but the cover was comforting so he stayed like that. Sam’s voice sounded far away. “Things are the same for me…”
"I was scared too." Dean sighs, hands casually landing on Castiel's hips, "I was scared what I'd do to that idiot if he harmed you.  I mean what if I wasn't here?"
“Dean,” Castiel felt a puncture in his chest. It was such a fitting name to say, he’d love to keep saying it. “I’m Castiel Novak. Thank you for helping me.”
Dean opened his eyes and looked through his fingers to his brother on the screen. So, he quit his job a year ago and settled himself in an indoor job that required lesser physical extremities. He now sorts incoming parcels and mail, what was bad about that? It was safe and highly advisable by his doctor. It afforded him the medical attention he needed for his condition and have spare for the gym membership apart from his basic necessities. It was all working out fine except when it was time.
he licked his lips meaningfully, “an angel after my ass… that sounds hot, doesn’t it? So what do you say…” Dean shuffles on the bed, leg sliding down the floor with clear intent in his eyes. “Let’s make this fun. You want it, too I know. You want everything from me more than you’d admit cause you’re so righteous. But who believes that crap except you? You know you’re doing everything because of me so why not let it happen? I can feel your longing getting stronger every time even when that ‘profound bond’ you created gone.” the demon showed Castiel his left shoulder cleared off his handprint.
“It’s fine, why are you so obsess with it?” Castiel handed him a can of beer. Dean took it and seemed pensive for a moment until Castiel sat down beside him.
“That’s not it! You were hurt—it’s because of me! I know I must’ve done something worse the other nights! I’d wake up with my knuckles and elbows sore—I know I must be hitting something but I’m not bruised in any way! And then you—” he looked back at the doctor with tears welling up his eyes.
“I’m really sorry about the trouble I caused,” she was saying to Gabriel.
“Dean!”
And he’s being a coward dodging everything when it’s all given to him. He could ask Cas but one mission after another, it seemed like time has already passed them by… that doing it now seemed forced.
“That sounds weird. And who are you calling pretty?” but he was pleased to hear it all the same. They chose the seats next to each other just as the room filled and their homeroom and Language teacher with tight face, Mr. Victor Henriksen, began giving instructions.
“But is it helping? Are you able to sleep?”
“What are you doing all the way out here? Don’t we have an assembly after breakfast?” the guy inquired with greenlight eyes not leaving Castiel. How could someone’s eyes be so green?
“I have my methods.”
Castiel arrived home before dark to see a unique classic black car parked outside his house. Traffic wasn’t that heavy, but he had to buy a pie on the way, knowing he had no time to prepare one for his help. The moment he parked his car behind it, the black car’s door opened. A tall man wearing a thick leather jacket over a white top came out, thick laced boots and washed-out jeans, telling of an aura of manliness Castiel expected from the handyman services. Goosebumps hit him. Okay, so he probably knows his preference, but those beef was distracting. Castiel turned off the car’s headlights, letting the lamp shed light on his companion for the night.
“You’re an angel and I know you have loads in you to give, but fuck, Cas,” Dean exhaled as he kissed Castiel’s forehead, “don’t make me come with just your hand, that’ll be the first for me since hitting puberty.”
Dean gasped, body arching at the angel's touch.
“I’m hoping he would.”
Castiel who slowly but surely made his it through everything with him, still staying with Dean after everything. Though, in this case, maybe he’s not the only reason Cas is here. Cas has another mission and reason to stay and that’s to take care of the now human Jack… but coincidence or not, Dean thought there could still be a chance Cas sees him as something more than a charge whose ass he needs to save every day. He’s more than baggage to Cas if the angel would have him…
“You don’t need to look so upset,” Dr. Novak smiled gently, “I would not be leaving your side if I didn’t see your progress. Dean, I think you’re fit enough to start sleeping without any help. I am glad we established that through my care, you don’t need to resort to any sleeping drugs. I think you also know that. You are almost cured, and to celebrate, I invite you to dinner.”
“Of course. Leave it to me, Dean.”
Well, Castiel have had fantasies but this sure was a surprise.
“Can’t you mojo it away?”
But this Mark coming in his reality with Dean accepting his love? Castiel would choose it, again and again, no matter how many times, no matter how many other realities… because what Sam told them had haunted him and would haunt him for many years.
And they all gobbled down the food, the meat too soft and chewy, the taste of cheese and sauce was too bittersweet, it made Castiel want to cry. This was Ham’s pride too, who’d thought he’d come to this kind of closure? It was so delicious.
“No!” cried everyone and they were speaking all at once that Castiel could no longer see who was who.
Castiel thought about it as Dean scratched the back of his neck looking embarrassed.
One exchange of looks lit a fire in Castiel he never felt as far as their gazes were concerned. Dean was screaming that he stayed and stay he did. The way Dean’s eyes follow him, and vice-versa, the way they wanted to be in the field of vision of the other. Castiel could barely hold on to his resolution. The gnawing feeling of wanting to hold and protect Dean from being hurt, knowing the very thing hurting Dean was him. Then again, it had always been like that from the beginning. Castiel hurt Dean first and regret it in the end. Why was their cycle so?
"How? I manipulated you into doing it with me! How can I calm?"
Dean gave the man one dark look before releasing him. The man stumbled a little, clutched his arm and glared. “What the fuck is your problem—!"
“Whatever gave you the idea I didn’t?” To his surprise, Dean stood up a little straighter, as his bowlegs would allow.
The world stopped when Dean looked up and found himself face to face with the doctor he’d seen only on prints and billboards. Within the chaos mass Doctor Castiel Novak appeared to be his salvation. A light in the darkness, an angel sent to save him from the dark. Will save him from hell. Dean wondered if he has gone completely insane as at that moment, he saw wings flutter behind the doctor.
“I wasn’t about to do that!”
“Talk?” Dean sat down beside him anyway. Their hands linked like magnets. “What about?”
“I am going to honor his request. See, we’ve already been in touch for some time now, I only came here to warn you. I mean, he does love you so much. You deserve to know what I will do. You both will never stop this cycle of sacrifices. I guess that’s my brother’s doing for making humans be this needy creature brainwashed to think no man is an island blah blah blah. I cannot promise you anything, Castiel. I’m only here to see how determined you are.”
“What? You expect me to just blurt it out after seeing you like this?” Dean said frantically, grabbing an armful of Cas and pulling him up, “No, we’re talking about it upstairs, where its warm where we can be comfortable. Not here in this cold place—”
“Are you going to sleep here? Aren’t we watching a movie?”
“Dean, I’m here.”
Dean was breathing heavily. He was on the bed. Castiel was there looking unharmed. There were no men attacking, there were no guns pointed. Dean swallowed hard and felt his head prickle in pain.
“When you told me you wanted to make bacon, I didn’t think you were seriously going to do it until I heard a rumor you bought almost 50 kilos of meat,” Balthazar said while arranging the sharp blades in front of them, “And what more, to hear there’s only the two of you working on it? So, are you guys really dating now?”
That’s when Dean held his hand.
Cas looked at him with accusing eyes like he was cheating again. Dean considered himself a genius when he invited Cas to a dinner date, texting Sam about the location, wherever they are on the night beach.
“Do you think I’m stupid, Dean?”
“Cas,” Dean said breathless and what he saw in the angel’s eyes were left in memory—replaced and shaken by the lips catching his own—of Castiel kissing him chastely, a small peck before pulling away to stare Dean in the eyes. Seemingly asking for more.
“Special luxurious dinner?”
“Do it.”
“Cas!” it was a surprised squeak which was something Castiel had never heard of before. He felt Dean tensing up in his arms, but he still refused to let him go. What was Dean doing anyway?
Castiel paused a moment, then licked his pink lips—said lips finally landed hot and searing against Dean’s own, not making any attempt at prelude when slick tongue slipped past his teeth. A surprised moan escaped Dean’s mouth. The doctor was no amateur—he sucked all the air in Dean’s mouth like a hungry carnivore. He was really, really a good kisser and Dean was weak against it. He tasted bitter wine and imagined the doctor drinking something the network gave him. His mind buzzed as if reminding him of something important but Dean was preoccupied. The doctor was sucking his bottom lips like a handsome leech.
“Of course not. Not if it’s a half-hearted offer. It’s a different story if he only wants me to own him, I did for a while. Geez, tiger, stop giving me clawing looks, I get it. It’s just too bad we didn’t share that too profound bond.”
“You’re supposed to say ‘thank you’! But damn, I’m… eating you from here on! You’re so big! I feel so full but pull out a little and—dammit I want to see your face!”
“Oh, shit
“It’s really painful around the hips too,” Castiel was telling Dean as they hooked the bridles by the wall, “I don’t like to put any painkillers.”
Castiel tried to hide his bleeding hand out of sight but whether it’s because he was now human, or that Dean was just naturally trained to be fast, Dean snatched his wrist and hissed at the long bleeding gash on Castiel’s palm.
Another two hours and they reached their destination. The Winchester ranch was a huge farm with at least two barn houses on different corners. A large stable for a dozen horses with an enormous round pen beside it. Castiel was in awe of Dean’s house too. It was a two-story level with an expanded first floor and veranda used for firewood chopping. It looked like a vacation house with an assortment of farm life.
Castiel let out a whimper as Dean sucked on his throat, leaving marks on places Castiel knew to be so obvious. But they were in a secluded part of the country where no prying eyes could see. The privileges of living far away from what people considered the norm. In here there were the two of them. Here they all have the privacy of the world. Castiel was pulled back from his musings at the graze of teeth on his hardened bud. Dean had taken it up himself to take Castiel’s nipple in his mouth, causing Castiel’s body to go through waves of reaction. He moaned and cried as Dean sucked, his lips leaving hot trails in its wake. He kissed between Castel’s chest, sliding his tongue down Castiel’s middle. Kissing his stomach devotedly, before wrapping a strong firm hand around Castiel’s already rock-hard cock. The feeling of his palm had Castiel’s mind swirling. Much more when Dean started jacking him. Castiel bit his lips so he wouldn’t have to let out an embarrassing moan.
“That’s right. You tell em it’s me.”
Castiel dried his tears with his grace and looked up. Dean’s concerned face hovered over him. How could he look so gentle like that? When he was the one hurt and abandoned that time?
“Here.” Gadreel handed him the tapped mobile phone. He heard it ring once, twice—then a pickup.
“Dean, you know it’s bound to happen soon…we have to live our own lives… and that may happen outside the Bunker.”
Castiel stared at him.
It was a slap on the angel. Dean’s eyes gleams. “Mark me again, angel.”
Castiel stayed silent for a moment.
“I’m not.” Garth said in a matter-of-fact tone.
Dean shrugged, “My brother will kill me if he learned I used these baby muscles to bully the weak. He’s a trainer by the way, body lifters and all he can easily tackle me if I’d done something like that. He didn’t raise me to be a brute, that is what he’ll say.”
“Yes, he is showing off. Can you excuse me for a while?” Castiel walked up behind Dean and heard him reciting the exact things he said while he was teaching it to him.
"How much I like you." Dean pressed their bodies. Castiel had no complaints. He wanted closer. Wanted Dean like this.
He went on his way, almost running, but once he’s composed himself and far away from the temptation that was his Cas, Dean saw people because he’s going to have fun. Too bad it wasn’t with Cas.
“Yeah, it was bad year.”
Dean ignored whatever barrier they had and like the way a Winchester does it, smashed the walls to pieces and pulled him into a bone-breaking hug. And just as the angel thought the Universe was against him, right there and then he was freed from his shackles and the brightness missing in the vast darkness shone upon him again. All he needed was Dean.
“We need to clean your cut—” he glared at Castiel who squinted back at him.
“Dean, what are you not telling me?”
“Hold on a second,” Castiel asked the staff to freeze the screen. “Dean, look at this.”
the back of his head screamed. “I’ll kill you for even thinking I’d let you—”
Bells rang in Dean’s ears.
Dean ignored the silence as he tiptoed to his room. He didn’t dare look back at Castiel, never dared to think about it or let the angel see a glimpse of what he wanted the most the moment he was in his room. His skin burned. his heart raced at the possibility.
"Now, Cas, don't lose your cool… I’m taken, remember?”
Dean glanced at him with an unreadable expression. “What’s that?”
“What’s your level in Math?”
And with that, they both hung up. Dean turned around to find the doctor eyeing him quietly. He sat at the couch, as far away from where the doctor was seated. It made him a little apprehensive to be alone with the doctor. Placing both hands on either his knees, Dean tried to act less nervous. Instead, he glanced at Dr. Novak and finally noticed a pen a clipboard on his hand.
"You cannot fight me, Dean. Even now your attacks are half-hearted. You can feel it, I know. The spell would not be effective if you were not... if you didn't have feelings for me in the first place..." Castiel remembered the night he called Sam, how Sam was relieved to hear Dean was showing human emotions, even if it was centered on lust. It was the beginning of the first final contact with Dean's emotions.
“Well, nothing’s really changed, huh?” Gadreel was saying as Castiel and Dean caught up with them, “It’s still the same old lovey-dovey couple working for animals.”
A shot came suddenly and Castiel felt his heart skipped a beat. Dean blasted a gun away from Roman’s hand. He screamed in pain, clutching his hands in agony. Castiel could see Abaddon was now free to run, but she was just frozen on the spot.
Dean moaned on his cock. Castiel felt his knees buckle at the pleasure of getting drained from his body. It was not his first time—but it was with someone he cared about, someone he wanted to protect and this was part of it. Of protecting Dean from the demon’s malicious thoughts of their relationship breaking apart because of this. Castiel will take responsibility this time. He will not run away.
“The one making your day? You’ve been vibrant the entire week.” Pearl piped up.
Castiel sat beside him contemplatively. He could see the growing concern in the man's eyes as the silence went on but Dean waited. Castiel wanted to, he really did, and they've been doing a lot of romantic stuff except he was nervous of blowing this out. But when he saw that hope in Dean's eyes, the kind of hang for his dear words like his life depended on it, he knew his answer. It was kind of stupid not to realize it already. Touching Dean's lips, he drew him closer in response.
"No." he eyed Dean softly.
“Dean, would it be agreeable for you to join me in a luxurious dinner tonight?”
In which Castiel got involved...
that fluid motion of a thread moving inside him, stirring once more as it did when Dean prayed to him in Purgatory.
Castiel was relieved but at the same time, he knew his time to say goodbye had come. Dean stared at them both, collecting his wits, and then full fixed his eyes on Castiel with the grimmest look on his face. It hurt Castiel but he looked Dean in the eyes, locked with them. If he was going to admit to the crime, he better face it. Dean deserved better.
“You're warm, I can lay here all day."
“You just don’t trust me easily—”
“What? Why? I thought I’m using Sam’s room?”
“Those aren’t just any lip. Those are mine.”
“Yes, sir, we’re just leaving.” Castiel said without looking in Dean’s direction. It was the first time he had argued with Dean, and safe to say he couldn’t see where he was wrong. So, maybe it was after club hours, Castiel didn’t know no extension was a rule. But still, it made him regret clashing with Dean like that. It also made him realize he and Dean barely know each other at all. Dean quietly walked beside him with a serious look on his face. Castiel could feel he was no longer angry. He also knew they shouldn’t leave things like this. They walked back to the dorm in silence and bid awkward goodbyes.
“Oh. I’m saved. I was starving. I’ll get dinner while you take a shower.”
Dean cried and Castiel cradled him. He sat up with his back pressed on the headboard of the bed, half of Dean’s body wrapped on his lap. Castiel has his arms wound up around Dean’s shoulder, one hand brushing his hair.
“We could arrange for another set of eyes. She’s already under surveillance from the beginning.” Gabriel pressed his knuckles on his lips looking thoughtful. Dean noticed the lawyer and Abaddon exchange another meaningful look before turning to the officers.
“You’re not going to run outside again the moment I go back in the house, are you?” Dean said in a gruff tone as he stood by the door frame of the stable with his hands on his hips. Castiel stared at him and nearly chuckled if Dean didn’t look so serious.
“Leave, trust me.” He received a glare in turn.
"You can't make me change my mind."
“Yeah, what gave that out?”
“You don’t mean…” Anna whispered.
Castiel thought of how Sam was beaten badly, how he too was beaten by Dean. He slowly nodded.
"You going to do this first, right? Jump high and win the horse? You can do it first, and if you did succeed, I will tell you."
"Dean…" Castiel began to worry, this was a dream. He made sure to feel Dean's body against him, cupping both his cheeks. The man didn't disappear any second at how happy he felt.
Castiel looked down at Ham who had just gotten evicted from the tray of feed that made Castiel sigh.
“Have you tried asking Adam about it?” Dean said, making Castiel turn to him.
"Let me hear you," Dean breathed on his lips, both hands cupping Castiel's cheeks with their foreheads pressed.  Castiel surged forward to take Dean's lips, returning the favor while his palms took possession of Dean's hardened nipples.  He easily realized Dean's weak spot. He watched Dean pause to inhale, his bright green eyes intense on Castiel, seeking and begging him for something.  Even then he was more beautiful. Castiel wondered how he got himself so lucky. He kissed Dean one more time, biting and tugging on his lips before he pulled back, aware of their lively grinding bulges twitching on the prospect of what's to come next.
The mother casts a look up at Cas and Dean standing by the doorway, giving them a long stare enough for Dean to wink in response.
“I had to pick the best and crunchiest, sorry about that,” saying so, Adam picked up and threw a freshly picked tomato on his way, “This will guarantee the pizza’s going to be spectacular.”
“Dean?” Castiel glanced up, remembering Dean’s reaction at the affair. Gavin collected his books and stood up.
“Cas,” Dean said, voice deep that made the hair at the back of his neck stand up, “We haven’t even begun anything yet.”
“Dammit. Can’t really catch a break.” He whispered in conspiration to the angel, “Can you believe we just had a combat with god last month?”
“Okay.” grinned the demon.
Dean groaned.
Seated inside the warmth of the room was the tax accountant of the neighborhood. With legs curled on the sofa under the lamplight, holding his iPad with one hand, while he rubbed the tip of his pen on his lips with the other, Castiel worked on the intricacies of tax audits and returns. He was used to working late at night as his brain functions more after a cool shower. He was left-handed, his coffee table was on the left so he heavily leaned on his right with legs crossed in the comfort of his jogging pants. He navigated the gadget adeptly, reading glasses reflecting its screen light while the clocked chimed half-past ten. It’s almost time for him to call it a night.
“Yeah, talk dirty to me, Cas. Hurry up.” Dean’s groan came out, gutted and he felt Cas stopped moving for a moment. Dean cursed and fucked into his hand, he couldn’t help it—but Castiel firmly put a palm on his leg. Swearing, Dean reached for the headboard of the bed for purchase, wriggling his ass so Cas gets the message. He watched painfully as Castiel began to shed his clothes, throwing them on the floor before crawling back to Dean and trailing kisses on his stomach, his pectoral, sucking on his bud for a while until it’s hard as a rock, and then paying equal attention to the other Dean had to suck his breath.
Castiel's mouth clamped. Amara was smirking at him again.
The next Monday’s lesson was at the school’s large pig pen. Their instructor, Ms. Pamela Barnes, a beautiful brunette who wore her hair in a tight ponytail was a sight to look at. She wore a tight black shirt that accentuated her curves matched with an army pants. Her army necklace hung on her neck but it wasn’t this that intimidated most of the first years. It was the gleam behind her dark eyes. Why not? She butcher pigs for a living.
“You watch
Castiel scowled at the officer who grinned and gave him procedures for the next day. When everything was secured, Castiel finally closed the door and listened until the sound of siren finally disappeared into the horizon. He calmed himself and turned around. He found Dean sitting at the bottom of the stairs leading to the second floor. Quietly, Castiel walked to him with his shoulders sagging.
“Dean, you don’t have to make time for me,” Castiel began a little taken by the gesture but Dean glanced back at him quietly. Castiel hesitated at the silence. Dean just looked at him, studying his face to the point Cas became self-conscious but before he could say anything else, Dean shook his head.
“What difference does it make?” between them, the man cursed and tried to pull his bent arm but Dean was too powerful. Heads turned this way, the bartender could careless as he kept wiping his precious glasses. Others simply ignored them, trying to be oblivious to the helpless yelps.
“The guy knew we were following the clues, Dean,” Castiel said gravely. “It was a trap.”
“I suppose your brother told you that? There is some truth to it, I do not like it when people bother me—”
“Propane.” The bomb expert said, wrinkling his nose.
“Hey, Dean!” Gabriel’s voice boomed on the other end of the radio, “Cas’ gotten rid of the headquarter’s bomb. Focus on what’s on your plate.”
“Just in time for my pie.”
“What about you?” Sam threw at him. “What will you do before dinner?”
The sight of the sparkling bluish green ocean with pebbles of sunray dancing on its surface greeted them as they strolled the afternoon heat, Dean pulling on his dark shades which Jack and Castiel quickly imitated, while Sam already wearing his own.
Dean moaned in dismay when Castiel grabbed his legs to still him. “What? We’re going half way? You said you’d fuck me!”
“Sir, when you say ‘campus’… you mean…?”
There was a sharp sound of metal scratching on metal. Castiel stayed still, elbows digging deep on the couch. Dean slipped out of him with a number of swear words that could make some people turn their heads.
“I don’t want that for you.” Castiel gritted his teeth.
Emerald eyes twinkled. “That’s an idea.”
“None.” Castiel ended with a smirk. “If anyone’s shown any interest to attack me…” he didn’t finish. Dean suddenly found his hammer appealing.
Castiel took Dean’s jaw to make the frenzied demon stare him in the eyes. He stared at him searchingly, searching the pieces of Dean scattered in that endless pit seemingly wanting to disappear. But he won’t let that. As long as there are pieces of Dean that were reaching out to him, he will piece him back together.
“But it’s just a kiss. We did so much more in the barn. You can say that because you’re so patient.” Dean pouted, face too close to him that Castiel blushed.
“Yeah. It’s almost harvest time and we don’t want any thieves getting ahead of themselves and stealing from us to their heart’s content. We already asked permission from the teachers. Mr. Henricksen will even patrol with us. He said the school had planned to get hounds but they just scare some of the farm animals. Anyway, we’ll be done with the harvest before summer break so you guys watch out, okay?”
“Point is, Cartwright’s motivation for stalking her is clear. But targeting me, it seems farfetched. What’s the point of it when he hates his own brother? It’s all crazy logic.”
Castiel huffed and only managed to respond by kissing his lover. This time there was no denying it, he and Dean were meant together.
He barely closed the door when he felt something move behind him. Snapping around, he saw a black figure sitting on a chair a step before him. Dean’s first instinct had him taking out his demon blade. His mind whirled of how any beings entered his room when it was the most warded off room in the world—unless this was an angel—but he only allows Cas as the exception—
“I’m just happy.”
“Why here?” he asked with head leaning back.
Dean swallowed his moans. It didn't take long for the built-up tension to explode and Castiel embraced the handyman tight. Dean fucked him through it and when they finally had the chance to stare at each other's flushed face, Dean bowed to plant another long kiss. Castiel felt his body go rigid, apologizing soon for scratching Dean's back.
“I’m going to make dinner; do you want anything to be done with pork meat?”
“Cas, you’re killing me,” the hunter breathed, “keep that face away from me for a bit.”
“I want ice cream,” Jack said suddenly
An egg slipped from Castiel’s hand. He caught it after one heart stopping moment of shock and made sure to drop it down the tray carefully. He saw Gavin smirking at him because they all know the rule— a crack egg is equivalent to a day’s added duty. He still wasn’t sure if that was serious or not. But if anything, people in CALS take their job very seriously.
“I swing where I want before I bite the dust, who’s going to judge?” Winked the bartender, “Once you’re on your own, alone, it’s harder to lie to yourself.”
“Alright. Dean.” Castiel took his time just to choose his answer, “I’m not sure if I’m really here for a reason. All I want is to start anew. You can say I’m running away, but for the time being that’s all I can do. Whether it bears fruit for the better or worse, I’m ready to face the result. I just want to be free.”
“I told you, we can’t. We’re in school premises, I hate for you to get suspended just over something we can control.”
Abaddon looked crestfallen for a second, but it didn’t look like she was fazed. The arrangement for a different bodyguard was made but with Dean assuring her that he would be one call away from her and with his Alpha team always on his ear, he promised to protect her at all cost.
Yet, the drive back to the impala reminded him how ripples don’t just disappear and smoothen themselves without a full impact. Soon he felt the growing distance between Sam and Eileen at the back of the impala when the two were inseparable previously. He wanted to speak, sensing the silent tension he’d usually share with Dean, but here he was sitting shotgun beside Dean to give the couple space, yet all that was there was silence. Dean wouldn’t even crack a joke to lift up the mood as he would after a bad hunt. That got Castiel more concerned than anything. He pressed his lips and tried to act nonchalant like the hunter beside him. Dean was acting cool but the angel could sense the older Winchester’s growing anxiety. They were both watching the two from the rearview mirror and when Castiel couldn’t stand it any longer, he half glanced at the back seat, Dean’s hand clamped on his knee. Catching Dean’s eyes, the angel nodded. Dean was about to finally take control.
Castiel held his legs. Dean was with him. He was beautiful.
Dean stopped to stare. Is Cas… is Cas losing his grace? Is Cas becoming a human? Cas never talked about it but after Heaven finally shut close to leaving this world alone, Castiel seemed the same. Happier, but the same.
“Ah, just get the table ready. The meat is almost done. I hope you don’t mind eating venison?”
“Dean.” Castiel swallowed, wordless.
“Very.”
The way Dean kept gazing at him made his heartbeat skip many times, the way their hands brushed when they parted ways last night. Not once had Castiel thought of Dean’s lips and how it felt pressed against his own. Dean grinning every time they paused for a long while just staring at each other with beers between them. He wondered if he smiled like an idiot too. He’s never felt that kind of attraction to any man before, not this strong. He had no trouble hitting on men, that Castiel was sure, but he wasn’t sure about Dean until that wink.
“I have a proposal to make—”
“What? No—no,” Dean said marshaling his will to look Castiel in the eyes, “No, Cas, I’d rather have you, you know that.”
Castiel bristled and the lamps around exploded. Dean laughed.
“I’m sorry you guys are all hungry,” he said, “Your lives are too short…” he brushed Ham’s other cheek but another pig bit on his pants for attention, “Alright, alright, I’ll brush you too.”
Dean’s heart races. Castiel’s lips were too close, one step and he could have them. The restraint he had not too was painful. Time seemed to stop, even the setting of the sun seemed to halt when they gazed into each other’s eyes, and Castiel stepping close, bright blue eyes unblinking, determined, with a goal.
“Alright then! Allow me to explain.” He tapped a hand on the board, “Protein does not have any flavor by itself, but when it’s broken down by enzymes, the amount of amino acids and peptides in the meat increases. They’re what you call ‘flavor compounds’. Meat and fish both contain protease which breaks down the proteins into smaller amino acids. And that’s how meat aging works. The processed meat is kept at two to four degrees Celsius. For pork, it takes three to five days, which is considered optimal. Research reports from recent studies say that if you add mold to venison and then age it, it increases the amount of amino acids by nearly five times. So, this on the board is the structural formula of an amino acid!” the teacher was so excited. Lesser could be said for the rest of the class.
Doctor Castiel glanced up, startled for a moment.
Dean was already racing to the back door of the Forensic building where he was met with the Alpha team for orders. He was looking through Aaron’s screen when he received the report from Gadreel.
“I just finished shower and…” Castiel stepped in the kitchen, “What are we having? Do you want me to help?”
And so, the chase began.
Castiel understood their unease. To sink in the whirlpool of uncertainty and get caught in the idea of disillusionment, of whether what they felt for each other was real or not was a nasty situation he never wanted to go through. He and Dean had been through that too. Questioning whether they were ‘real’. Castel knew the feeling. If it was the old him, he would have carried without care and would be more worried of the constant looming doom of the earth than silly couples with their fallout? But humans do not deal with broader subjects, not when trouble was so close to home.
“It’s like asking a cat to shed furballs,” Dean muttered.
The chase when on for a while, Dean almost bumping at the corners of the tanks until he spied a man running across him. Gritting his teeth, he changed directions and was after the guy too. The guy was some ten feet now and when he stopped, Dean quickly drew his gun.
With squinted eyes, Castiel looked at Dean patiently and with growing curiosity. The sandwich, as usual, was more than he could chew. Melted cheese dripped on the corner of the bread, pieces of crunchy bacon fell down the steel table, yet Dean showed no sign of stopping. He gobbled everything in microseconds and if he wasn’t careful, he might just end up—
“You’re lucky the teachers didn’t punish you this time for spreading rumors about those two,” Inias pointed out.
“I’m serious, Cas. I want to do it here, now. With you,” Dean stared at Castiel’s chest with a hungry gleam in his eyes. Without asking, the hunter’s hands traced the dip of muscles of Castiel’s pectorals, rising up to the bump of his nipples. Castiel had never felt so exposed. He closed his eyes when Dean’s thumbs found his nipples, rubbing intently with both thumbs and watching the angel’s reaction. Castiel gasped softly with his hips twitching in need. This seemed to turn Dean more but it was Castiel who pulled him into a kiss with tongues swirling, breathing into each other’s mouth, Dean’s finger unrelenting on his now hard buds.
hanging on a tree. So, bears were common in this area…
“Yeah, too late so don’t blame me for looking back. I thought about it hard, Cas and you have no idea how
“The feedbox looks squeaky clean. They haven’t been fed yet, huh?” Gadreel pointed out. Castiel blinked, his thoughts already at the idea of grabbing the nearest feed when Dean stepped behind him and placed a hand on his lower back.
He ran his hands along Cas’ shoulders, restraining him, but Castiel only want to chase his lips because fuck—it’s nothing like any kiss he had before. Pushing Castiel down, Dean eagerly lapped on his neck, sending ripples in his stomach to see Castiel arch his body to find friction. And friction Dean gave.
“Gee, you look exhausted. Those new co-workers of yours giving you a hard time, babe? Want me to give em a piece of my mind?”
“What do you mean?”
Castiel glanced up to Mr. Tilghman.
“Cas, it’s better not to name him like a pet,” Dean squatted beside Castiel with their elbows touching. He glanced at Dean and saw him just watching him with meaning behind his green eyes. He looked concerned that Castiel blushed.
Except—
“Well? What is it?”
Castiel’s chair shook and the computer table nearly tipped over. Dean was almost on his face as he was pressed behind by a bunch of their classmates.
“Come on, turn around. I wanna see your beautiful face.”
“Could feel? Cas, you’re making it seem like the Bunker is sentient.”
Adrenaline rushing in his ears when he got off the cab, Dean stood outside the giant network station where Novak had his live interview just now. There was a dozen of reporters there with their camera ready. Dean hurried along with everyone else. His feet were killing him from all the running. It drained Dean’s energy and had some dizzy spells but he persevered. His heart was hammering in his chest. He was hanging on some invisible line because today he will finally catch up with Dr. Novak. He will finally see the light. Agitatedly, he waited with the media outside the building for half an hour.
“What are you going to do?” he hissed in concern.
“It’s just a spray. I’m allergic to cats. I wear them.”
“What do you mean you made it ‘work’?”
Castiel blinked and looked around his classmates who were all staring at the guy with knowing looks. Was the guy hitting on him? He believes this would be a good time to tell them he already has a boyfriend.
“So, when are you going to get it back?”
Before anything else, Cas put the tablet down and stared Dean in the eyes.
“That doesn’t sound good,” Dean muttered with a glare Castiel hadn’t seen before.
“It’s true,” Dean said with a taunting smile, “That’s how fast we take out the pests in this neighborhood.”
“It’s a fact.” Dean seemed to want to cement this in the angel’s brain, “I mean, man, after everything I’ve been through, happiness is one thing I never had hopes for. I just want everyone to be safe and just be happy and I’m content. So maybe that’s my wishful thinking, but after mom? Chuck? I know that ain’t ever for me so… guess we both don’t need to worry about you getting taken by the Empty now, right?”
Water run down their faces but Castiel only pressed his head on Dean's nape with a sigh.
Castiel took his time getting the stuff from the passenger’s seat, including a box of pie. He stepped out to meet Dean, who was watching him behind his safety glasses. He was wearing a dusk mask covering half his face, on his jeans hung his tool equipment, including the gloves. Castiel nodded in approval as he put on his own face mask.
“Castiel! Help me study to save my life!”
“Dean.” It was both Amara and Castiel this time. Dean squirmed from his embrace and in turn wrap his arms around Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel had never shown any weakness but Dean was giving him the strength he would usually use to make a big decision when saving Dean. But that wasn’t right. He would usually be hurting and use that pain to decided but being here with Dean, he thought he couldn’t make a better decision than hold on.
Tears fell on the floor. Both he and Dean were crying.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll see you guys later!”
Castiel really didn’t mind snaking his long arms around Dean’s sturdy middle. He flattened himself on Dean’s broad back and apologized for being too close. Dean didn’t seem to mind, in fact, he suggested even tighter. Castiel didn’t regret pulling up closer because Baby ran like a bullet.
Dean muffled his voice on Castiel’s throat, biting on the angel’s collar bone and leaving a mark there. “You’re not allowed to leave this Bunker without doing me.”
"Shh... come.  I got you, babe, I got you."
“Hey, hey, easy, it’s not like—” Dean’s lips curved into a smirk while Castiel threw him a dirty look. He took one peer at the eyepiece, then glanced up at Dean squished between his shoulder and the wall of the small room.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to surprise you. It’s not that I’m thinking of marriage effectively—but you’re the one who brought up my parents so…I mean, do you think we could flirt forever without getting married one day?”
And they didn't wait that long. The moment they heard Dean moan inside, he and Sam went in. They watched Dean open his eyes, swirling green and black, staring at them blankly and then it turned pure green. Castiel sighed in relief. Sam threw holy water on Dean's face and nothing.
“Shut up! I was so excited it wrecked my nerves alright! Now go so you can come back early.”
“Don’t move.” He ordered. Dean sucked his breath as Castiel shed his coat and the rest of his shirt. It was uncomfortable to see the swirl of hungry dark eyes upon him, but he decided to see only Dean. When he wriggled his pants down, he tried not to glare at how Dean moaned seeing his nakedness. It made the demon’s cock twitch in excitement.
Dean’s voice broke, “Cas, I can’t do this… don’t leave me…I need you, please.”
“Well, if you want, I could bring extra off-putting scent around for cats more.”
Castiel freed his cock, it was already hard and pulsating. Castiel gave the tip of his cock a rub to spread the glistening precum before running full-on Dean’s rod. Dean shut his eyes as Castiel began stroking him like it was a ritual and coaxed sounds from his lips that Castiel loved to hear. Castiel was most affected by Dean’s sound. Dean felt his husband stiffen, blue eyes watching Dean’s face and then Dean’s cock like he could never have enough. Soon, he wrapped large, pristine hands around their cock and squeezed them together.
