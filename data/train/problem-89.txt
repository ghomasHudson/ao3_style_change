“Oh stop.”
“Look at me, Mycroft. Deduce me.”
Dunworthy smiled again. “If not, put an ad in the Telegraph about your dog Hamish, that you want him home, and we’ll open the net again the night the ad appears. But I think you’ll find that he’ll still be there.”
Running each bag through the testing process took time and patience, and Sherlock was working through them as quickly as he could, but not as quickly as they piled up.
Maja nodded, her eyes losing some of their desperate gleam. “I know good way. I used to – what is word?
, you crazy man, you’re insane,” John said, laughing and shaking his head. He ran to Sherlock and pulled him into his arms and back towards the bed. “We could have –
“Got it.”
,’ he had said. So John gritted his teeth together to keep the words in. Focused on the shape of Sherlock’s strong legs.
He handed Holmes the paper; Holmes read it swiftly and wordlessly passed it to John:
He asks me how I’ve been, how the café is going. Apologizes again about the movie. Tells me a bit about his daughter. Then he mentions that he and Sherlock had had a case earlier that week. So I ask him about it, and he talks about it for a solid fifteen minutes.
One more chapter to go! I can't leave Fleabag without her own happy ending.
“Thank you,” Holmes said, with his nose still in the paper. John handed Holmes his tea, and Holmes folded the paper and gave it to John, his long finger pointing to a specific ad in the classifieds.
“Clearly. Were you expecting Pavlović to come back?”
“Hurry, Sherlock.”
Stamford was grinning helplessly at John. “He’s an eccentric, for certain, Dr. Watson, but not mad; despite all appearances.”
SHERLOCK: [With a slight note of panic] That was
“Just wondering if I needed to deputize him.”
Sherlock didn’t come out of his room for hours, even after the judges had gone home. After cleaning up, John stood in the kitchen and looked at the two loaves for a while. He cut a bit from his own loaf, took a bite, frowned, and threw the whole thing in the bin. He made a jam sandwich from Sherlock’s loaf, and found it very nice indeed.
“Move, slowly.”
“Good night, John.”
“I know, love. Get your gear off and go to sleep.”
Heavy steps came slowly up the stairs, and the cabbie came to the doorway. He was a big man, heavily built around the shoulders and over six feet – well above the average height for a contemp. “You called for me, sir?” he said, his voice deep and slightly surly despite the polite words.
He surprises me by pulling me in and giving me a great, big, god-almighty-he’s-good-at-this kiss.
Sherlock frowned at him. The man must be irredeemably stupid. “I won’t get shot the moment I step outside?”
He dug through his Mind Palace and found some Shakespeare and Keats, and would recite those to her for a change. She clearly didn’t understand what they were about, and asked him over and over what a ‘fardel’ was, or what a nightingale looked like. She never asked him to repeat those poems, and he wasn’t sure if this was a relief or a disappointment.
“Sherlock,” John said, quietly, as if raising his voice would break a spell. “If you-”
“Do you think me to be a fool?” she said.
Sherlock tried to disguise his confusion and concern rising in his face, but doubted he had fooled Mycroft. “Not for a while.”
“And you’re here.”
[They are in fact about four feet apart.]
“Giving us a chance,” Sherlock said.
John closed the door to his bedroom and leaned against it. Why in heaven’s name had that turned him on so much? He must be some kind of pervert, to find Holmes so attractive in that morgue. Had the Victorian era made him into a deviant?
John didn’t respond, he just glared.
“You have an appointment this morning,” the driver said. “Let’s go.”
John just nodded. “Enough about me,” he said shortly. “You’re the star around here. Tell me about yourself.”
Sherlock looked down at Rosie. She was staring up at the ceiling, her eyes round.
“Thank you.” Sherlock quirked his head. “Do you require alcohol for this exercise?”
An idea borne out of desperation leapt into his mind. He reached into his pocket and found his phone. He switched it on, noting that the battery was at 81% power. He flipped through the gallery until he found a picture of John.
“To be frank, yes,” Holmes replied. “I find cocaine to be tremendously stimulating and clarifying to the mind. It can be invaluable to my thought process.”
“Will you need any help?” Lestrade asked.
“Nonsense. Surely you’ve seen stranger things in the Black.”
Reynolds sniffed, clearly not completely mollified, but resigned. “Fine.” He turned to the large tank of fish, serenely swimming around the coral. “The aquarium recently invested in four peppermint angelfish, or C. boylei, from the Cook Islands in the eastern-central Pacific. These fish are terribly rare, as they are only found in depths of 53 to 120 metres. There were two males and two females, as we were planning to breed them here. One of the males went missing last week. We didn’t notice for a day because they’re very shy fish, we thought he was hiding in the coral. Then yesterday we realized that one of the females was missing as well. I believe someone is stealing them to begin their own breeding program.”
As he struggled to open his eyes, his memory rushed back with images of the plane, and that they had made an emergency landing in Serbia. And that could mean a lot of trouble for Sherlock, depending on where exactly he was. If only he could open his eyes he could figure it out.
“You sure?”
He suddenly looks twelve years old, like he just got called out by his mum. He speaks quietly, all his confidence out the window. “I wanted to make sure – that you’re all right. That you’re good for John. He’s been hurt before and I – I owe him and – I don’t want him to get hurt.”
“Freeze, Carmichael!” Lestrade shouted. “You are arrested, for treason against Her Majesty.”
They returned home hours later, elated and exhausted. John had a perfunctory shower to get the smell of the alley off him, but was in bed and asleep before Sherlock had finished his turn in the loo.
“The war?” I say. He’s told me he was in Afghanistan, though he doesn’t seem to want to talk about it a lot.
"There you are, John - oh. Mrs. Hudson. Watson." Sherlock paused in Mrs. Hudson's doorway, frowning. "What are you doing?"
of living moment to moment, came back to me.  I’m awake now, for the first time in years.”
“Hailing StarJumper class cargo ship Baker,” said a voice from a speaker.
“What I want from you, you can’t buy.”
“You are,” John conceded. “But there are many variables over which you have no control. Foreign ingredients, for example.”
“There are no cameras now,” he hissed. “No microphones. No guards, no one watching every move we make, watching for a mistake. We are
As the evening went on, despite his best efforts to stay in the present, Sherlock found that his thoughts strayed over and over again to the case. He felt he was so close, as if a single word would trigger the solution in his brain. Then the Commissioner would ask him a question, or they would be greeted by another high profile party attendee, and he would have to force himself to focus. At one point he realized that he hadn’t told John about his theory of the cases being connected, and briefly considered suggesting to John that they work on it together after the Ball. Then he looked over at the Commissioner, and remembered what his priority this evening should be, and who he would be going home with. He shook himself minutely. Focus, he thought, and ate another strawberry in a way that was guaranteed to get the Commissioner’s attention.
John studied Anderson up and down, his face remorseless and cold. “Is he now,” he said, and the pitiless tone of his voice made Anderson blanch and step back.
“Do you require assistance up the stairs, Watson?”
The man gave one more decisive blow to the corpse, and turned to them. His face was thin, with his cheekbones thrown into relief in the shadows of the room. Despite the vigour of his action, his face remained pale and bloodless, with only a faint blush high up on his cheeks betraying his exertion. “Ah, Stamford,” he said. “I was told that this poor fellow had no family to claim him, and required his services to help me with an experiment which may save another man from the noose. I didn’t realize you’d be bringing around a guest.”
Many thanks to @missdaviswrites for her great help with beta-ing this fic, and to @PeaGeeTibbs for commissioning it for Fandom Trumps Hate.
“Please,” John said.
“What are you doing?” Maja said.
They entered the theatre. The actors, still in costume, were in small knots across the stage, stunned looks on their faces. Juliet was still weeping noisily. Anderson was handcuffing a woman all in black clothes.
Ŝta se događa? - What’s happening?
“He’s got no reason to lie, I suppose,” John said.
John grinned. “Ready when you are.”
Holmes, of course, was already up, reading the newspaper in his dressing gown, and John felt himself smile fondly and feel a bit better at this now-familiar sight.
The stage went dark and backstage was lit only by dim blue light. Everyone went quiet.
Mrs. Hudson was knitting as Sherlock watched the sun set through the parlour window. He felt strangely restless and uneasy, and he didn’t know why. Normally he would have found the sound of her needles irritating, but this evening the sound pinned him to his chair. The sound was like someone speaking, whispering, just out of his hearing range, a secret just out of reach. Hypnotic.
“What?” John said, his brow creasing.
Yun smiled back, slow; Sherlock could see him relaxing into his chair. “What made you want to redecorate now? It was quite beautiful before.”
“I made an error, Watson,” Holmes said. “I had assumed that the dancing men were pictograms, depicting a story. Or that they were like the hieroglyphics of the ancient Egyptians, a language heretofore not known. Since Mrs. Cubitt was American in origin, perhaps a language of one of the peoples that lived there before the white people came. But now I realize – stupid! – that it is a simple representational code, with each figure representing a letter in the English language. If ever I had a fault, my dear Watson, it is that I assume that problems are more complicated than they seem, that those who created the problems are as intelligent as I am.”
“Are you sure, Sherlock?”
Their clothes seemed to melt off them, under the heat of John’s fingertips. John’s face was a strange mixture of sadness and joy as he kissed all of Sherlock’s scars, whispering love into them, tracing the lines of his still-too-prominent ribs. Meanwhile Sherlock was discovering the vast undiscovered territory of John’s skin and the varieties of texture and sensitivity.
“John, quickly, get underground, there’s something happening. Get underground, I’ve got Rosie and we’re going to 221C, get underground, please, John.” He was babbling, somehow he was babbling, and he hung up to stop. He quickly texted,
“That’s right, you’re a barrister,” John breathed. His brain was still trying to get hold of what had happened, trying to make sense of Sherlock’s mouth and lips forming around words that he would never normally use, in a manner he had never used.
“We’ve been running tests for a week now,” Bahdri said, his fingers still tapping at the console. “First some remotes, then some manned ones. Slippage is minimal, perhaps only one hour, but sometimes as high as thirty-six. But never higher, and location has been spot on every time.”
“Oh goody. Another fun filled day in happy land,” John said, moving toward the door.
"Come on,” the woman said.
“Yes,” he says. “Get the toffee cake, two spoons,” and is out the door before I can blink.
The fire was lit, the heat and the light warming him immediately. Sherlock and Rosie were nowhere to be seen, then he heard a splash and giggle from the loo.
“Front row for me, then,” said Keith in his loud voice that sounded like he thought he was in a pub. John had taken an instant dislike to him on the first night – it seemed that Keith was less there to learn about art but had thought that the class would be a great place to find dates.
I look up to see that we’re nearly at my flat, and say so, but I think I hear him say, very softly, “For the best, really.”
If I’m right about this, this is really fucking tragic.
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed. He reached down and grabbed John’s arse in both hands, kneading and scratching at the skin and muscles he found there. “I want you inside me. I want you to fuck me. This is your home, I am your home. Come home inside me.”
“Take your clothes off.”
“Sorry,” John said, and reluctantly pulled his hand away.

He found himself thinking constantly of the time Inara had held a cool cloth to his bruised face.
John slipped the jacket off, and hung it on the back of a chair. He started to shrug his own jacket off, but Sherlock stopped him, placing his hands over John’s and saying, “Wait.”
“Of course, sir.”
And thank you to everyone who followed me and John and Sherlock from The House to Victoria to Toronto... and back again.
“I’ll see you in five days,” he said.
He was aware of the police in the room staring at them curiously, but nothing existed for him except the body, the paper, the pencil, and the heat of Sherlock along his side. He kept expecting Sherlock to tell him to hurry up, but he stayed remarkably silent, despite shifting restlessly.
“And yet here you are,” Sherlock said. They moved into the opening position, hip to hip, right arms around each other’s waist, left arms held high. “Do you want to dance the lead?”
“And then what?” Sherlock said. “What happens then?”
, all of you.”
Sherlock had a fine sheen of sweat over his body, and felt better than he had in ages. John had been playing his role well, mocking Sherlock’s every move, but Sherlock noticed that every trace of John’s limp had disappeared. He had a feeling that the cane would be left behind, either in the studio or at the hotel, before the end of the week.
Dìyù = hell
“Post.”
“I have. I know his name, I’ve seen his face. There is no doubt whatsoever. When those imbeciles from the Yard arrive they will know – they will
His hand stilled suddenly as his brain tripped over an unwelcome thought. How would he clean himself up when he came? The sheets, his handkerchief, the undergarments? Mrs. Hudson did all the laundry. He couldn’t bear the idea of the evidence of his self-pleasuring being seen by anyone else, much less someone he had to look in the eye every day. No disposable tissues invented yet either.
They went upstairs, John leaning heavily on the banister but without too much pain. Holmes hung his coat and hat with unnatural care.
Sherlock’s recovery was not without difficulties. John declared him to be severely dehydrated and malnourished, even more so than usual, and confirmed that he had been concussed, so he was restricted to his cot for most of the time, only allowed to stand if John was nearby.
Sherlock smiled small. “And one can find swans in a forest.”
Holmes was right; John knew because he had seen such swords before, he had held them in his hand. He had been at Cape Fear River, on board Rhett’s flagship,
The driver shifted into gear and the car leapt out into the streets. Sherlock looked back to see the guard running fruitlessly after the car.
Translations:
John’s eyes lit up, and he pulled himself down the bed. “My turn, then. How do you do that?”
Sherlock stood straight and tall. “I am a Companion, and it is my choice. And I choose no.”
“I’m pretty sure Lassiter closed them all down.” Bahdri yawned hugely. “Look, my phone’s been ringing off the hook too, all day. It’s after ten. Let me get some sleep, and I’ll call some of the other techs in the morning, okay? You get some sleep too, John.”
“Ba!” John heard, and then a loud splash.
Sherlock’s foot was instantly on the rung, and he was pulling himself up. He felt John pushing at him, first at his shoulder, then his waist, then under his arse, then Sherlock was rolling onto the hard and filthy bricks. John was soon beside him, dripping water into the puddle already created by Sherlock. John staggered to his feet and shook himself like a dog. “Wait here,” he said, and disappeared down an alleyway.
John heard Sherlock smile above him, and he focused again on his work.
Sherlock straightened his back, lifted his chin, stepped away from Pavlović and Maja. “Very well, thank you,” he said. He smoothed down the front of his jacket. “The medical professionals here are… very good at what they do.”
When he finished, he looked at the result with some pride, but dismay struck when he realized how much time he had spent on the decorations; Sherlock had already left the room, leaving behind a beautifully plump rising loaf in a pan. Instead of pulling out his phone again, John spent the second rise glaring at his loaf, daring it to rise faster.
There are some blokes who learn how to have sex by watching porn, and others who learn by… having sex. Guess which is better? And guess which one John is? He knows that foreplay is not just something for a golf course. His best trick is after making me come two or three times, and then after he’s come, he gets one more orgasm out of me. The first time, all I could do was lie there and say, “Golly,” which I have never, ever said before in my life.
“Well, of course, I could have delegated my artistic manager, or ballet master, or resident choreographer. But their English is negligible, and besides, I wanted to see you again, Sherlock.” Her voice deepened into a purr. “It’s been too long.”
Sherlock led them out of the room, away from the landscape. “Already taken care of.”
[Sherlock has his face buried in his hands. John turns back to the camera, grinning.]
Mycroft listened for a moment more, then straightened, and smiled at John. “Thank you,” he said to the nurse, and she replaced the mask. “I don’t think you need concern yourself, John. In fact, I suspect that Sherlock will regain consciousness on his own shortly.”
“Brilliant.”
Without hesitation, Sherlock crossed to the balcony edge and stepped onto it. The wind whipped harder at his hair, at his clothes. “This.”
He gets up, and I worry for a moment that he’s just going to brush past me and disappear into London again, but he stops in the doorway. He glances back at John and Sherlock, then pulls me into the foyer. His hand, on my elbow.
“Not this time, Sherlock.”
“D’you think your little one might want to play?” Gemma said, though Sherlock wondered if these children would ever truly ‘play’ again. “She’s doing so well, and she might help some of the others.”
, John. It is an art form evolved during the seventeenth century, reaching its prime in the eighteenth, therefore it is appropriate to be danced to the music from its era.”
Here’s the Mad Hatter scene, with John taking Steven McRae’s role: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq8zqhqjUIo&list=PL5qf7zxCk2JBzIwfMCiRgY8UOA0ExQq77&index=13&t=0s
“I don’t want to hear your whinging for another second,” he said. He plugged in his iPod, pressed play. Beethoven – excellent. He turned it up as high as he dared and turned back to John.
“Yes, but… I’d like to leave it at that, if I could.”
“Stand up.”
Then nothing for a while. I would have thought that he’s just given up on the conversation, but I can see the three dots rotating, rolling by over and over again, while he types and erases and types again. I can imagine his brain doing the same thing.
“Because he – well, he’s brilliant.”
influential. He is also a prat.”
Sherlock bristled. “That’s an insult to both Sergei and me, and I won’t tolerate it, Janina.”
JOHN: You make it sound like you’re a time traveller from World War Two.
, he thought suddenly.
Warnings for a serious depressive episode, but I promise you that everything will be okay.
Cubitt was a big, burly man, with a ruddy face that seemed as though his was a mostly happy life, but was presently consumed with trouble. He shook John’s hand with the appropriate pleasantries, and John was once again glad he had studied up on Victorian English etiquette. A squire!
John came home after the show, his pictures rolled and tucked under his arm. He was surprised to find Sherlock in the sitting room. He had lit the fire, but instead of sitting and reading, or in his mind palace, or curled up on the sofa in a strop, Sherlock was pacing around the room impatiently. When John entered, Sherlock strode up to him, looking down on him intently.
“Got your breath?” John said.
“Sir?” said the guard at the door.
“Let’s find something to eat, shall we?”
John’s face twists, a mirror of his hand. “Sherlock, just this once,
“We’re here, Holmes,” John said. Holmes did not respond, and John’s heart fell at the thought of this brilliant man blaming himself for the murder of his client.
Jim shook his head, his face serious and sad. “I heard of the bombing. Shocking. So many lives lost.”
Sherlock paused a moment, listening to his own brain. “Yessss,” he said uncertainly, then “Yes! Oh, thank God, John. Thank you.”
“Sorry,” he says. He’s looking down at the table, his eyes wandering over the tabletop.
“I know.” He gazed at her over the rim of his cup as he sipped. “We will see this beautiful story, hear the glorious music, see the costumes. You will watch the stage, while I will watch you, watch the beauty unfold on your face. Then we will return here,” he allowed his voice to deepen, “and I will show you a different kind of beauty.”
Sherlock swallowed hard and stood, staring down into John’s deep blue eyes. “You heard me, idiot.”
“I fancy a bath.”
John’s head was a riot of recrimination and terror.
“Lovely.”
Another text, a few hours later, from John.
“Welcome to
“Yes,” John said, shaking his head a bit. “Certainly.”
(Excellent, now he won’t just think you’re a slag, he’ll think you’re a moron as well.)
Wordlessly Lestrade took out his vidder, switched it to record, and nodded at Sherlock. Sherlock faced the screen and spoke firmly.
He rang every history student he knew, but no one knew anything more than what Lassiter had said. It appeared that he had more information than anyone else, having heard Lassiter’s announcement in the lab, which had merely confirmed some rumours and denied others.
“I do.” Sherlock frowned. “Do you? Want to live here with me?”
Sherlock shoved the sketchbook into his hands and said, “Draw me.”
Michael heard his name and came over. “Hey John. I think you’re the second last, it’s just Marie to come through now.”
“Ah, no, I am the one who is honoured. I have greater honour than anyone else in the room.”
[John backs up, and now we see the whole room. It’s about 20x20, hardwood floors, a mirror and a barre along one wall, and large windows letting in London’s weak sunlight. This is Sherlock’s practice room, on the upper floor of his flat at 221B Baker Street.]
“Oh yeah – the one that said 221B.”
Dunworthy smiled grimly. “Nine. No one’s going back, not while I’m Department Head.”
“Do you like her?”
Endless gratitude as well to everyone who has been following this story, with your kudos and comments. Many thanks to all.
You’re NOT broken. He needs you. Just tell him.
“Didn’t expect to see you here,” he says softly, and it’s killing me to hear his voice again.
told him where it had landed.
“Every action,” he said, tilting his forehead against Sherlock’s, “has an equal and opposite reaction. Yeah?”
He ran as fast as he could, keeping to the darker side of the street. His ballet shoes helped him to run quietly, but he could feel every rock and stone underneath. He could hear no footfalls behind him but surmised that Maja was looking for her gun first. She clearly knew the streets and alleys of Belgrade extremely well, so losing her that way was unlikely.
“Just-” Bahdri stopped shaving, and looking John in the eyes. “Just trust me, okay?”
Sherlock moved to the far left side of the mirror, standing at his full height. Then he began to glide to the right, while moving down. For all the world it looked as though he was going down an escalator. What made the impression all the funnier was the expression of pure boredom on his face. One could almost believe he was in Harrod’s.
“He won’t leave,” Mrs. Hudson said sharply.
The rooms were large and airy, with large windows, and comfortable looking chairs. John was briefly mystified by the lack of a kitchen, then remembered that Mrs. Hudson would likely be preparing their meals.
“A very wise investment. Jim, will you tell me? About your… re-evaluation. I want to know more about you, given the circumstances.”
The nurse did not respond, ignoring him as though he had never spoken, as though he was still unconscious.
“Well, that’s good, innit?” Greg picked up his sandwich again in eternal hope.
They stayed like that for a moment; John giving Holmes time to assimilate the new information, the paradigm shift, and giving himself time to adjust to the fact that Holmes was in his arms, and wanted to be there. It was wonderful.
John was slightly hunched over, as if concentrating completely on his dancing. His hands were clenched into fists, and tension bridged across his shoulders, but below his hips his legs were loose, relaxed, and yet absolutely in control.
“Well, I’m sick to death of you. Don’t you dare put that rock - pop - whatever it is - crap on my stereo. Don’t you…”
I owe a bazillion thanks to so many people: to everyone who read, and who commented, and who kept my spirits up while I wrote; to my marvellous beta team, for making this so much better; to the Fic Writers' Retreat 2017 group who inspire me every day; to the creators of each of these universes; to Mr. Standbygo for his encouragement and visuals of The Baker.
“Curly? How did you get it to curl at the ends like that?” Bahdri said.
A few meters ahead, in the gloom of the forest, John could see the glint of metal. As they grew closer, he saw that it was a small scooter, similar to what he’d seen children playing with, leaned up against a tree. Next to that was a pile of earth, clearly recently disturbed.
“Don’t be afraid,” John said, more to Brigit than to Mrs. Perry, as Mrs. Perry looked like she had more steel in her. “We just need to find out what happened. Tell us everything you remember.”
He tried Dunworthy again but got the same buzz. After a few tries he was able to get hold of T.J., waking him up.
John laughed. “It’s all right, Sherlock. I already drew that one.”
“French?”
any more. I’ve seen what’s out there – there’s crime, there’s murder, there’s kidnapping. I nearly lost Rosie to that, and I shot the man who took her. I killed him, and I’ll never face the repercussions for that. That’s what it’s like out there, it’s lawlessness. In here, everything works within the rules, there’s civility here. That’s good. But there’s no part for me to play here, and you know it.”
“Sherlock!” Mycroft said. “You will be safe, I promise you, I can-”
He helped Rosie get ready, wishing that he had thought to have extra clothes for her at the flat; her current outfit was decidedly dirty and dingy, but he nonetheless straightened her dungarees, making sure she was all buttoned into her little coat. He put on his own coat and slung the rucksack over his shoulder. Then he held out his hand and Rosie took it immediately.
John’s lips brushed his, dry and soft and quiet, more a tickle than a kiss. Then another, more firm, and another. Sherlock’s breath shuddered.
“Of course I’m sweaty, you git,” John says, but without any heat to it. He’s still trying to catch his breath.
And with a wave he went out the door.
“Oh, well done,
I especially try not to think of him saying, “It’ll pass.”
“So you’re a bit phobic of octopus,” John said.
Sherlock was quiet for so long John assumed he hadn’t heard, or had decided to ignore him. A full five minutes later, Sherlock startled him by muttering, “She turned herself in.”
“Yeah, but I don’t know why. I haven’t seen Bahdri in a few days.”
“What?”
“Watson, I must beg you to allow me to speak first. I have been collecting my thoughts all the way here, and I have rehearsed these words carefully. Kindly allow me to speak, without interruption.”
“No, you are,” Sherlock said, tilting his forehead against John. “Thank you. For figuring it out, before I could realize what was wrong.”
“You go,” John says.
“I have no basis for comparison.”
, until he could land on the exact spot every time. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Laughter gave way to groans, shaking shoulders gave way to rolling hips. They moved so easily from mirth into lust that the two emotions comingled freely between their bodies.
He wasn’t sure what either of them said when they were finally naked in front of each other, what exact words were murmured as they touched each other’s bodies for the first time. But the tone of the words was sweet and deeply loving and full of soaring joy of being alive, alive together.
He imagined John standing in the sitting room, exactly as he had left him, as though in a movie that he had paused. He tried to concentrate on the evidence, but navy blue eyes kept appearing in his imagination, sparking with life and something he had never seen before. He wanted to curl up in the midnight of those eyes; if he could rest, he could rest there.
John quickly tried to recall what Sherlock had been saying while he had been lost in thought.
Sherlock cut himself off, pressed his lips together. John’s pencil filled in the details of Sherlock’s face, his jawline, his throat with his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed. The lines of his torso. The smooth, circular scar of a bullet, created by John’s wife, his dead wife.
“Moderation,” Holmes spat, and turned away from them.
I think about this a bit, surprised by my own answer. “No. So long as you’re not just looking for a babysitter. I am the world’s most disastrous babysitter.”
of embarrassment.”
Who the fuck are you?
They piled out of the cab, and John raised his eyebrows when Mrs. Hudson pulled out her small suitcase along with theirs.
They made brief excursions to Trafalgar Square, finding convenience stores and replenishing their supplies from the food shelves there. The smell of them was intolerable, with refrigerators full of dairy products without power for days, so they made such forays at the greatest speed possible.
And then a picture comes in of a long knife, covered in blood. I lose a bit of blood out of my face. Holy fuck, he’s insane.
. Do you understand?”
Dong ma = understand?
A small smile began to break across her face. “I haven’t been to the Yúlè in years. What are we seeing?”
Like the others in the café, John found himself caught between being frozen in this beautiful moment, and wanting to stride forward and take Sherlock into his arms. He settled for concentrating on staying in his seat, and willing himself not to tear up.
“Is it always like this? So lavish.”
“Stay calm! Maja!
,” Sherlock sang.  He moved again, and when his eyes opened, John got a shock of near electricity.
“Sherlock, dear! There you are!” a female voice called across the gallery.
Sherlock turned to face him. The room was flooded with light, reflecting back against the mirrors and the pale wooden floor. He loved this room, and now John was in it.
Sometimes we wouldn’t even leave the café. Just pull the curtains down and have at it over the counter. I’d sterilize the whole thing the next day though. I’m not a monster, or an idiot. I wouldn’t want to fail my health inspection over something like that.
He thought for a bit, then pulled out his mobile and punched in a number he’d memorized a long time ago, but never actually dialed.
“Can’t you see the cameras, Pavlović? You want to take me down in front of the media? The all-powerful, far-reaching BBC? Some of them may even be livestreaming to the net.”
“What part?”
“Well, pardon,” John said. “I’d just got off my shift when you called. Figured washing a layer of sweat off might be a preferred choice.” He looked up at the theatre, bright with light, and the small knots of people standing outside, crying in their finery. “Given the occasion and all. What happened?”
“You’re spying on me again, Mycroft.”
“Victor was everything I was not – athletic, sturdy, funny. Rather than call me odd, or tease me for my fondness for science or for my observations about people – I had started that from a young age – rather, he played with me, creating games of fancy and imagination. We spent nearly every waking hour together.
Sherlock twisted his head around and saw a small, compact blond man step up to the right of the man holding him.
“Okay.”

“And call whom?” Pavlović said, his eyebrow arching. “Mrs. Hudson is enroute and unreachable for several hours still. You have no romantic partner.” Pavlović stared at him sharply. “Your… brother, perhaps?”
John was still holding Rosie, still had her nappy bag over his shoulder, incongruous with the neat suit and tie he was wearing. Sherlock noted the cut and quality of the suit, and internally nodded his approval – John’s tastes had improved. When they had first met, John’s clothes had never fit properly, never looked right on him, bought for value and endurance over quality. During the preparations for the wedding Sherlock had lectured him at length about it, and the message had clearly been received.
“Sherlock Holmes,” John said.
“Show me tonight. I’ll storm into your room to yell at you for something and then look.”
[Extreme close up of John’s eye; some sounds of fumbling.]
“Yes,” John said. He brushed his fingertips against that blush. “Me too.”
There was nothing like it, and it was everything to Sherlock – his drug, his addiction, his world.
tonight?” he said, pleased with himself that he’d thought to look at the programme in his hand before he began this conversation. “One of my favourites.” He hoped fervently that no one would ask him more details about the play; he couldn’t remember it from school at all.
“It’s hardest for the ones that are the most close to us,” she said.
“The hell?” she yelled at Colin. “I was just about to speak with
Jim nodded over the steam of the tea. “I have been doing the same – re-evaluating – though without the trauma of an event such as the bombing. How is the tea?” Jim took a sip, smiling into the cup.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “You stayed,” he said.
Sherlock heard Commissioner Yun gasp as they entered the ballroom, and smiled. He had seriously considered not going to the Ball and remaining at home to continue his work, but now he was glad he had gone out. The Commissioner was relatively clever, and had never been to the Ball on Persephone before; it felt good to show off a bit.
“Still. Must be a new record. Not counting travel, I think you solved this in about forty-five minutes.”
Sherlock let himself breathe; once, twice. “I’ll go this afternoon.”
He fell silent, and John looked up at him. “Sometimes what?”
“Does she remember her mother?”
Sherlock addressed John’s bruised and sore feet. “You’re the most loyal person I know, John. I understand, I do. I – I’ll figure a way out once I’m at the theatre, I suppose, and-”
“Five.”
“Sir?” shouted the guard.
Time after time, Sherlock fought to shove those thoughts away from his brain, forced himself to focus on the present issue. Focus was of the utmost importance now, if they wanted to succeed.
“Rosie?” Mycroft whispered to the Director.
Then supper. Then bed. She insisted on ‘kissing Daddy good night’, giving the phone a little buss before saying “night night Daddy, night night Sh’lock” and curling up in the nest of his coat. He blew out the candle before he could look at the phone himself. He stared into the dark for hours into the night, until sheer boredom and lack of data made him lie down and close his eyes.
“Where’s Lestrade?”
“It’s all right, slow, slow,” Sherlock muttered to Maja. Her breath was rabbit-quick, with occasional tiny whimpers. He drew her close and set the pace at casual but quick, just out of the pool of the lights from the streetlamps, like a couple out late after a night out.
“Fine.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I hadn’t heard that. Sounds a bit far-fetched.”
It’s just not going to work.
He managed to make it up to his bedroom before bursting into laughter.

“Need a rest?” John said.

“Of course. Of course. Forget I – sorry.”
meant something different to Sherlock – different from before. Those two words produced a jumble of mixed feelings in Sherlock’s gut – longing to go back to London, sick that he would not be going with John. He wondered if John would bring Maja to England, or whether they would stay in eastern Europe. He wondered which would be worse.
They came to a door that John recognized, but for the chains hanging loose from one of the door handles. A paper sign saying “Closed” was tacked over the plate on the door that John knew read “History Lab”.
John’s lips moved against his throat, but completely silently. Through the mounting tide of sensation Sherlock felt the pattern of John’s words against his skin – “Come for me, come on, come for me-”
JOHN: Note that even while dancing, we are maintaining social distance.
, John thought. “John Garrideb?”
Sherlock was in the corridor between the bathroom and the kitchen. Behind him was a masked man dressed all in black. He was holding an honest to God pair of nunchuks, one baton in each hand, with the chain across Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock had managed to get his hands under the chain, but his face was red and straining. The masked man was pulling him backwards, trying to get him off his feet.
“All right?” he asked.
“You served me tea, and told me it was natural oolong, the tea grown naturally on Highgate. And suddenly all the pieces fell together. All the cases in the spider’s web had to do with something false masquerading as the real thing, while you took the real thing for yourself. Gold in dental work instead of synthetic. Fake stultorumite painted to look like amniculusite. The jealous lover, the false Romeo poisoning the real one. And then I realized that I was sitting in front of the false Jim Moriarty-”
Sherlock’s attacker hesitated, just for a split second. In that brief second, the blond man cocked his gun, the sound of it shockingly hard and loud in the alley. In the next second, the scarred man was off and running, the sound of his feet scrabbling getting fainter and fainter.
Moriarty himself met him at the door, dressed neatly in a dark blue suit with a checkered waistcoat. “Sherlock Holmes. You honour me with your presence.”
“I do talk. Run.”
“Of course.” Sherlock offered Rosie another spoonful but she turned her head and sighed. “Full, Watson? Right, thank you for your participation.” He carefully wiped her face and as much of her hair as he could, then handed her some large plastic keys to play with. “The cost of store-bought baby food is prohibitive, compared to the relatively small expense and investment of time that it takes to make it oneself. Also one is more assured of the contents, without preservatives and salt and so forth.”
She led him down the alley, then onto a smaller, darker street. Sherlock didn’t recognize it but getting away from the main roads was wise.
Something shifted inside Sherlock. He knew now that John might not be an ally, but now he knew he wasn’t an enemy either.
He finished, and lay back on the bed. “And then I fell, and I don’t remember anything else until I woke here,” Sherlock said.
“John.”
John frowned. “That’s odd. You wouldn’t think it would be busy in Brighton Beach in February. Unless…” His shoulders slumped. “It’s Valentine’s Day. Oh my God. I forgot. I’m so sorr-”
“Well, look at you two,” I say. “You look like you just won each other at a fair.”
But we don’t get very far before his phone goes off again. It’s on silent, but it buzzes. We both turn to look, and as we do, it buzzes again. It buzzes so much it’s kind of dancing around the table.
I wrote the first draft of this chapter and the next week the Hozier “Movement” video came out, with Sergei Polunin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSye8OO5TkM
“I haven’t the first clue,” John said.
“There’s a gang of us up by the old gazebo in the park. Not that the gazebo’s there any more, but we help each other out, like. You should come and join us.”
“Hey,” I say. “Can I get you something?”
“That’s my ruttin’ business to know, not yours. You going to help your
Sherlock laughed, and felt lighter. “Let’s go look.”
“Nothing. Not really. I just…”
“Sherlock, don’t move,” John said without thinking.
If the kiss in Garrideb’s rooms had been good, with adrenaline and relief flooding his veins, this kiss was wonderful. It was careful, and soft, and chaste, but completely mutual. It was merely lips against lips, but Holmes was gentle and a little tentative, and John reflected that care as he kissed back. After a moment, Holmes sat back, his eyes fluttering.
John crept back onto the bed, holding himself up over Sherlock’s body, caging him in with his flesh. “I love you,” he murmured. He lowered himself down, and heard Sherlock’s breath come out as a sigh of relief, as though he had just returned home from a long journey.
Before Holmes could explain, they heard the bell of the front door, and Mrs. Hudson’s voice mixed with a man’s sharp voice, the American accent clear even from a distance.
John’s hand darted down and grabbed Benvolio by the wrist and held it up, showing to all the purple stains on his fingertips.
He stopped, frozen in horror at his own appearance. The makeup, so pristine on stage, had melted down his face, stripes of chalk white and lipstick like blood.
“We go home.”
After a long moment, John murmured, “Back to reality, love. I’ll go out first.”
“You did

“Ah, you’ve not seen a chess set like this, have you? All the pieces are the same colour.”
Sherlock put his fingers against John’s lips, halting the flow of words. “Stop. I have not been clear with you, and I’m sorry. There’s been too much in the way, but now there’s not.
They moved silently from their hiding space to the trap door. John’s heart was hammering with exhilaration as he positioned himself opposite Holmes on the lip of the hole in the floor.
“Sentiment,” he whispered. “John?”
“Oh, he has a heart, then? I wasn’t sure.”
“I know where is it.”
He felt himself hardening, felt John hardening with every sigh and groan.
“What’s got you so cheesed?” Jen said, as she checked a line of data. “This is such an easy assignment, easy peasy.”
“Well, yes.”
“I believe if you review the footage, you’ll find I didn’t actually say that. I simply said there was more to him than just a doctor.”
Holmes looked down at the needle, then back at John with some confusion. “Just a small dilute solution of cocaine, my dear Doctor, I mixed it myself. I use it often as an enhancer of my thinking, when a resolution to a problem is elusive. It clears the thought patterns beautifully.”
In fact his clients had been dropping off his roster. Embarrassed calls had been coming in since the bombing. Sherlock wasn’t sure if they were leaving because they were afraid after the bombing, or because of the rumours swirling as a result of the dance. He didn’t care. He barely noticed, and buried himself deeper into the case.
And he actually tucks my hand into the crook of his elbow and we set off.
After all these years, John was always amazed to see the manner in which Mycroft swept into a room, and how people scattered in his wake. Whereas John had had to argue with the nurses to be let into Sherlock’s room, Mycroft was not questioned at all, and they made their way to Sherlock’s bedside.
“I’ll help you with the plastic,” he said, and got up as well.
“I’m going to unlock the chain, and then we’re getting out. Do you understand, John?”
“I can and I will. This is a skyhome, stupid. There’s no way to leave without an airtaxi, which of course would not be allowed anywhere near without my express permission. Every door and vidderscreen needs fingerprint ident to get access, and you won’t get that. And I’ve got security all over – you thought they were just servants, butlers? Nope. Highly trained former New Alliance soldiers. If they find you near a door or a vidder, they have my permission to hog-tie you.”
“All right,” Sherlock said after a few moments.
“Yes, quite successful,” he says. For a moment I think he’s talking about us, and wonder if he’s rating my orgasms by the noise that reaches the kitchen, then I remember the experiment. “I believe I’ve just solved a cold case from 1952.”
“Because you are… Canadian? The manifest said you were British. Why did you tell me you were Canadian?”
Bahdri was silent for a long time once John had stuttered to a stop. His grip around John’s shoulders tightened.
“Because it’s
“Yes, but that’s unrelated.”
“Very well, then,” Holmes said. “All the best for your mission tomorrow. Good day, Mr. Garrideb.”
“Are you only just looking that up?”
within the genus
The beans scattered across the toasted bread, with a few, dribbling with sauce, having fallen off the toast and onto the plate. John had not had time to shop, with the Moriarty trial and its subsequent outcomes. He was too jittery to order takeaway. So he had made do with what there was in the cupboards.
“Well, yes. Frankly, if I don’t receive one a month, I worry that I’m losing my touch.”
One night, he dreamt of a rhythmic thumping. He was dreaming of resting his head on Sherlock’s chest and listening to his heartbeat; then he opened his eyes and the sound didn’t stop. He staggered to the door and opened it.
“My life as a Companion is over. I don’t want it any more. Even if I’d never realized Moriarty was behind everything, I knew that I wouldn’t ever be truly happy again unless I was with you.
“Your accent – the elongated and atonal pronunciation of your As was the giveaway. Your father was a miner of amniculusite, possibly even a foreman, so you would likely have the specific knowledge I need. What does the H stand for?”
“I’ve a nice bottle of wine back at mine,” I say.
“I have to have someplace to store music, after all, John. You know how important it is to my thinking process.”
“The English are such prudes, such Puritans when it comes to truth. They want their entertainment spoon fed to them, like porridge.”
John appeared in the kitchen doorway, still in his pajamas, still blurry with sleep. “What’s all this then?”
Mycroft moved towards the recorder but Mrs. Hudson shook her head. Sherlock was staring at her, incomprehension fogging his brain.
He followed her through the streets to the cathedral. As they walked, he saw more familiar landmarks rising up before him, less damaged than Westminster. He smiled when he saw the Old Bailey – its tower shattered but the building intact. Then St. Paul’s  was in front of them, solid and stone and reassuring.
“Yup.” John popped the P as he grinned, then winced as the astringent worked on his broken skin. “After Da died, weren’t no money at home. I was old enough and it seemed like the best thing. Happened that they needed medics at the time, so I learned how to march and patch folks up at the same time.”
Sherlock grinned as he flipped John to his back, pinning him down. “I’d like to start now, if I may.”
John could feel himself wavering, and knew that Sherlock could see that. “I don’t know a lot of the really recent stuff, it all sounds like auto-tuned crap to me.”
“What did you mean?” John burst out.
There was silence for a moment, uncomfortable and tense. Sherlock found himself already missing the easy flow of words between them. He covered his discomfort by concentrating on the folds of his origami.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured. “But we have to.”
Xiānshēng = Mister
Sherlock kissed him again, carefully and soft. “The realm of miracles is not my area of expertise,” he said. “But my understanding is that one doesn’t deserve a miracle in order to have one. That flies in the face of what a miracle is for. Because if that was true, you would never have come into my life in the first place. Your very existence is a miracle for me.”
“I’m glad,” I say, and am immediately embarrassed by the lump in my throat, my suddenly blurry vision. “I really am.”
John entered and strode up to Sherlock in his chair, his face lined and dark. “Explain this to me, please,” he said without preamble. “Personal Companion.”
,” said Mycroft.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said softly, and John recognized William’s tone ghosting through.
“No worries,” Jerome said, and the bastard didn’t sound out of breath at all, despite the fact that he had no doubt been running from the café. “You think this is him?”
“It’s all right, it’s all right,” she said, and her tone, if not her voice, made Sherlock think again of John, of John calming him down, pacifying him when the Yarders were stupid, trying to talk him down from the roof of Barts Hospital. He kept the gun trained on her, hating how much his hand was shaking.
“So.” John’s eyes brightened. “I’ve been humpin’ so much work this week I ain’t seen any news. Have they found the bomber? Once they figured out it wasn’t me, of course. Have you been working on the case?”
“You had better,” Waters said. “Marie already snuck out with her gown.” She let go of the jacket reluctantly and stomped off to tell Colin to return his tuxedo.
“I know you, Sherlock Holmes. You were going to leave – let me guess, sneak out in the middle of the night, just like you’ve done before. Leave Rosie and me. Again.”
dǒng ma = understand
“Friend?” And now, only now, Mycroft looked astonished.
“Want to play?”
Meanwhile, Sherlock had made a caramel, the boiled sugar precisely the correct colour. “I’ll do the first few, for the top,” Sherlock said. “I’ve spilt enough chemicals on my hands, burns don’t bother me anymore.”
John’s heart knotted with anxiety all over again. The doctor in him wanted to cure, instantly, to help Sherlock rise up immediately and be freed from whatever pain was troubling him.
Sherlock found his voice rising, all of the fear and frustration pouring out of him. “John, I am a detective. I solve crimes, mysteries. Then I turn it over to the law. The law, John, which doesn’t
“The case, John! I can’t solve the case if I can’t be in the same room as the damn thing!”
He turned and gave her his full attention. “An excellent nap, Watson,” he said, keeping his voice clear of his thoughts and worries. “Are you refreshed?”
A man entered the hall from within the house, his hand already extended to them. “Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson? I am Inspector Martin, of Norwich Constabulary. Your telegram arrived just after I did, Mr. Holmes – Mr. Cubitt was your client, I understand?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Mining is by far the main industry on Regina. You mentioned your sister’s dental work, and your teeth are in good condition as well-”
“Then… draw.”
I turn up the volume on my phone. Within seconds there’s a beep.
“Chopin’s Nocturne, opus nine, number two.”
“You’re having a bath?”
“Poison’s not hard to find, either. There’s poison all around us.
“We’ll go ahead with the plan. Just – I want to get Maja out too. More than ever, now. I don’t want Pavlović to have anything over me, over the baby. He has our passports, and I don’t see him giving them back in a hurry. He’s a manipulative bastard, and he’ll just keep using us and using us. I don’t see a baby changing his mind about that – he’ll just see it as another way he’s got us under his thumb.”
Mrs Hudson squinted at the telly. “The fellow baking? Michael Sheen, he played an angel in-”
Before Sherlock could take a breath, the blond man had a gun out and raised it up; the scarred man had to skid to a stop to prevent running into it. The tip of the barrel brushed against the man’s forehead.
“Well?” Lestrade said. Sherlock could hear the hope in his voice, and was angry at himself for not being able to tell them anything definite… yet. He would do it, though. He always did.
John laughed, a bright giggle that made Sherlock chuckle in response.
“Do explain, Janina,” Sherlock drawled, working to hide his confusion. “Don’t waste time. I have a performance to prepare for, as you recall.”
Wǒ de tiān a = Oh my God (literally ‘oh my sky’)
“Just try,” he said. His eyes were soft but focused. “Listen. The music will tell your body how to move.”
“We’ll need to question her later,” Holmes said.
“I’ll admit, that was smart, your trick at the fountain,” she purred. “But all I had to do was circle back to the embassy, I knew I’d run into you again.”
“It means that the law will begin to crack down on homosexuality, try to further demonstrate that it is an illegal practice and is to be condemned. Arrests will be made.”
“Okay,” John said. Only Sherlock would turn an amateur art show into an experiment in deductions.
Sherlock swooped around the bank’s vault, peering through his magnifying glass. John was busy interviewing the tellers so he didn’t know anything was wrong until Lestrade came and pulled gently at his sleeve.
“Not offended. You’re right, it is quite different. Companions choose who they want to engage with. Prospective clients make a proposal on vidder, and I choose based on compatibility and interest.”
“Of course not.”
Sherlock was stunned to silence.
Lestrade rolled his eyes; John wondered if he had picked that habit up from Sherlock. “S’not a goldfish, Sherlock, as has been explained to me a couple of times already. It’s tropical, and terribly expensive, and the aquarium manager has been down my shirt about it since I got here.”
Sherlock sat on the toilet seat and raised his arms out of John’s way. John knelt at his feet and began to carefully tape a square of clingfilm over the dressing.
The magic words are finally said.
Thank you
Rosie raised her head half-heartedly and waved at John. “Ni ni, dada.”
“What?”
“Then off you go. Nice to chat.”
Sherlock blinked at this abrupt change in John’s demeanour. “What is it?” he said.
“Terrible thing, down at the Manor. Inspector just came through from Norwich. One of the oldest families in the county, and now this terrible thing.”
“Rosie,” he said, his voice rusty and grating.
There was a faint dirt road running east/west beside the house. He stood at the side of the road for a moment, wondering which direction would bear the most fruit. He could see no sign of civilization in either direction. He jogged a little way down the road, westward, ignoring the pain in his ribs. After only a few hundred meters he stopped, his legs wobbly and weak. He had no idea if this was the best direction to a larger town or city. He could be going in the opposite direction of where he needed to go.
John’s breath stuttered in his chest when he realized what Sherlock meant. Sherlock looked up at him, looking vulnerable and young.
[John’s tap shoes are old but the tapping sound is clear and distinct. Sherlock’s are more muffled but clear enough.]
He chuckled to himself at  Holmes’ image of a bullet frozen in midair by the power of love. Well, if anyone could do it, it would have been Mr. Cubitt; even from John’s brief time with him it was obvious he loved his wife very much. Mrs. Cubitt had regained consciousness while he and Holmes were there; she wept bitterly at the news of her husband’s death. So she had loved him too.
John gave the address to the cab driver, and turned to Sherlock, who looked a little green.
“But I can hear…”
Sherlock was silent, his lips pressed together, not agreeing at all.
“You’re welcome,” John grinned.

(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock,” John said. His arms were rigid with tension as they held the controls, his face equally tense. “We’re breakin’ atmo in ‘bout two minutes, I’ll lose his signal, I can’t turn around after-”
He had said those words to one other person in his life, and both people in that tiny room missed that same person intensely.
John stopped, breathless, suddenly worried that he had said too much, revealed too much about his own time and about his heart. Holmes was staring at him in amazement.
“Bahdri-”
“Oh, that’s the traditional Regina stroke. Thought you’d know that, genius. There’s so much pollution in the water, you have to swim like that to keep the
“Lassiter had me working the comp for eight hours straight,” he grumbled. “I’m just glad everyone came in all right, by the end I could hardly see the numbers.”
The two policemen obeyed, though not quickly enough for Holmes. John couldn’t miss Holmes’ eyes rolling like an impatient horse at the start line. “Fetch my valise from my room, if you wouldn’t mind, Watson? It’s on top of my wardrobe, the one with the buckle.”
Chapter Notes
“And what doesn’t she like?” John said, with a bemused look that Sherlock had to look away from.
“I do, Inspector Lestrade and I were in fact school-fellows, and we still communicate often. He has frequently mentioned your ability to assist with strange cases, and that your observations are occasionally of assistance.” John felt himself bristling at this diminishment of Holmes’s work, but Holmes showed no reaction, and Inspector Martin carried on. “However, I feel that you will find that this case is too simplistic for you – it is fairly obvious that Mrs. Cubitt shot her husband, and then herself.  She now lies near death, either sooner by her wounds or later by the noose.”
, Lestrade.”
“We have to go, now.” He pulled Maja down the alley, hoping that it opened out onto Kosovska Street.
He looked up, heart racing, to see John standing beside the car, leaning on his cane, holding up the car keys in the other hand. “I’d rather you didn’t tear my car apart, please,” he said mildly.
“Left side?”
“Go on, then,” John said. “
John nodded, his lips a thin, pale line. “I started shouting at the screen, I couldn’t help myself. I couldn’t believe… Unfortunately that reminded them that I was there. They picked me up and threw me in a car, and took me to a jail somewhere. I didn’t even notice where they were taking me.”
John took his hand as he waved absently towards the controls. “She’s fine. She’s fine. Will you? Come on,
He had not been a child who had played games, but now he invented games for her, suitable to their constricted space. Monkey in the Corner. Balance the Tins. Water Bottle Bowling. Anything to keep her engaged and moving, exercising her muscles and her brain. It was exhausting, and yet she seemed to have unlimited energy. He observed when her energy and mood rose and dipped during the day; when it correlated with hunger, with naps. Her naps were never long enough for Sherlock, who was amazed to learn he could be so busy and so bored at the same time.
Sherlock nodded again, unable to trust his voice. He saw John stand and cross in front of him.
As though aligned with his words, the snow fell faster, covering the ground and the body in a thin layer of white. Sherlock nodded at Lestrade, and his team sprang into action, bagging the body and running about to confirm Sherlock's conclusions. Sherlock stepped back, suddenly awkward and superfluous.
“All right,” Mycroft said. He smiled, and Sherlock tried to think of the last time he had seen his brother’s genuine smile.
SHERLOCK: Yay. I survived.
looks gobsmacked.
“True. But she can live knowing that her husband loved her and had concern enough for her to come to you.”
“Y-Yes,” John said. He had no clue where this was going.
After a long, horrible, silent moment, Sherlock pulled a piece of origami paper towards him and began to fold. “Do you remember why I do the origami, the animals?”
“Let me handle this, Maja, just be quiet!” John turned back to Sherlock, his eyes flicking up to the camera over the door of the room. He nodded small to Sherlock.
Sherlock stared at her.
“That’s about a metre and a half. You’re not a monkey.”
“Forgive me,” Ella said with a small smile, “but from what you’ve told me about him, ‘being polite’ isn’t really something he does.”
He bit his lip and sighed internally. “Right. You’ve got security footage, I assume?”
“You didn’t want to see, John,” Sherlock said softly. “You wanted to leave your old life behind and you didn’t want to see that in her.”
“Is anyone meeting us or do we make our own way there?”
“When I met Maja, I thought, maybe I can just start over. Wife, maybe kids, a life I never thought I’d have. I moved us out to the farm, outside of Prokuplje, well away from Belgrade, thinking that my past could never catch up with us there.
There were only questions and no answers. Had John heard his message and taken shelter? If so, was the shelter sufficient against the devastation? If he had still been in the Tube when the bomb hit – or had he taken the Tube at all? If he had taken a cab, he would have had no protection at all.
“No…?”
) turned to meet them, smiling at Rosie. “Millie, this is Rosie and her dad, I found them in the wastelands. I think they could use a good meal.”
“Sherlock, this could be – difficult. Bad for your reputation, your standing, you-”
“It’s beautiful,” Yun said, staring into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Okay.”
If anyone knows Serb enough to correct my grammar (thank you, Google Translate), please let me know. Thanks to @shamelessmash for her help with the French.
Lestrade stared at John, who shrugged.
“Did you mean that?” John said quietly.
“You admitted it to me, Sherlock,” Maja said. “Back in the alley. I’m wearing a bodycam; I’ve got the evidence now.”
To his horror, he realized that the muffled shouts and thumps were coming from the coffin.
“What’s your flatmate – Sherlock?-” (That was good, nice and casual) “- like with her?”
Assuming that Mycroft’s estimates were correct, the bomb would have hit Britain, perhaps even London itself. Given the impact he had heard, it had indeed landed in London, but to the east. If it had struck central London, they would certainly not have survived.
“Then would you mind explaining this?”
“They think – eleven minutes. We only just heard, Sherlock. I – I can’t get a car to you in time.”
They lay down next to each other, side by side, facing each other, not touching.
Who never lived and so can never die:
“Goodbye,
Sherlock stood in the middle of the lounge. He had had a strange urgency in his body, ever since the hospital, ever since that moment in the alley when he had realized John had been hurt. It was a frantic sensation, like dozens of flies sealed in a small bottle. It made him want to flutter his hands in the air, even though such a movement was useless and accomplished nothing. So far he had been successful in suppressing it, but he now allowed himself to move – quickly, agitated.
He looked back at Sherlock and grinned. “Would you get me a towel?”
“We need to stop wasting time complaining,” Sherlock interrupted, “and more time solving this ridiculous matter. The facts, if you please.”
“Sherlock,” John growled, “’bout sixty seconds.”
“Please,” John said.
“No.”
“You’re a good man, John,” Sherlock said without thinking. The second it was out of his mouth, though, he knew he meant it, as much as it ripped him open inside.
“Right, okay.”
In reply, Mycroft shifted his laptop, and Mrs Holmes appeared on the screen. At first she was looking at Mycroft, then followed his gesture towards the computer until she was squinting into the camera.
“Yes.”
“When.”
A couple more near immersions later, and John had improvised a solution of sorts, bracing himself against the side of the tub, and raising himself into more of a sitting position. Once he had more or less settled, he looked over at Sherlock, a tad jealous that he could stretch out. But Sherlock was looking at him with a little concern, and the heat of the water was making his hair curl a bit more than usual, and he looked so beautiful and relaxed, that John’s momentary grump passed away.
“Did you bring me a case, Mycroft?”
,’ John had said. Those five words were not just reassurance, but loyalty. John was loyal. The beans – making sure Sherlock ate, despite the severity of the situation – also meant loyalty. John believed in him. Sherlock’s head filled with the implications of that belief. It meant John wouldn’t leave him. It meant it would be harder to get John to leave him.
“Excellent.” Mycroft raised his voice. “Hello, brother mine.”
Sherlock scowled with an expression that had terrified junior ballerinas. “I am
How far would this test go? “I might go for a walk then. Get some fresh air. Aid with my recovery.”
Mrs. Perry plucked at Brigit’s sleeve, with a glare at the girl that would have frightened John out of his wits if it had been directed at him. “Come along, Brigit.”
“Beg pardon?” Jim sounded slightly confused, and Sherlock relished this tiny victory.
“Cufflinks?”
“Helps me to retain the information better, if I write it.”
He nodded in satisfaction, just as the stage manager knocked on the door, saying “Places for act three, Mr. Holmes.”
John nodded at the communication screen, now dark. “That man, your – brother?”
“We once had a passenger who taught me. Never let me win though.”
“We wanted to thank you,” John says. Sherlock nods, once, sharply but not curtly. “For getting our heads out of our arses, really. We’d been dancing around this for years, but no one really pushed the issue like you did. We’re very, very grateful.”
“Are you retiring?”
“I could tell, for instance, that the woman with curly hair, the woman in her picture is her sister, that the sister has two children and is presently expecting twins, that they were estranged in their early twenties but are reconciled now. The older woman with all the pictures of the pug - the dog in the picture is geriatric and has arthritis, and she takes it swimming twice a week for pain relief. You see, John?”
Cào = fuck
certainly don’t,” Sherlock’s voice said. Sherlock nodded; it was a good quality recorder, it sounded nearly like their live voices. Near enough to fool the idiots listening in.
Sherlock was darting, nearly dancing around the body. John had filled ten pages with sketches so far, and his hand ached around the pencil, but he just couldn’t satisfactorily capture Sherlock’s movements, the swirl of the coat, his hands pointing and gesturing. He was valiantly ignoring Donovan’s odd looks at him; he had explained to Lestrade what he was doing, that he was taking a class, earning a clap on the shoulder and a ‘Good on ya, mate,’ from him, but he had said nothing to Donovan. She hadn’t earned an explanation from him.
JOHN: [Looks back at Sherlock, his face unguarded and fond.] You were perfect.
“We’re not sure what he used to smash the casing,” Jerome said. “Something hefty, anyway – the glass is – was – a centimeter thick.”
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed. “It’s so
Maja’s lip twisted. “That’s right. And it did get him to move, didn’t it? Except you two assholes were able to keep it from us. I had no idea until I came back that you had this plan, already set to go. I thought I’d go along with it – improvisation is one of my talents.”
They all shook hands, and John and Holmes went down to the street. Holmes stood at the kerbside and waved at a hansom cab. They were silent until the cab door was shut and they were underway.
“Do excuse me, Doctor Watson,” Brigit said, with a little curtsy. She patted at her hair, tucking it under her cap. “Oh, I must look a fright, I haven’t had a moment today to fix my hair properly.”
He stood in stunned silence for a long time, staring at the only place he had ever truly considered home. Rosie seemed to appreciate his shock, or shared it, for she too was quiet, looking out over the street with wide eyes, thumb in her mouth.
“Time, and I guess some behavior modification therapy, if it’s severe. But why do you need to get over it?”
Here's how it is: Mycroft keeps an eye open, Lestrade wants to make a new deputy, Sherlock hears a story he's never heard before, and learns something about knitting.
“Not to worry, John.”
“No,” he said, slowly, and then more firmly, “No. He didn’t tease when he caught me with the fruit bowl. Perhaps he was being polite.”
During the days, he would let Rosie play in areas that seemed relatively free of broken glass and sharp debris. Rosie happily ran around the space he delineated for her, clearly happy to stretch her legs after so long cooped up.  As Rosie played, he would think.
“No, you didn’t,” John said with a small smile. “You just left.”
“I heard you, earlier. The man’s right, he ain’t responsible for another man’s debts. So
He swallowed and stood. “Fine! Fine. I’ll do the Goldberg Variations. Madame Sartor did the choreography for me for the Paris Opera House two years ago. All right?”
“Dear God. Did you ask him about the modelling? You didn’t say he was tall, too.”
“I can’t,” he said, sagging back down.
In an instant, Jerome was on Bantam, holding him down on the ground as Bantam struggled and spat. John could see Jerome’s background as a bouncer in his efficient takedown. John caught up, panting a bit and feeling his age. “Thanks, Jerome,” he gasped.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, I’m not. I just do...jobs every once and a while.”
“Ah,” Sherlock said, and then, loudly, “Ah, here it is. Their chicken tikka masala is excellent.”
He thought about the way Sherlock’s hand felt in his; the warmth of Sherlock next to him; his smile as he watched Rosie play.
“I need to know about the amniculusite industry on Regina.”
Each were holding her hand with their own dominant hand, and their combined strength gave Rosie’s flights altitude that delighted and petrified her in equal parts, but as soon as she landed, she would call out again, “Again!”
They stopped short at the sight of Maja in the middle of the sitting room, her eyes filling with tears.
“You can and you will,” John said.
“And I could have been killed as well. A matter of moments only, and I would have been amongst the dead. So. One starts to evaluate what one wishes to do with the remaining years ahead, the years that suddenly are a gift.”
As night descends upon this fabled street:
“I think I prefer the chocolate ones over the lime,” said Sherlock, licking his fingers. “But only slightly.”
He could hear the projected actors’ voices from the stage; through his panic the words drove into his mind as though whispered directly in his ear:
“Serbia is a member of the United Nations now,” Sherlock said with some heat. “You cannot prevent me from contacting my embassy, or my family.”
,” Sherlock said, his heart lighter than it had ever been.
The room was rich with silks and leather, the air delicate with incense and tea. Sherlock sat, and carefully pulled his silk kimono sleeves back to pour the boiling water into the teapot. “Your work has kept you travelling, I see, Commissioner. You’ve been to Ariel and Meridian, just within the last three months?”
“Push me. Now.”
“Yeah – yeah,” I say, intelligently.
“Hello John,” Sherlock said. “I see you took the Tube.”
This web of thoughts led to the most sensible solution: the best way to find both Mycroft and John, or for them to find him, was to return home. Back to Baker Street.
John felt mollified, and a bit guilty. “Well, it’s not
He had no idea how much time had passed. He was pressed into his chair, pinned into place by the enormity of space around him.
His body was now screaming at him, his left calf cramping, every blister on his feet sharp with pain and no doubt bleeding, but he had mastery over his body.
“Really good. Surprisingly good. When we moved in, I never expected him to have anything to do with her, in terms of her care. But he jumped right in.” His smile broadens. “The other day I came home late from work and they were both on the sofa, asleep. Rosie was curled up on his chest. He’d fed her – the kitchen was a disaster, even more so than usual – and I guess they just fell asleep. It was lovely.”
He avoided thinking about what would happen when the battery ran out.
“Jim. Please.”
“Right then.”
Sherlock freezes and goes pale, I didn’t think was possible for him to be even more pale. He swallows and swallows. His mouth opens but nothing comes out.
“You asked for a coffee!” John said.
Sherlock waited nervously, but he knew he was waiting for something.
Jim led him to a sitting room. Sherlock noted the furniture – expensive but not ostentatious, and all quite new.
All the breath was squeezed out of Sherlock’s lungs. He looked over at Rosie, who was still staring at Peppa Pig, absently tapping two blocks together.
Bahdri stopped and looked carefully at John. John was suddenly self-conscious: unshowered, several days of scraggly beard growth.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John said. His heart was pounding but he was a soldier, and soldiers were brave, weren’t they? They threw themselves into risky and dangerous situations, right? He licked his lips.
“Good. She’s very near a breakthrough in her studies, you know.”
“You had the guards take you away,” Sherlock breathed, not believing it even as he said it, “as if you were an innocent, hoping that it would spur John to action. And you could watch us better from a distance.”
“Not long. Fortunately it’s not hard to guess Lestrade’s code – ah! Got it. Now tell me more about your sister’s allergy. How did they test for it?”
“You served for a long time.”
“In the middle of the square, I suppose? When you shot my contact? That
(See the end of the chapter for
“You didn’t have to come all the way out, just to wait for me in the waiting room,” Mycroft said as he strapped himself into the helicopter.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and called John, trying to ignore how his hands were shaking. Two rings, three, four, then a click and John’s voice, “This is John Watson. Sorry I missed you…”
“There you are, Watson, some warm pyjamas for you. You like these, with the lions on them, don’t you?
He let go of his cock, and turned over, sighing. He couldn’t do it. No wonder Victorians were so repressed, if they couldn’t have a wank with some degree of privacy.
JOHN: Watch out for your ankle.
Sherlock stopped before he could remember to be contrary. John stood and limped to him until he was in Sherlock’s face, his face hard and dark with fury.
Sherlock was prepared for the shock of recognition that usually happened when he introduced himself – ‘
Before Rosie could register what John meant, and before her face could droop with disappointment, Sherlock tugged his scarf off. “Well. I hope you will allow me to attend, Watson.”
“Yes. Maja said they told her they would be taking you to the theatre tomorrow to rehearse onstage, and we’d be going home.”
Only those things the heart believes are true.
“Well, moderation would be advisable, yes,” John said, reluctant to be drawn into conversation.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, understanding and not understanding.
He was sure to not let go of Maja’s arm. She said nothing.
“Hey! Thanks so much for texting. When would you like to meet?”
Sherlock took the spoon in hand. He paused for a moment over the bowl, then began to stir with a manic energy, and for much longer than his patience would normally allow. After a long moment, John laid his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock jumped as though coming out of a trance.
It's the night watch.
Both Sherlock and Rosie looked up at him; Sherlock with as small a smile as he could manage, and Rosie with a huge, gummy, open mouthed grin. “Da!” she said.
