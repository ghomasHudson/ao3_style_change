“Cas, this is—where did you find this?” Dean asks, slowly flipping through the pages. He looks up at Cas now, his face equal parts surprise and holy fuck, how are you, you and Cas just shrugs.
“No Cas! Stop saying that! Why do you think like that? Cas anyone would be lucky to have you as a date.” Dean said, pacing the floor. Cas was getting a little annoyed at Dean. Why couldn’t he just accept the fact that no one like him and move on? Cas already had. He knows hes awkward and nerdy. Everybody does. Why did Dean always have to insist the otherwise?
Dean pulls into a restaurant that looks decent enough but not too nice. Dean wishes they could afford better but this stolen card is at the end of its road. He wishes Cas and him could have a nice meal for once. Eat something real. He imagines Cas across from him, reading over the menu. Maybe someplace where they put a candle on the table.
"Fuck you, Cas"
He knows the inevitable drop-off will come, when he’s taken it too far, when he freaks Cas out. He thought it might have been just now, but Cas had just laughed. In fact, he’d laughed hard all night. Smiled more. Stood closer. Dean could’ve swore he might have leaned into his touch when he’d wrapped around him at the pool table. He thought he heard Cas’ breath hitch at first. But then he relaxed so slightly, became pliant in Dean’s hand, let himself be touched and guided, and brought his arm to rest against the length of Dean’s. Dean looks over at Cas now but he’s looking out the window, chin resting on his fist, the faintest smile hooked in his lips.
“Oh, shit. Sorry,” Dean says, slipping himself under the covers. He pulls them up and over them. “Should’ve stayed awake. Kept you company.”
“Thank you,” Dean says, after a while. “For coming and getting me, Cas. Thank you, I...I’m sorry...I’m sorry...I’m trying."
“When’s you birthday?” Dean asks, having discovered his curiosity for the subject yesterday, thinking over and over again whether or not Cas had ever mentioned it, and to Dean’s recollection, he hadn’t.
“I didn’t ask you to come." A beat. "I don’t need saving, I can handle my own” Dean says to the passing trees.
It was quick. Tentative. Cas was struck, he couldn’t even begin to think that after all these years Dean could somehow have felt the same.
Cas surveys the table. Dean hopes he’ll see what he sees—sink the seven, put the ball in the corner
? Yes. But never awkward. Cas knew Dean inside out and he never let Dean forget it for a second.
He’s taking forever, he knows. The water’s already gone cold. In the frigid stream, he crosses his arm across his face so he can bite into the skin. He doesn’t think about Cas. Well, he tries not to think about Cas. Tries not to think about his taut skin, how the water kissed his chest, the little tufts of hair peeking out above his jeans. He bites down harder now, suppressing the whimper that’s rising through him. The orgasm rocks through him hard, leaving him weak in its wake. He has to lean against the shower wall, take a few breaths. He turns the shower off.
He laughed into Cas’ shoulder, just barely. “Sorry,” he said, pulling off him and standing. Cas’ hand lingered down Dean’s arms before sliding into his hand as Dean pulled him up. They were standing now, almost flesh, but neither moved. Dean swallowed, Cas’ eyes flicked to his lips. But then Dean’s eyes widened, noticing a drop of blood leaking down from Cas’ hairline.
Cas stands outside Dean’s door. He knocks softly.
“You ready Cas?” Dean asked, from the other room, trying to get dressed in a rush. He was gonna be late to picking Lisa up. Cas wasn’t surprised.
It’s not the first time Dean’s done this. Got wasted at some bar, riled up some biker or some townie, hit on their girlfriend, nagged them into a fight. At first Cas thought it was an accident, a drunken night gone south.
“Here Cas,” Dean says, taking the Polaroid out of Cas’ hands and putting it in Sam’s. “Let him take one of us,” Dean says, coming up next to Cas and putting a hand around his shoulder. Cas leans into the touch and smiles before he hears the click, and the Polaroid ejects the film. Cas grabs it with eager hands, and Dean swears its like Cas is watching a miracle unfold in front of his very eyes as the image begins to form. Dean and Cas are perfectly centered, both smiling and happy, Cas leaning on Dean with a sense of intimacy that wasn’t there with Sam. Cas decides this Polaroid if his favorite possession in his life, next to the journal. Cas hugs Dean and thanks him again and again, claiming he’s “gonna photograph the world” and “it’ll all be because of Dean” and “when he wins an award he’s gonna thank him” and Dean just laughs and nods and smiles, because if Cas is happy, then Dean is happy.  And in that second, that second where Cas just looks at Dean with such gratitude that Dean thinks he’s going to die from unrequited love, he solidifies this moment as one of the happiest of his life.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dean growled.
“Order whatever you like, Cas,” Dean says over his menu. “It’s on me tonight. We’re celebrating.” Cas furrows his brow, gives that Cas look, even tilts his head to the side. Sometimes Cas does it for Dean’s amusement; sometimes he is really that confused.
“And you even got my good side,” Dean says with a chuckle.
shoulders and using a finger to tilt Cas’ chin up before he places his lips on Cas’.  At first, Cas leans back from the kiss, staring Dean in the eyes, utterly
“Well…” Cas said, the open e vowel dripping in booze. “What else is on the list?”
Cas laughs too and raises his chin to look up at Dean. “Yea, me too.”
“Just please..don’t say anything,” Dean says, wringing his hands. “Cas, I…I’m sorry,” Dean said.
“Hey before we go,” Dean says, pulling Cas in, “Just one more.” Cas of course agrees, and what was supposed to be a little peck turns into a full out make-out session. They kissed longer, deeper, and soon enough a rap on the window broke both of them from the haze of shallow breaths and quick heartbeats to the real world. Sam was outside, already turned back to the front door and walking that way.
Dean softly raps on the glass. Cas lets him in and Dean slips in sideways, hand behind his back.
“Sorry about the third wheeling” Dean said, standing up but swaying way too much to be safe. Cas grabbed him to ground him but Dean fell, landing in a heap on Cas.
Tonight, Dean tells himself to behave. He makes it through the break easy, giving Cas pointers from across the table. What he really wants to do is teach Cas right, teach him old fashioned. Get behind him, lean over him, take his hands in his own, and line up the shot. But he keeps his hands to himself. He fiddles with his beer. Picks at the label. Finishes it quickly. He orders another.
, that nobody forced to give up everything but that I did because I wanted to? Why can't you just accept that? Why do you think you don’t deserve to be loved? Every time, you think that the rest of us would all be better if you were dead. I would die tomorrow. I would fucking die tomorrow if you ever pulled something like that. Don’t you ever fucking tell me that I deserve better than what I
“Absolutely not. No fun today. We’re going to put up the tree and I’m going to hate it and you’re going to hate it and we will never celebrate Christmas again,” Dean said, pushing the eggs around in the pan.
“I need you.” Cas snaps back. Dean is kneeling, bloodied eyes pleading to Cas. Pleading for him. Cas hears the drop of the blade before he’s realized he has let it go. He flees.
Cas drifted into the kitchen. Dean knew the smell of bacon would draw him out. It always did.
“What for?” Cas asks, returning to his menu.
“What made you want to make it?”
The floor is hard. The cardboard is doing nothing to stop the chill that’s raking its long fingers up and down Cas bones. His back is throbbing, a dull ache that shoots every time he turns over. He’s turning over a lot. He feels like throwing up but there’s nothing in his stomach; there hasn’t been for three days.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, “what’d you say?” Cas sets his shoulders and stands tall before reciting his demand again, firmer this time.
“Alright, well you two are in charge,” Sam said, standing up to hit the hay. “Which means, Cas, you’re really in charge.”
“I gave everything for you. I sacrificed Heaven, my grace!” Cas was starting to yell, anger pulsing through him all the way to the tips of his fingerprints. “I fell for you, I killed so you could live, I died for you.” Tears were creeping in at the edges of Cas’ eyes now, but he couldn’t stop himself. His mouth was speaking from his heart, direct line. “I did all of that for you!”
“My dads out of town and there’s a handle of vodka in the cabinet. So get comfortable kids, because were about to get wasted.” Dean said, running to the bathroom. Cas simply laughed and sat down on the couch, loosening up his tie. Lisa sat down next to Cas, taking off her heels.
“How long did this take you?”
"Dean is something agitating you, you seem on edge." Cas asks, letting the suspect loose. It was a dead end anyways.
“Cas stop sneaking around, Jesus,” Dean said, brushing past. “And come sit down.”
"I can work with that," Cas says, before going in for Dean’s lips.
"10, 15 minutes tops" Dean says, a smile sliding onto his face.
“Come on,” Dean says, regaining his composure. “Round two. Rematch.” Cas chuckles and follows him in.
“Well now you’re not, and you’re human, so were gonna celebrate your birthday.” Dean says, grinning at the thought of Cas in a party hat. Maybe he’d get him a lap dance for his birthday. Actually, maybe he wouldn’t. Dean would never admit it to anyone, but jealousy can get the best of him. Especially when it comes to Cas. That also something he’d never tell anyone. He’s completely and irreversibly in love with Cas, but, well, that’s not the point.
, and he turns and goes. Cas pushes his thumb into the bruise on his thigh.
After 10 minutes, Castiel is satisfied by his answer.
“Dean,” Cas whispered, rooting his hand into Dean’s hair.
Cas leans over.
Their steps were heavy to the door, sand scattering out of laces across the pavement. Dean could feel a sunburn creeping across his neck from their afternoon spent out in the desert boonies. Normally they didn’t take chupacabra cases; they were light work for local hunters. But this one was particularly nasty. It’d caught a drunk girl wandering off from a campfire. Her friends found her before she bled out, luckily, but they rarely attack humans. Alas, enter Dean and Cas. They’d found its den, shanked the damn thing, and still had time for dinner.
Dean speaks first. “I just…” He says, putting the plate down into the sink, placing his hands on the counter’s rim. He glances at Cas, who’s staring down. They both staring down.
Dean was fighting for him. In both senses. He fought those guys for Cas’ sake, so Cas wouldn't have to (not that he ever would have) and for space in a world where Cas and him could exist. The two of them. Without remarks, snides, jeers. Bit by bit, Dean was carving out a chunk of existence for them, together. In the bunker’s backyard, with the greenhouse. In the bunker too, when he set up a spare room for Cas just down the hall from his. He had helped Cas furnish it too, took him to IKEA, built the bed for Cas while Cas helped. Gave him a lamp he’d “found in a closet” but that was really his own. He did it tonight too, in the bar, taking on three guys for nothing. But it wasn’t nothing. He was fighting tooth and nail against any and every indication that Cas couldn’t stay right by his side, couldn’t exist in his orbit, that they couldn’t continue to brush hands and trade looks and just be.
“Cas.” Dean said, trying to get his attention. “Cas!”
“Okay well before you start, what do you do?” Dean says, quizzing Cas as to make sure they aren’t going to crash within the first three seconds Cas is behind the wheel.
Cas knew that was coming. He sat back down on the couch, starting to regret everything about this night. Once again he’d made it all about himself. God, why did he have to be such an assho-
After a guilty second round in the backseat, (and no, Dean did not whisper ‘fuck i love you so much’ into the nape of Cas’ neck as he teetered on the edge of blacking out from pure pleasure) they make it back to the room before sundown.
“Why didn’t we do that sooner,” Dean says through a small chuckle.
“Sorry, dude, I don’t make the rules” Dean shouted to an already gone Cas.
“They were too pricey and they were ugly too, come on, we’ve still got to grocery shop so stop dilly-dallying,” Dean said, pushing open the door. Sam just rolled his eyes; he didn’t have the energy left to fight.
“Hmmm,” Cas says, eyes sweeping upwards. “Well, I’d think I’d like to be more compassionate. Be more open minded. Perhaps more patient.”
“What,” Dean replied, slowly filling the machine. It was less of a question than a statement.
“I’ll get the broom. Again” Cas mocked, shaking his head.
They turn to Dean, who has fallen silent, the gift laying partially unwrapped in his lap. He finally speaks but all he says is “Cas”, very softly. He holds up the original signed copy of Slaughterhouse Five, delicate in opening the cover. Cas doesn’t even try to hide his smile.
And Dean was kissing him.
“You are such boys. Both of you” Lisa said, standing up to get a glass of water.
That night they fall asleep together, curled up in a tangle of limbs. Cas’ head is resting on Dean’s chest and Dean falls asleep to the sound of Cas’ light snoring.For once it's perfect for Dean, and he falls asleep happy.
A couple minutes later Dean appeared and shit, if Cas didn’t already regret his decision to attend Prom, he definitely did now. Dean cleaned up nice, incredibly nice, and suddenly Cas’ pants were a litter tighter. Fuck, this was gonna be a long night.
“I’m sorry for ignoring you. For acting like a total dick.” he says, smoothing down his jeans. He still can’t meet Cas’ eyes. “For, you know...” Dean trails off.
“I don’t know, maybe an hour?” Cas says, nuzzling his nose into Dean’s chest. Dean starts peeling Cas’ big jacket off, big hands making quick work. Cas settles back in, feels Dean’s heartbeat against his cheek.
“Hi,” Cas says, placing down the pot. Cas is seated on the floor, surrounded by scattered dirt and bits of leaves. He takes off his gloves. He has a smear of dirt across his cheek. Dean resists the urge to wipe it away.
“Do—you—know—how—long—I’ve—waited—to—kiss—you” Cas gets out in between each kiss.
Cas just stares at him.
"Yea sorry we got held up," Dean said, rubbing the back of his neck and trying to not sound like Cas had just had him slurring profanities in the backseat of his car not 10 minutes ago.
“God, you’re a fucking piece of work, you know that?”
“Fine. But breakfast better be more than amazing,” Cas said, slowly sliding out of bed to Dean’s relief. Dean left him alone to shower and change and then it was time for presents and breakfast.
Lifted the sheets higher over Dean when the stupid A/C kicked in, drafting frigid air across the room. Almost tasted the sun as it danced across Dean’s neck, licking little sandy blonde hairs into fiery spires.
“Doesn’t mean it isn’t true,” Dean said, looking up at Cas.
“Okay so before we start,” Dean says, “I’m going to tell you the basics.”
“Get in the car I’ll meet you out there!” Dean yelled, rushing across the living room to a Sammy’s room.
This was immaculate beauty. This was divinity made flesh. This was lightness and grace and strength and it was blinding Castiel. It was Dean Winchester’s soul, laid bare in his hands, pure energy that pulsed at the borders of his consciousness, threatening to consume him. It was powerful and raw, it was enveloping and nurturing. It shimmered like blinding rays of midday sun, like heat on desert sand. It was cosmic, expanding into the depths of Castiel’s being bearing glimmering light. It was whole again.
His eyes flicker to the TV. Now he’s
“I said ‘Me’, Cas” Dean replied, sitting down on the opposite side of the couch.  Cas drunk head was hurting, trying to figure out how he must have heard that wrong.
“Fine,” Cas says, letting Dean drag him along. “But you’re buying,” he adds, grinning. Dean scoffs and holds open the door.
“Uh oh.” Dean says, pulling back his head from Cas’. “What about?”
“Lower. You’ll have to hit it from the outside.” He drags Cas’ hand over slightly, lowers his elbow an inch. Cas lets him guide him, doesn’t recoil from Dean’s touch but leans into it. “Now.”
"I like this," Cas replies, a shit-eating grain plastered on his face, "it suits you"
“God Cas, what are you the Grinch? Lighten up,” Dean said, poking him in the shoulder, grinning.
“Hello, Mrs. Novak?” Dean said, knowing now he had Cas’ full attention.
I am dying without you.
Cas unwraps the gift and doesn’t smile, but gives a look of confusion more than excitement.
“Hmmm? Oh” Dean says, rubbing his eyes and then his arms. Damn, it was cold. He gets out, stretches his limbs.
About a month later, Cas and Dean are coming back from a hunt they completed, driving down the road with Led Zeppilin playing lightly through the speakers. Cas is reading Catch-22 in the passenger seat, while Dean simply drives and hums along to the familiar tune. Cas looks up for a minute when he suddenly spots a field of orange coming up ahead between the trees. He demands Dean pull over, and Dean complies, with a little confusion but overall carefree attitude. Once the car stops, Cas jumps out and runs to the trunk to grab his Polaroid. He runs past the trees and finds himself greeted by a field of orange poppies. They grow in every direction outward, and over the rolling hill in the distance. Cas felt the need to stop and just take in the scenery, too beautiful of a moment to pass up. Soon Dean catches up with him and just stands next to him in silence, admiring the view as much as he is admiring Castiel. Not sexually, because in stolen glances Dean gets enough of that, (well if it was Dean’s choice he’d had a lot more), but in a loving way. Cas seems just so at peace to Dean, the wind lightly blowing his hair and ruffling the expanse of Poppies that lay for seemingly endless miles ahead of then. It’s right then Dean decides he’s going to tell Cas he loves him. He doesn’t know how, when, or whether it’s even a good decision, but damnit Dean’s waited long enough and if he doesn’t tell someone he’s going to die a thousand deaths.  The sound of the Polaroid brings him out of his daze as Cas takes a shot of the field, waits a little, then plucks the film from the camera. They stand quietly and watch it develop right there, and when it does, Cas simply puts it in his pockets and smiles. It subtle, but it’s there. Dean puts his arm around Cas’ shoulder and directs him back to the car, hating to leave the view but knowing they should return to Sam. Cas agrees and heads back to the car, but not before demanding he get one of Dean and the Impala in front of the field. Dean tries to get out of it, hating the idea of being put on display like a model for a photo shoot, but does it anyway because it seems important to Cas. Cas directs Dean where to stand and to smile, and Dean does stand where Castiel places him, but the smiling is a little more difficult. It feels to fake for Dean; too rehearsed.
Dean is pushing Cas out of the bathroom now and they’re stumbling backwards, landing on the bed in a soft
“Oh Cas shit I-“ Dean says, unable to fully speak.
-------------
“Sure Cas, why not.” Dean replies, taking a swig of beer.
“I thought there'd be more,” Cas said, lifting his hands towards the fire. He settled deeper into the couch. His knee brushed against Dean’s more fully, settled against his. Dean wrapped his arms around a pillow to still them. His hands were begging to reach forward, run themselves under and up Cas’ shirt, dig through his hair. The fire popped, snapping him back.
Dean wanted to talk to him. He did. He had a million things to say and a million things to regret. How do you say:
“What are you thinking?” Cas says, quietly, breaking the din of the motel’s A/C.
“Oh shit, haha sorry” Dean said putting his hands on Cas chest to help push himself up. He lingered for a second, but then made his way back over to the other side of the couch. Cas noticed but blamed it on the alcohol pulsing through Dean’s veins.
“Don’t do this to me Dean. Don’t fuck with me like this,” Cas said putting his head in his hands. Why Dean would think that pretending to actually romantically like him made him want to punch him square in the jaw. In fact, Cas planned on it. He turned to look at Dean before he swung, but Dean was 3 inches from his face.
“I…” Dean says, feeling awkward now that he’s standing above Cas. He sits down beside him, close but not close enough for Cas to reach. Cas wants to but Dean is so cagey, so flighty that he thinks if he even breathes the wrong way Dean will bolt. So he doesn’t say anything.
“Stop this.”
“Come on Cas just take the fucking picture I feel like a damn fool,” Dean whines.
In the car Dean’s adrenaline is still blazing through his veins. He’s wringing his hands on the steering wheel and gritting his teeth. His breaths are coming out deep and low.
“I’m sorry about the orchid,” he says. He is sorry; it’s completely crushed. Well, not that sorry. Collateral damage. Friendly fire.
“ Cas, you have to have some! That’s like, rule number one.”
when he hears the snicker. It’s followed by a jibe Dean doesn’t fully hear but instinctively recognizes. It slices a knife through his stomach, His shoulders tense but he doesn’t turn around. He doesn’t want to give them the satisfaction of rousing a reaction. He just slowly scans the bar, ignoring Cas’ question until he spots them, standing a couple tables over. There’s three of them, maybe mid 30’s, already worse for wear, each more drunk than the last. Cas looks over Dean’s shoulder until he spots them. The bikers from before. The way Dean had stilled, eyes glazing dark; Cas immediately knew something was off.
“Well then let’s fix that. Pick a date. Any one Cas. Doesn’t matter.” Dean says, already plotting about gifts and coordinating with Sam about the cake and other celebratory customs.
I have wanted to kiss you every day since I met you.
“Okay so when you start the car, which you do by putting the keys in the ignition, you always have your foot on the brake. Okay, Cas?” Dean says, hoping to get a nod or reply from Cas. Cas nods, and Dean continues.
“Dean?”
“....Personal space,” Cas had said, his mouth teasing up into a grin. Dean blurted out a laugh, his head falling forward to rest on Cas’ shoulder.
“Alright, let’s go eat.”
“Okay my turn,” Dean says, handing Cas his gift, a giant smile already breaking out on his face at the thought of Cas loving something Dean bought for him.
He must have. An alarm sounded somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind but he tried to ignore it. Tried to relax.
“What? I’m not."
Wait, fuck. Dean thinks. Cas kissed him. Cas kissed him. First. Dean’s realization brought him to the fact that maybe Cas liked him back and before Dean knew what he was doing he pulled him back and crashed his lips on Cas’. They’re lips began sliding in rhythm easily, their breaths becoming short and shallow. It was hot and heady, and Dean felt like he was drowning. And in the best way possible. Cas’ tongue began to find it’s way into Dean’s mouth, and vice versa. They were kissing hard and Cas was pushing back into Dean, and Dean met his movements, becoming flush onto the driver door while Cas crawled onto his lap. Unknowingly, Cas elbow came to rest on the horn and-
What he found was a group of kids smoking who knows what, so he left. He was running out of places to hide. Plus, Dean was probably wondering where he was.
Dean smiles, rubbing his hand along the back of his neck. “Do you like it?”
“Fine, you’re right….Tomorrow, then. Tomorrow morning!” Dean said, cranking up the heat.
Cas stopped. “Have...have you been drinking?” he asked, crossing his arms.
“God Cas, you are killing me!” Dean said, scrunching his fingers across his temple. “Just….get dressed for the cold and meet me back here in five.”
“We should probably head back, Sam should be making dinner by now.” Dean says, waiting for Cas to turn the car off.
A prayer.
“Cas, buddy, you can't stay.”
Cas is watching a police rerun Dean’s sure he’s already seen when he steps out. He’s changed now, out of his dirty clothes and into jeans and a t-shirt. It’s bizarre seeing Cas casual sometimes. Dean knows he can’t wear the trench coat everywhere, especially trudging through the desert, but seeing Cas in jeans and tee just seems,
Cas glances over but Dean won’t meet his gaze. Just stares farther out into the trees. Cas sighs.
" But every time they went Dean had a list, checked it off, and bought (mostly) the right things. They had started building it in a clearing behind the bunker, digging holes for cement foundations and lining up the standing posts. It was only halfway through, since they kept getting sidetracked with hunts, but Dean seemed determined to finish and Cas was grateful for the help. He promised Dean he would cook him a huge dinner of vegetable stew in the spring. Dean had smiled, said he would like that, clapped Cas on the back with a dirt-ridden glove and left a big hand print there.
“No I’m not you’re fucking babysitter, Dean. Because unlike a babysitter, I’m not getting paid to take care of you.”
“What if I told you I loved you?” Cas said, completely serious but quietly. Dean didn’t think he’d heard him right. If Cas was being serious, even though Dean didn’t think he was, then Dean didn’t know what to say.
“Earth to Cas. You done?” Dean asks, looking at Cas’ plate. Cas realizes he’d drifted off a little. “Yes, sorry, go ahead.” Dean pulls the plate over and eats a little off it.
“Cas that isn’t funny.” Dean says, trying to blow off what Cas said in case Cas was just joking.
“Dean, they’re all great choices,” Sam said with a sigh. They’d been inside the store for over twenty minutes, some little boutique downtown that Dean had always walked right past on the way to the grocery store. He was supposed to be grocery shopping with Sam, but he just wanted to see if they had anything after catching a glimpse of a mannequin with a deep blue sweater. He was trying to pick something out for Cas but Sam was ruining it. Not only because he was there, which made Dean feel self-conscious that he was in a boutique anyways —let alone buying something for Cas—but also because he had no opinions. Not that Dean wanted them anyways.
“I’m sorry, Cas, I wasn’t thinking...” Dean trailed off.
Dean comes outside and finds Cas sitting shotgun in his car. The thing was a wreck, and Dean was not about to let Cas learn to drive with some shabby pimp ride. He pulled open the driver door and stuck his head in.
Dean claps him on the back,
“Oh shut up and just open the damn thing,” Dean says, “before I take it back.” Cas pulls the gift away from Dean, fake-shielding it. He slowly unpeels the wrapping paper—just to tease Dean, he knows—and flicks open the cardboard box.
“I’m not sneaking around,” Cas said, taking a seat beside him, “but if I was, I don’t imagine you would realize.”
Their ties end up on the floor, with the rest of their clothes. It isn’t ‘till later when Cas is picking them up before Sam comes back that he takes a second to look at the tie Dean was wearing.
“Jesus Cas, that’s not Christmas, that's Bible Camp,” Dean snorted. “You guys didn’t do anything fun? Give gifts? Get hammered?”
--------
“Final answer?” Dean asks with a grin.
. Then there was a second. A third. By the fourth, it was clear. They were a punishment. A punishment Dean incited on himself when he couldn’t find the words to say sorry. An equalizer for all the fuck ups, all the people he’d let die, a punch for for every one he couldn’t save. Sometimes he punched back, murmured lost names between swings. Others were spoken out in the crack of a jaw, the slap of skin on skin. The snap of a rib, when Dean had gone too far.
"This a new tie?" Sam asks, pinching it between his fingers.
“Look, Cas, if you’re gonna preach to me, save it,” Dean says, the words ringing out harsh—harsher than he’d intended.
“I ain’t playing no pool,” the larger one says, “and I ain’t playing with no fucking faggots.” He’s stepped up now to stand next to the shorter one. He’s got a few inches on Dean but Dean doesn’t waver, only furthers his shit-eating grin. He’s fought off a hell of a lot worse than three bikers. And won, too.
sat right next to him; he remembers the brush of Cas’ thigh against his own. Remembers when Cas hadn’t retreated from the touch, just let the electricity dance between their skin. That is,
“Fine.” Dean said, reaching into his pocket to pull out his phone.  Cas eyed him with a look of confusion and apathy, unable to fathom how his phone would ever make Cas go to Prom. He turned back to the TV.
. But Dean was a great teacher—when he wasn’t busy watching. He watches Cas bite his tongue before each shot. Watches his hands rack the balls. He usually tries to not to peek when Cas bends over, leaning across the table, ass backing out but other times, Dean can’t resist. When he was being good he stood to the side, watching each of Cas’ biceps tense. Cas, on the other hand, was less cognizant of personal space, always standing just a hair too close. If it was anyone but Cas, Dean would’ve elbowed them off. But Cas was oblivious. And warm. And Cas.
“Yes, this year has gone by “fast”” Cas remarks, opening his book. Dean can hear the air quotes.
“Hurry up, Sam is waiting.” Dean shoos Cas out of his room, hand on the small of his back.
“So the socks...” Cas says, teasing him.
“You know I don’t understand what that means,” Cas said, shooting Dean a look. Dean just rubbed his shoulder, grinning harder.
“So we going out tonight or what?” Dean asks, running a hand through his damp hair. Now it’s his turn to feel exposed, the towel slung low across his hips. He tries to act casual, tries not to shy away when Cas turns to look at him, catalogs when Cas’ gaze lingers just a second longer, just a flash downwards.
“So you won’t be mad….if I have it then...since it’s not yours,” Cas said, bringing the glass up to his lips.
“You can’t be serious” Dean said, after Cas dropped what was apparently a bomb to Dean: he wasn’t going to Prom.
Dean goes pale.
“Dean this is incredible. I don’t know what to say,” Cas says, dropping the blade to wrap his arms around Dean. Dean oofs, but then wraps his arms around Cas for the hug. Dean can smell Cas from the crown of his head, patchouli and dirt. Cas pulls back.
“Dean. Stop.” Cas says, catching up and grabbing his shoulder.
Dean lifted his head from where it’d been resting on the couch. “I don’t know, uhh, we have to make a snowman, and uhhhh, go caroling and then...uhh” Dean rubbed his eyes. Those five—six?—old fashioneds had really snuck up on him.
“So...” Cas said, grinning. “What’s in eggnog anyways?”
They took the drive back slow, careful not to send the tree flying off the Impala’s roof. Dean complained the entire time that Cas was going to be responsible for cleaning the sap of the car’s roof but Cas could see through the front. Between complaints Dean was beaming; he had been since they’d gotten to the lot.
“Says who? Dances are dumb. No one asked me, and besides I already rented a documentary.” Cas said. Dean blew out a breath of air and ran his hands through his hair.
“You don’t have another car, but I do,” Dean says on his way to the Impala. He slides his fingers across the back before giving it a light bump with his fist.
“It’s okay, I didn’t mind. The radio was nice. Let me think for a while” Cas says. Dean’s legs intertwine with Cas; Dean hisses when he meets Cas’ freezing feet. The abominable Cas-man, as Dean calls him. Cas is still trying to figure that one out.
The blade is familiar in Cas’ hand. It almost throbs in his fist, singing for flesh.
Dean knew the answer before he even thought of the question. No, Cas wouldn’t have, because Sam wouldn’t have fallen asleep on Cas in the first place. But maybe, Cas wouldn’t have sat so close to Sam that he could have. Cas
“Dean,” Cas says, standing. His tone stops Dean, pausing him with his hand on the door handle, having turned it just slightly. Dean braced for impact, braced for the yelling, braced for the storm of Cas’ anger, for the telling off, for the guilt to bear down on him, to crush him into darkness.
“Don’t do this, Cas.”
“Fine, see you in 10” Cas said, making a show of very slowly backing off. Dean groaned.
“Why what?”
Sam unwraps his scarf and holds it up, letting it cascade down from his hands.
Now Cas’ eyes widen, fear splashing across his face. “Is—” but Dean cuts him off, mouth crashing against his, hands cupping Cas’ face. The force of Dean’s kiss pushes Cas back and they stumble, Cas’ foot sending the pot skittering across the floor. Dirt spills everywhere and Dean narrowly sidesteps an orchid bloom but they don’t care. Not when Dean’s body is pressing Cas against the greenhouse wall. Cas sighs into Dean and Dean wraps his arm low around Cas’ waist, pulling them closer. Dean travels down Cas’ neck and Cas moans a “Dean”, sending Dean into overdrive.
But Cas cannot shake Dean’s coarse edges, the bits that snag Cas’ skin, cut him in passing. Wounds that he will pick at. Pick at if only to test that they still hurt. “Cas, buddy, You can’t stay.” A betrayal. A miscommunication. The refusal not to understand. Eyes that do not meet. Hands that flex at Dean’s side, hands that shake Cas, knuckles kissed before they make contact with Cas’ jaw. A week without speaking. Bristling tension, skin that burns at the touch, a pot boiling over in the kitchen, a fight in the bunker’s living room. Thoughts made manifest into words, words that should have stayed thoughts. A lie. An omission of truth. Landmines hidden in plain sight, self-fulfilling prophecies, traps Dean sets so they can be sprung. The same wound tearing open and open again although it bled dry years ago, but the pain is somehow always a surprise. Always fresh.
“ENOUGH! Enough, Dean!” Cas barks. “Enough.”
“Oh Come one Cas just take the damn gift,” Dean says, just wanting to give Cas his present.
Cas rifles through his toiletry bag, finding his toothbrush. He steps into the bathroom and in a moment Dean joins him, toothbrush in hand. The bathroom is tiny, barely bigger than a large closet. Dean could easily wait, Cas thinks, but he isn’t. Instead he’s jostling around the sink, trying to wet his brush and bumping shoulders with Cas. Cas finishes brushing his teeth. He doesn’t actually need to, being an angel. But Dean had never stopped hanging Cas his toothpaste when he was human and Cas just never stopped taking it. So, every night. Cas brushed his teeth.
Sam ate breakfast alone. Dean didn’t come out of his room until midday, just to grab toast, and then disappeared until dinner. Cas was in the greenhouse until the sun set, but when Sam passed he was only sitting, staring at a dying orchid. He raised his hands to lift the wilting bloom, letting it fall again. Sam knocked and waved and Cas’ faked a smile and Sam held up a thumbs up in question. Cas shrugged, pointing at the orchid. Sam nodded and continued down the hall.
He leaned back in and then they were kissing rough, Dean reaching up to thread his hands through Cas hair. Cas sat forward and placed a hand on Dean’s chest. Dean only leaned in harder, crushing Cas’ lips with his own. The smell and taste of Vodka reminded Cas this was all so fragile, only the next morning would let Cas know if any of this was anything at all, or simply Dean letting off steam he lost when he blew his chance with Lisa.
“Well we don’t have snow, yet,” Cas said, rubbing his hands out towards the fire. “Anything we’re missing?” He added, turning to Dean.
Dean’s standing at the sink, boxing Cas in so he just waits. He leans against the back wall, crossing his arms. They’re touching from their feet to just below the hip, yet neither of them moves. Since Cas brushed first, Dean motions to Cas for the toothpaste silently, his brush is in his mouth. Cas goes to hand it to him but when Dean reaches out, Cas pulls it back at the last second. Dean reaches for it but Cas moves it at again, eyebrow cocked up in challenge. Dean rolls his eyes but lunges again and now Cas has lifted it to the ceiling, dangling it by it’s edge. Dean leans a hand on the sink and presses up against Cas to reach upwards. His body pushes flush against Cas’ as he struggles to grab it out of Cas’ hand. Cas wraps his fingers around the tube and stops dangling it, lowering his chin down from where he’s been looking at it to stare Dean squarely in the face. Dean stops his little jumps now, seeing Cas isn’t giving it up anytime soon, and looks down. Their faces are barely an inch apart. Cas’ breath licks across Dean’s lips. Dean’s eyes flicker down to Cas’ mouth. Cas licks his lips and Dean’s pupils flash wide, the toothbrush going slack in his mouth. Cas reaches up, slowly pulling it out of Dean’s mouth. Cas kisses Dean.
“It’s a Polaroid Cas.” Dean explains, hoping Cas will understand how amazing Dean’s gift is once he recognizes what it is.
“Uhh...sometimes you hang mistletoe,” Dean said, licking his lips. He watched Cas watch him, watched his eyes flicker down again. Dean, stop. But Dean was in the backseat now. Drunk Dean steering the boat, flying the plane. He hoped it wouldn’t crash land.
I love you. I’m scared.
Cas turns and leaves, heading back to his room. He tried to make burgers for Dean; a stupid apology that’s so little compared to how fucked up his fuck-up was that it was borderline insulting. He can’t stand the silence, Dean’s silence. It was like a bore drilling him between his eyes, a pain he was forcing himself to bear because of course, Dean had every right to be upset. He spends the rest of the night in his room sitting on his bed in the dark, hand over his mouth so he doesn’t scream, rocking back and forth. He's punching his thigh with a balled fist, though he doesn't notice. A bruise will form, dark and blotchy. It blooms against the pallor of his skin, rising to the surface, as if the blood was leaking out from the inside, from internal wounds. It hurts but not enough, never lessening the nerve-decay settled deep between his ribs.
Sooner than later November 23rd rolled around and Cas woke up to a very elated Dean screaming “Happy Birthday!” to him at 7 in the morning. Dean jumped on Cas bed and attempted to pull the pillow Cas had wrapped around his head off.
I need to kiss you again.
They’re both exhausted and they know it, shuffling quietly through the room with heavy feet. Dean is taking off his boots on the edge of the bed, rubbing the bottom of his feet.
“How long?” Dean says, so quietly Cas almost misses it. Cas looks back at him now, a seriousness settling in his gaze. He pushes himself up on Dean’s chest a little.
That was another thing. Going to prom wasn’t just a nightmare because he was third-wheeling, it was a nightmare because somehow along there 6-going-on-7-year friendship, Cas had wound up in love with Dean. Dean didn’t know, nor would he ever, but seeing Dean in a suit and the idea of Prom filled his stomach with lead. He wished it were himself in the front seat, not an empty space that Lisa would soon take. He wanted nothing more than for Dean to have showed up one night with flowers and a sign that said “Prom?” but instead every night he was met with only a chorus of crickets. Cas had adjusted though. Made peace with it. But that didn’t make it any easier.
“You, shut up. And yes, we’re baking. Some of us don’t actually hate Christmas unlike some people....Did Santa touch you Sam, is that it? Is that why you hate Christmas?” Dean asked, crossing his arms.
The blade is home now in his fist. He does not hesitate.
“Happy New Year,” Dean says, pulling Cas in.
Please be patient with me. I know I’m fucked up and I will probably screw this up and hurt you and I don’t want to do that. Please don’t let me do that.
When he’s gone, Dean collapses into Cas’ bed, exhausted but also relieved. Fuck, that was so close.
Cas flips the leather journal open, hands skimming across the blank pages. “It’s beautiful Sam, thank you. Really.” Dean reaches out and Cas hands it to him, standing now to gather his gifts from under the tree.
—but when it doesn’t shake the second week, it’s all very real to Dean, who brings Cas tea without being asked and secretly searches online for kittens to adopt.
Breakfast was great, they mostly chatted about small stuff, but soon Dean was getting more and more eager to open presents, hoping-no, knowing Cas would love his present.
The game is going well. Cas has gotten somewhat better, even if he pretends he hasn’t. He can sink a given shot. But he isn’t thinking ahead, isn’t picturing the end-placement of the cue.
They spend the rest of the day lounging around. Dean throws on Die Hard—”Die Hard is a Christmas movie, Sam”—but they’re only half watching. Dean sneaks a kiss with Cas in the kitchen while Sam’s passed out in the living room later in the evening and Dean rides that high until the sun comes down. He finds Cas later in the greenhouse, trying to nurse the crushed orchid back to the land of the living.
. Because they’d seen Dean and Cas together and assumed. And Dean had reacted, fought back, risked getting his ass beat for an assumption. For what three washed up, drunk bikers thought in a dive bar ten states away from their home.
“So, presents?” Sam asks, breaking the silence of their communal lethargy. He gets up and grabs his present out from under the tree, handing them to Cas and Dean. Dean rips the wrapping paper off and but Cas peels off the tap, unfolding each plane of the wrapping.
Cas doesn’t know what to say. He had so many words to explain what he was thinking in teaming with Crowley, so many sentences that made sense, motivations that were pure. They were pure once but they soiled, ran rancid, rotted in the distance between then and now. They fail him as he stands there. Like he failed Dean. Another apology would only drive the knife deeper, anger Dean until the plate was flying at the wall and shattering, porcelain shards scattering across the tile—a mocking applause. Cas would bend to pick them up and Dean would yell something like “You’re not the fucking maid! Just go.” and Cas would go and lock himself in his room again and turn off the lights and wait.
“It’s so you can record anything you like. Journal entries, dreams, goals, whatever” Sam explains. Cas’ face immediately lights up with his understanding of the journal, hugging Sam fully and opening it up to flip through the blank white pages. Dean feels a pang of jealousy strike him, a little disappointed he didn’t think of it.
“Tell me you would have said ‘Yes’” Dean said incredibly close to Cas.  “Tell me if I asked you to Prom you would have said Yes,” Dean repeated, a pleading look in his eyes.
Soon it’s over, and Cas is just about passed out in the backseat from exhaustion. Dean decides to drive, not wanting to leave Sammy alone in the hotel room since they promised they’d be back for dinner.
“Dean what if I crash it?” Cas asks, already feeling sick at the thought of ruining something Dean holds so close to his heart.
“Alright let’s go I don’t want to keep Sam waiting,” Cas says, leaving Dean to slide towards the passenger door. Dean agrees with a little bit of defeat in his voice.
The blade is heavy. Fingers feeling cold, metal feeling warm. It is still in his grip. It does not vibrate like before.
“Hey,” is all he starts with. Cas looks up from the plant he’s potting, surprised widening in his eyes. Dean hates himself immediately, hates every second he spent ignoring Cas, hates that he kissed him, hates that he hates that he kissed him. Hates that he never kissed him years ago.
“Alright, let’s bounce,” Dean says, shuffling out of the seat. He pays at the counter and they head out. Cas starts towards the car but Dean grabs him, dragging him across the street. “Dean,” Cas moans, “what now?”
“Dean,” Cas says again.
--------------
“Just shut up and watch what happens you doofus.” Dean says, handing Cas the Polaroid. Soon enough the image of Cas with a very confused and slightly scared expression forms alongside Sam’s smile. Cas eyes widen at his realization of the capabilities of Dean’s gift. He watches the image fully form in complete silence, Sam giving Dean a look like he’s insane because he’s smiling so wide and Dean only smiles wider at that, even if he didn’t think being happier than he already was could be possible.
And Cas is just as happy to reciprocate.
“Seems like someone’s in a good mood,” Dean said.
“Dean it’s late,” Cas said, checking the time.
“Nah, it just, it just has character, that’s all,” Dean said, rubbing his hand across his jaw. He leaned forward to adjust an ornament that hung on a weak branch, pulling the small twig down with its weight. As soon as he touched the branch the ornament slipped off, shattering on the ground.
“What if I make you smile?” Cas says, taunting Dean.
“Please—”
“Come on, Cas, it’s New Year’s Eve! That was just dinner,” Cas sighs but eventually gives in to Dean’s pull. Dean was really in a mood now—he was rarely this excited, especially after a long day in the grueling heat. He was usually dead in the motel, three beers in, face down in the bed, clothes still on.
“Nothing, Sammy,” Dean said, pulling out another sweater. He set it down, looking around the store. “Let’s just go,” Dean said, pushing past him.
Soon the night was over, and they were on their way back to Dean’s house.
“Stop whining. How are you going to get good if you don’t play? I’ll teach you, come on,” Dean says. His hand pushes at the small of Cas’ back and Cas caves in, stops dragging his feet.
“Indeed,” Cas replies.
Every molecule in Dean threatens to split. He’s silent for a while.
“After dinner please. I’m hungry,” Cas replies. Dean kisses the crown of his head, running his hands through his hair.
“Shhh,” Dean said, his left hand rubbing up and down Cas back. The skin was taut under his shirt, hard muscle meeting smooth skin as Dean slipped his hand under the hem. He ran his nails down Cas’ back and Cas arched, exposing more of his neck to Dean.
Dean soon returned to Cas’ lips, and smiled into the kiss. Cas broke it off to look at Dean, a pair of green eyes meeting his in the darkness. Cas decided that if Dean was being serious, then they could wait till morning. He didn’t want to rush this. Plus, if Dean wasn’t being serious, then taking it too far could mean their friendship was at stake, and that was too important to Cas to lose over making out drunk.
“Well Mr. New Year’s Eve, what are your resolutions then?” Dean asks, pulling down Cas’ menu with the tip of his finger. Cas reads the menu all the way down to the table, fascinated by the "nacho-quesso-rrito".
“Great? I know,” Dean says, pulling open a chair. Sam is already sitting down, reading the paper. He shoots Cas a look of sympathy.
The punch bowl was full when Cas arrived, grabbing himself a plastic cup and pouring the dark red sugar water into it. He then scanned the crowd, looking for any familiar face that would provide an escape route of this hell via conversation. He saw no one but Dean and Lisa, who looked like they were having the time of their life. Hell, they probably were.
“What do you do with mistytoll?” Cas replied, his hand now rested on Dean’s thigh, inching across a line.
“Hey baby,” Dean said snapping Cas out of his thoughts. Lisa climbed into the Impala, looking absolutely amazing, before giving Cas a wave. Cas nodded and smiled weakly, and she turned back to Dean. Dean smiled at her and then drove off, whether to their high school or Hell Cas couldn’t tell anymore. At this point though, they were the same thing.
“You are not leaving Cas. I know you lying. Now stop being such a pity party and dance.” Dean said, pulling Cas onto the dance floor.
“Can I at least have coffee first?” Cas grumbles, crossing his arms.
You’re my best friend and I’m sorry I crossed that line.
“Okay. I...I already ate. I set out a plate for you.” Another beat of silence. And another.
Okay, so Cas just had to tell Dean he wasn’t feeling well, and that he was going home. Problem solved.
Cas pulls into the motel parking lot, his beams illuminating the flash of a cat as it scurries off. He shakes Dean’s shoulder lightly, stirring him awake.
“What time is it?” Cas asked, rubbing his eyes.
“I guess I just lost track of time,” Dean says, crossing the lot towards their room’s door. New Year’s Eve must explain the motel’s business; they only had a single with a queen.
“No, not like that.” Cas said, pulling Dean’s arms around him tighter. “Just thinking about us. About you. How much I love you” he says, burning his nose in Dean’s chest. The words don't sting like they used to. Dean does not recoil, does not wince, does not fight Cas and himself. Instead he pulls Cas closer, hand nudging Cas’ jaw upwards and now they’re kissing. It’s short and soft, Dean’s thumb rubbing along Cas’ jaw. His other hand sweeps up Cas' back, palm splayed. Cas leans harder into Dean, pushing himself flush against all that he is, all that is holding the edges of Cas’ existence into place, shielding him from everything beyond the space between them now. Dean pythons his arms around Cas, pulls him on top of him, runs a hand down to the small of his back. Dean’s tongue skims Cas’ bottom lip, Cas teases back, Dean opens the kiss. It’s slow and lazy, sleep winking in at the corners. Dean breaks off to run kisses down Cas’ neck, circling back to press one to his forehead. Cas collapses back onto Dean, runs his arms up around his neck, one slipping under a pillow.
“I spent all night looking for you. I drove up and down this shit fucking town looking for you.”
“God, you are so infuriating. Did you ever stop to think maybe I fucking wanted this? That I want to be here, that I want to be with
see this though,  and only says a quiet “never mind forget the picture” and starts in the direction of the car. Dean quickly catches up to Cas, grabbing his
But it fell away at night. It slipped away in lying down, in hearing Dean’s breath ebb and flow like the lapping tide. He hated his body until Dean touched it, until electricity danced in the wake of rough fingers sliding soft. Hated the shiver of goosebumps across his arms until Dean handed him his coat —”take it Cas, I’m not cold”—and then goosebumps gave way to warmth and the smell of leather and Dean. He hated waking up unless Dean was there, unless Dean’s warmth reached out across the sheets like Cas wished he could so many times. But it was still early. So Cas just watched, watched the rise of Dean’s back, studied its slope into the sheets that pooled around his waist. Counted freckles on Dean’s arm. Worried when Dean’s brow furrowed in a dream—
“It’s your first time, it’s not going to be perfect,” Dean says. “Hell even I sucked my first time,” Dean says. This earns him a small grin from Cas who is relieved by Dean’s attempt to calm him. Cas’ grin sends a fleeting sense of happiness though Dean, and Dean sets him up to try again.
look and Dean’s cheeks go hot. Yea, what was that supposed to mean, Dean thinks. Tonight his mouth and hands have spoken before him, moved on their own, acted independently. He doesn’t know what’s happened, why his filter up and left, why he can’t keep his hands to himself. It’s almost terrifying him but he can’t stop. He felt it in the bar. It’s simply adrenaline, pure and raw and coursing. It’s fighting a werewolf with a broken stake in a dark den. It’s being a teenager all over again, riding his motorbike too fast, corn fields blurring into streaks of tan beside him. It’s a space where actions precede thought, where he cannot second guess but only react, move forward, keep pushing. He knows it’s about Cas—it’s always about Cas—but tonight it’s different. So often Dean has to hold himself back, has to think and think and overthink before he speaks. If he speaks at all. He has to restrain his hands from reaching out, has to keep a pained distance, has to think three steps ahead. Tonight, he isn’t. He isn’t thinking. He isn’t wondering what Cas is thinking. He’s only acting, reacting, leaning into the adrenaline of flirting with Cas, teasing the line, shifting into third gear.
Inside it’s your typical Southwestern fare; turquoise motifs, poorly painted navajo designs, chips at the table. Dean goes to get them a table. There’s a young brunette as a hostess tonight, but the restaurant’s not too full. She’s flirting with Dean until Cas comes up behind him, leans in very close, whispers something dry in Dean’s ear. Dean pushes him off, laughing, apologizing to her. Her eyes widen a hair. She kinda flusters, says a quiet "if you’ll follow me" and disappears. They follow her and Dean sorts laughs to himself—it’s not the first time they’ve been treated as an item—but when Cas follows closely in tow, hand bumping into his, Dean’s mind circles back.
The blade slices in deep and clean. Cas leaves it in, letting it slip from his hand as Dean slumps to his knees. There’s a small groan, then a silent tumble.
“Woah,” Cas said, turning the corner. “This looks—”
the eight, and trap Dean. Cas comes around to where Dean’s standing and Dean can see the moment it clicks. But when Cas leans over the table to take the shot, his shirt—
“It wasn’t so much kissing as making out Dean,” Cas says with a grin, “and yes I did. You didn’t smile in the other failed picture, but I’ll be a damn idiot if you’re not smiling in this one.”
“You are a very confusing man, Dean Winchester,” Cas says.
“Okay!” Cas shouts back, pulling the door back and stepping outside, a smile plastered on his face.
Dean doesn’t reply for a moment, just keeps rooting his hands through Cas’ hair.
Cas lays into him. Like he did last time.
And Cas was right. Cas takes the picture out of his pocket, and clear as day, Dean is smiling while kissing Cas, caught in a moment of pure joy, unfiltered bliss, and Dean can say now he isn’t afraid to hide it.
Cas makes a show of flopping over his book. “Well, we gathered and read scripture, yes. I always enjoyed our tradition.” The book flip backs up.
Cas turned his head.
“Huh...” Dean says. “So, two hours to be bad, huh?” he adds, grinning. Cas head turns so he can shoot Dean a
“Dean,” he murmured, low.
“Don’t ask.” Cas says, still hugging him.
“Hmm,” he says, leaning back now. “I’m not sure. I don’t have any, I guess.”
That sound you made when you had your first sip of hot chocolate. “Nothing, just thought it’d be fun,” Dean deflected.
“I'm so sorry, Cas. I...I” Dean said, nudging the crown of Cas’ head with his cheek. “I just, I just, I just fuck everything up. I fuck it up. I won’t let myself hurt you again. But I will. I will. I'm not good for you, I'm not enough” Dean says.
But fuck the collar is too loose and is exposing Cas neck and a peek of his collarbone and soon enough Dean’s wiggling hard under the table, clicking his pen repeatedly, until Castiel’s had enough.
“No, it’s not okay, Cas. It’s not okay.” Dean says, so quietly Cas has to strain to hear him.
The trunk clips close as Dean grabs their bags, barely shaking off the sleep lingering around his eyes. If Cas doesn't hurry with the keys he’s going to fall asleep standing up like a horse.
“Anyways….” Sam cuts in, “I was just telling Dean how quickly this year went by. We’re going to turn around and it’ll be Christmas already.”
“Dinner’s ready,” he says, leaning against the frame. His hands fumble over themselves, his mouth fumbles over what he can’t say. He waits. He knows Dean is on the other side, he’s been inside his room all day. Another minute.
“Do you think it needs more?” Cas asked, cocking his head. “Or….less?”
“Oh okay, yeah sure. I figured you’d have to learn sometime, so I guess now is as good a time as ever.” Dean says, getting up and throwing the blanket on him aside.
Dean just wraps his arms around Cas, and kisses his the top of his head. A few seconds of silence sit between them, neither one of them saying anything, just the two of them quietly wrapped together is enough.
“I wasn’t gonna stand around while they—”
“You’re pretty quiet there, Cas, you okay?” Dean says, almost on cue. Cas smiles to himself faintly. He knows Dean is teasing himself by teasing Cas, poking at what’s hanging in the air between them without bothering to cut it down.
“Can you believe it’s already December?” Sam asked, looking up from his laptop.
"uh, um- yea," Dean says, stuttering like some goddamn 2 year old.
Dinner is a little- no a lot awkward, but Sam says he’s okay with it, just as long as he doesn’t catch them doing anything that he would regret seeing for the rest of his life. Dean tells him to shut up and Cas laughs.
Cas’ hands are hiking up under Dean’s shirt, not lifting it off yet but simply scratching long trails across Dean’s shoulder blades. Dean rolls Cas over and now Cas is on top, straddling Dean. He maneuvers back and lifts Dean’s legs, letting them wrap around his waist. Dean tenses at first, surprised. The shock is replaced by a new heat tumbling down towards his dick. He grabs a fist full of Cas’ shirt, yanks him down towards him, tightens his legs around Cas’ waist. Cas starts rolling his hips into Dean’s ass and Dean moans into Cas’ mouth, unapologetic and loud.
"Alright well I’m gonna grab dinner," Sam says before putting his book down on the bedside table. He gets up and crosses Dean but stops.
“I....fuck, I” Dean says, staring at his hands as they fidgeted in his lap. His face was flushing again and he cursed under his breath.
“Really?” Cas says despite his thoughts, glancing up to meet Dean’s eyes.
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” Sam said in defense. He knew Dean was just fronting, knew he was embarrassed to be taking so long for a sweater. Sam wasn’t stupid: when Cas said it was his first Christmas he knew Dean would take it and run. He didn’t think it would be this bad.
“Yea. It’s New Year’s Eve, let’s go out. Come on, it beats sitting here all night,” Dean says, grabbing a change of clothes. Dean thinks Cas might put up a fight, moan about being tired—Dean is beat too—but he only shrugs.
“Oh? Am I in trouble?” Dean’s eyebrow cocks slightly, a teasing grin.
“Okay,” he says, continually flipping through the channels. Dean smiles and ducks into the bathroom to change.
Cas’ shakes him awake now, in jeans and nothing else. Dean’s breath hitches. Cas is close, so close that Dean can see the steam wisping off his bronzed skin, see it lick upwards. Dean’s eyes follow their spires, up past Cas’ navel, past the drop slipping off his chest, past the one caught in the hollow of his throat and up to Cas’ eyes. A flash of red creeps across Cas’ cheek and he turns sheepishly, quickly slipping on his shirt. Dean kinda coughs but doesn’t really move, just watches the muscles of Cas’ back ripple under his skin. Dean rolls over towards the shower.
. But he’s still smiling.
-------
“I love you too,” Dean says, reaching down to kiss Cas on the forehead.
“But you didn’t even buy one!”
“Really?” Cas says, having expected Dean to laugh in his face, saying something like he’d never drive, or that their was no need for him to learn, or whatever. Cas grins slightly, and turns around to walk off towards the entrance to the bunker.
Dean notices Cas’ surprise. He waves his hand. “I don’t know, I’m not twenty anymore.” He says, shrugging. “Even if I still look like it,” he adds, winking at Cas with a shit eating grin. Now Cas really rolls his eyes. He flags down a waitress.
“Yeah. You’ll be ready to drive anywhere really soon. You can count on it.” Dean says, bringing his eyes back to the road. He doesn’t see the smile that grows on Cas’ face. Dean being proud of him gave him a sense that maybe he was overreacting earlier with the whole key thing. Or maybe he’s overreacting now, thinking a simple compliment meant that’s all those nights spent awake wondering whether or not Dean felt about him was the same way he felt about Dean meant something. Cas shut down those thoughts as quickly as they sprung up, not wanting to dive deeper into something he new wouldn’t go anywhere.
“Okay so now try going a little faster,” Dean says. Cas nods and brings the Car up to 25.
Dean asks before he can stop himself. He knew it was a risk—this was so new—but so far, the world was still standing. Nothing had fallen apart. Cas was still right there, still scratching his chest, still faintly smiling.
“Dean,” Cas says, running his fingers along the handle. “Dean...this is beautiful. This is…” Cas keeps looking back and forth between Dean and the blade.
“Does who own the lot?” Dean asked.
Dean tried making conversation with Lisa, but his words were slurred and honestly Cas felt pretty bad for Lisa. He boyfriend was shitfaced and now she was stuck with him acting like a fucking dumbass.
“I guess.” Cas says, getting into the driver’s side.
“November 23rd” Cas says, content with his choice.
Dean came back from the bathroom and poured them all shots. Lisa politely declined, but Cas accepted. Dean took Lisa’s shot for her, tossing it back without even a wince.
