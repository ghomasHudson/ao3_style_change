He is true to his word. They dive below again, and now Sherlock observes how others in the pack behave. The older birds stay at the perimeter, and take turns at the front, flank, and rear positions. This leaves the juveniles at the centre, swimming in a virtual bubble of protection. Even the juveniles, however, are alert to their surroundings. They dive and surface in formation, but several pengs stay under when the rest of the pack is up, and several stay up when the others are under. There is never a time when every angle of visibility is not scrutinized.
“Gimme a kiss, then go back to sleep.”
“Oh sure, I see him quite frequently.” Annette tilted her head and gave John an expectant look.
Sherlock held his arms open and John rolled onto his side, up against Sherlock. He tucked his head under Sherlock's chin and pressed his palm flat over his heart.
“Yeah. Crazy.” Kevin shook his head, still grinning, then looked over at Rudy. “You both met Rudy? Salt of the earth right here, Rude. These two grew up on neighboring farms. Chickens, horses, tractors, the whole lot. More corn and soy than you could shake a stick at.”
“Besides, John, James has already told us he was going to set up some dates. Remember? He may have already been in touch with the Agency.”
In the afternoons the group dives and hunts for lunch, and then they break apart to meet as apprentice and teacher, or in John's case, apprentices and teacher.
Sherlock hesitates, not entirely sure to whom Erebus is speaking.

“Does your phone show anything?”
That next winter Selvic was ready to bond, and the two made plans to elope to a different colony before the migration back to Pobeda, to a place where they hoped they would be accepted. Though his parents had kept a close eye on him during their time at sea, the pair thought it would be fairly easy to slip away under cover of night; by morning, they’d have put a vast expanse of sea between them and their parents, and it would be too late for anyone to intervene.

“The descendant was charged with finding the heartstone, with or without Apo, and delivering it to him. He believed that if he could retrieve the heartstone, perhaps he would also find a way to restore Pono’s life, free Aumārire, and bring Kororā back from the brink upon which she was perishing.
, thank you for this:
“I’m only going because you give great head.”
Tui clears her throat. “You said, ‘Poor little thing. It must have just died recently, or it'd be completely covered up by now.’”
“But why this one, why now?”
"Who do you have there with you, Sherlock? Might we expect a happy announcement any time soon?"
“And how, my son, do you know that?”
okay whatever
“I know, I do. In case I forget to tell you later, I’m very proud of you.”
lover, sweetheart, darling, beloved one
“Yeah,” John whispered, bending his upper leg at the knee and planting that foot on the mattress.
For the first time since Sherlock came downstairs, John held his eye. His knots were beginning to unravel, loosened by the hint of a confession Sherlock had offered. He shook out his fists from where they were clenched by his sides. He gathered his courage, or his stupidity, whichever would soon be proven true, and planted himself in front of Sherlock. He grabbed his arms, just above his elbows, and nodded to himself, fortifying his resolve.
“Yeah. Wasn’t hard. What’s with the otters?”
Couples disperse as they leave the parade, and Sherlock knows they will seek out a place to mate. He remembers what John told him of a newly bonded pair’s behaviour, but has no desire to observe what he will someday experience himself. For now, he enjoys his and John’s mutual exploration of each other’s bodies, their petting and hugging and kissing, and the warmth that flows through him when John whispers private words in his ear.
“Oh, look at this one, look at how young you were! This must be hundreds of years old!”
"Dā, were you sad that you didn’t get to go with Pāpā to the Shelf to see the High Council?"
John held out a flute of something bubbly, holding another one close to his chest. “Did you finish the spinach smoothie?”
“I'm not defeated yet, you git.”
“You’re trembling,” John said.
“Absolutely not.”
“You’re still adorable.”
John ignored all of these asks but didn’t delete them. He did, however, delete the one that said that hedgehogs and otters were sexy together.
And Sherlock’s feelings for John had continued to grow past whatever limit he’d previously thought possible. He’d stopped expecting his love to stop growing. He was consumed with it. Sherlock’s love for John had been stitched together while they’d dated, with flirty smiles and gentle kisses, shared interests and keen anticipation. It had been fortified by John’s respect for Sherlock’s body, regard for his inexperience, appreciation of his tenuous steps forward into their sexual life. His love for John had been impermeably set in their mutual trust and in the sharing of joy and fear, anger and exultation. Being adored by John Watson was so much more satisfying than unravelling the mysteries of a chemical solution or the motivation for crime. Those had their place, of course, but at the end of each day, it was John’s foot tapping his under the dinner table that shored him up. It was John’s arms around him as they watched a movie, it was John’s text in the middle of the day to see how he was, it was John’s silly giggle and his gentle ribbing and exasperated sighs that connected Sherlock to himself and his place in the rest of the world.
Sherlock grumbles and moves approximately three inches.
“You're a little paralyzed? Is that a new medical condition? A little paralyzed?” Sherlock burrowed into John's space, resting his head on John's shoulder. John kissed his forehead and sighed. “Yeah. I think I can only move my lips now.”
“I take it that’s a yes?”
“Oh, please, you know what I mean, Erebus! You, of all pengs, know what I mean!”
“God, John. So good. You?”
“I’ll compromise. We’ll exchange gifts
“Hey, no, it’s all right. But can I answer your question with another one? Why would tonight be our last date?”
It is ridiculous what comes up when you search for "red briefs + jeans + man" or "red underwear + unbuttoned 501's" or "red underwear under men's jeans." I mean, seriously ridiculous.
Sherlock nods into John's shoulder.
“And I am going to be very fat, too. Huge. Enormous.”
"Right here, in the kitchen. Stop yelling the house down."
“Oh, that reminds me. We never called Greg about tomorrow night.”
Sherlock absentmindedly scratched at his not-bat-licked penis.
And then he proceeds to just casually walk away while Lestrade stands there with half of NSY at his back, just fucking seething.
“Her cats,” John explained before turning back to Molly.
Sherlock looked down and realised one of his top buttons had popped undone. He reached up to redo it and saw the way the other buttons strained when he moved his arms. Was the shirt too tight?
“Can I see it?”
When Laffitte reached across the table, John let him take his hand. Sherlock tried not to stare as Laffitte rubbed his thumb over the back of John’s knuckles. Those were his knuckles, Sherlock’s knuckles. Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s John. Sherlock’s
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck and planted a loud, sloppy kiss on his cheek, then dropped his head down onto his shoulder.
Cetus gives a few other instructions to Stamfjord and Molling regarding the remaining supplies, but says nothing to John, who is still staring at the ice. Around them, pengs organize themselves, fall into place, and begin the trek back to the colony. John and Sherlock are the last, and when John takes a step to join the others, Sherlock puts his wing on his shoulder, and whispers, “Please. John.”
“Oh! Yes, of course. On the back of the tooth, sir, toward the pointed end, there was a shape, like a snowflake, with six points. It looked as if it had been etched, but there were no grooves at all. It was a slightly different colour, too, quite golden. It was very peculiar.”
If you are waiting for the weekly chapter update and wondering what’s going on, please read what I posted on Tumblr and twitter:
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Sherlock felt his face split into an ear-to-ear grin as he approached the truck and leaned into the open window for a kiss.
“I actually knew that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John laughed and looked out his window. “You're ridiculous.”
but his mouth didn’t say a word.
"Our two pengs were oh-so-smart. They knew what she had done, but not why she had done it. One of their elders heard the two pengs speaking to their friends about it, and realized what the interloper had taken. He explained to them the same thing I will explain to you now. He told them about a group of penguins called the Apologists, and their quest to use Ika’s power to their own advantage, and against those who did not live their lives a certain way."
John stroked Sherlock’s hair and ran a fingertip around the shell of his ear. “What do you want to do for New Year’s Eve?”
Sherlock points down to the frozen tern body they’ve just stumbled over. It’s barely visible under a thin layer of snow and ice. “See?” He holds his wings out, underside up, and looks back and forth between them. He lets them flop back down to his sides. They don't see it. How can they not see it?
The house was quiet, but filled with the smells of bacon, coffee, and something baking. He rounded the corner into the kitchen, and there she was, sitting at the head of the old farmhouse table, purple reading glasses perched on the end of her nose, folded newspaper held in one hand.
Thank you for being so patient with me while I've not been able to post. I won't have a schedule from this point forward because I really don't know how the writing will go. I apologize for that, but hope the not knowing will make the eventual email notifications feel like little surprises. :)
Sherlock wrapped both arms and the book around John and hugged him tight. “You want to go to New York?” he said into John’s hair.
“Do you know anything horrible about me?”
Someone seated at the bar behind them laughed.
“I'm pretty sure you did that to yourself.”
“Well, I am! He’s mine!”
(See the end of the chapter for
John ran both hands through his hair and sniffed, rather angrily, if one can sniff angrily, then set his hands on his hips and licked his lips.
John looks like he’s about to hit something, and Sherlock decides it might be a good time to step in.
___ Jurisprudence: Admiralty and Maritime Law (pg 9)
“Oh yes, it seems the state never stops fussing about what the schools need to do.” Mrs. Watson seemed relieved to be on more solid ground. “I don’t know how teachers even manage to get the actual teaching done, to be honest, what with all the standardized tests and assessments. Why, I remember having to go in and talk sense to John’s third-grade teacher—do you remember this, honey?—because he came home and said they weren’t going to learn cursive! Can you imagine? No cursive?” Mrs. Watson tisked and took another bite of her pie.
Janine adjusts expectations now, offering a bit of hope after such profound tragedy and failure. "No one ever knew what became of Pōrangi. For a while, pengs everywhere searched for her remains, and when they could not find those, they searched for just one thing: her tooth. Because surely a tooth of such significance would prevail, would it not? They searched and they searched, and in time, hopes of finding the tooth slipped away, too."
“Corn oil. Kosher salt.”
“I see. And there’s no way I can convince you –”
John and Sherlock walked inland for no more than thirty seconds, then John pulled a blanket out of his rucksack and fluttered it down over a soft, grassy patch. He sat down cross-legged and patted the space next to him.
“I’m downloading the data onto a memory stick so that I can study it at home.”
He needed to trust John. They needed to figure this out together.
“No, after that.”
“Can we help you with anything else while we’re here?”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.”
“Dating?”
“Do you mind if I keep the stockings on?”
Sherlock watches them diligently, making sure they’re settled and not about to catch him out, so he does not notice the pair of eyes glaring at him from half-slit lids. These particular eyelids belong to his very own Johnling, and as soon as Sherlock feels the weight of them on his face, he snaps his eyes shut, and pretends to sleep. It’s ridiculous, he knows it is, but it’s the best combination of avoidance and delay he can come up with in the moment.
“I guess not. What if you’re a sex worker and the customer is really, you know, not your type, and you can’t, you know.”
"They help hold the dress up. Something strapless is more likely to slip down with nothing to hold it up, especially with dance moves like these."
"I have a theory, Pāpā. Would you like to hear it?"
"You were wrong."
Sherlock groaned. “I wouldn’t have put it quite so crudely, but yes.”
“Of course,” he croons, and Sherlock wants to vomit cephalopod. Instead, he grumbles under his breath, and rolls his eyes when Maryle shoots a vicious glare in his direction.
you'll find them inside Baker Street
“Never mind. I’m going, Tui. I think you can probably see why. Plus, between us, I’m the better hunter, and will bring back more, faster.”
Sherlock watched their exchange with a tinge of jealousy and guilt. Molly and John were obviously close and John’s natural caretaking tendencies were kicking into overdrive. Molly probably could use the escort home, but Sherlock selfishly wanted John to stay. They’d had almost no time together since he’d arrived, no time to get to know each other better, or for Sherlock to decipher how much of their meetup was to study, how much to date. And would John be able to stop worrying about Molly even after she left?
“Always.”
He thought he heard the crunch of tires on gravel outside. He closed the closet door and looked around the room. Clean sheets, tossed in the dryer with one of those fabric softener sheets. Extra pillows, plumped. Candles, six of them, assorted sizes and shapes, all of them set in saucers and lit, glowing golden around his tidied room, on his desk, the nightstand, the windowsill, his dresser, the bookshelf.
“Do you doubt it?”
“You need to come?” John whispered, moving to sit next to Sherlock on the bed, leaning onto one hip and propping himself up with one arm. He cupped Sherlock’s face with one hand and leaned down to suck on his earlobe.
“She doesn't have any, Imogen. She can't have children because she doesn't have the right equipment for the task, and she doesn't have a mate. Only the Queen can make more bees.”
Sherlock took a step closer to the door.
John stops breathing and closes his eyes.
He had also packed a pair of charcoal grey dress pants that hugged him just so, sat low on his narrow waist, and flared slightly at the bottom, breaking perfectly over well-shined black leather Chelsea boots.
“John, I'm so hard,” he said as he nuzzled between John's cheeks. “This—makes—me—so—hard.”
Johnling
"Noooo, not yet."
“Yeah. Come down here.”
That night, alone in bed, Sherlock pressed John's pillow to his face and breathed John's scent deep into his lungs. He ran his hands over the places on the mattress where John would be sprawled, and stretched his leg diagonally across the bed, and held onto John this way, with his pillow and scent and usual places.
Sherlock was somewhat amused by this new dynamic, and he humoured John, assuming that this rather contrary behaviour would settle down given enough time. John was so angry, so, so angry. He was too angry to work, to talk, to laugh, to sit, to be still, to be. He was too angry to sleep, so Sherlock stayed up, too, and watched John fume like a tiny volcano in the near distance. It was all just a little bit exciting.
, and so far he's only
“Just, um, I could —“
“Let’s sleep in here tonight. We can open up the futon.”
Thanks, KA, for beta-ing.
Sherlock crawls up the length of John’s still-seizing body, and he curls up along John’s side, with his head on John’s shoulder, and his groin pressed to John’s thigh, and his leg pressed between John’s still-spread legs, and he says, “Okay?”
“All right. Let us lay down the foundation of this tale, shall we? Sherlock, the
approach before he sees him. He is Sherlock's height, with slightly more remaining juvenile plumage, and a sharp, curious glint to his eyes.
John smiles to himself at the memory of Sherlock reading Mycroft's note over his shoulder, huffing in indignation, and ranting about a certain older brother not reaching his next birthday if he kept on being such a condescending git.
“Mm, what is that? You taste good.”

"No, love. You take care of me each and every day. This is just the first time you've realized it."
Tui looks like she’s going to ask another question, but Anahera shushes her and tells her to rest. John and Sherlock walk away, heading toward Cetus’ usual corner of the colony. They’ll let him know that Tui is awake, and in good form, and that she has questions.
Sherlock touches John, caresses his face and neck and chest, and rubs himself against his
on it. It was then I allowed myself to consider that it might be true. All of it. And I have considered. I carried the tooth for a long time. It was hard to think about anything but that tooth, and John, of course. Even now, having left it behind, I still think about it, because I think if you are so consumed by something, your thoughts continue to carry it, even when you do not.
When they couldn’t eat anymore, Mr. Watson popped in the first of the movies they always watched. Two were traditional:
They started again, slowly. Slow kisses, slow stroking, slow explorations. Soft sighs and gasps and smiles.
“Right. Okay, that’s fine. I’ll just say that I hope it’s not our last date, okay?”
“Anahera,” they say at the same time.
Around them, other pengs begin to call for each other, and the sky above Pobeda bears witness to another season of courting. In a few days it will be done. For now, Sherlock and John take their place at the head of the parade, where they will lead other couples around the colony in a show of who’s who in the newly bonded. As they wait for others to join them, Sherlock alternately preens and grooms John.
Also by lilicorbijn,
“Why?”
“So kiss me.”
“Boots and socks next,” John said, bending down to untie Sherlock’s laces. Sherlock balanced with one hand on John’s shoulder as he stepped out of the hiking boots and let John peel off his socks.
The second time they woke, it was to the sound of the housekeeper’s vacuum bumping up and down the hallway outside their room. Sherlock pulled a pillow over his head, and John mumbled something about the crime of driving a vacuum cleaner without a license. They fell asleep again.
“I don't remember.”
John put some space between them and met Sherlock’s eye. Sherlock could tell he was trying to smile, but his eyes were as full and wet as his own.
“Your tail.”
“Jesus Christ, I love you so fucking much,” John said just before closing the distance and taking Sherlock’s mouth with his own. “So much,” he murmured against Sherlock’s lips.
“An experiment. Ignore me.”
“That was so good. I was gonna come.” John's voice was breathy, quiet. “Why'd you stop?”
“Sit down, master expert fire-maker.”
John had gone and shed the last of his baby fat, and was all muscle and tendon, pecs and quads and glutes and lats, abs and delts and calves. He’d gone and made himself into a man, and Sherlock thought he was more man than any of the men he might’ve noticed before, before he resolved not to notice.
What do you think?”
As soon as they reach the colony, Anahera and Tui come tobogganing over the ice toward them.
My gods, where to start? Sherlock asks himself.
“Oh my, yes. I remember my first beau. Steve Hanson. He was the quarterback of our football team. I didn’t think he’d ever look my way, but then I made the cheerleading team, and there’s just something about cheerleaders and football players, isn’t there? We went steady for a good year before Betty Roberts swept into town with her little sweater sets and her painted nails. Heavens, what a stir she caused.”
Sherlock knew his face was puffy and his eyes were red, and maybe if he’d been without John it would’ve bothered him, that others could tell he’d been crying, but he was with John, and with friends, and he was fine with them knowing.
“No. Now we have to take it home, to Pobeda.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock let his body go limp, and steeped in the bliss of John's warm weight along the length of him, the low hum of those words in his ear, the sense of being completely covered and contained by his man.
Sherlock stared. “You're serious? Oh, my God, are you serious?”
John was sat on the sofa, his newspaper scattered over his thighs and his stocking feet crossed on the coffee table. The scene was completely normal except for the bear sitting at his hip. John had requisitioned it immediately after Mummy's departure, inspecting it, sniffing it, poking at it and running his fingers over its worn, nubby shape. Throughout the day Sherlock had found it in various places around the flat. First it was on their bed, then on the mantelpiece next to the skull, then on a kitchen shelf. Eventually it seemed to be wherever John was: sofa, kitchen, windowsill, armchair.
“I know. It is. I'm fine, really. You've made me feel better.”
Sherlock backtracked to the closet and swept the sliding door open. John’s shirts hung on the left side, haphazard, half off the hangers, collars underturned and cuffs still rolled up. Sherlock’s were on the right, the hangers evenly spaced, his shirts arranged by color, the top two buttons of each one done up to keep the shape of the cut. There, however, between his dark blue striped polo and his light gray button-up, was something new.
Then it’s senior year, and Sherlock has to close his eyes for a minute, because there’s a picture of them from that very day, that day that John had shown up on a Monday morning, having gone and changed, just like that, into a man. He and Sherlock are standing side-by-side, backs to the camera, arms folded over the top of the chain link fence surrounding the football field. John is wearing his uniform, and Sherlock is leaning over, talking into John’s ear as they watch the action on the field. He remembers it clearly, remembers how he tried to focus on the plays of the other team so he could help John predict what they would do next, all the while distracted by John’s smell, and his strong body under the shoulder pads, his chest heaving with exertion, his legs bulked up with the thigh and knee pads. Oh, he had wanted. Sherlock had wanted very badly that night.
“What are you thinking about?”
“You’ve solved it?”
“Let's go together, John, as it affects all four of us.”
Sherlock’s undercoat bristles with suspicion. Where is Hudi?
“What?” John said while he twiddled his thumbs and looked anywhere but at Sherlock.
spouse
“Mmhm.”
“I’m great. I’m. Yes. We need to talk.”
He would generally wait an hour or two after the courier came so that Mummy would have a chance to go through them herself, and then he’d sneak into the library under the pretence of picking out or returning a book to one of the dozens of built-in shelves, and he’d peek. That’s all he would do. Peek.
"Calming her down."
“Is he handsome, your Johnling? What does he look like?”
now you weep in the shadows
“You’re a shameless flirt, John Watson,” Molly Hooper murmured, coming up beside him to start brewing a Vietnamese coffee for a Vincent. Nudging John aside with her elbow she pulled a prepared pitcher of sweetened condensed milk out of the fridge beneath the bar and poured a little into the bottom of a clear tumbler style glass. Setting the special steel filter on top of the glass, she ground out two single servings of espresso and dumped it into the bottom.
Sherlock nodded again, head down, tears flooding his eyes. And John, his John, who knew him so well, turned him around, wrapped him in his arms, and held him.
, my brother has sacrificed a life of his own to selflessly serve his Council, and now the Junior Council under it. He is charged with keeping me safe, and seeing to it that I fulfil the destiny predicted by my shell’s prophecy. Everything he does, he does for someone else. Of course he is biased. He is biased toward the wellbeing of each and every emperor hatched, last winter, this winter, and for all the winters to come. And who better to serve you, than an emperor who puts the needs of the whole above the whole of his needs?”
“You love how much noise I make, but I'll keep it down.”
“Jesus Christ,” John whispered.
The pier was lit up in a million lights, and John’s profile was edged in their glow. Sherlock could see his lashes blink open and shut, and the shine of his tongue when he licked his lip.
It was too much, all of this detritus of days and years long past. It was nothing more than a mausoleum, and Sherlock, alone in his childhood home, needed to do something about it, now, before he suffocated.
“It doesn’t matter. You were trying. I’m not a hero, not unless you are, too.”
Sherlock pulls back, straightens up, feels dizzy. “What? Oh! I guess you could say I traded in the tooth for this. A new talisman.” He tries to kiss John again, all his feathers quivering in an attempt to release heat. John’s wings are sliding over his chest, under the seaweed rope, testing the weight of what it holds inside.
(805) 252-1985
John got up and headed to the bathroom. “Like I’ve said before, it doesn’t bother me when you do, it just seemed different this time.”
Almost everyone is there when they return, but no one is paying attention to them. They’ve gathered around Cetus, who is attending to a prone peng.
There is a heart beat of silence, then another, then one more.
Sherlock lifted his hands in defence of himself and shook his head. "I'm not even touching you!"
Sherlock considers his options, and heads toward Cetus. As he approaches, Mycroft looks up and gives him a questioning look. Sherlock gestures toward the other peng, and Mycroft gives a small signal of acknowledgment, exchanges a quick word with Cetus, and waddles away. The healer finishes grooming with one last shake of his feathers, and smiles at Sherlock.
“Yes, I do believe I am.” Sherlock climbed onto the bed next to John, gave him a lingering kiss, and settled down onto his elbows and knees. He rested his forehead on intertwined fingers and wiggled his bottom. “How’s this?”
Chapters 5, 6, and 7, are unbeta'd. That's because 1. KarlyAnne is getting a PhD and has big stuff going on that she needs to work on, and 2. I'm writing much more for each chapter than I originally estimated, and 3. I want KarlyAnne to prioritize her schoolwork, and I want to post this as close to real-time as I can, so we agreed that I'll post the rest unbeta'd, and she'll beta it later. You may see typos here, you may find mistakes, but they'll be fixed in time.
Sherlock went to John and stood there, arms hanging down, head resting on John’s shoulder, face turned into his neck. John ran his hands up and down Sherlock’s back. “I know, babe. I know. I feel it, too.”
Sherlock pulls John down to him now, away from the coloured barrettes that he's been fiddling with, and kisses his hair. He throws one leg over John's and trails his fingertips up and down John's chest.
“No!”
Sherlock looked down at his hands folded together on the table top. “You've been my mom all these years, Mrs. Hudson. Not like my mom, but an actual mom. Thank you. For everything.”
“Yes, that is true. He was thrilled to be asked,
“We’ll be the ones to bring back
Maybe John was going to apologise for leading Sherlock on, and withdraw his candidacy. It was the only thing that made sense. He even knew why John was withdrawing his candidacy. It was because of Sherlock’s issues with being touched. It was because he wouldn’t do more than exchange a few mostly-chaste kisses on their last date. He was frigid, and no one wanted a frigid partner.
“Yeah. The best was when you'd bend down to wash your legs, or feet, and Jesus, Sherlock, I'd have to start doing calculus in my head to keep from getting hard. I’ll never forget that
Erebus must see the worry etched into Sherlock's expression. “The evidence does seem to indicate that the Anahi are still heavily influenced by apologist theory. But, Sherlock, you must not fret unnecessarily. Mycroft’s work with the High Council would have identified the Anahi as a stronghold of apologist thought, and the High Council will no doubt be working to neutralize any continued threat."
“Will you play something for me?”
"AHHRGH!"
“No, I really don’t. Come on. Come with me.” John nudges Sherlock back from the edge of the crèche, poking his wings into Sherlock’s ribs to get him to move.
Everyone looked at Mary, who had now gone silent as she glared at the wall in front of her.
His Sherlock.
, Sherlock thinks.
“Why can't I stay up here, with you?”
The most useless words in the entirely of human existence:
The new winter is on them, and despite working tirelessly, they are no closer to receiving an egg than they were before they knew they wanted one. They have found pengs willing to impreggnate same-peng couples, but there has not been a single case of a peng willing to donate an egg, and no eggs viable for adoption. Sherlock and John have avoided having the inevitable conversation for as long as they can, until they cannot put if off any longer. The mating season is on them once again.
“Don't take this the wrong way, but I might be too full to fool around.”
Café Selmarie is also TDF. The three desserts I mention in this chapter are the three desserts my family always orders. The restaurant is also always consistently delicious.
Above him the sofa shifted, and when he opened his eyes he saw John hovering over him, one hand planted on the armrest to the right of Sherlock's head, the other gripping his cock in a tight fist. Sherlock reached for him, pulling his face down for a lazy, post-coital snog, and felt John's knuckles swiping over his belly as he pulled and tugged himself toward climax. John kissed back, fiercely to start, his mouth then moving more sloppily as his breathing outpaced his agility, then going completely slack as his chest heaved and his fist flew, small choking sounds spilling across his tongue.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to this. He has already decided that he must be with John, forever, no matter what, but he hasn’t thought ahead to the calling, and doesn't know if it’s possible to choose a mate without the calling, or if it’s possible for two male emperors to be together.
As they drove through the small market towns of Perthshire, Sherlock imagined a large brick home, Georgian in style, with a circular drive and overgrown hedges. He was surprised when John pulled off the narrow lane and onto an even narrower dirt path and said, “Here we are.”
“No.”
“Are you asking because you’re concerned that I would, or out of philosophical curiosity?”
“I think I’m the luckiest man in the world.”
“Exactly, John. You’re old enough to be –”
“Your sister won’t come to the wedding because she’s an alcoholic and she’s in rehab.”
She shakes her head as if to dislodge something confusing. “That makes no sense.”
Trudging to the recycling bin, Sherlock racked his brain for an opportune place to take John. The barn was too cold, the house was a minefield of Hudson. They weren’t expected back to the Watson’s until supper. The car? Maybe the car. No, that’d be too cold, too, unless they kept it running, but where could they go where there was no chance of being seen? Sherlock went back inside. Mrs. Hudson was sitting at the table with John.
John’s hand was warm over his, and his fingers found their way between Sherlock’s in the dark with no problem at all. John gave Sherlock’s hand a small squeeze, and Sherlock, with tingles spreading up his arm and throughout the rest of his body, squeezed back.
At the edge of the huddle, chest pressed to John’s back, Sherlock stands awake, studying the constellations and imagining stories that might yet be told.
And Sherlock realized he wasn’t sure he wanted to risk that again. He wasn’t sure he could let someone in, go through the exhausting effort of vulnerability, to fall in love and then be decimated by another humiliating rejection.
Sherlock pressed the back of his head into John's stomach and mumbled, “There are two perfectly comfortable chairs over there if you don't find this acceptable. I prefer to lie down.” For half-a-second he thought John might toss him on the floor, but he didn't. Nothing happened. Sherlock was still on the sofa.
“So good, so good, John, oh, God.”
John pressed his index finger into a pile of crumbs on the table and rolled them between his fingers. “So, have you called?”
“As long as you're ready to go by Thursday.”
“And that was when you knew? That something was different?”
John was right behind him. “Whoa, hold up there.” He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and turned him around. “Slow down. Let’s do this right.”
He loves this childish, innocent side of Sherlock, the part that takes delight in the small things he'd never before thought worthy of consideration. He loves that Sherlock allows himself to see through Imi's eyes, to indulge her enthusiasms and interests.
“Your abundance of excitement over every single thing.”
“Slow down, John. I promise I'm not going to run away.”
“I don’t believe we do. But others do. And if I can find the heartstone, if I can find something that no one else has been able to find, if I can do that, then maybe I can prove that we all have the ability inside us to do what we thought was impossible. We don't have to wait for someone to give it to us.”
I know this chapter is vague. I'm going to ask each of you to come to your own conclusions. Sherlock will be pondering Erebus' experience/dream for the duration of the hunt, so if you're not sure, you're not the only one.
“Anyway – food. Do you have any preferences?”
“Sherlock!” Angelo boomed. “It’s been too long my friend, too long!” He clapped Sherlock on the shoulder and held an arm out to his side, gesturing towards an intimate table at the front window, the best seat in the house. “So nice you brought your boyfriend in for a meal! Let me get another candle, a better candle, for the table. More romantic.” He then had the utter audacity to wink at them before disappearing behind a counter. Sherlock carefully studied the shine on his black leather boots. Next to him, John rocked back and forth on the heels of his navy blue and white converse, hands clasped behind his back, chin up.
John rinsed the razor in the cloudy water and tapped it on the side of the bowl. He tugged the skin over his jaw taut and cleared another stripe of shaving cream.
“Let’s stay here. I want to look around some more and walk the grounds, maybe take a short hike. Will you come with me?”
“Hey, what’s going on in there,” John said, tapping Sherlock’s forehead with his index finger.
“It’s fantastic. Your style is minimalistic without being sterile and you have tons of space, which is somewhat rare for modern construction. And who wouldn’t be impressed with the views?”
Sherlock propped himself up against the counter on both elbows, and waited for the bartender to work his way down to his end. He vaguely remembered that he had certain skills he could employ to entice the bartender to appear faster, but couldn’t remember what they were. That was okay. Everything in good time. Just like him and John.
Sherlock panted through it, shuddering, toes curling, and then he felt John lie down next to him and take him into his arms. They stayed like that, Sherlock panting against John’s chest, John kissing his hair until Sherlock could take a deep breath and form words.
John pulled into Angelo’s Pizzeria, put the car in park, and said, “Wait here, okay? I’ll be back in a minute.”
“Ooh, living large, you guys!” Harry teased, stealing a potato chip from John’s plate. “Are you going to eat these?”
“Bit of a spectacle she’s putting on here, wouldn’t you say, Son?”
“Sherlock Holmes? I’m John Watson.”
“So, I take it you’re happy, Sherlpeng?”
They stared at each other, stared in lust and awe and love, and then Sherlock covered John's mouth with his own and began to thrust. He was careful at first, only short, slow slides. He focused on John's mouth under his, on his breathing, on the sounds he was making. He played with his position, shifting in inches this way and that, angling, aiming.

“How’s your night been?”
“It is time for each and every one of us to decide for ourselves what is right. What do you, and you, and you, and you, believe? Is this the heartstone? And what if it is? I invite each and every one of you to come stand before it today, here and now, and make up your own mind.
“Right? Think you remember how?”
Now, John rolled onto his side, told Sherlock to lie down on his back, and then climbed on top of him.
Sherlock kissed the side of John’s head, and pulled back enough to see his face. “Anything you want. Come on, get undressed.”
“Of course, dear,” she said, as John slammed out the back door. “Sherlock, try and talk some sense into him, won’t you? Oh, and here, he forgot the scarf.”
"Second, the Council is required to hear from all pengs involved, including secondary witnesses, regarding said allegations. An accused peng can choose to waive his or her right to share their version of events, but in response, the Council has the right to solicit impressions on behalf of the accused.

Maude's is one of my favorite downtown restaurants, and the smokey violet smash is fantastic.
“I, um, I want … I mean, yes, I love that, I always want that, but I was thinking, maybe …?”
“So then, should we turn out the lights?” Sherlock asked.
“John, of these questions, you have already answered one of them. When you looked at the heartstone you said it felt like hope. In the legend, Kororā’s love for Pono was pure. Pono’s heart should be a reminder to all of us that same-peng love is not a crime. This is what I hope to achieve by bringing it home.

“Yeah. Someday.”
It isn’t until he hears Molling say something about dissecting a dead albatross, that he fully turns his attention to her.
“I’d like to see that one.”
Gold. That's gold right there, people.
“You okay?”
Sherlock nodded.
“Don’t be sorry. Just … stay with me, okay? Here, help me clean this place up.” John tossed him an empty paper bag and gave him some instructions. “Let’s straighten up now so we don’t have to do it tomorrow. We don’t have to pack, okay? We’ll just tidy up, clear away the chaos.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
Kevin nodded. “Well, it makes sense. You’ve known each other your whole lives. You probably had no point of comparison, no idea that best friends aren’t usually quite … like
“Right there, harder. Yeah. Fuck, that’s good.”
“Ah, well, I doubt she would have any with her right now. She's working on something else at the moment. They work very hard, Imogen, so hard that they only live about six weeks.”
“Alright. For your birthday, gorgeous. Ready to head back?”
"Hmm. No more games, then? Maybe just one. Hide and seek. Count to five, then find me." He inhales through his nose, sinks back into the water, keeping his eyes on John's until he's under.
“How do you know, Arikipeng?”
“I melted it. I mean, I melted the ice around it. It must have been under me when I woke up and came outside. I’m examining it. I’ve ruled out various species of sea urchin, and algae, and now I’m trying to remember if there are any Antarctic birds that lay red eggs. Do you know?”
is the most comprehensive gay hanky code chart I've seen. It lists olive as military, but I've seen other charts that list olive as uniform, and camouflage as military.
Sherlock reeled back against the wall as if John had punched him. “And in those years, John, were you also waiting for a shift in your own interests? Because God knows, you’ve dated most of the women in London. You even went as far as to marry one of them, for Christ’s sake.”
Sherlock took his letter and went back upstairs. He slid it into John's duffel bag and then let himself into the steam-filled bathroom, shucked his robe, underwear, and T-shirt and stepped into the shower behind John.
John popped off Sherlock's cock, stilled his own pumping hips, and peered up at him.
One wakes before the other, and the light shines a bit brighter now.
“I doubt that would be possible, John.”
“Yeah. I can imagine. But on the other hand, how was it news to her? I’d only met you guys a few times over the years, and I could see it.”
“Yeah, well, you’re naked and gorgeous, so it’s no wonder.”
John palmed Sherlock's ass with both hands, caressing in soft, smooth circles. His touch was light, but the effect was strong, a wave of arousal surging through Sherlock's body. He wanted more, more touch, more tongue, more John.
“Father, I –”
Mrs. Hudson served up the cake and hot chocolate for her boys, and took her own mug and dish with her into her bedroom. Sherlock was relieved. Had all three of them sat down together, John might’ve started asking her questions about Mycroft, too, and Sherlock had had enough of that conversation to last quite a while.
“Like you’re hiding something.”
Sherlock squeaks.
Stilton and leek
“It’s all a little over the top, isn’t it?” Sherlock watched the flower girls and ring bearers toddle their way up the aisle. The girls were tossing flower petals in front of them, leaving a trail of pink and peach that John and Sherlock would walk over. One of them was being rather over-enthusiastic about it, alternating between throwing handfuls of the floral confetti over her head and bombing fistfuls of it toward the ground.
“Sherlock. Would you – after all these years – if I –” John stutters and stops and starts again. Sherlock tries to smooth his expression.
“I do. And here’s my answer, which does not require privacy. I have answered my own questions regarding our talisman. This is now a matter for the High Council, and the High Council only. They will need information about the logistics of this item, where we found it, who else sought it, why they sought it, the implications of that, and so on.
The days stretch longer on the other side of the spring equinox. The sun rises higher in the sky, raising everyone’s energy with it, and the colony thrums with activity as the long winter draws to its end. Adults and chicks alike move about more freely, leaving the huddle behind for longer and longer periods of time.
“Sherlock? What's wrong?”
"You'll spank me?"
John, who usually has love spilling out all over Sherlock, has been surprisingly reticent about expressing that love in too physically intimate a manner, ever since Anahera dropped off her little gift. Sherlock understands. He does. The egg is precious, and fragile, and to squash, drop, expose, crack, shake, or otherwise harm it would be catastrophic. However, Sherlock thinks John may be just a tiny bit overprotective.
Sherlock knew that if Annette really wanted to hear them she’d easily be able to eavesdrop, but she seemed completely nonchalant about the guest in their house or the death threat directed at him. They pushed back from the table and made their way to the library. He and James took their seats while John closed the door behind them.
"Well, there are six kinds on the continent and surrounding islands now, right?"
Sherlock pursed his lips and blinked. He knew nothing horrible about John. John was fantastic. He was kind and lovely and sexy and without a shred of a doubt, Sherlock knew that he didn’t know a single awful thing about John, deduced or otherwise.
He sucked one of John’s balls into his mouth, and mutual groans resonated between them as the puckered skin tightened on his tongue and bunched against Sherlock’s full lips. He held John there, like a cat playing with a mouse, teasing, not letting go, just
“Very soon. Would you like to hear what I like?”
John cupped and tugged on Sherlock's balls, then pushed his tongue in again.
“Oh,” he said into John’s mouth at a particularly hard throb.
There was nothing for it, Sherlock thought. He knew how he’d be most comfortable, and if John was sincere in his wish that Sherlock be comfortable, then John wouldn’t mind. He stood up and pulled on the pyjama bottoms, then slipped the long sleeve shirt over his head, adjusted the seams to rest on his shoulders, and tugged the cuffs down. John must have been much better at observing than Sherlock had given him credit for because the fit of both items was perfect. He looked down at his feet, where the bottoms pooled gently along the high arch of his foot, and he looked at his hands, where his sleeves fell to just below his wrists. Lastly, he slipped the robe on, tied the sash, and left the bathroom so that John could have his turn.
Sherlock felt himself get a little bit harder.
“I should, should I?”

“Not just Tui. The eggs. The eggs are arriving, boys. You are in good company.”
of each explosion in his chest, his adrenaline reaching a peak as the last blasts blazed, leaving nothing but a trail of smoke high over the still water, and the cover of darkness where there’d been light.
“Hey!” John shouted into Sherlock’s ear. “We’ve never danced together, either!”
“They're happy ones. Let me take care of you, now.”
“Are you all right?”

“God knows what’s on this carpet.”

“This was mine. Now it is yours.” Anahera brushes again him, just the lightest of touches, but Sherlock finds himself off-balance, and has to flatten his tail against the ice so he does not fall over. Just as suddenly, she steps back, and sighs. “This is it, then, Sherlock. I do believe we are safe now.”
This gif may have exchanged hands during the beta-ing of this chapter.
“You are far from stupid, Sherlock. We have both been beside ourselves with worry, and not thinking clearly. Now, though, it is time to take action. What if we split up? You and John can talk with Siger, Erebus, and Cetus, and I can talk with Pavo and Vela. Who is the Junior Council representative this moon?”
“‘I'm sorry, I'd hoped to be able to give you better news than that, but maybe it's a good thing it isn't worse, with a lot of yelling and screaming?’
Sherlock's squints, channelling all of his focus onto John. “Tell me.”
They walked around the side of the house, through the back garden, and to a decrepit, leaning gate. John jiggled the rusted latch with increasing, nervous aggression until the whole thing came off in his hand, then he scraped the gate through the overgrown grass, adopted his most official gait, and started down a dirt path. He could hear Sherlock on his heels.
"Like our first dinner?"
“I was hoping you’d have something to say about it.”
The clarinet, fortunately, had not reached the water. It lay in a patch of sunbaked mud partially hidden by a cluster of tall grass. John picked it up, brushed it off, and inspected it for damage. It seemed to be okay. He brought it back to their small picnic site and waved it at Sherlock.
“It was part of the dream. Did I not tell you?”
I pray for your eternal light
Sherlock had a hunch that he’d find John in the kitchen, so after he dressed, haphazardly at that, he made his way downstairs and rapped at the swing door before entering. He stood there for a minute, feeling the door whoosh back and forth behind him, and closed his eyes.
“I'll owe her one, which means you guys owe me one.”
When Sherlock was little, only four or five, he’d been horribly afraid of the dark. He wouldn’t go upstairs by himself unless the hallway lights were already on, and so he’d taken to leaving them on all the time, hoping no one would turn them off again. After several days of this, his father asked, “Who keeps leaving these lights on? It’s not even dark yet.”
“Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Ms. Sarah Sawyer. She's just moved here, what, three months ago, from Davenport, to take Martha’s place at the elementary school.”
"Absolutely, brother Mycroft. I had no idea you were still unclear on the topic. After hatching, the Aptenodytes forsteri brood on alternating parents for approximately two full moons until they are grown enough to join the crèche. At that time, the adults leave en masse to hunt and bring back food; soon after the forsteri chicks will moult and acquire their juvenile plumage, which will signal readiness for their first swim. At that point they will be considered fledged. At approximately three winters of age the forsteri reaches reproductive maturity, but it will take another one to three winters before most take a mate. The cycle then repeats with a new generation. Is there anything else you were uncertain about?"
“Was I?” John’s tone was light and teasing.
the swell
“Is that good?”
“My God. It’s enormous.”
“You go by my orders, Sherlock, but also with my blessing, and my promise that no matter what happens, John is family now, and will be treated as such. Godsspeed, my son.”
The next morning, he wakes earlier than the others. Stretching, blinking, he surveys the scene before him. Irena and Janine are snuggled together in the middle of the huddle, Anthea back-to-back with Janine, and close to, but not touching, Stamfjord’s side. Lestra is back-to-back with John, and belly-to-belly with Molling. Interesting.
“Feels so big.”
Greg was already at a table with a hot drink and half-eaten muffin in front of him. He waved at them and mumbled through a mouthful of carrot-bran-walnut, “Hey, guys. Grab a coffee and come sit down.”
“Oh, right.” Sherlock felt John’s hands return to his thighs, up high, near his balls. "So the captain of the fire department figured out who did it and took him back to his room to talk to him about it. The college guy was thinking about how hot the captain was in his uniform, and how fit he was, stuff like that. When they get back to his room the kid tried to apologize, thinking maybe he could impress the captain with his honesty, but the captain just sat on his bed and told the kid to lie over his lap with his underwear down around his thighs. He didn’t even have him take them off, he just wanted them stretched tight under, under his ass.”
“I have never believed in a literal version of our mythology. I do not mean to offend you, I only mean to be clear. From the first time I heard about Kororā and the heartstone, I thought the creation of such myth was our way of explaining those things we couldn’t understand. Why can we no longer fly? What happened to our cousins from long ago, now gone?
“He said she’s been trying to get him to see her way of thinking, and to get him to talk to me, too. He said he’s tried to be very clear with her that he does not have a problem with who I’m dating, does not think it’s a sign of something having gone wrong, and that he won’t interfere.”
“I keep bees now. I play the violin for them, sometimes for hours. I make tea. I drink it with honey. A woman comes and does the laundry and hangs it on the line in the garden. Sometimes I take my supper at seven, sometimes at midnight, sometimes not at all. I sleep naked, with the windows open, even in winter, and I like to have a fire lit, even in summer. Sometimes when I wake up there is a cat at the bottom of the bed. I do not have a cat.”
Um, yeah. Our spring break starts in two weeks, and these two are still enjoying their Christmas holidays. Ah well.
John slipped his hand up into the wet curls at the back of Sherlock’s head, and surged forward. Sherlock felt the expanse of John’s chest against his, and a second later, John’s mouth, lower lip, upper lip, a hint of tongue between them. John pressed. Sherlock tilted and opened and nudged, and it deepened, sweet and wet, growing into an urgent thing between them. They both kicked hard to stay afloat, Sherlock’s hands on either side of John’s face, John’s hands sliding down and cupping Sherlock’s ass, pulling him up. Sherlock wrapped his legs around John’s hips, and John shuddered against him.
“Welcome back, love.”
“But she calls me
“Maryle. You know her, right? Small, cute, kind of bouncy?”
John shook his head.
“Could be a him.”
“Do you want to talk about the preputial mucosa?”
Greg snorted. “Are you kidding? He wasn’t interested in meeting any of my friends, especially the women. I don’t think he met a single person I hang out with unless he couldn’t escape the introduction, or he wanted to fuck them.”
Sherlock trailed his fingers in a full arc from the top of John’s cleft to his perineum, brushing over puckered skin on his way. He didn’t stop there, didn’t pay that spot any more attention than anywhere else, but still John shivered and moaned.
“Why thirty back, why not twenty?”
Sherlock doesn’t realize they’ve come to a stop until he hears Anahera next to him, begging.
John made a rather sexy squeaking noise, and came hard, all over the bridge of Sherlock’s nose, his forehead, and into his hair. Sherlock wished he’d thought to measure the output, but without his digital pocket scale and a baseline to compare it to, what was the point? That would have to wait for another day, another experiment.
“I want to get married. I want to spend the rest of my life with the same person, because I want that kind of continuity, and the opportunity to grow old together with someone. I want to know someone as well as I can know them. It’s a big decision for me, and I guess I want to make sure I don’t leave any stone unturned.”
“What about any surveillance cameras in the village itself?” John asked. “Maybe there’s footage of someone walking into town and being picked up?”
“Please. Neither of us will rest well knowing that you were on your own in some dingy room. And this way, I can ask you any other questions that I might think of.” Sherlock glanced over at John, who was staring at Sherlock with such a look of utter appreciation and adoration on his face, Sherlock immediately looked down at his own feet and swallowed the lump in his throat.
Thank you, happierstill!
Mycroft didn’t look at him as he put his phone away. “We would all like that very much, I think. Yes.”
“Your closet?”
“Yeah. Much different than a finger or two.”
“How could I not? You’re amazing.”
“We’ll definitely spend it together, but we haven’t talked about where we’ll go. Fortunately, we both have the same week off, from March 14th through the 18th.” Sherlock had checked both their schools’ calendars back in August, wanting to know then if they wouldn’t be able to see each other. Thanksgiving and Christmas had taken precedence when it came to planning, though.
“Ika, not far from her in his own realm of the night sky, witnessed her suffering. He tried to help her, to encourage her, but she was unresponsive even to her own family.
“Mmhm.”
Anahera’s smile blooms. “Do you know, I’m not sure anyone has ever asked me that. Yes, Sherlock. I am well. It does not harm me. In fact,” she says as she moves closer and nudges him back into the line of marching pengs, “it often works to my advantage.”
“Yeah. That’s … yeah.”
Shall I unwrap you?
Erebus, however, has not only noticed them, but has taken on the countenance of a perturbed peng who has had entirely enough of someone else’s nonsense. John’s left wing is spasming against Sherlock’s right.
They faced each other, less than a pillow’s width between them. John stroked his hand over the side of Sherlock’s face, trailed his fingers down his neck and let it rest there. John’s hand was a warm welcome on Sherlock’s skin, a slow hello, and Sherlock leaned into that warmth, stretching his neck, tilting his head back. John smiled and petted him, running his hand up and down into Sherlock’s hair and along his shoulder. Sherlock shimmied a little closer. John gripped Sherlock’s upper arm and squeezed and Sherlock settled his hand on John’s waist.
He's distracted now, anyway, searching for John in the crowd while trying to look blasé in front of his mother. If all of these blasted penguins would simply shut up already, maybe he'd be able to hear John's call. He cranes his neck higher right in time to see several of his neighbours startle, lose their balance, and fall, complaining as they scatter. John appears in their wake, flustered and dishevelled, but beaming up at him.
“You’re not dying, love, you’ll be fine in a day or two.”
“Sherlock.”
John leans into Sherlock and whispers, “Maybe that’s why Mycroft hasn’t mated. Maybe no one likes his song.”
“It depends on who she is working with, if anyone, and where that co-conspirator waits,” Mycroft explains. “And we have no information whatsoever pertinent to that eventuality.”
Thank you, KA.
Sherlock blinked, pursed his lips, blinked some more, and leaned down as far as he could. He inspected the creature, recording the data and running it through his mental files:
"Some of ours, some of theirs. In time I’m sure she and her friends will develop their own."
“Yeah, she knows. She doesn’t approve, though, so it’s no surprise she hasn’t mentioned it. It’s been a bit rough, to be honest.”
John nodded and pulled back enough to meet his eye. “I understand. I’ll give you as little or as much space as you need. Whatever makes you comfortable.”
“NoNo?”
John nods. "But sometimes those are the same."
On the second day of their marriage, Sherlock woke up the same way he had on their first day: wrapped around his husband. He lay there for a few minutes, trying to convince himself to trust in the solidity and warmth in his arms, trying to trust himself to enjoy the sensations without jumping out of bed and fleeing, but after a few short minutes of cataloguing the feeling of John’s body rising and falling with breath and the sweet smell of the back of his neck, Sherlock did indeed get up and flee. He stood in the bathroom and stripped out of his wedding garments, then traced the path up and down his arms that John’s hands had taken the night before.
John hums and moves behind Sherlock, keeping one wing on him the whole time. Sherlock feels John's chin on his shoulder, and his chest and belly against his back, and then his breath in his ear.
"John, think about it."
“Nice set up, right?”
Olive beams.
Happy Independence Day. American or not, may you enjoy and cherish your freedoms, and respect them, and honor them.
(b) Sentence. Solicitation of a sexual act is a Class B misdemeanor.

Oh, Mycroft. Mycroft would be very concerned if Sherlock had a fever, wouldn’t he? That wouldn’t be at all fair to his brother. Sherlock shook his head and angled his chin far enough from John’s chest that the others could hear him. “I’m okay. It’s just a stomach ache. I probably ate and drank too much.”
They lay in silence, spent, drifting.
“I usually don’t go to bed until I think I can’t stand up anymore, otherwise, I end up lying awake for hours on end, and that’s boring. I don’t usually watch television.”
How much of himself would he lose by giving himself to someone else? Would he be expected to become someone lesser than who he believed himself to be now, through the process of compromise and sacrifice, or would his union with John create someone stronger and more complex due to the very same dynamics? And what about the intimacy? How was it possible to give so freely of absolutely everything one was and not be altered? To lose complete physical and mental control at the hands of someone else was against everything Sherlock valued. And yet, when he thought of John and his smile, his hands, his mouth, he understood why people did the things they did together.
