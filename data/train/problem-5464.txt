“I know and its okay. I'm done running, I promise.” Cas nodded. “You were right. I was trying to find an excuse to end this. I don't know why, I didn't even realise I was doing it. But after the past two weeks… I never want to feel like that again, ever. I love you, Cas. I am willing to make this work if you are.”
Dean couldn't help his eyes going wide with shock. He hated it here. He didn't want to be here. Dean slowly started to back away, his eyes filling with tears that threatened to spill. That drink he was thinking about having earlier didn't sound half bad now. He just wanted to forget. He wanted to run. But he promised. He'd made a promise and he needed to prove to Cas that he was willing to try, even if he hated being with him.
Sam rolls his eyes. “He's gone.” As if that was suppose to explain everything.
The music once more is turned to full volume and Sam closes his eyes, enjoying this small moment of relief. He knows that the reason he's here is because the demon is up to something, something she doesn't want him to be privy of. He isn't bothered. This is better than whatever she's got planned. It has to be.
He pulled away then and looked down at Dean. He could see the guilt. “It's okay. You didn't know I would be like this. I didn't even know that.” He leant down and kissed him again, softer, caressing his tongue with his own.
Dean placed his lips on Cas's again, gentle and loving as he wrapped his hand around Cas's arousal, gripping it firmly. Cas groaned with pleasure and bucked his hips up into Dean's hand. Slowly, he started to move his hand up and then down, twisting gently with each move. Cas squirmed beneath him, breaking away from the kiss, throwing his head back, eyes closed. Dean watched in awe as Cas, angel of the lord, started to come undone in front of his eyes. He started to speed up the process, wiping the tip of his finger across the bulging head of the erection. Cas shivered and groaned again. Dean felt the wetness of the pre-cum and he briefly wondered what it would taste like.
Before he knew it, they were pulling into there motel. He turned to gaze at the man next to him. That amazing, fantastically sexy man. His eyes wouldn't meet his. Was he uncomfortable? Maybe he hadn't meant to kiss him, maybe he regretted it. That thought sent a jolt of pain through his chest. He fought the urge to rub against it, clenching his hands into fists, his nails digging into the palms.
On his knees behind the angel, he slowly, cautiously, wrapped his arms around the man, linking his hands at his hard chest. With a deep breath, he leant his head against the hard muscles of his back. As the contentment filled him, he fought against the urge to remove himself from Cas. He wasn't suppose to feel this, not after everything, but once again told himself that this wasn't about him, this was about Cas.
“You don't know that.” Cas's voice is full of the pain and Dean can't help but soften his own features. He knows how much this hurts the angel, knows how much guilt he is dealing with after the fall. The last thing he needs is Dean making it worse for him.
is pulsing strong, driving him to twist his fingers together harder, making them white from the pressure. If he looks at Cas, he will certainly give into the care the angel is offering and he can't do that. He can't allow that because he shouldn't have gotten blind drunk last night, he shouldn't have clouded his mind like that, not when his brother needs him.
Reluctantly, he pushed away, watching with satisfaction as Dean moved his own hips, following him, needing the contact back. Cas just smiled down at him, gripped his hips and rolled him to his stomach. Dean gasped, but didn't have time to do anything as Cas pulled him up to his hands and knees.
Dean's eyes grew wide as the words echoed in his mind. “What?” his voice sounded vulnerable and exposed and he hated himself for that.
Dean held up his hand, silencing him. “No. That's the end of it. No more sharing time. I'm done. Let's...” His eyes roamed over Cas's face. “Let's forget that any of this ever happened.” He nodded and turned.
“Same here.” He allowed his voice to soften a little. Allowed his eyes to show he meant those words, that no matter what they were both going through, nothing would change. He'd expected Cas to soften his gaze, he always did. A pain shot through his chest when Cas just nodded simply and turned back to his pacing. What the hell? He knew he'd hurt Cas, knew they were both hurting, but why the hell was he acting this way?
An ache flared in his chest as he watched Dean move around the crime scene. Dean hadn't been able to look at him since their moment in the motel room and it hurt. Castiel hated how his feelings were making him feel. He hated how he ached to be close to Dean again. But most of all he hated himself for the way he was making Dean feel. He knew Dean was uncomfortable with the whole situation, knew he struggling to come to terms with it, struggling to keep his frustration and anger in check, the broken hand was evidence enough. He watched Deans face as he moved behind the counter. It was full of curiosity as his eyes darted from item to item, trying to find something that will help the case.
His heart tugged painfully and he wondered if he should call the angel, just to confirm what he already knew. Deep down he knew. Cas was gone and he wasn't coming back. He should be angry with him, should want to punch the guy. Especially after he begged Dean not to run away from him last night. Against his better judgement he couldn't do it, couldn't find the strength.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel moved across the room in one swift movement, leaving them inches apart. His smile softened, his eyes serious. He could feel the heat rise through his body at the close proximity. “I said I needed to make sure the angels are okay after Naomi. I did not say I would be staying to assistant them.”
Sam's eyes narrowed in frustration. “Out. Probably gone to a bar.”
Dean rolled his eyes. Guess he had been right about what his brother was thinking, and he was just standing there, passing judgement on the two of them, when he had no clue what had just passed. “I know we have Jack to find, but… but we had a little argument, nothing big and it wiped him out. We'll help tomorrow. I don't really wanna wake him.”
“Because...” He took in a deep breath and stared Cas right in the eye. He could do it. He could do it. He could do it. “Because I love you.”
“Did you forget about Jack?”
“I need to separate myself from my emotions, its the only way to do it, because it will hurt less, or at least I hope it will.”
Please let me know what you thought!!!
“I'm need to run.” It was barely a whisper, but he knew Cas had heard him because in the next instant, Cas was moving towards him, relief written in his eyes.
The grip tightened again on his neck as its head bent once more, sniffing at his skin, inhaling Dean's scent. “I'm here to destroy you,” it snarled as it looked up again.
Standing on shaky legs, he gripped his night stand, releasing his chest. Carefully, he turned and glanced down at the man lying in the middle of his bed. All he could think of was how he was suppose to survive this, how was he suppose to go on? Then there was all things he would miss out, they plagued his mind and he clutched at his head with his other hand, trying to rid himself of the thoughts. Never would he see his eyes, hear his voice. Never would he kiss him. Never would he see him smile. Never would he get to feel his body up against his… and so on.
Dean sighed, closing his eyes and Cas found himself wondering what he was thinking. Would he be careless enough to ask the dreaded questions. He hoped not. He hoped that he would just let it be. Instead of questions, Cas was shocked by what the hunter said next. Still with his eyes closed, as though he was afraid to look Cas in the eye as he whispered his, “I'm sorry.”
Dean sucked in a sharp breath as that thought passed through his mind. That was the first time he'd ever thought something like that. He'd always thought as him as sexy, never adorable. The silence extended before him and he found he needed to break it again, if only to distract himself from his own thoughts. “Talk to me, Cas.”
How long was this going to last? Just like he's never experienced heart break, he'd never experienced rejection either. How long would it be before he gets over it? How long till he can look Dean in the eyes again without feeling so broken? How long till he was comfortable enough to let his guard down again? This was going to be torture and he knew it.
“Yes, there's been another angel attack. Only this one is bigger than a couple of people in a hotel room. This one has struck a whole diner. Only one survivor, a seven year old girl. The only child in the building at the time.”
It didn't take long for Cas to answer. “Hello?” That gruff voice sent a thrill rushing through him and he urgently pushed it back.
Dean's eyes widened in surprise. “What? He said that?”
The tears came freely, flowing fast and hot. Cas didn't turn, didn't look at him and that just made the tears come even faster. “Do what?”
The doubt and pain evaporated from his heart, only for it to swell with joy and happiness. But he was also very mindful of what Cas was doing. Yet again he was being selfless, he was putting Dean first, allowing him to have an out, allowing him to go back on what he'd said. He was allowing Dean to walk away if that was what he truly wanted.
He opens up the search bar and starts searching local news. There has to be something that indicates something happening. Maybe his brother has been found, seriously hurt, and is going by John Doe or something. With that thought, he jumps up from the table and grabs his phone from the bed. Its only a small town, so only one hospital and one morgue. He feels sick as he makes the calls. Sighs with frustration when the hospital hasn't got a John Doe by Sam's description or anyone matching the names he gives them. The sickness intensifies as he makes the call to the morgue and yells with increased frustration as they haven't received anyone either. Silently he's relieved that his brother isn't dead, at the same time he wants this not knowing to be over. Its like being in limbo. Is his brother hurt? Is he being tortured? Is he already dead and they just haven't found his body yet?
Cas rolled his eyes. “No, Dean. We are not okay. Our lives are in danger.”
“Cas?” He watched as Cas's body stiffened with tension and Dean had never hated himself more. The tears finally came then, no longer able to hold them back. This is what he's become now, an emotional wreck. Somehow he was okay with that.
It could hear murmurs from within this bunkers walls, nothing distinguishable, as it sent out a wave of dark energy towards the next sigil. These symbols were powerful, more so than anything he'd felt before, nothing its powers couldn't handle, though. Raising the vessels arms, he set the power hurtling towards the symbol. Nothing happened for a moment, but then the earth shook, the symbol lit up a sparkling red. It is a strange symbol, one it has never encountered before. Most of these drawings were squiggly lines, triangles, squares and circles. Different patterns. It would almost go as far as saying they were beautiful, especially when lit up the way they are.
“I think we should continue on the case like nothings changed. We'll just have to be more vigilant.”
Cas spread his arms wide. “I'm here. Kill me if you must, just leave Dean be.”
He felt strong arms wrap around him, heard a soft mumbling in his ear, he couldn't hear what he was saying, all he could hear was the blood pumping loudly. He looked at the man who was holding him. His eyes were sad and filled with guilt.
Dean couldn't move, couldn't breath. He watched his brother nod in his direction before heading towards the kitchen. He watched Sam until he was out of sight, it was only after that, he allowed himself to breath. Now was not the time to have this crisis with his brother. Instead he pulled his cell out of his pocket, checked it was on and fully charged, then sat down at the map table, placing his cell gently in front of him.
How the hell was he going to look at Cas the same? This was different now. This wasn't thinking about Cas and what Cas wanted to do to him. He knew Cas wanted him in every way possible. But Dean had been the one to imagine it. It shouldn't be like this. He shouldn't feel this way.
It catches a glimpse of itself in a reflection and if it had eyebrows like this human, it would frown. It has never seen itself before, never had the occasion to. It notices its like liquid. Black, swirling liquid. Its fascinating.
Cas knew it was coming. He tried to brace himself for it. Tried to prepare himself for it. He could feel the tears springing to his eyes already. He wanted to stop him from saying any more, wanted to stop him from bringing Castiel back to reality.
“I'm okay, Dean,” he whispered. “We're okay. Its going to be okay.”
Another deep breath. “Your promise. No more running?”
“I know.” Cas snapped his eyes back to Dean's in shock. “I understand, Cas. I pushed you to breaking point and now...” he took a step forward, but not allowing himself to touch the angel, if he did, he knew he would break. “You're scared. It's okay.”
He looks at the clock on the wall. Its been an hour. Another hour to wait. He opens the door to the motel and steps out. The sun is bright and he has to squint at first. When his eyes adjust to the light, he looks up and down the street, hoping to see his brother walk round the corner at any moment. But he doesn't. Of course he doesn't. He sighs and walks back into the stuffy motel room. Its the middle of summer and the room is hotter than outside.
“No change?” Sam had been to shower. He'd always ask the same question every time he left, and he'd always know the answer, but needing to hear it all the same. Castiel simply shook his head. Sam placed himself on the opposite side of the bed.
Dean's eyes softened. “Of course it matters to me.”
Emptiness. Hollow.
The tears kept coming. He looked over his shoulder at the hunter. He had his eyes shut, his mouth hung open and his fingers dug deep into Castiel's hip. Then he started moving, slowly. Castiel felt his body slide up the table by the force of the push, felt the cock throb within him, hitting that sweet spot inside him. The pleasure was what made this feeling worse.
His mother pushed past him, muttering something like how she'd go. Thank God, is all Dean could have thought. He looked from his brother to the angel and they both showed signs of gratefulness. None of them had ever dealt with anything like this before and none of them wanted to.
“Dean, you ki-”
- SUPERNATURAL -
Dean stood, his legs no longer shaky, thank God. He moved to the door and inhaled a steadying breath. He could do this. Opening it, he found his brother was already gathering their weapons. Cas was stood by the motel door. Dean instantly looked away and tried to concentrate on getting his own weapon. He knew what he needed to do to get through this. He needed to pretend the angel wasn't even there. He could do that. Course he could. Dodging things, feelings, was what he was good at. He was the master of it. But as they all shuffled out of the room and over to the Impala, he found it more and more difficult to ignore the guy. His presence was just so there. All he needed to do was reach out and brush his fingers against him. No, he couldn't. His fingers twitched and he fisted them.
He turned to leave. “Why?”
Castiel nodded. “Secondly, yes I promise I won't leave you by trying to protect you, but I need that same promise from you. I know what you're like, Dean, and I know you will do whatever it takes to
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's eyes filled with panic and terror and it made Castiel's heart jump painfully in his chest at the sight. He didn't want to hurt him, didn't want to send him into a panic. “You don't want what?” His voice was shaken. He was terrified. Castiel took a step closer but froze when Dean visually shrank back. “If… if you don't want this, Cas, I will understand. I've hurt you too many times to count. I wouldn't blame you.” He shrugged casually as if it was no big deal, but Castiel knew him better than that. He was bothered by the idea, really bothered.
“Okay. I will. Take care, Cas.”
“It hurt when you said you were trying to get over me.”
His heart stopped. Fear pulsed through him. Of course they would go after the Winchesters. Why wouldn't they?
Cas took a step closer to him and Dean fought the urge to run to him. God he wanted him so much. He flexed his fingers in agitation. “Do you want me to walk away?” Cas sounded cautious, like he was trying to herd in a wild animal, and in a way that was what Dean was, a wild animal in need of taming. Dean shook his head. “Do you want me to stay as a friend?” The last word was a whisper and Dean knew how much strength it had taken for Cas to say it. Dean shook his head. “What do you want, Dean?”
“I want you, Cas. I shouldn't. We shouldn't. We will only get hurt. But… I can't help but be selfish. I  want you, all of you.”
In the end, the decision was taken out of both their hands.
“Do not assume you know anything about how I feel, Dean”
“Yeah, Cas, you don't need to explain anything to us. We know its pretty much impossible.” Sam's turn to grip his shoulder in a reassuring manner. Castiel was at a loss for words. They didn't believe a word the other angel had said. He should have been relieved by that. But he wasn't. They didn't believe it because they didn't believe he could feel that way. His heart broke even more when the realisation hit, pain shooting through his chest and for a moment he'd forgotten how to breath. Dean would never believe it because it was impossible for him to come to terms with something like this. This was a rejection whether Dean knew it or not.
“That's not it. You and I both know that.”
Castiel backed up, his eyes narrowing. “That makes no sense.”
“No, its not. I lost control and… Its just...”
Castiel felt the sting of rejection, like so many times before. It felt like he was almost growing accustomed to it now. He replayed the scene in his head, watching as the flicker of hurt crossed Dean's face, then his walls building back up and shifting into place. Dean was pushing him away again and he knew that he couldn't go anywhere, not with his promise echoing around his mind. He promised he would be there whenever Dean was going to run, promised he would wait. But should he? How many more times are they going to go through these motions?
As he watched the Impala pull away with screeching tires and Kelly driving, he cursed at the foolishness of leaving his keys on the seat. He knew where they were heading. He fixed up Cas's shitty truck and followed, again through the night. Sam stayed quiet, knowing too well that getting Dean to talk at the moment was not a good idea and Dean was silently grateful.
Castie let out a sigh of his own. He suddenly felt very tired. He hated these yo-yo emotions. One minute he would be sad and angry and disappointed and the next he'd be confused and hopeful. Sometimes all at the same time. “I can't talk to him, Sam. He's made it very clear how he feels.”
“Dean, of course I want this.” Dean's eyes brightened for a moment, happiness filling them, then confusion took over.
- SUPERNATURAL -
Real life was getting in the way. But later, later he would make sure there would be no interruptions because he was planning on showing him just how much he loved him. Over and over again.
-SUPERNATURAL -
He can feel her smirk at him, can feel that she's pleased he's finally caught on. Then she whispers in his ear.
Cas smiled and reached down, lifting his t-shirt, up and over his head, throwing it to the side, not caring where it landed. He reached up with his head and placed a gentle, a barely there, kiss to his chest, right where the heart would sit. Dean hummed at the contact, closing his eyes in contentment. When Cas pulled away and put his head back down onto the soft mattress, Dean opened his eyes again, smiling as well. He understood him, understood what that one gesture meant, making him dive in for another kiss. This time it was more fierce, more urgent, as though he couldn't get enough of him, clutching to him as though he would never do this again.
Then Cas was gone. Dean blinked, dropping his hands to his sides. He caught sight of Cas standing over by the long table. He was breathing heavy, the lust darkening his eyes and his mouth was red and wet. The sight of him sent shocks through his body. God he looked perfect. But why the hell did he stop? He didn't want him to stop.
Dean furrowed his brows in confusion for a moment. Then it clicked. His heart sped up and his breaths were coming fast. Cas was continuing their conversation. He flicked his eyes to his brother nervously. Cas glanced over his shoulder at Sam, who was standing with wide eyes, his mouth clamped shut in disapproval.
“It meant everything to me, Dean.”
Castiel watched as Dean became wary, concerned for his heart. He had every right to be, he had every right to try and protect himself. “Are you saying that?”
Dean smiled crookedly, shyly. Then it dropped, his eyes growing sad again. He sighed and realisation came to his face. Castiel watched as he came to a decision. He was about to say something he probably didn't want to. “I can't feel that for you because… you mean too much to me. You… you deserve so much better.”
“Don't I get a say?” Dean froze, his hand hovering over the door handle. “You've said what you needed to say. What about me? Don't I get to say my peace?”
They finally made it to Dean's room. Castiel glanced at the guns that littered the wall as he let go of Dean's hand, reluctantly. His eyes swept across the desk, the pictures, the bed. He heard the soft click of the door. He knew what he needed to do and the jolt of the pain at the thought made him feel sick. He didn't want to do it. He didn't want to risk Dean accepting this solely for him. He slowly turned around. His eyes caught Dean's green ones, the were full of worry as he leant casually against the door, his arms folded and his one foot firmly planted against the wooden door.
One last night of feeling like this. One night only.
Dean looked like he wanted to be anywhere else, anywhere that wasn't here having this conversation. “There can't be any feelings involved, Cas. That can't happen. That condition… its non-negotiable. You need to think about this, like, really think about it. Because… if you can't do that, then tell me now.”
But everything always had to end. He thought of how much the needed to end this before someone came looking, but at the same time he didn't want to rush. He brushed his hand down Dean's stomach, gently, going lower and lower, until he reached Dean's erection, gripping it firmly in his grasp. Dean bucked into him, groaning into Cas's mouth as he licked and swirled their tongues together.
Dean licked his lips and nodded. “Of course I want to. But… if it happens, and that's a big 'if', then I need to know that this is it. No more running off, no more doing things on your own. No more trying to protect me. You can't end it again like this, Cas. If you come to realise that you don't want this, then I can accept that… but knowing you want this and need this as much as me but you won't have it because of some stupid reasoning that you need to protect me, I can't take it.”
“You have a problem. Not we.” He watched the little girl throw the last piece of her bread. She pulled herself up, her feet soaked. With a smile, she ran towards her parents. The warm sun shining off of her blonde curls as they bounced along with her. Oh, how he wished he could have her innocence.

Castiel sucked in a sharp breath. His chest hurt again at Sam's words, his heart breaking. Is that what Dean was going to do? Keep them both sweet while he went off to get his fill from other women? Sam's eyes widened and Castiel knew he hadn't meant to say all of that, not to him anyway. “I need to leave.” His voice was trembling and he hated himself for it. He couldn't hide his pain from Sam. If he couldn't do that he wasn't going to be able to hide it from Dean either.
“Yes. At first I thought Castiel being here might have been a problem to my plans. But, in fact, I can work with it. Because when I'm through, Castiel is going to want to be as far away from Dean Winchester as possible.”
When Dean looked up, he saw the sadness and pain shining from them. This was hurting him, too. The anger was slowly igniting again. What gave him the right to hurt because of this? This was, after all, his decision. “You're a coward,” he spat through gritted teeth.
“No. I'm not saying that. I'm saying, time and time again you forgive us… me. You forgive me when you really shouldn't.”
The way it feels under his hand is disturbing and he wants to rip it away, but it dawns on him that she wants him to feel this, wants him to know what its like to get close to taking a life like this. An innocent life. But she has other plans. She pulls out a knife and scrapes it down the side of this man's face, blood following in its wake, while she keeps the choke hold firm. The man tries to yelp, but nothing comes out.
Cas smiled shyly then, shame filling him. He had been quick to judge and he felt the guilt swim through him but ignored it and favoured the warm feeling that his words gave him as the realisation hit. But he needed to clarify what this meant. “So… you don't want me to leave?”
“It means you want to come with me, be with me.”
Castiel sighed, the dissatisfaction shining through. “If you don't give me one good reason, Dean, I won't be responsible for what happens next.”
“They are warming up,” Naomi continued as though she had read his mind. “What do you love above all else, Castiel?” Before he could even answer, she answered for him. “The Winchesters.”
Castiel swung around to Sam, seeing his eyes angry and his mouth set in a firm line. His jaw jutted out at an odd angle. Confusion once again pushed forwards. “What did he mean, Sam? What demands?”
“Don't worry, Sammy. We'll be gentle. I promise.”
But he had to try, didn't he? Of course he had to. He took in a steadying breath and knocked lightly. A small gruff 'yeah' sounded on the other side of the door, muffled and sad. He slowly pushed open the door cautiously, afraid of what was going to happen next.
Shit. He'd really fucked up. But then, what's new? He was a complete fuck up. A complete disgrace. He wasn't worthy of Cas, never had been, never will be. But… But he wanted to be deserving of him. Wanted to feel him. Wanted to feel those lips on his. Wanted to see that smile and happiness back on his face as he realised what Dean kissing him had meant.
Sam was talking, and Cas, well Cas was laughing. He looked totally free, free of any pain and guilt. It was like he hadn't been stewing in any negative emotions, he hadn't been thinking about Dean.
- SUPERNATURAL -
The demons come forward, all five of them, circling him. Then he's free and being shoved to the hard floor. It hurts his back, but he fights, he fights with everything he has in him. He will not go willingly, he will not allow them to do whatever it is they are going to do. His brother would never forgive him if he didn't. But its also not in his nature to go quietly.
A knock startled him and he froze. It was Sam. Who else would it be? But did he really want to answer. His brother was sporting a disapproval look, he thought to himself. He's probably come to lecture him about what had happened out in the library, or he's come to get more information on the matter. Either one didn't sound appealing. He gulped past the lump in his throat as he waited silently, not daring to move, hoping he would hear his brother sigh in defeat on the other side of the door before moving away. Dean would be able to hear his footsteps growing quieter and quieter, and with each step he would sag even more with relief that yet again he dodged another bullet.
Castiel kissed him gently, right on the middle of his back before leaning up and lubing his fingers. He rubbed the lube against Dean's puckered hole, feeling the warmth, pressing the tip of his nail in. There wouldn't be any need for much preparation. He'd already used his grace twice, any discomfort  Dean would feel, he could take it away, simple as that. Dean groaned, pushing backwards, needing more. But Cas pulled away, leaving Dean wanting and huffing in frustration.
Then she's there. Smiling. Dean's body disappears and he's no longer on a winding road in the middle of no where. He's awake and looking out at a motel. She starts whispering cruel things in his ear, like how this is just the beginning. She loves seeing him twist with agony. But for now she wants him to be awake for this. He tries to catch his breath, tries to stop the panic from swelling inside. If this is just the start, what else has she got planned? He can't think about that, not at the moment, not while he knows that she's got him awake for something much worse.

“I will always love you, Dean.”
Dean gripped Cas's hand and intertwined their fingers. The touch was so intimate and held so much meaning. “You miss one deadline, Cas, and I'm coming to find you. You got that?”
Cas won't be able to track Sam but he might be able to track the damn demons. He pulls out his phone and pulls up Cas's number, fingers trembling with nervousness. He hates how the thought of talking to the angel makes him feel, hates how it makes him a quivering mess. But he pushes on. This is for Sam and he takes in a deep breath before putting the phone to his ear.
- SUPERNATURAL -
Dean looked at his brother, a questioning look in his eyes. His eyes flicked quickly to Castiel then back to his brother. Castiel also looked at Sam. “There's nothing here.”
They move over to the stairs and start moving up them, his feet clanging against the metal. Two flights of stairs later, the finally reach the right door. He raps on it, the sound echoing around them. There's no answer and he gives Cas a look that says
Cas tilts his head and frowns slightly and Dean almost bursts out laughing at the familiar sight. “No, I'm sorry.”
Unfortunately, Castiel understood this. He didn't want to understand, he wanted to fight Dean on this one. But he couldn't bring himself to do it. “If I go, will I still have you to come back to?” Somehow he needed to know, he needed to know that Dean would wait for him, no matter how long  this took.
But he wasn't heartbroken. He couldn't be. He wasn't in love. This isn't love. There is no way this is love.
Dean had bared his heart out now, admitting that Cas could destroy him. Dean had come to the same conclusion Cas had. That should be enough to hope. But he couldn't hope, he couldn't put himself in that position again. Dean had been right in saying he was running, too. He hadn't even realised he was doing it. How can he ask Dean not to do that if he was doing it as well?
The pictures of their kisses in the past, of the times in this bed, started pushing their way forward, replacing what he would never have again, to the ones he had once experienced. The kiss against the Impala, the kiss on the side walk, the way he had felt so full of Cas before being taken away by that stupid case. The way he smelled, the way he tasted… all of it was starting to consume him.
He could do this. He could do this for Cas, for him, for them. He gripped Cas's bare shoulders and pulled back. “I… I need you.” Cas tilted his head in confusion. Dean coughed nervously. He didn't want to say it. So instead he grabbed the angels cock in his fist again. Cas groaned with the pleasure of it. Dean smiled and spread his legs, placing the cock at the hole. As Dean pressed it hard, he felt the burning pain already. He tried to distract himself from the pain by kissing Cas again, but Cas pulled back, his eyes wide with shock.
He forces his eyes open, ignoring the initial stinging and glances at the woman that's coming towards him. She's beautiful. All blonde hair, big boobs, and long legs. But he ignores that and concentrates on the evil smile on her red lips. Because she's not human, far from it and he's her prisoner.
All he can hear is the traffic on the highway in the distance. A door slams somewhere nearby and Cas is silent, watching him. The urge to send him a
“Are you okay?”
Cas didn't move, didn't relax. “I can't do this any more, Dean.”
Dean releases his shoulders, narrowing his eyes in on him, his heart sinking at those words. “Yeah. I know. But that's not what kept you from finding Sam. That's not what's on your mind. So how about the truth?” Watching him shift uncomfortably brought a lot of painful memories back and the terror of that, the panic came on strong. “Just… tell me its something I don't need to worry about… just tell me its not something bad.”
When his coughs died out, he peeked at his brother out the corner of his eyes and what he saw broke his heart. Sam was not just worried for him, he was devastated, heartbroken and looked completely helpless. He knew in the pit of his stomach that Sam didn't have a clue how to help Cas, help his older brother. The brotherly urge to wrap him up and give him all his strength, pushed forward. He could protect his brother, needed to protect him. He shouldn't feel any of this pain, shouldn't feel the loss of Cas.
He took a few steadying breaths, feeling the burn lessen slightly. He knew it wouldn't completely go, not yet. He nodded. Cas pushed in that little bit further. More burning. Dean couldn't take it any more. He didn't want slow and careful. He needed him now, needed to feel the angel's cock fill him. He wanted to ride him, bring them both to explosion. So what if it hurt? Maybe it would be like a band-aid, fast is best.
Cas's eyes widened with shock and hope. “Why?”
What does it smell? He has gone through some hard times and has survived, that much is glaringly obvious. He has suffered and come out the other side, if this was the definition of strong...
Castiel nodded. He pulled away, watching as Dean showed confusion. He smiled at the other man, showing him he was okay with this, but he was also a little amused. “As much fun as it would be, Dean, I'm not going to take you up against the door. Maybe next time, though.” Dean's eyes darkened with lust at his words. Good. That's exactly what Castiel had intended. His smirk soon vanished when he held out his hand for Dean to take. He took it willingly. When their skin made contact it sent a bolt of electricity shooting up Castiel's arm, making his breath hitch and stutter. When he spoke again, his voice was sot and full of the love that he was so accustomed to feeling. But now he was was able to show it and it made him so happy, so elated. “Our first time isn't going to be rushed. It needs to be gentle and soft and perhaps somewhere comfortable. I want to show you just how much I love you, Dean. We'll have plenty of time to give into the desperate need we are certainly both feeling. But for now, I need this to be slow.”
Anger surged forwards and Dean narrowed his eyes at his little brother. What gave him the right to tell him what he can and can't do? Nothing. This had nothing to do with Sam. With the panic pushed aside, he allowed the anger to talk for him. “And why not? So what if I kissed the guy? What's the big problem?”
How long had it been? Four, five hours? Dean looked so peaceful, more peaceful than he'd ever seen him in sleep before. His heart swelled at the sight, knowing that Cas had something to do with his contentment.
Castiel tilted his head to the side again. Is that what he thought happened? “No. I knew, right from the beginning that you didn't love me, Dean. I knew what I was getting into when I first touched you.” It was Dean's turn to be confused. “I had allowed myself to hope, just for a moment. But the longer it went on the more I realised I couldn't do it, not if you didn't love me in return. You can't help that you have no feelings for me. This isn't your fault. You need to stop blaming yourself. None of this is your fault.”
Dean's smile vanished and his eyes popped open in shock. Castiel didn't give him a chance to gather his thoughts, he vanished with a flutter of his wings, anger still coursing through him.
He smiled down at him, kissed him one more time then got up.
Licking his dry lips, he nods. Finding words has always been hard for him, even with Sam, and he finds it even harder to form a coherent sentence while looking into Cas's eyes. He shouldn't feel this way, shouldn't be left feeling like his brain has melted. He does though. He scans his eyes across Cas's face. He's doing the head tilt thing with narrowed eyes, looking like he really doesn't believe Dean. His hair is all scruffy and Dean's fingers twitch with the need of running them across his scalp. He manages to resist. Cas wouldn't appreciate that, he might even go as far as smiting him if necessary. The angel isn't use to his to touch, not like that anyway. Inside he feels like he's weeping like Niagara Falls, on the outside he forces a smile to curl his lips. He thinks Cas knows it might be fake, but thankfully doesn't question him further. Nodding himself, he stands and turns his back to him.
He pushed his car forward, trying to drown out his thoughts of the dead angel that he'd left behind. He knew he would have to deal with the body sooner or later, but for right now he needed to focus on finding Jack.
He thought to what could happen if allowed this, if he allowed himself this little slice of happiness. Dean could hurt him. Cas could hurt him. But they could laugh, they could smile, they could be happy. And the sex? From what they'd already experienced before, the sex could be really amazing. Then he thought to what would happen if he told Cas to leave, that they couldn't do this. Cas would only come when needed. Cas would finally stop loving him, moving on with his life. They would never be able to be friends, not like they were before, there would always be this tension between them.
Another groan as he shifted so he was lying on his back. His eyes glazed over as he stared at the ceiling. His thoughts were running a million miles an hour. All about the one and only angel in a trench coat. He hoped Cas would be okay. He wondered briefly what steps Cas would take to ensure he got over Dean.
He closed his eyes tightly, willing himself to take a breath. After what seemed like too long, his lungs finally allowed oxygen back in and he was able to breath once more. He opened his eyes again and was shocked that Cas had moved across the room without being heard. He was now standing at the other end of the table, opposite him, that stupid sad look written upon his face still.
Another honk of the car and Dean glowered. He placed one tiny kiss upon his lips and put some distance between them. He looked through the passenger window just as another honk sounded. “We get the fucking picture, Sam.”
“You don't know if you can risk it,” Dean finished for him. He stayed silent, afraid to admit it. “I get it. I really do.”
Dean rolled his eyes but smiled all the same. He sat and went to climb off the bed but another urgency fuelled his voice. He waited for Dean to set his eyes upon him, a question in them. “I love you.”
Thank you for reading.
The hurt pushed its way to Cas's face. Dean frowned then his eyes blew wide open in understanding. He brought his hand up and brushed his thumb over Cas's swollen lips. The angel closed his eyes at the touch. “Look at me, Cas.” It took a moment and when he opened his eyes Dean saw the pain there. They were begging him not to end this. “I didn't mean us. I meant this right here. I'm not ready.” Relief filled those blue eyes and he hated what he was about to say next, but he needed Cas to understand what was at stake here, he needed to understand where Dean stood. “I don't know if I'll ever be ready.”
No! It's not his fault. Never his fault. He was so pure and loving. That's all he wanted, wasn't it? For Dean to love him back? “Yes, you should have.” His voice was croaky from all the crying, the screaming. “You can't… you shouldn't feel… You deserve so much more.”
Dean frowned. “Why would she be in a place like that?”
Cas thumped his head back against the door and closed his eyes. “That was before I had a taste of what we could be. Now… now I never want to let that go. Never want to let you go.”
“They wouldn't be wrong.” He tilted his head slightly, narrowing his eyes at her.
The silence fills the car as he pulls out of his parking space. Finally they are getting closer to finding his brother and with Cas by his side, failure isn't an option.
Cas didn't have a chance to respond before Dean was jumping out of the car, slamming the door shut. Cas sighed as he watched Dean move across to the motel door and disappeared inside. He glanced at Sam in the back seat. He wouldn't wake up for a while. The need to go to Dean became overwhelming. He needed answers. He needed to know where he stood. Where they stood.
Things go back to normal after their moment in the Impala. Dean understood that Cas had a responsibility to find Kelly. Strangely, he was okay with that. He missed him, of course. All he could think about was the way Cas had surrounded him, how he had felt against him, inside him. But they both had obligations that sent them in different directions, he understood even if he didn't like it.
Castiel didn't turn around, instead he just gazed at the fading blue wallpaper of the motel room. “No, I don't. But we don't have any other options at the moment.”
As it sniffs in the oxygen, it can feel itself start to choke. It won't last long here. A slow idea forms in its mind and it slowly smiles. It knows it doesn't look like a smile, but it knows that's what it is. It  continues through the streets, searching for the perfect vessel. Too young. Too old. Too ill. Too everything. The vessel needs to be strong. The vessel needs to be willing. The vessel needs to be perfect. If it has any chance at completing the mission, it needs to be just right.
Dean sighed, all the fight leaving him. “I said, I am hurting.”
He managed to force his eyes back up to Cas's eyes and what he saw there took his breath away, literally. His palms grew sweaty and he watched the heat rise within Cas. Only this time, he didn't try to hide it and Dean wasn't sure if he was relieved or freaked out by this.
Dean swiped at his tears, trying to form his thoughts into words. He hated anything remotely to do with expressing his emotions. He needed to do this for Cas, Cas needed this from him. “I can't feel this way any more.” He stood and slowly moved across the room, afraid that Cas would disappear on him again. He once again wrapped his arms around the angel, pressing his chest against his back and leant his forehead into his shoulder blades. He felt Cas stiffen with tension but he didn't move away. Small mercies. “I've missed you, so damn much,” he whispered.
Looking back at the demon bitch, hoping to have it out with her, he was surprised to find that she wasn't looking at him, but over him, behind him, the smile now turning smug. Dean glanced over his shoulder as he felt the wet floor soak his elbows from where he was leaning on them. The rain was freezing and he felt a shiver run through him. It wasn't because of the cold, though. His heart stopped at the sight of two demons holding Cas, each gripping an arm, each holding an angel blade to his throat. Cas looked defeated and frightened and furious all at once. He knew Cas could handle himself, knew he could probably break free if he tried.
A voice yelling behind him. He knew that voice. But he couldn't think. Couldn't register it. All he could think about was the dying man before him. He couldn't lose him. Not like this. Not after everything they'd been through.
Castiel looked into Dean's concerned green eyes. His hand was on his shoulder and it burned. It burned so badly. Castiel shrugged it off and walked past him, wiping the hot tears from his flushed cheeks.
He heard Sam sigh and the sound of the laptop clicking shut. “Wanna talk about it?”
“No. You didn't do anything wrong. The look in your eyes, it was pure love and...” Dean shifted uncomfortably. “And I don't deserve it. I panicked because… I realised that if we were to do that, it needed to be… I don't know. I just know that this-” He gestured between them. “Is the most real thing I have ever felt and I really don't want to fuck it up. I want it to be right. I want… I want it be as real as your love for me. I don't want it to be out of need or hunger or desperation. I want it to be about love and only love. But the thing is, Cas… I don't think I'm worthy of the love your offering.”
Cas had finally found Kelly and Dean felt a kind of relief at the news. He knew how Cas had felt guilt over letting her slip away, knew that he was trying to make it all okay by going to such lengths to protect her. Dean wanted to reassure him, tell him it wasn't necessary, they had all made misjudgements and that there was no shame in that. There was no point in saying any of that though, Cas wouldn't believe him anyway.
Sam was asking if he was okay and he really didn't know how to answer that. He glanced at him, shook his head once and then latched his eyes back on to the angel.
Dean's eyes narrowed at the question. “What way?”
The smile dropped and there was a slight hesitation which set Castiel's nerves on fire. Eventually, though, he said, “Yes, I promise.”
Again, Castiel nodded, darting his eyes away fro a second. He took a deep breath and told Sam about his feelings for his brother. Told him that Dean probably feels the same way, but won't allow himself to feel it. Told him the reasons why. Told him that he, himself, has come to accept this and has decided on space for a little while. Told him how he accepted it so easily because he too feels like he doesn't deserve Dean. When he finally finished he had felt like a weight had finally been lifted from his shoulders. Sam's eyes were wide with shock.
He followed Dean to the bed and they both led on top of the covers. Dean wrapped both arms around Cas's waist and brought him closer. Cas in turn gripped onto him, just to reassure him that they were still really together. He buried his face into Dean's chest and let out a content sigh.
Sam stood. “Dean-”
Castiel could only nod his agreement as his mouth dried up. Instinctively, his tongue ran along his bottom lip to wet it as Dean gently pulled him into the bedroom. Castiel quietly closed the door, listening for the soft click. When his eyes met Dean's again, they were still full of hope. He
A groan from the bed.
“Calm down. He's going to be fine.”
“Fuck, Cas...” Cas smiled, his other hand reaching to his Dean's cock, pumping it in time with his fingers. “Cas, shit. That's so good.” His skin tingled, his heart hammered, his mouth dry, his breaths coming in short bursts. This felt so amazing, better than anything he'd ever felt before. Why had he been so apprehensive about this? It didn't seem to make sense any more.
“I'm scared because I failed yet again. I'm scared because I've never ever felt this level of emotions for anything in my entire existence and what I feel for you… I'm scared because I don't want to lose you, I can't lose. But no matter what decision I make, no matter what, I will lose you.”
“You want me,” Cas said, his voice full of his angelic power, dangerously so. “I'm here. You want to kill me, then let Dean Winchester go and you can have me.”
Cas's eyes brightened with pure happiness as he digested what Dean was saying. Then he closed the gap, placing his wet lips on his. It was soft, gentle and hesitant. It wasn't enough. Dean pushed forward, putting on the pressure and Cas finally responded by opening his mouth. He darted his tongue inside, tasting Cas's luscious mouth. It made his head dizzy with arousal, made his cock leak with pre-come, made it beg to be free.
Dean glanced back at him over his shoulder and Castiel watched the internal struggle going on. “Not this time.”
He rounded the corner of the building, glancing over his shoulder to ensure nobody could see. He took in a steadying breath and prayed like he had never prayed before. He begged, pleaded with Chuck to just this once give him this one wish. He'd done everything for this world, sacrificed everything and never once had he asked for anything in return. But now he was asking, begging him to just have this one good thing back.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Cas turned to leave. “Goodbye, Dean.”
He just needed to last till they got here. That's all. He just needed to get through whatever torture Naomi had planned. It would all be worth it in the end. He was sure of that, especially if it meant Dean would be safe. That's all that mattered to Castiel now. Dean had to be safe.
Immediately Dean pulled free, his cock slipping wetly from his hole, his grip from his hips gone. Castiel allowed himself a moment to think. Dean would be confused, he had agreed after all, he needed to think of what to say. But nothing came. All he could think about was this empty, numbing feeling in the depths of his chest. He was so deeply in love with him, and Dean didn't feel the same. The reality came crashing down around him. This was just another conquest to Dean. Just another willing body for him to pound till he lost all control. That was it. Nothing more. Castiel tried to stop the tears from flowing, but they wouldn't. They wouldn't go away. It was as if they were compensating for the emptiness he was feeling. He couldn't face Dean like this. But time had worn on for too long, and Castiel had no choice to face it, to face him.
Everyone was shocked when Jack took off, misunderstanding that he needed to keep them all safe. Cas felt lost, felt useless, felt sorrow and guilt for him. He wanted to run after him, follow him. But reason leaked through and he knew he would never find him, never. If Jack wanted to disappear then he would and there was nothing any of them could do about it.
“Dean, we need to talk.” His voice was low and cautious and Dean swallowed down the lump that was slowly forming in his throat. He tried to ignore the loud thudding of his heart and his nerves were automatically set on fire. Dean had been right. Whatever Cas wanted to say wasn't good.
“Never mind what Dean doesn't approve of. He needs someone to talk to.”
Cas eyed Sam with deep depression and sighed. “I know.”
He climbed out of the car, slamming the door shut and moved around to the trunk. He pulled out the various weapons they would need and slammed the trunk down. He chucked some weapons towards Sam, who caught them, then started to move towards where the warehouse was situated.
But Dean stopped. He didn't want Cas to come like that. He didn't want it to end there. Cas looked at him with confusion, the panic came to his eyes again and Dean gulped past the lump in his throat. Had he really done him that much damage? It was going to take a long time for Cas to stop thinking he was going to run every time he pulled away.
He waited for the inevitable, waited for him to turn to leave, but he didn't. He was stood frozen, eyes wide. Dean felt frustration growing within him. If he was going to leave, he needed to do it now or he would end up begging again. He wasn't going to do that. He had no right to keep him here. He had no right to ask him not to go.
Sam was standing in the door way, his hair a mess from where he'd been asleep, his eyes were tired and his mouth set in a grim line. His dark green t-shirt hung loosely, as did his navy blue jogging bottoms. “Morning, Cas,” he grumbled sleepily. He moved out of the way to let Castiel enter the room.
“As long as Sam is okay with that.”
To say he was nervous was an understatement. He'd been inside Cas, knew what he felt like, but that wasn't what he wanted, not really. The only reason he'd done that was because he needed control over the situation. This time will be different. He will show Cas just how much he wanted him. This wasn't going to be a quick fuck, this was going to be so much more.
So I wasn't going to dive right into the whole Kelly thing, but when I started writing this I thought, “WOW! This is actually good.” I also figured that Cas would go off and do his 'duty', and Dean would be so okay with that because that's their life, right?
Dean found himself getting lost into those perfect eyes, feeling just how much he really was loved. The feeling started to become overwhelming and the sudden urge to run from it pushed forward. It didn't feel wrong, the way Cas was looking at him was so right, as though this was where he was suppose to be all along.
“Castiel, angel of the Lord. I have been waiting for this moment.” The Shadow's voice sounded like a snake, raspy and sly, a hiss almost, sending another shiver through Dean. Its lips were still connected to his skin and he wanted nothing more than to pull away from it. He held himself still, somehow, breathing heavily, waiting.
He walked away without another look in Cas's direction. This was not good. He couldn't go on a hunt with him. These feelings only stirred when he was around him and now he was going to be staying in a fucking motel room with the guy. Just perfect. But if he refused his assistance then both Cas and his brother would know something was up and that was just too risky. Nobody could know about his perverted thoughts.
This is what she calls art, beautiful art, they made together. Sam stays silent, no idea what he's suppose to say to it. She whispers in his ear, promising that this is just the beginning. Once word breaks out that she has a Winchester right where he should be, causing all of this, she will be reward in ways no one can imagine, she will be deemed a hero. He doesn't agree with her. He doesn't know what he's suppose to do with that information.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean flinched. “Gone,” was all he managed.
He waited, just in case Cas returned. His eyes now darted around, his ears listening intently to the sounds around him, hoping to hear the tell-tale signs of flapping wings. But nothing came. Realisation hit then, sending him stumbling backwards, making him land on his ass. He'd hurt Cas too many times. Cas has had enough. But who could blame him, really?
He opened his mouth, to do just that, but just as he did, Cas disappeared, leaving through the open door. The panic hit him hard and fast. He was about to lose him again. No, he can't, not again. He can't keep playing this broken, useless man. He just can't. Finally, his limbs started to work properly, his brain kicked back into gear and he jumped from his bed, throwing the covers back violently. He raced out of his room, his feet slapped against the floor, his arms pushed against the cold air, urging him to go faster around the bends of the corridor.
For two days, while Sam nursed Dean back to health, he waited patiently in the library. There was nothing much for him to do but think, think about every conversation, every touch that had passed between him and Dean, questioning what would have happened if he'd done something different. If he was being totally honest with himself, none of this would have happened if he hadn't let slip that he was in fact in love with him in the first place. But after that… after that, there was so many things he could have done differently, said differently. He'd asked too much of him, that much was obvious. Again, he should be honest with himself again. What if Dean wasn't the only one running? What if Cas was pushing him away? Castiel wasn't the type to do that, but he'd been hurt so many times, he was terrified of it happening again. It's not a feeling he wants to grow accustomed to. Love… Yeah, he'd feel that over and over again. But pain, heartache? No, he could do without that. What if he's the one causing the heartache now? What if this is all his doing?
Dean allowed his eyes to drift to Naomi. She was stood shocked to the spot, her eyes wide and mouth open. Another surge of bright light, from the other side of the room this time. Sam had arrived.
It had been Sam's idea to take Jack home, to drop the case, get someone else to do it. And Cas thought that was a good idea because as he looked upon Jack, he saw how miserable he was, how guilt-ridden he was. They needed to get him away from this town, away from this situation. But Dean had never liked leaving a case. Of course he understood getting Jack back to the bunker. He understood the need for them to leave.
A small determination pushed its way through and his eyes hardened. He moved to the bathroom door, unlocking it. His brother looked up at him, his brow furrowed in concern. Dean ignored him, the determination still twisting in his gut. He grabbed his jacket of the back of the vacant motel chair and pulled it on. He grabbed his keys. Without looking at his brother, he mumbled a 'I'm going out' and left.
Cas hummed, closing his eyes in pleasure. He knew he should close his own eyes, knew he should revel in his own pleasure at the contact, but he couldn't, he was too mesmerised by Cas's reaction. Cas was the one to break away first, a small, shy smile playing at his lips. Slowly, cautiously, he bent his head, placing his mouth into the crook of Dean's neck, sucking gently while he ran his fingers through Dean's hair. Dean threw his head back, allowing him to gain better access as goosebumps travelled at an alarming rate across his heated skin. A shiver tore through him and he moaned with the pleasure of it. He'd never once been on the receiving end like this, never once had he ever felt this way during a sexual moment. This feeling was just so…. Euphoric.
Shock coursed through his veins and his mouth fell open as the words swirled through his mind. Was he serious? Of course he was. Cas wouldn't joke about something like this, Dean didn't even think he could joke about anything like this.
The music is turned down, the smile on his face doesn't drop though. “Why you grinning like an idiot?” his brother asks. When he glances across at him, he notices the fake concern for him.
Dean opened his eyes and they grew round at the sight of him stood there. Slowly, he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, his eyes never leaving his, but he didn't come closer, wisely keeping his distance. “You're leaving already?” Castiel sensed the strength that it took to say those words and he had to suck in a sharp breath, trying to calm his beating heart.
Cas slowly turned to face him. His eyes were soft but wary and Dean wanted nothing more than to bundle him up in his arms and just kiss away all their pain, all his pain. Of course, he couldn't do that, he would only be rejected. He fisted his hands at his sides, forcing himself not reach out to him. Cas needed space and that's what he was going to give him. Nothing good could come out of unwanted comfort.
Castiel had expected relief or happiness at his words, but what he saw instead was pure, unwavering fear. He took a step back in shock, his eyes growing wide and this horrible sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. Did he not want him to stay? That thought cut deep into his chest and he had to fight the urge to rub at his chest to ease it.
They are going to find Sam, even it is the last thing they do.
“I want to,” he said, cautiously. “But-”
Castiel watched as guilt plagued his eyes now. What was he thinking? What was happening to him? “I was angry.”
“I didn't, Cas. I said I can't.”
“I can't. Please. I don't want you to… hate me. Let's forget about it and move on. I apologise for last night. It won't happen again.”
He didn't know how long he sat there on the cold floor, sobbing his eyes out, willing the pain to just go, to just leave. He'd thought about getting up, washing his face before facing the music and just getting out there as though everything was normal, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.
-Supernatural -
But these demons were smart. Cas wouldn't try anything, not as long as he was in danger. He glanced back at the demon hovering over him. She was crouched next to him now, her own knife point touching his throat. It was warm compared to his skin, but it sent another shiver down his throat. She was still looking at where Cas was and still with that damn smile.
Dean's eyes widened, unsure of what he just heard. “What?”
Castiel cocked his head to the side. “Why? You've made things very clear.”
Sam nodded in understanding and then Cas disappeared, leaving the two Winchesters behind.
“Never do that again, Dean.” Then he's gone.
Slowly, he started to move his hand up and down the shaft, his thumb swiping across the head, feeling the slickness of the pre-cum. Dean thought he would have been horrified by the thought of holding another man's penis, but he wasn't. He was enjoying watching Cas come apart at the seams. He enjoyed watching his head tilt back. He enjoyed watching his eyes roll into the back of his head. He enjoyed hearing those small little moans of pleasure. And it was all because of Dean.
Thank you to everyone who has supported this story so far. Your opinions and your advice is amazing and I can't seem to express how much it all means to me. Okay, so I am not going to ramble on and on about it.
Tears rolled down his cheeks, silently and hotly as he felt the pain of this loss. This wasn't like losing his brother or his father or Bobby or any of their other friends that had died for the Winchesters. This was nothing like that. This was the type of loss that made Dean want to die too. But he couldn't. He still had his brother. Sam needed him. He couldn't leave Sam alone to deal with Lucifer's son. Even if they didn't have that to deal with, he couldn't leave him alone.
-SUPERNATURAL -
Dean felt his heart explode with joy. He wasn't going to leave, he was still willing to work things out. “I promise.” He would keep it as well. Cas was right, he needed to move past this fear.
Cas's eyes softened at his words. “Dean-”
Dean didn't respond, didn't know if he could. How long had it been since he last said anything? He knew the last words he'd spoken was to Cas, knew exactly what those words were. But how long ago was that?
It was time he took charge. He pulled Sam with him as he made his way towards the door, both of them stumbling as though drunk. When they reached the corridor, they heard popping sounds as every light went out. This lasted only seconds and the bunker was shrouded in darkness. The only thing Dean was aware of was his brothers arm in his grasp. Only seconds later, the generator picked up and a dim light showed the empty corridor. Dean looked at his brother and shrugged. The bunker finally stopped shaking, the silence grew as things stopped falling.
The sound of the door closing signalled Dean's departure. That was when he turned to face Sam. Sam was eyeing him suspiciously but didn't say anything. Castiel was grateful. He didn't want to come up with any excuses for his detached behaviour.
Never mind. It will have to make do. No matter what, it will make it through in one piece and tear that angel apart, and his friends, too, if they cause it any problems. -
Dean was grateful that Cas had gotten the hint. He needed his space. Needed time to gather his thoughts. He couldn't do that with Cas in such close proximity. He glanced at his brother. Sam was sat the motel table, laptop open and his concentration face on, the thing at the morgue didn't tell them anything different about the case. It was an angel that much they knew. Sam stopped typing and now his eyes darted back and forth, reading. Sam had definitely not noticed anything different between him and Cas, not since the big reveal anyway, another thing he was grateful for.  He remembered the way Cas had looked at him in that diner, and heat spread through him at the intense look in Cas's eyes. His mind had stuttered to a close and he couldn't think clearly.
Cas felt anger push towards the surface. Was he really go to make this difficult? Cas took a step forwards. “How long have you had feelings for me?”
It sensed something. It sensed something huge as it made its way up a winding road. He cocked its vessel's head to the side, coming to a stop, and squinting through the brightness of the day. Before it was a huge metal door, leading inside a hill. A surge of energy was coming from it and it knew, it knew that Castiel was here.
“Sorry for what?” he whispered it, partly so Sam wouldn't hear them talking but also to keep the mood of the moment going.
He didn't have time to analyse his feelings at that moment. They were against the clock in the worst possible way. He explained everything. About how Lucifer was on his way and they had to get Kelly out of there. Just as Cas was trying to explain that it was too late to move her, just as the realisation of what that meant made his eyes go round and his mouth slack, a scream pierced through the house. It was a blood curdling scream and if Dean didn't know what was happening he would have assumed someone was being tortured.
“I have nothing to discuss with you.” He turned his back to her, hoping she would get the hint. He knew her though, and she would not be able to resist saying what she came to say.
It was relief.
Cas pushed the tip of his cock past the muscles and Dean instantly felt that burn. It made him want to retreat, to push away. This was way worse than Cas's fingers. He closed his eyes, trying hard to concentrate on relaxing his muscles, trying hard to stay still. He gripped the angels shoulders, digging his nails into his smooth skin, trying to ground himself. Cas held still, waiting patiently, waiting for Dean to give his approval of more. Suddenly he didn't know if he could do this. He opened his eyes, needing to tell Cas that, but when he caught Cas's gaze, he knew he couldn't back out now. Cas was looking as though it took everything in him to hold still, to wait. If Cas could hold back like that, then he could do this.
- SUPERNATURAL -
His chest heaved up and down as he fell silent. The anger started to leave him and regret started to fill him. He shouldn't have said any of that. He rubbed a hand down his face and pulled it away quickly. It was wet with tears, tears he hadn't even realised had rolled down his face. He dropped the washing in his arm and started to walk backwards. His brain had gone into shock, he knew that as he stared down at his shaking hands. It had finally become too much for him. All these emotions, emotions that angels shouldn't even be feeling. This should have happened long before now. Perhaps he should feel grateful he's lasted this long.
Castiel landed in the motel room silently. He glanced around with urgent, worried eyes. He could feel the pressure of his heart beating fast and hard. His eyes caught sight of Sam sat at the motel table, laptop open, eyes darting from side to side as he read, his brows furrowed. Castiel glanced around the rest of the room. No Dean. Not good. Sam hadn't noticed his presence so he said his name urgently. Sam's eyes darted up, surprise on his face.
“Dean.” He didn't know what he was going to say, he didn't know how he wanted that one word word to sound. But it sounded like a warning, like he didn't want Dean to go there. Of course he didn't want that. He wanted to just lie there, enjoying these precious moments he got to spend with the only person he ever loved. He didn't know how long it would be till he would be forced to leave again, and he just wanted to savour every moment, every look, every touch.
Dean looked upon him cautiously and Castiel felt relief wash over him. He wasn't too far gone that he couldn't be reasoned with. “Understand what?” His voice was still venomous.
Dean glanced at his brother. “What do you think we should do?”
“Its a risk I can't take.” Cas's voice was pleading with him, begging him to understand and accept this decision. But he couldn't. He wasn't going to.
“Come with us?” He didn't know what made him ask that, didn't know what possessed him. But as soon as the words had mixed with the air, he knew he didn't want it any other way.
Carefully, gently, he raised Dean off his cock and he felt it slip wetly from the heat, could feel his own release seep out, dripping onto him, but he paid it no mind. Dean moved willingly, landing with a soft thump onto the mattress, pulling Castiel with him. Both of them led on their sides, facing each other, breathing heavy, legs intertwined, hands linked between their sweaty bodies. Dean reached up with his free hand and brushed away Cas's sweaty hair from his forehead. He watched with fascination as Dean looked upon him with so much adoration it took his breath away. He had never seen such a look upon his face before and it both frightened him and made him happy.
Panic and terror flooded Dean's senses and he reached out and gripped his arm. Cas looked down at where they were joined, his brow creasing. He was confused. Dean thought hard as he frowned at the terror that had spiked. Cas leaving willingly, Cas was leaving because Dean couldn't say what needed to be said, that was worse than all the other terrifying things he'd thought of. Worse than if Cas had died, because that wouldn't have been willingly.
Dean stated to move his hand a little faster and Cas snapped his head back up, the hunger radiated off of him now and Dean gulped. “Dean, that feels so good.” His voice was thick with arousal.
“I can't do this, Cas.” His voice was scratchy and weak, his throat raw from all those tears and sobs. He watched for a reaction, hoping to see pain and guilt but all he saw was confusion. He took in a shaky breath trying to will away the nausea that had found a home in the pit of his stomach. “You don't want me and I don't know why and I have no choice but to accept it, no matter how much it fucking hurts, but… you can't be here, Cas, not any more. I can't be around you, not at the moment.” His words pierced through his heart, scarring it, but he knew this was the right thing to do. “It hurts too much.”
Dean pulled back just enough to catch his eyes and Cas could feel his heart pick up speed, could feel the nervousness seep into his veins, making him shake slightly. “I love you, you know that, right?”
As he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, he felt like he was suffocating, felt like his whole body was ready to collapse into itself. He desperately clutched at his chest, gripping with everything he had, his knuckles turning white. He needed this searing pain, this grief, to go. He couldn't cope with the possibility that Cas wasn't coming back. Perhaps if he knew what had happened he could figure out a way to get him back, make a deal or something, but he didn't know.
Thoughts of their kisses floated through his mind. He didn't want to ever let that feeling go, didn't want to walk away from him, didn't want this to end. “Okay.”
Cas brushed the back of his hand down his cheek, the gentle touch, soothing and caring, making his breath hitch. With a feather light touch, Cas pushed his t-shirt up and over his head, discarding it behind him somewhere. Dean didn't care, all that mattered was how this angel was looking at him, how he was making him feel. A warm feeling exploded in his chest and he found himself leaning forwards, catching Cas's soft, pink lips with his own.
He watched as Cas narrowed his eyes in thought and Dean hated how he was begging for him to just give this ago, to give them ago. Then he shook his head. The pain surged to the surface once more and he swallowed thickly. “I can't,” Cas whispered.
It glances around, seeing humans, seeing everything so much more clearly through these human eyes. There is other human eyes, staring at him, open mouthed. It stands and glares at them all, these insignificant creatures, and pushes past them, resisting the urge to kill them all. Now is not the time for that kind of behaviour. It can't draw notice to itself. Not yet.
Now, as he stood in their motel room, he felt torn because Jack needed to go home, but Dean wanted to stay and finish the case. Cas knew why Dean wanted to stay and he was good at supporting that decision. But what was he suppose to do? A huge part of him wanted to stay with Dean, didn't want to leave him just yet. He wasn't ready to ignore that usual pull towards him. On the other hand, he knew Jack needed him. If anyone understood losing control, it was him… and Sam. So what was he suppose to do?
Eventually, the symbol lets of a blast so strong that it sends its vessel flying through the air, tumbling head over heels as the wind pushes past. It lands hard onto the concrete floor. If it had been human, it would have hurt all over, or perhaps broken a couple of bones, but it wasn't human and a fall like that didn't do much damage.
It is nice here. So much different to the normal darkness it is so use to.
“We have a problem.” Castiel walked over to Sam in two long strides and stopped just short of him. Sam's eyes never left his, concern now taking over the surprise. Before Sam could say anything, Castiel explained his meeting with Naomi. Sam's eyes grew wider and wider with each word, his eyebrows raising high up into his hair line. When Castiel had finished, he glanced around the room again. “Where's Dean?”
(See the end of the chapter for
And Dean did. He felt his muscles relax. Fuck, he had a finger up his ass. He couldn't wrap his head around it. Then Cas pulled it almost all the way out and the pressure was gone for a moment, but not for long as Cas pushed it back in. Dean gasped at the sensation. His cock twitched.
Without any real thought, Dean snapped his head around to stare at his brother, his eyes grew round and his mouth hung open in shock. Two weeks? Was that all? It had felt so much longer. His brother's eyes were watery and emotional. Damn! He should not have looked at him. He was starting to feel a stir in his chest, an urge to make his brother feel okay again, to make him stop worrying. Urgently, he turned his head back around, his eyes latching back onto the ceiling. He's not allowed to feel anything else, nothing else. That's how it needed to be, for now, anyway.
Cas finally moves from the wall and for a moment Dean thought he would come over there and start beating the shit into him. He cowers back slightly, afraid of what Cas would d.
Castiel waited patiently for the brothers to return. His eyes scanned the laptop that Sam had been researching with, his mind not really taking in any of the information. He couldn't help the worry from springing up, couldn't help his thoughts from wondering to Dean. He hoped he was okay, hoped he wasn't freaking out. Sam had gone to find him. Dean had been in the shower for forty-five minutes and Sam was starting to worry.
Christie comes forward and sits on his lap, wrapping her arms round his neck. He feels repulsed as he inhales her perfume and she inches her face forward, that damn smile is still there. “Oh but we are, Sammy. You and me are going to become really close.”
Dean is sure there is more to that, but lets it go. He's troubled enough without having to add extra to the list, so he pretends he doesn't see anything out of the ordinary and looks at the computer again.
Cas got angry, and he got angry quickly. Dean flinched at the sudden change. “I'll tell you why, Dean. You can't do this because you don't believe you deserve this. You believe that everyone who has ever been hurt, or died, is entirely your fault. Well, guess what? It's not. None of it is your fault. You have sacrificed so much for the greater good. You deserve to be happy.”
“Tough.” With that, Cas released his wrist and was gone from the room. Dean felt the emptiness once again and tried not to think about how Cas was probably just trying to find a reason to leave without him clinging to him.
Cas cringed and ignored him, his mind drifting back to Dean and prayed to his absent father to keep him safe. That's all he needed, Dean back in one piece.
“You two are just too cute.”
Dean sighed too loudly and rolled his eyes. “How could you have missed me when you were dead?”
“Stop the car, Dean.” His voice was barely audible over the engine. Dean knitted his brows together  but complied. Just before the car had come to a stop at the side of the road, Cas was jumping out of the backseat.
Cas turned to face him. His eyes were cold and dark and his features showed no signs of what he was thinking. It made Dean swallow hard at the sight. Something had changed in Cas and he didn't think it was anything good. “I always worry.” That one simple sentence held so much meaning. It unnerved Dean. While the words were meant to be heavy, his face didn't soften, his eyes stayed hard and detached.
“Yes. And you're going to trust I won't run again?”
“I… I'm… I'm sorry.”
He can't see. Darkness all around him. He looks left and then right, but nothing. He's bound to a chair, he thinks, and he struggles against the rope, trying to free himself. But there's no movement and he finally gives up.
“Don't you dare leave me, Cas. Not like this, please. Please, wake up.”
“Come out and we'll discuss it with you.” The sound of footsteps fading away.
He shook his head, closing his eyes against the nausea that was slowly rising from the pit of his stomach. “It's fine. I understand.” He didn't, far from it. He just needed to stop this conversation, to move on. It was over. He'd guessed that anyway, from the betrayal and all, but now it was voiced. How could he have been so stupid? He knew, of course. He had been blinded by his relief at seeing Cas, that's how.
“Yes. I promise. I promise I will never leave you like this again. Never.”
Jack. It was such a normal name, a simple name for such a powerful being. It didn't feel right. Didn't sound right. Didn't roll of the tongue right. Nothing about him was right.
Never do that again, Dean.
“What?” His voice croaked with the tears that were building up.
Sam shook his head. “Dean is afraid things will be different when you return. He's afraid that he will have lost you.” Sam knitted his brows together in concentration. “I think… I think he's afraid you will stop loving him.”
Without another forethought, he gripped his gun tightly in his fist, pulling it free from the back of his pants. He shoved past his brother, who on his part, hadn't even realised Dean had joined them. Quickly, he raised the gun, pointing it straight at the creature before them. He knew this action was pointless. A simple bullet wasn't going to stop a being this powerful. But it was the only weapon to hand, and he had to do something, anything to get Cas the justice he deserved.
So it moves on, down the alley and down the street, taking in everything around it. Taking in all these enormous buildings and theses strange people.
Dean waited for the answer. In his mind he could see Cas frowning, contemplating the question. “He… he promised he wouldn't run. So… it...”
The bathroom door sounded and as quick as he could he wiped the tears away with his hand. Sam stopped dead in his tracks as he caught the sight of his brother, worry and confusion on his face.
A warmth spread through his chest, making his head swim with all kinds of emotions. Dean had been thinking about him. He smiled, a teeth showing smile. “Of course. You meant it? No more running?” Dean frowned which made Castiel's smile drop right to his stomach. Had he changed his mind? He started to move backward. The pain shooting through his chest. He couldn't let Dean see this was getting to him, that this was hurting him. “Never mind. Forg-”
The food was delicious. Dean hummed around the first bite into his burger. Then he hummed again as he chewed the mouthful, his eyes widening appreciatively. He savoured the taste of the beef, the cheese, the bacon and the sauce. When he finally swallowed, he darted his tongue out and licked his  lower lip. His eyes darted to his brother. His brother was watching him with such disgust that it made Dean chuckle. He took another bite of his burger, hummed again, savoured the taste again and swallowed again, his eyes not leaving his brothers. Sam rolled his eyes and continued to eat his salad. Dean darted his eyes to Cas as his tongue licked his lip again.
Of course his searches come up empty, just like they did for his brother. There's no signs as to where they could be, nothing, and he wants to throw the damn computer through the window. He refrains though, knowing that when – not if – he gets Sammy back he wouldn't be too pleased at coming home to a broken laptop.
He turned to his brother, about to suggest they find a bar close by before heading back. His brother was squinting out of his side of the wind shield. Dean knew what that look meant. Sam had something on his mind, something that he wanted to discuss and he knew that Dean wasn't going to like it.
“Of course you can come, Cas.”
The dull ache in his chest punched painfully through his heart. He wanted to cry, he wanted to scream, he wanted to tear his way out of the room and drink himself into oblivion. How he managed to refrain himself, he would never know. His vision started to blur with tears and he knew what he needed to say. He dropped his eyes to the bed, trying to figure out how he was going to phrase it, but there was no easy way to say it, so he'd just have to grab the bull by the horns and plough forward. He caught Cas's eyes again, they were concerned and unsure of where Dean was going with this.
“I needed to see...” His voice was barely a whisper, and Castiel needed to strain to hear it.
Dean looked back at Cas, opening his mouth, unclear as to what he was expected to say. Before he had a chance to form any sort of reply in his mind, Cas was answering. “No, Sam. It's not important.”
Another eye roll from his brother, another sip of his coffee. “Dean, we're not entirely sure you're completely healed. Just because the doctor says so doesn't mean anything. Especially not in our lives.”
Cas looked over his shoulder at Dean, their eyes locked. And Dean knew. He knew that whatever Cas was planning meant he was going to lose him for good, he could see the 'goodbye' and the 'I love you' written across his face. Dean wanted to scream at him, beg him not to do anything stupid, but just as he opened his mouth, a whistle rang through the bunker, loud and high-pitched, singing a tune that he didn't recognise.
- SUPERNATURAL -
Every time he looked at the angel, every time his eyes caught those blue ones, he wanted nothing more than to wrap him up in his arms and kiss him, show him just how much he loved him. But what if it was the wrong move? What if that wasn't what Cas wanted?
He glanced at the younger Winchester, who's eyes were darting from one man to the next, confusion in his own eyes. Castiel looked back at Dean. His heart hurt for him, hurt for what they had become.  He rubbed absent-mindlessly at his chest, trying to ease the pain that had accumulated there.
Its too bright here. Too noisy. Too much. Everything is too much.
Cas sucked in a deep breath. Dean waited patiently. It was all on Cas now. Could he accept this? Could he do this? Dean hoped he could. Cas's eyes didn't give anything away and with every second that ticked by Dean felt his heart stutter and droop in his chest. Of course Cas couldn't do this. Dean was asking too much of him again. He was about to open his mouth to say that it didn't matter, that Cas could walk if he needed to. But before a single word escaped, Cas had sealed his lips over Dean's. Dean couldn't move, he couldn't register what was happening. Cas stuck his tongue between Dean's parted lips and that's when he melted into it. He moved his mouth gently in time with Cas's. Dean had no idea how long he'd craved this. How much he wanted it but the relief shone through him at finally having that contact. The taste was amazing, the feeling intoxicating. But all too soon it came to an end. Cas pressed his forehead to Dean's.
Catching him off guard, he felt Dean's hand grabbing his and then he was being pulled through the bunker. Cas could hear Sam's protests, but they both ignored him as they fled from the room. All too soon he was being pushed inside Dean's room. He spun and watched Dean with wide eyes. It was the first time he had actually laid eyes on his since Jack's departure. He just couldn't handle it if Dean blamed him, if Dean felt it was all his fault for losing him like that. So he was careful not to look at him. But now he could see that Dean was tense and also avoiding his eyes as he moved around his room. Cas watched with confusion as he grabbed a duffel bag and started stashing Cas's clothes into it, a bit too violently for his liking.
It didn't take him long to locate him. He was standing frozen to the spot in front of him and Dean could tell instantly that he was in a state of pure shock. When Dean finally looked over his brother's shoulder, he understood why.
“Yeah. Tomorrow, though. I just need to hold you.” He pushed Cas off and they both stood. He knew he should have argued against this, but he needed to be held, and in turn needed to hold Dean. Exhaustion was creeping in, which was strange because he was an angel, but maybe it was because of all these emotions. He had heard the phrase before – emotionally tired. Was that what was happening to him now?
He slams the lid shut and rubs at his tired eyes, feeling the strain weigh him down. He's sick of this continuous cycle that they so often find themselves in. Its always the same, one of them goes missing while the other moves heaven and earth to find them, a life and death situation and then everything is okay again. Not always, though. Sometimes they die, sometimes some really bad decisions are made, but they always come back on top. He's sick of it all. Is it so hard to just give them one fucking break every now and then? The worry claws its way to the forefront of his mind once more. What if this time is different? What if his brother dies and it actually sticks?
All eyes trained on the man in the bed.
“Want it? No! Of course I don't. But you're going to anyway. Because you need to and I fucking get it, I really do.”
Now, all he could think about was the reason. Slowly, he continued walking, his eyes darting from side to side, the tears drying on his face as he thought about what his next move should be. What had he thought the reason was? His first initial thought had been Cas had come to the conclusion Dean wasn't what he wanted, not really and he was just trying to let him down gently. Now, though, that look was haunting him.
“You will, though, Cas. That's just who you are. You're going to go after him because you blame yourself and you will see it as your responsibility to bring him back. That's just who you are. I can see it, your desperate to go after him. So… I'm skipping to the end. No point in you torturing yourself any more. I'm making the decision for you. Go.”
So many questions swirled through his mind, threatening to break the moment and bring him back to the reality of the situation. Did Cas miss him as well? He knew that couldn't be a possibility, after all he had been dead. It would still be nice to hear though.
A groan.
It took only five minuets to reach the warehouse and instantly Dean didn't like it. There were no guards outside. Nothing. It was completely silent. He glanced at his brother who was frowning. Something wasn't right. Dean signalled for his brother to circle the building while he goes in the front entrance. Sam nodded in agreement.
“About how you were right.”
Sam looked upon him, concern written across his face, as though he was waiting for Dean to break, to get angry. Dean never did. He went on as normal. Hunting things, killing things. They had even started to help Cas find Kelly. It was Sam's idea. His reasoning was the sooner they found Kelly, the quicker Cas could return to Dean.
“Yeah, be out in a minute.” His voice sounded shaky and he cursed himself for the billionth time that day.
Cas slowly stood and suddenly he couldn't be there with him, he couldn't be be around him knowing   that just a few minuets ago he was fine, he was normal Cas. He wasn't broken like Dean and that's when he a new realisation set in, Cas wasn't in love with him, not like Dean was with him. He shouldn't be surprised really, after all he was an angel and angels feel things differently to humans. But that didn't mean it hurt any less. Cas didn't want to start things up again and Dean knew why, because they felt differently for each other. Cas had tried to be gentle with him, but of course Dean had tried to ignore it all in his usual fashion.
Dean had to agree with him, he really did, but he was willing to have this, it was better than nothing. “So...” He licked his dry lips as terror filled him to the brim. He was terrified of the answer, terrified of his heart breaking all over again, terrified of being that broken shell of a man again. “So, you're leaving?”
“I have no idea on both aspects.”
Its slivering through the streets, searching, always searching.
He hated himself more than ever now, because while he'd been grieving for Cas, he'd forgotten that his mom was gone too. He didn't believe she was alive. Lucifer had probably killed her by now. But he couldn't diminish Sam's hopes of getting her back. He needed this, he needed something to focus on and if this was it then so be it. So Dean had agreed to help Jack, to help get his mother back.
Two strong arms wrapped around his shoulders as he felt the mattress dip beside him. He leant into the embrace, needing the comfort they held. Inhaling, he smelt like soap and a little bit of his natural scent. Dean pulled away but still kept a hold of him. “Look at me.”
Dean's eyes widened fractionally at his statement, curiosity spiked through. He stayed silent. Castiel gave him a few minuets, his eyes never leaving his. But as the minuets drew on, he found his heart start to beat erratically in his chest. He could do this. He could show Dean that they could, they could do this. If only if he let them. Without warning he surged forwards and pressed his lips to Deans. They were soft and welcoming and when Dean parted them, he slipped his tongue inside, tasting the whisky straight away. He heard Dean grow from deep within, the sound rumbling through his mouth, sending a shot of arousal to Castiel's cock.
“Cas, you sure you're ready to go up against another angel so soon?” Dean asked. He made sure to lace his voice with as much concern as he could, hoping the angel picked up on just how much he still cared and this revelation didn't have to change anything.
Cas closed the distance between them and Dean fought against his natural urge to push away, instead keeping his eyes firmly locked onto Cas's. “You're allowed to be happy, Dean.”
Realisation replaced the sadness. “You had thought I'd left.” Dean nodded. “You were pushing me away before I could end it,” Another nod. “Dean, you are so infuriating.”
“No! This has nothing to do with you. So why don't you keep you fucking nose out? You have no idea what I'm thinking or feeling. So quit it. I'm not the bad guy.”
“I'm not ready,” he said in way of an explanation.
Sam feels his smile widen as he claps the demon on the shoulder. “On the contrary, it can be a very good thing.” He takes a step back and addresses the rest of the room, while the demon goes back to formation. “This meat suit I'm wearing, Sam Winchester, knows a lot of things, some very interesting things, things I'm going to use to my advantage. When I'm through, Dean Winchester is going to wish I will just hurry up and kill him. He will be so full of self-hatred. He will never be able to look at his family and his friends in the eye again.”
“I'm not done!” He took another step closer to the angel, closing the gap between them, their clothes brushing together. “I hated you, Cas. I hated you for making me face it all only to fucking leave the next day. I hated you for months. When I saw you at that house, I wanted to punch you, to fucking lay into you so fucking hard, but things got messed up. You… you… died.” The pain of that moment came rushing back and he had to swallow past it, he needed to keep going, more for his sake than Cas's.
Castiel had never hated himself more.
The creatures was here.
His heart completely stopped as the voice came through the speaker, then it picked up speed double time. His foot hit the break peddle, hard. It was an automatic response. The sound of squealing tires sounded through the quiet night as the car came to an abrupt halt. He could feel confused and curious eyes burning a hole through the side of his face, but he paid it no attention, instead focusing on trying to control his breathing. “Cas?” he breathed. Hoping beyond hope that this wasn't some sick and twisted trick.
Dean took a step back, his eyes wide and glistening with the tears that were still falling silently. He broke the eye contest, glancing nervously at his brother. Castiel couldn't waver his gaze, couldn't break that connection, not yet. He needed for Dean to be okay, needed to know that he would be fine. Guilt plagued Castiel. He shouldn't have said anything. He should have just kept going, should have allowed Dean to have him, at least once.
He felt a hand on shoulder and Dean's eyes snapped to his brother's concerned ones. He couldn't deal with that now, he couldn't think past anything other than what could have been. Cas needed to be as far away from him as possible, that's the only way either of them needed to survive. He couldn't be here any more. He needed to leave. Needed to forget.
He pushes all thoughts of Cas and how hopelessly in love he is with the guy to the back of his mind, to focus back on his searches. The hindrance of finding nothing pulses through his veins, wanting to throw the damn laptop through the window. Like his need for Cas, he pushes it down deep. Its his brothers toy and if he broke it… well, when he gets Sam back he wouldn't be happy.
Cas furrowed his brows and looked at the floor. Trying to make a joke out of whatever was bothering him probably wasn't the smartest move, but he just needed to diffuse some of the tension, needed some kind of reassurance. “This isn't working, Dean.”
Cas's pleading eyes turned to pure love and it made Dean's knees weak, made him swallow back a moan of pure panic at the sight. “I can't do this.”
He watched as Dean darted his eyes back to Castiel, offering him a small, reassuring smile. Shock coursed through him at the sight. He was trying to tell him he was going to be okay, but he knew better than that. He could see it in those sad eyes. He was doing this for his benefit and possibly his brothers.
He didn't answer, not knowing what to say. He generally didn't know when the last time he slept was. All he knew was that his body was exhausted, screaming at him to sleep. He had tried, plenty of times, but every time he closed his eyes he would picture the way Cas's body had felt against his as they showed each other just how much they loved one another. He wasn't allowed to think about the good times with him. It was his fault there was going to be no more of them.
“That's not what I want!” Dean yelled, his face turning red from frustration. Castiel's eyes widened in shock. He hadn't expected that to be so easy.
It wasn't too long before his mind wondered to the kiss that he'd experienced only moments before. It had felt amazing to have Dean pressed up against him, feeling his desperation and his hunger. It was just as good as last nights one. He shifted in his seat as the arousal tangled in his gut. The urge to go to Dean was strong, and somehow he held back, knowing that Dean needed space, for the moment at least.
Cas won't look at him as he shuffles from foot to foot, his body tense. “I… I had some thinking to do.”
No matter what, he was not going to have any conversation about what had just happened. This wasn't going to turn into anything.
He can feel her smile and he hates it, hates it so much he wants to claw at his own face. “Let's go and catch us another Winchester, shall we?” His voice says.
They had now moved on from there motel and they were moving on to the next town that had another angel attack. The Impala was quiet, the darkness seeping in through the windows. His brother was asleep in the passenger seat, his head leaning against the glass. Cas was in the back seat, sulking. Cas had wanted to go on and start investigating to get a head start. Dean had completely dismissed the idea, saying they should stay together, so if there was an attack they'd be able to fight it off better with the three of them. They'd argued for all of ten minutes before Sam finally put his opinion across. He'd agreed with Dean. That had finally swayed Cas to oblige, didn't mean he had to like it though.
Looking down at the man he so deeply loved, he softened his eyes, pouring all the sadness and grief he was feeling into them. He heard Cas gasp at the change. The angel stood on shaky legs. Sam reached out and grabbed him, steadying him. A spike of jealousy shot through him. It should be him helping Cas, not his brother. But he tramped it down. He needed to remember, to keep in mind why he was keeping his distance.
Chapter 9
His mind should be solely focused on finding his brother, but its not. Its there at the back of his mind as he numbly goes through his search results, his eyes unseeing as they scan back and forth. At the front, though, is Cas and how Dean could possibly help him. What's been going on? Here he is having a crisis in so many different ways, making it all about finding Sam and keeping his feelings buried deep, that he hadn't even realised that his best friend was having his own crisis. The guilt twists a knot in his gut and he swallows thickly. What a shitty person he is. It has always been the same. It always went in the same direction. Sam and Dean would wallow in their self-pity and their own battles, and Cas would be so concerned about helping them, saving them, that his own problems would go unnoticed.
“I have information concerning that angel problem you and the Winchesters are working on.” That caught his attention and he slowly rounded on her again. Her eyebrows were raised as to say 'I knew that would get you to talk'. He didn't say anything. Instead he waited patiently for her to continue. For a few moments she stayed silent, and he started to wonder if she would elaborate or if this was her trying to manipulate him again.  “They blame you, Castiel. They believe that everything that's happened, it was your fault.”
The room was clean and back to normal. Cas must have used his angel mojo on the place. The thought of Cas sent a small twinge through his chest and he tried to push it away. His eyes caught Sam, who was sat with his laptop open. His brother's worried eyes sprang to his immediately. But Sam didn't say anything, just watched him cautiously. Dean didn't know whether to be relieved and grateful or pissed that Sam wasn't the one broaching the subject this time.
Dean slowly stood on his shaky legs. “It doesn't matter what the reason is. It won't stop it from hurting any less, it won't stop it from being complete torture being around you every day.” He took in a deep breath and dropped his eyes to the grimy floor. “I need to try and get over this and I can't do that with you here.”
Neither of them said anything for the longest of times and Dean wondered how he was suppose to proceed. Should he start with the betrayal? About how much it hurt? Or should he start with something a bit happy, like how relieved he was to have Cas here again?
Blue eyes catch his. Dean fell silent. His mouth clamping shut. Gulping nervously. Cas wasn't going to be on his side either. “Dean, you almost died. It's best if you stay.”
The smell is like nothing new to him, metallic. Its strong as he breathes it in. He can feel it coating his skin, thick and sticky. It makes him want to vomit, can feel the sensation push up from his stomach. The demon doesn't allow that, laughing in his face, pushing the urge back down deep.
Time dragged after that. Dean had paced around the entire map room, library and kitchen. He had poured himself a glass of whisky, leaving it be when he remembered that he was suppose to stay sober for Cas's sake. He picked up about five books, leafed through the pages without actually looking properly. He opened up his own laptop and tried to distract himself with research, but he found he couldn't think of anything to type into the search bar, resorting to just staring at the page. The time continued to scream at him, yelling that it was still no closer to the allotted time. His cell stayed silent.
As he walked back towards the motel that his brother was staying at, his mind went round in circles, picturing every little thing, processing every word. He froze in mid-step as the look in Cas's eyes pushed forward. He'd told Dean he couldn't go there again. But it was that stupid look.
Here's the fourth instalment. I will try and update the next chapter in a couple of days.
“He's willing to eat something?”
WARNING: There is an explicit sex scene in this chapter. Please beware reading it.
Them he turned and fled, his feet pounding on the concrete, his heart breaking in his chest. He could hear Cas calling to him. Dean was grateful that he couldn't go after him, that his wounds slowed him down. He needed out of here. As he pushed his way through the doors and into the night, there was only one thought echoing in his mind.
She let out a laugh. “Well, that wouldn't be a good idea.”
“He'll be fine. Might take him a while to wake, but...”
This had to happen though. For Cas. For himself. For them. He just had to ask himself one question. What was worse? Being that broken man that he'd been for the past two weeks? Or putting himself out there?
“Where?” Cas asked.
- SUPERNATURAL -
Dean gaped at him, but nodded all the same and it made Cas smile. He gripped Dean's hip with his other hand, bringing their groins into contact. He could feel Dean's hardening cock in his jeans and he was sure Dean could feel his as well. He could hear Dean's breathing pick up speed at this sudden close contact.
He couldn't answer him, couldn't bring himself to. He knew that as soon as he spoke, Sam would be able to tell that he'd been crying, tell that something was going on. But if he didn't answer, Sam would grow worried and would probably force his way in. If he answered, Sam would give him space to leave the shower room before harassing him with questions. “Y-yeah. All good, Sammy.”
“Dean, please.” Still Dean didn't say anything, silently praying for his brother to leave in peace. Usually, his brother wouldn't stay for long, couple of minuets at most. Sam would sense it was pointless and just leave, ready to try again soon. This time was different. This time he heard footsteps draw closer to the bed. He forced himself to keep staring at that damn white ceiling. He was not curious about what his brother was doing. He wasn't allowed to feel anything but the pain he felt at losing the best thing that had ever happened to him. Nothing but this bottomless pit of agony.
Cas picked his head up off the door and glared. “Neither am I. I'm no one special either. But when you look at me, sometimes…. Sometimes I can believe that I can be, to you anyway.”
He was now an inch away, feeling the other man's breath on his skin, feeling the warmth of it. He placed a hand on Dean's face, he heard the sharp intake of breath, could see his wide eyes and his parted lips. He wanted to kiss him so bad, but he had something to say first. He searched Dean's face for any sign of resistance and when he found none, he whispered, “Just so we're clear, I will always want you. Nothing, and I mean nothing will ever change that. Do you understand?”
“Fuck, Cas.” Cas started to scissor his fingers and fuck if that didn't feel amazing.
“Hello, Dean.”
“You don't need to worry, me and Sam will be fine.” It was barely a whisper but it made Cas cease his incessant pacing.
“Are you going to leave? Or do you want to stay?” He feels like he's begging. Begging for him not to leave him again. He can't lose him, not now, not ever. He wants to be selfish just this once.
He allowed his eyes to linger for too long, then he realised what he was suppose to be doing. Keeping his feelings hidden, keeping the mask of cool indifference. He averted his eyes to Sam who was now sitting at the small round table, laptop open.
Dean tasted like whisky. He smelled like soap. And Castiel needed more of it, more of him. He pushed closer, could feel Dean's hands grip tightly to his own hips, and he wondered briefly if he needed to ground himself like Castiel needed to. He gently pushed against his head, bringing him closer, if that was even possible.
“Do you really want to forget?” Cas sounded so broken, so hurt by the thought. It tugged painfully at Dean's heart.
Then the words of his brother pierced through the fog. Something about a spell, a sigil. It all came back in a rush. That was how they were going to help Cas, by sending the bastard back where it came from and keeping it there.
Sam's ears pick up at the name of his friend. Cas? Surely Dean wouldn't have called him in, not for a small demon problem like this. At least, they thought it had been small, now Sam can see things in a whole other light.
Dean stood abruptly, almost knocking Castiel back off his feet. He watched as Dean moved away from him, keeping his back to him. Castiel slowly stood, not allowing his gaze to waver, but still allowing Dean his space. Dean had to come back to him on his own terms, that's how this needed to work.
It was settled then. He couldn't ignore this any longer. They needed to talk about this. Dean needed to know where he stood with them now. Castiel needed to make it known what his expectations were. But first he needed to wait for Dean to calm down. There was no point in trying to talk with him when Dean was in this mood. So instead, he healed Sam's lip and went about fixing the room up with his powers. That's all he could do for the moment.

The smell instantly hits them. Its iron-like and Dean immediately holds his arm over his face, refusing to gag in front of the angel next to him, who on his part doesn't seem all that bothered by the smell. Dean knows he can smell it because he's even more on alert than he has been. Dean reaches for his gun, clocks the trigger and pushes the door open all the way, keeping his arm firmly in place.
“Hmm...” The creature's lips vibrated against his skin. Dean caught sight of Cas who had now narrowed his eyes, his fists clenching at his sides. It was like he was trying to hold back his possessiveness over Dean. Dean could see the fight in him, could see it had taken great strength for him not to attack, to pull Dean away from this revolting thing. If it had been Dean, he would have already given into that fight, causing chaos in its wake. He admired the angel in that moment, his heart thumped again with the relief that Cas was able to hold himself back… for now. Who knew what would happen if Cas had sprung on the Shadow in that moment.
Sam took a step back, satisfied that he'd finally gotten through. Dean didn't spare his brother another thought, he needed to wake Cas and he needed to do it now. A new urgency pushed him forward into his room and across over to his bed. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that Sam had closed the door behind him to give him some space, but he knew he was lurking out there, waiting, because Cas was Sam's friend and he was worried.
When it was clear to Sam that he wasn't going to elaborate, he spoke in a hushed, cautious voice. “Should he be sleeping?”
-Supernatural – Supernatural – Supernatural – Supernatural
A knock sounded at the door, breaking whatever spell they were under, sending reality crashing in around them. Dean jerked in surprise, panic filling him up, making him want to run. But he forced himself to stay put. The look Cas was sending him making him want to stay, making him not want to run. He was pleading with him.
He got into the front seat of the Impala and waited for Dean to return. He finally emerged twenty minutes after Cas left. What had taken him so long? He faced out of the side window, refusing to look the hunter in the eyes. He could feel the concern pouring off him, but he refused to give in to him. Refused to show him just how much his words pierced his heart.
“I'm exhausted. I should sleep. Will you, uh, you know? Come lie with me?”
He felt Cas shiver and Dean frowned. Was he cold? He shouldn't be cold. Angels don't get cold. Fear started to fill him again. Cas wasn't okay. He was dying. He was going to leave him. “Cas...” He didn't know what to say. Didn't know how to help. The feeling of being useless started worm its way into his brain.
The tears finally came. Racking sobs shook his whole body and he screamed. It was a loud, ear-splitting scream. The purpose was to try and relieve some of the pain from his chest. He'd opened his heart to him, dropped his walls. Yes, he was betrayed by him, but he could have gotten past it, eventually. Now, there was no going back. Cas had made his choice. When he'd gone behind his back, Dean had thought he'd felt he had no choice and he understood. But he didn't understand why Cas had chosen this and he didn't know if he wanted to.
No longer able to hold himself up, he collapsed on the floor, barely registering the pain in his knees as they made contact with the hard floor beneath him. The tears once again came and he let out an almighty yell, screaming until his voice cracked, just so he could feel some relief from the pain.
“Four hours.”
Charging forward, the man throws water over him and Sam knows its holy water. It has no affect. She laughs hysterically using his voice and Sam cringes from the sound of it. “Is that all you've got, lover?”
Cas's eyes darted to the floor, his brows furrowing as though he was trying to work out how to phrase what was to come next. Dean tried to prepare himself for the blow that was to surely follow. When Cas looked back into his eyes, Dean needed to muffle his deep intake of breath. Cas held a new determination, a determination that he'd never seen in those blue eyes before.
Nobody said anything, each casting their eyes across the job at hand. This was going to take too much time, time they didn't have. Shocking him, Cas released his hand, and Dean fought against the urge to chase after him as he made his way across the piles of books. He fisted his hands at his sides and took in a deep breath to calm himself down. He was being needy and he hated it. Never, in all his years of relationships, has he ever felt like this. Maybe it was because he'd thought Cas was dead and that grief was still pulling him down, drowning him. Or maybe it was because there was an imminent threat just up those stairs and behind the metal door. He shook his head, pushing those negative thoughts to the back of his mind. He would deal with this issue later, first they had to survive the night.
That just makes him scream harder.
He walked towards him till they were inches apart. “What do you want then? You don't want me, you can't love me, as you say. But you're willing to allow me to carry on feeling this way? How is that fair? Either you ask me to stay and we try to be something or I will go and try to get over you. What do you want?”
He stared out of the window at the scenery floating past. He forced himself to keep his face stony. He could sense Dean's eyes on him. He could picture it, Dean's eyes flickering between the road and him, concern pouring out of him. It was best if Dean didn't see that he was bothered.
Dean did. No hesitation. No panic. Nothing but arousal and love filling him to the brim, making his heart bounce with need. Cas very carefully pulled his clothing from his body and tossed them away He was now completely naked, completely vulnerable, completely exposed. Cas stood and stripped himself, so very slowly of his own clothes. Dean watched with fascination as the angels own cock sprung free, his mouth dried up and his hands twitched, he wanted to touch it. Perhaps he should have been shocked by wanting such a thing, but he really wasn't. Cas gripped his shoulders, his intent to push him down was evident, but Dean didn't want that, not yet. Without thinking it through properly, without thinking about what he was doing, he gripped Cas's hard cock in his fist. He heard the hiss leave Cas's mouth, and Dean locked his eyes to those blue ones again. The angels eyes were wide, his mouth parted.
Dean stood, anger rolling off of him. Castiel refused to back down. He knew he was in the right and if Dean couldn't control his emotions, then that was his problem. He allowed his own anger to surface. Anger he didn't realise he was holding onto. What was he angry at exactly? Maybe it was the fact that Dean didn't think he was capable of love, maybe he was angry at himself for allowing all of this come to come to light, or maybe it was the fact that Dean was acting childish over some pie, or maybe it was all of the above.
Dean perks up at this. “Who was it?”
He mourned Cas. He wasn't dead, so he he didn't mourn him like he was. He mourned what they had shared. He mourned that they would never share that again. Cas was gone, prey to that baby. He knew if he found him, it wouldn't matter. Cas would side with Kelly over him. He knew this. He accepted it for what it was.
It was a fact, Dean as shitty person. He'd allowed Cas to believe he doesn't feel anything for him, allowed him to believe it was all one sided all because it was easier than facing the truth. Anger swirled through his veins like fire, burning strong. He could no longer hold it in, no longer hold back. He let out an almighty roar of anguish, his hands pulling hard on his short hair, making his scalp tingle and burn. The tears kept flowing. He was angry at Cas, so very angry. Why did he have to say it? Why did he have to make it a thing? But he was more angry with himself. How could he hurt his best friend like that? He should have kept his thoughts, his sexual desires, his lips to himself. If he'd done that then none of this would have happened, and Cas would carry on, oblivious.
The back of his legs hit the bed and he sat down heavily, sinking into the mattress. The tears had started to come fast and hot now and he tried desperately to suck in a lungful of air. Is this what people mean when they say emotional overload? Is this what was happening now?
Dean wanted to think that things had completely and utterly gone back to normal after the conversation with Cas. It seemed to have gone back to normal. Cas was being… Cas. The bond he shared with Cas was still there and they were able to talk with each other as though nothing had changed. But every time Dean looked at him, he could see the hurt clear as day behind his blue eyes. This in turn hurt Dean. He hated how hurt Cas was. He hated that he couldn't do anything to ease the angel of his torment. He wasn't really all that surprised to find Cas was still in pain. Nobody got over being in love that quickly. He just wished he could help.
His release came. He squirted hard and fast into the condom. His heart was beating erratically, his breaths came fast and a moan slipped past his lips. When he had finally stopped, he pulled out of the girl. She was smiling a satisfied smile. He returned it. Dean slid off the condom and tied it, while she pulled up her jeans. He followed suit. Before he could stop her, she placed a kiss on his wet lips and hummed. She thanked him and he watched as she purposefully walked out of the alley.
He had to lick his lips before answering. “Yeah?”
Cas looked taken aback for a moment, then he stood, a new sense of determination rippling off of him. “Never,” he growled. “No matter what happens now, no matter what comes next, I would never be sorry for that.”
Without fully thinking it through, he was out of the car and striding towards Cas. Cas didn't turn or acknowledge his presence. Dean leaned against the car next to his best friend and eyed him cautiously from the corner of his eye. Cas had his eyebrows furrowed in confusion… or was it pain? His head tilted to the side. He was clearly trying to work something out, the pain was now masked with confusion. And god didn't he just love that look on him? It looked kind of adorable.
All too soon, Dean pulled away, panting, eyes full of lust, a swipe of tongue over his lower lip. Castiel marvelled in, his own breaths coming fast. “Why, Dean?” His voice was deeper than normal, full of the arousal that was still swimming through his body.
Sam was worried about him. He could see it in his eyes, every time he looked at him. Dean couldn't even mention the words 'Cas' and 'dead' in the same sentence. He swallowed down the pain, tried to drink it all away. Nothing worked.
This feeling, it was just sexual attraction, that's all. There were no feelings involved. And Dean knew that if he was ever going to cross that line, he needed to have feelings as well. But he didn't have them. Would probably never have them. He wasn't the type to just fall in love easily. This isn't love. It's as far away from love as it could possibly get.
He started to squirm, the panic consuming him. “Do you mean it?” Cas's voice broke through the panic and he froze, his heart started pounding again, dangerously fast.
He swallowed thickly, ignoring it. Putting his walls back up. Cas couldn't stay. Cas would never be able to stay. This was never going to work. Dean nodded his understanding, slowly shutting himself off from the pain that was threatening to swallow him whole. He rolled over and climbed out of bed, reaching for his boxers.
“But what if you don't, Cas?”
Cas smiled shyly at him, feeling his heart burst with happiness. “I do now.” They kissed again, just a small press of the lips, but still as loving and gentle. “We need to find Jack.” He hated to break the spell, hated to break this moment. But it wasn't fair to leave all the work to Sam. Dean sighed.
“Do you want some help?” Sam asked.
Why hadn't he done this to begin with? Why hadn't he given Cas the comfort he needed. Slow realisation came to him. This is what he needed. He needed this comfort. The comfort that his brother couldn't give him. He in turn buried his face into Cas's neck. He deeply inhaled the smell that was just Cas, and this alone was enough to comfort him. A few tears escaped as the pain that had been clawing at his insides slowly eased off. Yes, this was what he needed.
Dean nodded, not quite believing it. Not giving himself that kind of hope just yet.
It wasn't enough for Dean, though. He wanted so much more. He wanted to feel the way he'd felt in the back of the Impala, on their very first and only night together.
Dean stopped, his eyes catching something of interest.  Then he moved on, clearly it wasn't important to the case. Castiel's eyes caught Dean licking his lower lip and heat spread throughout his lower abdomen as he thought back to the last time Dean had licked that lip.
This was a different kind of heart break. A type of heart break that he knew he wouldn't get over all that quickly. One that would keep his shattered heart a mix of broken pieces that he would never be able to put back together again.
“Before anything happens, I need to clear some things up myself.” Understanding took over the fear in Dean's eyes and he nodded once for him to continue. Castiel took a deep breath. “First of all, I need to apologize. I thought I was doing the right thing and the last thing I wanted was to hurt you, you have to know that.”
Cas didn't hold back, thrusting full force of an angel into Dean, hitting his prostate every time. “Dean, it feels so good.”
Finally he pulled up to the bunker. Cas was out before Dean had come to a full stop. Confusion swelled. He can't be hurt by this. If Dean kept thinking that, over and over again, maybe, just maybe he could convince himself that it was true. But deep down he knew it wasn't.
Anger will be what makes him survive. Anger will be what pushes him forward. Anger will be what keeps him fighting this losing war.
They were back in that dreadful world again. Lucifer was there. Crowley was there. The plan was insane. So very insane. But as he watched Crowley stab himself with the angel blade, he felt a shiver run down his spine. This was it. This is where they capture the devil. But then Cas was moving towards Lucifer, a hard glint in his eyes, determination set in his body.
Sam pushed away from the wall and allowed his arms to swing by his sides. Dean couldn't move, couldn't think. “What the hell was that, Dean?”
Cas held still and Dean was thankful for that. He didn't know how Cas had managed this. Had he been in constant pain? He shivered with that thought as the guilt started to worm its way in. He tried to push it away, this wasn't the time to feel that, he could allow that to plague him after. Cas pushed in a little bit more and Dean hissed through his teeth. Cas froze.
Dean took a step towards him, unsure of what his next actions were going to be, all reasoning had fled now. The anger was pushed down and instead a mantra played on loop in his head. 'Cas is alive. Cas is alive. Cas is alive.'. “You're sorry for everything? That's very vague, Cas.” He took another step towards him, slowly, cautious of the angels reaction. Cas snapped his eyes back to Dean's. “I have a few things to tell you.” Confusion made Cas frown deeply and Dean knew he didn't know whether he wanted to hear it or not. Tough. He was going to listen whether he wanted to or not.
Dean closed his eyes, gathering the strength he needed to say what he needed to say next. When he opened his eyes again, he wished he'd kept them closed because he hated that sorrowful look upon the angel. He clenched his fists tightly, forcing himself not to reach out. “Then I need you to leave.”
Cas smiled, pressing his lips to Dean's. Dean pressed back gently, humming with contentment. All too soon, though, Cas pulled back, his smile still in place. “I think you should eat something.”
Realising it has gotten distracted, it focuses back on the human and slithers up its body, licking at the air around the human. It moves deliciously slow, savouring this moment. It has never entered a vessel before and it wants to enjoy every moment of this. It moves closer and notices that the human hasn't sensed it.
A few more moments had passed, Dean mumbling 'no', over and over again. Eventually he turned to look at Cas. Cas's eyes were filled with concern now and Dean ignored it. He couldn't go there. “Please, just help me get Sam to the car.” He looked down at the angel with pleading eyes, pleading to just drop it, to leave it alone.
“Why? Because you're in love with me?” Castiel fought the urge to pull back, to escape. His arousal now forgotten. He didn't think Dean would be the first to say it. He didn't think Dean would be the first to acknowledge it. “I would never condemn you for that, Cas.”
Quickly, he moved to the edge of the bed, not allowing the nausea and the dizziness to take control just yet. “Please, don't go. I can't… I can't do this any more.”
He decides to head back to the motel, perhaps Sam got held up. Perhaps the reason he's not answering his phone is because he switched it to vibrate by accident. But he knows that isn't the case, he knows this because Sammy knows better than that, especially when on a hunt.
It could feel the frustration grow within this human vessel, could feel it building, slowly, like a fire. It has never felt frustration before and it decided he didn't much care for it. How did humans feel like this constantly?
“I can't forgive you, not yet, Cas, but-” But what? He bit his lower lip and he stared a burning hole into the floor. How should he finish that sentence? When he looked back up to Cas, what he saw there took his breath away. Hope. He was hoping Dean wasn't going to push him away.
Eyeing Cas for a moment, he tries to think what could possibly have him so unfocused. Being an angel, Castiel is familiar with war and battle, all things mission oriented. So, why is he so distracted? Wanting to push, to find out, to help his friend, he steps closer, watching for any signs that Cas is going to back off. He doesn't, he keeps his feet firmly planted to the floor, his eyes once more darting to the beds. He desperately tries to keep a lid on his anger, his frustration, because that won't help him here, it would only serve to push the angel away.
All he could hear was the blood pumping in his ears, his heart beating erratically in his chest. He ran his hands through his short hair, gripping tightly, trying to relieve the pressure of the pain that was rattling around inside him. Distantly he heard the motel room door slam shut and silently he prayed that it wasn't Cas. He couldn't bear to see him. Not now. The tears continued to flow and no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't stop them.
“Fine. You being the nerd can figure it out.” He stood and stretched his arms above his head. Castiel watched in awe as his t-shirt revealed the tiniest sliver of skin. He licked his lips as the arousal came forth again, going south this time. Dean looked down at him and he froze. Castiel allowed his eyes to catch Dean's. And for a moment nothing else mattered, nothing else existed. It was just the two of them. Castiel was about to stand, not sure whether he was going to kiss the guy or drag him to his room. Thankfully he didn't need to make the decision. Sam coughed awkwardly. Dean dropped his arms and flicked his eyes to his brothers. The spell was broken and Castiel was left panting. “I'm going to go out and get beer. We're out.” Dean finished and moved past Castiel.
Castiel hadn't gone far. He was leaning against the Impala, arms crossed, his brows furrowed in anguish. He hadn't meant what he'd said to Dean. He wasn't going to leave. He could never leave Dean, no matter how much pain he was in. But he was just tired of it. Tired of feeling this way. Tired of Dean not wanting to talk about it, then suddenly jabbing at it till it bled. That's what was happening now. He was bleeding on the inside and no matter what he did he couldn't stop it. He pictured the way Dean had looked at him, the agony that had played across his face.
Cas darted his eyes uncomfortably to the bed. “Come on. Let's get you in bed.”
Dean closed his eyes, willing this burning fire to just go away. When he opened them again and caught Cas's eyes, he sucked in a sharp breath at the sorrow that now filled them. He forced himself to look away as he felt the anger start to subside. His thoughts ran back to the kiss they'd just shared. He thought about the love and longing they'd both poured into it. And what was he doing now? Causing another problem, that's what. He was allowing his self-destructive side to come to the surface. He was starting to sabotage his one chance to make this right. Again, he closed his eyes and took in a couple of steadying breaths. He wasn't going to do this again. He wasn't going to ruin it this time. He couldn't.
“I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.” It hurt. Everywhere. He didn't want to let him go, not like this. He understood, so much. He understood why Cas needed to say goodbye, understood why he needed this to end. He was protecting himself, again. Always the need to protect himself, it shouldn't be that way.
A small girl was sitting by the lake now, her feet submerged in the water. She was throwing small pieces of white bread for the ducks. The ducks greedily swam towards her and she giggled.
Castiel tried to wriggle free, try to get the upper hand, but with the pain in his head and his vision blurry, there wasn't much he could do. He didn't know how many attackers there were, through the haze he could only see two, but there could be more behind. He tried to swivel his head around to get a better look. It was impossible. The angels seemed to be dragging him for ages, but Castiel guessed it was only a few minuets. Eventually they released his arms and in the distant he could hear a female voice. There was no way he could tell what she was saying, not through the ringing in his ears. He tried to move, tried to get a better look, needing to see how many angels he would be up against. But before he had a chance, hands grabbed him again, gripping and pulling everywhere. He groaned through gritted teeth, kicking his legs out, thrashing his arms, trying to find a target, but it was useless. They had him firmly. He felt the wind rush past his face as they hoisted him up, shackling his wrists above his head. His feet barely touched the floor. Looking up he found his vision was returning to normal. There were four angels that he could see. That was good. Better than he was expecting.
Please comment...
, in his arms. In that moment, he knew he wasn't coming back from this. He knew the guilt was going to consume him, the grief was going to kill him and his brother would eventually be all alone.
Dean fell asleep within minuets. Feeling safe and content and happy and loved.
Castiel huffed a sigh of relief. He wasn't running from his feelings, from what happened last night. He was running because he thought they were going to break against the strain of being so far apart. “Who said anything about long distance?”
Then one thought popped into his head. One question.
“I love you, Dean. You know that, right?” He nodded slowly, not trusting his voice. “But I can't stand this any more. We barely talk to each other, we barely touch each other, we're constantly cautious around each other, afraid we're going to set the other one off. This isn't working.”
Cas held still for a moment, and then deliciously slowly, he pulled his finger almost all the way out and then pushed it back in. “Mmm!” Dean loved the feeling of it, loved the pleasure of it. Without any warning, he pushed another slicked up finger in, right along the first. Dean could feel the stretch, could feel the fullness of it, could feel the pleasure humming through his system. Cas didn't move his fingers, instead he rose up and over Dean. Reaching up with his other hand, he gripped Dean's chin between his fingers. The look in his eyes took his breath away, pure love, that's what it was and for a moment, doubt started to take form in his mind. Was he really deserving of that love, he didn't think so.
“Who are they? And where can I find them?” he asked, the urgency clear in his gruff voice. He was struggling to contain the fear and Naomi could sense it. He could tell by the pitying look in her cold, dark eyes.
“Dean?” Sam's voice broke the quiet of the room and Dean snapped his eyes back to his brother, worry and nervousness returning. “Want to explain what just happened?”
That was it? He wasn't going to fight to be with him? Did it not mean as much to him? Maybe he'd realised what a huge mistake it had been. Dean didn't think of it like that and he hadn't thought Cas had thought that either… until now that is. He narrowed his eyes at the retreating tan trench coat clad back as anger started to burn through his veins, hotter than he'd felt since this whole conversation started.
When he looked over at Sam, he saw him grinning from ear to ear and he tilted his head in confusion. What did he have to be so happy about? “What?” He may have asked that too sharply but it didn't make Sam stop.
His pace didn't falter, though. He kept the movements going, kept their mouths moving as Cas fisted his cock, as he moved his hand up and down his shaft, twisting and swiping his thumb over the tip.
The silence is piercing. Not a single demon is willing to break it. Sam can only assume that the demon inside of him has just been told something and nobody is sure how she is taking it. He does the only thing he can think of, he zones in on the demon's feelings, emotions. Is she happy? Angry? This is one advantage he has that the other demons don't.
protect me, whatever is necessary.”
“Dean? You could have seriously damaged something. Please, let me heal you,” Cas spoke with so much caring and concern. How could he after what Dean did? This made the anger burn brighter. He couldn't hold it back.
He forced himself to move. Forced himself to clean up the mess. To dispose of the body. To clean the blood. Dean's blood. All of it Dean's blood. Why couldn't he heal him? Why couldn't he do that one thing? All of this… his fault. All his fault.
For a long moment neither said anything and just as Castiel turned to leave again, he heard it. It was barely a whisper but he'd hurt it and that's when the hope rose again.
“Cas, don't stop… Fuck.” Cas sped up and Dean started to push his hips against those talented fingers, needing more, needing so much more.
He couldn't do it.
Castiel took a step towards him. “I have done nothing but help you. I have done nothing but try to be understanding with the dangerous decisions you have made. Why can't you do the same for me?” Dean didn't answer, didn't look like he was going to either. The anger that had been rising within started to burn furiously through his veins. “Answer me,” he finally bellowed.
Feeling so many emotions, so many things.
A clap sounded through the room. “Great. I'll go get showered and then we can discuss what our next move should be,” Dean spoke with an overly cheery voice and it didn't settle well with Castiel. But he didn't allow himself to react to it. He couldn't. This was for Dean. That's what he needed to keep telling himself. This was for Dean.
Cas's eyes softened, his pain shining through his eyes. “Dean-”
Sam came shuffling into the room, looking quite lost. Castiel frowned in concern. What happened between them? He was about to open his mouth to ask when Dean came in behind him. Castiel watched Dean with concern, but relaxed a little when he spotted the small smirk playing at his lips. Castiel's confusion only swelled though when he caught sight of Sam watching his brother with narrowed eyes. Whatever had been said between them, Dean had come out on top and Sam was not happy.
Dean looked up and froze, his hand hovering above a duffel bag, holding one of Cas's t-shirts. Even though he doesn't have a need for them any more, Dean had insisted that it would be more comfortable to lie in bed with and Cas had to agree. It was more comfortable. “What's wrong?” He heard the way Dean's voice shook a little. No one else would have caught it, not even Sam, but he did.
He stopped outside the bunkers door, his heart heavy in his chest. It was better to get this over with. He opened the bunkers door, with a small creak and stepped inside. It was eerily quiet. Careful not to make a sound, he shut the door, his shoulder tensed when it was louder than he wanted it to be. He didn't want to alert Sam to his arrival. The need for Cas, the need to talk to him outweighed whatever his brother must thinking. He'll deal with him later. He descended the stairs, slowly and cautiously, his eyes sweeping the room beyond. Nobody. Were they out looking for him? He hoped not. This talk needed to happen, while Dean still had the courage to go through with it,
And he screams and claws at the demon. He screams till his throat is raw. He claws at her till he's a bleeding mess on the inside. He fights and fights her. He won't let her get to Dean, he won't allow it. But she just laughs at him.
There was no time to process his words. A loud explosion rang out, vibrating off the walls, ringing through his ears. Metal shards tumbled into the map room, as he placed his hands over his ears. His eyes scanned Sam and he noticed he was doing the same. Cas merely stood and watched, fear etched across his features.
Dean stopped pacing and swung around, anger still evident in his eyes. “Why do you always do that? None of this is your fault. None of it. Yet for some strange fucking reason, you feel the need to share the blame. The only person to blame is me and me only. So don't you fucking start blaming yourself, do you hear me? If I hear you talk like that again I'll string you up by your fucking wings. Understand?”
Dean still didn't move, didn't soften, didn't do anything. Defeated, Cas nodded and tried to swallow past the lump that had formed in his throat. He turned and walked to the door, gripping the bag in his hands. He paused, his hand holding the handle. Looking over his shoulder, he smiled sadly. Dean still hadn't moved and it worried him but if he wanted him to leave then that's what he would do. “I just… I just want you to know that I love you and… this past week…. Its been the happiest of my life… and its been a really long life.”
Sam comes over to him, a nervous, crooked smile upon his face. Dean eyes him suspiciously. “What did the doctor say?”
His stomach does a funny little turn and the urge to vomit pushes forward. It won't happen, though, having nothing to bring up except maybe water. Instead, he clutches hard at his stomach in the hopes it will rid him of this feeling.
“Come on, we need to keep moving.” Before Cas could reply, he was already moving around the car to the drivers side and climbing in. As he started the engine again he heard the back door go and knew Cas was now back in his seat.
There was no way he was going to drive while feeling so drained. He didn't look back at Cas as he entered the room. Didn't allow himself to even glance at his brother's questioning eyes. Instead, he forced himself to the bathroom, needing to get ready for bed. Tomorrow was going to be a long day and he needed all the strength he could get.
“We need to find Sam as quick as possible, if last night is anything to go by.” Cas sounds so matter-of-fact about it, it leaves Dean wondering what he's thinking, wondering where the warm Castiel has disappeared to.
Dean's eyes flutter before they permanently close and Sam screams in anguish, shaking him, pleading with him.
There was a few moments of silence before Cas finally looked up and into his eyes. Dean gulped, instantly not wanting to hear it. He wanted to run, wanted to protect himself from the pain he was about to experience, as if he hadn't experienced enough already. At the same time, he was unable to move, grounded by the intense stare being directed at him. He felt his heart pounding, felt his breaths grow faster, felt the sweat starting to bead across his forehead. As much as he was panicking, it was hard not to lash out in anger. That's what he usually did. Whenever he was about to hurt, about to experience emotional turmoil, he lashed out, it masked just how much it hurt or how scared he was.
“He's not using me for sex. We haven't done that. He doesn't want to.”
He hangs up the phone, and looks around the empty hotel room. What's he suppose to do now? He glances around, catches sight of Sam's laptop on the table and rushes towards it, almost tripping over his feet. He pushes open the lid and starts typing. He doesn't know what he's looking for but he can't sit there and do nothing. It makes him feel sick as he thinks about what his brother would say seeing him sat there, using his things. It makes him sick because Sam isn't there to reprimand him about it, isn't there to give him a bitch face like he's a small child doing something incredibly wrong.
Dean awoke a couple of hours later, his heart immediately plummeted to his stomach as he felt the empty space next to him. It was still warm to touch which meant it hadn't been long since Cas had left. He kept his eyes shut as he tried to will the hurt away. He knew it had been too good to be true. He knew Cas would change his mind eventually. He'd hurt him too many times, they weren't simply going to get past this as quickly as he'd hoped. A huge part of him doubted they'd ever get past it. There would always be that underlying fear swimming between them. Cas doesn't trust him not to run again and Dean doesn't trust that Cas wouldn't come to his senses.
Subconsciously, he knows he's been put in a dream world by the demon. He pays it no attention, basking in the joys of the dream instead. It has to be better than the horrors waiting for him in the waking world. He's currently sat in the passenger seat of the Impala, his brother next to him, music blaring. He can't find the sense to switch it off, for some reason its comforting, like being home.
Castiel nodded in agreement and Dean led them back inside the bunker, their hands intertwined. Castiel had never felt happiness quite like this. It was amazing. It was wonderful. It was everything.
“You know why. This is what you want isn't it? For me to get over you? To stop loving you? To feel nothing for you?”
He had been hungry and Sam had offered to go for food. At the time Dean had just been grateful for the gesture, too tired to move from the bed. But its been hours and he's nowhere to be found. This is suppose to be a simple hunt, one or two demons at best.
Then he was left feeling empty, so very empty. He watched as Cas slicked up his cock. Panic started to set in again, but he pushed it down. He could do this. What they had just done felt so good, he knew this would as well… eventually.
Groaning, he switched off the shower and stepped out. Laying on the toilet seat was some clean clothes and a towel. He wondered if it was Sam or Cas. Sam wouldn't have thought of this. It had to have been Cas. Warmth spread through him, starting at his heart and working its way out. His anger vanished immediately.
Dean's smile dropped for a second. A small, petty part of Castiel mentally punched the air in triumph. “Because that's what all dick's do, Cas, they lie.” Dean looked all smug after that. Castiel couldn't take it any more. The anger he felt for Dean in that moment was unlike anything he'd ever felt before. The unwelcome urge to punch him again crossed his mind. “Shall we go then?”
“That's it?” He couldn't help himself, he needed answers and he needed them now. He clenched his fists at his sides as Cas froze, keeping his back to him. “That's it? Really?”
This was always going to happen. Dean was always going to fuck up. This was what he had been trying to avoid. He heaved a sigh as the tears finally slowed. One last time, that's it, he told himself, one last time to get him to come back, if after that he still doesn't come, then he would have to face the obvious.
He tilted his head to the side and worried his bottom lip a little. Did he voice his concerns or just ignore it and go along with the plans? He watched as Dean sighed and dropped the t-shirt, standing straight and crossing his arms over his chest. Cas had come to learn that this was a defensive posture. Was he protecting himself from something?
The library was still illuminated by the back-up generators, thankfully. It was gloomy and shadows were cast across the floor and the furniture. Books were strewn everywhere, chairs upturned and the lamps toppled over. Dean cast a wary eye across the disaster and wondered how in the hell they were suppose to find what they were looking for in this mess.
“Cas? It's Dean.” There was silence on the other end of the phone and Dean pulled the phone from his ear to check that the angel hadn't hung up. “You there?” he asked hesitantly.
The silence was filled with tension, tension that poured off Cas in furious waves. Dean shifted uncomfortably on the bed, his eyes darting to Cas. He was sat at the motel table, his arms on his legs, hands clasped together and his head dipped. He looked so deflated, so vulnerable. Dean had never seen him like that, ever. He'd always seemed so powerful, so commanding. But as Dean watched him, he didn't feel any of that power radiating off him. He seemed almost defeated. Perhaps he was. Perhaps he was defeated in the sense that he couldn't fight his emotions any more.
- SUPERNATURAL -
He watched Cas gulp. “I want to.”
Sorry for the really long wait. Life wasn't kind since I last posted. I'm back though. I just hope you can all forgive me.
When Cas looks back up, his eyes have a new determination and he takes a step back, breaking the connection of their eyes to point his blue ones right at the motel. It takes Dean a moment to get with the programme. Did they almost kiss? He can't seem to wrap his mind around that possibility, still hung up on the fact that Cas doesn't harbour any kind of emotions towards him, except friendship.
