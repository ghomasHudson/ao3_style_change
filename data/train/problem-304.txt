Same issue re: dark blue.
John smiled. “Let’s save it. For a special occasion. I can think of lots of possibilities. Can’t you?”
John charged up the stairs after Sherlock and grabbed him around the waist from behind once they reached the landing. He turned Sherlock around and backed him into the sitting room, breathless at the intensity of Sherlock’s eyes, until they stood at the epicenter of everything, caught between their chairs where they shared their evenings, the desks where they shared their work, the kitchen where they shared their chaos, surrounded by all the artifacts of a life built together.
He cleared his throat and looked out the cab window.
They hadn’t been out of the flat much since Sherlock began his recovery, other than their walks around the park when the weather cooperated. Sherlock’s moods had been erratic, and there were days when dragging himself out of bed was almost too much. Healing was ugly and difficult and slow, even for a man as effortlessly beautiful and brilliant as Sherlock. But he
“How did you identify him, though?” Lestrade asked. “Your last text made no sense; something about an ink splatter?”
John raised an eyebrow at him, but said nothing. Instead, he slipped the tray of raisin-stuffed biscuits into the oven and disappeared into the sitting room. A moment later, familiar strains of music drift into the sweltering kitchen, music that makes Sherlock stand up straighter and automatically shift his feet to first position.
“Ok, see you then” There was a moment more of muffled sound,
Baker Street, Sherlock's bedroom, the small hours
Lestrade contacted the Port of London police and arranged to meet them at the main container depot and he and Sherlock made their way to the docks. Sherlock having upgraded the case to an eight was in full flow, deduction spilling over deduction in the haste to leave his mouth. He concluded that the murderer was still on board the Star of Brazil, a container vessel sailing under the Liberian Flag and almost certainly being used for smuggling as well as legitimate cargo. Bored at the pace Lestrade and the Port of London officers’ investigations were proceeding, Sherlock decided to do a bit of snooping on his own.
“I don’t know how you know that but yes we devised it when we were boys, working on it instead of doing our lessons in Sunday school, but no one other than us two ever knew how to use it. It drove my sisters wild not knowing what the figures stood for.”
Sherlock has only one thing on his mind on reaching London; more crucial than attending to Baker Street or helping the police with their enquiries. He has to see Molly.
“I knew then… what I hadn’t been able to admit while he was alive, too late. But life goes on, I met Mary and I was happy for a while, even more so once he came back but then Mary died, and I was angry with them both and life itself until I saw him put a gun against his temple and I knew that if he died I wouldn’t want to go on living; even though I have Rosie now so somehow I would have had to. I can’t explain what’s changed, I can't even tell you what makes it feel so right, I only know if he as much as lifted a finger I'd come running.
“Of Ferdie? He was stupid good-looking boy who thought he was in love with me… but I never suspected him, no.”
Crowley sobered up and sat attentively as Aziraphale fumbled through a number of increasingly outlandish schemes to make the obtuse Dr Watson recognise the error of his ways and fall for the charms, and into the arms of his former flatmate, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock refrained from adding James’ legitimacy as fuel to the fire, he would leave that to come out into the open of its own accord. Finally, he was able to make his excuses and escape.
“Possibly.” Mycroft sounded bored.
“Unfortunately, I think there is nothing to be gained by intervention. I doubt very much that Miss Sutherland will thank me for it, and to learn that her mother, stepfather and employer had colluded in this manner would destroy what little home life she already possesses.”
Steve listened to Sherlock’s requests without interruption, it was clear he had heard all about the missing boy and Dr Watson. Once he was sure that the detective had finished, he answered simply, “I will meet you at the gates at quarter past seven, I’ll be in the truck.”
“I’m here to see one of the inmates.”
221b was in darkness when John and Rosie finally reached the top of the seventeen steps to the little flat that they called home. It tugged at his heart strings to see Rosie walk into their sitting room and call for Sherlock, and to see her face fall when she realised that again he wasn’t there. He tried to tell himself that it was her disappointment that made him feel so down, on top of the cold and depressing day that he had had.
As John spoke, Mary’s emotions, as displayed by her general demeanour and posture, ranged from incredulity, to sorrow, to anger and back to disbelief.
Sherlock was reluctantly persuaded to stretch his legs, and use the facilities, while John got coffee for them both and found a place to sit. Sherlock was still silent, leaning back in his seat, apparently lost in gloomy speculation until suddenly he sat up, stared at John and said the first words he had spoken for over two hours.
“Stop with me, I know a place.”
“Of course, I’m not an idiot!”
had turned to Sherlock and pointing to a man in the crowded foyer whispered urgently in his ear “go on, do that thing you do, on him”.
“A few minutes later Paul Cloete appeared, minus the gun and his cap, running towards the Lodge, where Crowder was still outside in his garden. He cried out to Crowder that his father was dead by the mere and turned to run back. Crowder, who is not a young man, ran after him. When he saw the body, he knew there was nothing to be done, but he called an ambulance and the police.”
John sighed. “Fine. I’ll make the appointment for you and explain.
I do believe Sherlock is having a rather coarse effect on your manner, brother mine. Nonetheless, you have my sincere congratulations. A gift for my niece should be arriving at your cottage shortly.
Sherlock turned onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow with a groan, then peeked out with one eye.
Sherlock, will you take John to be your lawful wedded husband, to be loving, faithful and loyal to him for the rest of your life together?
“Sherlock, I… I know we’ve talked about this a hundred times, but I just have to…” John chewed on the inside of his lip, looked away. “You’re sure you want this with me? Really, really sure? You want
His brain helpfully supplied him with several options.

Sherlock carries right along with his prancing and sniffing, though a tiny smile quirks at the corner of his mouth. “Since I got engaged,” he replies, dropping to the ground to look more closely at the victim’s blood-darkened hair.
Time to lay some groundwork.
“Because I’m in love with Sherlock, and I always have been, and I was too much of a coward to do anything about it before he left. But you can be damn certain I’m not letting the chance slip away this time.”

There were boxes, everywhere.
He'd changed his mind.
He hoped so. He hoped it was obvious to everyone that after all this time, they belonged to each other, that they moved together and around each other with the easy familiarity of years and love.
“Well, I suppose I can forgive you that, then.”
They'd always spent quality time together. He'd always bought things for Sherlock on occasion, when he saw something he needed or wanted. He'd even told Sherlock of his admiration in words, though not in the most romantic terms, he supposed. He'd tried to get closer to the truth, to say something that couldn't be as easily written off as friendship or admiration. And it had worked better than the other three love languages, at least. There'd been a crack in Sherlock's defenses last night, one he’d been sorely tempted to push at. If the final trial didn't do it, he'd definitely be trying words of affirmation again.
“Okay, young man,” Mrs. Hudson said, her tone scolding. “It’s time to share all that wool you’ve been gathering. I know you’re hopeless at these things, so I’ll help you start. Why on Earth haven’t you moved back in yet?”

Sherlock pushed up into the kiss with a desperate groan and climbed fully into John’s lap. John tugged at Sherlock’s curls again (quite possibly a new addiction), and Sherlock gasped against John’s mouth. Perfect opportunity; the kiss deepened, tongues curling in a hot, slow slide, one or the other or both of them humming and groaning and melding their bodies together.

And suddenly they were back in time, six months, standing together in the sitting room of 221B with John furious, Sherlock near death, and Mary a suspicious blend of contrite and cold. They’d always be stuck in an endless loop of that moment, John thought. As long as there was Sherlock, John would never be able to stay away. As long as Sherlock needed him, he would always be the priority. And Mary would always be a danger.
“Let’s go, love,” he said, tugging at their joined hands.
Can you blame me? A man of my humble origins, landing a gorgeous thing like you?
[They both close their eyes for a long moment]
Sherlock’s lips parted at the overwhelming sense memory of that scruffy almost-beard prickling at his chin, his cheek, his throat—god, he was tempted. He hadn’t been with anyone since that night in Karachi, and with John sharing his space again the need was a constant simmer just under his skin, hot and yearning.
“Me too.”
John gave a helpless little laugh. Mummy couldn’t have possibly chosen three more couple-y gifts, except maybe a two-person sleeping bag. He wouldn’t have put that past her, though. He shot her a quick look with raised eyebrows

Please consider yourself warned—the next chapter will be rated M. You can easily skip that chapter without losing any plot if more mature content isn't your thing. There will be two chapters tomorrow.
Sherlock shrugged. "It's not something that comes up often. You know how I am. There aren't many people in the world who can tolerate me."
“And then he did the same to me, too, just to make sure I didn’t get any ideas.”
“I can’t go back to Mary.”
The Officer’s Lounge is a completely made up thing. I have no idea if such a thing exists. I needed a fireplace, so I made one.

that implied so strongly that she may as well have said the true thing itself: John Watson was in love with Sherlock Holmes, and he always had been. Even as he took vows to another, even as he left and ran and denied, he loved so fiercely that it broke through his toughest walls and made itself known to everyone who cared to look.

Except the photo was filled with ghosts, lingering in the shadows, behind happy smiles and glistening tinsel. The chair where Mary had sat, awaiting John’s forgiving lies. The false promise of a child, never fulfilled. Another suicide, or as-good-as, a plane, and goodbyes made with every word except the one they really wanted to say.
But then I almost did it to you again. Twice. On the plane. And Culverton Smith. The drugs. The… everything.

Sherlock pressed his lips together, his eyes on John’s for a long moment. He nodded.
John nodded against the hard press of his palms. “A suicide mission.”

“I’m quite sure it’s the other way around,” he’d admitted quietly. “I don’t think he’s interested in… relationships.”
There will be one more very short chapter today.
Despite everything, Mary, you did give me two things that I will always be grateful for.
He closed his eyes against the rush of heat. He’d cried so many times lately. Tears were always waiting just beneath the surface these days, and the memory of Sherlock’s arms around him the last time made it all the worse. “He probably does know and just doesn’t say anything to spare me the humiliation. And that’s why I can’t move back in. Because we…”
Sherlock hid a smile against John’s leg, then looked up at John through his lashes.
(Also apologies to the wedding photographer and random men who were stolen for the venue page. It looks like their wedding was really sweet, though, and it gave a good view of the other end of the room.)
“I’m… I just need…” he managed, gaze glued to the floor, but another scrape sounded, then there were two polished leather shoes in his view and a warm body just inches away.
“I send it all to the people in the planes. I visualize it flowing from me to them. I give it all away.”
Maybe it was time to talk.

lose everything, too. And I know what it’s like to have a second chance that could ruin everything all over again. How do you decide if the risk is worth it?”
To Sherlock, they were a refuge.
The cup of tea shook in his hand as a stab of pain shot through his leg and shoulder. He closed his eyes against the flood of awful memories, the loneliness, the aching emptiness that came with being violently expelled from your perfect place in the universe, the place where you fit more than anywhere else. His right hand tightened around the handle of the tea cup.

With slow, measured movements, Sherlock took the bottle of scotch from the side table and replaced the stopper. John, without a word, handed his full glass over, too. The ice cubes clinked against the the glass walls, mostly melted, and condensation ran cold down Sherlock’s wrist as he carried both the glass and the bottle to the kitchen. The bottle went on a high shelf far out of John’s reach, in among the pots and crockery they rarely used. He moved to the sink to empty the glass… then paused.
“It was. It was me wishfully thinking I could get on my knees for you right there in the middle of our sitting room, suck you down and make you scream.

“Okay, John.”
“Because it’s what you want!” Sherlock half-shouted. He rolled to a sitting position on the edge of the bed and propped his elbows on his knees, hunching over to wrap his hands around the back of his head. His voice, when it came again, was muffled in his chest. “It’s what you’ve always wanted. Wife, kids, suburbs, normal life,
You shot him. You shot him and I could never quite forgive you for that, even when I said I did. You lied. You kept false identities even after you had supposedly retired. You ran away. You were horrible. But I was horrible, too. I ran off with Sherlock constantly. I hardly saw you in the days leading up to Rosie’s birth unless you came to 221b. I cheated. Never physically, but god I wanted to. And not even with the woman on the bus.
“It’s not about trust, it’s about ethics and…” John sighed. “Oh, fine, I’ll call Mycroft. I want to read up and double-check myself on interactions first, though, maybe get a second opinion.”
Seriously?
“What about that one?” Sherlock asked despite his foul mood, reluctant to speak or engage with the festivities in any beyond the required. He couldn’t believe that after all the build up, after all the supportive words and not-so-gentle encouragement, everyone seemed committed to ignoring the change in he and John’s relationship, but his curiosity over the package got the better of him.
John fixed Mrs. Hudson with a baleful stare.
Yes. Yes, I want to be more honest. Yes, I have things to tell you. Things I’ve never said. I don’t think you truly want to hear them, but if you insist on total honesty then I will oblige. I promised myself I would never lie to you again.
And so he looked. He looked for as long as he could until his vision went blurry.
With their stomachs full and their bill paid, John held the door open for Sherlock and followed him out into the crisp night air, the low level hum of contentment following them from the restaurant. Their shoulders brushed with every step, and John bit back a smile. The evening felt

A faint whiff of cinnamon and nutmeg followed John into the cluttered kitchen—a delivery of Mrs. Hudson’s spiced scones could be expected that afternoon, then, excellent—and a pile of mail dropped unceremoniously next to his left elbow.

Mary appeared in the open doorway of the flat, a bit out of breath from the climb, but cold and hard all the same.

“You have better things to be doing with your mouth now.”
John opened his mouth to protest, but Mycroft charged on. “And what of my dear brother? I do hope you aren’t entertaining any illusions of playing happy families and raising a baby in Baker Street. Do you truly think that would work?”

“While we nibble on starters, why don’t you two open your gifts? Don’t be cross with me, Sherlock, I’m your mother and I can give you gifts when I want to.”
John flexed his fist. Licked his lips, looked away and back again.
John waggled the baby monitor. “Both children are sleeping, so I thought I’d come down for a cuppa, if you’re free.”
John answered by opening the door and striding confidently into the sitting room. Sherlock followed, glaring.
Yeah. It’s good.
He took a breath, tried in vain to make the words pass from thought to sound, from heart to tongue, and shook his head.
But the distant planes and the broken soldiers, yes. That he could do.
It was an outpouring.

“Remind me to sleep in late, then,” Sherlock said, sounding halfway to sleep already. John risked a glance at his expression; sure enough, his eyes were shut, his face turned toward John like he wanted to roll onto his side but wouldn’t allow it.
“God, yeah, you’re a genius,” John breathed over Sherlock’s lips.
"Sherlock, if you're still pretending for the sake of the guys, now would be the time to stop before this goes too far," John gasped, thrusting involuntarily from the proximity of Sherlock's hand. God, he wanted to kiss him again and never stop.
“Don’t suppose I could convince you two to come back to the station and give me a statement before you go dashing off,” Lestrade interrupted, then took a step back, as if sensing he had walked into an awkward moment.
No! No, it was a relief, honestly. I never want to see that place ever again.

John tears his gaze away from Sherlock’s sly mouth and holds a finger to his lips, meeting Greg’s astonished eyes. “We’re having a party to announce it this weekend. Saturday at seven. Don’t go letting on before then,” he says with a wink.

John sat in their booth and faced the door, the envelope with the parental order paperwork on the seat beside him. He ordered an appetizer and two glasses of champagne rather than a bottle—Sherlock was halfway off the suboxone, but mixing could still be problematic—and settled in to wait.
By way of reply, Sherlock fled into his bedroom, darting past John with all of his feline agility. Something like guilt or embarrassment twisted in his stomach, made him slam the door behind him and shove the wine under the bed like a dirty magazine hidden from a parent. He sat on the floor next to the bed, forearms propped on his knees, waiting for his heart to stop its attempt at flight.

When they broke apart, breathing heavily despite the adagio tempo of the kiss, Sherlock felt the flush in his cheeks, the smile he couldn’t hide, and saw their mirror in John Watson.
But then they were off, jumping fences, hailing cabs, ruining their nice clothes in pursuit of a man with a fascinating obsession with antique clocks and ex-girlfriends. Wordless communication, instinctive protection, inappropriate laughter, and scolding from the DI.
Paper ripped, bows unraveled, and gifts were admired, until everything had been opened save the tiny package from Mycroft’s pocket.

This day has been a long time coming. John and Sherlock have demonstrated their commitment to each other over and over, in countless ways over many years. Just one hour ago, they bound themselves together as family when Sherlock formally adopted Rosamund Watson, giving her the name Watson-Holmes. Now, they take on that name as well with their exchange of vows, the last and most tangible step to tie their lives wholly together. Before the vows, I would like to invite the Maid of Honor, Molly Hooper, to share a brief reading in honor of the occasion:

, it was so dirty, made him feel so needy and desperate, and the pleasure burned low in his stomach, coiling tighter and tighter, right on the edge, until John pressed one finger directly over Sherlock’s entrance,

“Well, who’s fault is that?” he spat before he could stop himself. He closed his eyes, took a breath. Forgiveness. Right. Not bloody likely. He hadn’t lasted a week.
Sherlock murmured into John’s hair. “I’m feeling an extreme need to kiss the father of my child.”
“Let them. I want them to,” he said, his voice rough, and he gave a weak laugh. “I should be so lucky, that people would think you’d want to be with me.”

The water ran, and John backed off, his heart racing. Back to the task at hand.

I don’t think I’ll ever be completely rid of that fear, Sherlock. I’m always going to remember what it felt like when you were dead. I’m always going to remember you laying there in a pool of blood, how it felt when you jumped, how it felt when I found you in that hospital bed. You kept trying to leave me—
Not good enough.
In the meantime, here’s the short version

But John Watson wasn’t meant to be still. His body was made for motion.
“You were a right arse is what you were,” he cut in. “You and your posh boy here—

“Here, drink this,” he said, passing him the water glass. “You’re probably dehydrated, and you’ll need your mouth wet enough to dissolve the tablet.”
I am so sorry. God, I am SO SORRY I didn’t say something right away when I read your letter. If that had been my letter, I would have been completely panicking, probably at the bottom of a bottle within an hour. Thank you for telling me. Thank you for trusting me. I hope you know that there is no universe in which this would ever drive me away from you. And if you didn’t already know that, well... I owe you even more apologies. We’ve already established what a shit friend I’ve been to you. This is just further proof.
No, John couldn’t miss Christmas, not after everything, not when they were so close, when Sherlock could already picture the look on John’s face when he saw him in his best clothes, could practically taste the wine on John’s lips.
: I want to quit drinking entirely, at least until I’m well again. My sister the recovering alcoholic says she’s incapable of having just a little. Same genetics. Similar issues. I think it’s best if I don’t drink for a while. I poured out everything in the house, and I’ll continue keeping this log until my next appointment on Tuesday. I need to find other ways to calm down.
With his worry temporarily assuaged, he set about his tasks. Medication first; Sherlock wouldn’t likely have much luck eating until his withdrawal symptoms eased enough for his stomach to settle. He took out the bottle, carefully cut one of the tablets in half, then dug into another packed box for a water glass and filled it under the tap. Back in the bedroom, he set both down on the bedside table and sat on the edge of the bed, resting a hand on Sherlock’s hip.

), but this—still dangerous territory. Things were so fragile, and Sherlock feared anything that might cause them to slide back into those dark waters. He would sooner drown himself than drag John back down to their shared hell.
“Oh, how noble. I could have sworn you were ready to go for it that day I barged in. You looked so sweet, about to confess everything, but I didn’t feel like waiting around for you to break up with me. So sorry.”
Leave it to Sherlock to bull rush right into the topic while John, stunned and terrified, clenched his jaw and walked his next few steps with his eyes closed. His heart hammered, a panicked rhythm, heavy and suffocating in his throat.
"Oi, your man should be thanking us," Liam said with a scoff, then turned to John. "Who do you think trained him to give those amazing blowjobs you're benefitting from, eh?"
So maybe it’s a moot point.

Then John turned his head, and pressed a single, slow kiss to Sherlock’s sharp cheekbone.
, Sherlock,” John murmured into the skin of his thighs, thrusting and twisting with first one, then two fingers, and Sherlock was inside-out, flying apart from the sparking pleasure in his gut. Another finger, and he whined, high and long, as he drove himself down, fucking himself on John’s hand.

Okay, I’m back at my own flat now, but seriously, keep it to email. I like to at least pretend I’m not a completely open book to him.
I will.
He smirked, and waited. He didn’t wait long.

“Yes,” Mycroft said.
Also hahahaha I completely forgot about the prompt in the process of writing this porn so please consider me your porny St. Nick bringing you Johnlock smut for the holidays. Short epilogue tomorrow, then we're done!
Well, in some ways I think it needed to happen elsewhere. 221B is so full of… everything.
I don't have any children and I work mostly with teenagers in my day job, so uh... thanks google? Hopefully there's nothing wildly wrong here.
John grabbed Sherlock’s wandering hand under the table and shivered.
He looked inside himself, analyzed and prodded, but found no trace of conflict or regret. The decision was easy. No choice at all, as he’d said. His forgiveness had been a lie from the start.
/ 12:33 PM
A moment later, Mrs. Hudson heaved the greatest, most put-upon sigh in the world.
"That it's the other way round," Sherlock finished for him when he couldn't.
Ah, of
Sherlock doesn’t deny it, doesn’t say anything at all.
"Wait, Sherlock, uh... wait there a tic."

“Brilliant,” John breathed, and his lips turned up into that easy, warm smile, right there in the middle of a filthy alleyway, his face painted in flashing police lights and trickling sweat. The smile that meant baking cookies and Sherlock and
and I needed this I needed this
-- None. Was on a case with Sherlock, no time. Considered having a drink to help me sleep when my brain was too loud to let me relax, but I was already upstairs in my room
Heaven, heaven, heaven.
Sherlock mumbled something recalcitrant, but popped the pill under his tongue as ordered.
God, it was the most excruciating conversation he'd ever participated in. Sherlock blinked for another two minutes in processing overload. Finally, his deductive brain seemed to re-engage, and he fixed John with an intense stare.
“You, though,” he said. “You get more… swishy.”
“Sherlock, there’s a card here from your parents,” John called out, shuffling through the day’s mail as he came up from Mrs. Hudson’s flat.
“I’m glad,” Lestrade said, low and fierce. “The two of you deserve it. It’s been a long time coming, though I guess I don’t have to tell you that.”
Diffuse any sense of blame. Blame matters less than solving a problem.
[Written on heavy off-white paper and sealed in an envelope embossed with a stylized WH]
“Call me Mummy, dearest,” she said, and went back to poking at the bacon.
The flat echoed with John’s absence, the walls reflecting Sherlock’s unrest back to him, multiplied and layered. So he filled it with music instead. He raised his bow, set the instrument properly under his chin, and drew out the long, full notes of Silent Night, willing a bit of that peace to settle in his chest.
“We need to talk,” John said, then winced. Sounded like the start of a break up conversation. Though, in a way, it was.
The whole thing with the woman on the bus I told you about was just one more symptom of how completely and utterly fucked everything was. If I’m honest, I never should have gone back to Mary after she shot you. I didn’t want to. I only did because you said I should.
Because if he gave it all away, then no one could control it.
Just don’t eat all the cake
How to even start?
(He waves a dismissive hand)
I see you spent the night at Sherlock’s flat ;) ;) ;)
I’ve been trying to think of what to write here, but I think I’m still awestruck that I’ve somehow managed to get everything I’ve ever wanted. That it’s possible to be this happy.

[SH’s face crumples, and he looks away, composing himself]
If he were really honest, he’d been too busy shoving down his own feelings to notice. Denying. Hiding.

Sherlock whirled to face Lestrade when the door to the flat opened—and stopped dead in his tracks, his face falling into distress. Lestrade stood in the doorway, an utterly hideous Christmas jumper pulled over his work clothes, a bottle of scotch with a bow in one hand and a Tesco’s bag in the other.

[As JW approaches, RW catches sight of SH and squeals happily. She reaches out for SH with both arms and nearly launches herself out of JW’s hold. Between the two of them, JW and SH keep her from falling. SH gathers her onto his hip with a hand on her bottom while JW holds onto her sides. JW and SH’s eyes meet for a long moment. A really long moment. Eventually Sherlock brings his other hand up to rub over RW’s back, and he places a kiss on her forehead. JW stares, breathing shallowly.]

?” he snapped.
I expressed some concern over the speed at which he seemed to be moving, but his response was swift and definitive. He’s been “obsessing” over his sexuality in the back of his mind for more than half his life, and now that he’s finally pulled everything into the light, he feels anxious to “get the hell on with it” and live truthfully. He pointed out, rightfully so, that much of the pain he’s caused Sherlock over the years has been a direct result of his repression, and he’s eager to do away with anything that might cause Sherlock pain in the future.
“Shut it, you.” Sherlock murmured, rubbing a thumb along John’s jaw line. “There’s a second bottle of that wine too, you know,”
A cup of tea landed on the table in front of him, startling him out of his spiraling thoughts.
I know it’s short notice, but… Mike Stamford and his wife are free to watch Rosie tonight, if you’re available
I have assigned some exercises in self-compassion and forgiveness in addition to logging his alcohol intake. While John has several other issues to work through, if he can complete this anger management course and forgive himself for not missing his wife, he will be well on the road to recovery. He appears serious and thoroughly committed to treatment for the first time in our long association. Prognosis is good.
, but every time I get angry at you, it gets mixed up with—with what he was trying… what he was trying to… stop. In me. Do you understand, Sherlock?” His eyes glanced off Sherlock’s shoulder, the arm of his chair, the top of his head, before finally, finally settling on Sherlock’s own. “Do you understand what I’m trying to tell you?”
DUE DATE: 21/02/2017

“A lot’s happened,” he said simply.
John shut off the tap and took a shuddering breath. Sherlock needed the practical side of his love at the moment, not the weight of it. He returned to the room and handed the glass over.
Sherlock forced his fingers to relax, took a breath that finally satisfied the burn in his lungs. Earlier, John had held him in his arms. Yesterday, he’d kissed him on the cheek. Earlier that week, he’d put his hand on Sherlock’s waist and held him close in front of the fire. Before that, a brief hand-hold at a crime scene. And before the wine, too. Dozens of moments, hundreds, stretching back months and years to the first day, that instant point of connection over a lab table in St. Barts that had been the beginning of something More.

John snuck a glance at Sherlock, who pursed his lips and returned the look.
“I’ll make you a cup of tea while you wait.”
And yet, the opportunity to be finally truthful about a few particular aspects of his past might break down certain walls that had always stood between them. Might allow him to probe certain topics they'd always avoided, mostly because of John's own resistance. He could test the waters, gently, in a way that had nothing to do with the two of them.
“Dig in, boys!”
You looked just like—

“No, I mean it. I’ve already called and made an appointment for myself. I’ll do the same for you, if you want. The fact that you attempted this terrifies me, and the fact that it isn’t the first time makes it… and the drugs, and the withdrawal… ”
Mrs. Holmes:
"Scotch on the rocks, coming up," John said, then made his escape with only a small twinge of guilt at leaving Sherlock to the wolves. John needed a moment to collect himself, but vowed to hurry back before the boys could scar Sherlock too deeply with stories of his past exploits.
Yours forever and more,
John startled.
“Forget it, John,” Sherlock said, obviously misinterpreting the change. “If the choice was to die with the memory of you fresh in my mind versus a vicious death six months later when I could barely—”
Sherlock shook it off. Complete the task. Go home, with or without John.
The three of you are adorable. Can’t wait to see the littlest Watson again soon! x
“I guess they finally got tired of waiting,” he said.
“I’ve something for you; you might even call it a Christmas present…” When Sherlock didn’t respond, Molly took the box over to him, and continued, “It’s a perfect central polydactyly complete with partial syndactyly. Right hand preserved, I’ve kept the left one for myself. It’s a donation so we don’t want it back,” Molly thought for a moment, “though perhaps we had better have it back once you've finished with it, we don’t want to trigger a murder investigation if it ends up in Mrs Hudson’s bins.”
“Sometime during the war…” Aziraphale mused.
“You were right; we shouldn’t have gone into the warehouse”
“You can’t give more than yourself,” Helen agrees, as they load the inebriated Harry into a taxi.
“Our phantom cat perhaps?”
“I mean, are you intending a simple Viennese waltz to a suitable piece of music or some grand choreographed affaire a la
“Elective surgery?” Sherlock enquired.
“Although you disapprove of fortune telling.”
Mary Sutherland shook her head. John looked at Sherlock who picked up the cue, “you’ve had a disappointment; do you really want to spend the evening alone with your thoughts? You have longed for the company of young people; you would enjoy an outing I believe. Why don’t you go and wash your face and get changed? We’ll wait for you here.”
Sherlock thought again what a smart move this had been, before passing the letter to John. The doctor’s face took on a grim expression which Sherlock was beginning to associate with a determination to ‘do the right thing’.
“So, Aunty opens up her morning paper, nearly chokes on her Weetabix and goes dashing off to her solicitor to change her will.”
Miss Sutherland eyed Sherlock suspiciously, “Yes, I did fly out of the house, I was so angry with Mr Windibank, he would not go to the police, he wouldn’t accompany me here and in the end he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done. It made me so mad I just stuffed some things into a bag, got a taxi to Waterloo and the first train to Wilvercombe.” She said this in a rush and Sherlock realised she was struck by her own daring.
“You are good to him, John,” Mrs Hudson said, “he is lucky to have you, but then I suppose we are lucky to have him…”
! Really Angel? Was that the best you could do?”
“Should I?” John replied, “She’s not even one yet.”
“What is it?”
“Let me take you under my wing,” Mr Fell offered, “now tell me about your dress, traditional or modern?”
Lestrade doesn’t wait for Sherlock to speak; the man’s been hounding him for days, ever since the first body was discovered.
Sherlock shrank back within the confines of his coat, “Is this about Mary?”
Sherlock didn’t need to be asked twice; he had an audience to dazzle.
“I’m sorry” John whispers, through chattering teeth “I should have known it was freezing out here”
as always with my works the chapter count is on the rise.
“Did Arthur Saltire have a bicycle?”
John has no compunction in leaving his daughter in his flatmate’s care in the newly refurbished, toddler proofed 221B while he’s at the dentist. So he is rather alarmed on leaving the surgery to find fifty missed calls from a frantic Sherlock.
Crowley, however, was already on his way out through the shop.
Sherlock took advantage and began to make his way into the cave.
The Shostakovich might not have the happiest of associations, Sherlock reflected, but it was sweet and lively and just might do something to ease the oppressive silence that always greeted him when he visited his sister, the East Wind.
The intruder is as agile as he anticipated, but Sherlock is not without skills in that area himself. The baritsu training has its uses, as does two years on the run dodging innumerable assailants. A fight ensues in which Sherlock emerges the victor in that he is in possession of the prize.
Sherlock thought they all sounded completely nauseating but could see why they appealed to a woman such as Miss Mary Sutherland.
"Well, I am not entirely certain how you could kiss me and whisper my name at the same...”
“A tragedy of his own making, he shot himself.”
Less than fifteen minutes later they’re in the service lift of an unprepossessing hotel heading for the attic rooms, the CCTV neatly sabotaged.
“A letter?”
When John got back from work on Monday evening it appeared that Sherlock had got a case from somewhere. He had his own and John’s new laptop open plus John’s old one despite the fact it was painfully slow and crashed at the slightest provocation. He was tapping away at all the screens while at the same time carrying on an animated conversation in German on his mobile. Rosie, who been collected from nursery by Sherlock an hour ago sat at the table with him engrossed in some colouring while absently munching on some dairylea on toast.
“So, what are you up to today?” John asked, as he surveyed the ruin of his clothes, glad that
John smiled, bingo “Yes”
He was subtly aware of whisperings in the staff common room, of the sudden silence that descended when he walked into the room. The papers had raked up old stories of the hat detective and his sidekick ‘confirmed bachelor John Watson’. He was grateful that his name, while not quite John Smith was the next best thing, and the fact he had gone almost completely grey in the two years since the most recent photograph published had been taken. He would not have lied if he had been asked outright but, in the end, no one was brave or stupid enough.
The reindeer were cute, a lot smaller than John had realised, their compact little bodies made them very appealing and both he and Rosie thought they were marvellous. Not so Father Christmas who Rosie took one look at and screamed the place down.
However Richard Hilton-Cubitt was adamant that he couldn’t leave the farm.
“Come on Greg, look on the bright side, let nothing you dismay.”
John was just giving his assent when they were interrupted by the boisterous sound of Bill arriving in the dining room, closely followed by Chris. They both looked rather worse for wear and Bill was singing, tunelessly, an old musical hall song “who were you with last night…”
“War, what war?” Mycroft replied sharply.
Sherlock lets George rant on; although he would never admit it, he is distracted. His mind has been on other things all day, no wonder he’s lost his edge.
John refreshed the tea and made himself another couple of pieces of toast in the sure and certain knowledge that one would be purloined by Sherlock as soon as he put it on the plate. John had discovered quite early on that Sherlock had little interest in food unless it was someone else’s, and that loading up his own plate was a good way of keeping the detective fed. He had wondered at the start of the terrible twos whether Rosie was beginning to mimic Sherlock’s fussy eating habits, particularly when it came to vegetables but fortunately he had now managed to wean her onto peas, carrots and the occasional mouthful of broccoli. It was a pity the same couldn’t be said for Sherlock.
At Baker Street - after Sherlock's discharge from St Caedwalla's Hospital.
Mycroft Holmes, who had been able to solve ‘
The transformation in Richard Hilton-Cubitt was instantaneous and in Sherlock’s opinion more than a little alarming. Gone was the serious and concerned Norfolk farmer as he grabbed Sherlock into a bear hug while shaking the detective’s hand vigorously.
John could hardly go racing outside in just his boxers and a t-shirt. He quickly pulled on his trousers from the day before, threw a jumper over his head and stuffed his feet into trainers, grabbed his cane and keys and made his way downstairs to outside door of his building. But he was hampered by his limp and by the time he reached the quad there was no sign of the runaway. He wondered if he should alert someone, but apart from the security lights the school was in darkness and anyway he didn’t want to get the boy into trouble. He would fetch him back and no one would be the wiser.
Sherlock’s on his own, John hasn’t got a sitter and the Yard can’t keep up with him. The criminal leaves a series of clues using a cypher based on hieroglyphics, the periodic table, dancing men and the highway code. Each one is a devil of a job to crack. Sherlock is in his element.
“Not at all. This merely that this confirms my suspicion that the cruel hoax originated from within her own home.”
Mycroft held out his phone and exchanged it for Greg’s and they read each other’s messages.
The room was almost but not quite restored to the way it had been before the incident with the motion-triggered grenade. It had caught the brunt of the explosion and most of the interior had been destroyed either by fire or water. His chair had been salvageable as had been, somewhat randomly, the bison’s head. But the tables, soft furnishings, the couch and what he still liked to think of as ‘John’s Chair’ had all needed to be replaced.
“No more than a couple of days, according to the path guy although we’ll need a proper examination. Just starting to stink, that’s why it was investigated.”
“There is something you haven’t told me,”he said now. “When you came to see me yesterday, I asked you why you had not sought your fiancé at his home or workplace, or with his family. You circumvented this question. I believe you had a good reason for this, and that is you do not know where he lives or work, or his family if he has one. In fact, I believe you have never even met him!”
There had also been one message from a number that John didn’t recognise but from a voice that he did; Dinah asking him to call on her at his earliest convenience to be measured for his suit. John made an arrangement for that afternoon with Dinah’s personal assistant, then sent a text to Sherlock but only received a curt reply that he was out, however Mrs Hudson was happy to collect Rosie and give her something to eat to allow John to go straight to the hotel where Dinah was staying once he had finished his afternoon surgery.
“It may not have broken the law,” Sherlock spat out the words, “but it was a crime against every common decency and parental responsibility, and you will pay for it, of that I am sure.”
He took a long drink of his pint and leaned back in his seat wondering if he looked smug, he certainly felt it. He studied his friend’s face waiting for the inevitable question and hoped John wouldn’t be too crass about it. He was aware of the prurient interest bisexuals aroused even though he had not experienced it at first hand for some years. In the end he got tired of waiting for John to spit it out.
Case or no case, on the first Thursday of each month Sherlock rose early, dressed and waited outside on the pavement for the car to take him to the London helicopter terminal in Battersea to make the surprisingly short flight to Sherringford.
John gave up and went back to the room on the pub’s second floor. It was a lovely room, clean and spacious, newly decorated… and with a ruddy great double bed in the middle of it.
“Who?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
John left Rosie spreading baby rice into the tray of the high chair, her clothes and her hair, and went to put the kettle on. He assumed that some of it would find its way into her mouth. She seemed a little happier now that the carrot stick and the teething gel were working their magic. He wondered if things might get a bit easier once she really started talking and could actually tell him what was wrong.
“That was meant as a joke.”
Sherlock pulls himself together.
“Indeed, indeed, you must rest. I will see that a hot meal is sent over to Dr Watson’s room.”
Sherlock had started to say something about the average hours of sunshine in Alicante versus Cephalonia, John heard the name Rafe and Mary’s interested sounding responses. John sunk further into a funk. He really did wish they had eloped, he was sick of purple bridesmaids, cake tasting and
Meanwhile, Sherlock retired to his chair, to inform his brother of his requirements.
The Duke sat down heavily. “I know now, Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, that Arthur will never be safe from James. It appears he and Reuben Hayes had planned a bungled escape attempt that would result in Arthur’s death. I do not have the details, but it would have been a tragic accident. I might never have forgiven James but that was of no consequence to him. He would have played a slow game, waited until after my death to reveal the facts of his parents’ marriage and claimed the title.”
Lestrade shrugged, “Just a deduction.”
“Did you? Why?”
After the first fitting, John, who had a few days off work, came back to Baker Street ostensibly to catch up with Mrs Hudson, but in truth because he was anxious to start the dancing lessons. He was certain that the extra months he now had in which to practice, they were still unlikely to be enough to prevent him making a fool of himself on the day.
“She was ok, she used to come across quite haughty at first but really she was just a fish out of water what with being Russian and that, but she kind of grew into the job. Yes, she was nice, shame they split up, she was the best of them.”
“Just one more then” Sherlock agreed, “
Eurus taunts him “Remember, you have to remember.”
John seemed satisfied with the answer, “well played, anyway.” He was quiet for a moment then said, “I’m sorry about Bill, earlier… this morning… he’s such an arse”
, he observed with a sigh.
It hadn’t been long before Yasmin had reinvented herself as Dinah Shepherd and taken over her late husband’s act, no longer the sidekick in the sparkly leotard and shimmering tights but a stunningly beautiful and sophisticated illusionist. John had seen her once at the London Palladium and like everyone else in the audience had been completely mesmerised, and not just by her tricks. Her performance so outdid anything that The Great Shalmaneser had produced that it was rumoured that it had been Yasmin, or rather Dinah, that had been the mastermind behind the act all along.
The game is on...
Sherlock turned to John, “you agree with me, don’t you?”
“Patrick Hilton. He’s young, quite possibly more than half his life in front of him, intelligent, good looking, you saw the photographs in the kitchen, talented and successful, not short of money and yet even as we speak he may be dying.”
John had gathered the impression that there was someone in Greg’s life shortly after the nightmare of Sherringford. He had always been good for a pint after the conclusion of a case, or when Sherlock had even excelled his own high standards of being impossible to live with, but Greg had been surprisingly elusive and that could not have been solely down to the massive amount of paperwork the incident had generated, and if so, surely not two years on.
“Quite so, no need to distress them further, I already ruined their Christmas”
Sherlock replied immediately “I would like to hug you…again”
John’s second decision was that he must get out of London. Once he could not imagine living anywhere else but now the city was indelibly associated with the memory of his dead friend. Baker Street and Bart's were easily avoided, and the hordes of Japanese tourists asking the way to Buckingham Palace could just about be tolerated. If he didn’t look up, he could avoid seeing the Oxo Tower and the Shad Shanderson Corporation picked out against city skyline. But it was the casual memories evoked by the city streets that pained him most. One evening after teaching practice at St Clement Dane’s the bus took a detour down Northumberland Street and as he passed Angelo’s he was once again poleaxed by grief. Similarly, a glimpse from the back of a taxi of the crack house in Upper Swandam Lane that Sherlock had expressed an unhealthy interest in left him panicky and breathless. Great swathes of the city, from Chinatown to Belgravia were now off limits. He had to get away.
The Duke turned to his wife, “Please accept that I am sincerely sorry for my part in the distress I have caused you. My hand was forced, and I made the wrong decision, but I do not believe that James will harm Arthur, he gains nothing from Arthur’s death.”
“What do you mean… the last one?”
He never set foot again in Baker Street after Sherlock’s death. He dossed at his sister’s, Mike’s, Sarah’s and even for two (possibly three – his memory of the time was at best vague) drunken nights at Lestrade’s, before he secured a bedsit in same hostel where the whole sorry saga had begun. John’s sole conversation with Mycroft Holmes in twelve months that could pass as civil, had consisted of a barked instruction to have the contents of the small bedroom at the top of the stairs at 221b packed up and delivered to his new address. He regretted losing touch with Mrs Hudson but was too immersed in his own grief to cope with hers as well.
After this, matters deteriorated for Dinah Shepherd very quickly, the gun persuaded her to drop the syringe back down, and she took the opportunity to faint. Sherlock tied her arms together with his tie and John sacrificed his to tie her feet. Simon was dispatched to see that Molly and Mrs Hudson kept out of the way and to phone Hopkins and bring her to the scene.
“Not yet. But no doubt he’ll guess something is up from the way I’ve combed my hair or tied my shoelaces.”
“I meant is Lestrade engaged to the Dinah Shepherd, the femme fatale?”

Mrs Hudson seemed as delighted to see them as she had been on Friday, fussing over Rosie who was equally delighted with the attention. They went first into 221a where Mrs Hudson had the kettle boiled and scones fresh out of the oven.
“This is not new; Sherlock… it only feels like it… When I said move down here I only meant your chemicals!”
“Is it time for me to settle down?”
John was not an intuitive dancer; true he was reasonably agile and had a certain amount of natural grace, but he was much more at home on the rugby field than the dance floor. However, he was blessed with no more than the usual number of left feet and could follow simple instructions, so Sherlock was not about to give up just yet.
“Placed the body in the cupboard certainly, although he probably wasn’t with her when she died, that’s more likely to be some cabinet minister, or banker, or pop star who was her punter for the night. She died in one of the bedrooms on this floor, of course now cleaned to perfection by the redoubtable Juanita but your goons should still be able to find some proof if they try hard enough.”
“There’s another bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing two”
John thought,
Simon agreed, and after some fussing and a little low-grade grizzling from Rosie they left. John who had had enough of the suite, said he would see them off and after clearing it with the constable on the door Sherlock went downstairs too.
He slept.
“Mr Holmes, you don’t know how relieved I am to hear you say that. You’re an angel, that’s what you are, an angel in disguise.”
Not one for superfluous conversation, Sherlock is almost out the door when John panics and protests.
And you he, thinks Mycroft.
Sherlock looked up, and John noticed that his expression was a little shame faced. “I had an inkling, although I will admit the identity of Lestrade’s intended has taken me somewhat by surprise.”
She gave the three of them her broadest smile and said, “I’m all ears”
Both the Duke and Duchess started talking at once, the Duke finally showing some emotion concerning his missing son. “I was not entirely honest with you when you asked for James earlier, he was not unwell this morning. He took a call before he left, I saw the number come up on the phone before he answered it, I believe it was from Dr Huxtable, probably to inform me that Dr Watson had been found.”
Sherlock at The Priory School
“Jack always felt guilty, that’s why he let Hathaway Farm to Cloete, but it also meant that he could keep an eye on his son. André and Paul Cloete were close, the boy appeared to be happy, and fortunately took after his mother in looks. Jack Baker decided not to rock the boat. His daughter was like her own mother in colouring. I noticed the similarity in the set of the eyes and around the chin but then I observe whereas most people only see.
“It suggested to me that at the time of the ﬁring the window as well as the door of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes would not have blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was necessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short time, however.”
“The healing properties of fungi and mould have been long observed as I am sure you know, Doctor.”
“I’m sorry, sorry” John mutters, a litany of
John thanks him for his time and walks away unseeing. Harry’s voice, the crackling line echoes in his head.
“I don’t think it was a car, if Dr Watson did what we think he did, it needed to have a tailgate or a bar at the back for him to hang on to.”
Aveling looked dubious, “Not a particularly good one, but there are emergency supplies in the cupboard by the Bursar’s office, there’s bound to be something suitable there.”
There was a faint light behind the shutters of the bookshop/florists as Crowley drove by on his way home from the curry house. Surprised, he pulled over and parked on the double yellow lines outside. Crowley had transmogrified during the journey, (he still hasn’t mastered the art of driving in heels) so he was back in his familiar form when Aziraphale opened the door and silently let him into the shop. As he followed the angel into the back room, Crowley could see that it ws not just the flowers that were drooping.
From the bed a gruff voice says, “I understand. I too am not ready for this.”
“And you disapprove of him.”
“My apologies.”
Sherlock was certain there was something going on at the Hilton-Cubitts much more sinister than a mere childish prank. He didn’t want to alarm the man unnecessarily, but privately thought Patrick’s suggestion to travel a good one.
Crowley did not allow himself to be diverted.
Toby surveys Sherlock with a disappointed expression but as he has no other it is impossible to determine if the dog is genuinely stricken. Sherlock thinks not.
“Just tell him where I am, get his name, mobile number, email, anything.”
AM/HERE/A?E/?ARVE?
John taps softly on the door of the last cubicle. The gents, like the rest of the club, is busy though no one is paying attention to him. The door opens just enough to let John in.
“Baker Street?” Mycroft sounded incredulous, “He isn’t there anymore.”
“No, a firm over in Bakewell did most of the work, but Her Grace and I drew up the spec. We wanted something that could cover the whole estate.”
Dinah Shepherd.
“I’ll get her”
“Say Nana” Mrs Hudson coaxes with a spoon of puréed carrot. “Say Nana”
Sherlock was startled, where had that line of questioning suddenly come from.
John suddenly realised that Sherlock had given up his running commentary; he looked up from the book and saw that his audience had dropped off to sleep. They looked so content and peaceful that it made his insides go a little wobbly, the two people he loved most in the world, here beside him.
“I said nothing,” Aziraphale said sharply, but then relented and placed two fingers in the shape of a gun against the side of his head and mouthed the word
“Well, there you are then, that’s your answer. You need to get this Dr Watson back on cases with your detective, show him what he is missing.”
Sherlock pondered the words on the notepaper a little longer while absentmindedly flicking through the old newspaper until his attention was gripped by the report of an unexplained death in a house in Camberwell that sounded suspiciously like another death he’d investigate three months earlier. Sherlock reached for his phone and started firing off texts to Lestrade, the words on the paper forgotten until sometime later he heard the door downstairs open and the exciting babbling of a two and a half year old as John and Rosie greeted Mrs H. Sherlock hurriedly stuffed the piece of paper back where he had taken it from and went down to meet them.

Mrs Watson is clear.
With that, she burst into loud sobbing. Tears were completely wasted on Sherlock, but he already knew that the soldier would never be able to resist a damsel in distress, and Sherlock was strangely reluctant to miss a chance of impressing him.
Re: Further Incident
“Where are your friends tonight?”
They all laughed.
“People change, Gregory. We became involved at a time when I was particularly vulnerable.”
“Only there is a children’s craft day down at the church hall, making decorations, all ages and then we’re going to decorated the big room ready for the Christmas Bazaar tomorrow, I thought Rosie might enjoy it.”
“Better still, let’s send Sherlock and Dr Watson away. We’ll find them a nice tempting case in the middle of nowhere with plenty to keep them occupied, and a fully booked hotel with only one free room… and only one bed… and a snowstorm, that should do the trick.”
John, Sherlock, Inspector Somersby and his two colleagues from the Herefordshire CID were in the residents’ lounge of the Boscombe Valley Hotel, a small, comfortable room with a roaring fire that hadn’t existed two days ago.
John was out of the half-made suit and into his own clothes in double quick time. He heard nothing of what the tailor’s assistant said about final fittings and collection, replying abruptly that the man should contact him through Dinah. John shook him off and made a dash for the connecting doors to the sitting room.
John went to investigate, the door opened onto a compact but completely functional bathroom. John was amazed and privately regretted not having had the facility when he had lived at Baker Street.
Mrs King answered first, “Well, Mr Holmes, I was quite sound asleep so it is hard to judge. But it did seem very loud.”
Perhaps not so like John after all.
“Simon,” John called urgently, “Vatican cameos!”
“I don’t do seances, I don’t contact the dead.”
“Stir the pudding and make a wish. It’s tradition.”
“Life is but a game and we are the playthings of the gods; shall I tell you what makes me say that? I hope, Gentlemen, that I can rely your discretion… Natasha and I were not a love match, our marriage was purely one of convenience, I sold her my title and my estate in exchange for money and an heir. But I knew from quite young that I was not a marrying kind of man. No, not what you think, I saw enough of that at school to know my own sex held no interest for me either. No, I was not cut out for any of it.” He gave a bitter half-laugh, “Indeed, had I known that Alex had left a legitimate heir, I doubt if I would ever have married at all.”

It is said that you don’t miss what you never had. Sherlock had benefited from a loving and stable home, with two parents who loved each other and their offspring, but his mother viewed parenthood as another academic achievement to be obtained, while Father, who did have the capacity for fun, was away a lot of the time on business. They were both baffled by their children but for different reasons. Mycroft had been capable of fun in small doses when Sherlock was very young, but the age difference (forty years by the time Mycroft was eleven) had ultimately proved insurmountable. Sherlock had never had friends, his fierce intelligence, ability to draw the correct conclusion from the minimum of detail, and lack of filter, had alienated almost everyone he had come across. Sometime in his early teens an inept psychologist had branded Sherlock a sociopath and he had carried that label like a shield ever since.
“A lover would have noticed the scars”
More murmuring.
“Woo-hoo!”
“I just know. Don’t let me down Harry, I beg of you.”
He positions himself full length on the dilapidated sofa bed that is the sole useful piece of furniture in his bedsit and lets the solution flowing through his veins take him to the place he needs to be.
“I hardly think so, Doctor,” Sherlock interrupted in his blandest voice. “You forget, I am not here to investigate the disappearance of Lord Saltire but that of your science master, Dr  Watson. Whether I have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn while I do so is, of course, for you to decide.”
“The evidence was flimsy at best, his appeal is in three weeks, Frank will get off”
For six days he has calmly and compassionately tended the wounded and ministered to the dying, focused entirely on their needs while at the same time carrying the thought inside himself
Of course, Sherlock hadn’t been able to resist exercising his deductive powers on the other parents (two affaires and an addiction to online bingo so far), but he kept these deductions to himself for Watson’s sake. It pleased him to see that developmentally Rosie seemed much in advance of her peers, but it somehow pleased him more that she already had one or two little friends amongst the other children.
Sherlock sent emails and texts, and the occasional letter, explaining the situation, while John hibernated upstairs in his old room, only appearing occasionally for more whiskey and speculate on how he could ever show his face at work again.
, waiting to be regaled with the news of Sherlock’s triumphs.
Sherlock hesitated.
Mycroft Holmes is a busy man, with little respite between being the British government, the secret service and moonlighting as the CIA, yet he always has time for his brother.
“I’m sorry mate.” Lestrade commiserated, “but if he’s not said anything after all this time, and what with the two of you living under the same roof again, then I think you’re on a hiding to nothing, sorry.”
It’s well past five by the time John arrives, exactly twelve months late, at that landmark building.
Angry with himself, John realised he had slept again. It was not surprising, his energy levels were now seriously depleted, and yesterday…
John had disappeared around two for a last minute dash to the shops leaving an ever so slightly anxious Sherlock in charge of Rosie but the afternoon had passed without incident. He’d got back around five and drawing the curtains in a satisfied voice announced “Well that’s that, what we haven’t got now we will do without” which reminded Sherlock rather worryingly of his mother.
“Am I boring you?” Greg asked, trying to keep the disappointment from his voice.
“No John?” Lestrade commented between mouthfuls.
The boy was Arthur Saltire, the only son and heir of one of the local landowning aristocracy. He joined the school a year after the rest of his form and went straight into a class with the rising nines. Dr Huxtable asked John to keep a particular eye on Arthur, hinting of parents recently separated and a messy custody battle. John wondered if the boy’s rank, his arrival at the school after the rest of his year and the headmaster’s special interest would result in the kind of bullying that so often prevailed in public schools, but his fears were unfounded. Arthur soon emerged from his shell and began to make friends, there was nothing of the incipient sociopath about him.
Aziraphale looked flummoxed, the second stage of his plan required alcohol. Lilith came to the rescue.
Although he expressed his fears for Arthur’s safety and the need to find the boy as soon as possible, John admitted that he was in no fit state to go haring over the Derbyshire countryside in search of the boy. He was exhausted and hungry, filthy dirty and his clothes torn, his hands were grazed and, in some places, still bleeding, his knees were cut to ribbons.
“What’s up there?”
This Friday was going to be different; John knew that even before the phone call that woke him up just after six in the morning. Not just that it was the last Friday before Christmas, and all the pandemonium that that entailed but also that, as had been announced just two weeks ago, it was the day before Greg’s wedding.
“What if I don’t see it?” Sherlock sneers, “It’s none of your business”
“And did you report it?”
“If you would excuse me, I have some calls to make. I will be in touch regarding arrangements.”
“I’ll think about it, Sam, but the truth is I’m not really feeling all that festive”.
“Born Edmund Patrick Hilton.”
Garvey went on, “Who was this Englishman that he should come between us? He led poor Eddie astray, making this mockery of a marriage. He should never have entered into such an ungodly union.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who was the first?”
Dinah did not appear at all perturbed by his questions. After all, she said, it was a long time ago now, and the press had been far more intrusive than Sherlock.
“I can’t comprehends why that would be a source of mirth; it is after all the fifteenth most commonly spoken language in the world.”
He tried to assimilate his situation, but the pain in his head made it hard to concentrate. He ran a hand over his face and judged from his stubble that it was at least twenty-four hours since his morning shave.
This was so inadequate a description of an association going back more than six thousand years, that Aziraphale merely nodded.
“I wish to speak firstly to your assistant, James Wilder.”
“Oops, sorry that was meant for you.” John replied just for the look of outrage on Sherlock’s face. “Now give that back, you’re upsetting my system.”
“Worked though didn’t it? Who was there at his sickbed, checking his vitals and mopping his brow? None other than the love of his life, Dr Watson.”
Sherlock gave a small smile, “maybe a little.”
“We miss you at the Base” Murray continues “Can’t wait for your return”
Sherlock continued, “Once I was sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy I was certain that there must have been a third person present, someone who stood outside the window and ﬁred through it. Any shot directed at this person might hit the frame. I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet mark!”
“Mr King, he’s the land agent, he and his wife have an apartment within the house. They’re with a support officer in the kitchen I believe.”
Crowley ordered a beef madras and plain rice, while Janine introduced the other women in the party. They were Erica and Georgie the remaining bridesmaids, and Sophie, who had a small son who was resisting the draft as a page boy. Crowley rather liked the sound of Archie and said so.
He quickly put together a decent supply of clean clothes for a week away, toiletries, laptop and chargers, and then sat down to telephone his intended.
By quarter to nine that evening, Greg was settling into his berth on the nine-fifteen Caledonian Sleeper from London Euston to Aberdeen. He was glad that Sally had also been assigned to his team, as the other two he didn’t know, a DC he hadn’t worked with before called Marcus, and Amy who was new to the Yard and whom Greg suspected had more to do with covert operations than he cared to investigate.
That was one of our best, wasn’t it?

Then he cupped John’s cock through his pants and smirked. “Right now, if I have any say in the matter.”
"Yes."
John...
And John laughed. Just a small one, more smile than sound, but it was enough. And it was so easy after that. He pulled him down, pressed their foreheads together and threaded his fingers through dark curls.
“You’re gay, then,” John said, suddenly intent. He licked his lips, pinned Sherlock with an intense stare.
Maybe I’ll go rage at your headstone for a while. That sounds therapeutic. Is it still wrong if you’re raging at a dead person you can’t possibly hurt?

John couldn’t breathe.
I am terrified, John.

“And then you got the call about Moriarty? And the mind palace case…?”
He brushed the curls off Sherlock’s forehead and traced a thumb down his cheek, along the line of his jaw. Precious. Invaluable.

Because once again, John was nowhere in sight.
John’s heart kicked back to life, flooding his body with heat and electric anticipation. He tightened his finger around Sherlock’s and forced his gaze from Sherlock’s lips to his eyes.

Sherlock flopped into his armchair, drew his knees up to his chest and pressed his forehead against them. After a long, silent moment, his muffled voice drifted from the hollow space between.
John forced himself to stand his ground, to resist the urge to retreat. "Lots of people assume we're together anyway, so it won't be much of a stretch for my army mates to believe. We go, we say hello, have a drink, I catch up with the blokes a bit, then we get out of there as soon as possible. I get to see them without getting ribbed all night for Three Continents Watson being nearly 40 and single, nor getting the third degree for showing up with a woman, who would run away screaming when the guys likely revealed way too much about my... habits over there."

“Completely, we are both free to marry. That is what kept me this afternoon, I was procuring the special licence.”
Mummy and Father, Molly and what’s his name
“Apart from posh how else did he sound?”
“I thought you had a date tonight?”
Sherlock looked at the monitor too. “Your point is?”
Sherlock disregards the corpulent apparition, shovelling earth to cover the box completely.
Aziraphale sighed, “Not now, please Crowley.”
A case takes the boys to countryside... what could go wrong?
“Angus and Lynne, she trained with John at Barts, there’s a table, second on the left for medics.”
Sherlock cradled his violin carefully as the helicopter came into land. After working his way through his solo repertoire, he had decided to try a duet and had been assiduously practicing Shostakovich’s five pieces. He had no idea if this would provoke a response from Eurus, nothing had so far, but she was more than capable of taking the lead, should she rise to the challenge.
“Then why are you all done up like that, you’re usually in your dressing gown for at least two days after a case”
“Do you think…” Danny’s voice trailed away before he carried on determinedly, “do you think Dr Watson might be around here somewhere too?”
Sherlock is mortified but John, when he is arrives at A&E, is quite calm (though that’s possibly the aftereffects of the lidocaine).
*****
John opened the attachment and quickly skimmed the newspaper report. His face took on a wistful expression.
“Wait! We don’t know a thing about each other; I don’t know where we’re meeting; I don’t even know your name”
“The police will be here soon with divers and bolt cutters, can you hold on to the rope a little longer? I’d climb down to you but I don’t think I could free you, and anyway…”
“Right, let’s try that again, from the top.”
“How long have we known each other? Would I lie to you?”
John  felt the disturbance in the air again, more bats, in his mind he followed their direction. It was a risk but what choice did he have? He could either wait where he was until he died of hypothermia or he could try to find a way out and die in the attempt.
“No ring.”
“Um… I think we may have reached the point where I would like to say your place or mine…” There was a pregnant silence and then John continued, “only I am sharing a hotel room with two hairy arsed squaddies.”
John Watson, a doctor and a soldier who could break every bone in your body, while naming them, has killed before. He has killed in war and in civilian life, in defence of his realm and in defence of his friend and if necessary would do so again, in a heartbeat. What he has never done, and apparently cannot do, is kill a man in cold blood.
“Ah!” Said Sherlock, “the Widow, how singularly appropriate.”
Sherlock nodded, that was in keeping with the impressions in the muddy grass. He photographed what he could with his phone before standing up and saying.
In 221b John took Rosie straight upstairs, while Sherlock drew the curtains and put a match to the kindling in the fireplace. Once the wood had caught, he tipped a little coal on and put the guard in place before going into his bedroom to change out of his suit and into his pyjamas and dressing gown. When he came back, he found that John had also changed before coming downstairs and was in a pair of his oldest jeans and a well-worn jumper. It seemed that comfort was the order of the night.
“Oh, I don’t know” Sherlock joined John in looking at the hotel, before swinging round and flashing his brilliant smile. “Let me have a word with the receptionist.”
Sherlock still considered the case as no more than a one and a half at best, however that did not prevent him from basking in warmth of Ralph’s praise.
They paid the taxi, or rather John did, and made their way into the New Scotland Yard building. Despite the impression Sherlock like to give, he did not have the run of the building and they had to wait for Lestrade to authorise their entrance.
if you’ve nothing else planned, ready for next week. If you’re very good, I’ll even let you pull holes in the plot.”
This story is very loosely based on a non-ACD ACD story called 'The Book of Tobit' which I found by accident on YouTube and has to have the silliest plot of any Sherlock Holmes story, even Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce cannot redeem it.
“Who?”
While Eddie had been fussing over them effusively, Sherlock had logged into a government website and then handed over to John with a flourish.
There were arrangements to be cancelled, deposits forfeited, items to be returned, Sherlock handled them all, with the same manic efficiency he had applied to the planning of them. He also phoned in sick to the surgery on John’s behalf, they were understanding, but distracted by the loss of their practice nurse.
“Were you married long?” John asked, curiosity getting the better of him.
John looked dubious. “You sound very sure. But the I guess you’ve known him longer than I have.”
His cries in the night echoed through the thin walls of the hostel and made him unpopular with the other residents, but John was indifferent to their complaints, he suspected he might never care about anything ever again. But John did recognise that the only alternative to his place at the hostel was the streets, so he took to drinking in the evenings in the vain hope it might render him unconscious through the night.
“You are always in danger, Sherlock, that’s the problem, you’re always in danger and you always will be while you count your life as worthless, and there’s nothing I or anyone can say or do to make you think differently.”
“Asked me not to marry Dinah, taken me into your confidence, all of it.”
“That’s settled,” Mary said firmly, exercising her newly discovered autonomy, and heading off in the direction of the pub.
Vows, rings and kisses are exchanged followed by an outdoor reception at the Royal College of Physicians. Sherlock is surprised to discover that his own wedding is remarkably lacking in tedium, despite the absence of murderous photographers. (Although considering Sherlock’s limited capacity for social niceties, the photographer might be the victim this time).
Sherlock waltzes through the hotel lobby and out in to the street, despite his rumpled clothes and day old stubble his general air of entitlement leaves him unchallenged.
“How?”
Sherlock investigates and John comes round.
“I could go with you.”
“I was never in any danger.” Sherlock grumbled to John, who had arrived to take him home from the Hospital in Thurrock, where Sherlock had been kept overnight ‘for observation’. Unfortunately, this declaration was ruined by a violent sneeze and a fit of coughing.
Sherlock looked blank.
Sherlock thought
He was sidetracked from pursuing this line of thought when he spotted the three soldiers from the day before, walking along the promenade and disappearing into a Pool Hall on the other side of the street. Sherlock dithered for a moment, then threw what was left of his chips (to the delight of the seagulls) into the nearest bin and set off to follow them.
Outside on the pavement, meal finished, fortune cookies predicted, John holds out his hand, “Well thanks again. Nice meeting you.”
“What’s that doing down here?”
“There’s always a big gap between theory and practice with child care”
“That’s Dinah’s department, she’s the one whose opinion matters.”
John smiles and licks his lips a little in the old, heart-breaking style and finally calls Sherlock his ‘best friend’ and Sherlock’s resolve collapses like an overcooked soufflé.
James Wilder’s body was recovered from the rain swollen brook that had turned the Lower Gill Moor into a quagmire. The inquest on his death returned an open verdict. He was interred in the Holderness family plot, under the name of James Wilder Beverley.
“Only outstanding observational skills, an excellent memory and the ability to combine the two to make an accurate deduction,” John finished for him.
“I hope to clear him, Miss Baker,” Sherlock replied. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”
Dinah smiled “Yes. It is no secret that I had had some… augmentation… in the past. I had it reversed.”
“It’s ok.” John turned and grabbed the bottle of water from the side of the bed and handed it to Sherlock who drank deep before handing it back to John.
“I thought we had an uninvited passenger. Now what are we supposed to do with you?”
, but that could easily be read as
“André Cloete was a tenant farmer on the Boscombe Hall estate, which is owned by Jack Baker, the father of the Alice Baker. Both Cloete and Baker were originally from South Africa but like many others they left after the change to black majority rule. Baker seems to always have had money and had been prudent in getting out of the country with his fortune intact. Cloete less so, but Hathaway Farm was a good one, and he had done well. Both men were widowers with one child, and while it wasn’t clear if they had known each other before, the fact they were compatriots in a new land seemed to have thrown them together.
Greg knew the moment he opened his eyes that it had snowed again. His alarm was set for six, and he hadn’t slept through it. There was no way that light would be peeping through the hotel curtains at six o’clock on a winter morning in Scotland without there being snow outside.
Once home they went their separate ways, John to finish his usual Friday chores, while Sherlock disappeared out into their small backyard to check on his current experiment. John changed his and Rosie’s beds, unloaded and loaded the washing machine (yet again) and did their Tesco order, he supposed he had better buy some ‘drinks and nibbles’ then. The whole idea of Sherlock planning a social event disturbed John more than he cared to admit, but that wasn’t the only thing.
“It must have been Reuben who hit me,” John added, “I remember now, James Wilder was in front of me when it happened.”
It brings to mind the dream he had, when he was back in intensive care after his relapse, and emboldened by the fact John hasn’t pulled away, he says so.
“Invited, Sherlock, the word is invited not vetted.”
With Mrs Hudson keeping an eye on Rosie, John went out to the woodstore in the back yard. He filled a bucket with coke and another with kindling and logs ready to take upstairs. As he did so he noticed that the hessian covering Sherlock’s fungus experiment had come loose, exposing the logs inside to the elements. It looked rather pitiful and neglected, John quickly tapped it back in place. It was so unlike Sherlock to abandon an experiment, or at least one that was still thriving, that John worried again what was going on with his friend.
Then they were alone.

smile, and shifted a step closer.
And he would do it, too. John slumped in his seat and groaned, banging his head against the back of the chair with his eyes closed.

Sherlock’s throat constricted at the sight of John’s warm, crinkled smile, so he only nodded, taking the mug and following John out into the sitting room. John picked up his own mug and went to stand by the window and, after a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock joined him. He was careful to place himself a comfortable distance away, but John ignored it and shifted closer until their arms brushed with each sip of chocolate. Outside, the fine powdery snow had shifted to fat, wet flakes, falling in a thick rain over the dusted streets.
Sherlock watched from the hallway behind the kitchen as John studied his glass of scotch, the remainder of the bottle on the table at his elbow. The glass was still quite full, about at the level John typically filled it to. Untouched? Or possibly a second glass, a third? He sat in Sherlock’s chair, rather than his own—what could be deduced from that? Possibilities unspooled in a thousand directions, but all of them led to a singular desire to say something, to rip the drink away and shake him and place himself for consumption instead.
. To imagine that he'd been touch starved all along... it made John want to draw him near, hold him close, press his mouth to every inch of underappreciated skin—
Then, after she gives me the all clear…

“Yes, Mummy,” Sherlock shot back with barely a flicker of his usual rancor.
“Together,” he said. “In every way.”

John shot him a dirty glare and couldn't resist the opportunity to get under his skin.

Then John turned around, his eyes locking onto Sherlock immediately, as if they always knew where to find him.
“I guess we have to get up and get this whole Christmas morning thing going, yeah? Mind if I borrow some PJ pants and a dressing gown?”

“When did… wait, you’ve seriously been sitting there with lube in your pocket for two hours? Before we even started playing cards?”
And when, after two hours, Sherlock’s breathing stayed steady and strong, John allowed his eyes to fall shut and let oblivion rush in to fill all the aching, hollow places inside him.
John thanked Mrs. Hudson for dinner and went straight up to his bedroom to lick his wounds, bypassing the main floor of the flat altogether. He assumed that would be the end of it.
Sherlock looked down into John’s shining eyes and thought,
“Be with me,” he whispered into the space between their lips, then ducked in for another long, lingering kiss. “Let’s be together. Here.” Another. “I love you.”
/ 12:01 PM
“You were right,” he said, the words bitter on his tongue. “This was the world’s worst rebound relationship. I never would have dated you, much less married you, if Sherlock had still been alive.”
John took one last long look at Brian, remembered him ten years younger and kinder (
"Let's find out," Sherlock said, popping the button on John’s jeans. He dragged the zipper down, slipped a hand inside, and John saw stars.
“Yes. I’ll start packing our things tomorrow. Can I…”
John’s heart ached at the vulnerability there, the tentative reach that must have cost Sherlock so much.
[He pulls SH to a halt again, by his elbow this time]
It was self-defense, truly. If Sherlock had kept talking, John would have come on the spot. As it was, the
He thought about giving it over breakfast, but then if it went poorly he'd have to endure the awkwardness all day.
"Oi, Sherlock," Lestrade said, clapping a hand on his shoulder and suddenly looking far more sober than he had a moment ago. "You're going to want to open that now, mate. Promise."
/ 12:23
John’s stomach sank. The easy, post-case contentment had been completely stripped away, replaced by an awkward distance. Five minutes ago he’d been ready to risk it. Ready to confess. Now, with Sherlock’s reaction to his history, his sexuality…
Eight years ago today I met a man who charmed me almost despite himself, a man who swept me into a whirlwind of adventure and danger and breathed life back into a broken soldier ready to let go of it all. I loved you then, but I was afraid. I loved you even as my mouth denied it. I loved you as I betrayed you. I loved you and I let you go. I loved you, and loved you, and loved you for years, and it is the greatest happiness of my life to get to share it with you openly now. Our anniversary may be June 16th, but January 29th will always be the day my life changed for good.

“—we drank on your stag night. I remember,” Sherlock murmured, turning the bottle over to study the label. John covered Sherlock’s hand with his own and licked his lips, unable to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
Warnings for this chapter: Brief mention of past abuse of a minor, homophobia
John has worked hard and progressed remarkably quickly over the past few weeks. The man who walked into my office today could not be more different from the man I saw in early January, much less from past months and years. He seems comfortable and at peace with himself and the world in a way I’ve never seen from him before. Overall, he has the air of someone who has shed a heavy burden.

“Always meant to say, John,” he murmured on a sleepy exhalation, half awake and half in a dream.

John tightened his hold around Sherlock’s waist and fought down a surge of anger. “Probably best not to remind me of that at the moment.”
He closed his eyes and sighed with his entire being.
He would give John Watson a Christmas free of ghosts.

Sheets. Pillows.
John climbed the stairs to 221b with the plain white envelope in his hand, letting the sounds and smells of home draw him up and soothe his anxiously beating heart. After two weeks of tucking everything back into proper places, of filling cold bare walls and forlorn bookshelves, they were still nowhere near done. Their home had begun to take shape, a form both familiar and subtly different: all the same books and papers, the same seemingly random assortment of curios and oddities, and yet…

Sherlock shifted closer, sucked in a deep breath through his nose and let the words spill out all at once, in a rush. “I told you a few days ago that I was happier than I ever thought I’d be,” he said. “And that’s true. It is. But there is one thing, John. One thing that could make me happier still.”

Of all the ways he'd imagined this evening going, none of his potential scenarios included Sherlock being his emotional support, carrying him home so he could have a good panic. What had truly changed, though? It wasn't anything he hadn't already known in some dark corner of his mind for years. It was simply a fact. Just another fact about him.

Sherlock's gaze darted from face to face, searching for John, for familiar blond grey hair and dangerous eyes... and to his horror, found him locked in conversation with Molly Hooper, an identical silver and blue envelope clutched in his hands.

And as soon as their lips met, John was done for. The boys whooped and clapped, like they were at a wedding watching the couple kiss, but all of that faded into the background as Sherlock's mouth softened against his, welcomed him, leaned into the kiss and into John. He wasn't just accepting the kiss for the sake of appearances—Sherlock Holmes was kissing him back, renewing the kiss, chasing his mouth when he tried to pull away. And John figured, what the hell—if this was the only time he'd ever get to kiss Sherlock Holmes, he'd knock his socks off.

"Huh." John thought back through dozens of failed relationships, but couldn't find the common thread. What had he always wanted that he hadn't gotten? What had they wanted that he hadn't given?
“Look, Sherlock and I need to head home. Just have Lestrade contact him if you need any more details, yeah?” he said, slipping past her. Sherlock had turned away and started toward the curb, and John was damned if he was going to let Sherlock strand him there to go home and sulk alone after the night they’d had together. Dinner and a case. Their perfect date.

A beat. Sherlock’s eyes darted over John’s face and body, deducing everything John had been hiding, been suppressing for years. Badly, but not entirely unsuccessfully, judging by Sherlock’s reaction. He let down his guard, let it all show, let his face be open and clear.

John buried his hands in Sherlock’s hair and pressed their foreheads together, taking in all the smells and sounds of home, of 221B and Sherlock.

Sherlock felt all the blood drain from his face. “John, no, don’t—”

"Low availability of women while in the military meant you had an excuse to indulge in something you'd been repressing your whole life, likely due to your father, but also possibly due to a botched coming out by Harry, which scarred you permanently into the closet. A significant enough subset of men indulged in casual same-sex relations overseas, so you had no problems fitting right in, so to speak. But something forced you back into your previous mindset upon your discharge, possibly something with your family; a comment from Harry in front of your father, perhaps, or you'd spoken just a bit too frequently about one of your fellow soldiers for your family to completely write it off. Possibly you tried to reconnect with one of your army paramours after returning home, only to find that he was only situationally gay and was completely unreceptive to the idea of a civilian relationship, no matter how casual. Or, perhaps it was simply the trauma of your violent discharge from the military combined with the loss of connection with your unit and a desire to draw boundaries between your old life and your new one. Or some combination thereof, of course."

“What happened, Sherlock? Where’s John?”

Distraction. Music, conversation, something, or else John really would let his hands wander and his mouth betray him, probably crash the car and their friendship all in one dramatic move. He pulled back and cast about for a topic for discussion.
But if you do want this with me…
Sherlock smiled down at his phone, then pocketed it, resisting the urge to reply. John would obsess over it, wondering if his lack of reply meant he was smoking like a chimney. Perhaps it would bring him back sooner. Perhaps he’d be thinking about Sherlock all day because of it.
"Can I do it right now, with all of Scotland Yard staring at us?"
“It’s was a near thing, I swear, matter of seconds.”
“You’re much quieter these days,” Mummy said from her nest of blankets on the couch. She had changed into flannel pyjamas and made them all hot toddies, then settled down with one of Sherlock’s monographs while Father perused John’s collection of mystery novels. Sherlock hadn’t spoken a word to them since John left. His lips twisted in reply to Mummy’s words.

Sherlock had dated before. John had been with men. Now Sherlock was melting under his fingertips with a purr John could feel through the cheek pressed against his knee, and he could already see how the night could end: confessions and shared breath and sweat and skin,

“I think that’s quite enough,” Sherlock said, his voice low and absolute.
But there’s something you said in your letter. “I’m sorry if you didn’t want to know.”
” Sherlock snapped, and John sighed both internally and externally. He pushed back from the table and stood, ending up toe-to-toe with Sherlock, the camel hovering behind.
"You know that once the pieces start to fall together I can't stop it. I didn't mean to cause you pain." His Adam's apple bobbed, and his eyes darted back and forth, as if physically looking for the right words.

"Good night, Watson," Harris said, covering Patel's mouth with one enormous hand. "Go take care of that man of yours. Let's do this again sometime."
John blew out a hard breath and let it end on a wobbly chuckle, shaking his head at himself. He handed the phone back with a squeeze of Sherlock’s fingers.
John mustered a nervous smile once the server left. “They have beehives on the roof here. The sous chef who maintains the hives said he’ll give us a private tour, if you want. He’s a fan.”

Sherlock, remarkably, stayed silent through the entire exchange, which was cause for great concern in and of itself. Sweat stood out on his forehead, and John felt the start of tremors in the arm around his shoulders. Withdrawal symptoms definitely manifesting. Time to get to a bed.
I haven’t been able to leave this section blank for John since before his best friend’s suicide in 2012. I’m pleased to finally do so again today. I will continue to monitor for suicidal ideation carefully, considering his past, but John truly seems to be out of danger for good this time.

He laid a hand on Sherlock’s leg and gave a light squeeze, relishing the soft slide of expensive fabric under his fingers. Sherlock froze for half a second, then relaxed, his legs falling ever so slightly farther apart. His face stayed perfectly blank, bored, but his breathing hitched the tiniest bit—a tell John had learned to look for, a tiny seed of hope that had grown into a tangled wanting that suffocated on the best of days and ached without relent on the worst.

“You’re different when you drink,” John said, catching himself on the arm of Sherlock’s coat as he stumbled over… nothing. Over his blood alcohol content, really. Sherlock covered John’s hand with his own under the pretense of assistance, but the slow finger he drew up the inside of John’s wrist rather gave up the game.

Home had always been more about people than things for him, but when the person was Sherlock Holmes, it was hard to separate the person from the microbes and microscopes, the morbid trinkets and ephemera that surrounded him like a whirlwind of data spilled straight from his chaotic mind. A mind as self-destructive as it was beautiful.
Besides, if they left, he'd have to let go of Sherlock. And he thought he might physically crumble to ashes if he had to let go.

Sherlock tipped his head back and groaned, until John’s fingers tangled through his and brought him back to attention.
Lestrade turned more fully toward Sherlock, a blinding smile visible even in his peripheral vision. He couldn’t turn, though, couldn’t meet the smile, couldn’t look this thing head-on yet.
“Yes. We will.” John hummed and threaded a hand into Sherlock’s dark curls. “I think you need to call your parents. They’ll want to know they’re going to have a granddaughter.”

He pretended not to notice the way Sherlock stumbled at that, or the intense flush that stained his cheeks.

Maybe at this point it’s about accepting each other’s brokenness, loving anyway, and working together to move forward. I’m working hard to be the man I want to be. The kind of man you deserve. And if you’ll give me the honor, I will work to deserve you every day for the rest of my life.

John licked his lips again and stared straight into his eyes, unflinching. Braced to accept his fate.
He sighed and rolled away, throwing an arm over his eyes. It was always easier to speak when he couldn’t see. “It terrifies me, this habit you have of sacrificing everything for me. Including your life, several times. And with a daughter in the picture, I can only imagine—”
And he saw the moment it all snapped together in Sherlock’s mind, the reason John had selected this restaurant that was so far outside their typical neighborhood or taste. The tiniest smile curled at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, and John’s heart thumped hard in his chest.
He rocked back on his heels, glanced in the direction of his former bedroom.

Sherlock drew back just far enough to nuzzle their noses together.
“I’m sure, Sherlock.” John squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder, then let his hand fall away and rolled out of bed before the conversation could go any further. Too much all at once. Too much in Sherlock’s current state of mind. Get him better. Make him well.
Sherlock cut him off by whipping a pen out of his coat pocket and signing with more careful precision than John had ever seen from the man who once tried to endorse a check by stabbing it. He stashed the pen, then blinked down at the papers for several minutes, a tiny smile slowly creeping onto his lips.
And yet, every time he tried to look at her, his eyes slid away, as though they were protecting him from the painful sight. His soon-to-be ex-wife staring with cold, sharp eyes, the swell of her belly preventing her from sitting too close to the table. His child, inside that woman, being nourished and cradled by an assassin. He shivered. One week to go, then they’d all be free of her.
Mycroft nodded, his expression somewhat softer despite his words. “I will do this, Doctor Watson, but not for you. I will do it for Sherlock. But I’m not going to just sweep in and make the whole thing go away. I will position my people. You will have to be the one to end things with her.”
John had only glimpsed the man with Arthur but from what he had seen the man had not been dressed for caving.  Might they have had equipment with them? Perhaps, but they hadn’t expected to have to deal with a witness. Could they have gone somewhere to get the equipment? Possibly but that would have risked John regaining consciousness before they had dumped him. John concluded that leaving him in the cave had been a spur of the moment decision and that despite the darkness he probably wasn’t that far from an entrance.
