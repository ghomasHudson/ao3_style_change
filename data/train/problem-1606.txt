“Yeah, what’s enough for him to make an acid, then not use it as he just went around stealing organs from these poor guys, and then go back to making acid?”
“Did you catch him?” Sherlock asked as soon as his throat had stopped throbbing and stinging.
♫	♫	♫
“Uhh… no, no calls.”
There was a list of the guidelines on the fridge, which he read aloud to Sherlock at least once a week to remind him. Sherlock always groaned loudly, liking Watson to that of his mother. But Watson couldn’t care, since he had just about killed himself with one of his ‘experiments’ and wouldn’t stand for it.
“Sherlock, Sherlock stay with me here, you’re going to be fine.” He said, having found where the wound is and helping the other doctor in trying to stop the bleeding. He was holding bandages to his friend’s chest, putting immense pressure on it. “You’re going to be fine, look at me, keep your eyes open.” He said, to which he got no response. They hooked him up to a heart monitor, which only reported uneven heartbeats. They put an oxygen mask on him, getting him on a stretcher and carrying him out.
Watson heard the song over and over in his head as he fell asleep, and Sherlock saw Watson’s facial expression, trying to figure out what about the song made him get up as he too tried to sleep.
“I… I thought the target was you.” Sherlock said, closing his eyes and then looking at John harshly. “There were small, hardly noticeable puncture wounds on the twelfth victim’s right arm, and it was a message.”
This made Watson turn towards him fully, almost dropping a cup on the ground. “You mean to say… the deterioration period was slow? But you said the stuff you made was fast acting. Or at least implied it.”
“Your best is frighteningly good.”
John was with Lestrade, calling Sherlock’s name with the mob. His was much more frequent and panicked, as he’d let him go off alone on the day the murder was to happen. He didn’t take the hints – the last few days, sight-seeing, going to the pub, eating. Sherlock was preparing to die.
“Have I?” The voice asked, stepping into view. A trench coat, collar turned up, scarf around the neck, and curly black locks atop. Sherlock was looking into a metaphorical mirror. “I’d hardly say that.” He continued, walking to the left. Sherlock watched him closely, mirroring his movements. “I’ve planned this out… you know I have.”
“It’d have to be someone with access to the rooms – a doctor or a nurse.” Holmes confirmed, tilting his head. “It’s the most probable – so I’m settling on it.”
“About the light? Last time you were ashamed was when you smashed up your face – and you thought making that acid was fine!”
He went to work on writing out a list of rules – he wasn’t careful to make sure Holmes would like them, or approve of them, or be able to follow them. He wrote things out that would keep his flat mate from getting either one of them – or both of them – arrested.
“No thanks, I’ll ask Molly.” Holmes said, bursting through the door and heading down the hallway to find Molly – she’d know. And Holmes had seen John go pale again so he was hoping if he got there fast enough he could quickly ask Molly what she thought – someone who felt things severely should know.
He heard Watson sit on the couch behind him, frowning in confusion before he began playing again. They stayed like this for about an hour before they each were tired enough to really go to sleep. They did so after their friendly departure to their respective rooms, both seemingly in a good mood.
Holmes wasn’t sure what had happened to John earlier that evening – he’d gone pale as he watched Holmes pace and denied feeling ill. Holmes wasn’t quite sure what had happened – there was nothing shocking happening so it couldn’t’ve been that. He wasn’t easily scared – the last time he’d seen him so pale was when he’d woken up in the hospital – John had blended in with the overly-clean white walls of the hospital. Holmes could hardly see him with his blurry vision when he woke.
“Right, yes, that… makes sense.” John nodded, sipping at his lukewarm tea with dissatisfaction. “Well… what, no sight-seeing today?” John teased, still having no clue as to what made him suddenly want to tour London – he’d already memorized every inch of it, no doubt.
“Right.” Holmes nodded, wondering what was wrong with his cover-up stories, but pushing that thought aside for the moment.
“He must work in a hospital – access to medical records, to patients for minor testing – but then why would he kill those two men? Why would he do that if – and the extra puncture wounds…”
Holmes’ face relax and his mouth hang open slightly as he thought about it. “Okay, well the stuff on the walls is a corrosive material that can eat away at flesh. I’ve just created it.” He said, hoping that would suffice.
John stood there in shocked silence, his body stiff until he hugged him back, accepting his apology and eventually saying it wasn’t needed – that it wasn’t completely his fault, that he was trying to be the best friend he could.
John’s heart raced – he couldn’t do this again; not for real. It was hard enough last time. It was too hard. He couldn’t lose another one – not him, not again, not now. Not now.
“Five days, huh?” John asked, going into the kitchen. “Got anything new yet? I’m assuming no murder until tomorrow.”
“But this guy’s tricky, what if-”
“What is it we’re looking for?” Lestrade asked as Sherlock bluntly asked the file keeper to leave the room. He did after being ordered to do so by Lestrade, saying to give them five minutes.
“A tedious one.” Sherlock said, wincing when Watson gently prodded the bruise.
“What are you staring at, John?” Holmes finally asked, raising an eyebrow at him. “Is there something there?” He asked, adjusting, both feet on the ground now rather than one crossed over his knee. His arms moved from being on his thighs to being on the couch on either side of him as he looked around for whatever John had been looking at.
“Do you miss my rules, Sherlock?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.
“You’ve been playing the song?” John asked, frowning at him now. “And listening to me? You wouldn’t be able to hear that from downstairs – did you come into my room?”
“A method of escape – the man had no injuries on him though, so clearly my method was not the one he used.”
But just as he was about to drift off he heard Sherlock’s violin once more. At first he only worried that his chin was resting on the instrument, which had significant bruising and minor swelling, but then he recognized the song. The same one from the night previous.
“Right.” John sighed, opening the door of the cab as they pulled up. They walked in, John plopping back into his original chair, sensing that they were out of groceries as his stomach rumbled. He was too agitated, however, to make any effort towards even thinking about take-away.
Watson would point to the paper on the fridge whenever Holmes asked a question regarding a case and going to investigate without him. Watson would make him wait until he’d finished his breakfast before leaving just to show he had to listen. He’d check his bandages every twelve hours, making sure they weren’t stained with blood from too much vigorous movement.
“Precisely. And once it got strengthened it got stronger – doubling in strength every second. He had called one of his friends, speaking of an upset stomach and how he wasn’t going to be able to make it to their meet-up the next day, and died within the hour.” Sherlock said.
“John?” He coughed as the tube down his throat choked him. John’s head snapped up as he saw his friend immediately struggling against the tube that was helping him breathe only seconds before – he pressed the button to call a nurse several shaky times and told Sherlock to calm down.
“How would you go about your last day?” Holmes asked, frowning. He looked much more puzzled than usual – his brow was furrowed, his nose was scrunched slightly, he was tonguing his cheek absent-mindedly. He seemed rather poised about something.
“Good.” Holmes nodded, his long legs starting astride once more, heading down the hallway with John on his heels asking frantic questions. How were they going to catch him, what does that information have to do with it, he just didn’t understand. How did he know the cut-open victims had puncture wounds at all? In fact, Holmes didn’t know – it was a hunch. Just as it usually was.
Sherlock didn’t respond, silently begging him to continue.
He couldn’t leave.
“Peachy.” He said, seeming genuine – his eyes were soft, his lips were gently closed in a passive manner. He seemed blissful – or high. Or both.
Back where my heart is longing to be
“To help pay the rent, most likely.” Watson replied, staring down at the newspaper now, not in the mood to argue with Holmes about all this. He brought it onto himself, and he knows that.
They got in a cab, drove all the way there with questions from John as to why, and answers from Holmes making nothing become any clearer. They pulled up, Holmes paying the cabbie as John took in the glory of what they were doing. They’d never done this – and John was starting to think it might not have as much to do with the case as Holmes wanted it to.
“Madness. Absolute madness.” He mumbled to himself as he crawled beneath the covers and turned out his lamp. He closed his eyes with a heavy sigh.
Caring was not an advantage – it was just a way for people to get to you. And for Holmes, that’s all people wanted to do; get to him. There was nothing that would please others more than to find out he was human after all.
“You’re an idiot.” Watson said, his voice betraying him as it cracked with fury. “You were on the verge of death – your heart stopped in the ambulance! They had to revive you! Sherlock, if you’d died…” Watson said, his throat tightening further – maybe it was because he was going to cry.
“John,” He rasped, coughed, and his eyes closed. Blood was running down his front, his arms, his legs – it was everywhere. Sherlock’s’ breathing decreased in speed until it was hardly a breath a minute. Other medics came in and policemen searched the area for the killer, nothing turning up. Not a single piece of evidence Not a footprint, a drop of blood; nothing.
“No, you can’t Sherlock.” Watson interrupted, feeling his body become tense with anger, sadness, and relief that Sherlock was back to his normal self – to his usual state of mind without the confused stuttering and… confusion. “You can’t take care of yourself – you proved that when you…”
“I went to stay with a friend for the night.” John responded, wondering if this was why he was being quiet. “I thought I should give you some space – seemed like you needed it.”
“I’m grabbing some sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid.” Sherlock responded, leaving John to sit there in estranged silence for a moment.
He scraped the egg from the pan, figuring scrambled was good enough, and plated it once they seemed… sturdy.
Holmes also took his coat off and rolled his sleeves up to his elbows, pacing through the lounge with his fingers steepled beneath his chin. John came back and stared at his exposed arms for a moment, expression dropping from his face for a moment before he tore his eyes away and sat down in his chair.
Sherlock was in the living area, his feet outstretched in front of him in a disgruntled manner. They’d gone out drinking, Sherlock having felt quite sick the next morning and taken aspirin – something John hadn’t seen before – and then spent the day past wandering London. They looked at weird sculptures that they’d seen but not looked closely at, sat in a park for a while and talked about the case among other things, and even gone to get groceries together – which meant they both got what they wanted. Far more productive than Sherlock thought it would be.
“I’ll clean it up.”
“I doubt Mycroft would be able to prevent any of the deaths in time. I’ll leave it to him if I run out of time – I still have eight days.”
Holmes sat on the couch into the wee hours of the morning, only realizing it was such a time when he realized John hadn’t returned, and then realized that it was much too late for a hope of him coming back before the Sun was to come back up. He sighed heavily, retreating to his bedroom for the night, only to lay on his back staring at the ceiling, wondering what on Earth had happened to cause such a reaction.
“Like if I saw my mother back from the dead,” Watson said as an example, making Sherlock pause.
“Not right now, not with so little time.”
“I see… and then he got stomach pains – you were slightly suspicious of this?” Sherlock asked, digging further as his mind raced – Watson could see it in the way his fingers were tapping slightly under his chin, his eyes steady on his subject. How his ears were most likely burning with the sounds he was picking up, and his nose was itching with the cologne the man was wearing.
Holmes stared at him, his curly locks recently cleaned and sleeping on his forehead. He held eye contact much longer than he usually would, then let his eyes drift about as usual, across John, then around the room. “Right, well, I just thought you might need space from all this – considering you left for a day.”
“We haven’t – Sherlock, for all we know this murder could be after you. You’re really putting your neck out on this one, popping around and checking everything, and it makes no sense – what if they are after you?”
“How do you know I want something?” Holmes asked, raising an eyebrow at her as he paused.
“Lestrade.” Molly added, nodding. Holmes then nodded, ahh-ing as he remembered that was, in fact, his first name.
-BazookaMelon
John laughed as he started doing impressions of Mrs. Hudson from when he’d first met her, and “Guido” with his unsolvable cases. John laughed, finding it funnier than it actually was.
“Two, two, two left, eleven done, all out of sequence and in perfect order – contradictory, a doctor that murders, contradictory; contradiction. Main target – anyone, it’s a serial killer, there’s no pattern to be seen except that they all come from the hospital…” Holmes mumbled to himself as he walked around the flat, getting quieter as he was closer in proximity to John until he was silent around him, and then his volume rose again once he was getting further.
“I’ll look for acid.” John said, glancing at Holmes. “I’m better at cover-up stories than you. And you’re better at questions.”
♫	♫	♫
“Name’s Jim – you seem to have a thing for Jim’s… like a Jim magnet…”
“Didn’t ask – thought you might want to check it out first.” John said, wondering why Holmes was asking him so many questions – like he would know half as much as Holmes even if he was told all the details the murderer knew.
He decided to turn on the telly and watch the news for a bit, bringing out his laptop to start on a new post. He started typing away about Sherlock’s pacing, leaving out his extreme excitement, but keeping his interest. He wouldn’t post it until it’d been solved though, so he just left it there, closing the laptop and focusing back on the telly.
Sherlock played a faster song this time than he usually did – a happier song. Usually he played melancholy songs – songs of the broken soul. But now he played a song you’d hear at a party, or a wedding.
“Not sure, haven’t heard from him. Only Greg has heard from him.” Molly replied, having to half-jog to keep up with Holmes’s brisk pace.
Sherlock’s eyes opened. He stared at the ceiling, squinting at first because the sun had just risen and it was making the room blindingly white. The place smelled of cleaning chemicals and latex. The hospital. Sherlock heard the beeping of the heart monitor and saw the drip bags. He looked to his left, looking out the window as he heard distant sirens outside. He heard chatter outside the room, and gentle breathing.
“No. Of course not. Too much to think about.” He said, looking at Watson as if he was the stupidest person on Earth for a mere moment before softening his gaze once more to fixate on the wall.
“An experiment.” Holmes said, his mind busy. He fiddled with the wheels and dials on the microscope. Watson rolled his eyes, swiping the Petri dish, that Holmes had so perfectly placed, away. His head whipped back to look at Watson, standing up to be quite a bit taller than him. “Give it back.” He said, putting his hand out.
“No wonder you’ve been acting so strange…” John said, shaking his head. “Thanks, again.” He said as he opened it up and smelled the food, sighing in amazement at how good plain chow-mein noodles suddenly smelled.
This case had proved to be difficult. One murder at a time, technically committed at very different times, coming into order – with the number of puncture wounds being used for reference – as 11, 7, 8, 4, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 12. It really made no sense, and their biggest lead was that they all had been to the hospital within the last two months.
“Fine, thank you.” He said, trying to walk around her, only to be cut off again.
“What have you done now?” Watson asked, looking to where Holmes’s hands had been moments before to see a dark spot on the counter and various pieces of… stuff… clinging to the walls and countertops. “Sherlock!” He exclaimed, going over to the scene to take a closer look. He went to touch it, but Holmes smacked his hand away.
“Quite right.” Holmes said, interpreting what she’d said slightly wrong – that people were sensitive at the wrong times, not that they were sensitive, and sometimes things affected them more than at others.
John started wondering if he’d developed another drug problem, but quickly decided it wasn’t that – there was no solid evidence, nor consistency of behaviour that correlated with any one drug. He was happy, sure, but still stressed about the case to a point. He was kinder, more easy going, but didn’t snap at any point or change his behaviour for anything – not yet, anyway.
“Sherlock, where are you? I’ve just been to the man’s friend’s house and he’s not here – where is he? Where are you? Why’d you leave without me?” Watson asked, his concern coming out as anger.
“Got it,” John nodded, and then looked back up at Lestrade – he would look anywhere but at Holmes. “How many other puncture wounds?”
“Yes, with people.” He said, then frowned, realizing she dealt with dead people in her work. “Alive people.” He added, nodding to himself.
” in return. He crawled into bed that night, not hearing the violin once.
Then the old lullaby started. Just like before – the one that lulled John to sleep, then agitated him. The same one – Sherlock was playing it again, and John could hear his mom sing it in his head.
“Sherlock.” Watson said, his voice unsteady from the relief that his friend had woken up after four days of deadly sleep.
Now he was pacing and babbling on and on relentlessly – there was too much going on in his mind. There was this intricate series of murders that was taking much too long for him so solve and John’s flip-flopping behavior that was driving him mad. He had to get to the bottom of at least one within daylight hours or he’d be driven to pure madness. No more of this half-way crap.
“Sherlock?” Watson had called, and hearing no response he checked Sherlock’s room. No one – not in the kitchen or lounge either. His coat was still on the rack so he wasn’t out. His violin was sitting next to the couch he’d have his hissy fits on, and his tea was left alone to get cold.
“Because you were being a cock.” John said, crossing his arms over his chest defensively. “I needed space. And you’re making me want it again.”
They got back to their flat in a hurry, Holmes starting to bustle about. Mrs. Hudson had turned up the heat in their flat – John took off his coat and sat down in his chair, looking outside to see fall weather and feeling as if it was summer in this heat. He went to the thermostat to turn it down, coming back to dispose of their cooled tea.
Maybe that was exactly why; he didn’t have a good case so he wanted to solve this small mystery – one he didn’t understand in the slightest.
-SH		  	     ❞
“Sherlock Holmes.” The voice rung around the dead space, echoing around the pillars and gunk. Graffiti littered the walls greedily, and the ground itself was a health hazard. But Sherlock knew this was where he was meant to be, and so did he.
A doctor and a man with an extremely intelligent imagination.
Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off of John for one second.
“I was just wondering.” John shrugged, sitting in his chair with a new cup of tea – he’d cleaned up his old one while this one steeped. “S’pose I haven’t asked in a while – wanted to make sure they were doing alright.”

“Have you spoken to him today?” She asked, tilting her head downward slightly as she asked.

“Well, John, I need to test alcohol levels.” Holmes said later that night, getting up from the couch suddenly. “Care to join me?”
“Uh, I dunno, plenty – I could check for exact numbers if you want-”
“I thought you may not have liked the fact that before you got back I interrogated him rather thoroughly – his eyes weren’t wet from tears of sadness. I’d had him stare into a flashlight so I could read his mind-processing speed and such, see how fast his reflexes were. He wasn’t too sharp.”
Holmes hummed, seemingly understanding. “Right. I’ve been the same way – not many days left, so many people to be murdered and there’s no way to tell who, or how to stop it. Can really put a damper on the mental state, can’t it?” Holmes said, making John freeze, his eyes trained on Holmes.
He stopped in for fish and chips, had at least four cups of coffee before leaving, left a tip on the table and knocked upon his friend’s door with an awkward smile upon his face. “Four nights?”
“Shh, Sherlock, look at me.” He said, continuing to say his name until they locked eyes. “You’re fine. It was just to help you breathe.” He said, instinctively putting his hand on his friend’s face. “You’re alive.” He choked, his eyes stinging and his throat tightening. “Oh my god, I thought…” He whispered, sinking back into his chair in shock as nurses came in to help Sherlock and adjust the amount of support he was on.
“They were all shipped there, but they hardly found anything wrong with them other than too much acid in their bowels – they gave them antioxidants and still they died within a week.”
“To show us what he can do.” Holmes said, clapping loudly. “He’s been showing off – he’s been showing off!”
“John.” Sherlock answered, clearly walking quite briskly as he heard air whipping past the microphone.
“Oh, okay… what can I help you with?” She asked, putting down some tools she’d been sterilizing.
John had listened to Holmes’s babbling all morning, his mind half dozed as he had gotten a rough sleep the night previous.
“A veteran, then.”
“Morning.” John said, getting into the kitchen past his wired friend, putting the kettle on. He was getting used to needing the caffeine injection before listening to Holmes’s rants.
“Anything new?” John asked, not bothering to glance at Sherlock.
“Look, I appreciate your concern, but I’m fine, honestly this case is stressing me out because if we don’t find a motive soon I’m left to believe the guy’s after you – like a repeat of Moriarty, but less… out-there, I guess. And as much as you’re pissing me off right now, I don’t want you dead.” John ranted, his tea forgotten behind him, not to be remembered for many hours.
“But you were right. About the case.” Sherlock said, rubbing his eyes. “He was after me, he wasn’t a doctor…”
Molly sat on the couch, refusing to take John’s chair even when told to. “I don’t want to be filling in for him again. Last time… Nevermind.” She smiled nervously, her eyes locked on the floor. Holmes sighed heavily, sitting with his knees over the armrest of his chair to face her more properly.
“Honestly, John, what do you think I’ve done? Murdered someone? I’m still here; I haven’t committed suicide! Besides, I’ve already told you what I dreaded to.”
“Well, maybe if you’d told me I would’ve known.” Watson grumbled, following him out to a cab to go back to their flat. Sherlock grabbed the jar and popped back out to take it to Lestrade, leaving Watson in the flat alone.
... but you didn’t. So here we are.” He said, sliding the bow absent-mindedly across the strings, his left eye slightly swollen from the bruise on his face.
Today they were waking up later than usual, having no reason to really hurry. Sherlock had incentive to that most people would take and run with, getting up at five and hurrying about to get as many things done as possible, but instead of invigorating him it shut him down. He sat on the couch, helpless, staring at the wall. John didn’t have much to say either, because he thought they were just waiting for another murder – hence all the random activities Sherlock was running around doing. Boredom, he figured. Although, then again, this wasn’t usually how he dealt with boredom. Unfortunately, John didn’t dig into it much.
No unauthorized experiments,
John didn’t understand Holmes’s philosophy of human attachment being a defect. He understood that he believed it with his whole being, along with Mycroft, but he didn’t understand why he was so attached to that rule – and why at this mess of not being able to take care of himself came with it.
John was out getting groceries the following afternoon, the thought of 221B making his stomach turn. He didn’t want to go back to be bombarded with questions and not having time to give answers – it was a Q and A without the A, and it made his head spin to think about it. He thought of the case as he wandered aimlessly down the aisle, his eyes wandering without seeing.
“Why didn’t he text me?” Holmes asked, frowning.
Shine on the one I love
He tried calling Sherlock, but got no answer. He figured he must be too busy to pick up – onto something… maybe the murder had happened – he was already there, at the scene.
Molly sighed heavily, nodding to herself as she started sterilizing tools again, trying to dismiss her suspicions.
“Right.” Holmes said, seemingly wanting to sigh, but he did not. He took the file back once it was passed toward him – not before, like he usually would – and read it over, nodding and thanking Molly, saying he was going to go call Lestrade to ask him questions about the scene. He left the room, leaving John and Molly together in shocked silence.
Watson didn’t think about this much though, since there was a bag of blood being filtered into his friend and that, along with the morphine, could’ve very well been doing that. He wasn’t on a breathing machine, but that was upon Mycroft’s request – he said he’d be fine in time.
“Not at all. He’s too nice, and it irks me.” John said, crossing his arms. “He said he had talked to Greg and you yesterday, and that’s when he started getting all… fluffy.” He said, gesturing to where Holmes had just left the room. “He did, didn’t he?”
“Because he’s trying too hard – same reason why he went to three different people for the organs instead of taking them all from one. They’re large organs we’d notice went missing, so why get them from three different people?”
“Thank you, John.”
“It does make sense if you think about it – he’s just been misleading us this entire time.”
“That’s what your counting on? A cliché?” John asked, coughing up his confidence and throwing it in the trash.
He was going to see Molly.
❝ Will be out for a while,
After he’d eaten Holmes smiled at him, nodding. “Well, now that you’ve eaten I’d like your opinion on something.” He said, standing up straighter.
“I-I’m running an-an-an experiment, d-don’t mind me.” He heard – he then tried the door handle. It was locked, of course. He rammed his shoulder into it.
“Why, what’s going on?” Watson asked, knocking again – he wasn’t sure why, but he was getting quite panicked.
“No, freeze. He froze on the spot, but why?” He asked, pacing once more after a brief pause. “What was so frightening to him that he froze? Had no reaction at all? Or was it just traumatic enough that he couldn’t react one way or the other – something from his past?”
“Right, so you want me to pop in to look at a dead body, of whom seemingly died of natural causes – but you have a suspicion it was a murder?” Sherlock mused, his facial expression void of any kind of hint as to what he was thinking.
He heard a loud, irritated groan from Watson’s room, a smirk playing on his lips. He swayed back and forth with the music slightly, hearing Watson toss and turn.
“Alright, if you end up doing anything else tell me so I don’t have to come looking for you.” John called out, making Holmes sigh.
Sherlock walked out the door, leaving Watson in shock at this reaction for about thirty seconds. He was about to get up to grab a bite when Sherlock’s head popped back through the doorway, inviting him to come along. Watson quickly accepted.
“Greg?” He asked, giving her a funny look.
Holmes sat on the couch, wondering why that hadn’t occurred to him. Why was he so slow? If he suspected a doctor, why wouldn’t he have gone to where doctors work? Where all these victims had come from? Why hadn’t he done that when he first suspected it on the first victim – wisdom teeth removal, the man afraid to die, and yet there he was, keeling over. He suspected it right away, and everything since has done nothing but confirm it, and he hadn’t checked into it. Had he mentioned it to Lestrade? He couldn’t remember.
John stared at him until the unsettling image was locked into his mind. His eyes wide and green, staring out the window and holding the world within them, oceans and lakes settling and swirling and yet stationary. His nose, twitching every once in a while as he tried to keep his mouth closed, and his mouth itself, the floodgates with more and more build-up behind them as he wanted to ramble on and on forever. His shoulders were square, but unevenly so. His hands were locked in his lap, his thumbs twitching to twiddle, but not succumbing. John’s eyes remembered every piece of him – how his shoe-clad feet were perfectly still, and yet there seemed to be invisible movement around them, and how his sitting position; his shoulders were uneven because his hips were rotated. John stared at his hips for a long time, wondering if he always sat like that and he’d never noticed, or if he was just in an odd position for the time being. He decided the latter, for he’d never noticed that before.
“How many were on the others?”
It was blank. It was as if Holmes wasn’t there – as if his words weren’t really reaching him. He poked him, earning himself a glare so full of irritation it made him stand up straight. “I’m going out.” John said, leaving the tea half-made as he went toward the door, grabbing his jacket and leaving without another word, having Holmes’s confused words follow him out.
“Quite. You never run errands.” John said in return; “What are you getting? We’re quite low on… everything. We could use some milk. Or crackers.”
“It just clicked – I had all the pieces; what else has he left behind?” Holmes wondered, thinking harder. He bustled about, his lips moving with no sound as he paced like he had before – he was back to normal, it seemed.
He woke up the next morning rather refreshed, only to be startled fully awake when he saw Sherlock, the swelling on his face having gone down slightly, but the bruising having doubled in darkness.
“But isn’t it the best time? With so little time – we want to catch him, right?”
“Why would you create something like that?” Watson cried, sure Mrs. Hudson would appear any moment to tell them to quiet down.
Under the shade of the old oak tree
“Oh, right – you stupid,
“Yes, I told you that myself.” Holmes said, glancing over his shoulder to look at John. “Nothing to hide, right? It’s in the rules, right there.”
“Yes, quite. You’d want to run because you know she’s dead – being logical. Or fight, because you know it can’t be her and someone’s just pissing you off.”
He was walking around it with a pocket-magnifier and looking at various parts of the body as it was found. John stared at it in horror, seeing the puncture wounds – much more obvious now. They weren’t made by a syringe this time. The puncture wounds were made with some kind of harpoon, having gone through the body and punctured a wooden surface – small wooden flakes were left on the body. Two puncture wounds – one through the heard, and one through the bowels. Hard to say which came first, but Holmes thought the heart so that’s what they assumed for the time being – though it was trivial, really.
“I’ve had a realization this morning, John,” Sherlock started, now anxiously standing next to Watson, back to the counter, leaning into it slightly. “The man who was injected was, in fact, a test subject – but not a willing one. I considered his recent medical history.” He followed Watson over towards where they kept tea bags and cups, his mind racing almost as fast as his eyes.
“You’ve waited much too long to help the swelling much, but we can help the pain. I’ll get you some ice.”
Holmes left the room, leaving John to stare after him, wondering if he was just having some kind of breakdown over not being able to solve this one. He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Life in this flat was becoming unbearable.
“It’s not about that,” John sighed, rubbing his forehead, putting shade over his eyes. He took a deep breath, composing himself. “You’re acting as a normal flat mate would, I get that. But I enjoy sharing a flat with Sherlock Holmes, not some random bloke off the street.”
“Are you ill as well?” He asked, his voice coming around concerned.
“It’s a timer – it’s counting down, when it runs out we’ll get no more information and the game will be over – I lose. No rematch, no restart, no reset. Done.”
Tomorrow came briskly. “Six days!” Holmes chirped, his voice sounding much more pleasant than usual. John noticed the difference between his usual voice, being grim and low, sometimes even growly, and now – now his voice was flying slightly higher than usual and had fluctuations like never before.
“But I was wrong about you.” John said, his voice suddenly empty. It was hardly John’s voice anymore – the only thing that made it his was the fact that it came from his body. “I didn’t see you were doing all those things because you knew it was you, I didn’t clue in that you were eating because you saw the end… And yet you still walked into it – actually, Sherlock why did you go there without me?”
“Go back?” Holmes asked, pausing.
“Controllably so, John.” Sherlock responded – he was speaking slowly now. Watson was angered by this for some reason.
“He’s counting down – six more to go. Any calls, Lestrade?” Holmes asked, and Lestrade checked his phone.
“Thank you, Molly.” He said, making her look down bashfully. “I really do appreciate everything you do for me.”
?” He asked, clearly getting more worked up than usual over this. “Who would’ve done it? I’ve got no dirt on anyone, nothing anyone would take as a motive… And nothing that would get that response from the victim.”
He looked to his right, seeing John. He’d let himself go, and it showed. His cheekbones were more prominent, his eyes were sunken, and his whole body sung of pain. But to Sherlock’s surprise, as he would find out soon, the song wasn’t about physical pain.
“Right…” John nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “Right, okay. I’d probably go get drunk, if I knew it was coming.” John shrugged. “Uhh… I’d do as much as I could – visit some place near-by I’d never been to before, maybe get a date.” John sighed. “I dunno. Hard to say, when you only have one day.”
“A doctor? After me?” Holmes cackled, walking back towards he window, his slice of bread placed half-eaten on the counter, probably not to be touched again. “Don’t be ridiculous – there has to be a motive.”
He was thoughtful. He was wondering why it hurt. It shouldn’t after all this time – it’d healed over, why would it hurt still? Like poking a bruise, as John thumbed over it, trying to find out why it hurt as well, then telling him to try icing it for ten minutes. Holmes sat on the couch with frozen peas on his left arm, to be transferred to his right after ten minutes.
“I didn’t do anything else – I thought the light would’ve bothered you.”
John hauled Sherlock off to bed, considering it was dark out anyway, throwing the blanket on top of him lazily as Sherlock curled up and huffed about something being inconsiderate and unfair. John stared at the curls poking out from the cave Sherlock’d made in a matter of seconds. He wondered then if they were soft – he’d never felt them before. Only looked.
“That was rather poetic.” Holmes said, making John laugh lightly. “So, you’d waste your time.”
John came out of the washroom and slumped into his chair, his shirt clinging to his damp skin and his shoulders being dripped upon by his hair. Holmes frowned and stood, pacing as he had been the night previous.
“If such a man wanted to do that then why wouldn’t he cover his tracks?” Watson recapped, realizing Sherlock wouldn’t stop until he got some resolve.
Over the oceans and over the seas
“I… I did.” John said, frowning as he followed his flat mate – this was not was he was expecting in the slightest. “What happened? You look like you’ve been asleep for a week.”
John awoke the next morning with a happy feeling – he wasn’t sure why, but he did. Sherlock knew why, though. He’d been up most of the night playing that song again – he found that the slower and softer he played it the happier John was in his sleep. He even opened John’s door slightly to play it more clearly to him – and to see what his sleeping reaction was. John just smiled in his sleep; the creases making his face look lighter somehow.
Holmes played violin again, but this time he found it agitated John. Instead of calming his stressed repositionings it doubled them – tripled even. This puzzled Holmes greatly as he had no idea what had happened to cause this. And it was consistently only when he was playing that he became more agitated. When he stopped, he let out a long sigh and calmed down to his usual restlessness. It bothered Holmes that he could no longer calm John into a blissful sleep. He quite enjoyed watching the creases fade from John’s forehead and the smile form on his lips.
“What do you mean?” Watson asked, raising an eyebrow as he sipped his own cup. “I just remember that song from when I was young, brought me back I suppose.”
“I thought you threw that out?” Watson called after him as he strode down the hallway at a fast pace.
“No, I wouldn’t think of it.” Holmes said, waving him off. “I stood outside your room in the hallway.”
Sherlock, however, was in a foul mood. He had read over the rules on the fridge – every time he did so he got disgruntled. He did try to follow them a little bit for John’s ease of mind, but he hated them. John sat in his chair, his hair still stringy and damp from having freshened up, and opened the newspaper that was nicely placed on the table beside him.
“How much do you think about him?” She asked, frowning, not understanding how it could possibly interfere with his case – he was always so concentrated on them.
Sherlock was out for a lot longer than Watson expected; he was clearly doing other things besides just dropping off a jar of stuff to Lestrade. He stood and grabbed his phone, seeing he’d gotten a text from Sherlock.

“The winner.” He called back, his voice sounding hoarse. He coughed, then laughed, and Sherlock looked around for the source of the horrendous sounds.
“I’ll bring in a sample.” Sherlock said, walking out. Watson then clued in that that’s what he was making in the kitchen – Sherlock had known what happened already, and was figuring out what was injected into him…
No, he could not think of this now. He put his fingers to his temples and rubbed small circles, going back to the murderer. Motive – what was it? You don’t go around killing people for nothing, taking out organs for nothing. That acid was intricate – you don’t make it for nothing. This was thought out thoroughly, and Holmes had yet to find where it began. If he could just figure out an order – other than the reversed counting – he could possibly move forward.
ing, praising Watson’s intelligence. He smiled at this, the left side of his mouth turning upwards more than the right.
Watson had waited at Sherlock’s side in the hospital, unable to sleep at the sight of his friend being so damaged – by his own hands as well. In the army he’d had friends die in front of him – but not like this.
Okay! It's Done! The whole thing is done now, and who'd have guessed... I never expected the song to be so prominent but having read through it again I realized it is quite a prominent factor in the story. Hence why the names of the chapters are based upon the lyrics of the lullaby (that I grew up with). I hope everyone liked it, and I'm planning to write shorts soon as what comes after since I did... cut it short... at the end there... and I want more, just as much as anyone who makes it this far probably will. So there will be shorts coming soon and it will be announced somehow - keep your eyes out for that if you're interested. Thanks again for reading - it really means a lot. <3
“Well I can do that too-”
John was left alone in the house. He decided that if Holmes was going off by himself there was nothing for him to hide, but John wanted to look anyway. He cleaned up a bit too, in the process. Put all the tea in one cupboard rather than two cupboards and a drawer, cleaned out the fridge of old cheese, spoiled eggs, and old sandwich meat. And a couple jars of unsightly substance he figured Holmes wouldn’t miss… he kept one of each for safety though.
“Right, yeah that makes sense, uh… he was a book keeper at the university – but apparently he had impersonated a policeman a couple times to get into police files, as well as a doctor for doctor files… and various other crimes. Murder being the worst, and, well, theft being the least.” He said, shrugging.
“What did you… explode?” Watson asked, gesturing with his head toward the mess he’d made. Holmes rolled his eyes and groaned loudly, standing back up to pace.
“Oh, sorry I’m being too nice.”
“Sherlock, you almost killed yourself!” Watson yelled, but when he got looks from the people around him he quickly turned and started speed walking towards the flat angrily. “There was blood everywhere.” He whispered into the phone, his feet swiping briskly across the pavement.
“What?” Holmes asked as if John wasn’t angry.
“Sherlock!” Watson cried, staring wide-eyed at his flat mate as he merely rolled his eyes. “What have you done to yourself now? What happened?”
They sat in silence for a time. Holmes was getting agitated, his mind walking itself in circles as he tried to think about a case, but John’s behaviour was putting him off as it was so different from before. He sat up suddenly, his hands on his knees as he looked at Watson.
“Maybe, but that can’t be the only reason – everyone has a reason to kill someone, it’s not leisure – it gives you no satisfaction unless you have something against the person.”
“Precisely… I’m thinking that the older victims are the ones dying now – but then why would he have an underdeveloped acid at the beginning? One so fast acting?”
“Right, all patients of the hospital within the last two months.”
Holmes mumbled angrily to himself, pacing back and forth with the new Petri dish in his hand. “I’m not sure how to explain it to you.” Holmes said, sitting down where the microscope was, waiting for Watson to place it before him, but it didn’t happen. He looked incredulously at Watson for this lack of acceptance over his answer. “What am I supposed to say?” He asked, his voice matching that of a whiny child.
He put books back on shelves, dishes in the sink; he left Sherlock’s papers and equipment alone, but cleaned and dusted around them.
Watson hailed a cab once more, getting a ride back. He mumbled to himself what a waste of money it was on the way, his body tense.
“Alcohol levels?” John asked, his eyebrows lowered.
“Hardly worth it – the murder will be today. The giveaway. The face reveal. Friday the thirteenth, the thirteenth murder…” He said, rubbing his hands together beneath his chin. “Hardly worth straying from.”
“Have you gone to the friend to ask what the guy said to him?” Watson asked, finally pouring the hot water over the teabags in the cups.
“Alright, well could you also grab some-”
“I boiled water for your tea.” Sherlock said, making Watson raise his eyebrows. He went to the kitchen and poured it over a teabag, figuring it not worth it to question his timing, letting it steep as Sherlock continued.
“Sherlock, there’s been another one. This one is known to be a murder-”
He felt for John, though. He felt happy around John – even when John was getting after him for breaking the fridge rules. He felt sad for John when he was tossing and turning and he couldn’t do anything to help – well, he could, but he wouldn’t because he didn’t want John to know he cared. It was a weakness – nothing more.
“So… don’t do anything…”
“Fine, fine.” He sighed, crossing his arms and huffing like a child. “Then answer me this – why has John left again?”
“He’s been out for too long.” John said into the phone, putting his jacket on as he headed towards the door.
“Sure.” He said, frowning in confusion as they walked in.
“What? How do you know?”
“Right… let me know if you get ahold of him.” Molly nodded, her arms crossed in front of her as Holmes got into a cab and waved goodbye.
“E-e-experiment, I’m f-f-f-f-fine-ine…”
“I’ll be there in a bit.” He said, hanging up, then jumping into the air and thrusting his fist above his head. He cheered and hooted for a moment, his pacing increasing in speed, his mouth unable to keep up with his mind as he voiced his thoughts aloud. “Oh, a good case! A good murder - and of natural causes; it must be murder if Lestrade thinks so, right?” Sherlock said as he pulled his jacket over his arms.
They got back to their flat in a hurry, Holmes slumping onto the couch – he was just starting to feel a twinge of exhaustion.
He left the room, closing the door behind him and going to bed himself. He crawled under the covers, feeling his mind running in circles as he tried to deny everything he was telling himself. But you can’t call yourself a liar – that’s contradictory. So instead he laid there, telling himself it was just the alcohol – it wasn’t anything.

“What does counting down do for you?” John asked, standing beside his chair in anticipation of Holmes’s answer.
“Of course, of course!” Sherlock repeated, a smile on his face once more. Watson didn’t protest, knowing continuing to do so would do absolutely nothing.
“Look… I want to know why you can’t focus, too, and I want to help you focus because damn it Sherlock, people are dying.” John said, gesturing toward the window, assumedly to resemble the world outside theirs.
“For kicks!” Holmes yelled back sarcastically, gesturing at the table as he lost his patience for John’s questioning, indicating he should put down the microscope.
“With having been a soldier.”
“I wouldn’t call it worrying, but that’s what people have been saying.”
“Right… okay, so that’s not an option…” John nodded, tilting his head. “What about Mycroft, have you asked him? If he has any ideas, I mean.” John crossed his ankle over his knee, placing his arms comfortably on the armrests of his chair.
“I can’t believe you, Sherlock.” He said, staring incredulously at the floor. “You honestly can’t have forgotten that already. This is madness.”
“Don’t what?” Holmes asked, raising an eyebrow.
Sherlock hung up, making Watson shake his head disapprovingly, yet there was a small smile on his lips. He expected no more and no less from Sherlock Holmes, his flat mate for which he made rules to read over once a week.
“If the killer wanted so badly not to be caught you’d think he’d have perfected the serum so it wouldn’t show on the outside – I only caught it because of irritation of the skin before cell death…” He rambled aloud now that Watson was there to hear it.
John picked up his phone immediatly, dialing Sherlock.
“Sherlock.” John said, listening to the babbling but not comprehending what it meant. When it continued for longer than ten seconds and Holmes hadn’t stopped to listen John lost his temper. “Sherlock!” He yelled, his fists balled at his sides.
“John,” Holmes started, putting his hands in his pockets, which he never did, as when he was thinking he liked to wave them around and emphasize his words. “I have a dilemma.” He said, his eyes snagging on John’s knee, then darting anywhere but at his figure sitting in the chair.
“John.” Sherlock answered, his voice low and rattily as usual. Watson huffed, frowning as he paced, looking up at the windows once more.
“Molly Hooper,” He said upon entrance, a dazzling smile on his face. Molly was shocked, her smile flickering on and off her face. “I have a question for you, since I’m sure you’ll be able to answer it with your experience.”
Watson would unwrap the old bandages and carefully apply new ones after sanitizing the wound and making sure the bandages were clean. Holmes would sit there impatiently, not doing as most people would – watch the bandages go around and complain at it if it got to tight. Watson had to pay extra attention to make sure he didn’t because Holmes would never tell him – he just wanted it to be done.
“I swear, he sounded normal – his voice sounded… normal. He was obviously in discomfort, but he was never one to let on he was in pain or that he was upset. I thought it was just another bad headache – until he mentioned his stomach. I debated food poisoning, but he was careful about his food. Paranoid, even, that someone had poisoned it or something.”
“Nothing you will say will sway me, John, because I’m very unsure on this case so I’m making lots of assumptions – of course it might not be a doctor, but I’m going to assume it is so I don’t go absolutely insane.” Holmes rambled, making John freeze.
“No… not in the mood.” He said, drawing out ‘mood’, his voice sounding gloomier than usual.
They got in to see Molly, who had the file on the new victim all typed up and ready for Holmes to peer over, but he quickly handed it to John to look at first. “Tell me what you see.” He said, watching John’s every move. Molly stood there in shocked silence, seeing what had become of Holmes.
are all explained
5 oz is, quite frankly, a shit ton of marijuana for someone who is a new medical user.
Sherlock turned over with an irritable jerk and said, “Can we just call is pot, Mycroft?  Weed, marijuana, cannabis?  Because there is a dispensary in our home currently.  That you supplied.”
He was shocked to see her turned around, sitting again in her chair.  She nodded her head as his chair as if trying to tell him to sit back down.
Sherlock shook his head in agreement and said, “You're home rather early.”
“And he will no doubt be bringing women to the flat.  He will be on dates when Lestrade calls with a case, and he should not be expected to join you.  He will need his own life, Sherlock.  Are you prepared for that?”
“What thing?”
He wanted her more than he had wanted anyone in a very, very long time.

"What did you say,  Sherlock?"
The furthest he’d gotten with her had been a quick exchange of ‘Good Morning’s’ as Sherlock and he had been running out of the morgue during a recent case.  In truth, Dr. Love wasn’t someone that he would normally consider chatting up; Sherlock was right (of course he was) in saying that he had a type – he always leaned toward the curvy, sarcastic blonds, the Tinsley Chesterton’s of the world.
“So, Sherlock. Want to tell me how you manufactured that?” he said.
***********************************************
She smiled, and her notes took on an agreeable feel in her own style.  She then paused and returned to the yearning notes that she had been playing before.  The notes were taut with want, want that felt unfulfilled, and transitioned into desire and lust.
But then the song shifted.  Sherlock sense that Eurus seemed to be trying to say that she meant no one any harm or ill will. ‘Love Me Do’ shifted into the plaintive, yearning melody and then back again until the two songs became their own melody, something new and strong and whole.  And then the notes of longing reemerged.  Throughout all of this, she stared at him with intensity.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s when the television appearances began.  In the year between her graduation and matriculation at Harvard she appeared on Donahue, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Dick Cavett Show, The John Davidson Show, 60 Minutes, CBS Sunday Morning, and had even appeared in episodes of Kojak, Hollywood Squares, and Medical Center.  Though she didn’t enjoy the appearances, she understood that they would pay for her college education and give her a nice nest egg for her future.
He looked him in the eyes.  He didn't use any of his Calculated Looks or Patented Vocal Techniques.   He simply answered,  "I said that I love you."
Sherlock had tried to help, but because his grasp on human emotion is tenuous at best, he'd had very little clue of what to do.  He did locate the psychiatrist who would give John the Klonopin, because it was that or a mental hospital. Sherlock was adamant that he not get locked up.  That if Culverton Smith had taught the world anything, it's that hospitals aren't as safe as we'd like to think they are.
Sherlock huffed and turned for maximum Belstaff swish feigning annoyance. It didn't really matter whether John had figured out his involvement at this point or not. The date was on.
He looks at Rosie, beautiful Rosie, who will never know her mother.  Who will grow up without a primary, dominant female role model.  Whose father can't make it through the day without Klonopin – prescribed, of course, by a psychiatrist that he’s known since medical school (who is exceedingly trustworthy and was vetted by none other than The British Government himself).
“You usurped my investigation?” Sherlock leapt out of his chair, walking back and forth in a rapid stalk, roaring at Mycroft, “Of all the things you could do to me, Mycroft – bringing Moriarty into my life, neglecting to tell me about the existence of Eurus, letting me think for years that Redbeard was a dog – of all of those things – usurping my investigation is the one I cannot forgive!”
I just want you to know that if you re-read a chapter of this story, you might find a few words changed here or there, or a phrase inserted, or something corrected.  As I'm re-reading, I edit.  I try to limit how much editing that I do once published, but it seems to help me polish the story when I make it public.
and it was quite a thought provoking read.
“Well, I’m happy for you, Greg. Couldn’t have happened to two better people.”
She blushed. John was exceedingly good at this. Women almost launched themselves at him. It was embarrassing, really.
For those of you that don't know stoner lingo, here's what I've referred to in this chapter:
He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. Tried to tamp down his desperation to know her mind, to know exactly what she was trying to tell him about John.  She hadn’t come across as malicious.  She’d been as gentle as he had ever seen her, as if she was being careful to let him know that she had no evil intent.  She knew that he yearned for John, that much was certain.  But there had to be more.
“She's called 'Rosie',” Sherlock corrected petulantly under his breath.
“Mine’s close.  Just got a fresh supply.  You game?” She was still smiling at him.
you and bring you back to
“Very,” she smiled wistfully.  “It’s been almost too good.  You know how you’re always waiting for the shoe to drop, the bad thing to happen; it’s like you expect everything to go wrong?  During our first date I realized that I didn’t feel like that.  That I felt comfortable with him, like I’d always been with him.  It’s so easy when you find the right person.”
She smiled. “Molly is so happy with him.  He’s good for her.  She needed someone like him.”
“So, Greg LeStrade, then?” he teased.
She talks to him at the most random moments, always looking so smug, like she's the answers to all of his questions – just like when he'd first met her.  When he'd shagged her rotten in her bed after a very charged first date, and when they'd fucked so hard the next morning (yes, he'd stayed, she'd insisted) that one of her bed slats gave way and they just kept on going.
“Ah, yes, John. Tinsley and I have known each other since upper levels.”
John had looked quite attractive when he'd left to pick up Tinsley. Button up shirt, suit jacket, nice trousers, new pair of loafers. He had picked out clothing that showed his assets at their best. Before he left, he gave Rosie a kiss on the forehead and squeezed Sherlock's arm. Rosie squirmed in Sherlock's arms trying to get to John and Sherlock had said, “Not right now, dear, daddy has a date with a very lovely woman,” and John had given him a fond smile. And then he left.
Sherlock visits Eurus at Sherrinford.
He, of course,  knows all of the seduction techniques,
He thought back to that time in Afghanistan, before the worst fighting, when some men in his platoon had asked him to smoke some pot with them; that night had been the best sleep he’d had in the desert.  He’d smoked a bit recreationally in university – had his fair share of stoned shags, so it’s not like he was a blushing virgin.  That thought had actually made him laugh out loud, alone in his bedroom (Sherlock had Rosie.  Sherlock was actually an amazing babysitter.  Rosie adored him.  He treated her as if the earth revolved around her – which it possibly could, in his mind devoid of basic knowledge of the solar system. He was presently calling her his drooling masticator, as she was currently teething.)
“At Great Ormond -”
“Yes, yes, a debriefing.  Whatever.  Let’s get it over with,” he replied testily, angry at his reaction to his sister.
“Also, true, but also quite simple to assume.”
“I like you, you like me, we both obviously want each other.  Dr. Watson, have you ever fucked a woman while you were stoned?”
"And you said you weren't gay. "
John's got his 'everything's fine' face on,  but he's skittery and looks trapped.   He finally manages to rasp out, "What are you doing?"  His voice has dropped, husky and yet careful.
“Has she now?”
So John listened to Mycroft for once and ground up the OG Cush, which stank up the entire flat, packed it into the vaporizer, examined his conscience one last time, and toked up.
She looked at him, a small, knowing smile on her lips.  She waited.
“Seems she wasn't ready for a lie down after all. Would you feed her? I've got to call Molly about watching her during my shift tomorrow night. Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister this weekend and you're away at Sherrinford -”
When John had been healthier, back in the early days, back in the days that he had been chipper and carefree, he would often hum as he tinkered about the apartment.  He had an affinity for The Beatles and the song that most often came from him, in those moments when he was cleaning or cooking dinner was “Love Me Do.”  He had told Sherlock that it wasn’t really his favorite song, per se, but it was catchy and often in his head.  That he loved The Beatles and when he needed a bit of bounce, “Love Me Do” was as good a song as any.
“I used Sherlock perhaps ten years ago when I was being extorted over some photos – the less said about that the better - but Sherlock found the people behind it and they are still in prison. Mycroft had a bit to do with that, we think," Tinsley explained.
He had her.  He felt the shift the moment that it happened.  Felt the want radiating off of her the moment he’d said the word ‘breath.’  He knew she’d keep playing, though.  After all, she’d want to make it good for him, too.
“The Greg LeStrade way?” she asked, cocking an eyebrow.
“Yes, John,” he said, and John looked at him again like he was an unsolvable mystery. “I've just realized something rather extraordinary and – I will need a bit of time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They met in the atrium of Barts. He'd routed an important piece of paperwork that was rather urgent away from her desk at Great Ormond to her counterpart's desk at St. Barts. They were outside the main entrance of Barts (the probability that the main entrance would be used is the highest based the location of Genevieve Yates' office in the building). They were on a case that Sherlock had solved while in the cab directly en route to their present location. Lestrade would be called directly after introductions were made, giving John time alone with Tinsley. Sherlock was pretending to be deep in his manic thinking phase, pacing back and forth, situated where he could observe everyone coming out of the hospital. Then he caught sight of her.
And we can't forget that his last therapist, who he'd thought was brilliant, perhaps as brilliant as Sherlock (irony of ironies), had shot and kidnapped him, had dragged him into a twisted game that she'd concocted to win Sherlock from Mycroft and him which ended with him chained up in the bottom of a well with frigid water rapidly rising. A well where he'd found the bones of Sherlock's baby brother, who had unfortunately not been saved from Eurus's machinations.
“Mm hmm.  You should also know that she’s let one of your secrets slip.  It’s a secret that we both share, a very illegal and
John returned from the kitchen with Sherlock's tea, sitting across from him in his chair. As Sherlock stared at John in thought, John said with sadness in his eyes, “But of course you don't know. We've been here too many times before, haven't we? Best to just let it lie, I suppose.” He looked at the floor, ran his hand over the back of his neck, and looked back at Sherlock. “Still,” John said with unexpected reverence, “I hope that someday you do understand. It would be quite a thing to see a besotted Sherlock Holmes.”
I am making no money.  I just love my Baker Street boys.
“I think you’re looking at this all wrong,” Heather said, her voice seductive and teasing.
I have no beta.
“We’ll need to do a debriefing,” the psychologist said, looking at him, assessing him.
“Thank God,” Sherlock murmured into the back of the sofa.
She walked to the hopper that she placed her violin in when she was done playing. This usually signaled that she was done with him.  She would stand by the hopper with her back turned to him until he left.  This time, however, she came back and sat in front of him again, looking levelly at him, calm and cold.  For the briefest of moments, she looked sad for him, sad that he didn’t understand her.  And then she stood and turned her back to him.
“Oy!  I did no such thing!  I didn’t even know about your IQ – which, by the way, is quite impressive and I do have questions about – “
John was having trouble seeing an end.
Has he mentioned that he’d become bitingly sarcastic, sometimes downright vicious, to said flat mate, who also was his best friend and whom he trusted implicitly?
“And that man would be you, Captain Watson?” Heather asked, her lips slightly quirked.
“Sherlock, I'm sure we have just a moment to speak with Miss -”
“You have to understand,” she’d explained. “In those days, in the 1970s, particularly in small town Appalachia, people, even the schools, minded their own business.  But when I became special,” she said, with sarcastically, “they couldn’t ignore me anymore.  The state board of education became interested, and the media caught wind of my scores, and all of the sudden CPS was there, and I was being taken from my mother.”
“Yes, actually.  Despite what you might think, Sherlock, I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Watson.  Should his evening have gone poorly, Inspector Lestrade was on back-up to bring him home.  It appears that Lestrade's assistance won't be needed after all.”
“Good things, I hope.”
“Yes, I know; she’s a scientist in a supermodel’s body.  And she’s well aware of it.  But she doesn’t flaunt it.  Says it doesn’t matter, how she looks.  She says what matters is her brain, and I tend to agree.”
He was falling, he could feel it.  She was beautiful, sensual, blindingly intelligent.  She was cheekbones and sharp edges but soft at the same time.  She was shy glances and blushes and furtive touches, and yet she was allowing him to tangle her up and draw her in.  She was yielding and submissive with just an edge of challenge.
John had been a very sexual person.  It was a dominate trait of his personality, even if he kept it hidden under horrifying jumpers and ill fitting trousers.  It was something that he needed, and as much as he despised Mycroft's advice, he was correct; if John continued his improvement, he would be seeking outside companionship.
He must have pulled a face because Molly scooted over toward him and put her hand on his. “I’m sorry if I’ve said the wrong thing.  I didn’t mean to.  I know it’s been hard for you.  But I’m so happy that you’re here.”
At that moment, he realized that if he could have deep, unbidden feelings for Irene Adler and she for him, then what was there to keep John Watson from having those same feelings for his consulting detective?
“He is doing quite well in the A&E . . .”
“Hi, John!” Molly said, cheeks slightly flushed.  Molly’d never been able to tolerate much drink.  She was picking at a plate of chips that she pushed closer to him.
The Mary that he saw was the Mary he’d decided – really wanted – to spend the rest of his life with.  To build a home with, grow old with; maybe become a country doctor with.  Back then he’d been so optimistic.
“Oh! Miss Chesterton.” She held out her hand to John and very quickly looked him up and down. Liked what she saw (obviously – Sherlock knew her preferences as well) giving him a coy smile.
She blushed again.  John couldn’t imagine anything more gorgeous than a woman blushing at his advances. “There you go, assuming I need a man,” she countered, smiling, concentrating on her napkin.
“I can’t have been the only man doing that,” he countered.
“Must not have been involved in that one, then,” he commented of John. “Took Sherlock a few days.  After the third body I decided it was time to get on with it and I asked her out.  It’s been good, John, really good.”
was a Czechoslovakian geneticist who used crossed pea plants resulting in the discovery of dominant and recessive genes. He is the first person that you learn about in any genetics class.  He's like a patriarch - the Abraham - of the genetic world.  Rosie likes peas.
“Yes, John, I'm fine!” Sherlock said in irritation. “I said I'm fine and I meant it!”
“I’ve read your hospital bio and might have found your blog,” she offered.  “Had to learn about the man that kept undressing me with his eyes every time he passed my lab.”
Rosie was due a few jabs, but Sherlock knew Rosie (almost as well as he knew John) and he triumphantly Gets Her Through the jabs with only a few moments of screaming,  but quite a bit of sniffling and betrayed grizzling.   Rosie's nurse thinks he's so charming (mumbling about 'dear,  sweet Da's' and 'such a lovely little family Rosie has') that after she gives Rosie a sticker with some banal cartoon character on it (which Rosie promptly puts into her mouth) she hands Sherlock a lollipop with a cheeky wink.
Getting up and looking out his window he saw Sebastian looking up at him from across the street.
Sebastian gave a
“Please don’t let me turn into a witch.”
“It’s true I’ve been at this for a long time.”
The baton finally got a good hit on Sebastian, hitting his legs and forcing him to fall on the ground unable to move.
“What do you mean you don’t know? Everyone has to make a fucking deal with you. There’s no way that someone can just gain this ability on their own.”
“You were specifically thinking of Molly though, weren’t you?”
He was dreaming.
John closed the distance between them and hugged his sister.
“You’re such a fool John Watson. You’re always concerned with other people and never think about yourself. Who won’t you consider all the people who would be really sad if you were gone? Why don’t you think about all the people who love and care about you so much!” It was in that moment with Sherlock pleading with him that he felt a sense of déjà vu.
John only shook his head no.
“You’re delusional and you can’t believe that fucking satanic cat.”
“You knew but never said anything,” John said to Sherlock after school.
“What will happen to us,” asked Sherlock. “
“What are you getting at?”
I’m just trying to-“
Sebastian sat back down on the grass, finishing his food. He called for a cab to come pick them up as the sun began to set. There was still one thing bugging John though.
“That’s the thing, I can’t even remember but it still felt familiar somehow. Like a forgotten memory or something."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you ever pay for anything?”
“But as even you can see everyone else has a partner already and as the only open seat, I took it.”
Sherlock's hidden history finally revealed
“If you would use the grief seeds like a regular contractor then you would be fine,” said Sherlock whose face betrayed nothing of what he was actually thinking.
“Sorry, sorry please continue.”
“I’ll do anything.”
“Uh, thank you,” said a gob smacked Greg.
“I can’t believe I was talked into this. I knew there was nothing that could be done! I knew and yet I still fucking fell for it! And now I know. I know for sure I couldn’t save Jim.”
“Food.”
“That’s Lestrade!”
John had been running frantically in all the areas Irene had told him about. She had spots that she checked frequently yet she wasn’t at any of them. Maybe if he knew where Sherlock lived he could find him instead. As soon as he began that line of thinking he spotted Irene on one of the bridges she had taken him to. Running up to her he explained the situation.
John nodded in understanding.
“Yes, your plan! Are you really going to fight Magnussen on your own?”
“Well friends isn’t really what I would call it,” began Jim.
John ran as fast as he could. He didn’t even know if he could find Irene and if he did he didn’t know if they would make it back in time.
“The name is Irene Adler, you can call me Miss Adler, or Miss which is short for Mistress,” she said with a seductive smile.
“I gave up counting long ago.”
Characters are still the same.
“Oh John,” Mike finally said with a very distant voice, “do you want to come with me?”
“What are you doing here?”
“Is that anyway to talk to your savior?” The flower monsters were coming closer and making a loud agitated sound. Turning to face the flowers she pulled out what looked like a golden jewel. “Hold on to your apology sweetheart, I have to take care of these things first.”
John nodded, he understood.
The feeling of being left out came quickly when he went to his next class. Everyone was pretty much paired up and there was an empty table at the back where he no doubt would have to sit. Walking up to the teacher though was just a formality, still having to introduce himself so he could be seated.
Sherlock’s hand cupped his face and his thumb gently stopped the tear from falling to the ground.
“I’ll fight anyone who hurts other people, especially if they’re contractors.”
“So I wasn’t wrong.”
“Who is this?” asked Tom.
“Help?” Greg finished John’s sentence. “Sherlock doesn’t give a damn about me. I can see right through him. He tries to act indifferent to everything but I know he does actually care. Just not about me. So he don’t say he wants to help me.”
“Sherlock? Why does it feel… like we’ve done this before?”
“We’re not done incubator,” he spat out as he followed Sebastian and John after Greg.
John didn’t reply for a moment as he pulled on a dry shirt.
“Why did you trick us? Greg fumed.
“It’s ok John, we’re going to be ok. We can defeat Magnussen on our own. Just the two of us.”
The thing was Kyubey hinted that maybe there was a way to turn Greg back. He didn’t know of one but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a way and if John made a contract he would definitely have enough magic to probably turn Greg back to a human. Maybe he should do it. Maybe he should call Kyubey back.
“You should give me the grief seed. Since it’s absorbed darkness it can now hatch and become a witch,” said Kyubey.
“I have to say John, this feeling I have now is pretty good. I feel a lot better, I even have more energy I think.”
“Oh you’re on.”
Feeling himself come to in the labyrinth he looked around to see where he was stuck. It appeared like some dark forest with the fog settling across it still heavy. He could feel something behind him though and getting to his feet he saw the red eyes of a gigantic dog. He began to run through the fog but the ground was uneven and slippery. There was no end to the forest and the more he tried to breathe the harder it became.
“Aren’t you afraid though? Before we decided not to make contracts because of the life threatening danger.”
John grabbed the clock at the side of his bed to see that he had less than five minutes to catch the bus if he wanted to get to school on time. Cursing rather loudly he got out of bed nearly falling flat on his face after getting his legs tangled in the sheets. Quickly putting on his uniform he ran out the door only yelling goodbye to his family without giving them a single glance.
It had been one year.
“You two should stand back, I don’t want you getting hurt,” she said as she extended the riding crop into a whip again.
Sebastian had enough of all of them. He was angry at being stopped earlier and everything was just going wrong. There was no way he was sticking around for all this drama and he knew that he couldn’t go after the witch right away.
Sherlock didn’t answer, he merely disappeared. John gave an exasperated sigh.
Despite being prompted by Mrs. Hudson to share information about himself all he did was say his name was Sherlock Holmes. He did however from the moment he stood in front of the class, stare at John.
Sherlock reached out his hand to the star filled john and from what he could tell John also reached out for him too and they were brought close. The sensation was practically indescribable as Sherlock rested his forehead against John as he held him close. It was like the barrier between the two of them was fading away and they were being merged together while also fading into the universe too.
John saw Greg’s body in the room and running over to it he saw that it was limp like before when he had thrown the soul gem. Sherlock broke into the labyrinth after busting a hole through one of the cells.
“I agree with Kyubey, why don’t you follow me around tomorrow after school so you can see what it’s really like,” said Irene.
“What happened to that thing you had?” asked Greg.
“Hello Mr. Holmes, I see you’ve taken the initiative of finding a seat for yourself. Despite not knowing if you could take that spot.”
“Just like that? You killed the person that meant the most to you?! John angrily asked while rising. “Does becoming a contractor make you immediately disregard people as human?”
Greg lunged towards Kyubey gripping him tightly in his fist.
“Well I already told you I’m not going to leave Greg alone, so I don’t know what you were expecting.”
Mr. Anderson narrowed his eyes.
They walked for a little while before Greg could detect anything with his soul gem. The trail led them to an alley often used by junkies but was thankfully not populated at the moment.
“This wasn’t anything like you told me it was going to be. What the hell is up with this shit?”
“I’m sorry you were childhood friends?” inquired John.
“This place was Irene’s for a long time. I’m sure that word will get around to the others and someone will come to claim it,” answered Kyubey.
“And Sherlock can I ask you one more terrible favor?”
Greg gave a small smile.
“Greg!”
Sherlock turned toward the setting sun and away from John.
Greg kept on running even as it began to rain. What was the point of his existence anymore? His only job was to hunt witches and he couldn’t even do that right. He wasn’t cut out for this life like Sherlock, Sebastian, or even Irene were. All he could do was hurt those around him now. He was a monster.
he thought.
When he went to school he looked around the room and saw the same familiar expressions everyone had, he walked past Mrs. Hudson and went straight to John. John looked very flustered by the immediate attention he received from Sherlock.
“There will be no need for that,”Sherlock said as he appeared before them. “I’ll handle this.”
“I won’t let you make a contract with him.”
“Sherlock…” John said stepping between him and Greg hoping that if he were in the way they wouldn’t fight but Greg didn’t care.
“How could you?” seethed Sherlock.
“Ah yes, Mr. Holmes. You can sit next to John Watson today, his partner is sick and he can introduce you to the topic we’re learning. Don’t think that because you just transferred I’ll be lenient with you. You’ll still have to keep up with the work I assign you from this day on,” said Mr. Anderson who Sherlock could tell was sleeping with the History teacher with the way he talked to her in the hallway and how she smelled of his deodorant.
“So that’s the kind of monster he is,” said Sebastian who now understood what type of magical boy he was dealing with.
And it was with that last plea, Sebastian’s fate was sealed.
Sebastian Moran introduces himself ready to kick ass and probably murder.
responded John.
“I’m not the one who just acted like a rag doll with a witch,” Sebastian growled not feeling in a generous mood anymore.
“Alright, I’ll leave. Today was a wash anyway. I’m sure we’ll run into each other again.”
John gave a look of distaste.
“I didn’t come here to fight, I only wanted to stop it from making contact with John Watson but I’m too late.” John could hear the hurt in Sherlock’s statement. When the dark haired boy looked directly at him, he couldn’t look away. “Do you remember what I said?” It took John a moment to understand that he was referring to the conversation from earlier.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It means that this world has been trying to get rid of the fucking anomalies that are contractors and instead has reached a vicious cycle of creating hunters that turn into predators that need more hunters to get rid of them. You’ve probably have thought it, even if you’re not a Magical Boy. None of this should’ve happened.”
“Yeah sorry I only sent you a text but I needed some time you know. Everyone is just the same and it’s like we’re in our own world.”
“I guess you’re right,” said Greg.
I don't know if the title was deceiving for this chapter because she wasn't literally burned but I do feel sad about Irene dying because I do adore her character.
Other people in the restaurant became quiet staring at them. John calmed down waiting for the light chatter to pick up again. He was embarrassed by his sudden outburst. Sherlock however stayed composed.
John was surprised, he would never guess Sebastian was the type to reveal anything personal.
“There’s no rule saying that you can’t wish for something to happen to someone else,” said Kyubey.
“That’s the plan. Don’t you see John, we are all going to die and go on to a better place!”
“Greg, I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” said John as he ran up to him.
Sherlock finally broke the silence.
Greg begins to slowly spiral out of control.
Greg smiled going up to John and wrapping and arm around his shoulder in a half hug.
“We can’t fight our way out of here and hold onto this deadweight.”
“Molly?! Molly, what’s wrong?!”
John only paused for moment but he did begin to walk with Sebastian.
“Is there a reason why you needed me to come with you? You’re obviously not sick.”Sherlock didn’t respond and continued to walk at his brisk pace. Becoming frustrated John started to ask, “What is going-“
“It’s true that the others mainly care about acquiring grief seeds but you can’t criticize them for that. Only other contractors can.”
“John, I have an idea.”
“Why do you say that?” asked Greg defensively.
“The thing in front of me wasn’t human! It was a gigantic monstrous bird out of hell and it was trying to kill me but I wanted to live! In that moment I wanted to live so I did the thing we were made for and I killed it! You can’t tell me the thing you saw before was human. You can’t tell me any of the witches you’ve seen were human!”
“Get up now!” she yelled, ripping off his bedsheets. “You’re not sick and you can’t afford to miss another day of school. So get your ass out of bed and downstairs in five minutes or I swear I’ll set your bed on fire!”
They began to walk together but he could still feel the distance between Sherlock and him. Sherlock still had a shroud of mystery around himself and he thought that if Sherlock was in a better mood they might actually be able to talk to each other without any of the vague warnings.
“That’s true. You can say I did and didn’t give him a contract. He’s an anomaly here.”
“What?!” Then the next shock came when he saw that they were suddenly in a witch’s labyrinth with the witch right in front of them. “Where did that come from?!!”
John’s eyes widened in recognition of him but he couldn’t believe the menacing tone he gave. He noticed that Sherlock was wearing some sort of strange outfits that was purple and had a cape. He also had a strange silver disk on his arm.
John didn’t know what the hell was going on but still decided to pick up the animal. As he began to rise and walk out of the ally he saw a figure in front of him.
Even as he was working he continued to worry about Greg. He was trying to help Greg but he didn’t know what was going on with him. Did becoming a magical boy begin to make you an emotionally distant asshole? He was going to something drastic himself if Greg didn’t snap out of it. He’d be damned if he just let things go on as they were. Greg was a good person and his best friend who was usually the voice of reason. Now everything was just crazy.
Sherlock frowned but called out to Sebastian.
“Greg wished for someone to be healed so he gained the ability to healer at an extraordinary rate himself,” Kyubey said helpfully.
Sitting up now, Greg had a look of complete shock.
“A marvelous place John, you must come with.” Mike grabbed onto John’s wrist, leading him to some unknown direction.
“If you don’t tell me what just happened then I swear to god Sherlock I’ll-,”
Sebastian swore if he hadn’t made a deal to work with Sherlock he would’ve shot him by now.
John and Greg were once again eating away from the others. Molly didn’t seem to particularly mind today she was off talking to Mike and Tom and nothing could bring her down. It was all for the better really.
She began crying even harder and Greg didn’t ask anything further just holding on to her more tightly. Hoping that he could somehow save her from her grief.
“Like Batman, that prick.”
John who was following Sebastian track down Greg, head a noise like a small explosion happen ahead of them. John looked to Sebastian trying to see his reaction and catching his face turn into a grimace.
“I’m not that concerned. Also Kyubey seems to really want you guys to make contracts and as I am eternally grateful to him, I’ve agreed to help you out for now. Once you have powers thought, you’re on your own. Plus it’s really fun to tease Sherlock by hanging out with you tow. He gets this look on his face that just makes me tingle.”
“It’s been too long, there’s no trace of the familiar,” said Kyubey.
“Don’t be so presumptuous Mr. Holmes. I could’ve partnered you with another student.”
Sherlock suddenly reappeared before them breathing heavenly and sopping wet. He gently placed the soul gem into Greg’s open hand. Eventually the light returned to Greg’s eyes and he began to breathe again.
“What are you doing?” he asked as he stood with the animal breathing heavily in his arms. He would never have thought of Sherlock as someone who like to torment and kill animals or wear some weird costume.
The silence was deafening.
He refused this ending!
“You don’t have to tell me that. He’s going to die a lot sooner if he doesn’t shape up and I highly doubt he will.”
Sherlock’s head jerked upward and he quickly faced the small creature
When they got back into the city they immediately went on the hunt for Greg. Sebastian being the excellent hunter he was took him less than an hour to track him down.
Sherlock as Homura
“No, my battle is somewhere else.”
“If you think I’m going to listen to anything you have to say you’re crazy.”
“That will be plenty of time.”
“Me neither, I guess we’ve been so blessed that we don’t really have a need for some life altering wish you know? Makes you wonder why we were chosen while there are others who would have no problem with know what they want.”
The witch in front of them had the appearance of a monstrous fox like creature. He could hear painful shrieking as if the witch was crying out but John could still not comprehend that the creature in front of them was his best friend. The labyrinth was looking more like a prison with them being surrounded by cells whose doors were continuously opening and closing with a loud clanging noise
“We don’t have to wish for anything. After all why should we change our lives so much to hunt these things that twenty four hours ago we didn’t even know existed?”
“If you open your mouth any wider I think you could put a whole muffin in there,” whispered Molly.
Jim had a look on his face debating whether or not he was going to acknowledge actually being called on, it was Sebastian who lead him across the street.
Before John could try to defend Sherlock, Sherlock responded.
“So what, it’s like no good deed goes unpunished?”
Sebastian held out his hand. Sherlock took it and with the handshake the deal was done.
Sebastian suddenly created a hand gun.
That one little fact, had killed Sebastian and John could blame himself for that one too. If he hadn’t guilted Sebastian into helping him then he would be alive and helping Sherlock. Sherlock who he hadn’t seen since that day. He was finally going to know it all. No more lies, no more mystery.
of agitation before narrowing his eyes. John tried to take a step forward but a type of barrier materialized in front of him making it impossible. Things were definitely going down hill fast.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he pulled out a gun.
Before Sherlock could reply there was suddenly several glass bottles thrown at him shattering as they missed. Greg grabbed John’s shoulder, forcing him to turn around and yelling at him to run. As they made their escape, the farther and farther they got away from Sherlock the more John realized something was wrong. Besides the fact that they were running away from the weirdly dressed new boy and that he was carrying a dying cat, he noticed that their surroundings were becoming distorted. It was as if they were being transported into some sort of wonderland.
Harry looked at him putting a hand on her hip and narrowing her eyes.
“Greg!”
“Yes.”
“Sherlock!”
“Sherlock,” he began turning to him and smiled “I don’t regret saving you I want you to know that. I’m happy that we met.”
“That’s not going to happen. I want to protect him and not drag him down any further into this crazy world.”
“I won’t leave you,” was his defiant reply.“I’m not going to let you go and possibly die alone.”
“It’s alright only you can see me,” said Kyubey.
Greg didn’t wait for John after school again, and it took him sometime to finally catch up. He found him in the same alley way that he had fought Sebastian.
“John when you bring Irene I can talk to her and lead you here.”
“That’s true, he only recently arrived here and today was the first time we actually spoke,” added Irene.
“Who do you think you are, trying to control me? Now I believe you’re a good guy deep inside but I’ve had enough of this Sherlock. You can’t just threaten me and not tell me why it’s so important for me not to make a contract! What am I to you?!”
Something I should also point out is that this is not at all brit picked and if you find the characters a little ooc I do apologize for that.
Sebastian took a step back startled.
“I’m sure you’ll find it or at least a witch.”
“Please, please come back,” he murmured as tears streamed down his face.
Sebastian cautiously stepped in front of John.
“Is there something wrong, Sherlock Holmes?” Jim asked, saying the name as if he were testing out the syllables of a nonsensical word.
“John Watson.”
“Of course, now grant my wish Incubator!” he ordered with a sneer.
The witch was in a panic and was evading the blades Greg was throwing at it. He was greatly hindered by the branches and had to keep on hacking through them. Right before he was able to reach it, two shots rang out and deflected the blades he was going to use to pin it down. John looked around in confusion, trying to see the perpetrator. He could hardly make out the figure through the trees but he knew that it was definitely not Sherlock.
“Why… why does it have to be you?”
The boys who still needed some answers, went with Irene to her apartment where she served some tea to calm them. She had used her jewel and by holding it close to the weird animal, she healed it.
Greg chuckled.
Greg was breathless but he continued to push on attacking the witch. Quickly dodging several of the freakishly long arms he swung his blade down to sever each arm that followed him. He could feel the witch’s blood splatter across him as he cleaved through another arm. Another hand came at him and before he could move away, it threw him on the ground knocking the air out of his lung stunning him for a moment. The witch was relentless though hitting him again and again as he felt the blood begin to fill his mouth and a couple of ribs crack. When he heard John cry out to him, he manifested another sword cutting down the assaulting appendages.
“You just are trying to talk me out of making a contract for Sherlock. That’s all you’re doing.”
“I’m such an idiot. So, so stupid. I can’t do anything. I can’t fight witches, I can’t be the good guy, I can’t be there for Molly,” Greg said with his voice cracking.
“No.”
“Greg?” John spoke apprehensively.
Kyubey appeared and Sherlock struggled to get up.
The girl using a riding crop whipped it around and the end extended eventually wrapping around the creature and binding him til he fell. Then John with a gun that he created took aim and with several rounds, shot the monster. Afterwards with a big show John clasped his hands tightly and with what looked like an assault rifle unleashed a powerful shot that looked more akin to laser blasts from sci fi films then what should’ve come out of the gun.
John Watson was amazing, and Sherlock was actually happy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then I hope my words weren’t in vain. Goodbye John Watson.” Sherlock then disappeared down a dark ally.
“Oh poor thing he’s about to crack,” Irene smirked. John got on his knees and told Sherlock to take deep breaths.
Even as John spoke those words he knew that the wish wasn’t what was really bother him but it was knowing about the reality of magic and witches and the fact that they were out there hurting people. He felt responsible somehow knowing this. But he didn’t know what was a worthy wish. He had one chance to make a difference and it needed to be something that he wanted so bad, it was worth altering his entire being. To tear him out of his thoughts, was Sherlock who appeared before them. Greg immediately stood up becoming defensive of John and Kyubey.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and gave a noise of incredulity. Jim of course saw this and turned towards him.
Jumping towards the spider Irene whipped her riding crop through the air extending the end of it, hitting the witch. The spider witch first tried to scurry away, went on the offensive trying to swipe at Irene a few times but she was just too fast. As John watched he could tell she was smiling and enjoying herself. Using the whip to strike it several more times before she wrapped it up like she had done with the rabbit and finishing it off with a grand flourish.
After Sebastian had left them the other day, John had eventually calmed down enough for Sherlock to talk to him again. Sherlock explained that they had to deal with the body now. John absolutely refused to get rid of it. Sherlock then told him they would have to stage it as a suicide then. His erratic behavior recently would make it the most believable answer for the police who are idiots anyway. After a lot of coaxing and perhaps some angry words from John, he eventually helped Sherlock stage the body. Though he did vomit afterwards. A drug overdose of some kind the official report says. No one would ever think otherwise because the truth was absolutely unbelievable. The funeral was already scheduled for next week. Harry tried to ask him if he knew about Greg being suicidal but John denied it.
“I don’t understand what makes a person decide to make a contract and why Sherlock doesn’t want me to.”
“Why don’t you introduce everybody if you’re going to introduce yourself?” Molly said a bit annoyed with Tom.
Greg didn’t answer but after closing his window he eventually did come out to meet John. As they began to walk together John was trying to find the right words to broach the subject about what happened the previous night.
“That’s for me to be concerned about, not you.”
“No she’s too far away,” it responded.
“What do you mean what happened? Nothing happened!” Greg answered nervously.
“Alright then, it can’t be helped,” began Kyubey,”I can’t force you to make a contract and if you’ve made up your minds. I have to leave to find others in greater need of making contracts. Greg, John, we only knew each other for a short time but it was fun.”
“I know he’s acting recklessly and even if I did tell him that, do you think that he would listen to me?”
“But you don’t!” shouted Greg.
“I’ll stay here with you too then,” said Kyubey
Irene walked towards him looking him up and down.
One year since Sherlock’s other consciousness merged within the new universe created self. The world was more or less the same, minus the existence of the contractors, incubators and witches. The world was the reality he had known before learning about all the other things and this time that reality was the only reality.
Greg didn’t know what to say but as they walked along the side walk he saw a tear escape her eye and that she was starting to cry. But Molly refused to stop or wipe away the small stream of tears that were falling and kept the same pace next to him. Even though Greg wanted to stop and hold her and reassure her it was okay to cry and that he was there for her, he thought it was better to pretend that he couldn’t see the tears.
John was having a difficult time. It had been two days since Greg’s clash with Sebastian and things were not going well. Sherlock had not shown up to school and even though Greg was talking to him, he was still actively avoiding him at the same time. Greg’s only explanation was that he was still recuperating but he knew for certain that Greg was still going witch hunting after school. He also couldn’t help but notice he was spending less time with Molly after school. Molly was slowly catching on to the rift between Greg and him, going so far as to ask if they had gotten into a fight recently. John assured he that they had not and for her not to dwell on it. He knew that she wouldn’t let it go for long.
“I don’t want to hear you anymore,” Sherlock said as he cocked the gun.
Sebastian didn’t like having to defend his decisions to anyone. Especially some curly haired prick who had relationship problems. After all it was Sherlock who asked him for some help, even though he didn’t think it would help at all. Sherlock didn’t respond and continued to watch the fight carry on below.
Especially not the truth.
“No. I’m not going anywhere with you until you tell me what you want to talk about.”
“Harry, I have to go!”
“Harry I’m so sorry for making you worry. Thank you for looking out for me all these years. I love you.”
“I didn’t come for a fight.”
“I’m going to take care of him,” called back Sebastian.
“I have no clue,” was John’s honest reply.
“What the hell?”
Outside the labyrinth John and Sherlock had arrived safely. John was concerned for Sebastian and a small part of him was happy that Sherlock had showed. Before he could ask Sherlock any questions and before Sherlock could start yelling at him for being so stupid, it felt like a small implosion happened next to them. Then suddenly Sebastian appeared on his knees breathing heavily.
“Do you feel it too, he massive potential he has?”
“After all that you’ve learned you still want to make a contract with kyubey? Why would you do that?!”
“I’ve already told you, I won’t allow that to happen.”
“John?” he asked.
They both stood there looking at each other and before John could ask him what he was doing here Sherlock spoke.
John waited til he heard Harry walk away, to leave his room. He didn’t blame Harry for worrying about him, it was understandable really. If he could calm her fears he would but there was nothing he could say to her.
Irene however, holding tightly onto her soul gem used her magic to slow the woman’s descent until she safely reached the ground. John caught up to the woman and checking her breathing and heart rate, knew the woman was safe. He noticed that the woman had a strange marking on her neck. Irene pointed to it showing to John and Greg that it was a witch’s kiss. It showed that the witch was messing with the woman’s mind making her depressed and feel suicidal. Walking into the building the woman leapt from they followed the trail of the witch. It wasn’t until the gem began to glow even brighter that they stopped.
“Why does it matter to you what happens to me?” asked John.Sherlock refused to answer and only looked at John with his piercing gaze. John became aware that Irene was standing even further away, keeping an eye on them. Sherlock also noticed and took a step back from them. “The answer is no but I want to know Sherlock… what did you wish for?”
“But he was a contractor, how did he become a witch?”
“If it becomes a witch then I would be too late! I don’t want to be like that damn Sebastian or even Sherlock. They wait for people to die and then collect grief seeds. Well I’m not going to be like them.”
Out of the corner of his eye he could see Kyubey waiting.
“I’m not going,” Sherlock answered curtly.
“No stop! This witch isn’t like the others, Irene!”
“I’m John Watson and this is Greg Lestrade,” he introduced with his awe quickly fading.
“So then, Jim and Sebastian, where are you guys headed?” asked Greg.
“I get it. If it’s too strong for one then maybe two could deal with it.”
“You’re a time traveler.”
“Stop you idiot!” he yelled as he caught up to them breathing hard.
“Yes.”
“But then that fucking satanic cat came along and fucked everything up.” Sebastian stood up in agitation. “Jim had always been frustrated with other people and found them too simple or boring because he was superior to them. If he wasn’t preoccupied with his work or with me he fell into some dark moods. His home life was shit too but I thought if he could just wait for me to go to uni then I could get part of my inheritance and I would take him with me. He was planning on going in early, he was definitely smart enough. But Kyubey came along and told us about the witches and the existence of magic. Well this brought a wonderful distraction that he was so curious about that he agreed to become a magical boy. It sounded like fun.” Sebastian gave a sad chuckle at the last sentence. “Well I thought so too. Fighting witches, gaining magic and I can have a wish too? It sounded perfect. So Jim on a whim no less, wished for a new kind of telescope while I wished for people to give Jim the respect he deserved. I wasted my wish on someone else.”
The end and the epilogue all in the last chapter
“Are you a classmate of Jim? You look a bit older.”
“How did I get back here?” he asked.
Greg looked at Molly and then down at Kyubey, seeing that she didn’t react to the creature.
“You were really taken in by that fucking satanic cat weren’t you? Well let me tell you something, if you’re going to continue to be so naïve then I might as well put a stop to you now before you cause trouble later. So know it off and pay attention before I put you in the ground.”
Sebastian took a step forward with a grim grin.
I absolutely love writing Sebastian. It's kind of harder for me to write Greg because I never want to do any injustice for him but because of how this story goes, I do have to put him through the wringer. Also I start to refer to Magical girls/boys more as contractors which sounds less ridiculous because there is no way to read that without it sounding super childish.
In the classroom everything felt so strange. Molly was in a very solemn mood but John knew that it couldn’t possibly have to do with Irene because she didn’t know her. Nobody here knew about Irene. To everyone else it was just another day, everyone was learning and listening to Mrs. Hudson, they would eat lunch and they would go home. Just like every other day. To this world nothing had changed. Even Sherlock was in attendance but John couldn’t read the regular cold expression he wore. The world was moving forward and nobody would ever notice and nobody would ever care.
“It’s simple, I’m a magical girl. It’s not just my stunning personality, I can literally use magic. There really should be a different title for it though. It makes me sound like some nine year old waving a wand around.”
Sebastian only gave a side glance at Sherlock trying to prove his point that Greg didn’t want to hear anything from him. Still the tall blonde boy glared at Greg for carelessly giving away a grief seed.
“Sherlock is not my boyfriend,”
“But you wanted to fight witches didn’t you? Not other contractors.”
“I know she’s been doing this for some time now and I feel like you’re a veteran of this too.”
True to his word Greg went to school with John and Molly the next day. Molly scolded him for missing and for all the work he seemed to be falling behind in. Greg only smiled and tried to reassure John that he really was okay. John wasn’t so sure.
“You’ve sold your soul for your wish and now you must live the rest of your life as a magical boy. There is no turning back from this.”
“It’s no joke. But fighting witches is very dangerous work so you want to think about if your wish is truly worth a lifetime of fighting witches. Kyubey thinks that you guys are up for the task and has deemed you worthy of a contract,” she responded, taking a sip of her tea.
“Something you could do?! How about fight for once. All you really care about is Sherlock this and Sherlock that. You keep waiting to be saved by him and you don’t even think about how much I’m suffering! You know what Kyubey told me? He said that you could be the strongest contractor ever. Still you refuse to make a deal? Aren’t you willing to give up your soul for help your friend?”
Perhaps this was his punishment for not being able to help Irene. For being a coward and not helping anyone else by making a contract. This was a suitable end for someone who refused to help.
All characters are still the same. You can look forward to a Sebastian centric chapter next!
If he were to just…
“Sebastian I was hoping you would do me a favor.”
“Now’s not a good time, John. I need to find that familiar before it hurts anyone.”
Eventually the distorted world fell away and the monster disintegrated only leaving a small black object behind that the girl picked up.
“Don’t you feel anything, leading innocent lives into danger?” he seethed at her.
Sebastian narrowed his eyes.
Crossing the threshold they first tried to go undetected until they found Greg but that didn’t last long. Sebastian soon busted through the rest of the prison themed labyrinth to reach the core room which they were stuck in before. He knew time was precious, even more so because he wasn’t trying to kill it but keep John and himself alive for as long as possible. Hopefully Sherlock didn’t show up soon either.
“Is that what you really want?” asked Kyubey from behind.
“Every time, you always come and sit and listen to me talk about it and you’re still here? You don’t get anything out of this arrangement and now my dad… he’s going to die. Do you like to see me cry about it? Do you get some sort of perverse enjoyment out of this because I don’t understand why else you would come?!” “
“Don’t let go or you’ll be frozen in time.”
The honest answer shocked Sherlock so much, he finally broke. Going over to John he embraced him, holding tightly as he tried to not cry profusely. Why? Why does John feel so strongly? He doesn’t remember anything! He doesn’t even know about all the other times Sherlock has tried so hard to save him and he still is going almost headstrong to his tragic fate.
“Concerned? About what?!” Greg asked incredulously.
“What if humanity doesn’t advance like Kyubey implied?”
The witch had stopped moving but Greg was relentless in his onslaught. It was starting to rain as Sherlock and surprisingly Sebastian showed up just when the labyrinth and witch fell away. A grief seed was left behind and picking it up, Greg threw it at Sebastian.
Greg nodded, he didn’t quite know what to say to her and thought any words of encouragement would be treated with contempt. After all he wasn’t the one going through the ordeal, how could he know what she needed to hear. He noticed that molly had stopped walking. Before he could ask what was wrong, Molly began speaking.
“It’s true, Irene was talented but even she kept a reserve. Sebastian Moran is a lot more talented and he has a lot more grief seeds than you do, so he can use magic more freely. The way you are now there is no way you could beat either Sebastian or Sherlock.”
“That was a very selfish wish.”
“I’m not saying you would do anything selfish but you should still be careful Greg. There are things you should still take care of.”
As she walked away, John looked helplessly towards Sherlock knowing that he couldn’t do anything to undo Irene’s magic. Following her to where Greg and Kyubey where he left Sherlock behind. He could still hear him yell after them.
Everything he did and planned to do would all amount to nothing.
“With the wish, do you have to use it on yourself or can you make a wish on the behalf of someone else?”
“Excuse me?” John said defensively.
“What are you doing here?”
Harry was the one who had an umbrella but John refused to share it. His reasoning was that it would only make her get her dress wet and not really cover him, which was true but not the real reason he didn’t want to be sheltered.
Sebastian looked up and they could see he was actually crying while smiling an empty smile.
Molly came rushing into the room with an expression of pure happiness.
Sherlock conceded that it was a good idea but he was still angry at the other boy.
“It’s not that! I just want to be able to help you any way I can! I’m so sorry if my being here has caused you pain, I never wanted it to be like that. But Molly you’re wrong, miracles and magic do exist!”
“Thanks mate.”
“You’re leaving me alone!” John’s eyes widened and he stopped struggling from Harry. “How do you think I’ve been feeling lately? Don’t you know that there are people that love and care for you? Please John, don’t make me lose you,”
Mr. Anderson didn’t speak for a moment, blinking in surprise at the sudden change of topic. Clearing his throat he said, “Very well Mr. Holmes. Does anyone want to accompany him to the nurse’s office?”
“You are certainly different. You already know don’t you? What it actually means to be a magical boy?”
The world was engulfed in light.
“How many?”
“Yes.”
Please leave a kudo or comment if you like the story!
“We have to leave,” said Sherlock who knelt next to John.
“Because we have.”
Wait a minute.
“Yes,” was all he could reply.
“It shouldn’t be up to them for us to continue. They messed up humanity and if it takes a couple million more years for humanity to get on track then that’s ok. We would have done it on our own eventually.”
Holding out his soul gem, John seized the opportunity to grab it and rand to the river.
Also heads up with the character death tag.
When he arrived back home with his family he was changing out of his clothes when he heard a soft knock on his door.
“I’ve got this,” he said with confidence.
Molly simply shrugged her shoulders and replied, “I don’t know but it’s an interesting thing to think about.”
He threw it downstream going into the fast current but what he didn’t expect was the reaction from Sherlock and Sebastian.
“Why do you still care so much?! Do you know I’ve been trying so hard to keep you from becoming a contractor because you die! I keep on trying and you always die! Now, I’ve been trying so hard to distance myself from you and you still want to sacrifice yourself for someone you don’t even know. We’re not even from the same time!”
“My family doesn’t live here. I have a brother who is older than me and I try to have as little contact with him as I can.”
“Mike Stamford is Mr. John Watson’s usual partner but he is out sick today.”
Jim’s eyes narrowed at the memory. Sebastian chuckled and received a quick angry glare from Jim.
With that question Sherlock found his voice again.
“You have five minutes and then I’m finishing him.”
“Yeah, if we’re together…” John murmured.
“Perhaps I can because I’m no longer human.”
“What do you mean the same as Sebastian and Sherlock?” Greg said effectively cutting off John. “I’m nothing like either of them. Nothing’s changed between us. I took today to think things over and I know now more than ever that there’s no way I could ever be friends with them. I’m going to take this power that I’ve bargained for and continue to kill witches. I’m not going to waste it on myself like they do. I’m going to help as many people as I can. That’s for sure. All the personal stuff will sort itself out later.”
It was Sebastian and a person Sherlock could only assume was James Moriarty. Sebastian seemed to be amused with the way Jim was complaining about the god awful heat when feeling the stares he also stopped. Jim was angry at him for not moving and was trying to get him to pay attention. Sherlock and Sebastian’s eyes met with the former not knowing if somehow this Sebastian knew. Jim looked across the street to see what had captured his boyfriend’s interest and saw the group of friends who were now all looking at them. Surprisingly it was Molly who recognized them.
“I don’t understand.”
Being here also kept Greg from dwelling on Irene. Exchanging his own misery for someone else’s. John didn’t attend school and frankly Greg couldn’t blame him. If it weren’t for Molly, Greg probably wouldn’t have left his house either. He didn’t understand what it actually meant to fight and hunt witches before but now, there was no way he could make a contract. There was just no way.
“Why don’t you tell me what happened exactly? How did it feel you know, being turned into a
“What were you thinking?” seethed Sherlock.
And even quicker than the pull of the trigger, Sebastian shot at nothing and Greg was far behind him while Sherlock was just in the middle. The scene had completely changed and John couldn’t be more relieved.
Sherlock again didn’t reply as he walked away from them after hearing John’s answer.
“If you don’t come out I’ll come in and I don’t think you want to explain how you know me to your mother.”
The person looked over their shoulder and John could clearly see that it was indeed Greg. His clothes though were different from the uniform he wore earlier, having blue cape and knee high boots.
With that Greg lunged forward with his sword. Expertly, Sebastian flipped his musket using the bayonet end to block Greg’s strike. Greg tried with all his might to press forward but he couldn’t move Sebastian an inch.
herlock tried to laugh but he was too tired and it sounded more like a wheeze of pain.
“How stupid are you?” snapped Sherlock, John was stunned.
John paused for a moment flushing first with embarrassment but looking back he couldn’t remember anything. A dream? Somehow it felt like he was forgetting something important.
“John?” he said weakly.
“Sherlock!”
Greg gave a humorless grin.
Greg was standing in the waiting room of the hospital and he was very worried. He had accompanied gone to there to lend support to Molly and her family knowing that the Hoopers would hear the final results from the treatments Mr. Hooper had been receiving. The Hoopers were optimistic, they had to be. The toll on the whole family continued to increase as each month passed since his diagnosis. Molly’s mother who was originally a stay at home mom was doing all in her power at keeping things together in the Hooper household and to try to put as little pressure as possible on her children.
Irreversible.
“That guys a creep John. I thought he was going to be one of those geniuses who just don’t like people but it turns out he’s a psycho,” said Greg.
John’s only response was to curl up further into his sheets, moving as if he were trying to melt into his mattress. He couldn’t go to school because getting out of bed meant facing the day and facing the day meant facing reality and the reality was that Irene was dead. Irene was dead and no one would ever know.
“I was so stupid, I’m sorry John.”
After school they met up with Irene as promised.
“What’s wrong?! What did Tom say?” John asked deeply concerned.
“You can travel through time right? You’re the only one that can change anything. So please I’m sorry to force this on you. Please… don’t let me be fooled by Kyubey again,” John begged as a tear began to fall.
“There’s nobody else left and I won’t le-“
“Why are you two just staring at each other?” asked Molly. “Did something happen last night after I left?”
Sebastian grinned.
Leaning against his gun he grinned.
Irene smiled.
“What the fuck? Shouldn’t you be at home doing school work and shit?” asked the second guy.
“So let me get this straight, we make a wish and then we get powers which we have to use to fight witches,” asked John incredulously.
“Then tell me Sherlock Holmes, what is your wish?”
“I know Greg is in there somewhere, and I know I can reach him.”
“I know that you’re good friends with Molly,” began Tom. The subject of Molly Hooper immediately put Greg on the defensive.
Greg felt scared because he could hear the sincerity in his words.
“I can’t really protect you. You understand?”
They finally reached an area with an abandoned warehouse and inside it there were other people all lamenting and saying that they were worthless. Each one had a witch’s kiss and he saw that some began to splash gasoline around. None of them were concerned and despite John’s best efforts to snap Mike or any of them out of it, none paid very much attention towards him. It wasn’t until one guy took out a light did John know their intentions.
“I said don’t interrupt, do you want me to finish the fucking story or not?” John raised his hand in a mock surrender gesture. “Jim was this scrawny looking kid who looked like the wind could snap him in two. But it was his eyes. He could read your whole life story with just one glance but it was the first time that our eyes met that I knew he was special. He was clever in a way that was so far above anyone else you couldn’t even begin to understand what he was talking about. But it didn’t matter. I would hear him talk about space and his theories and he said that’s what he liked about me. The way I listened. Also I think he liked that I knew how to hunt but he would never say so.”
“I would be better if it wasn’t for this heat,” Jim replied.
“Sorry John, not right now,” said Greg cutting him off.
“I want you to stop fighting. You’ve won and there’s no point in carrying this on any further. If you do then you can’t fight me instead,” he said with a threatening glint in his eye.
“To be able to see John Watson again, would you trade your soul for that and devote your life to fighting witches?”
“Don’t let me fall for this stupid trick again.”
“Well this is the end!” Sebastian jeered with a twisted grin, holding the gun directly to Greg’s head. Greg could only look up in terror knowing he couldn’t heal fast enough to defend himself. Sebastian had put more magic to the point blank shot meaning Greg’s current wounds had a larger toll on him than the others. John watched in despair holding his breath.
Sherlock stilled, slowly releasing John and creating some distance.
John and Greg follow Irene on a Witch Hunt to see what it means to be a Magical Boy
Characters are still the same with Mike Stamford kind of crossing over into the "Things Hitomi did originally in the anime" category. Also Sebastian Moran as Kyouko.
“Oh guys this is James Moriarty, I lived near him when I was little. It’s been so long! How are you?”
Maybe he should he should take the final step and become a Magical…
Leave a comment or kudos please.
“Because of you!”
“Hey Mike! Mike! Where are you going?!” he called after him.
Greg lifted his head and even with the rain John could tell he was crying.
John looked to Kyubey.
“You can’t help your friend. He’s a witch now.”
Sebastian gave a look of displeasure.
“Do you have anymore grief seeds?”
Irene really enjoyed the training sessions of Sherlock. They quickly discovered that he had the ability to stop time but because of such a high end technique from his wish, he couldn’t produce weapons the same way Irene or John could. So he was encouraged to learn different ways to be able to combat the witches. Sherlock agreed, he was determined to protect John Watson.
“Hey Greg can we-“ he began trying to talk to hi.
“Not in the mood today, Greg.”
When they were outside Sherlock laid Greg’s body on the ground and John fell to his knees grabbing hold of it.
“Really what was that?”
“This means that the door to the witch’s labyrinth is here,” said Irene.
John began to think about the conversation they had with Irene and Kyubey.
“Maybe we should just hear him out,” said John who was hoping that this conversation would not devolve into another fight.
“If I have to talk you out of it then you’re a fucking idiot and I’ll just fuck you up right now. To be a successful contractor you have to be selfish because there is no gratitude in saving other people. There’s no one that can stand beside you. Everything you must do is for yourself or you’ll end up in despair faster and all you good intentions mean nothing either way.”
“Obviously it was to get John to make a contract. Without Sebastian, you have no chance of defeating Magnussen and John Watson is a selfless human being. So it is easy to conclude that removing Sebastian Moran would force him to make a contract with me.”
Then once again Greg moved forward but this time not only was he fast be he was fast but he was more prepared for Sebastian’s bullet. At first it seemed that he missed and Greg charged onward but then the bullet that he was able to dodge had come back, tearing through his right shoulder. Greg faltered for a moment which gave plenty of time for Sebastian to fire another shot.
The jewel began to glow and encased her in a bright light. When it faded away, he noticed that the school uniform she was originally wearing, had transformed into a completely different outfit. She had a black outfits that was risqué with a sharp “v” shaped blouse with sheer sleeves. She also had what looked like a riding crop in her hand and her hairstyle had changed into a bun. Around her neck was a black chocker with the golden jewel from before. Leaping into the air she waved the crop through the air which extended it into a whip. She used it to quickly strike at the monsters, effortlessly slicing them.
“Oh yeah, you’ve got me. I’m actually a secret criminal mastermind who is running a massive empire that spans the globe. Thought I might as well tell you now since you’re asking,” John sarcastically replied.
“Have we me before?”
“Good, I’m glad I could save at least one person.”
“Let me put it to you this way, if you were impaled your body would go into shock, unable to move and you would die. However having a soul gem stops you from feeling the pain your body would typically feel. It does make a slight delayed reaction for other types of serious injuries like having a limb cut off so I don’t recommend it. How else do you think you survived your fight with Sebastian after the grievous injuries he inflicted on you? He’s clearly stronger than you and your healing factor wasn’t the only thing that helped you back up.”
John watched Greg closely, his friend did seem happy with his decision and he couldn’t criticize him for it. But to talk about saving Irene, it was foolish neither of them were to blame and both of them were going to need to accept that. John was still worried, and he didn’t think that he would ever feel at peace again.
Sebastian explains how he became a Magical Boy and John has a terrible idea.
Sherlock raised his hand to silence Sebastian, stopping him from finishing his sentence.
Before John could reply to her flippant remark Irene suddenly stopped walking and turned sharply around. John followed her line of sight and saw Sherlock walking towards them. He couldn’t explain the warmth in his chest that blossomed knowing that Sherlock had come. The mood was quickly spoiled though.
The universe was essentially dying. The astounding number of creatures throughout the universe were using more energy than could be replaced and the solution was magical children. People’s souls had a huge amount of energy and when they traded them away for their wish they were helping the universe by damning themselves. Also it was the incubators, what Kyubey is, who have helped humanity carry on and evolve by granting the wishes of children. The real kicker was that Kyubey still wanted him to make a contract. He said that John’s potential was so vast that not only would he be the most powerful magical boy ever and then turn into the worst witch. Subsequently destroying humanity. So if he ever wanted to save the universe he should go find Kyubey. The creature was trying to guilt trip him into it and the worst thing was that over the course of the last couple days he almost wanted to give into it.
“It’s true. Adolescents in this world are referred to girls and boys so it only makes sense that you’re called Magical Girls and Boys before you mature into a Witch.”
John did survive the battle but Irene did not. Though this time John was now lying on the ground in agony. He kept writhing back in forth hardly able to make sentences.
The tension in the air was so thick you could cut it with a knife and John was hoping that Irene and Sherlock wouldn't actually fight.
“You bastard,” growled Greg. “You waited til the last minute to show up and you let Irene die! You don’t deserve that grief seed!”
“But perhaps that isn’t the best idea,” said Irene.
By now we're half way through and I hope you guys are enjoying the chapter titles because in my first draft I sent to my friend I called it "Greg is an idiot, Sebastian is kind of an asshole but does have a little bit of advice that totally is overlooked and John is a sad person that is helpless" aka "once again everyone is unnecessarily mean and stuff starts to get worse".
Walking down the street on a Sunday afternoon Sherlock was thinking that how great the last week had been when a thought had been put into his head.
During their lunch Greg and John separated themselves from the rest of their friends so they could talk with each other and Kyubey. He learned from Greg that Molly’s father was doing a lot worse and his heart went out to her. He had no idea what it felt like to go through such a painful experience of losing someone you loved very deeply.
“What if we’re not born into this new universe?”
Characters are still
“How many times do I have to tell you to not get involved?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That this would happen, to John if he made a contract with you?”
Jim’s face for a split second was filled with outrage before settling into a calm but disconcerting expression.
Sherlock smiled.
“Please John, go be with your family. I have to deal with this alone,” Sherlock gently said practically begging him.
“John, why would you use it on me!” Sherlock sat up with his strength being restored.
Following his line of sight he saw the two people John was staring at.
Leaving through the hole Sherlock created they successfully escaped the labyrinth.
John was shaking with anger and it took every ounce of will power Sherlock had not to go over to him.
“I don’t think I’m willing to let innocent people get hurt just to get a few extra grief seeds. Besides I didn’t see Irene use a bunch and I know she wasn’t the most upstanding contractor.”
Sebastian let out a quick burst of laughter.
“I still don’t understand.”
Jumping out of his seat, he snatched his jacket and rushed out the door only giving a quick goodbye to his mum saying he would see her later. Following Kyubey, John could only hope he could get there in time to stop Greg from doing something incredibly stupid and probably life threatening.
If you want to know why the rabbit it's supposed be Blue Bell from the Hounds of the Baskervilles, a lot of the witches will have some theme from Sherlock episodes.
John frowned at her answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
John sent the older boy a quick glare and still refused to move forward.
“Not really.”
He was killing each witch on his own. He avoided Irene, he wasn’t going to bring her into this either. He was doing this on his own. Everything was going well. But Magnussen still came and everything went to hell again.
“Are you asking if Molly and I are dating?”
Greg looked at the other boy who had appeared in front of him as the labyrinth faded away. He looked a couple years older so boy was not quit the word he should use. But there was no doubt that it was another Magical Boy.
Greg let out a frustrated huff.
“I have to go and save someone, do you understand? I can’t leave him alone.”
“Yeah I heard about that and I’m not gonna let it fly. You’re clearly one of those contractors who think it’s their job to save people and is a champion of justice,” Sebastian said mockingly.
Kyubey didn’t reply immediately but only stared the empty and appealingly harmless look he typically had.
“That’s not true!” John grabbed Sherlock’s arm drawing his entire attention to him. “I’ll remember you Sherlock. I will and how you saved us the other day. I promise I’ll never forget you!” Sherlock’s fist tightened.
As they continued where Greg left off on his patrol, John could hear Kyubey’s voice in his head.
“Why didn’t you let me kill him?” asked Sebastian who was more than a little miffed about being told not to kill the witch.
“I don’t know, I didn’t make a contract with him. It’s very strange,” Kyubey answered.
“I’m sure I can keep up with the class, however cumbersome you choose to make it,” he replied with a false smile. John watched the whole exchange barely able to contain a smirk.Mr. Anderson however seemed reluctant to let the conversation end there, making John fear that Sherlock already was going to be sent to the head master’s office two hours into school. Sherlock, to everyone’s surprise, rose from his seat. “I am feeling unwell and need to go to the nurse."
“Please stop.”
thought Sebastian.
"After you make a contract with Kyubey you receive a soul gem," she said as she held out the gold jewel from before. "This is the source of your power and it's a little different for everyone. My range of attacks and abilities are no doubt different from Sherlock's."
“You’re friend’s soul gem became too tainted. It contained a curse and he turned into a witch,” stated Sherlock calmly.
“That shot should’ve put you in the hospital,” said Sebastian with disbelief.
“In two weeks’ time a powerful witch called Magnussen will come.”
I altered Kyouko's backstory obviously because Sebastian doing all of it for his father wouldn't make much since to me but if it were for Jim then I could believe it. Also next time we will focus on Sherlock who has been too mysterious for everyone especially John.
Greg turned around surprised to find Sebastian there. Looking back the Hoopers hospital then to the blonde boy he quickly shifted into a more defensive stance.
Sherlock never turned to meet John gaze Instead he said,
He tripped on a rock and fell to the floor hard but before the witch could kill him, in a quick blur someone appeared before him.
“I understand,” he replied.
He was at home with only Kyubey in his room and it was taking every ounce of whatever self-control he had left not to yell and murder the creature. It was the day after the truth about soul gems were revealed to him and he couldn’t find the will to go to school. Instead he secluded himself in his room thinking over the previous night’s events.
“No please! I won’t allow it!” This time it was John who embraced Sherlock, holding him tightly as blood smeared on his shirt.
“Honestly I think I regret that I wasted so much time in making my decision. I ended up making a deal in the end so I wish that I had acted sooner. Then maybe Irene wouldn’t have had to die.”
“What the hell just happened?” Greg asked as he sat up on his own.
“Wonderful, what’s going on now?” asked John who was getting really tired of all the crazy events that just kept happening.
“I don’t know but I don’t think things can get any stranger,” said John.
John watched as a tense moment passed between the two. It was as if they were both sizing each other up and waiting for the other to attack first. It wasn’t until Sebastian relaxed his posture that the atmosphere settle.
“Was that you?” John asked. “Wait what am I saying? I’m talking to some dying cat.”
“Yeah and I’m not saying I’m not scared anymore. I was scared the entire time I was fighting yesterday. But it wasn’t because of the witch. It was because I was afraid that you or Mike could’ve died if I hadn’t done anything. I’m not going to be reckless but with this power I feel more confident in my ability against the witches.”
“What?”
To say John was concerned for Greg would be an understatement. Sherlock had once again took off in his dark and unnecessarily mysterious way and before he could have a proper chat with Greg about what had happened they had to quickly get the hell out of dodge before the police arrived and questioned them. The people that were lured by the witch to the warehouse were all safely unconscious inside. When he went back home he was chewed out by his mum about being gone for so long and without a word from him. Harry expressed concern in her own way, first making a joke that he was meeting up with a random girl but the teasing ended with her sincere concern that if he has a phone he should use it to stay in touch.
“No.”
Greg with John’s help made it back safely to his house where he was left alone with Kyubey. Using a grief seed, Greg was able to clear the darkness that started to cloud his soul gem. One it was shining again he felt better. Laying down on his bed he tried to clear his mind from the whirlwind of a day he had.
“I don’t know what you see in him John. The more I get to know him the more of a prick he seems,” said Greg.
“How can you say that?”
This timeline things were deteriorating more quickly. Greg had also become a contractor, after discovering the existence of them due to Sherlock being less careful with John. A mistake he didn’t see coming but his frantic attempts to get through to the others were in vain. He was thinking maybe with a fourth contractor they would have a better chance this time. It had to be this time.
“He made a contract and now he’s done something that is irreversible. You have to understand the gravity of the situation. What he’s done he will suffer from for the rest of his life. The wish he made mean’s that he’s sacrificed everything else in his life. Now he must carry on as a contractor, that fate is inescapable. I am partly to blame, I really should’ve tried to look out for him like I did for you. It was a stupid miscalculation on my end this time.”
“Why are you helping us then? We would be even more competition.”
“I do hope you can keep up with the course work, I won’t coddle you just because you came in half way through the semester.”
If this was the only result.
“What are you?” Sherlock asked finally calming down.
Sebastian smiled.
“I love you too, you idiot,” she said hugging John tightly.
“He’s doing okay and I think he’s improving actually. They’re going to give us a complete update later this week on his condition,” she answered with such confidence that Greg almost believed her words but a small quiver in her voice betrayed her.
