Sherlock brought him closer to the summit, balancing John on a knife's edge until he was sure Sherlock would allow him to tip over, only to cruelly bring him back.
John escorted her to the elevator and sent her on the way with a brief embrace, wishing her farewell and the best with her cookery lessons.
Sherlock pulled off and continued speaking as if he'd never stopped, just as softly pitched as before. "Where were we? Ah, I was describing my dream to you." Sherlock paused, swiped the back of his hand across his mouth and lazily walked a half circle around John until he was standing behind him, stooping so that his chest brushed John's upper back and his lips on John's temple.
John could admit that he'd thought about it before, what it would be like to top Sherlock, to feel the man around him. He'd been with woman in such a way before, but never a man. Would Sherlock mock him for his inexperience?
John was blushing profusely, and Greg was mortified to be caught out, and Sherlock, that tree-limbed arse was smiling as if it were Christmas. Greg wanted to punch him, but instead he stuttered out some pathetic excuse and grabbed his things quickly before heading out again.
“What the hell,” John muttered, and reached over to hit the switch on the hallway light. He reached forward and grasped Sherlock's bicep and turned him, intending to observe his symptoms, and stopped altogether. For the moment, everything stood still and all John could see were two black abysmal eyes staring back at him.
The man moved to reach for his pocket and Sherlock's low growl rose to a hair-raising snarl as his shining, black lips peeled away from his pointed teeth.
For kilometers around, their frustrated growls were the only sounds as they tumbled together over fronds of bracket, snapping at one another's throats. While the intent to kill one another was not present, John knew that this was as much a show of strength and stamina as it was Sherlock's means to subduing a willful, stubborn wolf. John needed to show that he could hold his own against a larger, more superior opponent, even if taken by surprise.
John nearly sprang into action, but stopped and looked up at Sherlock in the last moment. It was such a familiar glance, the look John always gave him during a case, always so sure that Sherlock had a plan. It was so
The remaining two hunters grudgingly dropped their weapons, raising their hands slowly. The first one bent slowly to his knees, cupping his hands behind his shaved head  and glaring angrily at Sherlock's imposing form. The second man, a white haired middle aged man built like a lorry stayed standing, spitting at the ground before Lestrade contemptuously.
“No, not for a few years, at least.” It was true. He’d been lonely, but it was better than feeling like he owed something to someone, or being forced to cut his hours at the cabaret because his partner didn’t like that his work was what he lived for. “Certainly never here, where I work.”
“You’re quite finished for the night, I gather,” Irene said from the door. John sighed and turned to his friend, expecting her to be angry, but instead, a secretive smile lit her delicate features. “Pity. By the look of you, it would have made for an impressive story.”
Traffic was as congested as usual in central London but began to thin out near the hospital, and in under ten minutes, Sherlock was packing John into the pram and down into the basement where Molly would surely be.
Holmes considered him in an appraising manner, more relaxed now that the two of them were alone. "I don't usually make offers like this, but
Lestrade shrugged, but peered closer anyway, bending down until he was eye level with the infant. "Cute little bugger, isn't he?"
It was a  large sitting room, unnervingly filled with crackling tension and paranoid werewolves. The walls were draped in the same wallpaper from the hall and more parraffin lamps hung from the walls, encasing the room in a dim glow. The flames from the fireplace cast dancing shadows around the room, eerie and unnaturally appearing to take on a life of their own. All the furniture was mismatched and frumpy with time and overuse, providing the room with a lived in feel. Heavy blue drapes blocked out any and all sunlight as well as the potential for prying eyes. Overall, John could say the creep factor was ramped up one hundred percent.
Irene sighed. “We really must work on your manners, darling. You’re not too old to bend over my knee—”
feel ashamed. I've never- I mean I've never done any of this before. I met a girl once who liked to play around with handcuffs-"
“John,” he heard behind him. A large hand fell on his shoulder and Sherlock came around to stand before him. “You’re upset with me.”
“I won’t presume to know how you’re feeling all the time, or what you’re thinking. Sometimes I’ll be too busy to care, and there will be days where I want to be left alone, but never think for one second that you are the reason for it,” Sherlock said, staring into John’s warm indigo eyes. “Now that I’ve said all that, I’d like to take you to dinner again, and if it’s not too presumptuous of me, I’m hoping we can move forward from there.”
Sherlock leaned down and kissed his forehead softly, and pulled away a bit to stare down at him, their noses nearly touching. “You did very well, John,” Sherlock praised him, and John blushed, feeling a mix of pride and bashfulness. “You've made me quite proud.”
John blinked, feeling his heart sink. He had desperately wanted to speak with Jasper and tell him not to worry, that he wasn't angry with the other boy. John had wanted Jasper to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay and say something to make the mood lighter.
Sherlock looked at him then, and there was no doubt of the anger and shame, the pain lingering in his gaze. “We've never been away from one another longer than a week, and now my son won't even find a way to tell me he's okay. He's stubborn and prideful, as was I at that age. I know him better than he knows himself, in that he won't be found until he is ready.”
," Sherlock hissed, pressing back in for another kiss, and pulling back with John's bottom lip between those sharp teeth, "you,
Under the low light of the foyer, Irene's smile was bright and toothy, her blood red lips a siren's call for the weak-willed. "I'm sure I don't know what you're referring to," John muttered, ready for this interaction to come to a conclusion. Irene really did like the sound of her own voice.
Needless to say, John ended up on the front row along with the other journalists, falling asleep while recording the lecture for Mike. His friend could be so damnably persuasive sometimes!
The flat was silent save for the old, rattling radiator and the creaks and groans of wood settling. Outside, traffic was just beginning to pick up and the binmen carrying away the rubbish in the alley below.
It reminded her of a beautiful, round-faced toddler with cornflour hair, following her round the house. John had been a precious child and later in life, a considerate, lovely young man. Then he’d gone and Julia would spend hours sitting in her son’s vacant room, staring at his pictures on the wall because it was all she had to keep herself sane.
It was cold and dank, as most basements were, the air thick and humid, but familiar. Sherlock walked down the steps and used his key to unlock the door at the very back of the room, nearly hidden by storage junk. Through the door was a short tunnel lit sparsely with safety lamps. The path was a short walk, but Sherlock always did find it fascinating.
John chuckled and leant down, pecking Sherlock’s lips sweetly with his own, then pushed his way down the bed to settle between his lover’s thighs.
“You find humour in the queerest things,” Sherlock replied, shrugging as though it should not interest him, but curiosity coloured every word.
“And you're an idiot,” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow at John in challenge. “Are we stating the obvious now?” Sherlock shrugged into a fresh cotton shirt and buttoned it with quick, nimble fingers while John stood there like a fool in a sheet.
“John,” Sherlock grunted, more or less a sob. “John.” He slipped his thumb up the dimple of John's chin to just under his swollen lip, exhaling tremulously as that tongue darted out to lick the tip.
John slapped his hand away and turned his head away. “Because, Sherlock, he said what we both knew was the truth.” He paused and flicked his eyes up to catch Sherlock's in the reflection. “I'm one of many. Soon you will get bored and there's nothing I can do to make you feel otherwise. My life is not fancy dos and bespoke suits,” John shouted, plucking at his jacket. “I'm boring and
"Alright you two," Lestrade growled, stepping in between the men who were trembling with repressed violence. "Put your claws away, boys, there will be no killing," he stated, shooting Sherlock a pointed look, "and no fighting."
John followed as they all filed out, yet the burn of jealousy only grew stronger as he walked away. He didn't know why he felt so emotional about it, considering John had already known they were fucking long before his presence at the house. Obviously, it had been more than that if Sherlock needed to clear the room to say his goodbyes to Victor.
John's hand was on the doorknob and sod it all, if he turned around, Sherlock would see that he was just as torn in two.
Holmes bowed forward, holding the nape of John’s neck in a possessive palm as his hips slapped frantically against John’s arse.
John smiled slightly at that, feeling his shoulders relax slowly. That was Sherlock Holmes speak for 'Of course you can stay.' Feeling relieved, John shucked his jacket off and hung it on the coat rack next to Sherlock's, looking for a moment at how pathetic the cheap material looked next to a coat that most likely cost over one thousand pounds.
Sherlock would also have Jim accompany him to social functions, but what Sherlock hadn't know was that Jim was an ambitious young man intent on doing what he had to to get what he wanted. Sherlock had caught on to it eventually, though it was much too late by then. Jim was networking at the events, using his clout with Sherlock to establish contacts and when all was said and done, Jim had taken many of Sherlock's clients when he’d started up his own company. He’d even had the nerve to show up at Sherlock's flat afterwards, thinking that they could continue like before.
He watched as John turned his head to listen, only the side of his face and the narrowed corner of his eye visible from Sherlock’s vantage point.
It was really a no-brainer. Give them what he found, and John wouldn't get the shite kicked out of him that night, and if he was lucky, the next night, too. Really, though, John hadn't had a meal all day, and he was starving. Before he could restrain himself, his head was shaking vigorously in the negative. He certainly would not be giving up his food to these three lowlife berks; not when he'd seen this lot sitting in McDonald's happily snacking on Quarter Pounders, not thirty minutes prior.
At noon, Janine allotted John an hour lunch, which he was supremely relieved to take. All the new information he'd learnt was giving him a migraine.
Sherlock kept his eyes fixed to the back of her blonde head, more for the sake of his libidinous thoughts than anything else. They emerged in the warmly lit corridor, taking a different route than the one Sherlock had taken to get to the parlour. The way took them through the densely packed backstage where the entertainers prepared for their sets, most scrambling to don their costumes and others casting the two of them curious looks from the reflection of their vanities as they passed.
Sebastian didn't have to do anything as tawdry as draw a gun to command compliance, but Jim relished the surprise on Puppy's face when he noticed the weapon in Sebastian’s waistband.
The noises that left him were embarrassingly high pitched, but John didn't care enough to stop them from sounding out, because Sherlock was turning him inside out.
They were moving as one, John pressing up to meet him and Sherlock stroking down as the momentum built. John had set everything aflame, and heat pooled to the very bottom of his belly until his toes curled in his shoes. Every bone in his body tensed, balanced on the precipice.
Sherlock smoothed a hand down his flank, breath hitching at a flex of muscles beneath velvety, hairless skin. The crest of his hipbone cut a sharp angle against Sherlock's palm. He shuddered as John so subtly arched into the touch. He felt electrified, having John here at his mercy like this, so open for him.
For a moment, John sat there rubbing his wrist, unsure what to say or do. On the one hand, guilt plagued him like a virus, and John thought that he might just deserve never sharing a bed with Sherlock again, to have kept something so important to himself because there was a chance that the sex might just be mind blowing. Not only that but Sherlock had trusted him enough to share his body with John, to make himself vulnerable in ways he was obviously not comfortable with. And John had taken, knowing that he had a secret that could ruin it all. On the other hand, John felt bitter rage pooling in his gut.
As she was lowered on her swing, wispy white clouds of fog surrounded her, like a goddess descending.
John knew what was coming next, yet he still found himself startled by the feeling of a blunt head pressed against his opening.
Sally rolled her eyes muttering under her breath as she turned on her heel, tossing the torch to the man who caught it with deft hands. "Yeah, like he's going to fall for that shite."
John turned over in bed, and pulled the sheet over his head, unable or unsure, he wasn't quite sure which yet, to wake up and face the day. His encounter with Holmes had been intense, and now he wasn't sure what to think about his strange, new employer. What exactly did Holmes want from him, and what made John so special?
John made his way back into the lounge, where Sherlock was pacing in the middle of the room, his hair a bit on the frantic side. “John, we must leave immediately if we want to get a head start. Based on our run-in with the hunters recently, they can't be far from this locale.”
John groaned, pushing his pelvis forward, and though he was too short to be groin-to-groin with Sherlock, the sensation of such intimate contact was nothing short of exquisite. A hardness was pressing obscenely against his belly, through the flimsy barrier of thin silk pyjama pants.
The quick glance in Sherlock's direction alerted him to the fact that Mycroft was on the other end of the line, and Sherlock didn't
Sherlock waited until he heard John’s footsteps on the staircase before checking to make sure the hob was clicked off.
John didn't waste time initiating the kiss as he slid forward on mile long thighs and pressed his groin against Sherlock's. The man moaned against his lips, a throaty, beautiful sound that made John want to work all the more harder to hear it. Sherlock's hands slid past the waistband, and beneath his pants, cupping his arse as John ground his hips down to meet the hardness beneath him.
Murray hesitated for a long second, then nodded. “Alright,” he said in a placating tone, “no need to get tetchy.”
Since he left, John had only written home to his family once and had never heard back. Sure he missed his mum and Harry, but he’d been at the end of his tether with them towards the conclusion of his time in London, so John didn't wonder for long.
“Good, now that the pleasantries are out of the way, we will talk about this like the sensible adults that we are, are we clear on that matter?” Mycroft did so hate to be the only rational adult in the room, but these things couldn't be helped. “Excellent,” he stated when they both conceded reluctantly. “Now Jasper, talk to your father.”
know we’re in a church, and what their thoughts on homosexual relations are?” he said, shaking his head in wonder. Well, that was only partially true. Since John's younger days, some churches had changed their views, but he’d be hard pressed to find many that were openly accepting of the LGBT community. For his part, Sherlock didn't seem to care about the technicalities one way or another.
Sherlock returned with a soft "hm," and continued his perusal of the cupboard. "Have you ever played with nipple clamps before, John?"
Sherlock smiled, something that could be striking if John didn't see the feral wolf that peeked out at him from behind blue eyes and gleaming teeth. "You could be."
"Sherlock, we don't know how many hunter are in this branch, or if there's just the one that's tracking us," John rationalized, trying to talk some sense into the foolish man, but Sherlock's eyes gleamed darkly under the moonlight. He was far past convincing otherwise.
An hour later saw them all fit to burst, and taking tea in the sitting room. The dinner had been delightful, and his mum had, indeed, made several of John's favorite dishes.
The emotions behind those eyes were constantly shifting, despite Sherlock's automaton appearance. John didn't squirm beneath that scrutinizing gaze, merely stared back, beseeching with his eyes, for Sherlock to change his mind. John didn't want to be responsible for this death. He already had too much blood on his hands; he was drowning in it.
“Puppy, Sebastian Moran. Sebastian Moran, Puppy,” Jim introduced them jovially, reaching forward to set his teacup down on the floor by his feet. The floor was riddled with dust and scuffed by the furniture. Sherlock really should take better care of his possessions.
Sherlock stormed down the hallway looking for all the world like an avenging angel. He hadn't bothered to put on a top, and Sherlock wore just his silk robe and pyjama bottoms. John tried to look anywhere but that lovely, lean torso with miles of revealed wintry skin.
' John wondered, curiosity thoroughly piqued, as well as mortified at the thought of what he might possibly see when his vision finally cleared.
Unsurprisingly, it was Barts they pulled up to shortly thereafter. Even then, Sherlock felt that inexplicable pull in his abdomen, that acute pain whenever he thought of his final moment with John before his three year sojourn across the world to take down Moriarty's vast network.
indecipherable pronounced like a knot at the base of his throat. All he could do was stare, at a loss for words in a way he found only John could make him be.
Sherlock hung up, foregoing a parting reply. He saved the photo to his phone, unable to take his eyes off of it. The first glimpse of John in six years.
Jasper stopped quickly to raise the man’s wrist and check for a pulse. It was customary to do now, after a brief stint in which his father had relapsed. After an intervention from Uncle Mycroft and Jasper’s grandparents, as well as several threats to remove Jasper from his care, the situation had been resolved, thankfully.
“Hey-,” Lestrade complained, gaping as Sherlock shut the door in his face. “This isn’t over, Sherlock. And remember, you’re due at the Yard, anyway!”
John had all but abandoned his reverential position for something more defensive, because was he in a confessional or a bloody psychic booth?
Sherlock huffed. “What I mean to say, John, is that... that I do. I do love you.” His heart was in his throat, a fast-paced thrum that made his breath stutter through his nose.
Julian sat up, befuddled, but acquiesced to Sherlock’s demands. Still, he watched Sherlock with surprise and wariness. “What—”
Sherlock had purposefully hired him for the mere fact that he looked nothing like John Watson. Dark hair and green eyes, perfectly straight teeth, fashion-forward and not a hair out of place. Dreadfully ordinary and not a secret to be uncovered. Sherlock sighed, and immediately, all eyes were on him.
At times, Sherlock found himself peering out of his office windows at the swarm of activity in the district, humans about as big as worker ants from his vantage point, and just as singular in their thought processes as their aptitude for observation.
The flashlight fumbles and catches on the shocked face of Molly Hooper. Fortunately, she is blinded by the light, and Sherlock uses this temporary distraction to his advantage and flees on swift feet.
Either way, Moriarty would have gotten what he wanted, and Sherlock would suffer in both situations. Ashamed, John excused himself from the table and retired to his old room, exhausted.
“Do you still feel it, sometimes?” Sherlock wondered aloud. Seven years was enough time to heal, but he was no stranger to the concept of phantom pain or nerve damage.
Sherlock's voice was a rumble of thunder against his cheek as he spoke. “I've never had a John worth writing to before now,” he answered, his arms tightening around John's shoulders before loosening.
Sarah had sprawled herself over John's bedspread, reading excerpts from an old medical text, while she lounged leisurely on her stomach. Her head, propped up by her palms, only tilted towards John in a casual acknowledgment.
The first taste was nothing like he'd expected; the pre-come was bitter and salty, and the smell, poignant and thick from such close proximity. John licked the top with a curious tongue, using one hand to push the foreskin up to the base. Sherlock's cock was long, like the rest of his body, of average girth, and filled John's mouth with sweet succulency when he leaned forward to take more of him inside.
John frowned in bemusement. "Are you offering me a job?" John couldn't keep up with the bewildering man. One moment he was insulting John’s intelligence, and the next, Holmes was offering him a job.
John dropped his hands and ran a hand through his yet-to-be tamed hair, and eyed his best friend shrewdly. "Why are you even doing all of this Sarah? You're going to make me late!"
"So, the two of you are getting on, then," Mike asked, though the look in his calm, blue eyes was knowing and soft with amusement.
John was grinding on his finger, pushing up against Sherlock’s engorged cock with every needy thrust.
By the time Sherlock retreated for the last time, John was a sweating, quivering mass of flesh beneath him, boneless and open like a bitch in heat.
“Ooh, well aren't you lovely,” Jim said drily over the rim of his teacup. He settled more comfortably into the chair, wiggling his bum just to see Puppy’s eyes tighten. “Oh, where are my manners. Please, sit. You're making me feel short,” he ordered, gesturing to the red chair across from his. This game of wits was so much better with Sherlock, and John was just… nothing.
Mina had wanted more time than Greg was capable of sparing, so it ended there on the brink of the last semester. Sherlock and John's odd relationship didn't help much, and whenever Mina saw them together, she would become timid and quiet.
“It means if you aren't planning to forgive him, you shouldn't give him hope,” Sherlock said calmly, unperturbed by Jasper's anger. “If you planned to forgive him, you would have come with me to see him off, especially knowing that it's likely the last time you will ever see him.”
Janine sighed heavily and stood with her monstrous stack of files, preparing to face the fire-breathing dragon in the next room. "Mr Holmes is in a strop. One of his lovely moods you'll come to be well acquainted with." Janine hefted the pile of papers higher up into her arms, and seeing her struggle, John jumped up to relieve her of her load.
The shared shower found the blond crowded in a corner, the taller man looming over him, laying gentle kisses on his lips that had John melting into him. Everything about the man was intoxicating, and John found himself indulging like a glutton. Things never progressed past brief swipes of hands over sensitive places and a healthy amount of snogging.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively before he turned to the hallway, calling over his shoulder. "Don't be boring, John, I like you much more when you're not saying stupid things."
John scratched the back of his head, wondering how to tell his friend about his flirtatious conversation with his boss. "I don't know, Sarah. I-I think we -... I think Holmes and I have been... flirting?"
John rammed his hands against Sherlock's chest, furious, yet his eyes were dilated. “Sherlock! What the hell are you on about?”
Death was permanent, which meant John would never come back, which meant a world without John in any form.
On the other side of the clearing, Sherlock propelled his large body off the chest of a hunter attempting to throw a large net over the alpha. John could hear the crunch of his sternum at the impact, and the scent of the blood that spewed from the man's mouth. In the same breath, and with a terrifying speed John had never before encountered, Sherlock landed on a downed man and clamped his jaw punishingly over his throat and pulled, nearly detaching the head from the body.
“Very good, John, remembering after all this time,” Sherlock said, couldn't quite keep the condescending bite out of it, the bitterness, but he did his best. “I think you deserve a reward.”
John's heart was pounding almost as loud as the alarm bells in his head, and he tightened his grip on the stem of the glass, resisting the urge to push the man away from Sherlock.
When he opened his mouth, the white haired hunter spoke with a thick scottish dialect. "I 'in't bowin' for no feckin' dogs, so feck off, you sorry sacks of shi-," John hadn't even seen him move, but there he was; quick, deadly, and most of all, a demonic hound. Sherlock's muzzle dripped crimson as he stood over the hunter, a trail of innards hanging from his snarling lips. The man was barely alive, staring at his own insides between the mouth of Cerberus. It would be the last image that hunter would see before passing through the pearly gates, of that, John was sure. Sherlock dropped it on his terror-stricken face and left him to die, stalking over to the next man, who was swearing loudly as his comrade bled out into the dirt.
Through the haze, John noticed that it was a neat bedroom with a large bed that looked like heaven to sleep on. Sherlock was trading his trousers for silk pyjama pants, and John just barely caught the swell of a buttocks before the top came to settle upon sculpted hipbones. Beneath the unbuttoned shirt was a white tee, so there was nothing to see, there. The thought nearly made John cry like a baby.
Sherlock was lying supine on the couch, his fingers steepled beneath his chin while John crawled around the flat floor, playing with a horrifically unrealistic baby blue rabbit Mrs Hudson had bought for him. John seemed to enjoy it, going by the giggles and claps coming from the floor, so Sherlock allowed it to continue to exist. He hadn't run a good experiment in days, so the bunny should count itself fortunate.
a surprise was the absolutely scathing glare Sherlock shot John once he'd caught a glimpse of his cozy snuggle on the couch with Sarah. It was completely opposite of what it looked like, and not the first time they'd slumped on the couch together in that same fashion, but for some reason, John felt as if he'd been caught red-handed.
Slowly, Sherlock turned red-rimmed, glassy eyes on Lestrade, distant and blurry. "Förstner injected John in the jugular vein. I don't know what was in the syringe. We have to test it as soon as possible."
John arched to meet him, straining against the ties briefly before Sherlock settled a staying hand on his back. “Down, John,” Sherlock reprimanded. “You know better.”
He knew the planes of John's body by rote, and years hadn't diminished the memory of what made his lovely boy gasp and writhe. Like habit, John's legs fell open for him and Sherlock settled between them, at home and finally in familiar terrain. Men could look like John Watson, share his attributes, but none could inflame him like his errant lover.
All the anger had fled from Sherlock's eyes, replaced by the curiosity, the need to know. All that stood between John and the door was Sherlock's addiction to knowledge.
John’s skin prickled, sensing eyes on him, and he looked up at Jasper curiously, except Jasper was staring at something over his shoulder.
John wasn't much better. Greg sensed co-dependency, and he found that he wouldn't be surprised at all if this was the case. The two were rarely without one another, and God forbid John picked up a bird for the night and didn't return to the flat. Sherlock would keep Greg awake all night waging war on his violin.
It was a repugnant threat, but the thick silence on Mycroft’s end let Sherlock know that it worked as he hoped it would. It was manipulative and hateful, but Sherlock wasn’t above using whatever he could to repel Mycroft until he gave in. He knew what John leaving had cost Sherlock. If there was a chance that his former lover being back in London would keep him from living recklessly, then it would be counterintuitive for Mycroft to stand in the way.
John was getting closer, and Sherlock's hips were slamming into him now, causing his breath to hitch in his throat with every rough motion. His hips were grinding sinfully, rotating in a lustful dance that left John breathless and panting.
Back at the den, the pack split off to clean and ready themselves for the day. John was thankful when Lestrade brought him another set of clothes to wear, and though they were a little long on him, it felt good to change out of the ones he'd slept in. The hot shower eased the tension from his aching limbs and allowed John the tranquility to think of the last hour spent running with the pack.
John thought back to the jagged bones and the consuming darkness; Sherlock's omniscient glowing glare piercing through him. "Yes, thank you," he lied, "like a baby."
Sherlock stepped closer, his hands trembling beneath wool of his coat, his eyes growing wide as he came to stand before the infant who stared back in awed curiosity. Cobalt eyes, the color of a turbulent sea in the midst of a storm and there was no mistaking the Watson nose, the upturn at the tip.
He'd stayed up all night studying for final exams and writing long, boring papers about topics he couldn't give two shits about. Just when John had finally fallen off to sleep, his flatmate decided it was a good time to give him a ring.
Sherlock cleared his throat and twiddled with the hand of the cup, staring down into the milky liquid with something like apprehension. “John was–
Sherlock sniffed, debating whether to ignore the question. He should be the one getting answers, he thought in indignation. After all, Sherlock had always been in London; he wasn’t the one who ran without a parting word. No contact for six years. It all made him more than a bit sour.
John felt the happiest he had been in a very long time, and eventually he found himself falling into a light doze.
Irene looked between them, and Sherlock stared back at her intrepidly. Finally she rolled her eyes and threw her hands up. “For heaven’s sake, fine! Five minutes, John, then we’ll be having a chat.”
At around noon, the telltale signs of light steps and creaking wood alerted Sherlock to a new presence ascending to the flat.
Sarah snapped her text closed and rolled to her side, resting her weight on her elbow as she regarded John with a sceptical eyebrow at his fashion choice for the day. John tried not to stare at the way her cleavage pressed together when she sat that way; they were only friends, but he was still a man, after all.
So deep in thought was he, that John nearly missed the Jaguar XJ gliding silently on the street, slowed to an unhurried speed to match his pace. At first, he ignored it, and continued forward, thoughts on what he would make for dinner, or whether he should just snag something for himself, seeing as Sherlock's nightly schedule was unpredictable.
"Tell me," John bit out on the edge of a gasp as Sherlock's fingers skirted around the rim of his arsehole. "Tell me what you did." He wanted to know the things Sherlock dreamed of doing to him, what levels of depravity he could lower the man to. When Sherlock hesitated, John repeated himself, but with an urgency that wasn't there before. He needed to know.
Supple lips drifted down John's Adams Apple, to the sweat gathering at his suprasternal notch, where a wet tongue dipped in greedily.
His chest was weighted with sentiment he loathed to carry and unusually numb. John should have been his, should have trusted him. Why couldn't Sherlock stay away? Any man with a modicum of intelligence would heed the signs that screamed ‘Beware!’. Once burned, one does not set out to repeat the same mistakes, and yet…
John’s head was pillowed into the crook of his arm, blond strands lit up like honey from the ambient street lights.
The words were scathing, but the man didn't even blink, as if this were a daily occurrence. John wondered idly why there was so much animosity between the brothers, but then he remembered Sherlock stating that Mycroft was incapable of minding his own business.
Cafe Rouge wasn't very far from Mike and his shared flat, just a ten minute walk, and not a penny wasted on a cab or the Tube, much to John's delight.
Sherlock's eyes flit around like a mockingbird, taking in every single detail of the moment. Those pale, opalescent eyes followed the rise and fall of John's chest as his breathing picked up; the subtle drive of the blond's hips, a silent plea for friction; the swell of John's lips where Sherlock's made an impression; the pale skin of his thighs, splayed open in a bold invitation. Sherlock's eyes were dark now, almost completely eclipsed by his dilated pupils, as he absorbed the scene before him.
John exhaled a shaky breath but wasted no time in getting Sherlock’s trousers undone and pulling his pants back until his cock sprang free.
For the majority of Sherlock's teenage and adult life, he'd considered sex a tedious, but useful vice to sway others into giving him what he wanted, when he wanted it. Sex was a tool that could be used to manipulate and bend a situation to his advantage.
John rubbed at his forehead nervously with his index finger, avoiding Sherlock's - stupid - smug face, and heaved one last sigh of defiance. “Do I at least have time to get a haircut?”
Sherlock returned to trailing the smooth, chilly tip of the riding crop down John's leg, over the side of his calf and meandered down to the sole of John's foot. Sherlock's eyes followed the movement, leaving John to shiver amidst the chills his pale gaze provoked. "I received the call in my office and instructed my detail to standby because Moriarty is too clever to snatch you up from Baker Street in broad daylight. As much as others look at you and see a boy, I know better than to underestimate you, and I'm confident that Moriarty knew the same. So I allowed his little game in the hopes that you would report to me immediately after his departure." Sherlock dug the crop into his instep before continuing, his words tinged with a bitter inflection. "And you didn't."
“Touch me,” Sherlock whispered, and John's eyes sparkled with lust and something purely animalistic that drove Sherlock to annihilation. He wanted John's hands on him, wanted to feel what it was like to be touched without hatred or fear, wanted those inexperienced hands learning skills down his body. Wanted John's fumbling lips burning prints on his belly. And he wanted… he wanted John in a way he hadn't had a man in years.
John pulled back, biting back a moan at the sensation of Sherlock's body rubbing up obscenely against his own. Sherlock brought his hands to either side of John's face, directing his focus to him, and him, alone. "
“Hm…” John tapped his fingers on the knee of his trousers (an old pair of John's), and smiled cordially. “Tea?”
Sherlock sucked her bottom lip between his teeth, positive that he was getting lipstick on them, but it was irrelevant. Everything was irrelevant, except for the lady in his lap and her hot mouth on his.
The others follow suit, and the abrupt transition rattles John's bones painfully as he rushes the shift to keep pace with the alpha.
The heat rose up inside of him until it reached an unbearable climax, tearing out of him and into the air. His throat was raw with the sounds he was making, but John didn't care. Sherlock came undone watching him lose it, and his hips gave a few more sharp thrusts before he came with a deep, guttural moan, his come mixing with John's against their stomachs and conjoined erections.
No one slept well that night, and in the morning, not a bright-eyed Were remained. The prospect of imminent doom weighed heavily on everyone's mind.
Sherlock ground up against John, searching for relief, but John wasn't ready to give it to him. He didn't want this to be a quick shag, like it was when he had no choice but to sell his body. He wanted this to be a fuck he would never forget.
"I won't let him have you,"Sherlock whispered, arms coming up to secure a tight grip around John's waist. "Not you."
John nods, shoving his hands into the pockets of his trousers, looking anywhere but at Sherlock, who is, doubtless, waiting for his response. "I'm fine. Bit knackered, but nothing a quick kip won't clear out."
He pulled him close, the tears in John’s eyes finally spilling over the cup of his lower lids as he brought him forward to rest his head on his shoulder. John didn’t wail or sob, but Sherlock felt the entirety of his body tremble, the quiver of his breath wet on Sherlock’s neck. John hands held tightly to the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, before they slid up to grip his shoulders, shaking.
Jasper waved off John's modesty and laid his head sideways against the chair. "I'm knackered," he sighed, "and we have school in the morning."
The scrape of John’s stubble made Sherlock gasp with the utter need to possess. Sherlock wanted to suck him, fuck him, take John upstairs and play with him for hours on end. He could picture it perfectly, what John would look like in ropes now. A boundless spread of tanned skin and new musculature to explore, his hard, weeping cock in Sherlock’s fist, red-cheeked, eyes gone soft and doe-like.
John's eyes drifted beyond Sherlock's shoulder, remembering his delicate-boned friend, and Peter's bright laughter with fondness. Peter's father had been from Spain and a devout Catholic. He didn't believe that his son truly felt wrong in his own body. He’d put it down as mental illness and carted Peter away.
John turned and stared down into the water, cupping the liquid and watching it trickle between his fingers. Sherlock's arm was a comforting brace round him, careful to avoid pressure against his nipples.
Sherlock ignored him, already lighting up a cigarette at the window. It was a shame he couldn’t storm out of the room while Julian pulled himself together. That was the disadvantage of meeting outside of 221B. “Money is on the table. Get it and leave.”
John made a noise between a frustrated groan and a wheeze as he inhaled the scent of Sherlock's slick.
Sherlock could be possessive, and Greg was sure he was the reason for so many of John's failed relationships, and yet, Sherlock claimed that all of it was beneath him; no, he and John were not shagging, and no, he didn't conform to labels in regards to his sexuality. For all his posh tongue-wagging, Sherlock acted for all the world like a possessive berk and one of the most needy individuals Greg had ever come into acquaintance with.
Sherlock remembered stepping into the room, unable to take his eyes off the blond haired minx on the other side of it. The sunlight was spilling through the windows, setting fire to the crown of golden strands. John looked like an angel.
John buried his face in his hands, sure that he saw Sherlock slip in the door five minutes ago. He knew his partner wouldn’t bother him during rehearsal but it still made him nervous to know that Sherlock would be watching.
Jim didn't just stop with pharmaceuticals, Sherlock knew. Jim was greedy; he wanted all of London, but eventually, it would all catch up to him, Sherlock would make sure of it.
“Yes,” Molly breathed, her starry-eyes unwavering. Holmes, to his credit, didn’t blink twice at her blatant adoration. He merely raised a brow and cut his obscene stare back to John.
Suddenly, the man smiled much too wide for it to be anything natural. “I did so miss your biting wit. It made for great dirty talk in bed,” said Jim, stepping into Sherlock's space. Sherlock made no move to push him back.
Lestrade cleared his throat pointedly, from where he stood by the lift, rocking back onto the heels of his shoes with an indulgent grin. "If the two of you are quite finished, Sherlock, we need to get going."
When the last of John’s clothes hit the floor, that cobalt gaze, dark and bottomless, snapped up to meet his own, awaiting instructions. He stood differently now, straighter, chest puffed out and confident despite the ravages of war that played out in new scars and the wound spidering across the back of his shoulder. It was a stark contrast to the John he’d been greeted with only a couple of days ago, hunched and defeated. Further proof that this was as much John’s salvation as it was Sherlock’s.
"Would you like to hold him," asked Molly, shifting the infant in her arms to make it easier to transfer him to Sherlock.
"Are you ready," Holmes asked, already making to stand up, and John nodded in the affirmative, following the man outside.
Well, he thought, peering down at his erection through his pyjama pants, that wasn't going to go away on its own. So, Greg pushed away from the door and went for the lube.
Sherlock's hand was half hidden in shadow, but Greg could clearing see it moving between John's spread thighs. He was palming John through his pyjama pants, large pale hand rubbing greedily over John's crotch.
As Sherlock walked, people who recognized him cast curious glances from him to John, and the people that didn't merely ignored him and went about their daily affairs.
Sherlock whizzed around the room, packing a small, specialized bag that he could strap on his body, sturdy enough to hold on during the change. He wasn't taking much, only a few odd things here and there, but John only leaned against the wall and watched Sherlock work. Sherlock moved with an endless grace that John found enviable, flitting from place to place without tripping over a single thing, as if he could traverse this death trap with his eyes closed. John supposed he could, given their superior eyesight, and more than exceptional sense of smell. Maybe he also had a photographic memory. After all, Sherlock was unusually brilliant, what was eidetic memory on a list of extraordinary feats?
"Of course," Lestrade nodded, placing a hand on John's shoulder to steer him to a set of stairs leading further up into the house. Behind them, the whispers floated to his ears, unintelligible but hostile, none the less. John turned to see Victor kneeling beside Sherlock's chair, where the alpha had returned to reclaim his seat, lips almost touching the other man's ear as he spoke. Sherlock's legs were crossed, body leaning toward the blond, but his eyes tracked John's movements across the room. Those piercing eyes were the last thing John saw before he and Lestrade rounded the corner and were out of sight.
It was clear, Sherlock wanted him there, but the intimacy of sleeping with one another, without the added sex, was a boundary that they wouldn't be crossing. John wasn't sure whether to be relieved or angry. If he wanted to sleep alone, he could have stayed home.
John scrambled out the bed, flinching once his feet hit the cold wood. Luckily, there wasn't much vertigo, and he could walk on steady feet. Great, because John needed to find his clothes and his phone. Ugh, why didn't he just think sometimes!
When the tea was done, John put it on a tray along with three cups, sugar and a bit of milk before he took it to the living room and sat it down on the table. John poured his own cup, before getting comfortable in the chair with the plaid blanket thrown over it. Taking a sip, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling soothed by the taste. When he glanced up, two pairs of eyes were watching him expectantly.
“I gathered,” the man replied, holding out a steaming cup to John. “I thought you might like something other than roses.”
The trip to the room was blessedly short, and for a bloke who spent all day in his jim-jams watching Doctor Who, John was exhausted, mentally and physically. He was still a bit caught up on the tabloid mess, but that would have to wait for another day.
He pivoted mid-stride and nearly jumped out of his skin when he collided with Sherlock's muzzle. Wintry eyes watched him calmly, steadily, and maybe even seemed a bit curious.
As much as he loathed to admit it, Sherlock needed John. And despite what he’d said during the confrontation, Sherlock cared for him above all others.
Sherlock shrugged. “I nearly changed my mind on one instance. It was the Enfamil.” Sherlock smiled. John giggled and everything felt right again. Then he grew serious, his eyes growing sober as Sherlock held John's stare intensely. “If anything, your time away has only made me want you more.”
Sherlock hooked a hand beneath John’s knee and pushed it up as he thrust inside, setting a fast, punishing pace. Beneath him, John grunted with every sharp aim at his prostate, groaning Sherlock’s name until it became unintelligible. A sheen of sweat made his spine glisten, and Sherlock longed to lick him clean. God, this was his, John was his, and to see him like this, fucking him, it was glorious.
John zipped his denims and grabbed his pack, digging through it for his smelly coat. It was thick enough to protect his skin for the cold, smell notwithstanding. Maybe if he made enough money one night, he could purchase a new on-
Everyone is flustered and panicking, speaking excitedly across the table with one another, gearing up to form a search party for the little girl.
It didn’t matter, though, because in that small, dark pocket of the world, Sherlock turned his chin up towards him and gently pressed their lips together. This time, there was no shoving and pulling, tearing away clothes. Just the two of them and the soft pressure of their mouths joined in a simple union; a message conveyed: I am yours, and you are mine.
John's prick twitched where it lay on Sherlock's belly, weeping pre-come and untouched until Sherlock was ready for him to climax.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, weighing his words before he spoke, something that John got the feeling was unusual for a man like him, for whom speaking his thoughts as they came tended to be a primary reaction.
John smiled, the expression genuine for what seemed like the first time in forever. “God, I thought you’d never ask.”
Another waiter stopped by to take their orders and Sherlock gradually began to ask more questions about him. After a few minimal answers, John finally began to relax and talk about himself. Even in Lady Grey’s voice, the stories of his army days came to him easily, and soon he was slipping into John Watson without even noticing it.
When the cab finally pulled up at John's building, he quickly paid and jumped out, breathing in the cool night air as he jogged up the steps to his flat. No one was home to greet him when he walked in, though there were empty food wrappers on the table, along with a sink full of unwashed dishes.
"One minute, then I'm coming in!" John had no doubts the intrusive bastard would make good on that threat.
Sherlock smirked and tilted his head, his eyes unmoving where they locked onto John’s. John, mirrored the action, feeling the intent of that stare down to his cells. He’d never met anyone with such an oddly intense gaze.
Holmes had given him a lot to think about and not very much time to do it. John scrolled through his contacts until he found Mike's number, and opened up a thread.
for updates, excerpts and all things Sherlockian. Thank you so much for reading! I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Con-crit and feedback are always welcome.
Sherlock cleared his mind and continued, determined not to chase those thoughts lest he lose his appetite. “But just to make this clear, as long as you’re with me, there will be no one else.” He owned John. John was his and he’d be damned if some idiot returned home thinking they still had a claim on John.
Here he felt hollowed and emptied, and his feet were rooted like trees. Underfoot, John felt the sharp pain of brittle fragments cutting into the soles of his bare feet, and knew, without a doubt just as he held the knowledge that grass was green and Earth was a planet, that they were bones.
It was a thin-haired man in an expensive Gieves and Hawkes tailored three piece suit. The man's aquiline nose perched highly into the air as he surveyed John curiously for a moment in shrewd silence, before turning to the direction of the kitchen.
Sherlock stopped at the mantle, straightening the skull there, before placing one hand on his hip and the other on the ledge, drumming his nails against the wood. “I know what you think, John,” Sherlock began softly. “You think that I don't miss my son, when in fact I think of him more than you can possibly conceive.”
“Now you better give me a little taste. Put your icing on my cake, you nasty boy.” As the music picked up again, she swung around to clutch the back of the chair and bent over, swaying her arse sadistically.
Sighing, he flopped back onto the bed, feeling wrung like a dish towel, and wishing so desperately that the bed would turn into a sinkhole and swallow him up. "We snogged at the office last night."
John didn't remember much of what happened, besides the burning, ravishing pain in his shoulder, radiating out through his chest and back. He couldn't describe the feeling, because nothing had ever been so painful in his life.
The shower, before they left, was quiet and intimate. For the longest moment, Sherlock merely crowded him in the corner, his large hands splayed over John's waist as the water fell over them. John couldn't look away, and he could see in his eyes, that Sherlock didn't want him to.
Sherlock dislodged a hand from his waist and John found his head being tilted back, his thumb caressing John’s chin as if he were something delicate. “You shouldn’t hold it against them, John. Mundane people are often unobservant and I don’t expect them to realize when they have something extraordinary among them.” Sherlock paused with a quick hum, his eyes flicking over John’s face. “Though you play very well at being boring and ordinary, I find you anything but. Don’t ask me to pin it down; I couldn’t tell you exactly why you intrigue me even if I wanted to… You’re a puzzle.”
It felt as if every bond John had formed with his pack mates was being severed painfully and individually. He felt the loss of them all acutely.
Sherlock ran over it with his palm, circling a hand around his cock and sliding it down, then flattening his fingers as he smoothed the viscous liquid into the crack of John’s arse. He leant forward on one hand, and pushed the pad of one finger against John’s hole with the other as he leant down to take his lips captive again.
His fingers inside John’s snug arse made his cock strain, wantonly curved and rigid against John’s slick belly. Sherlock massaged the gland, pulling John closer with the motion, unoccupied fingers digging into the soft skin of his buttocks.
Sherlock cupped a hand around the nape of John’s neck, caressing up the side with his thumb. The skin there was still warm with his fading blush. John raised his head to meet his stare, pupils still dilated, irises the color of seawater during a storm, dark and murky. Sherlock smiled, his gaze flitting around John’s face, storing all the little signs of contentment and pleasure. John was beautiful when he was happy, and Sherlock vowed to do his best to keep him that way.
The nightlife here was rowdy and chaotic, a class of young rebels all set on ruining whatever future their parents wanted them to have, and John couldn't help but hate them a fraction more for it.
Holmes stood as well, all long, lean lines and corded muscles. “Good, because my number is already in your pocket.” Then, he winked, swung his robe on in a flurry, and was out the door quicker than John could say ‘Farewell’.
Neither of them said a word, and John turned back to finish preparing his tea, so Greg figured it was as good a time as any to disappear. They would work it out. They always did.
Sherlock opened his mouth to object, but Victor halted him with a raised hand. “I know you think you can handle it, Sherlock, but don’t let your pride get in the way of getting John help.”
"- one day he took me to one of those bars, you know, but of course I hadn't realized where we were going at the time. I tell you, I'd never seen seatless trousers before-"
Steeling himself, Sherlock made a beeline for Billy, grabbing the younger Omega by the scruff of his shirt and hauling him towards the door, intent on throwing the stubborn fool out. "Go home, Billy," he ordered tersely, unable to stomach another fertile Omega in the same vicinity as the Alpha that Sherlock planned on having in his bed in less than five minutes, if things went his way.
The day John's personalized wardrobe arrived, courtesy of Victor Trevor, happened to be the day in which Sherlock decided he would notify John of a gala they’d be attending that very same evening. Then, Sherlock proceeded to “inform” John that it was his duty as Sherlock's personal assistant, to attend “tedious social functions” so that he would not be bored by the “dullards” that usually participated such “pointless, pestilential tripe,” himself excluded, of course.
The doors slip open to reveal a posh office suite, all chrome and a startling amount of white. Behind another desk—ivory, but smaller and more sensible— sat a dark haired woman in a smart black dress that stopped at the knees, and kitten heels that showed off her lavender toenail polish. Her hair was pinned up in an elegant chignon and not a strand out of place. Lastly, simple silver stud earrings polished off her understated ensemble.
Irene was the first to brave the quiet man, extending a small, perfectly manicured hand, which was unceremoniously engulfed by Holmes’ own. “Irene Adler, proprietor of the cabaret. Pleased to meet you.”
This was John wanting to hear his voice, to be praised and wanted; commanded, and Sherlock was obliged to oblige him.
Damaged. Of course he was damaged, the fool. What had he been thinking, going to Afghanistan in the first place? There were other places he could have gone to get away from Sherlock, ones where he wouldn’t spend his time getting shot at.
Holmes sat up straighter, a slow smile lighting his eyes like twin bulbs. "You're getting warmer, John Watson, but you aren't ready."
"Ella, who's this stranger you've let into my home," he asked, chuckling as he stood to cross the room. His voice was deep and sonorous, amused but genteel.
John gestured to his own hair with a finger, referring to the tuft of hair that dangled perilously suspended over Sherlock's forehead.
“You should eat, John,” Sherlock commented offhandedly, not bothering to make eye contact with John. He'd only just taken a bite and swallowed, but his tongue lingered around the edges of the fork, licking away the remnants. He managed to make it look graceful when done by any other, it would have been crude. “You'll be needing your strength later.”
Holmes bent to whisper in his ear, his breath warm and teasing over John’s skin. “You were marvelous. Perhaps we can discuss future collaborations over dinner, if you’re amenable.”
The absence of both her daughter Harriet and John was crippling. There was never a day she didn’t devote hours to trailing back and forth between the shrines of her children’s rooms, thinking of a time when there were two giggling toddlers shouting through the walls. Guilt and longing ravaged her insides and kept her mind near constantly preoccupied. She could think of little else but her children.
He sneered, kicking his shoes off, and turned sharply to recline facing the back of the couch, legs drawn up to his chest. John’s state of mind shouldn’t even be his concern. John had made up his mind on his own to do something so foolish as run away to join the army. Whatever was happening with John was no longer Sherlock’s problem.
After having passed out from sheer exhaustion and the overwhelming sensations of having Sherlock Holmes fuck him into oblivion, he'd woken up to an empty flat and nearly a
John could hear Sherlock talking to someone away from the phone, muffled, though his tone was unmistakably sharp and urgent. When he returned the phone to his ear, Sherlock didn't sound pleased at all. "John, don't you dare pass out. Stay where you are; I'll be there shortly."
In the middle of the room, there was a large, four-poster canopy bed that nearly filled the space completely. It was stately and intimidating, and blatantly sensual. The frame was solid wood with a dark chestnut finish, engraved with swirling patterns of spiraling vines and thorny flowers, polished and embossed. It was beautiful and almost sinister, with the dark color of the indigo sheets, and the sheer black curtains tied to the posts.
In the bedroom, they stretched languidly over the duvet as John recalled more than he had earlier in the day. He was beginning to remember the last case.
“From a Mr Mortimer Tregennis in Cornwall. He claims he played a game of Poker with a group of siblings - a woman and her two brothers. When he returned later in the day, the sister was dead while the brothers allegedly laughed hysterically and continued to play cards.”
With that, the man nodded his head once. “Good day.” Then he was suavely sliding out the front door.
"Do what you want, Lestrade. He will be your problem for the duration of his time here," the dark haired man snapped. He paused and turned to John, eyes hardening into threatening crystals. "As for you," he stalked forward, backing John into the water stained wall, "Don't think that I will not be watching your every move. You saw what I did to the hunters, and you know what I'm capable of doing to protect my pack."
He was horrified. That was the wolf he’d entrusted his life to, and one who sought to mate with him. A man-eater. A monster.
The velvet curtains of the stage slid apart to reveal the shadowy figures of dancers posed behind glowing blue screens. Lady Grey zipped around the room on her chariot, her head thrown back in euphoria. The lyrics started up again as she was lowered to the stage. She kicked her leg forward and strode across the stage and down the steps, where a man held his hand out to help her down.
John was so close, Sherlock could feel his cock getting harder in his hand with every slap of Sherlock’s balls to his arse, every twist of his fingers, every nudge to his prostate. Nothing was left untouched, nothing left sacred.
The moment ended with a purposeful clearing of the throat from Mary, and John reluctantly pulled his gaze away from the striking newcomer. He smiled genially at the costumed woman and hitched his pack further up on a bony shoulder, feeling a mite better than he had when he'd come in. "Ta, Mary, you've been wonderful. Merry Christmas."
Now, I know this is going a bit slow, but I promise, everything is building up to certain points. Please, be patient with me. A few things for this chapter: I used a few terms or references that might be confusing to some.
The giggles morphed into groans as John stroked a lubricated hand down Sherlock’s prick. Sherlock retrieved the packet from where it sat on John’s thigh and squeezed some onto his fingers. With their position, he had to recline on his elbow to reach behind John. Skilled digits gently breached his opening and John couldn’t stay his hips from moving, hoping they’d go deeper and find that spot that made his balls tighten.
John smiled, though he felt sombre and empty at the thought of his inevitable departure. "I don't think I've ever had this much excitement in my life, before."
Irene sat on the piano, laughing as the others badgered him to perform their new favourite set of his outside of his persona. “Get up their and shake your arse, or I’m docking your pay,” she sniffed, picking imaginary lint from her red wrap dress. “Your gentleman is watching.” She tilted her head towards the dim room, and sure enough, Sherlock sat elegant and cross-legged at the table nearest the door.
The moment passed in a silence so still, John nearly coughed to penetrate it, Sherlock was quicker. "You're an idiot."
The pressure in his groin built and built, threatening to send him over the edge, and Sherlock could see that John’s hand was beneath his body, moving, and his cries were reaching a crescendo; Sherlock wanted to be there with him when it happened.
Sherlock leaned his head against the back of the chair as if he were exhausted. "According to Lestrade, I've managed to help them put away every small-time criminal in London. That, or they're getting smarter about covering their tracks, which is highly doubtful. The level of stupidity on their part is painfully appalling."
“Oh, so sorry,” Victor sniggered, crossing his arms. His smile suddenly dimmed and he swallowed, seeming unsure of himself for the first time. “One last thing…”
John stood back so that Sherlock could pass, and stuck his head out the door, peering around. The hall was conveniently empty and John could hear music in the grand room. He closed the door and turned to Sherlock.
- partake in for any of the foreseeable future. Relationships were time consuming and Sherlock only had time enough for the work.
No sooner than he was stepping out of the car, the front door was swung open gusto, and his mother was walking quickly towards him, blushing with excitement. "Oh my love, look at you! Still haven't grown an inch, short like your father, but you've grown so handsome!" John grimaced as she pulled him into a hold strong enough to obstruct his breathing. In his peripheral, John could see his father struggling not to cackle, so John turned and shot him an entreating glare.
Well, you all have been so amazing! Thank you so much for all the kudos, comments and bookmarks. Just so everyone is aware, I have started a tumblr page for my stories, where I will post update info and excerpts. If you think you might be interested, come follow me: http://lymphadei.tumblr.com/
Molly, who was already down to a Britney Spears get-up, complete with the pigtails and garish eyeshadow, perked up as Holmes strode past without a word to either she or John.
The cover dragged along his leg and sloughed off to the ground as he stood, stretching. The pop of his back was satisfying, and with a grunt, Sherlock rolled his shoulders to release the tension.
Suddenly, however, the grin faded along with his father's playful countenance. "You have to be diplomatic with these sort of things, son. Now I know it seems like a bit of a thrill now, but you have to think ahead. What kind of man is this, and what are his intentions?"
It had been two weeks since he'd met with Holmes over a luncheon that had gone straight to hell in less than ten minutes. That was a new record for John.
to do anything. Only to notify you that we are looking into the late Dr Förstner's past experiments and looking for a possible remedy for John. I... am not sure how long this could take, but until then, you will be responsible for his care. Of course, if you're not up to the task, I could arrange a nanny."
John gasped heavily as Sherlock's tongue circled the rim of his anus, eyelids lowered to half-mast as he observed John's reaction.
John was moaning loudly, freely, into the room until his voice was hoarse and worn. Above him, Sherlock was grunting, eyes squeezing shut as he came violently. The sight of it pushed John to the brink, and he cried out one last time as the orgasm he'd been dying for finally crashed through him with tremendous force.
When Holmes moved away, a bright pink mark bloomed where he'd sucked the skin between his sharp teeth.
"I mean wow," Mike smiled widely, folding his arms over his chest and hunkering down like he was going nowhere at all. John thought about closing the door in his face. "I mean, I didn't know you and John were... well, you know," Mike stammered.
Everybody knew he was Sherlock Holmes' son, and many refused to help him hide; they didn't think the trouble was worth it. Jasper's resources were dwindling, and the money he'd grabbed before Uncle Mycroft froze his accounts was nearly depleted.
Sherlock caressed his cheekbones with the pads of his thumbs, wistful touches that snatched the breath from his lungs.
“Angelo,” Sherlock returned graciously, before pulling his hand back and gesturing to John. “John, this is Angelo. Angelo, John.”
Greg was just nodding off with a belly full of good food and Molly on his mind when the front door opened earlier than expected. It wasn't even midnight, yet.
The embrace stretched on for several minutes before John broke away, turning to head to the shower, hoping he had at least an hour to get everything done before Jasper arrived.
Next to him, Sherlock shifted again in a jerky movement of limbs that alerted John that a tantrum was possibly imminent if Mike didn't stop pounding soon. Then he remembered that he hadn't told Mike about Sherlock, and his flatmate was actually home for once, and also, Sherlock was naked. In his bed. Oh, and the room smelled like sex.
John smiled, still feeling something in him go soft whenever he was around the young Holmes. "Hey, Jas..."
It was something different this time. Sherlock had wanted John and John wanted Sherlock, and soon enough Sherlock - with his brilliant mind - was lying supine on John's bed and leading him over with a hand. Sherlock pulled him up and over until his knees were weighing anchor on either side of his head, and John's groin was an imperfect arch over Sherlock's warm, lovely mouth. John’s attempts to reciprocate were fumbling and awkward, his mouth moving inelegantly around Sherlock's hardness as Sherlock rubbed clever fingers over the line of his perineum.
All of his senses felt heightened, not unlike the effects of cocaine when he needed the clarity, the focus. His phone was buzzing insistently where he’d left it.
John remained in bed throughout that day, his body shivering as the wound visibly grew infected and John called out names Sherlock didn't recognize. Mrs Hudson did what she could, providing fresh linen when John soaked the sheets with sweat and chicken soup when John was coherent enough to eat.
Julia pulled away and offered a tight smile as Rupert wiped away her tears with his calloused thumbs. His touch was familiar, grounding.
As they parked, Sherlock's phone began to vibrate again, and when he failed to pick up, Lestrade's followed suit.
Sherlock stood, also, and stepped forward until there was less than a foot of space between them. "I told you before, John, you agreed to this even as I warned you that nothing came before the Work. You knew and you agreed," Sherlock breathed furiously, reaching forward to grip John's wrist in a tight hold. John allowed this contact, but kept his eyes down and head angled away. If he looked up, if he stared into Sherlock's eyes, John would relent, and he didn't want to. "John, look at me."
Sherlock had taught John that inhibitions meant holding back, and John knew well the punishment for doing such a thing. Sherlock was a selfish man, willful and possessive. He wanted all of it, everything that John had to give, and Sherlock would happily lower himself to any means just to have him.
Then, the women were fading to the shadows as Lady Grey prowled forward, staring out into the audience with her compelling stare and immediately pulling the audience in as her lips moved with the words. She flicked her cigarette and placed herself before her partner, demanding his absolute attention. She threw her arms around the man’s neck and wrapped her calf around his waist until she leant against him for support.
Sherlock touched a trembling hand to his forehead. He was warm. "Yes, I'm- I'm fine. Let's continue."
Mycroft was staring at John with single-minded intensity, though Sherlock knew that he was also monitoring Sherlock's reaction.
Once they reached the top, Sherlock pulled a single key from his pocket, connected to a short, silver chain; a cautious insertion.
Jim threw his head back and laughed, though there was something malicious and facetious about it. “Oh, you know me, Sherlock. I'm busy as a bee! A little nectar here, a little nectar there, and then,” Jim snapped his thumb and middle finger together with a short, sharp pop, his eyes brightening viciously with the motion, “business is booming.”
Sherlock appeared again to take John’s coat, and hung it up next to his own on the rack by the door. Then, long arms were winding around his waist and entwining their hands together until they crossed to wrap around John’s torso. With a tilt, his neck was exposed, and Sherlock’s moist lips were catching against the soft skin of his throat. John could feel the hardness of Sherlock’s erection through the organza of his costume. Irene would surely skin him for wearing it outside of the cabaret, but in the heat of the moment, he’d only grabbed his coat as they made a hasty exit.
John retired to his room shortly after, feeling considerably lighter than he had before. Sarah wouldn't mind if he took a shower before he replied, so he did this in a leisurely fashion, relaxed for the first time that day.
Sherlock leaned forward and captured him, plunging through the gap in John's lips and plundering his mouth and every little thought along with it. It was sloppy and passionate, possessive and everything about Sherlock that John couldn't get enough of. “Yes, yesyesyesyes,” Sherlock chanted as he pulled away, his hand still tangled in John's hair. “Everything, I want everything, John. All of it. Give it to me, come on.”
In the matter of a second, John was six years younger again, eager to please him and receptive in a way that should have been illegal. Sherlock had never been capable of saying no to that John, and the same still applied to the new one.
“Mm,” Sherlock groaned low in his throat as he pulled the scarf from around his throat. Strong, pale thighs spread wide for him, and in between that, a reddened cock Sherlock wanted to run his tongue over. He wanted to push him back and glide over him, grind into him.
Fortunately, he was fine by Monday and the next two weeks flew by without a hitch. The second week, Sherlock hadn't turned up in John's bedroom, and it wasn't until he’d been burrowing into his pillow in exhaust, dreadfully alone, that his phone beeped with a text. It was Sherlock, notifying him that he was on a case, which John roughly translated to Sherlock forcefully inserting himself into a crime scene with the Met.
With a sigh, Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket and unlocked it to open a new thread in his text messages.
He smirked, and then Lady Grey was standing between his legs, one knee on his thigh and her hands in his hair, tilting his head up for a sinful kiss.
Molly came up beside him, throwing her arms around John's neck with enough force to knock John a bit off balance. When he was steady again, John gripped her back in a tight embrace. Though he hadn't known her for very long, Molly had been very sweet to John during his stay, something he'd miss. “We'll see you again, right, John,” Molly whispered, a quiet question that made his throat feel thick. John didn't know what to say, stuck between honesty and a white lie. Would he come back with Sherlock if they survived? Did he want to?
"John," the other boy said warily, green eyes taking in the bruises on his jaw and neck, as well as the split lip. It wasn't as severe as the night before, but the damage still stood out starkly against John's skin, impossible not to notice.
John turned when Sherlock failed to respond with one of his signature quick-witted quips, and stopped, startled by the intensity of Sherlock’s stare.
Holmes didn't notice him until John came to stand uncomfortably next to the table, at which point, the man's long, thin fingers paused their movement. The owner of said appendages looked up slowly, features laden in pure annoyance.
Sherlock nodded and sat back, pulling John into his lap. It was meant to be dismissive, but Mycroft lingered a little longer, just as captivated by John Watson as Sherlock.
It was late when Sherlock returned home, his cheeks red and stiff from the cold and his curls windblown. He felt exhilarated and in his veins, his blood sang for more; more of John, always more of London and its layered depths. For the last few hours, Sherlock had dragged them around London, over rooftops, through alleyways, underground tunnels and places John had never been before. Sherlock wanted John to miss London, he wanted John to want to come back after the excitement of a war, and most of all, Sherlock wanted John to think of him.
Sherlock could see his cock down the flat plain of his belly, painfully hard and ruddy. He wanted to feel it against his leg, wanted to see John getting himself off on his thousand pound trousers, because he deserved only the best to spill his seed upon. But a certain someone would kill him, and Sherlock would rather save that for another time. He’d see about getting John taken care of in a way just as satisfying.
John moaned at the praise, allowing Sherlock to manhandle his head back to where he wanted it, a large hand fisted in his hair.
This had the potential to become very messy if things didn't play out smoothly between them, and John needed the work. He needed to be able to pay his own way when he moved with Mike to the new flat.
“Yes, well, this is where I live,” John said, avoiding his eyes as he stuffed his hands in his pockets. They stared at one another for several long seconds, before John finally cracked. “How's Jas?”
Sarah marched over to John's closet with steadfast determination. Jesus, he could already feel the migraine coming on.
"I beg your pardon," John asked, offended. His back straightened in his chair, pulse racing as he bristled.
Sherlock nodded, unsure what else to say. He wasn't sure what to tell Jasper. He hated the feeling of walking on eggs with his son, but John was now a sore subject for the both of them, and Sherlock was inexperienced at navigating sensitive matters.
“At dinner, when you got out your wallet to pay, I noticed several cards from letting agents stuffed in between the folds. That one was blindingly obvious. And I don’t think I really need to tell you how I know you don’t enjoy sex with insipid women who wouldn’t know how to give you a proper orgasm even if you wrote an instruction manual on it in large, plain font.”
John's hands were pulling uselessly at his restraints, just to get a little taste of that flesh; he wanted to touch, but Sherlock was relentless in his assault. John could imagine himself in the position he was in, Sherlock's body between his hitched up thighs, the very picture of hedonism. Bright cheeks and silk-covered eyes, Sherlock's warm lips tracing patterns down the line of his stomach.
Sherlock cupped the back of her thighs and dragged her closer, opening his mouth to allow her tongue inside. She slipped her thighs over his, and Sherlock pulled her close until her arse was firmly sitting on his erection. The softness of Lady Grey's padded arse was unusual, but lovely and welcomed. After all, Sherlock wasn't there for authenticity; a woman's derriére and breasts never stimulated him, but this was different. He was all too happy to lose himself in those narrow cobalt eyes and hold her square jaw as he plundered her mouth. Sherlock ached to snap away those garters and run his hands beneath Lady Grey's lacey knickers and touch her rigid cock.
John stood on his toes and planted another kiss on Sherlock’s lips, this one longer than before, and he didn’t move away immediately. Sherlock’s hand was on his waist again, carefully pulling him closer, until they were chest-to-chest. “Oh? And what do you consider an ideal location?”
The thought of seeing Sherlock again made his stomach turn. What would he say? The way he left, it hadn’t been on good terms, and in a way, he regretted the decision to swan off to the army without saying a goodbye. How could he expect Sherlock to forgive him for that?
Molly, who'd been silently watching their reunion, spoke up hesitantly, loath to break up the moment. "He hasn't had anything to eat," she said, fidgeting nervously with her fingers. "I wasn't quite sure what to do with him."
John swiveled his head to the taller male in bewilderment, wondering if he was even bothering to take him seriously. "Yes,
Sherlock tilted his head, agreeing with John. “Not currently looking, either. Flatmates are tedious.” As he spoke, he drifted closer until they were chest to chest. “You’re nervous.”
Sherlock shifted on the other side of the screen, his eyes flicking from John's eyes, to his lips, and dragged back up, unhurriedly. “What kind of things did you do with these men, John?”
Sherlock cleared his throat as they turned to face one another. “I've something to give you,” he announced, reaching his long, slender hands into his pocket and producing a folded piece of paper. “Jasper asked me to deliver this to you.”
John crossed his arms and rocked back on his heels in self-satisfaction. “Don't act like you didn't get anything out of it. I know all about your military kink.”
“It’s neither here nor there, Jasper. Soon, he will be another part of your past and you will forget him altogether.” Jasper looked pained. Ah well, Mycroft was never any good at comforting words, but it was definitely a comfort to him that John Watson would no longer be a problem.
John couldn't look away from those sharp eyes, wondering if Sherlock could see all the hurt and anger, the truth and lies and the admiration he was currently feeling. "But you, John, you haven't asked for a thing and I could already see Jasper already on the edge of giving everything he has to you." Sherlock leaned closer, bow lips skirting slowly against the line of his jaw. "I know what you're doing to him, because I can feel it, too."
John regarded him suspiciously, wondering why the man wanted to know. He would be out of their hair soon, as if he were never there. John kept his lips sealed, at a loss of whether he should trust this man with that information or not.
So, great. Not only was Holmes a danger to his mental wellness, but apparently, he was also now detrimental to John's health.
Sherlock observed the interaction with a building sense of disquiet. Although John’s demeanor remained polite, where he was once open and friendly, he now shied away from casual conversation and regarded others with suspicion. Not altogether unusual for an army veteran, but John appeared overly cautious, as if Lestrade might do something unexpected at any moment. Which John didn’t have to worry about. Lestrade was the most predictable, mundane man ever to walk the face of the planet. In fact, Sherlock could predict that Lestrade was about to reach his threshold of discomfort and scold Sherlock for not answering his phone.
If he knew Sherlock, then that would make him suspicious, but John couldn't risk it. On the coffee table, there was a memento from Moriarty. John knew that he was meant to give it to Sherlock. He'd seen it earlier in the day, after Moriarty had slithered out of Baker Street and down the pavement, blending expertly in with every other walker. Sherlock would be angry.
His face was smooth and boyish; John hated it. Maybe if he was hideous, all the grimy lads wouldn't give him any shite, and he'd be able to carry on unbothered. Without the looks, however, he certainly wouldn't be able to pay for a decent meal here and there. It was just as much a curse as it was a blessing.
Sherlock threw himself up against the wall, the last corner that would lead to a dead-end. John followed suit as Sherlock's mind conjured up every possible outcome of their inevitable confrontation with the erstwhile scientist they'd been on the trail of for nearly a week.
He was tired of living in squalor. If he managed to find something decent, then he could look for new housing in a better location.
John was nearly driven insane by the itch tingling just beneath his skin. He craved the change, but the captive werewolf wouldn't dare transform while under the reluctant care of the unusual man he had encountered upon waking.
“So… we were together?” Sherlock nodded, staring at the clipping of them still held in his hands. “So does that make me… am I…?”
Sherlock leaned forward and John was thoroughly, completely, irrefutably captivated. He knew that there was something he was supposed to tell Sherlock, but at the moment, every thought fled in the face of temptation unlike anything John had ever experienced before, and Sherlock was baiting him.
The bruise on his jaw still smarted a bit and Sherlock had pointed out that he had a large, mottled discolouration that began at the middle of his left buttock and flared down to the top of his thigh.
But Bill was the sort who could be passive aggressive, though it was rare. He had a kind of controlled anger that hung around him like a cloak. Bill never took his anger out on anyone, but it simmered behind his eyes like so many shadows, only to be thrown down like a gauntlet whenever they clashed.
John could feel the growl building slowly in his throat, as if the wolf were ready to claw through him at any moment. While everything the man said was probably right, John was growing increasingly frustrated with the situation and all these threatening wolves stepping into his immediate space. His hands shook with the anger he was holding back. John hadn't known he was going to happen upon a den of secluded werewolves, it hadn't been anything he planned on doing, and now this man's whinging was prodding at his nerves.
Sherlock opened one eye, then two, and turned his head slightly to regard Jasper with wary eyes. Slowly, he sat up, swinging his feet off the couch and onto the rug.
He pressed down and a breath of air puffed past John's lips with a sound delicious enough to send Sherlock’s heart pounding and his libido soaring. He thrust again, just to catch that sweet sound in his mouth. Except that John felt so wonderful against him, tumescent cock prodding Sherlock's belly button, and Sherlock's massaging the outline of his balls. He gasped along with John until it hung in the moist air between their wet lips, thin and fragile.
John groaned. Just when he thought nothing ever happened to him, he had to go and be the nice guy, and do Mike a favor. Time had proven again and again, that a favor for Mike wasn't something that one could simply return from unscathed.
Had he been that once? John couldn’t remember. Yet, when was the last time he’d even gone anywhere other than home and the cabaret?
Sherlock could do nothing but hold his breath as John licked his lips, his nerves written all over his face as he prepared to speak. Finally, he said, “The noodles are congealing—”
There was nothing of Mike left but a picked off torso and a few phalanges; he could only tell by the cracked, twisted wire-rimmed specs that lay just next to him. Clara’s body wasn't even there anymore. Another spirit that would never find rest.
Sherlock’s fingers were beginning to cramp, his wrist twinging from the awkward position, but the way John was gasping against his mouth usurped any discomfort he may have felt. He pistoned his fingers in, nose dragging against John’s cheek as John turned away to draw in ragged breaths.
"Yoo hoo!" There was a knock at the door before it was pushed open, Mrs Hudson sidling through with a tray. "I brought you some food, dearie. Thought you might need it after a night with your little one. He seems like quite the active baby."
He was sure that the woman meant to be reassuring, but her attempt at mollification had the opposite effect. His insides quivered and his thoughts grew more irrational as John pondered his imminent encounter with the huge question mark that was Sherlock Holmes.
Smiling, though not at all amused, Sherlock leaned body against the door and craned his neck back casually, returning the stare from beneath lowered lids. "Obviously," he answered, but it lacked its usual bite, replaced by something base and depraved.
No sooner had Sherlock let Jasper up than the younger boy was jumping up and away from his father disgustedly. The younger Holmes paced back and forth like a caged tiger, one hand tangled in his hair until he stopped and said to neither of them in particular, "Well, I hope the two of you are very happy together." With that being said, Jasper turned on his heels and walked out the door, footsteps echoing loudly down the stairs, followed by the finality of a slammed door.
“John,” Sherlock groaned, his voice faint from between John's legs, and John increased his pace, eager to please. His saliva eased the way, falling over his fingers as he momentarily dipped his tongue in Sherlock's urethra, tasting the salt of pre-come there. “Yes, that's lovely, John.”
Janine smiled in reassurance and waved John over to her desk. This close he could smell her fragrant perfume wash over him in waves of jasmine and an undertone of ginger, maybe. "Mr Holmes is out for a meeting, so I'm to explain what will be expected of you and show you round."
He could see John’s shoulder already relaxing as he handed over the reigns of his control to Sherlock.
“I can’t make up for Harry’s absence.” John paused to clear his throat, but his voice remained brittle when he spoke. “I was never going to be able to live up to that.”
Another finger joined the first and John rode Sherlock’s hand, whimpering in a way that he never thought would come from him.
John let himself into the kitchen and pulled Irene’s tin of tea bags from the top shelf, choosing one of her less gaudy mugs to set aside on the counter. He filled the electric kettle with water and turned it on, then sat back against the counter with his arms folded over his chest.
Sherlock heaved the most put upon sigh in the history of burdened individuals, and pulled John by the arm, up one step at a time. "Don't be ridiculous, John. You're going to sleep off this ridiculous inebriation, and then we'll talk about how I don't tolerate thoughtless fools coming to work insensible from a hangover."
Sally was next to him now, tan fur stained red with blood and bits of flesh. The black stripe that traveled down her back was dark and matted, concealing a wound that John could smell from where he stood.
Sherlock froze, his eyes widening slightly as he looked at the younger John. If there were any doubts about the young man’s identity before (which there weren't), there certainly weren't anymore. Even at a young age, John relied wholly on the benefits of tea to cure any situation. Sherlock smiled, his cracked lips stinging with the action. He wanted to laugh, to laugh and laugh and pull John towards him and
exactly he had planned was inconclusive. Two, he would see there was no getting past John and his trigger finger, and wisely allow himself to be restrained until the Yard came to collect him. Three, Förstner would die attempting something foolish.
Holmes pulled him closer by the hand still tangled in his hair and guided their lips together. Holmes’ lips were soft and tender, salty from Molly’s skin and his own natural sweetness that got John hard as a diamond. John licked into his mouth and sucked his tongue, enjoying the moan that dragged from Holmes’ throat, deep and rumbling. Holmes shuffled forward until the flat planes of their stomachs were pressed together as he dominated the embrace. John had no choice but to relent and push his hands up that silk-covered chest as Holmes trailed sloppy, open-mouthed kisses up his chin to the corner of his lips.
Once outside, they stood beside the door for a moment, neither of them wanting to go home to their empty flats alone. Then again, John hadn’t planned to either.
"While you're here, you might as well make yourself useful, Lestrade," Sherlock said, disentangling John's hands from his gown. "Watch him. I'm going to take a shower. I trust you not to do anything foolish."
John wanted to ask about Sherlock's experience with humans, but Sherlock's expression seemed almost forbidding. “Mrs. Hudson is a human, and she seems alright.”
She sat up and the men transferred her to their shoulders. “There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer thinks you're… awful nice!”
He was drowning in him, and like a man who’d been submerged for too long, he resurfaced gasping for air. At some point he’d hunched over John, one hand beside his shoulder to steady himself as he stroked John’s cock with the other. He’d pressed John down into the mattress in a position which Sherlock was positive put pressure on his healing shoulder.
Molly fidgeted where she stood, unsure what to do with her hands as she looked everywhere but directly at Sherlock. “Well, um - actually… well, I was wondering if you’d like to have a coffee with me sometime?”
At another time in his life, John would have introduced himself, but the urge to do so wasn’t present now. The image of Sherlock right before John departed the night before had superimposed itself over every other thought and become priority.
"Very good, John," Sherlock praised, his tone rough and ragged as he began to move with gentle, unhurried thrusts, allowing John's body time to acclimate to the breach. "You've exceeded all of my expectations." Sherlock whispered his acclaim in John's ears, carding a hand through the fine hairs on John's nape.
in charge of was still donating money annually to medical research, so what real difference would my being here cause?”
In his room, Sherlock pulled a long wooden box from the back of his sock index, under a row of meticulously organized, colour-coded hose. Inside was a riding crop he’d bought a few years ago but never put to use. He hadn’t intended to let it go to waste, but Sherlock hadn’t been able to bring himself to use it on any of the men he paid for sex.
He was close. He wrapped a hand around his lover’s cock and stroked, long, slow pulls that drew desperate moans from the back of the man’s throat.
When John's muscles relaxed fully, Sherlock began to thrust in earnest, repeatedly hitting that spot that made his insides crumble like dust. It was much too intense, and John just wanted to reach that pinnacle and take a plunge.
Embarrassed, John pulled back a little, unaware that he’d been leaning over the table, attracted by Sherlock’s undeniable gravity. “Oh, I’m- … sorry. I’ll stop if you like.” Not even thirty minutes into being himself around Sherlock and he was mucking things up.”I’m just… I guess you could say I’m astonished.”
But in the light of day, it stretched his insides taut with anxiety. Now that John had agreed to stay, Sherlock would take care of him. He would pay Mrs Hudson to feed him up, three meals a day and more if that was what he wished, so long as Sherlock never had to see the sharp relief of John’s ribs and spine.
"Now would be a good time to shut up, John," Sherlock growled through gritted teeth. Long, slender hands were lifted to his temples, rubbing slow, soothing circles into the skin, but the deep creases on his forehead and the quiet fury in Sherlock's voice betrayed his thoughts on the matter. "You and I know well enough you wouldn't survive the night."
John pulled himself away from his thoughts enough to form a coherent reply. "He wants me to fill in for his PA, to consider it a paid internship, he says."
“I knew it,” Greg hissed in triumph, swinging his legs off the cushions to meet the floor. “You two’ve been shagging, haven't you?” He prodded, positive that it wasn't all in his mind. Friends his arse, Greg thought. Friends didn't look at one another the way Sherlock had just now.
John couldn't deny that he was thoroughly fascinated with Sherlock, but it couldn't possibly work out in the end, when it would be time for John to depart. He couldn't allow himself to become attached.
"The only way I'm cooking anything is if you help." There, John put his foot down and Sherlock could take it or leave it. By the incredulous grimace taking hold of his aristocratic features, John didn't see that happening.
Lestrade stared between Sherlock and infant John, bemused as Sherlock bounced the child lightly in his arms, patting his back in what he hoped was a soothing gesture for him. He'd seen Anthea do it once after feeding John and then again, while putting him down for a nap.
Sherlock closed his eyes, content for the first time since John breathed his last breath on dusty linoleum.
John pushed back against the larger wolf with the bulk of his body. Where Sherlock was large and an overly aggressive fighter, John was compact and sturdy, capable of holding his own against an opponent twice his size. He used his smaller size to his advantage, feigning lunges only to slip under Sherlock's deadly grasp. His victory didn't last long, however, as the trick only worked once on the cleverer wolf, and John had to quickly assimilate a new plan to outdo the alpha.
The cold air is a whip on his bruised skin, and John winces in discomfort as he hoists his stiff body carefully from the dirty cement.
“We need to keep moving. The hunters can't be far behind,” said Sherlock, adjusting the strap of his bag over his chest as he turned on his heel and strode forward.
Sherlock carefully placed his phone on the counter and regarded John steadily. "You can tell them what you like, John. In fact, I'd like to know how you intend to explain that as well."
Sherlock smiled, one eyebrow rising in mild surprise. “Oh, you mean Lady Grey doesn’t have her own boudoir?”
John bit down on a few errant naughty thoughts and reminded himself that he was there for one reason. Mike counted on him to conduct his interview and the last thing John wanted to do was get thrown out for harassing Holmes' PA.
John lowered his head and shook it sadly, his lips pursed in the way they did when he was disappointed. Why? Why was he disappointed? What was happening to him?
"It's the only way, Sherlock," he whispered, blinking past the tears that muddled his vision."Jasper will come back, and that's all that matters."
“Sometimes, Sherlock,” Mycroft began quietly, something in his tone, softer, as he stared at his brother, and John suddenly had the feeling that he was intruding on something sacred, “it's important to blend. Not all humans are like the ones you've met. They are not all set on eradicating us.”
?” He snarled. “If your lot hadn’t been trampling over every bit of valuable information, one might have noticed the flecks of green paint in the gravel about a metre apart in two particular patches of soil. A ladder, then. I’ll have you know, once I brought back a soil sample, it only took me two minutes to examine and identify. While you were off buying Molly lunch,
He turned slightly, meeting John’s clouded gaze in the mirror as he stroked his thumb over his lips, enticed by the sight of them without lipstick.  John's lips were thinner without the make-up to embellish them, but just the same, Sherlock wanted to crowd him into the bed and kiss him into oblivion.
Irene sat down at the vanity and picked up her powder puff, dipping it into the powder before dabbing her cheeks and nose with it. “If that room had been empty with just the two of you, you would have let him bend you over right there, you cad,” she murmured as she leant in to touch up the blush on her cheeks.
He draped himself across John’s back and threaded a hand beneath John’s body, reaching up until he had the base of John’s throat sitting in his palm. He used the leverage to pull him up as much as possible with the restraints and fucked him, mind disconnected from his mouth as he babbled praise in John’s ear.
John stood to follow her, wanting to offer a hand in assistance, but Sherlock stopped him with a sharp look. "Sit," he ordered John brusquely, "Anderson, help Mrs. Hudson with the spread," he shot to the pale faced man at the end of the table, who complied readily enough, though it looked as if he was sucking on a lemon.
Sherlock caught his wrist, encircling them with his large hands. He eased John's hands off his chest, remembering the texture of his skin, the knobby protrusion of his pisiform, more pronounced than it should be.
John replied, wondering if maybe that came off a tad surly. Surely it wouldn't hurt to keep the man on his toes for a while.
John shrugged and returned her gesture. "I'm not perfect, but to be honest, I don't know a person who is."
,” John asked in wonder, his eyes tearing away from Sherlock to peer around the hall once more. It was all so posh, and John still couldn't believe that he was there, surrounded by lavish decor and heavy-pocketed entrepreneurs. He felt out of place and like he didn't belong. Which was true. This may be Sherlock's lifestyle, but John could understand how the man could get bored with it all. These people were beautiful and rich, but utterly
Sherlock was on his feet before he’d even processed the noise and heading toward the bedroom. When he poked his head in, John was setting a steaming cup on the bedstand and sucking on a finger.
To anyone else, the room would look like an upper class establishment. The room was warm-white from the glow of the pendant chandelier. The tables were positioned around the stage, where a mezzo-soprano crooned a wistful melody into the microphone, turning to smile lovingly at the man playing the saxophone to her left.
John scooted forward to close the gap between them, pressing his body to the lithe one beside him and pulling the cover up over his shoulder. He was positively knackered; it had been a long day.
John nodded and followed her to the back, where she showed him into a small room with a desk and two chairs. John sat, leaning his cane against the desk, and pulled his satchel over his head to place on the floor by his feet.
Sherlock caught John around the waist mid-jump and pulled him down, amused as the child giggled gleefully, struggling against his hold. "Business before pleasure, John," he chided playfully, the brush of soft strands brushing against the bottom of his jaw as John sat down in his lap, back-to-chest.
Sherlock well remembered that familiar scent during his short stint at Cambridge. He and Victor would indulge occasionally, smoke a bit of marijuana, but by the number of times Sherlock would smell it from 221A, Mrs Hudson had no qualms with overindulging.
