“Tony, I don’t think you should be drinking.” Steve cautioned, taking one of the glasses from his hand.
“Not with someone that's almost 30 years old!” Tony went off again. “I want to meet him.”
He smiled at her, asking, “When?” but was cut off by a kiss pressed to his lips. Jacob immediately settled both hands on her waist, earning a soft moan from her. When they pulled apart, he asked again, "when?"
The question took Natasha by surprise. They’d never talked about marriage before but in hindsight, she supposed she should have seen this coming. They were getting closer to their 4-year anniversary; 4 months off to be exact and Bruce had married Betty way sooner than that. But there were a lot of factors at play for the duration of his first marriage. Bruce wasn’t a ranging green monster anymore; her father wasn’t a Former Lieutenant of the U.S. Army and she hadn’t gotten pregnant. So maybe she shouldn’t compare then to now.
“Surgeon.” Stephen supplied and he heard Steve scoff.
Harley almost choked on his drink. “A date?” He sat up straight and eyed his mother suspiciously as he walked around his lab putting stuff away and asking Friday to shut down his other computers. “With who?”
Wade shuffled uncomfortably under Harley’s gaze.
Pepper thought.
he thought. “You never truly forget but you can always find room to forgive”, and Tony was starting to think maybe it was time he took his own words, his own advice into consideration.
“No. I’ve just been distracted,” he said slowly, and his eyes wondered back to Tony and Stephen. Jealously was eating him alive. He hated seeing Tony with someone else.
Anna let out a chuckle, that had everyone staring at her. How could she find this funny? Steve was glaring at her. “Are you serious? My own twin brother.” She cackled some more. “You think I faked the DNA results or something?”
“If I press charges, he could go to jail. Morgan would lose her father.” The board read.
After a beat, Peter finally fessed up. “You know that guy who swings around, saving people, in that red and blue suit?”
“Valkyrie.” He responded without hesitation.
“It was.” Tony agreed. “You gave her too much power over you.” It was evident however, that he wasn’t thinking clearly at the time. He let that insane woman, use him like a pawn but Steve knew he couldn’t put all the blame on her.
“Yes,” Morgan agreed. “She’s probably trying to help Aunt Nat and Remy cover their tracks.” If Remy and Anna were really that closely involved, Morgan could easily understand why she’d want to help her boyfriend out.
“Peter. Your brother is a growing boy.” Maria justified, giving Steve a kiss on the cheek as she took the dish from his hands and carried it to the kitchen for later.
“Your royal highness.” The minister gave Torunn a bow and she in turn acknowledged him. Harley and Torunn then joined hands before the minister and the congregation once the ceremony commenced. As the minister spoke, they stared into each other’s eyes, falling deeper into love, clearly and Harley couldn’t stop himself from remarking how lovely his bride looked. Torunn’s cheeks redden with happiness and she reciprocated, returning the compliment.
“Right.” Stephen concluded.
“How much did he tell you?”
Peter didn’t respond. They already knew the answer. They already knew why not. Instead, he planted a brief kiss on Wade’s lips, adjusted his glasses once more and resumed typing. Wade then got comfortable, his arms resting behind his head as he leeaned back on his bed's headboard. Wade had told Peter that the sound of his typing was relaxing for him. Truthfully, he just enjoyed having Peter over, no matter what he was doing or what they ended up doing. And Peter had been spending a vast amount of time over at his place. He was avoiding being home and Wade could understand why.
“But you never fully moved on. Even after years of marriage with someone else and having someone else’s child.” Sif shot back. “You just couldn’t let it go Carol.” She jeered.
“Friday pull up all the information on that name.” Tony requested.
“Maybe a little,” Tony responded. He didn’t think he would ever be able to get over that fact that his ex-husband also shared the same name even if it was spelled differently. It was like dating Steve all over again.
“We don’t have any more kids.” Tony sniffled, turning around, hugging Steve hard and burying his face in his neck. Steve sighed. Tony’s mood swings and emotional outbursts were always the worst thing about his pregnancy.
“Yeah. I wish she could stay little forever.” Sam responded.
Carol poured herself some orange juice, taking a sip before answering. “Next week. James is coming to get me on Saturday.” It was Wednesday. Just two more days to go.
Tony placed his right palm over his mouth to conceal his shock…or smile, rather? Why was he smiling? Did he...?
Nertha accepted her defeat. She wouldn’t dare bring more shame to her mother.
“I don’t think I can forgive Dad and Aunt Nat for hurting you Mom.”
She hated her powers, however. Professor Xavier always told her it was a gift; a gift to be able to gain access of any other mutants’ powers and other people’s memories through physical contact but at what cost? To cause the individual to be in excruciating pain. It was a curse so when she met Tony Stark Rogers and Steve Rogers – who claimed to be her parents and she believed them on the account of a connection she felt with Tony – she wasn’t sure if she should hug them.
“You’ve been replaced, Morgie.” Came Harley’s obnoxious voice and Morgan hit him in his left arm. Laughter flowed through the room.
“Hey, Morguna.” He took the dish from her.
“It doesn’t matter anymore,” Tony sniffled after which he recomposed himself. “I need you to stop blabbering about who I’m dating to everyone. It’s none of your business.”
Nat caught on, grinning back at her. “Sounds like a plan.” She responded, jokily. It was good to be on better terms with Morgan again.
“What’s happening?” Tony cried, searching the other doctors’ faces for an answer. Steve watched them hook up the unmoving baby to different machines trying anything to make her breathe on her own.
“Why do you think I need to hear this?”
Steve nodded in agreement. Morgan released her father from the hug and kept her head rested on his shoulder for comfort. Steve soon noticed Peter hadn’t said a word even though this information wasn’t new to him. His voice which was filled of concern broke through Peter’s thoughts. “You okay Pete?”
“Need you here.” Harley whispered, staring into her eyes on the screen. He was craving physical contact, for someone to hug him and be there with him. He didn’t want to think about the incident that took place on Christmas and certainly not what had followed.
Of course not. Lila ended up being grounded. She grumbled and complained about it the entire ride home. Clint supposed Nat was right. It was kind of selfish of him to attack Harley and not punish his own daughter. Might as well hold everyone accountable for their actions.
Today she thought she saw Steve smile when the doctor told them they were having a girl. She wanted to go over baby names with him, but he let her know he had other things to attend to and drove off, leaving her at the doctor’s office. She finally got the door open, walked into her apartment and shut the door behind her with her foot.
I apologize for errors and chapter length. This was originally a longer chapter but now split into two.
And then Peter uttered the words that no parent ever wanted to hear. “I hate you.” Tony’s heart broke and Peter disappeared into his room.
They greeted their mother before Peter headed to the fridge to get some juice. Morgan stopped at the island counter taking in the sight and aroma of all the food laid out there. “Mom, did you cook?” she asked, going to feed Binx only to find her already eating from her bowl. No doubt, her mother had fed her.
“See?” Tony paused, rolling his eyes. “You’re not being fair. You’re being way too lenient with her, when our daughter – your daughter messed up.” He corrected himself.
Steve sighed and Bucky picked up where his husband left off. “I really think you should focus on the new baby right now.”
“Why should I not?” She spoke up, taking the hand and holding it with hers. Harley drew even closer to his wife and held her at the waist. “You are not happy,” She went on. “And so, I can’t be.
Steve returned the smile and wrapped his arm around his daughter’s shoulders and walked down the hall to the elevator. “Sorry honey. Your Uncle Sam caught me first and I didn’t want to wake you if you were still sleeping.”
“You didn’t give him my name.” He whispered. Nicky was still sleeping.
“Sure.” Morgan smiled before turning to Anna. “Can we talk for a second?” Harley gave her a knowing look. He didn’t want thinking blowing up at his wedding reception if Morgan tried to confront Anna and things went left but Morgan purposely ignored his non-verbal warning as was typical Morgan Stark-Rogers behaviour. He sighed.
Tony squealed and laughed at his sudden moves. He wrapped an arm around his neck and let Steve know, “I love you more.” Forever and always, he promised, letting Steve fuck him towards another climax.
Steve choked up; sobs now lodged in his throat. Tony gave him the box of tissues. Steve crying was as rare as Morgan crying and he didn’t like seeing it.
to believe her wholeheartedly. Nat pulled back. “Anything else we need to discuss?” Just to ease his worries, she figured.
“Except that it is, Morgan.” Anna pulled her eyebrows together and stared at her sister with doe-like eyes of innocence. “You were angry, didn’t want to talk about mom so I changed the subject.”
“Okay. Get going babe.” Tony fanned him off when Steve was growing quiet again and Tony realized he was staring at him again, lovingly.
Morgan couldn’t agree more. “I know. But I also know they miss each other so much.” She slid down from his shoulder, pulling him down with her so they were fully under the covers minus their heads. She turned to face him, resting her head against his heart. She wished she wouldn’t think about her parents’ relationship so much. They’d moved on after all. Mom was happy with Stephen and Dad was happy with whoever he was with now. It was just sad to think that the relationship was severely broken and extremely difficult to repair.
The baby boy came into their lives with a head full of Steve’s exact shade of blonde hair and a matching white streak like his sister before him, Anna. The couple worried their son might have a unique power as Anna did. It surprised Steve and Tony still, that this rarity had happened a second time but it was something that made their baby boy unique if his exact replica of Steve’s features were anything to go by. No way in hell he could have been Stephen Strange's son.
“General check-up would do.” Tony suggested. That was what he had already decided anyways. He wouldn't just not show up.
She and Bruce sang him Happy Birthday as best they could; Nat more than Bruce being the better singer. They sat on either side of his bed and Nat ran through the events of the day per his requests. They had made his favorite breakfast. They each got him a gift and he wanted to spend the day with Morgan before they had dinner together, later that night.
“You’re getting old, mom.” But then again others thought he was too smart for his own good. “Let me know what Uncle Bruce thinks about it, yeah?” Harley suggested, running a hand through his light brown hair and Tony could see the mess of a room behind him.
“I was thinking…” She began, her tone, sounding very professional which made both her parents laugh. “I would like a sibling, please.” She placed great emphasis on the last word and Bucky noted how polite she was being with such a request.
- Gives us a few more revelations and some much needed reconciliation...💛❤💙
Tony was smothering him in a hug. It was the third one in an hour. Harley was whining about it. “Mom, please stop. I’m not a baby anymore.”
“Why don’t you want to get married?”
“Can I be honest with you?” Steve asked instead. Tony nodded. Even if they weren’t together, he’d always be there for Steve. No matter what.
“What about good old triple-S?” Harley reminded her. He was referring to the super soldier serum. Morgan had noticed something was different about her and brought it to her parents’ attention. They all to willingly filled her and Harley in when he caught on to it as well.
She took the elevator down to the lab and tried to enter the lab with Harley’s emergency passcode but was denied. Friday only let members of the Stark-Rogers family in otherwise. That was their usual way of access, through literal identification.
“That’s terrible.” Morgan sympathized. She had so much freedom. She’d probably lose her mind if her parents started dictating her life again like she was a kid. So maybe being the daughter of a King and Queen wasn’t all it was cracked out to be.
“Yeah. It’s my parents I’m most concerned about.” Morgan answered. Her mother and father had sat her and Peter down and had Harley on video call and told them about Justin Hammer’s involvement in their life. Now they knew Aunt Nat and their father’s affair wasn’t of their own free will; their father wasn’t the father of Sharon’s baby and that there was a possibility that Paige, their sister might still be out there.
“Hi Morgan.” Stephen greeted her. She returned the greeting. “How are you feeling?”
Steve entwined his fingers with Tony’s. His back was pressed up against Steve’s middle and Steve was leaving kitten licks and nibbles on his ear. Their eyes were closed, and they were at least three layers deep under the multiple bed sheets.
“I almost didn’t recognize you. You look – you look great,” he commented. He hadn’t been able to be alone with Nertha all night with Hela lurking close by but all grown up Lila would do.
Morgan:
He got inside the building and checked in at the front desk. Eventually a nurse took his weight, height, checked his blood pressure and he provided a urine sample among other things. While waiting to see Dr McIntosh, he was reminded of the extended waiting period he had in anticipation of Anna’s DNA results. He never doubted she was his and Steve’s until his other three put the idea in their heads. As Steve had suggested, they did another test – one where they were both present. They couldn’t afford any issues this time around, but Tony was almost a 100% sure Anna was their daughter. He felt it in his heart.
“It was hard.” Anna took a breath to punctuate her statement. “Growing up without parents.” She explained. Tony’s eyebrows crinkled together in sympathy. “For the longest, I couldn’t understand why I’d be abandoned...” She trailed off. Her eyebrows were slightly furrowed, and her jaw clenched, like Steve. She favoured Steve more even though her and Peter were supposedly identical.
Harley didn’t respond. Torunn could guess what it was but Harley hadn’t wanted to talk about it for weeks.
"Steve is great." Tony explained. "He's moving in tomorrow. You'll get to meet him. You'll see he's a good guy." He insisted. "He's
And so is Tony. Steve can vaguely make out the figure of Bucky, dragging Tony off of him and getting a few punches in before Tony flees the scene. Then Bucky is calling out to him, telling him to stay with him but Steve doesn’t think he can. It would be easier to just let go.
“I figured what better anniversary gift than a surprise wedding.” Steve stated, pulling him close again and kissing his forehead.
Peter rolled his eyes, swallowing his own arousal. He decided to change the subject. “I half-expected to see countless pictures of myself in here.”
Tony pulled away from her and looked to Steve who hadn’t taken his eyes off him since he walked in. “Tony. Just call me Tony.” He held out his hand to shake Steve’s. “Nice to meet you, Captain.”
That’s why Harley was irritated by the fact that Jaime Kozlov, Natasha’s nephew was getting more of Torunn’s attention than him. Everything was fine until Lila Barton came over with the guy, stealing Torunn’s attention from him. Lila had scoffed at the sight of Harley but greeted Nathan and Torunn fairly before introducing Jaime to them.
These thoughts swam around in Harley’s head as he went through yet another council meeting. Meetings that always included Thor, Sif, Torunn and Hela. Loki attendance always seemed optional. Once it had adjourned, he and Torunn walked side by side out of the council room and into their quarters on the east wing of the palace.
Peter groaned and accepted defeat. “Okay but she asked for a truce. I didn't even know there was a need for one.”
“He blocked me.”Steve explained.
Caffrey spoke out then. “Objection your honor! My client has never been on any form of drugs. This is purely all fabrication.”
Natasha tried to approach Morgan too, but she wasn’t having it. “I think you should leave too Natasha.” The mention of her name and not “Aunt Nat” stung. Morgan couldn’t see her as anything but a homewrecker now. Natasha left without another word. Bruce was already heading towards the car. He was the only person she ever told about that unforgiveable night with Steve all those years ago.
“I swear to you, I love Peter. I really do. We’ve talked about getting married.” He paused, and his tone changed after that. “And he’s not a kid anymore.”
Tony considers Steve as one of his best friends in the group. Of all the avengers. They’re probably the closest. Not Clint. Not Nat. Not Thor and not even Bruce. But Steve, he would dare say, is his best friend. That’s it. Even when they spent their nights together in the same bed. Even when they screwed so much it started to feel like they were making love, on Steve’s part. Even though all the avengers knew. Even though Pepper was clueless. Even though all that stuff happened. He was just his friend.
he thought. He was feeling responsible for the situation they were in. He should have never given into her.
“Just waiting on you, brother.” Hela explained after which Torunn approached the trio. She stayed by her mother’s side as they made their entrance on the grand balcony. Nertha, Loki and Hela followed suit. The crowd roared and cheered when the royals came into view and Thor introduced his son, Magni, Prince of Asgard and God of Strength. He favoured Sif more in looks especially with his head of dark hair that was identical to Sif’s.
Tony and Steve stared at each other. No. They weren’t present during the drawing on the blood sample nor could they possibly be at the lab when the sample was examined.
“I do like you.” Torunn confessed. Her chat with her Uncle Loki in December came to mind. No point hiding her feelings. Maybe he would return them. They were getting married after all.
“I didn’t know we were re-instating guards for the royal family, Father.”
Nathan drew his face out of her neck, his lips inches away from hers again. “What are we going to do?” Morgan asked. There was a baby to think about. The thought made her shiver. She never thought she’d be saying that so soon but here they were. A baby between them, literally.
“Then everything will be okay, Harley.” Jacob patted his shoulder. Harley met his eyes in the mirror. “You got this.” Harley was starting to wish he had taken up his mother or father’s offer of staying with him while he got ready. Instead he tried to put on a brave face, but damn was he nervous. So, he took another deep breath and pictured Torunn’s smiling face.
“Because she’s not Paige.” Peter put in, finally joining them. The members of the Asgardian royal family were lingering nearby. Tony instantly started worrying.
Harley’s eyes were on his parents. “How comes Anna got all the cool powers?” he quipped.
“Come on.” She insisted, quickly downloading the Instagram app. “You’re a good-looking guy. Instagram was made for people like you. And besides you could really put Harley to shame.” Nathan snickered, as he did at all her jokes.
“When am I getting my home back?”
Steve, Clint and Pietro had stopped by to properly meet William one day, bearing gifts. They were greeted by said baby who was floating above Wanda’s head when she opened the door. Wanda had lowered William into her arms who rested his head against her chest and sucked a thumb.
That was going well. Cassie was newly 18 and Pietro wasn’t opposed to going on a few dates with her. She was appreciative of Morgan and Amelia for setting things up for her. Now they were dying to get details about Pietro.
he thought, and he couldn’t let that happen.
“Yeah.” She rose from her seat, telling Morgan it was time to go. Morgan hugged her father and reluctantly told him goodbye. Steve didn’t like this. He was thinking he needed to stop taking Nicky to see Tony. This couldn’t be good for him.
Also please forgive my errors in advance..
“You took Tony from me but I won't have my child being raised by you.” Stephen countered.
Steve pulled out, reluctantly, and removed Tony’s right leg from where he had hiked it to get better access to the now, cum filled hole. He heard a another moan pass by Tony’s lips and Steve chuckled knowing how much Tony loved to stay connected after they came together. It wouldn’t have been an issue this time around either if Steve didn’t have a certain plan in place.
, she thought.
“Why isn’t he waking up?” Steve wondered. It wasn’t making sense. The doctors had gotten the bullet out. Tony was perfectly fine according to their analysis but for whatever reason, Tony wouldn’t wake up. He’d slipped into a comatose state.
Pepper who was still on the phone saw the interaction between them. “He’s still mad, huh?”
“Can we fix the door somehow before Mom gets home?” She gestured to the door.
“I didn’t kill Hammer.” Anna voiced when she was finally in speaking distance.
Strange only glimpsed at him but gave a response. “No actually.” He took a sip of his drink. “My boyfriend has three though, so I suppose I do…in a sense.” Stephen didn’t consider Tony’s kids his, but he’d humour strangers if it made his relationship look secure and the kids were warming up to him as of late. Especially since Steve and Nat’s revelation. That gave him an opportunity to swoop in and ‘play father’ with the three of them avoiding Steve.
Morgan put her phone down and took a sip of her cold beverage. “Has he finally gotten rid of the depression beard?”
“Happy Birthday Tony.” Steve whispered and it made Tony grin, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He was 46 today.
Peter looked to his sister “Should we?” he wondered, looking off in the direction of the back yard.
“Alright. I know the baby is mine.” He paused. “You wouldn’t have reacted the way you had if it wasn’t.”
Her response was nonchalant; as if Harley was just another human she could tinker and toy with it. “For as long as it suits me.” She'd seen the way Harley was with Lila Barton at the Christmas Party those months ago. It infuriated her. She wanted Harley all for herself.
Tony broke down again, crying as hard as Steve did. Justin Hammer had ruined them, broken them, destroyed them, caused them so much pain. Their hearts ached together as they embraced in a hug stained with tears.
“Tempting...” Tony commented, stopping himself from going any further in Stephen’s shirt. “But I gotta go back to dinner…” he trailed off, before suggesting he join the family dinner. Stephen looked unsure.
“Yes. I promise.” She added. “I just wish I was there with Tony when he fought Hammer.” Natasha would have loved to be there to have her chance at teaching Hammer a lesson but him being in SHIELD’s prison for life would have to do. She knew Fury would ensure that life for him was always hell on earth.
“Yeah but -”
Wanda watched from a distance, her twin parading around with Cassandra Lang. He hadn’t fully told her the extent of his relationship with her. He only stated that he was getting to know her. Clearly, it was growing into more than that.
“I should have believed you. I should have heard what you had to say. Please forgive me.”
“Hi Uncle Thor.” Harley responded. By now, Torunn was handed her brother in the middle of a hug with her mother. Torunn noted that Magni had gotten so big already. They knew he’d be as tall as Thor by his 16
“What? Why?” Sam shouted over the running water.
“Let’s just leave the investigation to Fury.” Steve chimed in and Tony nodded in agreement because they wouldn’t be too quick to believe any and everything. He and Steve had fallen apart because of that and he wouldn’t allow them to land in another situation like that again.
Remy followed Pepper up the elevator and through the party. Pepper had formally invited him to the event after discussing it with Tony. He was Amelia’s father which made him eligible for family gatherings. Remy declined but offered to stop by and give their daughter a Christmas gift.
“What happened?” Harley asked, leaning in closer with Morgan. They kept their eyes on whichever parent was speaking at the time.
Tony only found out the day before that he had been receiving reminders of this appointment, from a week ago and he somehow overlooked them. He figured though, he might as well keep his appointment and get a general check-up. He was due one anyways.
day of May. He was scheduled with Dr Kayla McIntosh – his doctor whom had been there to monitor all three of his pregnancies. Tony wouldn’t trust anyone else. He would have gotten an earlier date, but she was fully booked until mid-June. And he didn’t see the need for any sort of hurry, so he didn’t bother asking her to try squeezing him sooner. He hoped Stephen would understand. Until then, they’d keep trying on their own.
“It’s going to hurt.” He whispered, when they came up for air. Torunn kept her eyes on his letting him know she still wanted this. She began working on his pants, but he stopped her, picking her up and placing her gently on the bed.
Peter thought. “Why does it matter to you?” he didn’t try getting away this time. “You’re indestructible.” He shot back. Wade hesitated for a second too long and Peter had to ask of him, not to lie to him.
“Not sure. She spends most of her time with her father these days.”
“You said you were watching me when we first met.” He shot back. “
Nathan heard voices as he came downstairs, but he couldn’t make out the words. He did however recognize the female one and looking around the corner of the kitchen’s wall gave him a glimpse of the owner of the male voice. Remy LeBeau. He and Nat were conversing in hushed tones before Remy leant forward and whispered something in her ear. Nathan couldn’t hear it. Then the doorbell rung, and she agreed to whatever Remy had said. She quickly asked him to leave and he disappeared in seconds. She went to get the door and Nathan stayed hidden around the corner wondering why Nat would be sneaking around with Amelia’s father. His mind concluded with an affair right off the bat.
“It’s not important.” Remy tried again, rising from the bed to cast his coat aside. She lay back on her elbows, as he shed his shirt next. Anna pulled her dress up to her thighs and Remy settled between them. They kissed and he reached a hand under her dress, grunting with approval when he brushed against her naked and already wet folds. Anna bit on his lip, inviting him into her. A single finger slipped into her core and Anna moaned into his mouth.
“Mimi, can I ask what happened between you and Jacob?” She began, watching her daughter grab a bottle of water from the fridge.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve, with a tray of food in hand, was staring back at him when Tony woke. He was seated on his side of the bed and smiling at him.
Anna didn’t hesitate, however. Not even for a second. “I don’t know anything about that.” That she could say honestly. She smiled and turned to walk away, when Morgan shot a question at her that made her pause in her tracks.
“Really?” He watched her expressions change. “You’re not attracted to him, are you?” He had to ask, fearing that this might not go over well if one of his best friends had somehow fallen for the man who was dating – he gagged at the thought again – his murderous daughter. So murderous that she had intended to kill him and Steve without battling an eyelash.
“I know.” Pepper’s eyes get a little wet at Tony’s description. “One of the pains of being a mother. You can just feel your children’s pain.” Pepper knew. Even as old as her kids were, if they so much as got a paper cut, she’d wince at the sight of it.
“No. They’re just co-parenting.” Jacob evoked in her mind the memory of a prior conversation.
One to his group chat with Peter and Morgan.
“Peter, what was that?” Ned finally spoke up after listening in on the conversation.
“I don't want to hear it Peter. I want to meet this guy.” Tony repeated. “You’re lucky I don’t tell your Dad.” Yeah. He really was. Steve would flip out 10 times more than Tony just did.
He had put Nicky in his little hospital bassinet by his own bed so he was shocked out of his mind when, he woke up and didn’t see him there. Then there was the sound of feet moving back and forth in the room and little whispers and coos? Because Tony freaking Stark was standing at the foot of his bed, Nicky bundled up in his arms.
Tony left it at that. He let Morgan know he was there if she needed to talk about the mess that was dinner, leaving her to finish up in the bathroom.
Torunn went home for the summer. She spent most of her time meeting potential suitors and hated every second of it. Luckily, Sif had given birth two days ago which put the attention on her mother and away from herself, halting the meeting of suitors. She was grateful.
Nathan stayed quiet sucking on his teeth. That wasn't entirely true. To be fair there were plenty of times where he hadn't pulled out in the heat of the moment.
Tony had been working on a new project with Bruce for the past few weeks and he figured he’d let his son have a go at it. No they weren’t avenging anymore but creating things had always been a hobby of his so he wouldn’t be stopping that anytime soon.
Torunn snatched the knife sheathed on Loki’s hip and threw it in Nertha’s direction. It went flying past Nertha’s face and her eyes widen in horror as it missed her by an inch, cutting off a couple strands of her dark hair. Nertha fired back in an instant, levitating Torunn high up above them. Loki and Hela watched in amusement. Then Torunn’s eyes began to glow as she summoned enough lightning to target Nertha and give her a shock. Nertha screamed in pain upon impact, dropping Torunn to the ground. The princess caught herself, landing on her feet. She pushed a lock of blonde hair that had fallen out back in its place.
“I know. I’m sorry.” Steve responded. He wouldn’t expect any differently from her.
When she had opened her front door, she averted her eyes at Wade and then at Peter with a scornful look as she alternated between speaking in English and Spanish. It went on for a while with Wade trying to get a word in when Ellie popped up at the doorway beside her mother. The little girl looked more like her mother than Wade by a long shot, but Peter could still see a hint of Wade in her when she smiled up at him; one of her front teeth missing.
“We have a kid.” Tony said, effortlessly. “We have
The question surprised Natasha but it was clear as day that Sam had already made his mind up on such allegations. Natasha knew Bucky, however. She knew he had only ever been with Sam. He’d never shown interest in anyone else and even if he had, he wasn’t one to act on them, especially not to create a child with someone that wasn’t his husband.
Steve realized that Tony was avoiding his emotions. And he couldn't understand why. What was keeping Tony away? He could have ended things with Stephen, already but he hadn't. And Steve knew he wouldn't be getting answers any time soon so he welcomed the change of conversation.
“What are we? Five?” Morgan laughed, only seconds before Peter was racing towards one of the big open windows. He pointed at a pole in their back yard and used his webs to carry himself across the lawn. He was about to land softly on the ground when Morgan appeared behind with a big thud. Not hair was out of place. Peter almost shrieked.
he bet
“Apparently neither did she. But I know we can work it out. I was hoping to start figuring something out with her this morning but…”
Wade obeyed, pushing pass the resistance and sheathing his cock with Peter’s once-virgin walls. Peter screamed out, never imagining, sex would hurt so much, and Wade drew closer to his face, kissing his cheeks to try and sooth him. “Do you want me to stop?”
Note: I did say indirectly that Sharon's baby was Hammer's in Chapter 12 (3rd scene)
Steve ran his fingers through his golden locks in frustration, taking a few steps away from Tony. This was the most sensitive topic that always came up in their conversations. He was stupid and cheated on the one person he has ever loved his entire life. “It was once, Tony and to this day I am so sorry. You know I am. I made a huge mistake and lost the love of my life because of it.”
“Oh, that sounds awesome.” Jaime explained, sounding genuinely excited for any social gathering. Morgan then gave him more details about the party and even suggesting he bring Lila Barton as his plus one, considering he was dating her and despite the fact that they weren’t that close as friends anymore. And that’s when Nathan joined them again.
“Anna’s dangerous.” Harley concluded. They needed to stop beating around that fact. “And we don’t know how much she helped Aunt Nat and/or Remy LeBeau.” In his mind, he saw them as all guilty until proven otherwise.
“Will you answer?” She dared, smiling at him. He nodded in hopes of assuring her. He’d answer any questions she had, if it helped ease her mind. He admired Pepper. He could see she was good woman.
“Father’s day is tomorrow,” he remembered in that moment. He wasn’t technically a father yet and he wondered if they should celebrate it anyways.
“I heard you and Steve are back together,” came Maria Stark’s voice over the phone. Tony was truly appalled at the insane notion.
He wanted to get rid of it like he knew Steve would want him to, but he settled with, “I have to think about it.”
“We’re engaged. I’m about to be your husband and I can’t go a day without hearing about your ex.”
Unbeknownst to the couple, Justin Hammer was watching the scene unfold from the drone-like micro-camera he manged to put on Stephen when he patted his shoulder earlier.
“Honey, it’s just one date.” Tony stated simply. It was just a date. He wasn’t marrying the guy.
“So we got scrambled eggs, bacon and waffles,” Morgan continued. “Peter and I are about to head off to school. Are you going in to work, today?”
“I ate your ass last night.” He mumbled against his cheek. “And I wanna do it again.” He grabbed Tony’s thigh. He stopped his hands descent.
“No. This is very serious. You’ve never dated anyone before. Like where is he from? How did you guys meet?” Morgan seemed to be genuinely curious.
Pepper had just lied to Rhodey over the phone about Carol’s whereabouts. With what she’d learned from him, Pepper decided to question Carol. “That was Rhodey.” She began.
. Harley worried about that at times; Torunn was no doubt going to outlive him. “But if you ever need to get laid, I still have a few contacts.” Harley smirked.
She took the gift coming face to face with him. She was only a few inches shorter than him. It made him feel small. Not many girls were as tall as him, being 6ft.
“You remember Peter Quill?”
“What?” he laughed again. “I think you mean the way
“Yeah.” He pulled away from his father and turned to his mother. “That’s why you don’t want me hanging out with Wade.”
“If…if…” he began, trying to free is hand from Tony’s grip. “If we can be together...” Steve was careful to repeat Tony’s exact words as his brown eyes watched him. “Then we don’t have to get rid of SJ…we can have our son. We can be a family.” Because that’s all he wants. He wants SJ to have both his parents in his life. He wants to have Tony’s love and wants to be a family with him. Steve had been so distorted in the past because Tony never failed to remind him that he could never give him what Pepper could. They’d never be a family. But they can now. If Tony wants to be together, they can be a family too.
His last words hit the nail on Sam’s coffin, and he hated himself for doing what he had. “Babe. I just wanted to be sure.” Sam supplied but that didn’t help his case. It made it worst.
“So am I.” Peter shouted, watching his grandmother walk away.
“I thought you would have found me sooner, Tony.” Justin greeted them. “I wished you’d have come alone.”
home. Friday had informed them of his arrival when they were moments away from another session of lovemaking. Tony was left frustrated and incredibly annoyed as he and Steve both stood before the elevator doors. Tony was hugging him and resting his head on his shoulder for comfort.
Sif eyed Carol now. They knew each other’s history and even though Odin was the one to blame for this mess, it still did not change the fact that Thor and Sif grew to love each other. Something she knew they had no control over but there was still bad blood. Sif didn’t like the constant reminder of what was every time she saw Carol and Carol didn’t like the reminder of what could have been. It didn’t matter anymore though Thor made her weak and finding Rhodey after the way things ended was good for her.
“Anthony Stark.” He began and Tony was frozen. He had a strong feeling about where this was going. “We’ve been together for over a year now and I can’t tell you how much I love you and cherish you. I cannot imagine my life without you. Please,” Stephen paused, getting down on one knee. Tony gasped and the room was unbelievably quiet.
Harley thought for a minute. He’d heard part of Jacob’s conversation before he walked it. His parents had announced they were getting a divorce to him and his siblings almost 4 years ago. He was 16 at the time. Morgan was 14 and Peter was 13. It was safe to say Peter took it the hardest.
Loki chose to overlook what he believed to be a lie and carried on with the conversation. “You do. So why do you not wish to marry him?”
“Please?” He begged this time. It made Wade smirk as he reached over to grab some lube from Peter’s bedside table. He didn’t want this to hurt any more than it would have to. He spread some over his erection and some on Peter’s waiting hole. He positioned himself and slid the head in slowly, meeting so much resistance, Wade had to bite his lip to stop himself from coming in that moment.
“Family is family. Everyone is invited.” Pepper answered and she knew the question that was going to come next.
Chapter 31: Dirty Little Secret
“You haven’t visited me in so long.” Maria stressed, taking his hand in both of hers.
“I would never ask you to do that even if the baby is really his.” Steve said, instead.
“Why would I be working with the man who kidnapped me and kept me away from my family? Do you guys hear how crazy you sound right now?” Anna almost laughed. This was absurd.
When Lila came back, she smiled for the first time that morning. Aunt Nat would be on her side. “Please tell me you talked some sense into Mom and Dad.”
Tony let out a delicious moan. “I can never have a proper conversation with you.” He began shuffling around and Steve pulled back his fingers. Tony was facing him, staring into his soul when, the next words graced his lips. “But I just can’t resist either.” And he forced his lips unto Steve’s, never having to beg for entrance into his mouth.
“Your majesty.” Cassie and Lila said, simultaneously while Torunn held hands with her mother and shared cheek kisses. “Lila was just being bitter.” Cassie added.
“What?”
Stephen finally spoke up. “I suppose I was acting rather childish.”
Shock then anger overcame Tony nd he shoved Stephen breaking from his hold.. “Get the fuck away from me!” He shouted and that's when Steve returned, shielding Tony with his body from Stephen's hateful gaze. Anger seethed through him.
“Yes.” He uttered.
“Not even in your dreams.” Harley jeered, appearing behind them. Morgan joined as well before they went their separate ways. Steve said his goodbyes and Tony shot him a sympathetic look before leaving him with the likes of Sharon Carter. He made his bed; he’d have to lie in it.
“I don’t think it would matter though. Once a cheater, always a cheater, right?” Harley finished. That left them with food for thought. What if his dad and Aunt Nat still had a thing going on?
Steve eventually calmed himself enough to respond to Tony. “He’s not right for you, Tony. You have to see that.”
Harley broke first, his arms still folded over his chest. “I thought your baby-making days were over... Like aren’t you guys a little too old to be having a baby?” Tony almost took offence, but he knew this line of questioning was coming. It had been a surprise after all and before Tony could explain that, Steve dished out a stern look at their eldest. Harley quickly realized he was being a little too forward and started to apologize.
Bruce hushed her. He knew how much she hated herself for breaking up Steve and Tony. Steve had even blamed her at one point. He was adamant Natasha must have done something to him because he couldn’t remember anything about that crucial night.
I should be writing "Family is Everything" but i took a break.
Across the room, Tony introduced Stephen to Maria and she apologized for not believing her son would be dating a doctor. He had sworn off doctors and everyone except Stephen knew it. Steve was watching the scene unfold.
Amelia nodded. Torunn snickered at their responses. “Have you two forgotten I have to find a suitable husband? I’m practically taken as well.”
“Yes she does. Her father just ‘babys’ her a lot. Doesn’t let her do anything that involves guys.” Amelia informed them.
“That can be arranged.” He stated, looking down at her. “Whatever you want. Whatever you need.”
“Good.” Justin commended, reaching in his pocket for a piece of paper before turning and sliding it to Gary.
“No.” Tony whispered. “Just leave.” He wasn’t able to look his husband in the face anymore. What more could he say? How many more lies did he have left to say? He didn’t want to be alone, but he didn’t want to be around Steve.
Clint commented that the kid would really be in for something with parents like Wanda and Vision. Steve had to agree, remarking that he was now a part of a bigger family.
“How did I not know this?” and he remembered all the girls that he suggested in the past and Jacob always denied. Harley figured that he must have been secretly gay until Amelia came along. Jacob didn’t respond. “We have to get you laid immediately.” He began scrolling through his phone and an idea popped in his head. “How about Nertha?”
Tony gave in. “Okay.”
“I could ask you the same, Petey.” He responded mockingly.
Nat sat forward. “Fury says there was a second person who infiltrated SHIELD on the night of, but they can’t I.D. any of them.” She was as curious about the investigation as Steve and Tony were, fearing the killer might extend his wrath to her. If that person was helping Hammer, there was no telling for how long. As early as the chipping incident or recently where Sharon was involved and the poisoning of Stephen Strange? Fury kept her informed as the investigation progressed.
“It still hurts…” she confessed, and Morgan couldn’t stop herself from getting emotional. Harley wrapped his arm around her, rubbing her arm in the most comforting way possible.
Harley rested his elbow on the table before him and placed the side of his face in his palm for support as a smile stretched across his face. “Because if I was married and my wife decided she liked women. I’d take advantage of the situation and do exactly what Uncle Rhodey did.”
“Or what? You’ll kill me?” she wondered. “You can’t even stabilize your powers.” Jacob looked away at that. Harley must have mentioned that to her. Jacob couldn’t let that deter him. He was glaring at her again when next he spoke.
There was a pause before Tony spoke again. “Do you think I’ll be a good father, Steve?” he had asked this question more than a handful of times during the pregnancy. He was constantly reminded of Howard and the abuse he inflicted on him and his mother, both mentally and physically. His biggest fear was turning into his father. Steve didn’t know Howard but he heard the many stories of how horrible he was to his wife and only son. And Steve looked at Tony and he could never find an ounce of Howard in him. He was nothing like him.
He worked on her clit before slipping a finger into her core. Torunn groaned and Harley paused but she insisted he proceed. Then he slipped in another finger, curling them hoping to get her off. She came around his fingers, arching her back.
suck me off.” He emphasized.
Harley broke the silence, arms folded over his chest and today he happened to look too much like Steve. “So, are you guys just gonna stare at each other all day, or…?”
“You guys are so mean to me. Why am I even friends with you two?”
Tony was the only person who hadn’t shown up and everyone found it odd when this event was solely his idea to begin with. Pepper was able to quash everyone’s concerns however, claiming Tony was a little bit under the weather today. She knew that wasn’t real reason behind his absence. Tony had informed her about the incident with Stephen and she knew this wasn’t her business to tell. She would lie for Tony no problem. She always had his back.
she thought
“Are you truly happy, Torunn? You know as my firstborn you will be the ruler of Asgard one day. You’ll be Queen. It will never be for your brother to claim.” Thor had changed a lot of laws when he became King. One of the first laws was the succession of the crown and the passing of power. The firstborn child, whether male or female would be the heir to the throne. He saw the amount of destruction that came forth as a result of Hela and himself fighting for the throne. She was the first born child and believed for years that she would rule after Odin until Thor was born. He didn’t want that for his kids and even though Torunn had been an only child all her life, everyone knew that a son born to the King and Queen would always be a topic of discussion. He assured her however, the throne was hers.
All the attention on his hole, left Peter’s erection twitching beneath him and he used a hand to get himself off. It wasn’t helping and he eventually moaned out, “Please Wade, just…” He was trying to find the right word. “…fuck me. Please.”
Pepper brings Morgan and Nicky to see Tony twice a month. She and Steve drive together but Steve stays in the car. He doesn’t want to see Tony. He doesn’t want to see the man that caused him so much pain all those years ago. He doesn’t want to see the man that tried to take his son away from him. And Pepper understands that so she doesn’t mind bringing little Nicky along with her to their visits to Tony. Steve's mind is at ease too because he’s just outside in the car. Nicky is with someone he trusts. Tony is a room full of people and multiple guards watching him.
And as if on cue, Amelia entered the room with Morgan close behind. Morgan was stunned. She hadn’t expected to find her brother and his friend in the common living area. She quickly hid something in her backpack while Amelia greeted the duo for them. Peter noticed that but didn’t think much of it. Whatever it was he was sure Morgan had it under control. She was the most responsible one out of the 3 of them; Harley and Peter. He wouldn’t put it pass her to handle whatever was going on. They were in the next room when Peter spoke again, realizing how flustered Michelle was looking when he put his attention back on her.
“You two never told us how Volgograd was.” Laura began.
Across the room, T’challa was catching up with Sam and Bucky. Nakia was busying herself socializing with guests and Okoye following close behind her. T’challa’s son, Prince Azari and Winter had just run off together and he implied that they might have just been in the presence of the future King and Queen of Wakanda. It was obvious the two children had become good friends in their few years of knowing each other and Bucky admitted that he wasn’t opposed to the idea. T’challa then suggested he visit Wakanda soon if not to see the country again but to introduce Winter to the country and know the land, if he intended for her to be Queen one day. Bucky was always welcomed in Wakanda. Sam joked about gaining the royal treatment if Winter was made Queen. T’challa wasn’t amused.
“Thank you.” Wade then excused himself, running to Peter’s side, pulling him into a proper hug.
floor of their home. Tony had been running way behind on preparations this year for his annual Christmas party given the past two months of events and helping Anna settle in. Everything she was now seeing was all new to her, wondering if Christmas in the Stark household was always this crazy and extravagant, two weeks before said holiday. Tony was running late.
Tony thought they were the weirdest couple ever and he never missed an opportunity to let them know but who was he to judge? They were happy and that’s all that mattered. They lived close by and Tony would always welcome them so they could catch up. Bruce hugged Tony first, he was a hugger. The complete opposite of everything the Hulk was and Bruce had struggled with balancing the two for a long time before Nat came into his life. They had only been dating officially for 3 years now but it felt like forever. Their strange dynamic worked. Nat got the love and family she always wanted – given she couldn’t have kids of her own – through Nathan, and Bruce got someone that loved all of him; the good, the bad and the green. He truly believed he would never find someone to care for him the way Nathan’s mother Betty Ross once did. As a result of that he didn’t let himself care for Natasha at first, thinking one day she would get tired of it and leave just like Betty did. Overtime however, he became conscious of the fact that if things ever went sideways in their relationship the reason would be anything but that as she had her own demons fighting as well.
He grabbed the vitamins off the shelf, turned around but watched them fall to the ground when he bumped into someone. He almost shrieked when he saw Stephen Strange before him. The man whose baby he was currently pregnant with. Of course. He hadn’t seen him, not once in the past few weeks but today had to be the day he’d run into him. Tony groaned. He was having such a shit day.
“Oh.”
Sam decided to try apologizing again to Bucky. He’d been constant with his apologizes but Bucky wouldn’t waver, and Sam was starting to think he needed to do some form of grand gesture to win his husband over. That’s why he was standing outside of their front door but hesitant to knock or ring the doorbell.
Tony had to stop him right there. “It’s still weird Rhodey.” He wondered if this was Rhodey’s mid-life crisis.
“You remember we told you, your mother had a difficult labour with Peter and Paige – her name was going to be Paige.” Steve explained. The trio nodded for confirmation. They knew the circumstances of their mother’s last delivery. Tony’s heart had stop. Steve directed his next words to Peter. “You and your sister were having trouble breathing. The doctors didn’t get her out in time, and we lost her...”
Without a second thought, Steve jumped out of her bed and began searching for his clothes and throwing them on when he did. He could see from the curtains that it was still very early in the morning. Gosh, he was supposed to get home to put Morgan to bed. Steve grabbed anything else he didn’t have on and was heading out Nat’s room door. He found his keys and wallet still in his pants pockets.
That’s what Morgan told Nathan. But Morgan had another working theory that she hadn’t told anyone. What if they were working together? What If Nat and Remy had done the deed together and that’s what Remy meant by
“I won’t.” Wade promised, taking both of his hands in his. “I can’t take watching you from a far anymore. Not again.” He confessed.
That shook Peter. “No. I can’t even get pregnant.” That was ridiculous. Tony was giving him a knowing look. “Wait. I can’t, can I?”
Steve returned the smile, which he, in that moment realized, looked identical to Tony’s but on his daughter’s face. “If you two are going to plot how you are going to kill me and your mom, you might want to close the door.” He lectured.
Remy then found his voice. “I’m forever in your debt Steve, you and Tony for helping us – me…” He quickly corrected himself and extending a hand in offer of a handshake, he had yet to formally thank either of Anna’s parents prior to this moment. “…get out of this mess.” He finished and Steve met him halfway for the handshake while nodding in agreement. They had really helped Remy out because even experienced killers made mistakes, made slip-ups.
Tony was busy cutting up some more seasonings when he saw Peter get of the elevator. “Hey honey.”
“What? What happened?”
“Miss Caffrey. Unless you have any evidence that can prove these records invalid.” The judge addressed her and Caffrey stayed quiet. “Then you may continue Mr. Tate.”
“But that’s not me. And if I’m being honest, I only started messing around with her last year to take my mind off the fact that I couldn’t have you anymore.” He confessed. It took Steve a year and two months after the official divorce to start moving on from Tony. He saw Tony’s eyes sadden. They’d been ruined. How could they come back from this? “I felt lost, lonely, a little depressed.” Then he fell back on Sharon which brought him more trouble than anything else he could have asked for. “It was stupid of me to do that.”
Wade:
Goll-Eee. My ideas always start off so good and then they turn to do-do (shit). Do your worst in the comments but I'm already aware of how bad this fic is...
By the end of his speech, Sam was very much assured. “Thanks man.” He said it honestly. His words were comforting. T’challa meant well.
“Because that baby would be a part of you. I’ll love him or her regardless.” That was true. It was something he’d have to learn to deal with, to handle but he’d do it because that innocent baby would be half Tony Stark.
text to Wade for just today. Since Tony had scared Wade off, Peter hadn’t been able to reach him. He wasn’t responding to his texts. He wasn’t responding to his calls. And he didn’t show up on the roofs anymore when he patrolled the city at nights. He supposed he shouldn’t be mad. He was only doing what his mother had asked of him. His mom did threaten him and Peter hated him for it. But when did Wade Wilson start taking orders from people?
“And don’t bother peeking out the blinds. I told Friday not to open any until you were in the backyard.” Steve countered once he saw Tony's eyes shift over to their bedroom's blinds.
After he got back Nicky that day in court, Steve stayed with Sam and Bucky. He didn’t see why he’d ever leave when he realized he had two men who loved him and his son so much. One year into the relationship and they got married. It wasn’t common to have a three-person marriage, but they made it work. Steve dropped Rogers and took both their names. Steve Wilson-Barnes. And a few months later and he gave Nicky their name too. They were a family after all and fast forward a bit and he was pregnant, with not one but two babies. Lucky for him, one was Sam’s and one was Bucky’s.
Maria had cooked and she was almost through setting the table when Friday announced that Steve was here. Morgan and Peter were already taking their seats at the table and Maria was placing the final dish on the table.
Tony sighed, putting the knife down. “Pep. Tell me I did the right thing here because Peter hasn’t stop guilt-tripping me for it.”
“We outgrew each other.” Amelia explained, not meeting her mother’s eyes.
Their hands roamed each other’s bodies and Tony bit down on Steve’s bottom lip to stop him from doing any more than fondling. He wanted to finish their conversation. “Seriously, Steeb.” Tony was butchering his name. “I miss my babies.”
“You are with child, mother?” she searched their faces for confirmation. Her mother nodded. “Just 4 months along. A boy.”
"I wanted us to see a councilor and figure out our marriage but Alex just wanted a divorce and money so he could leave. I wouldn't let him take Peter. He was clearly mentally ill and I wouldn't let my son be raised by a psychopath."
“On it sir.” Friday responded within the second. Tony then addressed Peter who was still frozen in the doorway. “Peter? Sweetie, I need you to call your dad.”
“Never know until you try.” Stephen quipped, slipping a hand into his pajama pants. Tony grabbed the hand that was descending, shooting him a glare.
Lila stopped her right there, speaking her next words with lure, suggestiveness and confidence. “I’m pass that but if he wanted to have sex again, I’m not saying I would deny him.”
“That’s nice. My mom loves you guys more than she loves me, her only child.” It was true. Maria Stark adored the only three grandkids she had and they appreciated her just the same. She was the only living grandparent they had between Tony and Steve. Joe and Sarah Rogers passed one after the other years before Steve even met Tony and Howard Stark passed away in an unfortunate car accident 6 years prior to Harley’s birth.
Tate doesn’t let her finish. “I rest my case.”
Steve drew his tongue out of Tony’s mouth, pressed his nose against his and stared into his brown orbs as he came, shooting wave after wave of cum inside him with each sloppy thrust. Tony gasped and Steve captured his bottom lip between his teeth. Neither of them moved. Steve tried his best to keep his weight off the twins. He stayed buried inside him as his cock soften and Tony pulsed around him. He didn’t stay soft for long which made Steve give him a look. A look that said he wanted to go again. Tony gave him another look in response.
She saw Harley’s mouth fall open. That was huge deal and not something they should discuss lightly. “Torunn, please don’t abandon your birth right for me.”
“Sure,” Michelle stated, nonchalantly. She didn’t see Peter as anything else but a friend. She had eyes for someone else but she was too afraid of rejection to pursue it.
“I never stopped.”
But not like this. Not with Steve. He had a whole family with Pepper. And no other baby that wasn’t his and Pepper’s would fit into this ideal he had. So what was it that Steve was saying? He can’t afford it?
“What do you think honey?” Tony asked her, placing a pair of bunny ears on top of her head that also had a crown on one ear.
“Do you still love Rhodey?” Pepper inquired. Where did her husband fit in with her new found feelings for a woman?
“No. I trust your instincts. Look into it.”
Morgan smiled sadly. She had no issues with still living at home before she’d decided she wasn’t going to college anymore and the incident at the Christmas party. Now, however, her home didn’t even feel like home and she didn’t want to be there anymore. Things had changed.
“So, what happened?” Steve implored.
“I promise I won’t touch you baby,” he explained because they didn’t have any restraints downstairs and he had to make an effort now to not touch him. Steve reached out blindly for Tony once the blindfold was on. Tony scouted over into his personal space and pressed his lips to his. He could feel the softness of his full beard on his upper lip and chin. Steve hated having a beard but Tony liked it so he resisted from shaving every chance he got. Tony cupped his face between his hands, pulled the blindfold from off his eyes, through his hair – he brushed it out of his face – and off his head, completely, tossing it to the side. Steve’s eyes blinked open and he stared at Tony confused.
Steve shook his head, handing him another tissue from the box that had been resting on his coffee table before them. His living room was relatively dark except for a lamp by the sofa on a side table. Tony hadn’t gotten a chance to survey the room properly upon his arrival as he’d never been over prior to this night. The apartment was lovely however, from what he had seen; it felt like Steve as odd as that sounded.
He circled the living room after which he journeyed to the bedrooms. The first one, Peter had to guess was what Wade was working on for Ellie. It didn’t have much, just a bed, a few toys and a couple of other items. Peter remembered Wade talking about setting things up for Ellie. He had said he didn’t know what he was doing, spending hours online trying to figure out what 5-year-olds liked. He was trying and it showed. Then Peter went to the second bedroom, Wade’s and he found himself in his closet, running his fingers over his Deadpool suit. Then he was looking at a post-it board on his wall, that had things he needed to do, people he needed to kill, one picture of a baby girl, he assumed was Ellie and a picture of a little boy that looked at lot like Wade.
And Anna finally let her hate go when she realized Hammer really did steal her away, Tony and Steve didn’t abandon her, and she was happy to have them in her life. The only thing they hadn’t considered until a month ago was the possible tampered DNA results but as they knew then and now from the latest test; Anna, the corrupted young woman was their long-lost child.
“Morgan is bleeding immensely, Sir.” With Friday’s response over the speakers in Tony’s bedroom came a dim glow of light from above, reflecting into Tony’s brown eyes.
Loki approached him while at the bar. He could see his frustration in his features. “Something the matter Harley?”
Tony got to Peter’s room door first. “Pete,” he called out. “I’m sorry…” he apologized when it was Steve or even Stephen who should be apologizing.
“Actually.” He whispered. “I was thinking about getting on birth control.” He confessed. “And I wanted to talk to you about it first.” Because Peter liked to share almost everything with his mother.
“Cassie Lang doesn’t like guys.” Torunn reminded them.
“Just a week –” Peter stopped himself because no matter what he said, Wade would find a way to divert from them possibly having sex. “Why don’t you wanna have sex?” Wade was ignoring him and focusing on the task at hand. “Wade?” He called out.
“Well. No. Not really...” She stuttered. And Tony had heard enough when she finally finished her statement. “…but we have the baby coming and we don’t want to be living apart –”
month and what changes he could expect. But otherwise, everything was looking good and the baby was healthy and happy, with all that movement he was doing. And Steve was glad to know, the baby was okay, following that horrendous fall in the lake a few weeks ago. He didn’t mention that to the doctor though. Definitely not.
“Yes please.” Winter then went to have breakfast and headed off to school.
Steve didn’t know if he should let him in. The last time he saw him – over 2 months ago – he had pushed him in the lake and he was lucky no harm came to SJ.
“We used a condom,” Morgan began. Nathan was sitting on her bed, in her room. He came over as soon as Morgan texted him the news. He didn’t care that is was the middle of the night. She needed him. Morgan was shocked, she just showed him the test and he held her in silence until they fell asleep together. They would discuss it in the morning.
“Thank you Wade.” It was such a sweet gesture and Peter felt bad he hadn’t gotten anything for him in return. “Am I ever gonna see your face?” They were silent for a moment before Wade gave a nod. Peter realized he wanted him to remove his mask right now. He pulled the mask off seeing his distorted skin for the first time. He saw in his eyes that he was desperately awaiting his reaction but Peter just smiled.
“I didn’t know that was today.” Stephen remarked. Tony thought he should have known. It was all he could talk about for the two days which prevented Stephen from asking about Steve, but his boyfriend wasn’t an idiot. He knew Tony was purposely avoiding any discussions on that topic. “I’ll get dressed quickly.” He finished.
“Well?” Cassie prompted.
“But you didn’t give up. You didn’t give up on us. You tried. You tried for over 10 years.” Tony held back tears. Steve tried to win his trust back for years and Tony hadn’t given in once. “I can’t blame you for taking a step back after such a long time.” Because if Steve was to be blamed then he should be too.
“I guess as long as you’re not using him to get to Amelia.” Had Wade been using him somehow?
“Babe, you’re telling me, you’ve been with this guy for over a year and the moment we get back together you’re pregnant with
Peter could sense someone sneaking up on him as he overlooked the city. It had to be him. He hadn’t run into him for the past 3 weeks and as much as he hated to admit it, a teeny tiny part of him couldn’t wait to encounter him again.
I also apologize for errors in advance.
“You’re talking?” Tony laughed in disbelief. “
“Make good choices, honey. I love you, so much.” Steve paused. “We both do.” He added, thinking of Tony who he longed to get back to. They might love Anna most of all their children, but Steve hoped it wasn’t obvious. They’d missed so many years of her life. Surely that justified their overflow of love for Anna. Steve kissed her forehead like he loved to with Tony.
Steve released his hand, turning him around so he could walk him out of the party and unto one of the balconies attached to the 4
“Why wouldn’t I be here?” his voice stayed level, but his jaw tensed. “Tony’s the mother of my children.”
“You don’t think something may be happening there that she has chosen to omit?” Sif worried, ignoring the last of Hela’s statement.
“No.” He whispered. “I just need a moment.” Wade hoped it wouldn’t be a long moment because, he was so close to a climax. He just had to remind himself to hold off longer. So, he rested his head in the crook of Peter’s neck, waiting for Peter to adjust to the new feeling. Moments later and Peter said the magic words, “Move please.” Always so polite.
“That Harley seems to get around, doesn’t he?” Hela butt in and Nertha smiled, grateful her mother was in agreement with her. “I have said it before and I will say it again. Dear brother, why do we continue to mingle with humans? They are beneath us.” Hela chirped.
“Why don’t you just leave Tony alone?” With those words, Steve realizes how dense this poor boy must be. Far more stupid than he originally thought, and Steve lets him know that.
The crowd applauded. A rainbow of expressions filled the room, but most reactions were positive. Both their families were smiling with joy except for a bitter Nertha and a poised Hela, who whispered to Thor. “You have really changed things, haven’t you, brother?”
Torunn’s expressions settled with a poker face. “I do not.”
“Yes. I think Fury should start investigating us. All of us. Everyone is a suspect at this point.”
“Maybe.” Morgan was feeding into it too. Good. “I haven’t seen Stephen stop by in a while. Maybe mom and dad are working something out.” If even one good thing came out of this tragedy, she’d be grateful. She looked at her friends. They all had very different lives and very different parental arrangements. Amelia didn’t even have a dad or a second mom and Torunn had both her parents, King and Queen no less. She had it the best. None of them had to deal with the loss of a child.
“Mom! You can't do that.” Peter screamed. Tony didn’t look at him. Wade took it as his cue to leave.
When they reached Tony’s room, Steve asked Friday to lock the door as he rested Tony on the bed, and they started to undress each other. Steve then took a moment to admire Tony’s naked form. He held one of his legs and kissed it, each of his calves and then each inner thigh. His next kiss was for his hole, getting it wet for his cock. “You always taste so good Tony.”
“We should probably tell our parents,” Nathan suggested. He took his phone out, typing out a text, asking his dad and Nat to come by the Stark Mansion. Morgan texted her dad too. She scanned over the messages he had sent her last night, following the dinner, which she had purposely ignored.
“We’re having a meeting about Anna.” Harley clarified. He was sitting on his bed. Morgan sat on one of two armchairs before him and Peter turned the other one around to face Harley. Morgan and Peter stared at their older brother questionably after hearing what he had said. Growing up, they liked to have meetings like this. They, however, hadn’t had one since Peter was 8 but Peter supposed desperate times called for desperate measures and sibling meetings.
Tony was a crying, sobbing mess now and Maria quickly came to his aid, handing her son some tissues. “Stop making me cry.” He sniffled and everyone awed. “You make me so happy Steve. I am so thankful the universe chose me to be your lifelong partner and I am so excited to spend another
“My laughter equates to interest or attraction?” Torunn proposed. It put his attention back on her and away from his thoughts. She returned the brush to its designated spot on the vanity and grabbed a hair tie so her hair could be pulled into a high ponytail.
Steve had plans to meet Bucky and Nat for drinks. Steve got his wallet and keys, kissing Tony’s, Harley’s and Morgan’s head and Tony’s belly in two different spots before leaving. He didn’t get to see Bucky and Nat often, unfortunately because Steve spent most of his days at home with his kids while Tony worked at S.I. He didn’t mind that Tony was making more money than him, he’d gladly stay at home with his kids. Tony would work most of the day, while Steve stayed with the kids then Steve would work on his art in his studio when Tony got home, and he’d watch the kids. Everything worked out perfectly.
Tony’s eyes widen as jealousy and insecurity rose in his chest. “What model?” He wondered. “She won’t be naked, right?”
Chapter 32: Epilogue
Morgan couldn’t stop smiling. Her parents were back together and so so happy. “Happy Birthday.” She added, handing over the gift.
“I didn’t know it was going to be this hard.” Wanda went on.
Steve was at St. Grace’s hospital. Sharon had gone into labour earlier than expected. Rhodey had accompanied Tony to said hospital with the goal of getting his wounds – earned from the battle, treated. Tony had neglected his.
“I don’t know. Not many gay guys at school,” Peter reminded him. It made him think sometimes that he’d be single forever because everyone else was dating, even his sister and brother.
“No. The food stays. You go.” Tony ordered, jokingly making Steve retreat with his hands up.
“Are you and Mom working things out?” The question had been on her mind for some time now. Morgan was looking up at him with her big blues, like she did as a kid when she was begging for something.
“I didn’t know we were lying in this house again,” Of course his mom would guilt trip him like that.
“No.” He whimpered, feeling Tony’s metal clad boot crushing his chest. “The other one.” Tony was starting to think he would say anything at this point to save his life. He didn’t have another daughter. “Paige,” he whispered. Tony looked to Rhodey who was equally perplexed. How had he known about Paige?
“As much I’d love to, I really just want to have one normal year living with my parents.” She heard him scoff. “After graduation you can have me all to yourself. Day and night.” She explained, hiking her dress up and freeing his erection in the process.
Steve let Sam and Bucky know how much he truly hated them for always being right and Bucky had smiled; excitement present in his voice as he asked Steve what name they’ve chosen for the baby. Stephanie Grace Rogers. The first name was Sharon’s idea and the middle name was Steve’s.
“Doesn’t matter my response, you’ll ask either way.” Remy said, idling flicking a card from the stack he always carried on him. It emitted a pick glow. He was uninterested.
“Done!” Steve shouted. Tony groaned, running to the bathroom.
It would be fine though, right? They’d sit them – Steve, Tony, Bruce and Nat – down and they’d had a proper conversation about it. Nathan’s hand was slipping into hers, squeezing it reassuringly. She really hoped this went over some-what civil.
“It’s not cool.” Anna tried to tell him.
“Were you just waiting for my relationship to fail?” He had to ask, furrowing his eyebrows at her words. He knew Morgan didn’t quite favour Stephen, but he didn’t know it was this bad.
“Okay.” Tony said slowly, rising from his seat. Stephen was still out of it and he needed to get going. “I’ll look into it for you.” Tony humoured him and kissed his cheek. “Get some rest.”
Ellie became a buffer to expel any tension in their conversations. Anna could understand Wade’s nature, but she just wasn’t used to individuals trying to touch her and if Wade knew of her powers, she was certain he’d be more cautious.
Steve’s jaw tightened and his eyes narrowed as he folded his arms over his chest. Wade was starting to think he was being too assertive in his response and he began to shrink a little. “I’ll leave the party though –”
“That’s quite an exaggeration, brother.” Loki patted his back and pulled away from Thor who was smiling like a child who just got some candy. Sif appeared behind Thor and he let Loki know that Sif was with child.
“Dad’s an artist,” Morgan informed him. Stephen glanced across at her. Steve was proud of how much pride was in her respond. She really was her father’s daughter.
“Oops. I thought I was talking to Steve.” Tony jeered. He withdrew from Stephen’s hold on him and sat up again focusing on the model.
Loki sat by her on the bed, smoothing out her hair as she kept her face hidden in her palms. “Oh, sweet Torunn. Why all the dramatics?” Torunn stared up at her Uncle, a mischievous glint in her eyes. Torunn’s face held bafflement. “I’m not one to be fooled. I know you have feelings for Harley.” He clarified.
Tony picked up after the third ring on Pepper’s third attempt at calling that morning. She and Tony were due to be present at their long-awaited project tomorrow; 6 months in the making. Tony had been MIA and completely unreachable for a day or two now. Pepper was getting a bit concerned.
“Wanna use the bed?” came Wade’s suggestive tone. A shiver ran through Peter’s body for two reasons. One, Wade had scared the hell out of him. And two, he was getting sexually frustrated.
She had screamed enthusiastically, and Peter said her name in equally the same manner. They pulled apart and Wade smothered him in a hug, remembering not to kiss him liked they’d normally do upon greeting each other. There were too many eyes around for PDA. The hug was brief, and Peter was able to introduce Anna to Wade and Ellie.
“Of course.” Carol agreed. Tony didn’t need Steve. “I’m just glad you-know-who left.” She was referring to Nat, who had left for Russia a few days ago to stay with her family. She knew it was best if she stayed away. Her and Steve, together and separately had made numerous trips to Pepper’s in the past month trying to talk to Tony. Seeing them together only made Tony’s heartache intensify. He couldn’t even go through his heartbreak in peace without seeing the two of them together.
Tony stared at him in bewilderment. Steve couldn’t possibly be serious.
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean, why?” he shouted back.
"I do." He smiled reaching his arms out towards the direction of the voice. Tony drew closer and they shared a kiss.
“Anna killed Hammer.” Morgan explained, loud enough so everyone could hear, and Anna came waltzing over to her. Steve’s head spun around and Tony met his eyes as they shared a look before they both focused on their children.
Harley already knew he didn’t like Jaime,
“I’ll allow it. Miss Caffrey please continue.”
“But at this point,” he went on. “I’m thinking that we should just stop trying and let things be. We already have Winter.”
“You spend all this time, alone with him at his home.” Tony could hear the anger and jealousy in his voice, even with his back turned as he pulled on his boxers. “You’re always texting him or talking to him on the phone –”
“Sounds like a plan.” Steve noted. He and Tony didn’t have a plan; they just did things. It worked well most of the times.
Reviews? Comments? Kudos? Thoughts?
A knock on his front door drew Steve out of his thoughts. Today, Steve dressed in grey sweatpants and a white tank top. His hair was a dirty blonde – almost brown, the roots fully brown and he had a full beard.
“Somewhere around. You know her, probably pining after that Stark boy again.” Hela explained with great aversion. She could never comprehend her daughter’s fascination with mortals, Stark’s son especially. After Thor re-instated her crown following Odin’s death, Hela was known as a Princess again. She earned a seat on Thor’s council and was a major influence of what Asgard had become today. She carried herself at an even higher standard now and what her daughter had become was a low point in her eyes, especially for a God. Mortals were beneath them. Nertha was doing the most un-Asgardian thing ever.
Before everyone settled into the courtroom, Steve had managed a glimpse of Nicholas being passed from Tony to who he figured was court social worker. Nicholas would stay in their care until a decision had been made. Steve teared up at just the sight of him. His hair was getting darker but his eyes were still that baby blue. He’d gotten so big already and he hadn’t been there to se him grow. All because of Tony. Tony dared to smile at him when their eyes met. He also noticed a younger guy on Tony's arm. He didn't look older than 20. Pepper and Nova soon guided Steve into the court room.
“Fuck.” Steve sighed, flipping Tony onto his back and emptying all of his cum in him, filling him up to the brim. He then pulled his cock out, reluctantly, wishing he had a plug on hand for Tony's gaping, leaking hole.
And Steve halted his laughter with a kiss.
Tony gave him a smile. The reminder was always appreciated.
That was a serious allegation and Peter and Harley waited for her to justify it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go meet him.” She responded, heading in the direction of the elevators. Tony thanked Friday for the info before going back to the party.
“I didn’t know either.” He explains in a small voice because Tony is angry and he doesn’t like when Tony’s angry. Tony acts out when he’s angry.
– she was Sam’s, from the chocolate color of her skin to her beautiful head of tight brown curls and
“For five hours and 26 minutes and counting. Since 5:03 am.”
Tony thought.
“Oh good.” Michelle commented. She’d said little to no words so far. “I half-expected you to bring up Harley.”
Steve gave him a look of resentment and Tony was annoyed by it because Steve had a girlfriend, a pregnant girlfriend for that matter so he really shouldn’t be concerned with what was going on in his love life and Tony voiced this. “Don’t you have a pregnant girlfriend you need to get home to?”
Tony kept his head down as his servants footsteps grew faint until they stopped altogether. His shoulders hunched and he began to shake with silent sobs. Tony’s mother was one of the only people left in his life that truly loved him, aside from Jarvis of course, now she was gone. His mind swirled with everything her death would leave him with; his father’s growing alcoholism, his uncle Obie’s increasing interest in his inventions and the money he would inherit. He wasn’t ready. She wasn’t supposed to leave yet. In many ways he felt like a child, relying on his mother to keep him safe, crying over her loss and hiding away in his room even when called for dinner. No one blamed him of course, no one who saw what the Stark family was like out of the public eye.
Tony spoke his next words slowly, picking them as carefully as possible to keep information to himself, “My relationship with my father has always been, let’s say rough, recently things got worse. A lot worse. Actually my mother died and kind of pushed him over the edge… I don’t really like to talk about it. In fact I hate talking about it. It’s just-”
“Just a moment, I understand that you’re curious but I have a feeling it would be better for you to start small and work your way up. First, let’s get you settled in,” He led them down an impersonal hall, held a card up to a light on the side of the door which opened with a rush of cool air.
A loud banging against the metal in front of him made him jerk his hand away, “Rest time. Don’t make me come back there and put you to sleep.”
Now he was paused at a fork in the path he was following, looking around helplessly as he searched for any marker on the map in his hands that matched his surroundings. Just my luck, he thought, at least I can’t get more lost. Grimacing, he pulled his horse to the right, unsatisfied at his own decision but without much choice. He made sure to pay attention to each turn, marking it down on the back of his map in case he needed to turn back. He had just turned onto a larger path when he hit a clearing, he glanced up after making his mark and gasped. Around 30 yards away was a large iron gate, intricate in detail but sturdy as hell, at least it looked like it. Tony dismounted from his horse and approached the gate that was easily three times his size, trailing eyes at the rock surrounding it, trying to find a way in. He brought a hand up and knocked on the gate three times… Nothing.
Abusive behavior and violence in this first chapter, you can skip to the first break and be just fine.
Tony only stopped thrashing when the pliers closed tightly around one of his molars, looking into the expressionless mask for empathy and empathy that didn’t exist. In one swift movement, the tooth was ripped from its root and dropped to the floor. Tony didn’t realize he was screaming until his blood bubbled in his throat and choked him, the pain was incredible but not the worst to come, he was certain. Richard shoved his head down, blood pouring out of his open mouth and down his shirt, warmth seeping through his chest.
Tony’s hand moved to his temple, ghosting over the last place Steve had touched him as he cried. He faced the wall and slid his hand across his chest, the warmth of his mark flooding his body as he drifted off.
He carefully cut around the head, wincing in time with Steve and dabbing away the blood that pooled over his fingers. It made his grip slick, nearly letting the muscle fall back in place. Tony dug his hand in more forcefully, desperately ignoring the sound it made as he pulled the barbed metal out. The captain's shoulders heaved, gushing more blood that Tony made quick work of and between wipes, he could already see the wound stitching back together. The pain in his shoulder had all but disappeared now as he was more focused on the medical marvel in front on him.
“How does it work? Who’s Banner? Why have I never heard of Wakanda if they are so advanced? There’s a-”

Tony's mother is gone. What can he do to escape his shitty home life?
“I heard a commotion was going on in the house, figured you might need this.” Friday stepped to the side and pushed at the door revealing a Chestnut Blanket Appaloosa, Tony’s favorite horse. “Essam will keep you safe, sir. She missed you these past few weeks.”
His peace was interrupted as he felt a sudden shooting pain through his right shoulder that lingered for a good 30 seconds, before dissolving into a more manageable but still deeply aching, down to the fucking bone. Breath choking through his throat and stars clearing from his eyes, Tony realized he was sprawled across the floor, clutching his shoulder in one hand and fingernails scratched through the wood floor. He took a shaky breath and brought himself up on his knees while fighting the urge to vomit.
“I’ll leave you be for now, sir.”
Loki’s face had grown soft as he looked at the group in front of him, his hands slowed but consistent, “My magic isn’t really meant for this. I’m a God and it feels insultingly below me to play healer to a bunch of mortals.”
The sun had set and risen many times since he left home. He pulled his wool cape around himself more firmly, the air had gained a bite in the past few days and as reluctant as he had been, Tony had built a campsite with a small fire in it for those nights. It felt like he was admitting he wasn’t ready for this journey, he should have brought more layers, waited for a little longer, done something else. It was too late for regrets.
Tony will get to be his little shit self here, but he's in a very complicated place and is pretty scared right now. The whole team is multilingual, so no need for translations, Thor is just intimidating at first glance. Next time we meet the main team and dig a little deeper into what tony's plans are! Thanks for reading, comments/kudos/criticism is appreciated <3
I was debating a nsfw ending but I couldn't really find a way to make it fit? I might add an extra chapter if I get inspo
His soulmark.
The smile turned a bit bashful, Banner breaking the small silence before it could turn awkward, “You ready to eat? I was planning on making breakfast.”
He took a deep breath and rubbed a free hand over his soulmark, a constant warmth through his body. Even through the torture of the past -however long he’d been here, days, a week or weeks- it had stayed a comfort.
it. Someone to love him unconditionally, destined to be his other half, complete his soul. Just- someone who would love him because of who he was, not the power he held. Steve’s team was the closest thing he had to family -aside from Jarvis, Friday, and Rhodey- they held onto and truly cared for each other.
The man stopped and glanced at him with a hint of a smile on his lips, shifting his grip a bit but still leading on. Tony glanced around nervously and took a chance, it seemed like this mountain of a man could understand him so he might as well, “Where, uh, are you taking us then? Nowhere bad I hope?”
Example of knowledge? Brought blueprints but somebody left his horse at the gate with his belongings.
Nuclear power was tricky and frowned upon in most places, the North was sufficient on solar and wind power. It wasn’t exactly banned but Banner had given him the third degree about not messing with atoms. He had told him how dangerous it was, how volatile the element was, but Tony never was one to play by the rules. As long as the danger was his alone, it would be fine.
Tony stood frozen in the kitchen, blurry hyper-focused eyes fixed on his father, who had just thrown a plate through one of their extravagant windows. The damage itself wasn’t bad, shattering one pane and cracking the few around it, but the air was thick and Tony could already feel his heartbeat in every part of his body. Howard moved to another cabinet, wrenching the wood off its hinges and casting it in his son’s direction along with all the china he could reach. The harsh impact of the door against the wall behind him shocked him out of his stupor and his body took off, leaving anything but instinct behind.
Bruce eyed the red in his cheeks and gave him an understanding smile, “Being comfortable isn’t a sign of weakness, Tony. I can’t remember sleeping as well as I do with Thor, ever in my life.”
Taking small pieces of iron, a makeshift battery and slivers of Palladium, Tony began making his own miniature nuclear reactor.
Much love to you all, stay safe out there!!
“Right,” Obie snapped his fingers and Richard pushed the knife down.
Nat gave an affirmative noise, placing a red kit on each of the the end of each table, “Easy enough.”
To assuage Hydra, he began a few weapons with small mistakes that would render them useless or explode in the user’s hand, only perceptible by engineers like himself. But in the moments that he was supposed to be rechecking his work, he sketched a weapon for himself, something he had thought up when he heard snippets of the technology Wakanda held. Bruce would kick his ass if he was there, for trying something so reckless, then he’d probably tell Steve and they would be banned from experiments again.
“Cutting. Hope you’re not squeamish.”
“Tony!” His cover blown, Thor waving his arm with a flourish for Tony to join them. As he approached, the small crowd of people dwindled until there were only two strangers left, ready for battle.
“No, you will face the team first.” His imposing counterpart said in what was probably supposed to be a nice tone. Tony squirmed in the hold as they approached one of the larger wooden cabin-like, the lack of people inside the gates feeding the part of his brain that was screaming about impending doom. The doors opened as they approached, two guards greeting the blonde in another language, the three talking for a moment before one guard left in the direction of the gate and the other led them down a short hallway, opening another set of double doors. The large man gestured for Tony to enter first, then closing the door behind them. Inside was a large rectangular table, surrounded by muscular men and women alike, all of whom looked downright terrifying, covered in different colored paints and armor. His escort stepped before them and announced something, everyone turned to look at him and spotted Tony, setting down their weapons and standing up in their place.
Summary:
Sarcasm always was his panic response.
Why are you here? Seeking sanctuary.
“Don’t break his pretty little mind too bad. As loathe as I am to admit it, we need his intelligence.”
“Call me Steve here, my room is on the same floor as yours anyway. I’ll be back to get you for dinner, get some rest if you can.” The door swooshes closed behind him as he departs and Tony regards the fire once again. He pulled the cloak closer to himself and buries his face into it, the heady scent of musk and spice mixing with the woodsmoke in the room, relaxing him further. Eyes drooping, he absentmindedly rubbed the soulmark on his right pec to soothe the twinge he felt at being alone again. It had been strange to run away from everything you were, only to find the place you feared to be this welcoming.
Drop a kudos or comment if you enjoyed, thank you for reading <3
A man sat directly across from the entrance, long braided blonde hair and shaved sides gives Lightning Bolt a ‘what the fuck’ look and calls someone from a neighboring room to him, whispering into their ear and sending them off just as quickly as they arrived. Purple man watched the metal mans hands next to him gesture wildly, barking out a laugh as soon as they stilled and was rewarded with metal slapped over his mouth and a firm shake of his head. The man who had spoken before shot a glare in their direction and swept his cloak back slightly to move past his comrades, Tony’s throat clicked dry at the sight. Tony could already tell he was large but when the man’s cloak shifted back to reveal the rest of his body… he was absolutely ripped.
Tony whined when the rope around his neck tightened, reluctantly placing his bleeding feet back on the floor. He didn’t know how long he had been there, he had been drowned, whipped on his soles, another tooth removed, cut and burned. Now he was hanging from the ceiling, standing on his cut feet, rope tightening around his neck as his torturers watched his face turn red and blue. He gasped for air as black started clouding his vision and his head grew lighter.
(See the end of the chapter for
His smile turned patronizing, disappearing from his eyes, “Oh, I’m
“Thank you, Captain Rogers.”
Tony’s eyes opened to a commotion at the front door, pain in his shoulder returning for a split second before the green haze filled the whole room. The room descended into chaos when the group of superhumans rounded the corner, obviously injured. While their leathers were torn and bloodied in a few places, the cuts had already healed and closed of their own accord. Bruce launched himself off the covers and grabbed Thor by the arm, pulling it over his shoulder and leading him down the hall. Clint followed suit with Bucky, Nat guiding Steve and the rest on their heels.
The team at the table was no longer relaxed or performing small absentminded fidgets, sympathetic eyes turned his way but he avoided them nonetheless. Rogers turned to face them, switching back to what Tony could only identify as something his mother used to tell tales about, the whole table animated and speaking nearly at once was a bit dizzying. The person who had been sent off returned with what looked like one of the blueprints that had been in his bag, displaying it on the table and saying something before leaving again. The table dissolved into deeper conversation, so he just stared a place at the table where the wood had splintered and let his mind wander, barely registering the change of language back to one he could understand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony drew in a ragged breath and wailed, echoing down the hall and out of the building. If Rhodey was dead… he didn’t know what he’d do. But that fucking deal was off.
The Captain must leave for the first time since Tony's arrival. Developments in the friends are found.
Little wet spots appeared and fizzled on the metal Tony was welding. He scrubbed his forearm across his eyes and sighed, his father always said crying would get him nowhere. As much as he hated it, his father was probably right.
Shoutout to everyone who's left kudos and comments, been many times where I felt like abandoning this and got a comment that made me come back <3
He startled awake, already retied to the chair bolted in the center of his cell and immediately slurs his way through a tirade of insults directed at his uncle. Obie’s amused face comes into focus slowly, looking far too smug for the complete lack of information and cooperation Tony’s given.
“Don’t you worry about that, we’ll take care of Howard.” Friday winked and placed a hand on his leg, squeezing lightly. “Go now, as far north as you can.”
He crosses his arms across his chest defensively, answers short and voice clipped.
Tony bit his lip and nodded, barely restraining from telling Rhodey that he was his people too.
Tony recognized it so easily because he had seen it every time he looked down.
What is your study of choice? Engineering, mechanics.
The sun’s glow had started to show itself over the mountain tops and signs of the towns population were finding their way in the pairs path, just further into the compound than he had been able to see before. Early risers and shopkeepers called, “Heill
“Hydra was waiting for us,” Steve rasped out. “Nat, I need you to find out who tipped us off that there was activity on the border, they were probably involved. And even if they weren’t, I want to see them.”
“I don’t-”
“Shit guys, what the hell happened out there?” Clint was the first to speak up once they were all in the infirmary, skimming his hands over Bucky and swearing at the amount of exposed skin peeking through the armor on his torso. A pair of hands grabbed his own, holding fast and mimicking deep breaths until they were both calmed down significantly, the soldier brought their hands up to his face and pressed his face against them, letting go with a small kiss.
Obadiah clapped his hands together and smiled warmly, “Glad you still recognize me, son! Anything I can get for you? A drink, something to eat?”
“Rhodes-" He let the nickname slip.
“It’s the only place he won’t be able to find you. Trust us.” Tony sighed, they had never steered him wrong before, he trusted them more than anyone else in the world. He brought the reins down and started his journey north, unable to resist turning his head back for one final look at his home. His mother was gone. It was time to start over, somewhere his father had no influence.
A monster.
Valkyrie’s hand stilled and she glared in their direction, “But?”
“Mr. Tony, are you quite alright?” Tony drew in shaking breaths, adrenaline still coursing through his body and tensing up when J gently touched his forearms to gain his attention.
The captain walked carefully through the growing crowds, glancing over his shoulder every once and a while, shepherding him through the streets with ease. Only then did Tony realize that he could barely hear the footsteps of the large man in front of him, the deliberate steps avoiding dips or curves in his path that might otherwise impede him. Although the sun was steadily rising into the sky, bringing a radiant warmth on the parts of Tony’s skin it could reach, it wasn’t enough to keep the chill from biting at his fingers and nose. As more people flooded the streets, looking to make purchases from the stands lining the roads; travelling to work, transporting animals, you name it, it was happening, Tony walked closer and closer behind the Captain, eventually resorting to catching a handful of the deep brown cloak in front of him and bringing the large man’s head as close to his own as he would allow.
He brought the blade up to the entrance wound and cut the top layer of skin first, bisecting the area. The smell of iron was already heavy in the air, but now it lingered on his tongue and sat. Bringing the blade back heavier, he cut through the next layers of skin and fat, following the line he drew. Steve hummed in the back of his throat and brought a fist to his mouth, biting down.
If you looked at her for too long, you could see the slight shake of Friday’s hands as she passed the reins to Jarvis, her eyes betraying her sadness at his departure. The three loaded up, helping Tony onto the horse and leading the way to the entrance.
“I’m afraid Maria has passed, Mr. Tony. I am deeply sorry for your loss, sir.”
you came here, more specifically if you wouldn’t mind.”
Green patterns resumed above his head and the pain in his shoulder left completely until all that was left was an occasional twinge. He looked into the glowing green eyes to his left and lifted an eyebrow at the glare.
Tony bristled, they want undeniable proof? Fuck it. Give it to them. He wrangled off his cloak and tunic, twisting his body to reveal a mass of black and blue lines and splotches covering his entire back, “Courtesy of my father not long before I left home. Decided I needed a trip down the stairs for asking too many questions.”
He had almost made it when he accidentally kicked one of the worktables lining the area, cutting off his laughing fit with a whimper. The tears blurred his vision and spilled over his face without permission as he continued crawling into his bed, landing with a thud on the shitty mattress. Sobs wracked his chest and heaved him up off the cot, his whole world was crashing down around him. Years of his father’s mistreatment had finally bubbled over.
“Rogers, I can’t keep up with you through this crowd and I’m thinking I’m going to freeze my ass off before we get to the bunker.”
His uncle pulled a dagger from his tunic and passed it to Richard, “I have a permanent solution in mind. Unless, of course, you have /something/ to tell us now?”
Bucky’s shoulders were shaking and he was making a clicking noise in his throat that Tony assumed was laughter, but the murderous look he tossed Steve’s way was a bit off. It spoke of years of dealing with that kind of bullshit, not anger but eternal exasperation. Soon enough the whole room was cracking up at a joke that Tony wasn’t privy to but the energy of the room pulled at the corners of his mouth and he found himself smiling regardless.
“Yeah, that’s more than enough.”
Tony flipped his palms up, careful of the knife still in one, “So, am I cutting or pushing, doc?”
His stomach twisted and the gnawing hunger turned to nausea, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never had a friend in my life, never even met another person.”
Tony tries to explain himself and finds that life in the North isn't as horrendous as he was told.
Rhodey’s legs went slack first. His face was turned so that Tony could still see the agony etched onto his face, it fell away when the pain became overwhelming and his head hit the floor with a thud. Face slack and eyes closed, blood started pooling over his side and on the floor.
“Shit, how are you not screaming right now? Because this honestly looks horrific, Cap.” It may have been his lack of battlefield experience but the arrow sticking out of the broad upper shoulder was one of the worst things he’d ever seen. The skin was puckered around it like it was trying to heal despite the dark wood embedding itself in the man, the head was fully submerged as well. Glancing at the rest of him, he could see the semi healed cuts beneath leather, small pieces of metal and wood stuck in them. He’d deal with those in a minute.
Tony applied the last bit of plaster to the cut stretching across one of the Captains shoulder blades and hopped off the table, grabbing a nearby rag to wipe his hands off with. He rounded the table and glanced at the man’s now exposed torso in case there were more cuts but what he saw…
Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed!
In. Out. In. Out.
He slipped his tunic back on, turning to face this team once more. Leaving his cloak crumpled upon the floor and ignoring the cold as best as he could, “That proof enough for you?”
Mentioned Child abuse again sorry gang, we aren't out of the woods with trauma and tony :/
He jolts back into the present, “Uh yeah that’s fine, sure.”
Thank you to everyone who stuck with me through this, waited for the last chapter, or even just read the first part
Tony was again jolted from his thoughts as the faint sound of a door across from his swooshed open and more footsteps traveled down the hall. Steve was going somewhere? Tony glanced at the spare clothes he had been given and sighed, reluctantly removing his tunic and changing in front of the fire. The pale blue tunic hung off his shoulders and showed off his collarbones nicely, but thankfully still covering his soulmark. The deep blue trousers fit nicely around his waist and, after rolling the bottoms up, framed his boots like they were meant to be. Leaving his borrowed cloak, Tony found his way to the elevator and followed the noise on the first floor to a room he hadn’t been introduced to yet. He peeked his head around the corner and gasped as an enormous chamber room filled with seemingly endless walls of racks of armor, color differentiating as they went around the corner. In the center of the large expanse was Steve, Sam, Bucky, Thor and Valkyrie, still strapping leather to themselves, speaking with Bruce in what tony had learned was Norse, the language of the Gods. Although they did not look worried or rushed, dread settled like a pit in Tony’s stomach at seeing what he believed to be the largest and strongest men and women he had ever met rounded the armory corner, handing weapons to the main five and assisting in assembling the last of their armor.
“Rhodey has been with us for some time, just as uncooperative as you, such a trooper,” He kneeled down and pinched his friend's cheek roughly, barely dodging the snap of teeth that came after. “I can see how he became a General.
“Follow me then,” He’s already walking toward the entrance and holding the door, Tony gives a last look at the group around the table and follows, “It’s to the left, rather large building in town, hard to miss.”
Drop a comment or kudos if you enjoyed! Thank you for reading <3
“We’ll be back before midday tomorrow,” Steve placed a shield on his back as his face grew serious. “Do me a favor, Tony. Get some rest while you can, sleeping in the lab isn’t good for you, next time our Doctor might not be so gracious to let me know.” And with that the group strode past him to the door, leaving him baffled until he heard the front door close behind them, moving to Bruce’s side.
“I-I can’t do this anymore J…” His eyes searched every part of the room, skipping over his caretaker’s pained expression. “I just can’t, I want to leave, I don’t care where just away from here.” Jarvis nodded grimly, releasing his arms and retrieving a satchel from a nearby closet and tossing it onto the bed. “I’m afraid I agree, sir. I am only glad you’ve made this decision now and on your own.”
