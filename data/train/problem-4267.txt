Even more, I have read that some people quickly produce endorphins in response to pain, even quickly enough to be of use during a sexual episode, generating an opiate-like, euphoric response in the nervous system.
“Yes.”
“Dean, whatever happens, don’t let those witches take Cass out of our lives.”
Mills, her face wet with tears and creased with fear, startled when Cass leaned down without a word and put two fingers to the boy’s forehead. Dean saw a bright glow diffuse through him that seemed oddly familiar. Instantly the boy looked better, just a kid sleeping.
“But.” Jack shook his head and turned to look at them all with sad eyes. Then a thought struck him, and he turned back to the angel. “Is this about what the Shadow said?”
,” Rowena said. “
Finally, I reached toward Dean’s forehead. “May I?”
Dean turned on the lights, threw his bag on the dark brown couch, and turned to watch Cass close the door, cross the small space, and set the bags down in the tiny kitchen.
A warm, strong, oddly soft hand wrapped around him, and finally he dared to open his eyes again, to look at that God-beautiful face, with Cass’ blue eyes and the determined set of his mouth.
This. Oh God.
“Sure, whatever,” Dean said, nudging Cass away and then feeling eyes on his ass as they walked away into a gaggle of Jawas.
I have no idea what factors make Dean look like he could take Atlas’s burden from him and hold up the heavens—his bowed legs, his square shoulders, the symmetry of his face. But he looked like that now, standing in the doorway of some three-star hotel in jeans, work boots, a beige Henley, and a dark over shirt. He hadn’t shaved in a few days, I noticed, and the thought of dragging my lips along that stubble almost made me moan out loud.
“I’ve been thinking about happiness and you two.”
I’ve seen many images in so-called “beauty” and “men’s health” magazines (both of them savage to the human psyche), where men have a “six pack.” Dean does not, neither would I wish for one. Few men actually have the muscular placement for that particular arrangement, regardless of crunches.
“Would you like to watch television?”
“Yes, but the problem is that we don’t have tickets, the thing is totally sold out, and they don’t need anyone on the crew,” Sam said. “In fact, they’re being really protective about the crew because of fans who’re trying to sneak onboard.”
I knew I was frowning again, but I didn’t know why Dean said that.
“It’s about wanting to help!”
Cass closed his eyes when he came, pumping what felt like a quart of hot fluid deep into Dean’s body, and behind him, against the ceiling Dean thought he saw an outline of outspread wings.
In truth, I didn’t feel much of anything. All that walking had actually wearied me. I thought of lying on a bed, and the thought appealed.
The angel found himself pressing down on the accelerator as the car lurched forward. If he got pulled over, he’d deal with it.
She laughed. “Dorothy.”
Castiel, however, suddenly looked up, eyes narrowed. With a nod at Dean, he disappeared with a faint sound of wings.
“Nice to see you all have slept.” As I said those words, if the Shadow had come to take me to the Empty, I doubt I would have resisted. That’s a horrible thing to feel, but for one split-second I had thought Dean was presenting himself to me in courtship, and then I realized that of course he wasn’t and that I was an idiot to think he might have been; that shock of disappointment and self-loathing was perhaps the hardest blow in battle I have ever known. Ramiel’s thrusting the Lance of Michael into my side was almost nothing in comparison.
Dean shook his head and then drained his current bottle of beer in three large swallows. The bottle went back on the table with a soft
“Yes.” There, that got his mouth closed.
No, we were unprepared when human couples joined in what seemed almost an excess of love, only then to despise each other not long afterward. The ideas of familiarity’s leading to hate, of “getting tired of one another,” and the like are things we angels have had to take completely on the word of humans.
“No, we haven't.”
“When Sammy was sick, I would completely freak out. So I did everything I could think of to learn how you care for a little kid. I mean, we weren’t always eating great, you know? But I made sure he got juice and vitamins and stuff. But still, kids get sick. So I read the labels on everything in the drug store, and asked the pharmacists questions until I bet they dreaded seeing me coming.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean said, savoring it. “You were really popular. There was a booth selling little angel blade keychains.”
“Were there?”
Dean would very much have been proud of himself if he had said right away, “I will help you.” But the truth was that the mere idea that Cass needed his help—a human’s help, his help—just stymied him into silence.
Ah. I might want to explain here.
“It was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. Considering that you’re my omega, I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong.”
Oh, I might have made that skin from molecules, but it was bliss to see it exposed, to know what it meant to see his shoulders, his stomach, his hips, his genitals, his thighs, his shins, and finally his feet all bared to me. It was bliss twice to watch his eyes look hungrily on as I shed my suit and tie, shirt and shoes, and socks and boxers.
“You can’t just pull shit like that,” he mumbles. He means the love confession, sure, but mostly, he means diving into the Empty.
“Why? Because you think that things need to be even?”
“Look,” he says, sitting up, his back against the headboard. “I’ve got issues. I know it, okay? I mean, yes, there were some, you know, times when I thought you were kind of sexy. More than some. And maybe once or twice I may have checked out a really good-looking dude. But the way I grew up, Cas? I’m not allowed to be gay. I’m definitely not supposed to want to take it up the ass.” He shakes his head and swipes at his eyes. He’s in Heaven and still, he can’t be himself, not really.
“I want it to,” he admits. “Be a part of it. If you do, I mean. I want you to penetrate me.” He puts that in air quotes. “It’s just you were being all hot and bossy, and I thought you might go for it and I’m not there yet.”
Cas is uncut, the head of his cock purple and leaking, and Dean wants it in his mouth, in his hands. It’s wider than Dean’s and almost as long and Cas towers over him, yanking at the foreskin, biting his lip.
A flush flares on his cheeks and across his chest.
Which is part of it, sure, but not all. He’s about to answer, but Cas continues: “Do you know the pleasure it gave me to watch you come undone? I’ve never seen anything as spectacular as you losing yourself.”
“I thought you’d find out,” Cas replies and he ducks his head, his smile suddenly shy.
Here and now, Cas’ laugh is close and bright and then warm fingers are on Dean’s face, lifting his jaw.
“That’s what I want to give you. Anything. Everything. It was never in the having, Dean. It’s in the saying. In the giving.”
“Telling your lover how you feel is never a no,” Cas responds.
There’s a small breakfast nook and it overlooks a long lawn that leads down to a stream.
“We won’t engage in penetrative sex without discussion first,” Cas says. Christ, how Dean missed him. “But there are so many ways to make love, Dean. That never has to be a part of it.”
“Shut up,” Cas tells him and then two fingers brush his lips and Dean lets them in, confused, until Cas tells him to suck.
“Nice,” he says. Cas beams.
Most of what he thought about when he drove was Cas. Dean would be driving in the rain, and images would flash through his head: his legs tangled together with Cas’ as they sit on a couch, Cas’ hair rumpled and his blue eyes still heavy with sleep as he and Dean eat bacon and eggs across the table from each other, Cas’ mouth warm and soft on his as they stand outside, or his face nuzzled into the sleep-heated skin of Cas’ neck as they lay wrapped up with one another in a cozy bed.
Cas is holding him, petting him, and then a tissue is wiping his eyes, his face.
Cas is silent, his hand moving in small circles on Dean’s shoulder. His eyes look sad and Dean hates himself for that, for spoiling this moment for Cas when he wants to give him everything.  They’re quiet for a minute, while Dean tries to breathe away the things he can feel threatening to wash over him.
“Sam, what the hell?!”
“Do you remember when we took on that vamp nest in Monroe, and Sam slipped and you stabbed that monster in the throat?”
, he found himself adding with a sudden frown. Technically, he’d abandoned it in Heaven when he rebelled against the Apocalypse and was no longer something he could claim, but as it was uniquely his as much as his blade was, it was still something he could claim to “own.”
“Cass!” Sam said, looking horrified. “I’m sure that’s not true!”
Apart from the deafening noise of so many talking in excitement, it smelled weird: old leather, blends of perfume and essential oils, moth balls, hair products, and just general funk.
Then, to Sam’s astonishment, Castiel looked off to the right.
Dean let himself smile. “God, no. I'm just well-fed.”
He frowned at me. I hadn’t meant to speak that aloud.
“But you’re playing for me now?”
“Rake out the fluffy feathers first?”
The words came off his tongue only with effort. What was he now that he was agreeing with the King of Hell? “Crowley’s right,” he said. “You should go.”
I remind myself that in the range of my failures, that moment when Dean Winchester shoved a knife into my heart is small when weighed on the scale of the universe. I was a stranger to him, nothing more.
I haven’t just seen Dean naked, I made him naked. When I pulled his soul out of Hell and went to his body it was, frankly, putrid. The flesh had been ripped and bones broken by Hellhounds, but that was nothing compared to three months of decomposition without the intervention of a mortician. There were many contented worms feasting on Dean’s flesh, I can assure you.
“Yeah, a bit.” Dean finally spotted his brother’s head and shoulders in a crowd of much shorter Sams and several of what he realized were Charlies, and a couple of those were Dark Charlies. Jack was standing nearby, looking as small and bemused as usual.
Not for Dean Fucking Winchester.
“He’s in love . . . with humanity.”
“They are themselves orchestras.”
There was a pause, and Dean knew to open his eyes again. Castiel was beyond beautiful, and his eyes were glowing with a bright blue light inside. Beyond the angel’s shoulders, Dean could see the dark shadows of his wings rising up once more.
Wait, what?
Fraser seemed to get it this time, and Ray was about to breathe a sigh of relief and change the subject when that Canadian cultured voice asked at a volume just to match his own, “What other time has this happened, Ray?”
Dean, like almost human males, has an abundance of sensory nerve endings in his puborectalis and anal region. It stands to reason that stimulation there, in the right circumstances, would bring him sexual pleasure
The guy looked up from his book. “I’m an angel of the lord and your alpha.”
“A miniature harp?”
“Castiel.”
“You said brother, Dean.”
“And you think this all has to do with what, exactly?” Bobby asked.
Dean found he didn’t much want to look at Cass either.
Dean held up his hands. “You could what?”
OK, so this is done. Sorry it's a little short of the word count, but I hope you still like it!
They found Dean surrounded by a bisque doll that kind of looked like Elizabeth I, a Barbie with a ball gown and tiara, and an original G.I. Joe, all of them wielding bazookas, With some spell work from Cass and a few well-placed swipes of Sam’s machete, they were soon a jumble of porcelain arms and plastic legs.
“Angels resonate, which manifests in human terms as stringed instruments. Mine is a harp. Other angels have other instruments.”
“Happiness isn’t really what we do, Sammy,” Dean says. Then his eyes go keen. “Are you talking about a girl? Is this about Eileen?”
We were right.
“For an angel, to be out of step, for whatever cause, may raise concern.”
The angel looked even more annoyed, drawing himself up a bit. “I’m not in character.”
But he had known this moment would come.
“Jack fainted,” Sam said. “We couldn’t wake him up.”
Over the past few years, by which I mean a small planet’s rotation around a rather out-of-the-way star, I have been accused by other angels and a demon or two of human psychosis regarding Dean’s appearance, as though the fact that he is lovely in human terms matters when I can see his soul.
In the end, all the others had returned to their duties, and Castiel played a song of mourning and remembrance, his fingers stiff with shame, and guilt, and grief.
Dean was frowning deeply now. “An understanding about what?”
For starters, Castiel’s eyes kept getting big. When someone spoke to him, when he would see Dean, when Jack would ask overly innocent questions about how Cass was doing, and just at seemingly random moments, those blue eyes would get large and stay that way for a good five minutes at a time.
“Strike out at me? What about you?”
And then Dean was sitting on Donna’s dark brown couch staring into the shuttered eyes of his friend.
The Winchesters’ purse dog: that was his favorite.
It made no sense. It was a conceit of romance. But it was still true.
“I don’t think that was all there was to it. But anyway, I’ve met several angels now, and you’re not like them. They’re wind-up toys, little soldiers who need orders or they just start killing everything around them. You have a heart, and a conscience.”
“This is your problem, Dean, you have no faith.”
There was silence for a good ten seconds.
“So, what? This whole town is just gonna eat, drink, and screw itself to death?” Sam called from the bathroom.
“Were you thinking of some sort of love spell?”
I almost laughed. So many layers. I knew I was Dean’s first male-formed lover. I knew that it was more important that I was closer and had shared more than any lover he had before now. I knew even with lovers he’d truly cared about, like Lisa and Cassie, I was closer, I knew more, and I reveled in it.
At least now I had lost something I had not realized was horrible. Hope was gone—that particular hope, that is. I had offered everything I was, and Dean had declined. I knew he even felt bad about it. If all I had been offering were sex and affection, we would be enjoying each other just fine. But I could no more offer Dean so little than I could fly again. It was for the best that he knew the stakes for me. It was for the best I knew that I was not what Dean wanted.
Dizzy again, burning and hungry, Castiel focused on Dean’s taste and solid flesh, going past the awareness of molecules and cells, practically diving into the bright soul that welcomed him with a joyous hunger of its own.
“And the thing is, after I knew what to do, I stopped freaking out. It was even, I dunno, good to be able to take care of him, you know? Especially when he got older and hated being treated like a kid. But one sniffle, and I could make him soup, make him put on a sweater, the whole nine.” Dean shot Cass a look. “Not that I liked that he was sick.”
Dean swallowed his first sentence; he didn’t know what it was going to be anyway. God, he just wanted this to be over. But over for what? Where was he supposed to go from here? Where was anyone supposed to go from here?
I never liked it when Dean sighs.
It made nothing but sense that soldiers kept in reserve for decades, if not centuries, needed something to do to remain in synch with each other. You couldn’t let a militia just roam around doing whatever and then expect them to snap back into rank and file. They needed very much to keep in touch, but boot camp couldn’t go on literally forever.
Not long ago, even after Dean lashed out at me in anger, I was able to stand with him and Sam as they addressed “the troops.” That was a moment of pride without any chance of sin. That was a hint, a taste—so much more than I have ever had—of what it means to join. To belong.
“What spell?”
“How could you possibly know that?”
Cass looked at Sam’s hand. Sam urged it forward.
“Then—”
“So only an angel can help you? No humans allowed?”
“You and Sam and Mary, yes. You’re my fam—”
Now the focus of a half-dozen pairs of eyes, Dean looked at his brother, Bobby, Jo, and Ellen and shrugged.
“If you were in a female vessel, Dean would have married you years ago.”
“You’re saying that Dean and Castiel could love each other romantically. However, I know that they have known each other over twelve years, and they have not done this.”
It was something Sam had thought about before. He’d even had a class at Stanford that had talked about it based on an old barbershop quartet favorite, “Wedding Bells Are Breaking up That Old Gang of Mine.”
Dean watched the man, who was slumped just a bit in his posture yet exuded tremendous power, come closer while Bobby fired again.
As Sam and Cass had said, he was never touched in the videos. Most of them didn’t even show his junk, and even with those it was just a flash here and there. Is was somehow worse than if he’d just been spread out on a table naked.
But this headiness in feeling wasn’t a choice. For the first time, the concept of having sexual congress with Dean was daunting.
The sheriff nodded, backed away, then turned around and hurried to her police SUV. Watching her, Dean spotted Baby a few yards back, looking freshly washed, and a vague tension he didn’t know he was carrying went away.
Getting his harp now would mean a trip to the sandbox and possibly being killed.
Dean and Benny—bleh.
And his mouth was so warm and wet, with a tongue that seemed to be able to twist in three directions at once. And he was pretty sure he’d answered that old question about whether angels needed to breathe because the guy hadn’t come up for air once.
“Not a word, not a single lead.” She shrugged. “Except the videos.”
Dean noticed people looked slight uncomfortable as they passed and muttered, “What the hell?”
“What?” Jody asked.
Castiel raised his chin up a bit, then down, a maestro calling on the orchestra for silence.
“Because I love you, Dean.”
“That it?”
“All right, all right,” Sam said, making a bitch face at them both. “The point is, they’ve got another one of these lined up, and Rowena says she’s certain someone has put a spell on the event.”
Bobby tried to swing a crowbar at his head, but the man grabbed the bar, put two fingers on Bobby’s head, and watched an unconscious Bobby slump to the floor.
Dean realized he was witnessing yet another unknown angel power. Castiel would pull them out from time to time: healing, fighting off curses, annoying a cosmic entity. Here was a new one: Dean was getting seriously turned on.
As he left Room 1514 and returned to 42, no one stopped him. Back at the sandbox, he noticed the weather had turned colder. There was a little ice in the grass that crunched under his feet as he walked to his car.
Dean was on his third slice of “breakfast pie,” as the little sign had said. The crust was flakey, the custard warm but firm, and the bits of fruit and other things were delicious. He’d had to ignore the other “Deans” as he’d transferred the pieces from the buffet to his dish, but whatever. It was frickin’ awesome.
“And that’s what you did the night I was losing my memories. You played for me?”
“I don’t believe so, Dean.”
Sam looked over at the angel in question. Castiel looked back.
“Right.” Cass’ wing outline fluttered just a bit again. “The cherub made them crave love, and then Famine came, and made them rabid for it.”
Dean, praying to me in Purgatory every night, though I never once responded.
“Unless he means the two of us should start having sex.”
San ducked his head slightly. “It’s actually a cruise, and there are several fandoms.” Sam looked at his laptop and read them off: “
I nodded. “I understand, Dean.”
“He was uncomfortably friendly.”
It happened. Dean crossed his arms, though he didn’t tap his foot.
Castiel turned to face front in the passenger’s seat. “Thank you, Dean.”
But we are all limited to our own existence. As much as we try for empathy, human or angel, a central part of us counts our own life as the most relevant to the act of living, even when we sacrifice ourselves.
“That the, you know, end of what Sam is talking about.”
Dean came almost instantly, and though he wasn’t in heat he didn’t lose his erection or desperate need for more.
Castiel found himself looking at the floor.
The remaining host of Heaven despised him, as well they should, yet playing with them had made him feel something he thought he had lost forever with a bloody sigil smeared on the white wall of a beautiful room.
“They never touched you, not on the videos, and from what could tell, not at all,” Sam said.
Even more oddly, I could not blame myself for what had happened, though I wanted to. There was no possibility that Dean could have enjoyed my body and never known my mind. It had been a wise if disappointing choice to show him how I truly felt before we had gone any farther, as it was all I had to give and not what he wanted.
“I would be more than willing to risk the Shadow for Dean’s sake. My decision not to pursue the matter has to do with Dean’s feelings, not my fears.”
“We were heading to Ohio in Baby, going after a coven.”
And then I felt, as I have often felt, a different sort of pride. Not one of them, even Jack, found anything wrong with my words.
“In Boulder?”
More nothing.
Yet none of this quite prepared me for walking into the bunker’s kitchen and seeing a pair of wings on Dean Winchester’s back.
Castiel smiled, looking a bit like a puppy again, or maybe just a child, neither of which did much for Dean’s libido, but which was still nice to see.
“That,” he finally said. “That’s what you betrayed when you stood with me and Sam against the Apocalypse?”
“A warning.”
“I failed at—”
He turned to Cass with a frown. “You can actually wear other clothes, can’t you?”
So the bar, the autonomy, the shelter from the storm—none of that was going to make Dean happy in the real world.
“Cass,” Sam whispered. “You can’t leave him here.”
Wait, I’ve fallen into human terminology.
“You need to enjoy me like I’m enjoying you.” Dean took advantage of the confused look Cass shot him to kiss up and over his chin, then brought his hand back up to keep him from looking away again. “It was your ‘reluctance to partake,’ right?”
“You guys couldn’t find me for a month?”
Dean looked to Cass, and then there was an ornate wooden desk like they might have used in an eighteenth-century palace in the middle of the room with modern, ergo dynamic chairs around it, one for each of them. Dean figured the one on the end with the open handcuffs is for Ruby and had her sit in it before he snapped her in place. He noted the rune work in the medal. She obviously did too.
, John Barry’s theme from
“Or there’s something here so powerful it can hide from you. Great.” Dean looked around again, avoiding the gaze of a few dozen nerds who were checking each other out. Few were in “costume” today, so he and Cass stood out. “OK, we’re stopping in San Juan today, so I vote we stop looking like ourselves.”
Cas agrees to that and continues on with his “my own loves” and his “so goods,” as peace washes over Dean and he finds himself letting go entirely, drifting into sleep.
“I don’t need anything else.” Cas is studying him, head tilted. “When I was gone, what would you have given to have me back?”
“You are,” he says. “But I don’t mind it.” It turns him on, actually, but he’ll save that information for later. He kisses Cas’ forehead and feels a wave of tenderness. “Thank you,” he says.
Dean reaches for Cas’ waistband, intent on unbuttoning his jeans, when he’s shoved back against the pillows, a hand on his chest keeping him down. His dick twitches at the manhandling and when Cas lets go, he stays down, watching as Cas brings out his own dick.
“I want to touch all of you, taste all of you, feel every part of you,” Cas tells him as he fucks his fingers into Dean.
The kitchen is airy, with an old school gas range. Dean opens the oven to check it out before he can stop himself.
“Um,” he says, closing his eyes and trying to roll away. “I’m not sure I’m ready. For that.” He feels like a high school virgin, his desire warring with uncertainty and shame.
“Also penetrate,” he mumbles. “Later though.” He can’t keep his eyes open.
Which is when Dean gets it. This house isn’t just Cas’ slice of heaven, with its beehive and its large garden. It’s meant for him too. Some hopeful part of Cas built this place with Dean in mind. And if Cas was brave enough to hope, after everything, even when most of him believed before he went into the Empty that Dean didn’t love him back, at least not the way he wanted, then Dean can try to be brave enough for this next part.
Then strong arms are wrapped around him from behind and a soft mouth is pressed against his temple. “It’s okay, beloved,” Cas breathes in his ear. Dean is shaking. He turns in Cas’ arms and wraps his own around Cas’ waist and he just lets Cas hold him for a few long minutes.
“I want to fill you,” Cas says and his fingers are working hard and fast against Dean’s prostate and the pleasure is so great that he knows he could come, just from fingers and the way the man he loves looks at him right now, like he is everything.
Cas breaks the kiss, pausing above Dean to look down. Fingers smooth his hair from his forehead. “You are beautiful, Dean Winchester,” Cas says. “The most perfect thing I’ve ever seen.” Cas’ pupils are absolutely blown, the blue almost lost, and he turns Dean’s face back to him when Dean tries to drop his head to the side, overwhelmed. “I love you,” Cas says, and then one of the hands gripping Dean’s jaw in place is opening Dean’s jeans instead, tugging his dick free.
He leaves Sam at the place Sam’s selected for his heavenly abode, all shingles and full planters, the kind of house that will welcome Eileen home when she’s ready. The kind of house they probably lived in. When he pulls out of the driveway, he closes his eyes and thinks or maybe prays, “Okay, Cas. I’m ready.”
He raises his eyebrows at that, ignoring the drum of his blood at the idea of Cas wanting to touch him inside.
“Try,” Cas says, a hint of that command that Dean finds so alluring back in Cas’ voice. Cas slides back down onto the pillow and now it’s Dean’s turn to loom over him, kissing every part he can find, even the weird ones, like the crooks of Cas’ elbows or the elegant fingers or each and every one of his ribs.
“I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally confesses. And he means in the bedroom, sure, but also in general. He doesn’t know how to be someone’s partner. It’s deeper than that, though. It still sounds like his father’s voice, wondering what Cas could possibly see that’s so beautiful, so worth loving, so worth sacrificing for.
“You live here?” he says because he can’t think of anything else. He’s still out of breath.
“It’s not just the physical stuff,” Dean says. “I mean, it’s not just the anatomy stuff.”
“I should have asked,” Cas says. “I wanted to feel you there, inside. I should have asked for your consent.” Dean’s cheek is kissed, his hair is smoothed. “And you’re not a mess.”
Cas is a few steps behind him. Dean talks without looking back. “I mean, you’re into this, right? It’s cool if you’re not. It’s just I’ve never done this…you know, with a guy. Or an angel in a male vessel. With like more than one dick, I mean, and I don’t…”
When he opens them again, Cas is looking down and his smile is crooked and tender. He runs his fingers over Dean’s lips and Dean doesn’t know why it’s so damn hot that Cas is still half dressed, looming over him while he’s covered in cum, but it is.
Castiel was getting seriously dizzy with the images cavorting through his brain, but he managed to rasp out, “Do you want any of that?”
For the first time, Castiel looked angry. “How much detail do you want, Dean?” He stood up and walked away, staring at one of Donna’s paintings of a hunting blind.
“They’re all dead?”
“Can you tell what they’re trying to do?”
The next morning, Dean and Jack woke Sam up with a case, which turned out to be wraith, which sucked, and so it was over a week before they were all back in the bunker. Cass had had to heal them all up, which took all Cass had and more.
“Classic demon sign,” Sam said..
, Milton’s Archangel Raphael blushes at Adams’ question as to whether angels have sex, which I suppose is quite charming. Personally, I find the language more than a little tortured, even for its time: “Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st/(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy/In eminence and obstacle find none/Of membrane, joint or limb, exclusive bars.”
“It’s not always a matter of feeding, Dean.”
Castiel hid a wince, but then Dean’s eyes went wide and somehow a bit more green.
“Gorgeous,” Castiel said with awe, kissing his way down Dean’s torso. “When I reassembled you, I was worried I wouldn’t match the original, but this is every freckle, every shade, every shape of you before those hell hounds got to you. The only new mark is my own handprint.” The angel sounded smug.
In a dream world Michael had kept Dean happy with ownership of a run-down bar, warm and safe and dry while a thunderstorm raged outside. And Michael had added Pamela, a completely self-reliant, self-expressive woman who hadn’t been a romantic partner.
I just sat there. Looking at Dean right now seemed more impossible than flying at the moment.
“Yeah, because the window doesn’t open.”
God, this was giving him a headache.
“Now works.”
“Do you remember when you went to kill Amara?”
“Sam?”
Seriously, what the hell, Ruby? What has Sam been up to?
“Why not?” Jack asked. “You two are perfect for each other.”
Lips dripping with his own slick pressed against his, hot and fierce like butter, and then down his body again. “Better.”
“What does that mean?”
McKay chewed on that for a while then asked, “When is the briefing?”
Now, there was a thought. As old as Cass was, the sort of affect—love that the angel had known with Dean and him, to say nothing of with Jack, was obviously completely new to him.
I shuddered.
Dean nodded. Soon they were appearing in Bobby’s front room. The sheriff was kneeling by a dark-haired little boy lying on Bobby’s well-worn sofa so pale and frail looking Dean was worried he was already dead. He was sweating with circles under his eyes dark enough to have been drawn on with a Sharpie. The only actual proof of life was a faint, raspy inhale, then labored inhale.
Dean looked at all of them, half-shrugged, rubbed his neck, and then half-shrugged again. “I wouldn’t exactly say I’m repulsed.”
“No!” Jack took a step back. “I’m tired of secrets and lies. How are we supposed to fight God when we can’t be honest?”
Castiel was getting really good at cheering Jack up, Dean had noticed.
Sam scribbled some more in his notebook, trying to distinguish what he knew from what he felt from what he could prove.
It was wonderful.
As it happened, Mary needed to leave them immediately, talking about a hunter who had an emergency. Dean and Sam both looked dubious, which Castiel trusted, though he could think of no reason for her to lie, other than not wanting to come back to the Bunker and spend time with her sons.
“Nixe!” Madame Laveau cut through the air again with her arms, but gently this time. They had the spark. The coven nodded. They would be asked back for the second night.
“Yes.”
I didn’t want Uriel to be there, or any other member of the garrison. Though I greatly rationalized it to myself at the time, I didn’t want any other angel to be there because I wanted to be there. Or, more honestly, if I couldn’t be there, no one else could.
“I seem to have picked a poor moment to remind you.”
On very little, Dean and Sam trusted me, believed in me. Even when I stopped believing in Dean, when I thought he would betray us and everything we stood for, Sam stood by him, and so I believed in Sam. And I was right.
The thrumming got a little stronger, and Castiel became more aware of the fact that he was truly here, looking at this discarded part of himself, and there was no one else around, no one to judge, no one to make snide comments about “top-of-the-Christmas-tree Castiel,” and no one to talk about how he had erred on a descending chromatic scale.
Castiel looked at it in shock.
“What’s the matter?” Castiel pressed, head tilting again. “You don’t think you deserve to be saved or claimed.”
“Dean, what’s the very last thing you remember?” Castiel asked.
I felt distantly offended. “Of course.”
“Oh, God,” Dean said, and then the both of them were laughing. Dean ended up with his forehead on the mattress and tears in his eyes. It hurt, but it eased the tension in his shoulders better than whatever had been in that cup.
“Why?”
“What?” Dean demanded.
But son of a bitch, that mouth. It was making him become unstuck in time, like Billy, floating through a place where it didn’t matter how they got there or why. They were here, and Castiel was starting to taste more and more like literal Heaven—the Heaven where Sammy set off fireworks, not where Zach was coming to rip them new owns.
“What?” Dean glared at him.
But I had been provided with Dean’s specifications to the letter by what I had thought at the time was God. Now, it’s more likely the specs came from Zachariah, but it doesn’t matter.
The car went a bit faster.
“I’m not talking about success or failure. I’m talking about you, the soul I met in Hell, the man for whom I rebelled, the person you are in yourself.” Cass feathered a row of kisses down his stomach into his small, soft hairs. “The Dean Winchester I have been proud to call my friend.”
On a Tuesday, Sam and Dean left for a “milk run,” and Castiel, sensing the brothers needed some healing time, just nodded and said something about checking in with Heaven. They both agreed quickly enough that he knew he had somehow made the right call to stay behind. Blind luck was running—stumbling—with him.
“It doesn’t matter.”
“We are brothers, Sam. You know that!”
“Not now.” Dean knew if he spent any time thinking about how the chick in Sam’s motel room was Ruby, he just might kill someone. Maybe Sam.
Her chosen, Parisa, had been a mighty soldier, stalwart and true. Her rejection, Vuviak told me, had been kindly meant. I remember thinking at the time that I could at least begin to imagine the pain of it. Now I knew that to be a foolish moment of arrogance on my part.
“Not a bit.”
Ray nodded. “Now, I'm Catholic, Italian, and quite well known as a ladies' man, so it's not something I've had to deal with before, but I know what it can do to a man's career if certain rumors get started about this man and some other man. The guy doesn't have to come out of the closet for just that, just the rumors, to see that no one wants to partner with him, no one wants him to get promoted, and no one wants him around, you get me?”
He came back to himself while Cass was cleaning him up. Quite unlike the clinical touch of before, his best friend was being gentle, dabbing at spots with a warm cloth, covering his body with satin and apologies.
Castiel frowned. “I told you, the Apocalypse.”
“Oh, yeah. Well, maybe really good friend, not brother?”
When he asked if I had ever done any “cloud seeding,” which I personally thought was hilarious, I simply told him I had never “had occasion.” It was much simpler than the truth.
“You can’t touch anything there?”
“I want you to enjoy me, Dean. I want you to take every ounce of pleasure you can from me.”
When I walked into the kitchen to see what Dean and Sam were up to, I confess I had no idea I was only a few seconds away from almost ruining everything.
“Would you like to watch television?” the angel asked.
“Angels are not the Borg, Dean. But it was sort of an ‘angel thing.’ It was Metatron, actually.”
Cass tilted his head. “I feel like an angel, Dean.”
Dean frowned at him. “It’s weird when you do that now.”
“Hey, when you heal me up from something, do you do other stuff?”
The red light turned green, then red again.
“Take care of what?”
“Well, it’s not so much that it’s troubling me as it’s been on my mind for a while.”
Castiel stomped down on his anger. “It’s not meant to be amusing.”
“It was obvious they were preparing you for a ritual.”
And then he was lying on a bed of red satin sheets that felt like cool slides of lips and tongues against his hot skin. The relief was incredible, but so short-lived. He was burning, always burning.
It was as though the angel’s gaze actually touched him, a whisper of warmth that moved down his chest, lingered on the handprint with a proud glimmer, then traced along his flank, down his thighs and shins to his feet. Something shone in that blue gaze, and Dean half-thought about the possibility of a food fetish (which was fine with him!) before that almost-warmth was moving back up his legs and focusing on his (now quite tumescent) cock.
Dean stared at him for quite a while.
Such was the way of humans. They loved more than any angel could comprehend, but that love was more complicated than they could appreciate.
“Jack is wrong.” The angel shook his head, looked around the room, and then seemed to settle in place. “The Shadow’s threat cannot dictate my life. If it comes for me, it comes.” He shot Jack an irritated look. “There was no need to mention that.”
Cass nodded and got out his phone, then handed it over with a word. He turned and went into the kitchen to put up the food and make coffee. Dean sat on the couch next to his bag and watched them, dozens of them, while a mug of coffee threatened to go cold at his elbow before he downed it, and then a beer, and then another beer.
Sam and Dean weren’t in the bunker when he returned, but they had left a note about a vampire hunt in Oklahoma, which agreed with the half-dozen messages on his phone, four from Sam, two from Dean.
Cass nodded. “That is why leaving Heaven was complicated. Some objected who should not have objected.”
The time came to pack, and Dean and Sam both had to work hard to explain to Castiel why he had to bring at least one bag for a seven-day cruise, including a bathing suit, flip flips, and no fewer than three Hawaiian shirts.
“Yes.”
Castiel raised his chin. “I did. I touched you to save your life.”
I would like to pretend I wasn’t made proud when the word came down from on high that I had been chosen to rescue the Righteous Man from Hell. I took select members of my garrison (no mated couples) with me into the Pit. The filth and suffering we encountered just made us more prideful when we pulled him out.
“Fuck, Cass,” he whispered. “Fuck me.”
Dean leaned forward a bit. “It just sometimes occurs to me that, you know, you’re my best friend and you’re an angel. Don’t want to take you for granted.”
“I did what?”
The put two fingers to his forehead, not bothering to suppress his grimace as the cold malice of
Dean rolls his eyes. “C’mon, man. You’re an angel.”
. He’d known to expect it. An omega’s heart was designed to hold up to the demands of a three-day sex rut, after all.
“You’ve got to get him out of here,” he told Cass, who stopped scratching his back long enough to pay some attention. “You got to beam him to, like, Montana, anywhere but here.”
And then the angel was gone. Dean looked around for a moment, ready to leap out of the car and run into the restaurant.
A few hours later, he had a page of notes.
“I achieved release.”
But Dean.
With a moan, Dean turned his head to kiss and suck at Cass’ nape as his right hand slid with joy over a smooth shoulder, around and down a perfectly slopped back, and then down further to fill his palm with a firm handful of ass.
“Yes?” Cas asks, his hand loose around the base of Dean’s cock and it takes Dean a second to realize that Cas is asking for permission.
It takes three tugs on his own cock before he’s coming again and then he’s climbing, wet and sticky to drop his head onto Cas’ shoulder, threading his legs with Cas’.
“You mean when you were a self-sacrificing asshole who ran off to the Empty without, I don’t know, consulting anyone else first? That time you were gone and we never thought we’d have you back? And thanks for dropping everything on me before vanishing, by the way. I don’t know. What the fuck do you think I’d have given? Everything. Anything.”
And that it’s Cas. Everything feels sharper, brighter, and Dean hungrier. He’s desperate for Cas, for Cas’ hands on him, his on Cas. He wants this, wants it so fucking badly that it scares him, makes his hands shake, even as he tangles them in Cas’ hair.
Cas kisses him. He lets himself respond. He snuggles closer, lets his legs tangle with Cas’.
There’s a thunk of a body next to his on the bed, and then fingers over his eyelids, gently. He opens them reluctantly.
He realizes around the time that he pulls away with a gasp that he’s been both groaning and kind of grinding into Cas. Who looks flustered and mussed and Jesus, Dean wants to kiss him again and again and again. He settles for leaning his forehead against Cas’. Cas tugs Dean’s hand into his and laces their fingers.
Make love. Dean’s never made love in his life. He’s gotten off, he’s fucked, he’s had sex, good, bad, and mediocre. He’s even had tender sex back in his days with Lisa, but he’s never made love. He’s never been bared before someone, not really, not someone who looks at him like Cas does, not someone who makes him want to surrender everything: his ego and his arrogance, his hang ups and his self. He traces Cas’ cheekbones with his fingers.
They stumble towards the bed, Cas caught halfway in his shirt for a moment before he shucks it. Dean’s hands are on the warm skin of Cas’ back, traveling over his chest, fingers brushing against the hard nipples and over the wiry hair on his chest. He licks against Cas’ heart, pounding as fast as his own, and digs his fingers into Cas’ biceps. Cas forces Dean onto his back, palming the bulge in his own jeans before shoving Dean down, and Dean groans into the mouth that quickly covers his.
“Dean,” Cas says and his voice sounds low and tender and Dean gives in, throwing his arms around the angel, pulling him near, burying his face into the warm, sweet, bare skin of Cas’ neck.
“Then come, my love,” and the same command is in Cas’ voice. Then he’s shooting all over Cas’ hands and onto to his own stomach and his eyes finally shutter closed as Cas’ fingers keep working, right until it tips into pain.
And that’s why he’s here. On a bed next to his angel. Because what is his father’s voice in the face of a love like this? He kisses Cas gently.
“Cas,” he says, holding onto the idea of Cas building this house for them even though Dean got here and just drove in any direction but Cas’. He thinks of a stream full of fish and the perfect oven and of sitting next to Cas on the porch swing, holding his hand. He can’t look up, so he says it to Cas’ neck. “I love you. I fucking love you.”
“Well, I want to give my boyfriend a blow job, so maybe you can just let me.” The retort surprises him even as he speaks it.
“I can’t not be here either,” Dean finally continues. Because that’s the truth. He drove and drove and drove and Cas was still everywhere: in the rain, in the sound of the tires moving forward, in his bones and breath.
“Yeah, I kind of did. Crying during sex is a big no.” He’s trying to make a joke of it, but Cas just shakes his head.
“Jesus, baby,” Dean says. “You sure know how to put on a show.”
Cas is more eloquent: he’s calling Dean good and beautiful and his love. Dean tugs Cas’ head back up towards his own for another kiss, deep and kinda messy, Cas shoving as deep into Dean’s mouth as he can, Dean trying to unbuckle Cas’ jeans. A part of his brain is freaking out, telling him that he doesn’t know what comes next, that what’s happened so far isn’t that different than it is with a woman, except for the stubble and the body hair.
“Shit,” is the only response he can come up with for a moment, with Cas’ lips so near, those blue eyes staring into his.
“Where have you been?” Dean says, instead of “Hey” or “Nice to see you” or “Glad you got rescued from the Empty”. He sounds like a jerk. He feels like a jerk.
Dean’s drained, but he drops his hand to Cas’ cock. “Let me take care of you,” he says. He’s actually shocked when Cas swats him away.
Dean’s getting half-hard again, watching Cas work himself. One of Cas’ hands drops down to Dean’s thighs, shoving them open and then fingers are brushing against his hole. Dean starts to close his legs, reflexively.
Or it would be windy and autumnal outside of Baby and he’d think of all the ways they’d hurt each other, he and Cas, over their years together. The arguments and anger, the misunderstandings, the grief. That loomed largest: the anguish that filled him each time they were lost to each other. Dean thought it would fucking kill him, that last time, Cas’s final vanishing act and the memory of the look on his face when he told Dean that he loved him.
“Thank you,” Cas whispers against his lips and Dean can’t even think for what, since Cas is still clearly hard in his pants.
“You need to shower,” his lover tells him. Lover. That’s not quite the right word. Boyfriend? Partner? None of that means what this is: something he wants forever and always. The word husband floats up in his mind and it’s the only term that sounds quite right.
“Don’t even think about it,” Cas says. He should have guessed that Cas would be bossy in bed. He should have known too that he’d like it. Cas continues to play with his hole, looking fucked out as he stares down into Dean’s eyes, jerking on his cock the whole time.
“Do you mean it?” Cas whispers and Dean can almost hear the hope in his voice. He can definitely hear a smile. “The whole love thing?”
“I’m not bossy,” Cas replies. Dean can’t help laughing and he can’t help that it takes him longer than it should to stop.
Castiel was talking to a guy with five o’clock stubbed in jeans, work boots, and blue flannel that he belatedly realized was supposed to be him. Fake Dean was obviously asking for something while checking Cass out big-time. Dean strode over in time to hear Castiel explain that he was already there with a Dean of his own.
“Look me in the eye and tell me you wouldn’t have hooked up with Cass already if his vessel were female.”
Dean knocked on the door.
Listen to me. Nothing I did was good then. Nothing I did then can be mitigated.
Dean enjoys coitus primarily as a mutual, in his words, “click.” It’s one of the reasons he has no mental blocks with becoming aroused during onanism. He simply imagines a partner who is enjoying stimulus as much as he is, and he’s stimulated.
Dean gave her a winning smile.
“So you wouldn’t mind?” Sam asked.
“Who’s me?” he asked cheerfully.
Castiel nodded and took a sip of his beer while Dean crossed his arms and leaned back against the kitchen’s metal counter.
The segment ended, and Castiel waited for Dean to ask a question or perhaps change the channel, but when he looked over, the man was staring off into space, his face blank.
“I remember from my mother, she was really sad she wouldn’t be able to tuck me in at night.”
“Why not?”
“This man here could use a lift, Mr—” She looked at me.
Of the nine angels currently left in Heaven, four are coupled.
“Make that a couple hours. I’m fine, and don’t do anything until we get there.”
Castiel snorted softly. Trust Dean to jump right to the most important thing. Then he nodded and put the instrument back into his pocket.
Holier shit. His alpha was a fucking angel.
“Yes.”
There is nothing in my existence as an angel that remotely prepared me for Jack, for how fiercely I love him, for how easy it was to bargain for his life with my own, for how greatly I am concerned regarding him. Even the delicate balance of Heaven and the prospect of a reality worse than the Apocalypse somehow does not twist my metaphorical gut into knots as drastically as my concern for Jack’s life and soul.
Frankly, even naked humans having sex with other naked humans was, as I told Keven Tran, boring.
Dean snorted. “Last time we thought that . . .” He frowned to himself. “I dunno. Something horrible happened.”
“Two of my fathers are thinking about getting together. I think this conversation is for me.”
“Finally, we decided to send someone to the front door with a grocery delivery who would explain the order was a mistake. We set you up with a couple bags, you went up by yourself, and then you went inside instead of staying on the porch.”
So he spent the morning plucking his way through Donizetti’s harp solo from
“So we had sex six more times.”
“I can see your bright soul, the strength of you, the love and hate, the thousand times you have felt unworthy, unable.” Cass’ eyes flicked up and bore into his mate’s. “I will take every last moment we have on this world to cherish you, to replace the words you hurt yourself with with the words I know to be true. God chose you for me, Dean Winchester. And I’m going to take from you everything He promised, even your pain.”
“I had no idea what I was asking for.”
Thinking about it, Castiel decided if he were for some reason to give Dean a present, it would be something for his car, Baby. Perhaps a nice wax job or some new tires.
The answer was very quiet. “No.”
And this is my favorite part in all my fantasies. I anticipate it like a wave.
Castiel sat on the edge of bed, pulled the harp into position, put his feet on the pedals, and played a piece to welcome the warmth, sun, and new life of spring.
Frankly, Sam, Dean, and Mary were doing the work he thought angels should be doing, particularly since the Hell gate had opened to spew demons onto the Earth. Being a solider at their side was the first time in millennia he’d truly known (not just trusted) that his mission was just.
So while he wouldn’t say, if he were in a position to say anything and weren’t dead asleep, that his current mental state was pleasant, it was decidedly free from hell, demons, torture, rape, watching his intestines slither to the floor, and being burned alive (well, dead-alive).
Slightly anxious blue eyes looked over at him. Never had the hunter been so aware of the gift Cass was to them.
Sam scowled at him. “No.” Then he had to acknowledge it was a fair question. “No, Dean and I are fine. But it is about Dean that I want to talk to you—well, Dean and Cass.”
“And that still wasn’t enough?”
The hunter manned up. “And because he’s, um, my alpha.”
Late at night and after making absolutely sure Dean and Jack were asleep and Cass was reading some
Frankly, while sex with April the Reaper had been very nice indeed, it wasn’t physical copulation with Dean Castiel primarily wanted. It was just to be closer than they got eye-fucking. Angels had about a hundred ways to “join,” from what Dean called a Vulcan mind-meld to sex to literally occupying the same space.
But that wasn’t fair. Dean knew that even as he backed up a step. It wasn’t right of him to jump to any conclusions now.
“I sense no hex bags,” he said in the meantime. “Neither is anyone we’ve met yet a witch or anything other than a human.”
“Understood.”
“Human” Castiel had had sex with April, and Castiel had let them know a few times he was “utterly indifferent to sexual orientation.” If Dean were willing, Sam seriously doubted the angel would mind than Dean was a man.
“Back when she was human!”
Cass found himself smiling. The truth was he simply didn’t understand the need to own possessions. Whatever he came up with would doubtlessly be incorrect. Apart from Jimmy’s clothes (or their often-replicated replacements), the only thing he himself owned was his angel blade.
Dean tried to think of something to say to that, but mostly he was just looking at ridiculously strong thighs, an incredibly pert ass, oddly arty shoulders, and most compelling of all, his best friend’s blue eyes, which looked profoundly sad.
“You have no idea how deeply, how overwhelmingly I want to fuck you, Dean. God made you for me, and me for you. It seems almost insulting that I’m not inside you right now.”
“What was that?” Bobby demanded.
With a frown, Castiel wondered whether he included himself in that assessment. Then, with a deeper frown, he reminded himself he knew nothing. Believing he understood more than an angel could had gotten into trouble a dozen times, if not more. He knew nothing. He understood nothing. He wasn’t even a decent angel, let alone some sort of bridge between angel and human (his second-deepest, most ridiculous wish).
The thought made him smile, and then he was about to pick a real melody to play when Dean knocked on his door.
“What?” He ventured a look back, relieved just to see the angel scowling at him.
“Tell me this, this thing—”
He remembered crying. He remembered promising himself he would never, ever go off his suppressants again. He remembered promising himself he would flush his suppressants down the toilet.
It was only around thought six or seven than I remembered it was some useless t-shirt from a heavy metal band Dean favored I. It was only then, after that delirious near-disaster, that I knew I was just looking at nothing.
“I keep almost making it to sleep. I’m right there, man, and then I know for a fact you said something important to me, and you gave me a music box.”
“There is no need for this,” he said quietly, his voice a low purr. “I know that you are not sexually interested in men. Nothing else needs to be said on the matter.”
So, it was with met with nothing less than incredible relief when Sam’s notifications
I walked perhaps another mile or two before I thought of something horrible. Quickly, fingers almost fumbling, I pulled out my phone and typed in a quick text.
Dean laughs, and it feels damn good. He can’t remember the last time he’s laughed so hard. Sure, the fate of the world, blah blah blah, but everyone could wait a few seconds while he lay here in bed with his angel alpha and laugh at how the whole thing worked out: the barn, the exploding lights, a pair of incredibly blue eyes, and then having the first meaningful, mind-blowing sex of his life.
Sheppard shrugged. “Then I won't ask you to be on my team.”
He loved Sam and Dean and Mary. He cared for Claire. He admired Jodi.
Sam’s eyes got bigger. “Dean, that was six weeks ago.”
“Yes. It’s all the truer now, as we are all fathers to Jack.”
“Yes, it wasn’t a music box. It was my harp.”
“You taste like everything good,” Castiel whispered.
But what a new fantasy I found! Dean has been hexed—which in real life I would do everything to counter, but this is a fantasy—and he comes barreling into the bunker. Sam and Jack are somewhere else.
“He’s all right, Dean,” Castiel said, smoothing a hand over his bare shoulders and settling his palm against the handprint on his omega’s arm. “He’s sleeping at Bobby’s.”
So, the angel took the man at his word, leaned forward, and took those lips he’d stared at for countless hours with his own. He put his hands around Dean’s body and ran his fingertips over the harp strings of his ribs and spine, feeling gently for the nerves with pressure that Dean would enjoy. He pressed forward, allowing his body (and yes, damn it, Jimmy hadn’t been there for years—it was his now) to absorb the heat of Dean presence.
It wasn’t until I saw Dean and his soul—so bright, so much a comment on the rest of him—that it even occurred to me that seeing the layers of humans mattered.
Alone, Dean looked at his hands. They were shaking just slightly.
I want to make it clear at this point that I do not, and have never, watched Dean experience sexual congress, or onanism. I am only taking information from what Dean and Sam and others have expressed openly.
“Cass!”
Rolling into Lewisville felt, oddly, like coming home. It was another town with nothing remarkable in it, perhaps a little more suburbia than they were prone to, but refreshing in its sameness. After a nothing dinner at, of course, the Main Street Café, Dean found them an Econo Lodge, and the two humans hit the sack while the angel and Nephilim kept watch over Jack’s laptop.
All he had was:
He parked outside the Biggerson’s, trying to peer through the tinted windows of the chain restaurant, but only seeing lights on inside.
Dean dropped the shirt in his hand on the floor, grinned, and walked toward me. The simplicity of it all struck me as impossible.
Dean, his brother. His deeply beloved brother.
Sam nodded and followed the others down a corridor that he was really hoping led to Dean. He couldn’t help thinking that he’d almost died so often it was getting kind of boring. He tried to shake it off and get his head back in the fight, but mostly he just thought about how he seriously needed to have a long talk with Eileen.
around noon. The possessed doll had evidently taken another victim.
After everything settled and they were all breaking up to go their own ways again, Dean pulled him close.
“What do you mean, I’m not throwing anything away?”
aired, but . . . I’m sorry. I couldn’t get you out of there.”
There’s a swing on the porch, and Dean can picture himself sitting there, next to Cas, sipping a beer as the evening grows dark.
“Um,” he starts. His tongue feels heavy. “Um, yeah. Didn’t you know?”
“Yes, Jesus, yes.”
He lifts his own shirt off and Cas uses lips and teeth and tongue against his nipple, fingers reaching up to pinch the other one, hard, and it’s like a live wire to his dick. He can feel himself leaking, hear his voice saying, “shit” and “baby” and “fuck, Cas”.
As soon as that thought arrives, another chases it, sounding like his father. It sounds like hate and humiliation and fear. Real men, he can almost hear his father say, don’t get off on being touched by another guy. They don’t want to be fucked by another guy. The voice goes on and on and he can feel himself getting soft.
He’s putting the car in park, when he hears the words, low and lovely. Just his name and hello.
Then he totally panics and starts to step away, his back hitting the car door. Which makes him kind of stumble. He keeps his eyes on the ground.
Inside the house is perfect. Not perfect like a magazine, like the kind of house Lisa might have dreamed of, but full of light and mismatched, comfortable looking furniture. There’s a living room with a large fireplace and several sofas, a den with a TV even though he can’t really picture Cas watching it. He probably reads one of the fat volumes from the several wooden bookshelves.
“Cas, stop, stop. I’m gonna come,” Dean’s words stutter out on his fast breaths. He doesn’t look away.
When those two wet fingers circle his entrance and one pushes in, there’s a wash of shame that rushes over him even as he’s pushing back onto the finger. He feels Cas slip another in and it feels sort of strange, until suddenly it’s amazing, and his legs are falling apart and he’s keening, wanting everything Cas can give.
“There are only two,” Cas says. Neither of them moves for a minute. Dean takes a breath. He heads out of the kitchen, with its range designed with him and his cooking and baking in mind. He crosses through the living room to the stairs.
But nothing happens, so he steps back into the car, driving slowly, the radio off for once. It hasn’t been long when the road appears, sun dappling over it through the shade of fat-leafed trees. Some instinct tells him to turn left, so he does, crunching over gravel for maybe five minutes before he arrives at a ramshackle house.
“Look, I’m sorry I’m ruining our first time with this shit and I haven’t even gotten you off. I just need you, okay? Like air, or water, or my arms, or hell, any piece of me. I know I’m a mess. But I need you. Just don’t give up.” And then he’s full-on crying, like ugly crying with snot and strange sounds and his whole body shaking. He has officially ruined sex with the only person he’s ever loved like this, bone deep and true.
“I know. I know you, Dean,” Cas says. “I know every fiber of your being. I know your fear and your courage, and the depths of your love.”
Dean listened as he unpacked. He figured he’d be the one wearing the Hawaiian shirts in Castiel’s luggage, so he was more interested in the bits and pieces of weaponry he’d hidden away among his socks, shoes, and underwear. Then he slipped the demon blade from between the lining and outer leather, stood up, and looked around.
Dean had to shrug. “None, until now. You need to get out of character.”
Sam knew their personal, domestic issues were nothing in the face of saving the world a time or two or three, and he personally didn’t believe his development had been arrested at all. He and Dean, if anything, were old for their ages, considering what they’d seen and done. Too old.
“You bent me over the furniture!”
I really don’t care how. In the thousands of fantasies I’ve had now, my body remains somewhat vague. It is the image of Dean in the throes of sexual pleasure caused by touching me that enthralls me.
“I couldn’t help overhearing. I am a celestial entity.”
The angel shook Sam off and turned to Dean squarely. “My advice is for you to resume your life and see if any memories surface on their own, which they shouldn’t. But the magic involved was, in a word, complex.”
“Dean would have been your exception.”
“Nah. Bags of blood in the icebox, a couple bodies buried in the backyard. Probably the original owners.”
“A moment, please, Dean,” I said.
“You’re beautiful,” the angel, if he were really an angel, growled. “I couldn’t get this close before. The scent of you.”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean looked around the motel room and realized they were in the Super 8 off I229. “Look, I’ll be there in an hour, OK?”
Castiel looked over at Sam, who shrugged, then back at Dean to ask, “What?”
His harp was in the room.
For the next two days (Earth time), they played, though only Castiel stayed the whole time. Two violins came and went together, an acoustic guitar stepped in several times. A Celtic harp, a Hardanger fiddle, and a viola came and went.
Tall, six feet, ten inches. Solid gold from the crown to the pedal box. Each string wasn’t spun from poets’ sinews, but they were a mixture of steel and silk only angels could achieve. Cass should know, considering the decades he’d spent learning the best techniques.
So Dean was more than a little surprised when Cass shoved him back on the bed with a touch of angel strength, not hurting him all, but definitely making clear Dean could do nothing about it.
Sam looked torn.
The trappings were more than comforting: the aluminum table with that sharp ridge around the edge, the aluminum and vinyl chairs, the smells of sausage and waffle batter and (just a hint) of disinfectant. As Castiel sat around the table with Sam, Dean, Mary, and Wally, he felt completely at home.
“I want to please you,” the angel said, soft lips moving against his stomach. “You deserve so much more than I can give you.”
Dean Winchester woke up sore, the good kind, with a burn from repetitive use of his thighs, tender nipples, arms that felt stretched out and noodle-y. Even his lips were tired.
Dean tried but failed to keep from pushing his hips forward. Castiel’s ozone scent and warmth were too delicious.
"Well, damn it, you look like a man who needs something so bad it's going to kill him. Bones said if you were any other man he'd prescribe shore leave on an accommodating planet."
Dean Winchester had known for years this day was inevitable. By an unusual stroke of luck, Castiel had not been with them the first time, and Dean had never wanted to go anywhere near one of those cursed clown shows ever again.
“No, I don’t have a harp,” Castiel snapped, looking away from Dean to the man’s newly resurrected mother, Mary Winchester. Dean didn’t press it, and they were soon all too busy looking for Sam and dealing with the British Men of Letters to discuss it in any event. It really wasn’t worth talking about, whatever the reason.
“We could fix that,” Dean managed to get out, for all that he knew he was speaking on cue.
“Seriously, Cass. Come here.”
Since coming back from hell, Dean Winchester didn’t have pleasant dreams.
“No.”
Sam pointed at him. “Yeah, that’s right. That’s all sex has been for you since Lisa, some skirt in a bar. And lately, you haven’t even been bothered to do that. I mean, seriously. Can you even remember the last time you had a conversation with someone before you took her to bed?”
In fact, thinking of it, he’d been more obedient than ever following that day. Had he needed to prove to himself he had no choice but to follow orders? If so, it had only been Dean (and Sam) who had allowed him to see his life of obedience was foolish. Or worse, it had been just plain evil.
Those slightly dry lips smiled, then Castiel bent down and pressed soft kiss after softer kiss to Dean’s lips, his chin, his neck, and back to his lips even as inhumanly strong hands lifted the hunter’s body up at the hips and slipped him over Cass’ hard cock like a sheath over a knife.
“What you showed me,” he said next. “I want that.”
“Thanks. Uh, good Charlie.”
“I do not believe that to be important,” Castiel said, his deep-gravel voice as steady as ever. “Dean and I—”
“Good things do happen, Dean.” Castiel stepped closer, which really did not help.
To his astonishment, God’s warrior actually bowed his head, looking exhausted. “You have no idea. None. How much I want it.”
“Yeah. Is that OK? I mean, you help out me and Sam all the time. That, I mean, you must feel pretty good about that, right, or you wouldn’t do it?”
“Say ‘cock,’ Cass. Say you’re going to suck my cock.”
That last one was good, Sam thought with a nod. Dean himself wasn’t the puzzle here, but what about Cass?
“I know how stupid that sounds, OK? You gave me a music box and said something important, and I can’t remember, damn it!”
“So, you guys play your instruments together to, what, stay in sync?”
“It’s not about being flexible!”
Castiel didn’t smile back.
Castiel sat up and turned off the TV.
With great relief, Sam closed the laptop, a real plan starting to hatch in his mind. He was going to do the most dangerous thing he could think of because, if it didn’t work, Dean was going to kill him.
If there is one thing above all others that I cherish in humans over angels, it is their lack of prejudgment.
“Actually, I'd like you to come with me to the pre-mission briefing for SGA-1's little trip to PX7-819.”
“So you had to . . . ” Dean hated the way his voice dried up. He cleared his throat. “I mean.”
“Because God chose you to save Dean?” Sam asked.
“Stop killing my children!” a woman’s shrill voice screamed from their right, toward which they all turned. Some sort of force struck him, flinging him on his back. After a dazed moment of vulnerability, he could look up to see Castiel fighting against the force, walking step by step toward the purple-glowing witch with her hand raised. With a final leap, he was on her, and with one motion downward, the celestial warrior had stabbed her through the heart.
Sam had a cut on his forehead, and Rowena looked a little ruffled, but she threw the Black Grimoire on the bed, flipped to a page, and began chanting. A flash of light and a small shockwave later, and the magic was flung from Dean’s body. In a moment, the man was standing there fully again.
“Yeah, yeah.” The kid wasn’t all that reassuring, but he was OK enough, Dean thought. “I'll be all right.”
Cass’ vessel wasn’t just some guy. After all, Jimmy Novak himself had left the building back when Raphael had blown him up like a “water balloon of wet soup.” Jimmy and his wife were sharing heaven now. Jimmy was gone.
“Morning, Cass,” Dean said without turning around. “Can you believe there’s nothing really all that weird going on right now?”
“Dude! I’m cool with a guy who wants that, but—”
And it had to be music without an obvious percussionist. The only one who could beat the drum to keep them all together was an archangel, and from the before the Fall, Michael, Lucifer, Gabriel, Raphael had shown as much interest in the musical aspect of angel radio as they did in the evolution of human Tupperware parties.
Looking around, Dean realized not everybody was actually in the contest. Many of these people had tickets already and just wanted a chance to show off their gear.
Dean frowned. “That’s a fancy way of saying you guys sing, right?”
“It can’t be both nothing and impossible.”
“You were, uh, naked. They’d surrounded you with candles. The video was only a few seconds.”
When the angel had gotten back into the “chamber” and onto the bed, Castiel looked so wrecked and Dean felt so tired, that he’d just rolled over and gone to sleep, not caring he was naked with bits of paint or blood or whatever the crap was all over his body. He knew it was hours later when he woke up to see Castiel holding a steaming teacup.
“What do you mean?”
I ended up smiling to myself.
So yeah, he was about to die, and there was this incredibly stupid knife-wielding $100,000 bear plodding toward him one slow, fleece-padded step after another. Some part of Sam’s brain was particularly irritated that the demonic plushy was purple.
Sam was abruptly certain. If Dean told Cass he wanted more from their relationship, Cass would be on board. Maybe it wouldn’t be for all the right reasons, but then, Dean and he weren’t exactly poster boys for good emotional health either.
“Yeah, yeah. Sure.” Dean stands there for a moment, then looks at him squarely. “Cass, do you, I mean, did you say something to me when, you know, I was out of it?”
Dean Winchester is my friend, as is his brother Sam. Somehow, this angel with a “crack in his chassis,” this “top of the Christmas tree” failure, has become a pseudo-brother to two of the best humans ever born.
“Yes.” Castiel was back to his monotone. “We had relations, and then they released you. That was the end of the matter.”
“Cass, I mean, it’s one thing to . . .” Dean seemed to have no idea what to say now either.
“Shut up,” Dean said.
"I am well enough, Captain—Jim. You must trust that if I require help I will ask for it."
For the rest of the night they lay there, entwined, being united, while the angel told the human what he could, which wasn’t much, of the war ahead of them. They would face it together, but the outcome was uncertain. Dean just nodded, and he worried about Sam.
Some girl in a blond wig and leather ensemble stuck a microphone in Castiel’s face.
A thousand scenarios went through Sam’s brain like a slide show in hyperspace. Romantic dinners by candlelight, longs walks on the beach, window shopping in some quaint village, dancing in the rain, leaving love notes in lunch boxes, making out in the balcony of a movie theater, picking wildflowers, gazing at the sunset, kisses at the top of a Ferris wheel, Dean strumming the guitar and singing—
“I’ll help you.”
I spread my hands in honest perplexity. “I am the same as I have been for some time.” Then I had an idea of what he might mean. “I can assure you that Naomi is not controlling me. Neither is anyone else other than myself. Although, of course, if I were being controlled by another, I suppose I would say that. If there is some sort of test—”
“It’s me, Sam!” he called just as the door swung open and Dean was standing there.
It had started pumping with that announcement of intent twelve hours before any other symptoms showed up.
“Castiel,” Dean said, like I have heard parents say to their children when they’re being difficult. I found I liked this even less than feeling defensive. “Look at me.”
“Sometimes it’s about remembering why you go forward, why you bother to take another step. Sometimes it’s about wondering why you care when one opinion, one act of rebellion doesn’t just mean being cast out, it means being cut off. It means even when you need the simplest of acts from the community you’ve served for millennia, no one will touch you. No one will help you. No one will care as you suffer. No one will help even if you beg!”
Except for when he’d been full of Purgatory’s souls, Castiel never boasted about his position with other angels. But Sam and his brother had been able to read between the lines. Somehow, Castiel had gotten rid of a number of particularly dickish angels. And they had seen him fight, using that angel blade like a damn lightsaber.
This wasn’t helping, and though he turned to another fresh page in his notebook, nothing new came to mind.
My very deep mistake.
He was currently going through a
“I’ll stay,” Castiel said, knowing he would be better at monitoring Dean’s condition than his brother. “Don’t forget the bullets.”
“OK, look. I’m not going to do . . . whatever it is you think I’m going to do.”
“Dean, I need to offer my apologies if you haven’t figured it out, but I have been nothing but respectful of what you humans call your ‘boundaries.’” He realized his fingers had made those little quote marks and put his hands down, only to watch them rise back up again. “Your ‘personal space.’”
“I want to help, you son of a bitch!”
Dean made sure he didn’t say he felt like his ass had been introduced to a nuclear missile. “I feel like something is going on. How long have I—” He gestured.
Castiel kept kissing while he stripped them both. Dean had to make an effort to see this body God had evidently custom-made with him in mind, which meant that he promptly had to concede God was a great tailor.
“Oh, it’s heavy,” she said. “What did you make it of?”
