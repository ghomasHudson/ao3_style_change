Sherlock doesn’t know how to reply to that truthfully, so he makes an excuse. “It was storming most of the night. It kept me up.”
He studies the two books cradling the knife blade. Both are brown leather with gilded spines, one a collection of Shakespeare sonnets, the other untitled. He plucks a tissue from a nearby box and uses it to cover the knife handle, preserving any fingerprints. He carefully pulls out the blade and sets it aside, then slides out the heavy volume without a title. He soon realizes it’s not a book, but a photo album.
I could feel Sherlock scrutinizing my profile, and I exhaled a little shakily. It was time for me to say it. I turned my head to face him.
Sherlock squints at the writing in the poor light. The paper has yellowed and the ink has faded over the years, but it’s still legible.
They rummage together a simple but delicious meal of an omelette, sharp cheese, olives, rustic bread, and, appropriately enough, sweet peaches that dribble over their fingers and down their chins.
The afternoon was warm and drowsy, as if the world had decided to take a nap. He biked slowly, noticing the flowers along the roadside and in people's gardens, thinking about bees and pollen.
Sherlock was the one who had suggested they go on holiday for a few extra days. He’d arranged the dual massage, secretly took a photo of him this morning, praised his clothing style.
Matthew and I were now a thing, whatever that meant. Basically, it was hanging out when we had time between schoolwork and swimming and worrying about our futures, which would likely diverge into two different paths once we left school.
They collapsed onto the bed again, quenched in sleepy, sultry bliss. Sherlock placed his lips lingeringly over the scar on John's shoulder.
“Oh, John's here! How nice!” Molly exclaimed. “I suppose with his mum and aunt gone… well, it's good to have a place to go for the holidays.” She twirled the stem of her wine glass. “It's like the old days, the three of us back here. That was a wonderful summer.”
“I'm sorry. This isn't the way --” John stopped, wiped a hand over his mouth. “I'm sorry. But we both know there’s nothing we can do about it.”
He lets his gaze wander over the shelves crammed with musty books, then on the window that looks out to the neglected garden, fading yellow and orange blooms waving in the autumn twilight. He had taken a short walk along the overgrown paths that morning with the nurse, discouraged at how tired the exertion still made him. She pushed him to keep going just a bit farther, encouraging him to keep building up his strength. He finds her positive attitude annoying, but knows he has to comply if he ever wants to recover.
Sherlock is reluctant to move, but he finds a tea towel in a cupboard and wipes away all evidence of their tryst before zipping himself back into his trousers. “I should be getting back.”
Mrs. Watson sat across from him, sipping a cup of tea. “Could you go into town today? We need some things.” She slid a sheet of paper across the table. “You can take the car.”
“There's a cafe next door and a grocer just around the corner,” she added as John glanced into the kitchen and down the hallway. The bedroom door was closed.
But John wasn’t done yet, leaning forward to address Sherlock directly. “Statistically speaking, it’s a possibility.”
He was sleeping better and reading the daily paper again, gradually re-engaging with the wider world. When Mrs. Hudson brought up potential clients to confer with Sherlock, John began taking notes to keep track of people's stories, fascinated by their bizarre and mundane complaints that ranged from mischievous ghosts to missing dogs, suspected affairs and arson, to poisonings and stolen paintings.
John’s fingers bite into Sherlock’s back as Sherlock nuzzles that particularly sensitive spot beneath his ear.
A simple rug warmed the floor, while the ceiling sloped on one side where the roofline ran. The room was much cozier than the dark and depressing bedsit he was currently living in.
Aunt Harry didn’t answer right away, and I thought for a moment she didn’t hear me. But she finally spoke. “They have… a unique relationship.”
Mrs. Hudson whisked from the flat, leaving them alone. Sherlock slowly removed his coat and hung it on a peg behind the door.
“I knew there was something odd,” Molly eyes were bright, her hands clasped in excitement, “but I would never have imagined a boomerang.”
The summer heat was a living thing, palpitating, shimmering, relentless. Afternoons were devoted to listless napping or half-hearted reading in the shade of the pine trees near the pool, sometimes watching grainy television while lying stomach-down on the sofa under the apathetic ceiling fan.
He wasn’t certain how Sherlock felt about him, but he’d been through enough relationships in his life to read the signs, and so far he was encouraged. Although...
I stumbled around, trying to brush my hair and change my clothes and find my shoes. I finally raced out the door, running to catch the next train.
They both nodded grimly, and Molly pulled back the sheet to expose the head and chest of the hiker. He was naked, the skin waxy, a blueish tinge to the lips, the head angled to the side. The eyelids, thankfully, had been closed.
“Right now?” Mrs. Holmes sighed, then picked up her tea cup and followed Elizabeth to the kitchen, pontificating about terrines and pâtés.
Sherlock’s hands skimmed past John's shoulders, his fingers sliding into John's damp hair, deepening the kiss. He wanted this, so, so badly. John groaned, clutching Sherlock harder.
His eyes landed on a tall figure in a dark coat. The blood drained from John's face, his mind going numb in shock.
His thumbs hovered over the keyboard as he read the three words remaining on the screen, struck still by the unintentional confession.
They barely knew each other, but the whiskey and shimmering water had gone to his head, making him want to kiss John, however clumsily at first, to be tutored in this ageless and intimate new language. It had been intoxicating.
“John, I’d like you to meet someone,” Anthea was saying, looking quite pleased with herself. “This is Mr. Holmes.”
Which room was my dad staying in? Where was Sherlock's room? At midnight, if I listened closely, would I hear the pad of feet against the floorboards in the hallway, the whisper of a door easing open and closing with a muted click? If I listened even closer, would I hear a groan of bed springs and soft sounds?
He briefly wondered what John was wearing. Something tweedy, he imagined, suitable for an author and rugged ex-soldier.
“But what for? Why try to scare them off?” John glanced at the map on his phone, noting there was still another hour’s drive.
He padded to the changing room, where he quickly stripped off his swim trunks and stepped into the showers. The hot water streamed over his chilled skin, making it tingle as it warmed. He finally turned off the tap and wrapped a towel around his waist, grabbing a second towel to rub at his hair as he headed back to his locker to change.
Sherlock steps forward cautiously, holding the candle out in front of him. “Apparently,” he finally pronounces, “this is where our ghost wants us to stay.”
It was late morning when he woke, the fever finally breaking. He gulped down a glass of water and shuffled to the bathroom, feeling as if he'd taken a beating. He refilled his glass with more water and climbed back into bed, his eyes dull and aching.
“No need to drag your father into any sort of court proceeding or publicity. Besides, it’s a superficial wound. I gave him something for the pain. He’ll need you to drive him back home.” Sherlock studied his tea, not really looking at me.
“Very.” John felt warmed at the ease of their familiar banter, dropping a kiss onto Sherlock's forehead. It was fitting, being together on this night, the solstice a turning point, emerging from the darkest moments and returning to the light.
He felt Sherlock's cock harden between his own legs where he straddled him. John deliberately pressed against him, gyrating his hips, fingertips teasing the tight nipples, all the time watching Sherlock’s face, the way his eyes darkened, lips parted, his neck extended back.
Sorry I only had time to post one chapter this week, but I wanted to leave ya’ll with some smut with feeling before I leave on vacation. It’s a family road trip to the mountains and various national parks, so that means limited wifi and writing time. But there’ll be more to come in the next few weeks!
The beers arrived and Anthea finally looked up. “Thanks.” She took a sip, turning to face John more fully.
Sherlock fades back, his hands still grasping John’s thighs, his eyes searching John’s face, cautious, fearful.
Mycroft glanced pointedly around the messy flat. “Although I'm not sure what you're spending your money on…”
Again, Sherlock realizes he doesn’t already know the answer. He’s seen portions of John’s bare arms and legs, a flash of chest at the vee of his dressing gown, a strip of skin at his waist when he bends down or reaches up, but nothing more. Not the most private parts of his body.
John snapped his head toward the sound, his eyes narrowing when he recognized the lanky man standing calmly by the door, his bespoke suit and sharp face all angles and cheekbones and perfection. John hated him.
But Sherlock had yet to be satisfied. John wriggled his hands under Sherlock's shirt, skimming his fingers up Sherlock's ribs, finding the tight buds of his nipples.
Inside the bathroom, Sherlock looks at himself in the mirror, his features carved and hollowed by the flickering candle. How on earth, he wonders, has this bizarre evening ended with him about to share a bed with John?
“Just his clothes. Ian -- I mean, Constable Dimmock, took the rest.” Molly blushed and quickly walked over to a cupboard.
They had lived together for more than a year, growing used to each other's habits, good and bad. The way John folded his shirts before putting them away. The way John muttered at the news on the telly. How he lined up his shoes by the door, marked his place with a proper bookmark, never folding down the corner of the page.
Sherlock could almost think back fondly on those memories now, but at the time the command performances in starched shirts and too-tight shoes were excruciating. Still, he had developed a love for music, something he had let fade since he had gone to university.
With discipline, he slowly lifted his hands, breaking through the calm surface of the water, wrinkled fingers grasping the edge of the tub. He forced himself to rise, water sheeting off his body, goosebumps pricking his skin, a shiver jolting his spine as he reached for a towel.
John stroked and fondled and sucked, Sherlock's elbows sliding out from under him as he melted into the sheets.
As Sherlock rinsed the razor, John set his mug aside then rose to his feet. He nestled behind Sherlock, looping his arms around his waist, just wanting to hold him. He rested his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling Sherlock relax into his embrace.
Sherlock took the receiver from his father’s hand, watching his parents retreat to another room. He finally put the phone to his ear, said John’s name. How did it feel to finally be done with the book? Unreal. Did he like teaching? Parts of it. It’s good to hear your voice. You too.
John placed the pen back on the table and held the lukewarm mug in his hands, hoping Sherlock would read between the lines.
I'll be heading off to the lake myself this weekend to enjoy a little more summer vacation, so not much writing will happen, but beaches, ice cream, and blueberries will.
It's been months since the realization dawned on him how much he needs John in his life, how much he craves his company, how the slightest touch reverberates through his skin, how he wants to press his body against John's, breathe him in, unravel every question about him… It aches, having John so near and so distant.
Sherlock smirked. “They think you're a good influence on me, believe it or not. A reputable companion.”
And yet he couldn’t imagine what the days would be like without John. His hands stilled, his ears barely registering what his father was saying. Something about the details of honey extraction and storage. His mind as hazy as the smoke that billowed around them, Sherlock followed along quietly as his father inspected the remaining hives.
“I’m working on a new article, but there are some medical aspects that aren’t in my realm of expertise. I was wondering…” Sherlock trailed off.
“I'll miss this place,” she says, her gaze roaming over the walls and windows. She looks at Sherlock, her eyes welling up again. “Even you, with your clients and violin and cursing at all hours.”
There was so much he didn't have the chance to learn about John. They knew each other's bodies intimately, but he didn't know his favorite color, or if he'd ever had a dog, or why he hadn't gotten along with his father.
I followed him up the creaky stairs to the roof. Sherlock settled his back against the low wall running along the perimeter and I joined him. He handed me the pack and I drew out a cigarette, then leaned over the flame dancing from the metal lighter in Sherlock's hand. He lit one up for himself and we smoked without speaking, taking in the skyline around us.
It was dark, the desk lamp the only light in the room, the building deserted. When the door slowly creaked opened, he stiffened, prepared for an intruder.
Sherlock put his feet on the desk. “What if I don’t trust you? What if you decide to steal my unpublished research while I’m gone?”
And after summer was over, another challenge awaited: the Royal Army Medical Corps. Basic training, more courses, then off to serve wherever His Majesty deemed necessary. He wanted to feel nonchalant, but his stomach knotted every time he thought about it, partly from fear, partly from excitement. He wanted to travel and experience the world. He wanted to taste danger and be tested by situations that would never happen in a safe little village like this.
John thought hazily, loving the heavy weight of it holding his head. His tongue flicked into Sherlock’s mouth, his thumb stroking a patch of sensitive skin behind Sherlock’s ear.
His only friend his age in town was Molly, whose family had started summering in the neighboring villa some five years ago. They sometimes swam in the cove together or rode their bikes into town for gelato. There had been a bumbling kiss two years ago, an awkward groping beneath bathing suits one drunken night on the beach, but it had been a mistake. It hadn’t felt right and he broke it off before it could begin, somehow salvaging their friendship.
He lifted his eyes to John’s, remembering the first time he saw him from the window, John looking up at the villa, tilting his face to the sun.
John wanted Sherlock to stop talking, and he also wanted to kiss him, finding his scientific enthusiasm endearing. He pulled Sherlock into a darkened doorway, the kind of alcove perfect for dashing out of the rain, having a quick smoke, or conducting experimental kisses to determine exactly how menthol affects the quality of semi-public snogging.
He opened the door and smiled at me. Before he could say anything, I pushed my way in and peeled off my shirt, leaving a thin white cami clinging to my skin. I turned to face him.
Sherlock sighed impatiently, then another thought quickly followed. “My old bike -- is it still in the garage?”
John looked up from where he sat on the bed writing in a notepad. Sherlock moved toward him and John set the pen and paper to the side.
Sherlock lifted the spoon to his mouth, cringing at the initial sting of the salty broth. The second spoonful was easier, the warm liquid sliding down in a shallow swallow. The third was almost soothing as it went down, coating the back and sides of his throat.
“I don’t say it enough,” he continues, still looking down at his drink. “Maybe I’ve never said it… but I value it, all that you do.” He lifts his eyes, finally meeting mine. “I find it… a comfort, having you here. Having you with me.”
“He tried, at times, to get through all the barriers I put up, but we never spoke about it. Never acted on it.” He flipped the lighter lid open and snapped it shut. “And then, I utterly betrayed your father’s trust. I disappeared for two years. He thought I was dead.”
I kept to myself, accepting the plate of food Dad brought up to me with minimal conversation. I brushed my teeth and changed into pajamas, texted a few friends. I finally switched off the lamp and lay in the quiet room, my mind inevitably turning to what I didn't want to think about.
Why? Why, for the love of God, were there 10 bags of frozen peas jammed into the freezer? Sherlock was supposed to do the shopping for the week, and
Mrs. Hudson seemed to notice his discomfort. “Why don't you have a seat? I’ll make the tea and then we’ll chat. Take some more time to get a feel for the place.”
Sherlock settled a hand on John's thigh, opening more space, circled John's cock with his fingers, and lowered his head, relishing the fullness in his mouth, the tremble in the sigh that escaped from John's lips.
The other man jabbed, connecting, only to receive a sharp blow to his jaw in return. The man stumbled backward and a satisfied smile crossed Sherlock's now bloody lip.
John scoots forward, balanced on the edge of his chair, his hands moving up to cup Sherlock’s face. Although the angle is awkward, their mouths soften, explore, tasting of chocolate and red wine.
“Oh, I nearly forgot,” Mr. Holmes said, hanging up his hat. “Your mother asked you to go see her as soon as we were done out here.”
John slowly traces a diagonal line of three freckles. “Here.” He swallows. “His shield… there.” He draws a long curve between two moles, a motion that feels like a caress.
No such luck. John can see that he’s deep asleep, his breath slow and even. He steals a private moment to gaze at Sherlock. Even with his tousled hair, unshaven face, and wrinkled suit, he’s a beautiful sight. In sleep, his face is unguarded, his perfect cupid bow’s lending him a sweet, almost boyish appearance.
John dressed slowly, his mood much calmer. He checked his appearance once more in the mirror, pausing a moment to study his reflection. He looked good, more relaxed than this morning. For some reason, he winked cheekily at himself.
She laughed. “Good question. Although, it is nice to have someone you can depend on, who’s there for you no matter what…” she trailed off, and I could tell she was thinking about how her own marriage had failed. “Well, in an ideal world, anyway.”
It’s nearly 11 at night when Sherlock arrives home from the airport. He hooks his bag over his shoulder and trudges up the stairs, exhausted and bleary-eyed. The case in Sweden had been far more complicated and time-consuming than he’d expected.
“No, I suppose not.” John curls his fingers over the top of a chair. They’re both standing by the table, John close enough to see droplets of water on Sherlock’s skin. “I went to the lab to look for you tonight.”
John set his drink to the side and turned the gloves in his hands, caressing the buttery grain with his thumbs.
Maybe Aunt Harry already knew. My gut told me that she did, but that she was also keeping their secret for them. Maybe someday we’d talk about it. Not today, though. I snuggled deeper into the corner of the sofa.
Sherlock looked over John’s shoulder at his own reflection, adjusting his tie and sweeping back the lock of hair that insisted on falling across his forehead. When he glanced at John, he found John gazing at him, a slight smile hovering over his mouth.
John rose and walked over to Sherlock, glancing down to where he was looking. John did a double-take. “Is that a --”
Every atom in Sherlock’s body alights with desire. How John is able to stir this fiery response in him is a mystery. Sex has never particularly interested him, but now, in this house — in the shower, in his bed, in this claustrophobic little room — John has tapped into a well of insatiable lust.
John arched his head back onto his pillow, engulfed by Sherlock's plush mouth, sensuous warmth, agile tongue. He squirmed in pleasure, heels digging into the bed, his fingers sinking into Sherlock's hair.
Another note to thank all of you who are patiently following along and offering encouragement. Sending chocolate and fuzzy little kittens your way as thanks!
This time was the most intense of them all. It felt -- and John was not one to use these types of words lightly -- deeply intimate.
John jumped, sloshing tea over the rim of his cup, startled by the deep voice that reverberated in the air behind him. He hadn't heard anyone on the stairs or at the door downstairs. His nerves still raw from his last months in the army, he looked at Mrs. Hudson in alarm, but she was smiling. John struggled to turn around in the high-backed chair to face whoever had spoken.
John turned his face up into the spray of water, the sting of each jet needling him into wakefulness. He’d slept terribly the last few nights, Greg’s sofa putting a permanent crick in his neck.
Sherlock’s eyes dart to the fireplace where a gas flame is burning low in the grate. “I didn’t light it.”
I stared out the train window. I knew about Sherlock’s past drug use, information Harry had shared with me along with her own story of alcoholism. She certainly didn’t glamorize any of it for me.
Sherlock smiled, recalling the stunning sight of John reclining by the pool or wading in the sea. “And you look beautiful in the sun.”
“Yes. Many.” Sherlock’s voice is rough. He regrets his weaknesses, his addictions, his inability to share his innermost secrets with the man sitting within reach.
Sherlock shakes his head, trying to clear the faint voice from his memory. It was the wind, nothing more. Only the adrenaline in his body says otherwise.
It’s not a conscious decision when John gently slides his hands around Sherlock’s waist and tips forward, covering the fresh scar with his lips. It’s an instinct, a deep need to warm and protect the beautiful, brilliant conundrum of a man he’s fallen in love with.
I vaguely recognized a few people who Dad knew. They smiled at me and remarked on how much I'd grown. I picked at my nail polish. The service was formal and boring, so I tried to guess who other people were based on what I could see of their dark clothing and the back of their heads.
“Dog. Although I don’t particularly object to cats.” Sherlock takes a drink. “But I don’t care for birds. Too… fluttery.” He waggles his fingers with a distasteful motion.
He didn’t know the next time they could be together like this; now was the chance to learn and experiment. He'd be a fool to let this opportunity go.
They must have known each other, John Watson and William Holmes. They appeared in the same photo, even though Holmes wasn’t part of the RAMC. That meant they were probably acquaintances, or friends. Possibly more.
“Fine, then. Live-in partner, if it suits you. I work from my flat. It'd be convenient if we were both there.”
John smiles, and Sherlock's mouth curves up in return. They'll find their way through this, John realizes. They're bound together, a bond forged through the best and the worst of circumstances.
That night, John lay in his bed, unable to sleep, his mind drifting back to Sherlock and the ski instructor/thief. It wasn't the first time he'd wondered about the sexual habits of Sherlock Holmes. He thought about it far too often, in fact. Some days he was convinced that ice ran through Sherlock's veins, no human emotions or urges swaying him from his work. Other times he swore he glimpsed a flicker of heat in his eyes, a spark that hinted at a passion simmering beneath his cool exterior.
He could go to Sherlock right now, step unannounced into the bathroom, strip off the clothes he just put on, and join him. They could touch each other freely, the room steaming, the mirror fogging…
John smiled in spite of himself. “Fine. We’ll have cake, then let’s get out of here. I think we might have the lake all to ourselves tonight.”
He kisses John again, more slowly this time, their tongues sliding alongside, teasing, flicking, tempting. John’s hands skim from Sherlock’s back to his hips, his fingers gradually sliding down to grip his arse, grinding him against his thighs. Sherlock can feel John’s erection through his jeans, inflaming his own arousal.
The water drummed against John's back and he felt hollow, unconvinced. The warm cinnamon and clove scent of the soap shimmered in the air, bringing to mind crisp winter nights and mugs of mulled cider, Christmas mornings and wool socks on cold wooden floors, a candied kiss in the back row of the cinema, a room with flickering red candles and long shadows.
They walked on, threading their way through skinny back streets until they reached the appointed alley.
He cleaned himself with tissues and got out of bed, unable to sleep. He wandered onto the balcony that was shared with John’s bedroom and leaned against the balustrade, staring out into the night, the tree branches sighing in the light breeze. A mosquito buzzed near his ear and he brushed it away.
Mrs. Howard turned to John as if he were a confidant. “I’ve known Sherlock since he was a boy. Always up to something mischievous, even though he was so quiet.” She turned back to Sherlock. “Tell your mother we miss her at the club. She’s so clever at cards.”
As he rode home, he felt warm, the taste of Sherlock’s kiss still on his lips. He marveled at how different everything was between them now, transforming from enemies to lovers in one semester. He silently thanked Mike Stamford for bringing him together with his arch enemy, serving as an accidental Cupid; Irene Adler for opening his eyes to his true desires; and Sarah for spurring Sherlock’s jealousy enough to get him to finally speak up.
No cars passed by, the road all to himself, houses dark, a half-moon lighting the way. He felt wide awake and utterly free. When Musgrave Hall came into view, he slowed, assessing his next move. He dismounted when he reached the lane, deciding to walk his bike in the grass, first stooping down to pick up several small stones.
He glanced down, mortified to see he had a world-class hard on. He quickly folded his hands over his crotch, trying to distract himself by looking out the window.
John willingly wraps himself around Sherlock, covers him, sinking his bones into the cradle of his hips, twining his arms under his shoulders, absorbing him. They breathe, locked together.
Later, he forced himself to dress for dinner and join his family at the table, not wanting to start another round of trouble by being absent. With all the attention on Mycroft, Sherlock barely ate or spoke, slipping away as soon as possible.
Round two was even more intense. Another vivid image flashed into his mind: Sherlock on all fours on the bed, fingers clutching into the sheets, John grasping Sherlock’s hips from behind, thrusting rhythmically, dog tags jingling as they bounced against his chest, springs squeaking, skin softly slapping, low breathy moans…
John laid in bed listening to the drizzle of early morning autumn rain against the window. The sound was peaceful; far different from the shouting neighbors, crying children, and slamming doors at the rooming house. He snuggled deeper under the white duvet in his room tucked under the eaves on Baker Street, still appreciating a comfortable bed after years of cots and nets and scratchy blankets.
But it's part of the game, the expectations that come with working at the hospital. One must stroke the egos of the senior administrators and specialists, drink their fine wine and admire their lovely homes and wonderful taste in art. He hopes he's not being groomed for some tedious administrative position. He hates paperwork.
The room is quiet, the curtains gently stirring. John steps closer now, mapping the plunging outline of summer-burnished skin with his fingers. He breathes in the faint notes of cologne and the heady scent of Sherlock’s warm body. He draws closer, their breaths shallow, wanting to mark Sherlock’s skin with his own mouth, wanting to taste his salt and heat.
He should have kissed him, Sherlock realized too late. He should have seized the moment and made a move, ending this back-and-forth tension. If John had pushed him away, fine. He would avoid him, and at least he would know where they stood. But if John had accepted his kiss, drew him in for more… then what?
“I hurried back to the room, the old man’s gone. He can't have walked that far, so I checked the hall and elevator and stairs, I asked the desk clerks. No one else saw him. Vanished.”
He would rest his eyes for a few minutes, then get back to work. Just a short nap was all he needed…
John ran a hand through his messy hair, then glanced at the clock on the nightstand. He had several hours before dinner. Fine, then. He'd have another look around the city, this time taking a camera.
Sherlock nods and unwinds his scarf from around his throat. He's aware of Mycroft’s careful casualness, and, for once, appreciates it. He takes the drink offered to him and sits down, his brain still jittery.
The wind moans around the house, the damp scent of rain in the air. Somewhere outside an agent is stationed to keep watch over the house, probably huddling in his car with a thermos of hot tea, cursing his bad luck for drawing such a boring assignment.
Sherlock sat forward in his chair, agitated. “In the general population, the odds of having identical twins is approximately 1 in 250 births,” Sherlock shot back, the volume of his voice rising, causing the audience to look up from their phones. “The odds of identical twins going on to commit a serious crime is staggeringly low. But whenever there’s a case where a person is allegedly in two places at one time, Doctor Watson here loves to trot out his beloved twin theory.”
“My grandmother was a very superstitious woman.” John stares into his amber drink. “If she spilled salt, she'd toss a pinch over her left shoulder for good luck. She read her horoscope every day. She said never to go near fairy rings. It all sounds ridiculous, I know.
They ate in silence, adjusting to the new atmosphere between them. When the room grew even quieter, John looked up, then followed Sherlock’s gaze back to his own left hand. Sherlock clearly had noticed the absent wedding band.
God, he was tired. John readjusted the bulky camera bag, his eyes roving for a sign that could point him to the taxi queue. Several bored-looking private car drivers in suits stood along the sides, holding up signs for their passengers. Mr. Wang. Ms. Schmidt. Mr. Obeke. Mr. Watson.
John climbs the creaky ladder and carefully hangs a paper bat from the ceiling. He gives it a little push to set it swinging, satisfied that it will hold. He glances down at Sherlock, watching him rummage through a cardboard box with his shirt sleeves rolled up. It’s the purple shirt that verges on being obscenely tight, accentuating every muscle and curve of his back and chest.
The husband’s eyes went unfocused, remembering. “I saw her once. Black hair all done up, green gown, mouth painted red… beautiful.”
John takes another swallow, the fumes burning his throat. But there is something else he can taste, something cloying and floral filling his nose and overpowering the liquor on his tongue. Roses.
He worked open another button, and another, and another. He pushed aside John's shirt to gently probe a pink nipple with his tongue. It hardened to a pebble, surprising him with its firmness. He experimentally rolled his tongue around the areola, pleased with the way his actions made John arch his back and catch his breath.
“I’ve always wondered why you left the army.” Sherlock stabbed his fork through the golden crust of a hearty slice of apple pie. “Was it your shoulder injury?”
A muted sound from Sherlock's throat indicated that he hadn't. John reached around to gather Sherlock's cock with his slicked hand, adjusting his stance until his hips molded to the curve of Sherlock's arse. He slid his shaft deeper between his thighs, then pulled back slowly, letting the oil warm and spread, continuing to stroke Sherlock with his palm.
John knew his next line was lame, but it'd worked more than once. “Do you want to see some of my photos… up in my room?”
He stared at the ceiling, watching the lights of a passing motor car roam across the plaster. Victor breathed evenly beside him, an arm thrown above his head, naked and lost in sleep.
He finally heard the jingle of keys and Sherlock's footsteps on the stairs. John stood, rehearsing his words, nervous again.
“I try to avoid family gatherings as often as possible.” Sherlock toyed with his glass. “My brother and I tend to disagree about most things. We’ve ruined more than one Christmas dinner.”
"My mother always cooked with music on. I suppose I picked that up from her." John stirred the rice, letting it absorb all the liquid.
“That's true...” John looked skeptically at Sherlock. “But why would your parents want me to go along?”
“Bergamot,” Sherlock murmured, rolling onto his back and pulling John on top of him, fitting their bodies together, his hips moving sinuously.
They shifted again, John on his back, Sherlock straddling his thighs. Sherlock’s hand slid between them to curl around John's cock. John let out a hum of pleasure, pressing into Sherlock’s hand.
“I suppose it could have been a rat bumping around,” she says, trying to sound convincing. “Maybe it chewed through the wiring, too.”
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said, standing by his side. “My family’s been coming here for years. They do excellent work.”
“I want you,” John gasps between urgent kisses, fumbling at the remaining buttons, their hearts and bodies radiating desire like the sun.
“And then,” John kissed Sherlock, ending with a lingering tug on his bottom lip, “I think we’ll figure something out.”
“Surely she can spare you for a week. You’ve weeded, painted, and repaired every square inch of this place. What else can there be left to do?”
“But then one day,” she went on, folding a basket of laundry as I sat on her floor drawing a picture of an imaginary solar system, “I decided I needed to change. And I got sober.”
He looks around once more, deciding whether to go home or stay and run a few experiments. He’s not tired, so he opts for the latter. He shrugs off his suit jacket and rolls up his sleeves, then flicks on a lamp and begins setting up equipment.
Sherlock watched him walk determinedly toward the house, not glancing back. With a crunch of gravel, he drove off, utterly confounded again. He thought they had been getting along well, finally breaking the ice a bit.
Many details and decisions later, the owner called over the master tailor with a crook of his finger. “Let’s begin with Mr. Watson’s measurements.” He turned to Sherlock, assessing his build. “And you, it seems, will need some new measurements as well. Joined a sports club, have you?”
Sherlock frowned, then sighed, letting the book fall shut. “I occasionally use it to stimulate my mind, yes. And I occasionally need to quiet my mind with something else. But I'm a trained chemist, remember? I'm very careful.”
The sky was heavy and dark by the time he left the cafe. Cold drops of rain splattered onto the pavement, soon turning into a steady drizzle. Sherlock cursed himself, knowing that he didn't have enough money for a cab. He'd been putting off going to the bank for days and had only a few coins left in his pocket.
John shrugs, a bit embarrassed. He had it trimmed yesterday, styled. “Yeah. I thought I’d try something different.”
John closes his eyes, his hand rising, sliding under Sherlock’s jaw, angling his head to deepen the kiss. Sherlock responds like a flower blooming in the sun, his mouth warm, one hand twining into John’s hair, the other into the fabric of his T-shirt.
“I saw Dimmock earlier. He says nothing unusual appeared in the video footage. And there’s no passages leading from the cellar, either. So…” Hannah trails off. “At least there’s a second person on watch now. That makes me feel a little better.”
“Me neither.” John looked at the overgrown yard as if calculating the weeks of work left. They fell silent, taking in the scraggly orchard, rangy bushes, and weeds that needing taming. “We should all go to the lake again.”
He held the left glove, then tentatively slid his fingers into the opening at the wrist. The lining was plush, the softest cashmere. He pushed his fingers in deeper, his chest pulsing with a guilty thrill. There was something intimate, almost penetrative about the gesture. He slid the supple leather over his hand, a second skin.
She quickly took John under her wing as they walked upstairs to get settled. “Now, you’ll have the third room on the left. It has a lovely view of the rose garden. Pity it's the wrong time of year to see it in all its glory.”
Sherlock slid his hands up John's back and lowered his lips, finding the familiar warmth of John's mouth. If this was their last night together, he wanted it to unfold gradually, lingering over every detail.
By the time the service ended and guests were milling around to offer their condolences to the family, I had figured out who Sherlock’s brother was (tall, thin, sharp eyes and nose under a receding hairline, elegant suit) and who their mother was (silver hair pulled back, slash of fuschia lipstick, jangly bracelets and large rings, loud voice, maneuvering through the guests like a determined battleship dressed in black).
He was spewed into the international arrivals area, eager faces of parents and siblings, friends and lovers quickly scanning past him, searching for their loved ones.
John took another swallow of beer, trying to hide how flustered he suddenly felt. He glanced at Anthea, who was tipping back her bottle, a flush coloring her cheeks.
I added to my transgressions and lied to Dad, texting him that I was taking the train back with Emma and staying overnight at her place. I'd see him back at home tomorrow.
Sherlock welcomed John's change of heart, the secret fondling, the flirting. He wanted it. Tonight, John would be seated next to him for hours in the theatre, their arms and knees touching in the dark, anticipation building. He knew what he wanted to happen next.
John stares into the darkness. It's not a particularly comforting thought, but it's true. At least the weight of Sherlock's arm around him makes it bearable.
He watched John slide the paper into his pocket. “Wherever they send you… don't get yourself killed.”
Private means exactly that -- discreet. Secret. They meet in hotels sometimes, rendezvousing in distant neighborhoods or far away cities. Most often John vanishes in and out the back door through Mrs. Hudson’s old flat. He does not want to draw attention to their situation.
John shrugged. "My mum taught us the basics. And I worked in a restaurant the summer before going to uni. Didn't last long there, although I learned a few tricks." He forked up a bite of potatoes. "Didn't you ever learn to cook?"
He calms his racing heart. It was the wind, of course, nothing more than a gust seeping through the panes. His imagination -- and John's -- are primed for these wild fancies. There are no such things as ghosts.
He gazes at the flames, his eyes traveling past the kitchen to the bathroom when he hears the creak of door hinges. Sherlock steps into the hallway, a towel slung low around his hips. He rubs his wet hair with another towel and shuffles into the kitchen to rummage in the cupboards.
No one else seemed to notice the shrill tone, so he sighed and reluctantly went to answer it, shutting the door behind him to block out the noise of the party.
John refuses to be chastised and gladly follows Sherlock to a cafe along the shady side of the street. Sherlock reads a newspaper while John continues to people watch and sip sangria. He's relaxed and in a generous mood, finding something pleasing in everything he sees.
Sherlock shifts his gaze to John’s face. Their eyes meet, and John knows he understands his meaning. Neither can look away. “Grief is a strange beast,” Sherlock says quietly. “It drags you into dark places… but the light eventually breaks through, I think.”
Sherlock stared at the wall as John’s words sank in, stunned by John’s confession. He had helped John, but saved him? How could he, a selfish, arrogant, irresponsible prick, ever be worthy of such praise?
“I always finish what I start.” John rolled Sherlock fully onto his back, fitting his hips between lean legs, easing his slicked cock into deep places that made Sherlock arch and shiver.
The bottle was filled with a clear, viscous liquid, its label reading ‘paraffinum perliquidum.’ He recognized it as a light oil used to condition wooden worktops or knife handles. It could also lubricate bearings. The seed of a wicked idea quickly took root in his mind.
“Oh,” she shrugged innocently. “Maybe you’ll partner up this year, find a passion project you can both really sink your teeth into. Get those creative juices flowing.” Her lips parted slyly. “Coming together with the right person can be
He walks down a street lined with small shops, tilting his face up to the warm sun. He slips on a pair of sunglasses. Handsome men in cotton shirts and pretty women in flimsy dresses stroll past him, a parade of sandals, unbuttoned collars, and sun-kissed shoulders.
Sherlock smiles wickedly. “Oh, we're not done yet.” He bends down to nuzzle John’s neck, sliding his lips to his ear. “We’re just getting started.”
Sherlock strokes himself off, his breath concentrated in small huffs until he hisses between his teeth, the first intense pulses of come shooting up to his chest, secondary waves spilling over his fingers and onto his stomach.
“Maybe,” John laughed, leisurely running his fingers from the root to the tip of Sherlock’s cock. “We could have used all that time fighting for something more entertaining.”
Sherlock fumbled his keys out of his pocket, his fingers cold and clumsy. He managed to unlock the front door and let himself in, the warmth of the entryway a welcome change from outside.
John found himself thinking about Sherlock so often — while trimming his beard, biking to class, making dinner, lying in bed before going to sleep (which inevitably led to some urgent wanking) — that he wondered if people could see the reason stamped on his face.
Mike’s smile fell as he looked back and forth between them. He gathered his dignity, then glanced at his watch. “I have another appointment. I’m sure you’ll work things out.” He walked to the door, then looked back once more. “Besides, you’ve both signed contracts. Unless you want to meet the university’s attorneys, I suggest you find a way to get along. Cheerio!” He waved and popped off down the hallway, leaving John alone with his nemesis.
John swallowed, a warmth spreading low in his groin, making him unable to tear his gaze from Sherlock. A terrible realization pinged in his brain.
“I called the agent,” Hannah announces as she comes back into the room, her phone still clutched in her hand. “He said he’d have a look at the video later. He wants to check inside the house now.”
“Hmm, the Headless Haunting comes to mind.” Sherlock pulls his pyjama t-shirt over his head, messing his hair. “So does the Case of the Wailing Cat. You really need to work on those titles.”
“Something more casual.” There was a long pause and he raised a questioning eyebrow at John’s unabashed stare.
Sherlock has taken to trimming his hair shorter, taming the wildest of the curls, but it suits him. He looks elegant, distinguished. John savors the thought of disheveling this well-dressed, rather refined creature across from him in the cool privacy of their rented villa.
“Come with me.” Sherlock circled John's wrist into his hand and led the way through the gardens. They soon came to the glasshouse, the moonlight shining off its surface, the interior dark.
John could sense Sherlock's arm next to his, their legs almost touching. He could think of nothing to say, his skin aching to make contact with Sherlock's. He held back, waiting for a cue, a sign that he should turn his face, move his hands.
Sherlock fixes him with a baleful look. “Not very reassuring, considering someone’s been slipping in and out at will, apparently.”
John smiled. “Damn right you do.” He turned back to his computer, feeling a boost of confidence from the turn of events. Sherlock Holmes, coming to
But here they were, together again, despite all odds. Fate, Mrs. Hudson had called it. Maybe she was right after all. He shouldn't waste the glimmer of a chance to finally mend their relationship.
“This isn’t happening,” Sherlock slurs, tangled in his dream. He’s confused by what’s real and what isn’t, but somehow he’s not afraid.
He watched as John made the final cut, the limb falling to the ground with a satisfying thud. It looked like a small fruit tree, the trunk no larger than 10 inches in diameter. It had probably blown over in a storm the summer before, judging by how dry the wood was. John now straightened his back, wiping his brow with his forearm, taking a breather.
John offered his medical opinion when asked, posed what seemed like endless questions, and often felt bewildered and amazed, but found the fast pace and Sherlock's sharp wit to be a tonic for his own mind that had grown dull and bleak.
“I --” Sherlock stammered. “I really should be getting home.” He found himself backing a few steps away, then forced himself to stop. He clenched his fists, digging his fingernails into his palms to regain his composure.
But yesterday, everything changed. Yesterday, John went with him on a case and got grazed by a bullet along his thigh, because he, the illustrious Sherlock Holmes, fucked up. He was careless and didn't see the signs that should have warned him of danger.
She slowly shakes her head. “I don’t think it wants to hurt us. I think it — he — wants to be acknowledged.”
The door to Mrs. Hudson’s flat flies open, letting in a burst of light and Christmas music. “I thought I heard voices! Come in and warm yourselves up. I’ve just made gingerbread, and I’ll put the kettle on.”
“Soon they're locked in an intimate embrace, and it starts so sensually, lips trailing down an exposed throat, lingering over a beating pulse…”
The sight had flooded him with unease. Uncertain if it was a pointed rebuke, he tried to mention it to Mary, his words clumsy and nervous, asking why she had moved the letters from his old trunk.
Sherlock smiles, wishing he could touch John, hold him close, tell him the depth of secrets that he knows. “My pleasure.”
Dad had taken his time weighing the implications of moving to Sussex, but he finally agreed to it. I think it was difficult for him to take the leap after all those years, but he quit his job at the hospital and sold our house once I was in school.
His gaze lands on Sherlock and his sentiment flows even more freely. He admires Sherlock’s long fingers holding the paper, the faint tan beneath the white shirt where the sleeves are rolled up. He's enamored with the cheekbones, still sharp above a jawline that's grown just a tad softer over the years.
He soon heard footsteps coming down the stairs, then the door swung open. Sherlock, dressed in black trousers and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, stared at him.
John smiles, brushes a curl away from Sherlock’s forehead, and Sherlock's heart unfolds.They let their hands and lips wander, place tender kisses in hollows and curves, drawing out sighs and soft murmurs.
John slowed, caught off guard by the sight of his own name. Granted, it was a common enough surname, and he certainly hadn't hired a car...
Sherlock pressed a button and a tinted window rose behind the driver, secluding them in a cocoon of darkened glass and buttery leather. He turned to John, slipped off his sunglasses, draped an arm across the top of the seat. “Alone at last.”
“I don’t bite,” Sherlock whispers, inviting John to complete what he desperately wants but is too afraid to consummate.
“There's plenty of time,” John reassured him, turning him by the hips and tugging his trousers lower. He sank to his knees, taking Sherlock into his mouth.
“The victim is breathless, entranced, drowning under the hands and mouth of this magnificent, handsome creature. And then she gasps — is it pleasure? Or pain?”
He tried to concentrate on breathing slowly, listening to the soft New Age music, willing the tension to drain from his shoulders. But then his ears caught the suggestive sound of Sherlock's breath hitching as the masseur worked on a painful knot, followed by a low grunt, a release of breath.
Sherlock closed his eyes when John kissed him again, his hands automatically sliding up his back when John rolled onto one hip to better angle their mouths.
Sometimes Sherlock judged the students with a critical eye, occasionally finding one mildly attractive. He did nothing about it, felt nothing strongly about it. Sometimes one of them would try to draw him into conversation or steer him away from the group for a private walk. He once let a student lead him into the grove of trees above the shore. He was a few years older, English, an aspiring playwright with rough hands and chapped lips. A bland disappointment.
John and Sherlock exchange an agonized glance, the mood deflated, then quickly disengage, zipping up and tucking in shirttails.
Sherlock quickly covered the purple mark with his shirt collar, trying not to blush. “Just a silly accident,” he lied. “Tripped into… something.” John's hot mouth, sucking and gently biting the tender skin above his collarbone, to be accurate.
“Right,” John’s tone was clipped, his face darkening. “Because a couple of days ago, you called me a useless twat.”
John said nothing, but moved his hand to the nape of Sherlock’s neck, holding him back, pulling him closer -- Sherlock couldn’t tell. He no longer cared. He took the chance, swiftly dipping his mouth to John’s, too eager, too forceful, a collision of teeth and lips and salty skin.
“That’s what caused it -- the blow to the head,” John said, noticing how the edge of the boomerang neatly fit the pattern of the injury.
It was a house dating from the early 1800s, tall trees surrounding the property. The wooden clapboard siding was weathered gray with slate blue shutters, the two-story home now divided into two apartments. Sherlock rented the top floor.
They toppled onto the bed, banging shins and gauging elbows in their haste. This time John had Sherlock pinned in place, straddled over his hips.
Sherlock couldn't help but let his gaze linger on John's chest for a moment, then he looked down at the tree, feigning interest. “Was it an apple tree?”
“Just find out if we had a relation who served with Captain Watson, alright? You’ve got every government record at your fingertips. It shouldn’t take you long.”
Tree bark bit into Sherlock’s back, his hand clutching John's skull, urging him to take his shaft deeper. He resisted thrusting his hips, denying the impulses that coursed red-hot through his veins.
His thoughts clicked back to work as soon as he saw a brunette woman walking toward his table. Tweed skirt, manicured nails, direct gaze, clearly an office girl from Whitehall. It was his contact, who would deliver the dossier to Mycroft.
His challenge goes unanswered. His straining ears pick up the steady ticking of the alarm clock on the bedside table, his heart beating equally fast. He doesn’t breathe, frozen, flashing back to the alleyway, terrified his assassin has somehow found him.
John fumbled at the zip of Sherlock’s trousers, their breaths ragged and panting, mouths smearing together until John finally freed buttons and zipper and pants. He sank to his knees, Sherlock’s cock stiff and weighty in his hand.
He sighs, allowing himself to acknowledge the reason for his melancholy. A year ago today John vanished from his life. The anniversary has been hovering at the edges of his mind for days, finally intruding, refusing to be ignored any longer.
John knew his mother wanted him to reach out to Harry, but he didn’t have the will. He had his own battles to fight; he couldn’t take on Harry’s, as well. He pushed back his chair, picked up his empty plate, and put it in the sink. He leaned down and gave his mother a quick peck on the cheek.
He stuck his hands in his pockets and hunched into his coat and scarf, beginning his walk back home. He looked up, a smattering of stars visible in the clear night sky. He soon came to the campus and decided to make a quick detour to his office to pick up a book he’d forgotten. He’d have plenty time to read this weekend since he had no other plans.
But it had felt like so much more… Like they had a special connection. They were so raw and demanding with each other one moment, then gentle and vulnerable the next, their bodies fervent conduits for something else running deep and unspoken… Two halves of a whole... almost like soulmates...
“Why are we stopping?” John had been dozing with his head against the window of the hired Land Rover, catching up on sleep after a late night. They were in the middle of nowhere, drowsy afternoon sun slanting across fields lined with neat rows of flowering fruit trees. Apples, probably.
Soon he'd get up and make a cup of strong tea and thick slab of jam toast, enjoying a few hours of solitude before Sherlock either stumbled half awake into the kitchen from his bedroom or swept up the stairs with a manic energy that had sustained him through the night.
I never saw them kiss. It wasn't anything as blatant as that. It was more like an invisible current, a magnetic pull that drew them together in small, powerful ways. Blink and you might miss it, the private smile, the hand resting between shoulder blades, the standing a bit too close together by the sink while putting away a few dishes.
The scrape, scrape of the blades against the dark scruff fills the small room, the rich scent of sandalwood rises from the lather, the warmth of Sherlock's body hovers around John's periphery. John is gradually mesmerized by the sharp, odd angles of Sherlock's face, so very different from his own squarish jaw.
Ensuring that Mrs. Hudson’s unpleasant ex-husband received a long prison sentence was just one in a string of unconventional jobs he had fallen into during the past year. Mycroft had paid him handsomely to complete a number of tasks that required “leg work,” as Mycroft had put it disdainfully. His observational skills, increasingly dubious knowledge of London’s underworld, and boxing abilities were all proving to be of value as he stitched together something resembling a career.
“Molly Hooper?” Mrs. Holmes tapped her chin thoughtfully. “She's the funeral director’s daughter, isn't she? Pretty girl… Dreadful atmosphere to grow up in, I should think.”
Finally out of the kitchen, he made his way to the garage where his bicycle was propped against the outside wall. He glanced back at the house. He was really doing this -- no turning back now. The wheels crunched against the gravel as he set off, his heart racing with adrenaline and anticipation.
“And in Afghanistan-- “ he halts, his voice going hoarse. He blinks a few times, takes a breath. “I saw a young soldier standing by a bed in the ward one night. As I got closer, I could see blood on his fatigues, but he just stood there staring at an empty cot. Then he looked up at me -- his eyes boring into me like he was wanting some sort of explanation -- and then he wasn't there.
I trudged up the steps, hot and annoyed after my walk. I reached the top of the stairs and paused. A fan was whirring in the corner of the sitting room, which was dim and empty. I peered around into the kitchen, which was also empty, silent except for the steady plink of the faucet dripping into the sink. Maybe they’d gone out.
Dad stopped and looked at me, then sighed, running a hand through his hair. It was more silver than I remembered. Sitting across from him, I could smell the antiseptic and soap scent of the hospital on his clothing.
“Don't say that,” John whispered, stroking Sherlock’s shoulder. “We have our lives ahead of us. Who knows what will happen?”
John said nothing. He'd been through all that with the army psychiatrist. Useless exercises that did nothing to dispel the dark thoughts from his mind or the nightmares that tormented him. He'd failed as a physician, a soldier, a husband. A lover. He met Sherlock's gaze, then glanced away.
John rubbed his face and sat up in bed. There was no use ruminating about it all now. There was a full day ahead, and he had plans to visit a few surgeries to inquire about work. He needed to bring in some money to supplement his pension.
“Business has been good. I decided to treat myself to something special.” John smoothed his palms up and down Sherlock’s velvet covered chest. “How are we going to get through this evening without ripping each others’ clothes off?”
He soon hears footsteps approaching the library, Hannah animatedly explaining the disappearing laptop and knife. She and Dimmock enter the room, and Sherlock pulls himself together to curtly answer Dimmock’s questions and instruct him to have the knife tested for fingerprints. He doesn’t mention the voice.
John could see her nowhere, so he handed Holmes the second drink and took a seat across from him on a tatty orange couch. It was too loud to talk.
Mr. Holmes worked his way around the other side of the car. “Is there anybody you’d like to invite up for a few days later this summer? Any mates?”
Somehow, John Watson of 1918 still roams this house, an echo trapped between life and death, past and present. Somehow, William is a previous incarnation of his own life. He and John are bound together by some thread that transcends time, but now they are out of sync, their paths intersecting despite being born a century apart.
There was an insufferably long pause, but at last a deadbolt clicked and the door cracked open. John peered at him without saying anything, then turned back into the room, letting the door swing open wider on its own.
That night Sherlock dreamt about touching John, naked and breathless, of being touched in return, wanting him, all of him, inside of him. He woke with an erection he desperately finished off by rutting into the mattress, panting into his pillow.
“Must be on a case,” he’d say, pushing his phone back into his pocket. On the train back home he'd check his phone several more times.
He watched Sherlock, making sure he wasn’t causing him discomfort. Sherlock held his gaze, flickers of emotions crossing his face. He gripped John just below his shoulders, his fingers digging into his back.
“Good enough,” Sherlock answers. John looks tired, and Sherlock feels guilty about involving him in his mistake. Oh god, and Olivia, who’s asleep upstairs. She shouldn't have been dragged into this drama.
So assuming it was flirting, his turn to reciprocate was long overdue. John rubbed his forehead in agitation. How could he have been so thick? Usually he was so good at this sort of thing — the little games of seduction. He just hadn’t been receptive to it, thinking there was never a chance…
Sherlock walked to the phonograph and switched it off, wishing Mycroft hadn't witnessed them dancing. He already felt at a disadvantage in his rolled-up shirtsleeves and braces, hands calloused and trousers dusty from the day’s work. Mycroft was impeccably dressed in a linen suit, his hands soft and lily-white.
Sherlock's expression was somber. “You were injured. But not in your leg, despite what the cane implies.”
But Sherlock simply leaned back in his chair and sipped at his drink, shifting his gaze to the window.
I sneaked into the bathroom and did my business as quietly as possible, not even bothering to flush. It was too embarrassing to make that much noise so early in the morning.
John smiled back, cupping Sherlock’s jaw with his palm. He found himself leaning down for another kiss, drawing Sherlock in close like a familiar lover. The ease with which he did it, and how completely natural it felt, surprised him. He could feel a flickering halt in Sherlock's response, as if he too was caught off guard.
There was a small salad of spring greens laced with champagne vinegar. They talked about past travels, Sherlock studiously avoiding any specifics about his most recent trip.
“Not supposed to,” John reminded him, barely able to form words, his hips pumping, his hands clasping Sherlock’s ankles, raising them out of the way.
“And could you possibly sit up straight in your chair? At this rate, you'll have a hunched back by the time you're 25.”
They had gone several rounds already, a sheen of sweat across their arms and faces, hair damp, thin vests clinging to their chests. Sherlock's style was wiry, quick, calculated, waiting for his chance to strike while gradually wearing out his opponent.
His phone rang, sparing me from any more observations. I didn't pay attention until he sat up, his back going rigid, and I knew it was bad news.
Sherlock nodded, then turned to leave, burning with confused humiliation. He was by the lilac bush when John called out to him.
“Could you find that old skeleton that Mike uses in his anatomy class and bring it down here? I think it’s in the storage closet next to the lab upstairs.”
Sherlock glanced at John’s profile, his eyes drawn to the coarse hair on his chest that was gilded gold in the light, to his dark rosy nipples, down to his navel. Irrationally, he wanted to touch him, run the tips of his fingers over the planes of his torso, slip them under the waistband of his trousers.
“My father taught me when I was a boy. I went away to school and he stopped raising bees at some point.” They began walking back to the house at a leisurely pace. “I decided to start again just over a year ago. Read some books, consulted with some neighbors, and here we are. It all comes back to you.”
Christmas had consisted of meeting Mycroft for an impeccable but soulless dinner at his club a few days before the actual holiday. They kept the conversation polite, the discussion centered on his current graduate-level studies.
John shook his head, his mouth a tight line. He finally spoke, his shoulders hunched. “Maybe it's not a good idea. To keep seeing each other.”
John’s stomach rumbled, interrupting the moment. They hadn't had a chance to eat a proper lunch. “Sorry, but I’m starving.”
It’s Christmas Eve and he’s glad for the quiet. No family arguments, no raucous parties, no unwanted visitors or social obligations. Just him. Mrs. Hudson is away visiting an old friend for a few days and Sherlock is… wherever he is. Probably the lab at St. Bart’s. John checks his watch, wondering if he might be back soon. Not that it matters.
“True.” John moved his hands to Sherlock’s hips and rolled onto his back, coaxing Sherlock to sit astride his thighs. He gazed up, marveling at the sight of him, hair a curly mop, dressing gown barely hanging on, eyes a fascinating blue-green, his skin pink from the burn of his beard.
“You’re like a moody teenager. Budge over.” Hannah shoves his feet aside and settles onto the end of the sofa, opening a magazine.
He stopped in the center of the room, realization sinking in. He clasped his hands around the back of his neck and squeezed his eyes shut, feeling his blood pressure rise. Goddammit to motherfucking hell, he was an idiot. He'd been played. The fucking suave son of a bitch had targeted him and stolen his laptop.
Sherlock was taken off guard, unsure if he should pretend not to understand her implication. He studied her a moment longer, then was certain that she knew the truth.
Sherlock shifted and slid off to John's side, laying his head on his chest, resting a hand over his ribs. He could feel John's rapid heartbeat gradually slowing, John's fingers stroking through his hair, the minutes ticking by. He never wanted to move again.
They lazed away another hour in bed, finally getting up to shower and eat a proper breakfast. John idly checked his phone, ignoring a few unimportant messages, realizing belatedly that it was Christmas Eve Day.
I guess I look more like my dad than my mother, who I've only seen in a few photographs. I squint at myself in the mirror sometimes, and I see an average girl with shoulder length hair, skinny shoulders, and an odd nose that I hope I grow into.
Sherlock fussed with his coat collar, preparing to go back out into the chilly weather. “Excellent.” He nodded curtly and let himself out the door, wondering if he was mad for suggesting this entire scheme.
Several seconds went by, then John broke their gaze, taking a deep breath. “I'll just… move out of the way,” he muttered, pushing the door open and stepping out of the car.
“So this is you,” John says softly, looking around, taking in the personal details — the periodic table and antique bee print hung on the wall, the expensive white sheets, the bespoke shoes, the scientific books and journals stacked by the bed, the childhood photo of him playing on the beach with Mycroft.
Sherlock slung the towel low around his hips, his eyes flicking up as if he could sense that he was being watched. His eyes locked onto John's.
He glanced at the list, mostly groceries and refills of Aunt Helen’s medicine. “Sure. I’ll go later this afternoon.” He looked forward to getting away from the house, even if it meant driving his father’s old Model T. Hardly a sporty car compared to the nimble Vauxhall.
“I know a detective inspector at Scotland Yard… he comes to me with cases they can’t solve. And I have a contact at St. Bart’s morgue who alerts me to oddities she finds on corpses—” he changes tack when he sees Nurse Cornish’s appalled expression. “And clients contact me through my website. Lots of missing dogs and suspected affairs, stolen valuables, that sort of thing,” he adds, trying to tone down the content of his work.
They walked to a pub down the street filled with a mix of tourists and locals, found a booth in a corner, and ordered martinis.
Resisting the urge to point out that telling someone about a surprise negated the surprise, Sherlock returned to the house and washed up before presenting himself to his mother in her study.
John placed his fingertips on the nape of Sherlock's neck, guiding him down to his mouth with the lightest pressure. Sherlock followed willingly, thoughts suspended as their lips met softly, testing.
Sherlock is drifting off under John's caresses, a faint smile on his lips. “Whatever you say, Doctor.”
A calm joy fills Sherlock, knowing that the universe has come full circle, a promise finally fulfilled. They’ve met again in London, and they’ll go to all his favorite places — obscure book stores and restaurants, forgotten tunnels and ancient catacombs, bridges and clock towers and graveyards. Above all, they’ll solve cases and come home together, drink tea and bicker and read by the fire, share the same bed and make love and laze away entire days tangled in each other’s arms.
The sudden pressure of two giant hands grasping his ass trips the wire on John's orgasm, and he’s moaning loudly, his hips stuttering, pressing and grinding out his hot, lusty release into Sherlock's body beneath him.
John closes his eyes, overwhelmed by warm skin, strong hands, the press of Sherlock's chest against his own. His fingertips bite into Sherlock's shoulder, his palm slides around Sherlock's waist, his mouth taking, giving, searching for more and more satisfaction.
John carefully sets the table back upright as Sherlock fishes his phone from his pocket. “I’ll text the clients and find out where the fuse box is. No use standing here in the dark.” He taps at his phone and frowns. “My phone’s dead. It was almost fully charged.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve noticed you tend to favor your left shoulder. Figure you tore a rotator cuff or something.”
Sigh... reunited at last.  We're getting close to the end, friends. I'm not sure if that makes me happy or sad!
The country manor they're investigating dates back to the late 1700s. It's grand but drafty, rife with heavy doors, fireplaces, ornately carved mantles and dark woodwork. Modern amenities have been added over the decades, and it now serves as an inn for those who enjoy long rambles along the moors. Somewhere in its long history, along with proper plumbing and electricity, the house has also acquired a ghost.
“Just… have a seat.” John tosses a towel over his shoulder and fills the sink with water while Sherlock sits on the edge of the closed toilet seat.
Sherlock could easily seduce men and women, rolling out that silky rumble of a voice, flashing those cheekbones. He’d watched him do it countless times, flattering and toying with some poor receptionist or assistant. John wondered how far he would take the ruse, if Sherlock ever actually slept with someone to get information.
Sherlock swallows, unable to gather his usual defenses of aloofness or disdain. He’s caught naked, vulnerable, his wits hazey, his emotions seeping through the bars of their locked cage like a mist. “A man. A good man.”
His mother let out a sharp breath in exasperation. “Ten citations for breaking curfew. Six physical altercations. Failure to attend class regularly.” She ticked off his offenses on her fingers. “Unauthorized use of laboratory equipment in your rooms. Theft of anatomy materials -- human bones, for God’s sake -- and to top it off, three vials of liquid cocaine found in a box under your bed.”
The box from the tailor shop rested on the chest of drawers, John's handsome charcoal suit folded neatly inside and nestled in tissue paper. The portraits -- signed and exchanged -- were now carefully wrapped and safely stowed in their luggage.
They descend the stairs to the foyer, dark but for a faint cast of yellow light from the street lamps outside.
“You sure?” She glances at the stain and grimaces. “You could change rooms, you know. Switch to one a little less gruesome.”
There was a soft tap at the door and John peeked in. “I thought I heard you moving around. How are you feeling?”
Sherlock picks up the papers from the desk again. It's enough, he tells himself, to see John regularly, to have his friendship, to know that he is well. Things will never again be like those heady, reckless days when it was just the two of them taking on the world.
Just now, by the stove, Sherlock had had the sudden urge to stand close behind John, press into his back, lean down, let his mouth hover over his neck as the steam clouded around them --
Of course he was tense, practically naked in the same room with Sherlock, oiled up, getting a couple’s massage, for Christ’s sake.
I breathe shallowly, fear and hope twining up my spine. A long moment passes, the air charged and heavy like a coming storm. Neither of us moves.
“You want a nice, billowy smoke,” Mr. Holmes said. “You don't want sparks flying out. That'll just make the bees angry.”
John appealed to him with his eyes, urging him to stay, but he turned away, vanishing toward the exit. John stared after him, dismayed.
Sherlock watched and listened attentively as his father demonstrated how to lift out, rotate, and inspect the frames, which looked like rectangular screens attached to wooden slats. Mr. Holmes spoke calmly, his movements gentle and fluid, being careful not to crush any bees. As the bees hummed and crawled around the hive, his father explained how he was checking the eggs, monitoring the food supply, and ensuring the queen was healthy.
“Maybe we should go upstairs,” John whispers, trailing his suggestion up the length of Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock was about to refill his own glass when Mycroft appeared beside him. “Not my preferred vintage, but I'll take another glass since you're pouring.”
“We won't be needing a second bedroom,” John murmured, pulling Sherlock close again. He kissed him, not urgently, but tenderly, deeply, promising to be there when he woke up every day, his partner, his lover, his perfectly imperfect soulmate found in a war-torn city. “One bed will do.”
Intimacy. That was the word he was fumbling for. It felt intimate to walk into their home, water bubbling, spoon circling, fingers mounding, scooping, cradling food.
They walked parallel to a stream that meandered across the fields of Farmer Callaghan’s property. John followed Sherlock, trusting that he knew where he was going. He also sincerely hoped that old Callaghan didn't shoot at trespassers.
John let Sherlock guide him through Chinatown and into a dimly lit restaurant where Sherlock rapidly ordered a number of dishes. John had no idea what most of the things they ate were called, but it was delicious.
“Sherlock…” John dared to extend a hand, wrapping Sherlock's fingers in his own. “I want that too, but how?”
“Hey,” she called out after him. “John and I are going to the lake on Saturday afternoon. Do you want to come along?”
It was late when they rode their bikes home, the lights mounted on their handlebars illuminating the path back to the villa. The epic sweep of the film, the stirring music, the rich colors had transported and enthralled them.
“Hm. If the police don’t come up with anything, which they probably won’t, let me know. I have a little time on my hands.”
John eventually drew back, a little breathless. “It's been so long.” He ran a palm down Sherlock chest, dipping to nuzzle an earlobe, lick a hot stripe up his neck.
The full moon hung low in the sky, lighting the way to John's balcony door. Even if it had been pitch black, Sherlock would have easily found his way. He knew the few steps from his room to John's by heart, knew the shape and weight of the door handle in his palm, knew the rustle of the sheets as John lifted them for him to slide into bed.
“Hang on,” John snapped, shoving his foot into the other shoe. He pulled on his coat, cramming a last bite of toast into his mouth. “How do you hear about these things, anyway?”
He waits, his gaze roving over the rain-slicked streets. He's dying for a cigarette but won't give in.
“They have a certain value if you're looking for specific faces, security details… I'm sure you understand.”
A mix of desire and curiosity floats through his veins like smoke. He wants to explore John with each of his senses, discovering and remembering small details. He’s drawn to John, driven by an insatiable need to be near him, to taste him.
He sank his cock deeper into the straining peach, thrusting slowly a few times, watching the skin of the fruit split open, two halves falling into his palms. He felt as ripe as the peach, his body about to burst, his flushed cock ready to spill its seed. He bit his lower lip, rubbing the wet halves over his cock, his breath hitching as he came inside the fruit. It was mesmerizing, scintillating, seeing his own milky come clinging to the peach.
, John chastised himself. He was really letting his imagination run wild. Too much booze and sex and not enough sleep. Still, that word
And if John were to take him in his mouth -- what would it feel like? Was he to supposed to move? What if he climaxed too soon? It was one hellish conundrum after another.
The word rolled about in Sherlock's brain all afternoon with John, knowing that this was likely their last stretch of time together. He was returning to university the day after tomorrow, the summer coming to an end.
They hung up their coats and slipped off their shoes, settling into their chairs with contented sighs. They sipped the scotch and compared notes about the long day, finally lapsing into a companionable silence.
John watched as Sherlock circled the area, his eyes sweeping side to side, walking forward a few steps, then backwards, glancing up at the sky occasionally in some elaborate dance. It made no sense to John, but it was fascinating to watch Sherlock hold out a hand, pace back, glance over his shoulder, and take several more steps back.
He pulled on an old pair of trousers and shirt, then crept from his room and down the stairs, holding his breath at every little creak and groan his bare feet made on the steps. He found his shoes and slipped them on, biting his lip as he slowly turned the doorknob of the back door and pulled it open as if he were a night thief.
Sherlock felt giddy spinning through the warm night, racing John up the final hill to the villa, winning by a narrow margin. Laughing, they propped their bikes against the shed, their legs weak, their lungs burning.
John smiled, shaking his head slightly. “You're absolutely mad.” He tilted the cap away from Sherlock’s forehead, a glossy curl springing free. He pressed into Sherlock, found his mouth, delivering a proper hello. The seat groaned softly as they shifted, the kiss deepening, hands roaming.
“John here is more of a traditionalist,” Sherlock explained, knowing John didn’t really care what styles were coming out of Paris. “He's going into the RAMC soon, so he’ll need something appropriate for off-duty occasions.”
He held his hand out to John and helped pull him up. Sherlock threw on his t-shirt and led John along the base of the cliff, following the curve of the cove. Picking their way over slabs of rock that jutted into the water, Sherlock jumped down to a sandy stretch of beach hidden around the bend of the shoreline, waiting for John to catch up.
Sherlock loitered in the background as his parents greeted their new visitor, asking about the flight, the train ride from Rome, was he hungry, thirsty? Sherlock was finally introduced by his mother.
Sherlock shrugged. “I just led her in the best dance of her life. That's more than a fair trade, isn't it?”
Sherlock crushed out his cigarette, his hand shaking. How dare Mycroft talk to him like this, meddling in things he had no right to speak of. “Just stop,” he finally choked out.
Sherlock's eyes flicked down to John's left hand, and John reflexively curled his fingers into his palm, hiding the ring he wore.
Sherlock’s eyes fly open at the sound of the soothing voice. A face looms into focus, half covered with a blue surgical mask, but the keen gaze and sharp slope of the nose are unmistakably that of his brother.
“I don’t like dancing.” It was a lie. He loved dancing, but not here, not in front of John with all those people.
John slid his fingers along Sherlock's neck, up into his hair, tugging him closer, slowing Sherlock, guiding him, their knees bumping as they turned more fully into each other. The wooden dock was hard and uncomfortable, but John barely noticed, lost in the thrill of lips seeking and shaping, a hitch of breath, a slight sigh.
He closes his eyes, sees the glint of the knife blade slashing towards him. It happened so quickly; he had thrown his arm up defensively, the blade slicing through his sleeve and burning across his skin. He stumbled in pain, only to receive a blow to his head. He thinks he was kicked, he can't clearly recall. He just remembers that it fucking hurt.
“You should lie still. Tell me about the world,” John murmurs, stroking Sherlock’s hair. “About London.”
Sherlock walked over to the kitchen table where a very fine bottle of single malt scotch whisky and two heavy glasses waited. He picked up the bottle to admire it and smiled. “Bless you, Mrs. Hudson,” he murmured.
John stopped his impulse to hurry forward and check Sherlock's injury, instead gripping the bag he held in his right hand. Sherlock would be fine. He clearly relished the refined brutality in the ring, the discipline and technique a far cry from the rough and tumble fist fights John had been in. Still, he would not want to be at the receiving end of Sherlock's long arms and big fists beneath the boxing gloves.
“Here -- look for yourselves.” She gripped the corner of the sheet, then hesitated. “You’re prepared to see this, right?”
He turned his attention back to the road, still thinking about Sherlock. Molly was the only person he'd met so far who was anywhere near his age. He'd arrived in the village just a week ago with his mother, pressed into duty to help look after his ailing great aunt. Hardly the way he had pictured the summer unfolding.
But no, he had to go back further, find the true source of blame: himself. If only he hadn't lied to John about his disappearance, leaving him in the dark for two years about his faked suicide, breaking his trust… losing him.
He went to the house and marched straight to the telephone, ignoring his great aunt’s stare as he picked up the handset and asked to be connected to Musgrave Hall.
John’s breath hitches, torn between a burst of surprise and jealousy and a thread of hope. Sherlock, admitting that he’s been in love — with a man — causes a small earthquake in John’s heart.
John eased his finger in further while slowly taking him deeper in his mouth, his gaze unwavering. Sherlock let out a helpless whimper, melting under John's touch.
“Absolutely not! It's Mycroft's turn! … Mother --” Sherlock sighed heavily, evidently losing the argument. He raked his hand down his face in defeat. “Fine.”
John pushed himself up onto one elbow to gaze down at him. He took Sherlock's hand in his and guided it to his own chest, placing Sherlock’s fingertips over the top button of his shirt.
They walk to the elevator without speaking and John punches the up button. There’s more silence until the elevator doors rumble open and they step inside. John rubs the back of his neck, his eyes on the floor, and Sherlock clasps his hands behind his back, rocking once on his heels, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. The elevator groans as it ascends. The doors finally slide open again.
John remained hunkered in the train compartment, letting the other passengers push and shove their way out onto the platform. Through the grimy window he watched couples reunite, friends warmly greet each other, businessmen and workers hurrying on to their next destination.
John walked closer, stepping into the light of the narrow hallway. The smirk on Sherlock’s face morphed into an expression of wonderment, his hands drifting down to his sides and his mouth forming a small O.
“Dreadful. Just dreadful.” Mrs. Holmes clucked her tongue, turning the pages of the newspaper at the breakfast table.
John balked at the thought. Wearing the gloves would cross some sort of personal boundary, wouldn't it?
Sherlock swiftly pressed John against the wall, his pelvis pinning him in place, his mouth roving hungrily, his palm smearing the mirrored wall above John's head where he braced his hand.
Sherlock tries to resist sounding pleased, but gives up pretending to be mad, groaning out words of encouragement, his fingers in John’s hair. His back arches, knees tighten, and he hears himself moaning out John’s name.
John thrills at the mere suggestion, wanting somehow to do both. But he has to choose. “I want to fuck you,” he manages to pant, “like that, with you on top.”
He raised himself onto his knees, positioning himself on the tip of John's engorged cock, then sank down slowly, eyes half closed, fingers anchored into John's chest.
He closed the door behind him, his eyes taking a moment to adjust. A sliver of a window set high up in the brick wall let in a small amount of light, enough that he could finally make out several shelves, boxes, and burlap bags, a wooden work table pushed against the wall.
“This is a farce,” Sherlock snarls in frustration. “Well done!” He shouts toward the ceiling, into the air. “Excellent performance! Can't wait to see what's next.” He runs an agitated hand through his hair.
John lifted up on his toes. He finally saw the busy flit and bustle, flashes of black and yellow, heard the hum. He smiled.
Not wasting another moment, Sherlock drove to John's house, the honey placed securely on the passenger seat. When he arrived, John was lugging a broken cane-backed chair outside, which he deposited near the garage when he caught sight of the blue Vauxhall.
They gazed at each other in the moon’s glow, drinking in small details they wanted to remember forever.
I had a hard time imagining Sherlock as a boy, but then I couldn't picture Dad or Aunt Harry as kids, either. Then I tried to imagine myself being their age -- middle-aged -- and I drew a blank.
John falters, distracted by Sherlock’s eyes, which seem to have changed colors in the semi-darkness to a silvery grey, his pupils wide. The way Sherlock is intently focused on him sends a thrill down John’s spine. He licks his lips, unconsciously leaning closer.
“I think,” I finally said, “that you should ask Dad how he feels about retirement.” I stood up and brushed the grit off my jeans. “I'm going to go back home so you two can talk.”
Armed with a plan, John drew the curtains shut and busied himself by building a fire, warming the room. He sat in his chair, watching the flames leap and dance, one ear listening for the front door to open.
The journey had been subdued, the compartment filling with several businessmen engrossed in newspapers and a pair of middle-aged ladies who vanished behind thick novels.
Sherlock bites back a sarcastic answer and patiently tries to explain. “I solve problems other people can’t. I observe what others don’t, apply basic science, and deduce outcomes using facts.”
His outburst was effective -- John quickly turned his attention to the water and Molly bit her bottom lip.
Something in John’s voice made Sherlock scan his face. He was nervous, apprehensive. Sherlock furrowed his brow, sliding the paper closer. Was he asking for something extravagant? A sleek sports car or a trip to Machu Picchu?
But then his face changed, going out of focus, melding into someone else. John. It was John touching him.
Nursing a pint, he read the first few chapters tucked at a table in a back corner. When a shadow fell across the page he looked up, John’s blue eyes warm in greeting.
“Er, about that.” Mike smoothed his striped tie, looking uncomfortable. “One of the regular professors is taking a sabbatical this year, so we’re a little shorthanded. We brought in another visiting faculty member to help cover the load.”
John sighed and stuffed the gloves into the back pocket of his jeans, annoyed that Sherlock's carelessness had nearly caused him to tumble down the stairs and break his neck.
He was barefoot, mussy haired, sipping coffee and making eggs like any other Saturday morning at home. Sherlock was still resting, nowhere to be seen.
It was first-year stuff, facts he'd learned long ago, but it was reassuring to tick off the list. This was something concrete that he knew when nothing else was making much sense.
The sheet slipped from John's lower back, sleet pattering against the glass, the long hours of velvet night pooling like a secret gift before them.
Intrigued, John flicked one more glance back, a row of hedges obscuring everything but the numerous chimneys punctuating the roofline of the manor.
Sherlock gazed at John, undeterred. “That old saying about there being a thin line between love and hate. That’s us. If I felt indifferent… I wouldn’t be here.”
The quiet is broken by the buzz of John's phone vibrating on the nightstand. John fumbles for the phone, reads the text.
Septic shock, Sherlock can’t help himself from deducing, leading to organ failure. Antibiotics didn’t exist at the time.
His skin is damp, the fine hair below his nape gleaming in the light. John reaches out and touches the pink raised line. It will leave a small scar, nothing remarkable, only he and Sherlock will know its story. John reluctantly lifts his finger away.
John would always be the one to remind him to see the beauty in the world, to look beyond the cold facts and hard science to embrace the very human foibles and passions that he had spent so many years trying to deny.
John's palms slide back to those taut buttocks, his fingertips sensing how Sherlock will move, anticipating the lift and drop of his hips. John gazes up at Sherlock's face, the shadows playing across his eyes and cheekbones, the glow of candlelight illuminating the planes and angles of his torso. It's so good, this moment, the waves rolling onto the shore, the balmy night and clear sky, their bodies coupled together.
John takes a drink before answering. “Sometimes, when something odd happens, you just share a look. You don't talk about it, ok? Or if you ever do, it's over too many drinks late at night after a shift from hell.”
Sherlock hears the phone vibrating across the top of the coffee table and ignores it. He knows it's John. He's sitting in his leather arm chair, the inky dusk settling around him. There’s not one stitch of holiday decoration in the flat, no tree or fairy lights or garland, just a small stack of unopened Christmas cards tossed on his desk.
“Then I'll tell you.” John leaned in conspiratorially. “I'm a man who's about to finish his drink and walk into that pharmacy over there to buy a few necessities. You're going to finish your drink and pay the tab, then wait for me on that corner.”
John stood in front of him, possessed by a singular objective. “No,” he answered, shaking his head slightly, “it's not quite right.”
“Oh — God —” Sherlock cants his hips upwards, his fingers digging into the mattress. He comes, bursting into a million stars, his mind blank, timeless, nothing but primal pleasure rolling through his body.
“So you're the brother,” John stated, making no move to shake Mycroft’s hand. “The office worker. A clerk or something, isn't it?”
The waiter approaches and John carefully withdraws his hand. The moment is lost again. But once the server is gone, John looks at him, searching his face.
Their feet are close beneath the table, their knees almost touching, a current passing between them. John’s blue eyes are inky in this light, stubble shadowing his jaw. Sherlock could gaze at him for hours, amazed that he’s real and within arm’s reach.
cook," John pointed out, dipping out a ladle of broth and easing it into the pan. He stirred the rice.
Sherlock crosses his heart, then waits a few minutes until he’s sure they’ve left. He springs up from the chair and quickly gathers a few supplies from the cabinets, then takes the elevator up several floors to a vacant lab where he occasionally works. He stashes the supplies in another cabinet, then checks his watch. Just after midnight.
“Okay, so those were the top cases. Anything else?” John asks as they walk into the bedroom and lift back the sheets.
“I just… I swear you look familiar.” The doctor shakes his head, clearing it. “I haven’t introduced myself.” He extends a hand. “I’m—”
John paused on the landing, holding the heavy white envelope that was obviously very expensive stationary. He turned it over, looking for a return address. There was none.
Sherlock is straddling a wooden chair, his forearms folded on the seat back, his shirt off so John can tend to his injury. It’ll take four or five stitches to close the gash, the cause of which Sherlock was vague about.
The bedroom was separated by a set of French doors covered with a gauzy curtain. Only one bed. A very large one. Very good.
Sherlock watched as John hoisted the last flagstone from the back of the lorry, the tendons in his forearms standing out in relief beneath the rolled up sleeves of his chambray shirt. John lugged it toward the path marked out with twine and wooden stakes.
They stood an arm’s length apart, the air tense between them, aware of their proximity, each pulse and breath heightened.
There was an unspoken agreement, it seemed, to not talk about the sudden shift in their relationship. Not yet. It could wait. Hours, days, maybe weeks. Or maybe it would just be this way, seamless.
