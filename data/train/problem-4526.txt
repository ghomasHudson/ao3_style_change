I have some pretty good reasons for being gone for so long.
He pulls Castiel’s bottom lip into his mouth and licks against it. Cas groans as he opens his mouth and Dean slide his tongue inside. They kiss deep and slow, both of them making sounds neither has heard before. It’s exhilarating and erotic and Dean is kind of terrified because now that he knows he can feel this way he never wants it to stop. Castiel bites gently on Dean’s bottom lip as they pull away to breathe, and it’s too far, there’s too much space between them now, but any space is too much so Dean pulls Cas back in and kisses him like maybe this kiss has the power to promise them forever. Cas grips him so tightly, Dean’s sure there will be bruises, but he doesn’t care. Castiel is holding back, Dean knows he is and he won’t stand for it.
Dean brought his lips down to Cas’ and pulled him into a soft chaste kiss.
Dean looked concerned for a second, but then his face brightened and he smiled brilliantly.
“Don’t you think it’s a little risky to go into business with your friend?” Mr. TDB asked, one eyebrow raised.
“Looks delicious,” Castiel responded. His hand went to Dean’s lower back as the firefighter tossed the salad a few more times, this time adding the dressing he had made.
“A year at least,” Castiel responded, walking towards Dean and Jo. “Maybe two.”
“Ah Dr. Castiel to the rescue,” Michael started again. “And how goes your orthopedic practice? I hope the soccer stars and Bengay enthusiasts are treating you well.”
Well not
Castiel’s face lit up, dropping Dean’s hand and reaching for the older man with a smile. “How lovely to see you, Roberto.” They hug, Roberto squeezing Castiel tightly and grinning from ear to ear. “How is your family?”
“Considering...?” The man finally turned to look at Dean and raised an eyebrow at him.
Castiel and Dean shared a look of fond annoyance for Gabriel, and then took a breath in tandem. With a final nod of cautious determination, they left Castiel’s childhood bedroom hand-in-hand.
“Yeah -come in.”
And Lisa broke up with him again.
The heat from the fire, the pain from the bone-crushing pressure, they lingered as Dean’s eyes shot open. He was sweating, his body felt overly moist and incredibly uncomfortable. His heart was beating rapidly in his chest. His breath came far too quickly. Castiel was lying beside him, looking incredibly concerned with his hand on Dean’s arm. Dean closed his eyes again.
now.”
Cas continued. “And in that parallel, Collette has attributed her position in Cain’s life to my position in Dean’s.”
The flight is just a haze, small moments of Castiel holding Dean’s hand or a flight attendant offering him something to drink. Dean doesn’t panic, the anxiety medicine works beautifully. Unfortunately, it isn’t until they are in the car outside of Castiel’s parent’s house that Dean finally gets his wits about him again.
Dean didn't have a chance to fully absorb what had just happened though. He rushed back to Cas’ side who had fallen to the floor with a hand over his bleeding neck.
“Can we put them in?” Ollie asks.
Castiel pounced.
Dean pretended like he didn’t hear anything about Bela running cons with Alex, and just dropped his head with another sigh.
“What is it that you want then?”
“Not really,” Dean answered. “What’d she do?”
“Don’t say anything, I’ll lose my nerve. Just, uh, let me get through it.”
Dean felt like he was hit in the gut. The air in his lungs were forced out in a violent push and he found himself struggling to catch his breath. He blinked rapidly and his vision began to blur which confused him until he realized he was shaking his head.
Dean recognized it immediately.
It was Dean.
His boyfriend of over a year, up and left him less than a week ago, and he wasn’t at all prepared to take on the holiday alone. Any other year he would just drink too much and make fun of everyone else at midnight, but this year he would rather go to bed at 8:30 than go out and watch everyone else be happy around him. Except that his friends aren’t going to let him get away with not having a date, so it was either go through his address book when he got home, or prepare to get mauled by Uriel when the ball drops.
“Castiel, I know I should have told you-” Anna started but she was interrupted.
“Ever since that call, yeah.”
“He still manages to make an impact,” Castiel replied, squirming in his chair. “Family gatherings in the Novak household can be very tense. My sister Anna is the only bright spot in the entire affair, honestly. Jimmy just stays out of most things, and Gabriel purposely makes everything more difficult.” Castiel paused. “I just want you to know what you’re getting into. You can obviously change your mind, or we can head home early if-“
Castiel laughed.
“What if you have all that, and you still can’t find anyone to share it with?”
Of course Michael would have a date a week after they broke up. Of course it would be someone gorgeous.
As his thoughts roamed over Collette’s words earlier he couldn't get past her use of the word lover.
Tears began to stream down her face. Her body shook and crumpled in on itself.
“What are
“I stole his grace Dean, he is mortal now. Metatron doesn't wish to die, and now he can. I think we can use that to our advantage. Perhaps there is more to all of this than we realize.” Cas took another step closer. If Dean reached out, he could feel the stubble on Cas’ cheek if he wanted.
“Dean!” Castiel said, his face completely drained of color, his eyes wide and red, his hair a mess. He was still in his pajamas, and he managed to look both relieved and absolutely furious at the same time.
“Don’t you get it?” Alex spit back. “I don’t
Meg stepped closer and placed a hand on Castiel’s arm.
They stopped driving when the moon was high in the sky and pulled over at a rest stop that had a National Park entrance.
“But, I want you to recognize alternative solutions when they’re available, and not be so ready to give everything away all the time.”
Dean nodded. He understood that. He was about to speak when Castiel called up from the balcony.
“I like this.”
“Yeah, probably.” Dean sighed. “But what’s the point? I don’t have anything figured out. I gotta get my crap together before I can start anything real with Cas. My life...it’s gotta be a litte less full of shit.”
“Um, blue?” Dean answered. Castiel could hear his friend’s apologetic smile through the phone. “Is that okay?”
“He told me that when God created humans, he told the angels to love them. And we did. He told us to accept them as his children, and we did. I have loved you since before I first saw the shredded remains of your soul Dean. I loved you as I pieced you together and pulled you out of hell, and I loved you through each battle we fought together and against one another. I love you now, standing here. It was a part of your creation, to be loved by me.”
Dean squinted up at the sky for a moment, then laid down on his back and closed his eyes. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the sound of the other ways his life could have gone, he just really loved being a firefighter. There was just something about it. Dean’s head turned and his eyes instinctively went to the hill where his parent’s graves were. It was as if his body was giving him the very answer he sought. He hadn’t been to see his parents yet, the magnetism of Inias’ grave was just too tempting to put off. Dean had been going to his grave almost as often as he went to talk to his parents. It was assuredly strange. So strange that Dean hadn’t told Castiel about the habit, but Dean didn’t think the doctor would mind. Or, at least he hoped he wouldn’t mind. Dean enjoyed talking to the slab of rock that represented the love of Castiel’s life. It was bittersweet, in a way, knowing that Dean was sitting atop the grave of the person Castiel had loved the most. It was also more than a little morbid.
“So did you...ya know.” Meg wiggled her eyebrows.
Cas remembered dropping the blade, guilt ripping through the happiness he felt at the sound of Dean’s words.
The man, who hadn’t been looking at Dean when Dean decided to say the stupidest thing imaginable, snapped his eyes in Dean’s direction.
Charlie squealed as she clapped her hands with glee. “Yes! Dean, that’s so awesome! I’m so happy for you guys!”
“I’m sorry, what?” Castiel asked. He placed his bag down next to the living room couch and tentatively stepped closer to the kitchen.
“I’m a firefighter,” Dean answered. Castiel’s shoulders squared. Despite how much he feared Dean’s job, Castiel was proud of his firefighter boyfriend.
“Well,” Dean answered. “The second one is easier to answer so…I guess I didn’t tell you because I wanted to avoid a moment like this. And then I just kept
“You don’t know that,” She responded.
Dean continued to stare off into the void for another moment before blinking rapidly and narrowing his eyes at Sam.
“Is there anything I can help you with, Sir?”
“Yes,” Castiel replied. “It’ll be a change for Dean. And hopefully my family won’t be too terrible.”
But he was unsure of what that meant. Human emotions still evaded him in many ways and Cas couldn't figure out what Dean’s confession really meant, or the feelings behind his words. It added up to something Cas knew to be improbable.
“Listen,” Anna said, almost nervously. “I’d love to get together soon, so we can talk.”
Dean’s mouth turned down into a disgusted frown. “He tried! Damnit Sam- what were you thinking?!”
Dean was pulling his suitcase from the top of his closet when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He juggled the suitcase for a moment before throwing it on his bed and reaching into his pocket for his phone.
“Lunch? Cas, this is not lunch. This is snacks.” Dean replied. He opened the bag and tossed a few cheetos in his mouth as he got back into the car. “Lunch involves a meal, preferably with beef of some kind.”
“Fine!” she shouted. “Then you can get the fuck out too!”
Dean was dumbfounded. He wasn’t put out that Castiel didn’t want to talk about Inias, but he was extremely confused about whatever it was Castiel was holding back. Castiel had said he wasn’t ready to discuss it yet, though, so Dean was going to respect that. Relationships took trust and Dean trusted Castiel to come to him when he was ready.
“A kind doctor who makes me laugh and puts up with my bullshit?” Dean quipped. “They’d have begged you to marry me.”
Suddenly, all Dean could see was red. He could see the veins pulsing through the skin on the demon’s that held him. He found himself staring at the demon’s neck, mesmorized by the vibrations the flowing blood caused.
Luke asked if it was him, or if Castiel just needed more time.
This entire situation was incredibly sad and frustrating to Sam.
“And how about now?” Castiel whispered, his tongue tracing the lines at the hollow of his neck.
A voice blared through the overhead speakers, announcing that their flight would begin boarding. The man across from him stood immediately and joined the forming line. Dean shuffled in after him, about fifteen people behind.
—this feeling that was flowing through him—he’d never felt anything like this. It felt solid like ancient stone, but it moved through him like freedom. This, he knew, was what the beginning of forever felt like.
Punch.
Dean smiled and nodded his agreement. “Well, you got me there.” He placed his hand on the girl’s good arm as they raised the stretcher to begin rolling it towards the ambulance. “You’re not dying though, kid. You lost a lot of blood but your vitals are pretty good.”
Dean watched as Bela got on the elevator, her smirk pulling into a fake grin as the doors closed between them. He didn’t know how he was going to handle this. Being the go between guy between Alex and Bela wasn’t a good idea. It definitely wasn’t ‘keeping a healthy distance.’
“See? It’s official. Powers out. Mover’s are picking up the rest of the stuff tomorrow afternoon.”
Dean stifled a laugh, and squeezed Castiel’s hand tighter. “Just open the door, Dick.”
Just as he was about to give up on the third day, he saw him.
“Oh god!” Castiel shrieked and hid his eyes.
Dean balked. “No offense Cas, but I’ve never seen you drive and I don’t really want to start now, while we are riding in my baby.”
“Nah,” He replied. “Easy peasy my lemon squeezy.”
Sam thought about that for a moment before nodding in agreement.
“Your favorite.” Dean nodded. “Just have to add some salt and then it’s ready.” Dean reached for the container of salt in the cabinet above him. “I may have some leftover meatloaf in the fridge. Not exactly what I was going for but- shit!”
“Happy?” Sam repeats. “Jack, we’re in Heaven. Of course we’re happy.”
“Why not now?”
Castiel sucked in a long, stuttering breath.
The sun was setting for the day and Dean continued to smile lazily into the sky. He had just pulled a cold beer from the cooler and couldnt help but pull a classic Coca-Cola gasp as he took a sip of the hoppy sweetness.
Dean and Castiel laughed.
“Think about what Collette said Dean.” Sam’s face became animated as he tried to convince his brother. “I mean, really think about it. She said that the reason Cain eventually fell back into darkness was because he couldn't accept her love for him. He couldn't let himself believe he was worthy of it.”
Castiel had walked into their sitting room with the intent to announce that, 1.) He was gay, 2.) He had a boyfriend, and 3.) He planned to move out and live with Gabriel and his girlfriend. Unfortunately, as soon as Castiel entered the room, Charles Novak must have known what was coming, and just shook his head.
“Inias? That’s the ex-fiance, right?”
He turned around slowly, avoiding Dean’s gaze until he was standing right in front of him.
Dean reveled in the praise, sucking at Castiel’s cock like it was his god given right. His own erection was throbbing with the need to be touched, but Dean ignored it. His time would come. Right now, all he needed was the weight of Castiel’s shaft against his tongue, the push of his cock against the back of Dean’s throat, and the steady rumble of Castiel’s pleasure.
“Alright, Alright,” Dean groaned. He opened the door with a sigh. Jo stood there with her arms crossed. “You couldn’t wait another minute?”
Dean’s lower back and began working his thumbs and fingers into Dean’s neck.
Clarence immediately ran to the bowl and began eating hungrily.
“How do you even know that’s what I want?” Dean accused.
Castiel didn't hesitate. “Of course.”
“Please Collette, if there is anything you could tell us to help us remove the mark, anything that you wish you could have done for Cain, anything at all-” Cas cut himself off, fearing his tone was becoming far too desperate.
“Unacceptable,” Castiel responded back, his voice muffled.
“I know this would be a really huge step for us, especially since we
“If only,” Castiel smirked and began placing light kisses along Dean’s jaw. “I seem to remember you patching me up that night though, just as I’ve done to you tonight.”
“You know what you’re doing,” Dean said, pointing at his brother with his full fork. “You’re already picking out wedding china or some shit and that just ain’t it. We’re just living together. So cool it.”
“First of all, why would I get mixed up with someone who I know first hand, will get off with the first person who knocks on his door?”
“Come on, lovebirds,” Gabriel said. “Time to face the inquisition.”
I am, without a doubt, so very sorry for waiting a year to update this story. I have been on the receiving end of an abandoned WIP that I loved and it KILLED ME. So, from the bottom of my heart, I apologize.
of you, Cas.”
“We can’t live like that,” he said confidently, as if he’d already had this conversation. “Inias died. He died, and I mourned for him. And then I met you. I met you and fell for you, and that’s the story we’re living in.” He paused, pulls Dean’s face into his hands. “That’s the only story I
Dean got the picture and raised his hands slightly in surrender,  and he nodded in understanding.
He watched as Dean let the second Demon drop to the ground, his screams still bouncing off the walls of the warehouse.
The flight attendant looked sympathetic, so Dean kept going.
“Its not enough just to love him. Loving is the easy part. Sacrifice- that's really at the heart of love...wouldn't you say?” Metatron’s voice teased, but his face stayed sober.
“Nah,” Dick replied. “I got a thing.” He took one look at where Dean was pointing then headed back out into the hall where his equipment was already loaded onto a dolly.
Dean sipped his beer leisurely, watching Castiel dance with Charlie and Jo to a song he had never heard before but would now play on repeat anytime he masturbated to thoughts of Castiel. His eyes didn’t leave the doctor as Castiel swayed and rolled his hips, taking in the long lines of tight, black spandex. The mask covered one of Dean’s favorite parts of Castiel’s face, the little lines around his eyes, but he had a good view of the doctor’s smile.
“She’s pulling through. The poor thing is going to need physical therapy for the better part of her adolescence, but we think she’ll keep her arm. She’s sulking right now, so it may not be the best time for a visit.”
“Everyone loves KFC, Cas. It’s un-American not to love KFC.” Dean finished his coffee and stood up. “I’m going to go up and shower. Probably bang on Gabriel’s door for a few minutes, too.”
“Right.” Dean said quickly, dropping his menu immediately and standing up from the table to lead them out of the restaurant.
“Comparing yourself to Jesus before 10 AM? Has to be a record for you.”
“I’m saying that if I had to choose, Dean, I’d choose you.”
“Oh, okay.” Castiel nodded in a patronizing way. “You do that.”
“And nutritious,” Dean added with a corny smile. Castiel wrapped his hands around Dean’ s waist and put his chin on the firefighter’s shoulders.
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up, Dean’s unfiltered mouth surprising him again.
“What family isn’t?” Charlie replied with a sad grin. “My parents aren’t exactly winning any awards.”
“We sell accessories now too, little brother. Don’t pretend like you two don’t use enough lube to fill a bathtub.”
Sam clenched his jaw so hard he could hear the grind of his teeth in his ears.
Charles said nothing, instead looking to Castiel to respond. Castiel simply closed his eyes and buried his head in his hands.
Dean’s spirits must have made a dramatic U-turn, because he seemed to have a lot more energy than before.
Sam turned away to leave the library but was suddenly frozen in his place. Cas saw his body stiffen and whipped around to see what it was that had startled Sam.
On the surface, we know what we want. We know what we need. Deep under the skin, though, way beneath the performance we endure, is an unknowable truth that keeps the silent things loud and the loud things unimportant. The bruises on his face, the smoke that still lingers in his lungs, the angry strain in his jaw—loud things. Castiel’s haunted gaze, defeat across his shoulders—silent things. Dean’s helplessness—silent. Castiel’s fear—loud.
Five minutes later, he called again.
“Hey darling, stay still will you?” Donna asked carefully, her voice strained with the sight of the teen’s disheveled arm. Donna immediately began triaging the wound, pulling items out of her bag as Dean assessed other injuries and looked into the backseat for another victim. There wasn’t one, but there were two bodies in the front, neither of them moving.
Eventually, Castiel murmured against Dean’s neck, “I’m sorry.”
“What the hell were you thinking, Gabriel?” Castiel started, his anger rising again. “How dare you invade our privacy like that! I’m pretty sure what you just did was illeg-“
“God.”
When Dean arrived at the station that night, his crew was called out almost immediately. He spent the evening reviving overdose victims and consoling grieving loved ones. His arms were sore by the end of the night. Chest compressions could really take a toll, and when the victim died anyway, his arms seemed to ache even more at the end of the shift.
“I support the band Baz, but I-”
“Oh well that sounds incredibly simple then. Thanks Cas.” Dean snorted, his menacing tone surprising even him.
The truth was, Dean was terrified of opening himself up to Castiel completely, just to have Castiel focus on the details of his job rather than the emotional trauma Dean seemed to be undergoing. He wanted Castiel to support him, support his job. He also didn’t want to do anything to upset Castiel or make him question his decision to be with Dean.
“Or,” Anna said, with a cock of her brow. “I could hook you up with Uriel. He’s been asking about you-”
“I want to go to Earth,” Dean says in a rush. “I want a chance to live a life for me. I want…” Cas, he thinks. I want Cas.
“Where is he?” Dean asks, stepping forward into Jack’s space. He doesn’t know what he’s doing anymore. His body is just a collection of cells and he only has control over half of them. “Where’s Cas?”
“I managed to transfer our flights to tomorrow,” Castiel told Dean over their continental breakfast. “It’s a red-eye, so we’ll need to turn in early this evening.”
Naomi finally came around to tolerating, but not accepting, Castiel’s sexuality around the time the doctor met Inias. They were getting serious quickly, and Gabriel told his parents about how happy Castiel was. They insisted on meeting him, and Castiel complied.
“Alright,” Dean said with a yawn. “I’ll be right there.”
It wouldn’t be unprecedented for Castiel to just fall asleep right then and there, with the doctor’s odd sleep schedule he could be narcoleptic at times, but Dean knew he was still awake. He knew it because when Dean tilted his head and kissed the doctor’s cheek, Castiel buried his face in the firefighter’s neck.
“Then why did you ask me?” Dean shot back. He hated it when she got like this. When she acted like all he did was fuck up.
“You know what Dean,” She was carrying a plate of bacon wrapped scallops to the table. “I’m tired of this. You’re never here, and even when you are here, you’re still not here.”
“I just said-“
“Yes.” Castiel nodded and looked up at the moon. “Very shitty of her.”
Castiel held the roll of film between his fingers and stared down at it like the pictures inside had the potential to alter the course of history.
Dean was pretty sure he had never seen anything so hot and beautiful at the same time.
He wasn’t sure, but Dean swore he saw the man smile as he turned his head away from him. When Mr. TDB didn’t say anything else though, Dean decided to let his teasing nature take the wheel.
“Uh huh.” Castiel replied back, not even looking at her.
He married Dean two years after Castiel crashed Sam’s wedding. It was a small ceremony, with just family and a few close friends. The wedding was held at the National Park they had pulled over at, the night they took the picture under the full moon.
Dean was instantly and overwhelmingly aware of how extreme his reaction was to something so innocent. He hoped the rush of adrenaline he felt moments before wasn’t recognized as deeply as it was felt.
That first meeting went about as terribly as Castiel thought it would, with his mother’s icy demeanor and his father’s ambivalence. Naomi thawed for seconds at a time, when Inias would talk about his church upbringing, or his gardening abilities, but largely she just stared at them for two hours. Charles said maybe five words during the meeting, all of them ambiguously kind. Castiel was grateful for the kindness at least.
Castiel was drunk.
“I’m just going to glide past most of that, and concentrate on the part where I’m not technically family,” Dean replied, rolling his eyes at Gabriel’s wicked grin.
“Truthfully? No. But, I love you and this is a thing couples do, so yeah. Let’s do this thing.” Dean  squeezed Castiel’s hand back, then took it so he could point harshly at Gabriel. “But you are not invited.”
came in two hours late, still drunk, and holding up his date from the night before. Dean refrained, though, and took his licks.
It felt good to get that out, but Dean was left with a very confused looking flight attendant. Also, he just embarrassed the shit out of himself by unloading on her like that.
“Too much information, Meg.” Castiel said as Dean laughed.
Castiel moved slowly further into the house. He found an empty sitting room, aside from piles of jackets, and school pictures of Dean and his little brother along the wall. He took a moment to admire those, before moving further into the house.
, you’ve got that whole, ‘I don’t understand that reference’ thing that I know you sometimes use to manipulate a situation to your advantage. You’re a crafty one, Cas.”
“Don’t be like that!” Charlie chastised, taking one of Dean’s French fries and throwing it at him. “Be excited! It’s going to be so much fun! I’ve got your costumes all-ready so all you have to do is show up!”
That’s when he saw her.
They both cried during the ceremony, and they both laughed. They had hired a photographer, but Castiel took a lot of pictures himself. He wanted to be sure he had evidence of the dance off Sam and Dean had, or the look in Dean’s eyes when he stood up and thanked everyone for coming and gushed about his new husband.
“Cas. Don't.” He managed to get out before turning around and giving his friend his back.
“Cas-“
Dean shut the door behind him after he stepped through the threshold, and immediately found himself pushed up against it. For a split second he thought Castiel was about to take out all of his frustrations on Dean’s dick, but then the doctor just slumped against him. Their bags dropped to the floor, and then Dean’s arms wrapped around Castiel as the doctor breathed against his neck. They didn’t speak for a long minute. Dean just held his boyfriend, and Castiel just breathed Dean in.
“I think I’m done.” Castiel said. “Thanks for recommending me, I think these will turn out great.”
Castiel felt Dean’s hand on his back, and a piece of him settled. He wasn’t alone here. All he had to do was say the word and Dean would go off. The firefighter was purposely holding his tongue, taking Castiel’s lead, but Castiel knew that Dean had plenty to say. But it should be Castiel. Castiel should be the one to finally stand up and let go of this notion that this was something he had to tolerate.
“I guess we’ll see.”
Sam whipped his head around to face the angel and then turned back to the books in front of him. He let out another deep breath before answering. “Nope.”
“Lust. Mostly.” Cas answered casually. “But there is also something deeper, your affection for me is quite strong.”
“Got it,” Dean answered. He worked methodically around the living room and hallway as Charlie requested, sticking orange pumpkins to the wall every so often. After about five minutes of silence, there was a knock on the door.
“Oh come on Cassie! I’ll be in and out before you even know it. Disinfectant is included! Plus, a discount for you and your-“
“I had a hunch,” Castiel replied with a grin. Then it fell slightly, and Dean was reminded of the nervous expression the doctor wore the night before. “Would you…do you think we should rent a place or…”
“No,” Castiel replied quickly. “Don’t move.”
“What? Really?” Castiel asked, eyebrows lifting dramatically. “They’d do that?”
“There will be no gushing,” Dean argued, his finger in his brother’s face. “But the other stuff sounds good.” He led the way to the backyard with the steaks in one hand and barbecue tongs in the other. Ben was still working hard on his space ship, referencing the instructions with a very focused look on his face. Dean sent him a small wave as he slid open the back door and stepped outside.
“Oh right!” Castiel joked. “The majorly successful internet start-up.”
“Where are you moving?” Castiel asked, walking further into the apartment to stand next to Dean as he lit the candles, casting the room into soft yellow and orange shadows.
He held Oliver’s hard gaze for another moment before turning sharply and walking out the front door, leaving the door wide open.
“Hello, Castiel,” Naomi answered. Charles raised his eyes over his book and stared. “Happy Thanksgiving.”
“Well out with it then.” Dean said, hands on his hips again and an annoyed look on his face.
“Actually,” Castiel pushed himself against Dean, slotting his thigh between Dean’s. “If memory serves, there are a couple of things I need to thank you for tonight.”
Dean frowned and sipped his beer again. The DJ began scratching another song onto the one that was currently playing. It reminded Dean of a 90’s hip-hop song that was essentially a compilation of sex sounds.
“Maybe, but I think I’m pretty sure it’s what I want to do.” Sam said back, eyes on the road as he drove their father’s car up to the departure lane at the airport.
“So, I’ve got news,” Dean announced to the dinner table, taking in Sam and Eileen’s immediately interested expression. He signed as he talked, knowing Ben would have trouble getting all the words from his lips like Eileen could. “Cas and I have decided to move in together.”
“Cas,” he whispered again and propped himself up enough to look down at the man beneath him. Castiel’s eyes were hooded in a post-sex glaze, but they cleared when Dean looked at him. He kept his eyes open as he leaned back down to press a gentle kiss against Castiel’s lips again. Castiel smiled beneath his kiss, and Dean had never felt such pure unadulterated joy before.
“Awkward?” Castiel laughed. “Dean I’ve seen you eat Jello out of a cup with your nose and tongue, I think we’re well past awkward confessions.”
Dean absorbed his brother’s words carefully. He took in each syllable in silence, but kept the hard grimace on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In a minute,” Castiel replied as he kissed down Dean’s bare chest. “I’m busy.”
Dean pulls back so he can look in Castiel’s eyes again. They’re wide and hopeful and Dean could just live in them. He really could. It’d be ten times better than Chuck’s Medium Place.
“What can I say?” She smiled wide. “I’m a renaissance woman.”
Castiel kept his eyes on Dean, who looked nothing like his old self when he showed up on Castiel’s doorstep. Where Castiel remembered Dean’s eyes being bright and cheerful and his smile genuine and unhindered, now he saw dullness in the man’s green eyes and not even a hint of the smile Castiel knew Dean was capable of.
As Castiel’s moans get louder, he takes a pillow and covers his face, a standard practice for them when they are trying to be quiet. Dean can feel Castiel getting close, so he sinks down again and lets the tip of Castiel’s penis hit the back of his throat. He swallows around it.
“Sure, we’ll see you later sweetheart.” The woman called after him as Castiel smiled and waved, leading Dean away.
Dean saw Castiel’s car in the lot, so he was sure he was home, but he didn’t know how long it would be before Castiel heard him. If he would even hear him at all.
“Dean- we have to talk about this.” Sam’ voice almost matched Deans, but his was laced with frustration.
“Yeah.” Dean replied, lighting some more candles. “Good timing, huh?”
This wasn’t Castiel anymore. He wasn’t this person and he certainly didn’t want Dean to think this was the reason he called him. Well, not the
“There’s something I want to talk to you about,” Castiel replied, wrapping his arms more tightly around Dean’s waist. “But not now.”
“Oh, good. That’s good.” He was breathing hard, his chest rising and falling far too noticeably. Dean buckled his belt hastily. He moved around Castiel and back into the kitchen.
Dean propped himself up slightly and looked at the mess between their bodies. Then he shrugged and kissed Castiel again.
Later that day, Castiel walked through the courtyard of his apartment complex to get to his front door. He had his camera bag on his shoulder and was humming a song he couldn’t get out of his head. As his key slipped inside the lock of his door, someone spoke behind him.
“Cas,” Dean begged. There was too much air hitting his cock and not enough of Castiel’s mouth. To settle him, Castiel reached down and gave Dean one long, luxurious stroke, just as he pulled the firefighter’s other nipple into his mouth. “
“Right,” Dean nodded. He turned to his boyfriend. “Alright, well then. Cas?” He shrugged. “We doin’ this?”
The two chapter conclusion to the Thanksgiving Special will conclude tomorrow. Let me know what you think so far!
“Ugh, Cas!” Dean groans. “You dick.”
“Great?” Dean balked. “Cas, there’s weeds growing out of one of the toilets. Literally.”
“But my grace is borrowed, you took my own for the spell to cast the angels out of heaven.” Cas’ tone became harsh again, his body tensing in anger.
Dean didn’t know what to think about that. He wasn’t afraid of the commitment aspect so much, but owning a place together was a really big deal.
“No,” Jack says. “That was Chuck’s story. There is no destiny anymore, Dean. You don’t have to follow a script.”
Castiel picked up his fork and began to eat again.“Suppose that’s true. Although, meeting in the hospital while you’re lying unconscious isn’t the best circumstances.”
Castiel shrugged and gestured towards the hotel where the party was being held.
“No.” Dean said quickly. “Well, yes, but I won’t in six years.” He finished writing out the number and pushed the receipt to Castiel. “Call that number in six years, and ask my parents for my new number. And I bet when you call my ridiculously hot husband or wife will answer the phone.”
“Hola, Dean-O!” Gabriel rose from edge of Alex’s bed and walked over to Dean. “Fancy meeting you here!”
It’s not just because the guy was gorgeous, (even though his cheekbones and jawline might actually be the definition of handsome) but because not half an hour ago before, the guy was sucking face with someone else. Although, Dean thought it safe to say that relationship was probably over.
“Not necessarily,” Meg said. “I mean, I’m taking that train wreck Alfie from work, but Anna is going stag. You could too.”
Dean liked the sound of that. “That makes sense. That way we can just focus on what we like or don’t like, and not…you know…” Dean was about to say, ‘
He moved through the house again slowly, cringing at the odd smells and particularly ugly crown molding that circled the dining room light fixture. Dean purposely looked past the stained carpet and imagined hard wood floors instead. He imagined the large windows clean and useful, and he pretended not to smell the things he definitely smelled.
Dean stood up quickly and pushed his hand out to Michael.
He gave Dean one last smirk, which was dangerously close to a genuine smile, then walked off into the night.
“Will I lose my arm?” The girl asked slowly, very little emotion in her voice. It was likely she was in shock. “Are my...parents...?”
“What if we hit it off? Become a thing or something?” Dean replied, moving around a couple with a stroller.
Dean looked down and admired the muscles that had formed in his boyfriends chest over the last few years. Sam liked to pride himself on training Cas so well, and Dean didnt care if Sam wanted to take credit. Cas had always been fit and well defined, but now he was positively ripped and Dean always found excuses to touch him. He would slip his hands up Cas’ shirt and stroke along his abs as Cas poured them coffee in the morning. He would dip his hands down the back of Cas’ pants and squeeze his muscular butt whenever Cas was wearing sweatpants. Cas loved the attention, despite the eyerolls he would give his boyfriend.
Dean leans against Baby and thinks about what he might want to do with his life. With no monsters to hunt, he could get a real job. A house. A family. He could build a cabin in the woods and call it a Roadhouse. There are so many possibilities—Dean’s shaking from it. This place Chuck threw them in, this place that makes him forget what happiness really feels like, this place pulses around him and inside him. He’s content, it says. He’s perfectly content. He has everything he’ll ever need here. It’s a lie and now Dean knows it.
Dean stood there a moment more, his eyes full of shock and confusion. Then, the corner of his mouth lifted and he joined Castiel in a conniving grin.
He’s wearing his cheekiest grin as he pulls out his keys and moves toward the car. His feet feel heavy until they don’t. As he reaches for the door handle, his hand shakes until it doesn’t. He frowns as he settles in his seat and Sam slides in beside him. The seat feels off, scratchy despite the denim divide, but by the time the key is in the ignition, he’s smiling again.
“I like the sound of that,” Castiel replied, working his way down Dean’s neck. “You should say it more often.”
“And it’ll just be airplane bathroom sex until then?” Castiel asked with a laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas had pulled Dean’s hand into his own and was looking intently at the elder Winchester.
“Dean,” Castiel repeated. Their foreheads came together as Castiel thrust into him faster and faster. “I love you so much, I- Dean, I-“
Dean blushed, he’s sure of it, and sat as quickly as possible. His seat was a few rows ahead of Mr. Tall, Dark, and Blue’s, but despite how much he wished he could spend the flight staring at the stranger and making up ridiculous fantasies about the man, he was glad his own face was hidden. He did take another calculated glance back, feigning interest in the man behind him who was arguing with the flight attendant about his seat, only to find Mr. TDB staring back at him, smirk firmly intact.
“Understandable,” Castiel replied, rubbing his hands up and down Dean’s thighs under the water. Dean loved the sound the water made as Castiel’s arms moved through it. “You’ve been pushing yourself too hard.” When Dean didn’t respond, not wanting to argue about his work, Castiel continued. “I’m glad we were able to have this weekend together. I have an ER rotation next weekend. I assume you’ll have a shift at the station?”
“It’s just this feeling…I don’t know.”
“What’s wrong?” Castiel interrupted, his brow furrowed.
“This is wonderful,” Eileen said as she signed for Ben. “You two are so good together.”
Castiel nodded, even though Dean couldn’t see him.
“Okay,” Sam said carefully, then placed the knife he was using to chop lettuce down on the counter and turned to face Dean. “And where does Cas fit into this?”
Cain got Collette killed when he let her close, when he let her be with him.
Gabriel’s eyes widened, but didn’t question him. Instead, he immediately packed his bag as well. The three of them walked down the stairs, just as Jimmy, Amelia, and Claire walked through the door. They were all smiling until they saw the look on Castiel’s face.
“Do you have plans to be elsewhere?” Castiel asked, his eyebrows raised in challenge.
He remembered how free he felt as a demon, and despite his resolve to never become that thing again, he longed for that feeling in this moment. He wouldn't have to struggle with the soul crushing emotions that tore at him, he could push all of it away. Dean could feel the mark pulling him farther and farther into the pit and he didn't know if he would continue to have the strength to fight back. Especially not with the idea of running away from it all at the front of his mind.
“Let’s go.”
“What kind of flowers did you get?”
When they arrived at the cemetery a few minutes later, each of them with a bouquet of flowers in their hands, Dean didn’t know how to go about the next step of their plan.
“My mom, my- AH! my dad. Please- please help- are they- are they- FUCK!”
his shift was due to start, Dean bolted to the only bathroom his apartment had, leaving Castiel to throw up in Dean’s kitchen sink.
“I’ll see you later, Miss Alex,” Gabriel told her with a wave. “I’ll be expecting a rematch you know.”
“This is great and everything Dean, but can I get married now?”
“Yes.” Castiel said, coming to stand next to him and handing Dean a cup of tea. “I do a lot of different things. Weddings and birthdays and things like that for money, but a friend of mine is opening a gallery downtown and he said he’d hang some of my stuff.”
Eyes on fire, skin sizzling with tension, Dean tugs gently on Castiel’s hand and pulls him into a hug so soft Dean’s positive he’s blushing like a school girl. In response, Castiel hesitantly wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, settling there lightly until Dean pulls him even closer and buries his head into Castiel’s neck. With Dean’s breath against his skin, Castiel’s hold tightens. His body relaxes, though, and it melts against Dean like maybe Cas has been holding his breath the entire time they’ve been apart. Dean’s hands start trailing slowly across the back of Castiel’s neck, in his hair, down his shoulders.
“I’ll grab a couple beers and meet you outside,” Sam replied. “We can do ‘man things’ like grill steak and drink beer while you gush over your boyfriend.”
With the free arm the nearly decapitated demon had set free, Dean reached across to the other Demon that held him and thrust two fingers into the demon’s already wide eyes. More screams echoed in the warehouse as Dean pulled the eyes out with a pluck of his fingers.
Charlie shrugged. “Deal. Jo has to work and won’t get home until after it starts so I could use an extra hand.”
Dean’s chest fell noticeably at the declaration. Sappy moment aside, Dean couldn't help but feel a wash of disappointment sinking his heart as he tried to absorb what Cas was saying.
Dean rolled his eyes and let his pouting expression pull into one of acceptance. “Fine,” Dean replied, “Be that way.” He picked up his keys from the coffee table and put them in his pocket. “Come, eat my food, then leave me all alone,” Dean started walking towards the front door but turned back abruptly, pointing at the doctor with a superficially stern expression on his face. “But don’t expect me to put out. I’m not that kind of girl.”
Dean could see Castiel’s chest caving in.
“What’re you doing over there?” Sam asked.
Castiel nodded as he smiled back at him. “Yes you did. And now I owe you one.” His smile twisted into something coy and sexy as he pulled Dean closer.
“Nope,” Dean replied with a smile. “But, and call me crazy, I don’t think that’s what you really want, anyway.” Alex opened her mouth to argue, but Dean put his hand up and continued. “Okay, maybe you don’t want my company, but you certainly need
“Well,” he sighs and turns to rest his back against the railing. “It’s heaven. I’m sure there’s stuff I want to do.”
Sam let out a sigh and shrugged apologetically.
Castiel sighed as they reached the large wooden door that led to his parent’s sitting room. “This didn’t go well the last time I tried to do this.”
Dean’s lips twitch into a smile. “So he’s on Earth?”
They were kissing before Castiel knew who leaned into whom. Their lips meeting was a mutual and simultaneous effort. They kissed slowly, deeply. Castiel could feel it in his thighs, down to his toes. It was the kind of kiss one thought about when their minds wandered. It was the kind of kiss that would linger on his lips for days to come.
Castiel sighed behind his menu and took another peek at Dean.
At that, Dean smiled and placed his hands on Castiel’s hips, drawing him closer. “Thanks, Cas. I know that.”
“You look so good like this.” The doctor’s voice was rough, thoroughly debauched. “But I think there’s a better use for my mouth.”
The caller ID said it was Charlie and a wash of both panic and annoyance ran through him. He hit the accept button and brought the phone to his ear.
Dean furrowed his brow. This wasn’t exactly something he’d ever hoped to hear. But. He loved Castiel and if he needed to tell Dean about why he loved Inias so much, then he would let him.
Dean thought about it and then, yes, he did realize how ridiculous it sounded.
“It’s seriously nothing, Sammy. Just a hard day at work,” Dean replied as he placed the steaks on a plate to take out to the grill. “Nothing to get worked up about.”
“Ugh.” Dean said, smiling down at Castiel as Castiel laughed at him. “You’re a mess.”
Dean groaned and gestured towards the door to the house. “Don’t you have a pregnant wife to bother? I’m sure she could use some help tying her shoes or something.”
Dean half-walked, half-hobbled through Charlie’s doorway an hour before the party was set to begin. With his arms full of bags of decorations she requested he pick up, Dean could just barely get through the door before dropping everything on the ground.
“Did you just hear…?” Dean asked, looking towards the DJ booth and narrowing his eyes.
As he reached up to grab it though, something caught Dean’s eye in his peripheral vision.
“Don’t, what?” Dean asked, brow furrowing as Mr. TDB continued to stare straight ahead.
Castiel could barely hear her.
“Yes,” Jack says. He smiles. “He was the one that found you.”
“Maybe,” Dean said. He picked up her journal and handed it to Castiel. “This will probably give us some insight, but I feel like a major creep reading it.”
Dean’s arms wound around Castiel’s waist and pulled him in, and Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck as they kissed into the New Year.
The way Dean understood fate, was that if you were destined to do something or meet someone, fate would make it so. Was that what was happening with him and Castiel? Were they destined for one another?
“Yeah, I mean- just go over there and tell him you want to actually be with him.”
“You’ll ruin it.” The stranger with the incredible blue eyes replied.
“Hey, what about your reward for being such an awesome husband?”
“What?” Castiel asked.
Dean stroked her hair as he soothed her, and Alex continued to cry.
“So, thanks for that.” Dean said, once they were clear of Castiel’s mother.
She opened her door wide and gestured the men inside. When both men took weary steps inside her bedroom, Charlie gave them a mischievous smile.
Dean planted a polite, apologetic smile on his face, but took another glance down the long and wide hallway that led to the security checkpoint. The crowd was too thick for Dean to find him again easily, but just as it was Dean’s turn to head to the counter, he caught one last flash of blue and white plaid.
“Hello?” He asked, his phone not having the number programmed.
“Dean, you-” Castiel tried to say, but Dean cut him off.
“Cas promised me Xanax. It was non-negotiable.”
“How about a round of shots for everyone?” Dean said as he backed into the room. A new song began to play, something Castiel recognized. A patient of his played it on repeat during morning rounds yesterday.
“Oh.. Dean.” Cas moaned in pleasure. Dean smiled at his ability to make the angel writhe beneath him and he brought his hands to the waist band of his pajama pants and pulled them down, boxers too, in one quick movement. He used his feet to help push them off his legs all of the way as he worked the fastener on Cas’ pants.
“It’s not going to take twenty years.” Dean shot back.
“A few days ago,” Luke answered. “Good behavior combined with a terribly overcrowded prison means early parole for me. Shame for all those kids with simple drugs charges, taking my place.”
He crossed his arms as he took a breath and let it out forcefully.
Dean’s voice was steady and sure when he said, “I’m going to resign.”
“What? Why?”
“So, how's everything with you and Castiel?” She asked, changing the subject to save her from Dean’s wrath.
His heart was a steady beat of terror and pleasure as he brought his fist up quickly to Cas’ jaw. Cas took the blow full on, even though he could have defended himself easily from the assault. He whipped his head back up, staggering slightly backwards.
“Okay, after it starts, the shutter will stay open for forty seconds, so you have to stay completely still for it to work. Okay?”
Dean’s eyes traveled to the angel’s hand on his shoulder, meer inches away from the place he marked him the first time Cas touched Dean.
“Okay Dean. Sorry.” Sam said softly before absorbing the push of Dean’s shoulder into his side as his brother moved past him and out of the room.
“You’re moving.”
“Listen, Alex,” Dean continued. “I’m so sorry this happened to you. No matter the cause, you can’t blame yourself. It isn’t healthy.”
The man eyed Dean cautiously but seemed to like what he saw because his expression softened a moment later.
“I’m going to try and get some sleep Cas. Maybe you should think about just coming clean to Dean about the whole thing. You guys can figure out the rest once he is cured.”
“Yes, I got that part,” Castiel replied with slight irritation. “I can understand that. But why go at all? What could you possibly gain from it?”
Walking swiftly towards the door, Dean plastered on a winning smile and opened the door. Cas was looking down at his phone at first, but his head popped up at the sound of the door opening and gave Dean a pleased smile.
“The butt! The guy said it was good. Lousy bastard swindled me.” Dean walked back into the kitchen and began stirring something in a large silver pot. “Potatoes look alright, at least.”
Dean hated the idea instantly, but then remembered the sight of Castiel’s cock gliding over his cheeks, and pulled his mouth from the doctor’s cock. He was about to get dicked down, and
He stumbled as he walked next to Dean up the flight of stairs to Dean’s apartment. Their arms were linked and they were laughing about something, but Castiel couldn’t remember what.
Dean shivered when Castiel stroked the back of his neck with his thumb. The doctor pulled away after a few more moments of slow, sweet kisses.
“And you’re avoiding.” Meg answered, cutting Castiel’s path off. “What do you hope to find on that roll of film, Castiel? Dean isn’t actually in there, you know that right?”
Jimmy and his family went right back out the front door, with Gabriel, Castiel, and Dean trailing closely behind.
“Ha. Ha.” Dean said, rolling his eyes. “Laugh all you want now but we’ll see who’s laughing in two years when my life is the picture of perfection.”
Dean loves the sounds he can get out of Castiel. He loves it so much, in fact, sometimes just the sound of Castiel coming will put Dean on the edge of doing so himself.
They had talked about children before that moment, both of them agreeing they wanted them, but wanted to wait a little while before having any. But Castiel didn’t realize how much he wanted to raise a family until he saw what an amazing father Dean would make, out on that dance floor.
Castiel thinks it was more than friendship, more than love, that finally brought them together.
And not just a little bit.
Cas wasn’t Dean’s lover, but for all intents and purposes he might as well be. Dean had finally admitted to himself that being with Cas was something he wanted, but he knew he didn't deserve a love like that. After everything he had done, after all the damage he had caused, there was no way Dean was going to allow himself to bring Cas down with him. Any love Dean could give to Cas would be tainted, Cas’ own purity would dissolve into the darkness that thrives in Dean’s soul.
It was nights like that, where he didn’t fight any fires and barely saved any lives, that Dean really hated his job. A few weeks ago, Dean would have been too afraid to talk to Castiel about it, but now things were different.
“I’m not decrepit, Sam.”
. He was already at Gabriel’s, who had a plan to move them across the country. Gabriel saved Castiel, which is probably why Castiel still lets his older brother do just about anything he wants without repercussions.
“I did de-God Chuck, as you said, but it didn’t happen the way you think it did,” Jack tells them carefully. “I did absorb the energy from Michael’s death, but before I could strip him of his powers, Chuck shifted you into a new reality and disappeared.”
“There’s only so much emotion i can take Dean, get a grip.”
Dean walked slowly into the living room and sat down on the couch. “Well, if you’re going to be an asshole I might as well get comfortable.” He hoped it sounded casual, but his voice shook and Castiel knew him too well now.
Dean walked into his beautiful San Francisco victorian home, and shrugged off his jacket.
Dean had his hands under Castiel’s shirt, his thumb rubbing circles into Castiel’s hips while Castiel stroked Dean’s tongue with his own. Their lips moved at a hurried pace and their breathing went ragged with the effort.
Dean didn’t like that at all.
going on in the kitchen.” Dean made to argue but ended up just shrugging and throwing a thumbs up to Ben before following his brother into the kitchen.
“Mayonnaise?”
“What?” Dean balked. “That was with you!”
Their eyes were locked again and Dean didn't think he could take much more of this without giving in.
Dean’s cell phone rang in his pocket, just as he was leaving his venture capital meeting with Ash. The meeting had gone well, he only messed up once during the presentation, but he felt like they did their best. Now they just had to wait and see. The investors said they’d call them within a week, so they wouldn’t have to wait long.
“Dadda!” Emily says. “Color! Color! Pamcake color!”
“Alright,” Sam said as he pulled ingredients from his refrigerator. “Lay it on me.”
He didn’t, not really, he had no idea why Castiel was telling him all of this but moments ago they were talking about taking in a teenager so he figured it must be important.
“Stop.” Charlie held up her hand for a moment, then reached across the table with it and placed it on top of Dean’s. “Whatever it is, it’s nothing to be embarrassed about Dean. Shit happens. Everyone deals in their own way. And sometimes…sometimes people need help dealing. That’s okay.”
“No thank you.” Castiel cut her off. “I’m not interested.”
Castiel nodded.
Castiel eventually collapsed onto the table with his head buried in his arms, no longer able to keep up the game but still unwilling to give up all together.
“What’s wrong?” Castiel repeated. His voice was coated with concern. “You look…something’s wrong. What is it?”
Of course, there was still the anger that hummed from the mark, pushing and pulling and making it impossible for Dean to think straight. He could hear it whispering to him, telling him to shove Castiel again and stab him through the chest with his own Angel blade.
“What if- I mean, you said, but-“
“I understand.” Dean nodded, small smile still on his lips. He moved further into the kitchen and opened the drawer nearest to him.
“It was cool of you to come home, Sammy.” Dean said, staring out at the ocean. “I know you’re busy.”
“Okay,” Eileen said cautiously. “So where do you think you’ll live?”
“He did?” Castiel put a few more books from his book case into the box. “What did he say?”
Dean placed his tea on the table and got up from the couch. When Castiel re-emerged from the kitchen Dean was standing by the door again.
Hello Lovely (and patient) readers!
Cas stared at Dean for a moment before nodding. “Yes, I can get it.”
Dean liked the sound of that. If they took this dilapidated house and turned it into something beautiful for them to share, Dean felt sure he could get out from under Inias’ shadow.
Castiel dipped back down and followed the V of Dean’s abdomen with his tongue. “My mouth?”
!” Dean cried, jerking his head up and pushing back harder against the doctor’s finger. “God I love that you’re a doctor.” He bent back down and kissed along Castiel’s jaw. “We should time you, see how fast you can-
Dean knows the answer so he just starts thinking about what he’ll say to Cas when he sees him. He didn’t have a chance to say anything before The Empty took him—hell he didn’t even have a chance to react. It all happened so fast and now he’s not even sure if he understood Cas correctly. He feels nervous until he doesn’t. His mind is telling him he’s happy—telling him he has everything he needs here.
“I get that,” Dean said. “I really do. I imagine losing the love of your life does that to a guy.” He gave Castiel a sympathetic smile, but Castiel’s expression hardened.
Dean sighed and let the embarrassment wash over him again. This woman didn’t care about his problems, and she definitely didn’t want to be sitting there hearing about them.
When he got to the hospital, Dean took the elevator to Alex’s floor, feeling a little nervous about his plan. He had a deck of cards in one pocket and Exploding Kittens in the other. Teenagers could be tricky. Dean knew he couldn’t just go in there and ask the girl to play a game with him. He’d immediately, and, most likely, viciously, be shut down.
Dean stared back at his brother for a beat, trying to convince himself that Sam hadn't picked up on the very real feelings Dean had for Castiel.
Alex had no response for that. She pursed her lips, an irritated expression that made Dean feel both triumphant and sad at the same time.
“He plays guitar.” Mr. TDB defended, even though Dean could tell he would rather say something else about the blonde asshole.
Dean rolled over in his bed, the sound of knocking on solid wood coaxing him out of a dream he forgot as soon as his eyes adjusted to the light he had left on.
“It sounds like she wasn’t being very supportive.”
Dean wanted to growl as the annoying little twerp exited the room, but with Alex watching he held it together.
When Dean showed up six months earlier, Castiel almost chased after him.
“Right.” Cas breathed out and leaned back in his seat. His head cocked to the side for a moment before pursing his lips slightly and leaning forward again. “He is coming. I think after what happened earlier tonight it’d be best for him if I wasn't here right now.”
“I’m sorry Sam,” Jack says. “Eileen has chosen to stay in Heaven. She doesn’t know I’ve found you. It’s possible she’d change her mind, but when I gave her the option, she chose to stay in Heaven. She’s adopted a child who died from meningitis. She’s happy.”
“Dean.” Cas said his name as much a warning as it was a question.
Sam laughed kindly and patted Dean’s shoulder once before dropping his hand. “Do I need to revist the bourbon hypothesis?”
“I’m fine.” Castiel said with a sniff. He wiped his eyes.
Jack tilts his head in confusion. “What do you mean? I told you he helped rebuild heaven. I think he’s currently…” Jack trails off and his eyes glaze over. Seconds later he blinks and smiles. “He’s currently helping a young woman find her lost cat.”
Dean took that thought and let it marinate. What Alex said could be true, who was he to tell her it wasn’t. If Sam hadn’t been born, would Dean’s mom still be alive? Without Sam’s dog pulling her back inside their burning house, would Mary Winchester still be around? Maybe. It’s just too big to think about that way, though. Too many variables.
Sam laughed. “Not really, but at least it's honest.”
“My teacher says the Native Americans helped the Pilgrims with food and shelter, and that Thanksgiving is about recognizing that generosity.”
Castiel let out a giggle and pulled Dean in as close as he could, turning their dance into a sort of swaying embrace. He continued to laugh into Dean’s shoulder until all the drinks suddenly caught up with him and he was desperate to relieve himself.
They set a fast and dirty pace, with Castiel’s hand gravitating from Dean’s shoulder to his hair. He pulled just enough to mean it, slamming into Dean over and over as Dean moaned beneath him. Dean reached out and grabbed the headboard in front of him, holding on for dear life as Castiel pounded into him.
“Now you’re a goner,” Bella finished with a smile. “It’s alright. It happens to the best of us.”
“What do you do?” Charles asked Dean.
“Well, I’ve got a sexy penguin outfit under here,” she replied. “Spandex and a little bow-tie.”
He ate lunch across the street and perused a comic book shop for a few hours to kill time, looking up at the street’s window every other minute to see if he could see Castiel.
It was fine. This was fine. He couldn’t
However, with Castiel’s naked body pressed against him, Dean found it incredibly hard not to move. Castiel looked up at him with the most awed expression as he stood stark still, and Dean returned the look, just as captivated.
“We’re out,” Gabriel announced. “You coming?”
“It will be the death of you.” Oliver warned. “Not to mention the two of them as well.”
Dean’s lips tickled Castiel’s ear as he whispered to him.
Castiel didn’t know what. He was going to find out.
“Oh yeah,” Sam replied. Dean could tell he was smirking. “The big Novak Thanksgiving has arrived. Nervous?”
Dean fights the Mark.
Dean kept his head in his hands for a long time.
Seeing Michael like that was a step backwards for his self-confidence, but that wasn’t the reason he was more than ready to go home with Dean. Dean was fun and knew how to make Castiel laugh. He was gorgeous too of course, but that wasn’t the main reason Castiel was so attracted to him. Dean was kind and understanding, while also being an obnoxious pest.
A shift had occurred, somewhere between Dean’s joke about furries and Castiel’s confirmation that they were, in fact, ‘doing this’, and Dean felt the world tilt on its axis. The seriousness of this step, the undertones of what it meant, it overwhelmed Dean in a wave of emotion.
“Considering what happened.” Dean answered, lowering his voice slightly and stuffing his hands in his pockets.
Despite the gentle swoop Dean’s stomach gave at the moment they had just shared, he nodded and pulled himself free of Castiel’s grasp. “Yep, all ready. Just need to add the dressing.”
The boys go to the psychic to learn more about the Mark.
Dean watched the tide roll in with his brother by his side for the first time in what felt like years.
Sam began to nod. “If that's what you want. Yeah.”
“Yeah.” Dean said, pulling open another drawer and then the cabinet above it, apparently looking for something.
Just as he was imagining what it would feel like to have his hands on those hips, his thumbs rubbing circles into what looked like incredibly soft skin, the stranger looked right at him.
They looked liked they were about to kiss.
Dean felt incredibly foolish for letting himself hope that the angel loved him in the same way he did. He scoffed slightly and ducked his head in an attempt to hide the angry embarrassment that threatened to lash out.
Charlie shook her head again as she began strategically placing candles and spider webs. “More like I put an ad on Craigslist and this guy was the only one to answer.”
Then, with an arrow that pointed to the camera:
is the artist’s most popular piece.”
“Sleep well, Dean.”
“Dean,” Cas panted slightly, his breath becoming ragged. “This isn't you. Stop this.”
Castiel groaned into another kiss, licking into Dean’s mouth and stealing any breath he had reserved. Gasping, they pulled apart, and Dean watched as his soon to be live-in boyfriend started peppering kisses down his stomach, into his groin, across his thighs, then back up to the tip of his penis. It was pulsing with need by this point, rock hard and desperate for attention.
in all his life.
I couldn't be stopped.
“You know what Balthazar? Fuck you.” He began to walk towards the double doors of the airport’s entrance, a place Dean should have definitely been heading as well, instead of gawking at the scene these two had caused.
“And what’s your excuse for eating like that now?” Castiel asked with a smirk.
“After dancing?” Castiel nodded. “Well, you see, I was trying to recreate the night we first kissed. You know, dinner, chess, candles…”
“Does he require any assistance?” Castiel was saying.
“You’re so sure this is the right thing to do,” Castiel explained, his lips ghosting across Dean’s neck. It isn’t sexual, not yet at least. It’s intimate and comfortable. “I’m never sure of anything.”
“Okay,” Dean replied. “And that something has something to do with all of Inias’ stuff?”
“Honestly?” Crowley said with a hint of humor in his voice. “I’m bored, Squirrel. You may have been a dick while you were a demon- but you were my dick.”
“Everything we need,” Dean finishes. He closes his eyes and shakes away the phrase. It’s not right. It’s not true. Except it obviously is because he’s in Heaven and he just needs to get in Baby and drive. That’s all he needs. Him and Sammy will get in the car and just drive until—
Castiel smiled and put the camera back down in the box. He saw something else that caught his eye and pulled it out.
“Okay,” Dean said quietly. “But I’m coming back in a little while. Take some time to really think about this, Alex. I know it sucks, but you’ve got to-“
“Couple’s costumes are so cute! Everyone knows Batman and Robin were knocking utility boots.”
“I’m sure you have,” Luke said wickedly. “I can assure you it’s all true.”
Castiel meets his gaze and then it flicks away again. “I… I could feel you. Seems our bond
On top of that, that day was the anniversary of his father’s death and Castiel had gone to New York to put flowers on his grave. Castiel’s mother, recently remarried and over eager to have Castiel bond with her new husband,  had scheduled them a weekend of things to do and Castiel had been extremely grateful to have Dean as a distraction.
Dean Wouldn't admit it to himself, but he was afraid of what Collette would have to say. He was terrified she would tell them there was no hope and that they should just give up trying to remove the mark.
“I know.” He paused then let out a small sigh. “Actually, I didn’t know. Not until tonight. Not for sure, at least. I think that’s what’s been holding me back from talking to you about…about this. I don’t want to lose you, Cas.”
“I mean, I know it wasn’t easy for her. Ash and I work constantly, but things are going really well. We even have a meeting in New York coming up that could make this go national.”
“I'm not lying!” Metatron gasped out, his ability to take in air constricted by Castiel’s assault. “But there is something else!”
After a minute, Castiel sat back up in his chair and sighed.
He pushed away the gory images of Alex’s parents and walked to the door. The ladder was just off to the left, far enough that if he opened the door just enough for him to slip through, it wouldn’t jostle the ladder. Dean thought about calling to Castiel and letting him know what we was about to do, but if Dean was right, he didn’t want to spook the girl.
