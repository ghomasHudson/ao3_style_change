Rumiko throws her head back, laughing heartily. “I only need to see the way he looks at you to know how he feels about you.” She inches closer and whispers, “I know how Tony and I look together, Mr. President. But you asked for a show, did you not? There’s absolutely no need for jealousy. You’re wasting your energy on something that does not even exist.”
They’ve been playing this weird sort of dance for about nine months, where sometimes Tasha comes over and they discuss business and Clint thinks that maybe that’s all they are: colleagues, friends, and then she throws him completely off-guard by leaning into him when they laugh over that time the Republicans tried to convince the Senate that pizza is in fact a vegetable. Sometimes he catches
“I understand your disbelief. I truly do, Mr. Stark. You’ve been in politics much longer than I have and probably can’t distinguish sincerity from schemes anymore. I get that. But please just stop for one second and try to get past all the politics because I want to start governing. And call me crazy but I actually think you want to do the same.”
Coulson tilts his head, a knowing smile on his lips. “Don’t play coy with us, Natasha. We know all your tells.”
A lanky Political Science student knocks on Professor Scott Lang’s door, eager to have a piece of the popular electronic engineer’s time. Under normal circumstances, it would be strange to have a student with a non-engineering major spend precious hours in this department, but this was no ordinary student—this was engineering prodigy Tony Stark, who had left Cambridge, Massachusetts in a huff to join the hippies of Palo Alto, California. He threw away the MIT engineering degree in exchange for something wildly different, effectively killing Howard Stark's legacy and shocking the burgeoning tech industry to its very core.
“Thus completely diverting our attention from the President’s budget request, which should be handed to Congress anytime today, to a bill the Republicans know will pass in the House without any of their votes,” Wade finishes. “You’ve got to admit, the plan’s not half bad.”
stole breakthrough medical technology from Fujikawa Technologies and attempted to weaponize it. We won that patent lawsuit, Obie. We won it in the district courts, we won it in the appellate courts, and if you really can’t get over it and take it to the Supreme Court, we’re going to win that too.”
She takes a look around and notices that there are more government employees in the café than usual, thanks to the shutdown. The President did make it clear that he would only negotiate with the leader of the Democratic Party, which could only mean closed door meetings with Tony, and perhaps if they’re lucky, Thor. Pepper is not exactly worried about getting what they want—Tony will see to it that they do—she’s just apprehensive about
“Call for a meeting,” Bruce proposes. “Invite the House leadership of both parties, and the Senate as well. Let’s have a civil dialogue about the budget.”
This is around 3000 words more than my usual word count because there's just so much going on. Hope you enjoy it!
Tony is caught completely off guard with that. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but closes it immediately and decides to occupy himself with his errant bots.
He looks back at the whole campaign; the past year and half that almost took his soul as payment for talking about the issues, the real ones, not just the numbers, because he knows what it feels like to be just a number among other numbers. He knows what it feels like to be data, to be statistics. He didn’t work this hard, to come so far, only to fall into the same trap that politicians before him fell into. He wanted to make sure that the numbers became more than just numbers. He wanted to make sure that the numbers are seen as what they truly are—people.
“Contraceptives,” Pepper admits almost painfully. “They said religious institutions should not be forced by law to provide free contraceptives as part of employee health plans.”
“You’re having a hard time with your tie, which means you’re worried and nervous. You haven’t slept, which means you’re unprepared. You’re wearing one of your favorite and best suits, which means this meeting is extremely important to you.” Pepper walks over to him and re-ties the knot. “You weren’t like this when I broke off our engagement. You weren’t like this when Scott died and your whole world changed
Pepper takes a moment to think about what Tony had just said. “Knowing Scott, he would have pushed you to run for President.”
“Not quite,” Clint answers. “A corruption case is being built against him. They’re keeping it quiet at the moment, but that piece of news will come out soon and he wants to get ahead of the game.”
He withdraws his hand before that thought swallows him like a tidal wave—like it has many times before—and chooses instead to focus his attention on Tony’s various inventions.
It’s Clint who breaks the silence. “How is your dad?” he asks, and it seems like he’s sounding better already.
“Thank you, Dum Dum.” Tony turns back to Rumiko. “I need you to listen very carefully to what I’m about to tell you, and I need you to trust that the information I’m about to share is enough for you to know what you’re looking for.”
Tony keeps his resolve, unfazed by the willful Wakandan prince. “But you could have called me and told me that this was happening! And now, there’s a whole mess that has your vibranium at the center of it all. You
“Says the woman whose religion only apologized for sentencing Galileo to death for scientific truth four hundred and fifty years after the fact,” Pepper snaps. She knows better than to lose her temper in front of Maria Hill—the woman is too familiar with her buttons and knows exactly when to push them—but when it comes to women’s reproductive rights, they’re clearly on both ends of the spectrum, and Pepper, for the life of her, can’t imagine why any woman, let alone someone as strong and independent as Maria Hill, would stand for such misogynistic bullshit.
Steve closes his eyes, a little hurt. But he guesses that he deserves the cold tone that’s coming from the other end of the line. He’s owed Bucky Barnes a call anyway, just not one that’s professional in nature.
When the President does arrive, Tony feels like the air is being sucked out of his lungs. Because, yes, that is a fine specimen of a human being right there, but it’s actually a little weird putting the President and Steve in the same body—they’re like two different people to him. This Steve Rogers, the one who’s brow is furrowed, who’s lips are in a thin line, and is surrounded by Secret Service, is a little distant and seems unreachable, like the pièce de résistance of a much awaited museum exhibition. The Steve he’s been talking to for the past two months is warm and approachable, always laughing and always a little silly, like a golden retriever. The dissonance is disconcerting, and to be honest, Tony doesn’t like it very much.
"Yes, but Darcy is the one who leaves bite marks where she promises she wouldn't. And I told you to stop calling me that." Kate gives Darcy a stern look, complete with a perfectly arched eyebrow. Darcy laughs and actually bops a finger on his assistant's nose.
“Why don’t you three head on up,” Tony tells Jessica, Matt, and Foggy. “We’ll just be a few minutes. I need to discuss a few things regarding Congress with my team.”
Tony hands Clint his drink. “Good to have you back, birdy. What you did back there was brilliant, by the way, if I do say so myself.”
“In all seriousness.” Fury is unsmiling and grim now. Back to business. “I can’t contain Hill, and as much as I hate to admit it, you know that as well. And you also know that if she isn’t put in her place, we all lose.”
“Congresswoman Hill is being very aggressive, even in the upper house,” Thor adds. “It has given us much grief in the negotiations. Despite his arrogance, Senator Richards is a fair lawmaker, but he has been unusually hostile these past months. I believe the honorable Congresswoman may have her hands around his neck.”
Clint sighs. He squeezes Tony’s shoulder before letting go. “Get some rest, and we’ll see you tomorrow.”
Steve tries not to blush at how transparent he is when it comes to his feelings for Tony. “Is that why he maneuvered this whole thing between us? So that you could reassure me?” he asks her seriously, yet hopefully.
He jolts out of his reverie and turns to face the door. It’s Bruce, his campaign manager, and will most likely be the White House Chief of Staff. Steve laughs softly at his usage of the new title. “I’m having a hard time getting used to being called that.”
Please keep reading, don't forget to bookmark, and leave a word or two to keep me going! Your feedback is always very much appreciated. Thanks for sticking around!
Which is why Clint can’t understand what they are exactly. There was a trip she took to New York when this all began nine months back for a party fundraiser and she had spotted him sitting at the bar after the glittery and gorgeous had left the party.
The realization dawns on him and Pepper watches it play out on his handsome face—from utter confusion to crisp cognizance to reluctant acceptance. He stares at her, eyes wide, and flumps on the edge of the bed, burying his face in his hands with a groan. “Jesus Christ, Pep, how could I have let this happen?”
Matt walks towards one of the metal tables and takes out a file from his briefcase. They all congregate around him. “Thanks to our lovely Greek friend, we have more information on Alchemax.” He opens the folder and spreads out documents and photos so that the others can see. “It’s a chemical corporation that deals mostly with plastic packaging for agricultural, health, and personal care products. Well, on paper, that is.”
“As for you two,” she says to Kate and Darcy. “Put those away and help me clean up the kitchen. Clint, please help Henry set the table. Once we’re done, we can all relax in the living room until the evening.”
“You should be talking to your AG, not us,” Clint adds firmly. “One phone call to Danvers and your problems could have been solved—how hard could it have been?”
“Is it really that bad that Thor’s brother is here? I mean, I know there’s no love lost between those two, but does he really have to call for back-up to deal with Loki?” Despite Darcy’s in-depth knowledge about the goings on in the Hill and her close relationship with Jane, neither she nor Thor have talked to Darcy about Loki in detail.
Rumiko laughs heartily as she kisses him on the cheek. “It’s faux fur. Very expensive faux fur, to be exact. But don’t worry, Tony, I’ll be sure to mention how fake it is to the reporters.”
She’s known Tony for half her life, attached to his hip as his girlfriend for five of that, yet somehow she still doesn’t completely
Clint just smiles at her, still sad, but at least Kate sees that there is a little bit of hope in his eyes. She kisses him on the cheek. “It’ll be okay, Clint.”
Anthony E. Stark, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, is not a morning person, never has been. He has never really figured out where he had inherited the habit of being a complete zombie before noon—he remembers being very active as a kid, always eager to get up in the morning to play with his new toys and explore new things, always energetic, innovative and imaginative. He guesses that it must have started during his teenage years when his dad had put him in under so much pressure as the apparent heir of Stark Industries. Those years ultimately became his downfall, or maybe even his salvation, because he realized that he did not want to end up like his father—a sad, bitter man who thought only about himself—nor end up in the shadow of the Stark name.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake!” Anne says, clearly disappointed. “I make them a wonderful chiffon cake and they give me a store-bought fruit cake? Tell me, why do we continue with this goddamn tradition?”
Steve gives him a terse nod, perhaps feeling the same way Tony does about being too familiar with each other. “Good evening, Mr. Speaker. Shall we?”
“Thanks.” Darcy takes a sip. “If I had Tony Stark’s mind and even just half of his problems, I wouldn’t be able to sleep either. Most especially at a time like this.”
Natasha Romanoff has no strategy for this one. I don’t know if I’m more scared for your party or disappointed at you.”
“Well, Pepper wasn't surprised. Neither was Natasha. Clint, Thor and Janet that needed a little bit more…explanation. Other than that, it went as well as one could hope,” he describes.
This whole experience with Tony and Cassie is a revelation to Steve. Family has always been at the front of center of his life, and with his two-tour stint in the US Army, brotherhood is not far from that tree either. But what Tony has shown him through the way he works and interacts with his team, and most especially through his relationship with Cassie, is something new—a family that, without legal, biological, or political inducements, chose to become a family. They continue choose to be loyal to each other and love each other every single day. Steve doesn’t think there could be anything more beautiful and honorable than that.
“These are extenuating circumstances,” Steve tells him, unperturbed. “I would much rather you call me Steve.”
Tony smiles deviously at the television screen. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and that’s one thing he can cook up locked in a cave for three months with nothing but scraps of metal and a car battery stuck to his chest.
He doesn’t respond immediately, but rather opens a can of beer and hands it to her. Kate accepts it gladly and takes a big gulp. “Tony asked you to check up on me?” Clint asks her after about a minute of silence.
The meeting with Justice Pierce was, to put it mildly, unsettling. They had discussed his early retirement, but Pierce had out-talked him in every turn, preventing Steve from getting the real story out of the associate justice. Or at least what Steve
Peter clears his throat. “Yeah, this afternoon. She asked for a meeting to hash out the messaging for the state dinner.”
They start to approach five black unmarked SUVs, and as soon as they reach the hood of the first car in the lineup, the doors of the second, third, and fourth ones open at the same time, as if on command. Secret Service agents come pouring out of the cars. Two men come out last, and they’re who Clint and Natasha are there for—the Vice President and the GOP Chair.
He walks towards her, careful not to disturb the peace her presence is commanding in the room, because when was the last time there was true, genuine peace in this house? Not since she left, and probably never again. He wraps his arms around her waist, holds her tight. There is no indication of surprise from her end, as if she expected Tony to come to her, and that makes him a little warm inside. He rests his chin on her left shoulder and takes a deep breath, inhaling that wonderful strawberry-vanilla scent of her hair.
“Whatever, you’re going to let me out early, we both know that. I’m just saving you some extra effort. Anyway, I’ll be seeing you at the thing later.” Clint’s other eyebrow joins his first.
Tony takes a few seconds to search Steve’s face for a flicker of…anything really, that could tell him that this isn’t the end of the line for them. When all he sees is an impassive expression, he resigns to the situation and accepts the President’s hand. “It was my pleasure, Mr. President. I do hope we continue working together on important issues.”
There’s a spread of sweets, pastries and drinks laid out in Steve’s sitting room, and Cassie practically flies towards the chocolates. “Oooh, heaven is a place on earth,” she sings as she takes a piece of Turkish Delight from the tray. She spots Tony, comfortably seated on one of the couches, scanning his phone. “Don’t you want anything?”
Tony laughs heartily. “Oh, Jesus, no.” He continues to laugh like he’d just been told the greatest joke in the world. “Where did you get the idea that I wanted to become President?” He wipes actual tears from his eyes. “Good lord, that was really funny. Oh, boy. Wow.”
Steve smacks his hand playfully. “I also thought that maybe we could frame it as a bipartisan thing. The press already talk about our really strong partnership on legislative issues, and I think it could be the perfect time to exploit that. I had someone check with the Protocol office too, and they said they’re perfectly fine with it.”
Before Steve can respond, however, Tony interjects, perhaps sensing how distracted he is. “I think President Rogers has left most of himself in the Situation Room,” Tony jokes, eliciting a laugh from the table. “Mrs. Eliodoro was just wondering when the dancing would start—if there would be any dancing at all.”
The door opens and Clint steps inside, but not without flicking a finger to the security camera. Not the one set up by the corner, which is a decoy, but the one on the peephole.
“Clint,” she says finally after cleaning up. Her expression is severe, and Clint looks as though he is bracing himself for chastising. She softens at his reaction, reminding herself that he’s having a tougher time than anyone else at the moment. “I know things are crazy but you can’t just let go like this. This isn’t the way to live.” She takes a seat beside him. “You have to start taking care of yourself.”
she thinks. Whenever he’s disquieted, Tony Stark hauls himself in his basement workshop and gets lost in his machines and programs, a temporary respite from the insanity of American politics. Even when he dropped out of MIT during his second year and transferred to Stanford, he never really left engineering and robots. It’s his home, Kate thinks. Whatever he does, wherever he goes, he will always go back to his machines.
Bruce noticed earlier that morning that even Steve is anxious, and that’s a first for them. His back is straight and his stance rigid, the President’s military training obvious to anyone at sight. Honestly, Bruce is not surprised. Tony Stark is infamous for his tactics, and no one, not even the Democratic Party, really knows what to expect of him in times like these. One thing Bruce and the rest of the Republicans are sure about is that Stark’s camp will pull out all the stops to come out victorious.
So this took a while! Sorry 'bout that. But I promised you some nice things, so here are the nice things :D
“A good morning indeed,” Natasha replies with a glint in her eye. She turns to the waiter. “I’ll have my usual. But open a bottle of your finest champagne and give us a pitcher of fresh orange juice. We’re celebrating.”
He doesn't tell Tony and Cassie that he'd already been seeing stars the moment he stepped foot in the house.
Steve bows his head, trying not to erupt in laughter. “Did anyone ever try to make the two of you into a reality TV show?”
This has certainly been one of the most enjoyable chapters to write. I had been wanting to write this particular chapter for so long, it was a great experience putting my imagination into words, especially the latter half. It's about a thousand words more than my usual chapter length—that's how much I loved writing this.
“Please extend my compliments to your President, Mr. Speaker, on a superb dinner. I’m sure the President of Italy is pleased at this warm reception.”
“That’s great, Tony. Makes it easier for the team, especially for the assistants.” Darcy starts to stir and stretch to consciousness, the folder on her stomach falling to the ground to join the rest of its contents. Kate starts the coffee. “And have you been thinking about your real world job at all?”
It could have gone worse, but he’s okay with how the conversation went. They can’t really go back to how things were—there’s too much history there—but there’s hope. They can be friends as well as colleagues, and Steve is looking forward to that possibility.
Steve does step aside, amused and frankly, getting a little whiplash from the sudden change in Tony’s demeanor. But he adjusts almost immediately. “Alright then, you’re the chef for today.”
“What is it about you, Obie, that you just can’t take a hint? You don’t faze me, and you certainly don’t scare me.” She gives him a hard, steely look, absolutely unwilling to back down.
“A communicator. I’m wearing one as well.” Tony shows her the same device affixed on his lower auricle, invisible to anyone not looking for it. “Everyone on the team will be wearing one, so we can keep in touch throughout the night. The system is integrated with my personal AI—it’s intuitive and will know when to mute.”
He’s startled by her genuine praise—something that doesn’t come often from ordinary citizens in his line of work. “That’s—“ Clint swallows, his throat betraying him. “I really appreciate that, Anne, truly.”
“That wasn’t the impression that I got yesterday,” Tony answers rather honestly, defenses now starting to come up. As much as Steve sounds genuine, he doesn’t like this sudden return to their rapport.
There’s a mischievous smile playing on Natasha’s lips. “It will be a little difficult to believe this, but I actually trust Stark. I don’t need to control him,” she tells Fury humorlessly. “He may be insane and over the top, but he gets the job done. And he’s entertaining to watch.”
Thor raises a hand. “Have you unearthed anything about this Alchemax? Or Advanced Idea Mechanics for that matter?”
Pepper answers Happy’s question with a dry laugh. “Not after the one last June, and I’m pretty sure never again. At least, not with the House Republicans in the same room.”
“It’s her mother.” Tony sighs. “Cassie, please, just talk to her. You completely ditched her to spend Thanksgiving with me. Just talk to her and then you can ignore her for another six months.”
“Not in so many words, no. But Tony and I have known each other all our lives. He is one of my greatest, most loyal friends. I know his heart and his mind well. I can tell when something constantly occupies both.”
She waves him off, other hand expertly preparing the turkey stuffing. “Please, Senator Barton, you’re our guest. This is the least I could do after all that you’ve done for our daughter.”
America throws her head back and laughs. “Ah, so you’re the righteous ones. You do know you sound kind of pretentious when you say that?”
Anne slides the fifteen-pound turkey into the oven like a pro, takes off the oven mitts and wipes her hands on the dish cloth on top of the counter. She then heads over to Clint and pats his cheek in a knowing, motherly manner. “You didn’t answer my question, dear. But I’ll let it pass.” She pauses and gives him an amused smile. “You and Darcy are certainly two peas in a pod.”
A pause. Tony takes a deep breath. “So… Are we good? Like, finally good? No more outbursts? No more take-backs?”
Kate shrugs. “I guess I just want to hear it from someone else. It’s just… I’ve been working for him for so long that sometimes I think I don’t know if he’s still being logical about things.”
Her eyes light up in surprise. “Dum Dum, how wonderful to see you! Isn’t being Tony’s chauffeur way below your paygrade, hm?”
The beautiful, terrible smile lights up the whole bar and doesn’t go away. “And I’m going to let him.”
The deadline looms ahead, and naturally, both parties fear a government shutdown. But neither are willing to extend a hand of compromise publically and be labeled weak—Tony refuses to give in to the minority, and Maria Hill refuses to, according to her, “give up her principles to the liberal devils.” The President and his staff continue to scramble for some semblance of cooperation within the GOP whilst writing a fair and balanced budget, but they have very little luck. Hence, the calls keep coming, and Tony and Steve keep trying at this bipartisan thing. To their pleasant surprise, it seems as though they get along pretty well, except for the occasional shouting matches over the phone. But Steve is a Republican and Tony is a Democrat—those things are bound to happen at some point.
“No, Tony. None of that Mr. President business. I’m just Steve, and you’re just Tony. We’re just two Americans trying to do what’s best for their country.”
The living room is large, although a couple of sofas do take up the space. The main attraction, however, is a competition between the massive LED television screen and the bar area. The television is off while the bar area has its spotlights on, casting a warm glow, beckoning Clint towards it. Tony is already there, behind the counter, running his hands through the bottles before settling on one that hasn't been opened yet. The room is one of Tony's special occasion rooms; these are rooms that Tony uses only when he has people coming over, a sort of stage for him to engage with everyone. The living room, in particular, is usually set out for the strategy sessions like these, small celebrations and for particular nights when Clint gets calls from him at two in the morning to indulge in a glass or two.
Thor’s back is hunched, hands gripping tightly, almost angrily, on the backrest of the chair in front of him. He’s trying hard to tune out the nervous, high-strung voices outside his room, because he can hardly think straight with all this commotion. One of the ten television screens is flashing red and blue on his face but he’s not paying any attention to it. He’s thinking about numbers. He finds it funny how numbers can mean so much in this country—how much, how many, too much, too little—and on a day like this, it’s the only thing that matters. But tomorrow those numbers will still be numbers, and sooner or later they will disappear into a sea of even more numbers, forgotten until someone digs them up again and remembers the how and the why. It’s funny yet disappointing how the issues can become just numbers, only to be abandoned and replaced by new numbers, until the issues themselves drown in the ocean of It Hardly Matters Anymore.
Kate steps out, checking the tablet and informs Tony that he's supposed to meet with the Black Caucus in fifteen minutes. He has to suppress the groan that desperately wants to escape because it may be past breakfast time already but this still falls under Too Early For This Shit in Tony’s opinion. “Fine, fine, okay. Also, can you place a call for me to Barton? I need to talk to him about the Women’s Health Act—“
She sighs. “What were you up to?” Kate asks as a concession of defeat. She won’t go anywhere if she argues his sleeping habits further.
Clint turns to Natasha, and she catches the hint of uneasiness that passes quickly across his face. His expression does not last for more than a split second, but she knows him well enough to spot his tells. “Tony isn’t prepared for this,” he whispers to the team. “We haven’t even begun to imagine where the DOD angle could lead us, let alone think about the potential involvement of influential military contractors.”
“Well, let’s see. One, you convinced Columbia University to offer her younger sister an archery scholarship so she can freely choose a major without fearing daddy and his threats of holding back his moolah if she chose against his wishes. Two, you put all these dreams of social justice and serving the country into her younger sister’s head, which distanced her from her selfish, elitist, staunchly Republican family. And finally three, you convinced her younger sister to move all the way to California to work for the politician their daddy dislikes the most.” She shrugs and pretends to be dumb. “So yeah, I think she still hates you.”
“Smuggling, mostly,” Foggy continues. “They disguise illegal goods and/or highly controlled substances with their packaging.”
Natasha chuckles. “Well, for one thing, he’s still acting like the Tony Stark we know and tolerate.”
“Oh please,” she chastises him playfully. The clock in the kitchen reads almost five-thirty—back to business
She laughs and it sends a chill down his spine. He has always loved Pepper’s laugh. “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to quit each other, Tony.” She leans against the kitchen counter, crosses her arms. “But that doesn’t mean that this...whatever we had, will work again.”
“You and I both,” Steve says with a smile. “Unfortunately, the shutdown also affects the White House kitchen staff, so we’ll have to make our own lunch in the residence.”
“Today, indictments were unsealed charging Alexander Pierce, former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, for his alleged involvement in the unlawful release and subsequent disappearance of evidence pertinent to an Ohio smuggling case.
Pepper and Janet look at each other in confusion, but then a wave of realization sweeps across their faces. “The budget request,” Janet says.
He can already hear Tony Stark’s voice echoing through the hallway as they make their way to the Roosevelt Room. It should annoy him, really, that the Democrats think they own whatever place they’re in, but it actually amuses and fascinates him how Stark can command an entire room with just a simple smile, yet Maria Hill has to incite fear and animosity to garner attention.
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
That was when Thor started believing in destiny. He went to Culver to woo a plucky young woman who wasn’t afraid to stand up to big people. He came out of what was a haughty man’s folly as a new man with an authentic calling to serve, and a companion who truly believed in him.
He doesn’t know if he’s ineffective as the President and as the de facto leader of the Republican Party, or if he’s being played by the other powers that be of the party he has served with his everything for the past eleven years. Either way, it’s bad news for his administration and the American people.
“Religious institutions, especially hospitals and universities, should not be required by law to provide contraceptives, which are clearly against their faiths, as part of employee health plans,” Maria says forcefully.
Two days ago, Tony had told him to keep his eyes and ears open for anything unusual happening on his side of the capital. He had believed the Speaker of the House, of course—after everything they’d been through with the shutdown, how could he not? There was no reason not to continue trusting the man. So he took note of Tony’s advice, but he didn’t think he’d actually need it so soon, because after having his first—and only—caffeine intake of the day, his chief of staff came into the Oval Office with the most unusual and shocking of news.
“This is dangerous,” Jessica cautions. “If we’re being watched, then sure as hell all eyes will be on all of you during that dinner.”
Tony tilts his head, not quite understanding what Carol means, but goes along with it anyway. He’s certain the namedrop will come in handy sooner rather than later. He returns the smile. “Sure thing, Madam Attorney General.”
He doesn’t regret it, of course not. He would never regret it. It was, first and foremost, an honor to serve the American people as their soldier and alongside his uncle, and it is an even bigger honor to serve them as their President. He can’t think of any other way growing up than helping people, serving them, and he would never trade the life he’s had for anything.
Tony sighs, resigned to his fate. “Confirm the meeting with the President tomorrow, and tell Natasha I’m on my way to her office.”
“As a last resort, Tones,” Clint tells him straightaway. “He can’t be involved in all this until it’s absolutely necessary and we have exhausted all avenues.”
Steve grins like a child who just got what he wanted, and then turns on his serious mode. Fun time is over that quickly, apparently. “Before we begin I just want to thank you for taking this road with me. I know putting your trust in someone you don’t know couldn’t have been easy, but when I saw your small press conference earlier, I knew I had made the right call in putting my trust in you.”
Clint rubs his hands before picking up his cup. “I wish. It was in the middle of freaking nowhere. I think letting us die of hypothermia was part of their plan.”
“Futurist,” she finishes with a shake of her head. “I know. Christ, if I had a dollar for every time you said that…”
Supreme Court staff. Of course, these were all just rumors, so I texted Clint what I had heard immediately,” Darcy explains.
Steve waits until they’re inside the library and out of earshot to ask, “Her mother left her and her father as a child, right?”
She goes for it. “It’s no secret that you’ve been sleeping together, but something’s changed. We hardly ever see Clint outside of the Hill anymore.” Pepper sighs, looks at Natasha as if to appeal a case. “I don’t know what’s going on between the two of you, but I just want you to know that I’m here for you if ever you need someone to talk to.”
watching), but it seemed distasteful, seeing as he was in cahoots with the President and was on his way to meet with him about the budget. So he turned his asshole down a notch. He will, however, hear from Natasha soon—he knows her well enough to know that his little show at front steps of the White House would have given him away. Natasha is just that good, and also that fucking terrifying.
Darcy clears her throat, waits a few moments before speaking to build suspense—something she usually does that the others hate, but Clint can’t help but encourage her. It’s entertaining. “We know who’s stepping down from the Supreme Court.”
Pepper nods. “Alright. I’ll talk to Janet as well. The boys are a little too loyal to him, so I’ll leave them out of the loop for now.”
with some goodies and easter eggs. Drop by and say hi, and take some time to write a comment or two here as well. They keep me going :)
Natasha gets up without a word, clearly disappointed at Tony despite the lack of emotions on her face. Clint follows suit, but at little more sympathetic towards his friend. He puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder and says, “You know she’s worried, Tones. She looks to you to do the right thing because—“
Once the three are clear of the workshop, Tony takes a deep breath and faces his colleagues with a bright, yet slightly nervous smile. “So,” he says nervously. “This might not be the right time to tell you that I’m kind of dating Steve Rogers.”
"That was one time, sweetie. And don't tell me it wasn't worth having Senator Logan lose his bet with Wade."
“As President of the United States, I unfortunately can’t ignore the highest ranking member of the rival party,” Steve says with a grin. “But it’s Thanksgiving, so maybe we should stop teasing your godfather.”
So. I'd like to apologize for the glacial pace. I have been drowning in work for the past few months, and just couldn't find the time to write anything other than my work submissions. Again, this story has not yet been abandoned. It's just going really, really slowly.
Foggy points to the photo in the center of the pile. “Allan is the President and CEO of Alchemax, but he also sits on the on AIM’s board.”
Nick Fury is a very serious man. After all, one has to be in order to survive being in American politics. He calls people out on their crap, tells it like it is, and is always upfront and honest about the bullshit his party involves itself in. He’s been a Republican for all of his life, but he hasn’t been in his seat for long—Natasha Romanoff has been carrying the mantle for the Democrats far longer than he has held the GOP chairmanship—but he has lived and breathed politics longer than he can dare remember, even longer than Romanoff has been alive. He remembers every idiotic move and decision his party has made throughout the years, and has sold his soul to whatever devil is out there to right every wrong. His candor has never been welcome in his party, but miracle of miracles, he was elected to be the chair, and he swore on his life to bring back the GOP glory days—the days where Republican politics wasn’t about attacking gays and women, lying, bullying, and just being plain idiotic.
“I know him, unfortunately,” Pepper adds, the displeasure clear in her voice. “He owned a small research company that was bought by Oscorp a year or so ago for a
Darcy eagerly looks at Clint, as if to ask for permission. He nods once, and Darcy turns to the team again. “It’s Alexander Pierce.”
The party dies a little bit after midnight, and thankfully everyone who came had the decency to keep his house relatively clean—there was not much tidying up to be done by the time the last person had said their goodbyes. Kate bids Tony adieu after the last garbage bag is deposited in the trash bins outside the house, and Tony takes a very quick and very hot shower before flopping onto his bed out of sheer exhaustion.
“We’re running out of time,” Natasha states. “We need to find an avenue where we can hit two or more birds with one stone before interested parties realize how far we are.”
The restaurant suddenly goes still, and Pepper knows that Natasha has just walked through the doors. It’s amazing how much fear she can instill in a room full of people who wield so much power. Pepper has her own stride, but Natasha is in a league all on her own. Thank heavens they’re on the same side. Fighting against her would be like pushing against a concrete wall—very nearly impossible.
Tony doesn’t answer immediately, and Steve feels as though he might have hurt him. “I thought you said you’d trust me, Steve.”
When Tony gets the call from the White House Chief of Staff’s office later that morning to relay the President’s request for a meeting on the budget, he stops whatever he’s doing and actually throws his hands up in the air, sending papers flying around the foyer of his office, much to Kate’s chagrin.
“Noted, but don’t bank on it,” she says. “Now shoo, before Clint starts looking lost. You know how grumpy he is first thing in the morning.”
Tony closes his eyes and mentally prepares himself for the conversation he's about to have. “I'm going to the state dinner for the Italian Prime Minister next week,” he starts, slow and deliberate.
Pepper takes his hands into hers. “Hey, look at me,” she requests gently. “We’re great friends and an even greater team.”
He returns to the nearly empty ballroom, save for the White House staff cleaning up, and finds Rumiko alone by their table. “You okay?” he asks her gently.
“Hi,” he responds meekly, smiling through his nerves. His heart is beating fast and he’s sweating through his very expensive suit.
“Thanks,” he tells her as Kate takes off his coat. “Hold all my calls for the next half hour.” He hands her his briefcase and heads toward the conference room at the other end of the Speaker’s office.
Steve doesn’t let her finish. It’s clear that he is eager to move on. “I fully agree with the Speaker of the House.” He turns to Tony, his expression softer. “Are you up for this?” His tone is light and a little too personal for a meeting in the Roosevelt room.
Thor jumped right in, just as his father was about to open his mouth. “And what would you have the company do, Miss Foster?” The whole auditorium then turned to look at him. He buttoned his suit jacket and put on a dazzling smile. “Thor Odinson. Pleasure to meet you.”
“I know that’s not who you are,” Natasha replies softly. “And I never took your...feelings against you, Clint.”
For his sanity, he tries, for the rest of the day, not to think of Tony and what might be going on inside the Speaker of the House’s head.
Kate smiles back, wide and gleaming, and throws a kitchen towel at her girlfriend. “Idiot. Go take a shower.” Darcy laughs as she exits the kitchen, Kate shaking her head while preparing to cook breakfast for the two of them.
T’Challa shakes his head. “No. You and I both know that we cannot be seen coming into each other’s spaces, Tony. Not when we are being watched.”
Bruce chuckles and walks in. “I don’t think you have a choice, sir. The American people have spoken.”
He tries to make the situation lighter, more work related. “And in the spirit of friendship, listen,” Tony begins, his tone shifting to a more professional one. “Something’s brewing. We’re trying to figure out exactly what it is, but until then, keep your eyes and ears open for anything out of the ordinary.”
Silence falls as they regard one another—Sharon full of understanding and kindness, Steve overflowing with relief and gratefulness. It’s a load off of Steve’s chest, and it feels like he has finally jumped over the final hurdle. Sharon must know this, must recognize how important this conversation is to him, because her eyes show nothing but tenderness.
“I’m not going to beat around the bush,” Tony says as he leans on the backrest of his chair. “Would you mind telling me what’s going on with Alexander Pierce?”
Steve puts his phone aside and buries his face into his hands. He knew going in that being the President of the United States was a mammoth of a job, but he underestimated the effort that he had to put into running a country. Steve has always been a hard worker, and he had always put his 100% into everything he ever had to do, but this job required everything of him, and more. He has always been more than willing to sacrifice himself for his country—he was in the Army after all—but he didn’t know that he had to sacrifice other people, too.
“I’m so sorry, it’s been a whirlwind of a night,” he tries to explain. There’s no response from the other line. He tries again. “It was Kate’s fault?”
Darcy’s face stiffens. “I told him not to fall in love with Natasha Romanoff, and that’s exactly what he does. He’s been moping around the Senate these past couple of months like a lovesick puppy. It can get pretty annoying.” She shakes her head. “Men. They never know what’s good for them.”
“Thanks for coming at such short notice, Bruce,” Steve tells his Chief of Staff, gratitude clear in his tone.
Tony stutters, blushing a little bit. “Y—yeah. I think I’m going to stay here for a bit and head back before sunrise, if that’s alright? But please make yourself at home. JARVIS will make sure you have everything you need, and I’m certain Cassie won’t mind if you borrow some clothes from her for the night. You’ll wake up to a friendly face when you come down for breakfast in the morning. It’ll be warmer and homier than a hotel room, for sure.”
Tony rubs his temples and sighs. It’s obvious that he’s very tired. “Look, you’ve made your point and I’m exhausted. Can we pick this up tomorrow when we’ve had a couple of hours sleep in us? Please?”
“Don’t worry, I did a sweep this morning. We’re fine in here,” Tony reassures her. “Anyway, Natasha’s orders, so we’re taking extra precautions or else we die a most excruciating death.”
“Only when you formally accept his resignation, which is being drafted right now and will be ready for your signature within the day. We will send both letters to the Senate as soon as you sign.”
“More questions than answers, though,” Natasha says after staying silent for most of the discussion. “And a new piece of the puzzle: Oscorp. Jessica, does Pierce have any known associates?”
Bruce rests an assuring hand on the President-elect’s tense shoulder. “You’ve done a magnificent thing. You’ve inspired crowds, had them chant your name with loud voice, and lifted them off their feet. You won the presidency against all odds. The road ahead will be long and difficult, but I’ll bet my life that Peggy will be with you every step of the way. And if she could, she’d be kicking your ass right now for thinking all these pessimistic thoughts.”
she thinks, and shifts to sweetheart mode as she lets out an airy laugh. “Now you’re just flattering me, Mr. Killian.”
Tony looks at him sternly, all the pleasantries from their earlier exchange gone. “You had stolen vibranium running around Ohio and New York, and now we don’t know where it is. All you had to do was pick up the phone. We could have helped you. Why the hell didn’t you call me, T’Challa?”
“Bye, honey!” Tony bids his ever-loyal (because he made it so) artificial intelligence, JARVIS, farewell. He adds flavor to the goodbye by throwing air kisses into the empty hallway. He closes the door and turns to face Dugan. Tony breaks into a big smile and opens his arms wide in a gracious welcome. “Dum-Dum!”
The FBI agent looks at the expectant faces of this mismatched team, and sighs in resignation. “She’s the Jane Doe in the Harry Osborn case.”
“Why not? You obviously have good intentions for this country. You’re brilliant at what you do and the way you are able to command an audience is just sheer talent. I’d be scared out of my mind if I were to run against you in the next elections,” Steve tells him honestly.
“Well, given that you’ve graced us with your presence tonight, especially since you invited Kanye West, I’m sure that part’s been taken care of,” Clint had replied. This was usually how the banter started. They would be apart for weeks at a time, and usually without contact beyond work-related emails, but whenever they got a chance to, for some inexplicable reason, Natasha would come to him, and she would spend the night. Clint never asked, never tried push at the boundaries of whatever undefined thing they had because he knew that she wouldn’t let him in, not really.
It takes Tony a few moments before he musters up the courage and the words to finally answer: “Yes, I do.”
It took him an entire semester to get the hang of graduate school. Thor had to do a lot of introspection that first year—he changed his attitude about certain things, did his best not to be arrogant, and started really listening to the people around him. It did him well, because by the end of his two-year program, he had fallen in love with public policy and decided to work in the public sector after finishing his degree, much to his father’s forceful and vocal disapproval.
“Seems like you’ve been looking in the wrong place,” Darcy replies, and turns to Clint, as if passing the torch of explaining things to him.
just my…associate, I would say. I’m a bachelor, I don’t have a First Lady, and I could technically go stag but I really want you with there with me.”
Now he sits in a private room where they have placed Jane, his hands above hers. Frigga is outside the room discussing Jane’s accommodations with the nurses, leaving Thor to the torment of his own thoughts.
“Wow,” Scott says, still in disbelief. “I mean, we’ve known about this for a while, but to have it laid out on paper like this…”
He can practically feel her rolling her eyes. “Shut up, Stark.” There’s an affectionate tone to her voice, so he knows he’s off the hook for now. “Congratulations on the win—76 percent of the vote. That’s something to be proud of.”
“I also apologize if we’ve given you a rough time these past few months,” he tells Steve. “Things changed after you were elected. We…became something else.”
The next room Tony takes him to is the library. It’s not as big as the living room, but for some reason, it’s even more impressive. The walls are lined with rows and rows of books, with pieces of scientific trinkets here and there as decorative elements. The earth-tone sofas and armchairs look extremely comfortable, clearly chosen and placed in such a way that you would lose track of time reading the thousands of books on the dark, wooden shelves. Steve is dazzled.
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
He misses Peggy more than anything, but he doesn’t let his mind and heart dwell on that for more than a second.
“Then there’s your answer,” he reassures her. “Sometimes Tony sees things that we mere mortals can’t see. Geniuses tend to have that skill. So trust your boss. God knows everyone else in this crazy party does.”
The last time I looked, kowtowing to Democrats isn’t governing, Fury. Or has your boy forgotten that he belongs in my party?”
Sam Wilson shakes her hand. “Miss Romanoff, lovely to see you. I trust you know my fellow civil servants from the State Department.”
Tony opens his mouth to respond, but a phone rings before he can even get a word out. Cassie holds up hers to let them know. “It’s school-related. Is it okay if I take this in the kitchen? My laptop’s there.”
“I believe you once had me play Journey’s greatest hits on loop, sir. Would you like me to pick a song at random?”
“Since we are on the topic of our fearless leader, what’s the situation on your end, Rumiko?” Thor asks, cutting the chatter.
fair,” Pepper says with a malicious smile. “Especially since your contract ends in two years and congressional hearings for an extension start in the new year when Congress comes back in session. Remind me, who controls the House again?”
Everyone snaps at attention. Even Wade, who was already dozing off on the couch, is now up and alert. Thor looks like he’s ready to hit something with a hammer, and the only thing between him and total destruction is Jane’s steadying grip on his forearm.
She can feel him smile and shake his head at the other end of the line. “Stark, that’s the best you’re going to get out of her at this point.”
She grins. “Really great. I mean, it’s not a walk in the park but I’m enjoying it a lot, and it’s a really good batch of students—great lab partners, study buddies, and all that.”
They all stare at Tony and his team when they walk the halls of the White House and make their way to the Roosevelt room for this do-or-die meeting. Whenever they do this walk of fame (or shame, depending on which side you’re on) amongst Republicans, they have only one rule: act as if they own the place. They know it gets into the Republicans’ heads. They did this when they had the meeting last June, and they’re doing it again today—Tony strutting, Wade making crude jokes, Pepper raising her eyebrow at everybody and looking like she owns the place, Clint and Thor acting like frat boys, and Janet flirting with Hank Pym. He’s got Clint and Wade as additional back-up this time because, well, he needs cooler heads to prevail later in case things go south for him.
Pepper finally spots him and begins to make her way towards the terrace doorway. “I’ll be on the first flight out tomorrow, so I’ll see you on the Hill,” he informs Natasha.
“Not if the appellate judge is in Osborn’s pocket and Allan isn’t too hot about moving the case forward,” Natasha tells them dispassionately.
He doesn’t miss his family, not by a long shot, but watching Henry and Anne Lewis these past two days fret about the whole house to give their guests a Thanksgiving dinner deserving of royalty makes him ache for the kind of familial support system he never had growing up.
“Devoured? Defiled? Worshipped?” Tony traces Steve’s jaw with feather-light kisses. Steve doesn’t respond. “Use your words, Rogers. I can’t read your mind.”
“Don’t get me wrong, sir, I’m not complaining. I’m just a little worried that you didn’t trust me enough to tell me that this was going on,” Bruce admits to him, his tone that of an intellectual assessment rather than an interrogation. There is no hint of hurt in his voice.
Kate smacks him hard on the upper arm. “I’m serious,” she says, and it shows on her face. Tony’s revelation caught her off-guard—she is clearly not in a joking mood.
The door swings open and Tony barges in, smoothly evading a bodily collision with the professor. “A good morning to you,” Scott greets him.
Clint takes this as his cue and slides in right beside her, gently taking her arm to lock it into his. “Present and voting,” he responds softly, kissing her cheek. “You look amazing—and deadly. Amazingly deadly.”
Natasha takes note of that and turns her attention back to Darcy and Clint. “Who gave you all this information?”
“You and the rest of us, sir,” Bruce sympathizes. “More than half the staff’s crashed already, I think.”
in her voice that makes Tony both love and her and want to shake her. Yup, really too early in the morning for anything.
And Steve will admit to himself that he wants Tony to trust him enough—beyond the professional trust they’ve given one another—to let him in. Despite both of them being on the opposite sides of the aisle, this whole mess with the budget is proof enough that they can work really well together, and in effect do great things for this country and its people.
“The FBI’s been pulled in to follow the money trail of both companies,” Jessica adds. “I’ll let you know if the White-Collar Crime division has made some headway on this.”
“But naming and shaming is something you do constantly. You never hesitate to call out names whenever its time to play the blame game. So thank you for sparing her.”
“They gave me a name,” he tells her as he reaches in to his jacket pocket and hands her the napkin that Carol had given him.
“Research, mostly. Biological, chemical, technological—you name it. Companies hire them for R&D,” Foggy answers.
“Are we done with Alchemax for tonight, or is there anything else you guys would like to discuss?” Matt asks the group.
She doesn’t say anything about it, only smiles and gives him a hug. He is forgiven. “What’s next?” she asks, previous apprehensions set aside. She trusts Tony completely, and she has to have faith in him in order to get the job done, even when he does things that she personally would not do in a given situation.
It’s almost 11 o’clock. He should be heading back to the residence. There’s still light coming from his secretaries’ office, the one adjacent to the Oval. He sighs. He’d told his staff to go home hours ago. He’s not kidding himself—he knows they’re more tired and even more on the edge than he is. He knows his whole White House is exhausted, and it hasn’t even been a year, but they’re all almost drained of energy.
, bitches!” he hears Kate yell to the rest of his staff. He hears some whoops and catcalls and he can’t help but smile. Kate has always been the perfect image of enthusiasm and bloodlust wrapped in a pretty and very competent package. The same is true for all the others who work in the office of the Speaker of the House.
“Well if you do figure it out while I’m still president, let me know so I can get the DOE right on it.”
“What ‘this’ are you talking about, Clint?” Natasha scoffs, offers up a fond smile over her shoulder as she locks her earring in place.
The ride to the White House is quiet, with only Tony’s tapping for ambient music. Cassie slaps his knee in irritation. “Could you stop that? You’re annoying the hell out of me.”
“Don’t look at me, I was more than happy to have you at home and studying in Georgetown,” he replies with a shrug.
They are at the back of the room in a discreet, hole-in-the-wall restaurant, away from curious and prying eyes and ears. They even dressed appropriately for the meet. Natasha in a-size-too-big sweatpants and a loose sweater, no makeup, hair in a messy bun and sunglasses as an extra shield—no one would ever recognize her as the prim, dangerous, and impeccably dressed DNC National Chair. And Fury, in a beanie and dark gray hoodie, hides easily in plain sight. This restaurant isn’t even on the radar of the who’s who in Washington, which makes it the perfect spot for clandestine meetings. Still, it doesn’t hurt to be careful, especially now that the Capitol is in danger of blowing up over the budget.
Tony’s apprehension abruptly makes the air around the two uneasy and tentative. He wonders if this is all going south, if Natasha’s strategy still has any mettle at this point, even if the meeting had just begun.
“You don’t need to remind me, I’m already on an election high. Wish I had been in the room with Maria Hill when the news outlets announced it. Her face would have been priceless,” Tony tells her, vengeful satisfaction evident in his every word.
“It’s show time, everyone,” Tony says right as the band starts to play to announce the entrance of the President and his guests. “Break a leg.”
I've had this chapter lying around for months, begging to be finished. To say that the results of the US elections have devastated me is an understatement of epic proportions. So I decided to transform my despair into writing fodder. Finally, after more than a year, here's another chapter. I hope the next one doesn't take as long.
Cassie rolls her eyes. “Yeah, as opposed to the seven other former presidents who went to Harvard. Not to mention various Nobel Prize winners, Pulitzer Prize winners, Oscar winners… Should I keep going?”
“This is where Matt and I come in,” Foggy answers, visibly more excited at this part of the narrative. “About a year ago, we started hearing about vibranium being sold for a fortune in Hell’s Kitchen. When it was clear that the rumors were very real, everyone wanted a piece of the pie—it caused a lot of chaos on the streets. The DOJ got involved when the Wakandan embassy started asking questions about vibranium that they didn’t known had left their borders.”
It’s a ringing phone that wakes Pepper up. She glances at the clock on her nightstand and it reads a quarter past six, not an unusual time for the congresswoman to be awake, but the phone call isn’t for her, it’s for her fiancé. That certainly shocks her system into full consciousness—it’s not everyday that Happy gets a call so early in the morning, so it’s definitely a surprise for her.
He carried the role of dutiful heir with ease, following orders and making the decisions that were expected of him. He went to Georgetown because that’s where Uncle Michael went. He enlisted in the army because Uncle Michael was one of the Senate’s staunchest supporters of veterans. Not once did he say no to his uncle, not once did he offer his opinion on his uncle’s plans for him. He said yes not because he was blindly walking along the path that had been laid out for him, but because it was a path that allowed him to use his privilege to help a lot of people.
Tony’s face breaks into slight alarm, as if the idea of anyone willing to do anything for him scares the shit out of him. “You know I’m never going to ask you to do that.” His voice is small, somber, almost depressed.
“Someone cover me,” he tells his team. “I don’t want anyone interrupting us while I’m talking to him.”
“Why do you think so, Mr. President?” Rumiko asks, startling Steve and breaking him from his internal brooding.
“Oh! Yes, of course, have a seat,” Steve replies quickly. “I apologize,” he says as they take their seats in front of each other. “This is all just a little weird. I’m used to talking to you on the phone, and now you’re here. It’s a little disconcerting.”
Tony rolls his eyes. There are just some times when his assistant is too excited to function. “Now go ahead and do your job before I change my mind about your presence being allowed tonight.”
Tony continues. “Then a couple of weeks ago, thanks to some epic sleuthing and with a little help from our friends, we uncovered two key elements in the Pierce saga: a case in Ohio that involved some vibranium and a man in New York named Richard Parker. I’ll let Foggy tell you the rest.”
What the hell is wrong with him? Why is he having such a hard time coming to terms with this damn meeting? It’s not as if it’s the first time he has come face to face with someone with seemingly more power than him. Frankly, his whole political career has lived off of these kinds of moments—moments where he outsmarts those who dare underestimate him. So why can’t he pull himself together and do his job today, of all days?
“It’s going to be a long day full of bad news, Tony. You’ll wipe that smile off your face soon enough,” Janet says with a sigh.
And Tony, despite all that he had seen and heard in the past twenty years in American politics, asks Steve to do something that he has never asked anyone to do before.
“That’s what AI means, Steve,” Tony says with a chuckle. “Started coding him when I was still at MIT. Took about twenty years and nearly a million lines of code, but I made it happen.”
“And here I thought you knew me,” he murmurs, placing his hands on her hips and draws her closer, their foreheads touching.
“Tash, I think we need to talk about this,” Clint says, catching her stare in the glass before she turns away and searches for her earrings on the stand beside the bed.
“Well, I’m glad you finally got what you wanted,” Tony replies cheekily. He runs his fingers through Steve’s hair. “I like this look on you. All dirty and messed up.”
Suddenly, Tony is distracted by the TV. Steve is standing behind a podium in the Rose Garden, proud and dignified, beside him a very stern yet resplendent woman. He turns the volume up by a couple of notches as the President begins to speak.
When his phone rings, Tony can’t help but feel the exhilaration of a new, and perhaps dangerous inquest. The dread is there too, as the stakes look to be far too high to make even the slightest of mistakes.
They chat for a few more minutes about the war ahead, the dishwasher whirring behind them. Pepper’s phone dings—it’s Happy, and he’s already pulling up in front of Tony’s house—and takes her leave. Tony walks with her to the front door and waves at Happy when he rolls down the window to give him a salute. She opens the door, but not before she takes a long good look at him. “You’re an amazing man, Tony Stark. I just wish you would let others see it,” she tells him in a thoughtful tone.
Tony leans his seat back, crossing his legs on the top of his desk. “I think you know what I’m talking about.”
Tony shrugs, but does as he’s told. Steve takes hold of his shoulders and guides Tony down until his head is resting on Steve’s lap. Tony adjusts his body and swings his legs on the cushions, so he’s now lying comfortably on the sofa. Steve starts running his fingers through Tony’s hair and rubs his temples in alternate patterns.
“Tony…” Steve looks around the room, utterly mystified. Tony had always been an enigma. Even after more than two decades in politics, he had always been seen as the most public yet extremely private government official—he was everywhere, and everyone knew him. But only those lucky enough to be invited into his life truly
“’A dried-up harpy with a stick up her ass.’ It was horrible. And he also called the President a Ken doll, did I tell you this?” The horror is clear on Pepper’s face as she remembers the meeting. “I don’t think it was meant as an insult, though. I think he was flirting with him, which is even worse.”
Hours later, they are tangled in each other’s arms, the sheets barely concealing their naked bodies. There’s a hum of satisfaction in the room, both men satiated and enjoying the afterglow of their intense lovemaking. There’s no rush to do anything, no need to make big, sudden movements. They’re both perfectly content to have their arms—and legs—around each other, basking in their quiet intimacy.
Tony replies with a salute. “I’ll give her boyfriend a call too, see if he has anything for us on the DOD side.”
“As it should!” Killian exclaims, excited. “You’re an absolute legend on the Hill. Beauty, brains, and killer political instincts—or so I’m told.”
“Before anything else,” Wade interjects. “Let’s congratulate Janet for a job well done on the Carbon Emissions Reduction Act. After the vote this afternoon, we will have angered and alienated both the car and oil industries, hooray!”
He doesn’t know if he’s right, or if he’s once again forcing himself to see the good in Tony. Steve is hoping it’s the former, because no matter what public perception is, Tony is truly a good person. That much he knows, at least.
“That’s the Matt I know and love.” Elektra’s drink appears and she takes a sip, enjoying the smoothness of her favorite top-shelf tequila. “I assume this is not a social call. What can I do for you?”
And perhaps that short meeting was what made up Steve’s mind. He couldn’t really find any other alternatives to Tony’s suggestion, because at the core of it all, the Speaker of the House was right. Sacrifices have to be made in order to move the country forward, but for Steve, those sacrifices do not necessarily mean that people who make crucial mistakes will be left behind with nowhere else to go. Everyone deserves a second chance, after all, and he’s more than willing to furnish Maria Hill with one.
“You and I both, sir,” Bruce says with a chuckle. “Good night.” He closes the door behind him, leaving Steve alone once again.
“You want what I cannot give, Steve.” Tony takes a deep breath and tries to settle himself. “And, I think, no matter how many times I tell you that this has nothing to do with me not trusting you—because I do trust you, Steve, I really, truly do—you won’t believe me until I give in.”
So Steve shouldn’t be surprised that he finds himself about to make a call that he doesn’t really want to do. He has never really been good at dealing with the demons of his past, but he has found that it’s also part of the job description. The entirety of his life will not be able to escape the clutches of this job, and that is something he’ll have to accept and live with for the duration of his term.
"Couldn't help notice how eager you are to get rid of me. Got a hot date?" he replies after a beat's moment of hesitation. Darcy laughs.
They take their seats and Tony orders his usual. He’s here with the other Democrats often enough, and the staff know him pretty well. They also know how to be discreet, which is why Tony chose this particular bistro to meet with Carol and Rhodey.
But not everyone knows that the seemingly indomitable Nick Fury can also be afraid of Natasha Romanoff. He’s been in the business much longer than she has, but Fury has never seen anyone work or think like Natasha. She’s sharp, frighteningly brilliant, extremely efficient and chillingly unforgiving. Sometimes, she can even be unmerciful. And Fury is far from being an idiot—he would rather have her as an ally than an enemy. Besides, they both want the same things. It’s only a matter of attracting her sensibilities.
Kate’s face lights up, Tony’s earlier misdemeanor forgotten as she sets down the papers on his desk. “The usual suspects? Are assistants allowed?” she asks suggestively.
“I don’t understand.” Thor rubs his temples, clearly befuddled with the facts that Foggy had presented them. “Why would they divulge such sensitive information without the insurance of a signed legal document?”
“It was my pleasure.” Tony inches up and rises on one elbow to give Steve a deep kiss. He smiles at Steve through hooded eyes. “And yours too, judging from all those beautiful noises you made tonight.”
She shrugs. “All in a day’s work.” Pepper leans in to kiss his right temple. “Don’t be too hard on yourself. If it’s any consolation, we’ve done so much more these past couple of months than we ever expected to. Me being happy with the good work we’ve done because you’ve been collaborating with the President trumps me being pissed at you for keeping your team in the dark about it.”
Fury tries his best not to toss her out the window, but keeps the vexation on his face. “Watch your tone in this office, Hill. You’re not the Speaker anymore.”
He coughs, as if to forcefully expel that bit of introspection from his mind. “So, what’s the story?” Steve asks, trying to change the subject.
He spots his assistant, Kate Bishop, squeezing through a crowd of rowdy interns. Her frustrated face says that she’s been looking for him for quite some time now. He waves at her in acknowledgement. “Hello, pooh bear. Miss me?”
Tony groans out another set of nonsensical syllables in reply. He thinks about adding a sleep feature to JARVIS' holographic attribute, just so the bastard can feel what it's like to have his sleep interrupted. He does attempt to at least open his eyes this time. Attempts and succeeds, which is awesome, except he has no one to high five him for that. Maybe he really should work on making JARVIS holographic. It has been some time since he's had a side project. Not that he minds it, what with all the other things at the office that has been keeping him on his toes. Rather, the things his party has been doing to keep the Republican side of the House on their toes.
she notes mentally, but she’s still undecided as to whether she will actually outright thank him for flawlessly engineering their cover.
“Because if we do, Congress will have a field day and we’ll have a budget that is a far, far cry from what it originally was,” Bruce adds. “And that’s exactly what’s going to happen if we don’t put our foot down.”
Tony sighs. He didn’t think it was going to be this hard to convince his ever-loyal sidekick. “Kate, I’m a—“
“Did T’challa mention anything to you about this when you met at that dinner a couple of months ago?” Natasha asks Tony.
They head out to the west colonnade in relative silence, the Rose Garden alive and fragrant against the soft autumn breeze. The White House is stunning from the perspective of someone inside, more so now that everything seems to be so still, thanks to the shutdown. Steve has always loved walking here, and it has always made for great mornings. And it has also made for great evenings too, no matter how difficult and stressful his day had been.
Pepper walks to the edge of the desk and rests her palms on top of it, her expression dark and hostile. She has had enough. “Don’t think for one second that we don’t know what you’re trying to do here, Hill.” She leans in closer. “In case you haven’t noticed, we have a comfortable majority in the House. Your beloved Republican budget will never pass on our floor.”
Jane looks up at him, unsurprised yet expectant, and he only grips her hand tighter in response. They knew it would all boil down to Florida. They had tried to create an edge by spending the last days of his campaign there, but their efforts, it seems, weren’t enough. There’s sadness and disappointment in his chest, but, well—you win some, you lose some. He smiles at Jane, kisses her forehead, and turns to the staff that had worked so hard these past eighteen months.
“Here are the new unemployment numbers which I assume you will be happily blaming on the President to the next reporter you see; the defense report from the Pentagon with a note from Rhodey asking you to call him; a very angry message from Congressman Barnes about a million and one things he’s always going on about; and Pepper, Janet and Wade are already waiting for you in the conference room.” Kate opens a few files and slides it to Tony’s direction. It shows up on his tablet and he opens the folder, documents piling up in grids, divided by importance.
Natasha tilts her head, seemingly considering her friend’s offer. Pepper waits. Natasha normally doesn’t take her sweet time to think—she’s always on her toes, quick to give solutions to seemingly difficult problems. Her personal life, however, is an entirely different story.
“You know very well that we’re in the business of knowing our enemies, Tony. Not that you're my enemy, of course.”
He was completely wrong on both accounts. Public policy was nowhere near easy, and Jane was most definitely not impressed that he was at Culver.
was the adult in this whole conversation, as opposed to the duly elected member of Congress sitting beside me—who is, by the way, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the de-facto leader of the Democratic Party.”
And because Kate is Kate, she decides to just take advantage of the situation. “Please tell me you’re working on an upgrade for my phone.”
“It was…” Tony tries to search for a word that isn’t too damning. He fails. “Whatever. I didn’t mean anything by it. That’s just how I am. You’ll have to get used to it, I’m afraid.”
Tony nods curtly. He doesn’t say anything, but understands the seriousness of the situation even if he doesn’t know exactly what’s going on just yet.
