“Yeah. On the nights I slept at all.”
“Well I've been trying to rent the flat upstairs, and there's another young man who was looking for someone to split it with. It wouldn't cost much, and I'd like to think they're rather comfortable rooms.”
"Working." I was deeply engrossed in some monstrous text from the library.
“Yes, as a matter of fact.” He opened the folder, pulled out a photograph, and handed it to John. It wasn't the best quality photo, taken with a zoom lens from a fair distance, but the face was unmistakable. “His name is James Moriarty, and he is a decidedly unpleasant character.”
But how could he make them understand that there
Sherlock followed John and his troops across camp as they made their way to their tents. John was cracking jokes with the men, but Sherlock could tell he was only using humor as a coping mechanism.
Lestrade left to get coffee.
“A novel, Sherlock,” he said, still staring at Watson. Sherlock might as well have not been there. “Still, I think the two of you would have plenty to talk about.”
“What do you mean?”
“I assure you I'm nothing like him. He's an excellent businessman, excellent executive figure, but has terrible taste in books.”
Their world became a blur of lips on skin and a sense of being exposed and not minding, and Sherlock more vulnerable than John had ever thought possible. John wanted nothing except to devour him and feel every electric touch sing on Sherlock's skin. And while John had always considered his name very ordinary, it didn't sound that way when pulled from Sherlock's lips.
John looked up at him. He almost spoke, almost tried to come up with some sort of answer, but nothing would come. Finally, he just shook his head.
John was standing at the end of the bench, his arms crossed, staring at the floor. He nervously shifted on his feet.
Once the blood was cleared away, John could properly see the wound. It was a nasty gash, but probably looked worse than it was, given how heads wounds were. Still, it annoyed him that he couldn't at least put some stitches on it for good measure.
Sherlock made a little noise of disapproval but obediently followed John around the store. The place was full of things, most of which Sherlock didn't even recognize, let alone know whether or not they were appropriate wedding gifts.
When John could no longer keep his eyes open and finally succumbed to sleep, he wondered if he had been correct in saying they wouldn't remember anything in the morning.
John looked out the window, distracted. He was mentally counting down the minutes left before he could leave. Of course, that would mean standing, which would just draw Ella's attention back to his leg.
"Many years." I finished my examination and strode away. Most of my encounters with Molly were similar. Some were more forward than others.
“I thought you said the meeting was tomorrow!”
“Jesus, Sherlock! I'm fine.” Another careful bit of footwork to avoid some of the Casablanca lilies.
It was called “So That You Will Hear Me.” It wasn't one of the more popular Neruda poems, but he had always felt oddly drawn to it, and so it made this bookstore corner feel like a confessional.
"Well, if it's any consolation, when I woke up, I wanted to know if you were alive more than anything."
He looked around at the walls of the gallery. Some of the paintings were mostly intact, obviously farther away from the blast site. Some walls had been so totally ruined that there was no hope for the art that had hung on them. All that art, blown to pieces.
Sherlock's hand shifted from John's shoulder to the back of his neck, John's expression shifting to confusion for one second before Sherlock kissed him.
"Peace and quiet."
– and gave her a defeated shrug.
KR: You make it all sound very cold and devoid of heart. You have a sort of reputation, Mr. Holmes, of fabricating emotion, given that the poetry you write is so emotionally driven but you...
“That's going to become our running joke, isn't it? The thing about Harry,” John said in his deadpan manner.
“Yes?”
John kept waiting for the logical part of Sherlock to kick in, to question all of this, but it never did; Sherlock was far too undone for that. And John thought that this was what people meant when they talked about something being a masterpiece, this skin on skin and lips and hands shaking as they reached out for you, and the rest of the world melting away where all you could think about was the body flush with yours, and gasps and sighs and the feeling that it never had to end. There was no better taste than his skin, no better stars than his eyes, and no better art than his hands on John's back, holding them close to each other.
“Tomorrow's Friday,” John said from his end of the sofa.
“How on earth can you know this? How can that possibly be true?”
The thing about Baker Street was that it only felt like it really existed if Sherlock Holmes was in it. Sure, it was home even in the terrible interim, but it could have been any flat, anywhere. But his return, heavenly and surreal, brought the light back to the building.
“Hopefully.” He shook himself out of whatever dark corner he'd been in all evening. “I'm thinking Henry.”
“Are you?”
“A detective?”
The two of them felt the lurch as their own chariot moved forward, and as they entered the stadium, they both heard a whooshing noise surround them. The stylists had set off the rest of their costumes. John stared as plumes of smoke and coal dust began to swirl around Sherlock, flying off the coat as the wind tore at it. And then he saw the fire crackling around him, emanating from him. It wasn't a deadly sort of fire, more like what one would find in a fireplace late in the night where the flames were reduced to coal and embers, just as the smoke and ash coming from Sherlock was not threatening. They looked like home. He looked over his shoulder and could see the black smoke and trail of fire start to twist and turn into a trail of pyrotechnics behind them.
Sherlock was grateful John's back was turned. He would never have been able to look him in the eye after
“I stayed out of the limelight.” Sholto of all people would understand the desire to disappear.
“But you'll send in yourself? John, I'm not the only one here who depends on you. What will we do if we lose you?”
"Fine. Only if you'll explain something."
When John knelt down beside Sherlock and started cleaning away the blood, Sherlock didn't protest. But after a few minutes, he picked up the slip of paper and read it, and then scoffed and rolled his eyes. The smallest smile twitched at the edge of John's lips. Even out here, Sherlock could manage to be disdainful.
it had been forgotten. But Sherlock Holmes didn't seem the gift-giving type either.
“What exactly do you mean by that?”
Do you think you'll ever write another book like the last one?
KR: When was the last time?
“How many survived it, do you think? I've only seen death counts. No one seems to even be mentioning the survivors.”
"That why you stick to your books? To reign in your perversions?"
"Before what?"
He texted me once or twice during the evening. He was not alarmed yet, merely annoyed. I did not reply.
He could see Ella in his peripheral vision, making the universal gesture of tapping on the face of her watch. She didn't come to all the signings, but perhaps his odd moods of late provoked her to be present more often, under the pretense of wanting to be
John rested a hand on her head, gently ruffling her hair as he considered the options. Stay with her while she died. Leave and pretend he'd never seen her. End the suffering.
Well. At least Sherlock Holmes showing up in his room was one problem he didn't have to worry about anymore.
“Yes, and nearly one hundred percent of the time, they're wrong.”
“You mean John?”
, that's why.”
“Don't lie to me.”
"The extent of my consumption has been limited to alcohol."
“What?”
A few aisles away, he could hear the murmur die down, voices coming now one at a time. Half-listening, he caught the familiar questions as they drifted through the space between books.
“Well how can one tolerate living with someone if they can't even manage a meal with them?”
“You have no idea, do you?”
Molly stood by the door watching them through the glass as they walked away. She put the phone back up to her ear.
John woke once during the night, dreams shaking him from sleep once again, visions of things he wished he'd never seen. He sat up in his bed, breathing deeply as he tried to calm himself. And then he felt the hand on his back, fingers splayed. Sherlock sat next to him, concerned but unsurprised.
“What do you mean?”
“The threat is against the Borghese Gallery. The Borghese family was a patron of the sculptor Bernini. You know Bernini?”
“He gives me more credit than I probably deserve. But yeah, my father and I did put him back together again.”
Will there be a movie?
"Time passes differently when you're in a panic and are powerless to do anything. It passes quickly and slowly at the same time. Look at the clock, and an hour has passed. Spend an eternity pacing and wringing your hands, and it's been ten seconds."
“Really? That's where you're going with this? I'm blowing things out of proportion? Do you realize that everyone in this room could probably have this argument with us? We could practically pick teams.”
“Extraordinary patience and skill.”
Mycroft himself was a minor government official. Sherlock sometimes doubted the validity of that statement, always believing that he had more power than he was willing to let on. For the last few years though, Mycroft had come from the Capitol to act as escort for the District's tributes. Every time, he would insist on seeing Sherlock, spouting words of “brotherly concern,” which Sherlock mostly ignored.
“We really did luck out. This is the happiest I've been in years.”
“Sherlock! Not worth it!” The reporter stared at the two of them, slightly frightened, in over his head. But then again, they were all in over their heads.
"Fine."
“Whose life was I viewing?”
Not quite entirely parted, forehead to forehead, he heard John laugh under his breath and say, “We really need to go out again, have dinner again or something, we really do.”
The half of the house not occupied by the living room had a small second floor above it. Sherlock climbed the creaking steps to the one upstairs room. The roof was still intact here, the only light coming from the broken window.
There had been many nights where John had sat in the same spot, debating whether or not he should take the painting out to look at it. He always ended up leaving it hidden. The chances that Sherlock would venture up to his room were slim; it wasn't a common occurrence, but it was
“Your arrogance won't do you any favors, Mr. Holmes,” Irene said to Sherlock. “It will make you unlikeable, and it will cloud your judgment.”
Pause. John felt slightly smug that he was able to leave Sherlock unsure what to say. "Yes, I suppose you're right."
“Are you worried about tomorrow?”
Later that night, when John was on his way to bed, he asked again, “Are you sure you don't need Mrs. Hudson to open up the other bedroom?”
John was awake, but he couldn't make himself move or open his eyes. In a drugged haze, he tried to remember.
Of course, he'd been home since his initial departure, for the occasional holiday. But somehow this felt like the first true homecoming, and the nausea in his stomach, the defensiveness already taking root in his head, reminded him of all the reasons he'd fled to London and not looked back. Who even
(See the end of the chapter for
It was nearing nightfall in Liverpool, and all John could think about was how he didn't want to leave just yet.
Another pause. "Excellent, John. You may be generally oblivious, but now and then you surprise me."
Sherlock sat the violin down in frustration.
“I'm not going to kill you, Mike.” The man frowned, too confused to be relieved. “Go.”
like it. You're a scientist, and this is essentially your lab. I understand why you love it. But why do the regular people love it? Space is unfeeling stone and fire, so why do they find it so awe-inspiring and
Instead he found the owner sitting in the living room with one of the many books. There were snacks on the coffee table, which he was, of course, instantly offered. Admittedly, the man's hospitality
“This isn't a choice.” Mycroft set a folder on the end table, barely finding enough space to balance it amongst the pieces of charcoal. He left without another word, shutting the door with a decisive snap.
“Got that right.”
“And me?”
Sherlock stood by his chair, looking down at him, a small crease of a frown forming between his eyebrows. John didn't answer him, not directly, but said instead, “What would you think if someone came into your house and never sat down, just paced around scoping out the place, canvassing it? If it seemed like they weren't actually there to talk to you?”
“I wasn't in triage because I wasn't injured. I've been trying to stay away from the whole scene, to tell you the truth.”
He turned the book over in his hands finally, running his fingers along the edges of the yellowed paper. Auden. He had never heard of Auden.
?” John reached into his pocket for his phone, considering calling the police.
“Aren't you worried?”
And then John heard him say goodbye, and saw the phone drop from his hand.
It was true what they said, about time standing still in a crisis, how it stretched on indefinitely, life captured by a slow motion camera lens. He didn't give a second glance to Mary's body on the floor of his living room – who cared if she was dead or alive, so long as she was unconscious – reaching for his phone and dialing for an ambulance. Not for her of course. He dropped the phone beside him on the floor as he knelt down beside Sherlock, his heart racing as he saw the bloom of blood spreading over his chest and stomach, an ever-widening pool of red. When he got an answer, he shouted into the phone, the voice of the person on the other end of the line sounding tinny through the speakerphone feature.
He looked at Sherlock, his eyes wild. “They have to have their victor, yeah? They can pick. I'm not killing you. And you're not killing me. If they want a victor so badly, let them be the ones to do the killing.” He turned back to the sky, waiting.
“How many people are left?”
“We haven't met the client yet. No story to tell.”
"I know. Witness Protection. I'm the one who told you."
“Seriously?” Donovan looked between Sherlock and Lestrade. “You don't know what we've been working on?”
The Hickman was one of the smaller galleries in London, certainly not as famous or as popular as the National Gallery or even the Royal Academy of Arts. It could never afford very prestigious pieces, so its acquisition of a piece of art as important and valuable as a lost Vermeer made the news for weeks during the buildup to the opening of the exhibit. John knew little about Vermeer, an artist who he hadn't seen much of compared to others, but as always, he couldn't keep himself away from the temperature-controlled, hermetic feel of the galleries.
“He does now, though.”
John nodded, feeling a bit too tired to talk. Sherlock just frowned at his water glass.
John laughed under his breath. “Well, you have had to be pretty sociable today.”
“What?” John asked after a long pause.
sounded quite a bit more official than just
“I don't know if I should take that as a compliment or if it should make me worried about the competency of the force.”
“How on earth did you even meet such a person?”
“Yeah, I know you were there. He told me about you. He kept me up to date on a lot of his projects. You told me you were at the Hickman when we were together, and you told me all about it, but you know what? I never saw your name in any of the papers.” She never once moved from her perch near the kitchen doorway. “I looked at back issues, when I was investigating you, and you don't show up anywhere. You were a ghost at the Hickman. But I know Moriarty saw you there, and I know he saw you leave with something that didn't belong to you.”
sentimental.”
“Not really.”
. “Are you okay?”
The first time that it truly occurred to him, that he was actually living as opposed to just existing, he was elated, and the world suddenly seemed sharper and more real. He had walked around in an anesthetic haze for so long, and finally felt like he was awake again. And while he had been improving for quite a while, it's one thing to get better, and another thing entirely to consciously realize that fact.
JW: I'm supposed to say yes, aren't I? But honestly, I was just glad to be rid of it.
He stared at the ceiling, hearing Sherlock give one slow, deep breath beside him. Too close, too close and too inviting.
this place felt despite that. Even being monitored, the sense of privacy was overwhelming. If he tried hard enough, he could almost pretend that this was a place in the woods outside of District 12, and that there weren't monsters and horrors outside.
"After Irene Adler, we know how trustworthy records are."
John looked up at him, his hands dropping. “I should never have said that.”
“And yet, some people still get through the filters.”
“Which is different how?”

, that night in the church.”
Am I enough?
The following night, the two of them were walking home from dinner, having gone out after realizing the only items in the fridge were body parts. One of them was a human heart, a detail which Sherlock hoped would speak for him, but only garnered a muttered “Jesus Christ.”
He had only gone into Sherlock's room once after he died. Before, it had actually been a surprisingly common occurrence, usually for the sake of dragging him out of bed, or forcing him to get in it. Sherlock's sleeping patterns were notoriously inconsistent, given that he would work for days on end like an obsessive, and then would fall into long periods of physical lassitude when not otherwise occupied. There had been countless times that John had had to force him to sleep, physically pushing him down the hall telling him to go to bed. Sherlock always protested of course, claiming he was perfectly rested, and would always, without fail, be unconscious within minutes of his head hitting the pillow.
As Sherlock left the planetarium, stepping out into the high contrast hell of the London night, he turned his head to the sky. In between the city lights, he could see one or two stubborn stars fighting their way through.
She smiled. “The great Sherlock Holmes. Where's your pet? You two are very close, aren't you? Platonic?” She laughed. “How did you two get separated? Lose your way?” She made a face, a false expression of pity. “You know Jim? The man from my district? He's a big fan of you, too. You and your pet. He wanted you all to himself, Jim. He was hoping he'd...stumble across you in the arena.” She dragged the tip of the spear across his cheek. “Too bad. But at least if I see him again, I'll have one hell of a story for him. And if I get back to District 1, it will be the story of a

When Sherlock actually met John's eyes, he saw it, his own expression, or what he imagined it must have been, mirrored back at him on John's face.
were setting them off.
Had he not been relying on his hearing, he might not have caught it. If he'd been distracted by facial expressions and body language, the remark could have come off sounding flat. But there was a sad edge to the sentence. It was almost uncharacteristic. Sherlock was never sincere when he said things like that. It was always part of the punchline. But John thought back to the pool. He remembered the look on Sherlock's face when, for a split second, he thought John was the culprit. He remembered how quick he was to give away missile plans on the off chance that it would help him. He remembered how the first thing Sherlock had done after Moriarty left was to tear the explosives off of him. And he remembered how, before blowing the entire building up, he'd looked to him for confirmation that it was okay. Maybe his remark was serious, as much as the detective would despise admitting it.
“Right.”
Sherlock paused, running through pages of quotations in his mind's eye. “ 'Who pensive away from one he lov'd often lay sleepless and dissatisfied at night,/Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might secretly be indifferent to him.' ”
do was walk through the woods. Every day ran into the next, just one long progression of trying to rest and running and never seeming to find the end of the arena. It all just stretched in front of him into infinity, one long walk that would soon end.
He almost snapped at her – are you still pissed about that? – but was proud of his own restraint.
"On what, exactly?"
“That's a bit harsh.”
“Then what?”
“All right?”
While he sat on the edge of his bed, wondering how much longer he could stay in his room before John noticed how long he'd been gone, he replayed the afternoon over and over in his head. The way John had said the word
“That remains to be seen. But for now, you will go to Afghanistan and you will do so
,” Sherlock said. He stood a few feet away from John, the wind tearing at his coat. At his feet, a bed of yellow English primrose. In his bare hand, the heavy pale pink bloom of a camellia bush. “Certain varieties are used for tea, while the oils from some of the plants are used to clean blades. Lovely contrast, don't you think?” The bloom looked like it physically weighted down Sherlock's hand, even though Sherlock himself looked so captured by the wind that it seemed as if he was lighter than air itself.
For the first time in moths, he felt like he could breathe.
“I've just loved these little Games, haven't you, Sherlock? Alas all great things must come to an end, and I have a train home to catch.” He laughed, giddy. “I'll be a hero back home. They'll talk about me for
John stared at the old woman who entered the room. He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but she certainly wasn't it. She was small with light, wispy hair and a soft look in her eyes. She wore a skirt and a a fitted jacket with puffed shoulders, both colored a deep plum. She smiled kindly. Her Capitol accent wasn't quite as strong as most, and she had a homey sort of comforting quality about her. She walked up to him. “Hello, John, dear. I'm Martha Hudson. I'll be your stylist this year. How are you?” John couldn't recall anyone sincerely asking him how he was until then.
Sherlock felt his phone buzz in his hand. A single line: “Dinner tonight?”
John paused, but only for a moment. “I didn't know you were friends with Mike.”
John smiled at him as he walked into the living room of Baker Street. He was seated comfortably in his usual chair, reading, and his eyes seemed to flood with relief to see Sherlock returned in one piece. Sherlock threw his coat over the hook on the door as he briefed John on all that had occurred. John listened with his usual attentiveness, Sherlock moving to sit across from him in his own chair, steepling his fingers and quirking a smile at John's praise and concern. The most amazing thing about John Watson, Sherlock thought, was that even though the world was moving around them, John made it feel stilled just by his presence. No special ability needed. His calming influence always spread over Sherlock in such a way that he didn't feel the need to halt the world. John grounded him and stilled him enough.
“I wish I didn't have another flight to make. I'd say we should grab a bite to eat or something.”
“Makes for the most interesting murders though.”
He looked up, his hand halfway to the flowers, waiting for explanation. Sherlock's hand was outstretched toward him in a warning. “Poisonous,” he said.
“When we got here, I suddenly understood why there were so many British poets,” the man said in a voice that Sherlock was sure he thought sounded sensitive and cultured. He snapped the photo and passed him the phone. “Do you live here?”
When they were about halfway to the stage, Sherlock saw a change come over John's face. The panic had vanished. And he called out, “I volunteer!”
"John, I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I'm flattered by your interest, I'm really not looking for any –"
“Oh, hello, John. Who's your friend?”
“You have wings. Why do you have wings? Are you a ghost? Or were you always one? Are you an angel? Or is this part of a near death experience?” He spoke quickly, his words coming out tense and manic. John grabbed Sherlock's wrist and felt no pulse. He began to feel sick. Why was there still no pulse if he was standing right here?!
Sherlock raised one hand up, a simple gesture of surrender. Kitty drew her weapon back just a little. He gave her a look that he hoped came across as resigned and hopeless, like he knew he would soon be dead. It pleased her.
He shut his book of Auden and looked around him for the nearest display, taking a few quiet steps to reach it, plucking one of the copies of
Sherlock paused, looking at John. His smile had faded. “Ah. Yes, I did, didn't I?” He looked like he was about to say something more, but finally just extended his hand. “Try not to get shot.”
“Back off.”
, Sherlock.”
Sherlock glanced down at John's hand, finally smiling a little. “Thank you.”
They went upstairs, Sherlock throwing his coat over one of the chairs at the kitchen table rather than hanging it up neatly like he usually did. He was still drunk enough to not care. John reached for the only bottle they had in the flat, grabbing two glasses. He filled them, and handed one to Sherlock, who drank it without question or pause as he walked into the living room.
By the time the world began again, he was in a near panic, and both his shoulder and his leg throbbed with pain.

“They just let the rain in?”
. It's a movie.”
“Expanding your horizons?”
was far too appealing. No doubt a trick of tone of voice, or a trick of Sherlock's lying memory, a false impression to lessen the feeling of mortification. John's words always had a soft edge to them, didn't they? It wasn't odd for a word to sound so easy when it was spoken by him. Surely the way he had said it was a cruel figment of imagination, a hyperbolic version of his usual patterns of speech.
A voice stopped him. Lestrade, toasting the two of them. The entire room had turned to stare at them. Lestrade kept talking, something about how if it weren't for the two of them always solving murders together that he and Molly would never have become so close. Sherlock seemed to only hear every other word, barely processing half of what Lestrade said. People clapped, glasses were raised. But all Sherlock could do was glance over at John, who stood almost at attention like the soldier he had been, his jaw set and an incredibly tense smile on his face.
Mycroft looked back at him. “He has a point. People have been murdered for twenty pounds. People have been murdered for fun. It's not that great a stretch of imagination to think that a megalomaniac is bombing art galleries and stealing his favorite pieces. I've heard stranger things.”
for a while first.”
Thanks to
He watched the countryside, all the small towns, race past him outside the window. The sun was setting, and soon the only indicator of civilization would be scattered lights in people's distant houses. John loathed the country. He spent all of his youth wanting something bigger. So when he came of age and London became attainable, he had bolted and never really looked back aside from occasional holidays and crises. As another insignificant town blinked in and out of existence out in the fields, he sighed with the realization he always had on these train trips: that his family actually knew very little about him now. They knew seventeen-year-old John. But how much did they know about him as an adult that couldn't also be found on a dust jacket or interview or Wikipedia page?
Sherlock was the product of an affair between a Capitol ambassador and Sherlock's mother. Mycroft was the man's legitimate child, born and raised in the Capitol. Sherlock had never even met their father, but had a feeling that if he was even remotely like Mycroft, he wouldn't have liked him much anyway. The man sent enough money to keep Sherlock and his mother alive. When she died, the money stopped for a few horrible years, and then was reinstated by Mycroft. Sherlock was never sure if he did it out of guilt or a twisted sense of misplaced familial obligation.
He stopped, struck suddenly by the truth of what he had always considered an obvious conclusion. Of course John had never been in a relationship with Mary.
"Merry Christmas, John."
your breakup speech, yeah?”
"Finding the bread to be equally complicated?"
He hated her for a moment, then, and found his voice getting low and almost hateful, cold. “When
Sherlock wouldn't look up at him, his head bowed and eyes glazed over. The great Sherlock Holmes, impervious and calculating, ever-ready and composed, was still just a human being. It never occurred to John that Sherlock, despite his choice of occupation, had never been in a war zone of any kind until now. For once, John knew something he didn't: how to hold it together despite the chaos and destruction surrounding you every minute of the day. Sherlock couldn't bounce back to baseline so easily. John couldn't help but think of something Sholto used to say, a quote he would throw around when they were stuck in a particularly miserable situation, heartbroken and exhausted and touched by death in a hundred ways:
“Of course, we're surly every evening, I'm sure.”
“There have been other art galleries receiving anonymous threats, and we have cause to believe that it is our original Hickman bomber, rather than a copycat. It's becoming problematic. One can only sustain high level security details for so long at so many different museums.”
be a second person. It was the only explanation.
“The entirety of the literary world,” he said quietly, more to himself than to her. The dark planetarium floor's carpet seemed more relevant than the supernovas. It was still, and silent, and empty. He had to force his eyes away from it. He stood to leave, but paused next to Cairns' podium, looking up at the simulated supernova on the ceiling, an artist's reconstruction in icy blue. “So what is that?”
Sherlock was quiet for a while, and John was nearly convinced he'd gotten through to him. But then he said, “But the potential for delayed effects –”
They reappeared in the Diogenes Club.
Sherlock lifted his eyes from the wood grain, but refused to make eye contact. “I don't know when exactly. My parents were rarely home, so it isn't as if there was a great deal of physical contact. It could have technically started before I was aware of it. But one day, I reached for Mycroft, and burns erupted on his skin. The woman our parents had watching us at the time was scared to death. She quit after that, understandably. Mycroft scarred rather badly, finger marks. Perhaps you've seen them?” John nodded. “I suppose we both believed it was a fluke, since that seemed statistically more likely. But nearly a month later, we wanted to see if that was the case. Mycroft wanted to know more than I did. He had me touch him, one fingertip on his forearm. It scarred too, looked something like a cigarette burn. By all logic, your face should be mangled right now.”
, but was failing miserably. “Never mind. What's going on?”
“What are you doing back here?” John looked around at the empty room. “You picked the farthest possible point from everyone else.”
“Was it?”
“Happiest thing from your teenage years?” John set his glass down on the table, leaning his head against his hand.
Even as he said it, the doors opened again and a woman in a long bathrobe came in and took a seat across from John and Sherlock at the table. She had a great mass of dark hair hanging loose around her and was wearing a self-satisfied smirk on her face. John had heard stories about Irene Adler. She was considered wild and uncontrollable back in the District. But she had at some point had enough of a handle on life to win the Games, at least. John could remember the year she was chosen. She had been fourteen at the time and had gone into it with all the confidence and vitality of a Career. John didn't watch the footage, but he had seen her after she came back. She spent her life as a victor drowning in debauchery and drug use. He'd seen her around the District with her “friend” Kate and her collection of syringes. But John was sure that was her way of coping with what she must have seen in the arena, so he couldn't really fault her.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat up straight, the slanted back of the planetarium chair disappearing from behind him. “Mycroft isn't know for his accurate assessments of human emotion, or even the most trite of plot arcs for that matter.”
“I would
“Of course, you did say that people couldn't be friends, so that throws a kink in things.”
“I won't stop you.” Finally, a smile, a glance.
“Neither do I.”
“You know what I mean. You've been doing this all week, spouting off facts and vanishing.”
Lestrade sidled up next to Sherlock, another drink in his hand. He had been going at it steadily all evening, high on his successful interactions with Molly. He smiled at her from across the room while Sherlock looked in the opposite direction. John, talking to Mary.
Sherlock thought it was irrational, and yet, he was doing it anyway. It was a few days later, and he had spent many hours loitering around the Tesco, on the off chance that he would run into the same man again. He just couldn't shake the feeling that something about him was important. That was irrational, too. After all, the man was not very tall or striking, walked with a cane, and wore the blandest clothing. And yet...
The hole in the rock led to a sort of cave, and John instantly began to worry that he wouldn't be able to see, but he soon saw the hole in the rock far above at the top of the cliff. It cast a good beam of light down into the cave. It wasn't as small as he'd anticipated either. There was more than enough room to stand, and while it wasn't very large across, the two of them had a fair amount of space. It was definitely large enough for the Capitol to still be watching it.
John took a strained breath and finally just leaned into him, hugging him tightly for just a few seconds. It was enough to take Sherlock by surprise, and when John stepped away, he looked back to the ground, staring at the gun.
“Wedding prep,” John said.
“I've got all day.”
,” he said distastefully, spitting the word out.
“Should you be touching them, then?”
“No.”
John snapped the book shut and handed it to him. “Why would I care about your address?”
“I know
A sudden stillness took Sherlock over then, and he leaned back, lying down on the stairs. He sighed. John watched quietly as Sherlock fought to keep his eyes open.
The Monet on the opposite wall was the antithesis of the Vermeer in John's closet. And really, it hardly felt like a Monet with its odd color scheme. It was of water lilies, of course, but the colors were on fire, painted during a sunset. Instead of Monet's usual rich blues and greens, or even his more broody blacks and grays that he used for cityscapes, the painting was a shock of warm colors in an otherwise cool room. The only hints of Monet's favorite lush color palette were in tiny dabs, bits of purple and green here or there, just enough to keep the sunset from being overpowering. It had no darkness to it, no cold city under even colder stars. And it had none of the baggage that the Vermeer lorded over him. Perhaps that was why he liked it so much, when the few scattered other patrons were drawn only to the most famous pieces.
All the irritation drained from his face, and his expression softened considerably. I took one deliberate deep breath and went to curl up on the sofa so I would not have to look him in the eye.
He wasn't looking at John, but at the Monet on the opposite wall, hands in his pockets, his face blank. It was rare for him to do that. Usually, John's subconscious could at least concoct a scenario where Sherlock would actually see him for a change. But maybe this was just another sign that even this small reprieve was fading, and would soon leave him entirely alone.
“And that's enough for you?”
“You're still watching it, though.”
Moran was an imposing man, fairly new to the office. He was tall and tan with sandy hair that he had slicked back neatly across his head. He had a sculpted square jaw and cold eyes. Whenever he smiled, even Sherlock, with all his limited insight into the subtleties of human expression, could tell it was insincere.
John had heard the cannon in the night. It had jostled him out of a doze, making his heart hammer in his chest for a few seconds. He only prayed it wasn't Sherlock.
"And you call yourself a sociopath."
His eyes showed one desperate flash. "I'll tell them about you if you do!"
He could have said anything, something poetic and meaningful, something apologetic. But instead, he grinned, and said, “Come to tell me who Harry is?”
John paused, glancing at his watch. Well. That explained the pajamas.
The world was a noisy place, and unfortunately, that made things rather hard on a jumpy, traumatized soldier. No one quite seemed to understand that, friends coming up and clapping him on the back unannounced, startling him, people dragging him to action movies that were packed with explosions, everyone speaking in such loud voices that every tiny noise seemed thirty times louder, every clink of silverware, every phone, every car engine, all of it deafening and exhausting.
John had more or less ceased using his own ability, because he didn't need to. He didn't want the world to freeze when he was with Sherlock. Sherlock was a creature of nearly constant motion, and John never wanted that to stop. The longer he lived at Baker Street, the more his panics faded, the more at home he felt. He was still saving people, just in a different way.
“You're never in here this early unless you're on a case. And if it's a case, you're here with John.” Sherlock said nothing, though he tried to speak, and failed. “So you must be avoiding him.” Sherlock gave her a small tilt of his head. “Oh, Sherlock, you –”
It was a crisp, cold night. The streets were fairly empty, most of the usual crowds either out of town or safely tucked away in their homes. There was a coating of snow over the ground. Sherlock always preferred the aftermath of snow more than the actual snowfall itself. After the fact, snow left everything calm and empty, always providing a sharp contrast to the conditions inside his brain.
When I was finishing writing the part in the Pantheon, I was sending Clem messages about how preoccupied I was with the rain still being able to come in through the oculus, and naturally she understood this preoccupation and had a perfect response about how she saw these children dancing in the rain inside the Pantheon. Clem is too much, but I'm glad she's in some of the same preoccupation hells as me.
“Who was the farthest off?”
“God, especially after we really deal with the press. I keep getting calls from people wanting to interview us. And I would much rather disappear, maybe let your brother fill in some of the blanks for the papers so we don't have to fool with it. So now it's just a question of
“No, but if you don't try to ease your way back into the world, it's just going to get harder.”
When they got to their suite, Sherlock immediately set out a bowl of water from the kitchenette, and then made a quick call requesting food and supplies. He looked after the Irish Setter so fondly that all John could do was stand in the living room and stare blankly.
“Yes.”
“Jesus? Seriously? You fall off the face of the earth for days, don't answer any of your calls or texts, and all you can say is
“I take that as a compliment.”
"I'm glad you're okay, too, Sherlock." He heard a scoffed laugh nearby, and then it was silence as he fell back to sleep.
“But then again, I suppose everyone appreciates Monet.” The voice had weight to it, a rumble that would vibrate in his chest. Sherlock, startled by the brief noise, followed a family across the room with his eyes, an excited child bouncing alongside her parents. He gave the tiniest shake of his head. “Well, nearly everyone.”
. All these little words and phrases stayed floating in the space between them like stars, and with every admission, their voices softened, and John knew he could never stay angry at Sherlock Holmes.
Eleven.
“Of course, Dr. Watson. And how are you this morning?”
my address.”
“Seriously?”
Sherlock remained at the back of the crowd during the rest of the session, and when the fans began to line up for autographs, Sherlock stepped in toward the end, the copy of
Irene smiled. “I know what they like. You're going to be a harder sell, I can tell you that much.”
They both started at the sound that suddenly came crashing from the sky. A voice that, when it spoke, threw both of them into shocked silence. They let their hands fall, still clasped together, John's face going blank with fear rather than relief.
John's suitcase, let alone looking
“So now that he's back, will I get to see you a bit, now that the shock's worn off?”
“Bets?”
John had never felt safe in this kind of silence. It always preceded explosions and gunfire. But even as the silence stretched on, Mary didn't move to throw things at him, and she didn't sling terrible words at him like his parents had done to his sister when they were teenagers. The longer he waited for the first blow, the more he realized that it was never coming.
“So?”
As Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, John said, “Mistake.”
They would be wrong.
He was enigmatic, rather intriguing, if John was being honest. He felt foolish, though, allowing any part of himself to be so taken with this stranger. But there was
a pompous bastard.”
The room had almost as little furniture as John's, but it didn't feel so temporary. It felt comfortable, homey, like the rest of the flat. All over were little details that made the place so distinctly Sherlock's, like the periodic table on the wall. This room was
Lestrade heard John's real question. "No, but John-" Lestrade stopped mid-sentence. The only way he could describe John's expression was pleading.
"Did you tell him about Moriarty?"
“To do something like this over a fight with a girlfriend. Anytime you argue with anyone you usually just brood for a few minutes and change the subject. If you're really angry, you might walk away for five or ten minutes to get some air, but you don't take a train ride out of the city over a fight with your girlfriend.”
“You okay?”
“You've seen stranger things.”
“What?! Why?!”
When John looked to the wall, the woman was gone.
“Well, anyway, it ended, unsurprisingly.”
"You know why Cathy and I split?"
Naturally, he said nothing about this to Sherlock. Despite his sentiment while drinking, Sherlock was still mostly indifferent to the sentiment of others, and John didn't even want to try and imagine what his reaction would be to John's honesty. How does anyone react when told by their friends that they've saved a life? So while he let himself be pulled into Sherlock's orbit indefinitely, he kept quiet. But more than once, he caught himself looking at Sherlock like he was the sun itself.
“Yeah, he likes Whitman. I suppose if I had to choose a favorite, it would be that one. If you read it, you'll see what I mean about whether or not the poet believes in love or coldness.”
“You didn't have to.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you, the Victors of the 75
“I'm not kidding, Sherlock, when does one of you brother's cronies come get it?”
“You really are a cagey bastard.”
“Isn't that a bit trite of a question, John?”
. Somehow, John Watson had made her compelling despite her collection of serious limitations. And the stars even touched this book.
"And what?"
“Coal miners?”
How do you show kindness and honor in marble eyes? How do you convey the shade of blue when all you have to work with is white? And how on earth do you carve out lips, knowing that they cannot answer you when you speak?
, John. As in the Romantic movement.”
show.”
“Really, John, it's quite elementary.”
Sherlock gave a small nod, pretending to be fascinated by Lestrade talking on stage.
“Your friend has good taste.”
“When did what start?”
“What?”
“When did I say that?”
Sniper rifles. Semtex. A silent nod to Sherlock. Shooting the explosives. Nothing.
“He's been traumatized, Sherlock. We don't want to risk pushing him over the edge by making him think he's hallucinating again.”
“Maybe not. And even if she does, whose good favor would you rather have? Hers, or his?”
Holding out one hand, he beckoned to John, urging him to come forward. He would have just said so, but the words kept dying in his throat. John nodded stiffly, taking a few shaky steps toward him. Sherlock closed the distance and met him halfway, grabbing him by the arm.
“Oh lord, Mycroft, go back to your office. I think I can brief John in a much more interesting and succinct manner. You'll be here all day.” John saw Sherlock appear in the edge of his field of vision, striding past him and Mycroft to the door. He heard the click of it opening, sure Sherlock was standing by it still. “Goodbye. Call if you need anything. Although don't expect me to answer.”
“You know there wouldn't be enough room. You'd rather have that ambulance full of people working to save him.” And as much as he hated the statement of logic, John knew he was right.
at one of those.”
There was one day where John beat Sherlock home. Usually Sherlock had to be dragged from the house, but now and then he would spend a day in the labs working and would be out till all hours of the night. John figured tonight was one such night, and it was just as well. The day had been as terrible as a day in a clinic could be. One patient had to be taken to the hospital after going into a dangerous heart rhythm. There were hoards of screaming children, it had seemed, letting out piercing yells every few minutes. The patients in general were all in terrible moods and a great many of them decided to challenge both John and Sarah's medical opinions, as if they knew the first thing about pharmaceuticals. It had been so miserable that John and Sarah weren't even capable of speech during lunch, and both of them audibly sighed in relief when they were done for the day.
“But before then?”
They were all taken to individual rooms, where their stylists would see them off. John didn't like not being able to see Sherlock. He'd grown used to him since the Reaping, and there was something terribly final about this separation, as if it was supposed to remind them that they were from the same district, but they were not members of the same team.
"What do you want, Lestrade?"
I stared at the dotted line for a long time before signing it. Mycroft pretended to remain unaffected, but I could see him breathe a sigh of relief, could see some of the tension drain from his shoulders. But his expression was still unforgiving.
But the man who opened the door didn't look a thing like any cook, driver, or maid that John had ever seen. In fact, he looked like any salt-of-the-earth type that one could find in well-meaning small towns all over the country, dark hair and bright eyes and an ease of motion that made him seem fluid and soothing.
And despite the fact that everything was paused for as long as they deemed it so, it felt instead like finally, everything was starting.
"And?"
I saw so much of their fundamental wrongness as a child. I watched my parents argue with each other, watched my father try to compensate for his indiscretions with flashy gifts. Mycroft tried to hide me from the fighting. He failed miserably.
They said little the rest of the night. There would be time enough for words and battle plans later. For now, everything was just this quiet, unobtrusive little night, hidden away from the watchful eyes and speeches and parades. And even though no amount of comfort, no amount of privacy could ever make up for all they'd been through, it helped.
"No doubt."
He had to quit the clinic.
The black mood intensified, and as he waited, it shifted from irritation at Sherlock to a full blown dislike of everyone and everything. They shouldn't have to be doing this. No one should have to perform so that someone could assign them betting odds for the masses to use, statistics on how likely they were to die. No one should have to have interviews and pageants and pretend that everything was okay.
Suddenly a hand was on his shoulder. "John, stop. You don't panic when you get blown up, and you're going to panic over waking up in a hospital bed? Not rational." The hand disappeared.
It was adrenaline. That was all. Just adrenaline and timing. Or, that's what John told himself. But when Sherlock looked back at him, trying to slow his breathing back to normal, he found that excuse harder and harder to believe.
"Well, you aren't at Baker Street. My skull does not quite suffice. I needed to talk aloud, and I always talk to you. Since you are here, so am I. Simple."
“So why are you so angry? What did she say that set you off?”
“No. He's alive. The news will probably break today, if I had to guess.”
"You know John didn't take your...death...well. Are you sure you want to start all this on the holidays?"
, which still stood out among all the others as something different. Not glaringly so, mind you, but there was definitely something that wasn't in the other various crime novels. He'd hoped that the books would give him some clues about their creator, but reading between the lines had never been his strong suit. Fiction was manipulative that way.
John stood and took a couple of hesitant steps toward him. He looked Sherlock up and down, scrutinizing every inch of him. The eyes, the hair, the ridiculous coat. It was all there. There wasn't a single missing detail, not a single deviation from the real man. John reached out and laid a hand flat across his chest, as if testing to see if he was in fact just a Christmas spirit. But Sherlock was solid. He was no dream.
The silence stretched on between them, pointed but not unpleasant. Sherlock heard the sound of the cab pulling away, the tires crunching on the ground. Had it only been seconds? It had seemed so much longer.
They both waited, agonizing over every second that the all clear didn't come over the intercom. John ran the numbers in his head, how likely someone was to survive in a code blue level of crisis without dying or suffering permanent damage.
No speech, not for a long time. Just the baked white stone barrier between them and the world, the sound of the ashtray's metallic little clinking on the table as Sherlock tapped his cigarette too roughly against it. The heat should have felt oppressive, should have smothered them both and crushed words and thoughts alike, but it didn't. It was insulation. It was peace.
"And I'm a loved one now, am I?"
anyone.”
“I honestly have no idea.”
He couldn't say it, couldn't get out the truth of it.
He grabbed his coat from the hook on the door and headed outside, needing to be somewhere less still, less empty.
"No, she's in Geneva. I know you told me she was alive because you believed she wasn't. You were trying to protect me."
John stood there for a moment, hand on the door frame, an unconscious block. He had to force himself to step aside and let her in.
part. You reacted to the
Some days he felt like that would be a welcome change, to be in one of his galleries like any other day, and then have it meet the same fate as the Hickman. But in these hypothetical bombings, he never lived through it like he had the first time. In these thoughts, the bombing would take him out too, the explosion and fire finally making all this bleak tedium go away.
“I know.”
“We're merely following up while we gain more information on our suspect.”
“Aren't you going to answer my question?”
Perhaps pointedly, Mary never mentioned Sherlock. Surely she knew, since Sherlock had become such a public figure near the end of his life, since she was an avid reader of the news and had likely seen all the stories about the end in Rome. But she never spoke up, never asked John all those questions that any girlfriend would want to ask. For a while, he was grateful, but when Mary finally broke her silence and asked about it one night, John hated her months of silence, feeling like they'd only been a steady buildup to what devolved into a cold and distant conversation.
John listened to the mumbling from across the room. John wondered if he was slipping into one of his sullen moods, the relative mental inactivity finally getting to him. John knew that cold cases would only keep him occupied for so long. And he realized he wasn't really sure what to ask Sherlock, at least, not anything he would answer.
John had grown more and more convinced that The Man had saved his life. Against all logic and rationality, he believed someone had saved him before the harried surgeons at the army hospital had sewn him up.
“No, I don't. I don't like not understanding.”
“No, this case is with the police.” He pulled the door open, waiting for John to get in. Knowing he wouldn't elaborate until John did what he wanted, he gave up and slid across the back seat.
They sat against the cave wall, a few feet away from each other. Night fell so early that it felt later than it really was, and neither of them could manage to fall asleep. But it was the safest John had felt since entering the arena. He could almost believe the lie of safety here.
At his front door, a place they had stood what felt like a hundred times, he always expected John to come up with a sociable way to end things,
"Not quite how I imagined it going, though."
“What's got you this far off the beaten path?” The owner began to check John in, and John blindly signed the forms, slid his card across the counter, wondering if his better housing option might have been in the fields with the sheep.
“Because I'm not an idiot.”
I paused for a beat before turning back to my slides and saying, "I don't
“Don't bother being all comforting and tactful.”
“The violin in the score is pleasant.”
John wished he could have done more for them that day. But he had so little to work with. He did what he could, but he often felt it wasn't enough.
“Baker Street feels like home again.”
“So why did my charge wander into my lab today?”
KR: The book turned you into an overnight success. An international bestseller. Ten books later, and you're revisiting some of
“Yes, of course. One of the leading theories is related to
Irene clapped and gave a cheer of delight, but Mycroft remained stoney.
The man whirled around and looked at John with a manic glint in his eye. “Say that again.”
Sherlock had gotten dressed and made it all the way to his front door before he started feeling doubtful. It took him nearly ten minutes to decide to actually step outside.
Sherlock couldn't hold the smile on his face any longer. He attempted “neutral,” for lack of a better option. He nodded. “It was no problem.”
"Relative term."
"Hope so," John said drowsily, after some delay.
“John!”
“This is the first time I've ever been in your place, and you seem really reluctant to show me any of it.”
And to Sherlock's surprise, he said, “Sentimental,” though he could hear just how much difficulty he had had in getting that one word out.
It made the world feel a little more hopeful.
“I'm not sure where my phone is, exactly, now that you mention it. I haven't picked it up for days.”
The door opened and a Peacekeeper let Harry slink in. Her eyes were red from crying, and when John stood up, she rushed to him and collapsed against him, holding on to him like she had no intention of letting him go. He put his arms around her and tried to calm her down, to no avail.
lost.”
No matter how long he looked for an answer, still, no answer presented itself.
John stared hard at him, prickled by his nonchalance until his eyes fell to Sherlock's hands. There was a barely noticeable shaking to them.
He picked up the slip of paper. “Keep it up. They love you two. IA.”
“I don't know about that. Probably he knew if he sent you to me that it wouldn't get lost in the shuffle or stolen. But maybe he did want me to have it. He was a boisterous man, you know, which was charming, but it also meant it was rather difficult to tell when he was being serious or when he was joking around. A very vivacious man.”
Irene explained the cornucopia to them, telling them that if they went anywhere near it that it would increase their likelihood of dying by quite a bit, but a single shared look between the two of them made it clear that they had no intentions of heeding her warnings. Neither of them would run away from the only resources they had. Still, Irene stressed the importance of getting the hell out as fast as possible, which was something all three of them could agree on.
John glanced at the new text message, darting his eyes around the bookstore as if the patrons could somehow read it too. He had a reading due in mere minutes, and though he already had a tendency to stall, he found the desire to do so even stronger with the appearance of this. It was from a number not already programmed into his phone, but was there really any doubt as to who it was on the other end of the line?
After night had fallen, he slowed his pace, not wanting to stumble upon them. He hadn't planned this far, had never considered that he would actually live through another day, and so he had made no provisions for what he would do for the night.
But he took comfort in the fact that his earlier assumption had essentially been confirmed, that he was safe at the mercy of Sherlock Holmes. And while he'd assumed then that Sherlock would keep his secrets due to logic, the night had made it painfully clear that there was more to it than that.
Not one for tears, John still found it difficult not to let them rise in his eyes. “Are you serious?” The surgeon nodded. “Was he the code in OR 3?”
“The dog. I think I'll call him Henry, after Henry Every.”
“No, I guess not.” John stepped forward, petting the dog's head.
him. It was so obvious to him now. How had he never noticed before? Or had Sherlock just made sure he didn't notice? Had alcohol just stripped away the veneer? Looking at him, at the honesty in those eyes, John was inclined to believe that that was indeed the case.
When he pushed through the second crowd he wished he hadn't.
"I think we have it set for seven right now. Why?"
"Preposterous."
"Don't even start," Sherlock replied, failing to suppress his grin. He pushed the door open and stepped out into the cold with John.
Sherlock couldn't help but laugh, even if only in relief. Maybe this whole thing wasn't a big mistake, wasn't something that would come back to haunt him like all those poems had over the years. Maybe he wasn't someone's curiosity or punchline anymore.
Suddenly John felt like there was a palpable tension hovering in the air in the space between him and the corner. After too long a pause, Sherlock said, "Well at the very least, you will have a very interesting story to tell on your blog."
He instantly caught himself using the plural instead of the singular, and briefly thought that he should tell Mrs. Hudson she could rent out the upstairs bedroom. It must have brought a smile to his face, because Mary snapped in front of him. “Hey!”
“Stars don't actually twinkle, you know,” Sherlock said. He looked back at his phone to send the message before replacing it in his pocket. He resisted a resigned sigh. It had become so common, replacing what he wanted to say with something meaningless, that it only made him feel tired and empty.
“Good and bad are relative terms. And you said so yourself. They don't know me.”
]: Doesn't it? Doesn't all writing mean something?
“That depends. Do you want me to?” He leaned his arms on the table, expecting banter even though he hadn't said it as a joke. Initially, he meant to. But it didn't come out that way in the end.
John had always looked at works of art from a safe distance, no way of marring them or obscuring them. But Sherlock wasn't a painting or statue. He was a work of art that didn't have to be appreciated only from a safe distance. There was no rule in place that prevented him from being touched. Finally, a work of art he could touch like a painter making brushstrokes on canvas.
“Must you make everything difficult?” Sherlock had only smirked. “We have a meeting for the two of you scheduled for the end of the week. Try to make a good impression.”
“What? It clouds the brain?”
There was no way this man was a dream, not when he was warm and alive and right there and wanting him. And John could think of nothing except how much he loved him. To hell with Mary and a house in the suburbs and a stable clinic job. Who could ever want any of that when there was
“I know you do.”
He took the cloth and clean water, grateful she had thought of such a small detail, and washed away the blood and dirt. He could see the wound more clearly after that. It wasn't quite a puncture or a tear, but it was a nasty wound either way, and all he could hope for was that it didn't get infected. He took a liberal amount of the cream and smeared it over the wound, trying to work it into the cuts as best as he could. He could almost feel it take effect. Whatever Irene had managed to get for him wasn't just to heal the wound, but to numb the pain a little as well. It seemed to have some type of anesthetic properties. John gave a relieved laugh, resting his head against the rock behind him, the desperation he had felt all day fading some.
“No, no, do not turn that back on. Christ, it's just a television. We've had them for years.”
John crossed his arms over his chest, an automatic defense. “Believe it or not, but I'm really not very interesting. No need for a lengthy about the author page. There's nothing to say.”
“No.”
Moriarty had wanted to cause destruction far more than he wanted the painting. The
The ordeal had lasted long into the night, hours and hours of tense jittery nerves and the Roman heat suffocating the crowds outside the gallery. Of course, everyone had thanked Sherlock for figuring it out, but he hardly heard them. He was still more concerned with the text messages on his phone, still coming at steady intervals. Even after the crisis was over, the texts kept coming, still naming names. It had Sherlock worked into a panic.
“You think Mary thinks I was in love with him, too?”
“Then don't dwell on it. Let it sit for a while. It doesn't look like Mary's going anywhere either way.”
After a few minutes, Molly smiled and said, "We'll do a better check later, of course, but it seems to me everything's in working order. Any visual disturbances?"
“Good publicity can wipe out all sorts of unpleasant details of personality,” Mycroft said. “Though I'm not sure there's ever enough in some cases.”
“But I'm not.” John reached out and laid a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock half-turned, looking at John's hand in confusion. “What are you doing?”
If he shut his eyes, he could almost pretend that they were home.
help.”
Sherlock heard the split second pause, the author waiting for the next question. And although there were people sheepishly raising their hands, gearing themselves up to speak, he ignored them and stole their moment from them.
One can become quite fond of praise and concern. As much as I acted indifferent, it was rather endearing to see someone worry about me the way John did.
John sat quietly in his chair as he always did at this time of night, reading and usually failing to relax. It always amused Sherlock, how much he attempted to be like everyone else when the reality was that John was only truly relaxed when on a case. John wasn't even entirely aware of it, which Sherlock just found endearing.
“Best not worry about it now, I suppose. As is usually the case, I'm sure the answer will become clear in time.” The smiled widened, became one of those flashes that made him seem more alive than a regular human being. John couldn't help but smile back at him. Sherlock took a few steps back, the dog following at his hells. He glanced over his shoulder as he turned away to walk to his room. “Till tomorrow then. Goodnight, John.”
John glanced over his shoulder at him. “I was trying to figure out who the hell you were.”
“An expression of reciprocation.”
Two: His own ability was becoming dysfunctional, signaling an impending end to his still world.
. We are anomalies because of the Quarter Quell. In a regular year, the arena would be nothing but children. I've watched children kill other children before. I have no reason to believe that they wouldn't at least try to kill us as well.”
“Well, now and then it hits me how little I know about you. I mean, I know you, but I don't know hardly anything
He was an addiction. But it was better than alcohol or drugs.
"Don't play games with me, Sherlock. I'm trying to figure you out. I mean, what do you want out of life?"
“Because, as you would know if you paid attention during our meetings, it is an active war zone. We've had to send many of our guardians there to minimize the death count.”
"Astute observation."
“Yeah. Owe it to you, though. I really do believe he wouldn't have made it otherwise, since you were the only person on earth who didn't think he was a monster.”
“It's not that exciting.”
“Oh, you recognize that flower, then.”
Outside, the streets were mostly empty, due in part to the late hour, and, he was sure, due in part to the Hickman bombing. It was easy enough for him to slip unnoticed into a pharmacy on the next block, hood of his jacket up to try and conceal the cut. The other customers didn't pay him any mind. He was a ghost to them.
No, he would have to handle this the old fashioned way.
“You know.” He gave a little wave of his hand. “He's one of those people who thinks emotions are a waste of time. So I don't think he feels things that way.” He tried to shrug, to brush it all off, and from the look on Sholto's face, he knew he had failed miserably. John waited, expecting a joke or a quick retort, an old-fashioned army jab, but Sholto just watched him quietly, slowly nodding his head. He wasn't even looking at John when he finally decided to speak.
"Do not make me regret my actions,
John smiled a little. “I've just been in a sort of chaos the last few months.”
He shut his eyes and pulled the trigger.
“I was doing what you told me to,
“What do you mean?” He pulled the gloves on.
“There is nothing rational about this!” Whatever had made him resigned, even scared earlier, had vanished. “I'm not going to kill you, Sherlock! I'm not!”
The other writers – the ones who made their living monetizing human beings in magazine articles – had pestered him for a while when he was trying to make his exit from the public eye. They all wanted to know so much, when was the next collection coming out, what would it be about, who were his favorite authors, on and on and on, the same series of tedious questions. And then there came a point where he could no longer dodge these questions, could no longer put them off. When that time came, the questions became more serious. They all wanted to know why he hadn't put out more work, why he seemed to want to talk about anything
John tried to smile. “I'm surprised she came by at all, really.”
“Anthea
John laughed. “Yes, it is.”
Lestrade prickled a little at the comment, but seemed too grateful for the help to be truly upset. He turned back to John. “He yours?”
“To tell you the truth, Mrs. Hudson, I'm not even sure if he sleeps at all.”
“Well, not all of us can physically go to space, of course,” Cairns said, moving constellations around on the ceiling above her. “So it's a decent substitute. And I like knowing that the children who come walk away with an appreciation for the universe. Their eyes light up like you wouldn't believe. It makes my science accessible to regular people.”
“Well, it's still a new variety, right? Even if it isn't the one you were hoping for. Don't people name these things?”
“Contract killer Mary Morstan was found dead in her prison cell this morning following her arrest for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Police have yet to release further details, but believe her death was the result of a prison-killing rather than any of the injuries she sustained during her murder attempt in Baker Street. Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade states that as soon as they can release more information to the public, they will, and states that had Morstan survived, she would likely have been convicted to life in prison for her recent crimes, and that there is currently an investigation to uncover the rest of her work with the Moriarty crime network and other acts committed before assuming her alias.
“Well, if they're broken, then they understand what it's like to live under the shadow of something. And if they're especially strange, then they won't care. Conventions don't matter to odd people, do they?”
How do you stay so motivated?
She smirked, looking around the room like she always did. “Sherlock knows everything about everybody, but I know something about you that he doesn't.”
“And how did you get here exactly?”
“Abrupt?”
While John expected to continue hearing about the cases Sherlock worked, he never imagined he'd be included in them. But soon he found himself chasing after a serial killer. He wasn't sure why Sherlock enjoyed his company on these cases, since he wasn't exactly filled with deductive prowess, but whatever the reason, he was glad. It was the most fun he'd had in
John let his hand drop, expecting Sherlock to walk on into the kitchen, but he remained rooted in his place, watching John with the same curiosity with which he had examined every facet of this new world. John was about to speak, to bring him back from wherever his mind had wandered off to, but Sherlock brought his lips to John's and stole the words from them. And John might have pulled away had his first instinct not been to kiss him back.
“This bomber is playing with innocent people's lives, Sherlock.”
John nodded, but he wasn't sure he believed her.
“Mrs. Hudson let me in.” She swept into the room, looking it over with the same attention and fascination she had the first time she'd found her way in. John nodded, but in the back of his mind he could have sworn he had heard no one knock and that Mrs. Hudson had gone out shopping hours ago. Surely he'd just missed her returning home. Mary walked slowly around the room, hands behind her back, and her eyes fell to the open bedroom door. “The mysterious bedroom you had closed up last time, I assume? Yours?”
He wanted the crowd to part like the Red Sea. Wanted to eliminate anything standing between them. Wanted to say
Mycroft paused, let out a frustrated sigh. “You're going home.”
“I don't know. Different. Not a bad different, but different.”
John was standing on the front steps, staring at the ground. When he looked up, surprised, Sherlock tried to wipe his own face clear of any hint of shock.
His head was pounding, an incessant headache, and as a doctor, he logically knew he should go get checked out. But also as a doctor, he decided it wasn't worth it, that surely he was fine. He had had worse, after all. Just exhausted. Some sleep would help.
John Watson.
He sent back: “You realize I don't know either of those poems, right?”
museums end up being blown to pieces.
“Not sleeping, John?”
“I don't guess you need me to open up the upstairs bedroom, though?”
Sherlock was watching John's face for every minuscule change in expression, praying he'd be able to read it quickly enough to know what to say. But John's face was blank. Sherlock had never seen him so confused. He wanted it to be real, but some part of him was still saying it was a dream, that there was no way Christmas wishes were actually granted outside of movies.
Mycroft was waiting for them, standing beside a glass coffee table with his usual smug expression. He greeted both of them, but only John replied, and even then, tersely. His patience for Mycroft was not lengthy on the best of days, and lately his involvement with the Hickman case had made his patience even shorter. Mycroft treated it as the most important thing on earth when all John wanted to do was close the case and forget about it.
“Because forensics doubts that the Vermeer was destroyed. They believe it was stolen in the fray.” John's throat tightened, and he couldn't bring himself to look at Sherlock, a dark blur in his peripheral vision. If he did he would collapse. He would never be able to look at him now and keep quiet. “When factoring in that the other galleries who have been targeted have also recently acquired priceless pieces in their exhibitions, it stands to reason that the bomber is strategically targeting them for the pieces themselves.”
Part of him was grateful that everyone seemed to like the speech as much as they did. When he had been writing it, he'd thrown out draft after draft because they all sounded like love letters. Even the final version did, but by then, he didn't know if there was even a way to give a speech without that being the case. He had just hoped that the general public wasn't nearly as perceptive about such things as he was. And he had been right, mostly, although he'd seen Molly look at him sadly at one point, as if she knew. Of course, if anyone knew, who else would it be?
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
The long days began.
"So who was that, then?" John had heard the not so pleasant tone of voice Sherlock had used with the visitor.
Felix just smiled. “Brings his ally count up to two, at least.”
Sherlock shook his head. There was a small puncture wound on his palm, bleeding. “Thorns,” he said, nodding toward the flowers. When John took a closer look, he saw them. They could be easily missed, not so obvious as rose thorns. Sherlock hadn't been paying enough attention.
his parents anymore? Who was
“I managed, didn't I?” He refilled his glass.
“Shoulder,” John said icily.
John's hand slid down to his wrist. “What the hell are you doing?” He grinned, amused. Sherlock's face was just slightly flushed from all the drinks, and so close to John's that he thought he could feel the heat radiate off him.
Sherlock looked around at the other chariots, ignoring the entirety of Moran's speech. He found Moran unsettling. Everyone did. But even more unsettling was the dark haired man from District 1. He was grinning manically, his tilted crown catching the light. He shot Sherlock a look and laughed to himself. Sherlock felt the lurch of the chariot beneath him and forced himself back to the present.
Mary nodded. “Of course. I'll do whatever I can.” She gave him a kiss on his cheek and said, “As long as you promise me that you'll try to win.”
He was not expecting a book of poetry. Granted, he wasn't that sure what he expected at all, but it wasn't poetry. Perhaps the childish characterization of poets as sensitive and thoughtful people was what made it so absurd, given the brusque nature of the man who had forgotten it. Maybe it was meant to be a gift, and that lack of personal investment was
As soon as Sherlock stepped out of sight of the cameras, the smile evaporated and it was replaced with a look of pure distaste. He came and stood by John, glancing up at the screen before rolling his eyes.
,” he said, far too sharply. Sane men didn't snap at their girlfriends when they were only trying to help.
Sherlock looked from Mycroft back to John, and after a pause asked, “Why did you do that?”
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock!" The tone was both concerned and admonishing. "Where have you been? What the hell happened?"
"I'd like to see you try." Sherlock glared at his older brother, who sat behind his desk, his hands folded calmly in front of him.
"I thought that was part of this silly holiday?"
John had thought about going out somewhere, or getting some things crossed off his to do list, but after standing in the kitchen doorway for a while, he decided to just sit and listen to Sherlock play. He could be ridiculous and baffling, but he was still intriguing.
“Not particularly. Does it bother you? What your parents did to your sister?”
When we were called in by Sebastian, I felt a smug sense of satisfaction. He needed my help after all these years. And it took me all of fifteen seconds to see that he was still living alone, still hating himself. He tried to bring up our days at university multiple times. Every time, it took him nowhere. Sebastian, who had called me horrible things, was easily replaced by John, who called me
John took in his surroundings without opening his eyes. Cool sheets, needles in his arms and hands, a beeping machine nearby, gauze and bandages covering much of his skin. Hospital. John thought for a moment how odd the sensation was, being the patient instead of the doctor. He could hear the nurses and staff in the hall, rolling the vital signs machines and chatting about their days as they made rounds.
He had to get out. Had to run. Had to find John.
“Darling, that's what we're doing. Think of this. Who usually wins?”
All John could do was smile back at him, kissing him again just as gently as he had all the times before. The sun was higher in the sky now, cutting through the white curtains, beating down on all the people whose days were beginning. They would go on with their lives, many of them so unaware of all the sunrises. They happened every day, so they would likely be dismissed. But there was no way to dismiss this sunrise, no way to dismiss the lips on his, the quiet brush of skin on sheets.
intelligent. It's a fact."
He heard someone clear their throat, knowing it was Ella as his eyes guiltily turned away from the phone's screen.
Sherlock was on the ground across the street. There was no way he could possibly be alive, yet John still refused to believe that the rapidly growing pool of blood belonged to the person who had saved him so many times.
"I never act without thinking." John knew that was true, but he was still surprised when he felt a pair of lips against his own. John mentally cursed the heart monitor. There was no way to hide the increase in his pulse.
“Apparently not. Enlighten me,” he said through his teeth.
A flicker of movement farther up the cliff drew his gaze away from the man. He squinted in the faint moonlight, thinking the Capitol had inserted some wild animals into their arena. But there was a small glimmer as light hit something metallic. Sherlock's thoughts instantly went back to the guillotines, the blades hung in the trees. Was this more of that tribute's work? The one who had “sponsored” the old man?
It couldn't be clay. Clay was too impermanent, too easily ruined. That was the problem. Sherlock's audience would be made from something grander, something stronger.
"Oh come on," he pulled his desk chair over near me, straddling it and giving me a conspiratorial grin. "Why waste your life?"
“Should we leave on our own terms?”
you don't understand.”
It was hours since he'd stopped caring where he was. It was all the arena, so what did it really matter? He's just walked and walked. He'd tried to sleep a little the night before, which failed miserably. So as soon as there was enough light to safely move through the woods, he'd started walking again.
this, exactly? What to call it? There had been no discussion of labels just as there had been no discussions about Sherlock's life story.
“You're quite good. I like that much more than you nearly ruining my computer.”
Did she always keep her hands in her pockets like that?
John laughed. “Call it what you want, then.”
A look of delight came over the owner's face, and he got up from his seat and blindly reached for a book, as if the whole conversation had happened before and it was muscle memory. It was a slender black volume, and the man flipped through it with ease. “This book is called
"Absolutely. I rather like this one as well."
John laughed, his hand on Sherlock's forearm. “Sherlock! Get off!”
John drained his glass and refilled it. He laughed. “That'll be a train wreck.”
“What you've been thinking since we arrived.”
“The patients or the plain doctor?”
“You just answered your own question.” He paused and then added, “How's Harry?”
the government. One evening, John had made some offhand remark at Mycroft's expense, about how he was dressed awfully well for a government peon.
“What is that?”
What could he really say to her? That he'd been broken so many times, and was finally beginning to feel whole again when everything was taken away? That Rome was harder for him to live with than the Hickman and Afghanistan combined? That his frequent solitary trips to art galleries were the only ways he could find anything remotely close to silence in a world that seemed to never shut up? That he had somehow fallen in love with the most extraordinary person on the planet, and that even more remarkably, the person had likely loved him back?
“On the contrary, it's one of the only redeemable mediums left.” He tugged off his gloves, setting them to the side. It was impossible to look at John, and out of habit he let his eyes fall to the floor. It was always more difficult to maintain composure and eye contact at the same time; he settled for composure. He slid out of his coat and crossed the room to hang it up before slinking over to his usual chair to sit. By the time he was safe against the gray leather, John had moved to the bookcase and was reviewing the other titles.
"True. It's a shame to leave, though. This Tesco your usual haunt?"
He craned his neck back, looking up at the sky for a moment before stalking off into the woods. Minutes later, he heard the noise, the machine generated rush of wind through the trees. He turned around, looking back toward the clearing, just able to see the first body being taken up, an arrow falling from her corpse and landing on the log, its tip embedded in the dead wood.
“It is in a genus of cacti.”
“I have no doubt that you will manage to acquire meaningless acquaintances with ease.”
“You don't say. Interesting.”
When he brought the food into the living room, handing Sherlock a plate, he noticed what he was watching. “Why are you watching that?”
“You won't win this argument.” Sherlock sat back in his seat, almost annoyed at such a proclamation.
"How do you figure that?"
Sherlock knew things. Unlike anyone else, he had made peace with the fact that Sherlock simply did know all about him. Things that had bothered hundreds of people about Sherlock didn't affect John in the slightest. Sherlock wondered if that was because he'd seen so many shocking things overseas, or if he was just naturally unflappable.
John sat back in his seat. “Get in the way?”
, or something to that effect.
“I was planning on telling Mycroft once the news about Mary died down. I was going to get rid of it, I swear.”
“Neither do I.”
“I was afraid you'd say that.”
And why couldn't John leave it behind, or return it, or at the very least allow it to rest for the night instead of letting it keep him awake?
“I live here.”
“What exactly do you have to say for yourself?” Mycroft towered over him, his face twisting very unattractively.
“My god, you are a cynical person.”
lavender, not blue.”
“Nothing, at least, I don't think so. I was wondering if I could meet you at Bart's today. I want your opinion on something, as another doctor.”
like me. Here I am.”
Sherlock didn't startle at his voice. In all likelihood, he'd known John was there since the second he walked in the room. He answered without looking at him. “I have never been one for long nights of sleep. They are a waste of valuable time.”
Sherlock stood there in silence for a long time, trying to decide John's motivation. Was it the alcohol? Was it annoyance at the dull nurse? Finally, he quit trying to figure it out, set down his violin, and reached for his coat and scarf.
“You've stayed.”
“Yes.”
"Soon after you were admitted. He's gone now. He says to
John reached for his usual bag in his closet before deciding that it was too small. He reached for the large suitcase without thinking and didn't even realize what he'd done till he opened it and saw the outline of the painting tucked inside. The Vermeer had been in his thoughts less and less as time passed. He wasn't even sure if people were still investigating the Hickman case aside from the Holmes boys. But suddenly it was the only thing in the world. He couldn't even bring himself to unwrap it from its cloth hiding place, couldn't make himself actually look at the brush strokes and uneven spots in the paint. He still remembered exactly what it looked like, down to the signature and the little cracks along one corner. If he shut his eyes standing there in front of it, he would be able to see it. But still, he reached out a hand to uncover it like a child trying to convince themselves that monsters aren't real by flinging open their closet door. But as his fingers took hold of the edge of the painting's wrappings, he heard Sherlock calling him from downstairs, and after a moment of agonizing hesitation, he flipped the suitcase shut and shoved it back into its dark corner, where it would continue to haunt him at night when he returned home.
