He slumped down in the seat with Ash humming absentmindedly next to him, rolling paper.
“Worth the wait,” Dean replies, stroking a hand up Cas’s back.
“So,” Hannah said, once they were back in the car with Thick-neck a few hours later, “We’re going to get you some nice suits made, so that if you need to accompany the Boss anywhere, you can do so while dressed appropriately. I’ve already sent your measurements and sizes off to our shopper, so they can purchase all the clothes that the Boss requested for you in the right sizes.”
“I heard that rule number one was to never leave your gun uncleaned.” Ash said from the bathroom door, his mouth full of toothpaste.
“Naughty,” Castiel said, nudging Dean with one of his feet, “You’re lucky I like you.”
“And, what else?”
Dean looked away, his gaze drifting to the city beyond the huge windows. He needed a moment to think. It wasn’t like this man was ugly. Unless he was into some weird kinky shit, Dean could do a lot worse than fucking this guy on the daily.
“Isaiah wasn’t here to serve your meals?” Castiel asked, his brows raised in surprise. It was an interesting look, Dean decided, on the face of a man who seemed to have everything in control all of the time.
“You Dean Winchester?” the guy said.
“Take a hit,” He said, “Why’d you get into all this heavy shit anyway? It’s a beautiful day, the sun is out, and we’re not in prison. Let’s just all be chill.”
“I thought we were going to Denver?” he asked as they headed deeper into Nebraska.
“No, but monsters do.”
“So they were all taken to the woods and hanged?” He asked.
“No like a horror movie.”
"Cas, I--” He can't quite say it, blushing as he runs his fingers over each pair with reverence. He loves getting nailed six ways from Sunday, but the panties are still a bump in the road for him.
“Of course,” Dean said, heading over to the drink cart, filled with crystal decanters and sleek glasses.
“I’m taking you wherever you want to go, seeing as you just helped me kill the thing wearing your dentist.”
“Put these on,” his Boss said, handing him a pair of noise cancelling earmuffs and a sleeping mask that was a soft baby pink. It said ‘Princess’ on the front in gold cursive lettering.
“I wasn’t sure if you were joking, so I did.” Cas said, despite his only packing the two shirts he liked and a change of pants.
“Fuck,” Daddy said above him, grinding down against Dean. It felt amazing. Dean was so hard it ached, his own cock leaking onto the lace of the thong.
Dean ate his words about five minutes later, just after Helen had smeared wax on his crotch and pressed the thin but strong looking muslin into it. She didn’t even count him down when she pulled the first strip off. The wax had been almost uncomfortably hot, but it was nothing compared to the burning as his pubic hair was ripped out of it’s follicles. Helen was a fucking sadist, repeating the process again and again, all around the base of his dick and all the folds of his sack. His eyes were watering, but he managed to only let out the occasional grunt as she tortured him methodically.
When Dean got home that evening, there were another three hundred dollars in his pants, tucked down the back this time, bills slightly crumpled from having sat on them for an hour.
“I think we have a case up in Ohio, if you’re interested,” Dean said, “I was thinking we could leave after breakfast.”
“You, uh... You got somebody there missing you?”
“Essentially,” he heard the man say. God, none of these people could give him a straight answer.
“Alright.”
“Breakfast is adequate. I feel sufficiently courted.” Castiel said with a straight face.
Dean was hoping they would go straight home, but Cas instructs him to drive in the opposite direction.
He watched as his Boss considered him for a moment.
“What am I supposed to do with this, huh?” He asks, gesturing to his erection, “It’s my birthday and you’re going to leave me like this? You’re terrible.”
“Well, looks like I got some reading to do.” Ash said from the table.
“Oh,” fuck, he’d forgotten about that, “What do you think it should be?”
Castiel sipped his whisky and fixed his intense gaze on Dean, who was still rubbing his feet.
“You’d better clean that up before Isaiah sees it.” Daddy said, grabbing Dean by the neck and pushing his face towards the table, “He won’t be too happy if you leave that from him to find.”
“Oh yeah,” She said, hurrying down the steps to receive him, “Real big dog problem. Ate half my goats.”
“That was so good,” Dean says, his voice raspy.
“Sounds nice.”
Daddy looked up at him, raising an eyebrow, but Dean just smiled innocently, knowing what his Daddy wanted but not giving it to him. He relented before long, the need for more overwhelming the desire to tease. He tucked the band of his panties behind his sac and got to work, stroking his cock in one hand while rolling his balls with the other.
“What?” Dean said, pulling his phone out of his pocket to check the time.
He feels it coming, the way Dean tightens around him, his back flexing and bunching, and then he comes, a guttural groan leaving his mouth as his body clenches. Cas tips them over, laying down on their sides while he’s still hard and in Dean’s ass, rolling his hips gently, just to keep the movement going.
“Come here,” his Boss said, sitting in his big chair and pulling Dean down with him, until he was sitting neatly in his lap. He held Dean close, leaving a soft kiss or two on the side of his neck.
He woke up to a room cast in long shadows, and a cool hand against his aching flesh.
Dean gathered up the thermos and the camp chairs, before setting off towards the house.
Castiel didn’t even look at him as stalked off down the hall towards his office.
“Isn’t your ass sore?”
“I don’t give a fuck how the law works, Dean,” his voice soft but clearly dangerous, “Your family owes my family, and this is how it is, no matter how much you wish it weren’t. Take your lot and be grateful I’m being this lenient with you. Figure out your shit.”
“I don’t owe anybody anything,” Dean said, his tone icy as his patience wore thin. He put the glass down and crossed his arms.
They were half-way across West Virginia when Cas mentioned it. It. The feeling.
Dean was kind of stunned. Thirty seconds ago, he’d been preparing for an orgasm and now Daddy wanted him to just... Put his clothes back on?
Right. The reason he was here.
“Man,” Said Ash suddenly, “You two need to loosen up.”
“Is that right,” Dean murmured, reaching out to touch him.
Castiel leaned away from him, focusing his full, intense gaze on Dean. Oh shit.
“I’m always a fan of giant Lincoln.” Dean said, glancing sideways .
Castiel narrowed his eyes in confusion.
He shoved his hand into the front seat, offering up the mostly gone joint.
“Fine,” Gabriel replied, “You’re no fun. We’re all downstairs, come for cocoa when you’re done being grumpy.”
“Is it over?” Dean asked, his voice strained.
“My apologies for the wait,” Hannah said, carrying a large silver tray in one hand—the kind with the big round lid on top. Dean had only ever seen those in the movies.
Daddy shifted off him slightly, and Dean heard the clink of his belt being undone. He tried to roll over, but Daddy placed a firm hand between his shoulder blades, holding him in place on his stomach. He lifted his hips up slightly to help Daddy slide the shorts down, but they stopped at mid thigh, keeping his legs tight together. The thong stayed on.
After that, he moisturized his whole body, the lotion on the counter smelling like peaches and cream. His skin felt soft and smooth in a way it hadn’t in years. He wanted to feel nice, to smell nice, for his boss. There was a fluffy white bathrobe, and Dean wrapped himself in it, content to sit in the misty bathroom and apply various creams to his face, just to see what they felt like. He knew they were expensive, because he’d seen some of them before, in one of the big department stores downtown that he felt too broke to even be in. He wanted to try all of them, their smell and feel and texture. Plus his skin looked amazing—if you ignored the finger shaped bruises blooming along his neck.
“Good,” Daddy said, pressing wet, open mouthed kisses against his neck, “Good boy. My good boy.”
Just as he reached that realization, the blows slowed to a stop.
Castiel hid his smile in his eyes, focusing on the curve of the road and the mountains falling away to the right of him. There was every chance that they would get to wherever they were going and, someday, the cops would be waiting to meet them - but Castiel knew in his gut that it was unlikely. He tried to avoid naivety by vowing to himself he wouldn’t blindly trust the man who said monsters were real, but it was a pointless promise. He’d witnessed the creature’s teeth with his own eyes, and he knew a good man when he saw one.
“Hypocrisy is a sin, you know.”
“Okay Daddy,” he replied, lazily opening his eyes to watch as the thong was pulled down to the middle of his thighs, his hard cock finally released from it’s confines, standing at full attention.
He jerked his hips a little, gasping at the feeling of his flesh dragging across the leather as Daddy thrust against him. It only took a few seconds before Dean had a rhythm going, matching his movements with Daddy’s, both of them picking up speed as the pleasure grew, not having the patience to make it last.
“Wait here,” he said, “Leave the bag on.”
“Okay, but what really happened?” Ash asked.
“What kind of appointments?” he finally asked, once they were on the interstate.
There would be no chance of escape, then. Dean sighed.
“Hello, Dean,” the man said to him.
Dean grit his teeth. This wasn’t going to end well. He advanced on the monster, who was knocking over anything he could reach, pushing the woman at the counter off her stool, getting as many things between itself and Dean as it could. Satisfied, it turned to run - straight into the cashier, who was now in front of the counter
Dean laughed, hopping down from the desk and tucking away his dick. His legs felt like jelly, his whole body loose and relaxed.
pls leave a comment if you liked it. Thanks for reading!
I'm so sorry for taking so long to finish this! I've had three thousand words just sitting in a doc since literally the last time I posted. In my head it's only been a few months since then but turns out my head is not accurate and it's actually been nearly a whole year. Oops.
Dean did as he was bid, warm palm pressing against the smooth hot flesh of his cock, fingers circling his shaft as he started jacking himself, slow as ever. The slide was dry but Dean was sure that wouldn’t be a problem for long, pre-come already beading at the tip, just waiting to be smeared all over.
“And you’ve forgotten to address me properly all but once, so we’re going to have to do something about that.”
There was a cushioned area to rest his chest against, and padding for his knees. It made sense then, he realized, his head was bound to be right in the Boss’s lap once he was sitting at the desk properly.
“Get under the desk,” he said, as though that was an entirely normal thing to do.
Castiel had seen more Cactuses in the last half hour than he ever had in his life. He was drowsy as they turned off the highway, and hoped that wherever they went had fewer cacti. Dean began to case the outskirts of town, hoping to spot the cheapest looking motel possible. He explained carefully that it was more to do with the honour system that every good shady establishment seemed to stand by, than the cheapness of the place. If a manager had something to hide, they would usually go ahead and add you to the list, he said.
Dean stood quietly next to him, his own phone burning a hole in his pocket.
“No, on your hands and knees. Turn around,” Helen said, and Dean’s heart sank.
“So,” his Boss said, once they were alone again, “What do you think your punishment should be?”
Castiel’s eyes widened.
Castiel smiled at that, full and bright as he let out a chuckle. It made Dean’s stomach hurt.
“Love you too.” Dean says, tucking himself against Cas.
“Like a butler?” he asked, finally.
He got home by six, his apartment cold and empty. Dean sighed, deciding to have a hot shower before parking himself in front of the T.V. for the rest of the evening.
“Come here,” Castiel said, doing up the final button.
Ash disrupted the peace by clambering over Castiel onto the un-occupied half of the bed.
Dean blushed harder, gripping the cushion in front of him again as he thought about what Daddy wanted from him—to hump the couch, to fuck his dick against the leather seat until he came. He was so wet, the lace of the thong sticking to his tip, the drag of it delicious. Daddy’s cock was so hot between his cheeks, he wished it was inside of him, filling him up. He felt out of his mind with how bad he wanted to be fucked in that moment, surprised at himself with how much he craved it, needed it.
“I do value my shut-eye.”
“Well alright then.”
“Thank you, baby.” Dean says softly, laying down next to him.
“‘Lo?” he mumbled, managing to answer the phone while keeping his eyes mostly shut.
“You’re very good at your job, so far,” Daddy said, laughing a little, “But I agree, I think it’s time to discipline you again. I’m too busy to be dealing with a brat.”
They barely moved to begin with, a miniscule roll of Dean’s hips against his, unhurried and unstrenuous. Cas bent one of his legs, his foot anchored in the sheets, trying to make it easier for Dean to balance and get a rhythm going.
The earmuffs were people pulled from his head, although the mask stayed firmly in place.
He was pulled from his thoughts as the Rolls took a sharp corner, pulling up at a nondescript parking garage.
“Thanks,” Dean replied, eyeing the bottle. It was an expensive one, they’d sold it at a hipster bar he used to work at in Kansas. He’d never bothered spending the extra money, but he knew they were nice.
“Of course. Is there anything else Boss?” Hannah said, turning slightly to speak to Castiel.
In the end, he forgot most of what Dean had told him, not waiting for heartbeats or breaths, but holding the gun as steady as possible, aimed at the wiry brown fur that he could barely see in the starlight.
Instead he spent a long time alone, exfoliating and cleansing and washing his hair until it was soft and silky. It felt luxurious, and Dean couldn’t help but love it.
He reaches for the last present, Cas squirming beside him.
There was a goon leaning against the opposite wall, who started walking off the second the door clicked shut, not bothering to wait for Dean.
“I think I’d like to use you now,” his Boss said, and a thrill ran through Dean right to the pit of his stomach.
Dean settled back into his seat and stared glumly out the window, watching the people on the street as they drove past. It was annoying not knowing what was going on, but in the long run it was better than smashed kneecaps. And an unexpected perk was getting to see a doctor for free, that was pretty great.
“Pretty much just that,” Dean said, shrugging, “He asked what the time was, I was looking at my watch - it attacked. Just plain bad luck.”
“They’re going to think we planned it.” Cas said.
“Thanks, I made it myself.”
“I’m going to sit quietly for a while,” Castiel said, stepping down into the main living room, “Would you pour me a drink?”
They pulled up at the curb, outside an important and modern looking building.
Dean got up abruptly, overwhelmed with the urge to brush his teeth, his tongue, any part of him that had willingly and eagerly come in contact with that maniac’s jizz. His cheeks burned with shame, even though he was alone in his bathroom, and no one knew what he’d done.
Dean turned over then, so that they were facing each other. The earnestness in his expression made Cas’s chest ache with affection.
Out from under the shadow of the Tetons, Dean felt as though he could breathe again, as though he wouldn’t just not wake up in the morning and never learn why. He’d called Bobby as they crossed the state line into South Dakota, when Castiel had finally gone to sleep.
“I didn’t tell you to stop,” Daddy said, and Dean did as he was told, jerking off as quickly as possible, desperate to finish before things escalated.
Without another word, the Boss stood up, motioning for Dean to follow him. Back to the office, Dean supposed, hoping for another nap on the couch.
“This is exactly why I bought these ones,” Cas says, before going back in, this time licking at Dean’s entrance, swirling his tongue across the muscle.
Castiel fell silent, looking out across the night. A thought struck him.
“Good,” Dean stole a fry from Castiel’s plate, “I found a case.”
“Well,” Hannah said delicately, clearing her throat a little, “There are a number of specific things that the Boss has specified he would like to see you in, so we want to have them all on hand and ready for you to wear if he asks.”
Dean protests, huffing out a displeased sigh.
“He strikes me as the ‘lazy-but-talented’ type.”
Dean eases the paper open, and finds a sleek black box. He lifts the lid slowly, revealing a set of Ben Wa Anal Balls in varying sizes.
He felt hungry, unable to stop himself as he reached out, pulling Dean to him by his flannel. The space lessened to an inch or two and Cas wanted to devour him.
“Oh,” Cas said, shifting his duffle to the floor, watching as Dean walked over to him, “I like a guy with a nice smile.”
“How are you feeling?” she said, as they stood in the elevator.
“Well, when his highness wakes up, we’ll see if he can aim for shit.”
Cas took his time, like he said he would, pushing Dean’s shirt from his shoulders as they kissed. The tension built but it wasn’t urgent. They didn’t have anywhere to be, except right where they were.
“Wake up, Cassie! There’s fun to be had,” came a man’s voice, shattering the early morning quiet.
Dean had only just seen him on Monday morning, in the living room of their small rental place.
“The book said they feed in cycles.”
“Exactly, man.”
He thought about his dad, then.
“Sweet heart, I’ll show you the time of your life.”
“Get on the bed, please,” Cas says, watching Dean closely, “And take your clothes off.”
The goon laughed.
It was really, really small. And sparse. There was nothing but an empty desk with a chair on either side, and one large window that stretched from floor to ceiling. Thick-neck pushed him into the chair in front of the desk, as though this was some sort of waiting room. Dean looked over his shoulder, watching him step back outside and take up a place at the door. Guarding him.
“Also,” Dean started, “Speaking of bacon-cheese, the burger you made that night was amazing. Like, easily in the top five.”
He waved in return, parking and shutting off the ignition.
“You,” Dean pants, “I belong to you. My ass is yours, my cock. My pleasure. I want you to have it, want you to take it.”
“Cas,” Dean moaned against his cheek, the want in his voice palpable.
He pressed his lips to Dean’s, insistent and searing hot. Dean squeaked into his mouth as Daddy hauled him closer by grabbing his ass and squeezing it, fingers digging into the inflamed flesh beneath thin denim.
Daddy.
He presses his torso along Dean’s back, grinding into him as he reaches down into Dean’s new panties. He pulls Dean’s cock out, stroking it in time with his movements, slow and methodical. Dean’s moaning, panting hotly into the sheets as he takes everything Cas gives him. Cas tucks the lace waistband behind Dean’s balls, and and starts moving faster, twisting his wrist on the upstroke, his thighs smacking into Dean’s.
They headed further east, out of Rapid City until they hit the Missouri River, snaking alongside it for as long as they felt like, just because they could. Dean reasoned that they had time to waste before the Chupacabra would surface again. Ash settled into the back seat again, smoking a freshly rolled joint out the window, reminiscent of hours passed at the diner.
Dean decides he can get on board with whatever Cas is thinking.
Dean mulled that over, gazing out the window. Snow was falling again, just a light dusting, typical of February in the Midwest. He didn’t bother talking again, focusing instead on the traffic. Thick-neck drove like a bully, cutting people off and tail gating.
“Up on the table,” Helen said, gesturing without looking.
“Wow,” Dean said, shifting in his seat, not sure what to do other than to follow his stomach’s orders, “Waffles, I guess. With, uh, syrup. And chocolate chips. And berries on top. And some bacon and eggs. Eggs over-easy. And a big coffee.”
“Good boy,” Cas says, voice low as he watches Dean slides them slowly up his legs, settling them into place over his hardness, the cut out resting perfectly on the curves of his cheeks.
“Stop. Now,” Daddy continued, standing up, the heat of his body so close to Dean but not close enough, “I’ve seen all I needed to see. Get dressed please.”
He felt his boss do the same, and then suddenly they were pressed together, nothing but skin on skin, entirely bare. His boss hauled him in ever closer somehow, pulling Dean’s knee up over his hip, one of those incredible thighs nudging between his legs.
He could have been posing for a painting, legs stretched the width of the cab, with his torso resting on a love-seat of duffel bags, head loling back.
“F--Oh God, Cas, fuck me,” Dean begs, moaning, “Please!”
Dean rolled his eyes, resisting the urge to flip the guy off as he stepped out of the car.
“This is Helen, she’ll be taking care of your grooming today,” Hannah said, handing him off to a bored-looking middle aged woman in a pink apron.
The pressure abated for a moment, Dean knelt over him so they could both ease off their underwear. Cas could feel his heart racing but it didn’t register, his focus solely on Dean’s face hovering above his, his chest moving as his breath quickened.
“I’m gonna wake you up with a blow job,” Dean murmured into the dark.
He started fucking into his fist in earnest, the pleasure really building now, looking down at his boss from under hooded lids, his lips open as he panted a little.
“Nearly, dude. Hey, you feel like a soda?”
“Thank you,” Castiel said, chuckling, “It has been said in the past that were it not for Ash’s fry-cooking abilities, he would have been fired a long time ago.”
He thought about how Bobby was wrong, and that it made no difference to him if the car was empty or not, that silence was inevitable in the dead of night, no matter how many souls were around.
Cas redoubles his efforts, finding his second wind. Their torsos are pressed so close together, sweaty and hot, rubbing at Dean’s cock from both sides. He’s writhing beneath Cas, clutching him as he gets fucked into. One particularly well placed thrust and Dean can’t hold back any longer, coming hard, crying out as he spills across their skin, adding to the slick heat between their bodies.
“Fuck, you feel so good,” his Boss said, sinking in deep, pushing Dean as far down on his cock as he would go.
“Daddy..,” he croaked, his voice sounding as raw as he felt.
“Jerk yourself off,” Daddy said, his voice low and commanding, rough from what Dean hoped was desire.
“Good boy,” the man said, “Now that’s only for when we’re in private. If there are other employees around, you call me ‘Boss’, same as they do. Do you understand?”
“Alright, I’m beat. Let’s get an hour or two of shuteye before we go and see a man about a very big dog.” Dean said, laying back on the double bed to the left of Castiel’s.
“I’m kidding,” she said, “Mostly.”
Hannah just smiled at him.
Dean gaped at him.
“Let me just clean you up, then you can rest,” Daddy murmured to him, his touch gentle and caring. It did weird things to Dean’s gut.
“I know that it’s the spirit of some little kid who disappeared in the vicinity of the town well, so three guesses as to what happened.”
“Well we might have to amend any future punishments. You won’t learn anything if you’re having a good time.”
“You know I did,” Dean said, pushing back into Daddy’s hands, enjoying the soothing touch.
“That doesn’t sound like my problem,” his Boss said, frowning back at him.
“You won’t die, I’ll be right there.”
“Well, wait until I take you to the Mississippi, she’s even better.  Maybe one day we could drive it, right from top to bottom. Get to Louisiana in time for Mardi Gras.”
“They can wait,” Dean says, “It’s my birthday.”
“I, uh,” Dean floundered, “I don’t know. Is there a menu or something?”
Cas eats him out until he’s dripping with it, thighs tense against Cas’s hair, feeling loose and open as that magic tongue flicks in and out of him.
“What do you think?” Dean snapped. Yesterday he’d thought about opening a savings account. Today he apparently owed some loan shark one-fifty large because his piece-of-shit father was being a piece of shit again. Sometimes life liked to kick you while you were down.
“Not a problem. We’ll get some pumpkins and you can ventilate ‘em until you know how to not miss, and then you’ll be fine.”
Dean’s stomach fluttered, his dick fully hard now as his mind raced ahead of him, imagining Daddy dragging him to the bedroom and dealing to him—would he have to kneel on the bed? The floor? Maybe he’d have to bend over again, and hold posture. Maybe Daddy would tie him up and take to him with a paddle. Maybe he’d do it right here on the couch. Anything, Dean would take any of them.
“Loud and clear” Said Ash, blowing smoke rings out the open window and watching them swirl into nothing as the wind rushed past.
“Dean, we have to get up,” Cas says, rutting a little more insistently, “We’ve got breakfast with your parents.”
His Other Option smiled at him. It wasn’t menacing, but it wasn’t exactly friendly either. He smiled like he was laughing at Dean.
“Oh, cool. Just I heard Castiel here shouting like a little bitch, so I figured I’d come and save your asses.”
“I liked..,” Dean struggled to say it, “I liked you in my mouth.”
“In case of what? I wouldn’t know how to use one.”
“Fuck,” He says, collapsing on top of Dean, cock still buried deep.
There's sexy bits, there's inner turmoil, what more could a chapter need!
“...Yeah.”
“Then I don’t see a problem,” his Other Option said, still considering Dean with a twinkle in his eye.
And so it was—the neon sign confirmed it. They didn’t end up staying for long, Dean leaning on the bar and talking with a woman who had a hard mouth and soft eyes.
“Turn,” was all Daddy said, assessing Dean’s body.
I didn't do an Advanced Reader Copy for this chapter bc it's not even sexy, but Chapter Three will have an ARC so! lemme know if ur interested and I'll pick someone to share it with once it's written.
Dean rolled his eyes to the right.
The clock behind the counter told him it was twenty to one, and he rolled his shoulders as he approached it. The cashier pushed a laminated menu towards him, and he didn’t touch it because he’d already seen the words “burger” and “bacon” and no longer had any use for a menu.
Another sharp slap rang out, piercing the stillness of the room, and Dean gasped again. Daddy was not pulling his punches, not in the slightest. Another blow came, and Dean lurched forward, clinging onto the table for dear life, his cock trapped between his body and the wood beneath him.
“Ash can have a hamburger.”
“Do I have to clean that up too?” Dean asked, mostly joking.
He loved his shower. The water pressure was beyond anything he’d ever experienced, and it felt good against his muscles, easing some of the tension in his body. He scrubbed himself clean, using probably way too much of all the expensive products lined up on the shelf, wanting to take as long as possible. He’d be lying to himself if he said he didn’t hope that his boss would come looking for him, and join him in the shower.
“Hello, Daddy,” he said,
He looked down between their bodies, to see Dean’s length moving alongside his own. He took a moment to commit it to memory, sure in the knowledge that it was the most erotic thing he’d ever seen.
Dean and some co-workers getting ready for his first day on the job.
Dean hesitated, wanting to change out of his pajamas, but knowing very well what would happen if ‘Boss’s orders’ weren’t followed.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” Dean groaned.
“Daddy,” Dean moaned breathily, not caring how he sounded in that moment, just knowing that he needed Daddy to keep going, to hold him close and come on him, use him like he was supposed to. Hearing Daddy’s deep voice, his noises of pleasure, but not being able to see him was hotter than Dean expected, but he still wanted to turn and see Daddy’s face, to confirm that he was feeling good.
“Nearly twelve. I got you breakfast.”
“Uh, number two. Extra fries.”
“Thank the lord in heaven above.” Ash said, his drool collecting in the crevice of Castiel’s elbow.
“See anything you like?” Dean asked quietly, picking up the pace, so hard it hurt and dribbling pre-come all down his length. The glide was smooth and slick now, and Dean could feel the tension in his gut, the stirrings of an orgasm just beginning to build.
“Whatever he wants,” Boss said, already reading the newspaper.
“These were an excellent choice,” Daddy said, massaging his ass cheeks with strong, firm hands, “I’m very pleased.”
“How are you today?” his Boss asked.
The shorts were still hooked around one ankle, and Daddy helped to pull them back into place. Dean was just tying the belt on the robe when there was a knock at the front door, a pause, and then the sound of someone turning the knob.
“I liked,” Dean steeled himself to say it, “I liked being down there, being used.”
Dean hurried to straighten his clothes before leaving his room to greet Castiel. He wasn’t sure what mood his boss would be in, and wanted to follow orders as best he could to avoid pissing him off again.
“I guess.” Castiel said, scratching dried a spot ketchup off the countertop out of habit.
Dean focused on keeping a quiet as he could, holding still and doing the job he’d been given. Eventually he felt the tension leave his shoulders, blind-panic clearing as he tuned out the muffled drone of the meeting going on above him.
When he got no answer, he put his hands out in front of him and began walking slowly. Just as he started to wonder how big this room was, he bumped into something soft, knees pressing into what had to be a mattress. He turned and sat down to wait, figuring that he hadn’t been told not to, so why not take the liberty.
“Castiel.”
Dean groaned. Up on his knees? What in the hell for?
“I’m not! Really, I just feel like I owe them, you know? They helped nail the freak, and then skipped town, no questions asked.”
“I don’t know where they’re going, Bobby, and neither do they.” He’d said.
“I’m sorry to leave you,” Castiel said, pressing a kiss to Dean’s lips, “I’d much rather be here. I wanted to take you upstairs to my living quarters, keep you all to myself.” He sighed, leaning in to kiss Dean again, deep and slow.
“No, man. The Ring is some major B.S. Video tape ghost who phones you? Come on.”
“Well now, who’s causing trouble?” He drawled, not knowing the danger of the situation, “You looking for a fight, buddy?”
Dean watched as his boss got up, pulling a thick robe from the closet and shrugging into it. He picked up the black bag from the foot of the bed and tossed it in Dean’s direction without a glance, before leaving the room and shutting the door loudly behind him.
“And later on Cas, I’m taking you out shooting.”
Taking Dean’s cock in his hand instantly made it to the top five best moments of Cas’s life. It was pretty, flushed pink at the tip, and in proportion with the rest of Dean. He thought of all the things he might do with Dean’s dick in the future, and squeezed their dicks together in his palm.
Dean watched as she pulled out her phone and took a photo of him. He blinked his eyes, trying to get rid of the shadow in his vision that the flash had left behind. Hannah was typing something, her thumbs moving at lightning speed, her entire focus on the screen as it lit up her face.
Dean was on edge. He’d been delivered to the office building on the dot of eight o'clock, and had been waiting ever since. There were no instructions to follow, and no one to ask what he should do. He wished he had Hannah’s contact details.
Dean whined a little, the words overwhelming him. He felt Daddy’s other hand move beneath him, between him and the couch, and groaned loudly as Daddy pinched his left nipple, rolling it between two fingers.
Castiel wasn’t sure if he meant drug stash or food stash, and he didn’t bother asking.
Cas leaned against the counter and waited.
They declined April’s offer of a cooked breakfast, feeling sick in their souls after smelling burnt meat all night. The moment they got back to the motel, Castiel stripped off his dirty, sooty clothes and climbed into bed, lying down on his front.
He was vaguely aware of being licked clean, his panties pulled back into place, before he was tugged down into a straddle on Daddy’s lap, boneless and heavy as he leaned into this strange man that might have just sucked his brains out through his dick.
“Now,” Daddy said, his voice taking on a steely tone.
“Which part did you like?” his Boss asked, “Tell me.”
Dean nodded, fully committed to the task of making his boss feel better. He watched as his boss moved away from him, beginning to get undressed. First his shirt, then his pants, off and into a hamper by the door to what Dean assumed was an ensuite. He itched with the need to get his hands on the miles of tan skin that was newly exposed. His boss was kinda stacked, Dean realized; sturdy shoulders and thick thighs, broad chested with muscular arms. He couldn’t look away.
“You ready for the weekend?”
Although, the guy did seem a little unhinged. Maybe he wouldn’t care if Dean died, knowing John had another son if he got bored of the first. The thought made Dean sick. He’d need to figure out a way to make himself indispensable.
“Sure,” Hannah said, “But if you don’t actually work for the company, then the loan will accrue interest. You’d owe more and more every month until the debt was doubled and then we’d have to smash your skull in.”
“It’s past midnight. I’m willing to bet most bars would be a mess right about now.”
“I may have something for you,” she said, “Sit still for a moment.”
He moved his hands onto Dean’s chest, fingers running across the soft fabric of his t-shirt. Dean’s hands were at his hips, unsure of themselves. It was so sweet, and so at odds with Dean’s confident demeanor that Cas couldn’t wait any longer.
“Well that leaves us in a bit of a predicament,” the man said, a small frown on his face, “Because I like to be called ‘Sir’, you see. But if your daddy makes you call him ‘Sir’, then I guess I have no option but to make you call me daddy.”
“Borrowed cash from a loan shark, huh?” Dean said, feeling bitter, “Sounds like his problem.”
Dean put the gifts in a pile on the dresser, and then kicks off his socks and shoes, hands going to the hem of his shirt.
He could sell some stuff, he supposed. Not his car—never the car, but he had a few things lying around that he could do without. Like the television, or whichever kitchen appliances weren’t nailed down, if it came to that.
If they were alone.
She introduced herself as the widowed April Bushel. Dean asked her about times and dates and places, walking with her out into the pastures to survey animal tracks and damaged fences. He said he felt he could handle her problem. She said he looked nice in a suit. He accepted her offer of fresh lemonade, before promising to return that evening with his colleagues - and every evening after that - until they got the beast. Then he bid her farewell and drove back to town.
“Do you think you’ll get it tonight?” Castiel whispered next to him, hip to hip in the dark.
Dean’s kneecaps may be at this man’s mercy, but in that moment, he felt powerful.
Dean’s jaw clenched before he could stop it.
“Bobby, hi.” He said when Bobby picked up the phone.
Hello, welcome to the long awaited Crime Boss AU!
He felt the laugh rumble through Daddy’s chest, and a kiss against his shoulder, and then he was drifting off to sleep.
It felt good, to be touched, not only gently but at all, by firm hands that delivered pain which had crossed over into pleasure. The stinging started to feel good. Dean's eyes were watering but he wanted more.
“Genesis Enterprises,” the thug said, as if that was supposed to mean anything to Dean.
He places his hand in Dean’s lap, trailing his fingers across the denim.
“Hey can we roll up the windows? All the good stuff’s getting out.”
Meaning that Dean was alone with the Boss again.
“No, I’m sorry,” Dean said, breathing harder from the pain, “I’ll uh, I’ll try harder Daddy, I promise.”
“Well shit. No more weed on the job for you.”
“Should I leave you two alone for a bit, or...?”
Daddy sighed against Dean’s mouth, kissing him one last time before getting up and checking his message.
Dean had just been standing quietly, wiping glasses down when one of the thugs, wearing a crisp black suit with a tie that looked tight enough to choke him, had come up to the bar, beckoning Dean over.
“How much were you paid previously?” his Boss asked, looking down at the contract.
It was a Tuesday night and Dean was in the backseat of a black SUV—a Rolls Royce, with tinted windows and a mini-fridge. The doors were locked and he couldn’t see a button to unlock them again, not that he’d try to if he found one. There was a stocky, bald-headed man in the driver's seat, with a similar looking guy riding shotgun. There was another goon in the back next to him, sitting quietly and staring straight ahead. What a boring job, Dean thought.
“I bet it’s a sight to see. Although, we’ll have to move through rapidly.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, letting out the breath he’d been holding, “Daddy,” he added hastily, not wanting to make tomorrow any worse.
“Get off me,” Dean says, smiling despite himself.
“I liked that a lot,” he said, his face soft and his smile sweet.
“Oh,” Dean said, not wanting to think about what that could mean.
They were just in the process of stuffing him into a dressing room with some sample suits to try on, when the bell above the front door chimed.
“Fine,” he said finally, stuffing his feet into his boots before grabbing his wallet and a jacket.
“Head out to Jackson, if we go through the mountains it’s a one road deal and we could get trapped. Out east, we’ll have more paths to choose from, with fewer cops chasing us.” Ash said, his joint back in his hand somehow.
“At least let me get you a gun, just in case.”
Daddy stared at him a little, watching him as Dean caught his breath, trying not to touch himself.
“I’d like to,” Cas replied, just as uncertain, “If that’s okay with you.”
Dean watched the headlights of the cars on the other side of the median, streaming past him, coming from Chicago back to Milwaukee. He sighed. A trip into the city this late at night was going to be a bitch to deal with tomorrow. Dean figured he wouldn’t get back until close to four at this rate. Although it wasn’t like he had much of a choice.
Dean laughs, turning back to the gift pile. He unwraps some nipple clamps, a set of butt plugs, a new paddle, a cock ring engraved with ‘Pretty Boy’, and a fairly hefty vibrator.
“Don’t know ‘em,” Dean said, holding steady eye contact.
Eventually they were snaking through the streets of downtown Chicago, and Dean felt himself shrink down in his seat, despite the heavily tinted windows, as they passed a university building. He didn’t know if it was specifically Sam’s building, or if it even belonged to Sam’s school but shame curled in his gut all the same. He’d known straight away that he couldn’t tell his brother about this, about covering for their father yet again, about getting naked for money to cover for him, which was new.
“That’s too bad. Don’t you want to come open your presents?” Cas says, trying to coax a reaction from Dean.
“Not yet,” Cas replies, peppering his shoulder with kisses, “I’m not finished with you.”
He had his head tipped back in pleasure, eyes falling shut as he jacked his dick, and then Daddy squeezed him again, hard, and that was all it took before Dean came, spurting his release all over his own chest. He stroked himself through it, tipping his head down to look at Daddy, just in time to see him move forward and lick a stripe right through Dean’s come.
“Your father, your family, borrowed money from one of my subsidiaries, a member of my family,” his Boss finally said, “He was given four months to begin scheduled payments, all of which he missed. That means that the debt comes back to me to collect, in the same way it comes back to you to pay.”
“No.”
“Good,” Dean said, flipping the tomb open to the right page, “Then read this bit on Chupacabras and how to fuck them up.”
“Tell me,” Daddy said, his voice demanding, squeezing Dean’s dick a little, almost like a threat.
“Among other things,” he said, “More specifically, I’m looking for someone who can do as they’re told.”
So he was fired from his real job, and his only income was soon to be from whatever this maniac in Chicago was going to have him doing.
“Sorry if we kept you,” Dean said, although there was nothing he could have done about it.
were the words he’d used as he tried to explain, mumbling and not looking Dean in the eye as he moved hastily around the room.
“Uh,” Dean hesitated, “Well no one was around so I just went looking. Sorry if I wasn’t supposed to.”
“You’re cute,” Cas says, shuffling over on the bench seat, “Just trust me.”
“How come?” Dean asked.
“I could organize a time-out,” his boss said, musing it over, “But it would be slightly different than what you’re probably thinking.
“We’re pretty close to the Montana State Line. Want to go north?” Dean said into the depth of his chip bag.
“Yes, what?” the man said.
“Mm.”
“Well, Castiel, where are you headed?”
,” he thought, “
“No, no one’s been here except you. I figured I was being left to my own devices,” Dean said. All at once, the man in front of him changed, his jaw clenching and his look turning hard and cold. “Sorry,” Dean said quickly, wanting to avoid the same wrath that left bruise marks on his throat that very morning, “I just didn’t know who to call, or even how to.”
“You’re so hot,” Dean said, his lips against Cas’s ear. Kisses against his neck had Cas clinging to Dean for dear life.
His food arrived quickly, and it was warm, and Dean was so grateful that he left his last seventy cents on the table for the cashier and his heavenly fry cook.
“I’m ready to head off now,” Dean said, unsure if he was supposed to say goodbye or not.
Castiel dropped the body, grabbing at Dean as he ran for the door. Ash jumped back over the counter. More people screamed.
“A clinic?” Dean asked, “What, am I getting a physical?”
A huge bathtub with jets took up most of the far wall. There was a walk-in shower with glass walls and a small wooden bench. The sink was incredible, large and rectangular, set into a big marble countertop with gleaming copper fixtures. He could see the lotions and scrubs Helen had given him the day before all lined up on the counter, ready for him to keep his skin smooth and soft and inviting.
“I don’t know about that. One of ‘em saw monster teeth and didn’t crap his pants, the other has a big computer and a mean right hook.”
Castiel broke the silence, a quiet murmur shared between them in the darkness.
His face stung, and Dean felt like sulking. He was just trying to avoid getting spit everywhere, but if the Boss wanted a drooling mess in his pants, then a drooling mess he would get.
“But seriously though, we gotta go to Bad Wound.”
“Yes Daddy,” Dean nodded, scanning over the first page of the contract.
He really liked those hands on him.
“Awesome.” Ash said, lighting up and breathing deep.
Dean gathered his things, including the new phone and it’s charger, before walking to Castiel’s office. The door was open, but he stopped at the entrance anyway, knocking cautiously on the wood.
“Yes,” Hannah smiled, seemingly pleased at Dean’s attitude, “Despite the circumstances surrounding your employment, he’s always made sure to treat us well. I’m sure that will include you.”
In it’s sign, it’s window, in everything about it, if he was honest.
“Yes,” the man replied, looking at Dean so intently that a shiver went down his spine, “I do have an... opening, of sorts. A position within my personal staff that I would very much like to fill.”
Dean was right, as it turned out, he was getting a physical. And a full STD panel, which he felt stupid for not piecing together until the moment the doctor had his dick in hand.
“Mm,” Cas hums, “I’m glad you liked it, my pretty little fuck toy.”
“Yeah, and the last goat was drained five weeks ago. It should surface soon.”
“I don’t like being teased,” Daddy said, “I like getting what I want when I ask for it.”
It took him a moment before he could think clearly again, while the strange man in question pressed soft kisses to the bruising on his throat.
Dean probably looked longer than was safe, before turning back to the road ahead.
Dean took his eyes off the road for a minute, and turned to look at the man riding shotgun, who had his chin resting on his knee, his gaze piercing into Dean.
“Hello,” Castiel replied, pressing kisses to the nape of Dean’s neck. It was nice, and surprisingly gentle. “I’ve been thinking about you all evening.”
“Sure, if you want to,” Dean smiled, “Give you an excuse to play FBI.”
“I guess we’re coming with you, to Santa Fe,” Castiel said, unsure of himself, “Will it be a long drive?”
“Here you go,” came a voice from beside them, a young blonde girl with a white apron around her waist. She handed Ash a beer, her fingers marred the condensation on the glass.
Castiel got up, stretching.
“I was on minimum wage,” Dean stated, “Plus tips. ...Daddy.”
Dean and Cas shared a look.
“Mom?” He said back into the air, willing his words to get to her.
Ash leapt over the counter and punched the Crocotta twice in the gut and once in the face, before helping the Cashier get a grip on it.
“Honey, if we start now, we’ll never stop,” Cas says, and he presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek before moving away.
Dean was woken up at the crack of six-thirty by his phone ringing, loudly, on the mattress next to his head.
“No,” the goon said, “Get your shoes on, we’re going now. Boss’s orders.”
Dean followed, lifting up the soft covers and sliding beneath them, scooting closer to the middle of the bed as his boss pulled him in. A strong hand slid up under his t-shirt, and Dean helped to tug it off over his head, tossed somewhere behind him.
“I could kill you,” Daddy said, just as quiet, “But I’m not going to. Remember that.”
Cas tuned out the rest of the conversation, choosing instead to focus on Dean, the line of his shoulders in his too-big leather jacket. The bend in his legs, and the way he tapped the tip of his boot against the floor while his other leg took all his weight.
“Good,” Daddy said, once he’d finished, letting him stand up straight again, “I have to do some work now. Let’s go.”
Cas wastes no more time, removing his fingers and swiftly replacing them with his cock, fucking into Dean at a brutal pace. Dean’s crying out below him, just about writhing in the sheets, his fists clenched.
He heads out of the room, leaving Dean to gather up his stack of presents.
He places the box to the side and reaches for the next one. It’s got a ribbon on it, the package soft and squishy. He looks at Cas, but his face isn’t giving anything away.
Underwear. Women’s underwear. Silk and lace and satin, all colours and cuts. They were in his wardrobe, so they must be for him. He opened all the other drawers as quickly as he could, but the panties were the only underwear he could find. It was them or nothing.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” He says shyly, “I, uhh--" He swallows thickly, "I really like them.”
“Yep. I remembered how disgusting you were the last time you ate one, and figured you probably liked it.” Dean said, his tone friendly.
“Yeah buddy, you’re gonna have to shoot the gun.”
he’d wanted to say, but didn’t. In reality, Dean was nearly twenty-six years old and should be able to make decisions for himself. If he couldn’t say ‘no’ when his father suggested they up and move cities to be close to Sam, that was on him and he knew it.
He stepped back into the foyer at two minutes to eight, the marble tile cold on his bare feet. He had no idea where the dining room was so he just sat and waited on the low padded bench that was pushed against the wall beside his door.
But he kept driving.
“Sure.” Dean said, before continuing sheepishly, “And, uh... Staking vampires is actually just a myth. You gotta, um, slice the head off.”
“Will I be allowed my phone? I need to be available to my brother, just in case,” Dean explained, hoping that his Boss would be merciful after his little outburst.
“You want me to be a thug?” he asked, “You want me to shake down desperate people for money they don’t have?”
“You have a lovely smile,” he said, entirely by accident. He’d been watching Dean flirt with the desk clerk, trying to get them a nicer room. He’d turned to wink at Cas and Cas was suddenly breathless.
Daddy let out a groan then, burying his face against Dean’s neck. He reached between them and wrapped one of his strong hands around both of their cocks, fucking into the tunnel of his fist, his thrusts jostling Dean until Dean was shoving into his hand too. It wasn’t long before their rhythm faltered, faster and sloppier as they got closer to the edge. Daddy’s hand was squeezing them a little, his fingers rubbing over their sensitive heads and Dean felt himself pull tight and then snap, moaning loud and open mouthed as his come spurted out against his skin, dribbling over Daddy’s fist.
“Okay,” was all he managed to say, not meeting Daddy’s eye.
“Sounds like a plan.” He said.
He smiled at Dean. It wasn’t friendly.
“Fuck off and get in the car.”
“I mean don’t actually do that, but I understand the appeal.” Dean says, setting the package carefully on top of the Ben Wa box.
“You’re not going to eat?” Castiel asked.
He looked at Cas again, who was burning a hole in the side of his head. He’d acted pretty quickly under pressure, seeing razor teeth and still jumping willingly into the fray. Dean felt vaguely impressed.
“For real?”
“I know what I think, I want to hear what you think,” his boss replied calmly.
“Rushmore it is,” He said eventually, “The more rapidly we get there, the better.”
He yelped in surprise as a sharp slap landed against his cheek.
“That will be Hannah,” Castiel said, his voice all business again, jarring Dean from the soft, sensual moment they’d just shared.
The man sat down opposite him, on an expensive looking square ottoman that was large enough to seat four people.
Dean shrugs.
He wasn’t sure how long it was before the car slowed and finally came to a stop. His footsteps echoed, so he must have been in some kind of garage. The goon wasn’t very helpful as he led Dean through a series of hallways and stumbling up a set of stairs before shoving him into a room.
“Do I look stupid?” The guy responded quickly, looking to his friend, “Ash, grab our shit from the back. I’ll meet you at the end of the street.”
“Hello,” Dean managed to say back.
Hannah leaned back in her chair, considering him for a moment.
“I want you to be a good boy, Dean,” he said softly,his fingers brushing through Dean’s hair so lightly that it was almost imperceptible, “Will you do that for me?”
“There you go. Now shut your mouth as well, you’re keeping me awake.”
And it was; Hannah stepped quietly into the foyer and shut the door behind her with a sharp click.
“No.” Castiel growled back, “Sleeping.”
The garage door in front of them started lifting up, and Dean took a deep breath as they entered the bowels of the building. Into the belly of the beast, he thought to himself. Whatever that meant. Maybe they were going to kill him, although that wouldn’t get anybody their money back. Hopefully whoever this mafia-wannabe asshole was, he’d let Dean work out a payment plan. He remembered what his uncle Bobby had told him—hope for the best; prepare for the worst.
She talked him through post-wax care, and pressed a bag full of lotions and scrubs into his hands.
“‘Shit’ is right.”
“Okay,” Dean said, trying to cover the mess in his lap as casually as possible, “Do you want me to stay, or...?”
It was clear that the Crocotta was heading into town, to try and find a crowd who would bear witness to Dean’s murderous rampage. Baring his teeth, the Crocotta headed to the broken-light-diner, growling. Dean sighed, and followed him in. Taking a quick glance around, he noted two families at the tables to his left, two men and a woman sitting at the counter, and a group of bingo players behind him to his right.
"Fuck,” he replied eloquently. Dean eased him back onto the bed, separating them for a moment so they could lay back on the pillows, instead of half-hanging off the edge.
Dean pulled at his shoulders, until Daddy was laying on top of him, their bodies pressed together tightly. He kissed Daddy’s neck, laving his tongue over the skin there until Daddy took him by the jaw and forced him to meet his mouth. Dean felt a thrill run through him as he tasted himself on Daddy’s tongue, salty and tart.
“Yes, Daddy,” Dean murmured, aware that this man had probably never been told no in his life.
“Good,” Cas says, pressing in for another kiss, “But keep going.”
“Know anything about Santa Fe?” he asked.
“Are those all for me, babe?” He asks, concerned, “That’s too much! You already put money in with my parents for our vacation...”
Dean had finished showering, put in a load of laundry, and was just doing one last wipe-down of the countertops by the time the knock came at his door.
“And what do you do to it?”
“Very. But I knew you’d be here waiting when I got back, so I had good reason to get everything done quickly,” Castiel said, his fingertips ghosting along Dean’s sides. It nearly tickled.
I'm hoping for the gap between this chapter and the next to be at least eight times shorter, but we'll see how I do. Thanks again! x
“As long as you’ll have me,” Cas replied, effectively ripping his heart out and nailing it to his sleeve.
Castiel was running so fast he didn’t hear, nearly crashed into the car’s massive rear end. His fingers shook as he reached the passenger side door, grasping for the handle in the dark. He heard the fumble of keys, and then the door was unlocked. He slid into the car in unison with the stranger he had just helped commit a murder. The car roared to life and was put in gear.
“Next to nothing, probably.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, trying to keep his manners.
“A creature of habit.”
Daddy nodded once, his eyes focused once again on Dean’s dick, waiting for him to take it in hand.
Castiel went to wake the fry cook and Dean sat at a table by the window, looking out into the quiet of the night - he’d been right when he thought he’d find it here.
Dean rocked against him harder, like he was emboldened by Cas’s words. Cas clung to him, feeling like a small boat in a vast sea, succumbing to each wave of pleasure as it overtook him. They were flushed and sweating, moving insistently as the pressure built inside them.
“...Right.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, treating him to another smile, lighting up his face, the room, Cas’s whole world, “You have nice eyes.”
“Yes,” his boss smiled a little, his eyes twinkling with it, “It would be sexual in nature.”
At ten past nine, Dean gave up waiting. He figured that if Castiel wanted to see him, he’d be here to see him. He retired to the small powder room that was his own, eager to shower and change his clothes.
“That’s enough,” Daddy said.
Dean nods, and lets Cas push him down on the bed, on his back. Cas lays down on top of him, a mirror of this morning, and trails soft kisses along his collarbone and up Dean’s neck.
They walked back down the labyrinth-cum-hallway, the thugs following along behind, before stepping into the elevator once again. This time, Hannah pushed the button for the forty-ninth floor. Of course they’d have to go up even higher.
“Who’s askin’?” Dean answered, polishing a glass as he squared his shoulders, ready to stare the guy down if need be.
“Bacon and cheese make you classy?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, a little lost in the man’s eyes.
“John Winchester owes us money,” the thug said, “But we learned that he’s left town. That means you owe us money.”
Castiel sat up on his elbows.
“Sure. So why’d your folks move to Wyoming?”
Dean said nothing as his father walked out the door without so much as a glance in his direction.
“Morning,” Dean replied, “Did you sleep okay?”
“So... I’m sucking dick for eight twenty-five an hour?” Dean asked, not quite believing what he was hearing.
“Pants off,” Helen said, turning her stiff gaze back to him, “I can’t wax you through your jeans,” she said, as though this was plainly obvious and Dean must be a little slow on the uptake.
His hands dropped to unbuckle his belt, opening it slowly, his movements like molasses. His boss seemed to like it, his posture unchanged, but his eyes glued to Dean’s every movement. Like he was trying to appear unaffected. The hunger in his gaze gave him away.
“Shit” Dean muttered to himself.
Dean was glad his panties were covering his dick as he felt more precome drool from the tip. It had got him into enough trouble as it was. His own breathing felt ragged as he moved his face, his mouth brushing the streak of semen, letting it smear across his lips before he started licking it up in earnest. It was salty and cooling off, which made him work quickly, wanting to get it while it was hot, as it were.
“Listen, I have some work to do, and then I have to go out for a few meetings. I won’t be back until late. If you stay here, I’ll never get anything done.”
“What else are we doing today?” Dean asked her, feeling out of his depth.
Dean thought back to the previous night, blushing when he remembered the way his new Boss had watched him touch himself. He felt weird about it, and felt even weirder that his dick was onboard with the idea of seeing his new boss again today.
“Sometimes,” Dean said, not turning to look at the man.
It didn’t take long, and then he swiped the come off his chin and slowly sucked it from his fingers, still bent over and still hard in his pants.
Castiel decided to put up rather than shut up, rolling his eyes as the spikes of Ash’s mullet dug into his neck.
“No, I guess not.” Ash said, looking back at his friend.
“Hmm,” Cas says, “I think I might throw out all your other underwear and have you only wear these.”
“What about Gayville?”
“Perfect,” his Boss said, making a note on the contract, “You’ll be fine carrying on with that then.”
“Sure.”
He rested there for a moment, waiting for the inevitable, already unsure of how long he’d been without his senses. Surely not more than a minute, at most.
“Seeing as it’s your first day, I’ll just tell you what we’re going to do,” the Boss said, taking mercy on him, “We’re going to finish our breakfast, and once the plates are all cleared away, I’m going to bend you over this table and spank you until I feel that you’ve truly learned your lesson.”
“Dunno,” John replied, barely more than a grunt.
“Yeah, well we know you. You owe us money,” the man replied, staring right back.
“We have to get Ash.” Castiel panted.
“Maybe I’ll get a hamburger to eat at breakfast.”
“Any time, Dean. I love you,” Cas mumbles.
He dreamed of his mother.
“There,” Daddy said, sounding a little breathless, “Do you have anything to say for yourself?”
“What time is it?” Castiel asked from where he lay, his face half pressed into the pillow.
“Yes,” he said bluntly, not wanting to explain that he sometimes drove five hours to Boise just to get a blowjob from a stranger he met in a gay bar, “Have you?”
Daddy looked down between their bodies, at where Dean’s snail trail disappeared into his underwear.
“You never been camping though, man.”
“I’ll clean up, babe. You’ve made a mess of my gift, but you’ve earned a break.”
Dean swallows thickly, stepping out of his jeans to stand naked in front of Cas.
Daddy must have tucked them into his panties just before he left. That was a four hundred per cent tip.
“I think I will,” Ash said, and he did.
“And miss out on seeing a real ghost? Are you kidding?”
“Hey, where are you taking me?” he asked, fantasy forgotten as he realized he hadn’t put much effort into double checking the identity of the man who’d come to collect him.
He slid on a pair of lounge pants and a t-shirt, both soft cotton that felt more expensive than anything he’d ever worn before.
Dean’s head felt fuzzy, but he bent over again at his Daddy’s will, until the tip of his nose touched the sticky wetness.
“Fuck off,” Cas said, rolling eyes as he pulled Dean closer, “Behave yourself.”
Dean nodded, not that his Boss saw him, and turned to leave.
“That’s my good boy,” Cas says, “You’re so good at getting fucked.”
“Of course,” Isaiah said, motioning to move back through the door.
“No,” Dean said, feigning seriousness, “A creature who has eaten a bacon cheeseburger before. I mean, come on. It doesn’t get much better.”
“Well, all of it,” his Boss replied, “We’ll take the eight twenty-five, you can keep whatever tips you make.”
It didn’t take them long to get there, and Dean was led down a much shorter hallway, this one furnished much more like an expensive apartment building than an expensive office. They came to a stop outside a pair of exquisitely carved double doors, made of a heavy dark wood.
“What about you?” Dean said, his brain still a little foggy from what was a surprisingly good blow job.
It didn’t take much more than that, a few more teasing words before Dean was spilling, his come smearing on Cas’s hand and the skin of his stomach. Cas watched him, his gaze gentle as Dean’s brain came back online.
Dean sat there in his Boss’s bed, naked and rubbing at his sore neck as he tried to take stock of what had just happened. Of all the names he imagined his boss having, Castiel wasn’t one of them.
“My father’s debt problem,” Dean interjected.
“Wha—?” Dean’s hand slowed, but didn’t stop.
Dean shrugged.
Dean's first official day on the job.
“You enjoyed your punishment?” Daddy asked, his voice teasing.
“Of course,” Cas says, pulling Dean against him, places kisses on his neck.
It was dead quiet, the newspaper and the smooth jazz long-since abandoned. Dean could hear his own breathing, his heartbeat, both loud inside his body. He felt his boss, nudging his legs wider with one knee. He felt warm skin along his lower back, and then his lounge pants were tugged down over his butt in one swift movement.
Castiel sprinted down the road, his breath stuck in his throat. He could hear the guy behind him, keeping pace.
“Yes,” he said, heat rising within him as he fell more under the man's spell.
“Bye Daddy,” Dean said, turning to leave. He was all mixed up. Couldn’t tell if he was angry or not, or if he was supposed to be.
“I—,” Dean was hyper aware of his reddened, sensitive crotch, “Helen—the waxer, she said not to touch the skin while it was inflamed, or it could get, uh, an ingrown hair or something.”
“Good,” the Boss said, turning back to his food, reading the newspaper as though what he’d just said was entirely normal.
Finally, after what felt like eons, he felt the shuffle of feet again, muffled noises fading away as people left the room. Finally, the door swung shut.
“Hah hah, real funny.”
“I guess not. You pack all your worldly possessions?”
Daddy settled into place, straddling Dean’s thighs and holding him in place with both of his warm hands at Dean’s waist. Dean’s own hands clutched at the cushion in front of him, the anticipation becoming too much. Daddy leaned down over him, and Dean inhaled sharply as he felt the heft of a warm, thick cock settle between his cheeks. He started slowly, long measured thrusts against Dean’s ass, the thong keeping Daddys cock from brushing right against Dean’s hole—which seemed like a huge loss.
“That’s right,” Dean says, breathing hard as Cas fucks him, his cock trapped between their stomachs, “Yours to use.”
“Never mind that, buddy. Why did you, huh? How did you land there? Maybe you’re already running from the police.”
There’s a sizable stack of gifts on the coffee table, and Dean immediately feels guilty.
“Yeah, and you don’t have a leg to stand on.” Dean said, grinning wider as he swung the steering wheel, pulling back onto the interstate that would carry them through the northern edge of Rapid City.
“You see Dean,” the guy said, “It’s very much your problem, because my boss wants what he’s owed. And if you refuse to take ownership, to be a man and deal with your responsibilities, we can make this your brother’s problem.”
He woke up warm and content, his body curved around Dean’s. They’d cleaned off and climbed under the covers almost straight away, both road-weary and then physically tired out.
“You really are lovely,” his boss said, rubbing firmly over his cheeks, grabbing a handful of his ass and squeezing.
They must be about the same height, Dean thought, but his Other Option seemed so imposing. He had dark hair and bright eyes, blue like the sky as dusk settles. He wore a suit, a nice one, and while it hid the finer points of his figure, Dean could tell that this guy was stacked.
“I fucking hate this, and we didn’t even see a ghost,” Ash said, his face screwed up—probably because of the smell, Cas thought. The kid they torched had been dead for a little over a decade, but the stink of burning remains was awful no matter how old the body, Dean assured them.
“I want to see you naked.”
Dean walked over to him, embarrassed to be wearing his own clothes in front of his boss. He’d spent the day in silks and lace and now he was in old Walmart pajamas and an army surplus jacket. Castiel didn’t seem to care though, reaching out for him and drawing him into an embrace, those strong hands warm against Dean’s hips.
Dean saw his chance and took it, plunging his knife deep into the back of it’s neck.
Dean felt like the bottom of his stomach had dropped out. That explained his father’s hasty exit then.
hehhhehehhe i figured out the 'Daddy' problem!
Dean sat back, his skin flushed and shining with sweat, looming over Cas who was still achingly hard.
“Hello?” he called out, just to be sure.
The front doors creaked open at exactly eight o’clock, and in walked his boss.
“Yeah? Who’s your boss?” Dean asked, switching the shined glass out for another.
Daddy pulled back for a second, and Dean thought he’d come right then as Daddy leaned down slightly to spit, the saliva hitting his cheek and running downwards. Daddy must have taken his dick in hand, because he rubbed his cockhead through the mess and spread around before settling back in and fucking Dean’s cheeks again, faster this time against wet skin.
“What’ve you found?”
Cas took himself in hand again, Dean’s come slicking the way, and began to jerk himself off, watching Dean watch him.
“Good boy,” his boss said, still watching him as he toed on his boots. “You may go. Someone will collect you first thing in the morning and bring you back here for some... Company onboarding. Try and get some sleep.”
“Because this is just the interview, I’ll forgive you for not addressing me properly,” his boss said, eyes flicking up from Dean’s dick to give him a stern look, “Tomorrow, I expect you to be on top form.”
Hannah pushed the buzzer on the intercom, just to the right of the doors, and waited for a response. There was an audible sound as the lock tumbled, and Hannah pushed one of the doors open.
“Well I wouldn’t want to spoil your lovely skin, and I’m not sure that I could look without touching right now. I’ll just have to unwrap you next time, like a present.”
“Gonna get some more lube in you,” He says, squeezing some out of the tube onto his hand.
“Aw, are you cross with me baby?” Cas asks, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist and resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
“God, look at you,” Daddy muttered, stroking his neck while he worked.
“Will anything attack us this time?” Cas asked, taking the beat-up power drill Dean handed him.
“What if I wasn’t into men?” Dean asked.
“Shit,” he said. Cas could only smile.
Dean faltered, his mouth full of waffle, trying to swallow it quickly so he could answer.
“Yes,” Hannah replied, “It’s an area just for you, a place to go when the Boss is busy and you need some downtime.”
“We’re not really going anywhere.”
“Is this what you wanted?” Cas asks, “You’ve been so good for me, after I made you wait all day.”
He tensed up, fingers tightening as he wondered how many people were in the room while he warmed his Boss’ cock in his mouth, wearing a pink princess eye-mask and silk panties. If anyone came around behind the desk, they’d be able to see him no problem, chin shiny with drool and a thick hefty dick between his lips. His cheeks burned at the thought of it, of anyone seeing him like this, nothing but a warm wet hole for a man with too much power.
They considered each other for a moment.
Dean was still blindfolded, but he managed to un-straddle the stand, and crawl out from under the desk. He was kneeling on the soft carpet when suddenly he could see again, the sleep-mask pulled from his head and discarded on the desk behind him. He stood up, blinking a bit in the bright light of the midday sun coming in the huge windows.
“Yes!” Cas replies, “I’m going to make you play with it while I watch.”
Dean’s hands were on him too, and it distracted him so much that he didn’t realize they were both standing there in their underwear until he felt Dean’s hands slide, unimpeded, over the cotton of his boxer-briefs.
Ash was relegated a back-seat-passenger-only soon after that.
It might not even be that difficult. So far the sex had been stupidly hot, even the asphyxiation got him going a little. Until it didn’t.
“No one knew I was there,” Dean whispered, arching into the touch, “I thought you might let people watch, or touch me, but you didn’t. I was hidden away, just for you. It was hot.”
Dean blushes, ducking his head.
“Uh, all the rules are rule number one, because you cannot rank the importance of them.” Dean said, attempting to save face.
“Hey, do you want to sleep a little?” I’m happy to drive for a bit if you want a break.” Castiel offered as they approached the car.
“What, Dean? Tell me what you want,” Cas says, slipping in a third finger.
“Uh, yes,” Dean said, entering a bit of a blind panic, “Don’t move, don’t talk, don’t suck your dick. Aye aye, Captain.”
“Well I don’t.” Dean grit his teeth, “What about over there, it looks open.”
Dean did as he was bid, shifting onto his stomach so that Daddy could look at his red and stinging cheeks, his erection waning from lack of stimulation. The couch was comfortable. There was a fluffy cushion under his head, and soon he was drifting off.
Dean laughed quietly against his neck, his hands running dizzying laps around Cas’s skin, across his chest and down his arms. Cas used his grip on Dean to rearrange them, pulling Dean on top of him properly, the full weight of him pressing Cas down into the mattress. It was addictive, Cas was sure of it. Now that he knew what it felt like, he couldn’t imagine not wanting it every minute of the rest of his life.
“Well Jo, I’ll see you around,” Ash said to the girl. Cas watched him finish off his drink, reminiscent of the times they would shotgun beers in the kitchen, during the long gaps between customers. That would never happen again he mused as he followed Dean out into the dark parking lot.
“Shh.”
They spent the evening in silence as they rolled through Nebraska, Castiel’s head resting on his arms again, gaze fixed firmly on the distant skyline of far-off farm buildings and tall trees. Dusk swirled over their heads as it reached across hundreds of miles of flat farm land, stretching to tuck itself into the horizon as the stars came out above them. The radio played softly as night fell, and Ash snored gently from where he lay on his stomach, one arm draped over the edge of the bench seat to rest on the floor.
“Ash.”
“Do you like this?” his boss murmured, low and gravelly right next to Dean’s ear.
“You did very well,” his Boss said, “You made a boring meeting much more bearable.”
“Babe,” He hears, calling him out of his day dreams, “I’m getting hard again.”
The shot rang out, loud and piercing, and the Chupacabra fell silent.
Dean felt stiff, his back sore from bending over.
“Through here,” she said, gesturing for Dean to keep following her.
“I don’t know what happened.” Castiel said.
Dean moves his arms a little, taking Cas’s hands in his own, pushing back against Cas.
“Okay,” Dean said, standing awkwardly halfway across the room, just far enough that he couldn’t quite make out the look on his Boss’s face, “Thank you, Daddy.”
“So probably he can, then.”
“What are you doing?” Dean asks, pleased despite his confusion.
“I’ll beat you off any time you like,” Dean said, the grin evident in his voice.
It was officially the weekend. He had two whole days to himself to unwind, to spend alone in an empty, cold apartment, missing his brother and trying to process what the fuck was happening with his “job”. He took one of the old twenties from the coffee can, with a plan to order a pizza and fall asleep on the couch.
The tailor was a breeze, compared to his morning. His underwear stayed on, and Hannah even brought him a chicken sandwich before sequestering herself on a plush sofa in the corner.
“Now we salt and burn the body. Swap the guns for gasoline, and all that.” Dean said, starting off towards the house again.
There was an odd stand under there, with padded sections. Dean sank to his knees but hesitated, unsure of how to proceed.
Daddy just hummed and kept going, lightly squeezing Dean’s balls as they drew up against his body. There was one final twist of Daddy’s head that pushed him over the edge, his body curling forward as he felt the first spurt of semen pump out of him, unable to stop himself from thrusting a little into Daddy’s mouth as he sucked and swallowed around him.
Dean’s looking up at him with a small smile and lazy eyes, looking fucked out and happy. Cas lines himself up and pushes back in, rolling his hips. He props himself up with his elbows either side of Dean’s head, and leaning down to kiss him. To taste his lips and the wet heat of his mouth as he fucks into him, fluid thrusts as they lay curled together on the bed.
“So you think we should go look at Lincoln’s head rendered in stone?” Castiel asked, his eyes on the road ahead, shimmering in the head of a sun directly overhead.
Eventually he heard the door open and close again; felt a presence in the room with him. He sat up straighter, hoping it was his boss coming to put him to good use.
Dean palmed himself over the silk, wanting to take the opportunity to show off. He ran his other hand over his chest, his touch light until he got to a nipple, where he began pinching and rolling it through the fabric of his shirt. Daddy watched him with an impassive face, but his eyes followed every movement he made. He ran a finger along his length, a delicate touch that seemed at odds with how hard Dean was, how turned on he felt in that moment.
Once inside, they found the right name plate, and Dean carefully removed the cover. Sliding the coffin out to open it was a struggle, but Dean moved like he’d done it before, which, Cas imagined, he probably had. The whole thing felt ceremonious, even though it wasn’t.
“So... I come here and just bend over when and where you tell me to?” he asked, shifting in his seat.
“What is this place?” Ash asked, slumping out of the back seat with all the grace of a three-legged sloth.
A thick black bag was tossed into the backseat, meant to go over Dean’s head, he assumed.
“Well, off we go then.” Dean replied, already out of Wilson.
“Well,” John had said, “See you round.”
Dean nodded dumbly, stepping away from his boss to reach for his clothes, still piled on the floor. His brain was foggy with the need to come, his dick aching, begging him to keep going. He stumbled into his jeans and underwear, pulling them up at the same time, gently tucking his cock, still wet and slick, into his pants. He pulled on his shirts too, haphazard and distracted.
“You were made for this,” He says, “Made to lie back and take my cock for as long as I want you to have it.”
“What was what?” Dean said, focusing on the road, his eyes tired.
“That is literally even further away.”
He lost count pretty quickly as his Daddy laid a few particularly hard blows to his upper thighs, nailing him right across the balls. The pain was sharp and he couldn’t think properly. It stung so bad, and he felt winded, but Daddy didn’t stop. His ass was burning, like the skin was pulled too tight across his muscles, like the heat in his face as he blushed. Every now and again, Daddy would stop and use a soothing hand to massage his hot skin, a tender and gentle touch sandwiched between periods of what felt like unending pain.
He jerked a thumb across his throat.
“Don’t keep me waiting,” Daddy said, the grip on his neck tightening.
“When it comes down to it,” Dean said, interrupting Castiel’s thoughts, “It was a fight-or-flight kinda deal, and your brain said to fight, to protect.”
“It’s a private clinic,” Hannah explained, bypassing reception entirely and heading to a bank of elevators off to the left.
“And for your guest?”
“That’s—” Dean frowned, thinking for a moment, “That’s a fancy word for sex work. You want me to find you a courtesan?”
“It’s his one flaw.” Ash said, reclining once again on his makeshift bed.
Dean’s incoherent by this point, groaning whenever Cas hits his prostate, shoving back against his thrusts.
“Really?” Ash asked, looking up from his new ID.
“Yes,” Castiel agreed with a small laugh, “I was fine while I was there, and now that I’m not, I have an almost burning desire to keep it that way. If that makes sense.”
“I—,” Dean paused, “I don’t know your name.”
“I’ve always wanted to be thought of as intimidating and formidable.” He said, crossing his arms on the table.
He tightened his hold on Dean’s chin, staring intently down at him. He almost looked unhinged, and suddenly Dean understood exactly why this man was as rich and powerful as he was.
The man was handsome, that much was obvious. Dean heard the door lock again as Hannah closed it behind her on her way out, but he kept his eyes on the man before him. This must be his Other Option.
“What do you look for,” Dean asked, getting up from the table. His voice was smooth but his movements were tentative, “In a guy, I mean.”
“You feel so good,” he choked out, his mouth pressed to Dean’s neck, the skin there damp from the huff of his breath.
“I heard, uh,” Dean swallowed hard, “Maybe a nickname, I don’t know. You called him Gabriel,” he finished weakly.
He opened one of the drawers closer to the archway and felt himself freeze.
“This,” Dean answered, “Is The Roadhouse.”
“Nah. Baby’s my home,” Dean said, shifting his grip on the steering wheel, “A house just makes things complicated. You always end up feeling like you gotta go back to it.”
Castiel turned to look, meeting Dean’s gaze.
After a couple of minutes, he had no choice but to swallow it, feeling himself make a disgusting slurping noise as he made sure to get it all. He was thanked with a sharp pinch to the neck, fingers gripping tight at his skin. He let out an undignified squeak, and suddenly he felt fingers gripping tight in his hair, yanking him away from the cock before a slap was delivered to his cheek. A solid one too, his Boss didn’t seem to bother warming him up with any love taps.
“Well, I did get my balls waxed, so that wasn’t exactly fun.” Dean replied, stiff in Daddy’s arms, “I didn’t think you’d be the type to like the completely bald look.”
“My boss.”
“I got him breakfast.” Dean said, feigning indignance.
“They didn’t.”
“Okay,” Dean said, watching as Daddy came back over to him.
“Yes, that’s generally how it works here,” the man said. His gaze was piercing and Dean had to focus on breathing to make sure he kept doing it right.
Castiel snorted.
“Yeah!” The guy called back, “Get in, we’ll grab your friend.”
“It’s fine.”
“What d’you say, fancy a trip to Rapid City?” Dean said to Castiel, his voice light despite the mood in the car.
During the car ride home (and the considerable time spent sitting in traffic), Dean messaged Sam, trying to catch him up on the situation without telling him much more than the bare essentials.
“Yeah, still breathing.” Said Dean.
Ash met them in the middle, chucking the bags he carried in the back, before diving in after them. Castiel slid down in his seat, panic building under the stiff polyester of his diner shirt.
“When you kept me warm?”
Any reply Castiel might have had was then cut off by the arrival of two plates stacked with grease. Dean looked pleased, and Castiel was pleased in turn. They only talked a little over their dinner, two people sharing time in the pre-dawn stillness of a city at rest. It was dark in the diner, and so when Dean spoke more of vampires and how many he’d met, he did so while bathed in orange light from the street-lamp outside. It was quiet, and it was calm, and he felt at peace.
Soon enough, they were both finished, and Isaiah was pushing the silver cart with all their empty dishes back through the service door. It swung shut, and they were alone.
“The usual please, Isaiah,” the boss said, taking the newspaper that the waiter—Isaiah, handed him.
“Yeah, probably. You want to eat at a stop along the highway? We could always go downtown, hit a few bars.”
“Open it!” Cas urges, his head resting against Dean’s shoulder, one hand resting gently on Dean’s bicep.
He’d been eaten out once, years and years ago, by a girl he’d been seeing at the time. She had talked him into it, but had been timid, giggling as she kitten-licked at him. It had felt nice, but soon enough her curiosity waned and they’d moved on to something else.
“That’s not how you speak to Daddy,” he said, his voice low and dangerous as he gripped Dean’s jaw again, tighter this time, “Try again. You can do what I ask of you, can’t you Dean?”
The bag was pulled up and off his head, revealing his boss standing in front of him, bathed softly in lamp-light and looking comfortable in casual clothes in the middle of a spacious modern looking bedroom.
“Tell me what you liked,” Daddy murmured, his voice low and a little threatening against Dean’s ear. One of his hands lay gently in Dean’s lap, right over his erection.
Dean expected it to be a boring couple of days. What he didn’t expect was the knock on his door at nearly eight o’clock. Looking through the peephole, he saw it was one of the goons. He undid the locks, standing there in his threadbare pajamas, annoyed and ready to argue.
Castiel sighed, his breath laced with smoke.
“We are,” Dean replied, “But I need to make a quick stop first.”
“Dean!” Castiel called, crawling over to where the beast lay dead, “Are you okay, did I shoot you by accident?”
“How long? Will you stay, I mean,” Dean asked him, his eyes hopeful as he watched Cas, “Just so I have an idea...”
The length of the day had settled in his bones, quiet as the mountains he drove towards, and now that he had reached them, he sought the silence of the night - found most often in diner’s with broken lights.
Dean nods, turning back towards the pile. He sifts through the different pairs, but he chooses a pair made of sheer fabric, baby pink. The ones with the lace and a heart-shaped cut out.
Dean took a sharp breath in, turning his head as if to hide it in Daddy’s shoulder, but Daddy wouldn’t let him. Why he was even admitting to any of this was beyond him. Daddy just seemed to get every little thought out of his head.
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“Oh, fuck,” Dean moaned, as his boss started rolling their hips together, creating a slow but steady rhythm.
“What about you, Cas? Anywhere you’d like to go?”
“So where are you going?” Dean had finally asked, his eyes fixed on a spot on the floor.
“Shh,” Daddy said, laying down on top of him, taking the proffered hand in his own, “You’re doing so good, you’re perfect.”
Cas is losing his composure now, he’s been hard for so long and desperate to come, wanting to spill inside of his boyfriend, luxuriate in the pleasure they give each other.
“Now... Can you follow orders, Dean?” the man asked, his voice casual but low enough to suggest otherwise.
“Okay, but there are rules right? Like for kinky bondage shit, there’s rules to stay safe,” Dean felt panic rising in his chest, but tried to breath through it, trying to maintain at least some sense of composure.
“Mmm,” He hums, “Morning.”
He trails his fingers along the line of the heart shape, before kneading Dean’s ass with both hands. He squeezes more lube on his fingers and presses two into Dean’s stretched hole, pushing in deep.
Hannah just spread her hands in front of her, as if to say that was exactly what they wanted from him. She was still smiling.
“Good. Well, we’re settled then. That will be all. Someone will meet you at the front door to escort you home,” his Boss said, turning back to the papers on his desk and not sparing Dean another glance as he dismissed him, “I’ll see you tomorrow at eight for breakfast.”
“Is that all?”
“To think,” Castiel said idly, pulling away so he could start tugging the shorts downwards, “You’ve been here all day alone, wrapped up like a pretty present for me. I would much rather have been here.”
