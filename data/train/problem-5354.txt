“Be a doll and mix a drink? Say, do you know how to make a highball?” Tony says. Steve doesn’t laugh.
The empty feeling emboldens him. Steve’s fingertips tingle. He swallows a lump in his throat and reaches over, gently taking the empty helmet and faceplate in his hands, the skull. Alas, poor Yorrick. He handles it delicately, like a faberge egg.
“So,” Tony says, the door clicking softly shut, “Did you put money on me, too? Good odds, I hear. Easy money. Actually, you know what. I don’t want to know.”
When Steve looks for the broadcast online later, he can’t find it anywhere. It’s been taken down from every video sharing site. Like it never happened.
“Yeah but—” Tony shuts his eyes and listens. “It’s like an instrument. It’s like a xylophone. Weird, right? I never heard anything like it. Must be the acoustics?”
Howard gets older. His hair grows long and white. He looks like Santa Claus, but skinny and mean. Tony could laugh.
“Is it SHIELD making you do all of this? The curfew? The checkpoints? The lies?” Steve asks carefully. He steels himself for an answer he doesn’t want to hear. He wants to hear Tony
“Ouch, easy— fuckin’ hell, that smarts,” Tony hissed as Steve heaved him up into his arms, bridal style. Steve’s knees shook— Tony could feel Steve’s muscles tremor with the effort, yet the sheriff made not a single complaint.
to it, though; some dark, insecure thing inside of him wants to hear Tony say it. Some darker thing wants Tony to beg Steve's forgiveness, so Steve's ego can survive forgiving Tony. He's going to forgive him, either way, he already knows. He just wants to be right. It isn't what he's here for.
It isn’t a win; SHIELD forcing Tony’s hand and Tony letting them isn’t a win by any measure, but some part of Steve cannot help celebrating inside— that Tony isn’t fully to blame, that even if the world is fucked— whatever has long existed between them might be salvageable. That Tony still needs him. (That nameless, ill-defined bond has always meant so much to Steve.)
“How’s the weather up there?” he asks, pausing to cough. The little bit of heat has vanished with the sun, and Tony’s freezing. For a while, he’s been shivering, but then that stopped.
Tony scoffed. “Whoever said I needed rescue? Had it all planned out. Was gonna have myself home in time for Christmas breakfast, before you showed up.”
“Well, Stark. I hope you learned yer lesson,” the mustached outlaw said, grinning a wicked grin. His teeth were stained tobacco-brown, and he wasn’t gentle as he wrenched Tony’s shoulder out of its socket. Tony yelped in pain before it was replaced by a shooting numbness.
It’s silent, too. There are no footsteps coming from any other part of the building. No whir of the heating and plumbing. No hum of computers in other rooms. Tony has been left alone to his grave, and he wonders if he’s dead already.
He dreams bloody dreams until his buzzing communicator wakes him, and that other, transient world evaporates. Dew in the heat.
“Well,” Tony said, grinning, “They might not get too far. I think they’ll have to turn back when they realize they left something behind.”
The inertia gives way, and Steve rushes into the room. All he feels is cascading relief. The hatred, the loathing, the anger, the hurt, the betrayal— it’s all gone somewhere else, for now. In his most primitive, incoherent thoughts, all Steve can muster right now is how glad he is to see Tony alive.
Tony jams his hand into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled card. A blank business card. It’s written on in Tony’s own penmanship, smudged blue ink, a number.
With so little information, and with no one to depend upon but himself, it gives Steve the perfect, all-consuming mission to lose himself in. Somewhere along the way, he stops feeling entirely human.
A hand grabs him by the shoulder. Steve flinches, jostling several broken bones. It's only Sam behind him, though. He stares down in masked horror at the green carnage under Steve.
But it’s as futile as flexing a phantom limb. Nothing happens and Tony gasps for breath like a fish as his thoughts become hazy.
Then Natasha is there, too. Her auburn hair has been blown out into perfect waves and she looks particularly well-rested for a woman whose fiancé has been in the hospital. “Alive, sure. But well is pushing it.” She smiles, cat-like and beautiful.
Tony’s heart started pounding. It was all fun and games— causing a ruckus and getting his ass kicked to distract himself from the desolate loneliness of another holiday alone— until Tony was suddenly in very real danger of dying ugly.
He’s relentless, and while he knows Tony is embarrassed by his own need, he thinks that he’s lonely, too. The loneliness beats out the shame eventually, and Tony finally agrees. Steve is guilty and relieved; he shouldn't have pushed, maybe. But he thinks this is for the best. He thinks Tony won't let anyone else near enough to see how damaged he's become, and he has a fear-- one he dares not put into words-- of what might happen to Tony, alone.
“Looks like you’re shit out of luck,” one of the outlaws said, striding up the steps of the porch of the jailhouse. His fat wallet jingled with every step, the smug asshole.
It’s a hell of a way to get the world on your side. The deaths are all still so fresh in public memory, and Tony and his team capitalize on that. Steve thinks it can’t possibly get any more debased and amoral.
Steve has little reassurance to provide and he feels useless. He owes them all better. These people have followed him into the dark. He feels like a failure, and he hopes his doubt isn’t contagious. He owes it to them to pretend to be confident, but the truth is, they’re dying out here, and things keep getting worse.
Rage. Steve tastes it, copper bright on his tongue. He jabs his finger at her, “Don’t play politics with
This isn’t how he ever wanted this to happen. He feels oddly violated. He feels like more of an idiot for falling for this kind of pretense than he ever did for falling for a trap in battle.
Steve shrugs. His cheeks turn warm but he doesn’t look embarrassed. It’s the only spot of color, the blood in Tony’s mouth, the blood flushed to Steve’s cheeks. “It doesn’t matter. You won’t tell anybody. You’re won’t— You’re going to—”
He catches an early morning bus across town because it’s less conspicuous than walking. He transfers buses downtown and gives five dollars to a homeless man who can’t seem to stop staring at his face at the bus station. He takes another bus, burying his face in the sports section of a newspaper for the half hour ride. He needs another transfer but he’s out of bus fare, so he walks the last leg of the journey. No one pays him a second glance.
When he wakes up, his mouth is a desert and a white hot pain radiates from the back of his head all the way around to his eye sockets. The pain pulses in time with his sluggish heartbeat. He’s disoriented and too stiff too move.
He sleeps in an abandoned house, on a mildewed sofa. The walls are bare, the wallpaper sun bleached except for in rectangle shaped patches where there must have once been frames hanging.
“Please, what’s going on? Jus’ tell me wha’s happening. Are we leaving? Are we going?” Tony asks. He sounds pathetic, but he’s terrified. The thick air is suffocating, and his chest feels too tight already. Joe preps the needle. Tony’s stomach drops when he sees that Joe’s hands are trembling.
“Oh, God, look at you. You didn’t have to do that,” Tony says, grateful. He comes closer with a towel in his hand. “You can just set it on the ground, don’t worry. I’ll get it washed tomorrow. Here.”
The cave fills with water like an unattended bathtub. Up to their ankles, up to their knees. The water is hot, and red, and thick. Up to his stomach, up to his neck— he tries to swim but he can’t move, anchored in place, screaming out his last breath as it overtakes him and his lungs fill with blood.
"What're you seeing?"  Steve says, straightening his back. He tries to look where Tony's looking. All he sees is empty air.
He waits for Tony to message him, for any reason, because he’s afraid of being traced and losing their location. If they get flushed out now, even if some of them make it to a new safe house, their numbers would be obliterated. There would be no way everyone makes it through the SHIELD checkpoints and surveillance unseen. He wishes a message into existence.
You’re leaving?” Tony says. He realizes a moment too late just how pathetic he sounds, and he wonders how full of drugs he must be to lose his edge. He’s briefly acutely aware of how he must look from the outsider’s perspective: the eccentric wealthy playboy with a losing personality and just enough medical issues to catch himself a hot wife, with a mile long pre-nup and will agreement. It isn’t like that, with Natasha, of course. He knows it’s not about the money with her, but he could see why people might think it. Sometimes, it seems like she doesn’t actually like him that much.
"What can I do?" Steve asks. He feels useless at  times like this. When Tony is obviously suffering some loose thread of an alternate, more terrifying reality. But Steve can't help, if Tony doesn't let him. At times, it's irrationally infuriating. He has no right to be angry at Tony for with holding his own private horrors, and yet, it makes Steve feel so fucking inadequate and useless. As ineffectual as one of Tony's shadow.
“You know, I’m not going anywhere. I’m real,” Steve says, slowly. Tony seems relieved, but like he maybe doesn’t quite believe it yet. Steve knows a thing or two about that; he’s spent a long time teaching himself how to prepare for disappointment.
Steve watches the rain drip from the ledge a few feet past their feet. In their little overhang, they’re protected from the dampness. Under different circumstances, it could be called cozy.
Then, he sees something. Steve notices that the padlock on the front door is shiny and new, standing out like a sore thumb from the rust and ruin of the rest of the place.
As he loses consciousness, he sinks into a dark fog, some endless night, where a dozen green hands reach down his throat and pull him apart from the inside out.
Sheriff Rogers put a lot of time into planning Timely’s Christmas celebration. New to town and new to the job, he didn’t seem to care that Timely wasn’t that kind of town. No, he had been hell bent on giving his town a good Christmas, and Tony couldn’t understand it.
He’s been held captive before; he thinks he was never so weak. He blames it on the drugs. He blames it on the routine. He blames it on his age. It feels like there are hands inside his brain, people digging around inside of him. Animals in a trash bin. Rearranging and molesting, no part of him feels untouched. The drugs are like a blender on his subconscious memory, and the nightmares of the day mix seamlessly with the horrors of his own dreams. His thoughts corrupted, his mind half gone, his body weakened and strange to him.
she gestures in vague distaste to the hospital bed containing Tony, “I’m afraid I actually have somewhere I have to be tonight.”
Of all missions to die on. He’s quietly relieved that Natasha, and the rest of the Ultimates, couldn’t come. It suddenly seems more like fate than inconvenience. He wonders how she will take the news of Tony’s death. It isn’t a pleasant thought, but not for the reasons you might expect.
Something between fury and fear crosses Steve’s face. Tony recognizes it as vulnerability. He wonders how it feels for Steve, all muscle and imposing statue and power, to feel so exposed. And it’s thrilling, to put him in that position. It’s a power struggle that’s only so delightful because of how easily the dynamic could be reversed.
“Thank God,” Tony says, to Jarvis, “I’m thirsty as hell.” He laughs and Steve’s expression turns uneasy. Something inside of him hurts in response to laughter, but the pain’s too nebulous to place.
The house is a two story with boarded over windows and dandelions growing between the cracks in the drive way. Steve worries he must have the wrong place. It doesn’t look like anyone has been here for a long, long time. He stands there for a moment staring, the sun warming his shoulders, and it feels like the house stares back. The dark windows and the sagging porch roof frown, an empty-eyed skull.
Steve shrugs. “Not my area of expertise.” But his jaw flexes, tense, eyeing Tony’s burnt arm; he’s worried and not hiding it well. As much as Tony would like to flatter himself that Steve cares about him on some personal level, it seems far more likely that the concern is the result of the severity of Tony’s injuries rather than his status of endearment to the good old Captain.
Tony always looks off in his broadcasts, too. Strangely rigid in some ways, yet simultaneously too comfortable in his own body, too pleased with himself, too smug. He puts his name on every horrible act, his new brand of philanthropy. He’s got his fingers so far down SHIELD’s throat that Steve can’t tell if it’s SHIELD pushing Tony around, or Tony pushing SHIELD around, anymore. It’s too hard to get a read on any of it from such a distance, and the feeling is only made worse when Steve recalls the last time he saw Tony in person.
“Ne’er to play poker with a bunch of sore losers from outta town, I’d have to say,” Tony said, and then punctuated his sentence by hocking up a glob of spit, right into the bandit’s face.
to burn out the sense memory of beating Tony Stark’s face to a bleeding pulp in the streets, the rasp of his last breath taken under the weight of Steve’s body pressing down on his lungs.
team; all of them choose to go with him to make their stand, even knowing the risk. Steve doesn’t know what will happen. Lives might be lost. Any number of them might be taken. And yet, they come.
The most unsettling thing is that Steve doesn’t definitively know what the last moment had been, when he had seen the true Tony. Had it been it on the news? Had it been the night they met in the ball field? Had it been the back of Tony's head, worrying over a cup of coffee, walking in the opposite direction, so distracted that he didn’t notice Steve watching from the shadows?
When he’s awake, reality is as thin and fragile as spun sugar. He sees things that aren’t there. He hears voices. He forgets himself; one moment he’s being forced to swallow a feeding tube roughly by someone with a blurry face and green hands, and the next moment, he’s begging Jarvis to not to leave his room, he hadn't
Steve wipes his mouth on the back of his hand. He cracks his neck, as though he’s just been through a training exercise, not a blowjob. “So I’ve heard,” he says, crawling up to sit next to Tony, leaning back against the rock.
He dreams about gold in his bones. Green hands cracking them open and sucking the light out, like the sweet flesh from a lobster claw.
“I’m fine, Steve. I’m mostly fully recovered. A few more months on my diet and I’ll be weight restored, too. It’s nothing you need to worry about,” he says. What he doesn’t say is,
“Be safe out there,” Tony says, near monotone. He sounds like he has given up. Accepted the reality, whatever that means to him. Or maybe he's just seeing specters again. “I hope you change your mind. I’m sorry for wasting your time.”
Tony wasn’t one to discriminate, these days. Company was company, and the drink certainly lowered his moral standards (as well as his standard for good conversation.) On Christmas Eve night, Tony would take what he could get not to be alone with his own whiskey-sour thoughts.
“I’m not having much luck. I don’t want to cut you by mistake. Say, can you hold yourself up an inch so I can get at them ropes underneath?”
He’s pissed himself, but he feels mostly dry, now. It’s been some time. The room reeks of urine and soot and smoke and sweat, and rancid dry mouth breath. His throat tastes like copper, and he’s too parched to even swallow.
“Sh,” Steve says without moving a muscle. He feels like Tony is speaking to him directly now. He can feel his pulse in his ears.
"The empty feeling emboldens him. Steve’s fingertips tingle. He swallows a lump in his throat and reaches over, gently taking the empty helmet and faceplate in his hands, the skull. He handles it delicately, like a faberge egg.
But then, he sees, magnified by the super binoculars, a red and gold figure steps into Steve’s line of sight. Gleaming.
Tony isn’t faring well; they both took damage in the crash, but it’s superficial on Steve. He’s walking like one side is sore, and there’s an ugly, bleeding gash already knitting itself together above his brow, but he managed to escape the fire unscathed.
“Oh, yeah?” said the mustached bandit. He knelt in the dirt beside Tony, the leather of his boots squeaking and his ugly belt buckle twinkling in the moonlight. He leaned down until he and Tony were almost eye to eye. He smiled like a smug bastard.
Steve can’t help but sweep his gaze around the room, meeting the eyes of everyone, one by one, as if he could somehow tell on sight alone if there is a Judas among them. “The truth is we’re hemorrhaging resources. We’ve lost good men and women. We’ll lose more,” he pauses. “But. I want to ask you all to follow me one more time. You owe me nothing, and none of you should agree to come along lightly. This might be a suicide mission. But—”
Two spots of color appear high on Steve’s filthy cheeks. He stares at Tony, slack jawed, as though taken aback by the suggestion that he might open his mouth because another man asked him to. Because it would
Tony knows this, of course. He ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck, compulsively looking over his shoulder. Steve wonders if he even notices himself doing it.
Steve slinks home with wounded pride, still reeling from the turn of events. He can’t seem to cool down the burning heat in his ears and cheeks, and it’s more from the shame than from the fear of being caught out.
And Steve appreciates the fantastic water pressure and self-warming bathroom floors, when he showers off the sour stink of nightmares, after living for so long without any amenities at all. He learns to let himself enjoy small pleasures of the flesh, of which Tony's home is in no short supply. The coffee is always freshly ground. He never goes cold or hungry.
There aren’t many things Steve wouldn’t do for Tony, and it feels like this is he time he really needed Tony to be willing to do anything for Steve. It isn’t
“Cat got your tongue? You don’t have to be shy, Steve. We’ll pretend it never happened. No one will know. Just because we’re fighting doesn’t mean we can’t make up just for a night,” Tony says. He speaks almost as if they’ve done this before, and that is
“Everything’s going to be okay,” Tony-Howard purrs. His voice sounds like three people speaking in unison. The world swims. Howard-Tony affectionately caresses Tony’s cheek.
“You’re so dumb,” Howard says. Tony nods. “You just has to wait for the sedative to wear off, and Extremis will come back on. And you can call for help.”
That, and his own nightmares and neuroses haven’t gone anywhere just because Tony’s going through something worse. It’s a delicate balance that he finds himself perpetually misjudging. Overextending himself, and then feeling the worry too hard when he feels in the dark. It would be easier, he thinks, if they could just enjoy a little peace together.
It has been so long since he’s immersed himself in a crowd that he feels alien; he wonders if this is how a skrull feels, wearing a human face, but knowing he’s
He thinks that this might have been just what the skrulls wanted when they planted one of their own as Tony. The heroes torn apart and bitter, dead and disbanded, leaving a hollow world. A weakened world. How many of his friends had been skrull plants? How many SHIELD officials? It keeps him up at night. Better off alone.
“I know. Don’t worry about it.” Tony looks at the needle in dismay. He’s a little nauseous. He forces himself to focus on the ceiling for a minute until it passes.
When he wakes, his head still hurts. But there’s something else. Tony blinks. And then— feebly, shaking— he manages to sit up. It takes all his strength. The rattle of his chains startles him, the first non-imagined sound he’s heard in a long time.
“Alright. You get your way,” Steve says, over the sound of gravel crunching, a few pebbles tumbling over the ledge as Steve adjusts his position to lie on his stomach by the mouth of the cave. “I’m here. Just get some sleep.”
None of it makes sense to Steve. He wonders how much pressure Tony must be under from SHIELD to endorse such dystopian measures, and he finds himself thinking about him near constantly. Fluctuating between anger, confusion, and concern. More than anything, he just wants to meet again. He’s had a lot of time to think since their last meeting, and he regrets not asking Tony what he had meant about not trusting anyone. Whatever is going on, Steve won’t find out unless they can talk one on one again. And the more extreme measured pushed by SHIELD using Tony as their figurehead, the more questions Steve has.
"You'd think," Steve says, "That you'd have the same taste. Same tastebuds, and all." It feels strange to speak about so cavalierly. The double. His time living here, in Tony's home, wearing Tony's skin. Steve thinks this might be the first time Tony has directly mentioned it in any form.
tangible; but grief is a symptom, and the cause is still a gordian knot. The Registration Act and SHIELD, skrull fingers puppeteering the government, bitter final words between he and Tony, corpses half-buried in the rubble, fires in the skies. His best friend disappearing into a haze of smoke, not yet since heard from again. There had been no cathartic peak, no release of tension, no relief. Just a slow hemorrhaging of spirit, and life, and self.
Timely was a ghost town, on Christmas Eve. Those who had families were inside their homes with their loved ones. Those without families were resting up for the festivities tomorrow— Sheriff Rogers had spent damn near the entire month of December planning some kind of Christmas day dance.
fat raindrops falling at a slant with the wind. They have been without water for a long while. Tony hasn’t attempted to count the hours (his watch hadn’t survived the fire, and his phone was long gone), but the dryness in the back of his throat and the changing light tells enough.
He crosses the floor and there’s a jarring echo as he pulls a metal stool up to the table. His body reacts with the revulsion and dread, as if he in the presence of a real corpse, and not just the lobster shell of a missing man. The rational part of his mind knows how foolish it is to feel so horrified by a piece of empty metal. The rational part of his mind, however, also knows that this
“I’m right here, babe.” Her heels click against the linoleum floor as she crosses the room to be at his side. Awkwardly, Steve relinquishes his chair and sort of backs himself into a corner, as though he’s somehow imposing.
Tony bites his tongue. All the cards are on the table now. He says, looking up at Steve, right into his eyes, “Nobody will know. The dead don’t speak. It’ll stay here— with my body, I imagine. I won’t insult your intelligence by pretending I have half a chance in hell of leaving here alive.”
Accessing the internal communications through Extremis is like riding a bike; Tony closes his eyes, and opens the private communication link between he and Steve. There are hundreds of short, one line messages waiting for him, flooding his mind as they all suddenly load at once.
After every dirty play and shamelessly political ploy, Steve doesn’t know how to believe a word Tony says anymore. It's a loss in its own right which Steve will mourn when he has the privacy.
, I think it would be ideal if we just, never talk about the whole thing. And if you never spoke to me again, well.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, and he means it. Steve doesn’t think. He can’t allow himself. He brings the shield down one final time, with a wet crunch.
“Of course it is.” Steve is resolute, and Tony thinks he understands how Steve was able to lead hundreds. “There’s nothing braver than trying to do something good with the time you’re given. Everyone’s dying. It’s easier to waste it.”
Tony pulls back first. “Is this okay?” he asks, nervous. Steve can’t help it; he grins. The courage Tony’s shown, surviving everything he has survived, getting back on the horse, making the world better. Healing. Confessing his feelings. Being the first to kiss Steve. And yet, he still sounds like he’s ready for someone to tell him he’s bad at any moment.
“Don’t talk, let me give you some water. It’s okay. It’s going to be okay,” Steve says, reaching into his bag and producing one of his jugs. He isn’t sure that Tony has the strength to hold it himself. “Can I— I’m going to hold this up to your mouth. It’s okay. Just drink slowly. It’s okay.”
“I want to thank you all for you courage, and for coming here again today when I asked,” Steve starts. “I know how much you’ve lost. All of us.”
Maybe he's looking for cracks, but he thinks, there's something more going on than what meets the eye.
“Million dollar question, huh?” He’s not being frustrating on purpose but he can’t seem to turn it off. Tony’s the expert deflector, but Steve can’t seem to hide a thing. He’s flashing frustration and fear like a neon sign. “Perk up, cupcake. You’re better looking when you smile. Let’s not make a whole event of this, huh?”
In his nightmares, he brings his shield down over Iron Man’s face and crushes his skull and waits for the flesh to turn green, and the true form to be revealed. He can’t breathe while he waits for that green to come, nor can he look away. And in his nightmares, it never comes.
It’s 1:30 in the morning. Snow falls. Steve is just another shadow. With the curfew in full swing, and the blanket of white muffling every sound, the city is as silent as the grave. Steve can hear his own heartbeat. His ears and nose grow numb and cherry red.
He doesn’t need his full mental capacity to default to self-flagellation; he’s wired to assume he deserves this, and somehow the self loathing makes it easier to endure.
Save for a few tipped over filing cabinets, and abandoned electrical extension plugs, the house is empty. His footsteps creak, the only interruption to the eery silence. It feels like someone might pop out from around a corner and yell
As the plane’s nose tilts down, the engine whines loud enough to drown out whatever Steve is shouting at the unconscious pilot. It’s like being stuck in slow motion; Steve is saying something, shaking his shoulders, and Tony vomits on himself. Through thick cloud cover, he can see the mountains rushing up to meet them out the window. He thinks, if he survives this, no one will ever talk him into flying so nearly sober ever again.
It starts to rain, just in time to distract Tony from the way his hands have begun to shake. This is a blessing and a curse. The heavens part and the deluge begins,
He’s quiet for a long time. He can’t stay much longer; the guard will change any minute and Steve will lose his window to slip out undetected. He isn’t done his work yet, so he has to stay vigilant. He has to go.
“I need you to know I was always thinking of you. Even in the end, when— it was always you. Through all of this, the thing I was most scared of losing, was you. I knew we might never be friends again. Never partners. Never—”
Tony’s eyes fall shut involuntarily, and he grins. “Was that a crack at my big mouth?” he says, delighted, “Because after that little performance, you’re hardly one to talk.”
cheating. And being good at math was certainly no sin, either. It really wasn't fair to accuse him of unsavory business just because, even slobbering drunk, he had a knack for numbers.
out of words. He’s tired. Supporting Tony in his recovery has been exhausting; Steve would do it again in a heartbeat, and doesn’t plan on going anywhere, but the burden they’re carrying together is enormous, and Steve’s shoulders are only so big. Tony was fundamentally broken, in some way he still can’t verbalize to Steve, or any therapist. Steve feels constantly helpless, and the joy of having Tony back and seeing things in the world improve is eclipsed by the feeling of being stuck in a new kind of hole.
The fall is far but it happens fast. They don’t even see the drop-off until they’re upon it. It’s too dark. They’re too tired. Tony is asleep on his feet, and he’s leaning hard on Steve, who is also tired, and both his hands are full— one supporting Tony, and the other with their meager water container.
“Better if I try now, while there’s light and the rock is still sort of dry, before—” But Steve is cu off by another crash of thunder, and a fat raindrop lands on his cheek. It’s too late. Dumbly, Steve touches the wet spot on his face and looks at his fingertip. He reaches his hand out to feel for droplets, and it starts coming down harder. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating Steve in white light for a split second, throwing flashing shadows around the cave. Tony remains tucked away in darkness, beneath an overhang where rock shields him from the rain.
get back to his home and find a pistol, he’d have to find bullets, too, and then there was the risk of the thing backfiring. He hadn’t cleaned any of his guns in years.
After logging so many hours in the Iron Man armor, Tony should be used to plummeting through the air, yet it never gets easier. Falling scares him. Every time.
He transfers it from his glove to Tony’s hand, and Tony notices a second too late. Panic flickers across his expression. “What the hell?”
It’s Tony. It has always been Tony. This matters so much to Steve and he had expected Tony to see that. And concede.
of his closest allies could be green imposters. He has to rely only on himself, and if he lets on that he knows about the skrulls, he could be putting himself— all of them— in danger. He has to play his cards close, and he has to finish what has been started. Maybe he can’t stop SHRA. Maybe he can’t stop the skull invasion, because it’s too big for him to see. Not alone, anyways. One man against legions.
He tries to swing the shard of glass like a knife, but his arm goes offline and drops limply to the side. His balance shifts and the next thing he knows, the world rolls and rushes by. He feels the wind knocked out of him as he falls off the side of the bed and hits the floor.
as good as Tony’s corpse. Too much time has passed without any sign of him. There is no trail. There are no leads. They didn’t even notice he was
His dad is sitting beside him in the dark. He’s hallucinating, but at least he knows it, kind of. He feels a little paranoid. (It seems sort of real.) In the vision, his dad is old. Older than he ever got the chance to become in real life. Tony doesn’t feel like he looks much like him at all.
“‘M with you. I think. My guardian angel,” Tony rasped. “Christ, would you give that a break? Stop moving me. Yer’ killing me,” Tony complained.
He meets Tony in the ship yard, not far from Tony’s home. It’s late at night, but Tony’s eyes are covered by shades and he leans against a post under a street light. Steve takes in a deep breathe of the salty, reeking air, and the smell of wood rot from the ancient planks of the dock.
“It’s real simple, Tony. It’s right from wrong. Maybe that’s too complicated for you to understand,” Steve says, icy. He can taste his own heartbeat, fueled by anger and abandonment and misery. All his skeletons come jumping out of the closet.
Steve cleans Tony's bed sores and bandages them every night. Runs his fingers over jutting ribs, frowning. He hounds Tony about following the nutrition plan, and Tony acts annoyed but admits to constantly forgetting. Steve remembers things that Tony forgets, and Steve doesn’t mean to think too much of himself, but he gets the distinct impression that his constant presence makes it a little easier for Tony to maintain his sobriety through the troubling months, too.
Steve kisses him on the mouth, and then pecks his forehead. He never wants to let go, but he thinks, there’s going to be time. There’s forever in front of them. He’s not going anywhere.
“I saved your life,” Steve says. There’s a touch of confusion in his voice, almost hurt. He’s probably used to people being more appreciative for his services— or at the very least, not openly resentful. The tiny crease forming between his brows, the earnest disappointment— it isn’t that he expects thanks, Tony thinks. Steve has never been quite so entitled, he isn’t a man used to getting his way. It’s something else which Tony can’t put his finger on.
“You son of a bitch,” Steve laughed. He started laughing real hard, cheeks flushed with liquor and laughter and warmth. “You
The girls leave, Steve holding the door for them. Instead of following them out, though, he lets the sound of their chatter and high heeled footsteps fade away. Then, he looks at Tony.
“Apparently. Withdrawals, I’ll admit it. But it’s passed, now,” Tony says. The truth is, he’s scared shitless. Just because he has a rough idea of what’s happening to him doesn’t make him comfortable with it, and he’s never had to white knuckle it like this before. There has always been a silver tray of cocktails just the ring of a bell away, for Tony.
It’s easier to skip the whole song and dance by simply not telling her when he has chemo, or surgery, or appointments, so he can’t resent her for not being there to hold his hand. It’s just the way the do things.
The clouds have begun darkening again, and ominously, as though to emphasize Tony’s point, thunder rumbles in the distance. When the wind starts, it skims the mouth of the cave and creates an empty howl— like the sound produced by blowing across the rim of a bottle. It makes Tony feel sick again.
“Shit,” Joe says, turning back toward Tony. He produces a needle and kneels by Tony’s side. Tony coughs some more, tears starting to form in the corners of his eyes as the paper burns itself down.
A second message follows a second later. The following message is without words; it contains an address, the dock behind a derelict shipping house. Discrete, Steve things. Private.
Tony goes to the bar. He picks up a bottle and pours himself a generous drink, back turned to he window. Steve hates to see it. He keeps watching, as Tony flips up the faceplate and tosses his drink back. He turns to face the window—
, (they all but encourage people to speculate), and that someone has been signing documents in his name from the inside, as a cover up. SHIELD pretends to launch a department-wide investigation, there's talk of imaginary whistle blowers. The world demands accountability; they’re angry that they’ve been fooled, and SHIELD pretends to be ashamed.
He wakes up and waits for the needle prick. Ghosts from dreams already slipping from his memory dance in his peripheral. In the blackness of his cell, his mind invents lights and shapes and figures where there are none. Tony’s learned to ignore them. Mostly. But they don’t give him his shot.
Tony draws him arm back like he's going to hit Steve. Steve leans easily to the side and dodges. Tony tries to hit  him again. Steve hates to do it, but he catches Tony's wrist in his hand, immobilizing his arm. Tony's eyes bug out of his head. He starts thrashing, beating at Steve's chest with his other fist. It doesn't really hurt.
The tiny amount of light falls into the dark room, and there he is. Steve blinks as though to clear the specter from his eyes, but it's him: the ghost Steve has been chasing. Hunched over, bony arms curled around naked legs, Tony is sitting there in chains, staring at Steve with vacant shock.
He gets up and quickly disappears into the door on the far wall, presumably the master bathroom. Steve stands, uncomfortable and damp. Sticky. The spot on the sheets spreads, and Steve think of Tony’s giant, expensive mattress. He starts stripping the sheet from the bed before the moisture soaks through too deeply. He wrestles with the giant linen, but as he goes to untuck the bottom corner, he makes a startling discovery.
“You have to get out of here, Cap, they have backup on the way,” Sam says to Steve through grit teeth; it doesn’t look as though Sam has fared much better than Steve. He looks broken, and tired, and just barely able to stand on his own. Steve can’t ask how many they lost, or who. He’s just glad Sam’s still standing. He feels like he’s drowning. Is it the blood in his lungs, or the fact that he can’t seem to make himself breathe evenly? The way an empty opens like a tear in spacetime and sucks what's left of his spirit out of him. Everything starts to feel far away. Like walking through a world wrapped in cotton.
The stars are out tonight, for the first time since the crash. Behind the dim outline of Steve’s silhouette, they twinkle like a field of diamond. All the points of light blur together.
“Hello?” he calls out. There’s a lump in his throat and his pulse feels electric; he isn’t being smart, he isn’t being stealthy. He’s being stupid. He’s being hopeful. He can’t help it.
The flames looks like silk. He can almost pretend not to hear Steve screaming at him over the ringing in his ears. It’s claustrophobic— like crawling into an oven— shimmying on his stomach into what’s left of the cockpit. A wall of fire, reeking of black smoke and jetful, separates Tony from the mangled corpse of the pilot. The flask gleams flickering silver, warped by the heat. Tony makes a choice: he reaches into the fire—
It ends with Steve counting his broken bones again. It ends with one of his arms numb and blood filling his lungs and his uniform shredded down to flesh, bodies littering the ground. Steve can’t stop to take their names. When he gets an opening, he takes it.
“I know. It’s okay. He’s dead. I know it wasn’t you,” Steve reassures. “Don’t worry about that now, okay? We don’t have to talk about it now. Let’s get you warm.”
The next time he opens his eyes, Steve sits beside him and there’s water running down the walls of the cave. Thunder booms like a drum beat, and Steve hunches over between Tony’s legs so his face is hidden. Tony grins, lazily trying to shift his knees further apart.
“Not yet,” Tony says. There’s no moon tonight. “It’s a lovely night for a walk.” Tony’s more half limping, half being dragged than walking, but Steve’s mysterious ankle injury seems to have healed enough to put some strength back in his step.
“I think we should rest, soon. A few more minutes. When we get over this peak we should be able to see better,” Steve says.
He lands, wobbling, on the rubble. It crunches under his feet as he steps closer to loom over Steve. “You’re like a roach, aren't you? Hard to make you stay down, little insect. Maybe I should put you down for good.”
his best friend, and not some parasitic replacement. It’s Tony’s eyes, looking up at him in stunned terror. Tony’s high-bridged nose, mashed to a pulp. Tony’s broken teeth, and viscous blood in Tony’s beard.
When he’s finally able to come out of the shadows, Steve doesn’t know what to spend his freedom on outside of being with Tony. He’s grown accustomed to hiding. He doesn’t want to be seen, for a while. The public wants him to speak, but Steve finds himself
bar,” Tony corrects him, “Why don’t you meet me for a drink before lift off, might help loosen up that stick up your ass.”
Steve’s civilian shoes squeak on the white linoleum as he comes back to sit by the bed. Intuitively, he seems to realize how embarrassing it had been for Tony to ask, so he doesn’t look at him, or try to talk.
“I arrested our friends the day I offered you amnesty. I don’t know if I was doing the right thing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what’ll happen, I don’t want to go back.”
too tight and Tony hissed against Steve’s lips. Immediately, Steve let go and stumbled backward like he’d touched hot iron. Panic flashed across his features.
Steve is there, in star spangled swim trunks. No, he wouldn’t be so flashy. Something plain. Tony puts him in a Speedo, too, then— because it’s his daydream, and admittedly, he enjoys the idea of Steve squirming to preserve his modesty. And he doesn’t start a crusade against himself, thinking about Steve like that. It doesn’t mean much; Steve’s a fit, strong, obnoxious person. Anyone would want to make him squirm.
He finds himself suddenly overcome by a morbid desire to touch the armor, for some kind of sense confirmation that any of this is real.
Steve goes back to ignoring him, and it’s probably for the best. Tony leans his head back against the rock and Steve goes back to pacing.
“Oh, uh. I can, I’ve got it. I can do that. Thank you, though, thanks,” Steve says, heat flooding to his cheeks. He feels crimson. He drops the sheet and fumbles with the towel, sopping up the soda on his pants, willing his confused body not to respond.
He wakes up again, and this time he’s more aware. It’s a blessing and a curse. He doesn’t hallucinate maggots, or wonder if he’s a piece of the floor. However, he has the presence of his mental faculties, enough to know how dire his situation is, and he thinks he’s dying. He doesn’t know how long he’s been here like this, but when you get close to that edge, you feel the the depth of the plunge. You hear the drafty, sucking void below. And you teeter.
Steve clamps his mouth shut, a vein popping out in his neck. He knows Tony’s right, and he has just enough respect not to snap back at the dying guy. Lightening his tone, Tony pats the ground beside him and says, “This might be the best thing to ever happen to you, Cap. You work too hard. Enjoy yourself. Relax. We’ll order mai tais and a message.”
He’s lucky that even Sam hadn’t been present in the moment of the reveal, that night on the rooftop, because Sam might be a skull. Steve realizes with a slow, crawling feeling that
“Oh, I didn’t need to cheat, don’t flatter yerself. The trick is simple math,” he chortled, not realizing the shit he had just stepped in. He placed the last gold piece on top of his stack, mighty pleased with himself.
The world feels like it’s falling away. His ears ring and he nearly drops his binoculars. Everything changes suddenly, like a switch flipped. This is bigger than he ever considered. He’s gutted by the guilty
But he waits. He doesn’t reach out through the encrypted comm line, even though he looks at the little number card every day. The paper has become creased and soft from being carried around in his pocket every day, and handled with such frequency. Steve has always had a thing about handwriting. Call him old-fashioned, or maybe a hippy-dippy artist at heart, but he thinks there's a lot of personality hidden in someone's penmanship. He doesn't buy into the bologna about being able to scientifically analyze someone based on their writing alone, but he thinks, there's something there. He stares at the string of numbers and the few letters and swallows every ink blot and flourish. The tiny smear where the ink hadn't yet been dry before Tony's hand passed over his own writing. Is the Tony he once knew
“Considering I thought you were already dead, I’m likely to give you plenty of slack,” Steve said. “Imagine the look on my face when I got back to the jailhouse and saw yer little message on my door.”
nothing. Maybe he’s in shock. Maybe he’s lost too much blood. Probably both. He looks to Sam and sees his own lost expression reflected back at him. They’re all lost, now.
If this is death, he wishes suddenly he had fought harder to live. He can’t stand an eternity of this. He never wanted to become a corpse. He’s rotting. Rotting. Rotten.
. Where the hell are you, on Christmas Eve?” Tony said under his breath. He didn’t have any weapon on him, (or a prayer of getting out of this in one piece), but did have a bottle opener in his pocket.
At least, not so much, when he had his particular set of skills and a knack for doing calculation in his head. And hell, if he had a run of good luck at poker once in a while, that ought to balance out the shit luck he seemed to have in all other areas of his life.
The golden stage lights look almost green in Tony’s blue eyes. He strolls up to the press podium and smiles at the cameras. He dazzles in the spotlight, perfect confidence.
He removes his shirt and slides it over Tony’s head. It’s enormous on him, but Tony’s skin is like ice and it feels wrong not to afford him the dignity of a little coverage.
Tony has half a mind to leave Hank a strongly worded text message about trying to control his wife, because the issue is so transparently the idea of Jan being alone with Cap and Tony for the day. Sure, Steve will be grinding his teeth to dust trying and failing to play diplomat, a bull in a china shop, and Tony will be hugging a trash can, puking his brains out between photo-ops, but somehow they’ll find time to spirit her away and seduce her out of her marriage vows. Sure, Hank.
He jerks awake, scowling, heart racing. There’s that disoriented moment between awake and asleep when he can’t quite connect the sound to a source, and he thinks someone has tracked him down. He calms when he realizes he’s still alone, and he notices the screen of his communicator alight.
Tony all along, they’re able to leverage this against SHIELD; Tony secures pardons for all surviving members of the resistance in record time. The hero prisons are shut down. The victims are released. Steve worries about him working himself back into a hospital bed, but at the same time, he’s familiar with the haunted look in Tony’s eyes, and he knows that Tony can’t rest until he’s righted some wrongs. Steve has the feeling as well. Guilt is a powerful motivator, and they both have a lot to atone for. Still, it’s hard to watch Tony hold himself accountable for things he
“Pardon me. Tryna get through, here. Christ, can’t you see I’m crippled? Git out of my way,” Tony mumbled, pushing his way toward his usual seat at the bar. He struggled to get through the crowd with his crutch, too many feet and elbows. Cursing, he started to lose his balance—
Steve helped Tony onto the back of his horse, and then mounted. They rode back to town, two to a saddle, Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s waist, early rays of sunlight warming their backs.
Steve stands up to leave. “Just so you know, I wouldn’t tell anyone. I won’t. If you’re worried about Natasha, you shouldn’t. People do crazy things, when they think they’re dying. I’ve seen it before. It doesn’t have to mean a thing. It’ll be like it never happened.”
“Still gotta get a word in, huh? Alright. I’d like to see you try talkin’ back without your teeth,” the bandit replied.
Steve’s stomach clenches when he remembers how he had reacted; he hadn’t believed a word out of Tony’s mouth. He’d suspected him of drinking, of having a nervous breakdown. He’d told him to get help. Tony had asked him for help.
They don’t realize that they’re fighting two wars— one against SHIELD and the Registration act, and one against an invasion that the world hasn’t even noticed yet.
And the more pressing concern comes to him in a haunted echo of a trembling voice. Tony, scared and unshowered and paranoid, like a deranged drunk in the streets. Looking over his shoulder. Buzzing like a firecracker.
Tony remembers to exhale when he gets dizzy holding his breath. What happens in the cave stays in the cave, he thinks. Briefly— guiltily— Natasha crosses Tony’s mind. Then, Steve unzips Tony’s pants and puts his hands on him, and Tony stops being able to hold a thought in his head.
He calls a meeting, and the tone is grim as the others trickle, in a few at a time. The toll that this war has taken on them all shows in the flesh. Arms in slings and butterfly stitches, violet bruised cheeks, and grey hairs, and glassy eyes. Too many empty chairs. So much lost.
“Why do you always have to do that?” he says, surprisingly sharp in tone considering how carefully he has been handling Tony. “The jokes, the comments, I’m not
Tony can’t blame her for this; they don’t talk about his health condition, usually. It’s the ugliest side of him, and Natasha is a stunning— and pragmatic— woman. It’s what makes her perfect for him. Tony is too proud, and a health amount of ashamed, to let her see him like this. Today has just been a helpful reminder of why: that pitying combination of discomfort and disgust. Her, in a hurry to leave and trying to pretend not to be, and Tony, obligated to act like it doesn’t bother him.
“Listen, she’s not coming. I’m just passing along the message, Rogers, don’t shoot the messenger,” Tony says. “She bailed, it is what it is. And it looks like it’ll be just you and me.” He holds the phone between his shoulder and his ear, messaging his opposite temple with one hand, and flagging down the bartender with the other.
“You wish,” Tony said, but he didn’t object as Steve walked with him to his seat, helping to part the crowds and keep Tony balanced. Tony wouldn’t admit it outright, but Steve was the only reason he had dragged his sorry ass out of bed this evening and hobbled down the street. He felt secretly pleased to run into him and catch his attention right away. There was something gratifying in getting what one came for.
The saloon had been transformed. After Steve had delivered Tony safely to the doctor’s doorstep and lingered long enough to be sure Tony would live, he left in a hurry. Tony had found it odd at the time— what could be so urgent? But in the course of just a few hours, his hard work had really paid off.
“I love you,” Tony says. Less certain of himself, like he’s lost his courage, but it’s too late to quit now. “I’m in love with you.”
The thing about rage is that it burns out, with time and distance. Smolders down, into something colder and more bitter, or gives way to whatever the real, underlying emotion had been in the first place.
“Well. I’m sure not the medical expert. As long as you’re okay. I’m glad you came. Means a lot to me. God knows everyone told me this party was a stupid idea, so it’s nice that you came,” Steve said. Tony stared at him for a minute, and then smiled crookedly.
“You never did say what the hell happened to you out there. What you got yourself tangled up in. And when I scraped yer ass off the rails, it didn’t seem like a good time to ask, seeing how you were still half drunk and stupid,” Steve said.
Even in the dimness of the morgue, the alloy of the faceplate shimmers, iridescent. A glint that Steve would know with his eyes closed, the unique molecular structure throwing light in
The suddenness of the movement snapped him out of his half-awake state. The ringing began to fade and reality came into clearer focus. Tony’s eyes were still shut, but he could make out the sound of unamused, breathy laughter, somewhere just above him.
“You’re not even trying,” Steve says, jaw tight. For the hundredth time since the sun rose, Steve looks up at the tiny window of sky visible through the mouth of the cave, at least twenty feet above their heads. If Tony could draw— and if he had a steadier hand— he would like to draw Steve from this angle. There’s something artistic about the view of his lantern jaw from below, stubbled but hardly, Adam’s apple bobbing as he anxiously swallows. His neck is too thick to fit both hands around, Tony bets. All muscle and tendons and vein.

He kneels at Tony’s side, but with a breath between them. Tony looks terrified and disoriented, and painfully breakable. He’s has lost a lot of weight, and and every bit of it shows because he’s been left totally nude. It isn’t pretty; his skin is grey and mottled purple, covered in sores and cuts and infections. Purple, scabbing track marks litter his neck, over what look to be healed needle marks. The room stinks, and Tony is covered in soot and his own filth. His hair is so oily that it looks wet. And no matter how hard Steve looks, something about Tony is translucent. Spectral.
too much a shift from the stuttering, paranoid mess he had been when they saw each other, that night in the ball field. The night Tony had given Steve that white card, which Steve still carries around like some kind of charm. Then there had been the off-color comment about the drink as if Steve would find it funny, and the sudden
Tony’s wondering the same thing on the inside; all the questions overwhelm him and he can’t get his heart to stop racing. The anxiety is suffocating— whether or not the
The rain grows colder and he sees his own breath. It gets dark. Tony slips into some kind of shock, maybe. He feels real nauseous. He feels really sick. He’s shaking hard, and it’s in part caused by the cold. What he needs is a drink. God, to die sober. What a cruel thing.
,” Tony says, panic and anguish in his face. Steve pulls him closer. Tony tenses in his arms, and then relaxes.
Steve finds it oddly appropriate. All he has left of Tony is a shell; all that feels left of himself is not much more.
Tony gains more weight. It’s a struggle, but with Steve around, they keep regular mealtimes. He stops looking quite so fragile, to Steve’s immense relief. He starts insisting on taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and Steve insists on going with him in case he needs helps halfway down. Tony loathes the coddling, so Steve is careful not to make a fuss about it when Tony gets winded and has to grip Steve’s hand for extra support on the last flight.
, whatever that meant, but it was a song that Tony had heard somewhere else. It brought Tony back to a previous life that he had all but erased from memory with the years of drink.
When Tony sends an encrypted message through a private communication line asking Steve to meet him to talk about how things will go forward, Steve debates telling Tony to go to hell. Then Tony sends a second message, promising he’ll be alone and unarmed. Insisting that he just needs to talk.
“On second though,” Tony said slowly, “Why don’t you walk me home, after all, Sheriff? And maybe… see me safely up to bed.”
“Get him fixed up,” said the bandit whose eyes Tony had spit in. He was beginning to regret that a tiny bit. Tony had a feeling that by ‘fixed up’, they didn’t mean lovingly tending to his wounds.
Tony’s first day of being an object is spent drugged out of his mind and bound tight enough to cut into skin. Mouth hanging open, tongue lolling. He barely remembers a minute of it, and it’s probably better that way.
he says out loud, testing his voice in the stillness. His echo apologizes back to him, muted and bouncing off the concrete walls,
“Hm?” Steve twisted his neck and looked where Tony was looking. Then, his ears turned red. “Oh. Yes. Mistletoe. Well. Not really. Hard to come by, out here. But it looks like mistletoe, ‘specially after I tied a ribbon round it, so I thought—”
As if something has finally occurred to him, Tony goes blank in the face, and self consciously straightens his posture. False confident shoulders. Head held high. No amount of posturing can erase that miserable look in his eye, but Steve would recognize this anywhere: Tony, putting on his true armor.
It’s impossible to say with certainty, even if he can guess based on the changes he had noticed as things got worse. Some range of times when Tony had stopped seeming like Tony. But the nature of the beast is that all of them had ceased to be themselves for a while. Their world had been ripped apart.
The upholstery smells like leather, and Tony's cologne. They don't talk as they drive. They don't talk as Tony pulls into a private parking garage and Steve can't stop looking for some sign they've been caught.
He pushed himself up out of the muck and stumbled a few steps in the direction of his smithy, where he lived in the second story. Drunk asshole. He zig-zagged like a scorpion, the mud making a sucking sound every time he wrenched his boot up from its grip. He could see his own front door, but with those guys watching him, he didn’t know if he
On an impulse, he puts his lips against Tony’s filthy forehead, and presses a tiny kiss to his skin. He smells real. Feels real. Tony doesn’t even stir.
A wolfish whistle rang out in the stillness and Tony’s heart leapt into his throat. Frantically, he scanned the blackness for his aggressors, but he couldn’t see jack shit beyond the boundary of the street. The faces of the buildings were mostly in shadow, as were all the spaces between them. He could hear the tell-tale jingle of a coin pouch, stuffed full. They must’ve gone back and picked up Tony’s (rightful) poker earnings, as well as their own cash. That would explain the hold up. After all, one couldn’t travel very far in these parts without a full wallet, or you’d be hard pressed to get by. A group like them would never leave their money behind.
It’s quick and dirty, nothing reverent about it except the look in Steve’s face when Tony breathlessly demands he look up at him, holding eye contact as Tony builds to a finish.
“Least there’s no train,” Steve said. “Else I’d be in a bigger hurry to rescue you.” He started in again with the blade, sawing back and forth, hacking through layers of rope frightfully close to Tony’s own flesh.
This Tony has a different fighting style; he’s crueler and blunter. Clumsier as a pilot, but the smart armor makes up for this disadvantage. Steve could tell the difference between the real Tony piloting a suit of armor and any imposter. They’ve fought together too many times.
Joe stands up and throws the needle at the trash bin full of paper, which has already burned down to ash. Tony spasms weakly on the floor. Tony gags involuntarily, and he hears a record scratch sound, but he isn’t sure if it’s real. Big spots of darkness bloom, ink blots across his vision. Everything splits into fractals.
He had been confused by landing on such a radically different side of things from his closest friend, but he
“You need to get help,” Steve says. He doesn’t know what else to say, and in the moment he can’t sort out concern and pity and anger. He feels helpless and wants to get out of this interaction. A twinge of guilt pulls at his heart, but it's clouded by anger and disappointment; Tony was supposed to see Steve's side, tonight.
The third man was huge and mute, and he glared at Tony with one eye twitching. He put out his smoke on the floor of the saloon.
“If this is good enough for me, it should be good enough for you,” Steve says, “Since I’m the one with a bounty on my head.”
Steve calmly follows Tony down the hall, into the large, modern bedroom. Something about the way Tony loosely grips the bottle neck between two long fingers makes Steve anxious. Tony quickly darkens the windows, and seats himself on the edge of his enormous bed. There’s a stack of papers on the bedside table. Tony sets his drink beside the papers, on a coaster. Steve glances around, and he feels like he’s seeing something not meant for his eyes. It’s incredibly intimate. What does Tony keep beside his bed? How many pillows does he use? How much dirty laundry is accumulated in the basket? What novel does he pick at when he can't get to sleep at night?
Around them, the party slowly transformed from a full-blown hoopla to something sedate, and serene. A lot of patrons trickled out over time, to sleep off their holiday meals and the booze, or to be with their families. The candles burned lower and eventually. Eventually, the fox-haired Mrs. Barnes dragged her husband away from the piano by the collar of his shirt and they disappeared together.
“All that pacing isn’t going to do anything but wear a track in the ground, darling,” Tony says in that cloyingly sweet tone that he knows grates at Steve’s nerves. Predictably, Steve’s scowl deepens, made more serious by the fresh blood crusted in his eyebrows hairs from the fresh cut on his face.
, Steve. Come on, now.” He says it in such a patronizing tone that Steve genuinely wonders if he had missed something obvious. He feels absolutely speechless. He feels like an idiot. His face burns. His heart hammers. God, what is he even doing here?
“I’m glad you’re alive,” Steve murmured. Tony dared to look up into Steve’s eyes, and saw his pupils wide and dark in the low light of the street. And he saw something else, too. His eyes shifted focus and right above Steve’s head was—
The relief is short-lived, and Steve is plagued by more questions than he has answers for soon after his discovery. His reality now a fallacy, he finds himself second guessing every thought he’s had, every decision he’s made. Repeating and analyzing throw-away interactions, trying to read meaning into every blink, sniff, and sigh.
this fact to the pissed-off idiot who had been gambling everything he had on the prayer of a statistically improbable straight.
When they first take him, they move him several times. Tony would not know this except that sometimes he opens his eyes, and if he's feeling really sharp, he notices the walls are a different color. Whatever they use to sedate him obliterates Extremis, and pushes him down into a kaleidoscopic stupor.
“Please,” He says, “Will you please just— Christ. This is pathetic. I’m fucking, I’m so fucking. Christ.” He paces, kicks dirt, wrings his hands. And then the manic energy vanishes, like a wrung out sponge. It's alarming to watch, in a perverse way. Steve is witnessing some kind of psychiatric episode, some imbalance tipping the scales in Tony right before his eyes.
Tony enters his penthouse late that night, presumably kept out late on some despicable SHRA business. He arrives in armor. Surrounded by snow, Steve suddenly draws a likeness in his mind between the armor and a Christmas ornament. Tony spends approximately two minutes between the elevator and entering his suite. He spends approximately four minutes out of sight entirely. Steve measures his breath and waits. He half wonders if Tony came in and went straight to sleep.
it’s a body retrieval mission, but some part of him has held out a modicum of hope that there’s a chance Tony is still alive, somehow. It’s stupid, and childish. Maybe intentionally self-delusional. Maybe Steve doesn’t know how to do anything without making it out to himself that it’s a for good cause.
Steve hooks his foot behind Tony’s ankle and ignores the screaming pain in all parts of his body as he brings Tony to the ground; the suit can’t predict a motion that Steve doesn’t indicate. The momentum topples the imposter, not accustomed to the weight of the armor, before his reflexes kick in. There isn’t a second to spare. Tony loses balance for a split second and Steve defies gravity. He throws himself onto Tony’s chest, pinning him to the ground with his thighs.
Hours later, the spell breaks and he catches himself hoarse and confused blinking visions away. Every time there is a pulse of shame when he realizes he’s been muttering to himself in an empty room.
Tony has to laugh, but it’s humorless and depressing. “Well, if I had to recall events, I would remind you that you had no interest in coming within ten feet of me until I reminded you that I would be too
Steve isn’t going to be happy, and Tony’s head is killing him. Early to the airport and dressed in Tom Ford, Tony makes camp at the bar and slurps at the dregs of a frozen margarita through a curly straw. Breakfast of champions.
It goes without saying, Tony thinks, that it’ll be a body recovery mission. Then again, Steve is just charmingly naive enough that perhaps he really believes there’s some long shot that he’ll find help and get them back here in time.
It all starts flooding back, then. Not everything, but enough. His strongest memories are of Steve, anyways. And Steve is all he needs. This he knows on a primal level, and the rest of the missing pieces don’t matter. It’s reflex, falling back on him.
He could never express how much he regrets. He still believes the Registration is wrong. He believes that things happened that didn’t need to happen. But things have changed; he’s seen that this is bigger than them, and that tearing each other apart doesn’t do any good. Tony had been right about one thing, and that was that they
But that’s not Steve; that’s never been what he really wants, even if the monster in him surfaces in moments of weakness. He thinks that sometimes his worst fears blur into his desires, and he tries to lend himself enough forgiveness to know how destroyed he would be if he ever truly hurt Tony.
It doesn't matter. The choppers descend. They'll be out for his blood. He only has one choice. He only ever has one choice.
“What’re you looking at?” Tony says, staring into the empty eye sockets of the skull. It stares back at him, jaw hanging at a sickening angle. “This is your fault, you know.”
“That’s what you get, huh?” Joe says, glancing over his shoulder as though someone might come in at any moment and tell him off. “We don’t need you anymore. You’re disposable now. And we only have time to take what we need.”
“Ah, the domineering leader is back,” Tony sighs. Despite the lack of a reaction, he knows Steve doesn’t miss the way Tony says it, a backhanded comment on how eager to get on his knees Steve had been. The memory might just be worth the early grave, a trophy conquest.
Steve’s startled, but then he shuts his eyes and leans into his, his hands going to Tony’s waist. He doesn’t feel like a skeleton anymore. He feels like a man, a substantial person, real. Warm. Whole. Steve’s not afraid to break him. Tony’s mouth is warm, and the tickle of his mustache makes Steve’s nose wrinkle involuntarily.
He first senses his visitor when he sees a reflection in the glass. Dark, sliding like an eel in a murky riverbed. Tony jolts and looks up, pulse quickening— but by the time he knows what’s happening, he’s too late to stop it.
With Extremis, and the power of modern medicine, Tony recovers physically in a few weeks, enough to be released from hospitalization. He’s still real thin when Steve sees him make his first re-appearance on TV, and he still walks like every step exhausts him. That far away look in his eyes appears when he’s not talking, and Steve wonders what Tony thinks about when he drifts away like that. In a sick way, it’s almost comforting to see him like this, in contrast with the memories Steve has of the skrull Tony strutting around with that sickening bravado. Tony doesn’t say much on the news, and he only answers carefully vetted, pre-planned questions, and Steve knows why.
What Steve knows, and what Tony does not say to the American people, is the truth. At that very moment, their friends,
“I was talking to Janet,” she says, reaching over Tony, her breasts hanging in his face almost distracting him too much to care that she’s pulling his wallet out of a small plastic bin on the nightstand. She pays Janet fifty dollars of Tony’s cash, and Tony feels distinctly like he’s outlived his usefulness.
There’s nothing to blame her for— she isn’t totally uncaring, but she isn’t the type to make things harder than they need be, like Tony. She feels in her own way. Processes things privately. The grieving widow act wouldn’t suit her, she would move on quickly, and it was one of the things that drew him to her— he didn’t want to ruin a life on his way out the door.
They climb up the back stair case, and he’s not even a Trojan horse, he’s just here because he's trusting Tony. He carefully modulates the joy inside himself; he keeps it small and holds it in his chest, like a bird’s fluttering wing. He will not celebrate until they’re both on the same side for sure and this nightmare is over, but his heart can’t be told so easily. There’s something irreparably irrational about how Tony makes Steve feel. Everyone has a weakness.
"Is what real?" Steve asks, blinking awake. He had dozed off in the office. Tony had been reading something. Steve had been pretending to sign papers, but he had finished hours ago.
directly Tony is capable of receiving a message, these days. As if Steve needs the reminder of Extremis.
Tony grimaces; he’s only had the one drink, and with his tolerance, it does nothing to settle his nerves or dull the throbbing in his skull that just seems to get worse and worse. After spending his morning hungover and sick from chemo, he hadn’t been able to hold down anything but a few sips of ginger ale in the car riding over to the airport.
“Sounds like we’re going to get more weather,” Tony says with a grin. He’s starting to lose the thread, a little. He tastes blood on his teeth and he knows he must look ghastly, smiling like that in the dark. There’s just something intangibly humorous about the situation. You have to laugh, sometimes.
gentle hiss of hydraulics. Something Steve never told Tony, or anyone else, for fear of seeming strange: to Steve's enhanced senses, the unique molecular structure of the metal of the armor has a smell. Something subtle, faint. Distinctly Tony's, despite belonging to his second skin, and not his blood-and-bone body.
He hears footsteps outside his room, running past the door. And more. Back and forth, muffled voices, an energy of unrest. Then, Tony hears a key hurriedly jammed into the lock. The door flies open. He looks up in hazy confusion as Joe runs into his cell, not even bothering to shut the door behind himself. Tony catches his first glimpse of what the hall outside his room looks like; it’s also concrete, and it looks like a residential basement. Dark, plain, and unimpressive He has built this place up in his mind to be some kind of impenetrable, isolated fortress. He had assumed he was in a bunker of some kind. Maybe out in the mountains somewhere. Tony feels disoriented.
She probably wouldn’t have even wasted precious time lingering at the mouth of the cave to keep Tony company before he drifted off to what would have been his death.
to spread rumors about your fragile masculinity. And I recall you suddenly jumping on the chance to get your mouth on me, with that safeguard in place— How did we put it? Dead mean don’t tell tales? I’m trying to job my memory, you’ll have to forgive me. I’ve got some brain problems.”
crazy, or that people will think so. He feels unstable enough that he might not know the difference. Right now, a lot rides on his being competent and capable, or at
the real Tony at all. Perfect confidence. Shining facade. Tony’s real armor has always been his TV-smile.
You’re asking my to arrest people who risk their lives for this country, every day of the week,” Steve says, barely able to contain his disdain. Pinched brow. Narrow eyes. Adrenaline making everything sharp and still. He takes inventory of her agents in his peripheral vision. Too many. Rabid dogs. Maria looks so relaxed.
Tony says that he’s never gone this long without a drink, and Steve is quiet for a long time as they start the trudge across the barren, unforgiving landscape.
Saying it makes it more real, though, in a visceral way Tony hadn’t anticipated. Steve’s shoulders curl in, softening, some tension dissipated; both of them are exposed, now. But Steve’s hold on Tony tightens, knuckles white, hard enough to hurt.
He backed up against the door, but he was truly cornered. The third man— the huge, silent one— knocked the bottle opener out of Tony’s hand. He grabbed him by the collar and dragged him down the steps.
“Seems so,” Steve said. He thanked the barkeep quietly and paid the man for their drinks— something Tony found bizarrely endearing. Of course Steve would have to pay upfront; the Sheriff didn’t have a tab. He didn’t drink often enough.
Steve still cries, and he can’t stop himself. The feeling overwhelms him, it just comes rushing in and he drowns in it all at once.
Tony lies on his back, his burns arm aching but in a distant way, the broken leg numb and heavy. He takes casual inventory of the sensations mentally. Jarvis stands just behind Steve, just out of the spot of sunlight, holding a silver tray of martinis. Tony licks his lips, bone dry.
A week later, the curfew is pushed up again. 9 PM. CNN runs a piece about people being harassed by agents in the streets; the footage is horrifying.
At long last, Tony was left alone. His killers left him to die, and all that remained was the lingering scent of tobacco and the fading drum of horse hooves against the earth.
Steve’s heart starts racing immediately. He sits up in bed, enveloped in velvet darkness. It feels to good to be true. Please, God, let it be true.
“I think I’d be left stateside to keep all the girls company. Not sure they draft soldiers with tumors pressing on their brains,” Tony says cheerfully. “Might affect my decision making.”
Then the needle prick, a skrull drawing his blood, then the scene changes again. He’s crying and his mouth tastes like bourbon, and he just wants Ty to
Steve takes the card. “You need to get help, Tony,” Steve says again. He holds it like a live grenade.
Tony gave an experimental tug at his bonds; it was useless. They really tied him down tight. The most hilarious thing of it was that Tony was more likely to die of exposure, or have his face eaten off by a coyote, before any train rolled over him. The train only
(Tony didn’t enjoy what happened next. He spit three teeth and a mouthful of blood out onto the mud.)
He placed his other hand on the small of Tony’s back, just hardly touching. Hovering, ready to catch him again as needed.
“—But now,” Steve whispers, gently wiping his own tear off of the faceplate and setting it back on the table, “I can’t.”
He arrives to the street he traced the message to. The neighborhood is mostly abandoned. The windows of many of the houses have been covered up with graffiti’d plywood, and the inhabited ones have curtains drawn tight, and chain link fences between the street and the front door.
Tony discovers his fully stocked bar cabinet. Steve had forgotten, with everything else going on, until he walks into Tony's kitchen with a bag of bagels and finds Tony kneeling on the cold tile floor, turning a half-finished bottle of bourbon over in his palms. Steve's heart leaps into his throat. He automatically assumes the worst.
“I should be here as a second set of eyes on the paperwork,” Steve suggests. Tony never argues; this is, after all, always what he wanted. Steve doesn’t coddle when it comes to the work. He takes red pen to the stacks of legislature and forms and speeches and approvals. He tears them to shreds and makes few concessions, and Tony makes every change Steve demands, and there’s surprisingly little to talk about. Sometimes Steve wonders, always after the fact, if Tony remember how to object. If Steve's inadvertently taking advantage of some defensive passivity that developed in their time apart.
“This is exactly why I— forget it,” Steve says, his exasperation loud and clear even through the phone, “I’m leaving you here, I’ll handle the meeting alone.”
They’re losing numbers. They’re losing morale. They’re losing. And whatever is happening, Tony’s at the center of it. Tony and some kind of secret. Steve becomes obsessed with the idea of a change, but he says nothing to his colleagues. He’s sure they’re not too dense not to notice, but they grant him the dignity of not mentioning Steve’s rapid decline into obsessive paranoia.
He plucks the straw out of his glass and tips the salted rim to his lips, downing the last swallow of slush. This leaves Tony and Steve, going alone, and he hasn’t actually broken the news yet; he briefly considers telling Steve that Jan cancelled just as the plane takes off, but Steve might just jump out of the plane.
As much as it pained him to turn his back to the open air, he whirled around to face the jailhouse door. He dragged the sharp tip of the bottle-opener against the chipped paint of wooden door.
“I’ll pay,” he said to the barkeep. Then, to Tony, stern, “Just this once, Stark, it’s on me. And don’t get used to it.”
Tony isn’t too naive to consider the possibilities logically, but they’re not married yet. She wouldn’t be entitled to any of his money, as far as she would know. (He has, of course, edited his will to heavily include her, but that’s neither here nor there, since she doesn’t know about it.)
It pours in slow motions, almost glowing in the narrow beam of natural light falling toward the center of the cave. Steve stands there as if in a broken spotlight, frowning at the sky, his ruined uniform turning dark with water.
“Quiet,” Steve says, brows pinched together. The press appearance hadn’t been announced in advance, and all their espionage channels have been quiet. None of them know what this is about, and there is a nervous energy in the safe house. A lot of the group is milling around in the common area, and Steve feels them tacitly waiting for some kind of reassurance. They look to him, their leader. So much has been lost. Spider-man in his tattered suit, lip still split and eye bruises, identity burned for a lost cause, is living proof enough.
“I wish you were here, right now. I know you’re probably gone. But you deserve a proper burial. You deserve better than this,” Steve says to the inanimate faceplate. “I knew there would be a war. When Maria told me about the Act, I knew it would split us all down the middle. I knew it would destroy us. But I never expected how. I don’t think I could have. You did, I think. I think I see that, now. Sometimes you do things that I don’t understand. I don’t see ahead like you do. But I see where we’ve been.”
Steve continues, “Whatever is next, we’ll do that together. Whatever the answer it, whatever the way out of this, it’ll take both of us. And that means getting you somewhere safe. You need to rest. You need medical care. You need to recover—”
SHIELD’s investigation into the skrull invasion is so secret that the number of people working on it can be counted on one hand. Tony can’t say much about his experience without compromising the investigation, and while it’s obviously painful for him not to be able to distance himself from the atrocities committed by his double, there’s some level of relief, too, that he’s excused from explaining himself.
He breaks into the morgue, and it’s no easy task. Top clearance and security; SHIELD doesn’t want the skrull incident to get out yet. Steve imagines they had been in for a shock when they found the body left behind.
“You have to stop this,” Steve says. (Later, he will regret this. He’ll regret not making Tony finish his thought.
“No, thank you. I’m fine,” Steve says. Tony opens the fridge and grabs a soda for himself. He pops the metal lid on the edge of the counter top, and the carbonation hisses. Tony wraps his lips around the mouth of the bottle, and Steve sudden'y can't tear his eyes away. Steve watches Tony’s Adam’s apple bob as he takes a long swig of the beverage. Steve looks down and clear his throat.
The empty suit of armor has been laid out on the coroner’s table like a corpse. The body of the skrull inside is in a drawer; Steve doesn’t need to see it. The parasite has been removed, and Tony himself is still dust in the wind. Steve spends a few slow breaths standing barely inside the room, with the door open at his back. The light behind him from the hall casts a long shadow across the concrete floor. He exhales. He steps fully inside. He lets the heavy door fall shut with a muted thud and an icy rush of air. Then all is still; all is stale. All quiet and dark in a room for the dead.
. He had been fighting with Steve. Something important. But how important could it really have been?
He started to lose his balance and his body reacted, reaching out jerkily to grab onto something. The nearest something turned out to be Steve’s arm. Steve took it in stride.
When he tries to speak, he chokes on hot liquid in his throat. Turning his head to the side, he spits out what turns out to be a mouthful of blood— and what he thinks might be the tiniest chunk of his own tongue— onto the gravel.
Tony shrugs, noticing how Steve has skillfully diverted the conversation back off of himself. “I don’t think I would have agreed to join the team is I was fully in my right mind.” He plays it off like a joke, but there’s more truth than he’s comfortable admitting.
“Your paymasters going soft, Tony?” Steve spits out, overwhelmed with outrage. He can’t even stand to look at Tony’s face, even with the faceplate covering most of his features.
There’s another raid. This time, they lose three of their numbers. SHIELD only shows two of them cuffed and imprisoned on live TV, and that night, they hold a moment of silence for the third because they already know what must have happened.
“’M sorry,” Tony says. “Sorry.” Steve’s face screws up in heartbreak. This isn’t about him, right now. He tries to put himself on the back burner. Whatever distress he’s feeling, seeing Tony like this, can’t compare to whatever Tony has been through. Still, it’s impossible to control his reaction when Tony’s blubbering apologies with vomit on his chin.
blessed memory replays the sense memory; warm, calloused hands, the smell of espresso and aftershave and engine oil. Hands touch. Replay. Their hands had touched. Over and over, like a skipping record.
“Yeah, well. The good doctor said it was nothin’ serious. Just a few fractures and some bruising. And I figured if I was gonna live to see another day, y’know. Might as well come see what all the fuss is about.” Tony was downplaying it a little; Dr. Banner had given him explicit instructions to limit his movement and rest until his ribs got better, and he was going to be watching Tony for any sign of internal bleeding in the abdominal area. The missing teeth were a problem that had no easy answer. Tony was just grateful they didn’t show when he spoke or smiled.
“The skrull,” Tony says, pinched, troubled expression, as if suddenly remembering. “There’s a skrull, Steve. It isn’t really me. There was a double.”
Tony tapped the bar and held up a finger to the bartender. The bartender started to pull out Tony’s tab, but Steve raised a hand to stop him.
Steve freezes, holding in a breath. Nobody knows how to find him anymore. As well as the world knows, Steve Rogers had fallen off planet Earth months ago. This shouldn’t be possible. His pulse quickens. He sweeps his long, dirty hair out of his eyes and opens the message, squinting at the brightness in the dark.
in people believing it. The joke is that Tony has historically been the least stable of the Avengers, even on his best day. He’s all loose threads, the drink, the paranoia, the nightmares, the guilt, the anxiety, the crippling fear of abandonment— and he can’t seem to stop himself unravelling. Frayed.
“Trust me,” Tony sighs, fishing his American Express out of his wallet, and trying to ignore the pulsing in his temples, “I’m paying for it already.”
“So,” Steve slowly comes across the room and lowers himself into the chair beside the bed. “I did breaths and compressions while I waited for the medics. Took them an hour. Apparently, everything’s regulated, nowadays. Can’t even take a shit without the government hearing about it. I asked them, why not just throw down the rope and pull us back up the old fashioned way? They said— they said to me, while I was trying to
It is, perhaps, a new low for Tony. Having survived the crash, he crawls back into the burning wreckage, looking for something. His phone? Something to build a signal with? The radio? No. In that moment, nerves fried, adrenaline blunting logic, Tony is looking for the flask he had seen clipped to the pilot’s belt.
“Sher’ff,” he called, half shouting, half suppressing his voice, throwing an anxious look over his shoulder. “Sheriff. Steve! Open up!”
It’s dark and Tony’s lagging; he hadn’t noticed just how much he’s slowing them down until he stumbles and Steve doesn’t even break pace, just keeps dragging him along.
“Charming, obviously. Large and in charge, you know the type, you almost pull it off,” he says. Soon, his own voice will be all he has left to keep himself company; Steve’s going to leave him here. “Serial womanizer, who can blame him. Alien chicks are kinky. More legs, more fun.”
It’s his personal apocalypse. He can't remember ever being so scared in the war. Back then, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, it felt like he would live forever. Now he knows that he can-- but it's a long and lonely life, when those around you just keep dying. He can’t lose anyone else. Even his physiologically enhanced brain is only capable of processing so much grief.
Tony looks at Steve over his shoulder, fingers bunched up and fiddling with the edge of his blanket. Steve suddenly feels less than two inches tall, and utterly ashamed with himself. He sees it in Tony's eyes, that he knows he's a burden.
It ends too fast but it’s probably for the best. Tony goes boneless, after, every ounce of energy sapped from him. Exhausted and sated, he sighs, tipping his head back against the cliff wall to catch his breath. Steve even has the manners to clean Tony up when he’s done, with his mouth, and he doesn’t draw attention to it when Tony’s too drained to get hard again.
He squats in filthy, damp places at night. He doesn’t wash his clothes. He’s so deep underground that he doesn’t even show his face in corner stores or bodegas when he can avoid it. It’s like Steve Rogers had never existed, and that’s just fine by him.
They don’t have to say much, but they spend almost every hour of the day in each others’ quiet companionship. And sometimes, after staying up too long and overexerting himself, if Tony falls asleep with his head on Steve’s shoulder, paperwork and takeout containers sprawled out on the coffee table in front of them, Steve doesn’t mind. He doesn’t move him, he just lets him sleep. He figures, he needs the rest. He figures, if Tony feels so safe in Steve's presence, he should be flattered.
“Think you’ve been out here long enough. You’re goddamn ice cold, and you sound like shit,” Sheriff Rogers said. The jostling started again. The ropes pinched and bit at him, even through his clothes, and his broken rib severely objected.
Tony says, “With the cooperation of our government, effective immediately, SHIELD will be conducting increased surveillance in areas of high risk, and we will be temporarily enforcing curfew hours in the city—”
Tony closes his eyes, letting his head sink into the pillow. He’s ashamed, for a second, of how much better he feels with Steve sitting beside him in companionable silence. It’s better than he deserves, but he’s selfish enough to take it. He has a lot to think about tomorrow but for now, he pushes the thoughts down. Letting the drugs slide over him, he goes to sleep.
” Steve asks, incredulously. Not for the first time, Tony regrets Steve’s resistance to just communicating via text, like everyone else in this century.
“Mm. I’m right behind you, just gotta limber up,” Tony says. He’s as limp as a rag doll. Steve’s face is lost in its own shadow, but Tony can tell he isn’t smiling. “You don’t believe me?”
The false Tony Stark steps closer, and in the moment— terrified and hurt, bleeding— Tony looks up at himself and thinks,
Joe ignores him. He tears out pages from another notebook and drops them on the fire, muttering under his breath, “
Tony smiles, empty. “I hope not,” Tony says. He starts to turn to leave, but pauses. He clears his throat. “And Steve?”
“Not this guy again,” Sam says behind Steve, “I’m starting to think he likes the sound of his own voice.”
“Ah. That's refreshing. But, you know. Suit yourself,” Tony says. He wipes his mouth on the back of his sleeve. “I guess you want to get down to brass tacks, then.”
Okay, maybe it’s not politically correct, but Tony laughs. And laughs. And laughs. Because, come on. It’s not nice, but it’s sort of true. “He doesn’t mean it, Steve, don’t you worry. Always had a way with words. He tends not to like my overnight guests,” Tony explains, “God, yo’ve seen how he grumbles whenever Natasha’s in the room.”
But then, he parts his cracked, dry lips and tilts his chin toward the sky. Water runs down his jaw, leaving trails in the dust and blood and soot caked to his skin. He swallows, mouth overflowing with rain; for a moment, Tony forgets his own pain, distracted by Steve’s whisper quiet sigh of pleasure.
“You’re in the hospital, sunshine,” Jan says, stepping into Tony’s line of vision. “Alive and well. Thank God.”
“I came. I'm here. What do you need?” Steve asks, choosing to cut straight to business. Tony's mouth curls into a barely-there grin.
Steve is so mad he sees red in the moment. It’s strategically brilliant, of course; there is no integrity in it at all.
, taking Steve for a guilt trip when lives are being ruined, lives being lost. He wants to throttle him, and scream
Just when he thinks the agenda is settled for the day, it rapidly goes to hell. It’s not even a real mission; the Ultimates had been scheduled ahead of time to do a short tour of some speck-on-the-map European country, shake some hands, and make nice with a certain foreign dignitary. Incidentally, the very same foreign dignitary happens to be the last on Nick Fury’s wish-list of politicians in not-yet his pocket. Regardless, it isn’t meant to be such a struggle.
Between the endless work on legislature and pardons and haggling with politicians, and Steve’s involvement in Tony’s (still a work in progress) recovery, they fall into a sort of comfortable rhythm. Things aren’t like they were before, but they’re not really worse. It’s just different. Steve knows he isn't perfect. He isn't the best caretaker. He doesn't have the training to tiptoe around the trauma in the right ways, and he knows sometimes he does more harm than good. But he learns, and he listens, and he thinks it's going to be okay.
Steve’s beard grows in and his hair gets too long. His suit becomes filthy. His face grows weathered and thin from working tirelessly for a lost cause. His tongue probes the hole where one of his missing teeth should be.
He was fucking precious. Steve might be the only beacon of light in a dark, dark place. There was something about him— the obnoxious, constant idealism, the stubbornness, the unabashed commitment to making things better, (a lost cause in Tony’s opinion.)
Then someone leaks it, a picture of the skrull’s green corpse in the damaged armor, and the world explodes.
The TV is on, and Steve is frozen in place watching as Tony’s image steps onto the screen. The golden stage lights make him glow. He strolls up to the press podium and smiles at the cameras. He dazzles in the spotlight, and Steve is one of the small handful on earth who know how false his public persona truly is; the world may know that Tony Stark
“We’re gonna die,” he says. He should have drank the damn margaritas; God knows the pilot hadn’t deprived himself.
He hasn’t changed clothes or slept since he saw Steve. Come to think of it, he hasn’t had a proper meal, either. The sunrise this morning had been exquisite, and Tony had spent it fighting roiling nausea after a few hours spent terrorized by the nighttime. He keeps refilling the same glass with ginger ale (and pretending there's something more in it.)
“I know. I know you’re not,” Steve treasures, practically lying on him to keep him from hurting himself, “You’re not like that. Natasha isn’t here. Nobody knows.”
Steve lingers close to the bedroom door, just a few steps inside, arms crossed over his chest. He points to the stack of papers and folders. “Is that it?”
Tony’s eyebrows pinch together, and he looks so baffled that he almost looks mad. It’s cute, the way he pinches his face up when he’s really thinking. That serious, furrowed brow. But then he swiftly throws his arms—
Tony seems uncomfortable, and stops six feet short of Steve. He keeps glancing over his shoulder, as if someone had followed him.
Fear played tricks on his nervous system. Shadows slid together, dancing inches peripheral vision. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead; the light in the window of the jailhouse was his beacon. Any second Sheriff Rogers would burst outside and fire off a warning shot.
That isn’t to say that Steve ever unplugs from the news. He is obsessive, following any and every broadcast about the limbo-like status of the SHRA, now that its figurehead and the figurehead of its opposition have both vanished. Steve and Tony’s absences have shaken the world. Without leadership, it seems both sides have taken a pause as they regroup and figure out their next steps. Steve watches C-SPAN on stolen iPhones, and it appears that approval for SHRA has come to a confused halt in the wake of the news breaking that Tony might not have actually been involved with every step that the government
The crawling, creeping feeling eats him away to nothing. He struggle to focus his mental energy in any other direction. Put himself into the work, put himself into charity, put himself into constantly fiddling with Extremis. Making notes, dreaming up improvements. He's never been
long— Steve has no idea when the switch was made, what has been Tony and what has been done fraudulently in his name.
Once more, smug, Tony pats the space beside him in invitation. “Want to come out of that rain before you catch your death?”
Steve had been the fool, and it isn't fair to blame anyone but himself. Steve remembers how long and hard Tony fought to keep his own identity in the shadows. Steve hasn’t forgotten. Maybe he’s the only one to see the hypocrisy in that.
Someone in the room curses. Steve’s blood runs cold. His first thought is that he can’t believe what he’s hearing. His second thought is of Goliath’s loved ones seeing this.
he had let himself believe. Their values are even more radically different than he had let himself see, and he had always been able to reconcile this by telling himself that at
Tony feels childish for being so bothered; this had always been the only outcome, and yet that doesn’t take sting out of the abandonment. He plays it off like he doesn’t care at all.
“S’pose I earned that,” Tony breathed. It came out like a sort of sigh and a whine, instead of sounding like words.
Talking hurt bad, and he burst into a fit of coughing to punctuate his point. Sheriff raised an eyebrow and shook his head. The rope finally severed, and the unbearable pressure on Tony’s chest vanished. He gasped like a fish. Steve frowned, and ceased motion until it passed. He rubbed slow, small circles into his shoulder to soothe the coughing fit.
He locks his doors and triple checks them every night. He lies in bed, trying to sleep some nights, but the feeling of being Watched comes over him like a tangible shadow, and it becomes unbearable. When this happens, he turns on all the lights. He checks all security feeds. And then double checks. (And then he checks the locks again.)
He inhales a lungful of that familiar smell and sighs, reaching up absentmindedly to twist a strand of her hair around his finger. Natasha gently bats his hand away.
The remaining coins skittered off in every direction, gleaming as they bounced. His whiskey glass shattered as it hit hard wood. The poker cards fluttered to the ground around him, like white and red feathers.
He watched Steve process what Tony was really suggesting, and his thicks eyebrows shot up. He swallowed. And he smiled, flushed.
Something about the way the smile doesn’t reach her eyes, almost undetectable behind the tinted lenses of her glasses. Icy green, stunningly beautiful, always somewhat cold— it doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel just because she’s got a certain kind of look about her. Yet.
He helps Tony drink until he splutters, and water runs down his clavicle. He coughs for a long time, gasping and choking, his bony rib cage heaving for air, so hard Steve irrationally worries about him breaking himself. Steve doesn’t think twice before putting a hand on the knobs of Tony’s spine and rubbing slow circles into the skin. Then he realizes that physical contact may be distressing, after God knows what hell Tony’s been through— but that was what his mother used to do for him, when he couldn’t catch his breath. That feels like forever ago, now.
“I learned my lesson alright—” Tony grunted. A boot behind the knees toppled him. He landed in the dirt on his chest, wind knocked out of him.
“Act like a bitch, get treated like a bitch,” the scar-faced man said from the sidelines as Tony was laid across the tracks. He shut his eyes, willing the nausea to pass.
Instead, he picks up a magazine, the one from the top of the stack, and opens to a random place. Thumbing through the pages, he pretends to be interested in a year old edition of
“Ain’t someone just the luckiest bastard in the West,” the mustached man’s friend— skinny with a facial scar— said suspiciously.
It’s such a classically heroic thing to say, almost a caricature of the legend— Captain America, stars, stripes, and courage. What an odd pair they make; Tony, so wrapped up in silk and smoke and feathers he can’t remember how to be genuine, and Steve, who seems to be exactly who he claims to be, at every moment of every day, like it’s no choice. Before they defrosted him, Tony wouldn’t have believed that it wasn’t at least partially an act— the man from the newsreels giving soap box speeches, rallying the troops to choose their patriotic duty and find glory in death.
There was one small satisfaction. He’d be gone soon, but ever since he took up drinking the way he did, he had become wonderfully ambivalent about his own mortality.
“Don’t do this,” he wheezes, and there’s not an ounce of smugness left. Tony’s voice. A perfect copy.
“That I’ll keep my mouth shut, you mean?” Tony asks. It comes out much sharper than he intends. “I’ll be you were kind of hoping, just a little bit, that I’d stay brain dead in here, huh? Just to be safe? What happens in the cave stays in the cave, and all that? I bet you’re pretty disappointed. Heaven knows I would be, if I were you.”
Understanding flickers across Steve’s face. He exhales. “Ah,” and his expression softens— infuriatingly kind, after every horrible thing Tony’s sad. The sort of kindness he wants to mistake for pity so he can shut himself off from it, safer alone.
At some point, they seemed to realize this. Steve looked around the wreckage, assessing the aftermath of his hard work. Streamers littered the floor, empty glasses on every table, peanut shells and cigar stumps and orange peels. Tony wondered how much Steve had to pay and plan in advance to get a crate of oranges for the night. Tony suddenly felt an ache that had nothing
Steve never ordered a second whiskey, and his cheeks took on a rosy sheen after just the first. He was smiling a lot, too— but appropriately concerned and judgmental at certain points during Tony’s tale.
“I’ll be okay,” Tony said, but he didn’t release his grip on Steve. Steve’s hand came to rest on the small of Tony’s back. Something shifted in the air, an electric charge between them that Tony hadn’t felt in so long he couldn’t remember its name.
“Thank you for caring so much, but there was nothing to worry about,” Tony says, eyes darting toward Steve, “I was in good hands.”
Steve guides them through the uneven terrain strewn with jet parts. “I’m going to try and figure something out to carry water with,” Steve says, stepping over a rock and stumbling.
“I know what you are,” Steve grits out, low enough that only Tony can hear him. His voice is thick and hot, on the verge of tears from sheer exhaustion. He brings the Shield down over the face plate, over and over and over. It must be disorienting enough that Tony— not-Tony— can do nothing but flail his arms in a discoordinated attempt to wrench Steve off of him. The face plate crumples and Steve rips it off, shoulders heaving.
Tony does a broadcast about a humane new program called Resistance Re-Education Training, which he’s planning to implement in the prisons. Steve doesn't want to think too hard about what this means.
Steve clears his throat, visibly uncomfortable. Unlike the girls, Steve looks like he hasn’t had a full night of sleep in a week. Tony notices a few things at once: his shirt’s on inside out, the tag sticking out just under his chin, and there are dark circles under his eyes. Despite having obviously showered, he hasn’t taken the time to shave— light blonde stubble has grown out all over his jaw. It’s funny looking.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again, out loud. The dark eye slits stare back at him. He’s not used to seeing the helmet without Tony’s blue eyes behind those slits. He doesn’t know if he’s ever looked at the armor so carefully, up close, without Tony in it before. He’s never thought of it as an object, but as an extension of Tony. How wrong it feels to treat it now like some inanimate thing.
He tries to think of what he would say if Tony could hear him now. The realization strikes him, how this is a fool’s errand. There is no closure here. No satisfaction, no catharsis, no absolution. He has never felt so acutely
He may have been mistaken when he used to think he was a person; he suspects that maybe, he has just been a confused piece of floor all along. He lays there a long time, weak, dizzy, head throbbing; he can’t quite remember how to make his muscles move. Twitching his fingertips seems an impossible task.
. With tentative fingers, he pushes the hair out of Tony’s face, and his own heart beats faster. He doesn’t think he’s ever felt such a strong need to protect somebody.
Tony sips when Steve puts the water to his lips but it only upsets his stomach. Steve looks satisfied, anyways, feeling like he’s doing something to help.
And he thinks it long enough that his dehydrated, sensory deprived mind conjures the sensation of his flesh crawling away. Despite the total absence of light, he watches maggots crawl across his arms, and he feels mushrooms sprout from his mouth.
Steve goes all the way underground. He's smoke in the wind. He doesn't say goodbye to anyone. The news speculates about his
It gets easier when he lets himself acknowledge that he needs Tony's company just as much as Tony needs his, and that they're both vulnerable right now. But he isn't any more likely to fix Tony than Tony is to fix Steve.
“Let’s take ‘im out back,” the man with a scar said. Tony gagged and stumbled, his feet trying to keep up with their pace to save himself hanging by his own collar and dragging in the mud.
Steve doesn’t react, using the force of his body to pin Tony against the ground, forcing him to be still.
Their Judas comes in shining armor and his army, but Steve notices distinctly fewer of his actual friends on the devil's side. Carol is gone. Jen is gone. Reed. All of them. It’s mostly just Tony and SHIELD agents. That makes Steve feel marginally better. He tightens the strap of his shield, securing it to his arm. He’s ready to go down fighting, and he can hold on to the fact that in the end: it’s not heroes against heroes. It’s heroes against SHIELD and an imposter. God knows how many imposters. If they’ve replaced Tony, Steve has to assume any number of SHIELD and government higher-ups could be imposters as well.
He chokes. His vision blurs. He could lie down beside the corpse and close his  eyes and pretend they're both asleep, until Steve slips away to that other place. As broken as he is now, he still can't quite believe he'd ever  be allowed the release of death.
“You’re not the first, Stark,” he says; the way his voice drops low sends a chill up Tony’s spine, “And you won’t be the last.”
He had spent his morning on the bathroom floor smelling his own vomit, and he isn’t exactly proud of how fast his mood had plummeted into a dark and lonely place. A man in his position should be better adjusted to the crippling despair of perpetual loneliness, chronic illness and the expiration date stamped in red on life. Sobbing in the fetal position in his underwear, and spitting up bile, the only thing that had motivated him to scrape himself up off the floor was the fact that the Ultimates
The figure standing at the foot of his bed is a mirror image of himself, but better groomed, smiling with something like pity in his cold, green-tinted eyes.
He chooses his words carefully. Breathless, with a curious grin, he says, “Because I’m right. And I’m not the first to catch on. You’re not as—” he watches Steve’s expression, “
Tony goes still beneath him. Silent. The fighting around them has died down, too. The air is still and quiet, dark in an all encompassing haze of smoke. There is only death, here. Nothing lives.
“Now, I know you don’t think of me as the most honest man. And god knows I’ve got a filthy conscience. But in my book, I really did win those poker games fair and square,” Tony explained, tongue in cheek, “So arrest me if I’m wrong, but you can
Steve sighed and bit his lip. “I tell you, what I really would like for Christmas would be a chance to get at the bastards who did this to you—” he said, “—Even if you
Tony wonders if Joe had been tasked to put him down; it seems like he’s taken it upon himself to make sure Tony suffers as much as possible on the way out the door, and there is no recourse. No one will spare a second glance into his cell and notice his heart still beating as they abandon ship. And he knows already no one will rescue him. (No one ever does.)
SHIELD agents in helicopters tranq several members of the resistance group, but they leave Steve standing— intentionally, he realizes. For a moment, Steve has the opportunity to see, first hand, how many of his once trusted friends had agreed to betray him tonight. Standing in the field of burning rubble, his allies unconscious at his feet, he picks out familiar faces on the enemy side— Carol, Hank, Jen, Reed— and he bitterly waits for someone to strike himself down too.
“Don’t be sorry, Tony. It’s okay. It’s alright, we’re okay. You’re going to be fine. We’re going to get you home.”
"It isn't my brand," Tony says. He sets the bottle back in the cupboard. "I never liked Woodford Reserve."
Tony doesn’t know how to respond, and for some reason all he can think of is Natasha, perfectly made up. Dry eyed. Detached. It’s irrational, the feeling that she had somehow been disappointed to see him. She had been here, after all. It’s nonsense to think she hadn’t wanted him to survive.
Tony shivers. He doesn’t say anything. His eyes are impossibly wide, made even larger ringed with filth and soot and dark shadow. His pupils are blown out from even the tiny bit of light.
Of course not. And that’s an easier pill to swallow. If there’s one thing he knows, it’s how to be rejected. The second they slap a bracelet on his wrist and let him check out, Tony will wheel himself into the first bad he finds that has a ramp entrance.
“Smells burnt,” Tony points out. They’re black on the bottom. He steps toward the stove and turns off the burner. His cheeks feel flushed, and it’s like every bit of skin that touched Tony’s skin is tingling.
The press jump to their feet and waves of unrest move through the crowds of journalists and civilians. Steve frowns.
possible death. His allies see him as little as his enemies. At this point, he can’t be sure who are who, anyways. Every night, green eyes haunt his short, restless fits of sleep, curled up in abandoned buildings, safe houses, sewers.
Tobacco smoke curled toward the ceiling of the saloon in hazy ribbons. On this Christmas eve, most of the residents of Timely had better places to be than flopping like a fish at the bottom of a bottle, or clutching a handful of battered old cards. All but Tony, the sad sack of shit, and some gnarly out-of-towners. Wasn’t hard to tell outlaws from businessmen, and not many of the latter passed through Timely in the middle of the night. These three men were no good alright, but Tony was no good himself.
He slips back into his room to get dressed. By reflex, he reaches for the blue cowl. He deliberates. Something compels him to loosen his grip and let it fall softly back into the drawer. This isn’t a mission for Captain America; it’s one for Steve. He leaves the safe house, paranoid but undetected, wearing a worn leather jacket and a ball cap. This seems to be becoming his regular attire for midnight trysts with Tony. A shiver runs up his spine as a cold breeze reaches beneath his jacket.
He’s been living like an animal for a long time. He shucks off his filthy uniform and changes into a lifted set of ill-fitting street clothes. He hardly recognizes himself, even though he looks more like Steve Rogers now than he has in months. By the time the morning light evaporates the dew on the overgrown front lawn, Steve is gone.
Tony is quiet. He rests his head on Steve’s chest. Tony isn’t a small man, he’s tall and broad, so his skeleton-like body feels clumsy and strange in Steve’s arms.
Then his hand slips and he stumbles, losing his footing in a cascade of little pebbles bouncing to the ground. “Damn it.”
Bruised, next-day knuckles and clenched jaws and radio silences, checking compulsively for some change that doesn’t ever come on its own, friendships grown apart, funeral bells, grave soil. Even the hottest fires burn out eventually, self cannibalizing. All that remains is ash. Nothing left to rekindle.
It takes a long time for the broken pieces to heal. Things don’t get better right away. Steve has to drop Tony off at a private hospital anonymously and leave, because SHIELD is still out for his blood. But they talk every day, over the private line of communication. Tony’s body is broken, but it’s his mind that really suffered, and Steve hopes that his words of encouragement in Tony’s head ease the burden, even marginally. Tony never talks about what went on in that basement, and Steve is reluctant to answer some of the questions Tony asks about what went on under the dictatorship of his Skrull double. So they find other things to talk about.
“I know. You’re right. Of course,” Tony says. “I’m sorry. I just—” His voice cracks, and he trails off. His hands clench and unclench and clench into fists. A concentrated ball of nervous energy. It’s contagious. Steve begins to feel unsettled.
Looking up, Steve sets his jaw and tests a handhold just above his eye level. Putting his weight on one foot, he hoists himself up, balancing a foot off the ground on a narrow outcrop. Tony holds his breath. For a second, it seems like he could really do it, easy as that. He seems to defy gravity, like a spider on the wall.
“Don’t flatter yerself. I’m just here for the drink,” he said, but he didn’t try to sound like he meant it. Obviously, Steve’s party was a hit. Just for the one night, Timely didn’t feel like a dead end. It felt like a home.
He panted, short, labored breaths forming silver clouds in the freezing air. Desert winter nights weren’t balmy; the mud shimmered with ice crystals in the moonlight. Chest tight, he dared a glance over his shoulder.
Goliath is dead, and Steve’s whole body is broken. He looks like Frankenstein's monster. His hair has been ripped out in patches. Sam had flown him out of the fight in time to get Steve medical attention. Even with the healing factor, he’s laid up for a while. He feels his shattered bones knitting themselves together, continental plates scraping ragged edges beneath the Earth’s surface. He’s missing teeth. He runs his fingers over black, spider-leg stitches.
They took him behind a barn and threw him onto the ground. There would be no witnesses. For posterity’s sake, Tony did struggle. He valiantly tried to make a break for it the minute he was released. It was mostly for the sake of the principle.
Tony continues, “In light of these events, I have committed myself to doubling down my efforts with SHIELD to bring this era of suffering to and end, and bring closure and retribution to the families of all of those who have been lost. We must not forget what this is about. Justice. Justice for Stamford. Justice for the Goliath, even if he himself was mislead by resistance leader, Captain America.”
He opened his eyes and saw a field of stars above. He was on the back of a horse, his wrists bound excessively tight in front of his body. The frayed rope chafed and bit into his skin.
Steve thinks about harming himself in some Catholic style repentance, there is a dubious, one-sided kiss between Skrull Tony and Steve, Tony experiences body horror/torture which is depicted rather graphically on screen, Tony experiences psychosis and loss of touch with reality and has distressing hallucinations, including of implied off-screen child abuse, and a hallucination in which he is decaying, depictions/discussions of weight loss and later weight gain, Steve has graphic nightmares of committing violent acts which include gore, Tony has suicidal thoughts during his time in captivity, mentions of alcohol/alcoholism. This should cover it.
Embarrassingly, it’s exactly what Steve had accused him of earlier. Tony is beginning feel the effects of going so long without a drink. Not that it’s even
“Just doing my job. Surprised to see you on your feet so soon, to be honest. I would expect you to be resting. Does the doctor know you’re out of bed?” Steve said. Tony leaned his crutch against the bar and grimaced as he carefully slid into his seat, keeping himself as straight-backed as possible.
He steps out from around the kitchen island, abandoning the stove, so that there is no barrier between them. Steve’s wearing an apron. Tony’s wearing one of his old suits, which he’s been doing a lot more now that he can actually fill them out. Steve takes a deep breath.
The big guy turned Tony onto his back and dragged him through the dirt by his shirt collar. Tony’s head lolled back; he didn’t try to struggle, anymore. He was too battered to put much fight into it, and whether or not he admitted it, he
The mustached man leapt to his feet with a snarl and lunged at Tony, jostling the table and sending the coins scattering. Tony yelped and dodged, clumsily. His chair toppled over and he started to trip over it. A fist came flying toward his face and he flinched just in time— but he caught it in the throat, instead—
Tony panics, but he can’t breathe well enough to hyperventilate. The lack of oxygen sings in his chest, counting him down to unconsciousness. His mind spins and slides like a broken gyroscope. He slumps onto the bed, muscles giving out on him, one by one. His body is failing him and the white, screaming panic of being trapped in a broken body is all too familiar. A doomed passenger.
At some point, communications in the resistance channels die entirely. Radio silence. Steve hopes, foolishly perhaps, that he has just moved too far out of range.
“I’ll keep back the choppers, and that should give you cover for a minute. You won't have long. I don't know how long I can... Just. Get to somewhere safe. They’ll be looking for you.”
Steve barks out a laugh, dry and openly pissed in a way that Tony isn’t used to, from Steve— yet, it’s clearly just a glimpse into some deeper dwelling anger that lives under the skin, magma bubbling beneath volcanic crust. “You think I’m stupid, don’t you? Oblivious, so naive that— I bet you think half the things you say go right over my head— Or maybe you
“Fucking bastard,” Hawkeye says, throwing a crushed soda can in the direction of the TV. He's the furthest from the TV, leg propped up on a table, removing a set of stitches by himself. The soda can bounces off of exactly the spot where Tony's face had been. “That son of a bitch.”
Tony prayed that maybe his attackers were just checking to make sure Tony wasn’t planning on coming back inside for his money. Tony had no such plans. He just wanted to get to bed.
Tony knew there’d be a price, the moment he decided to talk back. It was worth it to get in a good last word. Hopefully they’d be too mad to drag it out any further, goaded into killing him quickly. They started kicking him, all three of them, and all Tony could do was lie there and take it.
“There’s one thing that I’ll never be able to tell anyone now. The one thing… the thing I should have told you—”
“What’s happening?” he says. His voice sounds like a stranger to him. The words feel clumsy in his unpracticed mouth.
There must not be one person on Earth Steve would less wish to be stuck with, not one member f the Ultimates more useless and abhorrent to him that Tony Stark— and Tony, sitting here looking like a Halloween decoration, is just grateful to have some cheerful company as he circles the drain.
Then Hank gets tied up in the lab—fine— but the last straw, really, is Janet cancelling for ‘totally unrelated reasons’ just half an hour later.
They walk for a long time, in hopes of seeing something that could be used for shelter, or signs of life. The rain stops, but the ground remains wet and the air cold.
Tony can’t feel his extremities. He’s so cold. “I’m Kirk. In case case you were wondering. Captain Kirk,” he continues. Steve has no idea what Tony’s rambling on about, but it’s more for his own benefit. Without the company of another person down here with him, it feels darker. Less of a cave, more of a crypt. He misses his bed. He misses lights and drinks and Natasha and hot showers.
He chastises himself for being too hopeful. He must not neglect due diligence. He remembers Tony teaching him how to trace messages. That feels like a long time ago, now. He sits there without breathing for a long time. It feels like if he moves, the mirage might break and the message will vanish.
Jan blows a kiss and then changes her mind and comes to give him a last minute hug, bringing with her a cloud of her own floral perfume. Heaven in a breath. God, he loves women. “Get well, Tony!”
The thought that he keeps coming back to is that Tony isn’t who Steve thought he was, maybe. The Tony Stark that Steve
“You’re fighting like you’ve got something to prove, Steve,” This Tony says, barely dodging the shield when Steve aims for behind his knees. He counters and fires up his repulsors. Steve rolls to the side and takes a blast to the shoulder. It had been intended for his chest. He hisses and barrels toward the armor, shield first. This Tony knocks him backward with an unyielding, metal fist to the jaw.
The struggling tapers off. Steve releases his wrist, horrified with himself that it looks bruised. He hadn't meant to hold him so hard.
kind, I might have mixed up something a little more… fruity,” Jarvis says, lip curled judgmentally at Steve.
“You don’t get stars like this in the city,” Tony says. He isn’t crying. He’s just sad. “Light pollution, I never took it seriously until now. It’s fantastic. Look at that sky.”
There’s a needle in his neck, and it does something strange to him. He feels convulsive, and paralyzed. Extremis glitches, blue screen of death; it is frying his systems. It's frying his brain. Tony gags on his own saliva.
It did not occur to him until he started talking that it had been a long time since he’d talked to anyone like this. Tony was a loner; the highest level of social interaction he had accustomed himself to was between himself and his trusty bartender, with some occasional back-and-forth with Timely’s local quack doctor, or the most stubborn sheriff in the west.
He says, “I think you’re going to have us at war with one another.” (He is right in more ways than he yet knows.) It’s Cassandra’s curse: blessed with foresight, doomed never to be able to stop the future from coming to pass. Then again, maybe that’s more Tony’s thing. Maybe Steve is better at hindsight. Maybe Steve doesn’t even need to see ahead. All he has to do is look to the past.
“Don’t see why they would. Seems like they got what they wanted, and they’ll be miles away by now. No tellin’ where they ran off too.”
“You did this to yourself,” Steve says, but Tony can tell Steve isn’t oblivious to the amount of pain he’s in. “All for a drink. I don’t understand.”
or stupid or limited to get why he’s right. Making mountains from nothing to avoid the problem that is right in front of them.
“I won’t be suckered into that again,” Natasha mutters on her way out, to which Janet titters in innocent amusement. Tony knows it’s a joke but—
A lone tumble weed bounced across the horizon. He was alone. Where as Sheriff tights when you needed him?
Steve’s face was upside over Tony’s head, and his dark brows were furrowed it the utmost concentration. The sunrise painted the Sheriff all roses and peach. His stupid long hair caught the light— golden— where it curled at the base of his neck and behind his ears.
The grilled cheese sizzles in the pan, and starts to smell a little burnt. Steve had always imagined he would feel really overwhelmed if this moment ever happened outside of his daydreams. Like he wouldn’t know what to say.
When he came around again, he moaned. A rhythmic, bouncing motion was jostling every broken bone in his busted body. There was congealing blood dripping down the back of his throat, making it sticky and thick when he tried to swallow.
It is both harder and easier to keep up with what’s left of the resistance from afar. Steve can tune-in to their channels and spy through back door networks, but most of their communication hubs are dead these days. There is a little chatter, and Steve doesn’t know if that’s because they’re too careful to say anything of import over any distance after their encounter with SHIELD, or if they’re disbanding without him.
When exactly had the change been made? At what moment had Tony stopped being Tony? What could Steve rightfully hold him culpable for, and what sins were committed by his double? The uncertainty makes him feel like he’s losing touch. He’s distant, and distracted. His team notices. Steve doesn’t know what to tell them. He doesn’t know who to trust.
Steve sits on Tony’s chest as he gasps his last breaths and goes still, eyes open wide in empty horror. His face destroyed, blood everywhere. And he never turns into a skrull. He stays Tony, as if there had never been an imposter. As if Steve had murdered him in cold blood. He guesses that’s because he’s so scared that he’s just hunting down a ghost.
He was tied to a horse. The stink end. In front of him, one of the outlaws was in the saddle, and his leather wallet jingle-jangled softly with every hoof beat.
Steve comes back, some amount of time later, hair flattened to his head and tattered uniform clinging to his body like some kind of pin-up calendar. He’s carrying a piece of metal, warped into the shape of a dish, filling with rainwater in his hand.
When everyone has seated themselves around the round table, Steve stands at the head and clears his throat. He looks haggard in the dim, flickering fluorescents. They’re a band of ghosts, defined more by what they’re missing than by what remains.
Tony grimaces, and his eyes dart back and forth, like he wants to check over his shoulder again but he’s showing restraint out of a sense of guilt. “I didn’t realize this would happen.”
But it doesn’t go like that; they fall together, Steve dragged down with Tony. It’s a blind fall in the moonless night. Tony is too shocked to scream as his body bounces and slides down the cliff, flesh tearing open against rock, bones breaking, something inside of him bleeding.
No reply. He crosses the floor, and peers into the empty living room. He finds an abandoned office. A rotten sitting room. A walk in closet that even the mice have abandoned. The only sign of life is a recently deceased spider on a dusty windowsill. His hopes begin to sink. It’s too quiet for anything to be alive here. It doesn’t make sense.
With his last bit of momentum, he tries to slap the double’s hand away. He severely miscalculates the effort it takes to move. His hand just barely grazes against the bottom corner of his own bedsheet, leaving a single bloody streak. Then he goes totally limp.
Tony spits in Steve’s eye. “Why don’t you say it again to my face?” He’s trying to hit him, swinging his arms madly, even against the screaming pain, but one just hangs limp from his shoulder like a dead ham, and the other is too weak to generate much force. “Fucking say it to my face, coward, what’re you waiting for?”
knew had never existed in the realm of flesh; a synaptic invention, dancing behind Steve’s eyelids, idyllic false idol. The Galatea to Steve’s perverse Pygmalion. He’s disgusted with himself. Self-flattering romantic, walking through life with his hands over his eyes. How often has he allowed himself to be so blinded by what he wants to see? In Tony? In the world? In himself? He might have once been a jaded relic of the past, but he has made himself a place in the present by believing that the work he does is worth it, for a better future. Anything can be endured if it means tomorrow might be better.
Tony shakes his head and snaps his fingers in Jarvis’ direction. “Bring those over here, old chap. I’m dying for it.”
Steve was quiet for a moment, obviously choosing his words carefully. He swirled his glass in his hand, wearing those leather gloves he never seemed to take off.
The stars above, swimming pinpricks of light, just watched. The other two outlaws watched, too, looking pleased with themselves.
“Tony, stop. Stop.” Steve grabs him, tries to hold him still. Tony dislocates his own boulder and twists his head around violently, sinking his teeth into Steve’s shoulder, right into the muscle. Disappointingly, Steve hardly even flinches and his grip on Tony holds.
“Ah, there it is. Tell me how you really feel,” Tony says. He’s poking at a bee’s nest. One thing has become clear over the past few rocky hours: Steve doesn’t take well to being trapped and helpless.
Drunk as he was, and already beat to hell, he hardly felt it as they kicked him in the spine, the ribs, the kneecaps. A well-placed boot to the gut caused Tony to spasm and gag involuntarily. He rolled onto his side in time to prevent choking on his own upchuck, but just barely. The hot and sour stink of it clung to his mustache.
They brought him out into the middle of the desert. When the the horse finally came to a stop, Tony was just barely holding back seasick vomit. Rough hands on his body. Jostling. He was dumped unceremoniously on the ground. Electric hot pain shot through his chest, emanating from what felt for sure like a broken rib. He grunted.
Tony leans across Steve's body, his cologne filling Steve's nose. His warmth tangible, despite the inches still between their flesh. Steve grips the bedsheet, as Tony reaches past him for the papers. Steve makes himself a statue. Suddenly, Tony's sleeve knocks his drink onto the bedsheets and all over Steve’s lap. Cold and wet and startling, snapping Steve to reality.
That, and the fact that deep down, Tony loves roleplaying as a hero right there next to the living legends of their time. Tony doesn’t admit that part.
Steve’s horrified expression faded when he realized Tony wasn’t having regrets about the kiss. Relief and concern replaced the fear.
“No, no. ’S’okay, you’re okay,” Tony reassured, folding an arm over his aching chest, “It’s just my rib. Damaged goods. Don’t mind me.”
"As he loses consciousness, he sinks into a dark fog, some endless night, where a dozen green hands reach down his throat and pull him apart from the inside out."
They hadn’t even made it off the stoop of the saloon yet. Tony’s workshop suddenly felt a hundred miles away, and he was sure feeling what his body had been through today. He would be taking it slowly indeed. The whiskey blunted the pain but it also blunted his fine motor skills, and he wasn’t sure he could take another fall.
personal— are larger than any politics. (Smaller than anything public.) Steve feels like he and Tony are the only people on Earth, and he feels like Tony is trying to hurt him on purpose.
There’s a streaked, dried, bloody hand print along the bottom corner of the bedsheet. Dark, rust red, unmistakably blood. It wouldn’t be visible unless one was on the floor, practically. How could that have gotten there? And Tony keeps his home so meticulous. It doesn’t seem like him to ignore such a stain, if he knows of its presence.
Wouldn’t do much staring down the barrel of a pistol, but Tony had think think fast. He came up with one good use for it.
It feels senseless. Gratuitous. His pulse pounds in time with his fists, and every part of him bleeds. Tony cries out, garbled and broken though the dented faceplate. Steve ignores it. It’s now or never and he can’t lose his nerve. He came here with a purpose, and an untold toll has already been reaped to achieve that end. He’s going to kill him. The story  has been written and the ending always had to go this way.
He finds that weathered notecard, still in his pocket. In smudged, blurred ink, the number for Tony’s private comm line; it doesn't matter that it has become difficult to read, because Steve has committed the sequence of numbers to memory by heart, anyways.
Tony’s vision splits and multiplies like he’s drunk. The irony doesn't escape him. The world is a sickening kaleidoscope. He fumbles with what little muscle control he has left for the glass beside the bed. It smashes on the corner of the bedside table. Tony gropes for a shard of glass, too impaired to control his grip. He feels it slice deep into his palm, and hot blood trickles down his wrist.
Tony’s treading dangerous waters, but he can’t help himself. His throat tastes like copper and his pulse thrums. All his pain— the stabbing in his head, the dizziness and third degree burn going septic, his broken bones and the rotting itch of his ruined flesh, the withdrawals, the mortal despair— it all goes quiet. For a moment, all the noise in the world goes hushed by the exhilaration of balancing on a razor’s edge. Tony shivers, almost frightened by the darkness that flashes in Steve’s clear, blue eyes. The terror only heightens the thrill, and Tony isn’t sure which he wants more: to make Steve
Tony’s laughter sounds distorted and inhuman through the modulator-- then Steve remembers how true to life the new Extremis voice box is. This imposter Tony is laughing like a maniac; he doesn’t understand, yet, what Steve is here to do. What Steve knows. What Steve is willing to lose to get what he came for.
going out, he at least had the smug pleasure of having managed to pick he wallet off of every single one of those bandits while they were beating the tar out of him. Sticky fingers.
Here are the facts as Tony knows them: it’s his fault that they’re in a hole. It’s his fault that Steve is uncomfortable around him. It’s his fault that—even without his injuries— he would be totally useless, in the throes of alcohol withdrawals. The icing on the cake is the shame that comes with it, hands shaking, nauseous, every jumbled train of thought running through his head seems to come back to the image of an ice cold martini, a sickening thirst burning inside of him that cannot be sated with what little water they have.
“Yer words, not mine,” Steve said, lacing an arm behind Tony’s neck and under his knees, and he grunted, “But if the shoe fits… ”
“Watch your mouth,” Steve said. He cradled Tony’s head in his hands like he was something precious— even crusted with dried mud and the stench of sweat and vomit and liquor. “It’s Jesus’ fuckin’ birthday.”
Time slides on without him. He senses missing large chunks of time, but that's as precise as he can guess. The track marks on his neck accumulate and itch but he can’t move his arm high enough in his bondage to scratch at it.
“I don’t gamble,” Steve says stiffly. Standing straight as a ramrod, he holds his arms behind his back, as though for a military inspection.
He turns it over in his hands, barely allowing himself to breathe. The metal is ice against his skin.
He slides through the depths, pulled by a strong current. Sometimes he floats through perverse, nightmare versions of familiar places. Familiar voices sing his name, and he feels a burning in his throat, and an ache in his skull. They’re not real dreams; they’re fragments, viscous and warped by the sedative molasses flowing through his veins. A few times he nearly surfaces— but something heavy pulls him back down, and he slides a while longer.
Natasha straightens up and smooths out the creases in her expensive jacket, her diamond engagement ring catching the light and twinkling. “That’s nice, Cap, but there’s no need I’m afraid. As much as I’m loving,
Tony shrugs. “Fair enough. Yeah, we're alone. Do you want to give me a pat down?” Steve clenches his jaw. Tony seems much calmer than the last time they had met; there’s even a little swagger in his voice. Steve can’t read his expression very well with his eyes covered. He wishes Tony would take the shades off.
Steve decides on a new approach. Whatever is happening to Tony, he needs an answer. Irrefutable evidence. One way or another.
this was entirely new information to Steve. He already knows, all too well. The word ‘skrull’ brings flashes of gore and smoke and viscera crawling across his vision. He blinks it away. He makes himself smile.
When Tony next wakes, Howard is gone, and his mind has cleared enough to know that no one was ever really there. And he can sit up, still. And he remembers his own name.
“This is real?” he asks without moving his head. He’s almost afraid to look Steve in the eye, in case they’re inky and devilish. He’s had enough terror already. The doors swoosh open and shut and he hears footfall approaching— heels.
He doesn’t understand how this is possible. He tries to summon the under suit, he tries to reach out for help through Extremis. He should be able to connect effortlessly to communication lines. To SHIELD, to the authorities, to Steve, to anyone—
“Gee. Done already. Sure flew by,” Steve said. “I hope everyone had a good time. Seems I got so wrapped up I forgot to make my rounds. Didn’t even say goodnight to Deputy Barnes.”
"I just, always avoided it on principal," he says. He closes the liquor cabinet. "I guess some things are genetic. Funny, huh?"
, he reckons. He swallows a mouthful of his own blood and the last thing he sees before the world slides away to dark, is a pile of rubble and a glint of red and gold.
Tony watches as Steve mulls it over, like he’s trying to read his mind. Just desperate for Steve’s approval. Black smoke crawls toward the heavens in thick pillars behind Tony’s back. He still catches the light, just so. He still looks golden.
Tony has been slipping in and out of delirious sleep, waking just to piss (which hurts), or to endure Steve’s poor bedside manner as he checks Tony’s pupils for signs of concussion.
“I don’t know what I’m doing. Oh, God. I don’t know what I’m doing. And I think,” Tony pauses. For the first time in their meeting, Tony purposefully meets Steve’s eyes, and the desperation is pitiable and startling. “I think, something is wrong with me. Or, I don’t know. I feel like I’m going crazy. I think someone has been following me. I can’t sleep. I think someone’s following me. Or I’m going crazy. Sometimes at night when I open my eyes I swear…” he trails off. Silent. Whatever he sees at night, Steve is pretty sure Tony is seeing it in front of him now, in the darkness. Something sinister and ephemeral, a thousand yards away. A chill runs down Steve’s spine.
It isn’t what Maria wants to hear. Steve’s body senses the ambush coming before he realizes it. His skin prickles. His muscles quiver. Cornered animal. Too many agents. Not enough escape routes. Hands hovering above holsters, itchy, twitchy trigger fingers.
He doesn’t sleep often, but when he does, he’s become prone to slipping into deep, nightmare-filled comas. The nature of the work exhausts him to the bone, and when he lets himself close his eyes, his body succumbs quickly.
“Whoever said laughter’s the best medicine has never had one of Jarvis’s famous Bloody Marys,” Tony says. No, that’s not right. He blinks. “Dirty martini. Whoever said laughter’s the best, you get it.”
Steve could die on the spot. As he stumbles out the door, he hears Tony say, “Watch out for those checkpoints, Steve. I hear it’s never good to be caught out past curfew without legitimate business. I hear SHIELD's really cracking down.”
“Sure is a beautiful morning,” Steve said, sheathing his knife in his belt and straightening his hat. His sheriff’s star glinted as gold as his hair. “Was gettin’ yerself upright part of your plan, or can I offer you a hand?”
He traces the message to a house only three towns away, a rundown residential neighborhood. The whole while, Steve’s heart never really relaxes, he doesn’t feel like he dares to take a full breath. So used to disappointment, he looks for any possible disappointing answer to explain this. A trap of some kind. A glitch. An old message, only somehow picked up now, months too late. He can think of a lot of reasons to be pessimistic, and yet, the knot in his stomach is what hope feels like.
Tony’s skin looks blistered from the heat, which must be nearly overwhelming inside all that metal. He looks so tired.
The bartender clears his throat, staring at Tony like a man who has lost his mind. “You know you still hav to pay for those?”
“Spock.” It’s too good. He laughs, again. “But his eyebrows are better. And I don’t think Spock gives blowies.”
Another set of hands held his ankles as he was wrapped round and round in rope. He tried to beckon back the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness, but the pain was too intense to escape from. He felt his own sluggish pulse in every bruise, and the rails pressed into his back and shoulders in all the wrong places. Cold, black iron.
Tony steps into Steve's space. He presses a monogrammed towel to Steve’s leg, patting his thigh where the soda made his pants wet, moving it rapidly up his pants, startlingly close to Steve’s—
And maybe it’s intentional, using humor and poking at all Steve’s sore spots to distract from the startling immediacy of his own mortality. It’s a terrifying thing, to look death in the face. Tony doesn’t like to feel small. In a roundabout way, this is also his way of making it easier for Steve. Like the more obnoxious Tony acts for the remainder of his life, the less it’ll affect the old Captain to lose him.
“It was a good night. The folks had fun. I never seen anything like it,” Tony admitted, fiddling with his empty whiskey glass. “Usually, the holidays come and go without too much fanfare, ‘round here. I guess I didn’t believe anyone really gave a damn.”
“People won’t stand for this,” Hawkeye says, and he sounds sure of it. Steve isn’t so sure; if there’s anything he’s learned about this century, it’s that the government has gotten very good at using fear to control the public into relinquishing their rights.
The next time he opens his eyes, everything bleeds together in the sunlight. Too bright. Too blurry.
The moment it takes to trace the messages lasts eternity between breaths. The screen lights up. Steve clicks to open a map view, pinpointing the location of origin of the message. The truth is there: Tony is at the coordinates he said he is at. It’s no trap.
He started by asking Steve if he thought counting cards was really, technically cheating. (Wasn’t hard to predict Steve’s answer. A difference of moral perspectives.)
“Well, a ‘thank you’ would be fine,” Steve says.. “We don’t have to talk about what happened, down there. If you don’t want, I mean. I just needed you to know that I’m glad you made it. That’s all I care about. I’m not worried about my, secret.”
“Don’t worry,” Joe says, “You’ll die. Eventually. Fuck you, Stark. And fuck your hero buddies, too. You can have Steve Rogers to thank for this. He killed one of ours ugly? Well, we know how you feel about him. We’ve been in your head. Consider it payback.”
Wouldn’t be the first time he had royally fucked up while drunk, and had murderous outlaws follow him home to murder him. Wouldn’t be the last, either, realistically, if he survived the night.
Tony nursed his drinks slower than he might’ve, had he been all by his lonesome. He found himself tracing his finger around the rim of the glass, forgetting to chase himself into a stupor. Talking to Steve captured his full attention, and for once, Tony was okay with being present. Turns out, the Sheriff was capable of being less than uptight once in a while. Call it a Christmas miracle.
It happens between the fibers of gauze bandages, and between pages of dense file folders, and fortune cookies, and late nights, and outbursts of weeping in the kitchen politely ignored. No words needed; there had been so many harsh words before, and they had both lived through so much, that Steve thinks, maybe the quiet is what they both really need. When Tony has panic attacks brought on by things that Steve doesn’t understand; he doesn’t ask. He knows he can’t fix it.
“I just mean, Steve, it means a lot to me. I’m sorry. I don’t know how to act around you. I was nervous to see you tonight. And I'm just surprised, after everything I've put you through-- that you'd still. Well.”
“Well. Safety is my highest priority… Alright then,” Steve said, offering out his arm again. Tony looped his arm through Steve’s elbow.
It happens like he expects: she sicks her dogs on him. He warns them. No one listens. (No one ever listens.) Steve has to
They had been playing for hours, now. The last player folded out of the round, ceding victory to Tony, and he cackled gleefully. He was a few whiskies deep.
Steve’s looking at him like he’s lost his fucking mind, and Tony briefly considers playing it off as a joke. Thankfully, Steve looks away, chewing his life, and says, “They’ll be looking for us. They’ll track the plane and figure out where it went down, and help will be here, soon.”
“How the hell—?” Steve was perplexed. He opened one purse and spilled a few gold coins onto the counter, as if he was expecting this to be a joke. Wallets full of rocks.
“Maybe that’s where we went so wrong. We needed both of us, to see the full picture. I wish we could have landed in the same place. I wish—”
“I have that effect on people,” Tony said with a pained grin, leaning heavily on his crutch. A rush of warmth flooded through him as he watched Steve stare at him, touch his own lips like he still couldn’t believe what had happened, and then stare in disbelief at his fingertips.
Steve does that thing with his jaw again, thinking. Then he gently disentangles himself from Tony, and slides down. Tony watches him without breathing as Steve settles to his knees; he doesn’t seem to be shy.
It had almost been the final nail in his coffin; he had thought about detouring to a bar on his way home. Instead, he’d taken himself home and thrown himself back into the work. The phantom taste of scotch is there, still, in the back of his throat. Taunting him, the memory of warmth as he swallow, despite never having touched a drop. And if scotch would make the shadows stop moving at the corners of his vision, maybe it would have been worth it. The paranoia never eases, and thoughts of the drink follow him around, as well as the bogeyman he swears is always a step behind him.
“It’s not him, Steve,” Sam says, glancing at the green flesh poking out of the armor on the ground. A distant helicopter drones in the sky close by as it closes in on them. By the sound of it, SHIELD is close, but they’re afforded the benefit of being cloaked in the dense smoke and haze. “You have to go, Steve. You need to go. Come on. It’s going to be okay. We’ll be okay.”
“Now, just hang on a minute,” Tony said. He propped himself up on his elbow, his other arm positioned defensively above his face. “Why don’t we work this out with our words—”
“I appreciate you coming. I know I chose the place but— now I’m not—Can we go somewhere more private to talk?” he asks. Disjointed, distracted. Steve wonders if Tony has been drinking. It’s a cruel thought, but not nonsense, given the way he’s acting.
“Documents. From Congress, and SHIELD. You’ll want to get ahead of this. Big things are coming,” Tony says, sounding genuinely grim. Steve stands there, torn. And then, something gives and he’s getting in the car without really coming to the decision consciously.
Steve’s eyes feel hot. His vision blurs. He blinks it away and breathes slowly, willing himself not to lose it. Even if Tony is dead, or gone, and the armor is just metal, it feels important that Steve say all he has to say. He must get this out.
