"I'm not going anywhere," Steve says, extending a hand to invite Tony to come closer. "There will be other times. For now, I want to help you as much as I can."
No movement at all, save for her tail moving in soft swishes. As for Snowball, she has reached the helper bot and is rearing up, trying to catch the camera with a small paw. For the moment, she seems to have forgotten about being constricted.
Tony said what he enjoys is giving his partner what they need, but Steve feels the same way. Isn't it what Tony called him earlier? A Service Top?
Steve gathers Tony in a tight hug and sighs in contentment, kissing the top of his head. He's so happy, this is perfect.
"Yes, for sure," he says, rocking the child from side to side. The boy has both fists holding Tony's t-shirt and is now resting his cheek on Tony's chest, eyes drooping. "What about you, Steve? Do you want kids?"
"You might need this, Cap. I'll go prep the Quinjet. It's in hangar five, North Runway. I'll wait for you there."
"A cheeseburger, they're delicious. Burger King is the chain. Okay, let's try something else. What do you remember from Earth?"
As planned, Nat and Clint engage the Starforce, but let a few go through. Tony expects that in a few minutes a second team will attack. For now, though, three Krees have reached the door. The camera in the corridor shows them as they stop, confirm that what they want is through the war room, and place a small explosive charge on the lock.
"Nice!" Rhodey says, smile slowly stretching his lips again. "Though I've had a couple of dozens of those over the years. Where's the rest of the party?"
Zemo is still spouting nonsense. "An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead... forever."
"Yes, eventually. We haven't seen Bruce since, though. I hope he's all right, but we figured it was best to let him process. He'll come back if he wants. After lots of collateral damage and after almost destroying a city in Sokovia, Clint talked Wanda down."
It's with reluctance that Steve lets Tony step away, but before they separate, he takes hold of Tony's left wrist. Not tight, there's barely any pressure, but clearly he needs a point of contact. It's grounding for Tony too, and when they sit on the bench, he's close enough that their thighs press together as well. Steve is also back to unblinkingly staring at Tony in wonder.
The entire problem with a Jack in the Box is that once it has popped, it's very difficult to shove it back out of sight again. There's no forgetting or ignoring Steve's interest now. Tony was blind not to realize it before, too. Steve looks at him with such fondness and open affection, ninety percent of the time, that he should have noticed.
Vers and the Skrulls are trying to mess with his head; implant false memories to turn him against the Kree and Yon-Rogg. It's a good play; he almost believed her outrage.
And fuck, that obviously messed Steve up, piling new guilt on top of what he already felt about Barnes' death.
Tony raises his eyebrows. "Isn't it obvious? I'm both jittery and bored, and I want to make out with you."
"Why do you have a personal letter?" Rhodes asks, looking at Tony with disapproval. "And why did you open it? That's a crime."
The vet's receptionist – a young woman with a "Viv" name tag – blinks several times in surprise when Tony Stark enters the clinic and makes a beeline for her desk. He starts to put the bundle with the kittens on the counter, but changes his mind and reins it in, keeping them close to his chest.
What they need is bait for the Kree. If either Tony or Carol—or both—would do, it's not as if they can put up a sign, up in space, to point towards their location. But twice now, the Krees have tried to steal the core of Mar-Vell's light-speed engine, and Tony is convinced that they cannot learn. Or maybe more accurately that they are arrogant enough to try again and find out if three times is indeed a charm (it won't be, Tony won't let it).
"Of course." He was planning on courting Steve, which meant confessing first. "Were you going to tell me you're a wizard?"
"Is that so," Tony says. He still thinks two captains must be confusing, and it's true that he can't imagine himself using Cap for anyone else but Steve. "Then what do I call you nowadays? Is Capsicle still in use?"
"That makes for a change. Ready?" Tony asks, extending his arm. Steve gives him a grateful smile as he takes his hand. It's very cute, Tony won't lie.
"Yes, faster this way," Tony says. His motions are practiced and Steve longs to help. "Snowball is at about ten milliliters, Callie’s at fourteen. Do you mind weighing them before we start?"
Steve is out of breath when he reaches Stark Tower, having run over as fast as he could from the Robo Dojo. Not seeing Tony in the lobby, he hurries into the elevator.
"Yeah, he came over two days ago. The babies were due for deworming meds, and he said he was happy to do a home visit, being almost next door anyway. They're in perfect health," Tony says with pride.
"Why would I stop?" Drunk-Tony asks as he taps the white horse's shoulder. The mustache look isn't Tony's favorite, to be quite honest. "Star likes my singing, Sheriff."
Tony sighs. "I know, I'm just saying. Wanda, when the Krees have seen the drive and we push them out of this room, I'll shut it off."
"Um. I feel fine, but you might have to look again," he says, gesturing to his eyes, "because there's something wrong with my color perception."
This time it's Steve who crashes his mouth down on Tony's with unrestrained enthusiasm. He closes his arms around him too, strong and solid, and it's
It's unlikely, as there are very few of his kind in North America, and Tony knows them all. He even sired a few at their demand. Pepper and Rhodey can visit anytime, but the others know better but to encroach on his turf. As far as Tony learned, Steve lived around New York City all of his life. He has traveled little, except for two tours in Afghanistan before he left the Army. It's believable that Tony's his first vampire. They haven't discussed their ties to the supernatural to each other, not in plain words, but Tony detected the magic surrounding Steve the moment he saw him.
"Excuse me that I didn't want to flip the tube accidentally with you in it!" Peter says. He turns to Steve and points at the lake. "Flat surface, therefore less dangerous. First team to the other side?"
Nebula points at a small cluster of containers thirty feet away, which will at least offer a bit of cover. It makes a lot of sense to head there, so Tony nods in agreement. Nebula leaves the shield's protection straight away and sprints towards the containers. When Steve doesn't budge, still waiting for the Krees with his back against the wall next to the door, Tony extends his arm.
"We don't know them. They might have been best buddies, before whatever happened." Maybe more, with the emotion on WIM-Tony's face.
A few meters away, Cora was puffing up, disgruntled, but Steve coaxed her closer for cuddles. It had warmed Tony right up.
The butler huffs, mouth turning down in disapproval. "That would have required Sir to go to medical."
"What? No!" Tony protests. It seems he can order the armor to return to the reactor without a problem. It's just as fascinating as deploying it. "I'm glad you showed me. It's awesome."
"It's not the baby," Steve protests, but he caves when Tony raises an eyebrow. "Okay, fine, it's a bit because of the baby."
"She says I am the one,"  he sings at the screwdriver, spins, then does a perfectly timed pelvic thrust. "But the kid is not my son."
One benefit of getting closer to Steve had been the ability to read him like a book. Tony immediately knew he was telling the truth, but not all of it.
No, he needs to focus on the Bifrost being a way to go through an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or close enough. There, that sounds better for his peace of mind.
T'Challa inclines his head. "Of course. He can offer it as evidence in his defense. But if he was innocent, why did he try to flee?"
Happy with her winnings, Anjo is gathering her things, ready to leave. She nods at Nebula and Tony in greeting, then tows her bubbly girlfriend away.
He gets to his feet and offers a hand to Tony. At least they are in phase with each other, because Steve's hand is solid in his. As demonstrated multiple times in training and battle situations, it's easy as anything for Steve to pull Tony up.
Thor grabs the belt on the front of Yon-Rogg's uniform, which makes the man's eyes go round in surprise.
"Yeah," he says, bringing the picture up to fill the screen and showing it to the Team. It generates another round of cooing.
"It's not a good idea."  He says it with only a slight tinge of regret. Right now Tony only wants to have a little fun. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, especially not Steve. "If you'll excuse me, I have plans to get laid."
"I can help you win over that lucky guy, too," Tony continues, oblivious that Steve is talking about him. "You know I date both men and women, right? I'm here for you, buddy."
"Yes. And history repeated itself. He wanted the core, I made it blow up, Yon-Rogg kidnapped me. And brainwashed me to make me want to fight Carol."
"He looks up to you a lot," Steve continues. "You've been mentoring him. I think he's the reason you helped us figure out time travel, to get him back."
"I do miss you, Hildr, every minute you are not by my side." Thor hugs and kisses the big cat's head. "Only I find it cruel to taunt Midgardians about their sad lack of daemons."
“Again, I am glad to make your acquaintance. I have not seen my son this content in hundreds of years. You Avengers have been good for him.”
Taking a deep breath, Steve then slowly releases it, psyching himself before speaking up. "Would you like to go to Club A, after?"
"I think that's it," he says once satisfied, and Tony emphatically nods which reassures Steve. "Okay, good. Here it is, then."
"Because this is mainly why it didn't degenerate into fighting," Richards says, pointing at the ceremony.
"Colonel Rhodes, whom I called earlier, is on his way back from Queens and should arrive shortly. Miss Potts is in California at the moment, should I—"
His fur is so soft! Taken by surprise, Steve freezes. He doesn't react in time to catch Tony in a hug and too soon he's bounding away, leaping on Rhodes next.
"Uh huh. I see how it is." Tony shakes his head as if disappointed, but he can barely hide his amusement.
Steve sniggers as he kisses Tony's neck, who tilts his head to give him more access. It feels amazing.
"Oh." Tony thought they'd do that? Not that Steve is against the idea: it seems weird, but he trusts Tony knows what can be enjoyable. "You said you'd be game?"
"Well played Vers, Anthony," Yon-Rogg says. He's kneeling a few feet away, hands webbed behind his back. He also has a split lip and a bruise high on his left cheekbone. Tony has an inkling about who tried to rearrange his face.
"It's all right," Tony repeats, tapping Thor's breastplate. "The Krees can be sneaky. Did you bring what we need to lure them here?"
He then takes a deliberate step closer and grabs Tony's hands. The gesture isn't possessive or territorial, or at the very least, it doesn't feel like that (Pepper has a boyfriend now, Tony learned, and he's thrilled for her). But it's a statement.
Said with a wink and fuck, fuck, fuck, those words are stirring something in Anthony's mind (and his stomach too, he's hungry it seems). An image appears on the screen of the machine he's hooked up to. A brightly colored red, yellow, and blue logo on the white paper wrapped around what looks like a sandwich. He's staring at it in disbelief—his brain feels like the traitor here, disclosing information that Anthony doesn't even understand—which makes Vers turn to have a look at the monitor.
"TOR Network," Sharon says, giving the glass of ice tea to Mechanic-Tony. "When we get a request, we spend time vetting the client before Bucky decides whether to pull the trigger. Figuratively."
When Tony enters the Summer Pavilion, he finds the others in a small dining area, jostling each other for glasses and access to the faucet.
"What!" Anthony exclaims, heart racing as he glares at Att-Lass, who lets him go. Att-Lass also raises his palms to show he's not a threat with a nervous glance at Anthony's glowing hands. It's not Anthony's fault that he instinctively charged up in reaction to a perceived danger. "Can't you see I'm busy here?"
"Sir, the Stark Satellite Network confirms that the first Kree Accuser Warship is in geostationary orbit overhead," JARVIS announces.
That's all he needs. He doesn't care much for mechanics or specifics; he's sure it’ll be wonderful either way.
"Yeah, okay." Steve has dispelled his shield and is rubbing his thigh with a wince. "I'd love to learn how to do that, by the way."
Steve wonders if he's working on something for the kittens and is surprised at the pang of disappointment that comes with it. It's not like he can stop Tony from inventing, but he thought they were in this adventure together for now.
For a second Steve looks shocked, but then he smiles. It's so beautiful, it transforms his entire face, and even though it's the best thing that Tony has seen all day, it's akin to a punch to the gut. He'll gladly give this to Steve—of course, he deserves to be happy with his long lost love—but it hurts, nonetheless.
Technical stuff works better for the back burner, as Tony calls it, but it's also a nice place to shove emotions. They simmer there if he's busy enough with something compelling, and when he comes out of his work fugue, he has more perspective. It's not magical, unfortunately, so he's still reeling from everything he learned on Iantus. His anger has abated considerably, but he's hurt nonetheless. He's been avoiding Steve the best he could to prevent a pointless confrontation, but it's difficult on such a small spaceship. The forced proximity has subjected him to Steve's kicked puppy face and soulful eyes, and it's very hard to cling to his resentment. Not that he wants to wallow; he's just not able to skip over it either.
It's a good diversion, and Tony hopes it obfuscates the memory of his almost panic attack. He's still a bit shaky, though, and if he takes comfort from petting Lilly—who has settled on his leg under the table—no one needs to know.
That's another frustration in Anthony's life; they limit his powers with a controller implanted directly into his spine. It's between his shoulder blades, so he can't take it out alone, and it is supposedly for his own protection and everyone else's. He's been patient, but if they don't set him free sometime soon, Anthony is this close to disabling it himself. He remembers nothing from before the attack, but they said that his life had been a series of errors and fuck-ups, which is why they can't fully trust him. Unfortunately, unlike many things that he's been told about his life from before, this one rings true to what Anthony feels in his guts.
"Thanks," Steve says, throwing an apologetic look Sam's way. He shouldn't have snapped. "You guys rest, alright? It's been a rough two weeks."
"If there's money left," Tony confirms, aiming two repulsor blasts at Krees that FRIDAY detected behind the containers to the left. Nebula has taken control of her own adversaries in the cluster she chose for herself. "I'm afraid the Krees are making a mess."
His jaw is set, but Tony won't argue about that. He doesn't want to be left alone in the multiverse either.
Not caring which direction he's going—distance is key at the moment, not destination—Tony walks as fast as can. He hopes it's not providing an irresistible lure for a predator, though. The eyes were front facing and way too high off of the ground, hinting at something huge and dangerous. Certainly not a deer. It might be paranoia, but Tony feels as if he's being followed, even if he can't hear or see anything new every time he checks behind him.
"Haven't you heard? We need to move the project." Yon-Rogg is smiling. "A better room, and more protection now that you're almost done."
"Yeah, yeah." Tony is thrilled too, honestly, even if he tries to downplay it. He’s not sure what it was, the alien concussive beam knocking something loose or the visceral reaction he had to Steve over him unsticking a jammed door in his mind—which he doesn’t want to say out loud—but the memories are present again.
The almost soundless detonation makes the door open, revealing the Krees. Steve is standing in front of Tony and then Wanda, shield raised protectively.
He tries to break the super soldier's grip on his wrist, by twisting to force against Steve's thumb like he's been trained to do, even though there's a slim chance of
Tony raises his free hand to cup the back of Steve's head, and it annoys him that the cowl is in the way. He unsnaps the chin strap and takes it off, raking his fingers through Steve's beautiful blond hair. It's longer than it used to be, and it suits him. Steve leans into his touch as if starved for it.
Lilly hurries off Steve only to dash to the bed too, climbing up using the coverlet and rolling and jumping with Cora with little happy chirps. They're having a grand old time, for sure. It's pretty cute, and Tony watches them in amusement.
It makes Tony roll his eyes and retract the helmet. "No. It's me, asshole. And I don't have time for this shit."
Tony's eyebrows raise high on his forehead, and he looks even more curious now. "Interesting." This conversation is rapidly becoming infuriating: what is interesting, exactly? To learn that Steve is attracted to men, or interesting as an opportunity?
"No," Steve says. "Couldn't, with my asthma. I tried to keep butterflies between the two planes of my room window one summer. There was a three-inch space that made quite a nice house for them, I thought, with holes for ventilation and all. I think I was eight years old."
"I say we do like summer camp," Carol says. There's a mischievous glint in her eyes while she throws a look at them. "I therefore declare this to be the girls' room." She grabs Nebula's arm and drags her into the bedroom, throwing a cheerful "Goodnight!" over her shoulder before closing the door behind them.
"That's pretty much the only thing we have going for us," Tony says with a shrug. "We took Thanos by surprise and snapped everything back while dusting him and his army, wherever they were at the time."
They're face to face and Tony is pondering if he should go to the hospital or the Avengers medical bay—Steve got shot in the chest!—when he realizes that Steve is laughing.
That relaxes the atmosphere and makes everyone laugh as they start moving again. A moment later, as they climb a ridge, Tony briefly puts his hand on the small of Steve's back, even though he's supernaturally agile and in no need of help. The fun is in the sneak touch, which is a game that Steve enjoys judging by the heat in his gaze when he looks back at Tony.
But—and that would prove to be an issue later—the fact was that Steve hadn't said anything. He hadn't let Tony know if the reason he made a move was just attraction and desire, or if there were feelings involved. What he wanted from this, from Tony. But frankly, Tony didn't care. He craved more. If he had the chance to have Steve, in any capacity, he'd be crazy to refuse (no matter that when Steve had had enough, Tony would certainly end with a broken heart). So he jumped right in with both feet.
Tony mounted the top on hinges, and Steve's about to go walk over and open it to see the kittens, asleep or not, when Tony extends his arm and stops him.
"Go for it, I'll join you in a minute!" Tony says from where he's trying to keep up with Steve, who is fighting like a demon. He's making his way towards Yon-Rogg, which is unsurprising.
Which leaves Tony with Steve. Considering what Tony realized earlier on the dance floor, it might be a golden opportunity, or on the contrary, the making of a disaster of epic proportions. But then Tony's body cuts into the overthinking as he yawns again. He's truly beat. All he wants right now is to go to sleep.
"You're serious," Tony says after a few seconds, aghast. That amount of destruction isn’t even comprehensible. "Half? Of everything?"
The absolutely gorgeous smile that had bloomed on Steve's face had been breathtaking. Tony had even wondered if it would be too much for his recently repaired heart, which seemed to miss a few beats here and there.
It's apparent right away that Kol is trying to collect a blue series, that the silent man next to him is completely disorganized, and so on. The croupier and other players definitely don’t consider Tony a threat, and he does his best to comfort them with that idea by hesitating from time to time before he chooses a tile.
"Like who?" Steve has the gall to argue, hooking a foot around one leg of the console to anchor himself and not slide closer. But even with all of Steve's strength, Tony is still being dragged in inch by inch. "The Fantastic Four vanished, that's why we're here!"
Tony shakes his head as he picks the black kitten and brings her up for a kiss between her ears. "You're the one who insisted on naming them!"
"Oh, water!" Carol exclaims as she reaches their table. She steals Tony's glass, which makes him sputter in outrage. He was drinking that!
"True, true." Steve licks at the tendon of Tony's neck, pleased when it makes Tony tilt his head to the side to grant better access. "It wouldn't be fair of me to make you wait too long."
"Oh!" Tony gathers the boy even closer, protective. Steve knows without a doubt that he'd give his life for this random child he has only known for a few minutes. "Don't worry, sweetheart, you'll be fine."
On one hand, this is exciting. Being asked, with Steve, to be Earth's representative on a trip to Asgard as co-leaders of the Avengers is a big deal. Tony loves Thor's enthusiasm about it, too.
He gathers all of his strength to burn the hottest he can manage as he takes flight, going straight towards Vers. Anthony only has one shot, and he knows it. Focusing all of his power, he fires a photo beam at center mass. Unfortunately, Vers sees him coming at the last second and evades. But the beam connects anyway. Vers' eyes go wide as her energy is extinguished and she drops to the ground into one of the craters that dot the planet Xoria.
So Tony's in a hospital after all, or a clinic. The nurse, or maybe she’s a doctor, peers into his eyes with a little instrument that he's never seen before. The exam is a good idea because they aren't working right.
"It doesn't have to be right this moment!" Steve says. "Just soon. What do you think?" he asks the baby. She's holding her head a lot better now.
It's true that he's been feeding the sisters every two, three hours, and then four hours all by himself for two weeks now. He must look forward to taking a break, and not necessarily to seeing Steve in particular. It's okay though, Steve doesn't mind; taking care of the kittens is a way to dote on Tony at the same time. Which he misses and wants to do, anyway.
He even brings up his metal hand to touch Steve's two weeks old beard. "That's new. I like it, it suits you."
"Anytime you want to rejoin the team, you can. You should know that," Steve says, and he pokes at the boot to give Tony time to compose himself again.
"Are you into it? Kink?" Steve asks. He's watched porn, but never checked out the harder stuff. Didn't really care for it, honestly.
. There’s a mess of scars, but they’re mostly white. Old news. But then his eyes catch on his right hand and arm, covered with much fresher marks, slightly raised and pink. "Fuck, it's gone! What happened to me? Am I dying?"
"If I have to," Steve says, and that's enough bullshit for today. Which of course is also Rhodey's opinion.
"Of course I want you!" Steve exclaims. He looks heartbreakingly sincere. "God, you have no idea. But not like this. Not when you don't remember everything that happened."
"Let go; we'll jump off," Steve says when they're a few feet away. Which they do when Tony unlocks the armor’s arms, as graceful as cats.
In fact, Steve is more than a fan of Tony as an athlete. He's, in Bucky's words, a besotted idiot. But who can blame him? Tony is absolutely gorgeous in any shape he takes. The feline grace is apparent even at Baseline, where he's slim in build, almost delicate, but so pretty. Tony's big brown eyes with indecently long eyelashes and his pert little ass should be registered as lethal weapons, really. Steve feels like a big tongue-tied oaf around him, in either of his own forms, which is so embarrassing. If that wasn't enough, Tony is also brilliant, acing his engineering classes, and very sweet once you see through his fake arrogance. Maybe one day Steve will find the courage to ask him out.
"Cap's been a pain in my ass." Rhodey makes a face at Tony preemptively. "I don't even want to hear a joke about that," he adds before focusing all of his attention on Steve again. "We're still in a fucked up situation with the Accords, and I'd appreciate your cooperation to make them work, Steve. Can I count on that?"
Tony is pretty certain of where this conversation is going, but he needs it to be without ambiguity. "What are you offering, exactly?"
Abandoning the pictures for now, Tony finds the messaging app and opens the thread with Pepper with apprehension. To his relief, the tone is very cordial. Hell, by several context clues,  including how she repeatedly tells him to come up to help make dinner, it looks as if they’re still living together. Huh. Well, that's good for Morgan; she has both of her parents at home, and they’re friendly if not still friends. The messages with Rhodey could be copied and pasted from what Tony remembers last: a lot of “hi, miss you” or “goodnight” and plans to meet soon. They never had long text conversations since they prefer speaking to each other. Rhodey keeps requesting pictures of his godchild, though, which is cute. The same familiarity is present in the texts with Happy as well as a lot of mentions of checking on a certain Peter whom Tony doesn't know.
"Why are you surprised by this? Of course it would protect you! I've always built my armors like that. That’s how Rhodey got his first War Machine suit; there's no way he could have taken a suit if I hadn't allowed it."
"Thanks," Tony mumbles instead of boasting, which Steve would have guessed would be the reaction if Tony still showboated around him. In fact, Tony looks uncomfortable by the praise, or maybe he’s so pleased by it that he doesn't know how to react. Steve lobs a distraction his way that will allow Tony to bounce back.
It's a bit of a cop out because he doesn't quite know what to say to Steve and Barnes, but also a show of trust. Rhodey isn't that enthused with the idea and makes it known through the armor's comm link.
And definitely not that his dreaded, but still awaited, reunion with Steve would happen on the tarmac of Leipzig's airport.
That draws a loud bark of surprised laughter from Steve, who's now sadly hidden in a tent while changing.
"My intended," Tony says, using the Kree vernacular. "And he told you to get out. I'd do it before he gets really angry."
The story they spun for the press was truthful, even if incomplete. An accident on Asgard, a long period where he remembered nothing, and another shock that made him regain his memory a week ago. Fortunately, he'd had help to return to Earth, and so here he was, safe and sound and ready to take back the Iron Man mantle. He kept mum on his new powers, the Kree, Carol, and the Skrulls though.
"Attaboy." Carol is drumming her fingers on her thigh. "We're only one jump away from Earth, where should we go?"
"It's an order," Steve says, then raises his voice and as he touches his ear piece again. "Back here, NOW."
It seems to be going well so far. In fact, the greetings and visits soon turn into a dinner party. Tony doesn't know what’s in that orange fruity drink they keep serving, but he hasn't felt this mellow in years. He can't say that he minds. Plus it works for everyone: he caught Nebula laughing earlier, which was amazing. The two captains also have reddened cheeks and are loose-limbed, so it affects superpowered beings too. Good, they all deserve a bit of fun.
"I can hold the little one while you go change," Thor says, with an almost puppy-like look in his eyes.
And ouch, there it is. JARVIS is gone—that's the confirmation, and it feels callous that it hurts just as badly as learning about Natasha.
"So you brought him back." Steve isn't surprised. Of course Tony wouldn't leave an innocent child on his own like that. It's the fact that he took the baby to the Tower and called Steve that is puzzling. "But why did you call me, and not Janet or Miss Potts?"
on his shoulder, throwing it to the ground. He immediately feels terrible about it for no reason he can comprehend. Adding to the chaos, Steve yelps too. A small furry animal runs down his body to join the… crow? Yes, the black crow on the floor.
Curious, Tony approaches and sees that there are two bedrooms, with only one enormous bed in each. He wonders what the Iantusians imagined couples were. They've been hanging out with each other without being with one person more than the others, in his opinion. It's true that earlier Nebula was resting on Tony's shoulder, though. It might have been misconstrued.
"Bummer. If you ever come back, hit me up!" he says cheerfully, finally helping Jarons to sneak away.
"We have a slight issue," Nebula says. She’s gone from one door to the other inside the pavillon and now has a frown on her face.
"Unfortunately not. At least not right now," Tony teases. Steve grins again and leans into another kiss. He seems determined to keep Tony as close as possible while he still can.
Steve makes a wounded noise and Tony immediately feels terrible. He looks up at long last, and Steve still has this unnerving stare from earlier on the tarmac. As if Tony will disappear if he blinks, even once.
"You're Tony Stark, right?" Barnes asks, eyes going to Steve for a second, then back on Tony. "From those magazines, with the flying armor?"
“It’s been surprise after surprise,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow at Thor. On his shoulder, Cora shifts from one foot to the other before settling again.
"He's a fucking cheater," Kol accuses again, spitting mad. Quite literally, which is disgusting. "It's the glasses. He uses them to read the tiles."
"Maybe they left early as scouts for a mission." It's Tony's best bet, even if he saw nothing worthy of such an operation in the last couple of days.
He gestures, and bright pieces of metal start flying to him. An armor suit, red and gold, is forming around his body. The suit is achingly familiar, and it suffuses Anthony with pride and longing. He doesn't quite remember, even though he knows he should. This is important; it's an essential part of him, and he's missed it like a chopped limb.
It's a plea, friend to friend, but Tony also hears in his best friend's voice the weight and seriousness of a career officer on a mission.
Tony is tingling from his orgasm, but more than that, he's filled to the brim with how much he loves this man. He pushes back strands of hair off of Steve's forehead and kisses his plush lips with all the care and devotion in the world. His goal in life is going to be simple from now on: make Steve as happy as he can.
"I'm fine," he manages as Carol and Talos help him sit down on the floor, now free of the memory-machine.
There's no tsunami of memories. But if Tony thinks of Morgan, it's like an explosion of love goes off in his chest, a thousand times brighter than what he felt looking at the photos on his phone. He remembers vividly the feel of her tiny arms locked tight around his neck when they said goodbye before the trip, and it's as wonderful as it's bittersweet.
"Face up," he demands, determined to do his job even if the mood around the table has totally changed.
Once they leave the hospital, though, Tony's too busy taking in an alien metropolis on a completely different planet to worry about much else. It's the similarities to Earth that fascinates him, how this part of the city looks a lot like Akihabara but dotted with aliens of varied skin tones. The space port they reach after a ride on an ultra fast bullet train is another thing entirely. Tony keeps looking left and right wishing he had more eyes to take in all of the ships. Some are utilitarian and kind of bulky, but there are also sexy, sleek little numbers that he itches to touch. Steve leads him to a relatively small black and silver ship that is all curves and fins. It's beautiful, really.
Wrapping his head around people having a magical animal is hard for Tony. As they cross the city and then enter the palace, he sees several of them while many Asgardians enthusiastically welcome Thor home. Among other daemons, Tony has witnessed a mouse with six legs, an elk with wings, and a lizard with three heads. What’s even harder to believe than their existence is the concept that daemons supposedly represent their person’s essence, their soul. A lion, winged or not, makes sense for Thor. But when they reach his mother Frigga, a woman of visible class and oozing royalty and serenity, she’s flanked by a huge boar that could easily eviscerate them all.
Cherie is forward in a way Tony has always appreciated. Clear signals, fun banter, light touches but not too aggressive. She's a marketing director with tons of entertaining stories, brilliant, and a gorgeous dark-eyed blonde. She's recently separated too and looking for a distraction that Tony is very happy to provide.
Steve gets the significance of his words instantly, blue eyes widening. Tony doesn't wait another second and surges up to kiss him. They clash a little too hard at first, but a second later they've synched up, falling into each other as if they've done this a million times. It's so
"Thank God. I'm sorry I didn't invite you in right away, I panicked." He carries Tony in his palms as they move to the first floor again. "Are you thirsty?"
“Yes you are, honey.” Tony bends to kiss her head. Lilly leans into it and rubs on his cheek in return, which tickles.
What occurs next is the most extraordinary thing that Tony has ever seen. In the space of seconds, the wolf transforms into a man. It happens all at once, the body changing shape and golden fur disappearing to leave pink skin behind. The blond guy it reveals is stark naked, clearly tall and with wide shoulders. He's also waking up, face scrunching in confusion before his eyes open. His gaze is just as blue as the wolf's was.
“Welcome to Asgard. I hope you will enjoy your visit. It delights us that you accepted our invitation.” Frigga gestures to the couch near her chair. “Please sit down with me.”
"Sir is faring better than he thinks." J.A.R.V.I.S.'s answer is slightly puzzling, but at least reassuring.
Steve beams at him before leaning down for a kiss. It's tentative, hopeful, and everything Tony could have hoped for, making butterflies flutter in his chest.
"That was fantastic," Steve mumbles against Tony's shirt. Tony doesn't rush him, and after a few minutes Steve speaks up again.  "How do you know? What I'll like? You seem to know it more than me."
"My pleasure. Quite literally." It's a testament to his beautiful Irish skin that Steve pinks up a little even after the feeding. His eyes dart to Tony's lap, who is now hard too. He tries reaching for Tony's erection, but Tony catches his wrist and brings Steve's hand to his mouth to kiss his knuckles.
Unsurprisingly, Yon-Rogg has his disappointed face on when Anthony reaches the training room. Anthony supposes he should feel contrite, but he can't be bothered.
Steve sips his drink and can already feel its warmth soothing his nerves. This surprise visit is going fine, falling into their usual good banter.
"Nope, you and I went to Camp Lehigh in the seventies for it. Your idea," Steve says with a small quirk of his lips. He's clearly pleased that Tony is invested in the story.
"Stark?" Wilson asks, EXO-7 wings only then folding in on his back. By his side, Barnes looks nervous, glancing between all of Rhodey's crew, but mainly towards T'Challa.
“Boars symbolize strength, fertility, abundance, generosity, courage, and power,” he lists with a deep voice. Said like that, the match with the Queen of Asgard seems spot on.
"That's on purpose," Tony says. He sees in the pile one of the worst pieces of disinformation ever published on vampires that he wrote himself at the turn of the century. "Safer that way. But you had one of the good ones," Tony adds, tapping the grimoire still in Steve's hands with the tip of his fingers. "Thank you so much, I should have started with that. I would have been toast without your help."
"Right," Carol replies. "Listen up! You might have heard about us. We're the Avengers, from Terra. There are more of us, a whole team. We reversed the Decimation, and we killed Thanos and his army. No one else, not even the Krees, will mess with Terra. Is that clear?"
"Once Carol brought back Thanos's coordinates, we went to him. It was a desperate move, and we caught him off guard—probably because five years had passed. He must have thought we'd accepted our fate."
Iantus is the opposite of Sovereign, as in the welcome committee is sympathetic and seems happy to see them. They’re also highly advanced as a society, in a way that makes Tony salivate: decarbonized economy, sustainable development, smart urban planning, nature conservation, you name it. From what the Iantusians have shown, everything looks perfect. It isn't, surely—that doesn't seem possible—but it gives Tony a bit of hope that they can save Earth if they get their act together.
"No, I mean to get the weapons. I'd bet the Avengers ruined a party set up by one of our very own American agencies," Tony says.
Steve will have to let Tony know how much he appreciates him, cats or no cats, at the very least. They've grown as friends in the last three months, surely Tony realizes that. Steve's feelings have passed the test of time, and he's certain it's not just infatuation. It is possible being cautious isn't the way to go anymore. If Tony wants him back, it would be crazy to do nothing about it. So yes, they need to talk at one point; it's highly overdue.
As for Lilly, she's in Tony's arms too, and is petting Cora reassuringly and making small chirping sounds. Thor crouches by their side and catches Tony's eyes with his own.
He realized he'd fallen in love—and might have been all along—the night Tony put on a brave face and announced that he and Pepper were over. Steve remembers having the knee jerk reaction that if he had the chance of Tony loving him, he would never let him go. He kept his mouth shut, of course, and was as supportive as he could be.
"Let me go." His voice is scratchy, making him realize that he's terribly thirsty. No way in hell he'll admit to it, though.
"I'd say you have everything under control." Steve's not sure the excuse to come over to help will hold much longer.
It's marvelous that these two men can even climb up a hill, in the snow, with what they went through.
After touching something under the table that makes the stage-slash-table pass from being lit in blue hues to a deep red, Baylee winks at Steve and leaves in search of patrons in need of entertainment. Steve's shoulders relax a fraction and Tony has so many questions. He's lived in the twenty-first century for over a decade now. Surely Steve's used to being hit on at this point? Tony wonders if he's been in a few relationships, though now's not the time to dwell on Steve's romantic or sexual history.
As Tony scrolls back in time through the photo roll, the girl is constantly present, to the point where he wonders why Pepper lets him see her that much. He freezes when there's a picture of Morgan extending a Happy Father's Day card to the camera. Hell, there's a separate picture of the inside of the card itself, stating in shaky block letters, "I love you, Daddy. - Morgan." Shocked, he looks up at Steve who is staring back at him.
He's turning to leave when Tony catches Steve's arm. His face is soft and open, so beautiful, and Steve's heart thumps.
"We're having a summer fest downtown. Stick around and find out. I'm sure we could use help with the fireworks."
"Fine," Tony grumbles. Since hiding in the suit would be too cowardly even for him, he opens it up and steps down. "What's the problem?"
Tony has unwanted images of Steve and Bucky now living in Steve's apartment, reunited at last, and... it makes him sad and not just a little jealous, he won't lie.
That makes the room erupt with exclamations and cheers. From the original Avengers at least, while the Maximov twins and Ant-Man look slightly lost at the development.
A feeding every two hours is a routine that repeats far too often, but they have it down to a science after the third day. Steve gives Tony breaks if Stark Industries requires him, and he takes at least one shift off for himself to train and video chat with the others at the Compound as he remotely organizes training exercises. Nat has taken the on-site leadership role with ease, and with only a minimal amount of teasing and knowing looks. To be fair, Steve and Tony being sudden cat dads is highly amusing for the entire team, and they keep requesting pictures.
"Ah." Tony nods, conceding the point. He's not sure where Steve is going with this, though. "Go on."
"Sure he does," Cowboy-Steve placates, then grabs Drunk-Tony's elbow to steer him away. He's gentle doing so, considering, and then slips an arm around Drunk-Tony for support as they walk down the road.
Steve's mouth is watering and he can't even play it cool and quip back. He climbs on the bed, taking a spot between Tony's thigh, eyes fixed on how Tony is still touching himself. It's the sexiest thing Steve's ever seen, by far.
Wilson has the usual wings, but his uniform is in the red, white and blue color scheme, with the star on his chest. It's unmistakable, especially since he also has Cap's round shield.
The resurrection of Tony Stark™ was a global hit. The reaction was overwhelmingly positive, which came as a surprise to Tony. A nice one. Hell, he'd read about his disappearance and the mourning that followed, and it had touched him that, at the time, his demise wasn't greeted by a chorus of "good riddance".
"The stones, Thanos—" Nebula sneers at the name, making Tony pause. That's right. Her dad, Steve said. He won't touch that subject with a ten-foot pole. On the other hand, maybe they bonded over daddy issues. "He gave me the short version."
"I promise," Tony says solemnly. "He won't catch me unaware again, and he doesn't stand a chance against my friends and I."
She tilts her head to the side. "Common Terran name, might even be true. Better than Vers, anyway. For Dan
"Yes! But you thanked me for a good time and left, so I thought… The sex was great, and you came back, so I was sure that was it for you."
Steve smiles grimly, finally a little light in this confusing morning, but it doesn't hold. "Yeah, just like Bucky because it was him in the flesh. Hydra found Bucky after he fell. They brainwashed him and used him as a tool ever since. They'd place him in cryo between missions and reset his brain every time. He didn't know what he was doing."
"Why the hell did you hide that from me?" He’s barely able to keep from yelling. It’s so unfair. "What gave you the right!"
"Sure, go ahead. We're just here for my boy's shots, anyway," the man says, tapping his bulldog's flank.
"The information provided is sufficient for preliminary authentication, though by protocol I have to request a physical proof too," JARVIS adds.
"I have recorded their first steps, Captain Rogers," FRIDAY says with pride. "I can share the footage."
The blowjob isn't all, as Steve is stretching him too, which only adds to the onslaught of pleasure. Those fingers feel huge, but he's gentle, at least at first. Greedy for it, Tony moves in counterpoint to Steve's movement, and they easily fall into a rhythm. And then Steve finds Tony's prostate, and that's almost his undoing. But it’s not, only because it looks as if Steve can read his mind and backs off when it gets too intense.
Rhodes stands up and gestures to the little girl who takes the offer and transfers to his arms. "I'm with you. Come on, monkey."
"It's what you were told," Talos says with a shrug. "I saw that little speech about accountability, earlier, for your company. I liked it."
"I'm fine, I swear. The Krees brainwashed me and took me in the first place, but they didn't mistreat me, otherwise." Steve looks very skeptical about that. Tony shrugs. "I was just Anthony. They told me Carol was the enemy, that she killed my parents, but for two years I pretty much only trained to eventually fight her. And worked on the Kree fleet when I could. Really cool tech, by the way."
"Hey there, Snowball," Steve says, leaning down to kiss her little head. He'd give anything to do the same to Tony's wrist only a few inches away. "Pleased to meet you."
The doctor hangs up and notices that he's drawn their attention. He smiles reassuringly, "She'll get back to me. I'm sure we'll find them a good family."
"Yes." Confident about his feelings. That it's the right thing to do. That they will be stronger together, no matter what. "Are you?"
"You know us," Steve says with a tremulous smile. "It's not always easy. You never said it would respond to me, so I assumed it wouldn't."
Tony doesn't say that the chance of appearing near the Fantastic Four if they reach the same reality as they did is infinitesimal, but he figures Steve realizes that too.
The correct bag is further down than he’d thought, and he has to jump in to retrieve it. He feels something give out under his left foot and he doesn't want to know what was in there. It smells like rotten vegetables, among other things. He’s sure he’s ruined his shoe, and probably his pants too. Steve doesn't care though, worried because the kitten's mewls are growing further apart.
"Do you fake being fine like that often?" Tony asks his Steve, who makes a face that totally admits guilt. "Yeah, I had my doubts. Never ever dare question me again when I do the same."
Steve snorts in amusement. "Tell me about it, that last Steve is one lucky bastard. Plus I wanted to wallop that idiot me who was in the machine so bad for being mean to you. And punch Bucky in the face."
It's tempting to take Tony's cock as far down his throat as he can, but there's something he wants even more. Keeping his gaze locked with Tony, he pulls off just enough to only keep the head in his mouth. Steve focuses on tonguing the frenulum, but grabs the base of Tony's dick and starts jerking him too. With his other hand, Steve gently tugs on Tony's balls, making him stutter forward, breaking his controlled pace.
He might have holes in his memories, but Tony's confident that his core traits haven't changed. Protecting people, especially the ones he cares about, is what he strives to do. It wouldn't make any sense to build technology so advanced and versatile that’s coded to him only.
He unlocks the latch but can't stop staring at his reflection, following the lines fanning from the corners of his eyes with his index finger. So many of them, so deep too.
Steve whips off his t-shirt, then sits down on his heels and looks up at Tony, wondering what he'll ask for now.
After a moment getting his breath back while hiding his face in Tony's neck, Steve pulls up to look at him in wonder.
Tony grimaces. "Yeah, that's going to be harder since I bleed green now and the blast must have rearranged my chromosomes. Long story. But I still have old scars, including from the arc reactor, so it's a start?"
When it stops, Tony is glad that he thought to lock the suit's knees when they left Earth, because his legs are wobbly. After the wonder of going through the Bifrost, he's now awed by the vast globe-like structure they ended in. On the pedestal in the center, Heimdall is also impressive with his horned helmet and gigantic sword. Tony has barely taken a breath when an unexpected threat appears out of nowhere.
"Shut up," the man closest to Tony barks. It takes Tony completely by surprise when the man then uses the heel of his rifle to hit Tony on the side of his head.
"Naps are for babies or old people," Tony says petulantly. His breath tickles. "I lost an hour and a half!"
Anthony is about to kneel to deliver Vers what he hopes will be a finishing blow, when someone behind him echoes what he's thinking.
"Just wait a second there, Tones, not too fast. What the hell happened for you to drop everything and go to Asgard, anyway?"
The opposite-from-a-compliment (it's been a sore point for over four hundred years, he's aware he has issues) makes Tony huff fondly. There is no denying it: he's in love.
"Good question," Tony says. "With the way you crushed the rebels so publicly, I'd say that no one expects a paper trail follow-up. Why?"
"It's good to have you back, son." Fury squeezes Tony's shoulder, which makes him verklempt, he won't lie. Steve probably knows, because it's his turn to squeeze Tony's hand in comfort. "So, I understand we might have an impending Kree problem?"
Tony must see the longing on his face because he hums. "I'm afraid I'm too wound up right now to fuck your magnificent ass as you deserve. Next time?"
"It's fine." And it does sound like she’s fine. Thinking of it, she wouldn't have done the dance if she found it offensive.
Tony had shared pictures of the sisters with Steve here and there since he left, but it's always just the cats. He'd love to have the one with Tony. And for all that Rhodes has been Tony's best friend for decades, Steve is a little jealous that the kittens aren't a Steve-and-Tony thing only, which he realizes is stupid. Steve checks his own phone and sees that Tony sent him a new picture too: Calliope is on top of Snowball, who seems to be crying out in distress. No Tony in the photo at all, though, which is a bummer.
Tony had thought so too; in fact, it's the only reason he touched the portal. He's about to joke that he hopes he sings better than the other man when Steve turns his head towards Tony and his eyes widen comically.
After a tearful call to Pepper and a heartfelt reunion with Happy and Natasha, who'd hugged Tony for a long time, they'd set course to Europe. Rhodey reasoned it was best for him to talk sense into Steve and his gang first.
The Kree force that is amassing behind Yon-Rogg is impressive; JARVIS relays that there are 150 Krees on the ground and thirteen hovering fighter ships. Tony knows the hidden Avengers and allies must be impatient to engage. It's almost time.
He presses on the wall for his own bedside drawer and takes out what looks like a brand new bottle of slick. Steve said he'd wished the trip would bring them closer, and Tony wonders if he packed the lube, hoping to get him in bed. Probably, and Tony likes that idea. He enjoys even more how Steve doesn't waste any time in wetting his fingers and caressing Tony's hole, a tease more than anything. It feels nice, but he wants to get it on already.
Steve kisses him deeply again and there's a shift from emotional to hungry as desire ratchets up. Skin on skin, their hands roam to explore and feel as they both longed for. Tony lets himself fall backward on Steve's bed and Steve takes a moment to look his fill.
When he starts pushing and running at his turn, it's definitely while using super strength. They jump forward and Morgan screeches in pleasure as they run down the slope. After covering a third of the distance towards the lake, Peter nimbly jumps to sit in the tube and holds on to Morgan. Even though Tony and Jim had a clear advantage with their lead time, it's not enough. Peter and Morgan zoom by them right before reaching the lake, which clearly is the finish line.
"See that you are," Tony says, as he takes position in the tube. "I trust you, buddy! Ready Maguna?"
Steve salutes them both. "Your highness, Colonel." After a pause he continues. "Hear me out, Rhodes. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this."
"You've seen me cook before," Steve says. "I should manage Bruce's ginger chicken recipe just fine."
"I know," Barnes replies. His blue-gray eyes—why so pretty, though? Ugh—are full of guilt. "I'm sorry."
The fight has an air of a Wild West saloon fight from the Spaghetti Westerns Tony's mother loved so much. Maria Stark was a woman of contradictions: she was perfectly polished and poised when out in society, not a hair out of place and classically dressed. But once in a while she'd let her not-so-hidden fiery nature shine at home. Tony loved when his mom would make popcorn and they'd sneakily watch those old movies, just the two of them; Maria always shouted at the television during shootouts between the good and bad guys. He likes to think it would have thrilled Maria to see him—and she may have even cheered him on too—in an all-out brawl in a casino-slash-stripper-joint in space.
"I wondered if the Supreme Intelligence would allow you to come, Yon-Rogg," Tony says. Beside him Steve stills, focusing on the man.
"It's used for sensation play," Tony says. "Peeled ginger burns when inserted in the ass or the vagina. It's part of BDSM scenes, sometimes. It was used for torture, but you know how humans can be. Of course someone went, 'hey, why not do this for fun!'"
He turns his attention to the table again, where the game just finished. The croupier takes back all visible tiles, then everyone turns the hidden ones, including the house tiles. A woman to Tony's right cries out in delight, clapping. Her girlfriend, whom she'd been hanging onto all game —a lady with blond hair and shrewd eyes—has a lot of tiles with the same number. Nebula and Tal quickly explain to Tony what combinations are best while the tiles are still on the table. Again, there are similarities with poker, though having six different suits make the game more complex. It's soon confirmed that the blond lady won the round, and she passes a card to the croupier. When he taps it on a machine to his right, it projects a series of numbers in the air. The amount won, which earns her cheering and congratulations. And grumbling too, especially from the man with Tal.
Tony has what looks like small jackets, which Steve realizes are harnesses. He puts a red vest on Callie, who swishes her little tail but doesn't protest much, even when Tony puts her back in the enclosure. Then he places the gold harness on Snowball, who squirms and yells with outrage in the few seconds it takes to affix it with velcro.
"Please, Tony, I just... we thought—" Steve wrings his hands, distressed. "There’s so much you need to know. Let me—"
It's very late, in fact early morning, when an inebriated Thor walks them to their room. After a bear hug each and goodnight wishes, he continues his way down the corridor towards his own quarters, singing Wrecking Ball at the top of his lungs. The hilarity of it reminds Tony they need to bring back some of that mead home.
"Of course, of course, Iron Man too. But I meant you, Mister Stark. You will push the green energy technology sector again, I suppose, and I've seen your inventions," he gestures to his body. "Colonel Rhodes allowed me to use your lab—"
Nama's hand dwarfs his, maybe four to one. Tony acts as if it's not unsettling while being a little thrilled at the same time and keeps on his friendliest smile.
Thankfully, Steve has gym clothes at the Tower. He takes a detour to what used to be his floor – he guesses it still is? Nothing has changed anyway – to shower. He throws his soiled pants in the wash and his shoes in the trash.
After a day of cloaked surveillance and a scan of airwaves that shows nothing suspicious, Tony and Carol fly down to Avengers' tower. As soon as they touch the helipad, the defense system activates, pointing armament at them, and Tony hurries to speak up.
Five of the eight soldiers have blue skin, and they all wear black, green, and silver uniforms that are the same design as Carol's, star on the chest included. This is a coordinated attack.
But Steve's doom scenario didn't consider Tony. Their shortstop reacts in an instant, too, with an incredible bound to his left. He somehow catches the ball, securing one out, which makes Ward hiss in frustration. He didn't even have the time to transform into his puma anima. But that's not all: Tony also twists in mid-air, rotating his tail as a counterweight, and makes a beautiful hard throw to first base. Hyena-Rumlow, who'd started running as soon as Ward connected, realizes too late that he's toast. He tries to run back to first, but Bucky gets the ball before he arrives, wide smile displaying his razor-sharp teeth.
"I'm sorry, Colonel, but you left in a hurry and I was worried something was wrong and only wanted to help." He's speaking very fast, shoulders almost raised around his ears in defensiveness.
"I like Bella," Steve says. Tony had crooned at the babies in Italian a few days before, and the endearment had struck a chord in Steve's enamored heart. "But since you mentioned the Muses, it got me thinking and I keep coming back to Calliope." She held the highest rank, and sometimes the white kitten acts as if she's the most important being in the room. "Would you like that, Princess?" Steve asks the kitten, who's already finished with her two syringes of milk and is in a total food coma. "Calliope?"
The suit reforms into civvies as soon as Tony touches the ground, and he strolls into the back of the ship with the others. Once the rear hatch is closed and they’re out of view from the audience on the ground, they turn to each other, pleased.
The numbers on the remote currently say '616'. This time, instead of using the arrow pointing left, Tony tries the one aiming right. Even though a new portal appears, the digits remain the same which makes Tony frown.
