I was feeling my way down a long corridor two stories underground when I heard Tony think “oh, shit,” and then his voice was gone.
The muzzle that had covered Bucky’s mouth was off, dangling from his still-bound hands. Tony furrowed his eyebrows at the demon. “Hang on, could you have done that anytime?”
Or nothing. Everything could be fine, it could be some stupid mishap that would rob me of this chance to get Bucky away from them — and what if it was my only chance? — for absolutely no reason. I couldn’t blame Tony for it, either. All this daredevil b-and-e shit was my wheelhouse, not his. He
I’d hoped not to have to brawl with this thing, but hope doesn’t save you from getting killed by a demon, no matter what the inspirational Instagram accounts might say. I’d spent a long time preparing for exactly this. I had all my best gear and then some. Under my tactical clothes I had sigils to protect me and hopefully help subdue the thing in Bucky’s body.
“You had ‘em on the ropes,” said Bucky’s voice, sounding completely normal. A chill went through my blood as I stared. There was a mean, twisted smile on Bucky’s face that told me right away this still wasn’t him. (Who else would have been able to tell, though? If this thing got free it could make Bucky’s body do anything, and who would know he wasn’t responsible?)
“Mm. Yeah, you’re pretty finite there actually,” Tony said. “Like, you’re clearly just one guy.”
“Tony, I wouldn’t ask you to do that.”
I stood and walked closer to the magic circle. “Who’s ‘we’?”
A lot of us humans have seen through the proverbial veil these days. Some of us make our living out of it. But the deep, caveman knowledge that you’re not supposed to be seeing this never actually goes away.
Tony looked up at me and shifted his form again, going back to his everyday human shape, before taking my hand to stand up. “Yeah, I gotta talk to you about that,” he said. “Let’s get a little space.” He put a hand on my shoulder and led us farther from the circle, until there was enough distance in the cavernous warehouse between us and them that we could at least imagine we were speaking privately.
“Wanna see?” Tony’s appearance — rippled. His pupils changed shape, the sheen of his skin started to change, and he seemed to remember just in time that he should take his tank top off before his transformation ripped it apart. And
the demon said, its snarl fully audible through the vast space even though it didn’t sound like it was raising its voice.
were the wings.
I scrambled back to my feet and got my ass kicked faster than it’s ever been kicked before. You ever fight something much stronger than you, when you’re trying not to hurt it, and it’s trying to
Tony gave me a little smile and a wink. He didn’t continue transforming into the fully inhuman form I’d glimpsed in the basement, and I expected him to wind all this stuff back up and go back to his human appearance. Instead he let his wings stretch out behind him, then rested them on the ground. It seemed not so much bird-like as… bat-like? Which was what they resembled more, anyway, insofar as they looked like any earthly creature’s wings.
A movement caught my eye in the dark, something clearly bigger than any human. It was fast, shadowy, its movement distorted in the way that demons could do to the human eye. It had wings.
I made my way silently down to check it out, hugging the wall. Peeked around into the strangely laid-out area on the other side. A wide, shallow room split off into corridors on either side, walls interspersed with tinted glass, the hallways angling again at the edge of what I could see; it felt like it was built to confuse. I kept going.
was Bucky.
Bucky’s crazily strong arms, burning with a supernatural heat, hauled me all the way off the ground in his bound hands Darth-Vader-style and then knocked me back against the wall. All my focus went into trying to protect my head from the impacts, but he just pulled me back and slammed me upwards again, and this time my skull connected.
I let myself be buoyed by the spell into something almost like optimism. As long as I could hear Tony's voice — anything was possible.
“Yeah, that was me,” Tony said.
“I…” I sighed. “I don’t know any more than you do about this demon.” That was technically true, even if we both knew the emphasis was on the ‘technically.’
“Yeah. We can follow up on that later. Point is, speaking as someone with a few thousand years on the job, something’s happened here that’s different from any kind of entanglement I know of. If we treat this like a normal possession, I’m not sure what it’ll do to little Carnie but we’d most likely end up killing your friend.”
“Not anytime, only when it was fucking creepy,” I muttered.
I stood still, waiting, trying in vain to find the snapped thread between our minds as I’d briefly been able to before. There was nothing. I was alone with my own thoughts and the fury building under my skin. There was no time for that. I needed to bail now; I’d have time to lose my shit later.
up,” I suggested.
him. Now if only I had a clue what had just happened.
“I want to talk to Bucky,” I said. “The real Bucky.”
I’d known what this would be like, I’d known the thing would taunt me. But that didn’t stop the hot rage I felt. “Keep talking, asshole, the monologues are my favorite part.” I turned to Tony, who was still sitting on the ground, and held my hand out. “C’mon, I’m vertical now. Let’s get to work.”
“I kind of did, though,” Tony said, still sounding so casual. He looked at the demon distantly. “Like I said. I used to be that.”
you? Don’t judge me. Okay, I have more hand-to-hand combat training than your average demon, but that still didn’t give me much except a better chance of surviving long enough to run away.
I let my instincts lead me back the way I’d come — as fast as I could, but it was a long and tricky path through a huge facility that officially didn’t exist. It had taken half an hour to make my way as deep as I’d been.
I opened my mouth and then closed it without a sound. That… answered some of the rest of my questions, at least logistically.
Right. The other question I had about tonight.
trained to do any of this. And he’d still chosen to help despite the danger it put him in.
“Not sure exactly what happened,” he said, and I could tell his charm spell wasn’t having any lingering aftereffects, because I knew
It made a creepy Hannibal Lecter teeth-sucking sound with Bucky’s mouth.
No one in sight, no sign of any security agents coming, not a blink or a beep from anything in the room. But someone had been here. Were they still?
I threw an arm up in front of my face before I knew why, my sixth sense protecting me from being slammed full-force in the head.
We had Bucky. Against all odds, we actually
the demon cackled at me.
was bullshit. “Look, not everything is human business.”
“Not entirely,” Tony said. “That’s a whole nother question we need to talk about. Because I shouldn’t have been able to overpower this guy enough to do that.”
I wasn’t sure if that was a feint to avoid the subject until we could talk out of the demon’s earshot. Either way, I knew Tony had taken on a big risk to help tonight, and it might have brought down the worst kind of heat. “Just tell me if there’s anything I can do,” I said. “Believe me, I — I know that you didn’t have to do all this.”
couldn’t be Bucky — could it? A demon possessing a human body couldn’t manifest…that. Last I knew.
Made sense. I didn’t recognize this old warehouse, at least not from the inside, but it was the kind of place you’d find in the south Brooklyn neighborhood that was still called “Red Hook” by hopeful realtors and no one else. I could feel the criss-cross of arcane energy, all kinds of noise going through the air like radio waves. Ghosts, demons, and undead found safety in numbers out here, alongside those few mortals who had reasons — good or ill — to live among them. It was a dangerous place to throw an exorcism. But at the same time, it was the best place to hide a demon or two in plain sight.
“I — I believed you the first time,” I said.
My eyes registered the interior of a moving car, a stereo display in red informing me I was listening to the Queen station on satellite radio.
There was a long, boxy room with a rolling door at the far wall, one of those garage-door-style ones that roll up onto the ceiling. I remembered it well from the way down, because if there had been a way to just
“That’s what Bucky would want us to do until we can fix this,” I said. “I know him, he’s in there and he doesn’t want to hurt anyone.”
Every goddamn direction I could go was a big old roulette wheel of death now. But maybe, if I could at least figure out what was happening right now in front of me —
I hit the dirt and tried to kick his legs out from under him but, like the other demon who was still down here somewhere, he was fast as hell. His eyes glowed red, the demon in the driver’s seat not bothering to conceal itself. I wasn’t sure if it knew me or not.
“I saw another demon in the complex right before this one jumped me,” I went on, rubbing the back of my head. “Something big and fast , with wings.”
When I regained consciousness the second time, I was lying on a bare concrete floor. Something near me was too bright, the rest of the place too dark. Everything still hurt.
very on brand for you,” said Tony from my left. “Can’t do your whole noir gumshoe thing without getting knocked out sometimes.”
The thing about letting Tony put me under a “mild” charm was, okay, it didn’t wipe out my rational thought processes, but (I thought to myself, now that it was too late) it had still impacted my actions in ways I couldn’t notice by nature of the spell. At the time, it had felt comforting, even motivating, to settle into my total confidence in Tony, and go into action with him like a well-oiled machine.
“—but I still have to figure out if my security’s compromised.”
So yeah. That huge fucking door was open now.
“Are you sure?” I said quietly.
“In the meantime,” Tony went on, “I know we just busted him out of one set of kidnappers, but this guy needs to be captive.”
I plastered myself to the wall, holding very still. The shape was out of sight as suddenly as it had appeared.
The too-bright something, almost painfully bright, was the glow of a circle drawn on the floor, thick with arcane symbols, its power making my head throb. In the circle was Bucky, sitting cross-legged and still, with his hair over his face. Tony’s pendant was on the ground near him, suggesting that Tony had gotten it onto him at some point and he’d thrown it off.
Tony reminded me.
“Yeah,” I said. “What happened out there? You said ‘oh shit’ and I lost you.”
“Tony… how did we get out of there?”
“In fairness, I totally wore him down first,” I said.
"Amazing," Peter said with wide eyes. "Like, you're probably gonna stop short when you see him. Make that silly ga-ga face of yours and everything."
"No," Peter interrupted. "I know what you're gonna say, but you're wrong, so I'm not gonna listen to it."
"Steve, I
Peter was so focused on his wallowing that he didn't even hear his door as it creaked open, or hear his father as he stepped over to the bed and leaned closer, trying to figure out what he was up to.
—Peter was gone, but he had a strong feeling that had less to do with him and more to do with them not wanting to talk about it. Peter supposed he couldn't blame them much, since it didn't really matter anymore anyway. But the pain and guilt he saw flare up in his father's eyes whenever that period of time was mentioned was so visceral that Peter had half a mind to suggest to Papa that Dad talk to Uncle Sam about it.
“Look, I’m not saying you have to take that particular blonde, just that a blonde usually looks better on your arm when you're in Black Tie,” Obie continued.  “I’m just trying to help you, Tony, so you don't need to bite my head off here.”
Steve drummed his fingers on his knee as the the voting continued. Nay. Nay, that was nineteen total. Yea. Yea. Yea, now they were ahead again. His belly swooped as two more senators voted Yea, making it five in a row.
"Well… we thought we could keep it to five friends each for the twins, plus their families… I'm thinking it would be around sixty people total? So around seventy including the rest of us."
"But none of this is going to bring Jan back!" cried Howard. "None of it! Pym, you
Several heartbeats passed while Steve waited for Tony to answer, his bottom lip trembling. He knew that trying to push Tony into answering before he was ready often got him nowhere.
"Peter, I'm pretty sure they already know that," Uncle Bucky interrupted. "But since Steve's controls are completely useless, he can't do a damn thing except sit there and watch the planet go by beneath him. And he's still okay at the moment, but if he gets much colder—"
"Ouch," said John. "That's gotta sting a bit."
"Yes," he said as he raised his left arm, the red Reality Stone glowing brightly. Peter gasped as the landscape suddenly began to change, displaying a beautiful, thriving planet, rich with plants and wildlife, the sky a beautiful blue to match the nearby lake.
“The drug trials?  What drug trials?  And what’re you doing looking up drug trials for?” he asked, probably a bit more harshly than was necessary when Peter scowled.
"Oh fucking
At least, not until Steve.
Peter nodded, leaning back against the pillows and closing his eyes. Through the windows, Steve could see Bruce inputting his final settings and commands, with Natasha and Clint standing off to the side in the anteroom. His heart swelled a bit at the fact that almost their entire family had insisted on being there to support Peter. James hadn't been able to get away from D.C. and Thor had been called away the day before for yet another issue with his brother, but even they had both taken the time to get in touch with Peter to wish him luck.
It was a protest sleep, and those were never very restful. Peter would know.
"Cut out the damn chatter, Syler!" barked Colonel O'Brien. "Rogers, I've just been informed that all enemy aircraft have been pulled from Langaran airspace and we're not picking anything up on our radars either, so as far as we know there shouldn't be anything that's anywhere near the power plant. Are you absolutely sure that you're seeing what you're seeing?"
And then Peter pushed himself up on the bed, his eyes firmly trained on his image self.
"I'm really sorry about your mom, Tony," Steve murmured. "She sounds like she was a pretty amazing lady."
"Absolutely," Steve answered, his pencil at the ready. "Let's go."
Peter shook his head, clapping his free hand over his ear. "No, no, no. They can't have me, Daddy, they can't. I'm not gonna let them!"
Shrugging, Peter pushed open the exit door, allowing Gwen to step in front of him. "No, I'm not positive, but I think they might say yes if I ask my Uncle Bucky to come with us. He's super cool, he would just sit in the back or something and leave us alone, but he's also not someone that anyone would wanna mess with, so… it should be okay. And I think he'd even go to bat for me with Dad and Papa if he needed to."
"No, Tony, right now I just need you to listen to me," he said. "I hope by now you've realised that nothing you say to me could possibly change how much I love you, or how much I love Peter, so please,
Finally, after Tony dropped all sense of propriety and flat-out informed Cam and John that it was time for them to leave, Steve made sure all of the doors to the house were locked and grabbed Tony's hand, practically dragging him up the stairs and into their bedroom, barely getting the door closed behind them before claiming Tony's mouth.
"Yeah, that's right," said Bruce. "The final name was William Baker, but unfortunately we either haven't come across the correct files on him yet or there's nothing else in here about him, 'cause we haven't been able to find anything else."
Patting Peter gratefully on the shoulder, Steve made his way past the guards over to the guest wing of the palace, where he found Sam and Bucky just emerging from their quarters.
They had always been proud to keep the Malibu house free of that disgusting moss, right up until the very moment it was destroyed.
But Steve just couldn't see
He proceeded to file that thought inside its appropriate mental compartment, something he would need to discuss with Tony once he was able.
Peter nodded, trying to smile as he trailed his thumb along her cheekbone. "Yeah, I hope so. I know you're gonna do awesome over there."
Grandma tilted her head, eyeing Peter as though she was trying to size him up. "You know," she finally said. "You look a lot like your father. Has anyone ever told you that?"
"Ooh! Nice one, Pete!" Tony called from his perch on the back porch of their Irish cottage, laughing as Peter landed another snowball directly in the middle of Steve's chest. He had declined their offer to join them, preferring to watch from his spot by the fire pit where it was nice and warm rather than be out there slogging through the ankle-deep snow. The snow had started the day before, a rarity in December for this part of Ireland, but very much welcomed by Peter and Steve, who for some reason both loved the white, fluffy stuff. Tony had personally seen enough snow growing up in New York to last three lifetimes, one of the main reasons why he'd originally moved so much of Stark Industries out to California after taking it over. But as much as he hated to admit it, both Steve and Peter were New Yorkers to the bone, and Tony had a strong feeling that there was nothing he could do about it.
"All right."
"He dies," Tony continued, as if he hadn't even heard Steve. "Right there, in my arms. And I can't do a single fucking thing to stop it."
"Yeah, um… hi, Captain Rogers," Scott said, giving Steve a rather awkward wave. "And Agent Romanoff, I've—I've heard a lot about you too."
Like he had told Peter, it had definitely
"So, there's apparently two other people out there who were born with innate enhancements," Peter said. "Or, at least the potential for the development of them."
Ned's eyebrows knitted together. "Mongolia? What's in Mongolia?"
"Ours," Howard said as he shook Steve's hand with a rather hesitant grip. "I'm sure Tony never thought he'd be saying that."
"Oh gods, Steve, there shouldn't be anything for you to have to appreciate," Tony said. "That child in there loves you like a father, and that's really all there is to it."
"Slow," answered Bruce, not even looking up as his fingers flew across the keyboard. "Whoever encrypted this stuff definitely knew what they were doing."
"Peter Stark! Look this way, please! We need to get a photograph!"
A choked half-laugh worked its way from Steve's throat. "Me too, mo stór. Me too."
Steve dropped his head, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed. "Yeah, I guess. Pretty stupid, huh?"
"Tony," he said, low and tight. "I'm not—I don't—please, Tony, it's not what you think."
expression. His love for his current life notwithstanding, Papa did
“You weren’t that busy today?” Peter asked, trying to keep his tone light.  No sense in getting Dad all twitchy about money when they're about to interview a potential swimming coach.
"Great!" said Liz. "Peter? You think you'll be able to make it?"
The two relay medals that flank his individual medal look identical, but Steve can still tell the difference between them.  And while he does cherish the medals and the experiences he had participating on those relays, they just don’t hold as high of a place in Steve’s heart as his own.
Maybe he should pick fights with big, ugly purple brutes more often.
"O'Brien tried to get me to slander you," Steve spat out, his gorgeous face twisted in anger. "He tried to force me to say something that he could take and twist around so he could blame you for what happened to Bucky, and I can't—" He broke off, his shoulders shaking. "I wouldn't do it, sweetheart, but I think—I'm not—I can't lie, Tony, I've never been able to, and I think I only managed to make things worse, because—Tony, I swear, if he tries to do anything to you or to that little boy, if he even
"Oh gods, I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there!" the guy said, sputtering apologies as he reached a hand down to help Tony up. Tony took the offered hand and hoisted himself back to his feet, frowning as he focused in on the soldier's face.
And he did have Gwen to talk to. Peter shuddered to think how much worse off he would be if he hadn't been able to at least tell her about some of the stuff that he'd experienced. The whole spaceship and travelling to a different planet parts were actually kinda cool, but having a blaster held to his head? Being almost strangled to death? Watching as Dr Strange gave up the Time Stone to save his life?
"Honey, your appointment with the surgeon's office is in a week," Tony said, just a hair shy of patronising. "That's a total of ten days with the cast, where most people would have it on for a minimum of three months, probably more. I know it's gotta be hard, but you've just got to be patient or else you'll just end up setting yourself back again." Tony let out a short chuckle. "Listen to me, I'm starting to sound like Sam."
he tells himself firmly.
Tony thought.
"Peter, where's Dad?" he asked. "Why aren't you with him?"
He had just finished marking his final note when an alarm suddenly sounded, blaring across the dark and silent house and causing Tony to startle so violently that the pen in his hand ran across the entire page of his notebook, marking a jagged line right through his notes. In a flash he was on his feet, knocking over his chair in his haste to race towards Peter's bedroom.
"I'll be right back," she said firmly. And then she turned on her heel and walked away, heading in the opposite direction of the battle.
"Hey, Uncle Thor," Peter said. He rolled his shoulders as Uncle Thor released him, trying not to stare too long at the eyepatch covering his left eye. "I heard that you had some trouble with your sister?"
If he hadn't had his suit with him… if Tony hadn't had his suit with him…
"That's true."
"Just out for a drive. It helps clear my head," Steve replied. "Maybe you should try it sometime."
let it happen, which meant that he had to be ready. No matter what, when whatever the hell it was that was coming came, Tony had to be ready to protect them.
"Thank you," Steve said softly. With a final look at the pager, Steve turned to leave, nearly slamming into a blonde-haired woman who was standing about three metres behind him.
"He doesn't trust them," Peter said. "My dads, he doesn't trust them because they're Avengers. Isn't that it?"
“Well, he’s definitely smarter than me,” Tony said.  He locked eyes with Steve, trying to ignore the bolt of heat that raced down his spine.
As tightly as he would embrace their son, once he came home to them.
Pushing himself up from his chair, Tony hurried out of the Control Room and out towards the barracks, catching the front door to the building just as someone was coming out. Then he raced down the hall to Steve's—
"More like beat the ever-lovin' snot out of him, Tony," Bruce said grimly. "It was like fighting Abomination times about a kajillion. We barely survived."
mission," Steve grumbled. "
When Dad didn't respond, Peter continued.  “It also means that we need to go and check on Steve.  Dad, I’m worried about him!  He probably thinks we’ve abandoned him, and—and I’m afraid of what he might do!  He needs us!”
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"How in the hell does Dad make this look so easy?" he wondered as he finally leveled out, his head and shoulders getting plastered with thick droplets of fog as he flew towards the prison. His mishaps had messed with the timing that he'd initially calculated, so he made a quick adjustment to his angle of flight, slightly changing his landing site in order to stay hidden from the flying suit sentries.
"Yeah, I know," Steve said after a short pause. "Just… I need to talk to Tony on my own first, before we mention anything to Bruce. Something like this… I just need to handle it very carefully."
"Peter!" Papa cried as he grabbed hold of Dad's leg at the last second, preventing him from crashing into Uncle Bruce. "Peter, what're you doing here? You need to get back to the Tower!"
"You'll always be here," Steve breathed against Tony's neck as his thrusts slowly gained speed. "Tell me you'll always be here."
"That's understandable," said Steve. "There's nothing wrong with you wanting to make your own way."
"Fix… things?" Tony asked, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. "Fix what, exactly? And if Lang didn't get snapped, then where the hell's he been all this time?"
“Yes,” Papa forced out between his clenched teeth.  “Yes, I’m ready.”
He just needed to get it out in the open, which meant telling Tony the truth and then hoping for the best. Based on what Peter had told him it seemed as though Tony felt the same way about him as he did about Tony, so maybe once Steve finally talked to him about it everything would be fine.
"I've never said it to anyone," he whispered. "I've never felt it for anyone. Just you."
"Pete's got that sixth sense of his too, right? The… Spider Sense?"
"Yeah. I'm on the A-shift, which briefs at 0600 every morning," Steve said. "B-shift starts at 1200, the C-shift at 1800, and then the D-shift at 2400. We're up there flying patrols around the clock."
"Here," Bucky said as he screwed the cap off a bottle of blue superwater and handed it to Steve, who guzzled the whole thing down in about ten seconds. "Gods, Steve, I haven't seen you this bad since you first got the serum!"
"And bragging about that is not exactly the best way to make new friends, Peter," said Green Lady. She turned to Peter, smiling politely as he offered her hand. "I'm Gamora."
Steve thought as Pietro smirked, hunching down into his runner's stance.
And how things might have been different if he had done so! Would the Chitauri have even bothered with Earth if Howard hadn't accidentally found the Tesseract after the war, paving the way for HYDRA to resume their secret work with it? Nick Fury had stated that it had been Thor's appearance in New Mexico that had led to the Chitauri's initial interest in conquering the planet, but that hadn't been the whole truth. Loki was already familiar with Earth as one of the Nine Realms of Yggdrasil, but it had been the presence of the Tesseract that had lured Loki there, which meant that it had likely been the infinity gem hidden inside the glowing blue cube that the Chitauri leaders were after when they had promised to elevate Loki to Earth's ruler. Loki had just been a pawn in their game.
"Young Starkson!" Uncle Thor said as he drew Peter into a bone-crushing hug, ruffling his hair. "It is so good to see you intact again!"
"Cap's right, Ro," said Clint. "You two are Avengers, yes, but your battle experience is still pretty limited." He clapped a reassuring hand on his surrogate son's shoulder. "And personally, I'll feel a lot better having you guys as backup."
.  “Nat, you're up!”
"Yeah, I get what you're saying." Tony slid off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. He'd noticed that Peter's hearing seemed a bit more heightened as well, and there was also the fact that he'd said he could smell his peanut butter sandwiches almost a full minute before Bucky had arrived with them.
"It is indeed, Son of Wil," said Thor. "And now that it is back in the hands of the Chitauri, it is my thought that we must take measures to remove the other Earth-bound gems from this planet. It is not safe to have this many of these stones in such close proximity."
"Hey Mr Stark!" Ned said, waving as Dad rolled down his window. "Hey Captain Rogers, how're you guys doing?"
"A few," he said carefully. "But I'd rather not latch onto one or more of them until we're able to decrypt more of that data."
"Everything okay, Peter?" asked Ms Sharon as she swept inside his room with his breakfast tray. "I got a notation on my monitor outside that your heart rate's a bit elevated, so—"
Peter thought as his heart leapt into his throat.
“You know he’s only too eager to get involved, Mr Stark,” Pepper said, rather warily.  She leaned closer, lowering her voice.  “He says he always knew there wasn’t something quite right about Mr Stane, but never wanted to say anything.”
"Oh really? Now why doesn't that surprise me?" Sam asked as he turned to his boyfriend. "Is that why I've been stuck paying for everything lately?"
"C'mon, Rogers," Steve said through clenched teeth. Another claw pierced his side right below his sketchbook pocket, forcing Steve to bite down on his bottom lip. "C'mon, c'mon, c'mon—"
All of the exercise helped to tire him out too, which Dad and Papa were hoping would help drive some of Peter's persistent bad dreams away. So far it'd only been working about half the time, but that was still better than nothing.
Which, while it wasn't exactly what Peter wanted, it was at least better than nothing.
"No, goddamnit!" Tony shot back. "I'm not getting any information about him that's secondhand!"
The next chapter will post by Monday, January 11th 😊
"Thank you, sweetheart," Tony heard Steve say quietly, punctuated by various grunts as he and Thor took turns dodging huge chunks of rock being levitated by one of the Voldemort aliens.
"That's what I thought," he said. "So why don't I go make us something to eat while you tell me more about this idea of yours?"
lady doesn't count.”
"You're damn right he is," said Tony. "He was probably too good, so our government had no choice but to ground him."
“Yeah.  I think you might be right.”
As soon as his tablet went blank Peter flopped back onto the bed, frustrated. It annoyed him so damn much that his dads still thought he was too young to know what was going on, especially since Uncle Sam had already told him that the drone had attempted to fire at something, so it wasn't just a glitch.
(See the end of the chapter for
A loud clap drew their attention to the front, where their team captain Liz and their coach Mr Harrington had settled themselves at the podium. "All right guys, let's get to work, all right?" said Mr Harrington. "I'm only responsible for you for the next forty-five minutes."
"Of course."
"Yeah, hon," Tony answered. He sucked in a deep breath, jerking his head towards Bruce. "Calculations are done and JARVIS is getting started on rendering the devices now, so… we should probably decide who's gonna be the first to go in."
horrific day, when he woke up to find himself lying flat on his face on a hard, smelly cot and Yinsen stitching the back of his head back together with a sewing needle,
"It's all right, Clint," Steve said softly as Bruce guided Thor onto the jet, sitting him down on the opposite bench. Steve's eyes flicked between Clint and his distraught son as Natasha took her place on Pietro's opposite side. "You… just stay with your family. James and I can fly the jet."
"I gave him a lemon drop, Mr Stark," Gwen added. "He said it helped a bit, and my mom offered to call an ambulance but Peter said you guys were already on the way, so…"
"Everything looks good down here too, honey," said Tony. He ran a nervous hand through his hair, his eyes glued to his workstation. "Long as JARVIS says you're ready, you have a go."
Peter's eyes snapped open in surprise, an action he immediately regretted when the sun just happened to emerge from behind a cloud right at that very second. He immediately shrank back, crying out at the harshness of the light, which prompted Papa to reach into the glove compartment for an extra pair of sunglasses.
Tony scoffed, shaking his head. "No, it's not, 'cause that's the problem right there. It's not just you." Tears welled in his eyes that he hastily swiped away. "It's never just you. It's—it's everyone. The whole team. You, Nat, Clint, Bruce, Thor… And—and even—oh Christ, Steve, I can't—" He broke off, but Steve understood what he meant anyway.
less traumatic for the people who were snapped.
Steve's dimple grew even deeper. "Oh, yeah?" he said, rather cheekily. "Well, then, Mr Stark, what would you say to becoming my fella? Is that a prospect that you might consider?"
There was a short pause before Dad said, "All right. Thanks, J."
And now, he owes Tony a massive apology.
"You've had that damn worry wrinkle of yours stuck between your eyebrows for almost the entire day, and yet—"
"Hold on, you know Thor?" asked Dad.
"Mmm, honey," Tony murmured, squirming as Steve's lips trailed along the side of his neck. "You keep this up and Pete will end up scarfing down all of your pizza."
“Never thought, what?” Tony asked.  “What’re you talking about?”
And ever since the accident that had permanently grounded Rhodey from flying, his influence within the Air Corps higher-ups had significantly dropped.
"Good," Papa said, smiling as he ruffled Peter's hair. "See you this afternoon."
"Holy shit, Steve!" Dad cut in. "If Pete's right, then that means Thanos might be summoning these things from another universe! Which means that—!"
"Oh gods, Steve, I am
"No, it's actually worse," Uncle Bruce whispered, rather conspiratorially. "Just don't tell Thor I said so, okay?"
Steve pursed his lips as he swung his shield at yet another Chitauri warrior, knocking him into a group of three who were aiming some kind of RPG-like thing at Scott as he ambled by.
"Mmm," said Mr Toomes. "Well, the bathroom's that way, down the opposite hall."
A heavy layer of silence settled over the table, broken only by the arrival of their waiter with their food. Steve was relieved when Sam took the initiative to lighten the conversation while everyone ate, proudly announcing he and Bucky's engagement to a chorus of wolf whistles and well wishes.
Gulping, Peter tapped to expand the section, his belly swooping with the realisation that the bill sponsor must have deliberately hidden whatever this was deep inside this particular bill under the assumption that most people would be unlikely to come across it.
Warmth burst across Tony's chest at Steve's words, spreading down his arms and legs. He may not have been able to understand Steve's attraction to him, but that didn't mean he wasn't grateful for it.
"I don't believe we would," Steve said firmly. "Because we wouldn't do a damn thing without testing it all up, down, and sideways, and then again three more times. We wouldn't go anywhere or do anything until we know it's gonna work. No matter how long it takes." He paused, unable to stop the hope from blooming deep inside his gut. "Tony, think about it! We could have him back! We could have Peter back here with us, and if we can work it so he doesn't even have to remember what happened, well… then…"
"Okay," Steve said, wincing as Bruce stuck Peter's arm with the IV needle, his heart skipping when Peter didn't even flinch. "But when will he wake up? Because he's acting just like he did—" he broke off then, rubbing at his nose as a single tear escaped down his cheek. "I think something happened under the water, something like what happened down in Miami, 'cause he—he hates needles, and he didn't even move just now when Bruce—I mean, he's just not waking up, and—"
"You seem like you work really hard," Rogers said. "I've been really impressed with everything you've taught us lately."
"Oh you know it, do you?" Tony muttered, feeling instantly guilty when Rhodey shot him one of his
Because the Avengers… well… They were the
Grudgingly, Steve asked Tony to bring over his crutches, which once they were in hand and he was able to take care of business without any further issues, he realised how silly he had been to ignore them in the first place.
If that ever happens.
Only, he hadn't. Because, despite what he had thought, he actually wasn't in a plane about to crash into the frigid Arctic water, he was in his bedroom in Avengers Tower. The bedroom he shared with Tony, his husband, which also meant that Peter was sleeping in his own bedroom just down the hall.
"Yeah," answered Steve, sniffing. "We are, mo grá. I'm sorry, I'm just—"
Rumlow spat out. "I mean, I know I'm not as pretty as you are anymore, but I still thought that—"
But yet… that’s how it was.
Not with his first individual Olympic final.
“Mmm.”  Steve instinctively attempts to cross his arms, biting back a curse when the pain in his shoulder stops him about two-thirds of the way there.  “You’re thinking their falling out had something to do with Peter?”
It was almost as though Tony Stark, a man who could literally buy happiness, was actually miserable.  And that thought, as strange as it might’ve been, made him seem even more endearing.
Instead of answering, Steve pressed him even closer, cupping his jaw and angling it up so he could capture Tony's lips. The kiss started out sweet, even somewhat chaste, but then he felt Tony's tongue swipe across his bottom lip and he gasped, shifting Tony so he was now straddling his lap as Tony's tongue plundered his mouth, tasting him. Tony's hand tightened in Steve's hair as their kisses grew deeper and more frantic, giving it a slight tug and pulling a whimper from Steve's throat, just a second before he had to abruptly pull away in order to catch the frisbee that was aiming directly for the back of Tony's head.
Tony's eyes immediately went wide, then slammed shut as he fought the strong urge to grab Stacy by the scruff of his neck and slam him up against the wall until he told the truth.
"Yes, it does," interrupted Steve. He glanced over at Tony, who gave him a quick nod. "We think that the weapon that took out the power plant at the end of the Battle of the Continents was powered by energy from the tesseract."
"If that's what you call it," replied Thanos. "But random. Dispassionate, so no one could buy or bribe their way out of it. Fair to rich and poor alike. And instead of thanking me, they called me a madman. And then, what I predicted came to pass." He lowered his arm, the mirage of a beautiful Titan disappearing to reveal the very real ruins where they now hid.
"Yeah, no shit," Tony muttered. He cupped Steve's jaw, pressing a slow kiss to that sweet spot that always turned Steve's knees to jelly. "Can you do me a favour, though?"
of yet another breaking finger sending shivers down his spine so harsh and icy that white spots began to dance in front of his eyes.
"Twenty-seven, fourteen, thirty-six," Peter mumbled under his breath as the twirled the dial, letting out an exaggerated sigh of relief when the lock finally gave way. He gingerly opened the door, careful to not send it slamming against its neighbour, and shoved his books inside, grabbing his backpack and dropping it to the floor so he could put on his jacket.
Tony screamed inside his head.
"So… what, did she go up and ask him for his autograph or something?" asked Peter. "How'd she even know it was him?"
“No, I’m—” Steve starts, then breaks off.  Tony is right; the serum does do its best repair work when he’s not expending any unnecessary energy.
"Yes, Papa could use something," Steve said with a wink. "But only if Dad promises to eat too."
And it was
Apparently Dad was right.  Again.
"For the last time, I wasn't jealous!" Quill snapped from his perch on a pile of debris.
"Ah, yeah. All kinds of schematics and stuff for our weapons. Why?"
"Or, HYDRA didn't care if they were killed or not, as long as they completed the mission," Bucky said with a scowl. "Seems like they're getting pretty desperate if they're using disposable soldiers now."
“I will.”  Tony reached for his son, pulling him in for a careful hug.  “Don't be afraid to ask for help today if you need it, okay?  I don't want you hurting your finger even more ‘cause you're too proud to ask Ned to carry your books for you.”
"Well, that's good I guess, 'cause you look like you're about ready to drop." She reached out to squeeze Peter's arm. "Whatever it is, I hope it's not as bad as you're thinking."
"Unfortunately I am unable to determine that information at this time, Captain. However, I would not discount the apparent coincidence between he and Mr Stark's meeting and the server being accessed shortly following that meeting's conclusion."
Scott crossed his arms, looking rather sheepish. "Um… no, of course not. Not a time machine. More like a—"
so be prepared."
Tony had never been more grateful for his face mask than he was in that moment. During his time as a weapons manufacturer and socialite, Tony had perfected the art of hiding his true thoughts and emotions behind the mask of a flippant attitude and an I-don't-give-a-damn-what-you-think-of-me smile.
"No, you don't sound fine," said Peter. "What's wrong?"
"Tony—!" Steve cried as the tears started to flow, dripping into Peter's hair. "Tony, what if—what if I
"I have no problem with following a proper chain of command, Mr Stark," Stacy said proudly. "As a police officer, I'm pretty well acquainted with it."
"This is definitely quite the place you've got here," Tony said the evening before they were set to leave, as he, Steve, and T'Challa strolled around the palace grounds following their evening meal. "I guess I can understand why you guys would wanna keep it hidden away."
"Tony," Sam said as soon as Clint had clicked off. "How're you holding up?"
"Oh, nowhere," Peter said as he attempted a smile. "Just a bit tired."
All three of them could do with a few less of the nightmares that haunted their sleep at night.
"That's never gonna happen, mo grá, I promise you," stated Steve. "Without you and Peter… I don't think I'd be able to survive, so…" He pressed a firm kiss to Tony's lips, brushing the tear away with his thumb. "Now, let's go see what Thor has to say, all right? The more intel we can get on these infinity gems, the better we'll be able to figure out a way to stop them."
"Well, maybe 'cause your fingers are still white from gripping the handlebars?" Peter said as he jerked his head towards Steve's hands. "And your back and shoulders were all stiff too, like you were afraid something was gonna happen on the way here or something."
“You're welcome,” replied Peter.  “I really hope you come back tomorrow.”
“Yeah.”
"Yeah, probably," Tony said, his shoulders sagging in defeat. "The materials I use are patented and specific only to Stark Industries, but there are alternatives out there that are available, and the guy is pretty damn smart, I'll give him that."
"So, does your family usually do anything special for Thanksgiving?" Gwen asked, peeking at Peter over the screen of her laptop. The two of them were sprawled across the floor in her living room surrounded by their schoolbooks, with Peter flat on his stomach balancing chemistry equations while Gwen sat at the coffee table, working on a paper for their history class. Peter had already finished his paper on food rationing in Europe during World War II, thanks to some inside information from Papa and Uncle Bucky.
"Master Peter's current location is at the bottom of the lake, Captain, and he is being held there by an as-yet-unidentified entity."
Steve shook his head, halting the thought before it could fly away from him. He didn't need to be going down that road now, not while Peter was literally right in front of him.
"What?" Steve snapped, giving his head a quick shake when the cadet blinked. "Oh, yes, cadet, I'm fine. As you were."
"At your service, sir."
kid, sweetheart," Steve said gently. He held out his hand, gathering Tony close and kissing his temple. "And I don't think we're being unreasonable with wanting to protect him. Even if he doesn't agree."
Finally, after the pause that followed Sam’s statement stretched out almost interminably, Obie’s lips twitched, and he shifted, taking hold of the back of his chair like he was trying to use it as a shield.
"No," stated Thor. "It should in fact be me who makes this initial attempt, for I am far less likely to be affected by—"
, who was standing rather awkwardly next to Peter's chair, nervously eyeing DUM-E who was perched over in his usual corner
"And you need to stop downplaying it all the time!" Steve snapped, a bit too forcefully when Tony's head jerked back in surprise. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that, but please, don't do that, okay? Don't always try and deflect it away when I give you a compliment. Please?" He brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "I love you, and I'm so grateful for you and for everything that you do, and I don't only mean the glasses. I mean everything that you do for me, and for Peter, and for the rest of the team. We wouldn't be half as good at what we do if it wasn't for you, and that is a fact."
"Thanks for walking with us, Dad," Gwen said as they arrived at the front doors of the school, where Peter could already see the dance going in full swing. He had managed to keep his composure through most of dinner, only getting a bit teary when Gwen asked him how Dad was doing. He tried to explain how hard it was for Dad with not knowing where Papa was or even if he was still alive, but who also felt like he had to hold himself together for Peter's sake.
“Then whose was it!” yelped Dad.  “If not mine, then whose?  I should’ve known something, or… suspected
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks to the raucous crowd behind him, it took a few seconds for Tony to realise that JARVIS hadn't answered him. He held up his hand, asking for everyone to shut the hell up while he repeated the question.
"Tony," Papa said softly.
"On about eleventy-billion things, yes, I know," Peter cut in as he held the door open for her. "But that doesn't mean he's not human."
The van rounded a corner, sending Peter flying into a couple of loaded trash bins and bouncing off of a huge brick mailbox as one of the doors opened to reveal Gauntlet Man, aiming one of the nearly metre-long rifles right at him. Fighting against his rising panic, Peter peeled his freezing right hand from his web rope and shot another, catching it onto the rifle and yanking it right out of Gauntlet Man's hands.
“Oh no,” Peter said with a rather mischievous smirk.  “My dad’s only a little bit mad, and not at all about chess.”
“So, you don't worry about leaving Peter by himself at night?” he finally asked, nearly kicking himself as soon as the words left his mouth.  Everything he’d seen up to that point pointed to Tony Stark being a pretty attentive—if not overworked—father, and the last thing Steve wanted was to make it sound like he was criticising him.
Bruce had just finished rechecking Peter's temperature when there was a loud knock on the bathroom door.
“Steve—”
He had even said as much to Tony the previous night. They had been lying in bed after making love, with Tony's head resting on Steve's chest over his heart like they always did, and Steve had just broken into tears, apologising over and over for being so caught up inside his own personal bubble that he'd failed to even consider how things were outside of it. Tony, of course, had tried to soothe him, telling him that it wasn't his fault that Peter was sick or that he'd been denied his surgery, but Steve couldn't help but think that through his ignorance he had only compounded the problems that civilians like Tony and Peter faced every single day.
"By the Triskelion?" Steve asked in surprise. As far as he knew, the only people who ever ventured by that building were Nick Fury and Maria Hill, but no one had seen either of them in a few weeks. Well before Thanos' invasion.
"Please, baby," Tony rasped as his lips began attacking Steve's neck, kissing and nibbling across his throat. "Please, I need—"
"That's 'cause he loves him," Peter said softly. He pressed the button on his bed that turned off his overhead lights and leaned back, trying to get comfortable. "Finally Dad has someone who loves him."
The team had come home from their trip to Wakanda both rejuvenated and with a sense of optimism that they had sorely needed. For Steve, though, both of those had only lasted a few days before dread began to seep back in, weighing on him like a leaden cape draped across his shoulders. Every spare moment he could find he spent strategising, sometimes with Sam and Bucky's help but most of the time alone, while Tony shut himself up in his lab, refusing to take off his nanite armour case for any reason and constantly building things in his own attempt to beat back his demons of fear. More equipment for the team, including an upgraded version of Sam's Falcon pack, new Widow's Bites for Nat, and a new bow and hundreds of new arrows for Clint. Then there were the new armoured suits, two of which went to James down in D.C. as upgrades for his War Machine armour, but most used to repopulate the Iron Legion that had been retired ever since Tony had perfected his defence drone design. The Iron Legion suits now numbered close to thirty, at Steve's last count, and had been placed at strategic positions throughout the Tower and Compound's properties, programmed to launch at the first sign of anything out of the ordinary. Tony had even asked Principal Morita if he could station three of the suits at Peter's school, but was turned down when Morita reminded Tony that he would first have to receive approval from the city's school board. Since neither Steve nor Tony wanted to involve any branch of government in any of their plans, no matter how local or small, they had instead settled on positioning two of the suits inside the Tower's roof facing the school, ready to launch if given a signal by either Steve, Tony, or Peter.
Steve smiled, brushing another light kiss across Tony's lips. "Are you okay?" he asked. "You seem… distressed."
But as much as Steve loves to reminisce about that incredible time, he can’t allow himself to do it for too long.  Because ultimately, any trip down that memory lane leads to him remembering that that was also the year he started dating Brock, and… well…
As the elevator climbed up to the Tower's top floor, Peter's ears picked up the thundering beat of AC/DC coming from Dad's lab, a beat that instantly dropped to one-third the volume as soon as the doors opened into the penthouse. Peter and Papa's ears were both so sensitive to the loud noise that Dad had programmed JARVIS to drop the volume the moment he detected their presence in the penthouse.
"No, he didn't," Peter said, confused. "Why do you need to go too?"
“Are you looking forward to tonight, Steve?” Peter asked as they worked on opposite sides of the Fiction aisle, organising the books and dusting the shelves.  “I never got to meet the Mr Jarvis who inspired our UI, but my dad says that his lasagna recipe is the best he’s ever eaten.”
Which Peter and Dad both knew was just a bunch of HYDRA bullshit.
"Well, that's the thing. Scott said that he didn't get snapped," said Steve. "He said that this whole time he was stuck in something called the Quantum Realm. And that once he got out, he could've sworn that only ten minutes had passed."
"Do we have to?" Tony asked, mentally kicking himself a second later when Steve flinched. "No, no, honey, that's not what I meant. I mean, do we have to
"Maria, I'll be all right," Howard said quickly. "Go to him!"
“All right.  So now all we have to do is figure out who Pierce is reporting to,” said Tony.  He curled his fingers around the dog tags, squeezing them into his palm.  “And then figure out where in the hell they took Steve.”
Which likely meant that the stiffness he had felt while making Tony's breakfast and tying his running shoes earlier that morning had been because he had cracked another one of his knuckles.
"Are you good at keeping secrets?" she asked.
The mission’s finally here! 😮
Steve demanded, almost too harshly. "Why is all of this happening? I understand that we can sometimes have bad dreams, but why ones like this? And why now, all of a sudden?"
"You're always welcome to sit in the back," Steve answered. "But I prefer to not have to lean around people's heads when I'm trying to learn."
"Ah, I see! So then you've finally admitted to yourself that I'm smarter than you?"
"Um… I'd say… confused? What's—um… what just happened?"
"Guys, his EEG and heart rate are slowing down!" Bruce said over the intercom. "We're losing him!"
"Papa's got you, little guy," Steve whispered into his son's wet hair, kissing the top of his head and trying to ignore the freezing air hitting his bare back and arms. "It's gonna be okay now, I've got you."
Peter wrapped his arms around Papa's waist, closing his eyes as he breathed in. Peter had adored hugs ever since he was old enough to know what they were, and one of the things that he'd hated the most about all the weeks he'd spent in the hospital was missing out on so many of Dad's—and later, Papa's—hugs.
If his family was in danger, then it was Steve's duty to protect them.
Steve thought, stamping down the shame that immediately welled inside his gut. Of course Tony would believe it was worth it, sacrificing one single man in order to save the universe.
"And all that stuff's been permanent?" asked Tony.
“Okay, honey, it’s okay.  We’re gonna get through this,” Dad said as he stroked Papa’s hair.  “Pete?  JARVIS?  How’re we looking over there?”
"Pietro's with Clint on the jet, Steve," she whispered as her eyes filled with tears. "But Wanda, she's—she's—"
"Those odds are not good," added Drax, causing Peter to roll his eyes.
"You goddamn sick son of a bitch!" he screamed as he tried to blast one of the guns with one of his shoulder rockets. But the ship seemed to be made out of the same kind of material as Thanos' blade weapon, causing the rocket to bounce harmlessly off.
"Are you guys coming?" Peter mumbled, opening one sleepy eye. "I don't—I don't really wanna be alone in here. This bed's way too big for just me."
The beginning of the Quinjet's descent into Wakanda startled Steve out of his semi-doze, and he looked up to find Natasha gently prodding awake a sleeping Wanda, whispering into her ear as she yawned and rubbed her eyes. She shot Steve a sympathetic smile as she then gently poked Pietro in the side, whispering for him to wake Clint, who was sprawled out across most of their shared couch.
"And you think one of these gems is located in Wakanda?" Steve asked as he drew Peter against his side. The fact that he was even hearing this conversation in the first place did not sit well with him at all, but it was too late to do something about it now.
"Precisely," answered Thor. "In fact, I've reason to believe that that gem is also one of the six infinity stones."
"Yeah, that was just… just a one-time thing. They were gone for a pretty long time on that one, so—"
Once again Peter had to finish chewing before he could answer. "Ah, yeah. She's really good, our team's gonna be hard to beat this year."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine," Tony said quickly, ignoring Steve's skeptical frown. "Now, go on and get ready for bed already, will ya? I'm tired."
Tony breathed in, his face impassive even as his eyes turned glassy. "That's—that's good, Steve. That's really, really good, 'cause… damn, honey, I don't think I could've watched too much more of that, and not—"
Tony gave another shrug. "Well, you know me, honey."
"Just like this," Tony rasped as he rolled his hips up against Steve's, with Steve's answering groan nearly causing him to climax right then and there. Tony knew Steve had had no intention of asking Tony to return the favour, but there was no way Tony was going to pass up a chance to see his gorgeous husband let go.
"You're not fooling anyone with the whole innocent routine, honey," he said. "Or at least not anymore."
"M-my name is B-b—" the man started, then erupted into a coughing fit that was so wet and disgusting that Steve literally felt his skin crawl, the sound bringing back way too many memories of soldiers choking on their own blood in the battlefield.
Gwen snapped her mouth closed, giving him a quick nod as they took their usual seats at their corner table. "Oh. Well, it seems like you do that a lot."
“Pete’s doctor thought swimming would be better for his lungs during the colder months,” Tony says.  “You know how stuffy those pool areas tend to be, so—”
And all because he loved to read books.
“Just let me know if you have any questions, all right?” he added.
Dad shot Peter one of his goofy
Alt-Steve and his Tony had
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"Uhh, I honestly don't know," Peter whispered back. "They act like that a lot, but they don't live together or anything, so… kinda, I guess? I'm not really sure if any of us understand their relationship."
"Well, that's good," Peter said, breathing out a small sigh of relief. "But why—?"
"Was that supposed to be a joke?" asked Strange, his footsteps clanking against the floor as he followed.
As for making it beyond that, well… Tony preferred to not think about that. Not if he could help it.
"It's all right, little guy," he said. "We're right here."
"Oh, sure, sure," said Beck. He tapped the tablet again, bringing up a video of what looked like a surgeon learning a new surgical technique. "This was one of our test subjects, a third-year medical student at Columbia, who was able to learn a very complicated surgical technique without even having to set foot inside a surgical suite. The drug combined with the MAUDE glasses allowed her to perfectly imagine the problem and practise her technique until she was able to get it down perfectly, all without the use of research animals. Going forward, this will allow her to now perform this rather complicated surgery correctly the very first time, potentially saving lives."
The thought was enough to make Tony's heart slam so hard against his ribcage that he choked, nearly tipping over.
Dr Strange tilted his head, glaring at Dad so harshly that if looks could kill, he would've been splattered across the control panels.
"No, I'm fine," Peter said. He swiped at his nose, rolling his eyes as he accidentally dislodged his nasal tubes. "Just talking to my dad."
"Sweetheart, please come with me. Let me help you."
"I am indeed, sir," answered JARVIS as the quantum tunnel powered up. "Awaiting your signal."
And now just a couple of years or so later, he was living in their Tower, and Peter was calling him 'uncle'.
Tony thought, grabbing hold of it before it had a chance to escape and multiply.
Steve became so engrossed in Peter's artwork and their conversation that it didn't even occur to him to check the time until Sharon knocked on the door with Peter's evening meal.
At Steve's suggestion, the team had taken almost the entire summer off to rest and recuperate. He'd realised once he got home from Georgia that they had been going nearly non-stop for almost four years, and with most of the former HYDRA agents currently on trial and the rest being tracked down by SHIELD, Steve finally felt that they could take a very well-deserved break.
Pain pierced Tony's chest with an intensity that he hadn't felt since his open-heart surgery in the freezing Afghanistan cave.
"And no one wants that," stated Natasha.
Steve thought. But before he could continue Obadiah Stane suddenly appeared, walking right up to Image Peter and bending over him, examining him like he was a lab rat.
"Yes, Dad, I've got it," Peter said, giving Tony one of his
The loud
And then, once they did, Peter could
And now, Tony needed to do the same.
“Hmm.  But you might be now?” Natasha asks, in that sultry voice of hers that always sounds like she’s flirting.  “I mean, you know how to do it, don’t you?”
"Rain fire!" he ordered.
"Ah huh. And did you use soap?"
"Yeah," Tony said with a sigh. "That's what he told me too."
"Now just hold on a second here, Steve," interrupted Sam. "It doesn't do anyone any good jumping to conclusions when there might not be any ground underneath you when you try and land."
"All right," Steve whispered. "Th-thanks."
“Great.  And how was your day?” Steve asks.  “Busy day at school?”
“Yeah?  What about it?”
"We did, and I still don't think he's a threat," said Tony. "But what he said about there possibly being other enhanced people out there who would rather snap someone's neck like a twig than help them… I mean, with the road this government seems to be heading down, I wouldn't put it past them to have orchestrated all of this to make it seem like exactly that."
"Yeah, well, she's gonna be leaving soon," Peter said sadly. "We've only got another four weeks or so, and then—"
"Dad, I'm gonna be fine," Peter said quietly. "You don't need to watch over me."
For an entire month they kept him, drugging and torturing him to such an extent that Tony was positive that the only way Steve had managed to keep himself alive was out of sheer stubbornness. By the time Peter discovered HYDRA's hidden base and alerted the rest of the team to Steve's location, he was so badly injured and otherwise out of it that when he first laid eyes on Tony after the ensuing battle, he honestly believed him to be yet another HYDRA apparition.
Peter sniffed again, swiping at his nose with his sleeve as he pondered.  “Just some orange juice, please,” he finally said.  “I’m not—I’m not really all that hungry.”
“Go ahead and start on the render, J, but hold off on the manufacture until I give you the go.  I need to do some more thinking first.”
"Pete!" Tony shrieked as he rushed towards him, only to be stopped by Sharon's raised palm.
"No!" he said sharply. He couldn't do that. Not now, not while—
"Pete, stay back!" Dad cried as he flew back into range. "Webs only!"
Ned quirked an eyebrow. "Yeah, she is, Peter. I've never seen her cheeks turn that pinky colour when she hangs around anyone else, so yeah, she is!"
"Tony, your
"Yeah, I know he is," Steve said as he lifted his head. "He's a survivor. Like you are."
"No," stated Natasha. "We're all on the same page. Just…"
time to think things through. Even if it was only a second or two.
"No, I understand," Ms Sharon said. "I need to go contact Colonel Phillips anyway. I'll come back to check on you in a bit, all right?"
His entire world, right there in his arms.
Even more proof—
he thought as he tipped his head back, thudding it against the stone wall. He drew in a deep, shaky breath, gripping Steve even tighter as if he hoped he might be able to squeeze some sense into him.
Steve shook his head, sucking more air into his hungry lungs as he released the iron grip on his knees and glanced down to where Tony was lying next to him, curled onto his right side like he usually was. For a moment, Steve could only stare at him, certain that his eyes were trying to trick him as he raised his hand and placed it carefully on Tony's shoulder, a choked sob of relief tearing from his throat as he realised that no, Tony wasn't just a figment of his imagination. He was actually real.
"Peter, tell me who spoke the quote, 'Uncommon valor was a common virtue'?" Gwen commanded.
No, he didn't.  And all because he was the biggest goddamn coward in the entire universe’s history of cowards.
Steve shrugged, attempting to be nonchalant and failing completely. "I don't know."
I don't require your permission to ogle my husband," Tony shot back. "In fact, I'm pretty sure I don't even need his."
Blinking his eyes back open, Peter returned his gaze to the screen, jerking his head back in surprise when he noticed that the gibberish had somehow changed. He leaned closer, narrowing his eyes, his mouth falling open as he watched the text literally morph back into the original Russian characters that were displayed when he first opened the file, almost like they were animated.
“I know.  I just—I just—”
And more than a bit frightened.
At least a full minute had passed by the time Obie cleared his throat, his hand gripping the top of his chair so tightly Tony could see indents in the rich burgundy leather.
Peter inwardly rolled his eyes. "Am I always gonna need a bodyguard, though? I mean, I don't mind going places with them most of the time, but… well… Gwen and I, we'd kinda like to be able to—"
"Uhh, I thought everyone knew?" Bucky said, confused. "It's not like it's a bad thing."
“So, do you think those charges are really gonna hold against that asshole?” Sam asked Fury.  He had his arm tightly around his fiancé’s waist, as Bucky looked like he was either ready to punch something or burst into tears.  “‘Cause if we just went through all of this shit for nothing, then—”
Then, Steve’s eyes meet Tony who mouths a ‘hi’ and receives a muted ‘hi’ in return. Tony who has been holding his tongue and his empty coffee mug because he doesn’t know what to say.
“Tony -,” Steve starts.
That’s how bad it is. That’s how low he’d landed and frankly, he doesn’t even care or want to get up from there. Because, once again.
It’s the maniacal part of him, he swears. The same part that makes him sway on his feet until he grabs onto the corner of his work desk as his knees give out on him. He lands painfully on his arse, even if it’s on the bench. Small mercies, Tony thinks faintly.
Then carefully, she confesses. “I’m meeting him on Monday, for lunch.”
He hates it.
Pepper and Happy visits him on the weekend. Sometimes Rhodey, but
He forgets to breathe for a second. Taking the next inhale with sudden sharpness, pulling in more of that overwhelming scent into him and he closes his prickling eyes against the force of his inhale.
“What did I do?” he asks again. Almost begging, feeling that sharp prickling behind his throat ascend to the back of his nose and then his eyes, watery.
But not as much as it did with Rogers.
Then there is Steve. There’s Pepper and Rhodey and a whole ass team who calls him their dad and Steve their mum because they think it’s funny but Tony lets them because he loves them plenty and they are his family.
Very unlike Natasha's and Barnes' newly blossoming affection.
Tony opens his mouth to ask, “Why would I see Steve? When?” But smartly closes it before a word escape.
A heavy sort of weight sitting in his stomach and weighing down instead of plummeting to the bottom. It’s nice.
“Not really, no.” She says truthfully. “Are you?”
Chair toppling backwards and hands shaking, he braces himself, left arm spreading numbness from pectoral to fingertips.
“To what?” Tony hums, scrolling up his inbox and shooting a quick reply to Pepper.
“I can feel her.” He says, when Tony casually asks him what’s with the ‘freezing’ when it comes to Wanda.
“They’re mutants, Pep. I’m just being -,”
He opts for silence for the first two sessions, strongly arguing that saying nothing could bring no harm to either until she points out that, “Not if you’re in the middle of a battle.”
“Rhodey and I talked about it.” He says. “We’re trying to get her to -um - deal with it better? But -,”
Tony stands, letting her see him; look in him for what she wants to see, and when she’s done, she says, “Thank you, Tony.”
Maybe this should be the Avengers’ reconciliation room. Well, that would have to wait and see how the talk with Rogers’ goes first and Tony has to admit, he’s a little apprehensive at that.
Tony drags his body closer until their chests touch; bare skin against warm fabric.
when they found her. She lost her other half and then,
“So what did you say?” Steve asks, leaning back in his chair once he’s done demolishing both of their orders.
“That,” Tony leans back, taking in the list for the umpteenth time. “I’m still trying to figure out.”
Rogers who keeps going. “What do you want me to do? I apologized. I
“For what?”
Newton's Third Law of Motion or not, sometimes being a bastard is fucking worth it.
Once upon a time, she would have pushed and pushed, needling her way through regardless of respecting privacy, but now, she’s different; grown, matured – they all have.
“I know how to protect myself, Steve.” Tony reminds him.
He feels awful all over, worse than when he’d tasted death minutes from licking him up whole.
When he reaches for the glasses, Steve lends his hand.
Tonight, they end up in Steve’s room since Tony is staying the night anyway. Besides, someone has been asked to redo their mission report and Tony couldn’t stop finding it amusing.
Wilson swears to murder the ‘Bucky and Tony team up’ something gory while Steve smiles indulgently at Tony from two seats over.
Tony hides a snort behind his mug, amused by Steve’s expression. “You don’t approve?” he asks, picking at a lone thread hanging off of Steve’s right sleeve.
Rhodey chews on his cronut thoughtfully and makes a face. He switches the cronut with a strawberry sprinkled donut and asks, “Does he know?”
Steve bites back his glee, lets his grin stretch as wide as it can get as he hugs Tony by his waist and kisses his nape.
“Truce?” Steve’s eyes dart from the limp leaf to Tony’s face, widening in surprise.
“Fucking hell!”
“I know.” Bucky repeats. Pressing lips to his forehead and then temple.
“Stop,” he warns, lips brushing over Tony’s nape. Breath hot and wet and something clench and shiver in Tony’s chest. “Once you’re healed, I’ll fuck you so hard you forget your name so, be patient. For now.”
Tony believes her.
He stops, suddenly so unsure of himself as reality begins sinking in, questions start swirling, doubts - now that the panic has resided leaving shock in its aftermath.
That in itself buries his desire to check on Bucky, see for himself how he’s doing; make sure he’s all right.
He can feel sweat dripping down his neck, droplets forming under his moustache and beard. He can feel a trail or two running down his temple, dammit.
Tony tries to convince Pepper to check him out before his fifth session. He fails.
“She’s mourning, Steve.” Tony reminds him. “You can’t blame yourself for that.”
It’s so adamant in that that Tony never even is there when the Rogues touch down.
It immediately reminds him of a certain someone and Tony may be present, but nothing in him is ready to
“Think if I buy all the stock and resell them to new, better idiots – Is that possible? Can I do that?” Tony muses aloud.
Tony feels his throat constrict. He doesn’t know what to say. But the good thing about group talk is that, there’ll always be someone else to fill in the blanks if you can’t yourself.
Tony recoils so fast, he turns away to focus on the holo-screen with rapt attention instead.
One day, he tells himself.
He has work to do. He’s still damaged and fragile but he cannot stand by and watch people die when he knows he can do something about it.
she says. “At least this time, you didn’t walk out.”
“I know.”
The next morning, he wakes up to Natasha at the foot of his bed, Steve still fast asleep in his own.
There you go.
“How are you?” Steve asks.
He holds himself in defiance, as though expecting something or someone to call him out on it, but nothing does. No one. Not even Steve.
“We’re going to Wakanda, Mr Stark?”
He looks at her to see she’s been watching him. He shrugs.
Tony huffs, “Say that again, I dare you.”
Because when he opens his eyes, Steve’s watching him. Unabashed, like he’s entitled too and Tony… he finds himself not minding that even a bit. He thinks he’ll do that too if it was the other way around.
The guy who nerds out over space and machines and finds solace in obnoxious music. The guy who has years of his life still ahead of him with nice people – good people – people who genuinely care for him.
Tony himself nearly makes a purchase of a lifetime supply of shower stuffs when Pepper intercepts him with; “She got shops where she’s going, Tony. You’re not packing her away to remote island.”
“Mind me asking how did it go?”
Maybe, given time, he’ll find a way to call her a friend again.
, Tony,” she rolls her eyes, air-quoting ‘team’.
Ever since they’ve vouched to give them another chance, nothing much has changed between Tony and Steve.
Reprise worse: when he’s in the middle of a movie on a Saturday night in the Avengers’ compound.
“But boss,” Friday carries on, “Sergeant Barnes asked for you.”
When Pepper comes calling him for dinner, he’s refolding the last pile of the clothes he’d ruined in his frantic hunt.
Out of all those angry snipes, and jibes, something pure blossomed. They became friends, and it’s the most hard earned relationship in the entirety of Steve’s life, he doesn’t want to lose it. He refuses to lose it.
And by the look of it, Steve hasn’t forgotten about that. Tony swallows a spoonful on Samgyetang feeling something flutter in his chest.
Tony waits for the bitter feeling of betrayal to make its appearance. He waits a second, then two. When it doesn’t, he shrugs at her and wishes sincerely. “I hope you both have fun.”
He doesn’t want to care.
His deep sigh is an open-mouthed hot breath that collects wetly over Tony’s skin. A beat or two or maybe thirty passed before Tony feels warm, wet lips skim across his skin, wrecking shudder down his spine and he stiffens abruptly.
Swallowing the sharp pain behind his throat, Steve looks at him and demands again, “Tony. What did I do?”
Always has been. Not only is he book smart, but where Tony deliberately abandons the tact, Rhodey picks up after him. It’s how Tony knew that Rhodey’s smart when it comes to social cues too.
After he’d recovered from the shock of finding Tony, passed out on a puddle of his own vomit, floor littered with shards of glasses and broken furniture; aftermath of yet another outrageously reckless night of partying with all the pretties in Cali.
“Tony.”
Funny no matter how many times you've faced the same thing over and over, you can still be completely unsure how to deal with it.
"No worries."
Steve doesn’t look up from washing; bowls, plates and cutleries methodically. But he sighs, and he answers, “He should.”
Pepper jerks upright, pulling her feet off of his lap and onto the floor. So much for not-being-in-relationship stopping her from worrying like a mother hen.
“You can’t be doing this. Send someone else. You’re old and it’s too dang-”
It’s with nothingness, deafening silence and nothing else. It’s with emptiness and void and nothingness, that Tony
“I do?”
The shade he’s chosen today is purple, but he’s opted out of wearing it.
“Thank you,” Pepper murmurs, pinching at her nose bridge.
The feel of betrayal clouds him over like the cold of Siberia, racking his brittle bones and twisting his tongue speechless as he takes a step away from her. And another.
He wanted to ask her if she’s trying to see whether he’s planning to take on the same path as Barton by telling him about it. He didn’t in the end.
’ mug closer and breathes the hot aroma of spiced tea in.
Maybe it’s the aftermath of the avalanche from Saturday morning. The concoction of listening to Steve lose it, the grating desperation in his usually confident voice. The pleading. Which lead to missing him.
Well, actually it’s Shuri who called, asking James to come over for a look over his arm – “I’ve got some improvements!” – she insisted even as James declined and at the end of the day, even the Winter Soldier crumbles under a teen-girl’s pressure.
In the process, he rediscovers self-harm. Only now, it has a whole other meaning to it and it balms his frail mind each time he swipes a line of red down his inner thigh with a razor.
Tony’s golden.
Silence has muted him so down that he couldn’t be bothered to find his voice again.
If he stops and thinks, this will be
He lacks the sass and doesn’t engage in banters. He’s way more professional and sticks to points during their session and maybe that’s for the best.
Cups his neck, a thumb tucked beneath his chin and he kisses him indulgently.
. Somehow, that makes Tony feel stronger.
“Hello to you too, Mr Stark.” Pepper pecks his cheek. “How’re you doing?”
Tony’s throat runs dry. This time, he can’t look away. Try as he might, his breath catches and his heart stutters. “The former,” he confirms shamefully.
So, he restrains and simply shakes his head, gladly leaning into Steve when the man throws his arms around Tony’s neck from behind him, their chairs bumping.
And believe it or not, in the two months of Tony’s stay, he had no shit to say.
Tony still celebrates his survival with something rewarding when he’s back in the tower every Sunday night.
That little boy from Brooklyn who always stands up when he falls.
Tony misses her something fierce.
A grin breaks out on Steve’s face, blinding Tony for a moment as his modified heart stutter pitifully in his chest.
On his final week, they discuss about the possibilities of facing Rogers and how Tony will and should ideally respond.
. Inside and out and around Tony. Everything about him felt like an instant ascend to Heaven, chorus singing, violin playing, bells chiming; “I love you.”
And Tony nods, a lump grating in his throat. Then he realises that Rhodey cannot see him and he says, “Same here, buddy.”
Maybe, he thinks. Nobody likes to remember when their heart got broken. Much less, when they broke someone else’s heart.
She sucks in a breath. “Then I lost him, and… I was alone again; the only destructive variant among the saviours.” She smiles wetly.
He introduces someone named Jean Grey and Hank McCoy; one a red-haired female who reminded Tony of… well, Wanda, except more matured and wiser.
Stunned clear blue eyes imprint in his brain as he shuts the door behind him and texts an apology to Rhodey for his hasty departure before taking the elevator down to the garage and out of the compound.
Pepper snorts, opening her eyes, a smile now dons her face and Tony thinks, mission accomplished – well, sort of.
And yet here he is, still a free man, staining borrowed towels red from his first flesh wound since he started this vengeance streak.
How the other guy is insistent on stepping forefront now that he had had a taste of it, albeit in a fairly friendlier environment.
It’s extremely easy to do that. The significantly familiar scent beyond helpful. If he just keeps his eyes closed and imagines himself with screams in his chest instead of eerie silence.
It makes him sympathize with those who had flanked his lonesomeness once upon a time.
His blue eyes are clear tonight, regarding Tony with so much affection that it’s staggering.
If Tony doesn’t fear magic so much, they’ll probably have a closer relationship. Like Peter and him perhaps. But it is as it is. They’ve talked and forgiven each other; her for assuming the worst of him and him for the mental manipulation she did to him.
“I got the deal signed in Paris and made it barely in time for my dinner date
“Steve.” He pleads, voice thick with tears, tucking Steve’s head under his chin. He’s hyperventilating. “Fuck.”
“You’re unregistered.”
Rogers’ patience is worn thin by ever Sunday evening and mostly, he just shuts up. Sometimes, the gym is occupied with only him inside.
“Woah, space! That’s so cool! Nice to meet you too, Miss Danvers.”
He remembers the frailty of everything they stepped on. How they talked and loved and talked and loved so they could build something stronger.
“Did you tell anyone?” Tony asks, genuinely concerned. Magic is shit. Has always been shit.
If any one of them looked for him, he doesn’t know. He’s busy talking down a teenager to stay put in his school bus.
Not after Barnes boldly asked to speak to Tony in private on Tony’s very first day back as if to prove that he wasn’t afraid to get in an enclosed space with only Tony and himself.
Eventually, after they knock over a vase and watch it break into thousand pieces, Bucky hoists him up and walks them to the bed, and it may be emasculating if he was in a different state of mind. But right then, head spinning from Bucky and only Bucky everywhere, Tony lets him have it.
Even if that scar across his chest gives him a verdict against Rogers, he’s not sure if Rogers had escaped unscarred as well. He knows super healing. But he also
The blue of Steve’s eyes are intimidatingly steely, like he’s so offended by the idea that Tony’s suggesting. “And you want me to, as well.”
and he’s pretty sure it’s more detailed than that but Tony’s too exhausted to pay her any attention.
“Thursday. Like we planned.” Tony answers him.
. Deadly and quiet.
“Try again.” She snorts, scraping the chair away from the table with her weight, already standing up with her empty plate and drinking mug in each hand.
She opens her mouth, and he can already hear bullshit coming forth, “I can’t guarantee you anything at this point. I’m doing my part, his body is doing it’s -,” she wavers, her lashes flutter and then something shifts in her.
A shower too, going 28 hours without one.
A tangled-up mess where you can’t even find where the beginning or the end is, and Tony doesn’t know if he’s ready to deal with that magnitude of ‘moving-on’ yet.
“I – You’ve-,” She falters, her gaze flicking back to her mug before she heaves a breath and looks straight at Tony.
“Tony?”
Not a second feels too rushed. Not a wisp of their breath or a beat of their heart. All of him poured liberally into that single moment, focused, entranced and all consumed.
That morning – after everything had been said and forgiven – a new promise was made. But he broke it. Like a true champ, he broke it, and with it, Steve’s heart as well.
“A match, Mr Stark. Your soul and the Captain’s are the perfect match and whichever path you take with this knowledge, I strongly suggest you don’t mess around with what has been sealed with power beyond our abilities to wield. A match when broken, invites the worst calamity, while a match, united, may hold the key to peace.”
He breathed. Tony; from his expensive cologne to the perpetual aroma of coffee that had now become Steve’s principal source of comfort and, he
It’s… Honestly, he doesn’t know what it is.
Bruce’s frowning, one flavour packet held in each hand as he tries to decide which one to put into the molten sugar while Tony sits with Natasha at the dining table, watching the end of Wanda’s cardigan disappearing down the hallway.
for him?
So much so that he decides to fuck it
“Tony,
She’s
"A four hundred dollars bed?" His voice rises, scandalised, "What d'you take me for, muffin? Your boyfriend's a billionaire."
He dared to tell Steve to let go and start over but really, doing so is tough.
Tony turns back to the console and focuses on flying.
“- and I said I love you too?”
He tells Pepper and Rhodey about his progress. They’ve sat through a couple of sessions with him as family as well; lots of tears and lots of hugs happened there.
Ego says, Rogers knew. Reality remains, mundane; there is no way Rogers could have known the depth he’d ripped into Tony’s armour.
He hears rather than see Steve inhale sharply.
He closes his eyes and when he opens them back, the shock is completely wiped out, replaced by painful resignation.
His heat embraces them both, Tony with his shirt off and his back cold but his front warmed from the inch separating him from Steve.
“I missed you,” Steve confessed. Rasped it out roughly, and he kissed the corner of Tony’s mouth, then on it.
Tony gives a call to Wakanda. Princess Shuri is delighted to help. She also asks for Peter Parker.
Tony can only hope they’ll be wiser, thread the water more carefully, take their time to pause and wash away the mosses and rid of creeping barnacles so nothing piles up until when they stop and look back, their foundation had become a hideous thing. Like Tony’s and Steve’s.
“I was going to say that time where you tried to buy my forgiveness with a basket of strawberries because you knew I was on a diet and I love fruits but you forgot that I was allergic to strawberries, but, sure.” She smiles at him sickly sweet.
Doesn’t matter, Tony’s beautiful however he is. And now, he is Bucky’s husband.
Helen Cho blinks, comprehension dawning upon her before she suddenly looks sick; lips pressed tight like she’s holding back her words from him. Good, Tony doesn’t want to hear her preach ethical violation to him. But he keeps looking at her until she agrees; because she has to. She has to know that he needs Bucky alive. No bargains in that matter.
If not for an excuse to allow himself drink in the sight of the man who took a laser to his chest for him and almost died. The man he'd lost his sanity for, killed for and then ran away from because he is a coward.
But of-fucking-course Barnes hears him and of-fucking-course he yells back, just as loudly and obnoxiously, “You wish!”
Steve turns to the sound curiously, smiling stiltedly when he catches Tony’s eyes.
Rolling onto his back, he brings Steve along, head still pressed beneath Tony’s chin but body cautiously curled into his side rather than sprawling on top of him.
They part on a good note. Tony’s free from the med, with an appointment scheduled two months after. He contemplates talking about Steve Rogers during their next session.
“No!” Tony seizes, his own big bite of the chocolate sprinkled suddenly dry and lumpy in his esophagus. He swallows painfully and shrugs, “I don’t know? I didn’t tell him.”
“I didn’t think friendship is a valid excuse to interfere in other people’s life.”
Few days after, Rhodey knocks on his door.
“Sorry,” Tony licks it off and kisses the fragrant vanilla into his mouth. Then he leans in close, with an impish glint in his eyes, just to whisper a naughty, “Mr Stark-Barnes,” into Bucky’s ear.
Steve who had always stood rock still even when his entire world collapsed around him.
Steve’s hand around him is a familiar feel and rhythm that awake that unique-to-him arousal which has been dormant in Tony for years.
“What’s the plan.” Steve asks, sliding into a chair opposite them.
“Should have known to not trust the brochure,” he sighs, giving up on the fries that are too limp to be saved.
Then he waits.
a spy, Tony.”
It has been a bit difficult easing Steve through their initial awkwardness upon reconciling; they kept running over each other’s words, or stammering and laughing abashedly.
It wasn’t even a flawless recollection; it’s a mess of memories jumbled up with sharp jolts of emotions. Variety of them; from then and from now.
Not a single regret or ache or even fear that worries. Nothing.
, “I’m sorry.”
And that - That shocks Tony into a stop; eyes blinking wide with disbelief, he stares at the man in front of him.
And boy, does his heart wants -
, “Relax, Rhodey. I can take care of myself.”
For a hot second, Steve leans in as if he’s about to catch Tony’s lips -
It’s miraculously warm outside, Tony wonders if one of the mutants is responsible for the climate around here.
Her cream blouse is new.
“Pepper!”
“I don’t know.” He tells her, eyes wide and pleading.
That he may be reckless, he may willingly put himself in danger’s line. He may be passively suicidal, but he isn’t that bad when he’d had tried to survive once, right?
Nothing below the necks and truth be told, Tony’s been thinking about breaking that spell these last few days.
“ETA in 56 seconds, boss.”
For a man with an incredibly high IQ reading, he can be embarrassingly stupid.
Fuck.
“Next time.” Tony cuts him off primly. “Call me. Or text. Whichever that’s convenient.”
For now, he looks up in surprise as Barnes invades his space. Or not.
“Remember when I said I want us to move on?”
“The verdict then, was heart failure stage four. Stage three after some medication but the prognosis was bad, given a few more months, it was going to go back to stage four and I – I didn’t want to die.”
“Or, I kind of figured that there was something else going on between you and him. Which was why,” She pauses and inhales sharply.
Bruce is quiet and withdrawn but Tony knows his demons.
He stops typing to look at Tony when Tony lets the silent simmer. “What?” He chuckles. “You sure are getting entertained by this.”
What’s the point?
“Nothing unusual,” Tony bats him off, hiding the fact that he’s intimidated by Rhodey behind a sloppy grin.
“Which is why we’re going with you to find out. If you want.” He stresses, because this is her decision; her life and her everything.
If the universe decides to show him mercy, it’s in the form of keeping Tony away from Rogers.
One palm up against Steve’s chest pushing lightly, he warns, “Steve,” low and gentle.
Steve pats his shoulder, joining him to shake T’Challa’s hand and thank his hospitality like two very respectful old souls they are.
His reply seems to make Steve melt as he sags heavily down on Tony (something nags about this position in the back of his head, something very small that vanishes soon after) and chuckles. Then he buries his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.
when he used to literally lose clumps of his hair worrying to death each time Steve left for one of his searches for Barnes.
comes with pre-packaged hurt - but he’s aware of the risks and he’s willing to take them.
“When did you start, Steve?” He asks, holding his breath.
Tony gulps, nerves thrumming wildly as he throws a hand over Steve’s back and holds onto him.
He doesn’t specify when or where but they both know that.
But Tony doesn’t miss how she didn’t protest outrageously over him misusing the millennial term (or whatever that is).
“I’m Peter, Miss Danvers. Peter Parker. I’m from Queens.”
Fuck.
“Did he?”
Pepper rolls her eyes, unhooking the straps of her Jimmy Choo, going bare feet as she hefts her weight to sit on the nearest table.
He misses his medicine the next morning, completely forgets about it until he’s tucking himself into bed and his eyes are drooping one second and the next, he’s bolting upright,
“Fucking tease.” Tony growls into his pillow. Steve’s thumb over the arch of his hip bone rubs a circle and he nips at Tony’s lobe, “I know.”
And that thought’s still swimming in his head.
He pulls out the chair opposite Steve who has his head ducked down, eyes trained bleakly on the wooden table.
“Tony.” She chuckles. “Tell me how long you’ll be away.”
Tony breathes out, lets her have her own moment, he’ll just be a fly on the wall as for now.
“White picket fence is a fairytale, babe. Howard fucked me over seven ways to hell. I wouldn’t be a good father or a husband.”
, “This wasn’t the one you were wearing in Wakanda.”
She flicks another glance at Tony, this time her lips curling mildly at one corner, a near miss but Tony sees it anyway and he exhales, long and slow.
It sneaks up on him. Like some kind of surprise attack. During breakfast. When he’s in the middle of laughing with Pepper over dinner. Worse, when he’s the centre of public’s attention.
And the thing is, Tony had to pick himself up after that, and where was Steve Rogers during then.
So he doesn't panic, doesn't mean he expected this. He just knows better about reality. When tomorrow comes, they'd give a call to his doctor, take it from there. As for now he walks across the room and sinks to the floor next to his lover.
Tony frowns at the stolen orange juice in his hand. “You don’t think it’s a bad idea?”
He doesn’t really appreciate them. Doesn’t say sorry because,
Maybe he’s a coward. Maybe he’s afraid if he sees Bucky, he’d be accused to be the cause of his near death experience.
Of course, team bonding involves meetings, games, movies and mostly sparring. But Tony would be in the suit then and Rogers doesn’t single him out, keeping his professionalism which Tony is convinced, something unfeasible.
Tony wants to make sure she knows it’s in
Tony watches him enter the kitchen, followed briefly by Natasha; they wash and rinse in silence. Then they too, leave with a murmured set of goodnights.
He buries his face in his hands and shakes his head clear; elbows propped on his knees, fingers raking through his hair and he glances at Tony from an angle.
“I’m sorry for being rude, but excuse me on the likeness that you’re being just as rudely intervening as well, what does my lack of relationship with Steve Rogers has anything to do with the defence of the earth? Because you and I, forgive my frankness
Tony blinks, as if he’s surprised; the only genuine emotion Steve ever saw from him today, then he looks away.
Hot lips brushing tantalizingly, puffing out hotter breaths with each word expelled.
But there’s a certain sort of numbness to it now than the wild raging fire it had been then.
He can hear the bathroom door open if he keeps his eyes carefully closed still.
Pepper nods, brushes a palm over he pressed skirt – a nervous habit on display, which is rare for Pepper – and looks up at Tony, eyes clearer. Brighter.
Mostly, it’s the exhaustion from his quickly draining manic energy that keeps his mum.
And her, to let all those canned up bad shit stirred by Tony out of her as well.
“I’m telling you this, because you have to understand why I allowed what happened to happen.”
On guard as if Tony’s an attack dog, and he speaks as if the words are bitter on his tongue. “Have you?”
“I don’t.” Tony cuts him off. Doesn’t want to hear it, no longer
But he’s specifically pessimistic when it comes to himself. Unlike Pepper.
If he focuses his vision, he can make the hourglass figure of Natasha, looming in her red sweater. Probably – no, definitely – keeping an eye on Tony.
This time though, it’s Tony who interrupts him in the middle of something.
The answer is, no. He can hear it from her apology. Ross has always been a bastard anyway. “Shall I ask for leniency for some of the -,”
So, James tells her, “As long as I can bring Tasha over.” Then his cold blue eyes swipe across the living room and he rattles off more name. “The doc wants to meet the kids. Steve misses the goats. Wilson wants to help with the hays. Tony’s driving -,”
Pepper grabs the remote and pauses the damned show. Her slim body shifts as she turns to face Tony, her own ice cream bowl going on top of the coffee table as she wraps her arms around her midriff and looks at Tony expectantly.
Loved him so much he would have died for him, but –
Tony would think that this isn’t Bucky Barnes either but they haven’t seen
“I’m fine.” Tony croaks, coughing and wincing as he inhales again.
“Not on my watch,” Tony grumbles.
But apparently, the rule of good day is that it lasts for exactly 24 hours, because he jolts awake to FRIDAY reading out the time; 0004 and when he tries to go back to sleep, he couldn’t.
Oh. Tony realised.
They schedule his next appointment two months from now.
Tony’s still unsure of how he feels about her so he keeps their metaphorical distance stretched as taught as the day she took off leaving him to deal with a semi paralysed Rhodey all by himself.
“I used to work in a car producing factory. Used to assemble the engines.”
“On my way, darling.”
He gets what she means. He’d once thought that he will never apologize for what he did then, but now…
“You want to know what I think, Stark? I think you and Steve are being uncharacteristically stupid. I think Barnes got himself tangled somewhere between the two of yours’ mess and now he’s suffering too. I think all three of you should -,”
, flooding his everything, washing away his pride and identity as he sobs and
But the death that shook him was of Jarvis which he never even saw but he felt it in his core. Like a part of his was ripped out to never be replaced.
Whichever the case is, it feels illicit to speak louder than the sound of their combined breathing.
But Steve fidgets some more. “I – er – Thank you for – the truce – the leaf. The truce-leaf.”
His own arms are curled tightly around Tony; face pressed into Tony’s throat with his palm still clutching onto the reactor in Tony’s chest.
It’s an eerily silent night. Perhaps the eeriness comes from the lack of their screaming tension that predominated earlier.
He knows, the instant Steve finds out, he’ll leave and – And, no.
“Got some work to do.”
He doesn’t know if he should be sad or Roger should. Not that he thinks Rogers will care, or maybe he will. He is the beacon of good, after all. Even after he beat Tony to death, Rogers will always be an angel to everyone else.
She has many talents; reading people is one of her bests. The way she read him once was wrong, according to her. The way she’s reading him now, Tony doesn’t know her verdict, but the result is her palm against one of his cheeks and a soft press of her lips over his forehead.
