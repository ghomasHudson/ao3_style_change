Sherlock was a little confused by what was happening. He felt John’s finger on his skin and it felt quite nice. He still felt cold, so he wrapped his arms around John’s body, pulling him closer. “You’re soft,” he mumbled.
John nodded, leaning down to peck kisses on his lips between catching his breath.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He looked down again. “When I realised you didn’t know . . . it was hard enough missing you but then . . . I had to . . . do something to reach you.”
“Oh, do shut up,” she said as they walked over to the hall. “It was a lovely ceremony, don’t you think?” she asked him.
That made Sherlock relax a little. “I know. I wanted to share it all with you. I never stopped wanting you to be there,” he confessed.
John looked at her and almost replied, but she was just mumbling in her sleep. He closed his mouth and headed back down.
"Good," Sherlock said. They both felt tired and comfortable and safe as they drifted to sleep.
"What do you usually do when I go to bed?"
“You’re the best student in this class,” she said.
“There’s a new case, John,” Sherlock continued, his voice sounding more confident than he really felt. “I’ve had some information for a while, but the details of it became clear while you were out. It’s the case of a solitary man. Had some troubles, not a lot of friends, but overall high functioning. However, recently he took on a flatmate and his life has changed. They’ve become friends, I suppose, but the man is struggling because just living together and working together . . . it’s not really what he wants. He wants something else, more. It took him a while to understand it, but now he can’t seem to find the words to explain it to the flatmate.” He paused for just a moment and added, “Do you think we can help him? Should we take the case?”
A wave of relief flushed over Clara’s face. “…I don’t know what…to say…my goodness…thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
One of the officers scanned the car suspiciously before slowly approaching John to look at his ticket and check it against the train’s manifest he had procured from the local train station.
John sighed heavily as he looked directly at Sherlock, but he had trouble focusing on what his companion was asking of him. It was clear that someone was using Carberry’s murder as a front or avenue for the drug, but it still wasn’t clear why someone would go out of their way to frame him for the murder. Not only was the idea disturbing to John, but the whomever they were dealing with might not have been aware of his cases with Sherlock who would inevitably involve himself in the case.
Sherlocked grinned as he eyed Saxon. “I’ll admit you gave me a run, but I’m afraid that your kindness toward the needy was your downfall.”
Sherlock stepped toward the front door of the sitting room to stop the police from exiting with John. “Detective Baynes, you of all people should know you’ll need more than just a visit for an arrest. I’m sure Dr. Carberry is more popular than you give him credit.”
He turned over onto this back to look up at the ceiling, studying it as he inspected the ceiling molding that the chandelier was hanging from.
“I believe the two historians hired first had bickered with each other over the direction of the exhibit. So, the director thought it would be easier to hire a new one.”
Sherlock looked upward slowly at Mycroft who was now trying to smile back down at him. Sherlock took a moment before nodding, sitting back in the sofa with a heavy-laden sigh.
“I think that’s enough for tonight,” Sherlock said as he closed the journal before placing it back on the fireplace mantel, “I think you need a warm bed.”
Sherlock groaned as he rose from his chair to cross the sitting room. “I need to speak with Lestrade once we arrive at the Yard. The police shouldn’t be speaking with journalists.”
“Well,” Mycroft started, rising out of his chair, “I’ve officially had enough. Goodnight, Sherly. Dr. Watson.” He then quickly exited the room.
The heiress gawked at John who just shrugged before looking back at Sherlock. “With the governess, Mr. Holmes.”
“Sher—”
Lestrade shook his head. He took a moment to look around the space before lowering his voice. “Holmes, you can’t see Dr. Watson. We’ve already taken him to Westgate.”
John nodded as he sat back with a sigh. He closed his eyes, letting out one more sigh as he felt a hand on his thigh.
Mycroft squinted his eyes, expressing his skepticism. “Sherly…are you certain?”
“All right,” he stood up from the table to walk over to Sherlock to give him a kiss on the forehead, “I shouldn’t be too long. I’ll see you in an hour or so.”
“What?” John finally let out as the mounting casualties related to his colleague’s murder began to sink in.
“Well!” Mr. McArthur slapped an armrest to get everyone’s attention, “speaking of ghost stories, would you gentlemen be interested in visiting our newest acquisition?” He leaned toward Sherlock and John.
“Watson, please. I’m too exhausted to…” Sherlock waved a hand around instead of completing his sentence.
Mr. McArthur laughed heartily before lighting a cigar. “I suppose I should take some time off seeing that we have esteemed guests in our presence.” He winked in Sherlock and John’s direction.
“You’re the best officer I have, but I think it’s appropriate to put you on the desk…” Lestrade’s thoughts drifted as he barely paid attention.
John swiveled to look behind himself, seeing two men now standing at the entrance to the factory. John backed away about a foot or two as the men slowly approached him and Gladstone who was now snarling and barking. As one of the men quickened his pace, positioning himself to strike John, John let go of Gladstone to duck before the man made contact. John punched the man in the stomach before the man grabbed him and forced him to the ground.
They walked out into the alley, inching along the side of the building toward the front facing the main street. They could see Coney talking to a woman whose back was facing them. Sherlock signaled to John to have him cross the street quickly to get to an opposite corner. As John followed along, he looked behind himself at the pair, noticing right away that the woman who was speaking to Coney looked familiar.
“Is this,” Sherlock began, “the only entrance into the cells?”
“Holmes,” John dropped a bag, “why did you bring so much for a week’s visit?”
John grumbled as he ascended the staircase to the upper floor. He took his time as it was evident that the staircase had not been in use for quite some time. The metal creaked and groaned under the weight of each and every one of John’s footsteps, and it felt as if the staircase would buckle underneath him if he climbed any higher.
“Detective Baynes, you still haven’t explained yourself.” Sherlock angrily responded.
“Like I was saying,” Sherlock turned back to Carberry’s journal on the counter, “I’ve figured out the standard notation in Carberry’s journal so we should be able to pinpoint whatever he was trying to achieve with the antidote.”
Sherlock held a finger up to his lips to quiet his companion before motioning with his hand for them to wait. They waded through silence that was accompanied by the city noises emanating from the street before a shadowy figure appeared in the window of Coney’s office. The figure disappeared, and not long after, Coney exited the building before walking briskly down the street.
“You were right that those notes from Carberry’s journal were only marginally helpful since we were missing a key component for the stimulant, but Schuller’s on it…”
Part of John envied Gladstone’s ability to sleep during such troubling times as if they were at home at Baker Street and not forced to hide out from all of London’s police force in Mycroft’s estate.
Mycroft nodded in silence as Sherlock paused to study the fireplace. “Sherly, you’ll need to let the police do their job. Dr. Watson is quite mediocre at best, but that
“—previous violent tendencies—”
Wiggins caught up with Sherlock to find a man lying in the middle of the room, bloodied and mutilated just like the priest had been.
“Is this really necessary?” John responded as a police officer shoved him into a cramped cell that was occupied by three other people.
“Holmes, I’m sorry…” Lestrade began, this time his voice sounding calm, although unsteady, “but with this and the eyewitness accounts we have…I’m afraid that…it doesn’t look good for Dr. Watson…”
Yet, John told himself, once more, that he needed to trust Sherlock. He was the only person capable of solving this mystery.
John groaned as he positioned himself to climb through the window, landing as quietly as possible on his feet. Sherlock disappeared out of the kitchen and up the stairs to their sitting room. John looked out into the hallway to see the front door closed before following Sherlock. As soon as they opened the door to the sitting room, they were greeted by an overly excited Gladstone who pounced on Sherlock at the ready.
Sherlock sighed as he leaned forward. “I understand why you would want to protest your innocence; however, I must ask everyone involved the same questions.”
“To investigate the cause of that raucous.” Sherlock grimaced at John before brushing his hand away.
Detective Baynes had dragged Sherlock closer to one of the openings, but the latter stepped to the side before the detective could push him out the opening. The force of the sidestep and the lack of awareness on Detective Baynes’s part sent the detective flying out of the window with a deafening shriek and down the edge of the cliff. The weight of the fall caused Sherlock to almost join him, but he grabbed a hold of the opening before tumbling to his death.
Sherlock nodded slowly as he looked down the staircase.
John lingered in the automobile, debating whether he should just drive off and cut his losses. Stanley took his time approaching, bowing slowly as soon as he reached John.
John shot up straight as soon as he heard Sherlock’s voice. He looked at the cell bars before launching himself off the cot to get closer to Sherlock.
John let out a loud groan.
John sighed as he stretched his body on top the bed, watching Sherlock change into some fresh clothes.
“This is nice, isn’t it, dear?” John whispered as he hugged Sherlock tighter.
“Yes?” John asked, wishing Mycroft would stop looking at him the way that he was.
“Holmes,” John whispered, “we should leave. This will become dangerous if the men discover us.”
John turned at the sound of a voice to his right, looking upwards to see that one of the train employees had addressed him.
“Holmes, I am still at a lost…”
“I think you’re doing a fine job, Whitehall,” Moriarty waited before shifting in his chair, “the government could use more people like you.”
John hadn’t given the comment any thought since then; before Carberry’s murder, Sherlock had often alluded to the fact that John didn’t care about him as much as he cared about John, which of course was categorically false. It always irritated him; Sherlock’s personality was often frustrating, but that was part of his charm and the reason why John had fallen in love with him in the first place. Yet, considering everything that had happened so far, something about Sherlock’s demeanor was troubling.
“When this barrage stops,” Sherlock shouted at John who was cowering to the side, “we’ll only have a few seconds to hop out of the window to get to the luggage car!”
John stared wide eyed at Sherlock as if he didn’t understand him. After a moment of silence, he finally nodded back as Sherlock let go of his face. John walked back to the chair he was sitting in before.
“Thank you.” Mycroft responded as he then quickly hustled Sherlock out of the office. The group walked down the hallway until they reached the main entrance to the maximum-security cells. The director walked ahead of Mycroft and Sherlock, approaching two guards: one standing watch near the entry cell door that led down to the prisoners’ cells and one sitting at a desk.
“Schuller.” Sherlock whispered to John as soon as one of the men grumbled the name.
Sherlock ignored him as he walked up to the bay windows to see Mary speaking with the police out on the street. Sherlock waited for what seemed like forever before motioning to John that it was clear for them to leave. They hustled out into the hallway with Gladstone who indicated once or twice, and very excitably, that he thought he was going on a walk. They managed to quiet Gladstone before leaving through the back door out of the kitchen.
“…because this whole ordeal was an accident, wasn’t it, Ms. Clara?” Sherlock addressed her immediately upon entry.
“Ah, my children!” The elder Mr. McArthur appeared in the parlor wearing an elegant dark smoking jacket, “glad to see that you’re both here.” He motioned for James to follow him through the room to the back parlor which was connected to the front with a large arch opening. Madame Loire was in the room setting up cake and tea.
However, John knew Sherlock wanted him to be cordial with Mycroft at the very least. And considering the lengths his companion had gone to prove his innocence, John knew he could muster up enough courage to spend one dinner with Mycroft.
Lestrade nodded as he crossed his arms. He sighed, shuffling on his feet. “I need to speak with you about the Carberry case.”
James groaned loudly, sinking into his chair as everyone else stared back at him. “École, father.
Sherlock shook his head. “There’s a connection between his Schuller case and whatever Coney knows about your case. We need to find out.”
“Holmes…” John whispered sharply. Part of him couldn’t believe what he had just heard, but then again, nothing about the last several days was normal in any way.
“Everyone,” Sherlock interrupted the silence after a moment, “would you all please kindly wait in the back parlor. I think it’s time that Dr. Watson and I seriously investigate the comings and goings at this house.”
“What, Holmes?” John walked over to the fireplace to pet Gladstone before joining Sherlock at the table.
Sherlock let go of the employee he had pinned and John holstered his weapon. “Officers, we have the culprits. I’m one of the passengers, Dr. Watson.” John searched around in his coat for his ticket before holding it out for the officers.
John sighed again. “Well,
“Who?” Sherlock repeated, stopping in his tracks in order not to spook Henry any further, “who’s dangerous, Henry?”
“Holmes,” John stepped forward, ignoring Sherlock’s command to remain quiet and undetected, “I think I see someone in the mill.”
“Dr. Schuller, I would like to give you the opportunity to make your creation better.
As soon as John agreed to dinner, Mycroft’s expression brightened. John forced himself to smile back but it was most likely the most difficult thing he had ever done in his entire life up until that point, including trying to figure out whoever was framing him for his colleague’s murder.
“Thank you, but of course we’re not having dinner to talk about me.” Moriarty leaned backward in his chair as he crossed his legs. He stared back at Whitehall intently as if he were studying him.
John gawked at Sherlock who had turned away to head back toward the house. “Holmes, really. There’s no ghost. It’s probably some wayward gardener.”
“We need to prepare first, Mr. Wiggins,” Sherlock walked back over to his desk, “whatever is in these vials unleashes some sort of dangerous drug…” He found a vial that had a few drops of the drug at the bottom.
John grabbed Detective Baynes, wrapping an arm around his neck as Sherlock ran for the revolver. Detective Baynes struggled against John before punching him in the stomach which sent John to the floor writhing in pain. Sherlock lunged for Detective Baynes, grabbing him by the waist. Detective Baynes knocked the revolver out of Sherlock’s hand, but that allowed Sherlock to tighten his hold on the detective.
“Which,” Sherlock said as an aside, “caused the aforementioned explosion.”
John interrupted Sherlock by pulling him into a tight hug. He could feel that Sherlock was stunned by his response but then felt his companion hug him back after a second or so.
“We’re moving you to Westgate before the trial, but as you can see there’s little recourse you have. You might as well confess to save everyone the time and energy.”
“…Mr. Holmes has connections, specifically through his brother, but Mycroft Holmes has been censured and grounded until he cooperates with the police. Diplomatic privileges, I suppose.” He ended in an irritated huff.
“Of course, sir. Mr. Whitehall will arrive early tomorrow morning.” The maid nodded before disappearing.
John was facing an incensed Sherlock on a train platform. One of the train employees passed by them, shouting for everyone to board the train. Sherlock had his arms crossed with one eyebrow raised.
Sherlock took a moment before turning around to face John directly. “You remember your medical conference from the beginning of the year.” He stated as a matter of fact.
Madame Loire’s expression slightly changed as she finally nodded.
“Fine. But please keep it down. And if he’s not here within fifteen minutes, you’ll have to leave. I do have other tenants to mind.”
“Thank you, Madame Loire.” John said with a smile as he accepted some cake before trying to pour himself some tea, but it was a little awkward because the cart was facing too far away from him.
Mr. McArthur waved the woman off. “And this is our dearest maid, Madame Loire. She’s from France!” He added as if originating from France was Madame Loire’s most impressive yet annoying quality.
Sherlock turned slightly to look up at Mycroft. “It appears so…”
The butler looked back and forth at Sherlock and John. He took a moment, shrugged, and then walked briskly away from them toward the other end of the hall.
“Good god! Sherly, what on earth is going on?!”
“Mary,” Sherlock patted Mary one last time before disengaging himself from the hug, “I have it on good authority that Watson isn’t the man they’re looking for. He was with me the whole night when this supposedly happened.”
Sherlock expressed surprise. “Really? That’s unfortunate. Pray tell what the reasoning was behind it?”
“Wait until I say ‘now’.” Sherlock instructed, pointing to the door.
John sighed, knowing that Sherlock would remained stubborn on the subject of traveling to the other side of the country.
John thought, referring internally to his companion giving him a solid alibi but obviously unaware of his actions that day.
John groaned in agony as he twisted his body around to see Sherlock and Detective Baynes wrestling near the openings.
John looked around at his cellmates: one man wearing tattered clothing was sleeping soundly on a cot off in the corner and the other two were loudly arguing with each other before it turned into a mild scuffle.
Saxon barely acknowledged him as he continued to struggle before he was dragged out of the room. Soon after, Sherlock walked to the middle of the study; from the look on Sherlock’s face, John knew full well that they were about to hear Sherlock’s grand revelation concerning the case.
Sherlock and John both nodded, however both could tell from James’s unwillingness to participate in the conversation that it was something of a sore subject.
The door to the room threw open with a loud thud as Detective Baynes entered. John sat up in his chair, shocked by the man’s behavior.
John sighed in his head as he dressed, taking his time to cross the bedroom floor to reach the door. He took another moment, reminding himself of the strategies he typically used when dealing with Mycroft in order to prevent any unnecessary confrontation.
As soon as both guards realized that one of the guests was indeed Sherlock Holmes, both men’s expressions lit up, showing enough youthful curiosity that almost drowned out the dankest of the surroundings.
Warden James laughed nervously. “Uh, yes, Mr. Holmes. In case of a fire, the cell doors in the basement unlock, trigged by the smoke, along with the opposite door leading out, but the guards are well trained to keep the prisoners in line.”
Mycroft frowned before letting out a sigh. “My informant also told me last night about the death of a priest who serves in the Whitechapel neighborhood…the body was just discovered late last night at the neighborhood parish church, but the police have yet to be informed. The death seems…suspicious…”
Detective Baynes laughed. “Well, we had to make sure you were convicted, Doctor. But you made it easier for us by being at the scene of the explosion. I told you, I’ve been following you closely. We have eyes everywhere.”
“…which is why I can trust you to help me now…” Sherlock handed Wiggins the page and the vial.
Mycroft patted Sherlock on the shoulder once more before motioning for the group to file out of the office. Sherlock finally acknowledged his brother before turning around to exit the office, but Lestrade stopped him before he could leave.
Sherlock laughed as he walked further into the room. “I found a torn piece of a coat in the scaffolding at Saint Paul’s. It was covered in chalk, so I surmised that perhaps we were dealing with someone who works in a university. The erudite references to history and such could only come from an enthusiast or a trained historian such as yourself…”
“I haven’t and I won’t,” Sherlock responded as he pointed behind himself at Mycroft, “Mycroft spoke with a contact of his and we can get you out of this prison today. We’re staying in one of Mycroft’s estates before the trial.”
John sighed once more for good measure as he sat up straight in the chair. Despite the seriousness of Sherlock’s actions in the last few hours, John knew he needed to be completely honest.
Sherlock nodded his head slowly. “Yes, of course, Watson. Power and greed are commonplace.”
“Really, Watson…” he puffed a few times on his pipe, “I think the clues are evident and obvious…”
“Sherly,” Mycroft started again, still seated, “are you sure you don’t want me to cancel my meeting?”
“…Standish was involved with a German railroad company that runs business with my country…he…swore to protect Ottoman interests, but ultimately deflected…now the Germans have a monopoly which is threatening the economic stability of the empire…”
John stayed in the entrance to the office: it was elegantly furnished, and the walls were lined with floor to ceiling bookshelves. At one end was the judge’s desk and on the direct opposite side of the room was a safe, at which Sherlock was already trying to decipher the code.
“Thank god, Judge Becket and his wife were on holiday when this happened.” Detective Baynes offered, which annoyed Lestrade.
The heiress gasped once more, clenching her pearls in her hand and against her chest. “Why, Mr. Holmes! You’re brilliant!”
Moriarty walked back to his desk with the journal, taking his time sitting down in his chair.
Mycroft chuckled. “Indeed, Mamhud. I hear of Sherlock Holmes
John flinched as something Sherlock said to him the night he had escaped from Westgate suddenly popped into his head.
“And Mahmud Han bin Mecid. He’s a diplomat from the Ottoman Empire. A little
Detective Baynes laughed again as he pushed himself away from the machine. He waited before walking toward John, causing John to step back again. There was still quite a significant amount of space between the two men, but the revelation that Detective Baynes had murdered his colleague made John feel claustrophobic.
“Had?” Sherlock asked.
“Our thief is obsessed with military history then?”
“Watson, we cannot rest now. We are in pursuit and very close to our target. Besides…” Sherlock limped back around to face their deduction board, “…I would not have fallen if my ever-faithful companion hadn’t taken a tumble.”
As Sherlock looked off into the distance, John rolled his eyes. He could tell that his companion was holding back a thought.
“Ah! Mr. Wiggins!” Sherlock greeted the child.
Dear reader, I regret to inform you that Dr. John Watson, the main suspect in the murder case of Dr. James Carberry, has escaped from Westgate.
Detective Baynes nearly shoved Sherlock out of the way as he and his men tried to get past with John. “There’s more to it, Mr. Holmes. So, if you don’t mind, please let us do our job.”
“I suppose you mean to tell me that we’re going on a ghost hunt—”
John sighed as he looked at Sherlock who shrugged with a slight grin before facing the police officer. John took a minute, several long minutes to be exact, truly contemplating the prospect of having a few nights to himself as Sherlock regaled prisoners at the local prison.
“Dr. Hans Schuller,” Moriarty greeted with a sly smile as he walked forward, reaching a hand out to the chemist, “it’s a pleasure to see you again.”
“Holmes, please. How many times do I have to tell you it’s not polite spying on people, especially when we’re staying in their home?”
John struggled, dropping some more luggage which caused the nosiest crash. Some of the dock workers sneered at him as they tried to get by to tend to other ships and cargo.
Sherlock looked behind himself with a smile. “Excellent, Watson. Grab an apron.”
the time for your usual paltry elusiveness. Watson’s life is on the line. Tell me what you know.”
Lestrade sighed again as he shook his head. “I’m not completely sure of who’s involved, but I think the leak at the Yard has something to do with the Carberry case.”
Sherlock nodded as he watched John cross the sitting room to retrieve his coat before exiting to travel to his patient’s home.
Mycroft looked around. “Where’s the doctor?”
too long ago. Upon closer glance to Coney’s desk, I saw two sets of cigar buds left in the ash tray on the desk. One belonging to Coney and the other to his visitor. The one from the visitor is of high quality, which leads me to believe that our mysterious visitor is someone of means.”
“Miss!” Wiggins stopped at the table, breathing heavily from running and excitement.
John waited before following, noting to himself how eerily somber Mycroft’s country estate was when he wasn’t entertaining a multitude of characters. He followed Mycroft into the dining room, seeing that the table had two place settings across from each other.
Sherlock took his time following John. “You
“We need to leave, Mycroft and test these samples.” Sherlock commanded swiftly as he found another window to pry open. This time he took his time and opened it without a hitch.
“Do you remember seeing anything or anyone suspicious while at Westgate? Or besides the nephew at the Yard?”
“I don’t know any specifics, Holmes…I just know that he was working on something and testing it on people in Whitechapel. You probably know more than me at this point.”
“Watson! We need to leave!” John then felt a hand on his shoulder. After another wave of mental and emotional sickness, John finally looked up at Sherlock who had a panicked expression on his face.
“I knew this wasn’t true!” Mary cried, “but who would do such a thing and where are you staying?”
Sherlock nodded. “Well, you should get on that, Watson. Don’t want you back home too late.”
John shrugged without replying affirmatively. Sherlock expressed shock before his face relaxed.
Mycroft pursed his lips again as he eyed his brother whose expression only remained surprisingly content. Mycroft shuffled back on forth on his feet, seemingly uncomfortable with how reasonable Sherlock was being in the moment. But then, after a few more awkward glances that failed to decipher any true meaning behind his brother’s façade, Mycroft sighed, throwing his hands up into the air as he sat down in a chair near the fireplace.
“Mr. McArthur,” Sherlock started after he effortlessly poured himself and John some tea, “you should tell us more about your business. I’ve only been able to glean what I know from the papers.”
“What?” John finally focused on Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded back as he turned to address John. “Watson, please pay Wiggins half of his finder’s fee. He’ll receive the other half once he finds what I need.” He winked at Wiggins who looked delighted.
Sherlock looked down to see John standing near a furnace. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. I wanted to ask you about your uncle—”
Sherlock stayed still as he continued to stare down at the paper in his hands. Eventually, he turned to a degree to acknowledge both Mary and Mycroft.
Later in the afternoon as light rain began to fall, they finally reached the estate, being greeted immediately outside by an overly joyous Mycroft who was accompanied by his valet, Stanley.
John looked around, thinking the employee would have led him to a passenger compartment instead. “Uh, the passenger is in here?” He pointed to the luggage car.
“I would never be associated with such an evil act.” Mahmud jumped in.
“You know who it is, don’t you?” John asked quietly, not entirely sure if he were fearing the worst.
The guide nodded enthusiastically. “Indeed, sir. Mostly academics of course.”
“I could hear Schuller talking to himself often…most of it was unintelligible…but…” John squeezed his eyes shut as he thought back to his cell at Westgate, “…I do remember the first night…Schuller talking about an academic or something rather…I couldn’t really comprehend what he was referring to, maybe Carberry?”
“Moriarty.” Another man sitting at the desk waved for Moriarty to sit down in a chair on the other side of the desk.
“Is something the matter, dear?” Sherlock asked in between bites.
Sherlock nodded still facing the desk. Mycroft groaned to himself. “Fine. Fine, Sherly. I’ll send a telegram to a colleague of mine. I’m sure I can speak with the director.”
. John told himself, or attempted to.
John hopped away from the detective as soon as he saw that Sherlock had wrestled Detective Baynes to the floor. Both men had firm holds on the other as they struggled to get back to a standing position. At one point, Sherlock had knocked Detective Bayne’s revolver out of his hands which sent the weapon sliding near John. John grabbed the revolver and attempted to aim at Detective Baynes, but he couldn’t get a clear shot without possibly injuring Sherlock.
Sherlock placed the paper on the table before pouring himself a cup of tea. “Let’s hope he doesn’t try something drastic in the interim.”
He thought to himself before placing it inside his jacket pocket. John took another moment to straighten himself and his nerves out before turning to the exit of his compartment, opening the door slightly to look both ways once more before turning his back to lock it. But before he could, a hand shoved him back inside the space.
“Tell me what he has, Lestrade, or I’ll find out myself.”
Lestrade held still has he watched Detective Baynes finish his conversation before walking toward him. Lestrade’s heart rate increased as he glanced around for an opportunity to escape from the situation without appearing fragile in front of someone like Detective Baynes.
“Sherly, we should make our leave before the police arrive.”
John grumbled, but he did as he was told, fishing around in the pocket of his pants for Wiggin’s usual compensation.
John grumbled to himself as he followed but the word “file” suddenly stopped him in his tracks. “File?
“Thank you. That will be all.” He said to the officer who had brought him the telegram.
John scrunched up his face; he was becoming furious again that Sherlock had seeming intended for Schuller to escape Westgate, but he knew that bringing up the escape would do little good given the current situation.
“…as you can see, certain physical and economic traits can aid in discerning the criminal…”
Sherlock leaned back in his chair. “Of course, however, can you tell us anything else about what happened between dinner and when we discovered the body?”
Sherlock groaned. “Mycroft, please. This
Sherlock nodded as he watched Madame Loire walk away briskly, but he paid little attention to it before turning back to Mr. McArthur who was in the process of beginning another hunting trip story.
“Thank you…so much…,” John began quietly, “for saving me…”
The secretary nodded as she rose from her desk, rounding it to get to the director’s office. She knocked once before opening the door slightly.
Sherlock stood staring down at the vat for some time before John appeared near him. “He fell?” John looked down at the vat before taking a hold of Gladstone who was becoming too excited from the commotion.
John sighed in his head; he could hear the man on the other side of the wall babbling about some academic or something rather.
Sherlock groaned loudly as he tried sitting up some more. John crouched down near him, trying to free him from the rubble.
The employee stretched out a hand toward the entrance of the car. “Could you follow me, Doctor? One of our passengers appears under the weather and we would appreciate your help.”
“…oh my god…” John repeated. He kept his head in his hands before slowly looking back up at Sherlock once more who looked equally terrified.
As Sherlock threw open the door to get out onto the street, John tried to look back behind himself to see what had frightened his companion but before he could there was a loud boom. The boom shook the entire house launching both Sherlock and John out on the street. Both men rolled to the other side of the street as pieces of debris flew about them.
John thought to himself.
Mamhud nodded slowly, looking downward and away. “I was in my room, but I had nothing to do with the murder.”
“He’s made a few donations also and one last month.”
Sherlock waited until the rustling in the room died down again. He inched along the wall toward the street, looking both ways before it was clear, but before he could step out onto the street, a hand grabbed him from behind.
“All right, Sherlock,” Mycroft looked back slightly at the hansom to see his brother lingering inside, “let’s see what we can do about Dr. Watson.”
John looked over at Sherlock who now had a slight grin on his face. “Why, thank you for that bit of information. Could you please send in Mr. Davenport?”
John mouthed the work “link” before following Sherlock who had hustled to the kitchen. “Holmes, what do you mean?”
have to do with Lord Nelson?”
Sherlock laughed as he flagged down a hansom. “It seems as if our dear Mary is more cunning than she appears.”
“I never touched you!” Mamhud shouted back.
Clara looked sternly at Sherlock. “After dinner, in this room, Mr. Standish whispered that he knew who I was and that I wouldn’t get away this time. I had expected this, but the threat was too great not to dismiss. After everyone retired, he followed me back into the dining room. He said he knew who I was ‘despite my fancy hair and new clothes…’I told him that he couldn’t hurt me anymore and that I was going to expose his secret…”
“Not now—oh my god!” Shouted the man, “there it is!”
leave without my traveling archive.”
What this evidence is, is a mystery. But surely someone like Dr. Watson who has experience with crime would be able to cover up his tracks. Maybe he wanted to get caught…I’m sure we’ll find out soon if this ends up going to trial…
“Inspector Lestrade.” Everyone was interrupted suddenly by a relaxed, disinterested voice, “could you please have your men unhand my brother. All of this is quite unnecessary.”
Lestrade straightened up as he shoved the burned telegram into his pocket. He rushed out of the room, slowly down to close the door quietly before walking back to his office.
Mycroft let out a painful groan as Sherlock continued. “…someone must have entered the chapel with the animal that attacked the priest…”
“There’s a leak at the Yard…” Lestrade let out.
Sherlock chuckled, clearly amused, as he waved a hand around. “Of course not, dear. But he’s certainly been here before if he’s obsessed with the Battle of Trafalgar…Miss?” Sherlock kept his eyes on the log, continuing to run a finger down the pages as he addressed the guide, “could we also see your donation list?”
“I understand…I didn’t realize I’ve become such a bear…” he turned around to face the group, “Madame Loire, I promise we won’t demolish this cemetery…your service to our family is unmatched…” he then turned to look directly at James, “and son…if you want to go back to Paris to the…” he took a moment, “
“How can I help?” John whispered softly as he watched Sherlock turn away from him to walk back to the stove, “I think I may remember what Carberry had told me in private about whatever he was trying to do with the antidote. It might be useful.”
John took a moment before looking over at Sherlock who looked determined. He then looked at Mycroft who smiled widely.
John studied the vial before slowly looking up at Sherlock. “What happened?”
Sherlock turned toward John. “Speaking of which, where is my dear brother?”
But Mycroft heard no verbal response; he just watched the front door to the building close. He swore to himself as he ran back into the sitting room to grab his coat and hat before running after Sherlock who was outside ascending a hansom.
Sherlock turned sharply with a wince to face John. “And leave you in a crumpled pile on the scaffolding of Saint Paul’s? I must be a terrible companion then.”
, Lestrade.” Sherlock shot back, “Watson has never taken his revolver with him when he’s visiting patients. You can look through our house if you want, but not only will you find it, you’ll see that it hasn’t been used in quite some time.”
“Nonsense!” Mr. McArthur interrupted his son with a cheery tone, “why wouldn’t they want to see it?” he then turned to face Sherlock and John who were quietly taking in the family dynamics.
“I would hope you would agree with that sentiment, Inspector.” He coldly concluded.
“So, our ghost wears a size 10 shoe. Fabulous.” John rolled his eyes.
John glanced at Sherlock before looking ahead. “Okay, a chalet of some sort then?”
The heiress gulped as she rung her hands together. “Well, last time I checked, which was early this morning before I left for my appointment.”
Warden James quickly cut himself off as he panicked, looking in the direction of the director who made a motion with his hands not to be so casual about John being locked up for murder in the basement.
Wiggins jumped up from the sofa to follow Sherlock out into the hallway, down the stairs, and out onto the street to hail a hansom to Whitechapel. Not long after, they stopped in front of what looked to be an abandoned cemetery.
John rested his hands on his hips. “What does the
“I’ll speak to each of you individually.”
“Excuse us.” Sherlock offered politely before calming walking to the compartment door. John swung himself inside, nodding nervously to the father of the family who was shouting at them along with the mother who was holding a baby that was wailing loudly.
“Do you think…” John started, choosing his words carefully, “do you think…someone…or someones…wanted…to get you involved, Holmes?”
“Yes, of course, dear.” John smiled as he kissed the top of Sherlock’s head once more.
Sherlock laughed as he joined his brother sitting near the fireplace. “No, I’ve realized that I need to let the matters take their course. In due time the doctor’s innocence will come to light.”
“I suppose your right, Mr. Holmes.” She smiled slightly at Sherlock.
Sherlock huffed as he marched toward Lestrade. “Lestrade, surely even you can’t believe that. You have an argument that was overheard and that’s all?”
John recovered before toppling over, turning around to face Mycroft who was grinning unnervingly at him.
“Westgate doesn’t usually allow visitors without a special pass, but I can write one up for you, Holmes.” Lestrade looked directly at Sherlock who was still looking downward at the pendant.
“But would you say, perhaps, a great deal?” Sherlock shrugged again, motioning toward Lestrade to be more honest, which greatly annoyed the other.
The front door opened slowly as Wheeler’s butler answered. “Yes, may I help you?”
“It were a game.” Sherlock concluded as he laid out some clothes on their bed.
Sherlock turned toward Madame Loire. “Care to explain, Madame Loire?”
. John thought to himself.
“You needn’t to worry about Dr. Carberry, Dr. Schuller. He’s dead.” Moriarty coolly offered as a matter of fact.
Mr. McArthur looked down at his brooch before grinning up at Sherlock. “Mr. Holmes,
Mycroft took another bite of his food before settling back in his chair. “I’m sure I’ll never really understand why but I’ve never seen Sherlock so loyal to someone before. You can tell he cares deeply for you…,” Mycroft shrugged, “but then again, I think he shows it in the oddest of manners.”
John stared blankly at Sherlock before taking the telegram. “What’s this?”
Moriarty nodded as he listened. “Okay, what do you suggest we do as an alternative?”
John considered the statement. “I believe her.”
John heard some more shouting before a door slammed closed. He sighed to himself, not really sure how to comprehend what was currently happening to him, stunned that not only had someone murdered his colleague, but he had also been arrested for the deed.
John turned swiftly to aim his revolver at one of Sherlock’s assailants, shooting the man in the leg. Sherlock jumped up and pinned the other employee to the ground as John went back to guarding the third in the corner.
Moriarty grinned unnervingly at Sherlock before taking a moment to wrap up the end of his lecture. As another speaker took the dais after him, Moriarty sat down in the front row with the other lecturers billed for that day, remaining as stoic as ever, appearing to be enjoying the end-of-the-day talks.
Sherlock kept his eyes on the road. “An estate.”
Sherlock furrowed his brow as he stood up before walking back to the fireplace to retrieve Carberry’s journal. He flipped through a few pages until he stopped on the section with the missing page. He then looked back at John who unintentionally explicitly expressed his weariness.
“Holmes, I think you’ve done some good here today. Nice work.” John patted Sherlock on the shoulder.
Mr. McArthur? He looks like the gardener.”
Sherlock held up a hand. “No one was hurt, I promise you.”
Mycroft grimaced as he watched Sherlock with his back facing toward him. He sighed once more as he rolled his eyes.
The two men began shoving the other which in turn prompted more hysterics from Bridget. Both Fedorov and Sherlock ran over to the two men, trying to pull them away from the other.
Moriarty nodded as he accepted Sherlock’s hand, taking a moment before nodding slowly with a broad, widening smile.
Yet, John only sighed, not too shocked really by his companion’s overt behavior that only just fell in line with his eccentric personality.
“I’m going to lie down…” John turned back to look at Sherlock who was studying him intently.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “You know I can’t do that, Sherlock. If I reveal his identity it may end up jeopardizing whatever lead there is with the drug.”
John stared at Mycroft, but he wasn’t sure how to respond. “Pardon?”
“Professor,” the man started up, “we can’t deal with Schuller. He’s too unstable. That’s why production was slow at the factory in the first place.”
Sherlock laughed again as the hansom shook their bodies around a bit from the pebbled paths. “The orchids in the heiress’s garden are Early Purple Orchids which are native to many regions around the world, but
“Witnesses saw two men leaving the scene.” Lestrade looked past his superior to stare back at the house. His superior continued on.
Madame Loire made a noise before opening her eyes slowly. She looked around the room before looking directly at John who was now holding her hand.
“He won’t tell me more about what’s going on,” John let out quietly, “I know he knows who’s behind all of this.”
“Quick.” Sherlock ran into a smaller room attached to the chapel with Mycroft closely behind. They both shushed each other as the voices drew nearer. The door to the chapel opened slowly as it was accompanied with footsteps.
John looked over at Sherlock; his expression softened as it became clear that his companion was once again sincere about the situation they had found themselves in.
long? Hm. Time flies, doesn’t it?” He asked mostly to himself, seemingly disregarding the serious nature of the last few hours.
He looked out through the window once more before running to the other side of the room to scribble a note to Mrs. Hudson that he had gone out to a long lunch with Mycroft and that she shouldn’t expect them until later that evening for dinner.
“I’ve been meaning to confess that I am quite the fan of your detective work. A colleague of mine has been following your exploits to do research on a detective character for an upcoming play.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Oh, I’m very sure it’s related. Answer the question, please.”
“Your excellency.” Sherlock returned with a genuine smile, “pray tell us where you were before we found Standish.”
Sherlock ran toward the door to stop Mycroft from leaving. “Mycroft, please listen.” He pleaded before marching to his desk.
Sherlock waited for about an hour or so before one of the compartment doors opened, revealing an elegantly dressed woman. She straightened her hat out before closing the door to compartment but the latch on the door failed to close the door tightly. Sherlock waited for the woman to walk down the corridor to the next car before quietly opening the door to the woman’s compartment.
Mary shook her head. “Is he helpful for the case?”
“An estate in the countryside? Holmes!”
“A two-hour lunch?” John snorted before rolling his eyes.
“Good boy, Gladstone.” Sherlock encouraged as he held the hat out again for Gladstone.
“Well perhaps they need you on the case.” John responded as he watched Sherlock return to his notes.
“Lord Nelson.” Sherlock clarified.
John’s face turned beet red, too frustrated to think clearly. “Holmes, this is
“Holmes!” John nearly shouted, but Sherlock had broken away from him to hurry off the walkways.
“Well, it does appear that everything is in order…I uh,” the director looked at his secretary before facing Sherlock and Mycroft again, “I suppose you’re here to see the doctor. Speak with Warden James, who is in charge of the maximum-security sector, that’s where…” he stopped for a moment as he projected a nervous countenance, “where we, uh, keep prisoners who have been charged with more serious crimes like—”
Detective Baynes lowered his weapon as he rested a hand on his hips, appearing to think deeply. He sighed before pointing his revolver at John again as he took several steps toward him. He looked to be on the verge of elaborating but stayed silent instead as a conniving grin crossed his face.
Moriarty intently paid attention to Sherlock, but the growing commotion in the audience began to fracture his perfected composure.
“I am very dizzy, Doctor…” Mycroft let out, as John helped him to his feet.
Mary began to sob as Sherlock stood rigid in her embrace. He looked at Mycroft who looked bemused by the situation before he finally patted Mary on the back.
Something about a potential challenge was thrilling to him, especially…
“Have you always been this inquisitive? Trust my methods, dear. We shall catch our thief in the act!”
Lestrade was standing in the middle of the street watching police officers filter in and out of what was left of Judge Richard Becket’s home. The police had arrived on the scene not long after learning about the bombing. Lestrade didn’t have to learn about the details to know that the bombing had something to do with the Carberry case.
“That sounds like a wonderful idea.” Sherlock interrupted his brother as he turned to face him with a broad smile, “leaving this dreadful city so we can focus on Watson’s case is probably the best thing for the both of us.”
“Yes,” Lestrade began, “of course.
“Well,” Mycroft motioned toward the door, “after you, Miriam.”
Sherlock nodded, and John let out a terribly depleted-sounding exhale as he picked up their suitcases, but he was stopped by Mycroft’s outstretched arm.
Sherlock struggled against Lestrade before breaking free. “Guards!” Lestrade shouted, waving for some officers to catch Sherlock before he could get further down the hallway toward the evidence room.
“Okay, let’s see what Coney’s been up to.”
He turned slightly toward one of the windows overlooking the campus, grinning to himself as he drank his tea, watching miniature figures bustle about the green. As soon as he finished his tea, Moriarty placed the empty cup back on the cart before writing a note to his research assistant that the water for the tea could be a little less hot as it will burn it.
Sherlock’s expression morphed into that satisfied grin that usually irritated John. “Did I? Watson, why would the police house a suspect in a high-profile murder case in a prison that was due to be demolished? A prison whose security system is faulty at best. Please keep up, dear.”
Sherlock read the telegram before closing his book abruptly. “I knew Lestrade was more helpful than he’s typically able.”
Sherlock grabbed his brother’s arm. “Mycroft, I’ll need this room cleared to investigate the body. Please have everyone else wait to be interrogated later.”
“Where are you going?” John half-whispered, managing to catch up to his companion, grabbing Sherlock by the arm before he could get further down the hallway.
Mycroft slowly shook his head before instantly remembering who Mary was. “Ah! Yes. I met you at that lunch once ago.” He beckoned Mary inside.
But before he could finish his reply, the crash was followed by a loud thump. Both Sherlock and John looked at the other once more before jumping off the bed; Sherlock ran quickly out of the room.
“Then you
“Mycroft.” John muttered as he straightened out his jacket once more before reaching for Sherlock’s traveling archive.
The man took a deep breath before entering the room with Moriarty closely behind. As they walked in, they found Dr. Schuller in the corner of the room, sitting with his back facing them. Moriarty’s henchman inched back toward the door in fear, causing Moriarty to roll his eyes.
Sherlock turned to face Lestrade directly. “Why, Lestrade, I have no idea what you mean. I’m not on the case, remember?”
The three men jumped out of their chairs, running to the room as quickly as possible. Upon entering, they found both William and Mamhud shouting at the other. Bridget was in the corner, screeching from the commotion; her maid, Clara, was trying to console her. Mycroft was trying to wedge himself in between the two men whose argument had taken almost a physical turn.
“Give up, Saxon! There’s no use in struggling!”
“Dr. Moriarty.” Suddenly, Schuller turned around in his chair to face Moriarty and the exiting henchman.
“I really don’t need to explain myself to you, Dr. Watson.” Detective Baynes ultimately answered as he pulled back on the hammer of his weapon, but before John could react, Detective Baynes’s body lurched forward from a force from behind.
“Mr. Holmes!” One of the guards approached Sherlock as he reached a hand out, “it’s such a pleasure to meet you in person.”
Sherlock huffed as he unbuttoned his shirt before joining John in the bed. As soon as he was near the edge, John reached out for him, hugging him close to his body as soon as he was on the bed.
John groaned as he lifted the portmanteau into the automobile. “No, I shall never forget that you’re both stubborn
The woman turned to the man; her face was ashen from what they had finally caught with their own eyes.
Lestrade then walked around his desk, toward the office door, to peek out into the hallway before closing the door.
“You can stop here, thank you.” Sherlock called to their driver as they approached the side of the church.
“I haven’t seen him since yesterday morning when the police came, but we’re going there today.” Sherlock answered quietly as he picked up the section of the paper folded to display Coney’s article.
Sherlock’s expression remained the same as he only glared back at Lestrade. “Lestrade,” he turned around to walk away from the inspector and the door, “how many of your cases have you sought my advice?”
In the private confines of his own bedroom, John Watson was also reflecting on his relationship with the man downstairs. He’d always known that he was Sherlock’s only friend. It was understandable that he would protect him, as John had once offered to do, in a dark swimming pool, in the dead of night, a bomb set to explode attached to his chest. He hadn’t even had time to think when he ran to Moriarty and held him there, telling Sherlock, to run, to save himself. But then, the snipers had turned on Sherlock.
He stormed down the stairs and opened the car door with such force that he was surprised that he did not rip the door off. He sat down next to his bags of shopping and slammed this door too. Anthea actually looked up from her phone to stare at John for a few seconds. John glared back at her and then barked at the driver to take him back to Baker Street that instant.
He turned to face her, smile still plastered on his face. “Remind me, why did you marry me?” She chuckled.
Greg only made it a few steps into the room before stopping short at the sight that lay before him. He could have cried, not only at the sight of John lying there, alive and breathing, but at the image of Sherlock, slumped next to him, hands clasped firmly around John’s, sleeping more peacefully for probably the first time since this whole ordeal began, comforted by the continual warmth that was John Watson, reassuring him, even in sleep, that he was really here.
"No, no problem. He’s probably right, I can’t run away from my problems. It's just ... sometimes it’s not that easy. "
"Not only in front of my feet ..."
"Sir, would you like to try a spoonful of honey?"
After a moment Sherlock spoke again. “Don’t be afraid to mention Christmas. It’s just another day to me.”
As if he had heard my silent plea, Mocroft  nodded to me one last time and left with a dramatic swing of his umbrella.
even. And John was dining with a woman and had a ring box in his pocket.
"John, why now?"
Sherlock grinned at John’s ire. “I called him. We’ll need witnesses.”
John winced inside. He
John puffed up his cheeks and blew out a breath. He felt flushed from reading Sherlock’s words and realized he was half-hard in his jeans. The thought of Sherlock, thinking of him jerking off to stay warm gave him a funny feeling.
Mycroft replied even more coolly, “It has been quite some time, John. And I understand that you and Sherlock are no longer together.”
Miami is not a walkable town. Sherlock knew he needed to head downtown to score some junk, but he was stranded in Coral Gables with no money and no mobile phone. He didn’t even have the $1.25 for bus fare. He lifted his face and sniffed - his nose told him which way was east by the hint of ocean underneath the exhaust fumes and general city grit in the air. He shouldered his bag and started walking. The sun beat hot on the back of his neck; the underarms of his white T-shirt were soon ringed with perspiration.
I whispered into the wind and looked wistfully at the little insect.
The other monks murmured in agreement while still busy caring for him; one of them put a blanket over Jonah's shoulders, another pulled his dirt-caked shoes off his feet and put a comfortable stool under his legs. The novice himself was clearly uncomfortable with all the attention and he endured rather than enjoyed it; all the more one could see his relief when the bell called the brothers to evening prayers. My attempt to prevent Jonah from hauling himself into the church despite his injury, rather than having me treat his wound, was nipped in the bud by him.
Two days later I moved in with him.
"No, not at the beginning. We argued because he didn’t accept my decision. I made my testimony in the hospital and informed him immediately about my decision to dedicate my life to God. And he went away without saying a word. During the entire detox, and after that, I did not hear from him, no one knew where he had gone, he seemed to be swallowed up by the earth. I was endlessly sad because I couldn’t say goodbye but then I began to realize it was an opportunity. The abrupt separation made it easier for me to distance myself from all this. I missed him - but as a friend, not as ... well, you know ... "
She raised her water glass. “A toast. To happy marriage and happy Christmas.”
"Whether or not I leave this convent, if only for a few hours, is not up for discussion. I'm sorry, John. I appreciate what you did for me, but this point is not negotiable. "
what I was about to do?
so badly. But he wouldn’t allow himself to do it. Not again.
"I guess it does not matter if he goes back to his normal everyday life tomorrow, I just don’t know exactly what is the best course of action for now - he obviously needs to rest but I agree with you that he should not be alone. Is there anyone who could take care of him a bit when he returns to his room? "
"Why do you come to me now? After you haven’t come for months? What happened?"
Almost tenderly he stroked Sherlock through the tangled curls and I was tempted to dismiss my suspicion as unfounded - had he not pulled a latex glove off his hands after applying the anointing oil and hastily disposed of it in the wastepaper basket. I had been half hidden behind the door but now I rushed forward, grabbed the man by the collar of his habit and hurled him against the wall with all my might. He shrieked in anguish when his back hit the hard surface with a loud crack. I stared with rage into the blue eyes of Brother Francis, who, though dazed by the impact, twisted his lips into a wry grin.
"Oh yes?"
I decided to head off to Isaac’s destination since it Kate obviously intended to ask John and Mary to help find her son. John would take Mary’s car, so I had no time to lose. Running in earnest now, I cut through gardens and sped down alleys. My path would be half the distance John would travel by car, but time was still of the essence.
"I want to go see Sherlock Holmes," I pleaded, reaching for the pen to sign the Visitor Log. The duty nurse put a hand on my forearm to keep me from doing so.
John shifted his feet and spread his legs a little wider and Sherlock suddenly gasped, “Oh god. Right there.”
And Sherlock loves it, simply loves it, when John tries out his idea that night, in their big bed, in the dark.
“Well, Mycroft, I’ve learned a lot these past two days. First off I’ve learned I had a concussion I didn’t even recognize, and post-concussion syndrome I attributed to grief over Sherlock’s death. I need to ask your forgiveness for the way I acted during that time. Please understand, I truly didn’t remember most of what Sherlock told me from the roof of Barts.”
A sofa faced the TV, its back to the doorway of the room. A small figure rose from it and turned toward them. “Oh, Saul! Come in, come in.” A petite middle-aged woman rounded the sofa and approached them. She took Saul by the elbow and drew him to one of the chairs bracketing the sofa. “I was just watching my soaps. And who is this?” She turned to Sherlock with eyes that were red-rimmed yet still bright and alert.
"It's bad," I confirmed, "But it’s much worse when it eventually makes anything seem ok. When you blunt emotion and you don’t appreciate the value of a human life anymore. "
As much as I tried, I could not combine these two pictures in my mind. It was not the famous two sides of a coin that the curly head revealed to me.  I had the feeling of having met two completely different people: a serious, profound man whose spirituality was more important to him than all other things and who apparently had gained great respect within the convent within a very short time - and someone who was quite a scoundrel, with his inner child on display, and testing his limits by pushing his fellow men to their own. Or past, as in my case. I had fallen hopelessly for him - and at the same time I was absolutely certain that he could not have missed that.
"It all sounds as if it were only a charade to him - as if he were a little boy playing the pirate."
Sherlock glanced up, lips still locked with John’s, to see the American man rigid with indignation. Only then did he lift his face away from John’s.
"This may have other reasons," he replied softly, looking into my eyes.
"Of course I do, I owe him my life! If he had not found me back then, I would be dead. If not on the drugs, then by disease. "
Reaching for his mug, John answered quietly. “Sure, Mary.” He took a too-hot sip just to fill time while he silently calculated a way to disarm his former girlfriend. Who had now appointed herself his fiancee.
"Are you still waiting for the decision of the Convent?"
He avoided answering his phone, especially when his best friend called. Surely Sherlock Holmes, the most observant man in England, would deduce what was wrong. It was easier to just drift along than to try to reason out what to do about the problem.
"Because I am like your father. And I have listened to you, how much you detest him. "
"How long already?"
I took a seat in one of the front pews to have a good view of the events in the sanctuary - after all, a Profession was not something I experienced every day, even though Jonah had already informed me that it was a small celebration, because it was "only" temporary, not eternal profession. It didn’t matter to me - for Jonah this event was a big step and I was honored to be there, even though we had only known each other for a short time.
“You tit.” John affectionately tugged at the dried paint in Sherlock’s hair. “You’re just afraid someone will find out you’re human after all.”
The blond snorted.
"But then Sherlock showed up here. As 'Brother William'. "
About a minute later, the priest answered the other end of the line.
the pistol would make with the silencer in place.
John plated their meals and watched while Sherlock swished his wine then sipped. His eyelashes fanned on his pale cheeks as he closed his eyes to savor the first taste. A smile stretched Sherlock’s lips. “This is excellent,” he murmured, opening his eyes. “What’s the occasion? Did I forget our anniversary again?”
Harry was already seated in a booth. She waved at them from across the restaurant and John could see, even from the distance, that her hand was steady and eyes were clear. He breathed a silent sigh of relief.
"Well, then ... I'm going to look for him now," I announced, turning to go.
"This is your last week here with us, right?"
Sherlock licked his lips and stared at the floor in front of him. “I can’t. They hate me there. My parents will send me back to school to finish my A levels and I can’t. I can’t go back there.” Tears sprang into his eyes. “They do terrible things, things I don’t want to … please. I don’t want to go back. Give me a job, I can wash your equipment or clean your buildings. Anything.”
The date was months before he’d met Mary. What had he been doing? Most of that first year was a fog. A fog of sleeping long hours, dragging to work and slogging through the day like swimming through wet concrete then going home and drinking his dinner to fall into bed and start the cycle all over again. It was less than a half-life - it had been a mostly-dead-life.
"Yes, who would have thought that I would become a monk. Maybe having a near-death experience isn’t all bad ... "
"Do not blame me, John, you may be a good doctor, but you can’t help me with that."
A hollow terror took over Mrs. Hudson’s kind eyes as her hands flew to her heart, clasping tightly in front of her chest. “Oh! Young man, you don’t
Sherlock turned his head and searched John’s eyes before answering. “No, but if you’d rather wait, we can.”
With a final shake of Sherlock’s neck, John stepped back. His demeanor instantly changed into one of concern. “Here, c’mere,” he murmured as he drew Sherlock into his arms. Sherlock propped his chin on John’s shoulder and shut his eyes tightly, enjoying the closeness of John’s embrace in spite of the pain throbbing through his arm and everything that had transpired.
This part of the story was a good memory; Sherlock could feel how the tension in John’s chest eased as he remembered the sledding party.
"Doctor Watson - and I urge you to believe my words. Mr Holmes is in the greatest danger! This priest ... "
"And their honey," Jonah added, laughing.
"He just does not seem to be the type for something like that. Such a big effort, only ... "
"Oi! Can anyone help you, young man? "
"Later," he waved and walked past me, whispering to me that he was coming to me on his own. "Until then, watch and pray with me, John."
"May I ask what you mean by that?"
"Goodness, John, you frightened me ..."
"You have to go to hospital. Immediately."
. These words, too, went through my head again and again, but the question now arose as to what kind of interest it was. I could not imagine that he - a man who voluntarily committed himself to a life of silence and chastity - had made tender advances toward me. And then, of course, there was that still, breathed
"Rather?"
Actually, I did not want to meet him today, I was much too upset to be able to cope with this situation.
“You’re going out?”
“Okay! You know you really don’t have to.”
"He said he would free me from my sinfulness by fulfilling the will of the Lord in me."
"I didn’t recognise that my behaviour bemused you so much," he replied softly and suddenly, distantly, rose and reached for the herbal bundle to make it disappear again in the folds of his habit, "I will try to prevent you from worrying about these things from now on. Good night."
"Third?" I asked, somewhat confused.
"One moment please."
"Anyway, that's what made him leave me alone. He left without saying goodbye to me and I hadn’t heard from him in months. Just before I left, I contacted Mycroft because I wanted to say goodbye to Sherlock and apologize to him, but he just told me that his brother was unavailable and I should not continue to contact him. And that's what I stuck to. "
"Where are we going?" he asked, giving his head a little shake as if that would help him understand what was happening.
“No one works that much,” Jim said, sitting down next to Sherlock. “You writing a love letter to your mother?”
John stripped everything off and climbed into bed. His body still felt warm, and he still tasted Sherlock. He drifted off replaying the end of the night.
Sherlock gave her a little sarcastic smile. “Slept quite well actually,” he said. “Where’s Dad?”
"Yeah, are you okay?" he asked.
Ellen gave Jim a little push but laughed with him.
He turned his attention back to the television. Hopefully, the awkwardness was over now, for a while at least. It was kind of nice having John to talk to and he had enjoyed what happened upstairs.
"I'll tell you what," Sherlock said, opening the door for John. "I'll keep the coat -- you can have the hat."
John's breath shuddered a bit as he tried to compose himself -- feeling Sherlock's hand exploring his body like that was driving him crazy already.
“Answer it,” John said simply.
John nodded. "I'm just going to clean up a bit. I'll be down."
Sherlock started a painfully slow rhythm, moving his mouth up and down John's cock. His hand explored between John's legs.
"Condoms are not interesting, John," Sherlock said. "Leave them in there, hang up the coat and walk away from this conversation."
Sherlock sat up straight, not quite sure where he was. Then he realised what had happened: he’d fallen asleep on John’s bed. He stared up at the ceiling, the ceiling John looked at every night. Theoretically it seemed an odd thing to do -- take a nap in John’s bed. However, it actually didn’t feel strange at all. It felt quite nice. Sherlock was pretty sure it was likely he’d do it again.
“You’re braver than he is. Molly is the princess, though I think Mrs Hudson would have a few thoughts about why she was not portrayed similarly in this story,” Sherlock said. “I suppose that leaves you as the wizard because you help me with the mysterious things all the time.”
By early evening, Sherlock had not found his answers. Reluctantly he headed home. Perhaps he could talk the whole thing through with John as that often helped him see things he couldn’t see on his own, though he wasn’t quite sure he wanted John to know that.
Sherlock handed him a towel, leaning over to try to look at John’s nude body. “I wasn’t lying,” he repeated. He started to unbutton his shirt. “Were you?”
When John didn't hear anything back right away, he closed the computer and went to make himself something to eat. He wasn't sure if he was going to type this client’s case up at all. It wasn't his best work. For a second he smiled, remembering Sherlock being upset when John posted his unsolved ones as well. The smile faded just as quickly as he looked around the flat and felt an ache in his chest. The client’s hope brought back a feeling of emptiness.
"You were brilliant," John said as he hung his coat. He looked over at Sherlock as he came into the flat, smirking at John's comment.
“Do you, really?” Sherlock said. “Because now I feel like maybe I even already love you -- not just because of this but maybe I always have, but I don’t know if I can do it right or if I’d be what you want.”
John worked into his lunch and took his break a bit later than usual. When he realized what area he was in he made an impulse decision and drove to Baker Street, knocking loudly.
John answered the door and called for him mum. He watched Sherlock the whole time, sharing in the embarrassment.
“You don’t have to be friends with anyone on the science team,” she said. “I didn’t mean to give that impression. But please think about it because you’re very smart -- it would be great for the team, but it would also look good when you apply for uni.”
“I didn’t expect that,” Sherlock said.
John listened to Harry moving around in his room. "Don't snoop through anything!" he shouted. The movement stopped. He wanted to be positive about her news, he truly did. But he had heard the same words out of her mouth many times before.
“Obviously not,” Sherlock said. “I never think about this kind of thing.”
“Get up,” Mycroft said.
Sherlock sat quietly and thought about the fact that he’d barely been up an hour yet everything was different now. “How long until we eat? I’ve not had a cup of tea yet, which doesn’t seem right, but tea and spaghetti together doesn’t sound good at all.”
Sherlock smiled. He should’ve made things a bit more challenging.
"I came to Molly's wedding because she's my friend and invited me," John said. "But I like to think that I am nice. It’s not an act."
John kept looking at the ceiling. "But it wasn't the kissing part? Just the person?"
“He was bringing me a book!” Sherlock pouted.
"What happened?" John asked.
Sherlock looked over. “Are you saying I’m afraid of something?”
John nodded again as he sat down in his chair with a heavy sigh. "You were right -- this was a bad idea."
“That’s original,” Sherlock said under his breath.
Sherlock’s arms went around John’s back. “Forgive me,” he whispered into John’s ear.
“No,” Sherlock said, propping John’s knees up and spreading his legs. He moved between them and let his hands explore. “I’ll be doing all the touching.”
Sherlock pulled up some music on his computer and returned to the sofa next to John. “I used to listen to this when I was a teenager,” he said. “I know classical music is an odd choice for a kid, but I found it comforting. Like it understood everything.”
“Maybe we could watch a film or something tonight?”
“Good,” Sherlock said, focusing again. “I presume I’m the boy. Are you the wizard, the knight or the princess?”
“Were the friends you went with . . . special friends?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m glad I was right,” Sherlock said. “That means I can assume that everything else I’ve deduced about you is true as well,” he added with another cheeky smile. He was surprised how comfortable he felt. Had he finished his drink too quickly?
"I meant, wearing nothing," John explained. "If you’re nude, you don't have to worry about anything being too tight."
“I think so," he said. "I think it's really good."
John hummed in surprise, shifting an arm free to tangle his hand in Sherlock's curls as he kissed back with equal intensity. Sherlock kept the kiss going, sliding his hands to John’s lower back and pulling his hips against his. He moved forward, backing John nearer to the bed, before slowly lowering them both down against the mattress. He crawled over John and continued kissing his mouth as his hand moved down to his hip, gripping it, rocking his body against the bed. John groaned in approval, his hands tugging Sherlock's shirt out of his trousers to get it off.
He lazed around for a bit and then forced himself to start tidying. The flat wasn't even messy, but he felt he wanted to make an effort for John. He wanted to do something different because things were different, even now that it would just be the two of them alone. He stripped John's bed and replaced the sheets and then did the same to his own. He put away the clean dishes and a few of the small messes he'd made across the flat. Once he'd finished, he fancied a bath so took one and then took a cup of tea and a book to his room to wait for John's return.
"Are you going to be touching me at some point or will I be doing all the work here?" Sherlock said, laughing a little before dropping down to smother John's mouth with kisses.
Sherlock thought for a moment. This visit home had felt different to previous ones, and he was pretty sure it was because John was in his life now. He thought he’d feel better if John were here with him. That seemed silly -- since John had never been here with him, so clearly it was not about the place but about John. Why? John was right actually: it was hard to explain.
Sherlock thought for a moment. He knew what John was asking, but he didn't really know how best to answer it accurately. This was supposed to be a truth, and even though it was just a stupid game, he felt he should try to be as honest as he could. "If you truly mean relationship, I suppose I've not had one," he said. "If you just mean sex, then I suppose it was two days." The answer really didn't reflect the subtleties, but it was the truth.
He stepped into the bar which was already louder and more busy than he wanted it to be. He looked around and found John almost immediately. He moved through the crowd and stood behind John. That was the moment he realised he really wasn’t sure what he was going to say, how he was going to explain how or why he’d gone to so much trouble to find him.
When Sherlock opened his eyes again, everything was dark and the flat was silent. He looked at the clock and it was after midnight. What was the point of getting up now? There was nothing to do and in truth he just didn’t want to deal with John and the stupid arguments they’d had all day. He couldn’t even remember how the whole thing had started. And while he was pretty sure he’d been right about whatever the problem was, he also knew that the shouting he’d done probably hadn’t been necessary.
John nodded. "It looks really nice. I'm sure the food will be amazing."
John scooted out from under the sink, wiping his hands on the rag beside him. "It's all set. Everything should be running smoothly now."
Sherlock opened the door a little, peeking his head in. They were both in bed, which was a good sign. “John and I wanted to go out to the shed after this film,” he said. “Is that okay? We didn’t want you to get worried if you heard the door.”
"No," Sherlock said. "I wanted to talk . . . I'm not busy, I mean."
"Just one, right?" he asked. If Sherlock had been behind every case he'd worked, John didn't know what he would do.
"You are," Sherlock said quickly. He took a sip of tea. "I just . . . well, you are, John. You've really changed my life -- me. I am a better person with you. It sounds . . . I don't know what it sounds like, but it's true."
“I meant it in an inspired way, but now you’ve got me curious,” Sherlock said, turning a bit. “Do you mean super powers like them?”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said. “But let’s just have it be us for the night.”
“Well, I was embarrassed when you told me,” Sherlock said. “No, wait, I don’t mean embarrassed – I mean, bored.” He was enjoying teasing John. And if he was honest, he kind of liked the idea of being in John’s head at night. “Look, clearly this is an issue for you. You always make a fuss about people thinking we’re a couple . . . that’s probably why you dreamt about us shagging – did we actually shag? You don’t have to tell me, I’ll be able to read your face. My point is maybe you’re being influenced by others’ opinions.” He looked over at John directly, just to wind him up.
“Shut up,” John laughed, relaxing a little. “Do you need help cleaning up?”
“Your hand smells funny,” Sherlock said quietly. He swallowed awkwardly. “I didn’t really do anything . . . with Ellen. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do . . “
John nodded and lay down close to Sherlock, facing him.
“Sorry,” Sherlock said. “Lie still.” He moved his hand down and held John’s hand that was holding the remote.
“Kiss my mouth -- I’m going to come,” Sherlock said, lifting his other hand to John’s head.
"Hmm, fine. How was yours?" John asked.
"It depends," he said. "My routine might change a little but now that I'm not alone. "
"I don't feel like it's different. We're still working together," he said.
“You left me with nothing to eat and no work to do . . . just to go out partying with your friends,” he added, committing to the pout despite knowing it was ridiculous.
John lifted his hand in response as he went into the bathroom. A few minutes later he came out and went upstairs to get dress. "Where are we going?" he called down.
"Is she asleep?" Sherlock asked.
She moved into the kitchen and filled the kettle. “Have you been working there on the computer?” she asked then stopped and turned. “You’re not looking for a new flat, are you?”
“Sounds good,” John said.
“Then I may have some surprising news for you,” Mycroft said. “John’s moved on -- he won’t be at Baker Street waiting to tend your wounds. He has no reason to believe you are alive. Surely you remember his watching you fake your death?”
It was too long, the end hanging almost to his ankles. He buttoned it up and popped the collar, grinning stupidly before hurrying out. He didn't pass many people, but he still felt like he was on display, being watched. But he felt a bit cool, as long as he focused on the collar part, and not the too long end.
By afternoon, he’d spent a few hours going to different shops to retrieve the ingredients he needed without rousing anyone’s suspicion. And to be doubly careful, he’d sent Lestrade a message to let him know he was going to attempt to recreate the drug. Lestrade allowed it only if Molly were present and willing to lock up whatever Sherlock created. It all seemed a bit dramatic, but Sherlock was so close now, he would not let dramatics interrupt his focus.
"You're blocking the door," John said, looking around the room.
“All right that’s it,” he said. He pulled his phone from his pocket and held it up to his ear. “Mrs Hudson, this is Sherlock. Unfortunately, there is an issue upstairs. Apparently John can no longer behave like an adult and has been severely mistreating me.” He paused. “What’s that? He has to move out immediately? But Mrs Hudson – what about the lockdown? I see – you don’t want a monster living above you. I understand. I’ll let him know.” He pounded on the door. “Do you hear that, John? She wants you out!”
“I’m talking about business, sir. You know meetings and spreadsheets and suits and ties. We’re very serious about our business and we’re prepared to be serious about yours as well, if you’d like to make us an offer.”
John nodded again. "Kind of. But different, too. More," he said. "I like you a lot more."
John turned on his side a bit, shifting to lie on the sofa like he had when Sherlock first left. He was glad it was dark and he was alone in the flat. He didn't think he could have ever admitted  this in person.
“You are strangely easy to talk to,” Sherlock said. “Do you use your medical expertise to do so or just your charm to get to the truth?”
"I am lucky," John agreed. "Mrs. Hudson proved that."
"Should we . . . lie down?" Sherlock asked tentatively.
“I mean I can’t really walk around pressed against you while you’re seeing patients,” Sherlock said. “Are you planning to quit?”
"That's okay. We're only chatting."
John shrugged. "We talked about this at dinner last night, Sherlock. She wants to do it."
Sherlock pressed his hands against John’s bare chest, more muscular than he’d expected. He leaned down and kissed his mouth roughly. John returned the kiss just as hard, his hands now working to get Sherlock's trousers open and off. Sherlock followed John’s lead, unzipping John’s jeans and sliding his hand inside. He palmed John’s through his pants as he nipped on his neck. John swore softly, stepping back with a soft groan to push the rest of his clothes to the floor and stepped out of everything. He tugged Sherlock to the bed, climbed on him and kissed him hard again.
“There’s that charm . . .” Sherlock said. “I wouldn’t say no.”
"Not the same," Harry said. "Who are these people tacked up here? Cold cases? Works in progress?"
John smiled and waved at both of them as he walked towards the door.
"I wish you didn't have to go either," John said. "But you're going to love it. The science program -- you can do so many cools things. Better than our school."
“It’s really hot in the sun,” Sherlock said as soon as they got into the shades of the woods.
"Too bad we didn't think about it then," John said.
"It wasn't that," Sherlock said, leaning back against the pillow. "It's just that I wanted to wait for a global pandemic . . . I just thought it'd make it that much more special."
"What's the matter?" John asked.
Sherlock smiled to himself and then closed his eyes, thinking for a few minutes. “Did you understand what I was trying to tell you?” he whispered.
Sherlock looked over at John who was smiling. He picked up his hand and squeezed.
Sherlock took a sip of tea. “Do you want to lie down?” he asked.
John shrugged. "What do you want to do?"
“Is the tea ready?” Sherlock asked when he answered the phone.
“I see it," John said.
John laughed. "No thank you," he said.
John smiled back and stuffed his hands into his pockets, walking with Sherlock inside and straight to Greg's office.
John turned, the coat swishing around his legs a bit. "No? Are you starting to see my potential?" he teased, lifting the collar again and modelling it.
Sherlock took one more sip and then set his cup down. He gave John a kiss and said, “Let me at least go change out of these clothes.”
Sherlock looked over. “Good time?” he asked. “What does that mean?”
"Well, I wasn't actually working on your pipes at all,” John reminded him.
John reached out and touched his arm to stop him. "Hold on. You know if you call, I'll be right here," he said. “Now stop fretting -- of course you’ll solve this case because you solve everything, right?”
"They're fun. It’s nice to get lost in something fantastic," he said.
Sherlock opened the door to his bedroom, took a deep breath, and stepped inside. He looked into the dark space, remembering every inch of it. He decided not to turn on the light -- just in case he did and everything looked different. He moved over and opened a drawer, reaching in and feeling around for a pair of pajamas. Thank god, they were there. That must mean John had left things as they were in there. He stripped off his clothes, slipped into his pajamas, and then climbed into his bed. He recognised the comfort. He pulled the blanket up, turned onto his side and sunk into the feeling. At least this was one place that felt just as he’d remembered -- one thing that hadn’t changed at all.
“You’re not making a mess, are you?” his mum asked as she came in.
Sherlock stood up. “Good night,” he said as he walked to the door.
John nodded. "Something to be stronger, faster, be able to fly . . . it would be cool."
"No thanks. I'm already sleepy," he said. He got up and took care of the food and then headed for his bedroom.
John stuffed his phone into his pocket. He was skeptical. The flat wasn't very far at all, but it had to be expensive. Still, Molly knew the woman and she was expecting him, so when he finished for the day, he headed to Baker Street.
John moaned softly. "That feels good . . ."
“He claimed to be a client,” Sherlock said. “He didn’t come in obviously, I didn’t even open the door. I just can’t believe there are idiots like that out there.” Which was stupid to say because of course he was well aware of the amount of idiots in the world since he spent a great deal of his time pointing them out.
Sherlock shifted a little in the bed, turning toward John. “Stop talking -- I was practically asleep and you woke me up,” he teased.
"I dare you . . . to tell me what's in the bottom of your bedside cabinet."
Sherlock’s body jerked from the initial touch, but it didn’t really sting. “Is it bad?” he asked. “Will I be able to sleep?”
“Well, I guess no harm done,” she said. “Are you both staying safe?”
John nodded against Sherlock's shoulder. "I did."
"I love you too."
It didn't answer John's curiosity, but he kissed Sherlock again and made to move lower, kissing his way down Sherlock's neck to his chest.
“You follow your own finger,” Sherlock said, grabbing his hand and squeezing it before pushing him away. “You and my brother said I was fine, that all I needed was rest. Were you lying to me?”
“Like a child or are you saying you never dated when you were a young adult?”
“It’s not my fault what happens when I’m asleep,” Sherlock said. He quickly moved his foot close to John’s face and then moved it back. “Remember the first time you slept over and you had to call your mum in the middle of the night?” he laughed.
"Home," she said. "We can drop you off on our way."
"Your body . . . is strong," Sherlock said. "It's good."
John had grabbed Mrs Hudson’s present and returned to her flat.
"You're the one keeping information. You won't tell me what happened at the lab."
"What is it?" John asked, trying to grab it.
John kept looking at the bed. "This morning I thought about coming home from work and someone offered to give me a back rub, and then I had to take my shirt off and it turned into a proper massage so I took everything off and it just kind of . . .went from there," he rambled.
“You’re very thin,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and fiddled with John’s navel.
“Won what?”
They shifted until they both had hands on each other, stroking, kissing, and breathing together. It was hot, sensual, and John could hardly think straight. Sherlock swiped his thumb over the tip of John's cock and he gasped -
He took it from her and set it on his bag. "What is it? A cheque? Have you two been paying him to tolerate me?" he asked.
"I'm a friend of Molly's, we went to school together," he said. "Do you know her, or is it just . . ." He trailed off and motioned towards the man beside her. "Sorry, I didn't get your name," he said.
Sherlock remembered each and every word John had spoken to him.
“Excuse me, Sherlock?” Her tone was polite and inquisitive. Sherlock raised his eyebrows in surprise, and yet there was no cutting remark that John had learned to expect. Clearly, Mary knew how to handle Sherlock, even in his current condition. John felt pride swelling inside him as he regarded his wife. He smiled to himself and went back to the kettle, which had just finished boiling, the steam rising in swirling, grey columns around the kitchen.
, a home and a
Mrs Hudson cleared her throat timidly. Three pairs of eyes locked on her. “I think I should be off now.”
As his eyes roamed over the many tubes and wires attached to his friend, John felt his heart clench. What had he been thinking, going back to Mary? John Watson was honestly the most idiotic person in the whole world. Because there was a person that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, wanted to grow old with, and it wasn’t his wife.
John didn’t know, and probably didn’t care. Well, that’s what he’d told Mycroft when he was found, high as a kite, unceremoniously bundled into the back of the black car and found himself face to face with his older brother. He’d never seen Mycroft so angry in his life. If Sherlock was being honest, he had been more than a little scared of Mycroft. His voice had been so harsh, so cutting. So accusing. Mycroft never shouted, but he did then. He’d shouted about how much Sherlock was damaging his body – which had been through enough recently without returning to ‘the sauce’ as Mycroft so elegantly put it. And Sherlock hadn’t put up a word in his defense, because what was the point? There was no defense. Sherlock knew he’d done something stupid but he really just hadn’t cared by this point.
John had lost a great many things waiting for Sherlock, the most important and most painful loss had been Mary. But that made John more determined to hang on to what he had left, and what he ha left was Sherlock.
Still, as he walked through the streets of London, he couldn’t help but notice the volume of people staring. One girl, early 20s – 22 judging by the way she dressed, the people she was with, the bleach-blonde pixie cut hair and the make-up plastering her face –seemed to have more courage than most. She approached the tall, dark-haired man and asked him, “Are you that detective that jumped? The fake? Aren’t you meant to be dead?”
Mycroft’s words had echoed in his mind over the entire journey to Bart’s.
“Sherlock-”
“Only the parts when he talks about our cases,” he admitted. It was true. Sherlock was only interested in how John made their cases sound. The better they sounded and the more intelligent John made Sherlock out to be, the more cases they would get, and end Sherlock’s insufferable boredom.
A few tears escaped form Sherlock’s eyes as the memories flooded his head.
He was alarmingly thin, and yet, by some miracle, was still alive and and able to function.
His heart broke for the loss of such an amazing woman. In a time when he’d been at his most vulnerable, Mary and John had supported him, treated him like a friend, even when that was called into question. And how had he repaid them?
"Eat something. For me, please?"
. When Mary had shot Sherlock, the consulting detective had nearly died, but it was so much worse, so much more serious when he had nearly died because he’d wanted to die, that he’d purposefully pumped his body so full of drugs that it would have surely killed him if John had not arrived on time.
“Of course.” As she turned back to look at John, he felt himself mirroring that smile. Mary gestured towards the living room with a wave of her hand. Sherlock moved forwards, into the flat, and he followed Mary and John down the hallway. Mary turned her head to look at him.
He was immediately sent into surgery. The surgeons worked tirelessly to remove the bullet from John's chest, having been informed that this was a very high priority patient. It was very close to his lungs, uncomfortably so. At two points, they could hear the long, loud note which helpfully pointed out that the patient's heart had stopped beating.
They'd begun the game at John's suggestion. He still needed reassurance that Sherlock's brain was fully functioning. It was a basic deduction game - John would point at a pedestrian as they passed them in the cab on their way back to Baker Street, and Sherlock would relay every deduction he could to John in the time he had. On and on it went. So far it had been full of insults from Sherlock, and much eye rolling on John's behalf.
“Yes, amazing is a better word,” Sherlock agreed. “I am less articulate in moments like that.”
“Juno who?” Sherlock asked.
“Partly,” Sherlock said. He won his solitaire game and as the cards began to bounce around the screen, there was a noise of applause so he quickly hit the mute button. “It’s going to be a little more complicated than yours,” he said loudly. “I hope that’s not a problem.”
"That's good. That's important." John sipped his tea. "What is it that you do?"
"Are you all right?" Sherlock asked again.
John glanced at Sherlock's mum before pushing the bite in his mouth. "Where?"
He hesitated. He bit his lip and clicked them open, reading through them. What was he doing? He couldn't just be a detective without Sherlock. He wasn’t the detective, he was the blogger. That’s who they were.
She sat down next to him. "I'm sorry for being grouchy -- your father is frustrating me, you know how he gets before trips." She pulled his cup from his hands and took a sip. "That's why we wanted you boys here -- we planned this trip and wanted to make sure we got to celebrate with you."
He resisted downplaying it. Compared to what Sherlock had done these cases were child's play, but he didn't want to keep putting himself down every time. It was bound to get old. So he’d accepted the compliment and left it at that.
John raised his glass and smiled. "I hope so too," he said. He turned and walked away from the man, smiling wider when he knew he couldn't be seen.
“Good,” Sherlock said. “We should’ve tried it before maybe -- saved you all that money on your stupid dates.” He stretched a little. “Did you like doing it that way or do you think you’d prefer something else?”
John rolled his eyes at her and she punched his arm playfully. "I love you," she said. "He does, too."
"But I'm extra smart, don’t forget," John said.
Sherlock humphed and stood up to go to his desk. “I’m thinking,” he said. “That is work.”
Sherlock smiled. “Well, it’s probably crime-based as well, if I’m honest,” he said. “However, we’re not staying around long enough for anything like that.” He directed John out onto the next street. “We’re headed over there,” he added, pointing to a path surrounded by trees.
John saw Sherlock's message in the morning.
John raised his hand in a wave. Greg have him some more information about the case, the woman, and her habits. He studied a photo of her and headed out to get started. This was going to be interesting.
“I see,” she said suspiciously.
John finished eating, put away the leftovers, and then sat with his computer to start taking notes. He started with what Sherlock told him before he forgot it all, and then devised his own plan about trying to find the girlfriend tomorrow.
"I'm in. I wanted to ask you about the case," he said.
By Monday, Sherlock’s usefulness had paid off and Lestrade had a case for him -- well, not a case but a task and that was good enough for now. He’d put in a request with Molly for some skin cell samples and made his way over to see her.
“John is fine,” Sherlock said. “Everything is fine up here. We’re fine.” He glanced over at John. They’d been fine since that fight, right? He looked back down at her. “Are you all right?” he asked. “Can we do anything for you?”
“It’s insulting because I enjoy spending time with you, and it does seem like you spend a lot of time trying to find someone else you’d rather be with,” Sherlock mumbled. He finished his cigarette and flicked the butt out the window. “I’ll get that later,” he lied. “Besides, do we really want different things? We both want to try new things that feel good, don’t we? I think we just covered that –- maybe you should listen more carefully.”
"I do like working together! But I already had these plans, Sherlock. I'm trying to make plans with you, too."
"I don't want to play," John said, his voice louder than he meant it to be. "Two hours ago I thought you were dead and now . . . it's not the same, Sherlock. This doesn’t . . . I need more time."
Sherlock turned. “Yeah,” he said. “Unless you do it differently now.”
"Do you mean I don't look smart enough?" John teased.
“What do you want me to do?” Sherlock said. “Do you like it like this or something else?”
“Are we going to have dinner? Are you going to cook something or do you need to rest?”
John shook his head. "No, I'm okay for now."
John hummed as he pulled off. "Can you reach the lube in my drawer?" he asked, taking Sherlock into his mouth again.
"You're quite good at all this," Sherlock said before crashing his mouth into John's, kissing as they both stroked and rocked against each other. John moaned softly before he let go and came between them, rutting into Sherlock as his free hand gripped his hair.
"I think so. I assume you have as well?" John asked.
“Fine,” she said. “So have you and Sherlock been planning this trip long?”
“Well, look around – I’ve got quite a few interesting artifacts, excellent books, good whiskey,” he said, holding up his glass. “You’re . . . okay as well.”
"Oh, just a lot of stuff," John said vaguely.
"No. Things have changed.”
John turned on the light and waved his hand to show off the whole room, smiling at Sherlock, waiting to read his feelings about where this might go.
John pretended to think carefully. "Yeah, I can."
He glanced over at her. “Yes, I imagine so,” he said. He closed up the cooler and thanked her once again before leaving.
"Crime? Shall I write it up on the blog?" John asked.
"Before I came here, I was in the army," John said.
"No," John said. "I like it."
“You always think positive, and it’s really annoying,” Sherlock said, grabbing a pillow and hitting John.
John reached over and touched his hand. "Of course I like you."
John moved away slowly and nodded.
John nodded. "I thought it was because of the case, the way you were acting . . . but I see now," he said.
"Sherlock, too?"
"Nothing yet -- I saw her but we didn’t talk.”
“I’d like to see that,” Sherlock said. He realised for some reason, he actually really would.
"Busy," John said. "Mostly boring stuff, though."
Once they were out of sight, Sherlock lit a cigarette and handed it to his father. He lit another for himself.
When they went back into the house, his mother appeared with two cups of tea and some biscuits.
John laughed. "No." He grabbed the pad and hid it from Sherlock as he wrote down Mrs Hudson. Without showing Sherlock he got closer and replaced the note on Sherlock's forehead with the one he wrote. "You have to guess who I wrote."
“Well, I have literally no idea where the copy of the lease is, so why don’t you try it for a month and by then I’ll have located it and if you are both still alive and willing, we can sign it then?” she proposed.
John shook his head.
Sherlock emerged from his room, closing the door behind him. “I’m not hungry,” he said, turning the kettle on. “But I’ll sit with you while you eat.”
“Yes, well, it took me a little time to understand precisely what was happening,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. “Obviously you were interesting to me -- which is why I invited you to move in here, but in a relatively short time, these feelings have intensified, and I wasn’t quite sure what to do about the revelation.”
Sherlock ignored the comment. “Is something wrong? I mean, is my brain not working and that’s why I can’t remember things and why no one will let me speak to the doctor?” he asked.
“Of course,” Sherlock said.
"I don't know, Sherlock, this is the second time tonight I've gotten lucky," he grinned.
She sighed and nodded. "True. I hope his mother isn't too fond of her walls . . ." She looked at the bullet hole smiley face on the wall. "Hmm. Well, I just came up to tell you if you need anything just let me know."
John stood up. “It sounds like you’ve solved it,” he said.
“I hate to break it to you, Sherlock Holmes,” she said. “But today is not about you. It’s about Molly. So behave.”
Sherlock felt himself tense slightly, and he avoided John’s eyes.
“Okay, stop talking, I need to concentrate,” Sherlock said. He continued playing, trying to turn all his focus to the game. It was mindless, and right now Sherlock wanted to stay out of his mind.
"To tell me what you think about when you're . . . you know -- from the game earlier -- otherwise, I'm the grand prize winner and I know you hate that," Sherlock said.
Sherlock leaned down again, trying to give John enough room, to kiss John’s mouth. “Will you come to my flat?” he asked. His voice was rough as his heart was pounding and his breath uneven.
"It’s okay -- if you want to try with me?"
Sherlock looked up at Harry and then over at John. "Yes," he mumbled and turned back to the kettle, pouring two cups. He handed one to John. "Am I supposed to make one for her?" he asked him.
After a few hours, John couldn't read another word, so he opened his laptop and went to their blog, looking through comments and sending a few replies. Then he opened a card game and started playing that until he was hungry enough to get up and start dinner.
John wondered if this was some kind of delivery system. Before he could think more about it, Amanda came out and sat in the chair beside him. They talked about small stuff -- how business was doing, how long she had worked there, and when she started asking questions about John's life, he kept his answers vague, leaning closer and touching her arm as he moved the conversation easily back to her. There was still no mention of a boyfriend, so John asked about a possible date. It forced her hand a bit, and he noticed that she hesitated a bit before saying they could plan something when she checked her schedule.
Sherlock pulled out two plates from the cupboard. “Well, have you cracked the case -- used your brilliant charm to seduce a confession?” he asked.
John waved the ticket at Sherlock. "A hundred pounds."
John smiled wider, rolling his own hips to grind against Sherlock. "Definitely,” he said.
John took the toast and smiled at Sherlock. "Thanks," he said, setting it down in front of him and digging in. “There’s nothing else to do, I might as well try to make up for all the sleep I’ve lost in my life.”
John laughed. "What a nice thing to say," he smiled.
John swiped his hands over his face and then paused. "Hello?" He swore he heard the door open. He pulled the curtain enough to pop his head out.
“Nice try,” Mycroft said. “One day? I can’t trust you for one day?”
“All right,” Sherlock said. “I’m going to make a cup of tea, though. Do you want one?”
When they hung up, Sherlock spent the rest of the night packing. The next day he woke up and saw the pile of library books he’d found on his shelves. He packed them into two bags and headed off to the library. On the way back, he saw Jim and Ellen leaning against a tree, kissing. He kept his head down and turned.
"Hmm. The most observant detective doesn't realise I left the house, what does that tell you?" he asked. He finished his food and got up to clean the plate.
“I suppose,” he answered.
“It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock said tersely. “I’d like some information on Strattenburg piece you had stolen.”
Sherlock looked round the flat, trying to decide if John would want him to tidy anything before she arrived. He wasn't sure so he sat down in his chair. He wasn't sure Harry's visit was going to be a good one, and he worried that John was going to be hurt.
"It’s just a salad -- I'll have room for ice cream.”
“Me too,” John said. He started to drift off to sleep, wondering what his next dream would be.
Sherlock smiled. "If you insist," he said, sitting up. He started explaining what he'd been investigating. "If I can prove it, you can see how useful it'd be."
"Hmm, I think he got in some trouble. He looks very sketchy." John gasped. "Look! This boy just stole this woman's wallet!"
"Please," John whined. He moved against Sherlock, into his hand. "I want you."
Sherlock looked up quickly. Of course, his brother knew he couldn’t remember. It was like he could see into Sherlock’s head.
“Ready?” Sherlock asked in a breathy voice.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Those are very childish, John," he said. "I had no idea you had such childish tendencies." He glanced over and made a smarmy smile. "Let's tell stories again -- I enjoyed telling you about my trip to the Arctic." He got up to put the kettle on. "I've already had a turn so it's your go -- tell me about your favourite holiday."
Sherlock pulled her wine glass toward him. “All right you’re cut off,” he said. “Complaining about things being boring is very childish -- you must be drunk.”
They started to eat. Eventually, Sherlock coughed a little and said, “I have learned something from all this.” He took a sip of wine before continuing. “You weren’t there with me that day . . . I know that’s my fault, I went out without telling or waiting for you to get back. But I know I act impulsively and -- let’s be honest -- most of the time, that’s what’s needed. I’m not planning on changing that because it’s often how I work best. But you’re not being there . . . if you’d been there, I doubt I’d have fallen.”
"Good, that's good," John said.
John nodded. He leaned down and kissed Sherlock, beginning to move his hips slowly.
"What? Mrs Holmes! Hello," John said. He pushed Sherlock, but he was laughing. "Sherlock dressed up like a mouse. I'll send you a photo of the excellent make up I did." He raised his brows at Sherlock.
“No,” Sherlock said. “That’s not what I’m looking for.” He stepped a little closer to John.
“What do you need?” he asked.
John moved down lower, sucking one nipple and playing with the other. Sherlock's cock twitched which only made John's even harder. He pressed his hips to Sherlock's thigh so he would feel it.
Sherlock turned his head and looked at him. “It doesn’t have to mean anything, though,” he said. “Just a bit of an adventure, yeah?”
"I already have a weapon and by the time you get to my legs I'll have you ended," John snapped through the door. "You want to talk to me about peace and quiet while you pace and pace and pace -- tell me, do you step on the creakiest boards on purpose?"
“I see. So you’re planning to be walking around naked for the rest of the lockdown?” Sherlock asked, flopping back down on the sofa.
His mum was now trimming one of the bushes. She smiled when she saw John and came over to the table. “It’s lovely to see you, John,” she said. “Let me get you some lemonade or something.”
“How’s my breathing?” Sherlock said, inhaling deeply and letting out a loud exhale.
“This is the first thing I’ve eaten really,” Sherlock said. “But I knew you were coming so I wanted to have something.”
“Fair enough,” Sherlock said. He leaned over and grabbed the remote. When he turned on the television, an old movie had just started so they settled on the sofa and watched that.
"No. I was young, out with friends," John said.
"No! Do you?" John asked, his hand pausing.
“No, you’re not a child.”
“We were interesting the other day, don’t forget.” Sherlock looked over at John. “In truth, you’re better than okay, John – I just didn’t want you to get too cocky.”
"That's generous of you. If I pick listen to music, do I get to pick the music?" John asked.
John nodded. "I barely ate at home. We had leftovers heated up -- I knew your mum would have something good," he grinned.
"I would say it is very interesting. Very out of the normal.”
“Let’s get you home,” he said, reaching for her arm. “I think you’re overly tired.” He gave her a smile, and they headed out, finding a taxi to take them home to Baker Street.
Sherlock was already back on the sofa. “What film do you want to watch -- your pick. Anything is fine with me,” Sherlock called.
“You raise a good point but obviously I’ve already considered that,” Sherlock said, getting up and picking up their plates. “I’m going to do the washing up now. I think you should go up to your room and put your pajamas on and get into bed.”
Lestrade sighed. “I was calling to say it turns out you were right,” he said.
“All right,” Sherlock said. He watched him go. He got up to check his email. Still no new queries, which today felt all right. He just wanted to spend the day with John without any distractions from work.
Sherlock nodded a little. “But the other kids . . . I won’t have you there to help when I act the wrong way,” he said.
She looked him up and down. "No, I suppose not."
“All right,” Sherlock said. He took his empty mug and set it balanced on John’s thigh.
“In all honesty, I still feel a bit tired,” Sherlock said. There was no point in lying. “You can look at me after dinner.”
Sherlock pulled out the mug and said, “I was looking for this last year -- I guess I forgot I put it in here.” He set it down next to him. He pulled out two photographs. Of course, he could remember everything about the two days they’d been taken. He could remember everything. He wiped a hand under his eye and put the photos back in the box. “Here’s your film,” he said, handing it over to John.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. “Here, you work for a bit,” he added, giving John the shovel.
"Now I am a handyman," John agreed without adding more, eating another piece of sushi instead.
"I helped Mrs. Hudson with some shopping she had to get done," John said. He sipped the tea Sherlock gave him.
John watched him for a moment. "Honestly? Please don't lie."
John reached to stroke Sherlock’s cock. "I want this . . .” he mumbled.
“What do you want to do now?” Sherlock asked. “It’s not too late.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said. He led John upstairs and into the kitchen.
Sherlock reached around John’s body with one hand and began to stroke John’s hard cock. He kept rocking John against him, pressing his own cock through his rough trousers against John’s bare skin. His mouth dropped to the top of John’s shoulder, biting it softly.
John shifted against the back of the sofa when he felt something push him slightly. He suddenly had more space, so he got comfortable and tugged the blanket a little higher.
“Excellent,” Sherlock said. “That’s what I love about you, John Watson – I really did not think that was what you were going to say. All right. I’m coming with you, right? That sounds fine with me.”
“I’m on my way home,” Sherlock said. He lit a cigarette and rushed back to the flat. “Thank god,” he said, coming in. “What do I need to know?”
“Don’t spoil the afternoon with unfounded accusations,” Sherlock said. He sat down in his chair. “Well, that was fun.”
"She said it's a step, making amends," he said. He glanced up again. "I know this isn't ideal, I tried to stop her, but if I just let her do her thing, it'll be over faster."
"Don't interrupt," John said. "So. They wanted a puppy, but their mum said no. Too much responsibility. The kids wanted to prove her wrong. But with what? And then, as luck would have it, that very night they got their answer!" John smiled as he remembered. "There was a rattling in the bin. Working together, the children caught a rat."
“And I just expected you to bring him along,” she said. “Has he gone to see his family?”
____________________________________
John raised his brows. "Well, as tempting as that sounds I have to go to work still and I can't be at home all the time," he said.
He took a slow, deep inhale and tried to think. The air smelled distinct, and the breath hurt his body. There were not good signs.
“Relevancy?”
John closed his laptop and grabbed his coat and moments later, they were in a taxi.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. He looked over. “I’ll text you if there’s a case, yeah?” he called as John headed out. He sat and finished his tea. The flat seemed so quiet. He got up and opened a window, just to let some sounds in. Then he checked his email -- he received one response but instead of listing times to meet, it asked about prices. No, that’s not how it worked -- obviously Sherlock needed more details before he could estimate how much his time the case would need. He didn’t feel like dealing with that right now, so he shut his computer.
“About my feelings,” Sherlock said. “Come out, please.”
“Well, you’d better get used to it if you’re going into the Army,” Sherlock said. “Stop being a baby now -- let’s go to sleep.”
John stepped out, smoothed his clothes a bit more and went back into the reception hall.
“So the flat thing is real . . .” Sherlock said. “Well, this is my flat.”
John nodded. "Yes, let's get ready, I'm sure she'll be here soon."
“It’s pretty heavy. I brought in the shovels earlier,” Sherlock said, nodding over to the corner. “We’ll see how dig we can deep in about fifteen minutes. That should be enough.” He took a sip of tea. “Are you sleepy? Afterward, we could watch another film or something.”
"Are you leaving?" John asked, pushing up to sit.
She nodded. John took the address from Sherlock and they left together.
"Finally. Get your things, you're expected at Mother's."
"I love you too," he said, rubbing Sherlock's back.
"Yeah, but that's different," John pointed out.
"I said someone we don't like. We. Am I right?"
Sherlock smiled back. “I’m extremely sleepy,” he said. “But we need to clean up.” He leaned over and grabbed his shirt from the floor. “You can sleep in my bed or in this one with me if you’d like.”
"There's no condoms! A box of cigarettes, though, but I'll be nice and leave it." He took his hands out and popped the collar. "Do I look cool? Clever?"
Sherlock dropped his chin to the top of John’s head and tried to use his thigh muscles to lift and lower his body in a steady rhythm. He kissed him hard on the mouth and then closed his eyes as his body moved on John and his hand moved on his own cock. John pushed away his hand and gripped Sherlock's cock, taking over stroking his cock. "I want to make you feel good," he moaned.
John kissed him more enthusiastically, his hand in his curls again. Sherlock lifted his hands to John’s head, tipping it to deepen the kiss. A small moan escaped his lips as his body slid closer to John’s.
Sherlock stared at the cursor and then added.
“Of course, you are,” Jim said with a smile. “You’ve never been normal -- why start now?”
Sherlock leaned into John, pressing their bodies together. “Are you keeping your clothes on as well?” he asked before nuzzling against John’s neck.
"Teasing? Sherlock doesn't do teasing. Does he? I've just never seen that, John. Does he do that with you?"
He drew his finger all around the perimeter of John's face, letting it drift to his neck, before lifting it up to John's mouth. He pressed against John's lips and then moved it to the corner, pulling up as if to force John into a half smile. Finally he moved it up to John's forehead again, drawing a small heart, and the wrapping his hand around John's body, squeezing himself closer.
She nodded and said, “Basically. Well . . .?”
John nodded. "Yeah, I went to work for a bit this morning. I’m glad to see you're up and walking around," he said.
“I’ve seen John attempt to flirt -- he can barely get women’s phone numbers, let alone any criminal confessions,” he said. “Flirting is not what he needs to do . . . he needs to build trust.” He glanced over at John. “Which is something he can do,” he admitted. He turned back to Lestrade. “Will it be dangerous?”
John sent Sherlock the message and leaned back in the seat of the taxi. He was a bit tired but eager to get home again. Hopefully, they would have a case when he got home. It had been a little while, and he knew Sherlock was at his best with a clear focus.
"I'm okay," John said. "Fine."
Eventually he woke up. He could see that it was dark out, but wasn’t sure what time it was. Or what day it was, to be honest, as his post-case sleeps sometimes lasted ridiculously long.
"I don't think she'll by that," John said, smiling over at him.
“All right,” Sherlock said. He lifted his hand for a taxi. “You can pay for this ride with your lottery winnings,” he said with a smile as a cab pulled up.
“This is sexy,” Sherlock said. He dropped his head to suck on John’s neck as his hand found John’s cock and he started a slow stroke.
"Hmm, I suppose you are pretty good," John agreed.
John laughed. "They were all sport games!" He finished up his tea. "Just show me where the stuff is. By the time you finish making the rest of dinner, I'll have a nice fire going for the meat."
“Right,” Sherlock said, giving him a little wink as he turned away to get his bag. “Let’s go,” he said to his brother. “Where’s the wheelchair?”
John stroked his cock a bit faster, moving his hips to get more of the vibrator. "God Sherlock..." he moaned, his head falling back on the chair.
“Neither of you is the boss of me,” Sherlock said. He ate another bite.
Sherlock shuddering lightly, closing his eyes. "It's so much already, John . . ." he moaned softly. "It's like I've been waiting forever. . ."
“Your other friends -- they’re nice to you, though, right?”
"He's gone. He does that."
“I’ll try,” Sherlock said, not entirely sure what that meant or if he could actually manage it. “Are you cross with me?”
“It feels too tight,” Sherlock said, unbuttoning the top. “I think I’ve put on weight.”
John set the bags down and considered a few numbers before picking, shading in the choices, before passing the ticket to the man. "I hope I'm lucky for you," he told her.
"That's not what I was thinking about doing," Sherlock said. He pushed John back gently against the wall. "What are you thinking about?"
“Well, there’s that little woods and I think there might be a small lake or something, but it’s not far from the village,” she said. “Do you remember any of it?”
“Let’s,” Sherlock said. He got up and put some food from the bags into the fridge. Then he let them out, locking the door behind them and sticking the key as deep in his pocket as he could. “Let’s go around the back and see if there are any paths and if we want to follow them.”
“Do you want some?” Sherlock asked.
John got ready for his date, made sure he had cash on him, and moved through the flat to go. He bumped into Sherlock on the stairs. "Oh, hey," he said. "I'm just heading out, did you solve your case?" he asked.
“Our faces are so close together,” he said. “Do you want me to move?”
“You’re the baby,” Sherlock mumbled and then lay quietly for a while. “John? You asleep?” he whispered.
"You disappear on me all the time. I wasn't far, you could have called me," he said.
Sherlock looked over at John. Two could play this game. "Fine," he said. "Go right ahead. I think after I finish this cup of tea, I might go up and put on one of your jumpers."
John turned and saw Harry sprawled out looking at him. "Yes. You can call if you need anything. Just try to stay out of Sherlock's way, yeah?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John?”
“Why aren’t you being normal?” Sherlock asked as they walked up the stairs to that flat. He didn’t know what was going on with John – he wasn’t sure if he should ask so he hadn’t. But they were just at Lestrade’s office and John was not himself. Sherlock thought even Lestrade had noticed. This was not acceptable: Sherlock needed John at the top of his game when it came to work.
"Why are you doing this?" Sherlock asked him.
Sherlock exhaled loudly and then opened his eyes to look into John’s. “I’m going to come soon, okay?” he said before squeezing his eyes shut again.
“No,” he said grumpily, taking a sip of his tea which was now cold. How long had he been sitting there doing nothing? He stood up. “Do you need something?” he asked as he moved to the kitchen.
"So fine -- what it is you are so desperate to do, Doctor Watson?" Sherlock asked. He reached over and grabbed his pajamas. "Be specific or I get dressed right now."
“I confess my payment to Mrs Hudson is not always consistent, with your new job, you’d be able to contribute something to the rent on a regular basis?”
“You won’t be able to have it delivered out there!”
“That's all right," John said. "It was worth it."
Sherlock moaned at the touch of John's mouth and slipped his hand into John's hair, pulling it lightly.
"Okay, count again," John said.
“We talked last night,” he said. He took another sip, but still didn’t look over at her. “Do you think that’s a stupid idea?”
"What do you mean? You don't know?"
John nodded. "Do you?"
"I told you I didn't know anything else!" John laughed.
“Obviously, no,” Sherlock said. “But you’ve got other things now . . . other people.”
"Yeah," John nodded. "I'll be back tomorrow."
“I told you you’d get scared,” Sherlock said. He leaned over John to grab the glass and took a quick sip before setting it back down. “That’s why I brought whiskey – in case you needed courage.”
“Not at all,” Sherlock said. “You’re very fit, I think. I’m just wondering if the food thing will be an issue.”
“No, John,” Sherlock said. “Now is the time. I want to feel home . . . make me feel at home.” He dropped his empty mug on the floor. Then he bent down and untied his shoes, took off his socks, rolled them into two balls, and threw them at John. “Snap at me,” he said. “Like before.”
Sherlock let his hips go and seconds later he was coming, mumbling and kissing John’s mouth.
John kissed the top of his head. He closed his eyes and felt properly relaxed for the first time in a long time.
Sherlock pinched John's side before leaning over to slide John's cock into his mouth. He held the base and moved up and down the length, using his tongue to swirl around the shaft. John moaned and squirmed as he struggled not to buck up into his mouth. “Fuck, Sherlock,” he mumbled.
“I suppose it depends on my brother,” he said.
John smiled. "Let's lay down," he said.
"I'm always going to live here with you," he said.
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock looked over at the tall man then smiled smugly. “Believe him,” he said. He pulled the handsome man close, slipping his arm around his back.
"I'm not making tea again, Sherlock. You've had three cups."
“We’ll need to see the others as well,” Sherlock said as he pulled open the drawer and began looking at the body.
Sherlock lay quietly for a few minutes. “You’ve changed everything, John,” he said sleepily.
"Public speaking," John said. "I hated it. But I felt like they were all stupid. I just wanted to do the cool medical stuff."
Sherlock exhaled loudly and then slowly opened his eyes. “Well, that was more entertaining than that band downstairs,” he said with a smile. He lifted a hand to wipe away the hair that was stuck with sweat to his forehead.
"I've been working, same as you," John said. “I think it’s going well. Honestly, I’m thinking by the end of the week, I’ll have enough to nail this guy.”
John came down and looked over at Sherlock, raising his arm in a greeting before heading to the kitchen for his tea.
"Me too.”
"That's perfect. But you're not allowed to solve it and ruin the mystery for me."
“Fuck, that’s good, John,” Sherlock said, dropping a hand to rest softly on John’s head. He stroked his hair lightly. “You’re so good . . .”
John looked up and was sure he was hallucinating. He pushed the computer onto the sofa and stood slowly. "How . . . you . . ." He started shaking his head. "I saw you . . . "
“This is stupid,” Sherlock said, getting up and grabbing his book again.
John looked between them wondering who this was.
"We should be quiet for a bit, I think," Sherlock said wistfully. "But I do want to ask you one thing. Are you drunk?"
“We went out for a cigarette,” he said. “Dancing was boring.”
Sherlock was quiet for a few moments. “I found the suitcase,” he said quietly.
Sherlock leaned against the door, listening to the sound of the man’s footsteps down the stairs and then the opening and closing of the front door.
“Right,” Sherlock said. “Do you ever go out?”
However, within the hour, Mrs Hudson was at the door. He opened it, but didn’t welcome her in.
“It’s me,” Sherlock said. “No uniform, no rank -- I hope that’s not going to be a problem,” he added with a grin.
John stopped and bit his lip. He erased that and started again.
“Clever,” Sherlock said. “And why did you decide to leave with me tonight?”
John stroked himself slowly, moaning as Sherlock moved over him, inside of him. "Oh God..."
“You’re not at the surgery tomorrow then?” Sherlock asked. “I used to know your schedule, but I don’t seem to know what’s going. Did you tell me you were doing work on the case after the surgery today? I don’t remember your telling me.”
“I think you’re the knight because you’re handsome,” Sherlock said. “Didn’t you say the knight was handsome?”
Sherlock kept himself from smiling. “All right then,” he said. “Last question and then I promise we need never speak of this again,” he said, leaving a pause too short for John to interrupt and stop him. “What is it about me you find so disgusting?”
John smiled. "We've been wasting time," he said.
“The fall . . . why didn’t I leave?” he asked again, thinking, remembering. “I thought I saw you --”
“I don’t like this kind,” he said.
Sherlock started kicking some dirt and then went into the kitchen and brought out a big bowl of water. “Here, you do it, since it’s your fire,” he said.
"Just some water for now," he said. "I’m glad you did the science team, Sherlock. It sounds cool."
Sherlock turned off the lamp and lay back in his bed, staring at the ceiling through the darkness. He knew he was feeling something or many things, he wasn’t sure yet, but he was feeling rather than thinking. He didn’t like it, he never had. He closed his eyes and just felt for a few minutes. Then he sat back up and decided to think instead.
John got out of the shower and saw his phone screen was lit up. He checked his messages and saw an address and a band name. He didn't know the band, but he'd been to the bar before. He was glad about that -- knowing the layout of the place ahead of time helped him keep a low profile. He threw some gel in his hair and ran his hands through it before getting dressed. Dark jeans, a t-shirt, and his jacket. He made sure his wallet and phone were in his pocket before grabbing his keys. He let his friend know he was on his way and went out to hail a cab.
Sherlock moved to the window to see if they really were leaving. He watched them get into a taxi and drive away. Annoying.
Sherlock glanced at Harry. "I can give you details later -- let me make the call, all right?" he said quietly. He disappeared into his room, shutting the door and then regretting having done so. He called his brother.
John moved closer and reached out to touch Sherlock, closing his eyes. "I missed you."
“I thought --” John started and then looked over at him smiling. He nodded, moving back to lean on the pillow against the headboard. "Okay," he said and patted his thigh.
"I'm not good at making up stories, but I’ll try.” John settled back and thought for a moment, trying to recall a memory he could turn into a story. "One time there were two kids that really, really wanted a pet. A puppy, actually."
“Doing my best,” Sherlock mumbled stupidly. “You’re very good at what you’re doing.”
"You were in a mood," John said.
“But you still want us to go on this trip, right?” Sherlock asked. “Will you come by tomorrow . . . my mum would like to see you, I think.”
John nodded quickly, his hand stroking faster. "I want you," he murmured.
Mycroft looked over at his brother. “Have you been in touch with Dr Watson?” he asked.
John laughed at the interaction but waited to see what she would say. He looked between them -- he was glad he was at this table with them.
After an hour, the biker dropped him off at a small hotel. Neither man spoke. Sherlock went inside. The man at the desk said, “Mr Smith, we’ve been expecting you.” He handed Sherlock a key and nodded down a hallway.
John nodded, gazing at Sherlock. He tasted like sweet tea. John's body was warm from the kiss in a way it hadn't been before. "Did you?"
“You solved the case and you’re alive -- not stupid at all,” Sherlock said. “I suppose you’ll just have to admit you’re as recognisable as I am. Perhaps we should get you a hat?”
Sherlock followed. “If working is just watching, I don’t think I can handle that,” he said and then smiled to himself at the irony. Thus far, that was what most of his work had consisted of, but he was working on Lestrade to give him more. In fact, he felt the same way about John. He’d also watched him, but wanted more and not just more of what they’d shared at John’s flat (though he did also want that).
"I'll find John's," she said. "Are you saying I can, then? I'll make a little partner for your friend there."
Sherlock put his phone in his pocket and pulled out a cigarette instead. If John was going to ruin his afternoon like this, he was going to pay him back by coming home stinking of tobacco. Once he’d finished it, he threw the butt on the street before unlocking the flat door and heading up to the flat, pushing open the door and bracing himself.
"There's some science in this. I don't know how real it is," he added.
John looked him up and down again. "Not anymore," he said.
Sherlock thought for a moment. Being at home with John was a hundred times more interesting than being here, but for the life of him, he couldn’t really think about what they did together. “Here,” he said, bringing their tea over to the table. “Stop harassing me. I’m taking mine outside while I have a cigarette.”
Sherlock smiled into the kiss. "I suppose you have no idea how badly you've been torturing me the last few months?" he asked.
“Not now,” Sherlock said.
John looked around the sitting room again. "It’s a bit cluttered," he said
!” A red flush crept up his neck from his collar.
Jonah glanced away.
"But ...", he stammered uncertainly, "you know what he needs, don’t
“I can see that. But why are you wearing that…”
I wandered through the rows of fruit and vegetable stalls and was already planning dinner when a deep, slightly rough voice spoke behind me.
"So, you're both free to go."
"Does it worry you?"
John was really only there to be a face, he zoned out as Sherlock spoke, not wanting to relive the moment again in his mind. He focused his eyes on the folded hands in his lap, just listening to the vague noise coming from Sherlock’s direction. He occasionally saw the flash of a camera, or the blink of a lens as it caught the light, but his eyes never moved. Sometimes he would hear other voices, never clearly, just voices. It was all just noise, roaring in his ears as he kept his eyes purely on his hands, not blinking, never moving. It wasn’t until he felt the long fingers poke his ribs tat he finally looked up.
Sherlock had never liked Mycroft invading his private life, so he accepted the deal grudgingly.
Sherlock sighed, partly in frustration, partly due to another emotion that he couldn’t name. It wasn’t empathy, or sympathy – Sherlock’s brain did not process either of these. But maybe he did now.
“Why was I there John?” John blinked a few times before being able to focus of Sherlock’s face.
The evening in baker Street was filled with a relaxed haze that often settled over them during the lull between cases. John had learned to enjoy these nights whilst he could, because at any given moment a client could turn up or they could get a phone call from and exhausted sounding Lestrade requesting their presence.
Greg knew what Sherlock meant. When he'd entered the flat, the wave of grief that washed over him was so powerful it overwhelmed him and he'd nearly turned around and walked straight back out. But he'd needed to remain strong - or appear to be - for Sherlock's sake.
A flash of yellow passed through Sherlock’s mind and he could see John’s face swimming in front of hi. His face was angled up, and Sherlock vaguely recognized that he was looking down at John as he was stood.
“Very.”
“Ah.”
How easy it was for Sherlock Holmes to fall in love with John Watson.
His head was spinning. He could feel the splitting pain returning, as if someone was ramming a white hot needle straight through his skull until it pierced the other side. He felt his vision go funny, and could feel wind whipping around him. But there shouldn’t be any wind in the lab.
“Who knows?” Sherlock took a deep breath. If he didn’t say it now he never would.
"Why?"
did you figure that out? What is the coffee stains on my sleeves from the type of coffee you can only get in the hospital? Can you see the lack of sleep I’ve been getting recently, and the creases on my shirt that show I have been sleeping in the chair beside a hospital bed that my wife occupies?” John’s eyes flashed, and Sherlock took the smallest step backwards. He knew that John was not one to be messed with today.
The fact that Mycroft obviously had surveillance on the flat should have made John uncomfortable, but he had always suspected something.
“I can’t leave him, not now.” His head turned towards his flatmate, still resting on the sofa. “He needs me Mrs Hudson, but I can’t take care of him. All I do is bring pain and difficulty into his life simply by existing. He would have been much better off if he’d never met me." Sherlock couldn’t stop the tears, no matter how much he tried. He wasn’t sobbing, he considered himself above that. He just let the tears slide silently, almost gracefully down his cheeks.
Sherlock looked quizzically at his, now rather pale, flatmate. "Do what? I'm only investigating the effects of-"
"Since you got up to make toast." Molly flushed red as she confessed her intrusion. "I did knock, but I don't think you heard. Mrs Hudson let me up."
“Obviously I went back to meet him that next night. He intrigued me, I’d never met a man like him before, and I honestly just wanted to see if he would actually show up. I got to the corner and there he was, jacket pulled tight because it was still bitterly cold. He took me to dinner.”
When skies are grey.
“You didn’t know her.” John was choking on the words, and, in a different situation, would have been amazed that Sherlock was able to recognise them as words. But the time for being amazed with Sherlock’s ability was definitely not at this moment.
Mycroft's tale had done nothing to calm John down. In fact, it was possible that he was panicking even more. He was extremely relieved and grateful that he was found by nurses and not anyone else. There was a great number of people in London who would have loved to land a punch or two to the consulting detective's face - and not all of them were criminals.
“Sherlock-”
“Right-o.”
"It killed me too. It killed me to do that, Sherlock. It killed me to live without you, to not ever see you again. I nearly died Sherlock, just to end the pain! I wanted to see you again so much I actually swallowed the goddam pills!"
The word echoed around the halls of his mind palace. He blinked rapidly and he stopped himself from breathing too deeply – it would convey his panic at the word. He forced himself to deliver a cutting remark.
, John thought,
John got out and straightened up. The rain had gotten a lot heavier during his brief time in the expensive black car. He walked up to the front door, already soaking. He heard the slam of the door behind him and he turned around and saw that his groceries were no longer in his field of view. He turned back to the house and knocked on the door. The impressive golden lettering against the dark wood of the door reminded him of Baker Street, and increased his desire to get back there as soon as possible. He’d left Sherlock to his own devices, and John had a uncomfortable feeling that it would involve an experiment that had the potential to burn the flat down.
