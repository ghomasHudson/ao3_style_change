Steve yet again, takes a photo while Tony is speaking. Tony rolls his eyes then raises his hands to grab the phone, Steve holds the phone out of her reach. They finally agree to call a truce then take actual Instagram worthy pictures.
After three rounds of an intense Rock Paper Scissors, Steve loses. Tony, smiling in his glory, makes Steve go get him a drink, claiming that it’s too far and he's too tired to get it. Steve, claiming that Tony is a sore winner, stands up, rolls his eyes and eventually leaves to go find a drink. Not without bending down, and kissing Tony’s cheek. Tony’s so lost in the euphoria of Steve’s kiss that he had failed to notice that Steve had kisses him. In front of their entire crew.
Steve looked at him, playfully slapped his shoulder. “So, how about I try to persuade you to change the date of
The news of his casting was all over Twitter. Fans were exhilarated, others were excited for this project. Tony didn’t think too much about who was going to play his love interest.
Tony brings himself up from the couch and starts to book it to where they are filming the scene. He runs into one of his co-workers.
By the end of the night, it’s all eyes blurry and warmth under his fingertips. Tony doesn’t think about the warmth of Steve’s body near him, he doesn’t think about the glint in Steve’s eye when he speaks. He doesn’t.
. So he made a list. After staring at the paper for a couple of minutes, he finally wrote WHY YOU CAN NOT BE IN LOVE WITH STEVE ROGERS. He proceeded to stare at the paper even longer then got his highlighter to underline the whole sentence.
They somehow manage to find time to sneak off together. By the time they are shooting their last scene for the night, Steve glances at Tony then smiles.  And now Tony’s back to thinking about Steve’s lips on his.
Pepper once again laughs lightly. They didn’t date for too long, but he still cares about her. “Tony, calm down. I’m not mad. Not at either of you.”
, Steve thinks to himself. Basic chemistry, not so much of a secret. But Tony’s smile completely distracts him.
“I actually got you something too, but it’s a little bit unconventional for a gift.” How is Steve always surprising him? He thought he was the only one with the idea of giving a gift today. Now it’s Steve’s turn to reach into his bag while the one hand resting on his thigh moves up to cover Tony’s eyes. He feels something placed into his lap, then Steve’s hand comes off of his face. He sort of missed the weird sense of heat. He looks down at his lap then throws his head back in laughter.
Steve stands up from the ground, “I'll help sneak you out.” They descend  the stairs, past the living room, and make their way to the front door. Tony had got to be the unluckiest person because just as Steve touched the doorknob, Clint Barton entered the house and narrowed his eyes at the sight of Tony. “The fuck are you doing here.” He exclaimed.
Tony groaned. “Steven, I am going to let that shit slide. Now to the important part, you know we do that fucking party everyday single year. We are known for hosting the Beer Olympics
Steve sighs as if it is a burden to have a simple conversation with the president of a fraternity that was only a couple houses down. “Okay, come in.”
After the summer, they had been careful. Only did this when everyone was drunk or at a party. Sleeping with each other while everyone was downstairs, was risky. They had even gone to hotels, just to get off. Now that Tony understood that if they had an excuse to talk in Steve’s bedroom the more, he was definitely going to use it more often.
Tony glared at him. “You know with all the stress you are causing me, I am going to say no and leave now, thank you very much.” He tried to get his hand out of Steve’s embrace.
The next day on set Tony is pouring his coffee when Bucky comes next to him. Bucky takes one look at him and starts. “When you two finally get together, I’m going to be there, and I'm going to say I told you so. There’s something going on between you two, I can see it.”
“Well, you kissing me wasn’t dumb, if anything, I think it was the smartest choice you ever made,” Steve said, moving closer to Tony.
As a crowd began to form at the teacher's desk, Rogers quickly made it back to his seat. “We are doing ‘How to consider authorial intention, historical context, and present relevance,’ how about we split it up? Then send each other the documents to add some notes.”
In the beginning they ate in silence. The tub of ice cream between them. Finally, Steve had the genius idea of making affogato. He left the table abruptly to make a shot of espresso. Tony followed him with the ice cream in his hands.
When Tony heads to the kitchen, he sees some of the fraternity brothers girlfriends handing up a banner at the porch. Thank god for them. They were honestly the true MVP’s, they always helped out at parties. And since most of his fraternity brothers weren’t shit and could barely paint a functioning banner they were saints.
By the time Tony opens his apartment door, Steve has sobered up. Steve decides that the night is not over yet and convinces Tony to watch a movie.
.” God, Tony wanted to slap himself. What was it about Rogers that made him just forget how to act and speak? What was he even saying, it was
“Are we still meeting at the library?” Steve asks as they are leaving the class. Tony nods, when he arrives to the spot, Steve is already starting the project, being very secretive about it. Honestly, Tony is confused about how the professor is not going to get bored by hearing every student talking about the same thing. Their meetings in the library still progress even though they are no longer working together. Now Tony is being the one secretive about his project.
“I am Steve Rogers! I only joined this thing because I thought it would be funny, and I didn’t even win. You’re telling me this guy somehow looks even more than the real deal?”
“Yeah, it’s perfect, thank you,” Steve said, taking a couple of sips before he gave the bottle back. “Everything okay downstairs?” Tony nodded, then realized that Steve had already closed his eyes again.
“Nebula, meet FRIDAY. FRIDAY, meet Nebula.” He pointed at the ceiling, not because that was where FRIDAY was (of course not, no matter what Steve said), but because that was where her voice was coming from. “FRIDAY is an AI, an artificial intelligence. She doesn’t have a body, she’s mostly just a string of code. And she’s my daughter.”
“Don’t worry, it’s okay. I just- I wanted you to know, I guess. That I see you.” Tony swallowed, nodded.
Tony was in the kitchen with Bucky and Morgan when Happy and Peter arrived. Morgan noticed them first, almost screeching when she spotted (one of) her favorite uncle(s). Unfortunately, she was still in Bucky’s arms when they came in, so she started to try and wiggle her way out, which meant that Bucky suddenly found himself in the very rare position of not being the person that Morgan wanted to be with. He set her down carefully, then watched her dash out of the kitchen into Happy’s arms with an odd look on his face.
Bucky was laughing, too. Even he looked younger than he had before, calmer, more settled into himself and in their relationship.
Morgan was sitting on Pepper’s lap, grinning up at her father when they came into the kitchen. There was food, pasta with tomato sauce, easy stuff, but good, filling. Tony pushed Steve into a chair, while Bucky was already filling bowls for them, giving Tony a very shy smile when he passed them over. He put one down in front of Steve, the other one next to him and then went and pulled Natasha into a hug.
“I know. But does it make you happy to see them, to have them here?” She immediately nodded. Which was good. Tony hadn’t been too worried, but it was still good to be sure.
Pepper shook her head. “I don’t really know. I don’t think the doctors know either, at least not all of it. It seems like the stones had- I don’t know, a mind of their own? As if they didn’t want to let you die, maybe.”
“No, that’s not what I’m saying. Stuff like that happens sometimes, it’s nobody’s fault. But you should let me look at it. Or, I mean-“ Now Tony broke off, suddenly unsure. They had been fine, these last couple of weeks, but it was still very much work in progress, and he had no reason to assume that Bucky would be comfortable with him looking at his arm. “I can call Shuri, ask her if she’d-“ But Bucky was already shaking his head.
“It sounds bad when you say it like that.” Steve shrugged, but didn’t step away, didn’t let Tony’s – admittedly rather weak – attempt at diffusing the situation pass. Tony nodded. “Yeah. She knows that I kiss other people.” He refused to feel guilty about that, even though he knew that it would hurt, if Steve judged him for it.
“Do you think talking to Clint might help?” Tony asked Steve on one of the bad days. They had both spent some time with him this morning, but eventually he had asked to be left alone. Steve hated it, hated feeling helpless.
“You should come to bed.” Bucky glanced back to the closed door of his own room, but Tony shook his head.
“Yeah. It’s pretty normal, to be honest, just as being gay, or bi, or poly. So yeah, you don’t have to have sex, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be in a relationship, if that’s a thing you’d like.”
“Oh hey, no. No, that wasn’t the one implanted in my chest, I took it out years before that happened. It’s fine.”
“It’s not about that. It’s that-“ He hesitated. “She’s hiding who she really is, because her family doesn’t accept her, doesn’t even like her. But with a little help from her Fairy Godmother she can transform into who she really is, who she was always meant to be. And- I don’t know, I just think that’s really beautiful. Sure, she’s a very passive character and stuff, but still… I mean, it’s a fairy tale, so…” He broke off, blushing more obviously now. Tony smiled at him.
“So, not that I’m not happy to be here, but- how? I know Rhodey said something about Dr. Cho last night, but I- I should be-,” he broke off, not wanting to finish that sentence, not ever and definitely not when Morgan was sitting on his lap, hopping around and singing a quiet song to herself.
“I need- I think I need to think about this some more. But- yeah, I- I think that might be me.” He looked relieved and Tony could definitely relate.
Maybe it had helped, that one of those other people was Rhodey. Because she knew Rhodey, trusted him, loved him even, if not exactly the same way Tony did. Rhodey and him, they weren’t meant to be together, not with the way their lives were, but they always found each other again. Tony was curious to see how it would continue, now, with Carol in the picture. Not that Rhodey admitted anything. But either way, it had time.
“Thank you, Tony. Really, I-“ But Tony only shook his head, taking the body wash and a washcloth in hand. They could talk later, they could even apologize again later, but right now he just wanted to enjoy the moment.
“Hey, are you staying the night?” He glanced at Pepper who was watching them with a soft look on her face. “Stay with us?” Rhodey nodded.
Nebula was very fascinated by the videogames that Peter and Morgan played. She was definitely interested in the colorful games that Morgan favored. Her favorite game at the moment was Plants vs. Zombies, which struck Tony as weird, but the game was fun, pretty light-hearted (for a shooter about plants and- well, zombies) and she could play it with Peter or somebody else, which was perfect.
“Good morning,” she said, handing him the coffee as soon as he was upright. “How are you feeling?” He wondered if she knew, if Steve had been in contact with her before coming here.
Pepper and Natasha had retreated to one of the guestrooms, which meant that Tony brought Steve into the master bedroom. Which was good, because that was the room with the biggest and best set up connected bathroom.
Steve pulled them into his room, laughing and smiling. He looked so young and happy here, with Tony and Bucky. It was almost surprising in a way, to see him so happy. After everything that had happened, after all these years. To think that they could have this was.
When Morgan finally fell asleep, Nebula stayed next to her bed for a moment, before she turned her head and looked at Tony. She got up and joined him.
“Don’t ask me to choose between my children, that’s not fair.” Rhodey called him a coward, but Peter and Nebula definitely seemed very happy with his announcement, so Tony counted that as a win. It was weird, being the center of their little universe, but this was also the happiest Tony had ever been, so Tony was definitely not complaining. It was perfect, being here, surrounded by his family.
Now that Tony knew what he was looking for, it was easy to see. Steve’s love for Bucky was obvious, but it didn’t take long for him to see Bucky’s love for Steve as well. It might have been different, somehow, but it was there. He wasn’t really sure if what Bucky felt was romantic love, which was also because Bucky didn’t seem to know. Tony noticed that Steve was not the only one being watched by Bucky, he himself was too. He wasn’t sure if that was because he was currently (sometimes) sharing Steve’s bed and if what Bucky felt was jealousy, or if Bucky wanted them both, wanted to join them. Or if it was neither, if he didn’t even love Steve that way, although Tony was pretty sure that was not it.
“We don’t trade lives,” he whispered, almost choking on the words. He knew that Steve had said that, to Vision, years ago. He also knew it hadn’t mattered, in the end. The only link that he might have still had to JARVIS had been dead, destroyed.
Steve definitely looked happy when they made their way back downstairs, half an hour later. Both Bucky and Tony were wearing his shirts, which meant that Steve was having a hard time keeping his hands off them. Well, it wasn’t as if either of them was complaining.
“So, can I ask you a question? And please feel free to punch me in the face or something if it’s inappropriate.” Peter grinned.
This is the last one!! It's for A4 "Cinderella Story" on my TSB, which means that I now have a blackout card!! Yay ^^
“I don’t want to have sex.” Bucky wasn’t looking at either of them, instead he was staring at his own hand, the one not in Tony’s lap.
“Steve, let me go,” he said with a grin, not trying to get Steve to let go at all. “I need to get clothes, mine are all wet thanks to you.” Steve shook his head, still smiling.
It was weird, the way their relationship changed now that Bucky had joined them. And at the same time, it didn’t really change at all. Bucky still only slept with them during the nights they didn’t have sex. He sometimes joined later, but not often and Tony had the feeling that it did indeed make him uncomfortable. But at the same time, it seemed as if knowing what was going on, having a word for how he felt had helped Bucky a lot. He was calmer, more open with them. He wasn’t the biggest fan of kissing just for the sake of kissing, but he loved snuggling up to them in bed or on the couch and he was definitely in favor of forehead and cheek kisses. Which was very cute. And also a great way to make both Steve and Tony blush, for some reason.
It was Bucky who spoke first, after a while: “Of course I forgive you, it wasn’t-“ He broke off, shook his head. “I’d like to be friends,” he said then, a small smile on his lips. “Steve speaks very highly of you, always did and I- I’d like to get to know you.” Tony smiled.
“I’m not asking you to validate me, or to be my moral compass.” He grinned. “I just… I can do so much more, so much better, when I know you believe in me. I’m not good, on my own, never was. I always had Bucky, and when I didn’t I- well, you know how the story goes.” He hesitated, took a step closer. After a moment, he reached out and took Tony’s hand in his. “I love you, Tony Stark. You make me want to be better and I’m always gonna be thankful for that. Thankful that I can share this with you, whatever it is, whatever it will be.”
“Maybe. But you can and you deserve good things. Just as FRIDAY deserves to be loved. Just because she has no body, doesn’t mean she’s not my daughter. I made her. Also, she’s very much alive.”
“We’ll talk about it, okay? When I come back.” Tony nodded. If, he thought to himself, but didn’t say it. For now, they still had time.
“I’m honored to call you my daughter,” he answered, hoping that the answer was somehow good enough. Hoping that he could live up to his own expectations (and hers, although that might not be so hard, seeing as she had no positive experience).
“How are you feeling, Tones,” Rhodey asked, as he sat down next to him. Tony smiled at him, suddenly desperately grateful to be here, with his family.
“Yeah. Although you can definitely call me Tony by now.” He grinned. It was good to hear the kid’s voice. “Am I calling at a bad time? How are you?”
Tony swallowed, feeling suddenly small and vulnerable and big and indestructible at the same time. He took a step towards Steve, kissed him, lightly.
“Fuck,” he whispered. Steve looked- almost worse than he had after the battle with Thanos, but he was alive. He was here. Before he even knew what was happening, he too was running over to the car.
Steve looked at him with worry. “You sure you're not going to get pissy if it’s something that I choose?”
Tony came every week, the days he would come would vary. But somehow he always made it during Steve’s shifts.
“I actually wanted to talk to you about something.” Shit. Now Tony is processing what Steve could talk to him about. Tony hadn’t even done anything all week. He’d been cooped up in the lab. “Have you been checking your emails?” What an odd question to ask. Tony thinks about the last time he even checked it. Steve continues, “obviously, by the look of your face I know it wasn’t any time recently.”
. Very impressive, this costume definitely would have given me nightmares when I was younger,” Tony said as he moved closer to where Nat and Pepper were standing. As soon as Tony got closer, Pepper started speaking. “Nat’s dating a guy from your sworn rival frat, do whatever you want with that information!” She quickly left and ran.
Steve puts his head in his hands as Tony deals with the shock. Bucky laughs. “God, don’t fall for his little innocent act, the stories I have.”
Tony walked into the library and immediately headed to the third floor. Steve had already mentioned where he would be waiting. He goes straight to the corner where it is surrounded by shelves and sees him. Tony walks up to Steve’s table.
“So, since I’m obviously a noteworthy customer to get my order memorized, how about you tell me what’s in your coffee,” he says leaning with his elbows on the counter. It had been a busy morning crowd today but now, midday it was quiet.
“Okay. Stop with the suspense. Tell me who it is. C'mon, tell me!” He pleads while Nat continues to stand there with her arms crossed at her front. “Nat, as long as it’s not their president, it’s fine.” Oh shit. That’s why she’s not telling him. The guy that is from a movie is Rogers. Oh. His inner dialogue suddenly cuts off when Nat speaks.
“Tony, you really didn’t have to,” Steve says, but still moves closer to Tony to get a peak. Tony drops the poorly wrapped gift in front of Steve.
The next occupant to the seat next to him is Bucky Barnes. “Is this when I give you the shovel talk?”
Steve continues. “Now how’s this translate, way back in the day, coffee sucked, the water was better but the coffee was worse,” Steve says it again casually. Tony’s prepared to fight for coffee's honour but decides not to. “People in the navy back in the day used to make their coffee fast better by adding salt. That’s because salt was super cheap and very efficient to make bad coffee just taste a little bit better.”
“Yeah, you two are all everyone was talking about when you hated each other, then when you started to get along. Then the whole crew started talking about you two when you guys were pining.”
“It means you stole my parking spot,” Tony says, poking Steve’s shoulder. “And you did this before eight am on a Thursday.”
“What exactly are you winning, Steve?” Shit, shit, shit. It’s only Steve in his brain, not with his mouth.
Steve knew what he was doing. It was a full house today, seats were filled. A recent development was Tony staying and chatting with Steve. If Steve was on break, he stayed to talk with him. Steve noticed that Tony had already chosen a seat.
Tony shrugs, he is as confused as Bucky now. Bucky throws his hands in the air. “Just imagine, I’m saying something about breaking Steve’s heart, or how I’ll have assassins sent after you.”
His audition had gone perfect. He was Tony Stark after all, always striving for perfection. He smiles at the team made of producers, writers and casting directors. He notes in his head that some are staring at him with shock mixed with awe.
He pushes through the rest of the month if he doesn’t think about the feeling he felt they won’t catch up to him. It’s what he always had done. He was too busy to process anything in his life. When his parents would get into screaming matches, when Howard would leave for business trips for months, he would just focus on his AP courses instead. As long as he directed his energy elsewhere, everything would be fine. That’s what he is going to do now.
It was a normal spot that Tony just likes to park, it didn't have the word STARK on it. But it had been his normal parking spot. He sees the person get out of his spot and Tony’s head turns so fast to get a look at the person who has occupied it. What he wasn’t expecting was to see an extremely attractive person step out of the driver’s seat like it's a slow-mo introductory scene.
Steve takes Tony’s hand and interlocks their hands together. “Oh. I thought we were already dating. My bad. Tony Stark, will you be my boyfriend?”
He had been walking past the bookstore when he saw the poster. He hadn’t even thought it through, Tony immediately bought the poster.
They continue working on their new project. “How to analyze Shakespeare’s plays on the page and in performance.”
He got to class on Wednesday earlier than Rogers which was a first. He took his place and waited. When Rogers finally showed up, he was obviously coming from a workout. Objectively, Tony knew Steve was hot. But the shirt he was wearing was working for his body, it was tight and showed off his muscles. Tony was interrupted from his thoughts when Steve rushed into the seat next to him.
Opposite to the first time. For the last time, they have to choose a project Tony goes up and selects one for them. He quickly signs their name to Analyze Macbeth through knowledge of historical context. Tony had studied all about Macbeth in high school, it actually was his favourite Shakespeare play.
Phil walks over to where the stage lights are flashed on them, with their limbs entangled, the scene they just filmed was the one where their characters had slept together for the first time. Steve was shirtless as was Tony. They both took a minute to catch their breaths. Phil claps his hands, “That was incredible, the chemistry was amazing, it’s going to look great on the screen.”
Tony takes a sip of his coffee. “Hey, did I ever tell you? That this,” he gestures widely to the coffee, “is the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had.”
Shit, he realizes. He likes Steve. And now he has to kiss Steve, again. He’s going to have to act like it doesn’t faze him. Maybe Tony was right, he was going to die from filming a Romantic Comedy.
“This is like history in the making,” Tony says, looking at Steve. “I should take a picture of you taking a selfie, get some proof of this breaking news development—”
Tony smiles at him. They had established some sort of friendship as they were filming. It’s always great to get along with his cast mates but not always a reality.
Tony realized that Steve hadn’t gotten off yet. “Fuck, wait, let me.” As he saw Steve’s left hand rubbing desperately through his worn-in sweats. Tony pulled out of Steve’s mouth and joined him on the ground. He shoved Steve until his back hit the ground, he pulled off his sweats followed by his boxers and sucked him down in one move. Tony saw Steve was about to come and suddenly remembered that they were not alone, what if Steve’s housemates heard them? He quickly pulled Steve’s hand and curled it into a fist and brought it to Steve’s mouth. Luckily, Steve got the idea and bit his fist as he came. Tony swallowed everything and saw Steve’s expression all soft and rested.
Nat swiftly moved her beer from one hand to the other and brought one of her hands to pat Tony’s back. “Honestly, if you think about it, this is your rivalry there is no reason for me to hate them too “
Tony is seriously contemplating if this is real life. He had been in his lab for too many long hours, that they had blended in together as one. “Thank you for your service, I shall repay you by naming my firstborn after you.”
Tony turned to him. “Will you tell me the secret recipe if I do something dumb?” This was becoming their inside joke, Tony asking for the recipe then Steve declining. This one was new though. Something dumb? Steve didn’t know if this was a trick question or not. He nodded slowly.
Tony had already agreed to letting Steve sleep on his couch after this night ended. As he finally gets Steve standing, and hands him his jacket. He hears Natasha come up from behind them.
It’s endearing how much Steve is trying. He puts his hands on Steve’s hips. “Watch me. You have to loosen up your hips.” Steve being tense under Tony’s touch is certainly not helping. “Stop being so tense.”
. When Steve swears and takes his phone out of the bag quickly. Tony takes his eyes off the book he was reading. He studies Steve's face and notices he is visibly paling, he asks. “Are you okay?”
Rhodey just raised an eyebrow. That’s all it took for Tony to understand. “Please tell me he is just a random member and not a very crucial and important part of the frat.”
Tony’s a professional. No, he is professional. And yet, every time he looks at Steve, he remembers the feeling. The feeling of his lips on Tony’s.
“A couple of guys from Phi Delta Theta are at our front door, they’re saying that they brought booze.”
They form a pattern, every day, after they finish on set. They eat together. Tony doesn’t know if he can call it dinner, since usually they eat really late in the night. They do it so often that one glance from Steve then Tony knows he is indicating that he wants to head out.
“We can push for a PR stunt, say you two met on set, then go through with dating through the press tours.”
“I know that if this party was thrown at our house, I would be furious if nobody helped around.” He looked around the room, and Tony noticed that nobody had stuck around to help. Not even his brothers. Now that hurts. He would be yelling at them tomorrow. Tony made a list of his options. HOW TO CLEAN YOUR HOUSE @ 4 AM ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.
On the drive back to Tony’s apartment, they stop for some ice cream. Steve makes a face when he kisses Tony and realizes that he can taste the mint chocolate chip Tony had ate. Tony tells him that he’s not complaining about Steve’s pictashio so Steve doesn’t have the right to argue anyways. But Tony doesn’t think he won this disagreement since Steve makes Tony brush his teeth before he kisses him again. But is he really losing when he gets Steve’s kisses?
“It’s actually really ridiculous how this rivalry is still going on. It’s a natural thing, that where fraternities are there are fraternity rivalries. Sometimes the rivalry is justified, but a brother getting punched in the face is not something to shrug off. Also not easy to justify a rivalry when the first punch was thrown in 1948. After the president of your fraternity shouted to our president something about his mom. The details are a little hazy.”
“That absolute son of a bitch.” Tony started as he sat on the couch in the living room. “Not only are they hosting a party the same day as us, now they're doing the same theme as us?”
“Okay, that’s fair.” Tony looks down at the book of poetry they are currently meant to be analyzing. But every time he reads the same sentence over and over again, not retaining any of the information. “I don’t think the humanities are useless, I’m not going to just think lowly of someone if they're a liberal arts major. What even is your major?” Tony asks but he has an inkling he knows what Rogers is majoring in, the paint on all his clothes is a dead giveaway. Not to mention the leftover paint smudges on his hands and face. Sometimes he would see a smudge of paint on his arm. He would want to go over it with his own fingers. He shook those thoughts out of his head.
Unfortunately for Tony, this guy was leaving, not to mention with another guy. Although that part could easily be understood, a brother, maybe a cousin, could be a roommate. So, Tony was in a sour mood. He wanted to be the one to leave with that Greek god lookalike. Weirdly, Rhodey glared at these two boys, as if they offended his bloodline. Tony wondered why as he pushed through the crowd. Tony admitted defeat, he would never see Greek god again. This guy was straight up an Apollo look-alike. This guy was honestly the Greek god of sun, light, and music.
“Nooo,” Tony whines. “Why don’t you drink coffee, is it because it surrounds you all day? Or maybe you have a bad experience with it.” Tony rambles all the different possibilities of what could possibly be the reason Steve no longer drinks it.
Steve smiles at him under the yellow library light across the table where all their books are spread out. “My first impression of you was that you were a—what did you call it? A trust fund baby?”
Bucky gives him the finger then reaches out of his pocket to give Steve the house key. “Don’t come home too late,” he says, leaving the room as fast as he entered.
“Ah, yes. The day we disagreed over coffee. Truly a momentous day for us,” Steve says as he gets under the covers.
“Nat, how do you even know this?” It’s safe to say, Tony is shocked. The longest relationship he had was probably with the bottle of ketchup in the fridge, it has been in there for months.
As the conversation carries on, Steve finds him lost in a world with just him and Tony. Tony laughs when he finds out that Steve isn’t a coffee drinker.
Tony checks his google alerts and sure enough an article has areas been published. The article talks about how they are starring in a new film together, and how witnesses had overheard their conversation that to them sounded like they were friendly.
Tony finally decides he has had enough with the glares Steve is sending him. “There is no good reason why we can’t sit here together and work on this project.”
Tony makes his way to the set and sees the pot of coffee sitting on the lone desk. He makes his way over there, Pepper, Bucky and Natasha were all surrounding the coffee. Bucky and Nat had just recently been casted in the movie. Fans were excited since Bucky and Nat had already filmed two other movies together and had a massive outreach of fans thinking they were dating. It’s been a couple of days of being near them and Tony hasn’t got a clue if they are dating or if their bond is really close from all those movies they had filmed together.
It’s basically a bisexual’s birthright to make lists. At least, Tony always made lists, mostly in his head. All the important lists get written down in his notebook. Tony knew he was in deep shit now that he was going to make this list. He needed to focus more in class. Instead, all Tony could do was think about
Mostly the conversation went with the customer saying the coffee was good, Steve thanking them, and done. Customer service was truly a gift. That’s when the unexpected happens, when one customer asks how Steve made it.
It’s not until later, when they are sitting at a Thai restaurant that Steve had swore was the best Thai experience he had, Tony remembers Pepper pulling Steve away.
Although, Steve makes a sacrifice in the really hot summer months. They just woke up to the morning sun shining on them. The blanket has already been kicked off of Tony.
, Tony, reminded himself. He was not going to allow himself to dwell on how Steve looked wearing his clothes.
Now it’s Nat’s turn to look at him with her mouth wide open. “You two went to high school together?”
Now it was Tony’s turn to groan and cover his face with his own hands. “Why does this happen to me? I swear I used to have the best luck. Now it feels like everything’s going wrong.” Rhodey comfortingly pats his back.
“Shut up and listen to how great this guy is. It's like he is from a movie.” She explains how great this new guy is. Honestly Tony is happy for her. Nat scares the shit out of him. So, knowing her, she is probably dating a guy that would scare the shit out of Tony.
When he hears the, “Steve! When you’re here, the coffee tastes better, why is that?” The answer is salt. Adding salt improves the water quality. Many coffee shops use reverse osmosis filters, which are too clean. If your water is too clean, your coffee is going to be acidic and bitter. The addition of salt neutralizes the bitterness.
When he told Steve the story of the parking lost fiasco, all Steve had one was raise his eyebrow. His only focus seemed to be that he had finally found the reason why Tony was glaring at this cup of coffee the entire time.
Steve looked between them. “It’s fine, Clint. We just had a very adult, civilized, mature conversation about the coincidence of our party’s falling on the same day.”
He and Steve head to the library for one last time. They drop off the books they had signed out and head to Steve’s corner area. They sit there in the excitement that is that they finished their project. All the nerves and stress leaving his body slowly.
The guy who was smiling ever so gleefully after winning first place looks over to the pair arguing. Tony hears the first place guy talking to Steve, obviously not believing that it’s actually him. Tony makes his way over to the stage. When Steve has suggested this instead of going to their normal Thai restaurant, Tony was apprehensive. Nice to know that Tony was correct in the end. He holds onto Steve’s arm while apologizing to the host. Tony manages to drag Steve away from the crowd.
He stood there for a while, in the dark. Not really thinking about anything, just feeling. Eventually he went inside. They had cleared the table together, but the dished were still in the sink, waiting to be washed. He hesitated, stared at them for a moment and then decided that he didn’t have the energy to do them now. And besides, he wanted the reminder. To know It was real, even if it could only ever be one date. To know that Steve had been here, that they had laughed about Morgan being a sneaky little kid, finding ways to get ice cream in the middle of the night. To know that they had sat on the couch, making out, soft and unhurried. If Steve didn’t come back, he wanted, he needed those memories. If they were all he could have.
“Wakanda lost warriors and we’ve got a couple of nasty injuries, but yeah, everyone made it. You stopped them before they could do too much damages, before they could really hurt us.”
“Hey, can I let you soak here for a moment while I go check on Morgan?” he asked after a moment. He was pretty sure Steve wasn’t going to drown, with his head on the little pillow, stretched out in the big tub. Steve gave him a soft and lazy smile.
Waking was- surprising. He woke up slowly, like drifting through mist or sirup or- something. He was kind of confused, if he is being perfectly honest. Confused about his own metaphor, a bit, but mainly confused by the fact that he was, well, waking up. That was not something he’d expected to do, after all. After Thanos, after the battle, after the gauntlet. It worked, it must have worked, because he didn’t know what he’d do if it didn’t. But if it did work, then he should be dead. So, why was he waking up?
“Daddy! We’re baking, daddy,” Morgan said, before she ran over to him, demanding to be picked up. He was sure he was gonna end up with frosting on his clothes but eh, whatever.
“I don’t know, maybe. But maybe I don’t want to, anymore. Be without you, I mean. I- I’d like it if we could be friends, if that’s something you might be interested in.” His smile was still soft, but also a little insecure, a little hopeful, as if he couldn’t be sure what the answer would be. “I’m sorry, you know. About-,” he broke off, shook his head. “I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“Oh my God, you’re a cyborg!” he exclaimed, before slapping a hand in front of his mouth and staring at them with wide, almost scared eyes. Tony laughed; Nebula mostly looked confused.
“Morgan,” he said, or tried to. It didn’t really sound like anything, but it was enough to get Rhodey’s attention, who moved and thus woke Morgan.
“Uncle Bucky, yes,” he said, tickling her for a moment, before he let her go. She didn’t move. Not even when Tony was awake, looking at her.
“It’s not natural, is it? To not want- I can’t, just the thought of it makes me-“ He shuddered. Fuck, had they pushed him? Of course, Bucky wouldn’t join them, even after, if he knew, if that was how he felt.
. But Steve didn’t seem to mind, he was smiling a lot, laughing about Morgan’s shenanigans. They also talked about Steve’s experience leading group therapy, about how those people were doing now, with loved ones back. It was hard, still, because many people had moved on, eventually and now people were suddenly back. They didn’t dwell too long on difficult memories and hard times, because this was a date after all, and they wanted to have a good time.
“Yeah, me too. But you know, I think we’re allowed to feel old by now. The kids are alright.” Tony laughed.
Peter and Tony spent almost the entire Saturday working on the suit. They used the opportunity to work on other aspects as well, but mostly they tried to find a way of making the suit as safe as it could possibly be for Peter. It was weird, somehow, spending hours and hours working on a suit that could mean so much. It reminded Tony very much of the time that he first invented the Iron Man suit. Not in the cave, that had always been little more than a crude prototype. No, the first suits that he built in Malibu, even before Stane’s betrayal. For a while, he’d seen his salvation in these suits, the only way to atone for all the things he’d done wrong. It had taken him years (as well as losing a kid and then having a baby just months later) to understand, that his way to salvation had never been the suits.
“Oh my god!” By now, both Bucky and Sam had the most shit-eating grins on their faces, Morgan was demanding to know what was going on (which Pepper answered with “they’re just being bad at communicating, sweetie”; thanks Pepper).
“Okay, so you know how I say Peter is my kid, even though he’s not my biological son? Not the way Morgan is my daughter.” She nodded.
“No, I- I didn’t expect-“ He broke off, started again. “I transitioned a couple of years ago, have been on T for a while now, so- no, definitely he/him pronouns. I just- I just wanted to tell you, I guess.”
“I mean, yeah. But- I can’t not wear it. It makes me feel really dysphoric, which means that I’d be basically useless. I can’t concentrate on saving people if all I can think about is how bad I feel, how much I want to be different, to be- well, it wouldn’t work. So it’s not like I really have a choice, to be honest.” Tony looked at him, the way he clearly felt uncomfortable with the mere thought of being Spiderman without his binder. That wouldn’t work, of course.
“Oh. Oh, okay. Thank you!” Peter nodded. He still looked a bit surprised, as if he had expected another reaction. Was there anything that Tony was supposed to say? Peter was still kinda staring at him, so in the end Tony just decided to ask. “Peter, is there anything else you need me to say? Or do? I- I’m not sure what the protocol is here, to be honest.”
“I’m here. I- I have to ask aunt May. I mean, she probably won’t mind, I don’t think, since it’s Friday and- did you, is it okay if I come- I could come another time.” Tony laughed, couldn’t help himself.
“He always was. His sisters adored him. Well, we all did, I guess.” Tony was watching him, so it wasn’t hard to catch the wistful look on his face. It wasn’t the first time, either.
Steve was sitting on the porch, watching Bucky and Morgan play by the lake, as sad little smile in his face.
Silence. For a moment, Tony wasn’t sure if Peter had hung up on him, because there was absolutely no reaction. Then:
It took a couple of days, but eventually the doctors decided that yes, he was indeed recovering well. Not that they could tell him what happened, or why he survived, when it had almost cost Bruce’s (or Hulk’s?) arm. But he did, he was fine, for once. Various pains and aches had disappeared – or not yet reappeared, which was just as well. So eventually, they had to let him go home. Home to a place that he didn’t think he’d ever see again. Home to his house and lake and his family. Rhodey was coming with them, because how could he not? Tony knew that he wouldn’t stay for too long, with everything going on right now. They had just brought back half the population of earth, after all. There was still a lot of work to be done, but- not for him. Not this time. All he wanted to do was go home, sit by the lake with a cup of coffee or tea (Pepper had gotten him into the habit, and he had to admit that it could be soothing, sometimes) and just do nothing. Watch his kid play, kiss his wife, maybe kiss Rhodey some too, and just
“I’ll see what I can find,” he said and then left the bathroom. Steve’s clothes were all over the bedroom floor and probably needed to be burned. Or at least washed, but there was no way he was gonna be able to wear those again anytime soon. Tony added searching for clothes to his mental to do list and then went to look for his daughter.
“Goodbye? Why would he- Is he not coming back?” Tony took a sip of coffee, leaned back against the headboard and held out a hand for her.
“I’m not. Sore and beat up, but not- not injured, I promise. Worst there is are a couple of broken ribs and you know how fast they heal.” Tony stared at him, the bruises on his face.
“You’re not joining them either,” Bucky said after a while. It wasn’t a question, but the way he said it didn’t make Tony feel judged. It was, well mostly an observation. A correct one, too.
“The betrayal!” he cried, watching his daughter and Bucky get comfortable. Steve snorted next to him.
“Okay, so we’re definitely not deciding anything right now and you take as much time as you need. I can give you stuff to read, if you’d like.” Bucky nodded.
And maybe it was just because Tony was paying attention now, but he started to look too. He’d been looking at Steve for years now, almost a decade even. But Bucky was new, obviously, but not any less intriguing. He was calm, almost shyly so, but also incredibly kind. Not only was he amazing with Morgan, patient and always willing to listen to her, without ever treating her like- well, he never really treated her like she was anything less than a tiny human being that needed help sometimes but was otherwise just as intelligent, just as valid as anybody else.
It had taken them a while, Pepper and him, to work out what kind of relationship they needed. After everything that happened, after Thanos wiped out half the population of earth and they had miraculously both made it, they had both needed some time to realize what they really wanted, really needed. Tony had always preferred open relationships and it had been hard for Pepper sometimes, to understand that the fact that he loved other people too, didn’t mean that he loved her any less. She did love other people, too, or had loved them when Tony and her hadn’t been together. But in the end, it didn’t mean than she stopped loving Tony, just because they weren’t together at some point. Just like she never really stopped loving some other people.
“What is it, then?” Tony asked. He knew he shouldn’t push, but Bucky was clearly hurting and that was not okay. He was not willing to watch the people he loved being in pain, not anymore. Not if there was anything he could do to change it.
It did fit. Dinner was easy, conversation flowing, and the food was good. They were talking about things they’ve done during the last couple of years. Tony mostly talked about his daughter, because yeah, he was a
“Please dad, it’s gonna be fun. Steve is going to help me build a castle.” Tony wasn’t too sure how they planned on doing that, since the beach of the lake wasn’t sand, but that didn’t really matter.
“Steve, I was angry with you, because you didn’t tell me. That was not okay, and it sucked, yes. But I was never angry at Bucky, not really. I know it’s not his fault, I’ve always known that. Jesus, what- did you think I hated him?”
“Look, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that, I know- well no, I don’t know, but I still shouldn’t have-“
Clint found them later, when Bucky and Tony had fled outside to the relative calm of the porch. He had two cups with him, one of them he passed to Bucky.
“In self-defense. You didn’t try to kill me, because if you would have, I’d be dead. Steve- Steve didn’t hold back.”
“Are you stealing my husband, Colonel Rhodes?” Pepper called, just before they could hear Morgan leave the house and run over towards them. Rhodey grinned against his lips and kissed him some more.
Tony had never heard Bucky raise his voice, and he didn’t now, not really. But he did sound very determined, as if it was important for Tony to understand, as if this was something that he would not change his mind about.
Hi! I'm still here. Sorry for the delay, I was in Paris last week and I kinda couldn't find the time to post... You'll get two chapters today and then we're back with the usual one chapter per day from tomorrow on. Happy reading :)
“Tony, you’re married,” Steve said, as if that was the most important thing. But then again, maybe it was. Although Tony had always been very open about the kind of relationship they had, he had thought Steve knew.
“I’m sure we’ll find something to do. Morgan wanted to go show me a movie, I think. Something about a princess and a frog, maybe?” Tony laughed. They were gonna be alright.
“Okay, cool. Did she behave for you?” Wilson nodded, apparently not surprised by the easy acceptance.
And a special shout-out to  professionaldumbass who's been rooting for that story from the very beginning and also just for being the amazing friend and wonderful person that they are!
“He brought Natasha back.” There was a clatter on the other side, then silence. Tony waited and it only took a moment for Clint to be back.
“You’re welcome,” he said, before leaning down for a soft kiss. “I’ll be back soon, okay. I’ll bring you something to drink, are you hungry?” He seemed to consider that for a moment.
“Yeah. I’m good. I just- I just realized how happy I am, how lucky.” He smiled at his daughter, but he also reached out with one hand towards Steve and the other one towards Bucky.
“Hey. Hey, no it’s okay, you don’t have to if you don’t want.” But Bucky was already shaking his head.
“The princess is busy, more than enough. Can you… I wouldn’t mind you looking at it. I mean… I trust you.”
“Doesn’t work when I’m feeling- well, safe.” That worked very well in preventing any further teasing from both Rhodey and Tony (mostly because Tony was trying very hard not to cry, which meant that Rhodey would definitely concentrate any teasing on him).
It was still hard to believe, some days, that he might deserve this. That he actually might be able to keep it, too. Happiness was something he hadn’t really known for so long, not the way he was happy now. All the second and third chances, all the missed opportunities. All the ways he had fallen in love with people and people had fallen in love with him. To be here, with his family, after all these years was more than he’d have ever dreamed of. And he definitely planned on never letting this go. No one could take his family away from him.
They all had dinner together and while Peter seemed a bit star struck by all the superheros sitting at the table. But Pepper and Steve didn’t have any problem to include him in their conversation and the rest was taken care of by Morgan, who was delighted to make a new friend. Tony really needed to make sure that she saw Barton’s kids more often, right now she was mostly in the company of adults. Which she didn’t seem to mind, but it would be good for her to have friends in her own age range as well.
“We kissed,” he added, because this was important. “We- had a date, in a way, made dinner together and- well, made out on the couch, for a bit.” He took another sip of coffee. He knew that Pepper would understand what he meant, what had happened.
Steve was still laying in the tub when Tony came back, eyes closed, small smile on his face. Tony was balancing a couple of bottles, a plate and some cupcakes in his hands, rolling his eyes when Steve looked at him and grinned.
“I’m fine. Swimming with the arm can be pretty tiring and I don’t mind staying with you. They’re having fun.”
Tony smiled, even though he was sure that Nebula could read the sadness in his eyes. She deserved so much more.
Of course, just when he was beginning to feel better, a car drove up to the lake. It wasn’t one he knew, not the one Steve had come in, so he wasn’t very hopeful. That didn’t change that fact that he went outside as soon as he heard it, of course, and if it only was because Morgan was playing outside. Sure, Pepper was with her, but one could never be careful enough. Ugh, or maybe he just wanted to see who it was.
Tony went through his bedtime routine as a way of finding his way back from work mode. When he emerged, Pepper was already in bed, but clearly waiting for him.
“Yeah, they’re baking cupcakes, which is a great way to occupy Morgan.” He hesitated, then added: “I talked to Bucky.”
“Okay, so- just to make sure we understand you correctly. You don’t want to have sex. Just with us or in general?”
“Steve. I’m the best example of how loving more than one person works out perfectly fine. What on earth made you think I wouldn’t be okay with that?” Steve blushed, ducked his head.
“Careful, Morgan, your daddy’s only just woke up.” Then he looked at Tony, eyes bright and shiny. “Hey Tones. How do you feel?”
“I can see that, pumpkin.” He looked at the two men standing in his kitchen, both wearing a sheepish expression. Barnes had ducked out of the way, away from Morgan, as soon as Tony had entered the kitchen. That was something they would need to talk about, because he had seemed to be enjoying himself and Tony didn’t want him to stop doing so, just because of some misguided guilt.
“We-“ That sounded too good to be true. Maybe he was dead after all, and maybe there was such a thing like heaven. “Everyone?” he asked, because if this was heaven, then he had no reason to be afraid of the answer. But Rhodey nodded, still smiling.
“Oh come on, you were doing just fine without me,” Tony said, no heat behind those words. He meant it, Steve had been doing good, or at least he had thought so. More shrugging.
“You did it,” Rhodey said, smiling. It was a nice smile, all big and relieved and honest. “We made it.” He laughed, as if he couldn’t really believe it. “We actually made it.”
“Hey Tony, what’s up?” Tony could hear children yelling in the background and he grinned. Parenthood was awesome.
“I- did I say something wrong? I’m not sure, I-“ But Peter was already shaking his (her? Their?) head.
Steve had pushed him into a chair with another glass of juice, telling him to look for some calm background music they could listen to during dinner. Usually Tony let FRIDAY chose the music, but now he spent a moment to scroll through spotify. There were a couple if “dinner playlists” with helpful titles like “Feel Good Dinner”, “Wine & Dine” or “Classical Intimate Dinner”, but all of those didn’t really feel right. He scrolled though a couple of his own favorites, briefly contemplating Aerosmith and finally settling on Eric Clapton. He was trying to decide between ‘Unplugged’ and ‘Riding with the King’. On one hand, Tears in Heaven might not be the best choice right now, but the rest of the album was amazing (scratch that, Tears in Heaven was amazing as well, just kinda sad, too). On the other hand, ‘Riding with the King’ was a bid groovier, which might work well. Also, the songs weren’t always interrupted by clapping. He could always switch to something else if it didn’t fit.
Clint and Natasha were clutching at each other, desperately, whispering to each other in Russian about god knows what. Probably insults, the way Natasha’s laugh sounded, all wet and relieved.
“Not necessary. I mean, it could be trauma, of course, but it doesn’t have to be. Did you- did you like sex before?” Bucky stared at him.
After that, Bucky found his way into Steve’s bed more often. Tony knew he sometimes slept there when Tony wasn’t there as well, which was probably good. Neither Steve nor Bucky slept well alone, and they tended to have less nightmares if they could cuddle up to each other (or to Tony, which for some reason both of them seemed to prefer).
“That’s kinda how an open relationship works, yes. We talk about it. We have rules and stuff that we do to make sure our relationship works, to make sure Morgan is safe. We don’t have sex with other people without telling each other first, but other than that… yeah, she’s okay with me kissing other people.”
By the time that Tony tried to follow Peter’s conversation with Nebula again, the boy was talking about the New Wave science fiction movement of the 60s and 70s, before moving on to an ode on to Blade Runner. Which yeah, Tony had to admit, was not only a very important movie for the whole cyperpunk genre, but a really good one, too. Steve and Bucky might enjoy that one, even though it did have some dark themes. Ah well, movie night (without Morgan) would come soon enough.
So yeah, it was good. The only one (apart from Peter, who he hadn’t seen yet) who still worried Tony was Bucky. He didn’t really seem to find a place that he could call home. Both he and Sam spent time at the house, even when Sam got sucked into his new duty more and more. Bucky followed him on missions, but he often came to see Steve on his own as well. It was kinda heartbreaking, the way he was still hesitating at the door step, as if he expected to be thrown out every time. Tony made a point to include him as much as he could, passing Morgan to him whenever he could, because that seemed to help him be at ease, at least a bit. He had tried to refuse, in the beginning, but soon realized that Tony wouldn’t stop. Then he started to enjoy it, or so it seemed. Maybe it was easier for him, to smile and talk with Morgan, who didn’t know him before, who expected nothing of him.
Tony managed to usher them all into the kitchen. Peter definitely needed to eat something, and he’d learned that people in general usually felt more comfortable when they were sitting around a table. Food was as good an excuse as any. Even though that might not be true for Nebula, seeing as she wasn’t really “people”. Although he had to admit that she’d learned a lot during her time on earth. Especially since Rhodey had taken her under his wing, which Tony could say from his own experience, was great. Nobody gave better hugs than Rhodey.
"We have to try, Tony," Steve said. "Before this goes anywhere beyond this room. We have to see if there's any way we can fix this without—"
Barnes's eyebrows went up in surprise, and he nodded his head in understanding and said, "Then definitely remind me not to piss you off."
"OK, cutie pie," he said and shoved the phone into his pocket. "Uncle Rhodey's right. It's time for you to go beddy-bye."
He swallowed and took a breath to calm the thrumming in his veins. Oh, god, he was dying. This was it. This was the end. At least he could say he had gotten to marry Steve. God, did he look fucking
old. Humans ordinarily cannot sense it, but if any humans could sense the bond, it would unquestionably be you two. You haven't had any recollections yet, have you?"
"Well, that's what I mean by the 'test' — if Steve recognizes the handwriting or not. It's not his handwriting. I'm thinking it could be his mother's."
He thought about this a moment then said, "Whatever," and grabbed it from Natasha's hands. "Is there a dressing room around here? I'm not buying this unless I look fucking fantastic in it."
be your catch- all. The rest of the team makes fun of you for it when they're not asking you whether you invented fire or the wheel."
"Language," Steve said immediately, and Tony rolled his eyes again but didn't say anything. "And what's wrong?"
Steve just took a breath and let it out, fingers tripping at the little blue garter Tony wore on his right thigh before he pulled his hand back and let at the bare flesh part of Tony's thigh with a firm slap. Tony jolted a bit at the hit them hummed a little and all but purred, "Is that the way we're doing it tonight?"
"In a normal situation, I might be," he admitted, his steady gaze boring into Tony as a means of providing the stability and comfort Tony so desperately needed. "But this is far from a normal — let alone ideal — situation, and I don't want you putting yourself into anything that might be considered even remotely dangerous. We are also in a terribly risky occupation and should by no means be responsible for the welfare of a child. We're both orphans. We know what that's like. I don't care if we did miraculously create a life together. Avengers Tower is the last place on earth you should want to raise a child. Never mind the fact that Bruce said this would be incredibly high-risk. I mean, sure, a child that's both you and me? That would be amazing. But you're the one that I want, Tony. You're the one I'm in love with. You're the one I always want at my side. I'm not going to risk you for anything. Not even something like this."
a matter of life and death for you. Look, I've known Doctor Ganford a long time. I trust her. She's very discreet, and she's very good. If I didn't know anyone that I trusted, yeah, I would bullshit my way through with you and hope for the best, but I trust her, Tony. She'll be good for you. She'll make sure everything's the way it should be and she won't run to the press with it."
Other Tony shrugged. "Honestly, I just know Gramps had them. Where he got them from, I don't know. I wasn't there. They've always existed as long as I've been alive. Mom doesn't know exactly how Gramps got them, either, but she always remembers them being there, too."
Tony swallowed. He hadn't thought about it in that context, hadn't thought that Steve would be so…possessive, of sorts…about it. He'd thought it could just be a fun little bit of play doing something they hadn't done in a while.
"Sweet! Gelato!" Clint said as he walked into the kitchen, tablet in hand. He grabbed a spoon from the drawer and made to scoop a spoonful out of the gelato container, but Tony took his own spoon and thwacked Clint hard over the knuckles with it, which earned him a, "The
Tony waved an airy hand in the air. "Or one of their parents or subsidiaries. I don't know. They change that shit all the time. One company merges with another, or they rename or rebrand. Hard to keep up. Got my own company and my own shit to deal with—
Some song that began 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire…' played quietly in the background, and the voice that sang it was like pure liquid gold, so rich and melodious Steve thought he could listen to it forever. He nestled closer to Tony, reveling in the warmth and security he provided.
"Oh, no? That's not what I hear," he said as he cuddled her and tickled her sides a little bit. "I hear you're a big, ol' screwball."
Here’s what he does know: Steve Rogers is an enigma, doesn’t drink coffee, Tony wouldn’t mind having him as a friend. They agree on a lot of topics but still manage to always disagree. Whenever they are in a disagreement, Steve’s lips curl up and Tony wants to get rid of it. Steve’s known for his roles in A24 coming of age films which makes perfect sense why he had been casted in this movie. Tony has no clue how he wasn't aware of Steve until now. Because suddenly now wherever he goes he sees Steve. He sees posters of Steve’s other upcoming movies, he goes onto Twitter and sees tweets about Steve.
Steve’s lips and tongue felt nice and hot against his. His skin was radiating heat. Steve’s hands came to Tony’s waist, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s body.
Tony moves up on the couch to playfully push Steve. “I have never seen you fall asleep on set,” he says accusingly.
The cute guy comes to the coffee shop more often now. So much that Steve has memorized his order, it’s quite a small coffee shop so it’s normal to recognize the same orders.
“You’ve been in this industry for this long and not drink coffee?” Tony asks in disbelief. There are so many late nights, long days, where his only saving grace had been coffee.
Tony waits for his phone to ring. He doesn’t even have to look at the caller ID. Maria’s voice is the next thing he hears. “What is going on between you two?”
It’s no secret that Tony and Steve are competing for the best spot in this class. They’re both very competitive (not to mention rivals). They have been competing with everything in class. From their marks, their seats, their discussion points. Tony smiles.
He hears the casting agents whispering to each other. Tony looks to where Steve is awkwardly gathering his jacket. Tony hasn't even left the room when Phil calls out to them. “You got the part!”
“Hey, don’t worry. It takes two to tango. Don’t doubt my abilities and I won’t doubt yours.” Tony’s got this whole comforting thing down.
Tony’s arm came up to wrap around Steve’s neck. Tony was pulling him even closer. Steve’s mind was completely on Tony, who was kissing him.
A class all about Shakespeare. Now, Tony wasn’t about to curse a dead man. But a whole class? About one man? He hoped to god that this class would be interesting.
He greets her with a hello. Then quickly glances around the room, not trying to plan his escape. Okay, maybe he is trying to find an escape. Pepper takes one look at Tony’s eyes darting around the room and laughs lightly. Tony hasn’t explained to her yet that he and Steve are— Tony finds that he doesn’t even know what he and Steve are. They haven’t had that talk yet. He’s quick to speak up, “it’s not what it looks like, okay maybe a little, what I mean is—”
Tony saw other members of the fraternity looking at him through the window. He started to get winded up ready to yell at them too—
Tony’s eyes dart over the room where Steve is talking to someone. Someone calls out Pepper's name, she sighs then leaves.
Bucky nods. “Remember, the year you got suspended then had to switch school—” He gets cut off by Tony.
“I’m sorry, you? Steve Rogers wants to take a selfie? The one who thinks he is above new technology, the biggest tech hater?” Tony questions.
hangover when he woke up. Sure enough, the Wednesday morning sun woke him up. He groaned and swallowed the Advil he had so kindly left himself. Tony looked at the time, 8:30 the clock read. He realized he had a whole hour before he had to go to his only class of the day.
Tony just stares at him, blinking rapidly. Unaware of how to process such a controversial sentence. The audacity of this man. The fucking audacity. “Steven Grant Rogers,” Tony declares, “You, my good sir, are an idiot if you think I would ever be persuaded to do that.”
The options they had chosen for waiting till the dating rumours to go away obviously did not work. If anything it gave the fans more substance. The plan had backfired.
“You remember the day we met?” Tony started as he was lying on his bed, Steve changing his shirt and getting ready for bed.
The next night everyone agrees they need a relaxing night after a long day. Which is why they all end up at a karaoke place.
“Not the greatest! The number of typos I see in them! Is nobody double-checking them? How many different ways can you spell fraternity wrong?”
He takes a sip from his red solo cup then sees Steve. He wonders if Steve also plays football. He certainly is built for it. That’s just from an objective point, nothing else. Nat obviously sees him staring at Steve.
As the cameras roll and Steve delivers his line. Tony leans in. He’s thinking about Steve. He feels Steve’s lips against his. When they pull apart, Tony is breathing heavily.
He enters the room and notices Mr. Stealer Of Parking Spots giving the cup of coffee to Phil. Oh. So this must have been his first day on set as an assistant who rushed and accidentally parked somewhere they weren’t supposed to. What Tony isn’t expecting is Phil clapping his hands then introducing the blond as the gut he is doing the chemistry read with.
He spoke. God, his voice was absolutely wrecked. “Oh wow, so embarrassing, my name is actually Tony.”
Sitting on Tony’s couch they are much closer to each other than they were at the karaoke place. Steve is resting his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony doesn’t know if he can hear his heartbeat racing but Tony knows his heart is beating like crazy right now.
“Not to mention the same theme.” Tony said accusingly, “Whatever, I’m leaving I hate the energy in this house, y’all should consider burning sage,” he said as he opened the door and walked out.
Somehow while Steve and Tony were on their mandatory get along nights, paparazzi had taken photos. From the angle the photo was taken, Steve’s leaning in across the table and Tony has his head tilt up looking admiringly.
Tony shows the photo to Steve, “karma,” he says, excitedly. He forgets about the phone in his hand as his blue eyes gaze into Tony’s brown eyes. Which of course, was Steve’s plan of action. Steve succinctly takes the phone with s sound triumphant.
“Look I’m- I’m not sure you can forgive me and I’m not asking you to. I’d be honored if you would, but I also understand if you can’t. I was hoping we could be- I don’t know, if not friends then at least be civil to each other, for Steve’s sake.”
Bucky found him an hour later, eyes red but with a small smile on his lips. He joined Tony and Morgan on the couch where they were watching a cartoon before the kid needed to go to bed. He snuggled up to them and pressed a small kiss on Tony’s temple.
“Right, okay. Fine.” He rolled his eyes but couldn’t help grinning when they all cheered. Even Bucky, though much quieter than Steve and Morgan.
He passed two of the shirts over to Steve and kept the third one for himself, sitting down on the bed again. After a moment of hesitation, he decided that there was no reason why he shouldn’t get comfortable, so he shrugged out of his pants as well and went in search of his sweatpants that he knew should be somewhere around. He found them, just in time to turn around and see Steve press a soft kiss onto Bucky’s shoulder. He could see them talk in low voices, but he wasn’t focusing enough to understand, and it wasn’t important anyway. Not right now.
Thinking about how lucky he was also got Tony thinking about the one person he still hadn’t seen: Peter. Sure, he knew that Peter was with his aunt, that he had started school again and that he was doing quite well. But he hadn’t called, hadn’t come to visit and slowly Tony was starting to worry. It wasn’t like the boy to just vanish, that made no sense. So, as soon as he had a quiet minute after breakfast, he went outside on the porch, pulled out his phone and called Happy.
The smell of coffee woke him up, hours later. It wasn’t dark outside anymore; in fact, the sun was shining bright and high. He could hear Morgan running around downstairs, yelling about some thing or another. Pepper was sitting on the bed next to him, a cup of coffee in her hand, a smile in her face.
“Steve… I- what?” What was going on? This was about as far away from what Tony would have expected as it could get.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, which was very obviously not what the man had expected. Which made it all the more important. “I’m sorry for what happened in Siberia, for attacking you. I’m sorry for accusing you as well, and for the fact that I didn’t help you when I could have.”
Bucky was watching him and something in his eyes made Tony think that he knew exactly why Tony was afraid of drowning. He reached out with his metal hand and lightly touched Tony’s neck. Comforting, grounding. Tony smiled. It wasn’t a good smile, not quite, but it was enough to reassure Bucky for a moment.
“Did you, did you not know that? Shit Steve I’m sorry! I didn’t- I wouldn’t do that. I mean, I obviously did, I should have asked-“ He broke off, unsure what to say and mad at himself for ruining the moment. He could have just let it pass, just ignore it, but no, he had to go and ruin what was possibly his last evening with Steve. Fuck. They had been dancing around each other for years now, but never gotten anywhere. And now he’d gone and fucked it up.
“Be right back,” he said, already opening the door to the bathroom, thinking. A bath, obviously, something with bubbles, because those were always fun. They had all seen each other naked before, of course, with them working as a team for a while. But this was different. Not bad, but not something they should rush. They had time, now. For real. So bubbles and colored water it was.
Natasha and Pepper were sitting in the kitchen when Steve and Tony finally made their way back down. They had devoured the cupcakes and fruits Tony had brought up and then Tony had spent some time patching Steve up. He was right, it wasn’t that bad, not anymore. The hot water had helped for the various aches and pains, so the main thing Tony did was tape his ribs. He’d wanted Steve to sleep some, pretty sure that that would take care of the rest, but Steve had insisted on checking on the others. Maybe he wanted to see Bucky, that would make sense. And Tony did want to see Natasha, too, so in the end they just got dressed in comfy clothes and went downstairs.
“Still, he says. That asshole was hobbling over to the car as soon as he was awake enough to do so.” Barnes was grinning at them, casually leaning on the car roof.
“You’re not coming back,” Tony realized. Well, that hurt. A lot more than it should, after everything that had happened, and yet. Or maybe not, maybe it hurt just the right amount. Because they made it, they made it through and he had hoped that they could have their friendship back, at least, if not more and this- yeah, this hurt. But Steve was already reaching out towards him, taking a step closer, eyes wide.
Eventually, Tony sat up a bit, tried to detangle himself front Steve, ignoring the protesting sound he made. He leaned back onto the wall, closed his eyes for a moment. Now was as good as any other moment, he guessed.
“Come on,” he said, voice soft. Bucky stared at him, clearly not knowing what Tony wanted. He tugged at him, until he got up, too. Tony led him into the kitchen first, made sure that they both had a glass of water, then to the bathroom. They brushed their teeth in silence, washed their faces. Tony took Bucky’s hand again and led him upstairs. They walked past the guestroom Bucky usually used and he could hear him make a soft, questioning sound, but he didn’t protest, didn’t stop until they were standing in front of Steve’s door.
Clint was standing in the door, frozen, staring at Natasha. She was sitting on the couch, equally frozen, equally longing.
"Thanks, Jar, you're the best," Tony said. He grinned at Steve, and watched as the young man on the table squirmed. "Now, let's see how this goes, huh?" He slid a hand down Steve's abdomen until he reached his cock, rubbing a firm hand up and down. “Mm… Now this, see, you were way out of proportion in the day Cap.”
“Yeah, Stevie, you did so good… c’mon, c’mon… I’ve got the cot over here.’ He carefully helped Steve off of the chair, supporting him when his knees tried to buckle, and urged him toward the cot. “My good, good boy..” He pressed another kiss to Steve’s forehead, grinning when his lover looked up at him with his eyes blown wide.
“Mm… Well, still nice and responsive, that’s good.” Tony brought the wheel ever closer to Steve’s cock, clinically reaching out to steady Steve’s hips when he tried to jerk his hips away. But Tony held him firm and then continued to run the wheel up and down Steve’s leg.
“You aren’t even that kind of doctor. Bruce says he isn’t that kind of doctor, and he’s your doctor!” Steve knew it was a stretch, trying to talk Tony Stark into coming around, but he had to try.
“Tony my nerves are just fine,” Steve said, wriggling a little more. But the chair held him fast and Tony shook his head.
He stopped at the table and picked up a metal device. Steve wasn’t sure what it was. His question must have been obvious, though, because Tony held it up so he could see it clearly. “This? This is a Wartenberg Wheel.” He lifted one finger to spin the spikey wheel. Steve thought it looked kind of like a pizza cutter, if a pizza cutter had a baby with a porcupine. “It tests nerve endings.”
“Shh… Good… Good, you did so good…” And just like that, it was over. Tony gently slid the massager from Steve’s ass, and set to work on the cuffs. He cleaned Steve up with a cloth he pulled from a pack of wipes on the tray, setting the 'sample' aside for later. Steve lay boneless on the chair, breathing hard, short little gasps that almost reminded him of the asthma attacks he used to have. His heart slowed gradually as he let Tony work around him.
"Huh, go figure... Red. Just like everyone else." Tony grinned up at Steve, like it was all a big joke. "You know, I always thought you'd bleed stars and stripes, Cap." He pulled the tourniquet off,  and then turned back to his cart. "Hmm... Your heart rate went up a little but everything else seems good, so now I think I'm gonna check some nerve sensitivity." He slid his hands clinically up and down Steve's sides, noting where the other man pulled away.  "JARVIS, are you getting this?"
“Ahh, I don’t see what that has to do with anything,” Steve protested, pulling fruitlessly against the straps holding his legs open. There was nothing he could do; Tony had him exactly where he wanted him. He blushed a bright red at the thought, the color spreading down into his chest.
“Tony, please, Tones…” Steve gasped, moving as much as his restraints would allow. Tony’s eyes were fixed on Steve, as the numbers for his heart rate and O2 began to shift. The blood pressure cuff kicked on, another meaningless point of pressure to counterpoint the tightness forming in his balls.
"Alright. We're within appropriate levels, so that's good... Now." He turned back and began to pull on a pair of rubber gloves. "We're gonna need some blood samples. I need to compare them to before." He went to the arm not attached to the blood pressure cuff, and Steve began to tug away a little.
“Okay Cap, here we go…” And then the damned toy started buzzing. Steve howled and arched but couldn’t get away as the damn toy vibrated right against his prostate. He was harder than nails and leaking in less than a minute.
Steve gasped and tried to pull back, expecting sharp. He didn’t expect the feeling of pressure and slight sting, though. He craned his head as Tony continued the wheel’s movement up his leg, across his thighs. “Tony… Ahh…”
“Come for me, Steve… That’s it, c’mon…” With a cry, Steve came. His ass tightened against the massager and he moaned again. Tony didn’t let the toy shift off his prostate until tears were streaming down Steve’s face from the over sensitization.
“Tony, please…” Steve couldn’t believe he was still hard. Tony was… Touching him, taking him. He swallowed hard. “Tony…”
“Tony,” he moaned softly, a little alarmed at how weak his voice sounded. Tony grinned, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“Now, where’s that… Ah, here it is.” Tony pulled out a sleeve and slid it over Steve’s cock. “Here we go…” He slid his hand up Steve’s sensitized side and pinched a nipple just to watch Steve buck up into it.
"You really don't have to do this, Tony," Steve said earnestly. "Like, I'm not the one that you need to be worried about. We need to find Loki! We need to figure out what he did to me!" He pulled on the cuffs holding him down to the chair, but they were annoyingly snug. Tony wasn't like any of the villains who had managed to de-serum him over the years, he had made sure that Steve's cuffs were tight on his newly narrow wrists.
“Shh, Cap… Just a little more.” Tony continued to run the wheel along Steve’s body, The skin grew red as it felt like every nerve Tony touched grew more and more alert. His cock was leaking between his legs and he whimpered.
Tony turned back to him, pushing the little rolling tray of supplies toward the chair. Steve knew in his current incarnation there wasn’t a chance in hell of him getting away, and he felt even smaller than his lack of serum would imply. He stared as Tony stepped even closer, looming over the chair where he was restrained. "You don't get it, Cap," Tony said with a grin. "I mean, I am the most reliable source of information on the serum. It only makes sense that I would be the one to check you out." His grin was wolfish, and Steve shivered again. This time it wasn't from the cold.
“Well,” Tony chuckled as he climbed onto the cot and pulled Steve close. “They don’t call me Dr. Stark for nothing.’
Tony turned back to his cart. “Alright now, last thing… Nerves look good. I just need a semen sample.”
"Tony!" But Tony ignored him and a moment later Steve hissed as Tony pushed the needle into his arm. It settled into his vein with little fanfare and Tony filled a couple of vials with bright red blood. He slid the needle out gently and taped down a pressure dressing carefully, the concern a sharp contrast to his tone.
Tony chuckled. "Steve, this is all gonna go a lot faster if you just let me do my thing, okay?" He pulled out a strip of rubber and wrapped it around Steve's bicep. "Just relax and think of Uncle Sam, huh?" Cool alcohol rubbed firmly along the skin on the inside of his elbow, cleaning the vein for Tony to draw from.
“Ah ah, Cap. It’s for science, you know.” He slid one finger down the center of Steve’s foot, raising one eyebrow as he pulled his foot back. The chair held him fast, and Tony made a tsking sound with his tongue. ‘None of that, Cap,” he said. He lifted the wheel and began to glide it with a steady pressure down the middle of Steve’s foot.
