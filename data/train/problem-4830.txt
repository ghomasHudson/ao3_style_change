Steve laughed and then looked at him with a raised eyebrow. ”You’ll buy it even though you just don’t hate it and not love it?”
Steve’ face pulled into that expression that definitely meant that he was about to say something sappy, but before he could, Peter interrupted him, obviously bored.
“Nah.” Tony smiled widely and waved it off, “I had to go over some details about the news SI tech, I kinda lost my feeling for time there.”
Firstly, his past — future self had left incredible footsteps, expectations in others, that Tony could never
The team expected him to act like a heartless asshole. They knew him and this was the behavior they were used to.
Tony breathed hard, his vision was a bit blurry, but he needed to do that. He needed Steve to know, that he would burn the sky to ash if it meant that he got to keep him.
”Mr. Stark?” The doctor said, coming closer and extending his arm. ”I am Dr. Harwich. You were in an accident, do you remember that?”
”Your son.” Tall Blonde’s voice was hard like stone and Tony had no doubt that he had learned that in the military. He didn’t even need to ask to know that this man had served.
but so what? It wasn’t as if he rammed a shield in his upper body and than left. But somehow it was him not eating that much anymore far worse, huh.
This kid was spoiled if he thought that he could just pout his way to get everything. Tony never had family dinners, he never had play time with his father and look at him now. He was doing alright.
That night Tony learned that he could feel pain just fine, when Howard gave him a full five to his cheek, before leaving his room in a rush, muttering
Tony didn’t know how he even got this thought, but his next notion might be his worst one yet. Still, though, he didn’t have a better idea either. He needed to live here and to make that possible he needed Rogers to stop being miserable around him and start to show other emotions. Do
Rhodey stuck to a silent answer, just shaking his head like he was just barely holding back from shaking Tony.
They sat some more in weird silence, neither really knowing what to say or do. Rogers sure looked convinced, though, to figure this whole thing out on his own. He just sat there as if he was reassessing what he needed to do now.
The man in front of him had always looked incredibly sad. But seeing his eyes swim in tears, that could be happy ones if they weren’t marked with so much miserable nostalgia, it nearly was too much for Tony.
that Tony would just feel anxious if he asked questions about the whole thing and that the best way of handling it was to wait until Tony was ready to talk.
he was feeling nervous. Tony send a quick curse to whoever had transmitted that emotion, before he looked back into his full body mirror and looked himself up and down.
stop calling him James, since this had been what Hydra called him too. Bucky couldn’t bear to think about that anymore, the nightmares were enough and he couldn’t stand to hear the name James when he was awake as well. Bucky had looked so hurt, all his emotions open in his eyes, he didn’t even bother to hide them; he didn’t hide anything in fact. He was completely open and honest, so trustworthy that Tony couldn’t help but feel empathy.
Steve looked like he considered it for a second, before shaking his head. ”I think it’s important for you two to do something just the both of you. To find balance again. But I’ll be here if something happens.”
They sat like this without moving for quite some time, Tony secretly just waiting to freak out and run again.
“—No.” Rhodey just looked at him with an exhausted expression, like he knew that Tony was just teasing, but then went back to look at the ceiling.
and roll his eyes to the ceiling. Tony could think of 337 different ways to kill Steve right on the spot and hated it that he couldn’t decide which one was the most painful.
”Don’t.” Rogers’s voice was strained as if he had to take all his trained strength to keep himself from reacting poorly. Tony dropped his hand with the chain and raised an eyebrow at him.
”Yes,” he answered then finally, locking his eyes with Tony. ”We argued a long time about it. But you were right, Peter is smart and you’d rather drink boiling oil than let anything happen to Pete. You took every safety caution there was, so —”
Rogers had no idea who he was, so who was he to judge whether or not he was better than his father? What did he even know about all of this?
Tony waited for Steve to continue, but he just rubbed the back of his head and looked at Tony with his blue eyes, silently begging Tony to just
Mostly, though, he was just really confused. Because he had no idea how to let go of the kid again. He was so giggly and happy and Tony just stared down to him and for the first time in his life , he got why people even had children.
for fuck’s sake. He wasn’t 12 anymore, he had no reason whatsoever to fall for someone who was nice to him. Tony had learned this lesson years ago, decades even. Sentiment was a weakness, people were only fond of him for as long as they needed something.
Bucky nodded again, before taking his hand off Steve’s shoulder to pick up Peter’s little backpack from the floor. ”You keep an eye on him and I’ll take Peter, okay? Call if something changes!”
When they got to his office he sat down in his chair by the desk, while Steve looked around wide eyed for second, before he seemed to remember where he was and began to scratch the back of his head.
Jesus, it hasn’t even been that long since he had gotten released from the hospital, and yet he had changed already.
Peter continued making motor sounds while playing with the bright red car, that was missing a wheel.
He tried to find balance, tried to hold on to the elevator walls for his dear life, but everything was shifting and he couldn’t stop shaking.
Steve nodded, seeming really crushed about it all. Tony suppressed that hint of compassion that threatened to bloom inside of him.
Natasha just stared at him in a way that could peel paint from the walls, before she raised an eyebrow at him and shook her head softly.
Clint huffed without any humor and walked to the foot of Tony’s bed. He eyed Tony up and down one more time.
It actually started so harmless. He didn’t really give it much thought before. Of course was he aware that this illness didn’t just come over somebody, like a storm or wild fire. Everything needed to progress, but he never ever thought that it would begin and grow so slow and harmless that he wouldn’t even realized how deep he’s in until he was already on the bottom of a pit and still falling. It really
”Exquisitely handled, Sir,” Jarvis commented, to which Tony just flipped him off in the nearest camera.
”Daddy?” He asked, cocking his head slightly. He looked so much like Tony, it hurt him to think about it.
Jesus, all that Steve was doing was putting Tony’s fires out, it was always a good call to have him with him.
Tony grabbed the chain and pulled the tags over his head, they felt weirdly heavy, as if they were pressing down on his chest with the weight of all the things he had forgotten. ”Here,” he said to Rogers, who looked back down to the tags and then startled back up at Tony. Weird, the terror on his face looked so out of place, since all he’s seen on it till now had been sadness and confusion.
He had called him Tony. That meant he knew him, which, yeah, would explain a lot that was going on here, but still didn’t help the problem. Because he had no
You locked yourself away in your workshop, because — yeah why? Because you’re the great Tony Stark, who doesn’t need help, huh?
”Tony, I never meant to hurt — ” Steve interrupted himself before Tony could, probably realizing just how much nonsense he was saying, but that was just a theory.
“Not you hurt them. It did. We knew something was up with you but not even Jarvis could find out what it was and it was a mess, Tony. But you’re back and that’s all that matters.”
Natasha looked at him with a thoughtful expression, her right eyebrow raised and her front teeth buried in her bottom lip. Barnes next to her had his eyes on the floor, everything about him screamed guilt and he didn’t seem as if he was willing to fight. He just looked devastated and so, so tired. Tony felt a tiny bit empathy. He had more time to think about everything, and found that he didn’t hate James, even though he surely should.
because somewhere on his long journey to get to this screwed up point, he’s built an aversion for food, and now he couldn’t even think of it without gagging. He wanted to change
Tony flinched so hard, he felt it with every bone in his body. He plastered his press—grin over his face and nodded at Bruce thoughtfully.
Sitting down on his workbench never felt as pointless as it did now. Steve’s words always on his mind, repeating themselves in mocking loops, making it hard to breath. He sat there for hours at least, until he fell asleep, tears dried on his cheeks, darkness swallowing him down like he’d always been part of it.
Tony groaned and raised his glass to his lips, it was definitely neither his first nor his last drink for this night. Because it sucked, all of it. He was alone in his big house and all he could think of was
Everything felt heavier. His thinning hair, his paling lips and brittle finger nails, his constant shivering, his sensitive, dry skin, hollowed cheeks, sunken eyes,
Tony didn’t answer him. If Steve wanted to live in denial then so be it, but Tony would never make the same mistake twice and believe what Steve was saying. So he just looked at him, trying to seem strong. As if he wasn’t a bit
Rogers shushed the kid, petting over his hair. Tony still didn’t think that he should be here for that. It felt weirdly intimate, as if it was inappropriate of him to watch it. He stayed seated though, for no reason he could put into words.
thin he was under the sweaters and plaid shirts he never seemed to take off nowadays. Tony let his eyes close, his teeth clench and his breath stuck in his lung. She knew. Of course she did. He could feel even more panic raising in him, his heart beating fast inside his chest - still or yet again he couldn’t tell. All he knew was that he’d been found out.
Rogers pushed himself from the kitchen counter he had leaned against, but then stayed were he was. ”I really would, but the master bedroom is closest to Peter and I don’t want him to walk into your room if he wakes up in the middle of the night.”
Rogers turned around and put the plate in one drawer before turning back, making his way to his son’s bedroom door. Before he could reach it, though, and check on the kid he turned around again, looking at Tony remorseful again, but in a more pitying way.
“You can’t have it back, pal, losing my arm twice would just look like I’m careless. That’s not something ladies are looking for.”
doesn’t want to play now,” Tony bit out, harsher than he intended to but he couldn’t care less right now.
Looking back, that moment may have been the moment when everything went to hell. Or well, became more
. Because how dare he to talk to Tony like that. Like Tony owed them, like he couldn’t survive without them, as if he was a child, that needed their help, after doing something stupid.
The last time Tony felt as clueless and taken aback as he did now was when his father yelled at him for not working fast enough when he was 5 and couldn’t understand nor express what all the numbers and ideas in his head meant yet.
He wanted to tell her that he couldn’t even tell if that was worse than the voice whispering. Because that voice just reminded him that he had been awake through all of it, he had obviously tried to fight it and now he couldn’t remember any of that. It had just erased his memory and even though it was coming back, who said that this was the only thing this demon took from him? What if it was still inside of him, just hiding? Or still making decisions while leaving him feeling like he was in charge?
Rogers didn’t take the tags, though. He just stared at them and back up at Tony as if he was just trying to unsee something and failing completely. His posture, though, was as studied as you could imagine from a
“Well, you obviously ain’t able to do that now, are you?” Sam looked at him with narrowed eyes. “This is
Tony nearly fell asleep on the couch, but got startled out of his sleep when Rogers cleared his throat behind him, before walking over to the bar at the kitchen, leaning against it without looking away from Tony.
, because everything before that hadn’t really been Candyland either. But that might be the key moment when his life went from shitty to even shittier; when he went from bad to worse and everything just became darker than it had been before.
Tony pulled the corners of his mouth up, mimicking how Rhodey looked when he didn’t burn their dinner that one time.
. No words found their way out of his way too dry mouth, and he just gaped at her silently, trying to let his brain catch up with everything.
. He got up and scratched his head, did something even happen? Did the machine break already? He felt the normal sadness creep into him again, right when a drop of water from one of the pipes above his head, fell down onto his forehead.
”Eight.” Rogers had gritted his teeth, Tony felt like he had won, but he didn’t feel better. It occurred to him later that the reason for that could be that he was playing a dirty game and talked as if he was winning when really he just was the only one even in on it, the only person who would even make something like this about winning.
And then with one snap of a finger, he wanted that too. Being happy, that is. Or just now what the big deal about it all was.
He woke up to a not quite steady beeping sound. It fluctuated between irregularly fast and sluggishly slow, missing a beat completely from time to time. Yeah, definitely his screwed—up heartbeat.
Steve sighed and then got up, walking to the kitchen, beginning to wash the dishes silently, obviously still thinking about how to say something. Tony was about to run out of the room when he saw a plastic plate with little rockets on it, but then Rogers stopped his motions, turning to Tony. He kept his eyes on the plate in his hands though and Tony really began to hate Rogers for always looking like he had a lot of precious memories attached to about anything.
Steve nodded, saying nothing, seemingly waiting for Tony to go ahead and ask what he wanted to know.
Still, hearing the kid confirming that he saw it, too, broke something in Tony he couldn’t quite put into words.
He leaned back, suddenly too exhausted to keep himself up and sank back into Steve’s arms, who took a deep breath himself.
He didn’t think he ever felt like his heart literally ripped in two, but looking at Peter crying like this? Yes. That’s what it felt like.
He had seen many expressions on this man’s face, this hadn’t been one of them. Tony swore he could feel the paint being pulled off the walls at the gaze.
”We’re married, it’s not inappropriate. I bet I had this dick in my mouth more often than either of us could count,” Tony stated bluntly, breaking the heavy eye contact just in favor to look if Rogers was blushing.
The following weeks went back to being uneasy with Natasha, but he got it. He could handle himself, avoiding people was his new best talent, and it wasn’t as if Natasha desperately wanted to talk again. They just ignored each other, until Black Widow saved him in a mission by shooting a guy sneaking up on Tony, who was in the middle of putting his suit on. They both shared a tiny smile and nod and that was pretty much the end of it. They still weren’t best friends, hell, they
. He just kind of appeared from one moment to the next. Tony only knew that Steve met him while running and
Peter babbled happily with his uncle, the two laughed a lot. Tony wondered if he had been a good father once. If he had been the one to bath Peter and get his fruit loops, before. If he had been the one to laugh with him.
“They’ll look the same, dear, but they’ll work better,” Tony answered, not looking up but still trying to maintain his posture. He needed to be reasonable about this. Fact was that he didn’t know if any of that what he dreamt was real. It might feel that way but this didn’t prove anything.
Rogers huffed, it was in such an unamused way that it seemed as if it pulled every little sign of humor out of every aspect of the whole apartment.
“Oh, so you can be trusted to know what you feel when you’ve been able to feel for 27 years and everybody beyond that just can’t?” It was part of an honest question, even. Tony really wanted to know, but mostly did he just want to convince Steve that he could do
They became fast best friends, something Tony didn’t think was possible. Well, depending that he still would leave Rhodey behind in a burning house because he meant about as much as his laptop to Tony, but he didn’t mind. He laughed with Tony, took time to explain things to him and didn’t get frustrated with him.
He went up to the wooden door, feeling happy to see Steve again. Who’d have known that feeling can be this
Tony didn’t know why it hurt so much more, though, when it was Steve thinking those things. As if he had something to prove and just couldn’t succeed.
In his defense, he had always been an asshole. Saying sorry had never been his strong suit, so why start now.
“Do you know where I can find Steve Rogers per chance? Like, it was really nice meeting you but I really didn’t come for you.”
Rogers swallowed once, closing his eyes shortly, looking like Tony does, when he tries to sort out his thoughts, order them in different boxes. ”You were terrified,” Rogers huffed eventually, opening his eyes again,” but also so happy. When she told us that it had worked, you were all but crying.”
The kid pulled his bright eyebrows together and looked for a second like the exact mini-version of the man carrying him, who also wore the same expression, but then his little face eased into a little giggle and then another yawn.
Tony didn’t even bother with trying to sleep anymore. If it overwhelms him than so be it, he’ll get his two hours until he wakes up, bathed in sweat, unheard screams on his lips; but he never laid down to sleep anymore. It would end up with nightmares anyway.
She had cried, looking at pictures of bombed cities, while he shrugged and told her that he’d fix it.  Now she always laughs so bright that her eyes crinkle up, when she sees another laughing kid, enjoying their new prosthetic.
Tony tried to turn his head slightly, worsening the ache in it and then tried to take a sharp breath, but his chest felt heavy, as if there was a weight on him that he couldn’t shake.
Tony was about to shake his head and take the offered hand, when the sunlight got caught on something on his left hand and gleamed in a soft gold.
Clint stepped after him into the kitchen, face devoid of his normal easy grin, obviously catching up that this was more serious than coffee.
He was pretty sure he already did, but he couldn’t tell. Right now it was more of strong sense of ‘He does not deserve to be breathing in the same oxygen as regular people'. He wanted to be able to
Steve stopped cutting for a second, shooting him a little smile. ”Yes, I did. You said it made my eyes pop.”
Tony laid his head back and laughed in honesty. Everything was so beautiful, the sun felt warm and his best friend was here with him. He felt so glad to be alive for the first time in his life; this thought alone nearly made him tear up again. He could jump up and down in excitement, he felt invincible.
Go to dinner with me.” Tony didn’t know where those words came from, but he felt like he never said something more important in his life, “Please.”
. He was in control over his body and his mind, so it won't be no problem. He ate so little, because he
to think about it. And then he cuts out dairy, without really realizing it either. He was empty inside and nothing quite
Neither Tony nor Clint had put much thought into it, but this was the first time that Tony stood still for a second and actually really considered if he could be ill.
When he got to the living room though, he halted in the doorway, staring at the scene before him. Peter was crying in Steve’s arm, who kneeled to be on the kid’s height.
Tony didn’t even bother to turn around, he just wanted to be left alone, but if Rhodes needed to trash a few things, then by all means.
kid is underneath it? I just — I don’t understand. Math I can do okay, I knew the solution to the equations you’re trying to figure out over there when I was five, but —”
He took the steaming cup and was about to throw two sugars in it, without even thinking about it, when he stopped himself. This motion was so familiar: two sugars, three spoonfuls of milk. It’s how he drank his coffee, how he did for years, but right now he stared at the two sugar cubes, that lay innocently in his palm, and he couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose. His life was way too bitter, no sugar could help with that. It wouldn’t fill the emptiness inside of him, it would leave him feeling worn out and damaged, like the alcohol did.
He felt like he should cry. He felt like he would soon anyhow because this memory was so little, but it was so precious, so important, that Tony didn’t really know how to contain all of his emotions right now.
“What do you even want from me? I wasn’t good enough for anything, especially for you, so why do you keep doing this; keep coming down here and talking, and —
Wait, would it even be cheating? Tony shook his head, He didn’t want to know, because he didn’t need to know. He hadn’t even been thinking about sleeping with somebody else and Steve had been here, waiting for him to come home to what? See, if he had brought someone with him, so he could send them home so Peter wouldn’t see?
He still didn’t get it. He asked Jarvis to tell him every detail from his way to get there again, but this didn’t mean that he had to get it.
The kid walked in, holding the hand of a tall guy with long brown hair and lack of a left arm. Tony was rude enough to not even hide that he was staring for a second. He knew that he was an impression in all of those people’s minds; a different person. Better make them used to who he actually was before they got their hopes up.
”You are kidding, right? Tony, we talked about this. Humor has a line that it shouldn’t cross. This is not funny.”
“Mhm.” He only shrugged and sank a bit farther in the couch. He wanted to do something instead of sitting here, but his parents said they’d be back when the clock showed 2:00 and it only said 1:05.
Steve was unbelievably beautiful. Tony was certain that he knew that, too, but he still had the urge to tell him.
“People have apple seeds, apparently and I don’t. I can’t feel.” He lulled, grinning toothily, too tired of hiding who he really was.
Steve looked concerned again, as if he didn’t really know what reaction would be justified so he just settled for looking uneasy.
After he was finished he just looked miserable, and Tony couldn’t help himself but feel the empathy he had tried to suppress ever since Steve had entered the lab. Despite his best efforts, it grew and grew and there it was: making him want to hug the other man, but also shout at him forever, for throwing their whole relationship away just like that, as if it meant nothing to him.
Steve narrowed his eyes, completely unaware that Tony was planning ways to get away with murder at this very moment.
“You know what I can’t do?” Tony felt his hope dropping out of him, but he couldn’t stop here. Hope or not, he had things to say and he won’t let other peoples distrust ruin his life once more, “I can’t have a good day unless I’ve seen you and not a terrible one if I have. I have felt pain all my life long, I have suffered every
Tony flinched back from the punch he was certain he’d get. It took him a second, to remember, that this was not father, he was
Tony hated that he thought the last one in a far more fond voice than he had any right to. Then again, he was his husband, so sue him.
“They are late”, she complained, her English accent much more accentuated, as it usually happened when she was angry or nervous.
"Agents", Natasha called out, making both agents slightly jump. They seemed to finally realized she was there, "Jones and Hernandes, is it?", she read the names from the cards stuck in their chests.
“Well, then, since you’re the boss”, Tony replied in a low tone, climbing into Steve’s lap and rubbing himself against the taller man, making him moan softly, “I’m sure you can stay for a few more hours, right?”
Hey everyone! Hope you're all safe. My computer is not working and I had to buy a new hard drive for it :( Long story short, it's being repaired so no computer for me. On the bright side, did you guys know you can plug an old keyboard to your Xbox One and write your fanfiction there, directly on the AO3 website? 'Cause that's exactly what I did. So, small chapter for all of you, directly from my Xbox lol I hope you like it and I hope I'll have my computer soon to write the next chapter lol Leave kudos and a comment if you like it, and please don't mind the mistakes... I'll re-read it on the weekend to fix whatever is wrong lol
“They don’t want to miss Peter’s first Christmas with us”, Tony explained, sighing, “I still can’t believe he’s ours”.
Soon, more strange things started to happen. There was Lieutenant Wilton, who electrocuted himself while making repairs, even though he was one of the best engineers they had. Major Baldwin, who pressed the wrong button and ended up severely hurting five soldiers in a training exercise. But it was only after Dr. Kudrow accidentally poisoned herself after simply forgetting of putting on her mask before dealing with some very dangerous poisons that Ross truly started to think that maybe,
Peter woke up slowly, shielding his eyes from the bright sun light coming through the trees. He blinked several times with a grimace, feeling like he had the worst hangover of all time. He heard other moans of pain joining his own and looked around, finding his friends all lying on the grass, hands on their heads , looking just as confused as Peter felt. And then, after a moment, he finally noticed what they were wearing. Cassie had a hat on her head, complete with an eye patch and a trench coat that screamed ‘pirate’. MJ was at her right, wearing a long, red dress and… horns. Michele had horns. Michele was red and had horns! Peter was pretty sure he was about to have a heart attack.
, he thought, frowning. And that’s when he saw it. A huge piece of paper on the message board that almost took half of it.
“Any reason why he refused to go with you?” Natasha asked, putting a small piece of bread in her mouth.
Anthony was six years old when he first saw Natasha. He was playing in the front yard, a shield and a sword in his hands, pretending the big apple tree was an enormous dragon who wanted to eat him, when the roar of car caught his attention. He watched as the black SUV came to a stop right at the entrance of his house, Mr. and Mrs. Romanov coming out of it, looking very presentable as always. His mother quickly came to greet them ― she’d only come to the door for the real important people, Tony had learned a long time ago ―, and that was when the little boy saw her. She stepped out of the car with her head down, immediately putting her hands behind her back when her feet finally hit the floor. She didn’t look up, not even when Maria talked directly to her. Tony shrugged and went back to slaying the big, bad dragon. He knew he should go there and introduce himself, like his mother and Jarvis had taught him, but he just didn’t feel like having his cheeks pinched by grownups. Jarvis would probably scold him later for his lack of manners.
Tony opened his eyes slowly, blinking and turning his head slightly to the side, as if to escape the very bright light that shone in the room. There was a sharp ringing in his ears that made his head hurt and his mouth felt odd, like someone had stuck a bunch of cotton in it. He shook his head, trying to bring some clarity to his clouded mind. And then, he heard a chuckle. Tony raised his head, following the sound, still very much confused with the whole situation. He gulped when his eyes finally met the eyes of the man standing before him.
“Well, when I was younger, I was small and sickly and no one wanted anything to do with me. I wasn’t exactly people’s first choice for romance, you know”.
before and that the only thing they really cared about was money so he wasn’t sure if I was worth dating. He asked me to tone it down with the expensive shit”.
As they ate, they talked about pretty much everything and anything: Nat and Bucky’s upcoming wedding, Tony’s new green energy project, politics in general and then, finally, when everybody’s belly was full, the subject finally turned to dessert.
"I ain't dumb, you know. I don't know if you're FBI or CIA, but you had no jurisdiction! That ship belongs to Mr. Stark and you stole it!"
“I’m not going to lie, it was not love at first sight”, he said, making Tony laugh, the tears in the corner of his eyes threatening to spill, “But now I see, sweetheart, it would’ve been impossible for me not to fall in love with you. You’re amazing, Tony. You gave me the chance to be the man I’ve always wanted to be. You showed me happiness like I had never felt before in my entire life. You accepted my past and made me look forward to the future. You made me feel like I belong in this world. I can’t imagine my life without you. So…”
“Well, I believe I do not need to reinforce how absolutely vital it is that my identity remains a secret”, the woman said with a faded English accent, taking a seat in front of them, “And I will be so very cross if this particular secret leaves this room”, she looked at each one of them for a moment before continuing to speak. “Very well. You have been chosen for this mission not only because of your skills and frankly stellar records, but because, according to Deputy Director Fury, Commander Hill and Agent Coulson, you are trustworthy. This mission is not just about SHIELD security, it’s also… personal to me”.
“You don’t seem all that freaked out by the fact that we were just attacked by what I can only assume is a zombie”.
And just like that, Tony began to excitedly talk about his project, very nearly forgetting the storm that still raged outside.
PS: About the 'legal' pieces in this chapter, I know absolutely nothing about injunctions and, well, law in general, so let's just pretend all written in there is super correct, ok? lol
Still, she opened it, determined to at least check the place over. As soon as she did so, the putrid smell became stronger. She gagged a little, turning her face away from the door. With yet another sigh, Jessica took the scarf she always carried in her messenger bag and wrapped it around her nose and mouth and ventured down the stairs with caution.
Tony sniffed, glancing at DUM-E, all happy and clueless. “How did you find him?”, he repeated the question, looking at Steve once more.
“You KNOW I can’t have coconut. You KNOW I’m allergic, God, you’re so insensitive! So what, I’m not gonna have cake at my own wedding because YOU just needed to have the coconut cake, is that right?”
“Yeah, well, you’re supposed to keep people out, J.”, Tony replied, finally getting up from the floor with a grimace.
Steve smiled at him, “Yeah, I ordered them for you. I know how much you like them and I just knew you’d be hungry. You know, ‘cause you never eat properly”.
“Why can’t we tell Steve that you two were together? Doesn’t he deserve to know?” she asked softly, running her fingers through his hair slowly.
A heavy silence fell on the table as they glanced at each other, unsure of what to say. Steve, who knew exactly what Tony was doing, smirked at his lover, his eyes full of mirth.
“Forget it. I’ll just die from stiff dick, I guess”, Tony offered dramatically, throwing his arm over his own eyes.
“Oh, no! Tony! The groom is not supposed to see the bride before the wedding”, Bucky complained with a smirk.
“I thought about getting you in the deal, at first, but I know you too well. You’re a naïve, pathetic little boy who believes the world is rainbows and sunshine”, he brought the device closer to his own face, looking at it, rotating it in his hand, before putting it right over Tony’s arc reactor. His eyes widened as he felt a terrible pressure on his chest and he watched helplessly as Stane took away the only thing that was keeping him alive.
“You know, when I had your parents killed”, he said in a light, nonchalant tone, taking great pleasure in seeing Tony’s eyes widened at the confession, “I had a whole different plan for you. I was going to keep you around, be the nice father figure you so desperately needed… After all, you were right about one thing, Tony: you really were my golden goose”.
He had fifteen missed calls, ten from Bucky and five from Maria. He knew he was about to get an earful from both of them, especially from his best friend, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He was happy. No, scratch that, he was… Well, Clint would probably describe it as “so happy you’re probably shitting rainbows”, which, truth be told, was a very apt description of how he felt at the moment. He couldn’t stop smiling. He also couldn’t stop thinking about Tony and their night together. And their morning together. And the shower they took together. And the very heated make out session right before Steve left, which almost turned into a christening of the kitchen table. And then the stairs.
He didn’t even manage to grow a fucking plant, how in the hell was he growing a whole fucking human? It was impossible, but somehow, here he was, three months pregnant. Three months. He’d had a baby in his belly for three whole months and didn’t know about it. It was nice to have a medical reason to explain all the morning sickness and the tiredness and the constant goddamn need to pee. But still, a baby…
So he stayed quiet, never uttering a word about what had happened over there and never sharing just how broken and completely defeated he felt. He smiled to reassure the people around him that he was fine. He got up every morning and went to class. He worked on his thesis and he came back home. He ate whatever Rhodey put in front of him, chewing and swallowing like a robot, and then he went to sleep, too exhausted to try and stay awake. And that’s when the nightmares would come. And every night, without fail, he’d wake up covered in sweat, shivering, tears streaming down his face as he desperately tried to calm his erratic heart, to erase the memories that seemed to claw their way into his brain. And then, the memories of the desert started to slowly blend with the memories of his childhood, making the whole thing so
“Tony looked uncomfortable the entire night”, Steve said, ignoring his friend’s words, “so I finally asked him what was wrong, if I had done something that he didn’t like. And he told me that he’d had some contact with
“No, it’s not”, he kneeled in front of his partner, taking his hands, “Tony, it’s not fine. And it’s perfectly okay if you’re mad at me”.
“It’s okay”, he whispered towards his belly in a soothing tone, “it’s just a storm. It’ll end soon”.
“Let’s focus”, Natasha called their attention, “So, we’re agreed? We’ll send Jessica Jones to Malibu to investigate, discreetly”.
“You should call her. Worst that could happen is she says no, but I doubt she will. She’d be crazy to say no to you, Steve. You’re good looking, you’re kind, you’re funny. And, more than anything, you deserve to be happy. You own it to yourself to at least try”.
Tony took one look at the cake and wrinkled his nose. Lemon. He wasn’t much of a fan, but he figured that if the king of Wakanda had been thoughtful enough to actually save him a piece of cake, he might as well eat it.
“For you?”, he asked, stepping closer to Tony and touching his cheek softly, making the mechanic close his eyes with a sigh, “I can do this all day”.
“ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You’ve been in this century for two years and a half and NO ONE told you that you can get married now?”
For the fifth time in two months, Steve was sitting in a medical bed, waiting. The doctor had his back to him, probably getting ready to poke Steve with medical instrument known to man. Suddenly, a nurse came, giving the blonde a small smile before leaning in closer to the doctor, whispering something in his ear. The nurse left and the doctor turned to follow her, making Steve even more nervous than he was before.
It didn’t look very nice anymore. Blood, corpses, destroyed buildings. And then… He saw it. His hands twitched slightly as he stared at Abu Bakaar’s face, as he stared at the many boxes they were carrying. Boxes with his name on them.
“Steve! What are you doing out of bed, are you o…” But the brunette never finished his question because the super soldier slammed into him, full force, and crashed their mouths together, holding Tony’s waist and pulling him closer.
“I have told Thor already. We will search all realms for him. We will find him, Tony, and he will put a stop on his spell”.
“I love how you talk during movies. How you explain the things I don’t understand or how you complain about the how wrong their science is. I love that you always sit so close to me whenever we are and I love that you always hold my hand when we walk or when we’re close to each other. I don’t know why I thought that before, with the spell…”
“Bingo. The press goes nuts, everybody makes assumptions, the military goes insane because Stark Industries is their main supplier and if some nut job is running it then things could go south and then the US government starts butting in and guess what, I’m out of my own company before I can even sit on the CEO’s chair”.
Tony and Natasha sat across from the boys and then, very discreetly, got their chairs a bit closer to each one of their ‘targets’. Natasha put her elbow on the table and threw a flirtatious smile at Bucky.
“When?”. Steve looked at him with a confused look. “When did you fall in love with me? Was it a week after we started dating? Was it a month? When?”
And that’s when a cell phone rang. The man on her right tapped his own pockets, looking for the device, and answering it when he finally found it.
“What strenuous activities?” Steve turned to his boyfriend, worried, “Did something happen? Did you get hurt at the lab again?”
“Yeah, he is. I honestly can’t remember a time in my life when Bucky wasn’t with me. Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky”.
He sighed and got up, walking from one side to the other, glancing at Tony sometimes to make sure he was still unable to move.
His eyes were focused on the man, but they flickered every now and then to Natasha, now standing in the corridor, with a surprised look on her face.
“Absolutely not”, Director Carter instantly replied, as if she had been expecting this all along and, given how well she knew her godson, that wouldn’t be far from the truth.
But Coulson had, apparently, heard him. “She is a normal teenager by day and an internationally famous singer by night. She’s Batman. What’s not to like?”
PS: the "attentive to detail" part was based on this amazing post on tumblr! I'll leave the link down bellow!
They took the elevator up, both completely silent, not really knowing what to say to each other. When they arrived on the communal floor, Nat went straight to the couch, sitting beside Bucky, and Tony went to the kitchen. He was getting close to the door and could hear the voices inside.
, he thought to himself, locking the door behind him and taking his coat off as he walked towards the living room.
"He didn't fire me. The mission was over, there was no reason for me to stay there any longer, so I left".
“Good news is I found our guy’s hideout and there’s enough here for a judge to overlook the ‘illegal acquired’ part of the evidence. He most likely planned the accident and I have the missing footage proving that he killed Howard Stark with his bare hands”.
Tony smiled. “Well, soldier, it’s been so long I don’t even remember anymore. I’ll get back to you on that after you fuck me against the wall in the shower, how about that?” He asked, walking towards the bathroom, dropping his pants on the way.
. All they did was remind Tony of the fact that Steve wanted Sharon, not him. He threw both of them away.
“I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m afraid of commitment. I proposed to Pepper when we were together, you know. I like the idea of getting married, of spending the rest of my life with someone I love who loves me back”, Tony said, taking a navy blue shirt from his wardrobe and putting it close to the door, “Just because I slept around when I was younger doesn’t mean I have an aversion to commitment”.
Steve froze. He opened and closed his mouth, trying to find the words, but having no success. He glared at Bucky, who whispered a very remorseful
Tony saluted her while Steve nodded and so, both groups set off on their quests to find survivors… and maybe also find out what the fuck was going on in that island.
It was almost midnight when they finally arrived at the auto shop. Steve got out of the car and opened the door for Tony, walking with him to the door.
I did it! I finally did it! Sorry for the delay, guys, but life's been pretty hectic. Also, I cut my finger while cooking three days ago and typing was just a motherfucking pain in the ass D:
, Tony thought. But that was the thing, wasn’t it. Steve hadn’t introduced him as his boyfriend or his partner, he had introduced him as a friend. Not only that, but he was desperate to see Tony gone as soon as possible.
“Do you know who’s on Stark Industries’ Board of Directors?” Steve shook his head. “Rich, white, old men. And you know what rich, white, old men like most in the world? Power. In less than six months, I’ll be twenty-one and then I’ll own the controlling interest of the company. I’ll be CEO. I’ll be able to change whatever the fuck I want to change”.
Steve parked the car right outside the bar, still looking worried. “Just stay close to me, okay? And if they make you even a little bit uncomfortable, you tell me and we’ll get the hell out, okay?”
, Tony thought every time Steve even uttered the bastard’s name. He’d go on and on about his adventures with
Steve smiled. “Yeah, I know what you mean. It’s like nothing else matters, right? The world could go under and I still wouldn’t move, wouldn’t even notice it, as long as you’re here with me”.
“You know, how the kid messed up and gave YOU the flowers instead of…”, Bucky suddenly stopped, looking around the table. Pepper and Rhodey looked horrified, Natasha was shaking her head and Sharon was covering her face. “You… didn’t know that”.
. He took a deep breath and was ready to make a run for it when he heard a shot. And that’s when he remembered…
“Well, that’s all, then”, he said, getting up. Matthew shook Steve’s hand and then, when shaking Tony’s, held a little bit longer, “We’ll get him, Mr. Stark. I promise you that”.
couldn’t handle that right now. But Clint was looking at him with those eyes, just waiting for an answer, acting as if this party was the most important thing in the world for him.
“Close down that facility NOW”, Ross shouted to the Privates and they immediately did so, “Activate the Panic Room Protocol here and contact the other facilities, quickly now”.
He turned a corner and sighed in relief when he saw the fridges, full of all types of beverages and frozen meals and ice cream and… a guy. Steve frowned, stopping dead in the middle of the aisle to stare at the man; the man who was sitting on the floor, eating ice cream directly from the carton. He looked to one side and then to the other, as if looking for someone, maybe a concerned parent – even though he was pretty sure the man was at least in his twenties. His eyes turned back to the young man, who looked as if he had no idea Steve was standing there. He thought about leaving, just grabbing his beer and going away to an empty apartment where he could sob about his failed relationship, but he found that he couldn’t move. The young man looked sad, so sad. He couldn’t leave.
“Yeah, but just to make Nat… No, wait, Tony, stop”, he said, jumping down from the counter, but Tony was already leaving the kitchen.
“No, really, it’s in the book”, Tony replied, turning his tablet so Steve could see it too, “My feet are supposed to get bigger too”.
“Oh. It’s a girl. Morgan”, he replied, looking down at the little bear he hadn’t even realized he was holding.
“I’m afraid the spell put on Captain Rogers is a bit more complex than what I’m used to. I believe only Loki would be able to return the Captain to his former self”.
“Can I… Can I sing to her? My ma used to sing this song, I just…” he tried to explain, embarrassed that he had just asked Tony if he could sing to his belly.
Tony had a terrible night. After not so subtly running away from Steve after their date, he locked himself in his workshop and stayed there for hours, just sitting on the couch, eating a bag of M&Ms while thinking of all the reasons why Steve wouldn’t want to marry him. Too old, too stubborn, too difficult, too narcissistic, workaholic; the words swirled inside his head, making his insides twist with grief. He knew the kind of man he was. And he was very much aware of how bad he was. And Steve, well, Steve was good. He was the best man Tony had ever met. He deserved better. And maybe he knew that too.
Steve frowned, shaking his head, “No, it’s not. She’s holding her face and sucking on her thumb, see?”
The young man stopped suddenly and turned towards Steve, staring at him with incredulity, “It’s two am and I’m sitting on the floor of a supermarket, wearing sweatpants and an old Batman t-shirt, and eating ice cream directly from the carton while using a stick of cookie dough as a spoon. What about this particular scene gave you the impression that the answer to that question could EVER be yes?”
“And you ran from here faster than a bullet and threw yourself in his big, beefy arms, yeah, we know”, Sharon laughed.
There were three corridors, each one with a small, silver plaque. The first one, the one right across the elevator, said
The man had little time to be relieved, however, for Stane quickly took a gun from his back, shooting the man twice on the chest. The engineer fell, his eyes already unseeing before he even hit the ground. Stane put the gun away with all the calm in the world and, with a final glance at his masterpiece, he walked towards the door, leaving the room.
“No”, Natasha replied before anyone could say anything, “Thank you, Murdock, but no. If Howard and Maria Stark were, in fact, murdered, then the police covered it up. Stane most likely has some people in his pocket. Requesting those files will only raise suspicion. You hit him with the will and keep his attention there. We’ll take care of the rest”, she said, nodding towards Clint and promptly receiving a firm nod back.
“It’s hard. Yeah, I know”, Steve said softly while they both fastened their seatbelts, “Hey”, he called out when he noticed how nervous Tony had suddenly become, “everything will be fine”.
It was already nightfall when the team finally arrived at Bagram Air Base, the cold air of the desert slipping through their clothes as they exited the quinjet. A tall, dark skinned man was waiting for them. He stood there, in the middle of the base, hands behind his back, waiting for the team to approach him with a serious, if not worried, expression. He quickly extended his hand when Steve came close enough to grab it.
“Gotcha. Well, I’m going to take a look under the hood to see what’s happening. But before that… Wait here”, he said, leaving through a door on his right.
changes of clothes, Steve had decided, with Clint’s and Bucky’s help, that it was best to just wear something simple, something that he was used to. So, here he was, standing in front of the fountain, wearing a pair of dark jeans that, according to Clint,
“Come on! Nobody exploded, nobody’s face melted off. This is already way better than the last time we were in Budapest”.
. He kicked the older man right in the stomach and then proceeded to punch him repeatedly in the face. Jessica winced. He then put Howard Stark back on his car, closed the door and walked away as if absolutely nothing had happened.
“This will hurt, Mr. Stark. But it is the only way to save your life. I am very sorry”, he whispered softly near Tony’s ear before nodding to someone. Immediately, two strong hands took hold of the engineer’s head from behind, holding him in place. All he could see was the filthy ceiling. His eyes followed the small light bulb going back and forth, as if trying to hypnotize him. And then he felt it. Something sharp and cold and hard cutting through the skin in his chest. He screamed, closing his hands with such force that the nails pierced the palm. The cutting continued, and so did the pain. Tony could feel his heart beating faster than ever in his ears. He felt the sweat coming off his skin, the bile rising in his throat as he so desperately tried to keep it down.
The car ride wasn’t exactly fun. Sharon had spent half of it apologizing to Tony and assuring him she had no interest in Steve (which was fairly obvious since she was dating Pepper). Tony, then, put her mind to rest, saying he didn’t blame her at all and that she had nothing to worry about. They’d been friends since they were in diapers and nothing would change that. That’s when Sharon started sniffing and touching the corner of her eyes, trying to hide the tears.
“So that’s why we were contacted through the super secret channel”, the blonde man said as if he’d just had an epiphany.
“That’s not even the worst part. It also says she had a baby when she was fifteen. Artificial insemination. She carried the baby to term. Kid has yet to show any signs of having powers, though”.
So, that night, after waking up from yet another nightmare, he got up and dragged himself to the kitchen, careful not to wake up Rhodey, who was most likely sleeping peacefully in his own room. He opened the cabinets and the fridge, trying to find something, anything, sweet that could bring him some comfort, and then he saw it. He touched the small piece of paper taped over the box, smiling softly when he read the words.
Tony smiled. He knew he had told that story a thousand times already, but still, he could never pass an opportunity to tell it again.
“I’m going after Tony. Buck, you and Sam stay here and keep an eye on this asshole. Coulson, the agents and I are going to the Tower”.
“Your mission”, the Director continued, making all agents turn their full attention to her once more, “is to locate my nephew and bring him home. Alive”, she added, stressing the last word. “You will fly to Bagram Air Base, where you will meet Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes. He will accompany you in your searches. Are there any questions?”
“That’s… nice”, he said, pouring himself some coffee and trying to be as quick as possible because it was one thing to accept that Steve would never want him again and that he would, soon, move on, and another completely different to actually hear the love of his life talking about being with someone else.
When none of the agents said anything, she nodded sharply. “Good luck, agents. I trust you’ll bring my nephew back to me as soon as possible”.
Tony didn’t hear Clint’s reply. He felt like his heart had just shattered into a thousand pieces. It felt just like when Obadiah tore away his arc reactor, only so much worse. So much worse than the torture in the desert, so much worse than Thanos sticking a piece of his own armor through his stomach. The pain was almost unbearable. He took a step back, looking at the floor but not actually seeing anything, his eyes losing focus. He didn’t even notice when Clint opened the door.
Bucky hesitated for a moment and Tony could swear he was going to say yes, but seemed to change his mind.
They all snickered again. Natasha rolled her eyes and snorted, turning her attention back at the cutting board.
Tony immediately closed his eyes, raising his hands to hold his lover’s face, kissing him back with everything he had. They ended the kiss too soon, noses still touching, their faces still close to one another as if they couldn’t bring themselves to be separated any longer. Tony opened his eyes and looked into Steve’s baby blues. The blonde smiled.
Steve nodded with a smile, before turning his back and going to the bathroom to change, completely missing the way Tony checked him out when he did.
Tony exited the car, looking around with a suspicious look. He hadn’t told Steve, hadn’t wanted to bother or worry him, but for some time now he’d had the feeling he was being watched. Whether it was at the car shop, at his apartment or when he was arriving at Steve’s building, it was look he could feel someone’s eyes trained on him. It was disconcerting to say the least, but every time he looked around and searched for the source he found no one. By now, Tony was convinced his mind was playing tricks on him. So, once again, he shook his head, trying to get his paranoia out of his mind, and walked inside the building.
, and gave a warning nod towards Tony, leaving Natasha behind. The little girl with bright red hair stared at him without moving.
Steve huffed out a laugh, putting his hands on his pockets as he walked towards Tony, stopping a few feet from him.
Steve still looked unsure, but in the end just took a deep breath, nodding to Tony. “Okay”, he got up, answering the cell phone while mouthing an angry
“All I’m saying, master Anthony, is that Mrs. Jarvis and I believe that some people are destined to meet. And sometimes, when people are being stubborn, or clueless, or when the world decides to make it difficult, fate intervenes and puts those people on each other’s paths. What happens after that, well, it is up to them, isn’t it?”
Suddenly, Steve felt it. It was a tiny, but very strong kick. His eyes widened and he looked at Tony with a bright smile.
Tiberius Stone woke up with a start, spitting the liquid that had found its way into his mouth. He moaned in pain as soon as he moved, touching the back of his head with his hand.
“I… I mean… If you’re uncomfortable, you know… and if you think it would help, I mean…” Steve stammered, trying to find the words to explain himself and failing miserably.
“Okay, another piece of information about me: I’m an amazing hacker. I once hacked the Pentagon on a dare. Let me tell you, the agents that showed up at my door were
“Tony told me something. He and Stane talked right after the guy showed him the pictures. Stane told him he filed an injunction against Tony yesterday morning. He was probably the one who told the board and the press that he has PTSD”.
"Look, kid... Mr. Stark... He needs to know we found him, okay? He's been looking... He needs to know. It's all I'm asking here!", the man pleaded.
“Nonsense! It is always an honor to be in your company, son of Stark, and I would be honored if you gave me the pleasure of this dance”.
, Bucky thought. He really had made breakfast. Then he and Tony had very gross and unhygienic sex against the kitchen top, according to a very happy Steve, who should learn how to do his morning runs with his mouth shut because Bucky and Sam
“Tony, I… I’m sorry, but I just… Shit. Okay. The truth is I didn’t want to break your heart, okay? You looked really happy and then you kissed me and I couldn’t tell you, you know? I’m sorry. But it doesn’t matter…”
“Big explosion? That’s definitely Tony! GO! GO!”, Rhodes screamed at the top of his lungs. He seemed so happy, so full of hope, that Steve didn’t even bother to remind him of the codename rule.
. He carefully took the note and put it in the second drawer with the many other notes Mama Rhodes had sent over the years, and then, curious as to what delicious food Rhodey’s mom had sent them this time, opened the box. And then promptly started crying. He took one of the cookies, biting into it and closing his eyes, unable to keep the tears from falling.
“When did you find this?” Steve asked, getting closer to the table and taking a long look at the skull.
His cell phone didn’t stop ringing for one minute. Some calls from Pepper, some from Rhodey and Nat and Sharon, and about a million calls from Steve. Tony ignored all of them. At one point, he sent a simple text to all his friends (except Steve because he was still mad at him) saying he didn’t want to talk about it and turned off his phone. After that, Steve started calling his home. He called almost every hour and every time Jarvis or Ana would pick it up. They would come to Tony’s room and every time the brunette would shake his head and turn around, leaving the butler and his wife to make some excuses.
But after two weeks of feeling miserable and sorry for himself, Tony decided he needed to get back to his life.
. And Tony, on his part, tried very hard to smile and nod and look interested every time Steve talked about his boyfriend because, even though he wanted the blond for himself, he loved having Steve around and he was not about to throw their friendship away over a crush. So, of course, when Steve asked if he wanted to go to Pop’s, Tony smiled and said
“Now we wait”, the secretary replied, sitting on one of the chair nearby, feeling older than he ever had before, “now we wait, doctor”.
Bucky was surprisingly well behaved after the whole “dead parents” incident. For hours, they shared stories, mostly about Steve’s childhood and army years and how they had all met.
“Yes, we are. Now, we need someone to officiate the wedding. Preferably someone who’s not ordained because we don’t actually want to get married”.
“Maybe she doesn’t like me”, Steve said in a playful tone, but Tony knew him well enough by now to recognize the undertone of worry in his voice.
“I know my godson better than anyone else. I saw the way he looked at you, and I saw the way you looked right back at him. So let me give you a piece of advice, Agent Rogers… Do not, under any circumstances, hurt my godson. Or, the next time I tell this story, it will be six dead men instead of five. Do I make myself perfectly clear?”
“The young man whose parents you helped murder that night”, she replied without missing a beat, “You think the big rich guy who paid you off gives a rat’s ass about you? If there’s a chance he could be indicted for the Stark’s accident, what do you think he’s going to do? He’s going to throw you to the lions. It’ll be your word against his. But if you give me the information I’m looking for, I can make sure your name disappears in this investigation”, she promised.
“His name is Ivan Vanko. I got a call from Jones a few hours ago. We had a team waiting for him in the airport, but they didn’t find him. Coulson knew too, they were looking for him at the gala. I guess they missed him”.
, Tony thought as the hands stopped close enough to his face that he could smell the metallic scent coming from them,
The shooter didn’t wait for another word. He shot him two more times, right in the head. Tony turned his eyes away, feeling his stomach turn at the sight. Then, he looked back at the shooter, who was now pointing the gun at him.
“Now that we’re alone… I think it’s time for a proper hello”, Steve whispered, capturing Tony’s lips in a long kiss.
“I’m not interested in any new tech…”, Steve started to said, but was interrupted by something grabbing and pulling him by the shirt. He turned around and found himself face to face with what appeared to be a very big robot.
His apartment, once a beloved place where Tony would come up with amazing scientific innovations or just chill after a hard day of work, became a strange place he no longer recognized. Most of the time, he felt like the walls were closing in on him, somehow sucking out the air from the room. Sometimes, he’d find himself in a corner, sweating like a pig, hands gripping his hair, almost tearing it out, rocking back and forth with his eyes closed, desperately trying to rid himself of the memories that threatened to suffocate him. When that happened, he’d feel Rhodey’s strong hands touching the sides of his face, his soothing face assuring Tony that he was home, that everything was alright now. But the young engineer knew it was all a lie because
“I’m tempted to just let her, if we’re being honest”, Tony said with a sigh, “I mean, what they did here? It’s just…”
“Don’t worry. We’ll have plenty of time to celebrate just the two of us later, right?” Tony said suggestively to his fiancé.
“No, I was naïve before, when they said ‘hey, here’s the line and we don’t cross it, and that’s how we do business’. But if we’re double dealing under the table… Are we?”
“Yeah, but he’s just… So noisy and so needy. He talks all the time during the movies, it’s annoying”.
“Nonsense! Anything I can do to make this easier on you two! I know how hard planning a wedding can be for the couple, I remember when Pepper and Happy got married, it was a nightmare, so you can rest assured I’ll do everything in my power to make this whole thing as smooth as possible for you two!”
“I don’t know,” Tony took a shuttering breath, feeling how his mask slipped off of his face, “I can’t tell if those dreams are just dreams. I’m back, Steve. I am back in my head but not in control. Not even riding shotgun; I’m locked in the trunk and all I can do it watch.”
The only thing he had gotten out of this conversation was that he now felt bad when not attending the family dinners, so here he was. He couldn’t even remember what Rhodey had said that made him feel guilty when he ate in his own room, but he cursed his best friend for it every day.
to that in 11 years? What the hell had happened to him that he went from playboy party animal to wearing a ring and driving in cars with child safety seats?
The breakfast after that was so loaded with heavy silence that Tony was sure it’d suffocate him. He knew that he had kind of lost his right to actually fit into this family and frankly, yeah, he had done his best to not ever fit in again, but damn.
”No, seriously, I get it, you got this whole tall and blonde with baby blues going on, I get why I’d hit that.” Rogers took in a sharp breath and looked up from a little shirt with dinosaurs printed on it. Tony counted it as win.
This was how he found his way chest to chest with Steve, coffee cup burning his right palm. “You’ve been avoiding me.” Right to the point. Steve didn’t wear his usual worried but relaxed
Peter giggled now too, probably just because his parents were in a good mood, joking together again.
Tony was about done with all of this when he saw Peter’s bottom lip wobble, before big tears rolled down his cheeks. ”But Papa promised!” He sobbed and Tony just stood there, not really knowing what was expected of him right now.
either, so why were the others allowed to not care for him, but he himself wasn’t? He just ate half an apple today — even though Bruce now supervised anything he did and took blood samples every other
He ignored the voice in his head that told him that if he really was doing all right, he wouldn’t treat a little kid who couldn’t grasp the situation right now, as if he was being unreasonable.
he wakes up, everything would be different. For a second he wished he wouldn’t, because he really couldn’t tell if he’d be strong enough to deal with all of that.
he nearly found out here. Tony was finally able to breath again, before returning an equally teasing smile.
”Our,” Blonde answered strained, as if it physically hurt him to have to explain that to Tony. He had to, though, because of all the words he could have said, that one seemed to hit a blank in Tony’s brain.
Tony clicked with his tongue and snapped his head back up to get back to the heavy eye contact they always seemed to have. ”Does this mean that you know you’re not that good in bed or —? You look just fine, give off the right energy, but who knows. What is it? Coming too early? Only one who ever finishes? Wait, are you like really small?”
Would Clint answer him honestly if he asked about it? It’s always hard to tell when it’s about Clint. He could sit on the floor petting his dog and in the next second shoot an arrow through an eye socket. Tony took a deep breath and decided to just go for it. If it ended up with a black eye he at least knew that he deserved it.
— even thinking this word together with Steve’s name made him want to curl up and never face daylight again — with Steve was so icy. He just couldn’t bring himself to look into those blue eyes for longer than a few painful seconds and being in a room with him made Tony feel as if his toe nails curled up.
”I know you didn’t ask for the accident, Tony,” Rogers said remorseful, as if he had just done something wrong. ”I’m sorry.”
Tony scoffed, rolling his eyes and looking back at the child, who was looking what Tony had huffed about, one curl of hair falling in front of his eyes.
”No problem,” Tony answered, uncomfortable. He didn’t really know what he should say now, it was weird. Standing here, in the middle of the night in the dimly lit kitchen after he had all but fled out of the house. ”Thanks for waiting up, I guess?”
Tony couldn’t hep but laugh again a little, despite himself.He then pulled his eyebrows together, while drinking the rest of his coffee and then took his cup to the sink. ”Isn’t that like dangerous for such a little child?” He asked, looking over his shoulder at
He pulled on the necklace around his neck, pulling out the dog tags and the  wedding band from underneath his shirt.
Still, he had a big smile on his face when he joined the others, all sitting together on the couch sipping beers.
If asked, Tony couldn’t have said what the story had been about. Nothing. He didn’t know a word of it.
Steve’s expression shifted to painfully sympathetic in the blink an eye, mouthing Oh, Tony like a silent prayer.
They sat together in silence for a while longer, till Tony scratched himself behind his ear and turned his attention back to Rhodes.
Was his back aching from the strange angle he had to be in, in order to work on one of his cars? Maybe. Was his stomach rumbling, wanting food? Probably. Were exactly six fingers bloody and hurting? Definitely.
Tony sighed, locked the tablet and all but threw it onto his nightstand. Well, that all hadn’t worked out.
Tony laughed and then just smiled fondly at Steve, who looked him up and down, till it seemed to dawn to him.
He swallowed dryly for what felt like an eternity, until he did what he could do best: making people believe what they wanted to believe. He lied for his whole life long, he could talk his sweet way out of this, he just needed to take a deep breath.
”What did we use to do?” Tony asked after they both stood around in silence for some time, both deep in their own thoughts.
He spend hours working, putting sugar in his coffee was long forgotten and he didn’t even bother checking the fridge for something to eat. First off, he wasn’t really hungry anyway. This whole thinking about Steve and their conversation and the teasing from Sam that had hit just a
He shook his head and started to rise up from his chair just to fall back into it, startled, when he saw Steve standing in front of the glass from his workshop, apparently trying to get his code to work.
Steve’s shoulders dropped together with his half smile in a terribly devastated way. He looked defeated and also as if he had just been caught. As if he was embarrassed of his own reactions.
Tony hated to be told to do things. He was better than his father, he didn’t know how or why, but he was.
He knew the rules here. Whatever somebody did while not being in control of him or herself was not his or her fault. This had sounded really reasonable to him, but now it didn’t. Not really anyway.
Who was nearly the only person who truly never ever minded his lack of lovey dovey attitude. He never even mentioned it. He looked at Tony like he was his personal jackpot and every time Tony caught him starring at him with that expression, he could feel the tiny bit of happiness flaring up in his chest. Steve was his real deal, and maybe — just maybe he could be his too.
Was the outfit too much? Too little? Did he want to show something off or should he go easy? He sighed and threw his hands over his eyes. He did not hate what he was wearing and that was as close a he could come to actually liking it, so it had to do. If not? He wouldn’t ca— well, he would. With all the emotions he had at his disposal right now he’d most likely hate himself more than ever before. But then again, he didn’t really know if he could feel heartbreak.
Flashback or still there? Tony blinked his eyes open and looked around him, seeing nothing but blurry forms. His next breath got stuck in his throat, leaving him coughing and sinking onto the floor, hand over his arc reactor.
47 year old billionaire, genius, philanthropist. He had his heart literally and metaphorically torn into pieces, flew through a worm hole, survived dying. Kids played with action figures that looked like
And he could totally live with that, he just felt the urge to prove to himself that he could do what he wanted to do. This wasn’t an illness, this was just him being reckless, and he needed to show himself that because he felt that little seed of doubt in the back of his head, shouting at him that he should search for Bruce and tell him that something is incredibly wrong. It was just so surreal, he was
Tony went for the easiest solution, he turned on his heel and was about to lock himself in his bedroom. He didn’t even get as far as two steps in the direction of his safe place by the time Natasha grabbed him by his arm.
Tony’s sight got even more blurred when he sat down in one rushed motion; it was more of his knees giving out, really.
Steve stopped talking for a few seconds in which the silence threatened to suffocate Tony, who yet had to see his holograms and Jarvis having anything to do with anything; so he just cocked his head and waited for Steve to finish his speech.
Peter looked a little less annoyed, but still placed the plate in the washer louder than strictly necessary.
Tony just nodded while being deep in thought. He did feel warm and fuzzy, but it could not be. Like the doctor had told him, he was an apple with everything there to have seeds, but without them. He can’t just grow them, right? This was not possible, you cannot just find what you never lost. But there was something. He didn’t want to call it love, but he could think that it very well could be. Like in another world, another time, that would have been something real. So no, he didn’t want to call it love, but maybe. He just wanted to call it his
What if he woke Peter? The kid needed his sleep. And frankly, Tony really didn’t want to deal with him right now. Tomorrow, yeah, maybe. But tonight he just needed Tony time.
”Okay will do,” Tony answered for no other reason than that he was confused and maybe exactly as much of an asshole as Steve presumed.
and even his name deserved all the love there was. Tony felt like he’d scream because of the pain that spread through his whole body. Resigned, he clench his eyes. This is what he’s become. He just waited for Steve to say his name and then scream in agony. He swallowed dryly over 10 times, until he could focus again.
Steve, so what? It’s not his job to make him happy, it’s not on him to do what Steve wants; he is 47, he can do whatever the hell he wants to do.
”You could’ve thought that we had taught him enough times to not climb on things, especially furniture and people,” the guy laughed deeply and then just stared at Tony as if he was something
Tony straightened his shoulders and looked right into the cool, blue eyes. Jesus, this whole happiness thing really got him of his track. He was
There was certainly a right thing to say right now and Tony would give another decade of his life to know what it was.
“Na, Kleiner, what do you feel in your heart, when you see your mother being sad? Are you feeling sad then, too?”
And now well, that was a motivation to all but rip his eyes open, clenching them together again instantly when the sun light hit him.
”What?” Tony asked, his voice weirdly quiet, as if his vocal cords have just agreed that this whole conversation was something so secretive that it needed to be kept quiet and close.
He nodded to himself, about to press the elevator button, when somebody cleared his throat behind him.
Then again this had never been about Clint really, he was just on Steve’s side, and then Clint was angry because he was in prison and that was that about that. But now that that was all over he and Clint could share their normal laughter again, which was quite refreshing really.
He hadn’t meant to fuck it all up. But of course he did. He was so good at that, it might as well be his best skill.
First of all, thank you for all your comments and kudos ! I've really enjoyed reading them (even though I don't really know how to answer, so I just - didn't) I'd love to read some more, though, don't be shy!  Just please make sure to actually comment on my writing etc. too; I know Steve looks bad in this chapter but I have a lot planned out and — I would just appreciate to read a bit more about my actual work - ♥️
Peter looked after his father till he walked out of his field of vision and then settled back against Tony more comfortably, sighing happily.
If he was lucky, he might have about 15 minutes to find the words to explain what the hell had happened.
It always began with him walking though the tower. It wasn’t unusual, he lived here after all, but it still felt weirdly empty. As if somebody had taken all the life out of it. Though it looked the same, it felt completely foreign at the same time. As if somebody had taken every small detail of what made this tower to his home and changed it.
Tony shrugged again, holding his next question back. Till he remembered that this was what he always did, testing out his boundaries.
He tried to go on with his life. Sometime he did okay at that, laughed when he was supposed to, polite to his employees and friends, but when he came home, he felt like he was breaking.
Tony didn’t think he’d ever get used to hear Steve say little things with so much honesty, so much meaning behind it, as if every word he said was important.
When he opened his eyes after a few hours of everything but relaxing sleep he felt a bit numb. He could feel sadness pulsing though his veins, knew it was there, waiting for the moment to break out again, but he was okay right now. Emotions were nothing but brain waves, he told himself, if there is nothing to be sad about I don’t have to be sad, till I forget about it all together.
But he hadn’t been drinking or anything else. He had failed, though. He was supposed to be the smart one; his brain was supposed to be the strongest part of him. Still it had taken Loki only one wave with his hand to make him possessed by some ancient who knows what and he hadn’t been able to fight it.
Just like he didn’t keep all of that emotion. They all faded, but left traces. And also, once you felt it, how could you forget. Once the brain learns how interpret those signals, it does not forget. Just like you won’t forget how yellow the sun is just because you lost sight of it.
Life went on for three and a half days, in which Tony desperately tried to act like he always had. This was much harder then he thought it would be. He lived with two
and focused back on the plans for Bucky’s new arm. He had been working on it since he returned to his lab.
About what he did care, however, as far as possible, that is, was the response to his program. Many people had signed up to be the first one to donate emotions.
Tony clenched his eyes together, staring at the door as if Steve was about to walk through it and answer his question. He didn’t. Tony didn’t know if he was glad about that.
Because the bigger problem was that Steve might have either already fallen out of love with Tony, — and honestly who could blame him for that — or loved him for a person he no longer knew how to be.
Tony just tried to put on a happy smile, putting on a mask, which he had hoped that he’d never have to use on him.
So he stayed exactly where he was, tightening his arms around the kid, who cuddled back against him, while reading together with Steve.
The loneliness faded away when he thought that and he smiled to himself about it. It was the first time that he had actively dealt with a negative emotion and got over it by actually doing something instead of just waiting around for it to fade on its own. He really got a handle on these things.
“Didn’t? Well, good, that would be outlandish and fantastic. I’m just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistake that I’ve made, largely public —”
He’d be the first one to admit that it wasn’t his most genius train of thoughts, the second he got to the parking lot not knowing what the fuck kind of car his future self was even driving. Rogers had the decency to not look too smug when he caught up to Tony, standing in the middle of the lot, looking lost.
She looked at him patiently, obviously waiting for him to fill in the blank but he didn’t know how to do so.
Steve sat at the kitchen counter, drawing pad in front of him. On the couch in front of the open kitchen played the kid with toy cars on the white carpet, always in his father’s range of vision, even if he didn’t seem to be paying too much attention. Just enough that if an emergency occurred, he could be there for the kid within a second.
going back to his drawing , understanding that Tony needed to do this in privacy. Or semi - privacy. Well, whatever it was, Tony appreciated it even though he was horrified.
He didn’t go out; he didn’t pick anybody up. He had no explanation as to why. He had a theory but he didn’t want to think about that so he went with ‘no explanation’. The warmth be damned.
After the third week, Rhodey had enough though. He stomped into Tony’s work shop, telling Jarvis to lighten everything up and pulled Tony, who was still more passed out than awake, into a sitting position on his couch and then just stared down on him, with his arms crossed and his eyebrows pulled down.
Sam reached over to give the sugar and milk to him, from which Tony thoughtlessly just took the milk and turned to the counter. He didn’t miss Sam’s teasing grin, though, which was why he turned, after putting exactly three spoonfuls of milk in his coffee, one eyebrow raised, hip against the counter, cup on his lips.
Even though he couldn’t really place where this memory was taking him in the matter of finding himself.
It sounded like it could be fun. Or maybe just a good get to know each other outing. Then again, he’d actually like to have a few hours to himself.
“I lie a lot, Steve. You know that. But I have never been more honest than I am right now,” Tony chuckled quietly and brushed Steve’s hair back from his forehead, “I’m beginning to think the 8th cup of coffee was a bad idea, look how cheesy I’ve gotten.”
Every day in my life would have been different if it was a different emotion. Point here being: Every fucking thing I have ever felt was just a random fate kind of thing, which I don’t believe in, but you see where I am going, right? Everything had been fake, but this. Everything but
another thing, he was always cold now. But that’s what heaters are for, right? No need to overthink that. Tony was a genius, he knew that this was in fact something to think about, but he just couldn’t. He had enough problems as it was and putting himself behind them all was the right thing to do.
”I don’t know what to tell you, Buck,” he heard Steve say, sounding panicked and spooked. ”One second we were eating breakfast and the next he passed out.”
Steve ruffled his hair again before getting up. ”Peter, just put your plate in the dishwasher and you’re allowed to go. I’ll take care of the rest tonight.”
He was six when his parents seemed to catch up some more. He didn’t. He never knew anything else. He did not understand why everybody was shouting and why his Mom was crying, while his Dad yelled at him to just
complaint playfully before snatching the child off his father’s lap, lifting him up and then just stared at the boy with a played - serious expression before making a grimace, making the child giggle excitedly.
”And? Have you annoyed your Papa while he was bathing you?” Bucky smiled at the boy and settled him on his hip. The boy giggled again and then looked at his father with dark but sparkling eyes.
And now he was here with a stranger with a ring on his finger and a child that apparently carried his genes and Rhodey looking sad, as if Tony just did the worst possible thing.
Tony blinked a few times and then looked away from the footage in front of him. He had seen enough but not what he was searching for.
”Amazing,” Tony coughed and turned his head slightly to see if he could spot the parents of the boy. The parents or
Rhodey huffed now, too, looking at Tony with something between frustration and pity. “Do you really think you’re the only person who has ever loved someone? Of course you feel like a completely different person, idiot, love strips you raw.”
The tower was okay, he guessed. The penthouse was enormous and full with family pictures and children’s toys that laid around on the floor about everywhere. He would have looked around some more but he didn’t want to end up opening a door and stumble over the child or something. He just went to sit on the couch with a tablet, tempted to google his name and look over what else he’d done but he decided against it when the first headline that popped up had been:
And yeah, maybe it had. Because it was so painfully honest, it came from a place so deeply buried inside of him that he couldn’t believe he had actually written it.
His room, that he spend most of his time in, because before today, he had avoided the kid like the plague.
He was sitting at the dinning table, probably spotting his best miserably annoyed face, while he played around with his mashed potatoes. He had a heart to heart with Rhodey, who was the only person who had known him long enough to know what his 27 year old self was like and what to expect.
Of course it was what Steve thought. It was what everybody thought. He hadn’t gotten his Playboy title from nowhere. And yet, here he was, insulted by somebody assuming that he’d go out and have sex.
Also also, I have like 37k words for the Stucky fit I've been writing (and a few other thousand words for like 34 other fanfics and thousands of words of notes for 34 other stories - my dudes)
Steve interrupted himself and scratched the back of his head, leaving Tony to choose his own ending for that statement.
“Howard, he is never sad, or disappointed. He makes a fuss when he doesn’t get treats, but he is not angry or desperate. He never threw a tantrum; he wasn’t happy when he got the toy car he wanted. All the other children were sad when their parents left them on the first day of school, but he just walked away. I am telling you, there is something wrong with him.”
“We’ve had this discussion, Tony. You can’t just —” Steve’s shoulders hang low, his eyes looked blank, tired and so sad at the same time. He sounded like he wanted to believe Tony but just couldn’t because of his common sense.
Steve immediately shot around, obviously militarily trained to be on full alert, but also obviously without laying his pencil down first, which ended in a big black line straight through his picture, “Dammit, Bucky,” he shouted before he closed his mouth with an audible sound, flexing his jaw.
Yeah, it was not funny indeed. He wasn’t here to joke, he just wanted to know what the hell was going on.
Another thing nobody needed to know. They think everything he’s got just came to him, without him putting effort, hard work and for some things even his
Tony couldn’t believe that he actually had this conversation with his husband right now. That was what you get for being brave, apparently.
lawyers— without as much as a guilty expression, not looking as if they had a single worry in the world while Tony couldn’t even face the fridge in his work shop without feeling his empty stomach clench in disgust.
Tony didn’t know where this was coming from, but he just needed to get this out there. It felt like they were here to confess everything. As if they were in a little bubble right now, where they could talk openly about everything and Tony just
He loved to face his problems the easiest way, the opposite of head on. Even more so when there was literally nothing he could do. He’d love to remember everything, finally get the answers he craved, but he couldn’t just press a button and remember, so he had to hope for the best.
Rogers answered with silence, he just crossed his arms more tightly about his chest and shot Tony a look that was a warning as much as dismissal in a way that was much louder than words.
Bruce stood in the middle of the doorway, while Clint leaned against the doorframe. Both looked super tired, as if they hadn’t slept since Tony was placed here, but why
And maybe he had been wrong, because that was a big reaction. He couldn’t really do anything with it, but yeah it was.
Rogers didn’t change the way he looked at Tony, just raising his eyebrows, as if Tony didn’t get something really easy. Tony hated that expression. He wasn’t stupid, that was like the only thing he was certain about right now and who the hell was Rogers to look at him like he was.
A sharp pain went right through his whole body, made him shake more and let more tears spill from his eyes, into his mouth. Who’d have thought that you could taste sadness, salty and bitter.
Steve would apologize, say that he didn’t mean to hurt Tony, but Bucky was just more important, always had been, and Tony didn’t need to hear that. He had been through many bad things in his life, too many to even count, but Steve saying that he wasn’t good enough -even though he tried his best for Steve for
Steve looked down to the floor for a second, taking a deep breath, before chuckling in a downright heart breaking way. So hopeless that Tony would swear he felt it too. When Steve looked back up, though, he just looked serious and sad, as always.
Tony screwed up his nose and looked Rogers up one more time. ”Wait, our bedroom was right next to our son’s? Man, our sex life must have been dead.”
— that’s what S.H.I.E.L.D called it at least. It sounded harmless. Sounded as if a lesser inconvenience had taken his focus off of work, but this wasn’t it.
”Such harsh words, T. You make it sound as if you wouldn’t cry yourself to sleep, missing me, if I was gone.”
When a deer runs into the road, it is so startled by the headlights that it doesn't move for a few seconds instead of running away instantly. For the first time in his life Tony could totally relate to this. When Tony walked into the kitchen everybody watched him with careful eyes, guilt all over their faces screaming
He stopped eating meat, he couldn’t recall when. First it was completely unconscious till he thought for reasons why, he didn’t want to explain it to himself with '
Tony had no idea what he should say to this. It seemed like Steve really believed that he would do good with this kid.
Tony blinked and tried to not freak out until he was in the relative privacy of the elevator. They knew. They
So he tried to smile, but not too often. Eat with the team, but not more often then before. He tried to look as if he didn’t constantly gag while eating his one potato. He tried to act like his head wasn’t shouting at him that he’s
”You do have great thighs, man”, Clint nodded at Sam in agreement, who turned his head back to Tony, grinning downright dirty.
He also couldn’t shake the thought that maybe this was it. Maybe that was the reason why they had deleted so much of the footage. To make sure he’d never know how much they had let slide and just passed off as something 'Tony would do'.
It felt strangely heavy. Not because it was definitely pure gold, but because it was more than that. It had memories attached to it, it was as if Tony could grasp them but then they went all blurry and far away again.
— this was a no no — topic for Tony. Because he might be able to forgive Clint and Sam and even Bucky, because his real self deserved forgiving, but
Tony figured that the thing that annoyed him most was that Rogers seemed ready to be angry. He seemed ready to argue. But he was holding back, hiding everything behind this clam and heartbroken mask and Tony could just explode in frustration.
”How are you doing, Tones?” Tony didn’t think he’d ever hear Bucky sound so serious. He was usually always full of jokes, turning everything into something easier. Tony had silently appreciated that trait of his character for the past months.
“What else could I possibly be talking about?” Tony didn’t make much of an effort to keep the hurt out of his voice. He didn’t think Steve would mock him like this but he had gotten many things wrong in the past.
Bruce looked everything but convinced. He walked through the blue holograms that were flickering in front of the billionaire and took his glasses off.
He guessed he must have been. He also guessed that it wasn’t every day that Bucky ate with them but that Rogers must have asked him to come and help.
Even though he still had trouble telling what was really happening and what of all this mess was actually reality and what was not, one thing was certain. Steve Rogers knew about his feelings for him. And if Tony was good at one thing then it was avoiding things that really needed to be addressed.
And if crossing his arms hurt because his ribs were nearly fully exposed and sensitive then  was that a problem he didn’t need to focus on right now. His hips hurt more than ever before when he bumped into a table. And if there were now constantly goose bumps all over his body, so what? He had more important things to do.
Tony yawned again and then laid his arms on the head rest of the couch, not breaking eye contact either.  ”Yeah,” he replied shortly, eyeing how Rogers stood up straighter raising his eyebrows in question and determination, as if he was ready to pull up a whole power point to answer any question Tony might ask. ”Where is my bedroom? I really wanna sleep.”
It was as if his brain had just decided to absolutely go offline by the sight of the kid in this arms, as if it had no idea how to act and just went AWOL.
”Don’t give me that bullshit, Stark. Pull your shirt up.” Natasha crossed her arms and stayed exactly were she was, keeping a respectful distance.
sorry I wasn't good enough for you, Cap,” his voice was as sweet as sugar, but hard enough to cut steel, ”I am so sorry that I wasn’t enough to be your
It was a boy. Maybe 4 or 5, Tony honestly couldn’t tell. He had curly brown hair and brown eyes and was grinning down at Tony excitedly, little white teeth slightly crooked and having something that looked like a piece of a chocolate muffin stuck between them.
He then shook his head, that had begun to ache again. When he acted right, he could show Rogers that he didn’t trust him and also never will — again? — because anything people ever did was screw him over. There had been a total of like 2 people that hadn’t only seen him as means to an end. He’d like to keep the count like that so he won’t let Rogers come too close.
the room behind his closed eyes got darker and Tony dared to attempt another try in opening his eyes and looking at his surroundings, ”
“What’s it like?” Tony didn’t bother to take the screw driver out of his mouth before he asked the question, only half focused.
“Are you okay?” He asked, so damn concerned that Tony had to bite his lip to not tell him that he didn’t deserve the worry.
Everything made him sad, the past, the present, the future and he’d love to hate the person who gave it to him, but he still couldn’t. He only felt this one thing and he was already done.
“What does it feel like to love someone?” He needed to know. He was sure he felt it. Or at least a bit of it. Like he was really certain, he knew nobody would believe him, but he was. He just wanted to make sure that he didn’t mix things up here. He didn’t want to make Steve hope, just to disappoint him again.
He leaned against the mirror inside the elevator, trying to get his breathing under control, but he couldn’t. There wasn’t enough air in this tiny space and his heart was beating so loud, he had the urge to press his hands to his ears. There were little black dots dancing around the edges of his vision. Clenching his eyes closed caused him to become even more dizzy. His blood sounded so
After 4 more months, bless Steve’s patient soul, Tony was convinced that he could. Grow seeds, that is, or more like grow emotions just like that. Or one, to be exact. Well, he had collected his fair share of emotions, none feeling quite as good as the tiny bit of happiness he had received so many months ago.
”Excuse me?” Rogers took a deep breath, his hands loosen around the fabric, any hint of the beginning of frustration or shock was just pushed away as if it had never been there to begin with.
”Divorce papers,” Rogers explained and hell, he might look mostly horrified, but his eyes were swimming in so much sadness that Tony wondered how he could even contain all of it.
“No, you can keep that one,” Tony looked it up and down once more and then frowned, “But you can certainly go by my workshop some time soon, I got a few updates for you.”
The four years old scrunched up his nose and laid one finger on his temples, as if he was thinking hard before nodding seriously. ”Yes, you were.” Tony could feel something so heavy drop from his heart that he wondered if he had ever felt more relieved about anything in his life. ”But then you went away and Papa was really sad and then you were really mean and Papa said that this is not you talking, that you don’t mean it but he looks just even more sad when he says that.”
”Fuck,” he grounded out, regretting it immediately. Yeah, he shouldn’t talk before drinking something first.
Tony closed his eyes tightly. Hell, he was an Asshole. With a capital A. Because he hadn’t been the only one suffering from this but he sure was the only one making it harder for others because this is who he was. His best defense was to attack and he lashed out.
Tony had no doubt, Rogers’s voice didn’t leave any room for it. He sounded determined and honest, in a way too heavy an answer for a supposed joke. ”Jesus, it was a joke, Rogers, lose that righteous frown.”
Tony rolled his eyes about the whole scene. He went on distance with the kid, always avoiding running into him. He didn’t want to explain to the kid that he wasn’t his kid. Like — he was but he wasn’t. Not anymore. Tony was not ready to be a father and also didn’t plan on ever being ready.
”Slow down, Pete,” Rogers said softly, looking up at the man and then picked the boy up from the floor, sitting back down with him on his lap. The kid was squirming though, reaching out to Tony who was already looking for a panic button again.
It was Steve who dragged him out of his room in the end and made him sit down with all of them at the dinner table. Somebody had ordered pizza in but it all tasted like paper to Tony.
When they all finished up with their food, Peter was already bouncing up and down on his chair in excitement, eyes big and amazed.
Tony was strangely aware that there were lines people shouldn’t cross. He didn’t know why he had the low feeling as if this sentence might have been something that did overstep.
Tony really needed that drink because he didn’t know why thinking about it made his insides hurt the way it did and he really didn’t want to think about it, either.
”You know what,” Tony continued, suddenly doubting that this had been a good idea. Steve obviously needed a break, he was all but raising their son alone right now. ”Maybe this was a bad idea. You can go freshen up, don’t worry about it.”
Tony had aimed for a mockingly annoyed tone but he ended up sounding way more content and fond. Hell, this happiness thing really got to him.
. His mother won’t ever know that he could understand now. That he could feel sadness so deep in his bones that he wondered if it really was just that or if he was sick. It felt like his organs just drew themselves together and never let go again.
Steve nodded at the lack of answer, looking over to the big windows, just keeping his eyes on the glow of the city for a second before he turned back to Tony. ”I bet you have a lot of questions.”
them. There were people out there, who shot others out of pure anger. There were actual people who have killed themselves because of love. And he didn’t know why, but now he could. He didn’t think that emotions could
“You have nightmares again.” Steve nodded slightly with his words as to bring Tony to dismiss or confirm the answer.
by Steve. Jesus, what did it take to turn this warm and safe feeling off, because right now it was just really confusing.
Still, the ongoing chatter sounded like mockery to him. Everything he heard in a loop in his head was Natasha telling him over and over again to not be an asshole,
The aching pain that was muted throughout the whole day came back, so sudden and with such force that Tony couldn’t even believe that others go through that when they are just teenagers. Seriously, how do they survive that.
Tony just wanted to rub his temples and go back to sleep, getting the kid of his one night stand out of his hair.
Tony blinked in a total of 26 times before he walked directly into Steve’s personal space and looked him right in the eyes.
Steve pulled his eyebrows up as if he honestly couldn’t figure out what Tony was talking about. It felt like mockery.
Sam said that so easily, as if nothing had ever happened. And Tony couldn’t tell if he wanted to kiss or strangle him for it. He really eased the awkward pseudo - friendly handshaking, but Tony didn’t really feel relieved by it.
Tony would love to see what Bucky would do if he ignored that warning. Would love to see if the man would lose his temper that easily. He raised in eyebrow at him before continuing. ”Those rules don’t apply to me anymore. I’m a grown up, I can stand up from the table whenever I please.”
All his head was screaming, though, that here was an actual person who cared so deeply for him that they put their own happiness after his.
Steve left the sentence unfinished, closing it with a little 'Please', as if it was a period. As if he didn’t need to say more, Tony would get it on his own.
Tony wanted to yell at Steve that he had no idea what he was, but he fell silent realizing that maybe yeah, Steve knew. He seemed to know an awful lot about him. Maybe everything.
”Eight,” he said proudly, holding eight fingers up. Tony just blinked at him. ”Papa and I counted eight doggies!”
And maybe, just maybe because people apparently believed in him now and he just had to see if he for once could not let everyone down.
“Of course it worked, what is it with you and hating on my machinery, seriously. See your roomie’s arm? All me. I know what I do, Rogers.”
Tony was not proud to admit that he bailed the next second. He turned around without saying anything, all but running to his room.
And the worst thing? She didn’t immediately know that it wasn’t him. Could that even be? Could she really not tell the difference? Did he really behave like an asshole this often that she couldn’t tell when it was him speaking and when it was an actual
Rhodey clenched his right eye slightly. A little motion, nearly untraceable, but Tony fell silent instantly. This look on Rhodey couldn’t mean anything good. He was way too military to fidget or flinch but this little clench of his eye meant that something devastating was happening and Tony didn’t know what it was and how to react to it.
Clint didn’t even bother to turn around to look at Bruce, eyes fixed on Tony, not doing as much as even blink.
“Fair point.” Tony looked the machine in front of him up and down. It looked like he’d just thrown tubes around and hoped, but this could actually be it. This could be the way for him, to finally fit in. To be what his father always wanted him to be. To
“Jesus, everybody knows gentlemen don’t ask questions about weight.” Tony grinned jokingly at him, hoping that the other man couldn’t hear his heart beating way too fast and frantic in his chest as his panic grew.
Tony nodded and walked into the elevator, pushing the button to close the doors, leaving Steve to look devastated on his own.
defend myself is a-okay,” he saw Bucky in the corner of his eyes turning his head away, seemingly ashamed and guilty,
deep and there was no help, and all he could think of was that he was still getting worse. Soon his skin will be so transparent that it’d be obvious to everybody just how
So of course he did what he did best and avoided it. He locked himself into the workshop and the only thing he succeeded at in the next few days was to not fall face first into a glass of scotch.
“There is nobody, okay?” Steve breathed hardly, stepping closer to Tony, towering him by a couple of inches. Tony did not flinch back, he knew Steve wouldn’t hurt him. Physically, that is.
“Tony.” He said then, looking up into his eyes. He looked like he couldn’t decide whether to try and hide his emotions or leaving them open on his face. Tony hated it, normally Steve always let anything be obvious visible, so Tony could easier relate to what he felt.
He looked at his best friend with wide eyes, begging him to answer his questions, when his gaze fell on Tall Blonde, who looked like he was about to be sick. As if he had hoped for an outcome and had
His first instinct was to run to Steve and tell him about it, but then he thought the better of it and went to Rhodey instead.
Tony,” Rogers said slowly, dragging his name out, as if it was way more than just two syllables. ”There is a line. You’re overstepping it.”
Hell, he had known that Steve was sad all the time. He saw it every day. He saw Steve suffering, he knew all that.
”He was planned.” He looked mildly offended, as if Tony doubting that it was apparently his, apparently planned child, was the most insulting thing.
But than he threw the thought away faster than it came to him; he was Tony Stark. He was many things but not
but didn’t comment anything further, “Yes, you do, I did too. But I — I can feel it. And you don’t have a reason to believe me, okay, I spent my whole life making people believe what they wanted to believe, smiling and crying when I was supposed to but this — this is the first real thing I have ever felt in my entire life. I have been through years of feeling nothing and then feeling every damn
Tony didn’t know if he should fear what Rogers will tell him now. If he should be terrified, just because the man in front of him looked haunted, as if his worst nightmare might just come real soon.
For the first time in his life did he look around in his dimly lit room and felt heavenly empty, filled with nothing but sadness about his choices. He looked around and saw
“Sure,” he nodded, and so they stood there and just looked at each other for the longest time, till Tony scratched the back of his head and looked around once more. Well, that was not what he had searched for.
“And since when exactly do you care, huh? Now that you got everything you wanted, I am worth a second thought again? You’re
Tony didn’t know if he was ready to hear it, but Rogers was already putting his brave face, uncrossing his arms and rubbed through his hair, before taking a deep breath and facing Tony full on again.
“I just need to talk to him.” He sounded convinced, every muscle in his body was ready to fix this problem. Or at least try. He cannot sit at home for the rest of his life moping, he needed to get up and do what he did best: find the solution to things. He had succeeded in transmitting
It had all started with him showing Peter the last dot on his drawing and then watching him being excited of the picture of a giraffe it now showed.
”Yeah, Cap, I’ve got lots of work to do. Actually, if you could send Bucky down here, I’ve got a new mechanism for his arm, that should allow him to —”
Tony found his way into the kitchen after staring at blue holograms for the better part of the week, not really paying any attention to anything, which caused him to totally
He was so confused by everything and had no-one to turn to. He talked to Jarvis about it, asked him for solutions, discussed everything, until Clint told Sam sarcastically during dinner, that they could hack J to find out all of Tony’s dirty secrets. Even though it was just a joke to tease Tony, and he knew the neither of them had the ability to actually hack into Jarvis’s database, he couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling of being watched.
sugar wouldn’t help with his problems. He didn’t put it into his coffee for this reason either, but he still lay the two cubes back into their container. He began to work on some new arrows for Clint without thinking about the forgotten cubes again.
Tony let them all stay in his home. Tony built their amor and weapons. Tony was polite and tried his best to rebuild a friendly relationship with all of them; but Tony couldn’t -mentally as well as physically- listen to Steve Grant Rogers. Because he knew what the blonde would say, it wasn’t a hard thing to guess.
him so badly, “This sounds unbelievably, sickly sappy and my past self would certainly like to kick me in the balls for that, but Steve — I am sure.”
And hell did he want to spill all the beans. Wanted to tell her that for the past nights, when he did get sleep of exhaustion after all, all he could see were blurry images without any context or sense. That for the past nights all he heard over and over again was a voice whispering inside his head.
He began to fidget with his feet before locking his eyes with Rogers, who just still looked sad. Hell, did Tony wish he’d finally see something else on this man’s face. Just about anything else.  A smile. Or even just anger.
His escape plans faded into nothing, though, when Peter looked up from his cars, eyes beginning to sparkle in delight, a little excited noise escaping him.
Bucky bit his lip in thought, before walking over to the kitchen to get a glass of water. ”That was a close one, too. His little bottom lip wobbled and I swear, I was about to buy every dog in the shelter.”
“You have a beautiful office, Mr. Stark.” He opened his note book and then laid it in front of Tony, who looked down on a drawn picture of his tower and the city around it. It must’ve been late evening when Steve had drawn it, Tony noted. The shadows of the city played on the walls of the building, making it look like it’s exactly on the thin line between drawing and photograph.
“You’re smiling,” he started when he sat down in front of the kitchen counter, looking Tony up and down and then looking at the inside of his arms, as if he was searching for traces of drug use.
“My experiences.” Rhodey sounded suspicious, looking right through Tony’s agenda, but not knowing where it led exactly.
He looked up after he finished reading and then stared at the frown that had built up on Roger’s forehead. ”Yeah, seems about right.”
“I saw the muscles on this guy, I don’t doubt it,” Tony shot back as walked past him to the advised door.
Tony looked down to his shoes, not knowing what to say. He hadn’t done it for Steve. Or maybe he had. He really couldn’t tell anymore.
Tony thought back when he first felt hate. He had figured it would be directed towards his father. Who’d known that he’d feel hate for the first time for nobody but himself? He shook his head and gave Steve a crooked grin, accepting the challenge.
“I am feeling a bit sad, you have obvious been through your fair share of bullshit. I am also angry at whoever trained you to fear asking questions.” He took another sip of his beer, before he pulled a grimace and looked him up and down.
”Yes, just little things here and there,” Tony said, keeping his voice low, to not catch Peter’s attention too much. ”Really, nothing big yet. Just Peter as a baby in your arms and a little bit of our wedding. By the way, really? White roses?”
