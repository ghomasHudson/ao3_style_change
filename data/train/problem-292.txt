'The doctor said your true heat will come on suddenly, that we should be prepared.Do you think you'll be well enough?' Sherlock's knees were now pulled in towards his chest and he looked anxious and fragile himself.
'They told me the best person to talk to was the desk sargeant. Ritchie she's called. She joined at the same time as one of the internal affairs lot. They're drinking buddies. Thing is I also looked into that reported brothel that Anthea heard about, who was working that sort of thing. She came on shift half an hour after the report was made. Now, her name didn't go against it on the system but there's a good chance she saw something, a printout whatever.'
When this occasionally happened he tended to be cold. To point out the arrangement made at the outset and that he had no further use for the alpha. Somehow, now, that seemed crass and cruel. Actually he knew it was always crass and cruel, just he didn't usually care.
He crossed the terrace, noting they had it to themselves, and placed his glass next to an almost untouched red wine. ‘Thanks. John Watson by the way. How do you know Mike and Molly then?’ John said conversationally. Definitely out of his league but he was going to have a bloody good try, now he was here.
He'd called Lestrade as soon as he'd collected himself. Police and paramedics were now working the scene. The body bag being carried out on a stretcher as more forensics staff suited up to go into the building.
He’d deliberately left his phone in the kitchen, out of reach. He was expecting some report about the executed warrant, the raid on the brothel, from Lestrade and every so often there was the tantalising ping of a new message. Even with John and the approaching heat it was frustrating to be in the flat when the game was so decidedly on.
Sherlock was replying just as Greg took a call. He nodded to John. 'Our car's here. We better do the erm..if it's still necessary?' Greg looked to Sherlock.
Sherlock tucked the paper into his breast pocket and created a dedicated room in his mind palace before calling Lestrade with the news that he'd solved a fifteen year old murder.
It had been a pricey room, more of a suite really. The huge bed was piled high with creamy soft linen, and there was a plush seating area round a fireplace. A bay window looked out across the grounds. Romantic he knew some people would say. Something he would have scoffed at. Not so much now though, with John.
‘Fine. You think there's a family connection or what? This sort of stuff usually comes up when they vet you when you join the police.’
'Did he kidnap you-again?' Sherlock said staring straight ahead at the pool of light on the darkened stage. He needed to break the tension, even if only so he could work properly.
'Anthea left it. An omega who got away from one of the brothels made a report there. By the time the place was raided the omegas had been moved. I was going to look into it.'
Given the wine she'd got through Molly managed a reasonably elegant exit from the car and with a slightly anxious backwards look from Sherlock, the two of them disappeared into her building. John had just started a long overdue text to Harry when he realised Molly's keys were on the seat beside him. He got out the car but they were already inside. Unless Sherlock decided to pick her locks they would be heading straight back down again so he waited on the street.
‘Thank you. Please take a seat.’ John sat and listened as Ms Adler went over the house rules. These only amounted to what you would reasonably expect to keep everyone safe, protect everyones privacy, and this reassured John somewhat. The prostitutes (her staff as she called them) sat in purple chairs in the bar, clients in green so everyone knew who was who.
'Niall Gray, captain as was. Honourable discharge from the Yorkshires four years ago at which point he moved to continue aspects of his work in a civilian capacity.'
He pressed his mouth to Sherlock's and for a few seconds it felt wrong. The alpha stiff and barely responding. He almost gave up, thinking he'd got the wrong idea somehow. Then though, Sherlock shifted forward, taking the balance of John's weight on to his hands. His tongue pressed into the omega's mouth tentative at first but with exquisite sensitivity once he found his rhythm. The position was uncomfortable but the sensation of being wrapped around warm alpha for its own sake, not just as precursor to relieving the agony of his heat, was too good for John to want to change it. Sherlock finally pulled away with a sigh.
‘Don’t you? I know they've got to try something but if I were Graeme I’d take him somewhere well off the beaten track. How many half derelict places full of smack heads do you think he knows about?' She chewed her lip.
Sherlock recognised the female compere from the circus and realised she had also been the one taking his picture. She commanded the space like a second rate Bond villain, waving a handgun around. Soo Lin's brother stood off to her side, gazing blankly ahead at where John and Mycroft were tied to grotty chairs.
John turned sharply to look at him. He hadn't meant to be so blunt. He was blushing hotly still staring at the floor, anxious at what he would see in John's face. The omega turned back to the sink, wringing out a cloth and moving to wipe down the counter.
‘Next time.’ Sherlock said breathily. ‘I believe you’ll enjoy teaching me.’ His hand was steadily moving working  in counterpoint to hips.
'Hmm.' The alpha half growled around his length and he was done for. John came, going limp in his chair. Sherlock was kneeling in front of him, naked apart from the dressing gown round his shoulders. John was treated to a view of the alpha slowly stroking his own cock with a lubricated hand, bringing himself to a messy and copious orgasm. As a doctor John shouldn't be as impressed as he was by the volume of semen an alpha produced.
'He's decent, and a good detective by all accounts, not sure if that makes him ' very alpha'.' The response was carefully diplomatic. John glanced at him with a smile.
The day passed slowly in a sort of suffocating tedium. Brutally boring normally but he was somehow anxiously eager to please. He found himself making tea, running a bath, playing the violin for John. He knew on some level this was some sort of courtship, trying to persuade John he was worthy of a bond. He tried to relax, let in play out.
Sherlock.’ John said, stony faced. He knew the alpha was well intentioned but sometimes he got lost in the intricacies of the problem, forgot the people.
'It's not been let yet. The police said it was fine now but the manager is superstitious. Especially with it being a family room.' She absently adjusted a curtain.
Sherlock stood for a moment, considering perhaps, before he held out his hand. ‘Sherlock Holmes, nice to meet you. Would you care for tea? Our landlady has left us with enough shortbread to feed a battleship.’
‘Victor’, Sherlock said as he approached, never taking his eyes from John. ‘Splendid work, at least so people are saying, not my area.’
John was on his back one hand curled between his open legs, not in modesty but looking for friction. ‘I don't mean to be indelicate but I need it in me now.’ John moved his head to look at him properly and frowned. ‘Christ, you look terrified.’ He sat up abruptly.
He checked out of the hotel and headed to the tube hoping to get a little fresh air during the walk at either end, ease his aching limbs. The train was busy for mid-morning, tourists mostly, some late commuters.
‘You just happened to have them?’ John smiled, they were very different from his usual sober if sexy suits.
'I'm sure. I've realised in the last few days that I think of you as my mate. The bite's just a formality as far as I'm concerned.' The alpha leaned in to tentatively scent him. John allowed himself to sink into the pile of bedding as Sherlock crawled up his body, pulling aside his robe, gently scenting him everywhere.
'How is your wife?' Sherlock said icily, stretching his arm around John and pulling them even closer together.
‘I'm a consulting detective, the only one in the world.’ The alpha drew a breath to speak but Sherlock neatly cut him off, handing the phone back.
‘I can't promise I'll stop asking.’ John stepped nearly in front of him to open the cab door, holding it open as a flustered Sherlock stepped inside.
He tapped out the text, trying to school his face into disinterest so Molly wouldn't comment. The beta pathologist had ridiculous, ill-informed romantic notions about heat and bonding.
They had a quiet interval of an hour or so while tea was made, food heated and served up. It was measured, soothing. So unlike the normal peaks and troughs of his usual casework, working till he more or less collapsed with low blood sugar or sheer exhaustion. Sherlock finished his lasagne and set the plate aside.
John saw Greg out of the corner of his eye hovering. Obviously not quite sure what to do. John thought, hormones making him more sentimental than usual , of the the way Victor had been looking at Greg. He picked up his tumbler, it still had a measure of good whiskey in the bottom.
‘Hello!’ Mrs Hudson’s voice preceded her arrival by only half a second and Sherlock was still holding John’s hand when she walked in.
Raz led them to a streak of the same paint. Buried in a mass of other grafitti on the concrete wall of a skate park. They split up to look for more.
'No, well yeah, but not yet. We need something solid, a proper warrant, everything by the book. Don't you be looking either. It should go without saying but don't be going solo on me. Talking to people is fine but no sneaking away. Apart from anything else, you're supposed to be my demure fiance.' Greg raised his eyebrows.
‘John, while I'm flattered I should tell you I consider myself bonded to my work.’ John looked up from his now clear plate.
‘Do I feel like I'm struggling to stay hard here?’ A rough whisper in Sherlock's ear. He did not. If anything the sneak preview of a few weeks ago had rather undersold Captain Watson. He was long and thick and…
John took his time going back in, looking round the room. He could see Greg dancing with Melissa Graeme, shoulders rounded and eyes sad. She was rubbing his arm and talking close to his ear. John idly wondered if he was channelling his ex's infidelity to look so wounded. Hopefully anything useful that was being said was getting picked up over the noise of the band.
'Of course, I'd be honoured.' He said formally, then immediately laughed along with John at how ridiculous he sounded.
As Sherlock read the results from the screen he realised he was less than ten days from a heat. There were signs too of course, tenderness, mood changes but the confirmation made his stomach flip.
' For your information one of them is about to go into a heat and I have no interest in 'young things' as you put it.' Sherlock leaned in close to his ear as he whispered, a far from unpleasant sensation, and looked vaguely offended as he left John standing in the middle of the shop while he paid for the shirt.
He felt slight relief as he saw Lestrade's car draw up behind the two marked cars and drawing on all his willpower he half carried John towards the car. The omega gradually becoming more limp and pliant in his arms.
Sherlock took a moment with his eyes closed, feigning disinterest, but really inhaling John's post heat scent. It made him want to sleep and not, he was alarmed to realise, alone. ‘Yes, of course. Can I borrow your phone?’
'Yeah- actually no, best you stay away from the yard, just in case your seen. That little pub along from you, six tomorrow?'
'When I find out I'll let you know.' Lestrade said, smiling ruefully. Sherlock realised John would be elbowing him in the ribs at his tactlessness.
John went after the alpha to the bedroom. A little pleased, in spite of himself, that Sherlock's eyes followed him fiercely.
'Helping the doctor Ma'am' Matt half lied smoothly and john fought a snigger as he shifted and felt his cock move stickily inside his clothes.
He took the first of his measurements and laid the thermometer and blood pressure monitor within easy reach by the bed for later. Changing into a light dressing gown and curling on the couch to ride out the worst of the cramps.
' It's just as well, most of them are idiots. I don't mind. I'd have done the same in your position, well I'd have asked Mycroft to do it for me. I suppose I should take it as a sort of flattery. ' Frank Sinatra and giggles drifted up from the flat below.
The Lucky Cat looked innocuous. A shop in a prime location in Chinatown selling tat to tourists, an ideal drop off for smugglers. The shop would allow reasonably large sums of money to be explained and if they had the odd better quality item in the store room well that was for the more discerning tourist. No one would guess it was the real thing among, the waving cats and chopsticks.
‘Oh.’ John continued with a kneading motion at Sherlock’s neck, teasing out muscles still drawn tight from days on a case with too little sleep. ‘So when you said that about inexperience, you meant yours?’
The beta fussed with the evidence bags as they walked out. Waiting to get well clear of the front door before they spoke.
Some alphas certainly would almost fight below you to take control back. John Watson though was the picture of submission. Mouth slightly open, hands resting lightly against Sherlock’s skin as the omega used him.
A glance passed between them and Sherlock shuffled closer. It should have been awkward, Sherlock was much taller than him and all leg in an adorably coltish way but it was perfect.
'I was fifteen. My parents were dead. I had no livelihood; no way of surviving day to day except to work for the bosses.'
John was sitting up in bed, the pages of something being slowly turned as Sherlock ran a hand decisively upwards.Taking a primitive delight in the shape and weight of John's balls and rapidly thickening cock. Realising that his heat must not quite be over.
'Of course. You want the appearance of keeping up appearances. Absurd as that is.' He said, turning to Anthea who looked confused. 'I'll explain.'
'I suppose I've thought a lot about the sort of alpha I am lately.' Sherlock said out if nowhere, it hardly lightened the mood.
Three on Baker Street itself not including the one he'd seen being scrubbed off the tube station sign by staff. A further seven on the various ways he'd approach the flat on foot. At least five, maybe more (he was trying to avoid the all seeing eyes of CCTV when he checked) within the immediate vicinity of Scotland Yard. Four in the vicinity of Vauxhall Bridge, where he met his homeless network.
'IA, assuming they are straight, are secretive for obvious reasons. The thing is Sherlock, with them working in the same building it wouldn't even need to be conscious, just a vague remark about where you're going or anything could be enough to let Graeme know they're on to him. I certainly don't want to risk it with Joe and Richard. We're on our own.'
‘Yeah, I think so. Then when I started to talk to you, got you upstairs and you started to touch me I sort of wished I was on a date.’ Sherlock shifted and frowned.
Sherlock woke up hard, nothing particularly strange in that. It happened every so often and he usually dealt with it quickly and efficiently, like any other inconvenience of the transport. This time though, he was weighed down with sleeping John Watson, arousing and soothing all at once.
John felt the fog had finally cleared when he woke to the sound of Mrs Hudson's knitting needles. She stopped and laid fingertips on his cheek relief in her smile as she pressed the call bell at his head.
The posh hotel theme continued in the room William led him to. A tasteful, modern monochrome with a beautiful bed. The door clicked shut and William turned to lean on it, regarding John from a distance for a few moments before stalking towards him. Placing a hand squarely in the centre of his chest.
She squeezed John's arm as she introduced him to the others. The two alphas who worked with Graeme, Richard and George, were polite but reserved. John noticed that while the Graemes were drinking wine they stuck to lime and soda. There was also a young omega, Joe. He was introduced as Melissa's cousin but glances that passed suggested he was or had been involved with Richard, the younger of the two alphas.
Sherlock glanced at his most recent post-heat blood results. Every painful desperate minute of the three days reduced to bland numbers on a spreadsheet.
'I'll stay till the end of visiting, there's a couple of other people I should go and see while I'm here anyway.' John lied through his teeth. He needed to at least try and clear the air.
' Sally' s been quietly told it needs to be betas and omegas only. There'll be a few complaints about missing a nice juicy raid but it's a safe team.'
‘Whole place was like a fancy hotel. Honestly if you’d walked in off the street you’d never have known. All I’m saying, if I was looking to pay that’d be the way to go. Not that I would ever have to pay of course.’ Murray held up his glass in a mock toast.
They were heading back to Baker Street when Sherlock got a call from a happy Mrs Hudson telling him that he could take John home.
He sent Joe to change while he looked out food and something to drink. Joe returned in a bath robe and took a long drink from the proffered glass wincing slightly.
The detective disappeared back to the bedroom. John put the mugs in the sink and followed to find him on the sofa in his former spot.
When he arrived at the police station, via a maddeningly slow suburban rail line, Lestrade was outside leaning on a tub filled with yellow pansies. Staring into space, gasping for a cigarette.
John it quickly became clear was tactile. His hands came to Sherlock's waist as when they had danced. This time though they didnt stay still. They roved up over his ribs, his chest, threaded through his hair. He did his best to respond in kind but he felt clumsy by comparison.
'He's an intensely private man John. Lives inside his own head, perhaps he just wanted the space to deal with things in there.'
'I'm sorry.' Sherlock giggled drunkenly and swayed a little. 'The captain and I were just looking for somewhere... quiet.' He gave John an utterly filthy look.
‘Can you keep an eye on her out there, see if she calls anyone, does anything?’ Sherlock said, he was trying to be polite, calm, not to appear as if he was giving Donovan orders. She looked at him hard for a few beats.
'Yeah he looks the type.' I think we understand each other. Can you come back about six?' It's my associate who deals with that side. Word to the wise though, leave him at home. Tom can be a a bit handsy and he he's not the sort you want to punch if you take my meaning.'
John just smiled at him but the alpha was deadly serious. Hand extended formally like he was in a regency costume drama. He settled into Sherlock's arms and the alpha led elegantly as they drifted round the room.
'That's where it's a bit awkward. I need you to pretend to be my fiance. There's no male omegas in my division that we can be certain he's not seen. I could get an officer from another area but I'd rather have someone I know, who I'm confident can handle themselves If it gets rough. Not that it's likely to but you never know.'
'Yes, Mycroft's very progressive in that way at least. No interest in gender as long as they're happy to do as their told for queen and country.'
John had barely put away his phone and lifted the cooling coffee he'd bought at the station before the thing buzzed again. Unknown number.
‘I know exactly who that is.’ He could have this discussion now or later. May as well be now. He strolled towards his brother.
John gently released himself and returned to the breakfast, making tea and stirring porridge while Sherlock got dressed.
‘Alphas usually do - I mean, that's all I expect of them.’ Sherlock corrected himself halfway through the sentence.
‘Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.’ John's expression turned sombre but he couldn't quite hide the wistfulness Sherlock had noticed at the start of his heat.
'I thought you were collecting for charity or something.' Mrs Hudson said looking with dismay as the living room of 221b rapidly filled with crates full of books. Motes of dust drifted up from them in the low, late afternoon sun.
They bought coffee and returned to Lestrade's car, Sherlock looking over the post mortem report again, reading the little details out loud. A smoker, an infected cut on his shin, most likely work related.
Sherlock was sometimes surprised that all the people he knew also knew each other-and talked about him. He'd reply to Molly later.
'We'll talk to some more people from the building, see if they saw anything unusual, they must have seen him coming out to smoke at least.' Lestrade said, gesturing at an ugly plastic smoking shelter to one side of the entrance.
The alpha meticulously spooned the foam from the top of a cappuccino as he explained everything else.
'It was a vast network John we've barely scratched the surface.' Sherlock felt edgy, yes he was still tired but there was something off about the street outside. Like someone had subtly moved the furniture.
He was asked about his parents and he gave them a potted history, skirting round Harry in his well practiced way. The conversation finally came round to Sherlock's work and the alpha told the story of one of the first cases they'd worked together. Of how they'd cornered jewel thieves in a warehouse.
After a forceful explanation from Sally a specialist was found, patronising but well meaning. They spoke in platitudes,
He sent a text to Lestrade, just the address and a plea for help. John had pulled out the gun and held it ready,every muscle taut.
He knew he should, first and foremost, be livid with the detective, hiding what he was. John also knew it was pointless. Sherlock just wasn't wired like everyone else, probably didnt even see the issue. He had, however, made
John laughed. 'That old chestnut. Not a problem, how about you?' Blue eyes regarded him keenly as if John were already in character as the besotted mate. John had told him after all, that he wouldn’t stop trying but to be flirted with suddenly, here, caught him off balance. He supposed that was the point.
The doctor smiled sympathetically. 'Even if I could let you into isolation It would only prolong things, any alpha scent. The best thing you can do is rest yourself. When he goes home he'll need a bit of looking after for a couple of days. Then there's his true heat to consider.'
As he thought about the earlier events of the evening he decided it had probably worked out for the best. Molly had met them at Baker Street, Mrs Hudson letting her in unexpectedly. As she walked into their living room Sherlock was adjusting John's tie, making a piss-poor job of it since he didn't wear ties himself. John supposed it hadn't been what they were doing, more how they were doing it, standing so close, laughing-giggling even, hands touching. When John looked up at Molly he could see it in her eyes, she just
'What brought that on?' John tried to look at Sherlock's face but the way they were dancing made it difficult without looking him straight in the eye. 'Why don't we see how we go with this heat first, eh? Won't be long now. I don't agree by the way.'
The alternative involved an all nighter alone in Bart's lab to produce a new batch. There was always the chance he'd weaken, go and procure some of the other substance that would help. He still maintained, for professional purposes, a mental map of the places where cocaine could be purchased in London. There were three within a ten minute walk of Bart s, five if you were less fussy about quality. He counted the vials, Three days worth, enough to get a little clarity.
'The roof leaks, it's damp. There's quite a list if expensive problems. I help when I can of course, as does Sherlock when a big case pays out. Anyway, the point is he'd have given in eventually, bonded to one of the trust funders for mothers sake but it would have been an unhappy bond for all concerned I think.' John remembered the conversation with Greg in the pub weeks ago.
John shook off the post-heat urge to sleep and tried to think if there was anything else he could usefully take to the detective in hospital. He gathered a couple of issues of a forensics journal and a cold case file Lestrade had given Sherlock before going downstairs.
They watched as two well dressed people, probably sales,left. Probably omegas. Most salespeople were. It made sense, alphas had more money broadly speaking and omega pheromones seemed to loosen pockets.
‘Sherlock, this is my sister, Harry.’ John said hesitant. The detective spun round and John literally gritted his teeth, waiting on the deluge of deductions.
Sherlock's phone rang and John moved to go and change clothes. The tone of voice though, quickly stopped him.
The symbol was a surprise. John pointed it out, scrawled on the back of a piece of cheap porcelain. Number code, of course, it was obvious now. Smugglers would vary in intelligence considerably, code had to be simple.
‘Unbelievable. Anyone who complains about this doesn't deserve an omega.’ John brushed fingertips across his collar bones and down his ribs. ‘Can I kiss you?’
The detective left and John realised he had one more to add to his list of awkward Sherlock conversations.
He lay, too afraid to move, for what couldn't have been more than ten minutes before John's phone vibrated to life with the alarm. The omega shifted and he realised his situation was likely to be obvious even in the half light and through layers of fabric. He feigned sleep. Not moving until John had left the room and he heard the shower running. There was an unexpected emptiness to the relief he felt soon after as he as spilled into his own hand.
'Three more weeks.' The tour was nearly over and they'd been seriously short handed recently. Home leave couldn't come soon enough.
‘Beef and black bean sauce. Can't you tell? They're usually very good.’ Sherlock said, playing for time.
He found Joe perched on a wall at the edge of a loading bay near the kitchen doors. The only others nearby were a beta couple who were not nearly as discreet with the joint they were smoking as they seemed to think.
Sherlock had nothing to say. He knew his brother was right. It had been the terrifying lack of control during heat that had driven him towards drugs in the first place. Forged prescriptions to start with before he'd developed a taste for cocaine. The idea of his first properly clean heat in years scared him.
John, holding his gaze, climbed into the alphas lap. Straddling him, but careful about where he rested his weight for fear he damaged the healing ankle. He ran surgeon's hands, precise and gentle, briefly over his face just because, for the first time, he could.
John wondered when they'd become We. They certainly hadn't been We when they were deployed. They'd been separate entities other than when they were fucking.
‘Ok so, here's the keys. Guard at the front has one for the front door only-just in case it goes on fire of something.Good luck.’ Bill shouted back over his shoulder as he hurriedly left.
'Its just what you said earlier. You felt reckless and you got into an ill-judged love affair.' The detective looked off to the side.
She absently picked at the packet of digestives they'd been eating and John went to make her tea without thinking.
‘John.’ Sherlock's tone halted his little speech. ‘That's it. That's what we've been doing. Melissa Graeme.’ They stood and stared at each other for a second then Sherlock was striding back towards where Lucy was sitting. The public school charm turned on again. His smile almost genuine.
'No, but it may be my brothers though.' Sherlock joked weakly. 'I'm sorry too, really. I'm used to working alone. I should never have left you outside and I certainly shouldn't have tried to hide what had happened.' Sherlock glanced sideways at John but it was too dark to judge the alphas expression.
'John, I understand you're going on a trip.' Mycroft said, before some irritated background muttering which John took to be instructions to the long suffering Anthea.
‘I know you didn't but just think alright? It's bad enough being judged all the time for what's between your legs not what's between your ears…’
'I am working, its a little complicated.' Sherlock felt a sudden pang of sympathy that he'd didn't understand till he realised Victors scent was heavy with a broken bond.
‘All of that, yeah. The thing is I’m getting a lot of that already from you. Any physical stuff would just the icing on the cake.’
'Don't get me wrong, I'm shattered, but it'll pass all the quicker if you just come to bed with me and let the hormones do their thing.'
Sherlock nodded, he found this asking for permission novel but he liked it. ‘I know some alphas need additional stimulation to maintain arousal.’ He said formally. The whole situation had a closeness to it, even though John had barely touched him. The alpha just grinned.
'He's my flatmate. We've lived together about four months I think.' The doctor looked surprised and scribbled something.
‘Oh, this is nice.’ She said, not missing a beat and not the slightest phased. ‘You’ve got a client, shall I ask him to come back?’
‘Risky.’ Sherlock stated with a smile. He was letting his hand rest in John’s lap now, relaxing under the attention like a lazy cat.
‘Yeah. I mean, my mum died three years ago she'd be so pleased I can give her biological grandchildren after all. I know she was sad about that when I told her I preferred males but she wouldn't understand any of this.’ McMillan gestured between them at the hormonal fug that was starting to thicken around them. Something John estimated would turn into a heat within the next day or two.
They were heading for the hotel where Niall Gray had last been seen. Mycroft had assured him it was pointless, there was nothing there. At first glance Sherlock wondered if his brother was right. It was difficult to conceive of a more anonymous building, a brick box wedged between a dual carriageway and a business park. Cheap and decidedly not cheerful. The assistant manger showed them to the room.
As the car turned into Baker Street John found himself pleasantly draped in consulting detective. Sherlock's head rested on his shoulder and one long thigh had hooked over his knee allowing him to lazily run his fingertips up and down the inside leg of the immaculately tailored grey suit.
‘No idea.’ Sherlock replied, cheerfully. He had a tricky problem and someone tolerable to talk to. That was enough.
The obviously costly but rather generic meal they were eating and the tired jokes he'd heard as he approached told Sherlock Sebastian was entertaining prospective clients. The whiff of scandal at his firm to say nothing of the loss of face at being talked to this way by an omega would likely be enough to cost Sebastian his next Breitling.
‘I have to get back to work Sherlock. Please don't rush your breakfast. I hope this was satisfactory.’ The alpha smiled politely. All trace of his baser instincts hidden under impeccable tailoring and expensive cologne.
For various reasons he had no interest in a bond but he did very much enjoy what he described as the ‘pure physical release’ of a heat. The effect was, however, greatly reduced by a physical barrier so recent clean results ,on both sides, were essential. Sherlock handed over the crumpled page for inspection like it was late homework, accepting a neat plastic folder in return.
They were signed in at the yard by a young omega constable, her uniform sat uncomfortably on her and she was nervous, eager to please. John smiled reassuringly, trying to offset Sherlock's usual disdain.
At Lestrade's flat the older alpha poured scotch into tumblers. 'It'll help to take the edge off.' He said, pressing the glass into Sherlock's hand.
When he'd showered, changed and properly woken up he went back to the kitchen. Sherlock was ladling casserole into bowls. They sat and ate in companionable silence. The detective eating, for him, reasonably well.
The first two postcodes covered, as expected, the furniture shop and the nightclub. The third though, well that suggested Graeme was aiming for a very wealthy clientele.
It could be a cliche. City boy shoots himself in the head in his immaculate luxury flat after he loses a fortune. Except he didn't. Van Coon is left handed (like John) the bullet hole is on the right. That would be enough for Lestrade but Dimmock turns up instead.
He followed William through the double doors and up an elaborate staircase noticing as they climbed that the back of William was every bit as appealing as the front. The velvet encasing a generous and well shaped arse.
Unable to spin things out any longer, he launched into the usual quick fire explanation, adding in a few dramatic touches for the benefit of two uniforms, who were staring at him starstruck and Donovan who (to his satisfaction) looked as if she was close to hitting him.
Sherlock made a show of staring at the photographs for a few seconds more before flopping into his own chair, he knew he hadn't the patience to outlast Mycroft today.
Not the potential case so much, which appeared to be a lot of nonsense about damaged property at the merchant bank Sebastian now worked for. The need for discretion was mentioned. Most likely just some drunken prank. No, it was the opportunity to show off that appealed.
'I was trying to think, who I know at that station that I could ask. You know without really asking.' Greg said once they were in the morning traffic.
The alpha stepped back towards him.‘That's a shame. I am looking forward to the fun bit though.’ John leaned over ever so slightly, fingers rubbing across the nape of his neck.‘You smell lovely by the way.’
'Yeah, of course, that's what I thought, just checking you weren't trying to harvest me for experiments or something.'
'We only need to see the feet .' Sherlock said, smiling to keep her on side as he joined her with Dimmock beside the two body bags.
The next day it felt as if the case got more complex just as he could feel his brain fuzzing at the edges with his impending heat. John was with him as they traced a library book of Brian Lukis’s back to its place on the shelf. The maddening yellow symbol drawn at eye level where the journalist would see it, panic and run home. To his death.
He pottered about after the luxuriantly long shower ,picking out comfy jeans and shirt, ruffling his hair into some semblance of order. He padded through to the kitchen barefoot with a view to making tea or possibly looking to see if they had any beer or wine. For some reason they had a bottle of his favourite white in the fridge that he didn’t remember buying.
He found himself pouring a scotch, opening up the beautiful brochure again, running his eye down the price list. The language used to describe the services offered elegant but unambiguous. He found himself writing an email.
‘Surely there's no such thing.’ John blurted out. Sherlock and Lestrade turned to look at him in surprise.
'Thanks again.' Matt shook his hand and they both stepped closer as if to hug but not quite sure where to start.
'You can look you know.' John lay back, hands above his head so he was covering nothing for a few seconds and Sherlock's gaze was every bit as focussed, as probing as as he'd thought it would be. He let him have a good long look before rolling over, pressing his arousal into the alpha's hip and running his fingers lightly around his hard cock. It was warm and smooth and heavy in his hand. He felt himself get harder as his fingers traced the skin that would swell into a knot and he could well imagine the white explosion of pleasure as the alpha stretched him - plenty of time for that later.
John nodded and followed the other omega as he flagged down a waiter and led John to a table in a quiet corner. Two glasses, generous measures with ice, appeared. John savoured the burnt peat flavour and the cool glass in his hand.
He pulled them into a quiet seating area off the main room, standing in front of a gaudy print of a ship being tossed on rough seas.
‘Oh, well…I shall have a word with Miss Adler. I’m sure we can find you someone else I overheard very good things about David in the bar earlier…’
He made a slightly separate grouping of the images Raz had brought today. Staying on the chair as he pulled out his vibrating phone.
'I'm not an invalid.' John said, his body seeming to mock his stoicism as he felt himself wobble and his head begin to spin. He came to sit on Sherlock's duvet and was immediately enveloped in the scent he craved.
I'm the event the last few days leading up to his heat were exhausting. Helping Lestrade chase a serial killer to ground in one of the city's seedier districts. Sherlock's knowledge of the back lanes and alleys had been what finally caught him but only after a struggle on the bank of the river.
'He's been frozen.' Molly said dragging back the sheet. It was eight hours later and the harsh light of the mortuary was giving Sherlock the beginnings of a migraine. Either that or the lack of sleep. ‘There’s been very little deterioration so it happened soon after death. He was executed, bullet to the back of the head. He has some bruising that happened not long before death. I think he was probably in a fight. Also there's this.' She nodded to an assistant who helped her turn the body. The bite was still raw looking but obviously older than the bruising. Sherlock leaned in close to examine it.
Northumberland Street was only five minutes walk away, just as well as his heat had been recent enough to attract lascivious looks from alphas. John glared back when he thought Sherlock wouldn't notice.
'Not a recent crime scene then?' John looked around at the newly laid concrete. He felt faintly silly carrying the shirt in an embossed white bag with a flourish of cerise tissue paper coming out of the top.
'That's better, smelling like him is best in the circumstances.' Sherlock said regretfully, breathing against John's neck closer and longer than the bizarre situation called for. He heard John's breath catch and he had the urge to mark John as his with scent, tongue and teeth. Covering every trace of Lestrade with himself. As he pulled away the policeman was watching him carefully.
Fear and not a little anticipation ran down his spine. They'd been here in the last couple of hours.
'I'm glad. My mother will be thrilled.' Sherlock raised a sardonic eyebrow and made to resume the scenting but somehow fell off the couch into an undignified heap.
The voices stopped and he heard the slight shuffles and creaks as they moved towards the noise. Sherlock shrank behind the door as if trying to hide.
He impatiently, almost roughly, pulled the now naked doctor onto the bed beside him and leaned in for another kiss as he hooked his leg around John's. His cock coming into contact with firm muscle, warm and alive for the first time in far too long. A stuttering thrust was instinctive. His hand found Johns length and greedily explored it. It was fair to say the doctor was rather out of proportion, gloriously so.
‘We might need to work on your dirty talk. ’ John said, still holding his hands ,now kneading the joints of his knuckles. Seemingly oblivious to the mess Sherlock had made across his stomach.
A guest, a guest that hadn't bothered with a tie and who could blame him, with that neck. John had then watched him loiter on the edges the whole tedious time they waited on the photos to be taken, there was no sign of a plus one.
Sherlock followed him off the train, he was just passing the ticket barrier and beginning to wonder if his brain was still hormone addled and he'd got it wrong when he caught sight of the mans inner wrist. A small tattoo, a stylised rose, the mark of a gang of thieves who'd targeted wealthy tourists across the city for years until he'd helped Lestrade shut it down last year. Or so he'd thought. He threaded through through the crowd, gradually quickening his pace. He had been planning a quick discreet twist of the man’s wrist up his back and to press him against the wall till Lestrade sent someone. It wasn't to be.
‘I used him for a heat. Not long after I'd started managing things like this. Everything was explained to him but he seemed to think it was all just talk and I would be looking for a bond eventually. Him being such a catch and all.’
‘So, how long have you two been a thing then?’ Victor began. ‘ Sorry-If it's too soon, too private..’
The weakness of all the greats, they wanted the attention, the adoration. He stood there knowing that Sherlock could simply turn him over to Scotland Yard. That he knew Sherlock wouldn't only made the whole thing more delicious.
'Fine. Hopefully once we've spoken to them there'll be some more news about John.' Sherlock was already pulling his coat from the hook and heading for the door. Lestrade trailed behind getting a final mouthful of tea as he picked up his car keys.
‘I've explained to him what I think. I could give him home medical leave but he's no family to speak of, parents dead. It may come to nothing and if a heat comes on at least he's with friends. He has asked if an alpha could see him through a first heat, if it happens, give him a chance to think.’
'Can't you see how a misbehaving omega could be used to you're advantage here.' He'd put a hand on the back of John's chair, fingertips brushing the back of his neck. John, in spite of the company, leaned into the contact.
He hadn't told John, why would he? The alpha was a knot to get him through his heat. No reason he needed to know. John was looking at him steadily now.
He gestured for the detective and they moved the bed as quietly as possible. Easing away the thin layer of plywood clipped to the back of the headboard. It revealed several ledger type books neatly fastened to the inside.
Sherlock knew that Sergeant Lestrade had tolerated him at first only because Mycroft had offered to pull strings at the next promotion round. The beta certainly deserved the rank of inspector more than his alpha moron of a boss. Sherlock though, had more than proved his worth on cold cases.
'No more than usual. You escaped their clutches then?' John said reflecting how far Sherlock had come in a short time to be so openly affectionate in his parents house.
'Yeah I remember but never mind that I took a...What the hell?' John pulled roughly at his scarf, exposing his throat to the night air. Fingers cold and professional against his skin. 'These are new-thats why you were hoarse!' John took a step back, eyes fierce.
‘Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? Sociopath, I’m seeing it now. Anderson cut into Sherlock's musing, obviously playing to the audience of his colleagues.
‘Go on, enlighten me. Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world – you’re quite right. How could you tell?
'Is that why...You've never called me that before - your boyfriend. You wanted to make him jealous or something?' The detective turned to him with an expression John didn't recognise, it took him few moments to realise it was confusion.
'I was hopeful that over time things may develop, I never thought he'd be on suppressant long term but he got it into his head it was the only way he could cope . I couldn't have anticipated the ankle of course.' The alpha stood and threw his cigarette end into damp undergrowth at the back of a flower border.
The detective blushed gloriously, as he turned back towards John and handed him a spare napkin to clean up. He frowned as he wiped at a spot on John's thigh.
'No, the council collect from across there, no point. Then there's this.' Sherlock gestured at a doorway partially covered by the stack of boxes.'Look at the lock, New, the rest of it's shabby. Deliberately so.'
The readings had been different too, elevated yes, but there were hardly any of the huge fluctuations he normally experienced. Then again this wasn't a properly constructed experiment. He didn't usually do this at home.
' My brother doesn't know everything - John's busy.' Molly nodded, obviously not believing a word but not quite wanting to push. She started to open the crates.
'Well I'm on a train so..' John looked about the carriage but it was quiet anyway and he could see no one paying him any attention. '...but I'd say he's guilty- and worried about his alpha.'
Mycroft when he arrived wasn't wearing a tie either but while John had decided he looked passable and Sherlock looked fabulous as ever Mycroft looked like he'd been started by a fire alarm. Anthea on the other hand looked lovely. All the hard edges of working week softened away by a pretty floral dress and a messy bun.
'You bloody know its Greg and why are you bothering me with this when they're about to put out cake.' Greg had a world weary look about him but it said something, something impressive, about Sherlock that a DI came running at his command.
All at once John had kicked away his chair and backed into the wall, raw instinct moving him quickly. He stared at the detective, fingers curling into the paintwork.
When they arrived at Molly's John looked pointedly at the detective. They had agreed that he was to have a few minutes alone with her and 'say something nice'.
As John settled into his arms Sherlock frantically calculated the time it would take to get home. Trying to factor in two sets of roadworks and a tube station closure. Beside him John gave a frustrated sigh and ran a finger round the inside of his collar.
‘Thanks. I wasn't looking forward to finding a cab. John moved across the room towards the hallway. Out of interest, where do I get to sleep tomorrow?’
'Vintage darling.' Sherlock drawled with a fliratious eye roll to the salesman. ' I like old things, things with a story.'
He would have flounced from the room but the most his crutches would accommodate was a graceless hobble.
'Thing is I'm not long discharged. I'm used to having the means to look after myself. I was in a long time, it was a sheltered life in some ways and now it's not just me.' Realising with a feeling of vulnerability that there was some truth in what he said. Even if he did have a Browning he was only too willing to use if the situation demanded it, again.
'It's fine.' The detective broke in. 'No reason why you should have to leave home just to make me more comfortable.'
'Now for the distraction.' Sherlock said, getting out his phone while John held the door in place. He had ran through the options and decided to go with straight out angry and demanding with undertones of entitlement. He phoned the number that put him through to the front desk where the guard sat.
'I couldn't think of anywhere safer for it.' The alpha said, smiling nervously. They were in one of the smaller side rooms at the museum. The alpha had a display case open and was feeling around under purple silk that was being used to display Roman pottery fragments. 'She said she'd had a burglary and didn't think it was safe in her flat.'
'One of the most unobserved places in England.' The detective said smiling, as he deliberately undid John's belt, button and zip.
‘Well, I’m afraid they don’t see it like that and neither does my boss. I hired you to do a job. Don’t get side-tracked. You’re supposed to be the great detective these days. I think you were more use on your hands and knees.’
The echo of voices carried along the empty tunnels, the faint glow and sooty smell of braziers leading him on. They were backed into one of the dead ends, the space protected by piles of nondescript junk coveted in plastic sheets.
Normally John hated knotting. Obviously he liked coming hard well enough, but being joined afterwards was usually just plain awkward. This was different. He was enjoying the cosy feeling of the two of them bundled together, Sherlock's slim arms wrapped around him. The way his skin dragged slightly against Sherlock's as they breathed.
Sherlock placed the freshly filled specimen bottle on the table in front of Mycroft with a flourish.
'I am, but I'm not quite sure how you would come to understand that.' John said, sipping his coffee and settling in for the usual verbal sparring match.
Sherlock cleaned John carefully. Then when they got up, without asking, made tea and toast. John didn't say anything but he knew that this close attention was the beginning of nesting. Caring, protecting, keeping John strong for the exertions of heat.
‘No, not really.’ John sighed, the tension in his body changing. I shouldn't complain. It's for injured ex services to get back on their feet after discharge. Some of lads came home from Afghanistan on the same flight as me, their mates now. It’s just…’ John shifted a little uncomfortably. ‘You get to a point in the day where it's just you staring at four blank walls.’ John petted his hair meditatively for a few moments more. ‘Anyway, I think I'll join you down there.’
John decided if he was doing this he was doing it right. He stood and stripped quickly and completely. Appreciating the way Sherlock looked at him with a hesitant hunger. He pulled the blanket from the back of the sofa to sit on before settling back down, legs splayed. He slid his fingers over his rapidly swelling length. Experimentally, just to see how Sherlock reacted, how he felt himself about putting on a show.’So do you want me to just do what I do?’
'No, Anthea and I will be sitting at a table with people from various charities, well away from you. The idea is she is a caseworker for vulnerable omegas, I'm simply her alpha attending as a plus one. It should allow her to ask some slightly uncomfortable questions without arousing too much suspicion.'
'Some sort is right. We know he's into drugs but nothing we can use in court. Now we think he's involved in omega smuggling as well- actually I'm certain of it. You remember that boy a couple of months ago killed by his mate in a stupid fight?'
The alpha grabbed John. 'Oh now i know where the smell was coming from.' He licked a stripe up John's neck. Sherlock felt rage explode uncontrolled behind his eyes and lunged towards them. On some level he knew it was stupid. There was the other alpha behind him and the gun on the floor, both of which would have been better possibilities for action. He was pulled back by an arm at his throat.
Sherlock replied in the affirmative, remembering as he did so that he should probably try and locate the machete that he had knocked out of his assailants hand earlier before the alpha arrived.
It wasn't that he didn't want that too. He did, albeit in a vague, primitive way that was alien to him. Earlier, catching a thief, that was his domain. He could be charming, erudite. Give off an air of complete confidence because he was, in fact, completely confident. This just wasn't his area.
Sherlock grinned at the absurdity of it, his own brother suggesting a casual arrangement. ‘Would I have to send a compromising photograph brother?’
John entered him slowly, the alpha grinning as he watched Sherlock's expression change.This time, which Sherlock was sure would be the last, was slow and languorous, drawing things out. ‘You're amazing.’ John said at one point holding him as if he couldn't get him close enough.
John walked in off the street with a forced confident stride. A faint aroma of beeswax polish hung in the air as he entered a lobby with an old fashioned coat stand. An elderly doorman showed him into a sort of reception room.
The woman swore under her breath before graciously showing them to a door that led into the ballroom. There Sherlock seemed to snap back into sobriety, like shedding a skin.
In his hazy state, drunk on pheromones, he didn't realise Sherlock had stopped and was looking at him pensively. His fingers ghosting over John's hip maddeningly close to where he wanted to feel them most.
'No I don't like it - that much.' Sherlock saw no point in lying. '...but then I can be spectacularly ignorant.'
‘He's not here. His driver owes me a favour. I made a call when you were talking to Lestrade. There was an incident when an ambassador lost...a story for another time perhaps.’ Sherlock broke off as he noticed John screw up his eyes with some unknown sensation. He helped him into the car with a backwards glance and a scowl at an alpha from the party who had been standing too close.
'Just up for water.' The omega said, trying not to show how rejected he felt as he poured a glass out. 'Why didn't you come to bed? I know I smell weird but it'll pass-quicker with you there actually.'John faced the sink, draining the glass after he spoke.
It was unlit but for a crack of light coming through from the door to the adjoining office. John and Sherlock stood so they could look through the ajar door. A striking dark haired woman in a tweed suit stood on the opposite side of a desk from the waiters. 'So, how did we do this evening gents.' A voice, as posh as Sherlock, bright and businesslike.
A lone gunman then, a good shot but moral enough not to shoot until the danger to Sherlock was imminent. Probably military then....
‘Wonder why it's just her in there. I assume he's glad handing people at the party across the way. Manufacturing himself an alibi.’ Sally said, anxiously watching the screen.
'Brazen, definitely.' John said, a heady mixture of arousal and relief stirring inside him. They slow-danced out the rest of the song like teenagers.
'You noticed. I was waiting for a break in the stream of consciousness to suggest food. Mrs Hudson brought up leftovers.'
'Boy of not more than twenty,got away from one of these places, he told the others he'd get help. Went straight to a police station. By the time they raided the place the following day the omegas were gone. He hadn't spoke to anyone else.' The omega tipped the remainder of her glass into her mouth. Her alpha discreetly moving the wine bottle out of her reach.
He was sure it was coming off suppressant that had started to slowly but surely increase his appetite. It was tedious. So it was timely when Lestrade turned up at the door the with both the lab results and Indian food.
'Sherlock, I've thought of you as my boyfriend since the first time we kissed. Saying it had nothing to do with that bastard. Actually - no, I've thought of you as my boyfriend since I realised we were going to kiss-you remember?.' Sherlock said nothing but smiled, sort of shyly.
Sherlock was reluctant to start taking clothes off in the car, so public with his omega so vulnerable. He loosened off John's trousers though, slipping a hand inside his underwear. The slippery weight of John's cock in his hand was almost shocking as he glanced outside at the traffic only a few feet away. The windows were tinted but he threw the skirts of his coat over John's lap for good measure.
There was a pause on the line as John remembered the goodbye kiss that morning that had somehow ended up with John pressed against the wall of the landing with Sherlock's thigh wedged between his. John almost felt sorry for Mycroft (sneaky, nosy bugger that he was) because no big brother should have to watch a sibling in that sort of situation. Still, served him right for installing the bloody camera.
'There perfect. I need you to look off duty.' Sherlock was slightly pink as he stepped back checking his adjustments. He abruptly took John’s hand before they walked round the corner. A expensively suited beta came out to greet them on the gravel. John couldn’t help worry about sweaty palms.
‘You up to this? There's no shame in taking it easy for a day you know.’ John was close to him now, eyes darting this way and that, very much the doctor.
“Hauls”? You mean you were a smuggler?' Mycroft said surprised. Sherlock couldn't help but be a little charmed at his brother's naïveté that the young, pretty omega did the same work as the dead alphas.
He began to mouth at Sherlock's throat as they rutted together. It turned out the alpha had a sensitive neck too and Sherlock gasped and held the omegas hips with a pleasantly bruising pressure as John worked across the pale skin. John knew he'd been marked and he didn't care, but he felt the need to return the favour. Just in case Mycroft brought any more pretty, posh things round.
They were riding the escalator into the bank's impressive lobby while Sherlock explained the essence of the case as he understood it.
‘Isn’t the doorbell working? Your taxi’s here, Sherlock.’ Mrs Hudson broke into his train of thought.
'Until you manage to persuade your assistant back.' Mycroft picked up the paperback and turned it over in his hands.
‘Old fashioned but it might help.’ John set the tray down and gently pressed the hot water bottle to his stomach. It did help.
Sebastian had been one of the the first alphas he’d used after he decided to start managing his heats this way. Sherlock hadn't yet refined the process and though he had been clear about it being a one time only Sebastian hadn't taken it in. It became obvious that Sebastian had assumed a successful heat spent together would lead to something more and pretty much implied that a junkie like Sherlock should be grateful have him. It didn’t help that their parents knew each other, moved in the same old money circles.
'Like you would expect, pissed off he's not involved. He seemed to get a bit protective as well.' John had hated himself a little for being pleased that he had this effect on his flatmate.
A plume of smoke in the furthest corner of the otherwise empty terrace. He looked closer. It was coming from a bundle of dark fabric. A halo of dark hair, frizzy in the damp, was just visible above an upturned collar. It was him.
“Ah,” Sherlock said briskly, pulling out his scarf from somewhere inside the pockets of his coat and winding it about his neck, busying himself with tying it just so. “Yes. My Gift. Technically. But Gifts such as mine do not fabricate what it sees and assimilates. It helps me make sense of the evidence, but I have to have the evidence in the first place.”
“Old man Watson,” a voice crackled into his ear, and John grinned as he recognised Greg’s teasing voice on the other end of the line. “Stop doing calisthenics. There’s really nothing you can do to make arthritis go away at this late age.”
“Mutually … pleasing …” John shook his head, his brain seemingly stuck on a loop; now nothing was making sense at all. “But … I was going to rent it.”
“A pint. Chips. Whatever. You haven’t eaten more than a bite of my toast this morning, don’t think I haven’t noticed.” Sherlock snorted. John’s preoccupation with his eating and drinking habits bordered on the ridiculous. “You’re like a bloody gazelle, all legs and arms.”
“Yes. Don’t pretend you haven’t met him. Although to be honest, if I’d met him for the first time I’d try to pretend I haven’t either.” When John did not respond to that statement, he added, with a touch of irritation, “Mycroft. I’m talking about Mycroft Holmes. My older brother.”
“You.” John cut in, loud enough to be heard over Mrs. Hudson’s squawks, and she immediately fell silent, her eyes wide. “The other night. That was you.”
Sherlock’s lips twitched as though he was trying hard not to smile. “Not in the car. We’ll follow instead; send me the exact address.”
“I wouldn’t have to do that if you simply answered my phone calls or responded to my messages, Sherlock,” Mycroft replied smoothly from across him, watching Sherlock as he settled himself.
Apologies for the mega-delay for this one; lots of things have come up in recent weeks and I lost the thread of my own narrative. I've resolved to get back into the groove, though, so I hope that I can continue posting as regularly as I used to from henceforth.
“I was trying to find out the combustion rate and strength of hexamethylenetetramine once exposed to paraformaldehyde and a source of heat; apparently it takes no more than five seconds and, under certain conditions of enclosure, could create a small explosion.” Sherlock shrugged and looked back down at the bowl, prodding it with his extinguished blowtorch. “Besides, you were being boring.”
John looked up from the folder he had just been handed without opening it, tapped it absently on his thigh. “Alright … so you are telling me that this network … has the British government worried?”
The man chuckled, a deep, rich sound that sent a spark down John’s spine. “Well spotted, Captain Watson.” He looked at John again, and with this new half-light, his eyes seemed more luminous and impossible than before. “I am here under duress. I have been made to understand that I would suffer great consequences if I were to find alternate enjoyment tonight, so –” He swept large hands to indicate their whole space, “—here I am.”
John came to a stop in front of his target room, looking around to see if the reinforcements that Lestrade had sent in were anywhere to be found. Finding no one else in the corridor, John tentatively put an ear to the door’s surface to try and discern the conversation within; he heard a few terse unintelligible mumblings, and then a female voice, high and hoarse with fear, said clearly: “Please, for the love of God, I’m telling you – we are not who you think we are!”
John grinned at Sherlock, a silent thanks. “Or he could have gotten lucky and blown your skull open. Ever thought of that?”
The first thing that struck John the moment he rushed into the room was the impossible amount of light that seemed to be blazing. A strange wavering in the air that reminded him of the desert haze at noon stood between him and three well-dressed individuals – and when the wavering solidified for a split second, apparently distracted by his sudden appearance, John’s attention zeroed in on the bulky vest strapped to the chest of a faceless man.
“A relative has spirited the boy away, which was why there were no clues nor struggle to speak of. Highest probability would be mother, since she wasn’t mentioned. Father is most likely an alcoholic, possibly has abusive tendencies, but he can’t have that leaking all over the press, he’d lose business – therefore, mother trying to save her child, father trying to save face. Tedious. Next.”
The unmistakable sound of an explosion rang in John’s ears, and he was rolling low on the ground and calling on his shield before he even realised he was awake. His heart hammered loudly in his chest and his head spun; sputtering, he inhaled the acrid odour of smoke – smoke, ash, sand, burnt flesh …
The government official nodded somberly. “Ah. Yes. My health.” He sat down on the chair opposite John’s, leant the umbrella against it, then took a quick sip of his drink. “As you very well know, Captain, my health has been under grave threat.”
“You mean … you were serious?” John said, slightly bemused, crossing his arms as he watched Sherlock whirl about, gathering gloves, keys, and his mobile phone. “I mean, about me coming with you? That wasn't just … I don't know, proving a point?”
The fact of the matter was, Sherlock could watch John Watson do just about anything – sleeping, eating, typing (even if his two-fingered technique often drove Sherlock crazy), making tea – anything at all, and Sherlock would, and could, watch with the same level of interest and intrigue as, say, finding out how paint reacts when combined with fatty tissue and hydrochloric acid. Or maybe calcium hypochlorite with brake fluid. Not that watching John was explosive, but still.
“Mate, the whole bloody business makes me wish I was back in Afghanistan, and that’s saying something.” John shook his head as he fixed a critical eye towards the back of the crowd, watching the bushes and the assorted frippery that seemed to always accompany this level of ostentation, searching for anything that seemed out of place – after all, he may not be perfectly happy with his current assignment, but it went against the grain for him to let his guard down. Seeing nothing that aroused his suspicion at that point, John then looked towards the well-lit house, quickly but methodically doing a visual scan of every floor. Almost all the windows were empty, except for one set on the second floor where three figures were sharply silhouetted, all of them standing rather still, likely in conversation.
As soon as Dimmock’s steps faded away, Sherlock jumped up from his couch, smiling with the kind of delight that most people would associate with children opening Christmas presents. “Yes! Brilliant!” He strode out briefly to the landing, still smiling, and returned shortly with a blue cashmere scarf that he now began to arrange about his neck. “A case, John! Come on!”
more than he had bargained for when he stepped into the library. “You want me to pretend to need a flat, share in the rent, practice medicine – which, by the way, I haven’t done in
“A Gift for observing. I’ve never heard of that, and I’ve met a lot of people with … er, exotic Gifts in my time.” John shook his head. “Amazing.”
John chuckled. “After I dressed up in a tux for them? No way.” He turned back in time to see the tell-tale silver lights of Gifts now being called to use, some stronger than others. “Alright then, boys. Watch the grounds. Looks like the wheeling and dealing has begun.”
For anyone who might still be following this little tale, I apologize for how long this chapter took. I hope its length helps to make up for my lateness!
Sherlock’s annoyance over his brother’s insufferable nosiness – alongside a sense of something else that he did not care to examine too closely at the moment – lingered until he managed to open the pub doors; there he was immediately welcomed by such a blast of heat, noise, and general
As soon as John’s bum touched his seat, Sherlock leant forward, steepling his fingers under his chin, looking at John as if he were some sort of puzzle to be solved. “So. Doctor Watson. Or Captain Watson, whichever you prefer.”
Decision made, Sherlock picked his way towards the bar where John sat, and when he finally managed to get around a large crowd of clearly inebriated teenagers (Sherlock did think that the granting of legal age shouldn’t have to coincide with the official registration of Gifts at eighteen, but then he had a special fondness for any law that helped him get from under his brother’s thumb as soon as he possibly could, so he kept his opinion on that private) he saw that John was actually engaged in conversation with a silver-haired man in a hastily-slapped together suit and tie. Sherlock frowned at the man, briefly consulting his Mind Palace for the list of John’s army comrades and secret service colleagues since this man obviously had been in one or both, but was only able to pull up a last name – someone named Lestrade, apparently. Ah, the one who played rugby with John, the one that Inspector Dimmock did not want to see near a field.
“I’d rather not have any decapitations at all, serial or otherwise, if it’s all the same to you,” John said mildly as he reached forward to pick up the papers where he had left them an hour ago, shaking it out as he opened it and quickly perused the contents. “Here. Boy missing from his home in Newcastle, reported by his businessman father; no clues as to where he had gone, no struggle apparent -"
He lifted his hand to use the brass knocker, but even before he could grasp the metal handle the door flew open, revealing an elderly woman in a flowered apron and a wide smile. “Oh, Doctor Watson! You’re here!”
Second: to all those who have been faithfully reading and commenting -- you guys are the absolute best. You are the kind of people who keep those of us who write going! Thank you, and I hope you like this newest installment!
“He goes with me. That’s my condition. Take it or leave it.” Sherlock shrugged. “Or you can solve it on your own, for once.”
The wail of police sirens pierced the relative quiet of Baker Street, blue and red lights flashing across the windows; John winced at the suddenness of the sound, instinctively turning away from Sherlock as he heard the front door open and close in quick succession and beginning to call on his shield out of reflex.
“Same difference.” Sherlock finally stood up, discarding his tools on the table carelessly and walking slowly towards John, his gaze steady. “And as for me … I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end … would that bother you? Flat mates should know the worst about each other, after all.”
Sherlock was nowhere to be found, strangely enough, when John finally made it up the seventeen steps to his apartment.
John hadn’t thought that it was possible for Mycroft Holmes’ eyebrow to go any higher into his hairline, but apparently it was; he looked as if he was either very impressed with John’s gumption or was about to call in the SIS to get rid of John’s body. “That was … rather astute of you, Captain Watson.”
The girl’s face swivelled towards John’s voice, and Sherlock felt a jolt of surprise – while her eyes continued to stream with tears and her voice shook with her sobs, her face remained completely expressionless. “No, no, no,” she said. “Not you. N-not … you …”
The servant ushered John into a long corridor, flanked by rows upon rows of portraits, every one of their occupants looking grim and uncomfortable. It made John shiver inwardly: he had never been a fan of old paintings, and often – in a fit of fancy – thought they were drawn specifically to make one feel like a pair of eyes were on them, for all of eternity.
As soon as Mycroft handed him the folder, John walked briskly towards one of the long tables that occupied the middle of the library. He flipped it open and saw once more the surveillance photo of Alex Hughes. There were quite a number of documents that followed it; much was redacted, but from them he more or less understood Hughes’ dangerous nature: a Gift for concealment that made him an effective assassin, and a deadly ability to wield a number of physical weapons that got him at least five high-profile kills before his last, fatal attempt.
Mycroft smiled thinly. “Worried is an understatement.” He paused, frowning. “To be precise, we who belong to the government are not just worried for ourselves; after all, we have watchers, trackers, investigators, and even our own protectors. But the thing is that this group does not only target us. Even worse, it targets our families.”
“Yes. Everything I need to remember is stored in my Mind Palace; that way I do not forget anything.” Sherlock put the torch down and began to sniff the block as he spoke. “As I was saying, I had come out of my Mind Palace and you were asleep, so we could not continue our discourse even if I had already come to a mutually pleasing decision. What else was I supposed to do?”
“Oh, yes, but that’s already occupied.” Mrs. Hudson rummaged through her pockets quickly, then triumphantly fished out a set of keys. “A-ha! Here we go. Come on, Dr. Watson, let’s go visit 221C.”
John’s mind now went blissfully blank as he watched Sherlock’s movements, sinuous and graceful as a prowling cat, and somehow found that he could not refuse him anything. After all, a voice at the back of his brain helpfully supplied, a little music never hurt anyone, and if Sherlock didn’t want to chat, the silence would probably be
Sherlock’s grin faded. “A clinic? Please. You haven’t even practiced your learned profession since you came back. Besides which you are already employed by the British Security Forces --”
John’s own protector instincts reared at the thought. “Bloody bastards. How do you know this? Threatening letters, anonymous material ...?”
As soon as John mentioned Sherlock’s name, however, the girl stiffened. “Sherlock,” she breathed, ceasing her struggles completely and whirling around despite John’s efforts. “Sherlock Holmes. You.
to be something John wasn’t telling him, the real reason why he was at Baker Street. That he was here at all did not follow any logic.
John blinked. “Your own protector? But – don’t you already have Anthea? I’ve heard she’s a powerful one, and younger –”
The taller man looked at him, his lips quirking into a small smile. “Excellent. Follow me upstairs, then, Captain, if it’s convenient. And if it isn’t … come upstairs anyway.”
“And knowing my brother, he most likely gave you a job. Something to do with monitoring me, and the pay would have been stupendously large to get you to agree. Mycroft thinks money solves
“You know, I find it strange that you seem to be indifferent to my problem,” Mycroft said then, an odd note in his voice that John could not immediately place. Regret? Sympathy? “After all, you too, have a sister whom you worry about, all the time.”
“Yes, of course.” John answered, and in his mind’s eye he saw a cloud of ash, billowing in the strong desert wind. “Far … too much.”
Sherlock turned away in a dramatic swish of coat, and John couldn't help but follow his every movement with his eyes. He turned to Mrs. Hudson, who was watching him rather bemusedly. “You must be wondering …”
“Y-yes,” John managed, feeling oddly dazed. Sherlock was about an arm’s length away from him now, and he was coming closer, still closer …
“Your brother?” John asked, frowning at the paper blindly. “Why not just gather your family within the manse and keep them there until this thing has been solved and those behind it are in jail?”
“I don’t even want to dare.” Shaking his head, he refolded the piece of paper – thankfully still unscathed – and slid it back into the envelope, closing the flap and leaning forward to hand it back to Mycroft. “With all due respect, I think I shall have to say no.”
“Everything I have done, I’ve done to keep you safe, whether you believe it or not,” Mycroft said tightly. “You
Undeterred, John continued his slow approach; the girl stood rooted to the spot, tightly coiled tension clearly writ in the lines of her body. Sherlock sensed, rather than saw, Lestrade move a few steps to the left, away now from Nathan and the rest of the crowd; accordingly, Sherlock moved to the right, directly in John’s line of sight, creating a better net of support for John in case she decided to bolt.
Lestrade guffawed loudly. “Oh my God, this is precious. You got the missus worried, Cap! Told you to text him!”
“Retirement?” Greg chuckled humourlessly. “Wasn’t retirement you were heading for, honestly. You didn’t see the rubble we had to dig through to get to you. Sure, you kept the bigwigs safe, but if you hadn’t been able to sustain your protective dome even when you’d been knocked out, there’d have been nothing for us to get to.”
The case that had baffled Dimmock and his team took the rest of the day to close. Sherlock had taken a single look at the victim and immediately deduced that she had been forced to take the poisoned pills – information that he had gathered, apparently, from observations regarding her clothing, her jewellery, and a missing mobile phone – and led them unerringly to the suspect. Unfortunately, the said suspect – a murderous cabbie who fancied himself genius enough to elude most of Scotland Yard’s attentions by disguising his kills as suicides – had taken exception to being brought to prison and decided that it was a good day for a rather spectacular chase across London’s rooftops and through some very surprised households. So it was that even with Sherlock's uncanny mastery of London’s pathways and practically half of Dimmock’s force, it took them a while to corner him, and when they did, their quarry had decided to use the gun he held in his hands to shoot the nearest target, who happened to be Sherlock.
a doctor,” John said, straightening his shoulders and feeling rather defensive. “I am a doctor, and a Captain, both.”
Instinctively, John swept his right arm in a wide arc, finishing with an open palm, throwing up a shield so strong and wide that the three dignitaries were pushed backwards while the faceless man slid away from them for a few inches, and was now within John’s reach. Thoroughly distracted from his purpose now, the man solidified completely and whirled around to face John, and John had a fleeting impression of masks and blinking lights and a cruel twist of lips before he realised that the assassin was already reaching for a button on his Semtex-studded vest.
John frowned, completely unsettled as he stared at the document. He had just been played, he knew, but the worst part was that he didn’t know exactly
Sure now that John had gone back to sleep, Sherlock straightened himself out on the couch and steepled his fingers under his chin, resuming his observation. Sherlock had been absolutely certain that John’s appearance at Baker Street was at the behest of his meddling sibling: paid handsomely and therefore coerced to tolerate Sherlock’s behaviour in close quarters even as he watched over him, no doubt propelled by Mycroft’s ludicrous belief that Sherlock had no ability to protect himself from enemies, whether personal or by proxy. That the hero who had saved one Holmes would appear so soon at another’s home was too much to be considered a coincidence, and Sherlock had absolutely no faith in coincidences.
Huffing with surprise and exertion, John looked up to meet Sherlock’s eyes over the girl’s shoulder. “Sherlock,” he managed between panting breaths, “Could you – maybe hold – I can’t –”
Mycroft nodded. “And fortuitous timing it was, too. A second too late and Hughes would have detonated the bomb, and we would all – including the people in the garden whom you selflessly protected by enclosing the bomber within your shield, despite the damage it would have done you – be dust by now.”
he scolded himself even as he glanced surreptitiously up at Sherlock’s face, but the other man didn’t seem to have noticed the sudden turn of John’s thoughts and looked to be deep in his own. John heaved a small sigh of relief and, determined to keep his mind on the business at hand, finally decided to just settle down into the chair to await judgment, busying himself with studying the wall pattern just to occupy his mind. It was surprisingly easy, noting the curling patterns and the way it gave off a homey, if slightly claustrophobic, atmosphere when it was lit by the late morning sun, dust motes dancing slowly through the air. Besides, the chintz really
see a counsellor, it was your – what, third appointment today? That’s why you left your job, you’ve been told that to win either wife back –”
For a few beats Sherlock stared at him, an unreadable expression on his face. John braced himself for the inevitable questions that he usually got from people who happened to be around him whenever he had flashbacks, but to his surprise Sherlock simply turned away and shrugged, looking up at the window through which the cabbie had hurled himself. “The man’s hand was shaking. A killer, yes, but a passive one, not acclimatised to holding such a weapon.” He looked back at John with an air of determined nonchalance. “At the worst he would have clipped my ear and given me a terrible haircut.”
At that, John turned towards the gates and flipped the perched night-vision cameras the double bird, knowing that Greg and the rest of the government security detail on duty were watching. True enough, he heard Greg guffaw loudly, the sound coming over scratchy and distorted over the wires.
Sherlock inclined his head, a gesture that reminded John forcefully of Mycroft. “Indeed, Doctor Watson. Or should I say …
asking is for you to be in my personal employ. I need a protector like you: loyal, honest, and ready to do what it takes to get the job done.”
John looked down and blinked. There was a carpet at his feet – a red Oriental carpet. What was a carpet doing in the –
“Hang on,” John finally managed, frowning and holding a finger up in a commanding gesture. Despite himself, Sherlock fell quiet; John very rarely trotted out his ‘Captain Watson’ voice, and, like every instance in which he would use his Gift, the change that came over John was nothing short of remarkable and, in Sherlock’s opinion, always worth witnessing. “Greg, you hadn’t told me this. You’ve left the service as well?”
“Yes. Can’t seem to get anyone interested in it, to be honest. It’s the mould, I expect. Curse of basements.” She stopped in front of a door that was further protected by an iron gate and began to unlock it. “But don’t worry. If you decide you like it, I’ll call on my neighbour Mrs. Turner. Her Gift is in cleaning; she’ll have it all spic-and-span in a trice, I’m sure.”
John closed his eyes briefly, ran a hand through his hair, then got up. “I’ve no idea. But here’s one – how about coming down to the pub with me?”
to be part of a case. It had been almost a week since he had hatched his new plan of action, and the waiting was pure torture. “And what use are these criminals if they can’t even come up with something interesting?”
The girl looked down at Sherlock’s hand, then back up to meet his eyes. “Wrong answer, Sherlock,” she whispered, slightly sing-song, but for a split-second Sherlock thought he saw a look of sad resignation in the depth of her flat irises before a sharp, unbearable brightness began to spill from her hands, spreading down and outwards onto the ground beneath her.
to prove a point to anyone,” Sherlock said with enough disdain that convinced John that he was, actually, proving a point despite anything he said to the contrary. “Of course I was serious. I only ever am.” So saying he swept out of the door without so much as a look back to make sure that John was following, as if he were certain that he would.
The young man wrung his hands in supplication, looking around at the surprised crowd. “Help, someone, please –”
Three months, one week, and five days, Sherlock mused, now running his eyes over John’s sleeping form, noting the slight change in breathing pattern that told him John was either going to wake soon or turn over for a change of position on the couch. It had been over
He closed his eyes, attempting to enter his Mind Palace in search of a suitable means of entertainment – surely there was something there that could calm him down? – but it did him no good; without the sounds of John pottering about the flat, everything seemed to be even more unbearably … quiet and boring. If anything, this served to incense Sherlock even further; since when, after all, did he need for someone to be making little tea-sipping or toast-making or paper-turning noises for him to be able to
“Well, what are you waiting for?” Sherlock said impatiently, startling John; he had come from behind, ostensibly through a door that seemed to connect the staircase, the kitchen, and what seemed to be two more rooms beyond. He had also apparently discarded his coat – he was now down to shirtsleeves and what seemed to be tailored trousers – and was crossing the room to sit on the leather chair. “Sit down.”
The girl closed her eyes, and her hands began to glow golden, faintly at first, then slowly strengthening.
why I have asked you here tonight,” Mycroft said. “As I had already mentioned, we have all been targeted, and so long as this threat has not been neutralised, I wish to make sure that my family is safe. As a protector, I’m sure you understand.” He pulled out a thin envelope, this time from inside his suit jacket and embossed with the initials
The thing was, that Sherlock had gone from not trusting to offering John a flat-share – which he had no reason to do,
