She barely asked him any questions; Rhodey must have filled her in with the details. Which is why it’s surprising.
Maybe that should be the saving grace of his tragic fate.
but never fills up, he wants. And that want is so criminally lethal that he’d rather think he
Returning home after a week and a half should feel relieving but all he could think is about Bucky and the last time he saw him; bloody in his arms in Central Park and then lifeless in the cradle, and he couldn’t help the anxiety that boils from his chest to the back of his throat.
Other times, they take a stroll in the backyard under the moonlight.
Maybe he was expecting her to ask it earlier. When the wounds were still fresh. Or maybe later. When the wounds are mere aged scars that never throb once in a while.
He tells her that he wants to go home, but when she arrives, he says he’s fine.
“It’s not like you have to immediately deal with him,” She says, and whatever she sees in Tony’s eyes makes her add, “I won’t call him again, Tony. I swear.”
When Steve with his blue eyes misting over, kisses Tony’s palm and mumbles another apology into it, Tony slips his other hand up to cup both of Steve’s cheeks, directing his focus straight on him and he says firmly;
“You mind if I propose something, then?”
“Where you want to walk?” Tony asks, as he slips on a pair of sunglasses. They’re on Stark tower’s first floor, where the lobby is. Steve can see a small pool of paparazzi waiting outside, visibly becoming exited and happy as they spot him and Tony walking towards them. The glasses Tony puts on, Steve notes, look beautiful, slick design, sharp, most definitely expensive; Tony looks more energized in them, as if the pair of sunglasses just gave him a caffeine boost. His walk becomes more brisk, confident, and Steve feels annoyed by Tony’s swaggering walk, because of the way it juxtaposes with his own mood, and because he knows that it’s completely fake. The sunglasses just divert the attention from his tired eyes, and worried lips. The walk, Steve had once concluded, stems from Tony’s child- and teenhood, where he learned to fake how to look like he’s doing fine, and on top of the world, when in reality, his mind was so down in the mud, he felt like he was drowning in it. But, then again, how would Steve know, he’s just guessing. The walk annoys him anyway. Steve’s on edge, and he regrets a bit, that he allowed Tony to join him. But,
“I’m going out for a walk.”
“I think I do. You want to talk about it? Ask me something? Honestly, there’s a reason for my reputation. I’m a whore, there’s nothing I haven’t tried or at least heard of, so... Oh fuck, sorry”, Tony splutters. He can see how Steve’s pen stops suddenly, how he closes his eyes for a second too long, how his eyebrows knit together. “…I guess, you want to start with something, ah, not explicit? See, I told you I’m bad at this. Sorry.”
“Are you cold? I’m cold”, Tony says, and stands up. He pulls Steve up as well, and soon after lets go of Steve’s hand, but it doesn’t matter. It’s almost like a non-verbal promise, that Tony will wait for Steve, with open arms.
“What do you mean?”
“That’s… good. Neither am I,” Steve says slowly. He doesn’t feel as stupid anymore. Just really embarrassed.
“Steve”, Tony says. Steve turns to look at Tony, who has crept closer, and their eyes meet. Tony nods, and looks at Steve from under his eyelashes. Keeping eye contact is hard for him, Steve notices, it usually isn’t. Tony’s eyes run between his hands and Steve’s eyes. His voice shivers in the gentle wind, and it’s lower and shyer than usually:
“I always found it funny, when people worry about if the person they love is the ‘love of their life,’ such a stupid thing to worry about. You can’t know! That’s the point. If it’s the love of your life, but if you’re still in the middle of it, how would you know,” Tony says, “It’s just, people focus too much on the what-ifs, the feelings of tomorrow, and not enough on the now. If you love someone with your whole heart, like you’ve never loved anyone else, that’s the love of your life now. Who cares if it’s not the one in the grand scheme of your life.”
Of course, Tony happens, and there’s a change in Steve’s plans, but it’s fine, he thinks, these weren’t important plans set in stone. Tony does that, mixes up Steve’s plans and thoughts. Most of the time, Steve doesn’t mind, loves it even.
“No, it’s fine. I think I need this, actually,” Steve breathes out. The pen curlicues on the paper. He sketches the start of an eye. A shoulder and an arm. Steve’s eyes are locked on the sketchbook, and he isn’t really thinking about what he’s drawing.
Steve blinks, and the cloud over his head rumbles, then he himself glances at the pool of people in front of the doors, and looks back at Tony, who looks incredibly vulnerable.
There is a pained silence for a moment, and then a
The rollercoaster of feelings keeps on going, and the content blissfulness in Steve metamorphoses into bitter mixture of happiness, anger, and sadness. Mainly sadness, the bittersweet kind.
Steve presses his head into Tony’s armpit. It smells, but it doesn’t matter to him. This right here is home.
Steve stops drawing. The pen feels cold and clammy in his hand, and it slips on the page leaving behind a trail of blue spots. He looks at Tony. His eyes are brown, and sad. It’s such a clash; Brown is such a warm color, but all Steve sees in them is blue. Tony’s mouth twitches, and he licks his teeth, mouth opening a bit. Steve thinks he’s abhorrent for finding Tony sexy in such a state of mind.
“What do you mean? I don’t think you’re being selfish. It isn’t selfish or bad or in any way wrong to want something good for yourself. Pursuing happiness is a human right, you know, and wanting happiness, no matter what kind of happiness, it isn’t bad. It’s good. You’re good. God’s sake, you’re Captain America! If anyone deserved happiness, it’s you! Want – heck, need! – is not, and will never be wrong. And you aren’t selfish. You’re not. There’s nothing wrong with you, Steve, you’re not hurting anyone.” Tony’s voice rises at the middle and drops to a warm comfort at the end. He gives a Steve a hopeful and encouraging smile. His hands are shaking ever so slightly, Steve notes.
Steve takes a breath. Tony’s hand is curled around his bicep, and he looks almost ethereal. Out of this world. And maybe he is. Steve blinks away tears from his eyes. Tony’s eyes are closed, mouth slightly open.
The atmosphere around Tony is warm, it always is, even though Steve could tell that Tony is incredibly tired. He can’t say if something is bothering Tony, or if Steve is just reading too much into it, because he himself feels unbelievably unfocused, and jittered. He stopped hearing the words Tony spew out of his mouth, and settled to simply somewhat focus on his voice, and how it sounds. At times it is energetic, all loud and smiley, and then at other times, it drops to almost a murmur or a fast whisper. Steve almost feels relaxed, and happy, but the dark cloud looming over his mood won’t leave him alone, and he finds him bouncing his right leg, so that the small back bag, containing the pencils and the sketchbook, rustles. Tony doesn’t stop talking, which is nice, but he doesn’t take his sunglasses off, which is less nice. Steve stares mindlessly at the road ahead, and then takes his sketchbook out of his back bag, and lets his hand trace out shapes and lines how it wants.
“Don’t apologize”, Steve says. He draws a few lines; Gives the character eyelashes, a mouth, facial hair.
He once got so confused when a reporter asked him what he thought about the LGBT-community. He hadn’t known what the acronym meant, and why his opinion of the community was important, but he didn’t get the chance to ask, because someone –
“How – how can you just be? Be who you are, and not hate yourself? Did you hate yourself before? Do you still?” Steve asks, and Tony moves one of his hands away, so he can lean on it.
They take a red car, which’s name and model Tony tells Steve, even though they mean nothing to him, and then Tony proceeds to explain how fast it can accelerate and how he had it re-painted because its original red-color wasn’t the right kind of red. Tony fills the air with long sentences, and short witty comments. Steve occasionally says something, to help Tony keep the conversation – or semi-monologue – going.
he knows that later, when the cloud of whatever it is, that’s casting a shadow over his mood, passes, he’d regret more not allowing Tony to come, because he likes Tony. He likes Tony too much even, Steve thinks. Sometimes he enjoys Tony’s company all too much.
“But don’t think that I’m lucky that I’m bisexual, like I can just choose who I like and who I want to be with. It doesn’t work like that. I do have a preference for girls, I won’t lie about that, I just do. It made it easier, I guess. I could focus on that, act like I was straight. But once in a while I’d see some guy, and just fall for him. I’d fall head over heels for some guys and I would feel so confused. I didn’t realize you could like both, you know, I thought I was the only one. It must have been different for you… I think you’re so brave for even letting yourself admit to yourself, and now to me, that you’re gay. That’s always the hardest step. It’s gets easier after this. I promise. And I will always be here, if you need me to. I won’t let you fall.”
. He nor Tony say nothing for a while longer. Tony breathes in and out, rhythmically, it doesn’t sound heavy or laboured, just faster than normal. The humanoid figure under Steve’s pen gets a nose and ears. When a blue jay sings, Steve continues:
Tony places the sunglasses between them on the bench, but then moves them to the other side, so Steve can’t see them anymore. Tony turns more towards Steve, but his eyes dart once in a while to stare at the meadow before them, but they always return to Steve. There’s a careful aura in Tony’s movements, they’re too sharp and short. He lifts his hand to touch Steve on the shoulder, but then doesn’t. The hand settles for a second or two to tap Tony’s chest, before it drops on his lap again.
“Let’s go walk somewhere, where there are a little less people. I think, uh, I think, that’s what would be best for us. Or I mean, now I might be wrong, but I feel, or at least I don’t wanna be bothered by a lot of people right now, and I, I, think you feel the same way. That is, you give that kinda vibe… Now, uh, so what I’m saying is, that let’s take a car, and drive somewhere little less… populated”, Tony glances at Steve over his sunglasses. He has stopped in the middle of the lobby, and Steve is a few steps ahead of him, so he has to turn back around to look at Tony. All the confidence and assurance Tony just had built up in the last few strides evaporate, and his hands twitch, and one of them purposelessly brushes against the middle of his chest. “We wouldn’t need to deal with, that”, he nods towards the front doors.
“Tony, am I bad? Am I being selfish?”
Steve can feel Tony jump under him.
Tony forgets the sunglasses on the bench, and Steve notices, but says nothing. Tony Stark can afford new sunglasses.
Steve wants to go, but his legs won’t move. Tony’s hand feels warm against his skin, and Steve finds his thumb drawing lazy circles onto the back of Tony’s hand. This is what he has been fantasizing about, or at least one of the things he has daydreamed of. It’s amazing, that Tony doesn’t push his hand away. Steve feels extremely young and unsure, but over all happy; Tony understands and supports him. Tony’s like him, and that’s okay.
Steve smiles. He says nothing. He keeps turning Tony’s words around in his head, and believes them. But, he knows, that this is an issue he will not outgrow in one afternoon, or evening –
Steve finishes his drawing. It’s ugly in his opinion, horrible.
“Fine, fine as always. Where you headed, Cap?”
“Sorry, I’m bad at this”, Tony says. He takes off his sunglasses and massages his temples with his free hand. Steve feels his treacherous heart jumping, as Tony runs his fingers along his goatee. Steve notices, how tense his upper body is, and forcibly relaxes it. He takes the sketchbook out again, and with it a blue ballpoint pen. He opens a new page, and draws a delicate line, then stops and looks at Tony. He wants to say something but as soon as he opens his mouth, he feels something reaching into his mouth and strangling his vocal cords. Steve turns back to his sketchbook, and feels Tony’s eyes fleetingly on him.
“I just feel – I feel like I’m, I’m being selfish”, Steve says, and his voice feels skinned, and too high, but sounds steady, and low, “like I’m stealing something, something I don’t need or deserve. Thinking about what I want, it – it makes me so darned happy. I feel like I’m floating. But I don’t think I deserve to get happiness like – like that… Do you know what I mean? Like, somehow I’m hurting others because I’m such a bad person – wanting something so selfish like that.”
Tony pulls Steve towards himself, and they go back to cuddling. Their bodies entangled so that it feels like they’re just a one being. They breath and feel together for a while. Steve is happy, he is. But in heart-breaking, poetic way, which is, well hard to describe. Steve has never felt like this. Like he’s made of glass, and Tony is a liquid that fills him completely, and might escape if there is just one crack in his skin. But Tony isn’t going anywhere, and it’s like he said; No one, not even Steve himself, can steal this feeling, this moment from him.
“You know my dad, grade-A homophobe, he knew, I don’t know how, maybe he found my stash of magazines or whatever. When I was, I think I was fourteen, he gave me this short drunken speech, how he couldn’t have a son who was a homo. That really hurt me, but it really pushed me to be who I am, as well. In a twisted way. In my twenties I came out, properly, to everyone. I really rubbed his nose in it. I wanted to show to him, I guess, that I didn’t care what he thought about me. I would be with a lot of guys and girls, made sure everyone knew. That’s not living either, I was doing it for other people, not for me, but it was fun for a while. I’m happy I grew over that phase of my life. I don’t know if he ever came around. I wish – I hope he did. And I wish I would have been more understanding, tried to help him to understand, and that he would have been more understanding in the first place, I wish that the most”, Tony says, and keeps on talking. Steve feels sad for Tony. He hears himself in Tony’s words. Steve bends down to pick up the blue ballpoint pen.
“Like no one else?”
“That’s amazing, Steve.”
“I don’t think so, no. You’re the love of my life now.” Is the answer.
He looks at the lines he draws on expensive paper, that sits neatly in his sketchbook. They are sharp, but ultimately unsure and careful. They look strong, but closer inspection reveals them to be strong, yes, but uncooperative and lacking, aggressive even; they do not work together, they do not come together in the way Steve originally wanted them to. And the intensity of the lines, it’s, well, not necessarily a good thing; it feels like Steve is holding the pencil too strongly, forcing it to behave in ways it doesn’t want to. It looks like he’s angry and scared, and he hates the sketch he’s working on. He absolutely hates it. It’s ugly, and, and, and, unfocused. He’s unfocused.
"Anyways, turned out we were indeed ready to change the world, just not exactly the way we had planned. The radiation was too strong, too hot, too sudden. It melted through all our safety precautions, within seconds." Tony put on a sombre expression and stared across the table and out the large window behind Bruce. "It worked. Kind of. I wasn't the target but my cells were randomly reprogrammed. I was a glitch, so to say. But he...he was too close. He didn't make it. And after I discovered what I was suddenly capable of, I couldn't show anyone what we had done. We had no patents, no legal backup. The risk of it falling into the wrong hands was too great. I'm not proud of what happened that night, but it was necessary and the right decision. And I know he would have wanted it that way." His voice trailed off and suddenly the room was very quiet.
Tony stopped resisting Steve. "You calmed down?" Steve's voice asked in his ear.
"You wanted to have a word with me?" the General asked, obviously annoyed that Tony was keeping him from leisurely indulging in his Skrull hatred. Tony felt his palms getting sweaty. He had spent most of last night preparing what he wanted to say. He knew he only had this one chance and he couldn’t ruin it with an unfortunate choice of words.
"Yes, I'm good, I promise," Tony replied and Steve reluctantly released him from his grasp.

"I miss the Bucky I knew. We grew up together, were always there for each other. I mourned him and at some point, I learned to just live with the feeling that I will never see him again. And all of a sudden he's back, which is great, but he's only a shadow of himself. Or at least of what I remember him to be. And I'm trying to figure out how to deal with that and how we can help him, and at the same time, I'm supposed to be leading the Avengers. I can't do all that, Tony." The words had literally tumbled out of Steve while his voice had become increasingly shaky and Tony felt the broad back under his hand tremble. Steve's eyes were still fixed on his hands and Tony couldn't see his face. But he was sure that if he had been able to look into Steve's eyes, he would have seen tears glistening in them.
"You earned it," Steve said, proving once again his unique talent for turning a casual post-battle gathering into a deep and meaningful conversation. And he didn't leave it there. Tony still hadn't figured out if he was doing that on purpose, or if he just was like that. "You really did a good job out there."
"Didn't look like it was your first time doing that," Cap said.
Tony lifted his head up from the mat and was surprised to find that Steve was right. Through the window to the outside, he saw a sky slowly fading from the dark black of night to the rich blue of dawn. Once again, they had been up all night kicking it in the gym. Literally. Tony couldn't say he regretted it, but he knew that the lack of sleep would catch up with him by noon at the latest. However, if he had to choose between a SHIELD meeting where he was awake and a few private hours with Steve, he didn't have to think twice. He dropped his head back onto the mat.
Steve, apparently completely oblivious to the thoughts he had just evoked in Tony, walked over to the bench where they had stored their things. Wordlessly, Tony reached up and caught the bottle that Steve threw at him a moment later.
, Hala, 8K1M.YY67A47+58E698L
"Nat, knock him out," Steve shouted and the crackle of electricity filled the air before the General collapsed unconscious. His head hit the stone floor as Bucky and Thor let go of his shoulders and Tony noticed that he wasn't sorry at all. Everything that had built up as a result of years of humiliation and lies from the General seemed to have burst out of him and two punches had not been enough to vent the feelings. But Tony would not hit a man who was passed out on the floor, not even when it was the General. And by the time he had regained consciousness, they would be long gone.
Tony looked around the empty gym frantically. "Where?"
Clint looked around in disbelief. "Come on, don't pretend you all don't want to know as well."
"Not bad," Steve said and pushed himself up with his elbows, but remained seated on the mat. "Not fair but also not bad. Caught me flat-footed."
Steve's right shoulder twitched and this time Tony was ready to dodge the upcoming punch directly instead of blocking it and being forced onto the defensive. Tony saw the muscles in Steve's arm tense as he suppressed his reflexes and held back, waiting before following up with another punch.
, will always have your back no matter what we're up against. That's what a team is for, isn't it? Support. So if you need anything, everything from a cup of hot coffee in the morning, to a stand-in for a few hours, hit me up." And he meant it. He liked Steve. He liked the stoic leader who kept this little squad on course, steered them through battles with tactical flair and made the right decisions for them. And he also liked the other Steve, who made sarcastic jokes after work, who sketched his surroundings to relax and who had the courage to speak his mind and show his feelings. At least when no one but Tony was looking. Actually, he liked this Steve even better. And he really wanted to support him wherever he could and wherever Steve wanted him to.
Tony was silent. He couldn't believe what the General was telling him and didn't know what to make of this delusional assertion. He was obviously lying to upset him and to make him reconsider his decision. It was completely far-fetched and simply could not be true. But Tony, who had never met his biological parents, had no proof to the contrary.
"I'll be leaving Hala." Tony's heart pounded. He had said it. Not even to himself had he said it so far. It sounded good. And frightening.
To Tony's right, a public bus had overturned and was now lying lengthways, blocking all traffic on this much larger road. Behind the top, Tony caught a glimpse of the idling cars, their occasional honking mingling with the sounds of fighting. Then he spotted someone standing on the sidewall of the bus. Tony had to squint against the sun and couldn't make out much except for dark clothes and light hair. But he saw the man pulling arrow after arrow out of his quiver, drawing and releasing his bow at a breathtaking speed while the arrows set off small explosions or clouds of smoke on impact. Tony squeezed himself into a niche on the wall of a house and activated the scan on his comm.
"Tony," Tony corrected him as usual - well aware the General didn't care in the least - before he climbed the four steps onto the platform.
The response came promptly. "You wish."
"You're still tiny," Clint interjected but the rest of the audience ignored him. Not even Steve chuckled. And Tony continued with his well thought out story.
"At least now he's listening again." For a moment Tony considered picking up the box and throwing it right back. But to do that he would have to move and he didn't feel like that right now. Instead, he said, "You know, I don't want my brain cells to take irreversible damage from listening to bullshit so sometimes I just shut down when sitting next to you."
Tony took it. "You're welcome." Just now, as Cap was standing right in front of him, and Tony had to look up to him, did he notice how tall the man was.
Steve sighed and took another sip of water. Tony watched the light reflect off Steve's damp skin as he waited. He could literally hear it working behind his forehead and didn't want to force him. Finally, Steve opened his mouth and said, "Ever heard of the Winter Soldier?"
Tony felt the back of his neck getting hot at the way Natasha's statement scraped much closer to the truth than even she probably suspected. Damn these spy intuitions. But he had donned his poker face."You're right. Turning green and going haywire doing bicep curls with trucks is more like what you're used to. Forgot about that."
"You never were my son," the General said, no less despisingly. "How could you? You're not even half Kree."
The colours of the antique cables were barely distinguishable from each other in the dim light that prevailed in Tony's quarters. Only the bedside lamp next to Tony and the computer screens on the desk illuminated the room weakly and did not provide enough light to distinguish dark blue from brown or black. Or was it red?
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. He is. Truthfully, he is. But it’s largely polluted by his boiling rage. The need for retribution.
He can feel where and where Steve had held him the tightest that night. He can see the sunlight spilling in; slow and glowing, one patch of cotton sheet at a time.
Steve stares him down, full Captain mode, sending shivers down his spine. “You’re not doing any strenuous activities until you heal.”
And there you go. That tone. That voice. The way he says it makes Tony really hate his own name.
Long enough a time to propose the idea to Wanda and have her finalise the decision for them – which will be Steve’s job.
“We’re with you.” He promises.
Well, he's many things in the sense that you see or hear him do that and be like, yeah. That sounds like Steve.
“Barnes’ smart.”
“Tell me,” he turns the chair Tony’s sitting on around so they’re now face to face.
Pepper makes a face at him. “Can’t say. It’ll be cancelled out. Human beings, naturally have flaws on top of their - let’s say - advantageous. For example, where you’re a genius, you’re also ignorant sometimes -,”
Monica pours him a glass of sweat tea. “I don’t know if the Accords will protect me or try to protect themselves from me, Mr Stark.”
, to be honest.
“He’s fine,” They say. It’s Steve. “Natasha fixed him.”
The calm voice of T’Challa telling him about soul and matches; of brightness and darkness while he looked every bit as if he’s committing a crime against an unseen force.
He tears his gaze away from the white ceiling to look at the man curled around him. The sudden inaction from Tony seems to make him stir in his sleep as he makes a small sound and butts his head up into Tony’s hand.
It was harder than forgiving Steve – which, oh!
“What is wrong with you? What do you
Somehow, he manages to convince Steve to lie on his back in exchange for his word;
Tony feels his own panic trying to break out, but he pushes it down, focusing on the man he’s holding onto instead.
Wakanda houses ridiculously advanced level of technology. Their nanotech is incredibly advanced that it puts Tony’s latest ones to shame.
“I’m not dying,” Wanda says when Bruce tells her that. Then she hugs him and promises to visit every fortnight.
Now, she sits quietly, letting Tony gather himself with two sticks, poking and prodding at an array of Chinese takeout FRIDAY had taken the liberty to order for them and some TV show playing in the background.
“Yeah.” He admits. “I think – Yes. It would have helped.”
, grounded, but his emotions have this tendency to leak out when he’s with Steve.
"Sorry, dear."
Even if it strips you off of your own dignity, your rich and your own every fucking thing?
“Not sure, not important.” Tony waves her off.
Bucky hums, his hand cupping Tony's kneecap now that their position had shifted, and he gives it a squeeze.
Two hours later, he’s standing on the rubbles of what a HYDRA’s bunker used to be. The fat plop of dripping blood onto a blown out wooden plank under his feet slowly stirs him back to reality; wiping his vision off of its angry red and he computes the extent of the damage he’d done with a strange detachment.
At least, since the Council took over the Avengers compound, what
Natasha slots herself smoothly into that inch of space next to Tony on his chair and sniffs, “Puts Thor and Steve to shame, honestly.”
Bucky lets that information sink in. Then he asks, already knowing the answer, "You're not gonna buy this, are you?"
Problem is, they’re mere mortals surrounded by superhumans and a super spy. Among four enhanced, one head turns to them. Three guesses, which stupid is that.
“I love you,” Steve whispers to his neck, still well buried along the column of his throat, refusing to resurface.
A little modification. A synthetic heart-like function, but not entirely.
“Hm?” Pepper looks up from her soda bottle.
Rhodey nods back, a sigh echoing his trail as he exits the room, leaving Tony alone, feeling stripped naked to the last inch of his skin.
If he had shared the full story, the guy would have known. But he hasn’t and this man is not the vibrant sass master from upstate. He’s lacking vital information about Tony and it’s showing. But he sure does know how to mask it at least.
So Tony tries to be there for him, as much as he can; never stopped trying even during remission. But he had some meetings to attend across the ocean; 5 countries in three days and this wasn’t even their first separation, let alone the longest. He wouldn’t have left if he wasn’t confident.
It's a footage of their post battle disagreement – which Fury so eloquently called a ‘scream fight’ -; in which Captain America and Iron Man, with their faces exposed, are yelling at each other, hands flying out in accusations and pure temperament.
Tony does a few rounds with Natasha, then Rhodey, Wilson and Barnes.
He wonders.
Not Tony Stark; the owner of Stark Industries, son of Howard Stark. Not Tony Stark; the Iron Man, an Avenger. No. Not those Tony Stark, but simply, Tony. The mechanic.
A minute later, Steve bustles in from his after-gym shower with a solemn smile, asking, “All ready?” as he half-hugs Wanda. His gaze falls on Sam and immediately goes to James and he sighs, “Stop it, Buck.”
From the way light smattering of freckles to his darker birth mark –
When Steve looks at him in surprise, he shrugs, feels every solid second passing like a thick drip of something and grabs Steve’s hand in his at the fifth drip.
“I’m fine.” He says, turning back to the gauntlet he's fiddling with under a low table lamp, straining his eyes behind his glasses.
He's been on Bucky's side one too many times but less on where he stands right now (Rhodey knows better, or even Pepper). He's got so much to learn and he will. He doesn't have the patience, but he loves Bucky so vastly that training himself to be patient is close to nothing.
Maybe he’s running away.
“Huh.” Tony didn’t think about that. All he thought was - “Generally?”
Maybe Tony misses
Rhodey chokes on orange juice, spits it all over the coffee table and Tony groans in disgust. “Exactly,” Rhodey says. “You’re emoting what I feel.”
The little corner of Tony’s lips twitch. He has an inkling that Carol and him are going to get along just swell.
“Bad dream,” Tony answers before Steve begins speculating.
Tony, rightfully pissed, stomps on his foot.
It’s a beautiful lullaby that Steve could never recall hearing from anywhere. Both haunting in its melody and mesmerising. It’s sad and hopeful at the same time.
His right palm whirs, flashing warning in blue and the satisfaction from blowing that head is -
Which is why, as he watches Steve, Rhodey and Sam tell her something or another, he couldn’t.
broken.
Charles is expecting them there for brunch. There’ll be some introductions, orientations and if all things go well, they’ll discuss boarding, probably stay the night and be back by the next noon. If they’re not interested, they won’t be overstaying their welcome. They’ll be back before the day ends.
And the elevator door opens, but Tony has already made up his mind quicker. "Are you now?" He pouts back, cocking his head sideway, playing into whatever his boyfriend's doing.
“Come with me.”
“Because I love you, Tony.”
Across them, Fury closes his one eye and takes a long deep breath. “Listen here, motherfuckers,” he states, “I do not have time to deal with the repercussions of your scream fights in the middle of streets; in the broad daylight while the media is zeroing in on your grown asses like vultures – Look!” he snaps, blue lights flickering mid-air over his office table and a video starts to play.
Rhodey finds him in the workshop, head down in his hands, elbows propped on the worktable while he wills himself to stop shaking.
“Ho – Did – I – urm, Since whe -,” He stammers then stops abruptly to swallow, the click of his throat audible in the silence of the room.
DAY: 5433H || CODE: A6-OG23
Steve gave him another apologetic look. Then he said, "I'll try," and raised his hands again. Tony copied his movement and once more they faced each other rocking slightly from side to side.
The General turned to him and eyed him. "What do you think?"
Tony turned back to the screen and watched as the five of them struck down Chitauri, a race that was known to be superior to humans, at breathtaking speed. "They seem to be quite impressive. We have all sorts of powers in my unit already, but I think one or two of them might be a good addition. It could give us the crucial edge on the next Skrull hideout razzia. Hard to tell from afar though."

"Get away from my boyfriend," a voice said, and before Tony could process the voice, a red and blue shield came flying above him from behind, knocking the General clean off his feet. He fell onto the steps behind him and the shield landed on the stone floor with a clatter. Startled and confused, Tony skidded backwards on the floor to get even more distance between him and the General, but he couldn't take his eyes off the shield. Steve was here?
The General rose from his chair, now towering over Tony by a good head. "You swore an oath!" he said.
The General's eyes narrowed briefly as Tony corrected him. "Yes, please, step forward."
Steve didn't grin, but the corners of his mouth twitched briefly. Behind him, the automatic door closed with a soft hiss as he stepped out of the doorway and crossed the spacious room. Without hesitation, he settled down on Tony's bed. The mattress lowered and Tony quickly collected the small screws that had gathered in front of him before they all rolled over to Steve. He carefully stowed them away in the small box they had come from, then carelessly tossed the box, screwdriver and circuit board behind him towards the pillow.
"You owe me!" he said, his voice echoing eerily off the stone walls. "And I demand you to stay!"
was displayed in glowing letters across his wrist and Tony briefly looked at the many bytes of data on this Barton he had just received from the internet. He would have to dig through all that later.
"I didn't mean old-fashioned that literally, but thanks, Steve."
"How is he?" Tony asked without looking at Steve. Since they had taken Barnes into custody, Tony had also been keeping an eye on his files. He knew every detail about Barnes' problematic condition.
"Are you alright?" he asked, kneeling down beside Tony. A wonderful familiar smell reached Tony's nose, one he would recognise everywhere, the beautiful mix of herby and spicy, that was synonymous with “home”. When he turned his head to look into Steve's face he had to fight back tears.
"Thank you, Sir," Tony said, turned and walked down the steps of the platform and back across the long room. His steps were a little more light-footed than usually. Ever since he had learned that his father, whom he had never met, had been from C-53, he had wanted to take a look himself. But even though his work in the duty of the Kree Starforce had taken him to many distant planets, C-53 had not been among them until now. As Tony left the General's dark office and stepped back into the bright golden light outside, a grin of anticipation spread across his face.
"Bit of both, I believe," Steve replied. "I don't know how to prepare the team for something I know so little about myself. If even Fury has no intel..."
"So, you want the whole story, yes?" he said as he positioned himself in the room deliberately so everyone could see him clearly. It was as if he was preparing for an important business presentation, and basically, that was exactly what it was. Only with more acting. "The whole story about the night something aroused inside me. Wait! Don't quote me on that, that sounds horribly wrong." Another chuckle from Steve. "So, the night I got my powers... let's see," he paused dramatically again. "It was a dark stormy night. Way back in 2003 when I was a tiny lab assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"Sir," Tony began.
Tony picked himself up and drank the water in large gulps while sitting on the mat. It ran down his throat pleasantly cool and rehydrated his exhausted body from inside. Once he felt reasonably refreshed again and his thoughts had also cooled down his eyes wandered back to Steve, who had settled down on the bench beside the mats. His open bottle had came to a halt halfway to his mouth and he was staring at the wall opposite with obvious interest.
"That was the last one," Cap said as he picked up his shield again. "Good job team." He walked up to Tony who was struggling to get back up before he reached him. "Thanks for the help," Cap said frankly and offered his hand.
By now he was slightly annoyed that he was absolutely no match for Steve in hand to hand combat. He had been training a wide variety of different combat techniques for years at the prestigious Hala Military Academy, but Steve made him look like a beginner. A badly bruised and breathless beginner. Steve was usually better at holding himself back when they trained together, better at controlling his strength and adapting it to his sparring partner. But today his self-assessment seemed badly compromised.
is still pretty much to handle, Mr Supersoldier. Shift down two more gears and maybe the fight will be fair."
So he just carefully reached over across Steve to turn off the bedside lamp next to him and then settled down on the sofa opposite. It wasn't particularly long, but neither was he. It still took him a few attempts to get reasonably comfortable under the thin woollen blanket and with the small sofa cushion. Through the darkness, he looked in Steve's direction and hoped that he would get at least a few hours of restful sleep before the dark thoughts caught up with him again. Tony, however, only needed two minutes to be absolutely sure that he would not get any sleep tonight. Not because the sofa was narrow and not meant for sleeping, but because the mere thought of Steve lying over there in his bed was enough to keep Tony and his train of thought awake.
Three weeks now he was officially on the team, officially an Avenger, including ID card, personal quarters and everything. Although he couldn't quite understand all the hype about it. It wasn't that different from being on any other unit.
"I'm grateful you took me in," he tried to placate him, "but I've made my decision and nothing you say is going to change that."
Steve's body needed a few silent minutes to calm down and when he spoke again, the trembling had stopped and his voice sounded firmer again. "Sam suggested taking him away," he said. "Out into nature, maybe even over to Canada. He says treating him like a prisoner won't improve things. But here he's too much of a danger to too many people."
"Choose your battles wisely," Steve grinned. "You agreed on sparring with me, so don't complain now."
"Wow. Things got pretty gloomy around here," Clint said, knocking another empty pizza box to the floor as he took his feet off the table to get up.
"You should really go to sleep, you're rambling," Tony said, grinning, but he felt more of the pleasant warmth spreading through him.
"To protect Hala and its inhabitants as long as I live among them," Tony recited. "I know the oath. And I have no intention of breaking it."
"Hey, you already have a damn great team here, okay?" Tony said, looking Steve in the eye. "I know that they, that
"Yeah, I can see why," Tony muttered as the Hulk just slammed a car on someone. The immense power of its punches seemed above average even in relation to its impressive body mass. Tony definitely never ever wanted to be the target of this monster's anger.
The rock burst into fragments just as Cap sent his attacker to the ground. He raised his shield protectively above his head, but when only dust rained down on him, he looked around in surprise. For a moment their eyes met. Then he shouted "Thanks" over from the other end of the battleground and was already moving on to the next attacker.
"Can I ask you a favour?" he asked.
"Don't worry. I got you," he said, "I can lead the team for as long as you need."
"We will leave and you will not stop us," he said, placing a forefinger on the General's chest. "You will not follow or search for us and you will not attack C-53. Earth is under our protection from now on."
"Another round?" Tony asked hastily. "Or are you knocked out already?"
"Yes, I thought so too," the General said. "And then I saw this."

"If you're done looking deep into each other's eyes over there, we could use a little help here," Natasha said. She was aiming both of her guns at the General while Sam, Clint, Thor and Bucky had all four of his limbs firmly pinned against his screen. Images of Skrull were still flickering across it. The General might be stronger than most of them, but with four on one, they could have already taken him down easily. Tony knew it was his verdict they were waiting for.
Tony turned back to him so quickly he almost snapped his neck. Earlier, in his fury, the General had not elaborated on his insinuations, but now he was pressed into his screen, defeated and probably more willing to talk.
"Cap!" Tony heard someone shout and turned his head just in time to see the only woman on the team throw something large and round through the air. The man in the blue suit caught the shield with a turn and knocked out the attacker who had just approached him from behind. It was difficult to scan the two as they were right in the middle of the fight and moving so fast that they kept stepping out of Tony's aim.
"There was a fire at MIT in 2003," Bruce said slowly, "the whole lab complex burned down and tons of research results with it."
"What... Tony?" Jann-Vey looked up from the control panels in confusion.
"Steve," he said as he carefully aimed the screwdriver at a very small screw. "What's the matter, Dorito friend?"
"Hey, Earth to Rogers, do you copy?" Tony almost laughed at his own unintended pun, even if it wasn't funny to Steve at all. But Steve's jaw had clenched so tightly that Tony could almost hear his teeth grinding from here. That did not bode well.
Tony pondered for a moment, but couldn't think of anything interesting to tell. So he started talking about the team. About Clint, who had destroyed the third controller of the Switch in the common room yesterday when he had thrown it on the floor. About Thor, who had then burst into jubilation because he had beaten him at Mario Kart for the first time. About Natasha, who hadn't been able to stop laughing at Clint, and about Bruce, who had actually looked up from his book in amusement.

"We don't know," Steve replied, continuing to speak to the wall, "but he is coming closer as we speak."
"Your
"What if anyone finds out about you? They'll behead you straight away." He muttered so no one else would hear them, yet he didn't even dare say the word "Skrull". But Steve just shrugged.
Only when his body came to rest did Tony realise that Steve's arm was still resting on his stomach, right where he had grabbed him to throw him to the floor. A warmth that had nothing to do with the fact that they were both still sweaty lingered between them and Tony tried hard to ignore it.
Tony felt four curious pairs of eyes on him but as Cap gave his instructions they followed them without saying anything and began to push aside destroyed cars and carry unconscious assailants to the side of the road. When Cap had turned his back and everyone else was too busy to pay attention, Tony activated his comm once more.
Tony raised his eyebrows, then shook his head. He knew there was no point in arguing with Steve about the wisdom of this decision. Especially not while they were still on Hala.
"Head down," someone shouted and Tony obeyed the order without hesitation. He crouched down and the shield rushed over his head, knocking down another assailant. With a metallic clatter, it fell to the ground and all of a sudden it seemed unusually quiet in the street. Tony looked around. Black Widow was wiping her red hair out of her face, Thor was just standing there with his cape swaying and Hawkeye hadn't nocked an arrow for the first time since Tony had entered the fight.
Tony saw his right shoulder twitch, followed immediately by a weak hit on Tony's cover. Tony barely had to move to parry the blow with his forearm and the second he did that he knew it had been a diversion.
"What do you want me to do?" Tony asked quietly.
Tony looked up to him again and saw the slight smile on Cap's lips.
Steve was the first one to laugh, but Natasha, Thor and Bruce quickly joined in.
Tony ascended the three steps onto the low platform and walked around the large desk to join the General, who had turned his gaze back to the screen.
"I had a bad feeling."
The General shrugged as best he could in his position. "You'll come crawling back on your knees, just you wait. C-53 is too ordinary for you."
"About what?" Tony replied, glad that it was Steve who had broken the silence between them.
DAY: 5381H || CODE: A6-OG23
"Clint!" Steve said sharply as the box fell to the floor, but Clint just raised his hands in defence.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Cap grinning as they joined the group. But when he opened his mouth, his voice had returned to the leader's tone.
, Hala, 8K1M.YY67A47+58E698L
"What are you thinking about?" Tony asked straight out. He knew the expression on Steve's face too well to not recognise his brooding. Steve remained motionless and silent.
"This is live footage from C-53," he said, pointing to it. Tony looked at what appeared to be an aerial view of a major city. He had never been to that planet, but he had seen many pictures and recognised the flat roofs and long shadows of skyscrapers. But the air seemed unusually dusty and when he looked more closely he spotted the flames flickering out of buildings and blocking streets. It was barely visible in the aerial view, but Tony believed he could see small dots frantically fleeing the city centre.
"How did you find me?" he asked instead.
"Fine," Tony said, "then I inquire for vacation."
"No. We need you on Hala. You are a commander of the Starforce." The General continued to prepare the upcoming departure in his holographic projection as if the conversation was over with that.
"Yeah, but what if not, Tony?" Steve interrupted Tony's steady stream of comforting words. He turned his gaze back to Tony who saw something in the blue eyes that even he didn't get to see there often. "What if not? What if he can't be fixed? What if he stays like this forever? I never know which Bucky I'm talking to, if he recognises me as his friend, if he awaits an order from me or if he wants to kill me."
"I need clearance for ramp 2," Tony gasped without mincing words.
Before Tony knew what was happening, he was caught in this fight in the middle of a residential street in broad daylight. But apparently, no one seemed even remotely surprised that he had just disintegrated a massive stone with a light beam from his fist. And he didn't have much time to think about it either, because the next moment someone had grabbed him from behind. The assailants had obviously decided that he was now part of this unusual team, or at least that an attack on him was justified.
Clint pouted and Tony heard Steve chuckle beside him.
Tony was pressed into the seat and his head throbbed painfully as he tried to process what had just happened. He would have to sort out his thoughts later. Closing his eyes, he reached to his right and his fingers found Steve's again. He squeezed tightly, with no intentions of letting go any time soon. In a few minutes, they would be far enough away from Hala to perform a hyperjump. They were on their way home.
Tony nodded, internally congratulating himself for his precise research and for Bruce in fact backing up his tale. But it couldn't hurt to add a little more theatrics. "That was the only time I used this glitch, these powers, for anything. I mean before..."
The General remained silent and seemed to ponder. Tony wondered if perhaps he had gone too far. He was not allowed to contradict a person of higher rank, but objectively he was the best choice for an undercover mission on C-53. Not only because he was half-human himself, but because of his special skill set and excellent training. And the General simply had to see that too, even if Tony had the feeling he was holding something back. But Tony didn’t dare to object to his supervisor any more than he already had.
Tony took another dramatic pause to look at each of his teammates individually. Bruce's eyes showed exactly the mixture of dark foreboding and scientific curiosity that Tony had expected. Natasha had clasped her coffee mug with both hands and had brought it up to mouth level, but hadn't taken a sip in what seemed like an eternity. Clint, when everyone had been distracted by the story, had snatched the last slice of pizza and leaned back in his chair. With his feet on the table, he listened while chewing. Steve had his chin propped up in his hand and glanced over his shoulder to look at Tony. Curiosity was written all over his face too, though much more subtly than Bruce's, but it didn't escape Tony's notice. Even Thor, contrary to his previous statement, was listening with intent. He had his arms folded in front of his chest, squeezing the muscles on his upper arms to even more outrageous size with that.
The man turned to face him. The blue tone of his skin seemed to be intensified by the artificial glow while his black hair seemed to absorb any light.
Steve hurled his towel at him but it only fluttered past Tony and landed on the mat beside him. "Okay I'm sorry," Tony grinned as Steve rolled his eyes. "Please continue."
Tony had expected many things. But not this. His chin dropped and he stared at Steve with his mouth open. He had to make a rather stupid expression, because Steve added, "Only if that's okay for you, of course."
They lived together, annoyed each other, had regular training sessions in various group constellations and had already fought a few generic bad guys. Yet Tony had not grown tired of watching Steve thoroughly on the battlefield so far.
"Yes, Sir," the speaker said, and the group rushed past them towards the office. Clint let out an impressed whistle when they were out of earshot and Tony continued their way.
"I don't give a damn what you think you know about me," Tony said. "In case I haven't made myself clear: I resign. As commander and as your
"I want to put you in charge."

As if in slow motion, Tony saw the sharp-edged chunks of stone separate and begin to fall down. They were right above Cap, who was distracted by the one opponent he had left. Tony estimated the trajectory of the stones and made his decision in a split second.
"Can I make an educated guess on what's bugging you?" Tony asked, shifting a little sideways so he could at least see a little bit of Steve's face. Steve turned his head and Tony didn't have to see the deep frown to be sure of his guess. "It's Barnes, isn't it?"
But Tony couldn't possibly tell Steve any of that. So all he said was an extended, "I don't think so...?" followed by a carefully curious, "Who is that?"
He stopped in front of the flat steps at the end of the room. They led up to a hexagonal landing and to a man standing there. He had his face turned to the screen, his muscular silhouette standing out in black against the illuminated background.

With a loud thud, the heavy doors slammed shut behind him. The sound echoed in the room, which was just as tall as it was long, and the golden light that had been falling in from the anteroom disappeared. The windowless walls lined by angular pillars were just as dark as the flagstone floor, which was only interrupted by a few fine lines that shimmered faintly. Their polished metal reflected the bluish light coming from the large screen that stretched across the entire back wall of the room. As he walked towards it, his own footsteps on the stone were the only audible sound.
"You don't have to tell us anything if you don't want to," Natasha now interjected. "But, to be honest, I'm also curious. It isn't exactly the usual skill set you'd expect here."
"Rejected. You are a commander of the Starforce and therefore you have duties to fulfil. If you need a day off, so be it. But you stay on Hala."
"Unbelievable," Tony said, unable to hide the grin from his voice.
"You guess? That sounds awfully vague and like it should be a yes."
"You are the best!" Tony said.
"You don't want to believe me? Fine," the General said with a filthy grin. "Go ahead, go live on C-53. That should have been your rightful place all along. We thought you were a success, but apparently, our technology wasn't ready yet. You are nothing but another failed experiment, Ann-Tho."
"Commander Ann-Tho," the General replied without turning to him.
Tony and Steve barely managed to throw themselves into two empty seats and fasten their seatbelts before Clint turned up the thrusters and lifted them off Hala.
"Can you talk?" Steve eventually asked.
Steve tapped his finger on the comm on Tony's wrist. "You linked it to our system, remember? We just had to increase our range a little, afterwards, it was easy for Bruce to locate you."
Alright, four down, Tony thought and turned to the man Black Widow had just called Cap and who was obviously the leader of this small squad. He was currently fighting two other assailants who were keeping him busy but didn't seem to be a real match.
"To get rude archers off the roof without having to get my fingers dirty."
"You've always been an experiment. Always just a number on a piece of paper. Subject 325. And you were such a success we could hardly believe it. Your cells embraced every change, almost as if they wanted to become something greater. Have you never wondered why no one else around here has similar powers? Where do you think yours came from?"
When the large doors slammed shut behind him, he was already walking along the windowless walls with determination. The General's office still looked exactly as Tony remembered it. It was large and gloomy, with high ceilings and angular columns lining the walls. The metallic lines embedded in the stone floor reflected silvery as he strode over them and towards the large screen in the back of the room. The images that were now flickering across the oversized monitor, were different though. Tony vividly remembered how the General had shown him the footage of Steve and the other original four Avengers when they had defended Earth against the Chitauri. Now Tony could see the pointy ears and greenish skin of Skrulls on there from afar. How very fitting, he thought grimly as he stopped in front of the few steps that led up to the hexagonal platform and the General's huge desk. He sat in his chair behind it, had turned towards the screen and did not pay any attention to Tony.
"I could establish one. C-53 is closer to Tarnax II than Hala. It could give us an advantage and buy some time when the Skrull venture out of hiding again." Although Tony's reasoning was coherent, his stomach tightened at the suggestion. That he was using a strategic advantage in the war against Steve's race as an argument to be with Steve was a level of hypocrisy that made even him uncomfortable.
He heard the noises even before he reached the scene: Muffled thuds and shouts, a metallic rattling now and then and the shattering of glass. The fight was happening in the immediate vicinity and it was not happening quietly. Tony hurried down the side street while tapping on the comm display on his left arm. But he didn't need to activate the locator to pinpoint the source of the noises. He had crossed an intersection and now he saw them in some distance ahead up the narrow street. He continued to follow the empty road, which was apparently not one of New York's main thoroughfares and approached the sounds of fighting to find out what exactly was going on. He entered the street from the side, and as he left the alley he saw the whole picture.
Unimpressed, Thor pushed it back to the centre with his finger. "You have my thanks."
"I'm sorry," Steve replied, slumping his shoulders. "I wanted to go easy on you. I thought I did. Sorry."
"You know I had to," he said.

"Yeah, no. I grew up in the Bronx. I learned how to land a punch," Tony replied.

Well, hello America's Ass, Tony thought, as he suddenly found himself looking up from a very convenient angle at the sports shorts that were just the right amount of too tight. Definitely not a bad view, he had to acknowledge that without envy. Had it been this warm in the gym all along?
He squared his shoulders, stroked the commander's star on his chest and went ahead, back down the long room and through the huge door. The alarm remained loud and just as they entered the anteroom they encountered a small group of Starforce officers who had come to investigate the source of the alarm.
"I asked if you'd care to tell us why you can shoot light out of your hands," Clint repeated as the laughter around the table had faded.
Tony grinned, tossed his water bottle back towards the bench and stood up. He barely had time to process what was happening before Steve had an arm wrapped around his middle. With all his body weight he had tackled him head-on and thrown him backwards. Tony just managed to press his chin on his chest to avoid slamming hard into the mats with the back of his head.
"Of course not, don't be ridiculous," Tony replied, exaggerating when rolling his eyes. "We tried our new highly radioactive technique on my professor." He smirked a little and saw clearly how Bruce's eyes narrowed and how Natasha raised an eyebrow. He wasn't sure if they were expressing appreciation or insanity, so he continued.
“I think I do, too.”
“I’m fine. How about you?”
It’s cold outside, Steve thinks, and asks JARVIS, who confirms his hunch. He asks how cold, and then puts on the same jacket he had already chosen anyway, even thought it’s too light, and he may become cold because of it.
“Sure, that’d be swell.”
“I’m gay. I’m homosexual. Gay”, he says in his ‘Captain America’ -voice. It feels weird to say something like that in the voice he uses for giving orders. He sounds like an authority. It’s ridiculous, and a wave of bliss and tranquillity hits Steve. He laughs, breathy, full. Tony smiles, and squeezes his hand, and puts his other hand on top of Steve’s hand as well, so he’s holding one of Steve’s hand with both of his. Tony doesn’t laugh, but he looks less tired, as if an iceberg of worry just melted away from his heart.
T’Challa sits on one seat diagonally away from him and if Tony thought they were already talking before, it’s nothing compared to when T’Challa starts; all serious and enthralling.
He doesn’t expect her to text him. She doesn’t have his contact, not by freewill at least.
Tony takes a sip. “I know a place with competent tech. This will stay out of the accords. I’ll just need to do some arrangements.
Whether Steve deserves it or not, is not of importance because Tony’s beyond regretting his choices in life after seventeen.
“I think polite acknowledgement would suffice.” He tells her confidently the following day.
Steve couldn’t give him a straight answer so, Tony chucks the towel on the counter, walks past him into the room they're sharing for the night and nods at the bathroom when Steve turns to look at him. “It’s all yours now. Unless you’re leaving, then I suppose you’d prefer to shower at home.”
“Are you coming or not?” He glances over his shoulder. Rogers barely hides his surprise before he follows.
He forgets.
They all miss Thor. Especially during thunderstorm, when they all take turn to look outside, it’s visible as much.
"You can't pull that shit in public, sugar. You're killin' me."
“I get it now.” He tells him, eyes burning as he stares at his bare feet intensely.
, just how stupidly cheesy is this guy? Except he feels his cheeks warm, and he steps aside to get away with an airy, “Well now that you have, I hope you feel better.”
It’s such a juvenile and pathetic desire that makes his breath hitch, takes him back to 17 when he bid Maria goodbye and saw her dead body in morgue next to Howard and fuck.
“Mutants!?” Pepper shrieks. “Tony, what the hell are you dealing with. What is t-,”
“Tough smack right there, Auntie,” Tony grins.
She told him once that all she wants is for him to be happy, so he thinks it’s only apt, to ask her the same thing.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve says, poker-faced, eyes blank, staring right back at Fury.
One day, he’ll be on the side where that window is, and Steve will lean and Tony will hold him without feeling as awkward as they do now.
Then he’s not.
“You and Steve…,” She trails off, neither of them peeling their gazes off of where they’re currently settled on.
Twenty, Tony thinks. She’s twenty, beautiful and incredibly powerful. But suffering has always never picked its victim; it hits whomever it wants and when it does, you break.
he done? A lifetime of apologies will never cover this damage. His penance – He isn’t even sure if he can have retribution.
Tony flips him off but Rhodey’s already sipping on his eggnog with an indulgent smirk and he gives a wave. Calls out; “Good luck!” ask Tony pulls the half-asleep super soldier away from the get-together.
“I was there when you returned from Siberia, Tony.” She starts, voice calmer than Tony had ever heard her recall that, say, even a year ago.
“It’s late,” Tony mumbles, turning back to tuck his nose in Steve’s sternum.
“No, Tony. But thank you for that thought.”
His doctor puts him on meds. After a thorough discussion with Pepper and Rhodey who comes and gives him a hug but still couldn’t smile at him.
Refusing to let his mind talk. Refusing
It’s a remarkably ironic thing. Tony realises just how he has  been tagging on the ride of world saving, expecting he’ll drop dead one day along that line so he has to make it easier for those left behind to handle his unsettled mess.
“It’s not your fault, you idiot.” Tony gives a harsh shake, yanking fruitlessly at his hands, locked in Steve’s steel-grip.
Tony gulps. Okay, he decides. He looks up a little more until he meets Bucky’s concerned eyes and he realises for real why he cannot do this at all. Why he cannot ask Bucky for that hug.
“If they think they’re being subtle, they’re very wrong.” Tony murmurs, keeping his eyes on their disappearing back.
And Tony harrumphs. Just like he would, acknowledge yesterday’s weather, that is.
“You don’t have to,” Tony says. “I’m fine.”
