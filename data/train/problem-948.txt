"Sorry what was that?" Mycroft could not keep the mix of accusation and exaperation from his voice though, more out of habit if anything. He don't know how to talk natrually when Sherlock is in the room.
John Watson seemed to be expecting someone when he called upon 221B. His face fell considerably when he opened the door and saw the detective inspector.
"He will be safe!" Sherlock shouts over him. Mycroft knows that expression. It means Sherlock had gone through all the possibilities and all the processions and sloutions respectively and had reached his conclusion. And he, Mycroft Holmes, is responsible for moaking that conclusion a reality. Because he is Mycroft, his brother. This is what he does.
It was dark in his room. Which was odd. The lamplight outside is usually quiet bright. John carefully moves to the side of the wall and feels for the light switch. It wouldn't turn on. The explosion, whatever the cause, must have cut the electricity in the area off.John debated in his head if he should go out and investigate what's going on. He could vaguely hear shouting, perhaps some blocks away. He felt in his pockets to make sure the bullets were still there and made for the door.
John very much wanted to say he's capable of survicing even if he got caught in an actual cross-fire. But he didn't want to get in the cross-fire between the Holmes brothers. Instead he said, "Boys...mind telling me what happened? Or happening?"
Sherlock grabbed John's arm and kept it there. His other hand covered John's mouth to prevent him from saying anything to argue. The door was opened a tiny fraction. Sherlock kept his hand as still as hecan. One tiny swing, or worse, one creak from the door hinges, there's a high chance they'd all be dead in the next few minutes.
Sherlock opened his eyes. He squinted. He's still in his childhood bedroom. Boring! The sunlight seeps in through the curtains. He almost hissed at it. Everything's nice and quite. A sharp contract with his dream which all that's left is an impression of shouting and chaos, It kept on buzzing inside his head. Familiar and far away. Painfully. He tried to remember the thing he was thinking before he dozed off. He couldn't. Annoying.He's going slow. It's been happening a lot recently. Nevermind. Most important thing first
Grey Lestrade, meanwhile, was having tea with a certain Dr. Watson in the cafe on Baker St. He once felt quite guilty about how a large amount of his time and energy was now spent on secretly making sure everything's boring in John Watson's life. But Mycroft had reassured him that, wherever Sherlock and John's concerned,the national safety was at stake also. So he's definitely still doing his job. Greg vaguely wondered how many times had Mycroft told himself that. But Mycroft then went on to distract him by doing something that made Sherlock eye them very strangely the next day. He could feel his smirk twitching at the corner of his mouth whenever his conscious was a bit uneasy. Mycroft does know how to sort everything out.
When midnight came and there was still not a stir in the house, Sherlock stepped down from his chair. His stomach and chest immediately protested for the loss. Sherlock tiptoed to the window and peeped outside from between the curtains. Completely deserted. He sat down properly in front of his computer and tried to find a way around his internet cut off. No luck. He pulled out his phone and tried, no internet connection either. Sherlocked roared and threw his phone against the wall. That's it. He's going out. And no one is going to stop him.
"And you had sorted that guy out some time before you appeared, didn't you?" Sherlock continued like John never spoke. John rolled his eyes and went to sit down as well. Good job he didn't bother to turn on the lights sometimes when he's alone at night. He knew where everything was. "Oh that. Greg said he wanted to make sceencaps. He's been helping a lot, Sherlock. Can't deny him that." "Or what? Did my brother-in-law threaten you with no sex?" "Surprisingly, Sherlcok. Love is not all about sex. I thought you knew that." John could almost hear electricity sizzling in the air. "I know it. But I'm not sure about you."  John suddenly realized what they  were talking about. He blushed furiously. But just at that moment the lights were on/ John quickly put his hand on his face , pretending to shield his eyes from the light.
A gun shot echoed in the hallway downstairs. Then there's sielnce. John counted to five, and dashed out from his hiding place to open the door. "No John!" Sherlock hissed. He lunged forward to stop him. John's hnad was already on the handle. He turned the handle nad-
"MYCROFT!!!" He shouted. A special mixture of hate and I-don't-care and upset and wronged and need and respect and pout. "MYYYYYYCROOOOOOFT!!!" But the government man is not home. No one's home.
"What?" John nealy chocked on his tea. Then he mentally kicked himself. His life had been boring for too long. He's becoming easily surprised. It's not a good sign. Greg smiled at him knowingly. "Don't worry. Um...It's still in good condition? You got enough bullets and stuff? Need anything else?" John's jaw dropped down. "Um...No. It's fine." He finally said. "All Fine." Greg nodded. "That's good." Greg said. He slipped something underneath John's palm. "Keep it. Just in case." Greg laughed nervously. His guilty conscious creeping back up again. John looked at him, eyebrow raised. Greg nods at him, encouragingly. Behind John, out on the street he could see a black car driving away. He couldn't wait to fall back into a lump of misery and exaperation in his office. And for Mycroft to make it up to him for his troubles. Though he knew he might wait for a long while for that. "Take care, then." he said. He stood up to leave. "Oh and Greg?" John stopped him, still seated. Greg looked at him. "How's Sherlock?" It took all his years' experience as a detective not to give away anything on his face. "Still dead." He said. John nodded. "See you around."
To be perfectly honest the thought that Sherlock was not dead was just an obsession. One he thought over and over so much that he accepted it as the truth. Then he proceeded to make theories about what really happened during the few hours he left Sherlock alone. Then he started writing those blog entries. Not really expecting something to happen. It was just one of those subconscious things that you feel you should do. He had rewired his mind so much that he wasn't that surprised when he saw that one comment. Only excitement. His heart hammered in his chest. Sherlock you idiot. Whatever danger it is we face it together, eh? Why wait? Let's ignite the explosions and get it out the way.
"And Sherlock?" He turned back when he reached the door and told the back of his little brother's head. "No internet for you for a week." He closed the door behind him and left. He could feel Sherlock's glare when he's inside his limo once more, and was pleasantly surprised he didn't hear anything breaking when he got into it. (Guns were banned on the second day.
The thing is. After Sherlock had "died", John stopped updating his blogs for a while. Not too long. But long enough for Sherlock to panic. John is addicted to his blog. Something is seriously wrong. After his "funeral", Mycroft (and basically everyone else, Sherlock suspected Mycroft threw everyone a cake party behind his back, and promised them unlimited supplies of any cake from any country they wish, to turn them against him) had banned him from sneaking out to see John again. They simply don't trust him. John would be on his side and help him go out, to see John.
"Did John get angry with his computer half way through typing?" Sherlock asks the Holmes-Lestrades, all puzzled. After all reassuring words failed and Sherlock threatened to break out of the house, Mycroft's monitor footage show John all calm and sane when he types. The only change in his expression is his forrowing his brows when he can't find a letter on the keyboard. (How adorable.)
Mycroft made himself seated on the other chair in the room. "I wasn't home." He said. "So it is your fault." Sherlocked spitted every word out through clenched teeth. "You could have called me, as in using the phone."  Mycroft replied in his usual voice. Sherlock turned his head away to show he's not listening to whatever Mycroft says. Or he's probably just hiding his tears.
Sherlock doesn't need telling the last two. He takes careful measure to make sure the blog's click count is still jammed. And Mycroft makes sure there is no way the traffic in and out of the website can be recorded or tracked.
Sherlock went into the in-siote bathroom for a quick wash, changed out of his pajamas and put on his coat. He turned the door handle of his bedroom.. It's locked. So he was not supposed to be served dinner that night anyway.Sherlock snorted. Childish. Like that would stop him. But Sherlock knew better then to pick the lock. He learnt months ago that it's not pickable, and it's connected to an alarm system linked to Mycroft HQ. Though it's Sherlock's honour to ruin whatever Mycroft does, He knew tonight was different. Something was happening and Mycroft should not be disturbed. And he, Sherlock, should not get in the way. Which was why he would not...let's try the window.
"Blimey John. You could have shot me right dead." The coice said. The figure moved to the window and now John could see the shape of the man. But it's not like he didn't know who the man was alrady.
John was not expecting this reply. For a moment the awkward silence hung in the air. "but now that you are back," John said helpfully. Outside a siren screamed past. "That's what I'm not sure about." Sherlock said to the window glass.
"John, are you alright?" Hojhn felt hands on his arm and cheek. "Mycroft what have you done do you not know sudden exposure to bright light after a long period of darkness-" "It's okay, SHerlock. Really it's okay, just an instinctive thing." John tried to put his arm down. But Sherlock held it firmly in place. "No, you don't do this before." "Yes, maybe I've changed." John snapped. He didn't mean to but he just did. And he forced his arm down a little too hard. And awkward silence. "I'm sorry." Sherlock said finally. He was kneeling in front of John. Mycroft remained standing by the door, looking down at the two, his face blank. "I assumed you have a reason." John said. He was aware he sounded accusing." "It doesn't matter now. The reason no longer exists." Sherlock looked over at Mycroft, who nodded. He looked back into John's eyes. "They made a move tonight after this morning. They - the remaining of them saw my comment on your blog. So Mycroft thought it would be a golden opportunity to end it once and for all. But they wanted you. They wanted to use you to get me. So Mycroft thought it'd make the job easier if he can get you safe out of the way. So he drugged you and put tons of security force around here. And he didn't try to stop me from sneaking out and look after you. Am I right, Mycroft?" "As ever." Mycroft said. John looked from one Holmes brother to the other. "If you don't mind, Doctor Watson, they are both being so out of character its a bit alarming. "If you don't mind, Doctor Watson. Apologies." Mycroft said. There he goes. The bastard always knew what to say at the right time. Diplomats. John cursed in his mind. But he's grateful this was not going to go though the whole process of blood and tears or worse, awkward politeness for a long time, by the looks of things. "If it's not too much trouble, do you mind my brother staying here? I have plans for what remainds of tonight and don't think it's appropriate to be overheard by my little brother." Sherlock threw him a disgusting dark look. "It's okay , I don't mind." John said with a smile. He patted a still kneeling Sherlock on the head. "I'll keep this one."
Mycroft pushed the flat door open nad stepped inside. He turned straight to John. "Haven't met you for a long time, John. I do apologize. Been kept busy by...you know, business. Oh and you'd want to put the gun down." John realized he was still pointing his gun at Mycroft's heart. He did as he was told. "Sorry about the darkness. I had the poiwer in the area cut. Don't want to draw attention-" "Oh, it's night. I can't turn on the lights. There's an area pitch dark in contrast with the whole city. There can't be anything going on. How logical." Sherlock cut in. He had already resumed his place in the room - sitting comfortably in his chair. "You are in enough trouble Sherlock Holmes. I suggest you keep your mouth shut." Mycroft said without glancing at his brother. "Really? I don't see any." Sherlock replied. "Didn't you count on me to keep John inside and out of trouble in your plan? You didn't leave anyone to look after him, Mycroft! If I wasn't here he's most likely to be caught in the cross-fire."
Sherlock sat in front of his computer. His slender fingers typed out the website  address almost on their own. He uses no bookmarks. clears his internet history, input historey or whatever else that might give anything away. Though It's basically impossible for anyone to pock around on his computer. Mycroft had installed all kinds of security software on it after Sherlock "died". Sherlock then got rid of all those and did a thorough set up himself.
“Greg? Remember that time we held a baby-shower for Rosie and I was asking around about who brought-”
He is no longer floating. He is sinking, slowly, in the pool of black ink, that feels heavy like lead. His eyes are open as the liquid void flows over them.
Not to John, certainly. It could tip the fragile balance between them. Besides, John is at work; the last thing he needs is seeing a message from Sherlock and worrying that something might be wrong with Honeybee (Why else would Sherlock be contacting him). They are not what they used to be. And even when they were, more often than not his messages were unwanted annoyances. Especially during the last couple of years. Invariably answered with “what do you want, Sherlock”. He had soon learned to want nothing. Nothing at all.
Molly. The name stands out, almost beckons. Sherlock knows she’s not pleased with him, knows he has let her down (four slaps too many, the message got through). But it will just be a text. Harmless. He just needs the safety of the reply’s ping, the knowledge there is someone at some other end of the network and that the two of them are connected a lighthouse’s beam in the dark. She was one of the people who would come check on him, during his first days out from the hospital. Maybe she will understand.
John is a bomb. A ticking device, with countless errors programmed over its core. Waiting to self-destruct and take anyone in close vicinity with him. He always has been, always careful to hide it deep inside. This time his options are running thin.
“Yes, it is still scary”, John laughs, but there is no mirth in the sound. Sherlock shakes his head, and the spell of apraxia dissolves. As if a switch has been clicked on, cold water thrown to his face, he’s in his body again, in his usual state of mind.
Sherlock is up beside him in an instant, helping him get their little rose clean from any remaining shampoo, washing her with precisely selected temperature water once again. He doesn’t probe for more. He respects John opening up like that. Slow and incidental, whenever he needs to, wants to. John towels Rosie carefully but she’s not even grumpy, satisfied to be outside on dry land finally, he bets.
His heart raced the wind. His chest cavity small. Too small for such a love. Such an emotion. It pulsed through him and out. Around him. Leaking into the air. Molecules contaminated with a love he could never go back from. It was meant to be forever. It was meant to have all of him. All-consuming and overpowering.
It’s like the end of an era. The final lines of a book. Even if nothing has changed on the surface, everything has; everything could, as when the plates of the earth are shifting. It is a distinct, definite point slicing space and time, and he is watching it being created. There will be a ‘before this conversation’ and an ‘after this conversation’ when this moment is over. Sherlock does not know what the ‘after’ will entail, if it will be for better or worse.
They walk down the park, stopping casually for Rosie to play here and there. Both wanting to restore her previous mood and stall. Not wanting to end the day short, after all. She falls asleep on John’s chest in the end as they sit under a tree, reading one of her favourite fairy tales. Sherlock doesn’t comment on inaccuracies and soon, clouds start to gather above them, taking the decision for them.
It had taken them a while to reconnect. He had stopped coming after- after Rosie’s mother died. When he needed this most. He had stopped. She knew him. As well as can be expected. He had only opened up more of himself after Rosie’s birth. He felt safe then. For a while. He had a child. A family. He could let himself heal. But it all came to a screeching halt. When her mother left them. Tried to escape her fate. On her own.
Sherlock’s cheeks are flushed red and John hopes it’s from the newly-made fire. His lips are a soundless ‘oh’ of disbelief as he takes his offered blanket and settles, resting his back on his armchair. John does the same. Their feet meet halfway as they stretch a tad, the distance too small for their knees to not be bent. Toes, huddled under blankets, stop moving, examining the contact of each other’s with thick fabric between.
“John, it’s alright to let this go. Whatever it is.” A smooth tone. Not the one he wants, needs to hear. The deep baritone one he longs for…
But John knew. He knew what it was. It was not a question of when. It was a question of why. A why deeper than what he had anticipated, than what he
John’s grip does not relax, but Sherlock pulls back a little, just enough to be able to look upwards at him like a cat, his chin resting against John’s diaphragm. John cup his cheek, and it’s reluctant, as if he is afraid Sherlock will be spooked away.
He lets the silence win, but it’s not empty anymore. It’s companionable. Easy. He is still holding his wrist tight.
“Am I not even allowed to talk to you, now?”, she sneers in a deceivingly sweet voice at John, who gives her his most fake, tight-lipped smile.
John inhales, his chest puffing out like a balloon, and then lets the air go slowly, his shoulders sagging. “Sherlock, I…” He closes his eyes, pinches the bridge of his nose.
“You okay?” John prompts, his voice soft. His smile as well, longing for good old times where this question left his lips constantly. Checking, worrying, double-checking. Sherlock always there with a nod, a shrug, a word, a smile.
The man that is making airplane noises to try and get John’s daughter to eat right now. Yes, John is a father. He can be again today. And tomorrow. And forever. Because the little flower scrunching her nose right now is his. Is Theirs. And they are doing great together.
“I don’t have an appointment tonight, so I’ll be home earlier”, John says, reappearing at the landing. The swoop of his silver hair is slicked back. He smells of crisp aftershave and the matching cologne.
There’s no change in the atmosphere around them. Sherlock’s small inhale of breath the only sign of him acknowledging John’s words. John grips his knees tight. He knows how to do this. What he doesn’t know is if could last to the end.
He tries to ignore her, but she knows and sits on the chair across the table from him, so that he won’t be able to, if he wants to keep paying attention to Rosie.
Marsh: An area of soft, wet or periodically inundated land, generally treeless and usually characterized by grasses and other low growth.
Sherlock exhales the breath he's been holding. Feels like an entire wind had coiled up in his lungs.
Sherlock stands on weary legs, wooden knees. Takes the walk of shame that leads back to his bedroom. With the knowledge of the insanity that he will be back here again next night. And the next, and the next. Because that is all he knows how to do. Because that is all he can do. Why fight it anyway? This ocean is stronger than he is, too.
He goes for his phone while walking down the street. The world is blurry. Washed out. His eyes wander over the dull colours of familiar buildings. His feet are taking him where he needs to go. Home. But his fingers are dialing.
Sherlock throws his dressing gown onto his bed, gets out of his pyjamas. He doesn’t spare a second glance on the track-marks on the inside of his arms.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered and he went loose. Looser than before, when he was ready to collapse, looser than ever. John watched with silent surprise as his shoulders sagged and his body reached and leaned and rested. Over John’s beating heart.
John doesn’t know how much time has passed. But he knows something else. Sherlock does exist. He does. He’s here. He’s speaking to John. Now. Here. Now.
Now in his thirties Sherlock could privately agree that the way he had fought for independence had been self-destructive. He also knew that they would never completely overcome the distance that had grown between them. At this point in life however they had both, in their own wordless way, admitted to wrongdoings towards the other. Now they had mostly settled into a relationship of brotherly bickering, with couple of occasions when tempers had really risen.
At first Mycroft had only looked politely interested in what Greg had to say but the DI felt like the other man started to become interested for real as he went on, though it was expertly hidden.
“This has gone on long enough!” The man had looked less calm as he glared at Sherlock. “You have lost control of your drug addiction and if you don’t get clean soon you might very well die! I’m not above having you forced to a clinic if it will save your life!”
Mycroft gestured to the young man who had stepped out of the car to not try and follow Sherlock. Greg watched quietly as Mycroft gingerly felt at the back of his head while wearing a downtrodden look on his face. Then he seemed to suddenly realise that Greg was present and in less than a second his face transformed to a blank mask.
“My brother really is hopelessly dramatic” the elder Holmes sighed and turned his head to look at John who once more sat down in his chair, a cup of tea in his hand, and picked up a book.
Greg liked Sherlock, for some mysterious reason, unlike the rest of his crew. Sure, the younger man certainly came off as abrasive but his deductions were spot on. Greg knew that since he had annoyed Sherlock more than usual a few times and had been deduced in revenge, though it wasn’t much of a revenge since Greg didn’t take offence. Some of Sherlock’s odd behaviour reminded Greg of his cousin’s son, a 17-year-old boy with Aspergers syndrome, which might be why he felt more comfortable with Sherlock than the others on his team did. And as a bonus he had come into contact with a lot of junkies during his time in the police. He knew a thing or two about how to handle them.
“I am not. I do not want to infringe unduly on your time Mrs. Hudson, but I would like to speak to you as you are Sherlock’s current landlady” Sherlock’s brother said.
As the months passed and John stayed by Sherlock’s side it dawned more and more on John just how much power Mycroft was in possession of and was able to use in just about any way possible. Sherlock may be out of touch with how the ‘normal’ world worked, outside of criminal behaviour, but John was uncomfortably reminded of totalitarian regimes when he thought about Mycroft’s modus operandi. John certainly felt that Sherlock deserved to be treated better, and he didn't think that thought was based only on the fact that his feelings for Sherlock had begun to grow and change.
“He could do so much more for Queen and country if he stopped being to obstinate and just came to work for me” Mycroft apparently couldn’t help but comment.
Deciding to stop walking for a moment Sherlock sat down on a park bench. There wasn’t much to look at since the park was virtually empty. In the distance though Sherlock could spot a lone figure walking their dog and over by one of the entrances a couple was exiting the park. The place looked barren since autumn had killed the vegetation and the trees had lost all their leaves. It was really too cold to sit outside like this but he just wanted a moment or two to try and sort out his feelings
They both still tested each other’s boundaries but it had become more like a game to them, a comfortable way to interact. In the end Mycroft was the one who came closest to understanding what it was like living with a brain like Sherlock’s and vis-à-vis. Sherlock already knew he would be lost without his blogger…but he had a suspicion that he would be equally lost without his archenemy.
Then, as Greg once more tried to send Sherlock away from the crime scene, a shiny black car slowed down and came to a stop a few feet away. After a couple of seconds the car door opened and a well-dressed man climbed out. It was very strange to see the expensive car and the man dressed in a three-piece suit, with a brolly and a calm look on his face, in this run-down part of town and late at night. Both Greg and Sherlock had stopped arguing to look at the new arrival but while Greg’s face only showed the confusion he felt, Sherlock’s turned dark with anger. It was an anger much more intense than the one he had shown when he got turned away from a crime scene or was aggravated by members of the forensic team.
Greg wasn’t sure if he should intervene but by now both men seemed to have forgotten about his presence.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade I presume?” He asked, and as Greg nodded he continued “I do apologise for my brother’s appalling behaviour”.
“Get the bloody hell away from me!” Sherlock shouted at the man. It seemed to Greg like they knew each other since the other man just watched with an exasperated look on his face.
Having stormed out on his brother and John, Sherlock relished the feeling of being outside in the cold autumn air. He started walking the usual route he used for calming down after meetings with Mycroft. His ire didn’t last long and soon he was simply enjoying the feeling of solitude and the silence of the park late at night. First his mind wandered to John, as it often did nowadays. John was special and he made Sherlock want more…though he was slightly uncertain as to what that really meant. Sherlock knew that John was attracted to him, despite the older man’s mantra of ‘not gay’. They were dancing around each other right now, neither comfortable to be the one to take that first step. But that wasn’t what he wanted to think about right now.
“Look, I admit that I don’t know Sherlock all that well but from what I’ve gathered from working with him he has an amazing intellect and he truly enjoys, maybe even loves, using that to figure out the why and how of the crimes I investigate. And I’m glad to have him. Maybe, if you get him to cooperate at least somewhat, you can use that as a motivator? I won’t allow him on my crime scenes when he’s high, he knows that, and soon enough word will reach my bosses about him. If they find out that I have a…junkie, consulting on our homicide investigations then I might very well lose my job, and Sherlock would lose his access to crime scenes.”
Mr. Holmes had her loyalty and so she accepted that the task of organising surveillance and information gathering on her boss’s younger brother was one of her duties. As was the occasional retrieval of Dr. Watson and that was in fact what she was doing right now.
“Quite” That was the only answer he received as Mycroft rose from his, or rather Sherlock’s chair, and straightened his cuffs and suit jacket.
“Sure, keep your fingers crossed” John called after him, chuckling as he heard a muttered “How pedestrian” from the man now on his way down the stairs.
“Regrettably yes” Mycroft said with a humourless smile.  “I take it that you are familiar with his unfortunate drug habit?”
“I am fully aware of Sherlock’s arrest record as I am the one who has to sort out his messes, but I doubt you know my little brother very well. He has in fact been to the best rehabilitation facilities I could get him into, three times so far, and every time he falls back into addiction shortly after leaving. Not that he even stays put at the clinics all that long before absconding. I do not want to have to force him there again but by now I don’t think I have any other choice. Not if he is to stay alive and unharmed by the poison he so happily injects into his veins.”
Mycroft Holmes may be Big Brother personified but Anthea had no doubt in her mind that what he did was for the best of all involved, no matter what those actions were.
“Ah well, hope springs forth eternal. Isn’t that what they say?” The elder Holmes replied, already halfway out the door.
Mrs. Hudson sat back in her chair and sipped from her tea cup as she thought about his words. That Sherlock battled addiction obviously wasn’t news to her, sad as that may be, but it had now become clear to her why he felt that his older brother tried to run his life. Mr. Holmes certainly seemed like he had, or at least felt he had, enough power to force his brother’s hand ‘for his own good’.
“Yes I know of his habit, you’d had to be blind to miss it, but he’s a good kid. Yes, I’ve been forced to arrest him a couple of times. That was actually how we met, but I think that if he just got a chance, the right help and was properly motivated then he could have a chance at getting clean and staying that way.” Greg told the other man, though the look he got in response clearly told him that he was being thought of as a gullible idiot.
“Well Mycroft, you probably hate repetitions as much as your brother does but it has to be said… thank God you’re above all that” John couldn’t help but smile for real as he looked over at Mycroft and actually caught him rolling his eyes. Sherlock must have annoyed him more than usual this evening to have the always so proper Mycroft reach this point.
Mycroft had always felt that their parents didn’t take Sherlock’s safety as seriously as they should have. He could freely admit now that that feeling was partly sprung from them having failed to keep Mycroft safe from bullies during his years at school. He had sworn to himself when Sherlock was born that he would be more protective of his brother than their parents had been of him. When Sherlock’s behaviour had started to set him apart from his peers and he had started getting bullied Mycroft had been the one to handle the boys bulling Sherlock. He had been the one Sherlock came to for safety, help and protection. Sherlock’s opinion on whether he needed that protection or not may have changed as he grew up but Mycroft’s hadn’t.
Sherlock knew that John thought he understood how Sherlock felt about Mycroft constantly keeping an eye on his little brother’s life but how could he? John would never understand the complex relationship between the two brothers. Sherlock had grown up with Mycroft’s watchful presence and could hardly imagine anything else, even though it had chafed at times and he had tried to break free from it. In truth, if Mycroft stopped keeping an eye on him and stopped getting involved it would probably hurt. Neither man had a well of emotions to draw from but they weren’t completely emotionless. This was Mycroft’s way of showing that he cared for Sherlock, despite his opinion on how caring was no advantage. The fact that Sherlock allowed it, up to a point, was a way for the two of them to comfortably connect.
“No bother at all Mr. Holmes” she replied with a bland smile. As she led him inside she recalled the circumstances of how she had got to know Sherlock in the first place.
John knew Sherlock had been in drug rehab against his will several times, it had slipped out during one of Sherlock’s angry tirades after a meeting between the brothers. As a doctor John could understand the need for an action like that, even though it hurt to hear about a man as fantastic as Sherlock in circumstances like those. But the surveillance? He had thought Sherlock was paranoid at first and had helped him search for listening devices and such just to humour him. It had felt unreal to actually find some, hidden among the many knickknacks in their flat. And they kept finding new ones regularly! The same thing with the people Mycroft assigned to follow them around. Sherlock had of course argued with Mycroft about it but John got the feeling that it was more of a game between the two of them. A rousing game of ‘Can You Spot the Surveillance?’.
“Of course. Can I expect to hear from you say, tomorrow afternoon?” He asked, finishing his tea and standing up.
dying, preventing her from using his death to explain everything that had gone wrong in her life. So far, Sherlock had tolerated her presence in the flat, busying himself in his room and or at the table, peering into his microscope at nothing particular, but his patience was wearing thin. He’d taken to leaving half-filled glasses of port scattered about the flat.
) and how detective had never been her first choice – she’d been accepted to medical school in Montreal, but dropped out during her first year – family issues, she explained. A few years later, she saw a recruiting ad for the RCMP in the back of a running magazine and signed up as a lark. “I blame
John stopped and looked at Sherlock. “Why didn’t you tell me?” His voice rose a notch. “Why do you never tell me?”
The restaurant was amazing. She had steak and Caesar salad and probably too much Beaujolais. Greg was charming and attentive – he asked about Canada
Mrs. Hudson pushed away from the table and stood, pulling her sweater tightly around her. “You don’t even know them. And I know when I’m being interrogated – if I learned anything at all from my husband. But you’re a smart one. You’ll get it sorted out without my babbling on and on.”
He walked carefully around to the back of the cottage to inspect the hives, checking the supply of honey that would keep the queens alive through the winter. After a while, the leaves crackled behind him. He didn’t turn around. “You’re late. Tea’s cold. I ate all the biscuits.”
As much as she needed his help, she didn’t like that he’d made the offer sound conditional. On what, she wondered.
Greg read the e-mail quickly. He was quiet and John could see him searching for the right thing to say. “He must have made the reservation months ago. You didn’t know?”
"The only thing I excel at is the work. Everything else I have ever attempted ended in disaster.” Sherlock smiled faintly. “I am, by all reliable accounts, a complete prick."
She laughed and took another sip. Not as bad as she thought. “You’re the second person in an hour to tell me that.”
John set the phone between them. “It makes no sense. Who is he? And don’t take this the wrong way, but why me and not you? I’m the
The room tilted and Sherlock stumbled backwards onto the bed and pressed his hands to his face. It was too much. Even for a dream. “Enough. Go away.”
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. He had missed Mycroft. But his brother more than anyone would certainly suss out the change in him. “You need to stay out of my business.”
“Sit with him until I get back. As much I hate the idea, I should call Mycroft, let him know what’s happening. He can decide whether to tell their parents.”
He stood, a little unsteady from the whiskey, took Sherlock’s outstretched hand and helped him out of his chair. He leaned in and pressed his face into Sherlock’s shoulder, breathing in fabric softener and the sharp scent of hospital-issue soap.
She sipped her tea and scrolled through the news on her phone. Hockey, politics, more hockey. The Senators had made the playoffs by the skin of their teeth and were fighting off elimination by the Rangers.  She scrolled some more, settling on a Huffington Post article about One Direction.  She still nursed a not-so-secret crush on Harry Styles.
He planned to use the time to write up some case notes and finally go through the hundreds of pictures of Rosie on his laptop. There had to be a few he could delete. How many pictures could one man collect over eighteen months?
Kate shook her head. “You think? I tried to tell you that, if you recall.” She stood and waved at the waitress. “I’m cold. Let’s walk.”
The door flew open and John walked through the door, a cup of steaming tea in one hand, the newspaper in the other.
“The Cold Case Unit – that’s me and three other detectives – we review old cases, re-contact witnesses. We rerun old DNA results through the database, looking for new hits, that sort of thing. Sometimes a case is reopened because someone comes forward with new evidence. Other times, if the case is high profile enough, it gets reviewed every few years. That’s how I came into this one. I didn’t have any expectations, really, I was just going to interview his family and friends – but then it got weird.”
– a woman, mid-thirties, attractive in a pleasant, bakes her own bread, environmental warrior sort of way, sits in the chair between Sherlock and me and tells us her story. She hasn’t heard from her sister in a fortnight.
She sat in Sherlock’s chair, a half-eaten pasty, an empty chips box and three Diet Pepsi cans on the table beside her. Mrs. Hudson had given up offering her tea, and had a case of the soda delivered the day before.
“Yes, well, it’s gone now.” He stands and takes a small spray bottle from his coat pocket. “Close the curtains, John.”
dead, not because he wasn’t smart enough to pull it off, but because John knew, at the core of his being, that Sherlock would never have done this to
She bent down and shoved the papers back into the file. Briefly held Sarah’s photo between two fingers. There was no way she could ask for Sherlock’s help now.
Lauren stepped between John and Sherlock.  Her voice was low and full of warning, “This is our wedding and you two are not going to fuck it up. If you need to behave badly, do it somewhere else.” She pointed a finger at John. “And yes, we invited him. It was probably mad, but we did it and we told you we did and you never said no, so you don’t get to throw a tantrum now.”
Lestrade was leaning against the wall of John’s building when the cab pulled up. John paid the fare and was about to close the door behind him when the driver shouted after him, “Sir, you forgot your cane!”
He shook his head at his appalling housekeeping. Why hadn’t he ever noticed? Oh yes. He heard his own voice in his head.
Sherlock pushed his chair back and stood. “John, I had no choice . . . Mycroft . . .” He came around the table but John held up a hand.
"Morning," Sherlock rasps, his voice rough with sleep. He turns towards John and leaves a trail of wet kisses along his collarbone, “Do we have time?”
I hear a rustling of papers and Greg takes a breath. “The Shipton Building Society is currently under investigation by the Major Economic Crimes Unit. Has been for almost six months. They suspect someone on the inside is opening accounts for sham corporations and then taking out mortgages in these companies’ names. The scheme generates more than enough cash to cover the monthly interest payments, so no one’s the wiser. They reckon at least ten fake accounts have been created over the past two years. With average mortgages of £200,000, that’s a shitload of exposure for Shipton. And that’s just the Holborn office. MEC thought they were getting close but two months ago their informant got very nervous, worried someone had caught on to her . . .”
“Don’t be melodramatic, John. No doubt I will discover the identity of your attacker in sufficient time for the doctors to—”
“No, you don’t think.” Kate’s fists were held tightly to her side. “When were you planning on telling me the real reason you’re in Ottawa? Huh?” She lowered her head and when she looked back at Sherlock, her eyes were wet.  “I thought you were actually showing some human empathy, coming here to tell me about Sarah. I thought . . .” Kate swallowed hard and the anger drained from her. She bit her lip and stared at Sherlock.
him. Friendship is not such a big compromise after all: it’s what John has given him before, it’s something given to him in place of nothing. No. It’s not a compromise. It is a gift, and he
So, he doesn’t speak. He stays, touching Sherlock’s blankets, offering a reassuring presence for him to cling on if the night was too bad, if his mind is too much. He doesn’t speak. He doesn’t ask…
The next time he wakes, it’s to the straight, sharp light of noon falling from the windows. The curtains are drawn and he feels a weight lift when his eyes open to find Sherlock in his armchair, cuddled up, face turned to contemplate the unlit fireplace. John’s mind can find and pinpoint the last time he’d seen him like that, with the trembling shadows of a winter fire on his sharp features.
He might as well give up now on this whole fatherhood thing. Clearly, it doesn’t suit him. He can’t even calm her down to have a bath. A fucking bath! It doesn’t matter how he does it, she just doesn’t need him right now. He is not helping.
There’s a moment of hesitance but Sherlock slowly unearths shaky fingertips and takes what John is offering in a small plate over to his lap. John knows he’s succeeded and the result will be Sherlock nibbling truly like a small bird after some moments. He is ready to savour them all when a small whine bursts out of the baby monitor.
2. In John's therapy session, Ella uses an actual little CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) exercise. That doesn't mean John only does CBT however. Ella just thought it might be beneficial for John to use it in this particular matter.
If only he could pinpoint a specific point in time when their lives drifted apart perhaps Sherlock could mend this. But he does not know. And after that point -
Yet, there she was. The connection. Between them. And the world. Life. Peaking out from the covers of their darkness, silent as ever, picking up the moods of grown-ups. His little rose… Wanting to play, to sleep, to eat, to… To hold… No, not him, not her father… She wanted to be held by her spiritual one. Of course… John can see it every day; how she had missed
John grins, triumphant, and fishes the remote from the coffee table to turn on the telly. “See how easy it is when you just listen to me?”
Sherlock gapes at him. John bounces on his toes for a moment, avoiding his gaze but smiling. Small and secretive. ‘I’m blushing, aren’t I?’
He’s chasing Honeybee, and John is laughing, as Sherlock pretends to catch her once, twice, and then John whines that he’s also in the game, that Sherlock can try catching him too. In his ears, blocked by sunlight and barking and the colour-filled wind, it sounds like a challenge. Eyes sparkling, he does try to catch him, long white fingers grasping a jacket sleeve tight. But John pulls away, so fast that Sherlock loses balance and crashes down hard, only his coat softening the impact on the naked ground. The world slows down. But as soon as Sherlock blinks, John is beside him, down on the ground too, head propped up on an elbow, leaning close.
She smiled, “I think we know each other well enough by now, John. Of course you called. You like a puzzle as much as Sherlock did.”
He never heard from Pearce again. Hadn’t thought about him in months.  Didn’t know he had a wife or kid, didn’t know he was dead until tonight.
“I’m not.”Sherlock wanted to reach out, touch John’s shoulder and curl his fingers in John’s jumper and tell him everything. “It’s old. I don’t know why I kept it.”
She found a small stone church in Devon. The vicar was young and sympathetic and didn’t ask if the stories the tabloids screamed about Sherlock were true. She sent e-mails to everyone on John’s list and filled the church with baskets of lilacs and white tulips. Sherlock’s parents sent John a message reeking with false regret; they were in South Africa visiting friends and couldn’t (wouldn’t?) return. He started at least three angry all-cap replies but deleted each one. Mycroft, forever clueless, sent a cheque for £500 and maintained both his silence and his distance.
Not bloody likely. Not that he didn’t hold a certain fondness for the copper. He named his dog after him after all. Well, sort of. He’d thought he’d named his dog after him until John finally asked him where he came up with the name Graham. It was not your usual kind of dog name.
“You move back to Baker Street and resume what I can only surmise is a longstanding relationship, and now here you are, running back to your wife.”
“There were three previous transfers. They stopped after her death. It seems reasonable to pursue a connection between these payments and her attack.” He stopped talking and looked at her. “Kate?”
In the shower, he’d decided that if he couldn’t extract himself from whatever temporal whirlpool/dream he was caught in, he’d play along.
She let the phone fall into her lap. She looked up at Sherlock, wound tightly in wires and tubes. She knew that if she had figured it out after twenty minutes, there was no way he hadn’t.
John smiled. “I’ll be very quiet. You won’t know I’m there.” He leaned in and kissed Sherlock gently on the lips.
Sherlock stared at the ceiling through the darkness and admitted defeat. He was not going to sleep that night. He’d always had trouble sleeping, but now, especially after one of John’s visits, sleep was even more elusive. He couldn’t shake the feeling that John was disappearing a little more each time he saw him. His trousers were looser, his jumpers baggier, his voice thinner. One day he’d reach out and John would be gone.
“Really? MI6 and your brother’s name. And not a single working CCTV camera in a five street radius. I figure you’d be halfway to the Yard by now.”
Sherlock steeples his fingers and sighs. I walk over to him and nudge his knees, holding out the glass.
John was eight when his grandmother – his mother’s mother – died.  He understood death by then – he’d seen the stillborn calf Daisy had that spring, but like all bad things in life, he never expected it could happen to his family.
"Nothing.” His grin gets wider and Sherlock’s scowl gets deeper, but John wisely stays silent. It has taken a few years, but he’s finally mastered the fine art of knowing when to shut it. Sherlock, not so much.
She kept her voice as calm as she could manage. “Actually, John, I think it’s perfectly rational to be angry, to want to confront Mary and make her tell you the truth.”
“Boyfriend sounds so . . . I don’t know . . . adolescent. I loved him though. Wanted him too – not that he deserved it – selfish self-centered prick that he was.”
We sit outside after supper and drink the homemade beer – as weak as piss – and talk about the old days. About Lestrade and Molly and Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson and everyone else we used to know. We never say it out loud but every conversation ends with us wondering if they’d made it through.
John stood and walked toward Sherlock. “It was quiet.” He leaned up and kissed Sherlock lightly on the mouth and then stepped back. “This okay?”
Sherlock blinked. Blinked again. Cleared his throat. “John and I have reached an understanding. Kissed and made up is a gross over-simplification of a complex series of –”
First nicked at 13 – held up three old hens coming out of Evensong. He flipped fast through all the early years and stopped at the attempted murder of his partner – with a dart. That could be promising. If it wasn’t during a fucking dart game in a pub in Dartmouth. The guy lost an eye and Bellamy did two months.
“A parhelion.” Typical. He explains one word I don’t understand with a bigger one.  I swat him and he sighs. The sigh of a man forced to live with an idiot. “It’s an optical illusion created when the sun’s rays pass through ice crystals at the correct right angle.”
“Over dinner in a posh restaurant. Very grown up. Very sensible. She was everything Denise wasn’t. Which was a good thing.” He paused. “For a while, anyway.”
Doctors—one older, several younger—congregated around John’s bed.  Sherlock watched them from the doorway, and tried to find meaning in their posture and the odd word that rose above the background noises of the ICU. But it was like watching a foreign film without subtitles and he waited until one of them led him into the lounge. He was learning that shouting at John’s doctors, however intuitive, was counterproductive. “
At six, Sherlock was standing by the window, staring at the building across the street, while John watched the evening news on the telly. There was a brief mention of Moriarty’s murder near the end of the broadcast. Sherlock knew Lestrade would never solve this one.
Sherlock sat up, his legs outstretched in front of him and his back pressed up against the headboard. “Are you planning to punch me? It’s what you usually do.”
He scrubbed a hand across his face and tried to feel the pain meds working. They weren’t. He tried to imagine scenarios that would end with this turning out well. He couldn’t. For a brief second he thought of Sherlock, sitting alone at Baker Street, staring at his empty chair with a needle full of Bellamy’s heroin in his arm. He opened his eyes and tried to sit up. It wasn’t easy but he managed to swing his legs off the bed. He gripped the sheets and touched his feet on the floor. He turned to the door and  saw Sherlock standing there, watching him.
Sherlock sat beside him, eyes staring straight ahead, hands in his lap. He reached inside his suit jacket every few minutes for his phone, but stopped short each time. If Sherlock were anyone else, John would have thought he was nervous.
Mycroft turned to face John. “This is getting us nowhere. You will not contact Mary. Not today, not tomorrow. You will continue to correspond exclusively through emails and the postal service. Until such time that I feel it is necessary, she is simply someone you used to know.
Being with Sherlock was the first thing in years that had made any sense to him – he’d known from the first night that if he didn’t hold onto it, he’d slip back into the mire of his everyday life filled with bad decisions and solitary dinners.
In 2000, he bought a TV network. Two years later, he bought a national newspaper in Canada. And so it went. She imagined him like Pac-Man, eating up everything in his path.
After a moment, Sherlock walked through the door and stopped. John couldn’t read the look on his face. “Sherlock . . . I should . . .”
In the lobby, she bought two cans of Diet Pepsi and a chocolate bar. She had a little more than three hours before Chloe landed. She needed to change and fix her hair. She needed to think.
Sherlock pressed his hand against his chest. Kate knew it meant he was uncomfortable. She wondered if it was the injury or the subject. “I don’t know,” he said. “John, I . . .”
“I’ll drop you off at your hotel. Take a nap. See a show. Be a tourist today and tomorrow I’ll take you to Sherlock.” He muttered something else she didn’t catch.
“Live and let live, that’s my motto.” Mrs. Hudson lifted the bottle of Jameson’s, but Kate shook her head and held her hand over her glass. It would have been the third of what could only be called liberal pours and she didn’t need to sit in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen getting hammered, when she knew the real action was going on above their heads.
John watched Sherlock tap his fingers impatiently against the arm of the chair. When he  hung up, Sherlock said, “And?”
John watched them, smiling. He thanked David and started walking down the aisle, nodding at the few people he knew. He was halfway to the back when he saw him. He was standing in the last row, both hands gripping the chair in front of him, a fragile smile on his face.  After a long stunned moment, John walked over to him. "Why are you here?” he said.
He had nearly lost Sherlock so many times that he may have become slightly neurotic about the safety of his little brother. Mycroft had found Sherlock in back alleys, doss houses, police custody, homeless shelters and on one memorable occasion in the middle of a pub brawl.  He had even been to the morgue once or twice when he had been called to identify a body believed to be Sherlock’s. Mycroft knew more about class A narcotics and the twilight underworld of London than he could ever have imagined, or ever wanted, to know a scant decade and a half ago.
Mrs. Hudson remembered that when they had met the first time around Sherlock had grumbled about his big brother, and Mrs. Hudson had gotten the feeling that the trip to the states was almost a vacation from what sounded like his brother’s autocratic way of trying to run the younger man’s life. And now said autocrat was entering her kitchen.
It was a little over six months after he first came into contact with Sherlock Holmes that Greg met Mycroft Holmes. It was a cold and damp night when the call had come in that a body, a middle-aged man shot once in each of his limbs as well as in the heart and in the head, had been found in an alley in Southwark. Greg had no idea how Sherlock did it but he had managed to find them without being notified. It quickly became obvious that Sherlock had shown up high, for the third time in as many weeks, despite Greg having told him that he wasn’t welcome to a crime scene when he was in that state. Sherlock was, thankfully, sober most of the time when he consulted with Greg but his drug use was spiralling out of control. Not that Sherlock himself seemed to notice, or maybe he just didn’t care.
, John thought as he made his way to the kitchen and poured himself another cup of tea. After Mycroft left Sherlock would be indignant. He would throw himself on the sofa, saw on his poor violin or give seemingly endless monologues on the utter pain of having an older brother… Or he would leave the flat in a fury and hopefully walk off his temper.
When Anthea finally met Sherlock Holmes in person she found him unpleasant. A hostile, angry, disrespectful and spiteful young man who spat vitriolic words at Mr. Holmes, and at her as well though not nearly as much or as viciously. Over the years she had had a hard time deciding if he was more unpleasant when he was high or when he was sober, but the difference seemed to be minimal.
That image was further reinforced by the snippets she heard here and there from the personnel who did the actual groundwork. Apparently Sherlock made a sport of slipping away from them or loudly and publicly deduce their most embarrassing and secret thoughts and actions. To be assigned as a tail for their boss’s younger brother was nothing short of a punishment to be avoided at all cost. Not that anyone would dream of doing anything short of their very best when it came to an order from Mr. Holmes, especially in regards to his little brother.
Anthea’s estimation and respect for her boss had only risen the longer she worked for him. Mycroft Holmes was relentlessly organised, informed and meticulous. He had the intellect of a genius and the ability to manoeuvre information and people as needed for the good of the country. He was a demanding man to work for but she enjoyed the trust and the power she had as his PA.
Maybe there was a way she could compromise on what she was willing to do, or maybe give Sherlock a discreet heads up, and still get the money. Not that she was a greedy woman! She just had a feeling that Sherlock could be a somewhat destructive renter.
“I can’t say that I’m usually approached by family members of my renter’s. Now why is it that you wanted to speak to me?” She asked, once they had sat down and each had a cup of tea.
“If you don’t mind me saying so that sound much like the relationship between my own brothers” Mrs. Hudson said.
When Anthea first started working for Mr. Holmes she hadn’t felt all that comfortable with invading someone’s privacy the way Mr. Holmes did in the matter of his brother but it wasn’t her place to question his decisions and she had soon grown used to it. The dossier on Sherlock Holmes that she had initially been given revealed a multitude of hospital visits as well as a number of drugs rehabs that Sherlock had been sent to, against his will. Apparently he had also been arrested several times, for different offences, but that had dealt with by Mr. Holmes and the charges had been dismissed. In short, Mr. Holmes’s brother seemed to be a true menace!
As he heard the front door slam shut John sighed with relief. Now he could finally have a moment of peace in the absence of both Holmes brothers.
As a child Sherlock had been like the kittens Mycroft remember his aunt having when he visited the summer before Sherlock was born, or it would be more accurate to say that his little brother behaved like a kitten. Sherlock got into absolutely everything, was insatiably curious, adventurous and had been fiercely determined to go his own way and do his own thing. Their parents had often needed Mycroft’s help in looking after the boy as none of them possessed the boundless energy that Sherlock seemed to have.
Stunned Greg just stared at him for a moment. Brother? The man hardly resembled Sherlock. They had different bone structure and while Sherlock had dark curly hair this man’s hair was more straight and in an auburn colour. As Mycroft came closer though Greg could see the same intense and calculating look in his eyes as Sherlock had.
“Yes, but I do hope that your brothers have not fought the same demons that Sherlock has” Mr. Holmes replied. “My brother has always had a way about him that separated him from those around him, even me though we both share an above average intellect. He has had peculiar behaviour issues and because of that he has spent time at various hospita-“
On one hand it was obvious that he cared for his brother, and lord knows that Sherlock could give a person a lot to worry about, but at the same time the subtle threat of power he seemed to exude was very unsettling. She wondered if he ever thought about how the road to hell are paved with good intention. Mycroft Holmes she felt was decidedly not a ‘Live and let live’ kind of person.
When the young man had approached her just before the trial though she knew that he had proven himself to be a truly good person. He might have been high on drugs now and again, not to mention his other eccentricities, but Mrs. Hudson firmly believed in a ‘Live and let live’ philosophy. She had told him that she would probably return to London now that her husband was on death row and that she owned a house with several flats that she had planned to rent out. He gave her his number and when Mrs. Hudson had settled down in 221A Baker Street she reached out to him.
Standing in the doorway and watching as he entered the backseat of a sleek black car across the street Mrs. Hudson thought about the mixed feelings she had regarding Mr. Mycroft Holmes.
John still felt as if he hadn’t quite gotten over that first meeting with Sherlock’s brother. Who on earth thinks that the proper way to meet your younger sibling’s new friend/potential flatmate is by kidnapping them and taking them to an abandoned warehouse? And then keep up with the kidnapping ever so often? Stupid question; a Holmes that’s who!
Years later he learned that Mycroft had taken Sherlock to the rehab by force in the end but it had worked that time around. Sherlock kept complaining about Mycroft’s overbearing tendencies and his need to control his younger brother’s life but Greg could sympathise with the elder brother. He didn’t doubt that Mycroft’s behaviour came from a love for his little brother as well as a deep-seated fear, born from the years of watching Sherlock slowly destroy himself, of losing said brother. Mycroft wasn’t so different from most protective big brothers out there.
“Well, Detective Inspector, you have given me some food for thought. We will without a doubt meet again, though we’ll have to see under what kind of circumstances. Now if you excuse me I have a brother to find.”
Despite Mycroft’s hard words and the rigid look on his face, Greg could see the miniscule cracks in the façade. He wasn’t a DI for nothing and it was apparent to him that this man loved his brother. Mycroft was losing hope of Sherlock surviving much longer if he kept living the way he did.
Right now John was sitting in his chair in the living room of 221B watching the Holmes brothers arguing once again. Probably over something they had covered a hundred times before. At least neither of them was looking for John’s input and it left him free to consider Mycroft.
Sherlock knew that John was the kind of man who preferred his government to be transparent and therefore was uncomfortable by the mere existence of a role such as Mycroft’s. Someone who could have you removed, locked up or killed with one simple decision, without facing any judicial repercussions from it. His older brother’s apparent lack of empathy didn’t help either. For about a week after the first time they got rid of all of Mycroft’s surveillance equipment John had been noticeably more edgy and alert. Almost as if he expected Mycroft to swoop down on them for some perceived mistake and have them locked up or worse. Sherlock had tried to tell him that there was no reason to worry about something like that happening and maybe John had taken him on his word and calmed down, or he just got used to the situation like he had gotten used to being beleaguered in Afghanistan.
“Violet.” John choked out the name of his daughter for the first time. “Violet Grace.” It felt strange and wonderful and frightening. “Violet after my grandmother and Grace –”
"Sod off," John said, panting a little, pain shooting up his arm. He tried to flex his hand and winced. “Who were you snogging just then? Me? Or Simon bloody Lockwood?”
He was still standing there when a cab stopped in front of 221B. A woman – familiar despite the darkness – stepped out of the back seat and slammed the door. He heard the bottom door open and close, followed by loud footsteps on the stairs. “Sherlock, I think we’ve got a visitor.”
Later, John fit himself neatly into Sherlock, his arm curving over his back, his hand tucked warmly under Sherlock’s body. John thought Sherlock had fallen asleep when the feather-light breath of Sherlock’s whisper drifted across his skin, “Stay with me.”
Two weeks later, John made an appointment with Dr. Thompson. He hadn’t been to see her since before his wedding. He couldn’t bring himself to go – not even after he found out the truth about Mary, and not during those long months after she shot Sherlock and he’d taken refuge at Baker Street. While it was still happening, talking about it was impossible. Saying the words out loud would only make them more real and more terrible than they already were.
This was Sarah’s file. She recognized the photo, she’d taken it a month before Sarah died. She was standing under a tree by the canal, not far from where she was attacked. How did Mycroft get hold of it? Sarah looked so young, was it really only five years ago? She flipped quickly through the pages – each one a piece of the puzzle of Sarah’s life – photos and bank statements and school records. The flyer for her first exhibition (
Before John could remember one of the thousand reasons why he shouldn’t do this, before Sherlock could say no, before he could change his mind, he leaned forward and wrapped one hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulled him close and pressed his mouth hard against his. Sherlock gasped and John thought that maybe he’d got it wrong after all, that maybe it was too late to get back what they’d never really had, and then decided if this was the only chance he ever got, he was going to make it the single, longest, best kiss there ever was. He slipped his tongue between Sherlock’s lips and the taste of him, the wetness of his mouth, the feel of his tongue, hit him like nothing ever had. He made a sound deep in his throat.
John let go of his wrist. Sherlock laid the pin on the dresser and walked to the chair across from the bed and sat down.
Mycroft shrugged and pulled out his phone. “I’m not sure what I did. I’m not sure what anyone can do.”
She followed two doctors and a nurse out of the elevator into the ICU. She heard voices coming from Sherlock’s room. She slowed down and listened. John, obviously upset. And . . . Mycroft Holmes. All syrup and snoot. She stopped just outside the door and leaned against the wall. She poked her head around and saw John standing, hands fisted at his side. Sherlock’s bed was empty; they must have taken him for another scan.
Apparently the man never answered a question. “Her name was not always Mary Morstan. Since there had never been a reason to us to meet, we – I – did not make the connection until it was too late.”
Sherlock came hard, growling and biting against John’s shoulder. John loved him most in that moment. And he let himself believe that Sherlock loved him too.
He lays out the facts, finds connections, makes deductions. He’s a brilliant schoolboy in a classroom of idiots. But there are things Sherlock cannot deduce, conclusions he will never draw, murders he will never solve. These are the cases that never make it into the blog, cases like this one. I don’t write them up because they’re bad for business. At least that’s what I tell him.
He paid and carried the glass to an empty table by the window. It was almost six, and the bar was crowded with office workers having a pint on their way home.
The place had not improved. Old men still dozed in worn armchairs, and one twitched as John passed, like a dog dreaming of rabbits. The smell of stale cigarette smoke, dirty bodies and something John imagined was regret still permeated the lobby. A woman lazily passed a dirty mop over the floor, leaving swirling patterns of drying grime in its wake.
John bit his lip and shut his eyes, thrusted again and his orgasm crashed over him. He was still trembling when Sherlock released his own cock from his trousers and John circled it awkwardly with his right hand, moving frantically until he could feel Sherlock coming. It sent another shudder through his body, like a faint echo.
John took a breath and tried to tease one thread loose from the tangled jumble of memories that filled his head. “He—” he forced himself to say his name—“Sherlock liked his tea with two sugars . . . unless he was forced to fetch it himself, in which case he was usually too lazy to look for it. I started buying packets of sugar since I never knew what I’d find in the sugar bowl. It drove me crazy at first.”
Sherlock walked in on Mary threatening to kill Magnussen in his own office – how did she get in? Where was his security team? In every picture and news story she’d found on the internet, there were always at least two large, well-tailored men standing or walking a few steps behind.
Two battered bookcases frame the living room window. They’re filled with old Scientific American magazines from the sixties and seventies. We’re up to 1969 – I read them to Sherlock every morning at breakfast. We can trade six issues for a whole tank of petrol, so we’re lucky.
Sherlock sat on the arm of the chair beside John, tapped the screen and showed him. The boy on the screen looked seven or eight – curly black hair, small round face, white polo shirt under a green sweatshirt. The boy smiled and picked up a large piece of poster board and held it in front of him for thirty seconds. It read:
Sherlock sighed. “The paperwork alone will give my brother a stroke. Not to mention the thought of having to provide security for an infant. . .”
no obvious motive. The investigators concluded it was an attempted carjacking. The unsub – unidentified subject – must have shot Goodale when he resisted, got scared and ran off. He still had his wallet and keys.”
Mycroft ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t expect to reveal so much.” He looked at John. “I have a soft spot for my brother, infuriating as he may be, and I fear these last weeks have made me sentimental. My only objective is and has been to keep him safe. A daunting task at the best of times. But surely John, you do see what you’re doing to him?”
If Sutton was surprised by the question, he didn’t let on. “I’ve only just returned from a conference in Amsterdam. My phone has been off all day. I refuse to pay roaming charges.” He sat down behind his desk. “What can I do for you?” He pointed at a chair by the window. “Please, sit down.”
Over the clatter of dishes and the static of a hundred conversations, Sherlock closed his eyes and smelled chlorine and Semtex. He remembered playing the game that was never his to win, John standing by his grave under a brilliant summer sky. He remembered his own hand spread out against a brick wall in an alley somewhere in Serbia, knowing that if he took his hand away, he would collapse and never get up again. He leaned back in the booth, tracing patterns in the condensation that coated his glass.
“Half an hour ago. She said the poison is good, she said. Mad scientist good. She’s been trying all day to get in contact with her old professor – some kind of genius – wrote the textbook on anti-toxins. Other than that, she just keeps re-running tests.”
Sutton drew a knee into Sherlock’s groin and they smashed against the desk. Sutton grabbed a letter opener and jabbed it into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock’s hand flew to his neck and Sutton crawled away towards the gun. Sherlock rolled the other way, pulled the opener from his neck, blood already starting to spurt, and crawled around the front of the desk.
Kate took a breath. “Sorry – it’s nothing.” If nothing was the fact that in some misguided grand gesture of . . . She looked at the screen again.
Sherlock was dead, lost, limp and sprawled across the bed. John moved up to lie beside him and Sherlock tried to get to him, but John just leaned up on one elbow and took his own cock in his hand. John was panting, his hand moving in quick, slick movements, and then his panting turned to low, desperate groans and he came while Sherlock watched.
“I’ll go fetch the coffee,” John offered and started dressing. “I think the girl at the counter fancies me, she gave me free biscuits last time.”
“The doctor said it might be nothing. Told me to come back next week and they’ll repeat the scan. Sometimes a shadow is just a shadow.”
So he did. Volunteered to be a field surgeon. Got himself shot in the shoulder for his efforts, but never changed his mind that turning in Pearce had been the right thing to do.
“Bollocks. The kid ended up in my operating theatre in Helmand. I removed his spleen and one of his kidneys. He lost a fucking eye. Pearce did that to him.”
“Yes, of course. He wasn’t interested in the merchandise unless I could provide the antidote as well.”
Sherlock sat down in his chair, and noticed that John had changed into a blue shirt. The blue shirt that he usually wore on second dates. He filed that away to think about later.
Outside the restaurant, Sherlock said, “I need to walk.” He started down the street, then stopped and turned. “Aren’t you coming?”
“Sherlock’s homecoming.” Kate walked back into the sitting room. “Though I think he’d be happier if we left him alone.”
Sherlock later thought of those years –his disappearance and his return – as his dark ages. He’d spent hundreds of days chasing ghosts, following leads, drowning in the despair that he would never make it back. He spent most nights trying to find a reason not to slide into the haze of a hit.
John was going to be sick. Again. He left the room and found the toilet at the end of the hall. When he came back, the sour taste of bile lingering in his mouth, he watched as Sherlock pocketed the envelope. John coughed and Sherlock turned and looked at John, his eyes sad and full of something that ached like a bruise.
She could hear John in the kitchen running the water. Probably making more damned tea. It was like living through an episode of
feel better. In any case, they’d been saying good-bye to each other since they’d left home for Uni, he’d be happy to leave it at that. The only person that really mattered was –
What the fuck? Twelve months of silence, of never wanting to see Sherlock again, months of pining for him every day, months and months and not thirty seconds in and they were shagging. Well, he was. Sherlock was hiding in the bathroom.
Thanks again to peg22 for filling in all my empty spaces, both on the page and in real life. Though she is beginning to wonder how much longer I can avoid the mess that was the last half hour of HLV.
She guessed Sherlock was having Mary followed – and if the texts were any indication, by someone who enjoyed doing it. The girl she’d met earlier, the one who told her about Vauxhall Cross, was probably one of Sherlock’s too.
The lights in the flat were on, but there was no sign of Sherlock. He sank into his chair, closed his eyes and wished for someone to bring him an empty glass, two ice cubes and the bottle of Jameson from beneath the sink.
Sherlock didn’t have the heart to continue what he’d always thought was a delicious game of make John stomp off somewhere. He was also unsure what they were doing. They had never done this bit before. He’d obviously missed every clue (subtle and not so) the last time. Sherlock put his hand over John’s. “Was I wrong? Did you not want me to kiss you?”
Greg opened the bottom drawer of his desk, pulled out a pack of cigarettes and tossed them to Sherlock. Sherlock took one and threw the pack back on the desk. Greg came around the desk and motioned to the window. They moved to the window and Greg opened it.
Sherlock swallowed hard and tried to say something. This could not be a stroke. Or a dream. He could actually smell the tea. Earl Grey.
He remembered everything that happened that first night – shooting the cabbie, the Chinese dinner after, the walk through the empty streets back to Baker Street, the slow climb up the stairs to the flat, the slower fall into the realisation that this was what he’d been waiting for.
"It'll pass in a minute, just try to relax—” Sherlock frantically reached for John’s hand, found it, and clutched tightly. He was obviously in considerable pain, but it appeared that the panic of not being able to breathe was overriding everything else.
“Mycroft can take care of himself.” He went back to his phone. She wondered how long it would take him to find the download of
“Other than that ridiculous display in January, for which I should be grateful I suppose, not a trace.”
“This is nuts.” She stared out the window, trying to breathe evenly. “Everything was arranged,” she repeated.
Kate walked a step into the room just as John snapped, snatching a handful of Mycroft’s well-pressed shirt and throwing him hard against the wall. He wrapped a hand around Mycroft’s throat and squeezed. “I told you, don’t talk about my wife.”
Shut down again. Kate sighed and walked back into the living room. Why was she still here? Coin toss aside, of course. She’d spent the last few days alternating shifts at the hospital with John and filling her notebook full of scribbles and theories and not much else. She’d resolved not to say anything about Magnussen or Mary or the baby to Sherlock until he was better. To pass the time, they played chess when he was up to it and hearts when he wasn’t. She brought him cookies and tea and in a weak moment, probably brought on by too much morphine and not enough John, he explained how he’d managed the fall from the roof. “It was quite easy, really,” he said with a small smile. “It was leaving him that was hard.”
“Not yet. I’ve left more messages.  His lab is at all away a conference. We’ll find something soon, I promise.” She was a terrible liar. “Good-bye, John,” she added and hung up.
Giant pregnant Mary returns . . . “Wait, you’re certain it was Anna, your daughter?  It’s been a long time.”
“A name on a list of Moriarty’s associates. Nothing more – I never sussed out her connection to Goodale. Something came up and I moved on.”
“Oi, there.” John set his tea on the bedside table and took Sherlock’s chin in his hand, staring at his eyes. “Did you take your medication last night?” His other hand slid down and grasped Sherlock’s wrist. “Your heart is beating too fast.”
“I don’t know,” she said. “I love Chloe. But I loved Sarah too.” She wiped a hand across her eyes. “Fucking hell, Sherlock.”
“I didn’t. Donovan did. She lives nearby and recognized the crest on the boy’s sweatshirt. She did make it clear, however, that her intention was to help you, not me. She sent the video to the head teacher. The child is called Ronan Pearce.”
“I’m not sure.” He has that look he used to get when he was in the middle of a grand deduction.   “It’s as if I’m seeing echoes. Well, not seeing exactly –”
The Blind Beggar had never been posh. Not a hundred years ago when it served its first pint of ale, and certainly not now.
Party’s off, thank god. I convinced him to cancel my birthday party. I’m not sure where the idea for the party came from (Sherlock’s never willingly played host in his life) but he’s agreed to cancel with only a few hours of pouting. I’m relieved. I’ve watched enough telly to know that when you have a birthday party for a dying man, it’s not a lot of fun. People feel the need to say deep, thoughtful things about the meaning of life. Which all end up sounding like complete bollocks. Plus I’d have to act noble and stoic, and I am neither of those things. Still, I’m glad it’s me. I’ve thought a lot about what I would do if it was him. I wouldn’t tell him this, but I’m not sure I could live without him. I mourned him for a very long time once, and I know I can’t do it again. He’ll do fine without me. He has his research and his writing and his bees (don’t get me started on those damned bees). Does that make sound like a selfish wanker? Probably. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Borrowing trouble, Mum called it, do you remember?
He slid into the chair opposite her, unwinding his scarf. “I’d pay a small fortune if I could get them to ship these overseas.” He fingered another one off the plate and lifted it to his mouth.
“Magnussen was attempting to discover whether Chloe is your pressure point – your vulnerability – your Achilles heel. The one thing – or one person – that you would risk everything to keep safe.”
While John talked, Sherlock had slowly pulled himself up and off the bed. He grabbed John’s shoulders. “Stop it.” He pulled John close, wrapping his arms around him. “The only thing that matters is our plan,” Sherlock whispered against John’s head. “We will find a way through this, John.”
He shifted uncomfortably in the chair, crossed and then uncrossed his legs. Checked his watch, thirty minutes left.
“We’ve got another nursery rhyme,” she said. “They found it Bellamy’s pocket.” She handed Greg the bag.
in this daydream), they’d both cry a little, giddy from champagne and happiness. Later she’d take Chloe to bed and . . . Kate closed her eyes, her breath quickening, imagining the press of Chloe’s body against hers, the taste of Chloe on her tongue, her soft moans.  She slipped her hand under the covers and between her legs.
Sherlock grabs his coat and scarf from the chair and strides to the door. “Come, John. We have work to do.” I follow him. Because that’s what I do. It’s what I’ll always do. For as long as he lets me.
. Sherlock. He was supposed to be watching for signs of concussion, not letting him sleep for four hours.
No one had mentioned Magnussen, although no one was naïve enough to believe it was over. John thought of these past few months like half-time, each team strategizing how to approach the final period. And now there was Kate Bryant, wandering onto the pitch with no clue about the dangerous game being played there.
They fell back against the bed, sweating, breathing hard. John pulled his jeans up past his hips. Sherlock headed to the loo, and came back wearing nothing but a satisfied, if slightly embarrassed, smile. He pulled back the sheet and lay down beside John.
He barely noticed that John had shifted, pulling them both down into John’s chair. Sherlock placed his hands on the arms of the chair and pressed his chest against John’s. John reached his hand around and pulled Sherlock closer. Sherlock couldn’t breathe, didn’t want to breathe and then really needed to breathe, all in the space of a few seconds. He pulled his head away and took a deep breath.
“You know I can come back later.” Lestrade sighed and stood. “You two are somewhere else today.” He checked the time on his phone. “I’m off duty in an hour,” he said as he slipped the phone back into his pocket. “Why don’t you meet me at the Queen’s Arms at eight? You can buy me a pint and tell me how the hell there were no footprints near the body.”
She was showered and dressed before John and Sherlock made an appearance. It had snowed during the night – barely a centimetre – but it was coming down fiercely now – big heavy flakes that carpeted the parked cars and balanced on the branches of the bare trees.
“I know no such thing.” Sherlock gripped the chair and pulled himself up. “It’s precisely because I do have skin in this game that I must stop Magnussen from ruining Mary. From hurting you.”
They booked a small hotel near Edinburgh for the ceremony and reception. Outdoors if it was sunny. Indoors if it wasn’t. September in Scotland was likely to be sunny
That wasn’t the question he expected. He almost sounded concerned. John didn’t answer. He had to be careful. Mycroft was nothing if not a master manipulator. John knew why Mycroft didn’t want him talking to Mary – at least not without an approved script in hand. And he knew why Sherlock didn’t want him here. Even Kate fucking Canada had an opinion about it. She may not have the jersey to prove it, but she was definitely playing for Team Sherlock.
Sherlock stands, on careful feet, without making a sound. The tremor of his left hand he hides with disgust in the pocket of his dressing gown.
For some inexplicable reason, John has invested in his wellbeing. During the good moments it brings a smile to his face. During the bad, his mouth is aching with bile.
His body descends into autopilot, battle-weary tension seeping out to be replaced by needles pinching his every muscle into numbness. His mind travels to a time far gone, to 221B empty and silent. Not the silence of impending doom, but the one after it. With dust hanging in the corners of his vision, with a forever unoccupied armchair opposite his own, the one he looked and looked and looked at, trying to will the man who belonged there back into existence.
John clears his throat. "I should-". Sherlock waits, tilting his head a little to the side. "Would you mind? Me and Rosie, staying", John adds in a steady voice. Sherlock blinks. "I know it's a bit of a rush, but I just-" He shuffles, looks at his shoes as if seeing them for the first time.
“Great”, John had breathed. He had stepped over the mess and bent down to coax Honeybee from her hiding spot, like plucking a kitten up from a bush. She had been swiftly strapped back in her baby chair, which John pushed to the side of his armchair, safely away. “Why can’t you just stay in one place for a while?”. It had been almost ironic in the small huffed breath that followed it. Louder than it should have been.
Sherlock lingers close. Not close enough, not close like he used to do, but stays in John’s orbit. His presence is quiet, self-contained, whatever words he means to say lingering on the edges of his fingertips, the tilts of his head, the pursing of his lips. But but it is solid enough to chase away the eerie silence eating away at John’s bones, the ugly whispers it brings with it. Sherlock is becoming his very own moon, binding the caprice of the tide inside him, guiding the waters to push, pull, find a rhythm, turn into waves,
“I am sorry. For behaving like I did. Twice.” John looks at the mug in his palm. The result of yesterday’s first destruction as the china set is in pieces for the trash. “I know, this is bad. For Rosie and you. I don’t- haven’t figured out everything yet, but I know... I’ve got to... I’ve got to go. For everyone’s sake. I’ll-I’ll see Ella and maybe try rehab-”
Sherlock waits as John’s breathing returns to normal. Honeybee’s breaths are soft and even against his skin, warm puffs of air. He had known this way to calm her since a little more than a year ago. She was so much smaller then, almost half in size, a small kitten nestled into his arms. Then, he would play for her, compose little lullabies and tunes, hum to her with the unfurling of the melodies. Her gurgled laughter was chirpy, then, and her eyes quick to shine. But sometimes, even then, his violin did not work. She would whine and whimper and reach small grabby hands to him, with longing enough that his playing withered. Those times, or when she would wake up from a toothache, a bad night’s sleep, a tummy-ache, or just because of some loud noise, those times she needed a warm hug, and the reassurance of a steady heartbeat against her ear to guide her back to sleep. To feel wrapped in a cocoon, enclosed within a seashell’s embrace, it never failed to calm her down. Skin contact helped, and when given the chance she always burrowed close to what meagre warmth his sternum could give. Sherlock tried to give her all the hugs and touches and reassurance she needed. How she lacked them he could feel in his bones, how she needed love, as if she were a starving baby bird. But then Honeybee was taken away from him, and he could not protect her from loneliness anymore.
“Or is it?” Sherlock sits up on the edge of his chair, seeming immersed, but there are warning bells going off in John’s mind. “Harriet.”
Greg Lestrade, was at an interrogation room. Reporting his own wrongdoings as something Sherlock Holmes deserved. It was Greg’s job to not interfere with his statement. He could not have possibly been there as a friend. He let John have it. All the madness. The miserable ‘shot Magnussen in the face’ excuse. So much pain… all caused by him. John Watson. The man Sherlock Holmes tried to save by that single firing shot. And John had gone and said… He draws back, disgusted with himself.
The light that had filled his body when he woke up ebbs away, taking the weightlessness of his transport with it.
The problem is just one, staring him in the face; he can’t do this anymore. Sherlock was never good at this, anyway. Picking the words, avoiding. He could pretend, until his bones shattered. But not this. Not now.
Sherlock doesn’t need to respond, he just watches. John feels his gaze like a caress over him. Gentle and soothing.
? For matters as serious as where you’ll live, and you will do with your daughter, with life? If you hold my alcoholism against me, fine, but he is a junkie, barely out of rehab. I have been clean for three years, Johnny.
“Alright. Good. Let’s start with something easier, shall we?” She leans forward, hands over her knees. He only looks at her pad. He reads upside down. There’s nothing wrong written on it. There’s nothing saying he’s nuts.
He shudders. And he knows then that John does not remember about that handful of nights. And that if he does, there is nothing of importance in the memory to him.
There’s so much more hidden in that word. He can’t not say it back now. He wants to find out. He wants to give back.
Honeybee is a different matter. They haven’t talked about it, but Sherlock can tell that the relationship with her is a sore point for John. He tries, and yet often gets rejected, pouted at, ignored. Progress may be slow, but still it is progress. Like a few nights ago. Her offering her elephant is a sure sign of trust.
“Won’t happen again.” John deadpans. He’s aching from the inside. If it were to happen again, he would find a way to stop it once and for all. No matter what.
With this and that they had forgotten the fireplace and tonight was pretty chilly. John stands up and grabs a blanket, folded and deposited on his armchair. Sherlock’s firm gaze trembles and he bites his lip. Just for a moment. He reaches with his right hand and takes it, getting up with a huff and stumbling a bit to the sofa, closer to the electric heater, trying to maintain his
The kitchen is silent. Sounds non-existent. Sherlock is listening. Tuning in. Maybe searching for John’s sounds around the flat, just like John does so many times every day. Constantly, in fact. Having lived in an empty Baker Street, with not a pip of sound from Sherlock’s then crazy and manic moods and character, is the worst John has ever lived through. His body is attuned to make sure it’s not all happening again. Programmed to check that Sherlock is there. Alive. Breathing air. The same air John does.
John stifles the thoughts saying he was the only reason she couldn’t sleep. Because he wasn’t good enough. He knows it’s not true. He repeats it silently until he believes it a fraction, his head turning to other pressing matters. Matters making his stomach burn.
He should get up. Swing his legs off the bed, reach for his dressing gown, tie it at the side. He should walk to the bathroom, splash water onto his face, wash his teeth, comb his hair. Make his way to the kitchen, wait for John, if John is not there, or greet him if he is. They will have tea and breakfast as they do every morning, Honeybee will be changed, fed. In his mind he can see every movement, every detail, orchestrated to perfection. But when he instructs his limbs to move, none is willing to. Roots might as well have sprung from his vertebrae, tying hm to the mattress. Or perhaps he truly did sink, his body hitting the ocean bed, with its colorful corals and plastic bag body of jellyfish. Is that how it would be in reality? Not that he really cares. Even if he did, finding out implies moving. Moving is impossible.
Sherlock’s arms are already there to catch her, even if he was nibbling like a sparrow on a scone when they entered.
He is on his knees on the tiles of the kitchen floor with his back turned to him. He is gripping the counter above him with one hand, as if he were trying to hold on but slid down, fell.  His other hand is fisted in his hair, pulling at it as if it was wheat to be harvested. His teeth show over pulled-back lips. He looks like he wants to eat his own skin raw; and when that does not work, and his hair refuses to be plucked form his skull, his palm strikes his head. Again. Again. And then he grabs new and old strands both and yanks, harder, and that wretchedly strangled sound that tears itself deep from his chest rises and falls with renewed viciousness.
were. Both of them. Pushing each other out of darker thoughts and paths. Back and forth. Back and forth.
again if they want to. He looks up. Sherlock’s expression is soft. It’s not how he used to look when John repeated something obvious. His sharp gaze is mellowed and his lips are parted, breathing. He’s waiting. There’s wetness on John’s lower lip. His tongue has decided this to be an appropriate time to feel through the chapped skin apparently. He tears his eyes away with effort.
Light, and warmth. The first coherent thought coming to his mind, is that he felt good; both feather-light and solid, well-defined. Arms stretching above his head as his eyelids struggle to open, he revels in the freedom of movement, his body quiet and not protesting with pains, or nausea. As far as he can remember, there had been no dreams either, no brine of saltwater clinging to the back of his throat.
“I am saying, that you should reconsider certain things, Johnny. You really should” Harry lets her voice trail off. It suggests enough.
“We have discussed, with Ella. A lot. About… Look, the problem, with me, it’s not… It’s not the drinking. I mean, it
Sherlock stays still. Harry does not see him as she walks to the chair beside the sofa. And then she’s lost from view. Sherlock gravitates closer to the fridge on silent feet. He leans against it, and waits. Its monotonous mechanical purring calms him, helps him focus on something other than the gallop of his heart.
A hole inside him had filled, and thought it felt that this had happened overnight, the shift was in truth the movement of a tectonic plate; incremental for years and years, and then suddenly it peaked and transformed the world around it.
“What are you referring to, John?” Her tone is patient. How can she do both at once? Press and pull. Negotiation. Interchanging. Bargaining for which emotion will be unearthed more easily. Which trigger will unearth it and how.
John’s gaze falls on the most honest expression he has ever seen and it is that which unsettles him.
Even though it is early, he can’t remember falling asleep. What remains of the previous afternoon in the forefront of his mind is a content, proud smile and
There’s no air around him. Not enough oxygen. His lips are pursed together. His nostrils flaring but he can’t breathe. His insides are burning. Burning lungs as if he’s drowning for another breath, covered by heavy water, waves lapping at his body and sending him barrelling down. To the depths. His body eating itself. Searching for meagre reserves. His throat constricts and he wants to gag but he mustn’t. He mustn’t. If he opens his mouth only water will rush in. Only doom will find him.
With a deep exhale, John enters the kitchen. He needs the reminder sometimes. Some days. He knows there is darkness lurking in every corner, he knows his mind gets stuck in unhealthy and false patterns. But… it can change… The last few weeks have proved as much.
A wail, muffled against his chest. John flinches visibly. He tries to rock her up and down one more time with no result. She cries louder.
He froze. Everything froze. Ice spreading through him, from his core and out, cracking as it worked its way, immobilizing, through arteries, veins; solidifying muscle, numbing out nerves. Until what used to feel like his body was only an amorphous slab of mulch and cold.
“I’m sorry. About her.” John whispers, gaze to the ground, knuckles creaking on flexing fists. He’s still scared. Scared he’ll look up and Sherlock will melt or- whatever.
It’s not that he does not trust John, or his willpower. Quite the opposite -and so his worry fills him with guilt too. It’s that he fears for him. Every road, every shadow, every stranger outside of 221B is a potential threat. Sherlock’s skin crawls with the need to protect, that treacherous need that refuses to perish.
Isolation -one of his first and easiest solutions before- is unacceptable. He can’t just leave and give everything up. In any case, locking himself away from the world could end much worse for everyone. It’s a somehow comforting thought. The fact that he consciously feels this is crazy. Taking it out on his body, his mind, or washing it away with the bottles that lay down empty, in the abandoned living room last time he overdid it. It is crazy. It puts him off.
a problem and I will solve it, but… It’s not a cause. There’s… other things to deal with. Deeper than… Than that. I can’t talk about all of them now, I don’t even know all of them-”
John returned his attention to his plate. Sherlock managed to swallow against the unpleasant tingles at the base of his jaw. He tried for another spoonful. Saw John’s eyebrows knit together, his movements slow to follow his.
Sherlock never knows where the line is. Cannot be sure when it will appear next. But he knows it is there, delimiting the possible from the impossible. That it is in John’s hands, and John’s hands alone.
Sherlock’s chest deflates with a breath he’s been holding. John watches it, how he lifts Rosie up and down with his every sigh.
“The big ship sails on the ally ally oh.” John sings and Rosie sits back at his bouncing knees, clapping her thighs on the rhythm like a total expert.
She whines, not understanding the sudden outburst of emotion. Even though she loves being cuddled and coddled, she now picks up on the strange hue in his mood and is worried. Sherlock hurries to place her on the mat again and smile to reassure her. She pouts, boops his nose in silent question. He boops her back, affirming all is well, and she squeals and rushes to her toys again.
“What if… What if she… Won’t… Be okay?”, John finally says. His voice is small, smaller than the pods of green on the branches, smaller than the pebbles that strewn the small path, smaller than the constellation of tiny freckles on Rosie’s cheeks. But it is bigger than John himself altogether.
Deep down, I-… I couldn’t forgive you. For relapsing. I- I wanted you to be well. I wanted you to not care what happened to me, to live your life and never think of me again but…”
Every ‘good morning’ message on his phone, every breakfast they shared, every evening spent idly with dinner and sometimes crappy telly, every time John let him hold and take care of Honeybee. Guilt. John Watson’s guilt.
REMINDER TRIGGER WARNINGS: MENTION OF PAST TORTURE, SUICIDAL/SELFHARM IDEATION, ANXIETY ATTACKS, MENTAL BLACK-OUT/PHASING, PAST TRAUMA, ANGER ISSUES, PANIC ATTACKS
And how could Sherlock ever have forgiven him such a thing? How, when it’s inevitable, when it’s in his blood, in his brain, in his bones?
“I used to play with mine’s.” His gaze flickers up to John again, a shadow passing over his blue oceans. Even so, he smiles when he catches Rosie, looking at him in quiet expectation. He tilts his head, curls waving playfully at the motion. “Hers was real.”
The weather has decided to grace them with some bright sunlight, a warm exception to the bleak winter days. Most trees around them are leafless, but there are a few among them which have begun to sprout new life, small buds of green clinging onto their branches like tiny creatures in their eggs still, waiting for spring to hatch. It’s nearer than they think.
Melodies played on a polished violin. Stradivarius. The best sound if wielded by a master. And what a master indeed Sherlock was... Vivaldi, Bach, Paganini, Mendelssohn... John remembers. He longs. For the sweet transformed notes by Sherlock’s hands to guide him to sleep. For the nights he wasn’t afraid because Sherlock would be downstairs scribbling a composition. His repetitions lulling John deep under, well past the point of dreams.
like was much longer). He liked Oolong tea, coffee but never at home and never from Starbucks. He liked biscuits and expensive cologne and posh shirts. Rain storms. Most of all, he liked being the clever one in the room. John would have added his own name to the list, but most days he wasn’t completely sure about that either.
“Bollocks,” John says from the back seat. “Don’t act like you’re not thrilled to miss Christmas dinner with Mycroft. I’ve done you a favour.”
Mycroft was still talking. “So we have an understanding then.” It wasn’t a question. It was never a question.
Sherlock ignored him and continued. “He’s trained to look for the quick in and out. A coup de main, if you will. A swift and lethal response when a more measured approach is called for.”
He laughed. “I have no idea. You might say I scratch his itch. And some nights, when he’s feeling generous and no new wars have broken out, he scratches mine. Nothing more to it than that.”
She reached for the door handle and tugged it. The door was locked. “Goddamn it.” She leaned back in the leather seat. Crossed her arms. Uncrossed them when she realized she looked like a petulant teenager. Tried not to punch Mycroft in his self-satisfied pasty English face. “OK, you win. Go for it.”
“Used to. No time lately. And my knees tend to be angry with me for days after. ” He filled her glass and grinned at her. “You’re dying to ask about him, aren’t you?”
Sherlock thought. He opened the file and stared at the pages, willing the details to jog something . . . anything. He took a drink of tea and watched John pull his phone out of his pocket, tapping the screen.
“I always know you’re here, John. Always.” Sherlock took john’s hand and headed toward the bedroom. John managed to flip off the bathroom light as they passed.
“I am irrelevant in the equation. My job is simple. I will simply focus all my efforts into ensuring that Mary doesn’t feel threatened.”
“Nice story. But it’s got nothing to do with Mary,” John said. Kate recognized that tone – it was the same one used by every relative of every victim she’d ever had to break bad news to.
She handed him the bag of cookies and he opened it, looked inside and groaned. “Sod it. Who let Donovan buy the biscuits?” He dropped the bag on the floor beside his chair. “I despise macaroons.” He looked at her. “Not sleeping?”
Kate couldn’t breathe. She hung her head between her knees. Didn’t help. Things were getting fuzzy around the edges. Sarah had a secret savings account . . .
Sherlock put both hands on John’s knees and leaned forward until his mouth was against John’s ear. “When this is over, you can dream up all kinds of pedestrian ways to punish me for any slight you may feel during this investigation, and I mean all kinds of ways . . .”
It was Sherlock’s turn to frown. “Oh please. It was the night Lestrade took you out to that horrendous pub in Brixton and then left you for some, and I quote, “bird in yellow spandex with enormous tits.”
“To work? Next Monday.” He stands and straightens his tie. “You never said who was looking for her.”
“If you say ‘nevertheless’ again, I will punch you. Pearce was a bully and a hooligan. He should never have been in the army. I won’t apologize for having him tossed out.”
Baskerville. The Queen's ashtray. The day his first novel came out. Their wedding. Stories Sherlock had heard so many times he could tell them himself. Sometimes he had laid a hand on John's arm or caught his eye and John would pause and clear his throat and change the subject to the weather or the price of petrol.
He called in sick the morning of October 1. He told the new nurse he had migraine – not as far from the truth as he would have liked.
Sherlock sighed and moved his legs off John. He swung them around and sat on the edge of the bed. “Definitely not juice.”
“Just give me my coat.” John retied the gown and slid off the bed. Stepped barefoot into his trainers. At least they had let him keep his pants.
over the last few months. “Did Mycroft send you to check up on me? I’m sure this part of London is far too dodgy for his nibs.”
You’ve been awake for thirty-six hours but it feels like you haven’t slept since you left London. Three months that turned into six that’s going on eighteen. Each time you think you’re close to the end, Mycroft nudges the finish line further out of sight.
Kate shook her head. “And what about you?” She looked at Sherlock. “And what about the next person who comes through that door with information about Mary? It’s going to happen sooner or later. What are you going to do then?”
“Two weeks after she was killed, someone broke into our apartment. Nothing seemed to be missing except her portfolio case. I never reported it.” She leaned into Sherlock and he wrapped his arm around her shoulders. “Why would she do it?”
John doubted Greg would let him say no. “Sure. Will The Blind Beggar do?” He pointed his cane towards the pub at the corner. “Drinks are passable, just stay away from the pickled eggs.”
“You chose now to tell me about Sarah because you didn’t want to talk about John. Or the baby.” Kate stood and walked around the chair. “You outmaneuvered me, didn’t you?”
“So, go on,” Kate said as they walked down the street, the sun still sneaking between the buildings, “why are you grateful to Moriarty for his little trick? Is that why Mary left? What about John? Don’t think I haven’t noticed that you haven’t mentioned him yet.”
She licked the gelatinous filling from her fingers and went through everything again from the beginning.
Sherlock looked better than she expected. But her expectations had been low, so anything not-dead was good.
He reached in the other pocket and fingered the envelope of heroin. John had seen him nick it – if John made it through the next twenty-four hours he would consider giving it back. If not . . . He tapped out another cigarette and searched for a room in his mind palace where none of this ever happened. The cabbie slammed on the brakes and the cigarette flew out of his fingers.
He walked to the door, reached in his pocket and gave her a £20 note. “Buy some champagne. The good stuff.” He laughed. “As good as £20 will get.” He kissed her quickly on the cheek. “Thank you.”
There are bee hives in the orchard. Sherlock has taken charge of them and we have honey enough to last us through the winter. Each evening I watch him from the window, walking sure and steady back to the cottage, backlit by the setting sun, and know I will never ask for anything more.
Sherlock reached back with one arm and wrapped a hand around the back of John’s neck. He held him there, his fingers laced tightly in his hair. It was explanation and apology and declaration. All the things John knew Sherlock could never say.
He hesitated and Kate knew he was deciding how much to tell her, what percentage of truth to insert between the lies. “That his wife was Moriarty’s girlfriend and likely his accomplice? No. He found out sometime after they were married that Mary was not what she appeared to be. She told him that her real initials were A.G.R.A., but that may have been a lie too. I didn’t know about her connection to Moriarty. Not until yesterday.”
The only thing new was the desk clerk. He sat behind a wire grill, enveloped in the smoke of a fag that dangled precariously off his lower lip. He scarcely raised his head from his magazine to tell them they would find Vic Bellamy in Room 205. Ten quid would get them the key, he added.
Back in her room, Kate logged onto her computer and Googled Sherlock again. Lots of hits about his “miraculous” return from the dead, an entire site devoted to theories about how it was done (including Tumblr, Twitter and Reddit entries, #emptyhearse, #sherlocklives). A series of interviews given by his fiancée.
Mycroft sighed the sigh of a brilliant man surrounded by idiots. “Mary Morstan did not work exclusively for James Moriarty. Over the years, she accepted other freelance assignments. Usually for private contractors, and less frequently for government agencies that needed to distance themselves from actual events.”
and sat through a eulogy that was short and generic and left him knowing little more about Peter Lockwood than he had when it began. Between communion and the recessional hymn, with no idea why they were there, Sherlock stood and turned to leave. John pulled him back by his sleeve.
He slid a finger under the first one and opened it. Standard police report. Picture paper clipped to the upper corner. Victim. Young. Pretty. He hadn’t heard Sherlock talk about taking on any new cases. Then he noticed the maple leaf stamped in one corner, the RCMP insignia in the other.
There was a long silence. John and Sherlock stared at each other and Kate held her breath – she had no clue where this was going.
“Well, I just wanted to let you know you can stop looking. We’ve found our Anna. Or she found us, I should say.”
“I’ve got a nephew who emigrated there. Place called Prince George. He’s a teacher – computers, I think, or was it mathematics –”
Kate knew she had just been shut down by a pro. She was going to have to Google Mrs. Hudson when she got back to the hotel.
John. White hair and beard. Smiling. Healthy. He looked so . . . beautiful. But what was he doing here?
“Let’s get through the next few hours. If you don’t show any signs of concussion, you’ll get the morphine. Otherwise, you’re going straight to A&E.”
“I was explaining to John that it is imperative we retrieve whatever information Magnussen has about Mary. That is the only way John will be ever be safe.”
Sherlock tilted his head, and the light caught one side of his face and drew shadows under his eyes. He folded up the map and got it right the first time. “I went to sit in the garden before, while you were still asleep,” he said. He took a long breath. “I almost called Mycroft. I was going to tell him I was done. With all of it.”
John walked to the hotel bar and sat a table in the corner. Sherlock followed him but stopped at the bar to order drinks. He set two glasses on the table and sat opposite him. “Glenlivit. Neat.”
Sherlock looked puzzled. “Why would Mycroft want to get you out of town? Someone like you would hardly be in his crosshairs.”
“Get in. I’m the lucky one who gets to play chauffeur today. Why you can’t take a bloody cab . . . “
“Then don’t piss me off. All I need to do is poke you with a safety pin and you’ll bleed like a stuck pig.”
He took a second to admire the attention to detail this dream had and then thrust the paper towards John. “What’s the date on this paper?”
John looked back and forth between them. “Someone tell me what’s going on.” His voice was calm but Kate could hear the anger simmering beneath the surface. “Three hours, Sherlock. I leave you alone for three fucking hours . . .”
You slide carefully into a pew in the back, head down, hood pulled up. The church is a forest, the rows of marble columns line the nave like trees, stretching up to the sky-painted ceiling. You crave the silence it offers, and your ears strain to hear it. You lean back until you remember the stitches, painful, raw, less than professional, that wind around your hip and up your back. You reach into your pocket and wrap your fingers around the vial. You tip what’s left of the white powder onto the back of your shaky hand, snort it quickly and drop the empty vial back in your pocket.  You’ve got a few hours before you’ll need to find more.   It’s the least of your problems.
He’d known then that it did him no good to analyse was happening between them, and it would have done neither of them any good if John had admitted, to Sherlock or himself, that sometimes those dazzling, perfect moments were all he lived for.
Sherlock blows out a long loud breath. “Tedious,” he mutters. His leg twitches and he picks up his mobile and I know he’s about to text me something rude.
She told him about Goodale’s receptionist who was on the list of people she wanted to interview. When she went looking, she discovered that the receptionist had vanished a month after the shooting. Her parents told Kate that she’d been badly shaken by her boss’ murder and wanted to get away. They paid for a plane ticket to London, which she never used. They never heard from her again. They hired a detective who found no trace of her.
“You know how fucked up that sounds, right?” He looked down at Sherlock. “We need to have a conversation, Sherlock. The one we should have had months ago.” He sat down on the edge of the bed.
“In films, maybe. There are several treatments that have been tried – but usually on patients exposed to a much lower concentration. Vitamin A and N-acetylcysteine have been effective in some cases. Dr. Franklin can try it but I doubt . . .  If it is synthetic, then I suppose it’s possible that whoever designed the poison also designed an antidote.  This is all in my report.”
“Take more than that, mate.” He dropped what was left of his cigarette on the sidewalk. “Fancy a pint?”
In the bedroom, he left the light off.  He felt his way in the dark, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling he couldn’t quite see. He resisted the urge to check the time again.  Less than eighteen hours ago, he’d been lying here with Sherlock . . .
