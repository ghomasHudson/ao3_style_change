"The government doesn't have this, do they." Bucky's eyes are vulnerable when he looks up at Tony, but it's stated like a fact.
Alarms start going off far above them, and Thor runs up behind then from a hall. "It's the prisons, can you help?" He extends a hand to them.
"Get out of here," Sam says loudly, sounding rather annoyed. "Damn."
"I'm not kidding."
"I'm going to go talk to Bucky now, and I just want to make sure nobody up there is going to punch me." Her eyes flicker between Tony and Steve for a moment. "I'm sorry, are you Tony Stark? You look awfully like him."
As soon as the door closes, he hears Natasha laughing behind him, apparently delighted by his misery. "You're such a disaster Steven. Here have this posch cruptje." She hands him a broken chocolate chip cookie, and it almost makes up for her teasing him.
"MJ, you can come up here," Steve says. Tony makes a kissy face at him and he rolls his eyes. She does come and looks between them, and their joined metal arms.
He looks offended in the way that didn't look very offended, but he does shut up, spearing his fork into the spaghetti.
"Oh don't sell yourself short baby, I know you got some muscles in there too." Steve pokes him back, earning a grin.
Tony's metal encased fingers fly across the foreign plane controls, his irritably tense partner bouncing next to him. "What's the status," Steve asks for about the fifteenth time.
"You kissed me!" She points an accusatory finger at him.
Alas, there is nothing to be heard but the crackling of fire, warm against his back. Tony flies up into the air again, landing atop the hull of the plane. He searches slowly for any sight of red and blue, but there's nothing but white show and brown trees.
"Wait, what do you mean? Steve, you told her you loved her." Bucky sounds almost scandalized, but Steve considers it payback for all the nasty shit Bucky did in their apartment all those years ago.
i um.. have a foster son
ya, sounds good
I actually think it's really sweet.
"It wasn't him." Steve is sure he looks pathetic, sitting here with fresh tears streaming down his face.
"Call Peter Parker." Tony says to Friday, and the plane starts ringing.
"Oh my god. Why did you do that," Tony asks, suppressing a laugh as they step out of the elevator.
"I didn't.. sorry. You can sleep."
The waiter sets down two plates of tiramisu and the bill in front of them and Tony slides they bill towards himself. "So not to be presumptuous, but I thought this was pretty fun," he says, spearing the corner of his tiramisu with a fork.
Tony follows after him towards the door, stepping out into a crisp night. "So where am I going?" Tony asks, walking swiftly towards the parked car.
Of course not!
HYDRA didn't exist.
"It's been a long night," Steve concedes, taking a sip to have something to do while he tries to straighten his thoughts.
Luckily Tony just laughs instead of punching him in the face, silencing his racing heart. "Who knows, pretty boy." He takes another bite of cake, moaning in a way that sends Steve's mind right back to the image of Tony in his bed, this time under Steve, his head thrown back, a look of ecstasy on his beautiful face. Steve blinks and he's right back where he was, sitting across the table. "You gotta tell me though, which is your favorite."
Someone’s calling his name, though, but it sounds far away.
“Not my future,” he had told Schmidt. Looking down at the busted control console and the sunset ahead, Steve’s insides feel as though they’re beginning to freeze at the inevitable outcome that lies in front of him. He won’t
friend that doesn’t require a charging station - to believe his story about dreaming that Captain America was his
“Momma,” Anthony says with a gusty sigh at the sight of his mother. She gives him a bright smile in return, her lilypad green eyes warm; Howard gives the approximation of a smile, his eyes hard in comparison.
,” finishes Rhodey, with a smile.
A bright sunbeam shines in Commander Stark’s face, sending a flash of pain into his eyes.
“But not all Marks are gray,” Granny McDonald began again, in English this time. “They only go gray when a person’s soulmate dies. When both soulmates are alive, they come in all sorts of beautiful colors. That’s how soulmates find each other: the colors of their Mark will match the other’s. My Albert and I had green ones before he passed.” She touched the green band on her left wrist in quick acknowledgement.
“What else do you remember, Mr. Stark?” asks the doctor.
His parents make interested noises. Anthony hears his mother say “Oh really?” in a tone that’s...happy.
“Oh,” Steve said. He looked quickly to his Ma, who got that faraway look in her eyes she got whenever she thought about his Da. She brushed the black band she wore over her left wrist--over her
He looks up and twists his body toward the source of the noise. He finds Peggy Carter standing just within the periphery of his vision.
His heart sinks to know that he isn’t stuck with Bucky now. His heart feels heavy with an ache that makes him scratch at his chest. His head hurts something fierce with a pounding that feels like his head will burst, and there’s a pang in his chest that becomes too much and he’s struggling to breathe. His skin feels like a suit that’s two sizes too small, suffocating him and scratching at him. His wrist where his Mark should be begins to burn, and Steve claws at his soul band, expecting to find a swatch of color--
"How do you know that?" Bucky asks, his voice raw and a bittersweet smile on his face.
"Maybe I will Vanya." They both knew she wouldn’t be.
"Like I said, it's not really in you. Just part of it. There isn't enough to remove."
"Okay?" Tony bites at his lip. "You need anything, don't hesitate to ask."
Why wouldn't I?
"For one of you. For the other.." Tony blinks, understanding dawning on him. This was a mission of which only one of them would be returning from. It's ok, they'll figure it out. They always do. "In order to take the stone, you must loose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul for a soul."
Not to mention the long lost boyfriend that shows up only a day after that, brainwashed, and missing an arm but it's still Bucky. Tony helps them take down the helicarriers, whining the whole time about wasted brilliance, and—though he protests the idea adamantly—concedes to letting Steve face Bucky alone.
Tony can't help the surprised laugh. "You could just ask for a semi-public jealousy sex scene like a normal person, Rogers," he says, stretching his legs out and grinning at his absolute bastard of a boyfriend.
"No!" The scream is anguished like a knife through Tony's heart, but he closes his eyes , letting the tears fall as he hurls himself over the cliff towards the rocky bottom below. "Friday!"
"I mean you can call me Dr. Stark if it makes you feel better. I do have the PhDs to warrant it," Tony jokes, "but you're welcome. This... it is my favorite part of the job." Making people's lives better. That's what it's all about for Tony. It's not like he needs to do this. He could sell all his assets and still be able to live comfortably for another three thousand years. Even with his sizable donations to multiple charities yearly, he wouldn't have to work a day in his life. The thing is, that he wants to. He enjoys what he does, and this is why.
"Ok, we've definitely got some explaining to do," Steve says, offering Nat a hand. She takes it, pulling herself to her feet. She leans against him even once she's up, which is how Steve knows it's serious. Personal feelings aside, he had to make sure she was ok as soon as possible.
"I'm coming with you," Steve says, squeezing his fingers and feeling warmth in his chest at the smile that spreads across Tony's face.
"That's what Loki would—Natasha?" His eyes land on Nat and dart between Steve and her. "Are you okay?" He says, apparently aware of the fact that she is still on the ground, clutching her chest.
"Bye," he still says though, the phone clicking shortly after he turns to see Tony, nursing his whiskey and standing a few feet away, clearly trying not to eavesdrop. "I'm all done, if you're looking for a reason to come back over here."
"I mean I guess it makes sense. Stark has been rumored to be on the LGBT spectrum many many times over the last few decades."
"I can take a break for my favorite dad," Peter says simply , tapping Tony's hand with his pop tart. "Hey J can you cue it up?" Peter steps away to make popcorn and Tony relaxes, feeling the tension leave his body. Peter was a good kid.
Steve was used to this sort of rapid fire conversation by now, so he hardly batted an eye before pushing away from the table and coming around to meet up with Tony. "Why I thought you'd never ask dear." With Tony's hand in his, they glide slowly in circles around the dance floor, throwing Steve back to their first dance at Tony's birthday party. Tony had been quite drunk by then, and he had practically hung off Steve's neck as they swayed. Thankfully, this time they were both stone cold sober.
Her laugh is quiet like a secret that he longs to hear. "That's not the point, Steve. I know it's been 70 years, but you must understand that you have to fit in at these things."
"I have this—" he feels a jolt of electricity pass through his body, and sees Nat convulsing similarly out of the corner of his eye. God damn it.
Tony's eyes snap open and his body is solid again as he sits up, gasping for air through his tears. He looks down at Steve, who is smiling up at him, his lips parted. He looks different. Weaker. "Steve what—" Steve launches himself up at Tony, thinner arms wrapping around his shoulders.
Peggy nods once, looking a bit shell shocked. "I'm.. going to go clean up in the washroom."
"That's great, thank you," Nat says.
"Um." Yeah, that pretty much summed it up. Unfortunately for him, Steve seemed to be expecting something a little more substantial. "That happened, yes. I know you were like.. loopy, so, I'm willing to ignore it." Somehow that allowance felt like loosing Steve, when he had never even thought Steve was something he would want to have. Damnit.
"Um." Her eyebrows shoot up. "Oh. Sure go for it."
"I know." Steve interrupts him and Bucky disappears for a moment, returning after a short conversation.
"You know, I'm the best man, but I'm sure I could sneak away to sit with my beautiful date for a minute," Tony says, a very similar look on his face. He was beautiful, like he stepped right out of a painting. Maybe one day he would paint Tony. Hang it up for everyone to see.
Jarvis nods. "Very well. If there is anything you need, do not hesitate to ask. I must be off now."
"All yours, baby," Tony says. Truth be told, he had no idea how to write a statement like that. Most relationships he has had for the past few years were just long term one night stands, where they were his arm candy for a few weeks. The media always assumed they were dating, and that Tony was just a jackass playboy when he was next seen with someone else, but he always knew that those relationships wouldn't last. He hadn't officially announced a relationship with Sunset either, they had just dated for almost a year and that had been it. But Steve... Steve was different. "We'll do something."
Steve laughs, pulling Tony closer with that same arm. "I think I'll still keep giving you reasons, if that's alright with you."
"You're all I want." Steve reaches down between them to tug at Tony's belt, undoing the buckle with practiced ease.
"Not so much that it can't be taken care of, okay. Sam loves you. A lot, okay," Steve consoles, rubbing Bucky's back steadily. "Hey can you breathe with me? We're going to do five counts in, five out, okay." Bucky nods against his chest and Steve's begins to breathe in the aforementioned rhythm.
"Well," Iron Man says, after a pause. "Now I'm intrigued."
He shut his eyes, and the world went away again, but this time he was safe and warm, surrounded by Tony.
"Tony, it's not that," Steve said, weakly. "I promise it's not that."
Tony held up his hand, palm out, and Steve promptly closed his mouth.
didn't like
Ghost sighs. "You could have just said that."
Tony licks his lips again. "I could take care of that for you," Tony offers, slow and lazy. His eyes haven't moved above Steve's waist, and Steve enjoys the rush of it, seeing how much Tony clearly wants to get his mouth on him. Tony's too far under to be coy about it, and Steve likes that too. "You could come over here, put me wherever you want. Fuck my face. I know how much you like that."
He shouldn't. He didn't need one. For God's sake, he wasn't the one who'd just suffered massive cardiac problems. It would be selfish. And he was supposed to not be touching Tony. He wasn't going to think of it as something other than friendship -- he wasn't that far gone -- but even if it wasn't inappropriate, surely it would be easier to stop pining after Tony if he cut down even a little bit on touching him.
Steve's chest is a torn sheet of paper, suddenly crumpling into a ball. "Not
"Yeah," Steve slurs into Iron Man's thigh. His eyes are falling shut again. This is really nice. "You are."
he'd asked.
He needed to get over it. Tony was allowed to see his friends.
Steve's sure learning a lot about Iron Man.
"I know." Tony's smile in return is small, almost shy. It's intimate. True. Steve thinks that maybe now, after all this time, Tony believes him when he says he thinks the world of him. "But surely even you can admit I could stand to wipe my face off."
. Oh, there's nothing wrong with modern movies. He's enjoying modern movies. He just thinks that, when it comes to theaters, the future doesn't know what it's missing out on.
Less than a year ago, it was 1945 for Steve. He was in the middle of a war. And if there's one thing he's learned, it's that he shouldn't waste time. Life is fleeting. Happiness, more so.
Tony gently tugged one of Steve's fingers away and peered at him. "What?" he asked. His voice was kind. He'd always been kind. "What is it? It can't be that bad."
But then Tony pursed his lips in thought. He tilted his head to the side. He looked like he might, at least, be willing to consider it. "What's
"Yeah?" Tony asked, softly. "You like what you see?"
"I taste like blood and flowers," Tony says, frantically. "And you-- I-- I have a medical device, on my chest--"
Their disused comm line crackles to life in Steve's ear. "Cap, there's a kid here." Iron Man's voice is tense. "He's scared, but I've got him. This place is falling apart. Hang on, we're coming out."
In reply, Steve lifts Tony's hand, his grip loose enough that Tony could slip away if he wanted, and he presses Tony's fingers to his lips. His fingers are a little colder than they should be -- everyone's are, to Steve -- but Steve suspects that's leftover from the heart attack. Tony's fingers are softer than Steve was expecting; sure, there are scars, but Tony's skin is supple, lightly perfumed with lotion. He takes care of himself. He knows how to be both weapon and comfort. If he touched Steve, he'd be gentle.
"Can you walk?"
Tony was smiling again, just a little. "It was nice of you to try to stand up for me in that interview. I appreciate it. Though I have to say, I do know you wouldn't turn me in if I were a murderer. No matter what you said to the rest of the world. You really do want the best for me."
"That's different," Steve said, but he couldn't explain how. He wasn't good at this kind of reasoning. He wasn't Tony.
. Disgusting. Just like the old days." He wrinkled his nose. "So I decided it'd be a lot faster to wreck your life by fucking you again. And there is a certain thrill in, mmm, taking direct action. Knowing that I was finally winning and you didn't even know what I was doing to you. Knowing that you thought I actually wanted you. Even if that meant I had to put up with even more of your whining and your clueless fumbling. The sacrifices I make, Tony." He gave a theatrical sigh. "I wish I'd fucked her instead. I'm sure she'd have been better than you. It'd be difficult for anyone to be worse. Do you know, you're still the worst lay I've ever had? It's incredible how bad you are in bed. Honestly, I've always wondered how you got such a reputation. Who'd come back for more?"
he want?
. He's used to having
Tony's laugh was a snort of damp breath against Steve's throat. "Steve, it's not that easy. We run in the same circles. We're invited to all the same events. I'll absolutely have to see him again. Repeatedly. Unless he gets life in prison." His voice was cracking. "And he's not going to prison. At all. You know he's not. Nothing's going to stick. He was right about that too."
And that, of course, raised the question of why Tony hadn't just saved himself already and come home. Something else must have happened, and Steve had no clue what it could have been. He supposed he was about to find out.
Jan waves her free hand. "You should ask Tony," she says. The intimacy of the name is notable; she's the only one of them who knows Mr. Stark well enough to use it, the only one of them who would presume to call him
If Steve were being professional about this, he would have asked what Tony's physical capabilities were now. How he had been affected. What that port
"Is the mood any better now?" Steve asked, smiling, between one kiss and the next; he didn't want to stop kissing Tony for any reason whatsoever. "Little more up now, are we?" He shifted his leg, nudging Tony's cock slightly, so there would be no question about what he meant, as Tony breathed out soft and surprised and rubbed back against him.
But it wasn't going to happen. Steve knew that. Tony didn't like men. He'd never actually said so, specifically -- a fact that Steve's overactive imagination occasionally used as ammunition in some of his weaker moments -- but surely, if he had liked men, it would have been something he'd have told Steve at some point. Steve knew everything else about Tony. They were the best of friends. He'd known Tony for a decade. It would have been a hell of a secret for Tony to keep from him, and Tony had to know Steve would have been okay with it; Tony already knew Steve had had a whole lot of queer friends over the years. His tolerance, his acceptance -- none of that was a secret.
"Shellhead?" Steve wonders aloud. "Are you-- are you all right?"
"I know," Tony said. "I've got this." He stepped back, tested his swing again. "Okay. This is going to hurt."
"Hey," Steve called after Tony, as Tony grabbed his coat and briefcase and hurried to the hallway. "Let me know how you're doing later, okay?"
a few weeks ago and it wasn't-- it just wasn't what she really wanted. I wasn't what she really wanted. So we called it quits." His throat worked. "I'm probably too old-fashioned for you, aren't I?"
He is, however, unprepared. If he'd planned to do this, he would have had supplies. At least, a bottle of nice massage oil. Something scented. Or, hell, he'll take anything slick at this point; he knows his bare hands are too rough for this without it. And that's no fun for anyone. He bites his lip.
"I thought you were dead," Steve told Chen Lu.
"I don't honestly know everything that's in it anymore," he admitted, with a laugh. He definitely had not prepared this answer. "And even if I did know, I don't think Tony would want me to say so on national television. I have a feeling that some of the materials are proprietary." He took another breath and stared the camera down. "Every time I face off against a villain, every time someone raises a gun or aims a laser rifle or breathes acidic dragon breath, or whatever it is today, I'm trusting Tony to keep me alive. Sure, he keeps Iron Man armored. We all know that. But he keeps me armored, too." He could have brought up the shield that Tony had made him, once, but he knew better than to invite discussion about the Armor Wars. "So, yes. He may not fight with us."
"Please," Steve pleaded. He'd thrown his head back; his muscles were quivering, taut. "Please, Tony, it's so good, the plug's so heavy, it all hurts, I can't, I can't, please."
So Steve smiled gamely back and tried to be as fair and as honest as he could. "It's hard to say," Steve temporized, hoping he didn't sound too unkind. "I didn't get much of a chance to talk to him, after all. But he seems like... an interesting character."
"I'm sorry, I know you don't--" Steve stammered. "I'll, uh. I'll give you some privacy."
Tony's throat worked. "Yes," he said, his voice slow and halting. "But also no." He bit his lip. "You still have that place in Brooklyn, right?"
When they got to the hallway, Steve dropped back, but was still clinging to his hand. Tony glanced down. Neither of them moved.
"Not sure about food either," Tony said. "But I could stand to drink something, at least."
He knew it pretty well right now, actually. Christ, now which of them was comparing being queer to addiction, huh? That wasn't quite the same, though. Steve didn't regret being queer. He just regretted that he couldn't stop loving a man who he knew didn't want him.
He was dizzy, lightheaded. And then a tendril of fear snaked around and through him -- not regret, never regret, but anxiety. Nerves. Tony had been with a lot of people; everyone knew that. Steve had been with maybe half a dozen people in his entire life, and they'd all been women. He hadn't wanted to subject a man he didn't know to his inexperience. He'd figured no one could have wanted that; everyone else -- certainly everyone else his age -- knew what to do already, and no one was going to be eager to let him try everything out until he got the hang of it, until he figured out what other men liked best. And he'd wanted even less to subject Tony to his inexperience, Tony who could have had anyone at all if he'd held out his hand. Tony had obviously been with men before. If he'd wanted another one, he could have had someone
"I'm not going to hurt you." Steve's voice was soft, but fierce. "I'm not going to hurt you, and I'll say it as many times as you need to hear it." He felt Tony's breath hitch and catch. "I'm not perfect. I know I've made mistakes, and I'm sorry. I know I'll probably make more. I can't swear I'll never disagree with you about Avengers business." He wished he could say he had never hurt Tony. They both knew that wasn't true. "But I'm never,
It had been
"And I don't know the half of them, I know," Tony acknowledged. "But we did so many good things, too. Maybe that evens it out. Clean slate. A brand new day."
"Me," Tony declares, confidently, with a laugh of his own. "I'm definitely winning."
"I don't know," Steve returned, grinning, deliberately misinterpreting him a little, because he knew Tony was talking about his most recent revelation, "you're the fella who's been redesigning my uniform for years. You have all my measurements. How surprised can you be, really?"
The Bugle's website loaded, and then Steve saw the headline: TIBERIUS STONE ARRESTED FOR MURDER.
Oh, God, it hurt so much.
Steve almost asked
the consequences. Your friend here doesn't seem to appreciate the true power of magic. I think perhaps he needs to be taught a lesson. Wouldn't you agree?"
"You okay there?" Steve asks. He already knows the answer is no.
He breathes and breathes and goes under, down to the sweet place inside him where time has no meaning. He thinks, dimly, that he doesn't deserve this, but he doesn't care. He's nothing. He's gone.
Steve bites into the delectable cookie, savoring it as it crumbles into his mouth. "I'm cursed, Nat. Cursed I say." He had only ever had one successful relationship, and even Peggy had ended it with him in a matter of months. She was engaged now too, and he was happy for her, really. It just stung a little.
to protect my honor?
"Love," Tony mutters, muffled by his hand.
this uncharacteristic possessiveness, strange as that seemed to Tony, who had had people try to  possess him all his life.
Tony reaches over and pinches his arm through the suit. "I'm still your dad, kid."
The resounding slap to his face echoes and his eyes snap open, and he scrambles back, eyes darting between Steve and Natasha. "W—Captain America? Am I dead? Oh my god, I died."
Not a typical homophobic response, but not unheard of for a relatively nontoxic straight man.
"Go ahead," Tony says through a full mouth.
After semi-effectively composing himself, Steve grabs two of the cakes, carrying them out on either hand. "So all the cakes have a simple buttercream frosting. This one is lemon poppy seed, and this one in double dark chocolate," Steve says holding up each in turn as he comes around the counter, setting both samples on the table in front of Tony. "I just need to um.. lock up the doors if you don't mind."
"Any time." Both of their voices were velvety smooth, like dark chocolate. In another life, Stark would've made an amazing spy. "Capsicle. Get up to any grand adventures since last time we met?"
"3..2..1" Steve presses the button to send him hurtling through the timestream, finding himself in a hallway in Asgard with... no Nat. Oh no. She could... no, there wasn't anything that could keep her, she was time traveling. She had to be... lost? Dead? No. Then a flash of light and there she is, falling to her knees and gasping for air. Steve exhales, sinking down next to her. "Nat? Are you ok?"
"I can't tell you what to do Becca. Just be nice." Steve dismisses her by pulling Tony back into his arms. She remains only for a moment before disappearing off. Steve sighs, resting his forehead against Tony's. "I'm sorry if I have to go clean that up."
"You're fucking kidding," Tony says, looking over at him with a raised brow. His eyes flicker to Steve's arms, then back to the road. "What, are those fake."
"I love you." Tony's eyes open slowly to meet his, searching and soft. "So much. It's almost overwhelming. I love you, Tony." The words fall off his tongue easily, safe in the belief that he won't be rejected. He's fairly certain Tony shares the sentiment. After all, it's been months of time spent together in every way.
"Bubble tea," he answers seriously, closing one hand around Tony's wrist. Tony can't help but laugh, because really, what else was there to do.
Everyone else moved on, but he never could. Peggy moved on. Tony moved on. Bucky moved on. Steve was hanging onto the past, and even now that he was here he couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something.
Steve looks up in surprise. He hadn't really.... expected to get even this far. "Great... um. Great. Yeah."
"You aren't even looking at me." Tony kisses his nose, completely loosing track of what he was going to say next as soon as Steve opens his eyes, open and wanting and so so sweet. All for Tony. Steve's fingers trace possessively over the hickeys and bruises marring Tony's skin. "I have.. I have plans," Tony protests valiantly, his eyes slipping closed as he lets out a gasp at Steve's fingers so carefully pressing into his hips where he had had Tony pinned down last night.
Steve can see Loki standing and watching them, watching him especially, as they tear through their enemies like butter.
She doesn't even use the Mind stone. That's just straight up assassin training right there, and it scares the shit out of Steve.
"What did you do to her," he growls, pulling himself to sit with his back against the bars.
That surprised most people. They pegged him as the type who would have no trouble picking anyone up. Going off his looks alone, he could probably get half of New York home with him. And he was a pretty nice guy, with a stable career who was doing pretty well for himself. So Steve, why are you so incompetent with people? Great question thanks for asking. He liked to blame his asthma. When he was little, it was so bad that he was bedridden and scrawny, and nobody wanted to flirt with someone who couldn't even come to school half the time. Then he hit puberty and he got some experimental drugs that shot him up to being easily the most attractive person in the high school. Even then, he was struggling to keep up in school after so much time sick that he didn't have time to consider dating. When he finally got out of college, he realized that maybe he should've learned how to talk to people, after all he didn't want to be alone forever.
Steve snorts.
"I'm always cute Nat," he says, bumping her with his hip. His beard was shaven off and his hair was bleached and re dyed to blond, but still much longer then this Steve's hair. Other then that, they may as well be clones. The implications of that were scary for Steve, and he didn't really wasn't to think about it actually. He looks over at her with her loose hair and too thick tie and smiles. "Say hi to me for me."
Steve sighs. "I didn't anticipate another rider, so I only have one. I'll be fine, I promise." He pushes the helmet towards Tony with more force. "Just take it, please?" Must be his puppy dog eyes win Tony over because he takes it, despite appearing quite unhappy with the arrangement. He plops behind Steve, plastered firmly against his back, which Steve must say, he quite enjoys. "I'm gonna need you to give me directions," Steve says, running his thumb over one of the hands wrapped tightly around his waist.
Victor points at him. "Touché. I had the cake it's very good."
It doesn't take him too long to find Peter actually. He's in the middle of everything, screaming along to some late 2000's song Steve only vaguely recognizes. Victor is standing next to him, stuck between dancing and laughing, a look on his face that Steve wishes he could save forever. It's Victor who notices Steve, waving him over. "Hey Steve!"
When he wakes up, it's to a rapid tapping at the door. "Rogers!" Nat calls to him. Tony sits up first, prying himself away from Steve's chest and looking back at him. "Can I come in?"
"Thank you." He looks down at her, her eyelashes fluttering gently against rosy cheeks. "For everything, I mean." In another life, it could've been her. She might've never felt the same, but he could have fallen in love with her easily. He could still, with enough time. Loosing Tony was less raw now, but Steve loved him as much as he ever had. He never really had to stop loving Tony though, but he knew that if Tony were here, he would tell Steve to go for it, that he deserved to be happy. For all his bravado, Steve knew that deep down Tony just wanted everyone to be happy, and if that was with him or without him, so be it. He liked to pretend to be self centered, but Steve knew very well that it was all an act.
"Pepper said as much. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself."
"We've got this mostly wrapped up. Howard's using his pull to get rid of the newspaper article with us on it, so that's nothing to worry about. SHIELD is coming up with a story about how they found Bucky. There's no reason for us to stay," Steve adds. Besides it would be better to get out as soon as possible. They didn't want to accidentally let too much information from their time into this reality, so they had to leave quickly.
so I assume that you leaving your number means you want to see me again
"Steve—" Nat starts.
"Of course," Tony says with a smile. Steve steps over to the door, flipping the keys into his hand and locking the glass door. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad. Maybe he could just.. sell Tony a cake. It would be alright.
She pulls back away, setting a fleeting hand on Steve's arm. "It was wonderful, great beaches. Thanks for lending me your beach house."
"Oh. Well, my name is Maria Stark. I'm an artist. I was born to wealthy Italian immigrants who fled Italy after Mussolini was kicked out. My mom taught me to cook. We haven't spoken since I started dating Howard; I think she wanted me to marry an Italian." She strokes Tony's cheek with a finger. "Keep the bloodline pure or whatever."
"Sounds great," Steve smiles. They all end up in the kitchen, and it's true what they say about too many cooks. Eventually everybody gets their burgers and they all sit around on the floor in Tony's living room, the coffee table pushed to the side, eating and laughing. Tony is incredibly thankful that he's getting along with all of Steve's family as well as Steve got along with his.
"You're such a moron Rogers." She snakes her hand around his neck, pulling him down to press their lips together. He sets his hand on her lower back in a steadying motion even though he feels like he could fall over at any second too. She's warm, he realizes, but it might just be the feeling of overwhelming calm slipping over his body.
Tony smirks at him. "Just be glad I'm not in the mood for 3D models." Bucky lets out a choked off laugh. "Ok, come here." Bucky obliges, and Tony rolls the short sleeve of his shirt up to get a better look at his shoulder. He would've preferred the shirt left off, but he was trying for good impressions here. "You did some serious work here, pal. I don't think I ever got the full story." Tony looks up at him, a bit expectantly.
Steve laughs as soon as they're gone, and Natasha quickly follows suit. "From all Tony's stories, I woulda thought him a dead beat," Nat says, once she catches her breath.
Oh right. Tony was engaged. Steve snaps back away from him, his hands gripping into the counter farther away from Tony, near where he had made the frosting mere moments ago. "I'm so sorry, you need to go." If Steve couldn't control himself, then he would have to get Tony out of here as quickly as possible.
"Big order for someone like you," Tony says, pushing Steve backwards until his back hits the tiled wall next to the air dryers. "Sure you can handle it?" he asks, loosening Steve's tie, and dropping it on the floor by his expensive shoes. Steve breathes heavily, staring down at the tie, as if dazed. "I asked you a question." Tony undoes the first buttons on Steve's shirt, drawing his attention back.
He would do anything Tony asked. "Yeah. I um, took my friends van here though, and I think he'll kill me if I leave it here overnight."
"Y—yeah. Yes Mr. Stark. I'm on it sir." Peter swings always and Pepper lands in her Rescue suit.
Steve looks away, still frowning. He bites into his own spaghetti, not exactly sure what to say. What a day, what a day. Tony's gay, Steve's gay, woohoo. Parties all around. He looks back up at the TV to see a picture of him edited with hearts over his eyes accompanied with a tweet that just says "Captain America looking at his mans." Another flashes on the screen zoomed in to reveal part of Tony's reflection in the window behind him, the text saying "askshhsjshdh Tony was filming it! I'm" Then one that's just text, proclaiming "so is it safe to say i ship them yet?"
"Beautiful and explosive. Loud. Like the sun." He looks down at Tony.
"Bye, Tony, dear," Nat says, patting his hand with her own. He gives a little bow, then is off to some sort of business, whatever that means for him. "You're too stiff, darling." She takes a sip of her champagne. He follows suit.
Tony has half the mind to flip Bucky off, but instead he settles for resting his head on Steve's shoulder. "Next time, I'd recommend calling Tasha," Steve says quietly. Next time.
"Your kids in danger. We can make a plan." Steve sets a comforting hand on his shoulder, falling into the co-pilots seat next to him.
"You know, I'm pretty sure I've seen you on a magazine cover once?" Steve jokes, waving Sam and Bucky over.
Steve nods in eager affirmation, a bright red flush on his cheeks. Tony pushes through the door behind him, glancing around at the empty bathroom and locking the door. Tony leans onto Steve's shoulder to take his earlobe between gentle teeth. Steve gasps gently, gripping Tony's shoulders. "You know the safe words," he mutters, breathing hotly onto Steve's pretty neck.
Because every marvel fic needs a villain. There’s some more kinda serious homophobia in the next chapter, but only in the like, overt way that asshole family members do, and then they go “I’m not homophobic”
"She'll be fine. The question, is who are you?" Howard twirls on him, flipping up a pair of goggles. He was much less handsome then he had been, but he supposes that thats what happens with time.
"Fucking hell," Steve growls, taking off towards where he knew Bucky was holed up. "Becca!" He calls as soon as he can see her.
But... Bucky pulled him out. That was Bucky. He knows what he saw. If he had to do it all on his own, so be it.
Peter begins snoring about halfway through the movie, not that Tony can really blame him with how much he's been studying lately. He's pulled at least two all nighters in the past week to do homework. Worst part is, he wants to do it all himself, not that Tony could really help with English anyway.
He takes a step back and nods. "Anything for the mother of my son." He smiles at Steve. "Hey Steve, good to see you up. Nat asleep?"
She nods, but has a look on her face that makes it very clear that she doesn't understand what he means. Well, he wasn't a hundred percent sure either any more. It had only been a few days between her death and her resurrection, but it had felt like years. Thankfully it's that moment that Tony chooses to wake up, looking up at Steve with huge, inquisitive blue eyes. Then he begins to cry and Maria and Steve both seem to share the thought that Maria should have him.
As soon as he's gone, Tony slumps into Steve's arms, holding on for dear life. "Shh.. shh.. it's okay baby," Steve says, rubbing his back in soothing circles. "Come on, lemme take you up to your room." Tony nods, breathing in shakily. Steve leads him up the stairs to his room, pulling him onto a couch (apparently rich people have living rooms, and then more living room in their bedrooms? Don't ask Steve). "It's okay, baby. Peter's back. He's okay."
"I see." She tries to suppress a smile and makes not so subtle eye contact with Maria who giggles and shrugs. Now there was an interaction that Steve did not understand. He wasn't stupid, but he had unfortunately never really learned how to understand women. They usually just fell for his looks and his fame before getting to know him, which wasn't something he was really into. Well, it was fairly obvious that Steve didn't understand men either. He was—as the kids call it—a disaster bisexual. "So Steve, hows the future treating you? Has Howard made a flying car yet?"
"Ivan." The man has his hair slicked back with copious amounts of gel, and it doesn't help Steve's unease that he's wearing a loose coat. He could have any number if weapons under there. This could be a little HYDRA stick up.
"How?" Tony mutters into his skin.
Tony looks down at the ground, visibly deflating before Steve's eyes. Sure, the shirt was always big on him, but he had never seen Tony look small. "I think you should just cancel the party," he says quietly.
"These stones are incredible. I've only seen these kinds of readings twice. So tell me. Where the hell did you get these?" Howard's voice rings out, inquisitive and hardly hostile in comparison to the steel bars around him.
"Absolutely," Steve says, setting a hand on Nat's lower back.
"Tony." Tony shuts him up with a cold set look staring down at the tablet. Steve sinks into his bed, squeezing his eyes shut. "It wasn't him," Steve says quietly, cursing himself for the tears prickling at his eyes.
"I sent her to my quarters with Lady Natasha." She fixes Natasha with an unimpressed look at that, but Thor pays it no heed, instead nodding and running off, presumably to find Jane. "I was supposed to die then, wasn't I," Frigga says as soon as Thor is gone. Her words hold no emotion and she holds herself regally, but Steve thinks he sees a flicker of pain pass her face.
"Tony, this is serious," Bucky says, setting his right hand on Tony's ankle.
Tony snorts. "Obviously. They're not rumors, by the way. I've confirmed it more than once. The media just likes to talk."
Tony pauses, flicking his wrist to free his hand up to play gently with the ridges of his armor. "That really depends upon what you remember."
"I can't get drunk."
So sorry about the wait! In order to make up for it, I’ll be posting a couple of shorter fics that take place in the months between Stevetonys first date and Sambuckys wedding. They should be coming out pretty quickly, so stay tuned 💕💕💕
"I don't care if you have a crush on me I—"
Nat rolls her eyes. "I mean she's back here. She really wants to talk to Bucky."
Tony crosses his arms looking down at the snowy rocks underneath them. Well, in al reality that probably wasn't snow, but it was close enough given that he didn't have time to do a full scientific evaluation of the planet. Steve's boots crunch on a bit of loose gravel and Tony exhales loudly. "Can you be more quiet."
Clint pretends to gag and Steve scoffs, but he follows up by lifting Tony clean up off the couch, supporting his full weight as Tony readjusts his legs around Steve's waist. "You're lucky I have super strength," Steve absconds, walking towards the elevator that would take them up to their shared floor.
Steve finishes frosting the cupcakes, a deep purple color in curling petal designs, and sets them in a box, a content smile on his face. He had his friends, and soon he would be seeing Tony again, even if that held equal parts guilt and excitement.
In a moment of what feels suspiciously like the onslaught of a panic attack, he pops the trash can lid open and dumps the cake, slamming the lid back down. It rings through the room and Tony's eyes close, his chest heavy with difficult breaths. "Tony?" A quiet voice calls out from down the hall.
Steve drives to the expensive ballroom anyways, careful with the precious cargo in the back of the borrowed Honda. He, after all, was expected to deliver it, and he wasn't going to back out now, even if he wanted to. He pulls around back, 30 minutes before the reception was to start. The window rolls down as a man approaches holding a clipboard. "What do you have?" He asks.
A sad look takes over her face, which is the exact opposite of what he had been aiming to produce. "I know." There was no point in asking. It wasn't his place, and he didn't even belong here. Soon enough, she could reunite with a Steve who could stay. Who would stay. Who hadn't been through the past 12 years of shit. Who will be reunited with Bucky shortly after emerging from the ice. Who would have a better life. Steve feels his chest tightening with the onset of what was sure to make him look like a lunatic. A panic attack. Because not even Steve Rogers could deal with his problems in a healthy way. No, because his mistakes would always crush down on him. He feels Nat tapping on his arm: Breathe.
"And I'm in a committed relationship. I just would like to clear something up from your perspective." Now, Steve didn't know exactly what angle Tony was getting at, but he knew for a fact that Rebecca would leave them alone if Tony got his way. Tony was, after all, very smart.
"Everybody is fully clothed," Tony says with a roll of his eyes that makes Steve smile. At least he was feeling a little better. Steve sits up too, sliding back against the headboard and pillows, letting Tony run the show. "What do you need Pete."
Steve laughs, pulling back. "I might know a guy." Sam is almost in tears, and that's how Steve knows they're getting old. "Damnit, now I owe Nat 20 dollars."
Steve finally comes to a halt a few feet away from the object of his more guilty dreams over the past week and the object of his apparently unwarranted self loathing. "This isn't your wedding."
"It's on the Love, Simon soundtrack," Peter says, like it's very obvious.
Steve holds up the hammer, and without a second thought, sends a bolt of vibrant lightning straight into his chest. "It's not for you, cocksucker." His voice is monotonous, as if he's reading an excerpt from a particularly boring news article.
"Ok." Whatever. He wasn't going to argue that point with his dying teammate. In fact, honestly, anything that got Steve thinking, talking, would be better than just letting him slip in and out of awareness. "Tell me about it." At least this would distract Steve from his pain.
“I know Steve, you were a great match.”
That sounds great Tasha. “ Steve sniffed.
“hmm how about we play with the dildo, huh?”  he grinned teasingly at Tony. The genius returned the grin with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
“Listen, I can do damage control. Steve makes Tony happy, like truly happy. They’ve been in a commited relationship for three months now. Surely, the press would be delighted to know Tony Stark has finally settled down, and even supports a minority”Pepper said, and Tony was so glad to have pepper on his side.
“Yes.” Tony breathed back, actual tears in his eyes now. “fuck yes, I want to be yours.”

“I'm fine. A bit bruised and worse for wear, pretty sure my nose's broken, but I’m fine. What happened to ghosting me?” Tony’s voice sounded.
“colour?” he asked softly , although there was no one to hear him but Steve.
Rest your head close to my heart
‘Yes I did! I was in college when I made the first one.’
Steve grinned and reduced the vibrations to the lowest setting, soon he got a video call through snapchat, he chuckled as he accepted it.
“So you...?”
“Steve, honey. I know. Just show me.”He said tenderly. Steve fished his phone from the pocket of his jeans and unlocked it. Heading to Facebook and poking around for a minute before handing Tony the phone.
“Why don’t you go relax for a bit, sweetheart? You’ve been through a lot.”
‘Hmmhmm so good, unless you prefer naughty boys, of course. I could be your little heathen.’ A picture of lips drawn between teeth, a hand under the chin. Steve could see some of the view over the shoulder of the man, who seemed dressed in a suit.
‘Those are amazing honey, did you make these yourself?’
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
Oh fuck yes.
“Pep got this. Let’s go unpack.” Tony grinned, pulling Steve towards his private elevator and heading up to the penthouse. There were already a few boxes put down there and Steve grabbed one.

“Sure, tones.” Steve smiled, and let Tony lead him wherever he wanted them to go.
Steve couldn’t help but smile, and he went to save his best friends from the jovial model.
What to expect?
‘I know you are.’
Fuck, how could this have happened? How did he manage to text the wrong person and not realise? Was the real Jeffrey still waiting for his text?
“Sensitive.” Tony managed to bring out, the fingers tormenting his nipples paused.
“I’ll look into trains.”
"You know what I want to do to that pretty mouth of yours?"He asked, his breath ghosting Tony's ear. Steve chuckled as he felt Tony shudder.
“If you’re good, you have nothing to fear. After all, we're not animals, you know?”
‘Fuck… You’ve got nipple piercings?
Pulling his shirt over his head to throw it in the hamper, he decided to draw himself a bath to relax further. He sighed as he let himself sink into the water.

“Feeling good, sugar?” Steve asked.
“Devo venire, per favore fatemi venire.” Tony begged. He was pulling his hair, panting and keening. Steve stroked Tony’s cock. Once, twice.
“Tell me about it.” Tony snorted, but Steve could hear he was crying.
“i don’t know if I’ll ever be ready for this.” Steve admitted.
“What if they don’t buck? What if it’s already too late?”
“Hello babydoll.” Steve smiled, pecking Tony’s lips.
“So, what do you want to do now?” Tony blushed. “we still have two hours before we need to be at the restaurant.”
“i’m from Brooklyn. “
“Oh I could make you come just like this, but that would be cruel, wouldn’t it?” Tony tutted.
“made you talk Italian.” Steve said.

Soon, he was fingerfucking Tony with three fingers. The Brunet's voice was hoarse from screaming his pleasure, but still whining when Steve pulled his hand back.
Please Tony, darling. Wherever you are, be okay.
“I don’t want to be alone. Just let me paint., I need distraction. “  Steve murmured.
Steve sighed and gave in.
Tony kicked at some pebbles.
“You told me you love me yesterday.” he said in awe, as if he'd only just realised it.
“Not weird, I think it’s beautiful and a great idea.” Steve said. “Let’s do that, Tony. Once all my stuff is put away, let’s go see our parents.”
“I don’t know yet, they’re tending to him on the way here. I just know they’re bringing him back in, the man had built a location signaller from some scraps. He’s a genius. There were bruises according to Rhodey, he seems shaken, but not severely hurt.”
"Oh." Tony sighed contently, nosing Steve's cock before lightly starting to suck on it.
“Billionaire and technical genius Tony Stark has gone missing. During one of the showcases of his latest model, the lights went out and people heard a fight. When the lights went back on , Stark was gone and a letter of ransom was found. There have been no indications as to where Stark was taken.”
“Yes, of course, please.” Steve breathed, and apparently that was all Tony needed to come closer and smash their lips together. His hands roaming through Steve’s hair, tugging it lightly and making Steve gasp. Tony used Steve’s mouth opening to skilfully slip his tongue inside. Steve moaned against Tony’s lips and his hands grabbed Tony’s hips and just lifted the tiny brunette to get him closer. Tony gasped.
He returned home in high spirits, excited for the snapchat date. He had dinner in a rush, longing to hear his brunet again.
“Maybe, yeah.”
They were going to live together.
“oh Tony.” He moaned as white splattered his hand and chest.
“Wait, that was Tony stark?” Bucky’s jaw dropped.
“Bye for now.”
“I mean, if you feel ready about it? I would kind of like coming home to you.” Tony said softly, heart clenching and wishing for Steve to say yes, because now that the idea was in his mind it wouldn’t leave. Oh please let Steve move in, yes yes yes yes.
“We’re here sir.” Happy informed them not much later . Tony broke the kiss and looked around. They were indeed at the tower, parked in the underground garage.
“A heli, that’s big.” He said, Steve nodded. Then his phone pinged.
For now find the art here
I look forward to read your thoughts!
“fuckfuckfuckfuck STEEEEEEEEEEVE.”the brunet screamed through his orgasm. Steve could feel his own approaching like a train and twisted his nipples.
“I had, until she passed away seven years ago.” Steve said, and he could see the guilt on Tony’s face.
“I hope so , Tasha. I don’t know if I could handle it if they don’t. “ he whispered.
Tony watched in satisfaction as Steve’s lips opened to let a pant eescape. He asked about the colour again (green, as expected). Then he ripped the shirt Steve was wearing, and eagerly pulled down his own pants as well as Steve’s, before yanking of his sweater and resuming his position on Steve’s hips.
“What Tony means to say is that his amorous relationships are his business...”she started.
He hurried towards the elevator when he saw Steve’s bike turning the corner of the street, ready to meet him down in the underground garage.
Tony nodded, a plan already forming in his head.
Tony positively beamed at that, planting a sloppy kiss on Steve’s mouth.  Before stretching out and leaving the bed, giving Steve a welcome view of his naked body.
“Steve, they’re going to find out.” Tony panted.”why did you follow me?”
“Smartypants.”
“Okay, sweetheart?” Steve asked, afraid he’d crossed a line. Tony had given him some sort of consent, but consent would always be key. He waited, not doing anything more until he got the okay from his lover.
“I sure hope you like the surprise.” Tony mused. “I’ve been looking forward to using it all week.”
Keep an eye out for bonus chapters in the future!!
Steve felt  Bucky pulling him into an embrace.
“You, Steve, my bed. You can fill in the rest.” Tony said, waving his hand.
“Tony... I think I might be in love with you.” Steve confessed softly.  For a brief moment, shock settled on Tony’s face, and Steve was afraid he’d messed up. He was about to apologise when Tony put on an unreadable expression.
“Now give me a show, sweetheart.”
He looked up when there was a ping on his phone. A picture of Tony’s ass that made Steve surge with want and mine mine mine.
“Yeah? Gonna beg? Need to come that bad?” Steve asked.
Steve thought for a few minutes and then came up with a solution.
“....”
He gave Tony a sweet kiss on his temple and ruffled his hair affectionately, and that made Tony smile again. The brunet kissed the blond on the mouth this time.
Steve’s jaw dropped, and he scrambled to find his phone. He had to hear from Tony, he would be okay, right ?
“It’s Tony Stark, he’ll find someone better.”
And welcome to the bonus chapters.
“I’m afraid I’ve got nothing. I only just saw the news.”
Steve smiled and passed his address, before focussing on the conversation with his friends. Tomorrow he would go and see the man that held his heart.
“You... You want me to move in? Do you want us to live together, sweetheart?”Steve asked cautiously, and now Tony’s eyes widened too.
“So, now we're working from the boyfriend’s lap?” she asked him with a smile.
“Now, I believe you were told to make me come.” He had barely spoken the words before he was flat on his back, Steve’s bulk weighing them down.
“i see ...” happy said, deciding to not question his boss when he looked so happy. He beat a strategic retreat.
https://twitter.com/eriotafterdark/status/1384890374326521859?s=20
“I can’t wait to take you home, sugar.” He smiled between kisses.
“Yeah, just...That was... Sexy.”
Tony looked straight into the camera.
“Tony!” Steve smiled brightly as he finally, FINALLY got his first real life look at the man who had driven him crazy all those times.
“Someone’s gonna miss me, I take it?”
“I’m afraid not, Steve. I’ll let you know if there’s more info.” The woman said, before the click told Steve that the call had been ended.  Steve threaded his hands through his hair and rubbed his face.
Steve fidgeted
The end
Steve pulled back and Tony stuck out his tongue to show he had swallowed everything, Steve dove in and kissed him sloppily.
Soon, they were seated into the car , Tony resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Believe me when I say I’m just as desperate to bring Tony home as you are. What do they want for ransom?”
“I’m glad you enjoyed yourself, Sam. Why don’t we grab lunch together so we can catch up?”
Next up was the yellow ice cream (bananas) and the green (pistachio), they also had plain vanilla and stratiatella. Steve grinned when he discovered the rum and raisin one, that had been his mother’s favorite and reminded him of his childhood, he told Tony this.
“green. So green.” Steve hurried to assure him, and so Tony went to town, lifting himself up and down and rocking his hips to give them both pleasure.
“Why don’t you go home and rest for a bit, Stevie? “ Bucky said. “ Tasha will drop  you off so you can  sleep for a bit.”
“Woah there.” The brunet chuckled. “little excited, aren’t we?”
‘i’m sure you'll think of something for me to do.’
Steve dove for his phone when it started to ring with Tony’s number.
“Did you think of him when you fucked me?”
“Tony?” Steve was suddenly much closer, his face inches from Tony’s, a warm hand on his cheek.
“Car should be ready in five, and then we’ll go for that date.” Tony kissed Steve again because now he could, he finally could, and then dragged him along to the elevator to get down to the underground garage.
“Honey, can I?” he asked.
What followed was the most mind blowing orgasm Tony ever had (and that said a lot, since Steve managed to fuck Tony’s brains out every single time), and he was glad for the soundproof walls and floor of the penthouse, because he’d defenitly screamed while his eyes rolled back into his head and white splattered his stomach.
https://twitter.com/eriotafterdark/status/1384890374326521859?s=20
Tony cracked a smile:“Thank you.”
“maybe I could go with you?” Steve proposed, not wanting to miss out on spending time with Tony now that he was here. Sure, he would move in in a month or two, but quality time with his boyfriend was ever the priority.
He held out the spoon to Tony, who licked the ice off.
Steve spent the next hours restlessly thumbing the pages of a book, thinking of Tony, and then his phone rang. It was a millisecond before Steve picked up.
'Steve? Please... Don’t be embarrassed. It’s okay '
“My little heathen.” Steve said fondly, kissing Tony again as his orgasm took over and he filled Tony with a big, creamy load. Tony moaned and rolled his hips as he was being filled.
“Tony’s super secret project.”
“Now, what can I do to help you relax?” he asked, and tony flushed.
“Need to come, please please please.”Steve begged.
“These are my toys, anything you want to see me play with?” he showed the box to Steve, and Steve’s eye Immediately fell on a big dildo. He felt guilty for the surge of arousal, but he knew Tony wanted to get his mind off of things and so he let himself slip into that familiar headspace.
Keep an eye out for bonus chapters in the future!
“You gonna come for me? Make a mess of that pool you’re being naughty in?”
‘Look at what you made me do.’
“You’re so sexy, Steve, I just want to eat you up.” Tony growled and nipped at Steve’s hip. Instinctively, Steve’s hips bucked. Tony just tsk’ed and continued kissing and licking Steve’s abs, feeling the blond squirming under him.
'can I call you? Kind of want to hear you'
“Hey, you think we can visit our parents graves together one day? I think I would like introducing you to my mama. Is that weird?” Tony asked softly. Steve shook his head.
“Steve, please, I’m ready for you.” Tony pleaded, and Steve grabbed a condom from his bag.
How did he come across the famous Tony stark?
“Steve, you’ve seen me naked, of course kissing is allowed, but eh, maybe we should be careful just in case y’know… Papperazzi is everywhere.” Tony swallowed and Steve felt a pang of guilt.
A ping made him smile, so, his sexting buddy was out of the sauna, then. He opened the message and smiled at the video of the bots playing with a tennis ball. Whirring and zooming around .
“Still fighting I see. “
“Yes and no.” He kept vague on purpose, and got an annoyed huff from Steve in response.
“I know.”  Tony smiled.

Lunch had lengthened into watching football, which had led to pizza night on the couch, and Steve woke in the best of spirits when his alarm rang. He gathered the last of his stuff and went to the spot the Heli would pick him up.
It was all going to be over for Tiberius now.
But he'd barely seen Tony at all, this week. So it wasn't as if Tony had had the opportunity to really see firsthand that Steve was still going to be Tony's friend no matter what Tony's orientation was. And Tony had spent the whole week being gaslit by a sociopathic murderer. So it wasn't really a surprise that Tony was still afraid, even if there wasn't anything for him to be afraid of. Right now, he was probably going to assume the worst of people. Even Steve. It wasn't something Steve should take personally.
That was encouraging, all right.
Tony tucked his face against Steve's neck -- he really liked doing that, didn't he? -- and Steve stroked his back until his breathing evened out. Steve thought maybe it was that Tony could feel a little safer, a little more composed, if he knew no one could see his face, even if it was just Steve. When Tony wasn't being Iron Man, he lived most of his life in the spotlight, and that had to take a hell of a toll on him. Steve could appreciate that sometimes Tony just didn't want to be seen, literally. It was probably a big part of why he liked being Iron Man so much.
"But Maurice is so happy anyway," Steve said. "He's in love with a guy, and he thinks he's got it made. He thinks this is as good as it gets. He doesn't think Clive's an asshole, because Clive loves him. Clive's cruel, but Maurice puts up with it. And then after they graduate, Clive breaks up with him. He says he's straight. He's marrying a woman. And Maurice, he's despondent. Miserable. He goes to doctors. Wants to be cured of being gay. They can't, of course. So he's just miserable. Suicidal, even."
"Him?" Tony snorts. "What do you think? He took a long vacation and decided to hire a bodyguard when he got home. Coincidentally, he met a very nice guy named Iron Man who happened to be looking for a job."
Brian had died in a car crash in '53, while Steve had been in the ice; Roger was still alive, and he was very much out now, and anyway it was legal now, in the military, in the UK. Since last year. Steve had checked. Roger was still the Destroyer, even. He was still the Destroyer and he was still very, very gay. The Invaders had been Anglo-American, mostly -- plus Atlantean -- and Brian and Roger had been two of the Brits. And they'd been a couple. It had been a secret back then. But it was okay to talk about it now. It had to be.
No. No, no, no, no. This isn't happening. Tony can't do this.
Tony did none of those things. His face went noticeably paler, pupils constricted again, and he tensed up, spending all the dregs of his exhausted energy, languid limbs now coiling into a fight-or-flight readiness, as if his body was determined to undo every last iota of happiness that Steve had tried to give him.
Tony's smile is starting to fade, like he thinks once again that this answer is going to disappoint Steve. Okay, sure, it's not what Steve wanted to hear, no. But it's Steve's job right now to handle Tony's feelings, and if he has to stretch the truth, so be it.
Oh, good, an answer he'd actually practiced. "They'd be exactly the same thoughts." His voice was crisp. "Since I was only made aware of Whiplash's death after the fact, I'm unable to provide that level of real-time evidence, but Iron Man has assured me that he was not responsible for Whiplash's murder. As has Tony. I believe both of them. Wholeheartedly."
Getting himself on one of Tiberius Stone's channels turned out to be surprisingly easy. All Steve had to do was call. One of the producers of a show called 20 Vision assured him that they'd be happy to have Captain America make an appearance, and was Monday too soon?
Then several things happened in quick succession, so fast that Tony's mind gave up on making sense of them after the first one.
"When people like us come out, it's headline news," Tony said, and, yeah, of course, he was thinking about the media. "It's public. It's something the whole world considers their business. Everyone knows. Everyone has an opinion. People you've never met know the intimate details of your life. And that's what it means to come out when you're famous."
him. Who wanted
Dear God. Steve just stared at Tony, incredulous. How had it been this bad? How had so many people Tony had loved hurt him so much? Why did this keep happening to him?
They made it across the floor, seemingly unobserved, and reached the tangled pile of light-up animals. Steve spun, putting his back up against the light-studded wires, and he raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to the side. His mouth moved in a silent question:
"I don't think
Tony smirked. "Well, it is
Steve pulls back to look at him. "Tony?"
"No, that's all right," Steve said, because of course it was. "That's fine by me. Of course you don't have to do a single thing you don't want to."
Tony snorted. "Steve," he said, his mouth twisting into a lopsided smile, "I think you're going to be real disappointed when you find out the answer to that one."
He gets one knee on the bed, leans in, and then cups the back of Tony's head and pulls him forward. Tony is still mostly sideways but he's pushing himself forward with his bound arms to get closer, trying to raise his head. Steve helps him, holds him steady, holds him up. It's not a comfortable position, long-term, but Steve already knows it's going to be over fast. He's always fast when Tony gets his mouth on him, and he's been waiting for this all night.
Tony was silent for several long seconds. He wasn't asleep; his eyes were still open. Then he focused on Steve, and once again there was sadness in his gaze. "You know what the worst part of this whole thing is?" He laughed. "I mean, it really shouldn't be the worst part, but you know what keeps getting stuck in my head?"
"If someone is asking you not to trust your own perceptions, that counts as hurting you," Steve added, because it sure seemed like Tony didn't register that as pain. "I don't mean just having a different opinion about something. I mean someone saying that what you know happened wasn't the real story, making you believe something was your fault when you know it wasn't." He tried to think of another way to put it. "You're smart, Tony. You're smarter than me, and you're incredibly perceptive, so much so that we all rely on you in battle, on your understanding of the facts. As an Avenger you're asked to look at problems, size them up fast, find the answers, and be right. I'm asking you to trust yourself the same way you'd trust a calculation for repulsor energy output versus Kang. Because if someone's asking you not to believe what your own mind tells you is reality, they probably don't have your best interests at heart."
It had probably gotten worse.
polite." At least he looked like he was in a better mood than he had been before, as he took the plate. "Thank you, Tony."
"That's a good name," Iron Man says, cheerfully. "That's my-- I mean, I have a friend whose middle name is Edward. That was pretty scary, huh, Eddie?"
Ghost slams the device down on the back of his neck, and it's like a lightning strike. Steve hears himself screaming. His muscles go limp. He can't quite move. Even the slightest twitch of his wrist is agony.
He licks his lips, another reflex. He accidentally pokes his tongue with the edge of one of his fangs. He hates this.
"Again, an honor," Tiberius said, and then he checked his watch, in a manner that Steve was sure was meant to impress them with whatever watch he was wearing. His watch was heavy, gold, probably expensive. Tony probably knew exactly what kind it was. That was the sort of thing Tony would know. "You'll have to forgive me; I'll talk to you later. Two minutes until showtime, I'm afraid."
He'd waited, glumly, for Tony to say Strength, because of course he was going to say Strength, because that was all anyone ever saw in Steve now. The muscle. That was all he was good for.
That's not the case for Tony. Tony's sex life is, unfortunately, perpetual gossip fodder. People ask him.
Curious, Tony tilted his head to the side. "I think that's my line, Winghead."
Yeah. Steve knows. He knows what Tony is trying to tell him.
Tony raised his head just far enough that Steve could see his eyes, too pale, his face dotted with broken capillaries. Oh, geez. He was a mess, wasn't he? But he seemed to want to be Steve's mess, and Steve was more than happy to take him. He'd always been. If Tony was only offering friendship, he'd take that. The idea was getting easier to accept.
That sounds better than
Tony thinks:
It sure looked like that was never going to happen.
." He slides his hand up Iron Man's arm appreciatively. His fingertips bump the edge of the chestplate, when he gets to Iron Man's shoulder.
Vibranium rang out, and, thank God, that was Steve swinging the shield directly at Flag Smasher's head, knocking him out cold. Hopefully this time he was going to stay that way.
Tony was happy. That was good. It was. Steve should just leave him alone. Tony was fine. Tony didn't need him. Steve could eat breakfast some other time.
Another light burned out, overhead.
A little bolder now, Steve stroked him again. There wasn't anything to be nervous about, he realized. He had this. He wasn't going to mess this up. Even if he wasn't going to be the best Tony ever had -- well, not yet, at least -- he still got to be with Tony. For real. And definitely more than just once.
"I'm starting a fashion trend," Steve said, deadpan, and Tony chuckled. At least he was trying. It would be okay. They'd be inside soon, and then Tony could finally let go. "Come on. This way."
would, no. But Tiberius almost certainly had. And right now, that was the only experience that Tony could judge any of this by.
"Look," Tony continued, a little quieter. "I don't expect you to understand what I feel for him. I don't even expect you to like him, though it would have been nice if you had." Tony met his eyes, stared him down like they were ten minutes out from the end of the world and Tony had the solution that would save everyone, if Steve only trusted him. "I'm not asking for that. But I am asking you to believe me when I say this. He's not hurting me. I'd know, okay? I'd know."
He's learned a lot. He's never going to underestimate Tony again. And soon SHIELD will get here, and after that their night will be theirs again.
"What about the possibility that the records were falsified?"
Oh, God. That definitely wasn't going to take long at all, now.
in school. I thought it was okay. Never read anything else by him. And I'd bet Ty hasn't read it either, for what it's worth. I don't think he even bothered reading that one for school; he probably bullshitted his way through the essay. His taste in pleasure reading is... fairly narrow. If it's not by or about an Ancient Roman emperor, he's not interested. And he's definitely still like that." Tony was looking interested, though. Intrigued. "Not a genre I'd have expected from
a robot. Steve knows that. Some people these days have some funny ideas about what it must mean for Steve to be from 1945, like he's not as smart as anyone else is, but Steve knows there's a man under the armor. He can tell the difference. It's the first thing he remembers seeing, really
"But nothing," Steve says, with a determined glint in his eye that Tony suspects he'll be seeing a lot of. "Do you need me to kiss you right now to prove it?"
?" His mouth twitched. "None of that makes me weak. Feelings don't make me weak.
He traces his fingers as lightly as he can over the places where he
. He wants to be with Iron Man for as long as Iron Man will possibly have him. He wants this every day for as long as he lives. He knows Iron Man often feels down like this, often gets into glum moods, but Steve wants to be here when he does, right here at Iron Man's side, even for the bad times. He wants to lift him up again, if he can.
He thought they were okay. Better than okay. For God's sake, he's been planning to
"And now you know."
And then the credits come up and he has to choke back delighted laughter. It's
The drive skitters and slides across the floor, and the pressure on Steve's back moves higher. Steve bets that's Ghost shifting his weight to try to grab the drive.
With his whole heart, Steve believes him. But that's not a conversation to have with Ghost in the room. He'll have to demonstrate his feelings some other way.
"I've got his number, if that's what you mean," Carol said. Her gaze was distant. "Henry and Tony and I, we're usually at the same meetings. Tony hasn't-- he hasn't been to one recently. And I've been... worried. And I know Tony's probably not someone you want to talk about now, if you're leaving because of him, but--"
"Mmm," Steve said. "I know you will never, ever believe this because it's coming from me specifically" -- Tony raised an eyebrow -- "but you have
. "You're welcome to read some more of the book if you'd like to confirm it."
This was not a question Steve could ever answer honestly if he wanted to continue to be Tony's friend, and he definitely wasn't about to try to bluff his way through it while standing in his living room at three in the morning, holding a shivering Tony in his arms. This was too much. But he couldn't bring himself to lie, either.
Tony wanted to be here, Steve told himself. This was, in fact, exactly the place he had picked. Tony wasn't going to mind how it looked.
Steve smiled. "Maybe next time, then," he said, and God, Tony could hardly believe that Steve already wanted there to be a next time.
Tony had that armor-summoning watch these days, after all; if something went really wrong, he could call the armor.
"Uh," he said, with another laugh. "Tony, I'm-- I'm not straight. Not at all. It, um. It definitely isn't pity. That's definitely not what I feel for you."
"Probably tibia," Steve agreed. It was still a little hard to think, but it was getting better. "Maybe fibula. Can't ever tell with that one."
The metal wrapped around Tony's chest is a thin, delicate sheet, covering him from the bottom of his ribcage to the top of his breastbone. The scarring starts at Tony's hips, where the armor's crimson-metal groin plates still sit. Coarse, ridged lines travel up to disappear under the chestplate; on the other side of them, the scarring continues in silvery knots up to his collarbone. Asymmetrically, on his other side, a jagged line cuts up and over his other shoulder, almost to his back.
Tony waggled his eyebrows. "
Steve has long since learned to recognize the distinctively heavy, clanking sounds of Iron Man's footsteps in the hallway; no one else sounds like they're wearing an entire suit of armor, after all.
"Was she the reason you started drinking again?" He hadn't known. He'd never asked. He'd just assumed. "I thought you were drinking because of your company, because Stane was plotting corporate takeover."
"Oh," Tony breathes, entranced, and Steve leans up and kisses him, as Tony relaxes into his embrace.
Steve swallowed hard. "I didn't know who Iron Man dated, so I thought I had a shot. But I know who Tony Stark's dated. You date rich people. Glamorous people. Sophisticated people. You take them to-- to Monaco, or the French Riviera, or, heck, probably your own private island." He wasn't meeting Tony's eyes. "I can't compete with that. I'm just an old fogey who thinks two tickets to a Rodgers and Hammerstein revival sounds like a good time."
Tony's heart lifts, but-- "I don't want your pity. It doesn't
"Don't worry," Steve adds. "I'm not getting you any of the underwear with cartoon superheroes." Or, sadly, the lace.
Steve closes his eyes in bliss and pushes everything else in his life away.
you--"
to touch him.
Smiling, Steve looked over at him.
Metal scraped and crunched. The armor made a terrible groaning noise, and then somehow Steve was balancing half a twisted chestplate in one hand. It had flexed up and bent backwards as Steve had literally peeled it off him at the shoulders. The golden mesh on Tony's arms sagged and depolarized.
Steve sits down on the edge of the bed. His head is in his hands. Tony wants to sit next to him. Tony wants to put his arm around him. But Steve doesn't know him. And if Steve remembered him, he sure as hell wouldn't want him to anymore.
Ah. That's what's going on. Steve's the hostage. And Ghost has demands.
"If Ty will go to prison for it," Tony said, fervently, "I will absolutely unmask and testify." He paused again. "You're not telling me this just to make me feel better, right? You actually think he'll go down for it?"
all week, and that was far worse than just one of them. He'd known what they'd felt for each other. He'd been the only one who'd known.
The smallest of smiles flickered onto Tony's face. "All right."
"Oh," Steve said, numbly. That made more sense.
"Not really," Tony said. "Plus, Ty doesn't have any involvement in the news programming. He doesn't tell his people what to report. He stays out of the process. That's what he told me."
"So who's Baron Mordo?" Tigra asked.
, he told himself, sternly.
"Yeah, that," Steve said. He could feel himself smile in reminiscence; Tony looked at him like he was insane. "You remember you told me how you liked to give people attributes?"
"Do I really have to spell it out?" Tony's mouth twists. "Fine. I guess I do. I asked you out. You turned me down, in favor of... a person you thought wasn't me. And now the person you thought you were in love with is, in reality, someone you've already rejected. I already know what you think of me. And I know you've been upset with me. I'm not blind. I know when I'm not wanted. Why do you think you've barely seen me around, out of the armor?" He's biting his lip again. "But I knew I had to confess when I found out about your... intentions. I wasn't about to let you make that mistake. I'm not
Steve can feel himself smiling wider. "Got it," he acknowledges. "Thanks for letting me know."
"Is this about the structural integrity? Because we've been given the all-clear on that, and besides, everyone else in the building right now can fly." He thumped his own chest, lightly, for emphasis. "We're actually safer than a construction crew. If you fall, I promise I'll catch you."
They fell silent. Turning away, Tony took another sip of his tea. Steve studied Tony's shadowed profile, still streaked with the traces of tears, and then Tony bit his lip and looked back at Steve.
He didn't know how to say exactly what he did want; the words were all too awkward, too crude.
That's their safeword, his and Tony's.
It doesn't actually matter if Ghost gets out of here. It matters if the
was, but somehow he knew Tony would know.
Steve's uniform shifts, warps, changes into shimmering gold. A Phoenix Host. He's emblazoned in shining flames, crimson and gold. There's a bird insignia on his chest and another one on his cowl, in the middle of his forehead, where the A usually is. Objectively, he should look ridiculous.
, he thought, and it seemed right, in this bright and wondrous moment, to think of Tony as his, because Tony had claimed him too, had said that Steve had taught him strength.
Did Tony really think Steve was going to be upset with him about that? Did he really think that was why Steve had brought it up? Tony surely had to know that Steve wanted him no matter how many people he'd been with. Steve knew exactly who he'd taken to bed. He had only been talking about his own inexperience.
one?"
Tony was nodding even more, animated. "Yeah, I know. I didn't think he was physically capable of sleeping past six in the morning, either." His gaze was fond, and he squeezed Steve's hand. He leaned forward, body language tuned to a conversation he wasn't even having in person. "I know we're already late, but honestly I just woke up. Haven't even had breakfast yet, so if it's not anything urgent--" He paused. Jan was clearly talking. "Yeah, yeah, that was exactly what I meant." He nodded again. "Really? That'd be great. Thanks. See you soon."
Relief flashes through Mr. Stark's eyes -- but then he frowns, clearly confused. "Then what's the problem?"
; you couldn't make it through the first floor of the mansion without finding pieces of Tony's collection of early aviation memorabilia or even one of Steve's own drawings. This place looked like a staged set, a room that gave nothing about its owner away except for his wealth. Steve distrusted it.
He said it like it was a joke, but of course, it really wasn't.
Of course he was worried. God. They all were. Tony stepped inside and shut the door behind himself.
But, Steve realizes in a sudden flash of inspiration, it doesn't have to be one or the other. Tony likes to be touched, and hugs are too little but sex is too much. But those aren't the only two options. There's a whole spectrum of possibilities. There are a lot of ways to touch someone.
Steve's taken a lot of bullets in the line of duty. When it happens, there's almost always a bizarre moment of incongruity in the seconds after the gunshot echoes fade, when he looks down at himself and watches blood oozing from the wound, soaking his uniform. There's a terrible sense of wrongness, even stronger than the pain, sometimes: this doesn't belong here. This isn't a thing that's supposed to happen. His body shouldn't do this.
And then Thor stood up, the way he always did, clearing his throat like he was preparing to give a soliloquy. There was a box at his feet, heavy but battered, still closed, but one corner had cracked just enough to let something slip out.
Tony blinked. "Showtime?"
The funny thing is, whenever people have asked Steve what he misses about the past, he's been tempted to answer
"I really like what I get," Steve says. Iron Man makes a soft, unreadable clicking noise. "I really do." He pauses. "Maybe you'd let me take you to a ball game, sometime."
Heart attacks, he'd said. Plural. That meant more than one.
Eddie's smiling now. "Thank you, Iron Man."
Half an hour later, the last of the agents finally leaves, and it's just the two of them. Steve trots across the room, picks up his shield, and slides it onto his back. He's got his shield. And he's got Tony. Everything he needs, really.
Tony gave Steve a thumbs-up. "With you all the way, Winghead."
, he says without words.
he had a broken hand. Boxer's fracture, Hank McCoy had called it, as he'd realigned the bones -- unfortunately without local anesthetic, because Steve was just that goddamn special -- and taped his fingers to each other before putting him in the splint.
Having frozen briefly as the shield flew past him, Ghost starts moving again; the shield sails back across the room, far above Steve's head. Ghost's featureless face is tipped upward as he watches it go.
If Iron Man can't take the armor off, then anyone who sees him so much as shirtless in his civilian identity will instantly know his secret one. Steve supposes Iron Man must wear some awfully baggy clothing. But, knowing how concerned Iron Man is about his secret identity, Steve can imagine that Iron Man doesn't want to risk exposure -- even if, for the sake of Iron Man's health, Steve wishes he would.
Wildly, Tony flailed out a hand, reaching for him. His depth perception was off; Steve wasn't quite close enough to where Tony's hand was.
"No," Tony admitted. "I didn't want you to, exactly. But then I'd have known you were really into it, you know?"
"You liked that too, huh, Shellhead?"
The first couple times, he'd taken care of himself before Steve had come over at all, but they'd quickly figured out that this way was much more fun.
"--Cap?" Jan asked, and Steve belatedly realized she'd been talking. He had absolutely no idea what she'd been saying.
But Iron Man lays a hand on his arm. "No, let me," he says, insistent. "I'm fireproof. And I'm faster."
She fluttered upwards as Tony picked up his helmet and tucked it under his arm with a clang of metal against metal.
"Yeah," Steve said, grimly. "I've got this."
But Tony just smiled. "Thanks. Maybe I'll give it a try, since you think so highly of it." He paused. "It did seem like I was reading it."
Steve's mouth was half-open. Tony always enjoyed being able to surprise him. It happened so rarely. "I-- you-- how did you--"
Steve raises an eyebrow. "You think I'm going to object?"
"This is because of Tony, isn't it?"
"Yes?"
was also just right. Tony had him. Tony wasn't going to let him come to harm.
Then Steve looks back over at Stephen and nods. "I'm ready now."
Tony's lips tasted like the salt of his tears. His kiss was awkward, clumsy, desperate, deep, like he'd wanted this kiss since they'd met, like he had years of pent-up feeling that he needed to show Steve in only a span of seconds. Steve didn't need to wonder if Tony loved him, when he'd fallen for him, how long he'd loved him. Tony's body was answering every question. Tony clutched Steve tight, dragging them together like he needed all of Steve touching all of him right now, like Steve alone could pull him back from a cliff's edge.
"You're going to be the death of me," Iron Man says. The words are gentle, now, and Steve can tell he's smiling too, a broad grin in the shadows. "Close your eyes?"
This was different. He didn't need to say it. They both knew.
He finds the shears exactly where he thought they'd be. Tony tenses a little when Steve slides them against his skin, under the edge of one of the ropes of the harness.
Iron Man looks up at Steve. Behind the mask, he's smiling too. He's practically
In most situations, Tony was quite capable of taking care of himself.
It's a kind offer. Steve smiles. "That's good to know."
In what Steve has come to recognize as the equivalent of a rueful smile, Iron Man tilts his head. "I'm not saying this because I want you to feel sorry for me," he adds. "I just wanted to explain the situation. It is what it is. I'm alive. I'm grateful."
Tony started to smile even wider, almost dreamily, and then he cut himself off, glancing away. A mask. Tony hadn't done that to him in a while. Maybe years. "I'm doing all right," he said. The words were flat.
"Yeah?" Tony asked. "You going to treat me right?" His smile was wider.
"Oh?"
"But I trust him with my life."
"But you wanted to know what I want," he said. "Not what I don't want."
"I'm sure," Tony says. "Like I said, I can handle him."
"You have to know how that sounds," Tony pointed out. "You know how crazy that sounds, don't you?"
And then, all at once, he can see his assailant; Ghost has gone visible. Ghost is holding him, almost bending him backwards. One of Ghost's feet is braced in front of his. His white-clad arm is pressed into Steve's throat. Steve can't see much more than that. It's getting harder to see.
"You," Tony declares, "have excellent taste for an all-powerful cosmic force."
"Those are the main power packs," Tony says, cheerfully. "Don't worry, there's a secondary battery in the chestplate itself. Other one now."
Tony tried to swallow. His throat locked up. It didn't help. "Yeah," he said. "It's really me." His face was all pins and needles. His mouth was raw. "Good surprise? Bad surprise?"
It occurs to Steve then that maybe Iron Man doesn't feel the same way. He'd like to think that Iron Man does, of course, but it's not like he's ever said it, either.
"One second," Steve calls back. "Just getting you something."
was a hell of a question, though. Honestly, Steve couldn't put a date on it. It wasn't as if there'd been a day he didn't love Tony and then a day he did. It didn't work like that. His life had had a rather astonishing number of definite beginnings in it, but that hadn't been one of them.
He slid his hand a little farther down, covering the buckle of the belt now, the way Steve had. His fingers smoothed over the metal of the buckle, the leather of the strap, so close to where Steve desperately needed his hand to be.
Steve has one hand -- the gloved one -- across the small of Tony's back, holding him tight. His bare hand runs through Tony's hair, over the nape of his neck, across his cheekbones, like he can't seem to pick a spot and settle. Tony gasps in surprise when Steve's hand brushes his skin, because Steve is
. "Probably a bit much for tonight, though."
"No," Steve echoed, hollowly. "I suppose you really couldn't ask for anything more." He tried to smile. "Just take care of yourself, okay, Shellhead?"
The familiar sleek shape of Stark Tower is ahead of them, and Tony starts sinking, clearly heading for the front door. Steve doesn't know if that means Ghost is still close to the ground floor -- he'd only just entered the building, invisible, a blur of movement through a window and then a ripple of distorted light on the security cameras -- or whether it just means that Tony isn't thinking clearly enough to head in through the penthouse the way he ordinarily does.
Tony's lips were parted in amazement. "Wow," Tony said, softly. "I-- wow. No one's ever-- I-- I think I'm going to need a minute."
Jan lets him go, then, but when he's in the doorway she calls out. "Steve?"
Tony laughed softly. "You sure know how to flatter a guy, huh?" he murmured, low in Steve's ear, like he was sharing a wonderful secret. "Just look at you. Beautiful." His other hand was still stroking Steve's inner thigh, a little higher up now. He was Steve's anchor.
He hated telling Tony no. And it was only one night. Maybe Tiberius Stone would be nice. Tony certainly seemed to like him a lot. Tony did generally have good taste in friends; Steve got along well enough with Happy and Pepper and Jim. And even if Tiberius turned out to be someone Steve couldn't warm up to, the worst Steve would have to do was make polite small talk for the span of an evening. He'd certainly done more difficult things in his life. It wasn't as if Tony was asking him to invade Normandy again.
Oh God oh God oh God. It's worse than he thought. It's so much worse.
"Steve?" Tony croaked. "What-- why-- how-- what are you doing here?" His voice was slurred. He barely sounded like himself.
He hates to rush Tony. Especially about this. There's not really a choice, though. "I can feel the serum fighting it," he admits. "Half an hour, tops, is my guess. It's, uh. It's now or never, I think."
"Yeah," Steve said, despondent, desperate. "Yeah, I actually am going to tell you it's different. I know I've hurt you. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry, with all of my heart, that I've ever,
"What happened?" Steve asks. "Did I fall and hit my head? Something like that?"
"That's the spirit!" Jan told him, grinning.
"So I can't tell you I'd never do that," Steve said, his voice rough with pain, "because you can't believe me."
Hearing Iron Man say his name like that, low and somehow tender even with the way the armor distorts his voice, makes Steve shiver.
Steve runs his fingers through Tony's hair. "It's been a while since anyone held you, huh?"
Walders' smile curved, dangerous and sharp, and Steve hadn't the faintest idea what he'd said that she thought he'd caught him out on, until she spoke. "First-name basis, hmm?"
. I think he must have told me that. It sounds like something he might have told me. But I don't think that was what really happened." Tony was clear, self-possessed. He sounded like he was giving testimony. Witness for the prosecution. "
Time to pack the box back up. Then he could attempt to get some sleep and not think about any of this ever again.
"So," Tony said, with an expression that was probably supposed to be a smile, in a tone of voice that was clearly trying for
He took a deep breath and pushed all the fear away. He was on a mission now. He had to stay calm. He couldn't let himself worry about Tony's condition right now. He'd do what had to be done. He had to believe that Tony was alive. He had to keep believing that. He'd start by paying Tiberius a visit. Chances were good that Tony was still there, after all, and unconscious -- because if Tiberius had taken Tony elsewhere and had known enough to divest Tony of Iron Man's identicard first, that was a very bad sign. Tiberius had already shown that he was willing to murder Iron Man. So Steve was just going to assume that that hadn't happened yet.
"God," Tony says again. "I just. Wow. Jesus. I need a second." He rubs his hand over his face.
"Hard as you can give it to me," Steve said, and Tony knew that when Steve said that he actually meant it. "I want to be able to feel it later. No one else ever does that for me, but you know what I can take. I know you know."
"Oh, that's lovely," she cooed. "Reminds you of the two of us when we were young, doesn't it, dear?" She nudged her husband.
Steve nodded. "It has a happy ending. For sure." And then he paused, trying to bring the rest of the plot to mind. And then he remembered the rest of the plot, and he covered his face with his free hand to muffle his laughter. "Oh, God. This is embarrassing."
Tony flailed out a hand and brushed Steve's arm. Steve grabbed his hand back like he was hanging on for dear life.
"You really don't need to do this for me."
It's not like Steve knows Mr. Stark that well, after all.
"It's Captain America," Steve calls back.
"You are officially my favorite person I've ever dated," Tony murmured. He was enraptured now, lost in imagination, already planning it out. "Oh, we get to make you a
If Steve had hackles, they'd be up, and he doesn't want to think that, but it's true. He hasn't seen Mr. Stark all that much since he and Iron Man started dating, and he doesn't know if Mr. Stark is purposefully going out of his way to avoid him -- which takes a lot of work, since they live in the same house -- but the last time he saw him was that disastrous conversation several weeks ago in which Mr. Stark suggested that Steve and Iron Man shouldn't be dating.
"Not really," Tony said, still stunned, apparently having taken Steve's question as an actual question rather than a flippant remark. "You're only the second man who's ever kissed me."
He'd never thought it would really happen, of course. Which was how he'd ended up here, with zero experience with men and with Tony in his bed.
Steve suspected that it was going to be a long, long time before Tony was happy again.
This was definitely worse than Steve had imagined.
And, yeah, when he looked up, Carol was grinning. "Come on, Cap!" she said. "Is that really
"Best two out of three?" Carol offered.
Some of the tangled ball of shame in Steve's gut starts to work free; Tony's always been good at doing. Steve still feels terrible about the fight -- and he's definitely not thinking about that right now -- but it's nice to know that Tony's not going to disapprove if Steve gets turned on giving him a massage. Steve doesn't think this is the way that usually works in this situation, but right now he's just glad. And about half-hard. Yeah, that too.
Iron Man's eyes sparkle behind the mask, and Steve imagines that, underneath it, Iron Man is smiling. "Nope," he says, cheerfully. "It's a mystery."
Tony laughs, and Steve can feel it when he does. Tony shudders once more underneath him. "I spend most of the day either at a desk, staring at a screen, or wearing a full suit of armor. I think both of those are probably bad for my neck in different ways, and they don't cancel each other out."
Tony was safe. Safe for good. He could finally relax.
Tiberius gestured at the raised stage at the other end of the room. The curtains had been closed since Steve and Tony had arrived, and Steve had assumed it was a feature of the room that wasn't going to be in use tonight. But now that he was taking a closer look, he could see that the main curtain rippled and bumped; there were people moving around back there.
potential. She didn't have super-strength, but she could be dating someone who did, or keeping the chains around in case the situation arose. He didn't know Monica that well, and so all she would know of him was by reputation. That seemed to him like a decent situation for a long-distance crush; it wasn't like Tony was unaware that a lot of people liked his public persona. He was good at being charming. It was possible.
do this. He wasn't going to do this.
"I hate the thought of you dying of hypothermia much more than I hate the cold," Steve tells him. "Also, you know, holding you in my arms is definitely not a hardship."
"I trust you," Tony repeated. "You feel safe." He sounded like he might start crying again. "You're the only thing that does. Nothing else feels
"That's SHIELD," Steve added, helpfully. "You know, the people who get involved when you go after superheroes. Like us. And you can't buy them off."
In the quiet, he hears Tony's breath catch. Tony's brow furrows, and Steve knows that Tony still doesn't want to tell him no. About anything.
Tony has filled in his own name and birthdate and has moved on to filling in
She did have a point. Maybe she'd learned that in one of those meetings. Maybe that was something her sponsor had told her.
On the other side of the door, the music decreases in volume.
It was a joke, of course, because they both knew -- some of them with less amnesia than others -- that Steve did what was right and not necessarily what was legal. And here was further proof.
"You're a superhero," Tiberius said, even more desperate now. His gaze slid over to Steve. "You're both superheroes. That's what you do. You help people. You save people."
"You seem to be confused," Tony said, dry-voiced, "about who superheroes save. It's not the villains. Them, we turn over to the proper authorities. We make sure justice is done. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. So I'm not going to kill you, and that's the only mercy you're ever going to get from me. It's a hell of a lot more than you ever gave your victims." Tony stared down at him, implacable. "When the cops show up, I'm going to tell them every goddamn crime you've ever committed, and I'm going to hope to God one of them sticks."
Steve was more than fine with that.
Something about the way Tony was looking at him now was too intense, too urgent. Something Tony was going to tell him wasn't what Steve was expecting. Somehow it was worse. He didn't know how it could ever have been worse than that. He set his glass down without breaking eye contact. He was beginning to feel like this was something he should have been sitting down for.
That was when Steve triggered the faceplate release.
Jan had taken it upon herself to show Steve how to use a computer, that first week; Mr. Stark had unexpectedly come in halfway through the lesson, and Steve had tried not to be distracted by the presence of his extremely handsome landlord. He saw Mr. Stark so rarely that every time Steve was tongue-tied and nearly struck dumb once again by his matinee-idol looks. But this was an important lesson, something he was going to need to know about the future, and he wasn't going to let his attention wander.
was anything but.
He hated to let Tony out of his sight, but it would only be for a minute, he told himself, as he turned to head to the other room.
want to work. Because I can't imagine seeing the world the way it is and not wanting to do everything I can to help people."
Tony trusts him enough to let him do this, Steve reminds himself, as a memory of the fight with Ghost floats to the surface of Steve's mind, and he shoves it back. Tony's not thinking anything bad. Steve shouldn't be either.
"Did he hurt you?" Tony's voice is a whole lot rougher. He cares. Of course he does.
Ghost grunts in surprise and pain and his hands open involuntarily as his arms take the blow. The drive arcs out of his grasp; at the speed it's moving, it's easily free of the last of the cords, tumbling toward the floor.
But then Tony pets Steve's arm again, very softly, just above where he's buckled down. Not quite at his bare hand. His touch is so, so gentle. Steve sometimes thinks he doesn't deserve Tony.
So he got his keys out, unlocked the door himself, slowly eased the door open, stepped in, and just as slowly closed the door behind himself, as close to silent as he could be. He didn't want to make noise. He didn't want to draw anyone's attention.
At Iron Man's
" Tony yells, hoarse with fear. He's on external speakers now. A small part of Steve is grateful that he doesn't have a secret identity anymore, because Tony's clearly not in any condition to keep secrets.
That was the first piece of information that Tony found he was having a feeling about, and that feeling was: confusion. They should have done his left arm, shouldn't they? It was as if they'd found out he was left-handed, somehow, and they'd wanted to leave his good arm free when he woke up. Strange. Considerate, sure, but definitely strange.
. And, sure, he may be with Iron Man, but he's only human, and Mr. Stark is attractive. It's not as if Steve's going to do anything about it. He's taken, but that doesn't mean he's blind.
With his other friends, the friendship had been gradual. Even the friends who'd been his partners. He'd always liked Sam, and they'd always worked well together, but it taken them a bit of time to go from acquaintances to friends. The part where he hadn't been in his own body when they'd met had probably been a bit of a setback. Sam was in his pictures, of course, but gradually: a few at the beginning, and then a little more frequently. They'd had to work up to friendship, he supposed. They hadn't started with the blurry Polaroid of him and Sam and Josh Cooper, arms tipsily around each other's shoulders, laughing, a pitcher of sangria on the table in front of them. And that was fine. That was normal. That was how friendship worked. That was how it was supposed to work.
And that was very, very bad.
"Take as long as you need." Steve's stomach was twisted up with nerves. He didn't know what Tony's answer would be. But he'd waited this many years, not knowing. He could wait a little longer.
Well, someone had definitely trained him to do
Steve heard the other end of the line start to ring, and Tony stood up and started to pace across the kitchen, gesturing as he talked.
"You're so hot," he says, which is not the most brilliant observation he's ever made, but it's difficult to focus on anything that's not Steve's cock, pressed against his thigh, as Steve keeps pushing against him with little twitches of his hips. Tony suspects Steve is also not focusing on anything that's not Steve's cock, either. That's also hot. Different kind of hot.
He takes a deep breath and lays his hands on the middle of Tony's back. His hands are damp with oil, leaving slick trails shining on Tony's skin, practically glowing golden in the dim light. He spreads his fingers out, gently rubbing the oil into Tony's skin, letting it bead on old scars, sink into the pressure marks of armor plates against Tony's ribs. Unlike Steve, Tony wears his whole damn life on his body.
." Steve articulated the word with obvious reluctance. "I top from the bottom. That's what they say. And they're not wrong. I'm very particular about what I like. I have to be, or it doesn't work for me. And most doms, you can imagine, don't like me coming in and telling them what to do to me."
He sits down at his desk, takes a few fortifying breaths, and then nudges his computer awake. The internet has rings. The internet will either sell him rings or know where he can buy them. The internet cannot possibly fail him this time.
It was going to be okay. It
isn't supposed to get anyone this worked-up.
in if I were a murderer. It'd be the right thing to do." Why was Tony trying to deny this? He knew who Steve was. He knew what Steve would do.
Steve was touching his arm. Probably. Tony couldn't really see that far anymore. "It's not going to change how I feel," Steve said, his voice full of fierce confidence, and Tony breathed out hard at the reassurance he hadn't even known he needed, and then he couldn't quite catch his breath again. "You're still you, and I'm still going to love you. No matter what."
Steve grinned at him. "Then I'm looking forward to discovering more of your talents, and also a voltage reading on that circuit."
"And I'm still not," Steve returns, evenly.
It's definitely not a great joke, but Mr. Stark still grins back at him. He's got a lovely smile.
"I care about you more than anyone else in the whole damn world. You're still my friend. And you're not going to lose me. No matter who you love. I'm still in your corner, okay?"
Steve's heart sank. Tony didn't get it, not in the slightest. Tony thought Steve was doing all this because
Steve closes the window of search results before his resolve fails him in a different way and he can succumb to the temptation of the link labeled
Steve's never seen Iron Man's hands before; he's never seen any part of him out of the armor. Iron Man's skin is olive-toned, but under the shade of his complexion he's too pale; he's clearly not all right. Iron Man flexes his wrist, back and forth. His palm is covered with a patchwork of thin scars. Some are old. Others are newer. After a second or two, he slides his bare hand to the cuff of the other gauntlet, flips whatever hidden switch it has, and the other gauntlet likewise retracts as the process repeats.
"Neither are you," Steve returned.
"Mmm," Tony breathed. "I'd be very happy to see anything you wanted to show me." From someone else, the words might have been a coarse suggestion; from Tony, they were achingly sincere.
Tony was still silent, wide-eyed, listening to Tiberius' mad ranting.
Shit. And that right there,
"Yeah," Steve said, fervently. "Yeah, I do." He smiled. "It's a lot more than just wanting, actually." He wanted it to be clear that he wasn't looking for a one-night stand here. "Though, uh," he added, his voice gone a little unsteady, "there's definitely a whole lot of wanting going on. In the interest of full disclosure."
"I'm happy," Tony said, his voice low and intense. "I'm happy now. I can't-- I can't promise that I'll always be." His voice was tinged with regret. "I wish I could. But I'm going to try as hard as I can to hold onto it. To hold onto you."
Steve just kept smiling. "I don't think I've ever met the richest man in America before, either," he replied.
"I'll be very careful," Steve promises, and then his arms settle around Tony, his mouth meets Tony's, and the awful weight in Tony's chest starts to lift. It's not gone, not yet, but it's going, it's going, and he's going to live through this after all.
"You've injured me!" Tiberius blustered. "Why, I'll--"
"Yeah," Carol called back to Tony, "he's definitely fine."
"Oh, Tony, you're wonderful," Steve breathed. "Your hands, your mouth, Tony, you're perfect."
Steve pocketed his keys, flipped the light switch on, and shut the door behind Tony. Tony was shivering, and Steve was positive it wasn't entirely the cold. But they were inside, so it was all right now, surely. Tony could let himself feel whatever he needed to feel.
Tony's mouth tilted, half a smile; he'd been caught out. "You're sitting here with two broken bones, Winghead. I figured it'd be more than a little cruel to tell you that I was, uh, pretty much on cloud nine."
, Steve had promised himself. Well, he's not going to get a better chance than this.
Boy, had he ever done that.
A cloud of dejection passed over Tony's face. It had been two weeks since Rumiko. They had been off-and-on for a while, and they were definitely off right now. Tony seemed to be taking this latest breakup particularly hard, and Steve thought maybe this time it was going to be permanent.
