Dean started to pull out so he could finish himself off but Castiel pulled him flush against his body making him grunt. “Inside me.” Castiel managed to pant out.
Inside was bright lights and people pushing and shoving their way to items they had no need for. "Sam you get toothbrushes, deodorant and hair products me 'n Cas are getting him clothes, meet back here in half an hour. Got it?"
He pulled Dean into a tight hug, their chests pressed up against eachother. "Was that a yes?" He mumbled in his ear.
Uhm well this is my first time writing explicit gay porn, hope you enjoyed. I had a bit of a writers block with this story, I get it with most stories that's why I never finish, but I powered through for you guys :)
Without thinking Dean closed the gap between them and Cas let out an “Mmph.” As Dean ravaged his mouth, in turn Castiel recuperated eagerly.
"Yeah he's uh, he's just a quiet guy, say do you think that those guys would show up around now?" Just as Dean had said that an angry looking man in a black biker jacket burst through the door followed by three more bearded angry men in biker boots.
Dean straddled Castiel again, their cock’s rubbing together, he took Castiel’s arms and pinned them above his head as he kissed him passionately. They were both new at this and both trying to hold as much of each other as they can. The friction of their dicks felt heavenly but Dean and Cas both wanted more.
About twenty minutes of going through flannel Castiel had picked out: two red ones, a black one, a blue one and four black shirts.
Dean didn't put up much of a fight and stopped the car. He slid out of the drivers seat and into the back with Cas.
"When angels die they do not go to heaven or hell because we don't have souls, we go to a place called the empty, a place of complete darkness and silence, locked in an eternal sleep. Somehow I was awoken and the entity that lived there wanted me gone, so here I am."
They picked up coffee on the way to school, Castiel’s order was simple, he liked black coffee with a little bit of sugar, Hannah’s regular was a latte with foam and of course Gabriel, with his insatiable sweet tooth ordered the caramel latte with extra caramel. They had ordered it so often that every day without fail the barista already had their orders ready by the time they got there.
Castiel gulped, he knew Dean was just joking around but he couldn’t help the fluttering feeling in his stomach, he smiled and quickly turned back to the board to where Mr. McLeod was droning on about some big important test coming up but he couldn’t concentrate because he could still feel the phantom touch of Dean’s hand on his shoulder.
"Y-you know t-this Dean." Castiel could barely form a sentence and this was only the beginning. But he had obeyed Dean's instruction and kept his hands above his head, although it was getting increasingly hard.
Dean opened his eyes to see darkness, he felt cold hard concrete against his back. Ok so he was in a room somewhere. His eyes were adjusting to the dark and he could make out shapes, boxes? Then he looked to his side to see Castiel, he looked very unconscious. "Cas!" He whispered harshly, nothing.
“Awh you’re no fun.” Dean frowned playfully and then looked to Cas again with a boyish smile. “We’re friends right Cas?”
Sam hears his brother's cry of pain just after he kills the second Wendigo, there was a total of four.
Mary and John had brought a house in the countryside and were as happy as ever, they were visited by their sons regularly.
"Maybe you should call your boyfriend, he can provide you with full certainty, considering that you don't even trust me to go outside by myself." That sounded better in his head but oh well, going with it anyway.
He tested the waters by inserting one finger and Castiel let out a loud moan. Pumping in and out of his writhing angel, he added another and another until Castiel was ready.
. He thought to himself. He didn’t need Dean to say it back because Castiel had said enough for the both of them, this was where his story ended, where it was always going to end, all he felt was relief as he was enveloped by darkness.
If they weren't fighting right now they'd be fucking because the sexual tension was enough to melt Dean's inhibitions.
"You are." He agreed but then he swiftly pulled Dean back to his mouth before he could say anything.
Dean tells him he wished they had never kissed in a last attempt to save their friendship, ultimately making it worse and Castiel storms off to sulk.
He reached a hand in-between them to stroke Castiel’s flushed, pre-cum covered cock and Cas moaned loudly, he thrust faster and faster holding off his orgasm so that Cas could come first.
“Fuck Cas, need you so badly.” He kissed Castiel’s neck and sucked on a point just below his ear which made Cas gasp loudly. Then he started trailing kisses down his chest, he even took a nipple in his mouth and bit down lightly, now that really made Cas moan.
Cas’ legs were wrapped around dean’s waist pulling him closer with each thrust, one hand was gripping the bedsheets and the other in Dean’s hair.
The truth was Dean was hurt, he felt rejected. But that didn't matter for now because Castiel was here, was human.
"When the Empty came for Jack it was incessant on claiming him. There was no way out...and I did what I had to do as Jack's protector."
Dean hadn't forgotten about the kiss, hell it was all he could think about. But he knew in that moment his friend needed comfort, so he pushed his self hatred aside.
Castiel cradled Dean's face in his lap. "No vital organs have been punctured but you will bleed out if we don't get you to a hospital." Dean didn't respond, he was out cold. Castiel didn't have enough grace to heal him, he had used most of it fighting off the monsters, it always replenished but slower each time.
The next morning he woke up and Castiel was there by his side, they immediately got to work on some slow, passionate morning sex.
Castiel made a happy noise and buried his face in Dean's shoulder. "I love you." He mumbled against Dean's skin, this was a happy moment, one that Dean would remember forever.
"Sleep." Dean pulled Castiel by his tie flush on top of him and the angel let out a small oof. Dean just grinned cupping Castiel's face with his hand, drawing his thumb over his soft, chapped pink lips. "I missed you so damn much." Castiel closed his eyes at the intimate contact, this affection was never shown by Dean.
"God I miss you so much." He quickly turned around in his lovers arms but Castiel wasn't there. "Cas!?" Dean started to panic, usually in his dreams Castiel would always be with him, he could always see him. "Dammit. Fucking dammit." He swore.
Dean needed to get Cas alone so he grabbed the angel's hand and marched him to his bedroom. "Dean what are you-" Dean cut him off with a stern look. "You know what this is Cas, it's been a long time coming." He says hurriedly pushing the timid angel into his room and shutting the door. "Take off the damn trenchcoat." He ordered and Castiel obeyed.
"I'm his brother, how did you come to find this mess?" Sam chuckles, the guy seems nice enough and he is happy for Dean but sad for Cas, if Dean had slept with this guy what did that mean for Dean and Cas?
Sighing Sam checks his phone again. Missed call? How did he not see, must have been deep in thought. Unknown number...
"Right I'm beat, so imma shower and then pass out." Dean exclaimed, dumping his bag on the bed and slamming the bathroom door behind him.
“Glad to have some company in hell?” Castiel joked with a sardonic tone, trying to act as normal as possible, well as normal as someone can be when they are counting the freckles on another person's face.
“We can and we will beat you Chuck.” Dean stated, he didn’t know where he was going with this but he just needed to stall so Jack could power up.
At age sixteen he had whacked off to hetero porn but she sounds of the over-the-top screaming from the female didn’t grab his attention. Instead, he was focused on the male, the deep masculine moans as he fucked into the baby sitter, the way his eyes were screwed shut in pleasure and his thighs clenched as he neared orgasm. No, the sounds of the female were background noise as the Pizza man emptied into her and at the same time the confused teenage boy sat there in shame at what he had just done, he was supposed to get off by watching the woman but he couldn’t get the thoughts of strong muscular arms gripping his sides out of his mind.
Dean pulls away from Castiel after what felt like ages. "Cas man how...?" What all he could say. "I'll tell you later, all of it Dean." There was a sadness that lingered in the angels eyes, who was this Steve and was Dean in a relationship with him? They seemed very close. Dean refused to let go of the angels sleeve, he was still quite drunk and was 60% sure that he was hallucinating.
But then it hit him, this relationship couldn't possibly progress into something romantic. Because that would make him happy and if he was happy...
Castiel and Dean followed the gang leader outside. "Ask away, I'll tell you what I know and then we are done got it?" Castiel nodded. "We understand." It was the first thing he had said since they entered the bar.
Most of this chapter is a short summary of episode 19 in season 15, I have changed a few things around but don't read if you haven't watched it.
"He's handsome isn't he?" She cupped the angel's jaw forcing him to look her in the eye, Dean wanted to yell
But then he would be taken away, he was still needed no matter how useless he was told he was. Jack needed him, Dean needed him, even Sam.
"It's about when Jack first died." Castiel looked like he really didn't want to talk about this, but he had no choice.
"Uhh yeah, both couples came in here...you don't think I had anything to do with this? I'm not homophobic my sister's gay so..."
No one had seen him come in so they jumped and looked in the direction of the snarky English accent. “Get out, all three of you and make sure you aren’t back here again or next time I’ll make your lives hell.”
Dean found that shooting them through the head worked, and once he ran out of bullets, he ran to the Impala to get the two scythes in the trunk, he tossed one to his brother who was struggling to fend off three of the things, he saw a bunch of angels had formed a ring around Jack and were protecting him from getting attacked.
When she sucked marks into his skin all he wanted to feel was rough, day-old stubble scraping his neck.
All three friends walked through the halls of Stone Hill High and they made their way to the weekly school assembly. Richard Roman an aspiring politician turned Principal did not look happy, truth be told he never looked happy, he hated his job and he hated children, most people wondered why he took the job maybe because of his insatiable need to exert power over people, he enjoyed the control. He was a skinny man with cropped dark hair and an icy smile. Dick, a nickname that suited him well, given to him by most of his co-workers and students, was the only sort of retaliation that you could get away with in his school.
“Dean? For what it’s worth, I think the biggest mistake you’ve made in this situation is the one you’re making right now.”
“Dean, he was lying,” Michael told him, getting up to step closer to Dean. “Never, ever was that just a meaningless night for him. Believe me.”
As Gracie stepped forward, he let go of her shoulder and stayed back, watching in silence as she knelt down on the stone border of the grave. Given the icy ground, there was no way she would be able to dig a little hole for her latest letter – but Dean knew that’s what she wanted. The envelope was thicker than her usual letters; thicker than what she usually put directly in the grave instead of the box under her bed. And he pretended like he didn’t know why that was.
Even though it was just a short one – more to get warm again and rinse off than anything – Dean was unable to keep his hands to himself, at least one of them touching Cas at all times. He also unabashedly ogled every inch of him, coming to a decision when it was time to step out of the shower. As they dried up, he playfully wound his towel around Cas, pulling him closer with it and into another longing kiss before he said quietly, “That night, you asked me what I wanted.”
Pacing his room, Dean tried to find a thought aside from the constant repetition of, ‘oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,’ that was going on inside his head. It had been
Out of nowhere, Cas’ stomach rumbled, leading them to break apart, chuckling loudly. Dean looked around and then quickly reached for one of the big bath towels.
The bathroom door wasn’t even fully closed when Dean could already feel the burning gazes of Jo and Charlie back on him.
weird to have gone for forty years of his life only to suddenly realize that there was this whole side of desires that he never knew about, right? He thought so at least.
As he started the video again, he allowed his mind to remember Cas’ smile. To see his face. To imagine it being him - not only in the video but also the one who was currently sliding their hand down his stomach to reach into his boxers. To imagine Cas as the one wrapping his hand around Dean’s cock, freeing it from its confines with a sure grip.
After hours and hours of writing, Cas dropped back on his bed at last, looking at the ceiling. Trying to reign in all his emotions.
“But we also saw you at church that day,” Harry took over. “And your turmoil when Cas tried to stop you.”
In the subsequent quiet of his mind, there was only lightness and bliss and that serene smile Dean wasn’t sure he would ever lose again. Slowly letting himself be pulled into the world of the living, he basked in that feeling a moment longer before finally getting up, throwing on some sweatpants and a comfy shirt. He wouldn’t have bothered with either but he had no desire to scar his poor daughter for life. As he stepped out of their room and silently walked down the hallway, he sent a quick smile to Lisa’s picture, which had found its way from his nightstand to the ‘family gallery’ in the hallway.
“Yeah, just a coffee,” he ordered, knowing it would help him sit here just a moment longer. As an afterthought, he added, “And their check for today.”
“I don’t believe you,” he breathed out and when Cas averted his eyes right away, still trying to avoid his gaze, he pressed on. “Cas, if you seriously mean it, then please: look me in the eye and say it again.”
Cas had gotten him a gift? Had really taken the time to find something for him? Had put some thought into what Dean might like and then purchased it?
“Okay,” Cas whispered, thankfully interrupting him and a second later, there were warm lips on his, the kiss sweet, reassuring, lingering. Full of promises and understanding and… love.
“I’m sorry, Michael. I really am sorry, but no. I’m not willing to simply be someone’s fantasy and Cas made it pretty clear that’s all I am. A washed-up old fantasy that he needed to get out of his system. End of story. He’s gone home to move on and I’m not gonna run after him and destroy that. He might have made a mistake – but he’s also suffered enough because of me. So I’m not going to go and ruin his life further.”
And then his daughter was babbling and crying more and more and with every word, a cold vice took hold of his heart, tightening further and further until he was sure he was suffocating.
Sighing, he beat them to talking. “Look, I know what you want to ask and … I just don’t know, okay? I heard what you told me, Jo, and I’m grateful. I’ll just … I guess I’ll just see what happens or whatever.”
“I know that, Dad,” she told him, smiling at him. Right away though, she became serious again. “Okay, so it’s okay for me to keep a secret from you. But… what if you ask me directly? Like you just did? I told you no - which was obviously a lie. And… it’s a difference to keep a secret and to lie, right?”
Deciding to take the welcome distraction, Dean walked back to Ruby’s bay to pick up his jacket, whispering to Sam that he was going to check something outside, and then made his way to the barn door. On his way there, he pulled his phone out of his jacket, just to check.
His voice was barely above a whisper and he could feel the tears well up in his eyes, not even trying to repress them or hide them or anything alike.
Dean also took a moment to admire Luke’s handiwork. The man had actually decorated the table Cas and Gracie always occupied. There was fake snow and a balloon with the picture of Olaf, the snowman from Frozen. Dean couldn’t wait to tease Luke with this - but perhaps on second thought maybe not. After all, the man had certainly done it to show how much he liked Cas and how little he would stand for any gossip and for that, Dean couldn’t be more grateful.
“Don’t be so dumb, Dean, please. Even with the pandemic, if you really, seriously date someone, you can touch, of course.”
“No,” Dean replied with a chuckle, adding the final bow to the wrapped present. “It’s the DVD for Cas.”
Dean watched as Cas and Gracie settled back down into their seats, smiling at each other and then clinking their mugs together as if saluting themselves. This time, Dean did not try to rein in his grin. As the movie started, he leaned back and ignored Lydia’s penetrating perfume. Instead, he much rather enjoyed the warmth and the soft fragrance coming from Cas while he followed George Bailey’s life on the big screen.
He could feel the slight shiver run through his man even as he saw how Cas ignored it and instead murmured back, “I’ll hold you to it,
Rolling his eyes, Cas finally stretched out his left leg. It was not as easy to heave him over and up into the saddle as Dean had hoped, but he managed. He helped Cas position himself correctly before taking a deep breath and mounted up as well.
“I guess I should do the same,” Dean relented. “Spend some time with my family, I mean. I wasn’t the best company over Christmas.”
Maybe it was that little seed of hope or the way his heart was already raw with emotions that had Dean ask, “What makes you say that,” instead of deflecting once more.
“Ohhh, Dean,” Miss Patty was quick to reply, only a slight waver in her voice showing she might be nervous that he had heard them. Quickly, she went on. “Gracie, hello. Hello. Lovely to see you two.”
The envelope was resting in his lap and more than once, Dean looked down at it, wondering. If Cas refused to see him, would it be a good idea to just leave it with him? Including the doodle he knew to still be in there?
Brushing a hand over his face he gave his alarm a quick glance. It was just after ten in the morning. Which meant he had been awake for about two hours, lying in bed, thinking and… well… moping.
Once again, the group on shift worked effortlessly around each other, switching empty cookie boxes with new ones, helping the customers find their favorite sweets, making change, and refilling the little plastic bags in which the customers could throw together their own and unique assortment of cookies.
Cas’ voice was so breathy, so sultry, Dean couldn’t resist but to look back up at his lover. Cas had given up watching Dean, his eyes closed again, head thrown back in passion. A deep blush spread all over his chest, a light sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead, reflecting the dim lights.
They hung up shortly after, and Dean spent the next minutes silently puttering around the kitchen, preparing breakfast and finishing their teas. He brought Gracie hers and kissed her on her forehead, patiently waiting until she was awake enough to take a few sips. Quietly telling her it wasn’t even 10am and that it was okay for her to sleep some more, he left her room. Only once he was back on the couch did he allow himself to think about the last twenty-four hours and all that had happened.
Not really in the mood to do any paperwork after school, Dean still forced himself to stay, sit down, and work on it. Since he’d already opted out of it on Friday, he seriously couldn’t push it yet another day. At least the weather wasn’t very inviting, making it easy to keep inside and in the warm classroom after all. He just hoped Gracie had gotten to
How long he simply stared at his students, he could not tell. It could not have been for long or they would have already eaten him alive. But it felt like hours before he finally found his voice again.
For a second, Dean contemplated if it would be worth it to dig deeper. However, when the church bell rang, indicating it was time for their sale to begin, he shrugged it off. These were sixteen year old girls after all - the wind could change direction and they would giggle.
All breath left him the second he finally looked up, staring into the bluest eyes he had ever seen. Clearing his throat, he came to his senses, holding out the map.
Had he been thinking so much of Cas that he had summoned him? Or worse, was he only imagining his voice?
“You sure about that?” he asked her with a knowing grin. “Cause I’m positive there are stories right there –” he lightly tapped her forehead, “– stories that want to be told. Be it now or in ten or twenty years. And if it’s only for your own entertainment, then that’s alright as well. But don’t think I don’t know you, my sweet pumpkin pie.”
be interested in their teacher’s private life to that degree. Sure thing, they knew a lot about him - bombarded him with questions sometimes and Dean usually had no problem with talking about his daughter or the ranch or even his favorite food. Hell, they even shared vacation stories and plans for the weekends sometimes - kids just were nosey like that and Dean had no issue indulging their curiosity. But he really, really didn’t want to talk about something like
“Whoa, whoa, no. Cas, no,” Dean interrupted as soon as he caught on to what Cas was implying. “No, you couldn’t be further from the truth.” Cradling Cas’ face in one hand to make sure he would look at him, Dean told him in a firm voice, “I wouldn’t have cared about Brady – or anyone else, for that matter – catching us in any way. Not for my sake. But I was thinking about
! Shooting up from the couch, Dean tried to write on his arm again while his hand was shaking like a leaf.
of all people had figured it out already.” And leaning in as if to tell them the secret, both women hanging on his every word, he added in a conspiratorial tone, “I fear you’re losing your edge, ladies.”
She stopped working on his coat and instead used his lapels to hold him close for a moment. Her eyes found his and if he thought he would find even an ounce of regret or disappointment or pain or any of these emotions there, he was severely mistaken. Which probably should not surprise him anymore after last night. But
And as fireworks all around them went off, they shared their first kiss of the new year, the sweet taste of vanilla and sugar on their lips.
Ah, so apparently Eileen had complimented him on his ASL. From what Dean had grasped, it did look good. And it seemed he really did have a friend in the deaf community.
, Dean knew better than to click on them – but he did it anyway. Because apparently, he was turning into a masochist.
“Yes,” Gracie replied with a huge grin, winding her arms around his torso and burying her nose in his thick pullover. “But it’s still so long.”
Sammy’s words came back to mind. The ones he had told him every time Dean had beaten himself up about this moment. For the first time, he realized why he had always had an issue. Sammy talked about
Still, here he was, outside in the cold, sitting on his front porch in the swing he’d installed for his daughter three summers ago. Contemplating. Thinking. He should be inside, making sure Grace was really asleep instead of taking advantage of him being outside to sneak some extra reading time.
“Listen, Dean. I’m not gonna tell you what to do. You’re both responsible adults, so no need for me to give you the big brother speech-”
And that was the honest truth. For as long as Dean could remember, Cas had carved his own special place. Not only in Dean’s heart but in his entire life. Going back as early as the very first time they had met as kids.
Usually, he would take poker night just as serious as his daughter. Tonight, however, he was distracted. Of course, his brother and sister-in-law noticed. Which was why he soon found himself in a conversation he had known he would not be able to avoid for long.
He would probably never know the answer, because in that moment, Grace opened her door and came skipping down the hallway, making a beeline for the kitchen. “What’s for breakfast, Dad?” she called out, obviously not realizing that Dean was still talking to her aunts.
He chose his words carefully - outright praising the author would certainly, possibly raise suspicions. “Definitely better language than J. K. Rowling. Interesting plot. But...”
none, really, since we don't see Cas... but I like to imagine the conversation at the end happening around the same time Cas has his heart to heart with Chuck in
Hannah and Anna, Michael’s twin sisters, loudly entered the room, apparently laughing about something their brother Inias had just said. If Michael knew anything about Dean, then he knew that he would never get him to talk with other people there to listen in. Not waiting for another opening, Dean smiled at Michael, clapped him on the shoulder, and left the kitchen to return back to the living room.
“Just living a fantasy,” Cas replied, still lacking emotion, still quiet though he might as well be screaming for how the words slammed into Dean. “I’ve wanted you for so long, I just couldn’t say no.”
Hurriedly making his way to the diner, Dean couldn’t hide his little satisfied smile when he found that Gracie wasn’t already packing up. Instead, the two of them seemed to be deeply immersed in conversation – a fact that gave him a warm feeling.
“There was never any doubt in my mind that I wanted to marry Lisa. I just… I just wish there would have been a chance to talk to him, you know? A way for him not to be hurt the way he was. We had been friends for so long and… and yeah, I would be lying if I said I didn’t know he had feelings for me. I was just… too blind or… or maybe too scared to see how
Dean swallowed heavily as Harry made his way to the kitchen and Alice came to sit beside him. Taking one of his hands into her own. The way Harry had worded it made Dean sure that he would not like what was coming. Or, well, that he would like it
He knew there was nothing to apologize for, but he still found himself whispering, “Sorry, I’m usually not –”
If not, Dean was reasonably sure that Cas would have enough heart to at least pretend he was thrilled and that he would be able to convince Gracie. But if Dean knew anything about Cas, he knew that he would appreciate Gracie’s gesture and be thrilled about it, no matter the present itself. There would be no reason to fake anything.
to talk with them about everything. Especially things that made him who he was. Like the fact that he knew he liked girls since he was twelve and that he loved boys since he was fourteen. That it had been a hard time for him to come out to his parents but that his brother Sam and his uncle Bobby hadn’t batted an eye about it. That he sometimes wondered… well… about so many things, actually. He wondered about so many things that he wanted to share with C – but he wasn’t able to.
He also knew that Gracie hadn’t been able to throw out the old set of stationary and instead used it for short-term notes.
“Oh, okay,” he replied, still feeling a bit out of sorts. Should he say something to Cas? Should he ask him if he was alright because he hadn’t been there this morning? Should he use this opportunity to finally start a real conversation between them? “Did you get some homework done?”
For a second there, Cas looked taken aback - but the expression quickly vanished, his face neutral and friendly instead. “Sure. I would love to. I’m glad your taste in movies is better than that in books.”
Dean’s stomach dropped. He couldn’t let all this go on as it was. He just couldn’t. If he didn’t set all of this right, if he would let Cas leave now, he was sure he would lose him for good. His hand grasped for the man just as he passed him, not really knowing what he did until he could feel the contact of his hand to Cas’ arm. Cas was tense and yet he did not try to get away, Dean’s simple move having stopped him immediately.
Staring down at his phone, Dean tried to make any sense of the feelings battling inside of him. It didn’t seem rational, having such a strong reaction after the phone call from half an hour ago.
,” Charlie told him, surprise coloring her voice. “Like, okay, they are pretty direct sometimes and some of them aren’t big on small-talk. But they’re still nice and helpful. The world has a completely wrong picture of them, I swear.”
His head jerked up and when he found both women looking at him with concerned gazes, he realized he must have spaced out for a moment. No way they weren’t on to him now.
Heart skipping for just a moment, Dean turned around. His brain already knew that it wasn’t Cas who had called out for him, but Michael’s voice was close enough that he’d reacted to it anyway.
It was then that Dean had to remind himself of a very important fact: Cas was happy with someone else - but that didn’t mean he could not be friends with Dean again. Because, if nothing else, if his feelings would never be returned, the least he wanted was to have Cas’ friendship back. Everything else was unimportant.
In the end, Sam was somewhat saved by his niece. The door slid open and Gracie stepped onto the porch, carrying a big plate; Amara right behind her, balancing two more identical plates; each of them almost overflowing with cookies.
After a few scenes, however, Dean couldn’t take the silence between them anymore. He loved this movie, yes - but more than anything, he wanted to enjoy Cas’ company right now. So he leaned back into his space and whispered, “You didn’t answer my question.”
At that, Lydia raised one eyebrow, making Dean wonder what thought of hers warranted that gesture. But before either of them could speak, Emma piped up.
… that had to mean something, right? Here Dean was, hoping that Cas didn’t hate him – and the man had gone and gotten him a present as well.
Yeah, okay, so maybe Dean had given this conversation about his feelings he absolutely didn’t want to have a bit more thought than was probably adequate.
Instead, he immersed himself in another conversation. It wasn’t long until Amara joined Eileen and him. But before they could talk much, Rebecca was by their side.
of his phone stopped his train of thoughts and he rolled around to reach for where it was lying on the bedside table. He had three text messages from Eileen and one from Sam, which appeared to be the most recent one. There were also two missed calls from his brother, dating back to last night. How had he missed those?
Dean quickly nodded. “Yeah, but one of the judges was sick and I was asked to fill in. You can imagine how bummed Gracie was about missing out - and then Cas offered to help her. And they won.”
Swallowing hard, he tried once more to get a grip on himself. This was supposed to be an easy-going moment – not one filled to the brim with emotions. Emotions so thick they pulled Dean closer to Cas with every second. Thankfully, Cas was watching the DVD instead of Dean, so he had a second to get his voice back to normal.
Despite the fact that Dean knew they tried to divert the attention, it was still nice to hear the sincerity in their voices. They really
. Cas’ hand was wrapped around them both, moving in sure strokes up and down, jacking them off together.
Kneeling in front of Cas, he quickly flicked the beam of his torch over him, seeing his left hand cradled against his chest, eyes squeezed shut in pain.
Dean was breathing hard, floating in this wonderful state of bliss. But he was still aware of everything that had to do with Cas so when he felt him sag, he pulled him down those scant inches separating them. Not caring at all for the mess they had created between them. He knew it would get sticky and itchy soon but he didn’t give a damn.
He could feel Cas’ movement as he looked up at him and for the first time, Dean realized just how close they were. He let his eyes roam over every inch of Cas’ face, trying to find an answer to all his questions. Cas’ warmth didn’t help him concentrate, his thoughts flying back to last night’s dream.
“Thank you,” he finally said, hoping Cas would know just how much this meant to Dean. “Really, this is great.”
The moment he was out the door, Dean took a shallow breath, needing to keep it together so Gracie wouldn’t notice anything was up.
He was able to restrain himself until one of his favorite scenes of the movie came up. As George promised Mary Hatch, the love of his life, to lasso the moon for her, Dean couldn’t help himself anymore. He got up and quickly made his way over to Cas, flopping down into the seat next to him, burrowing low to keep away from prying eyes - after all, he knew how much Cas hated being the subject of gossip.
“Ahh, ummm...” Cas replied, looking around for a moment as if searching before fixing his gaze on one of the pantries. “Yeah, sure. Probably in here, it’s where we keep stuff like that.”
well known in Stars Hollow that Lydia liked him, the gossip mills certainly had no problem working last summer with
The DVD and the envelope both still lay untouched, exactly as he had put them there two nights prior. Swallowing hard, he let them rest there, just staring at them while holding onto the yearbook.
All too soon, Cas seemed to have found another thing he wanted to talk about. Without protest, Dean let him end the kiss and moved willingly as Cas pressed him back down on the bed. His hand was caressing Dean’s chest, once again leaving a tingling sensation in its wake.
decided to ‘come out’. He could already hear the gossip all over town and all the ‘I always knew he was gay’-comments. But he found he didn’t care. Not right now, at least.
Cas was still looking at the closed doors, seemingly deep in thought, and Dean didn’t like the frown on that gorgeous face. He was determined to pull him out of whatever dark thoughts had invaded his mind, so he leaned in, letting his warm breath ghost over Cas’ skin just before he kissed his earlobe; giddy with excitement when Cas’ eyes flutter shut and a breathy puff of air left him.
Dean gave himself another moment to smile at himself - yep, he was totally gone on the guy. There really was no denying it any longer, not even with all the typical Dean Winchester defense mechanism in full play - then picked up the other boxes full of Angel Cookies and followed Cas back to their families.
Bending his head, he pressed a kiss into his unruly hair, breathed out a soft, “I love you,” and let himself drift off to sleep as well.
Letting go of a deep breath, Dean looked back over his shoulder to see Cas still on the phone, then he finally turned his attention to the bay and the ongoing birth of a new life. Sam caught his gaze but they both knew it was best for them to not bring too much disturbance by switching places now. Dr. Richardson would let Dean know if she needed any more help.
“It’s ehm... it’s well,” Dean stuttered, a nervous chuckle breaking free. If it hadn’t been for this charged moment, he would have waited; probably until he could come up with a plan on how to break this to Cas.
When he moved, Cassie looked over to him, catching sight of the pen in his hand right away. Her face fell and while there certainly was disappointment in her features, Dean couldn’t help but notice that there was also an ounce of relief.
The reply was short and it had Dean pacing while he waited for more. When the words finally came, he gasped in relief.
Harry chuckled as he opened the door for Alice and together they all entered the fair. As was to be expected, Gracie claimed a hand from both Alice and Harry and began to pull them to the nearest booth. Dean shook his head and followed his family with a grin.
Getting his beautiful black quarter horse Cherry ready for their ride was such a practiced movement, Dean could probably do it in his sleep. Once he was back outside with her, she was antsy to move right away.
“No. No, Gracie, never.” He knelt down in front of her, putting his hands on her knees. After the initial desire to just get away from the crowd, Dean had stopped the car a few blocks over and had made his way to the passenger side so he could talk to his daughter face to face. “Promise me you’ll never listen to any of these rumors.”
Checking his arm, Dean gulped when he still saw his own words on his arm. So C wasn’t even reading his messages? Maybe they had been busy the past few hours, okay. But that didn’t explain the radio silence over the past few weeks.
Ahhhh, so much miscommunication between these two idiots, I know - and I'm sorry!! But you know it will get better soon 😘
Ignoring Charlie, Dean spoke to Jo as if his crazy friend wasn’t even in the picture. “Yeah, she was awesome. I’m so proud of her.”
For everyone’s sake, though, they kept quiet for the rest of the movie. It wasn’t until the first credits rolled that Dean couldn’t rein in his excitement anymore. He leaned back in towards Cas - completely disregarding that it wasn’t necessary anymore, now that noises rose all around them and he could have easily told Cas what he wanted to tell him at a normal value. But why let such an opportunity go to waste?
To Dean’s astonishment, it was Gabe who plucked the cookie from Gracie’s outstretched hand and ate it without hesitation.
Not hesitating, Dean walked over to where Cas was busying himself with putting away his empty plate. When he looked up, Dean held out the phone to him, smile still playing around his lips. “Here,” he offered and warmth filled him when Cas took the proffered phone without hesitation.
He simply had no idea what all could happen and his brain probably tried to play over all the possible scenarios as to how Cas would react to seeing him again. He needed a plan for every single one of them – and
! It wasn’t as if this was the only reason Dean reacted like this. But it certainly added fuel to the fire and he needed to forcefully hold himself back to not
Unable to follow his desire, all Dean could do was to huff out a laugh and shake his head, hardly able to fully wrap his head around all these emotions.
“So, uhm,” he began, choosing to steer the conversation back into safe waters for now, keeping his voice calm. “Gracie asks if you’ll be back tomorrow. She was really worried for you.”
Dean tried not to roll his eyes as he navigated his Impala into the teacher’s parking lot. It seemed the snow had melted somewhat last night, only to freeze and then be covered by fresh snow. All of that meant that the side-streets and parking lots were especially hard to navigate this early in the morning. Thank God Sam had already texted him that they had all made it to the train station in one piece or he would be worried sick by now.
As he entered the diner, Gracie and Cas were deep in conversation. The picture made all the thoughts about the latest gossip fly right out of his head. It was incredible how much he had come to love this view in such a short time.
“Oh?” Jo replied, her voice and gaze turning way too sweet to be sincere. “So everything was alright when you met again? You talked and laughed and were friends again just like in the old days?”
Still, he knew it wasn’t their fault. The whole issue had been there already, the topic steered up the moment Cas had stepped foot into Stars Hollow. Really, if he was honest with himself, it was a miracle the gossip mills here at school hadn’t started flying around once Gracie began having lunch with Cas every day. Or maybe they had and he just hadn’t realized it…
Alice told him conspiratorially and they both had a good laugh at his expense, only laughing harder when the man in question could be heard grumbling in the background.
“Yes. It is. But, Sweetheart,” he began, taking her face in his hand to softly brush away a tear with his thumb. “You would have been born either way.”
“You know what?” he therefore added before Claire could continue. “Don’t answer that. You told me what the latest gossip is and I think that is enough of that for today. There’s a really good lesson-plan waiting to be-”
Castiel Shurley had been a quiet young boy, always looking stern, mostly keeping to himself, or close to the very few friends he had. Knowing him not only as his student but also privately, Dean knew that this wasn’t always the case. It just so happened that Cas loved to laugh and had his own sense of humor. One that Dean understood and really liked. He’d watched Cas grow up and yet never once had he seen him as “just” Michael’s baby brother. He didn’t know what it was about Cas, but for him, the eight-and-a-half-year age difference had never really mattered. For him, Cas had always been his friend.
bookstore. As was to be expected, Kirk was not impressed by his late-coming but Dean just shoved a twenty into the collecting box that was sat up to fund the latest movie project and Kirk reluctantly let him in.
Stopping Cherry’s movement fully, Dean turned around in the saddle, looking after the shadowy figure that was quickly swallowed by the darkness. He tried to ignore the sadness that was spreading within him, the way each
He stepped next to Cherry in such a way that Cas would simply have to throw his leg over her neck and Dean would be able to push him up the rest of the way.
They both knew what they wanted and that it was only a matter of time until they finally met and could be together for real.
While Alice and Harry shared a moment over being reminded of Chuck’s situation, Dean was unable to look away from where they were holding hands. It was one of the things he loved about them as a couple. All these years and they still sat together on the same couch and held hands. All these years and they were still close, were still each others’ source of comfort. A haven for the other. Dean had to swallow hard, reminded once more of how this could have been him and Lisa one day, if only -
Dean - being the studious person he was - had spent the past two evenings scrolling various internet pages, watching videos, and even reading about gay sex. There were some things and positions that certainly looked interesting; though he could only ever imagine himself with Cas in them.
As they stepped into the kitchen, Dean once again became aware of how early it still was, the gray winter sky only now getting its first touches of rose. The longer they worked on preparing their breakfast though – which mostly consisted of them heavily making out and Dean trying to keep an eye on the pancakes so they wouldn’t burn – the nicer the morning sky looked. By the time everything was plated, the sun had decided to make an appearance, luring both men onto the balcony. While Cas switched on the heaters, Dean settled down on one of the spacious deckchairs, foregoing the table since they would eat the pancakes by hand anyway. As Cas drew closer, Dean made room for him by spreading his legs and bending one knee so Cas could easily sit between them and lean against said knee.
Dean reached his hand out and right away, Cas took it, leaning into him as they followed their friends. They exchanged a quick kiss, smiling at each other as they remembered that Pride wasn’t all that was special about today. It was also their one-year anniversary – and how fitting that it would be celebrated in such a fashion and with so much love.
“Why do you always do that?” Dean breathed out, speaking once more without his brain’s permission. His heart hurt and it was what took over his thinking. “Why do you keep running away from me?”
Swallowing away the bitter taste in his mouth, Dean got into his Baby, glad to find Gracie buried with her nose in her book. Most likely, she hadn’t noticed the weird encounter.
Carefully, father and daughter made their way across the slippery lot, Dean making sure to hug his girl goodbye where her classmates could not see them. She may not be at an age yet where it would annoy her - but she would reach that age sooner or later, and there was no need to push his luck.
innocent if he would be honest. He was totally out of practice. “Just talking, you know. We just had an early dinner.” Well… it wasn’t technically a lie, right?
Knew it instantly - even though the name evaded him at that moment. But even without a name, he remembered that voice, and he knew one thing for sure.
“I’m already trying, Sammy. But … Cas hates me. He won’t even talk to me, not really at least. How am I supposed to befriend him again?”
Within a heartbeat, Dean was joining him, not able to keep the laughter at bay in the face of Cas’ mirth. Trying to muffle his laughter as well, Dean didn’t hesitate when he realized they had to leave or risk exposure. He had to get them out of here or their antics would be the talk of the town when people recognized them.
Sam’s eyes went wide but to his credit, he had himself back under control within seconds. Knowing his brother, he was probably more shocked about Dean’s blatant admission than about the fact itself. His words quickly confirmed Dean’s suspicion.
Not to be overly dramatic, Dean kept the kiss brief (well, briefer than he wanted to, anyway) and revelled in the smile they shared as they parted and looked at each other.
The sudden thought terrified Dean to no end, letting him grip the steering wheel tightly. Why was his damn brain such a jerk lately? Bringing up crap he was trying not to think about. Had thought long forgotten.
“No, Michael,” Dean called back, holding his gaze to make sure his friend knew he was dead serious. “The mistake was made the night before last. Right now, I’m just picking up the pieces.”
He could get lost in this feeling, he just knew it. And sometime soon, he would. For now, though, Cas seemed to have another concern, pulling back way too quickly for Dean’s liking.
There was a stray thought in his mind about how different this was. Not at all bad, simply different. Not a soft body with curves but a strong one with sharp lines and firm edges and it was an alluring, new kind of delicious temptation Dean could hardly wait to dive into.
There were tears in her eyes and only when her thumb softly brushed over his cheek did he realize that there must have been tears in his as well.
Instead, Dean felt rather than saw him lean back in. There was an air of hesitance about his movements – as if Cas wasn’t sure Dean would want his kiss at this very moment. But how could Dean ever
“What would you like?” Cas asked, not sounding like he really cared or even paid all that much attention to Dean’s answer.
For the first time, it wasn’t just a memory. He knew it had played out at their lake, the one most kids and teenagers of the town had spent their summers at. But Dean hadn’t been there for years; being a teacher meant he shouldn’t be where all his students would hang out. But mostly, the man next to him certainly hadn’t been a teenaged Cas. He had been the Cas Dean knew now. At least as far as Dean could tell. If the way he’d pictured Cas’ bare upper body in his dream was correct, Dean couldn’t say.
“Dean, wait,” he breathed out, putting some space between their lips. He didn’t go far, but still too far for Dean’s taste. “Hang on, wait a minute.”
The reaction had Dean confused, even more so when Cas brought his hands up to either side of Dean’s face, cradling it. He was trying to stop him, right? He was about to shush him and then tell him to please not take it too hard, to please not make a scene because Cas didn’t want him.
“What...” he began, then swallowed to find his voice or rather, the right words. Pointing at the pie, he asked, “What’s that?”
Moving over the fair, he kept his head down, no desire for any chit-chat this morning or questions about where Gracie may be. He was successful in his mission, got the almonds, and was already on the way back – when the sound of his name made him stop and momentarily close his eyes.
He carefully checked in the other room where Anna had put her kids down, but all he found was the two peacefully sleeping girls and Anna’s baby boy. If she wasn’t up here somewhere, Dean had a pretty good guess where he would find his daughter, so he made his way back down and beelined for the kitchen and the door that led to the patio.
Michael rolled his eyes – his very sophisticated way of flipping Dean off – moving on to Eileen when Dean just chuckled.
The way Cas greedily grabbed Dean’s sweater and pulled it over his head, already reaching for his shirt without even giving Dean time to fully get rid of the first item… yeah, he was sure Cas was just as eager.
. However, he really had no desire to think of his best friend while in bed with said best friend’s little brother. He’d much rather kiss Cas again so he did just that and when Cas opened up to him, he took the invitation and deepened their kiss.
“I... I feel like I should tell you something. Because I hate for this to stay a secret between us.”
It had been difficult to tell Gracie about what happened; difficult to keep his own worry for Cas out of his voice as he tried to reassure her that Cas would most likely be okay. Dean wasn’t sure he succeeded.
Smiling to himself at that memory, Dean added, “or do you really think I let just any of my friends’ little brothers play with us?”
Leaning back against his desk, he squeezed the bridge of his nose, trying to quench the fast oncoming headache and to get his emotions in check.
It was like watching an accident about to happen. Knowing the cars would crash into each other but not able to stop it. Knowing the glass would drop to the flour, shatter into a million pieces, but not able to catch it in time.
Dean left that night with a promise that they would still stay in contact – just because they weren’t soulmates didn’t mean they couldn’t be friends, after all. It wasn’t until he was home and had time to think that he realized another implication with his discovery.
“Thank you,” was all he heard Cas say, like a whisper, but Dean was distracted by his own hand. He didn’t want to lose the contact to Cas, and yet Dean forced himself to let go. With Cas stepping past him, the situation resulted in Dean’s hand brushing along Cas’ arm the whole way down, the feeling and the impact of the moment leaving Dean rooted to the spot, watching the setting winter sun long after Cas had stepped back inside.
Taking a few quick breaths, not daring to let go of Cas, Dean pulled every scattered brain cell back together, before yelling into the storm, “Coming. Just a minute. You got it covered?”
Yes, Dean knew it was absolutely cheesy, asking this, but given the way Cas had looked when George had made his promise, he was pretty sure that Cas was secretly a huge romantic.
Sitting up, Dean decided that there was something else he finally wanted to be stronger about. He might have come out to his parents years ago, but after that, he always made sure to be discreet about his sexuality, trying not to shove it in their face.
Dean tried not to look hurt, thankful for his brother as he jumped in and greeted Cas as well, then introduced him to Eileen. All the while, Dean tried not to get whiplash from how fast his heart had gone from racing to heavy with the formal and cold way Cas had greeted him. After all, wasn’t this one of the possible scenarios he’d played out in his head? He’d known the possibility that Cas still hated him had been high, and now all that had happened was the confirmation of his fears.

As he  headed for the main road he caught  the eye of a cute blond in a scraggy denim jacket Setting up outside the pub across the street .

So one afternoon while out for a walk,, cas noticed a help wanted sighn on the door of the local bowling hall. and the rest as they say is history .
The last leg of the flight had been spent having the back of his seat repeatedly kicked by a board 10 year old who's mother was paying 0 attention to him engrossed in some beauty magazine or other

You took care of me I'm just returning the favour,, marther laughed doubling over as a hacking cough overtook her. Cas flew to her side rubbing circles and gently patting her back whispering words of comfort.  It's ok I've got u !! She sat back against the pillows.
Castiel stered up at the ceiling willing him self to fall asleep everything was to loud,,  the sounds of cars wizing past and dogs barking,,  he mist his quiet apartment the only nois he had to listen to was Anna snoring down the hall,,  after what felt like an eternity of tossing and turning Castiel gave up and decided to pull up the pick he had taken of the assistant listing .
Castiel loved all kinds of music but he specifically loved old music, it reminded him of his childhood. He felt his music taste was a little too outdated so he was nervous about sharing, he did it anyway. Something about Green made Cas trust him, Green wouldn’t judge him
Sam gave his older brother a once over. “Dean? Whose blood is that?” Dean didn’t answer he just kept staring at the almost empty bottle of whisky.
This entire thing was a big misunderstanding, Dean had never been great at emotions but it was all becoming clear.
They left Chuck there, to suffer alone as a human. They didn’t kill him; they were better than that.
"Well I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that it brought me back." He said nonchalantly. "I tried to call Dean but it kept going to voicemail, is he ok?"
Could he finally be happy without the threat of death looming over him? First things first make it right with Dean.
"What?" She laughs. "Let me guess, you'll kill me?" Dean just grins and shakes his head. "Oh we are way past that now." He looks directly into her eyes. "Killing would be a mercy for what I'm about to do to you."
Castiel felt himself drawn to Green, he had no idea who he was or what he looked like but he knew that they had made a connection.
Now I bet you’re wondering when I get to Castiel and Dean and also, I bet you’re thinking why are they putting themselves in the narrative, Isn't that an overused trope? It’s because I have run out of ideas and have no idea how to surreptitiously transition to the start of a new story; the story of how Dean and Cas got together which I shall reveal in the next chapter because it’s a complicated and steamy story, it needs more than a few lines and before we get to that, I must get ahead of myself. ;)
"Werewolves, well I think so anyway, a couple had their hearts ripped from their chests, and another couple even closer to the crime scene." Sam stared at his laptop some more. "Says that it happened in Wisconsin, the place is an 8 hour drive from here so we need to move now."
It never came and the silence wrapped around him like thick black icy tendrils him enveloping him in a cruel embrace.
Jack and Castiel had already been reunited and it had been touching, the angel had pulled Jack in for a hug and the blonde had just stood there awkwardly and then realized what this was. It was a Cas move, scarily so.
Did he imagine it all? His heart beat faster, was he having a panic attack? Fuck fuck fuck. No it all felt so real, he could still smell Castiel on his pillow.
"Stay with me?" Dean grinned grabbing the angel's hand, Castiel just nodded and was dragged to the disturbingly colorful motel bed.
He gathers a large amount on his fingers. "You ready?" He searches Cas' face for any sory of hesitation.
"Dammit Cas he's not my boyfriend!" Dean sprung from his bed moving towards the startled angel. "He was never my boyfriend, we didn't even sleep together." He grabbed Castiel's arm and cupped his face, forcing him to look him in the eyes.
He lay down next to Dean and Dean once again closed their distance by putting his head on the angel's shoulder and a hand on his chest. Castiel took his arm and wrapped it around Dean pulling him closer.
"Hello boys" She purred entering the room again, with another snap of her fingers both men were tied up to wooden chairs in a dimly lit room. "So this is where you live?" Dean chided. "It's uh...homey with a silence of the lambs vibe."
He pulled down Castiel's black trousers and tossed them to the floor. "I'm gonna take care of you Cas, make you feel so good. Do you trust me?"
“Dean! Dean! I- ahh! Dean!” Castiel sobbed loudly as his balls drew up and felt impossibly tight, he felt a tingle in the base of his dick, it got more and more acute and then he came hard, shaking with the full force of his orgasm, Dean nailed his prostate one more time and he seized up and cried out as his cock spurted another load of come between their bodies reigniting his already powerful orgasm making him arch his back and throw back his head as he yelled Dean’s name.
"Yeah he would'a liked you kid." Suddenly Jacks eyes flashed yellow and he doubled back, Dean just stared.
"You died, I saw you...man we burned your body." Sam returned the hug, they finished with a manly back pat and one last touch of the shoulder.
I love your feedback and comments, please notify me of any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes xx
"I wanted to check if you were angry at me for doing the right thing, evidently you still are. Goodbye Dean."
Luckily that little mind rant had distracted him, but now he needed something else to distract him, his old friend Mr. Whisky.
"Cas, come on man you can't stay like that all day." Dean crouched down to where Castiel was splayed out on the floor like a regretful starfish.
Dean knew that the future would be full of heartbreak, just like the past, there would be loss and pain.
It looked like for a moment they were winning, but Chuck had also noticed and sent another wave of creatures.
When he got to the bar it wasn't that crowded, he took a seat a the bar and ordered three shots of whiskey.
Dean looked at the sunset and the calm waves sloshing against the damp sand as the cool air whipped his body softly.
The man just looked them up and down. "Oh god." He chuckled unpleasantly. "You're not are you? Fuck they even got them in the government now. It's a disease I swear." Then he took a step forward. "I didn't kill those men, ain't had nothing to do with them." His smile stretched wide across his face menacingly. "But I wish I had."
Castiel finally nodded and Dean loosened his grip. The hunter pulled at his trenchcoat. "Take it off man, get more comfortable."
Castiel hurriedly kissed him on the mouth, pushing into the lean hunter. His arms encircled Dean's neck and Dean pulled him closer trying to feel every inch of the angel, with hands roaming and tounges clashing Dean was very aware of how open and vulnerable they both were.
The stretch was not painful but it was slightly unpleasant, nothing had ever entered Cas so he was a virgin again in that respect.
Castiel groaned and felt a pat on his shoulder, he quickly whipped round to be met with the face of Dean Winchester.
He goes to his bedside table and opens the bottom drawer, he pulls out a silver ring, it was his fathers, Dean had worn it for years before taking it off and then after that he'd stopped.
Dean picked up the tie that he has discarded on the bed. He brought Cas' hands up above his head and fastened them together with the blue tie. "Keep them above your head, don't move." He said as he took Cas' nipple in his mouth and bit lightly.
"No, Castiel. Castiel is my father." Dean clenched his fists, how dare he. Cas was dead because of him and he was calling him his father. "Kid he ain't your father ok." He snapped.
Dean and Charlie got up to leave but Castiel stayed behind. “Something you would like to say Novak?”
Castiel noticed a new engraving on the table. “You carved my name into the table?” Castiel questioned.
He wrapped an arm around Castiel so the fallen angel was pressed against his side and he put his head on Castiel's while drifting off to sleep.
Castiel could openly admit to himself that Dean was beautiful and he had fantasied about him a few...hundred times, but sadly Dean was painfully straight.
"Knock yourself out." Jack just looked confused. "How?" He questioned with a furrowed brow. "Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of me trying coffee?" Dean felt the tears, god he was so much like him...god Cas I miss you so much.
“You know that I- fuck Cas I-.” He struggles to get it out, he’s never told Cas he loves him and he wants it to be perfect.
"Dean you have to understand-" Castiel unfortunately though that was the best moment to share his feelings.
Sam, Dean and Castiel made it back to the bunker in silence, half in shock and half in no one really knew what to say.
"Since you're a regular Joe now Cas, you're gonna need clothes and stuff." He turned into the parking garage of a large mall.
Dean's eyes flick down to Castiel's lips and then he licks his own. Castiel felt the hand in his hair tighten and he wanted this more than anything.
The bunker was really no place for a child so Sam moved out once Mary was born and him and Eileen get a nice place, two stories, three bedrooms and two bathrooms, about a ten minute walk from there.
He cried out from the sudden change of pace and when Dean changed the angle and nailed his prostate he thought he would die.
Dean and Charlie had already disappeared and Hannah was studying in the library with a very insistent Metatron, Castiel chuckled at the thought.
Castiel backed away till he felt the wall. "I made a deal. My life for his, the catch was the Empty wanted me to suffer, it would only take me away when I was truly happy and since there was no way that was happening I took a calculated risk."
She turns to Dean. "It's a shame really, to mutilate such a beautiful vessel but it's all worth it to see the hurt and anguish on your face as I'm cutting into loverboy here." Dean growls at her and glares, she seems taken aback for a split second but reverts back to her regular demeanor.
Gripping the sleeve of the trenchcoat he pulls Castiel to him but topples over, strong hands grip his back stopping him from an embarrassing fall. "Hello Dean."
But Dean didn't let up, he pulled them together so their chests where touching and Castiel blushed like a virgin.
A short burst of Nephilim grace and Castiel is back on his feet. "Thank you Jack, I feel much better."
"Dean it's been a long night, we still have a few hours to go. Why don't you let me drive? You should get some sleep." Sam said from beside him.
Sam just sits at the table waiting for his brothers return, Dean wasn't picking up, he had been gone for hours.
He gets into Baby and tries to calm himself down. What the fuck was wrong with Cas? Why didn't he ever learn?
In the end, Gracie had been ecstatic with her choice of gift while Dean was rather amused by his own. Both presents, and extra Christmas cards, were now safely tucked away in the trunk of his Impala and would join their stack back home with all the presents for the rest of their friends and family.
Instead, Dean engaged in the general conversations going on around the table, laughing and enjoying the time with everyone. It truly had been a wonderful day so far and he knew it was far from being over – but if anyone asked him, he could spend eternity here. The only thing that needed to change was this frosty atmosphere between him and Cas and – God damn it all – he would make sure it happened.
He didn’t have to search for his favorite fountain pen - his desk was rather in order, despite what most people might think of him - and with it in hand, he read over the quote again, making sure he had memorized it enough to write somewhat fluently.
It was a constant push and pull and every time he thought he and Cas had taken a step forward, there was something throwing them back. Just this Saturday, he had finally admitted to himself the
Thankfully, Dean was distracted from all these maddening thoughts when Cas suddenly turned around without another word, starting on the track back toward Shurley Manson.
“I heard him talk to the guy once or twice and saw a picture on his phone. Guys, really,” he told them, getting up. “It doesn’t matter. Two more weeks, and he’ll be gone again anyway. So, no need to push for anything. Let me enjoy the time I have with him. Having his friendship again… really, it’s enough for me.”
If anyone deserved this, it was certainly Cas. After everything he’d been through, all the taunting and embarrassment, after all that had been said about him, all the gossip and heartache, he
Intrigued by this reaction, Dean stopped pretending not to watch the interaction. Now that everyone was focused on them, he didn’t feel the need to keep up the charade.
been a great success for the town. They had gotten more tourists and Dean knew a lot of business owners around town had benefited from that. Dean and a lot of other residents from Stars Hollow certainly wouldn’t mind a repeat of all this next year.
When he was absolutely sure that Cas would still be standing when he got back, Dean stepped past him and over to where Cherry was calmly grazing, the light on her harness a little beacon summoning him toward her.
It didn’t take much to stop and turn him around, which Dean made sure to do gently, not letting his anger get the better of him. Cas followed his lead like a rag doll, absolutely no power left in him it seemed.
to but other parts were – and he would never admit this out loud – shy about it. He was confident that it wouldn’t stay this way, not for long. There was no need to try
Sure that the call would end any moment now, Dean tried to pull himself together. To breathe evenly.
Ohh, how he hoped his straight-shooter would never, ever change. His smile grew wider as he replied with, “Yes, Gracie, I told him.”
Time passed quicker than Dean would have thought possible, Eileen and him not getting another chance to talk on their own. He wasn't quite sure if he should be relieved about that or not. He was certainly curious what Eileen had been talking with Cas about them.
Dean didn’t let it deter him, continuing instead as if Cas hadn’t spoken. “And secondly, if that’s true, why did Zar order it?”
“You called it a ‘schoolboy crush’ and something he would have grown out of by now. Correct me if I’m wrong, but haven’t
“I had many years to learn it,” Cas replied to something Eileen must have said and that Dean had completely missed. What he didn’t miss was the cute smile on Cas’ face.

Damn, she had been so upset about the whole situation. She had truly believed Cas still had feelings for him but seeing him react like that… it must have been an eye-opener.
“No, no. That was my mistake,” Dean cut the other person off, already crouching down to pick up the campus map the guy had dropped. “Sorry, I should’ve–”
“Dean! Get it together,” Michael murmured harshly into his ear, pushing him in another direction than Dean wanted to go. Needed to go. Why was he doing that? “
He hadn’t showered in way too long, so that was definitely in order before anything else. He was already reeking. And at least after that, he might begin to feel human again.
His suspicions had been confirmed: Cas still hated him. It was to be expected, and now Dean at least knew for sure where he stood with Cas. Maybe he could work from there and see if he could mend some things.
