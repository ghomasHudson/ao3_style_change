Going inside HQ they went up to Nick's office and couldn’t believe their eyes. Sitting across the room was a girl about the same age as Peter.
Mad-Eye Moody scoffed and crossed his arms. “Fighting like a mad man. Albus.”
Steve looked up. “We didn’t want everyone to know our business. Sorry everyone we wanted time to ourselves. Our daughter made us realize that we needed to come public.”
She wore a strapless ballroom dress that was tie-dyed in a million different colors. The lace under her dress was a bright neon orange that could be seen every time she moved.  Her mask though matched Peter’s so they looked united. She felt weird in the dress because it showed off her metal arms to everyone else. Her biggest weakness.
“Because then they will know I am a freak of nature and want to get to know me just because I have powers. We have killed people, with our actions that were flawed.” She grabbed the bottom of her chair. “We can not pretend anymore, Peter.”
Keeping manage of twins kept the husbands busy trying to keep up with who was changed and who wasn’t at first, but after two weeks of working hard, they had a schedule. Tony would take one of the twins down to the lab and rock them while working on blueprints. Steve would take the other to the gym in the portable crib.
With everyone working together they were able to stop the city from flying away and killing millions. The couple was happy that they got to save those in trouble for there honeymoon. But, just like everyone else they wanted to go away and cherish their love together.
“Easy there.” Tony smiled and kissed back on his sweet lips. He took off his shirt and pants standing in front of his blonde husband. Man did Tony enjoy calling him husband.
Beep…
Tony, I miss you. I heard a rumor I might be home before Christmas. Our first real Christmas together. I helped save a family out of a burning house last week. I have never felt so useful! I can’t wait to hold your hand again. I miss you. I hate seeing kids hurt. Thanks for the ‘homemade’ cookies Sorry, I can’t write a long letter like you. You are the genius after all. That last eight-page letter was amazing by the way.
The court began before Violet even arrived. Which had both Steve and Tony worried. Tony wanted to see the little girl more than anything in the world, but maybe he wouldn’t get that chance today.
“You can do it, sugar cube,” Peter smiled and held his hand out. “Let’s get you closer though.”
Tony walked up to the podium and tapped the microphone making the feedback pierce everyone's ears in the room. “Well, at least we know this is on now. Now, everyone, I will be doing the talking no interrupting or I will leave here and give Clark Kent and Lois Lane the inside scoop with my twins.
Bruce knocked on the door then went in smiling. “I take it that this is her,” He slowly walked over and stood in front of the two women. “Hello, I’m Bruce and I see you already met Nat..”
Harry’s other hand flinched and everyone in the group cast the spell as the plan said. “Stupefy!”
“Not the wand for you. Let me think,” he sat there then smiled. “I have the perfect thing! Unicorn hair and firefly soul! Here you are, Luna.”
“Would you care to sit down?” Tony pointed to the chair in front of the TV facing everyone. He didn’t want her standing behind him.
Violet nodded and rubbed her eyes sleepy. “It okay. See him next time.”
“No. They can’t be separated. They are meant to be together.” Tony told her and sighed.
The flight back was quiet. No one knew what to say to the Stark-Rogers family. Luna sat next to Peter holding the broomstick in her lap. Steve laid his head on Bucky’s shoulder quietly sobbing into his shirt. They didn’t know what was going to make this family complete again.
“When will you tell him?” Bruce asked sitting on the bed. Slowly he pulled her into his chest kissing her head.
She shook her head and made the violin appear and began to play with the sounds going straight into her headphones. Peter watched her until his eyelids couldn’t take it any longer and drifted himself to sleep.
“Violet, you know that your our daughter and Peter is your brother, don’t you?” Tony asked hoping that she did.
When the elevator ding went off she froze in her spot. Gripping the couch cushion making her fingertips white. Looking over she saw the light from her dad's chest.
“No,” Peter yelled and ran into Happy’s arms.
Bruce pulled out a portable IV pole from the bag he brought up. “I will. Let me at least get you set up on an IV to make sure your not dehydrating. Your gonna need more water and everything, Luna.”
Helen Cho looked at them then back to her watch. “I should get going, and Bruce don’t forget to tell them about the boys special powers already.”
The press was taking pictures. Yelling a million questions there way. The flashes never ended making everyone start to blind them.
“Does mother know you are wearing her dress?” Tony asked and snorted calling his suit to attach to his body.
With knowing everything Tony did he began to transfer a copy his mind into the computer system. Between treatments, he would go down into the lab and recorded videos of him talking about anything he could think about. Mainly to Luna on her wedding day, and graduating college and high school. Things he was never going to be able to attend. He was never going to see his baby girl in her wedding dress. Never walk her down the aisle. He hated that more than anything else. He wasn’t going to be there for his family.
They didn’t hear Bucky’s warning. When they walked out the paparazzi were swarming them. Cameras kept going off and people were yelling their questions.
“Okay… then. Did you sleep last night?”
Bruce walked out of Tony’s room and smiled. “Steve, he’s awake and asking for you guys.”
“So, I told Peter I would fix everything. He forgot the promise as he grew up into the young man he became to be. He would be so upset if he knew I saw you guys. A-anyway… he married and had four kids while going to MIT. I went to NYU and got my business degree so I could take over Stark Industries from Pepper since she wanted to get it on with Uncle Phil.  So, I hurried and got my degree leaving my music in the past along with my boyfriend, Gilbert. Time past and I started dating Gilbert again.
“Along with the Avengers Land opening in Disneyland next week… we thought we could do Comic-Con and have you with us at the grand opening!” Steve smiled and held his hands up.
I walked out of the home I built with my bare hands and got in the car. The five-minute drive to Peter’s house was quiet. I parked the car outside of the building and went into the elevator. “Karen, please bring me to Peter.”
Steve looked at the man. “Bucky wouldn’t have hurt her. Decides he’s at the penthouse. Hasn’t left since the trial started. He had an episode last night, so he decided to stay still. Has she been taking her pills?”
“We got this,” Tony shrugged and put his faceplate on taking Steve’s hand. “Enjoy the show kiddo.”
“Shh!” A mother from the front yelled back to them.
Gale’s heart sored for him. “I’m so sorry. I won’t say a word. I will try and get you home as soon as possible. Let’s get these papers signed. I will get Steve to sign them when he comes in.”
Violet stayed quiet for a minute. Did she trust them? “Yes.”
The rest of the drive was quiet while AC/DC played in the background. Everyone sang along laughing. They weren’t laughing when the front end of the car got shot at. Blood splattered the divider. The limo flipped on to its’ side causing Steve and Tony to land on top of Bucky, Sam, and Rhodey.
“Yeah. Daddy, Luna. Daddy.” Tony whispered and began to cry. “I love you. I love you so much.”
“Peter sit down, we need to talk,” Tony told him and smiled slightly. “I know you like our daughter. She is special and unique. I’m glad we know the boy who likes her personally, but we need to know what you want to tell her as in how we met and who you are to us.”
She nodded and kissed both of them on the cheek and walked through the portal to the platform. She kept her glittery Hello Kitty bookbag close along with her cane.
“We need to. Come on, Steve, Lu,” Tony told them to lead them down the stairs, telling Luna step every time they went down. Once down the stairs, they went out into the open where the press surrounded them. Steve let go of Luna’s hand taking the left side of the crowd while Tony took the right with Luna. She opened her cane once Tony let go of her hand.
Bucky went behind Peter putting a hand on his shoulder. “Peter she might not be okay in the head. Remember when I came home? Of course, you do you don’t forget anything. I was a bit shaky for a while and couldn’t remember much. She’s gonna be the same way for a while.”
“Thank you again for saving from that boy back there. I wouldn’t have known what to do decides to take it,” Luna whispered. “I don’t really care what people think… it’s best not too.”
“Stuff. Tony gave her a boost. He just wants you to check her over.” Peter told him and looked around. Going over to the buffet Peter grabbed a roll and a bottle of water going back to his sister.
Luna looked towards the reporter smiling. “I enjoy feeling safe and it’s nice to have a secret identity. And know that everyone near me is able to keep me safe. I love all my aunts and uncles with my heart, but my parents with every breath that I take.”
“Mr. Tony… Mr. Steve,” Mr. Parker opened the door slowly. “I’m so sorry to bother you… but I-I...” He stared right at me.
“My brother Captain Dietfried Bougainvillea told us to strike this tower. We needed to get files from your computer, sir.”
“That's not fair!” Peter yelled. “I told you I didn’t want to invent anymore and stopped. You were the one that told me it was fine!”
Luna was so fantasized by all the pretty colors that she didn’t start running until Neville pulled on her arm. She followed them liking how they all kept close. She’s going to miss having her glasses in the muggle world. She knows she has it lucky out in the wizarding world.
Tony walked into the bedroom and opened the closet jumping back. “Shit you gave me a heart attack kid.”
“Oh yeah like everyone does.” Tony rolled his eyes.
Luna got up from her seat and walked up to the stage gripping Newt’s metal guide collar. He let out a little wine every time there was a step. Once she was at the podium she looked up for the first time in the past week. Her face was pale with dark circles around her bloodshot eyes.
That was the last time Luna left the house. Steve and Tony couldn’t handle the thought of her dying from a Hydra agent or even from a freak accident. They started treating her like her disease and not her. Luna was just happy that they loved her and kept her safe every day.
Clint shook his head. “Not that movie again!”
“We love you so much,” Steve told them and gripped his arms.
“I’ll wait, I’ll wait… I love you like you’ve never felt the pain. I’ll wait. I promise you don’t have to be afraid. I’ll wait. The love is here and here to stay.”
“Fine. Have a good night Violet.” Steve told her and kissed her cheek pulling her into a hug.
“Vi, it’s dinner. Come on.” Steve told her from the doorway. He held his hand out for the girl who took his hand and skipped off with.
Steve smiled, “Avatar the Last Airbender. That one fits us nicely. And I actually like that show.”
Luna rolled her eye and leaned into his hug more. “I won’t need that stuff. You just swore you would be back safe. Anyway. I love you papa and I’ll see you later. Alright. I’ll behave for them. I love you.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile slightly. “What are we doing here?”
With that Violet too began to cry with him while shaking.  “Daddy and Papa left us?”
“Just like your, Papa,” Tony told her and got up from the computer going into the kitchen grabbing plates out.
Luna cleared her throat and turned to face where his voice came from. “My real name is Luca Xenophilius Lovegood. Apparently to save me from evil my mom had me turned into a girl, but I am happy who I am. Luna Pandora-Elizabeth-Sara Lovegood-Stark-Rogers. For short Luna Elizabeth-Sara Stark-Rogers.”
They didn’t even get to the door when Doctor Cho called them to come back. The husbands sat in the office looking at Doctor Cho who looked nervous.
Tony kneeled and held the Ferby out to her. “It’s okay.”
“If Peter signs I will sign. But, I do have a question. Are going to be able to change our real names for protection? I had no choice in my identity coming out into the real world. No one knew about us, but Peter’s friend, Ned. We went to different schools so it never mattered to me. But now that they have identified me as a Rogers-Stark, instead of Evergarden. I fear that someone might notice.” She whispered and looked up at him. “If you cannot protect my identity I will walk away.”
“Yes. It’s just good to know we have family everywhere. Magical and real world. It’ll help for the future. What everything has to offer us. We can do anything we wish for now on.”
“Grown men can clean their own apartments, Tony,” Steve laughs.
Tony’s fingers trail along Steve’s chest, stopping to rest on a particularly interesting part of his rib cage.
trouble?”
“I don’t like it when mommies are mean,” one of the children says, and the rest agree quickly.
“Just come with me, Paul,” Steve tries again. Millimeters, now. He can feel the barrel touch his finger. If he lunges he can rip it away from Paul. Just a little more…
“You sure you’re ready?” he asks, barely waiting for Steve to say “
“What if I want you for more than a night?” Tony asks after pulling away.
“Let me get the doc,” Tony says. He gets up, and when his hand leaves Steve they both feel the sudden loss.
Steve is inching forward, his fingertips just centimeters away from the barrel of the gun. If he can just get his hands around it, he can probably wrestle it away from Paul. And he’s pretty sure he can incapacitate the man. He is strong, and his body is full of adrenaline right now. His hands are shaking, but all he can think about is protecting Tony.
It’s only seconds later but finally he arrives in the basement and feels, once again, completely out of his element. He’s covered in sawdust and he feels like it’s going to somehow intrude on whatever Tony is working on. This whole floor is covered in computers and equipment that look like they cost more than Steve’s whole life is worth.
TWO WEEKS LATER
“It’s too late for that! My life is over!”
for this meeting.
The children trailed through the gallery until coming to the very end: Steve’s drawings by the bathrooms. They looked for a while, seemingly quiet, before one finally piped up, “I like the happy picture better.” The rest of the children agreed instantly.
He wants to call Tony, to tell him he can’t come finish the sculpture today. But the timeline is too short. He has to finish carving and put the first coat of varnish on. He has to do it tonight or else it won’t be ready in time for Tony’s party.
“I kind of like it without paint,” Tony says. “Stands out against this white tile in here. It’s nice.”
Whenever the image of Tony pops into his head. He refuses to acknowledge the tent that forms in his pants when his thoughts wander to Tony’s hand around him, Tony’s cock inside him.
Tony steps forward, his hands reaching for Steve. One hand goes to Steve’s hip, the other to his neck. Tony looks at him for a minute, and then he brings their mouths together. Steve is hesitant, but eventually he opens up to the kiss. It’s slow and gentle, chaste.
“Well, I
Tony scoots himself over to the other side of the tub and presses himself against Steve, his breath millimeters away from Steve’s mouth. “Of course I want to try this with you,” he says, and he kisses Steve deeply. It lasts several seconds before Tony pulls away and then slides back to his side of the tub. “Anyway,” he continues, “I wasn’t really giving you a choice. I was serious about hunting you down.”
“See you later,” Tony says, grinning when Steve just looks at him dumbfounded. The elevator dings open, and Steve still just stares after Tony as he walks away, waving goodbye without turning around.
Steve grimaces. He can’t afford another car right now.
Steve nods. “And you say I’m the artist.”
“I had a scholarship when I graduated high school,” Steve begins. “I went for two years but couldn’t make ends meet. I ended up getting a job at a bar, and then…,” he trails off. And then he became a prostitute and sold himself for money.
“Are we talking a million dollar show where they’ll have the Mona Lisa, or what?”
He drops his phone onto his stomach and sighs. This day couldn’t get any worse if it tried.
Tony sighs. “Your car is gone. Totaled for sure.”
In the bathroom, though, his worst fear comes true when he pushes the mirror closed on the medicine cabinet and sees the word “SLUT” written in dark red letters. He suddenly knows who did this, who is responsible for destroying everything he has, and fear runs through him.
He hadn’t though too much about the gallery since he’d been busy with Tony’s sculpture, and with his regular life. He’d honestly forgotten about the whole thing, about his drawing of the girl in the park.
The wood certainly needs detail, but for the most part, it is exactly where Steve wants it to be. He’s ready to stop for the night, because he knows if he starts actually carving, he’ll get so lost in it that he’ll work until he falls asleep from sheer exhaustion. And he can’t do that. Because his client is going to be waiting for him in the morning. He has to leave this fantasy world he’s built to go back to reality.
The whole scene unfolds in seconds, but for Steve, it seems to take minutes. He sees Paul standing on the other side of the living room, right before the carpet meets the tile of the kitchen. He has a gun raised directly at Tony, a terrible sneer on his face, and when he sees Steve, his face only becomes more violent.
“How long?”
It takes a few minutes, but eventually Steve manages to get to his feet and stumbles towards the bathroom. He grips the countertop as he looks at his reflection, trying not to stare at the blood trickling down his chest from his nipple. He can already see purple bruising forming around his stomach where Paul’s knee held his weight. He won’t even bring himself to look down at the fist-shaped bruises on his dick. He can’t. He won’t.
“Up to you,” Steve says, stepping back and leaning against a table. He tries not to grimace in pain again, but he can’t help it.
“What thing?” Tony pries.
Steve draws until he hears Tony’s alarm clock go off and then he goes back into the bedroom to make sure the other man actually gets up. Tony has a morning meeting that his CEO said he could not miss, and she’d even tasked Steve with ensuring Tony got there on time. But waking Tony up before he was ready was like waking the dead, and it takes a lot of coaxing to actually make him rise out of the bed.
Steve just grins back, shaking his head. “I bet that’s what people say about your place,” Steve says.
He takes a step back, wiping sawdust from his face and clothes, before grabbing the tape measure and heading to the elevator. Tony said he was in the lab on the basement level, so that’s where Steve is going to go. The elevator dings when it reaches his floor and Steve steps on, cautiously pressing the button for the basement and then stepping back to lean against the wall as the lift descends.
“What do you do?”
“Maybe for you, but do you know what my wife said when the police showed up at my house, Steve? She said she wanted a divorce. Because she believes you, and that’s all that matters.”
“I…can’t,” he says again.
Every thought he has is about Tony, and he has to mentally scold himself. He says,
“Yeah?” Steve says, feeling the heat creep into his cheeks again.
Tony watches him go, and Steve tries to hide the fear the has cropped back up into his chest. He wants to push it aside, he wants to ignore it and pretend it’s not there. But he can’t, because a threat against Tony, or a threat against him, can’t be ignored. He has to make sure things are safe. He has to make sure that
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s humming as he works, or that the smile on his face hasn’t faded, or that he’s happy. It’s a feeling that he’s become so familiar with that he can’t even remember the last time he was
His head is screaming for him to stop, but his body won’t let him. He wants this, and even if it’s one time, even if it’s the last time he ever sees Tony again, he wants to do this. It might be for selfish reasons, but he doesn’t care. He wants this.
“Probably should, though.”
“It’s loud,” Steve counters back.
With all Steve’s clothes packed up, he sits his bag by the elevator and turns to say his final goodbyes to Tony. He is surprised when Tony sort of tackles him, pressing him against the wall, and licks his way into Steve’s mouth. Tony presses their bodies flush together, pulling only away when Steve moans into the kiss.
Steve nods, and when the door clicks shut behind Paul, he takes a deep, shuddering breath. He looks at the clock, glad to see this torture only lasted for forty-five minutes. He came faster than usual.
“You okay?” Tony asks, yawning.
Steve’s face falls. “I was going…to make you breakfast.”
Steve grins back, realizing this is the first time in a while that Tony has shown any real interest in being intimate. He’s gotten a couple blow jobs over the last week, but Tony didn’t want reciprocation. He just kept saying, “A blow job a day keeps the doctor away.” But now he’s letting Steve touch him back, and Steve thinks that maybe, maybe everything is going to be alright after all.
“Whatever happened to that check, anyway?” Tony asks.
Steve nods, and then approaches. Tony pecks him on the lips and then graciously accepts the bottle of water Steve has brought down for him.
“Still don’t know where the check is?” Tony asks.
“Alright. Well, come over when you’re ready tomorrow. I’ll let the guard shack to know to be expecting you. I may or may not be here. I have an event tomorrow.”
“Let’s go upstairs,” Steve says, and it’s more of a question. Does Tony have time for him today?
Steve hesitates, wondering how Tony would feel without the extra barrier between them, but he finally pushes that thought aside. He might have given up his former life for this chance with Tony, but it wasn’t long enough ago to have gotten the results of an STD panel back. He’s never contracted anything, but it’s not worth the risk to him.
“I have to go,” Steve eventually says. He grimaces when he gets his shirt over his head.
Tony just nods. “I’ve had plenty of stalkers, remember?”
“Thank you,” Steve says eventually, and he manages to let go of Tony and turn back to the last dish he was rinsing. When he’s done, he dries his hand on the towel Tony offers him and then they head into the living room together.
“I’m going to…take a shower,” he says. “Alone.”
They head back up the elevator together, wasting no time to head into the bathroom. Tony’s already stripped naked by the time Steve even has his shirt off, and he’s taken by surprise when Tony pulls him forward and kisses him deeply, running his hands under the waistband of Steve’s pajama pants.
“Is this why…you left that night?” Tony asks. “You were hurt?”
Steve steps out into the room and looks around, again hesitantly and he’s sure he looks ridiculous at this point.
Steve blinks, then he bites his lip. “Well, usually I look for extravagant billionaires to sell sculptures to,” he jokes.
“How would you feel if the only one I didn’t comment on was yours?”
Tony wipes his eyes as if trying to get dust out of them, but he finally nods. “I was worried sick about you,” he confesses. “You wouldn’t wake up for a long time.”
“Alright,” Steve says. “I’ve got what I need. I’ll work for a few more hours and then head home.”
Steve can’t keep the gentle smile off his face as he looks at Tony. He doesn’t know why he feels so content right now. He just does. And he likes the feeling.
“I’ll give you a reward if you make it on time,” Steve teases.
He was surprised to find that Tony had a few kinks, like the time they used the blindfold, or when he only wanted to be partially prepped before Steve thrust into him. Even more surprising was that Tony seemed interested in what Steve liked too. They were experimenting with topping and bottoming and what worked for each of them, and Steve found that he preferred to bottom, especially with Tony. The man was just a very generous lover.
He starts on Steve’s belt, not even hesitating before he reaches down and gives him a rough squeeze through his jeans.
Steve sighs. “Paul did it.”
Tony doesn’t respond, just stares back at Steve as he finishes drawing the eyes. They look at each other for another moment after he’s done until Steve clears his throat. “All finished,” he says, turning the sketchpad around so Tony can see. Tony inspects it before nodding his approval.
They’re about ten minutes from the tower when Steve’s phone rings, and he has to look at it for several seconds because it’s the first time someone besides Tony has called him in a while.
watch a movie?” Tony says seductively.
“Of course I do.”
“Good morning, beautiful,” Tony says, lazily kissing Steve’s neck.
Steve gets in and drives off, trying to keep a level head. The drive home seems to take hours. He didn’t really want to leave Tony’s place, so the further he gets from it, the worse his mood becomes. It’s almost frightening the way that just being in Tony’s presence made Steve feel…safe and cared for. Now that he left, the feeling is gone.
“It’ll dry in twenty-four hours,” Steve says, “then I’ll come back and apply the second coat, and then paint it.”
Steve doesn’t message back, since he’s driving, but he’s glad he’ll have a couple hours to get started on delicate carving before Tony comes back. He wants to prove that he can sculpt after all, that Tony isn’t wasting his time or money.
“Go back to sleep, Steve,” Tony says.
FOURTEEN
“My house,” Tony says. “You could use the whole two weeks and sculpt the thing right in the spot it’s going.”
Steve gulps as he looks at the messages one more time, wishing he’d stayed awake to get the first response back last night. He knew Paul would be angry, but he didn’t know it would turn into something sinister. The messages started out with, “You can’t just dump me like this!” and had progressed to “Is there someone else, who is it? Tell me who it is!” And when he’d gotten no response, Paul had taken things up a step: “You think you’re something special? I can find anybody to do what you do. You’re nothing but a slut,” and the fourth message, “If I find out who you’re with, I’m going to destroy their life!” which led up to the final, “I’m going to kill you” message.
“Boyfriend does sound so trivial,” Tony nods. “What about manfriends?” Steve rolls his eyes. “But for the sake of society, and if you want to be, then, I’d say we could call ourselves boyfriends.”
“What?”
Steve lets him for a second, but he pulls away abruptly.
Tony’s hands reach back down to the wrap around Steve’s ribs. “Can I take this off?” he asks.
But Steve finally gets over himself and returns to what he was doing, putting his hand back between the legs and steadying it as he carves a long stroke down to form the outer pant leg. Every once in a while he’ll glance up at Tony who seems to be watching him intently, the look on his face undiscernible.
“Steve,” Tony says. “You doing alright in there?”
It’s morning when Steve wakes up again, and he’s quite aware of where he is. He’s surprised to find that Tony is still wrapped around him, a leg draped over his stomach and his arm wrapped around his shoulders. Steve grins a bit and doesn’t move, even though his bladder protests it.
“Nah. It’s not heavy.”
“I didn’t know if you’d still be here.”
Tony nods, and Steve gets in the elevator, trying not to meet Tony’s eyes as the doors slide shut. He lets out a long sigh.
He stares at it for a long time, trying to decipher the words. He’s not sure if Tony is planning to feed him, or if he wants to know what does the average American eat for breakfast. He stares at the words until they go blurry and then realizes that he’s hesitated too long.
“It’s probably in the trash somewhere. Hopefully some homeless guy finds it and has himself a good laugh too.”
“I see you’re giving me an appropriately sized package,” Tony comments.
“Not really. I figured I’d worry about it when I had to.”
After twisting slightly, and ignoring the pain that has crept back up into his body, Steve can get a better look at Tony’s face. He looks peaceful, but the worry lines have etched into his forehead. He looks as if he’s had a very long night and falling asleep next to Steve is some sort of reward for a day’s hard work.
EIGHT
Steve nods, but when the detective closes the door behind him he realizes, suddenly, that he’s not quite sure what really happened. Everything unfolded so fast, and Steve was in shock.
“No,” he says back. “I lost track of time. Make yourself at home; I’ll be back in a minute.”
“But I like this better. Nobody’s ever successfully made me sit still this long.”
The thought is enough to tighten his stomach muscles, and he can’t help it when he comes unexpectedly. Tony leans forward to lap up some of the come that ended up on Steve’s chest, thrusting through his own orgasm until both of them are a sticky mess.
And for Steve, that was okay. The less they knew about each other’s pasts, the less questions that might have to have difficult backstories for answers. He likes that they’re building this new relationship just set in the present. They’re both moving forward from the point they met, and that’s all there is to it. He just hopes that it doesn’t become a problem one day, how little they actually know about each other.
Tony answers on the first ring. “Less than an hour apart, record time,” Tony says, his voice grinning.
Tony’s face goes from confused to angry to unreadable in a matter of milliseconds. “You don’t remember the accident?” he asks carefully.
Steve sighs. “I can’t,” he says.
Tony rolls his eyes. “After 90 days, they’ll void the check for not cashing it and then send another one. So you have about 90 days to figure out what you’re going to do with it.”
Eventually Tony looks up and catches Steve staring at him. He smiles back and shifts up just slightly so he can press their lips together.
“I’d like that,” Steve nods.
“Yes.”
“These are perfect, Steve! I love how you turned this scene into something happy. I think the kids will love it, too.”
you, not because of you,” Tony says back. “I told you I wouldn’t let anyone hurt you. I meant that! I wish you’d have came to me with this sooner. We could have gotten it taken care of right away. Is that why you’ve been so distant? You’re worried about this guy coming back?”
“You get any work done?”
“I’m going to come,” Tony says, breaking Steve’s train of thought. Tony’s body tenses up, his eyes shut tight, and he comes in long, hot spurts over Steve’s hand and onto his own chest. It only takes a few more pumps from Steve before he’s coming too, shuddering at the feeling, and grunting as he rides out his orgasm.
By the time Steve is done analyzing at his own work, he realizes that there are more people entering the gallery. It’s a few minutes before dark and the buzz of conversation has increased. He walks back to the front and sees that many of the artists have arrived and they are chatting with patrons about their pieces, or laughing with other local artists just to pass the time.
“I missed you, Steve. I liked our chats. I got used to having you around.”
The hand that grips Steve’s dick is painfully tight, pumping him roughly like this is some game of tug-of-war. He wishes he could just cum already so it could be over, so this guy will just drop him the crisp hundred dollar bills on the nightstand and go on his way.
“Steve, Steve!” Tony yells, but Steve ignores him, continues to punch until he sees red blood on his knuckles. Not his blood this time. Paul’s blood.
Steve stares at him, his mouth agape. Why is Tony being so nonchalant?
“I can send a maid service.”
Steve stops drawing mid-way up the arm that Tony had draped across his forehead and forces himself to get up. He walks around for a minute, just trying to ignore how painfully hard he is. He thinks about taking a cold shower, but honestly, Steve doubts it’s going to help. The only way to fix that particular problem is to do something about it.
Tony nods. “We’ll come later,” he agrees.
Tony moves over so he can sit behind Steve and slowly works his hands over the shoulder muscle. He massages it until it relaxes under his touch and Steve pushes back against his hands.
“I don’t have to go,” Tony insists.
It feels weird having to do so, but Steve puts “Stark Tower” into his GPS and sits the phone in the seat next to him. He’s seen Stark Tower in the distance, but never been closer enough to actually know where to park or how to get in. He’s actually kind of nervous about going there. Just the stress of driving through the city and somehow having to explain to a guard at the tower that he’s there to see Tony, on invitation of Tony Stark himself, without sounding like a crazy stalker.
He’s about to stick his foot into the water when his phone buzzes and he takes a look, smiling when he realizes it’s from Tony. “10/4 Master Sculptor. Supplies will be delivered by 8am.”
Tony reaches up with his hand and cups Steve’s cheek. They stare at each other, the feelings between them being too much to say out loud.
Steve pulled Tony close by the wrist and kissed his head. “I know. It’s okay. I have you. It’s okay to cry.”
“Violet!” Peter yelled and ran over hugging her tight. “I missed you so much!”
Luna flicked her wrist and sent Steve back into the door. She flinched and dropped the wand grabbing at her ears. “What was that?! Did I break something?!”
The prisoner looked up from his legs and at her with his green eyes. “Thank goodness I was so worried about you,” he whispered.
Tony went downstairs and looked around. When he didn’t see Steve or any of the others he started to have a panic attack. “Steve?!” Tony ran into every room on the first floor yelling out each of their names.
“I swear on Nat’s life.” Bruce smiled and got up. “I will start everything.”
“Leave her alone,” Bucky hissed at Lois and pulled Luna into his embrace with his metal arm. “She doesn’t need this today. As one of her legal guardians, I say bug off.”
“Of course, we can do it here or we can go back in the lab,” Bruce told them and stood up from the couch. “If you want to do it here I’ll get Jarvis to project the images.”
Violet skipped over and took his two fingers into her hand. “Yes, Papa.”
Tony snatched the phone from Clint and got up walking to the elevator. “Are they out? What are they doing? Did you call Steve?”
Peter walked over from and back and kneeled in front of her taking both of her hands into his. Kissing each of her fingertips.
“O-okay…” Peter told him quietly and got transferred into Steve’s arms.
Steve looked at him. “There is no other choice than to raise them. They need us, Tony. More than anything in the world. I want this. Don’t you?”
“Love you too, Peter.” They said in unison and kissed his head.
The two girls held hands as they walked down the stairs and into the crowd. Pepper was able to spot the two men in the crowd. They walked slowly through the crowd with Happy behind them not too far, but close enough if something was to happen he could step in.
"That's a month and two weeks! Learn to count, Clint!"
“Let him go to school learning how to use magic. He will need it for her future or he won’t be able to control his magic. If he can’t control it he will end up killing someone.”
“She needs it!” Tony yelled and sighed. “She is a danger to us. What if she thought about us dying. Then we would be dead! We need her sedated.”
“Bye, kids! Have a good birthday at school! Did we forget something?” Steve asked looking at his husband.
Four big German Shepherd dogs stood around the children and barked at everyone around them. The press and reporters started backing away.
“Don’t hurt him,” Luna whispered and closed her eyes even though she couldn’t see him.
Tony kneeled next to her grunting and pulled her close. “It’s okay to cry over this. You lost both of your arms.”
Steve wrapped an arm around her. He was still sobbing quietly. “It’s okay. We all deal with everything in our own way.”
Stopping in there tracks they watched the god fly off with his hammer destroying a big flying lizard monster. “Holy fucking shit!” Peter yelled and looked at the sky seeing twenty more flying around. Looking up he saw the wormhole.
Tony nodded and kept looking at the tiled floor. He was numb from the fight in New York. “What are we doing? Fighting and saving the world? I couldn’t even save my kids. They were supposed to be safe in the tower. They are only ten… they shouldn’t live like this.”
The two left the tower hand in hand. Luna hated going to the eye doctors because every time they went they kept telling her she was getting blinder. She didn’t like that they were Debbie-Downers. They expect her to be blind by nine with how fast her eyesight keeps going, but she’s now turning twelve with 2% of her sight left. It was the same this appointment as well.
“I was not! Stop being a dick, Tony! Why do you want to affect the team, Tony? Do you want us to fail? Do you want to quit the Avengers?” Steve left in the middle of the fight to tell Bucky goodbye. Bucky broke up with him two weeks ago.
“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit your foot with the cane. Or the person behind me. I’m sorry. Please just let me walk past…”
Fifty-seven-year-old Violet stood at the top of the stairs in a ghost state, she was there, but glowing blue. Just hearing there voices she could cry. Slowly she walked down the stairs gripping the rail to make sure that this was real. When she reached the bottom of the stairs everyone looked over.
“Violet, hi… hello… how are you? What’s going on?” Steve started but didn’t know what to say. “Your safe now. I promise you are.”
“Luna… it’s gonna grow inside you. Your gonna get, excuse me for saying this, bigger. Your growing a human inside you. Your gonna show at some point.”
“Луна,” Natasha whispered and took the girl from Bucky. “Your aunt has you. Bucky go get back to the fight. Bruce and I have her.”
“Okay. Thank you.” He took the letter and sighed. “See you again.”
Tony and the other Avengers started to laugh while Steve sat there pouting.
Six came around and Tony was sitting there pacing the room. When Peter came in with Rhodey and May he felt his heart skip a beat. “Baby boy!” He yelled and picked Peter up kissing his head. “I missed you so much. I love you. I love you so much.”
The learning floor was where Steve and Tony taught the twins along with the tutors. When Peter got to the floor he walked back to the last door. He took a deep breath and opened the door to the art room.
Luna went down the rest of the stairs. “Sorry I thought I heard the dinner bell.” She lied through her teeth. “What do you think of my outfit?”
They kept kissing while walking up the stairs. While undressing one another until they reached the bedroom only in boxers each.
“Well, apparently my kid is a wizard,” Tony told him and crossed his arms.
Tony sat back tapping his chin watching everyone. He started tapping his foot sighing. “We could build a tower. Not just any tower. My big ass tower. Jarvis brings up blueprints for Stark Industries subsection 52J.”
Happy: “I know where you live if you don’t like her.”
“That sounds great.” Fury told him and sat back.
Tony flew Steve up to where the machine was spinning and kept firing out randomly since it wasn’t able to fire into the wormhole.
“Has he ever broken a light bulb with her screams or ever made something happen you can’t explain?”
Tony sat back and stared at the operating room door. “Steve hates himself and blames himself for letting us both go. He thinks one of us should quit the Avengers. I-I think it’s going to be me. Steve needs to be with you guys.”
The battle of New York caught everyone by surprise. Tony and Steve didn’t expect that Loki would take over the tower where the twins where. The twins at the time being only six years old. They also didn’t expect Loki to hurt the twins and threaten their lives against them. It was a bloodbath, but they won with many things lost. To the husbands, everything was a blur.
“I texted Happy and he doesn’t know it. Peter is gonna try and hack it,” Bucky told them and leaned on the wall. “I feel bad hearing her cry.”
“Of course,” Tony told her and sat on the lid of the toilet. “I heard you were telling stories. Wanna share?”
“Okay, Luna. My baby girl.”
“I won’t be mad.” He cupped her cheeks guiding her face up to look at his.
Luna gripped Steve’s hand as the hologram of Tony reappeared as they started walking up the stairs. “Who gives this woman away to this man?”
She nodded at him and curled into him more. “The Force is with us today… he loves me, Papa. I swear on my life he does. I’ve been getting sick all month worrying about today. ”
I looked over at the teenager. His brown eyes staring into mine. His hair was sloppy just like dads use to be. Just looking at him I knew…
Slowly Tony walked off the plane gripping Sam’s arms not trusting his legs. Tony tripped over the last stair falling into Steve’s waiting arms.
“Violet M. Rogers-Stark. There is a dash between Rogers and Stark.” Violet told her and leaned into Thor closing her eyes a bit.
Tony came out with his Iron Man suit on. His armor was exactly printed on the suit. “How do I look? Stunning?”
Tony pushed the stroller and looked at Steve. “Hey, what’s going on?”
“Are you sure about this?” Steve asked Tony while fixing his #1 Dad tie that Peter made out of a web. “I don’t want the media to have any more of them.”
That’s when Sirius, Nymphadora, Mad-Eye Moody, Kingsley, and Professor Lupin showed up to the battle. Sirius battled with Harry while Nymphadora, Mad-Eye Moody and Kingsley, and Professor Lupin helped the ones at wand point escape to the main hall.
“As soon as we’re in the car I want you to drive me to McDonald’s or whoever is driving. I need food. Fatty food.”
Nat rocked the girl back and forth slowly. “I have you. And I won’t let go. Tony, can we still stay in the tower with her?”
“You doing okay?” Peter asked her and set a hand on top of hers.
“Daddy…” Peter smiled and hugged his arm from where he stood on the chair next to the bed.
“Hey! Language.” Steve told him and shook his head. “Why can’t you two find different words to say that those nasty ones?”
Steve let Rhodey take Tony down to the adult doctor. While he and Bucky went into the kid's recovery room. Steve felt like there was a weight on top of his chest, but he had to hide it from them.
Today was different though. It has been a month since Tony saw the twins. He was ready to win them back in court. He got up at 5:55 a.m. to get in the shower. He took a nice long hot shower to make sure everything on him was squeaky clean. When he got out the clock flashed 6:28 a.m. only three hours and two minutes until they would be in court together.
“Tony, she’s gonna be frozen at this age if she can’t remember anything,” Bruce told him and poured her more juice in the cup.
Luna skipped out in a purple dress with three layers of sparkles while holding her glasses in her hand. Tony had made the glasses that spoke to her when no one was around to tell her where everything was. The glasses are pink with butterfly wings going towards her hair. The left lens was cloudy blue and the other cloudy red.
“I love you too, Tony. I know you're in pain. You can let go. It’s okay, my love. I love you so much. Thank you for everything you have ever given us. I thank you for everything I am with you. You're the love of my life and I can’t think of anyone else I will ever love. Luna and I will always be here to remember you. I love you and can’t wait to marry you again in our next life.”
A red-head women came into the room smiling slightly. “Sorry to interrupt, but I’m Jessica, manager of this adoption agency. Before I get her… I need you both to know something before we move things along.”
Gale walked in holding Luna on her hip. “Gentlemen this is Luna. Luna this is Tony and Steve. They wanna play with you today. Don’t worry about her being shy. I promise she will warm up to you both,” Gale handed Steve the little girl and walked out of the room leaving them to play.
“They're excited to be accepted as the heroes they are meant to be,” Happy told her and rubbed the girl's hand. He had become her bodyguard after the battle in Times Square by her school.
“I would think suit. Let’s get dressed and maybe some sexy time.” Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and ran to the bedroom dragging him behind.
She walked over to them slowly and sat down on the sand. “Papa, I’m sorry I left…” she leaned into him.
“When we were told to pack are bags. My mind kept telling me that the lady was weird. So, I thought about us switching. I went to the man and Peter went to the lady. I protected him at all cost. When I was at the man's house I knew that he wanted to turn into a Hydra dummy. So, I thought about shooting myself, but I did something better. I thought about making my head stop thinking new thoughts. It stopped me remembering everything after that. I don’t have my powers. I still have the serum though. I lost everything.” She dropped the plastic cup into the water while crying. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m useless. D-don’t hurt me!”
“We’re gonna go to Britain. They're gonna teach you, magic sweetheart. It’ll be great. You can see us anytime. We’ll leave in the morning to get your stuff,” Tony told her and rubbed her cheek. “After a week of you sleeping, I’m glad to see your beautiful grey eyes.”
Peter looked around and closed his eyes then looked at Fury interrupting him, “Excuse me, sir…  I am so sorry to interrupt, but we need to get out of here. The structure is starting to give out. I mean there was a monster that was above the hall, we should have realized it would do damage.”
Luna slowly woke up in her bed at the compound. She liked that her dad was sleeping next to her just like she did when she was first brought home. Curling into his side, he wrapped his arm around her smiling.
“Miss, can you hear us?” Steve asked and took down another soldier with just a punch.”
“That doesn’t mean anything. I’m just glad you are here today. Thank you for making sure you were going to be home for my birthday.” Luna whispered into his neck. “Best present ever.”
Both of the boys walked back into the house into the open concept where the living room led to the kitchen. Tony was on the couch watching the live concert of AC/DC since he wasn’t able to go with Steve.
Steve smiles and followed behind them. “Nice to meet you, Gale. I can’t wait to see her. I’m so excited. Can you tell us about her?”
Shaking her head no a few times she took deep breaths. “N-no… can’t see me...” she gasped out and closed her eyes. “Jarvis is this Pops truly right in front of me?”
Tony just rubbed her back and smiled. “Everyone will be here soon. Go get dressed, sweetheart.”
“The first week I met you we watched all of the Gilmore Girl series. All 153 of them. That’s a lot. During that time Luke kept fighting for Lorelai. I thought about how that was going to be me one day. I don’t remember every little detail with them, but I do remember what Luke said. “This thing we’re doing here, You, me. I’m in. I am all in.” I want to wake up next to you every single day. Love you and hold you. Promise me, Luna.”
All Tony could do was watch him cry. He didn’t know what to think or expect. His children were harmed. “Hey… it’ll be okay. I promise.”
“Were good,” Pepper told them and gripped the girl hand tighter.
“Because there was nothing else I could say! Nothing I could do to make your stay! Someone had to keep things going! I couldn’t do it knowing that I was going back to fix everything! Like I swore to you. To make the timeline right!”
Tony sighed. “I said I can’t wait to see everything with you. Do think you think that's what made her upset?”
After older Violet wiped there mind everything went to how it should have. Tony and Steve raised their children how they saw fit. It was Christmas Eve when Tony decided that he was going to take his family on the Polar Express. They had just finished reading the book to the kids and wanted to have them experience it themselves.
They had taken him to the park once, but Peter stood there and cried watching the other kids not knowing how to react to them. The husbands also realized that they couldn’t take him to school because he didn’t know how to control his powers. They didn’t know how to help their son grow up without using his powers in public.
“Everyone this is Loo- Luna Stark-Rogers. This is Harry, Ron, Neville and I’m Hermione,” Hermione told them.
“No. You have to come. We need to give you upgrades on that thing in your head. We also need to give you better arms. You can’t run a technology company with those low function arms.” Tony snapped. “And we all swore that family came first when you two took over.”
“Violet Maria Rogers-Stark. She gave me the same name knowing that it would be the names my fathers gave me.”
Clint offered his idea. “We can be in the country.”
Tony looked at them. “No way you two are doing that. Understand, me rookies?”
“Luna doesn’t know why she really here right?” Ned asked quietly making sure no one else heard.
“Yeah. We can take her back to the tower with us. We have the spare car seat in the back.” Steve smiled and held his arms out.
“Luna?” Wanda walked up to her slowly putting a hand on top of hers. “How are you doing? It’s been a week since… yeah. D-Do you want to go to the funeral? It’s today… for both of them.”
“It’s moving to fast and heading towards New York. I’ve tried everything,” Steve whispered. “Your father and I will be waiting for you to join us. I’m glad you were our daughter. Luna, this is my choice. If I end up making it out of here we are getting ice cream for dinner for a month. I love you, my perfect angel.”
“Thanksgiving comes first.” Steve told her and sighed. “Unless your not coming.”
“I am not here to battle. I am here to inform you about Mr. Lovegood.”
“No. Where’s my shield?” Steve started sweating bullets and grabbed his hair. “Bucky… where’s Red Skull? Peggy?”
“She didn’t make it, Луна. I’m so sorry. She died.” Natasha whispered and held the girl closer while Bruce gave her a sedative. It was clear to everyone who could see that she had a dent in her head from where she fell.
I wrapped my arms around him tightly and started to tear up. “I love you, Peter Joseph Rogers-Stark. Know that forever and always I love you. Even when we are apart.”
Tony reached in and grabbed the cube throwing it to the side then blasted off.
“Yes, I do. I understand.”
“Fine.” Steve walked to the car and changed the twins sitting them in there car seat after each of them were clean.
“You're famous. Why wouldn’t it be happening?” Bucky asked him and hiccuped. He drank more than anyone else.
“She deserves to be changed in privet! She’s a young lady! And deserves to be treated as such.”
“The twins will go home with there caretakers to collect their things and will be brought back here by six tonight to be placed back in Anthony’s care. If there is anything that Anthony and Steven would like to bring up now before we are dismissed on this matter they may.”
That made things even better. If the man watching him didn’t know what anything was then Tony could build anything he wanted. What he wanted was armor. After ten days of programming and, twenty-eight days of building Tony made a suit that would fit him inside.
“If you're sure. I’m Luna. What’s your name?”
“We will talk about this now. Solve this now.” Steve told them and grabbed them both by the ear and went into the stairwell. “What the hell is wrong with you two fighting in front of everyone?”
“Good morning California!” Tony yelled as he flew in. “How is everyone today?”
“Okay, m-master.” Violet took hold of her hair and ripped a good chunk out of the back of her head. “Here, master.”
“Your having nightmares again?” Bucky asked and sat down in the chair next to him.
When the song died down Luna put the ice cream away and sighed sitting on the floor. She leaned over and began to cry while Skinny Love began playing on the speakers. I didn’t want you to leave to make me smile. “Dad!” she screamed hitting the fridge while sinking down on to the floor crying into her hands.
… I was going to marry him.
“Peter, it’s okay. Come on,” The child protective agent Jen told him.
“I’m not a strange to the dark…” She hummed along with the words unpacking her book bag. “Hideaway they say ‘cause we don’t want your broken hearts… I’ve learned to be ashamed of all my scars! Run away! They say! Because no one will love you as you are!”
Natasha laid her hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t panic. Come see her with me. I know you wanted to see her tomorrow, but she’s leaving on her honeymoon tomorrow. Give her time to talk to you now and ask her the important questions.”
Violet walked off down the stairs. She knew that she made a good decision all those years ago when she gave up Gilbert and Abigail for Peter and his future. He deserved his happiness even if it means she gave up hers.
Peter squealed and walked over to Violet and patted her arms. “V!”
They walked out to the middle of the dance floor and danced slowly to the song ‘Little Do You Know’,
Violet followed staying quit griping Peter’s hand tight. Tony and Steve followed them down the elevator. Peter kept sobbing.
“Who’s V.M.R-S?” Tony asked him looking at the letter himself. “How can we trust that this chick really is from 2061?”
The drive was quiet. Everyone to her was familiar. Like she knew how this was going to go… oh yeah. She did. She was upset and felt alone, but it was helping her move on. The last time she spoke she blamed her family for not going to help him at the school. Since then she hasn’t spoken.
She nodded and gripped her cane close to her chest. Pulling her knees close to her chest she began to tremble. The pain of the world falling down around her made her start to panic. Luna started breathing heavy. A panic attack taking control.
Steve blushed and looked away. “I knew we weren’t alone…”
“What’s the plan when we get there?” Bruce asked and rubbed his wrist.
Luna tightened her grip on her cane. “I will next week…”
“Alright. I’ll go get- never mind their he is out of the castle. Good thing I didn’t have to climb up your hair.” He grinned and walked over kissing his cheek. “Let’s eat Rapunzel.”
“Amazing. I would have thought it was store-bought,” Tony told her and set a hand on her shoulder. “So proud of you, kiddo.”
“We can’t believe we are here. We have our own land, well world. Fun rides and everything. All of us have ridden every single ride at least four times,” Rhodey smiled.
“At least we saved the city and got to meet the rest of the Avengers. This was the coolest thing I have ever done.” Peter smiled and looked at everyone else in the van. “Are we going to jail?”
“I want us to be. I really want us to be!” Steve told him and held his hands out to the boy. “Come here kiddo.”
Violet waited for Steve to leave and looked up at Thor who was twiddling his thumbs. “Thor, wanna do something crazy?”
“She’s got a bit of a jump in brain waves. It keeps going from delta waves to gamma waves. It’s crazy to think she is jumping around like that.”  Bruce told him and kept checking the machines. He fixed the IV in her leg. “I don’t know what state she will be in when she wakes up. I know these bruises and the burns she has is going to sting.”
“Thank you.” Steve sat back down watching the doors waiting.
The man looked over and saw the girl in front of the counter. “Hello there, I’m Garrick. Owner of this fine wand shop. What’s your name?”
“Running with Sam and Rhodey around the hospital. He couldn’t sit here waiting. It’s probably better this way.” Tony told him and looked at the hospital logo on the wall. “Go home to your kids, Clint. I’m fine. I need coffee.”
“This is a baby store? How do you not expect men trying to change there children's diaper?”
“In America. New York to be exact. You have a very concern husband waiting for you.” Sam held Tony up by the arm as they walked out of the plane.
“There is nothing to be sorry about, Violet,” Tony whispered in her ear then spoke out loud. “Why don’t you sit here and I am just going to take a piece of your hair. Okay?”
“I’m sorry, but I have twenty meetings in the next two weeks. I have to figure out where we are getting 15 million from. Dad already offered 300 thousand dollars to ten schools around the countries. So thank you for digging my hole bigger, daddy.” Violet told him.
“Then one of us would be your brother. That's a bit weird,” Steve told her.
Peter carried her down the stairs out on to the streets and ran to the nearest medic. “Someone, please help her!”
“She’ll be fine, kid.” Dr. Strange spoke. “I already looking into the future. There are only 35,394 chances that she falls to her death.”
“Thank you,” Tony held the scorched Ferby looking at it carefully. He walked back to the room and found Steve playing with her and the other doll in the room. He walked close enough for her to see and spoke. “Look what I have.”
“Swear, you no do it again!”
As soon as Bucky said three the little girl ran and jumped as soon as she felt the stair. She was screaming louder than anything around them.
“Get off the stage. We can’t have an embarrassment on the stage where greatness is supposed to happen.” Dr. Yang told her and rolled his eyes. “Leave this place where you can’t stand.”
“Tony, give her the Ferby, please. I just want her happy. Are friends and family will be here soon. Especially our new co-workers.” Steve hissed at him.
Rhodey knew it was going to happen at some point: “I bet Tony and Steve would say yes.”
“Magic…” Peter spoke and broke out laughing. “Did you really think you could hold all of us and we wouldn’t think of a plan?.”
They talked via telepathy for a while, and then the telepath wheeled over to where the Infinity was chatting and joking with the group gathered around him and struck up a conversation verbally with him. CW was funny and charming, a little smug, and enjoyed making jokes that made people uncomfortable. Vladimir was polite and civil. He still let out an indignant yelp when Work tripped him into his lap, which pulled a laugh from the entire group. Tony sauntered over and let a little possessiveness of Steve show before inviting Vlad and both Charles’ to his typical informal afterparty.

Next chap is gonna just  be two characters bonding. Kudos to whoever can guess who. (Pls let me kno who you think it is, I wanna know what you think.)
Osborn was still a dick and Tony still couldn’t stand him(his plus one wasn’t much better, a pretty face but an ugly voice and even uglier personality). Masters, however, was actually significantly nicer than he'd been last time they’d interacted, and Tony suspected that his change in demeanor was caused by his plus one, his boyfriend he'd just recently gone public with. Masters’ plus one, a man named Charles Work, had his long white hair in a braid down his shoulder, his exciting toxic green eyes watched intently as he listened, he wore a deep purple suit, had more watches on his arms than anyone could feasibly need and a pocket watch (the only one accurate in this timezone, Tony asked), he sat in a fully customized clock themed/steampunk wheelchair in which he would randomly roll away and come up behind Masters and make him fall backwards into his lap (the man didn’t have legs below his knees), he was incredibly sarcastic and had a truly wicked sense of humor, and, most notably, a long jagged scar over his left eye.

gotten some kind of “not normal” vibe when he was talking to Charlie and Masters earlier, but he’d figured it was coming from Vlad. He pursed his lips. “I’ll invite Vlad and Charlie to the after party. I wanna ask Charlie’s vampire of a boyfriend a few questions, anyways.”
“Because,” Dr. strange said eyes still fixed on Charles Work as the man talked with Steve (Tony wasn’t jealous. He wasn’t. Okay, maybe a little.) about World War 2, getting a first hand account on what happened, “That’s him. Right there, in the steampunk wheelchair.”
fought Strange, and stole the Time Stone, claiming it was theirs in the first place. Strange had described the thief as a blue-skinned ghost in a deep purple cloak and tunic with black gloves, blank red eyes, more watches up its arms than anyone (living or dead) would need, a pocket watch dangling from its belt, a blue spectral tail in place of legs (

“You heard me.” Strange’s eyes remained fixed on Charles (or Charlie as Tony called him) as he spoke, even as Charles Xavier rolled up to the little group of Avengers that had gathered around Charlie (who had tripped Masters into his lap again) and struck up a conversation with the other Charles (Tony valiantly resisted the urge to make a joke), “It’s him. It’s the exact same scar, on the exact same face, and if you look closely when he laughs or smiles you can see his canines are fangs!”
are you?” Dr. Strange forced confidence into his voice as the specter stared for a few moments longer, before it seemed to shake itself out of its stupor and began speaking in a level voice.
Tony shrugs. “What does anybody do at a gay bar on a Wednesday night?”
Steve rubs his forehead. “I don’t want you to have to protect me. This is my fault. I shouldn’t be your problem.”
“Yeah.”
“God your mouth feels so good,” Tony gasps, his hands coming to rest in Steve’s hair. He gently guides him where he wants to go. Steve just cooperates. He licks Tony’s slit and lets his tongue run over the underside of Tony’s cock. He takes him deep, swallows around him, all the while taking glances up to see Tony’s reactions.
Things could have been a lot worse than they were. Steve could have died, and that thought scares Tony. They’ve only been together for, officially, a few weeks, but Tony likes the way things are going. He’s already planning how he can arrange his space, how he can make room for Steve so they can be together all the time. He doesn’t even know if that’s something Steve wants, but Tony is willing to give long-term a try. And that’s a first for him.
Steve sighs. “I don’t need to be protected.”
“No,” Steve says. “Don’t watch a lot of TV at home.”
“I get to see you twice in one day?” Tony plays coyly.
“You going to fuck me or what?” Tony demands, his smile evil.
“You don’t have to comment on all of them.”
“I didn’t notice,” Tony shrugs, downing the remainder of his glass and raising his hand for another one. “I wanted to talk to you about the sculpture thing,” he goes on. “I need a sculpture of me in two weeks. Can you do it?”
“Did you call the police?”
He starts with drawing a body shape onto the wood, and then has to redraw it because it doesn’t look quite right, too small for Tony’s form. He draws it twice more before sighing and taking a step back. One wrong cut and the whole thing will be wrong from the start. He needs to measure Tony. He should have done it earlier.
“A picture would last longer,” Tony murmurs after a while.
“Missed you,” he finally says.
It probably takes ten minutes, but eventually Steve pushes himself back from Tony and wipes his face on the sleeve of his suit. Tony raises his thumbs to wipe away anything else that lingers, and the two of them look at each other for a moment.
“It will be if you kill Tony,” Steve says. “So far you haven’t hurt anybody, right? We can just pretend this never happened. You can go home.”
It’s still pretty early in the evening, too early for any actual sleeping, but they lay down together and just breathe each other in. Steve uses his newly freed arm to wrap around Tony, pulling him closer, hoping it’ll keep him there for as long as possible.
“So how does this work, anyway, Steve?” Tony asks. “A guy just comes in the bar, offers to buy you a drink, and then what?”
“What?”
When Steve makes it out to his car, he sends a quick, “I’m on the way” text to Tony to he knows to expect him before driving off. He doesn’t get a response back, which he’s okay with, but he wishes he knew what was going on. He probably feels now how Tony felt when Steve just left him the other night.
Paul will have broken in again, maybe burned the place down, maybe still be inside waiting.
“Hi,” Steve breathes back.
“What’s this?” he asks.
okay?”
“After five,” he finally says. “But I can work through the night if you’re okay with that.”
“Why?” their chaperone asked. “What do you like about the happy girl?”
When Tony comes home, he’s got a single blue violet between his fingers. His eyes are grinning as much as his lips are, and Steve just stands there, staring at Tony, wondering how he could ever love anybody the way he loves Tony. Tony just smiles back, kisses him, and wraps his arms tightly around Steve’s body.
this thing with you.”
“What do you eat in the morning?”
“Are you alright?” Tony demands. “What’s wrong? Tell me what’s wrong.”
When they’re finally dressed and ready, it’s nearing six.
The drive home takes about twenty minutes, but when he finally pulls up and heads inside, kicking off his shoes at the door, he goes straight bed. He’s not tired, but his body is exhausted. Every Monday is just like this. He meets Paul and then his entire being is emotionally and physically drained, but his brain is wide awake.
“Does it hurt?”
“Easy, really. I am a technical genius, by the way. I could probably find you anywhere on this whole planet and not lose a second of sleep.”
“Everything okay?”
“Hello?” Steve calls into the apartment. “I’m coming in, if you’re still in here!”
Tony reaches forward and lowers Steve’s boxers, letting his leaking erection spring free from the confine. He leans down, using his tongue to lick the slit, and Steve throws his head back from the pleasure. He groans, trying to keep his moans quiet but not being successful.
“No.”
He quickly averts his eyes to the floor, trying not to get caught watching. It must have worked because when he looks up again, Tony has moved through the crowd and is walking away from him. He sighs in relief, even though he’s not sure why he was worried to begin with, and then takes a few uncertain steps before he decides to follow behind Tony. He wants to hear the man’s comments on the artwork. Maybe he just wants to hear him talk. He isn’t sure.
When Tony gets in, he instantly connects his hand with Steve’s and brings it to his lips briefly. They don’t talk the whole ride back to Tony’s place. They just sit in silence, and Steve sees Tony scanning every intersection looking for danger.
Usually Tuesdays are cleaning days and he’d spend the whole day just scrubbing his apartment spotless. But this Tuesday he has plans later and he needs to start preparing. He was invited by a friend of a friend to an art show that doubled as a charity event for the rich and famous. He was assured that there would be plenty of people interested in his art, and even if they weren’t it would be good networking. He was promised a small space in the very back of the studio, right beside the toilets, to show a sample of his work.
Tony grins. “I could be a metalworking artist. Can’t be too hard, right?”
“What do I look like?” Steve asks.
When they make it back to the 51
“He’s been moved to an overnight holding cell,” Blakely says.
“Mr. Swanson wanted to press charges against you for breaking his nose. We told him he could not, as this happened during the break in and you have a right to defend yourself. We have security footage from Mr. Stark corroborating the events as you have stated, so from my point of view, you have nothing to worry about, Steve. As for Mr. Swanson, he’s being charged with breaking and entering, obtaining an unlicensed weapon with intent to kill, making terroristic threats against Mr. Stark, among other things. He will spend quite a long time behind bars, Steve. You can bet Mr. Stark’s lawyers will see to that.”
Steve sighs, and for once, he forces his mind to go blank. He doesn’t want to overthink things. He just wants to stay right here, pressed against Tony, forever.
It was an excuse, but it wasn’t a lie, either. Steve has been invited to another art show, and he had a piece he’d been working on for a while that he wanted to display. He needed the night to finish it. He needed the silence of his own house with no distractions so he could get the thing done and prepared for the show.
“You really get into your work, don’t you?” Tony surmises.
“I have not yet seen one sign of a creepy sex den.”
“It wasn’t even good work!” Steve groans back. “It wasn’t even worth a hundred dollars, let alone a million!”
Tony hesitates, but finally just signs. “Yes, I guess we should both get this over with. The sooner you finish, the sooner you’ll be back over here.”
“We should go,” Steve finally groans.
Steve just plans to nod, but for some reason his mouth says, “What sort of project did you have commissioned?”
Steve is confused for a moment, but when the elevator opens and Tony leads him into what appears to be a ballroom, he becomes increasingly nervous. He is an artist, and he is confident in his work, but he’s suddenly doubting his ability to
Tony sighs. “I didn’t. I’m fine. I’m right here.”
“Tell me what you want,” Tony says. “I want you to fuck me. You want to?”
Eventually, though, he manages to roll to the side and rests his head against Steve’s strong shoulder. They don’t talk for a while; they just lie there together, chests moving up and down.
When he’s actually standing on his feet, the pain seems a to lessen a bit. He staggers as he tries to take a step, and he doesn’t miss the way Tony’s hands reach out to steady him, but at the very last moment Tony pulls back. He wants Steve to know he can do this on his own.
“But you didn’t come.”
Steve bites his lip, but he smiles when he sees Tony glance down at it, and feels him becoming hard just from the sight of something so simple.
When they’re finished eating, they clean the dishes together even though Tony grumbles playfully about it. Eventually, they end up on the couch together. Steve sits on his side and lets Tony slide in front of him.
Tony shakes his head. “You got the worst of it, babe. A car came out of nowhere and pushed you into the intersection. Two oncoming cars smacked into you from there. Everyone is okay, though. It wasn’t your fault.”
“What’s for lunch?” Tony questions.
Tony pulls him in closer, wraps a leg around one of Steve’s. He dips in and kisses him, just a peck, but it sends shivers down Steve’s spine.
Steve moves forward, his brain taking control. He doesn’t see Ryan anymore. He sees Tony there, on all fours, begging to be fucked. Steve leans forward, grasps Ryan’s dick in his hand while he opens the cap of the lube with his other. He pumps his fist a few times and then coats his fingers with the lube. He slowly pushes one into Ryan, adding another, and finally a third. Ryan swoons on the bed, fucking himself backwards onto Steve’s fingers.
Steve finally opens his eyes and steps back, scratching his head and then looking at his feet.
“You’ve already said that.”
He probably stands under the water for an hour, and he’s not even showering. He’s just…standing there. When Tony knocks on the door gently, Steve wipes his face, as if somehow it’ll make it less noticeable that he’d cried until his head hurt.
“But we could have been real. We still can be!” Paul seems desperate suddenly, as if he just wants Steve to admit they had a relationship, that they could have been lovers.
Tony comes around and helps Steve to his feet, and they get in the elevator together, riding to the 51
Steve wipes his face, managing to get it more wet so Tony doesn’t notice the tear leaking onto his cheek. “I just feel so…overwhelmed by you,” Steve confesses.
Steve sighs in relief. He’s not quite sure why he was so afraid of having Tony involved, but now that it’s out in the open he feels like one of the weights on his chest has lifted.
“Alright,” Steve nods. “I’ll probably work until midnight and then head home.”
with me.”
“Good. I figure we can work out the details when you see the scope of the project.”
“My car?” he asks.
He eventually gets out of the tub and drains the cold water. He wraps a towel around his waist and heads over to his bed, not bothering to get dressed. He lays down on his back, arm over his forehead, and thinks about what he just did: Jacking off to the thought of Tony Stark, who as of tomorrow, will be his boss.
He keeps grinning even when he knows Tony can’t see him anymore and he goes back to drawing. He spends another hour just doodling before he gets up and checks the refrigerator for ingredients for lunch.
By the time he gets back to the sculpture, he’s blocked his mind. He won’t think about Tony until he’s finished for the night. Then he’ll go home, and maybe he’ll just fall asleep. Maybe he won’t. Either way, it’s not healthy to be thinking about the other man so often. It’s going to lead to nothing but lust and heartache.
“Nothing too crazy,” Tony promises. “Just a few questions about what happened.”
Steve laughs, but shakes his head. “I don’t want to fit in with them.”
“Don’t think too much,” Tony says back, pressing his cheek against Steve’s chest again.
But Steve isn’t giving in. He seems to know the phone call had to do with him, and he wants to know why.
“This is him. May I ask who’s calling?”
“No problem, kid,” Phil pauses, and then says, “I haven’t seen you around here lately. You doing something else?”
“I promised I’d get you to the meeting on time. I keep my promises.”
He was actually a little nervous now, wondering what people would think, or if they’d even notice his canvases in the back. But the experience was enough for him. Just being invited to a high-end event was enough. It was rare he got to enjoy himself, so he was going to make the most of the night.
“I got it.”
Steve’s cheeks burn red, but he rolls his eyes despite his embarrassment. He doesn’t ask about his appearance again, because he doesn’t want the heart monitor to read the way his heart jumps when Tony says sappy stuff like that. He may never stop, if he knows that Steve
“I disagree.”
“You think it will be?”
“You filed a report about two months ago about your apartment being broken into. At the time, you said you didn’t know who had done it.”
“I made sandwiches,” Tony says after a while. “Figured you could eat some lunch. Probably didn’t eat dinner yesterday.”
“I just want it to be over with, so I can move on.”
time.
“Um, yes,” Steve nods. “Just give me a second to…deal with this work thing.”
Tony’s phone rings and when he answers, he tells the pizza guy to bring it up to the 51
“Uh, hi,” Steve says, and suddenly, “Sorry about last night. I hadn’t planned to stay.”
Steve’s eyes widen a bit. “You do?”
“I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Steve nods, and Tony watches him slide out of the sling. Steve grimaces when he brings his arm out in front of him, stretching it for the first time.
“All I could think about was…how this was my fault. That you were going to die because of me.”
“I’ll give you a million right now. That enough?”
“Your car was hit on purpose,” Tony begins. “An unknown assailant went across three lanes of traffic and intentionally pushed you into oncoming traffic. The driver was in a black SUV, but traffic cameras lost track of it a few blocks up the road. I’m trying to track it down using my own software, but so far the police haven’t been very forthcoming with information.”
“Neither,” Steve laughs, though he’s not sure why. Neither are laughing matters. “Just an art show tonight.”
“You’re going to be old one day, Steve,” Tony insists. “I want to remember you as hot as you are now.”
Peter rolled his eyes. “If you could see your face you would disagree. Even though y-your still cute.”
“Papa!” Violet wiggled out of Bucky’s arms and sprinted down the hall into Steve’s arms crying. “We thought you no wanted us anymore!” She punched his shoulder the hardest she could (which was only a tap compared to what he’s gotten in the past). “We thought you want us to die alone!”
She danced along jumping up and down. “I want you to be happier!”
“It’s okay baby girl,” Steve kneeled and pulled them into a hug. “I am so sorry if we mistreated you or thought we didn’t love you just the same.”
Bruce put the arms on the girl without any problems, but would not for the life of her hold her head still for the headband. “No! No!”
“I know. He made a music video for the song,” She laughed and leaned into him more. “I’m glad I met you, and that I’m here today. Loving you. I wanna grow old with you. Watch our children and their children grow old. Maybe move back to the city. Buy back the tower… make it our home and keep the compound as a safe house. Give it to Charles Xavier for his academy. Make a mutant hospital. Do amazing things,”
Violet walked in slowly and climbed into the chair. “Good morning sir. When will Natasha and Bruce be back from the mission, sir?”
That caught the husbands attention. “Why not, baby girl?” Tony questioned.
“Shit.” Tony looked around. “Where’s his staff? If they each have enough power in them they will react and stop long enough for us to get that cube.”
Peter squealed and hugged his neck. “I love having fun with you guys!”
It took a week at Stark Tower for things to go back to ‘normal’ after the Christmas situation. Steve went to Peggy’s funeral and saw many of his older friends from when he was ‘younger’. Tony had Pepper call all of the reporters who had caught the kids using their powers along with everyone who was running a story on the family. He wanted to set things straight. He wanted his kids to be able to go outside without being called nasty words, but most of all he wanted his daughter to come out of her room decides when she ate and used the bathroom.
The family had to learn to adjust to missing a member. It took a while, but they learned to adjust. Though Tony has never stopped looking. He has Jarvis on the look for her everyday scanning everywhere in the country and not in the country.
Tony held his arm out for his soaked daughter. Luna ran to the bed and pulled her father into a tight hug. “Daddy, I was so scared I would lose you. Don’t ever leave us. We need you. I love you. I love you so much, dad.”
“How are you able to come back like this? And why don’t you have normal arms?” Bruce asked leaning forward.
“She’ll be fine. Let’s get down to where the medics are.” Tony stated and took a syringe and inserted it into her shoulder. “This will help with the falling, kiddo.”
“We are going to have it at four so then you guys can see everyone before your patrol if you're still up to it.” Steve parked the car and everyone got out going inside.
Steve grabbed Tony and pushed him back away from the two children. Clint and Nat stood ready to fight on each side of them. While Sam and Rhodey stood next to Peter behind his parents ready to do anything to protect the boy. Bucky was out in the hall listening to everything.
A voice yelled. “Freaks!”
She looked up at them and began to cry harder out of embarrassment. “Don't blame Thor! I just… I’m sorry…”
Tony held his hand back and stood to look up at the man. “Isn’t it funny were talking about kids and we’ve never had sex before.”
Even though Tony knew it was going to happen sooner rather than later he was going to slip up or something weird was going to happen to the Avengers. The same stupid shit that happens to them every day.
“I will call with the results. Thank you for coming all the way out here. I would have flown to you, but it was so last minute. Tony is getting dressed.”
Tony’s back slammed into the concrete wall with a whack. He just sat there and cried into his hands. “I need a drink. I need something so strong I will forget you ever existed.” He gasped and started to hold his chest. “I’m letting the courts decide. Fuck you!”
“I swear baby girl,” Steve kissed the top of her head again and smiled. “I have to go now. I wanted to make sure you were getting home safely. I’ll be back in a week hopefully. If something happens you know where everything is. Happy and Pepper will be here in the morning to watch you. Bruce is gonna make sure your fed tonight though.”
“Lu!” A familiar voice yelled from in front of her. She could hear the footsteps getting closer and closer to her. “Lu! It’s Bucky! Are you okay?”
“If I picture it I won’t be able to grab it. Peter, remember the first time this happened in Queens?” Violet asked and grinned.
Steve shook his head and walked with Violet in his arms. Walking back to the bathrooms he held Violet tight. “Shoot. There’s no baby changing table in the men's bathroom.” It was the first time Pepper had been without them in public. Pepper always went to change the twins so then they could get a moment to themselves.
The four of them sat in the back of the train by the kitchen, so no one could see them or identify them. They were singing the hot chocolate song when Steve’s phone started freaking out for the fourth time since they got on the train.
“Marry me as soon as we get everything okay again,” Tony told him and took the water from him. “Jarvis you okay, pal?”
“You want to adopt a baby? Where did this come from?” Steve asked him while he ate Steve’s homemade lemon chicken and potatoes.
“You need it, silly goose.” Bruce smiled and finally got her still enough to put the headband on he head.
“You five get back to the professor, now. Your families are waiting for you.” Dumbledore told them.
That’s all she had to say to get Thor to agree to help her sneak out of the hospital without Peter noticing. Thor flew them with his hammer in one hand and her in the other. He had the IV strapped to his back.
Steve kneeled holding her. “It’s alright.” He rubbed her back slowly. “Do you know where you are?”
“No. What movie are we watching?” Bruce asked and sat on the couch that could fit fifteen.
One the phone read her the text message she teared up. She sat on the bench leaning forward gripping her knees. “Great. Look how stupid I am!”
“No, I’m playing hide and seek with Vi.” Peter giggled. “She won’t find me down here, but I am looking for her.”
Violet made visual on her fathers with Rhodey and Sam, and Aunt Nat,  Aunt Wadna with Uncle Vision then looked seeing who else was fighting. The god Thor, Hawkeye, Dr. Strange and Ant-Man with his sidekick the Wasp.
“Send him in,” Tony told him and sat up slowly. I sat up looking at Tony keeping my head on shoulder. Slowly he put my glasses on my face while kissing my head.
“Isn’t that the truth. Where is the rest of our family?” Steve asked and set his coat on the rack next to the door.
Jarvis heard the conversation and started heading to the nearest grocery store not wanting to sit in the parking spot anymore.
“Lies!” Steve yelled and punched Tony. Tony closed his eyes and took it. He didn’t want his husband hitting him to be the end of their relationship.
“Take off the suit and who are you?!” Steve yelled at Tony.
- - - - - - -
“Violet, don’t wanna walk anymore. Can we sit down?” Peter begged his sister while dragging his feet.
“I’m fine. I promise it’s just a slight headache. I haven’t gotten sick nor have I lost feeling in anything.” Luna promised him and smiled.
“Luna, baby girl. I’m so sorry. There’s not going to be a safe landing. There are twenty bombs on this plane. I was able to get everyone off, but someone needs to land this bird into the water. I’m not going to make it to dinner tonight. I’m sorry.”
“Fine. I will,” Tony took a deep breath and then smiled with a big grin, “not tell you.”
“To the end of the line,” Sam, Tony, and Steve whispered putting their head down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jarvis where is Dad?” Luna asked putting her coat on the rack next to the elevator door entrance.
“You all look, great. Did you want a picture?” Vision asked holding his hand out for Tony’s phone.
“They sell bigger clothes for a reason. I’ll hide it. I have to hide it. Swear to me you’ll hide it.”
“I swear on my life I won’t die,” Steve told him and curled into Tony.
“That’s why I offered to fix it.”
“I miss you all. I wanna be home again. I want to be in the penthouse with you and Violet,” Peter cried into Tony’s shoulder.
“Yes. Papa had relations with ex-uncle Bucky and he broke the family. I wanna go home. No offense May! But I like my room better it has my legos.”
“Yes. I love school, but I miss our homeschool teachers. Mrs. Mavis is really smart, but Daddy teaches us science in his lab and Papa teaches us art, but not music since he can’t play anything decides the wake-up horn.” That got a laugh from everyone in the audience. “He said he learned that from being in the army.”
Bruce smiled at the couple sitting next to one another at the head of the table. It’s been ten months since they had sat at the end of the table together. “It’s nice to see you both together. We have all missed you, Tony.”
“Yes, but my family is more important than my schooling. I am a genius. Remember?” Luna put her hands on her hips and leaned on the cane a bit.
The microphone went out and she looked at Happy who was tearing up. “Happy… what’s going on?”
The moment of truth came when she walked out on the stage looking at the piano. The hands were clumsy, but she figured playing was her utmost priority. Violet walked to the microphone. “Violet M. Rogers-Stark number 620. Playing the piano instead of the violin because of injuries. I will be playing the same song.”
“We can work on it,” Tony told him and sighed holding his head. “I know we can do it. I promise we can make her better.”
“I am six, but if I am going, to be honest, I am six and…” Peter stuck his tongue out while he was doing the math in his head. “Two hundred and seventy-four days old. So is Violet! We are twins. She’s my best friend too! Well except when she gets mad at me.”
As soon as the strange man left Steve turned to Tony with hands on his lap. “There is no fucking way in hell that she is going.”
“VI?!” Peter swung down and looked in his suit at his twin.
Harry looked up at him smiling. “I waited fourteen years. I can wait a little longer. Decides I just came here for Sirius!”
“You can call me, Clint. And it’s alright, I was still up anyway. Get some rest.” Clint waved and walked out of the room with the husbands.
Steve stiffens for a millisecond, but he relaxes back into Tony’s embrace. “I’m sorry, Tony,” he says finally. “I shouldn’t act like this. I should…,” he trails off. “Are
“What do you call this?” Tony asks instantly, not even greeting him.
Tony’s cheeks are a little flushed, but he moves until he’s able to slide underneath Steve. He sits back and watches as Steve starts down his chest, kissing lightly over small trail of hair that leads from his belly button. Tony gasps when Steve finally makes it to his cock, cursing when he feels Steve’s hot breath against it, and clenches his fists when his tip finally makes it past Steve’s lips.
“He turned this sad day into a happy one,” Tony says finally. “Where’s the artist? I want to ask him something.”
“If you even think that you’re on the same level as Paul, then yes, you’re messed up,” Tony says, his words coming out more harsh than he’d intended. He sighs and takes a breath. “That’s not what I mean. I just…want you to know how much I care about you.”
It’s barely 7:30 when Steve sighs and puts on some clean clothes and shoves his feet into his shoes. He’s going to go drop his work off at the gallery and then he’s going to go buy a coffee pot. And maybe a few groceries, because he didn’t realize that all his food is out of date. As much as he’d liked being at Tony’s place, it was tough coming home to be by himself when he had forgotten to take care of his own basic needs.
“I’ll park your car, sir,” the man says.
When Steve finally gets into his car, he grimaces and holds back tears. They’re not from pain, or they might be, but more from disappointment. Why does he let Paul do this to him every week? Why doesn’t he put a stop to it?
“Need a hand with any of that?” he asks, pointing to the bag of supplies Steve has.
Paul moves again, this time to shift his knee back into Steve’s stomach. It hurts, a lot, but not as much as the hand squeezing him so tightly that he’s losing blood flow to his member.
“Will you be able to make the show tonight?” she asks him, ignoring his silence on her previous comment.
“Yes.”
“Tell me what you want, Steve,” Tony groans.
SEVEN
“Me and Tony were chatting about you before you came out,” Paul says. “I told him about how you like the things I did to you. How you asked me to do them.”
It’s nearing dawn when Steve wakes up again, and this time he feels warm. It takes him a second to realize that the hot breath on his shoulder is coming from Tony, and that the other man has wrapped himself around Steve and has fallen asleep.
But when Tony doesn’t pull away, Steve leans forward and wraps a hand around Tony’s waist. He brings him closer, kisses him deeply, his tongue snaking out to run along Tony’s bottom lip. Tony grants him entrance and suddenly their tongues are pressing together, the kiss hotter than anything Steve has ever experienced.
Steve heads back to the elevator and then gives one final wave to Tony before the doors close and he heads back up to the ballroom. He has to adjust his pants slightly, annoyed with himself for being unable to keep it professional. It’s so strange for him because nothing affects him like this usually. He doesn’t get hot and bothered when he sees an attractive man on the streets. He doesn’t have to hide a bulge in his pants when he’s anywhere else. What is it about Tony Stark that does this to him?
Steve cuts him off with a kiss, cupping Tony’s face in his hands and smiling when Tony just stares back at him.
Steve bit his lip, because it was completely possible. He hadn’t technically ever agreed to what Paul had done to him, but he’d never said no, either.
Steve chuckles and the two of them head back outside to Tony’s car. He pretends not to notice, but Steve sees Tony look around cautiously before holding the car door open and then closing it when he’s is safely inside.
He lives in a dingy, one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn where the train rattles his room every time it comes by. He hates it there, but it’s been a place he can call home since he was old enough to have his own place. Maybe one day he’ll move into a nicer part of town. Maybe one day pigs will fly.
Steve smiles. “So what are you feeding me?” he asks. “I’m pretty sure I was promised dinner.”
Steve just shrugs, because he’s pretty sure he doesn’t
They stop to linger at a few interesting pieces of art, just so Tony can comment on them and have people write down his every word. For the most part they keep a reasonable distance between themselves so that the speculation just dies at the speculation. Steve doesn’t know if Tony’s doing it for his own sake, or because he wants Steve to feel comfortable, but he’s glad. He’s not embarrassed of Tony, but he thinks that maybe, possible, Tony should be embarrassed to be seen with him.
Tony is quiet again for a few seconds, and then he says, “We don’t actually have any pictures together. I googled it. Not one.”
Steve thinks about it, thinks about how it might be a good idea to not sleep at his own house, alone, waiting for a vengeful Paul to show up, but he declines Phil’s offer. “No, thanks,” he says. “I’ll be alright.”
Tony waves his hand. “Spill a couple million for children, nobody bats an eye. But when you donate a few hundred thousand to an LGBT march everybody’s got an opinion.”
He dusts himself off, cleaning up the mess as best he can, and then shoots Tony a goodbye message. He’s surprised to see a message in return almost instantly: “Get some sleep. Things to sculpt tomorrow.”
“I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about,” Tony insists, taking a few steps closer to look at what Steve is holding up. “What is that? A check?”
It takes the rest of the night, but eventually, when he’s finished, he manages to get himself into his bed for a few hours of sleep.
Sometimes that bothered Steve, though, because he had grown up with almost nothing. There were some days when he didn’t even get to eat because he didn’t have enough food growing up. There were some days when the roof on his old house leaked so bad that he’d have to sit up all night trying to catch the water in buckets so it didn’t destroy what was left of his home. Steve sometimes wonders if Tony ever felt like that, like he had to stay up all night to prevent his house from washing away.
The shower is too hot, but Steve just takes the brutal heat until his skin turns red and he starts sweating even in the water. He wants to wash Paul off him. He wants to not think about it anymore until next week, when he’ll do this all over again.
Steve takes a deep breath before getting out of his car and going up the steps to the second floor. He finds the room and knocks on the door. It’s opened immediately as if Paul has been waiting
Steve moves his hands until they’re flat against Tony’s stomach, feeling slowly and trying to keep his thoughts strictly professional. He moves them up, almost reaching Tony’s shoulders again before he feels something under the thin material of Tony’s shirt. It feels like a scar, a long, deep scar.
When Steve’s arm falls asleep, be begrudgingly slides himself out from under Tony and heads for the bathroom. They must have fallen asleep, because suddenly their two hours until the show has turned into about twenty minutes, but Steve doesn’t rush. He doesn’t even wake Tony up at first. He just comes back and watches the man sleep for several minutes, loving the way his chest rises and falls in such an even succession.
“One hell of a ride,” Ryan says, shoving his hand into his pocket. He comes back with a folded stack of money. Steve tries not to feel sick when he takes it, pretending he’s being handed anything other than money. “Same time next week?” Ryan says, a smile on his face.
“He said he was going to kill both of us, and then he said if I helped him kill Tony, he’d let me live.”
Tony smiles and then kisses Steve as he walks onto the elevator. “I’ll miss you,” Tony calls as the doors are shutting.
“You know. Your cut of the sale price.”
Steve nods, burying his face in Tony’s hair. “I promise, Tony.”
“Can I buy you a drink?” the voice asked, and Steve’s eyes went wide. He turned just enough to see Tony Stark there, sitting down, taking the seat even though it wasn’t offered.
“Why not?”
“You don’t have to go,” Tony says while Steve is putting his laundry in a duffle bag.
“When’s the last time you woodworked?”
“Alright,” Tony agrees. “What are you in the mood for?” Steve feels like this is a loaded question, so he just grins and waits for Tony to suggest something. He’s not even surprised when Tony adds, “Because I’m in the mood for
Steve bites his lip. Of course the most important question would be asked immediately.
FIFTEEN
Steve finally squeezes Tony’s hand back, accepting the reassurance even though he doesn’t feel it.
Steve gulps a little, fear moving into his chest. He’s not afraid of being seen with Tony in public, but he’s afraid of the paparazzi seeing them and making a big deal out of it, and then news will get around to Paul and it could affect Tony in a negative way.
“Yes, it’s okay. But would you mind if I went home for a while?”
Tony shrugs. “I don’t really need to know about your past to know who you are now.”
“Steve,” Paul says. “Why don’t you go join your lover? I’ll kill you together.”
Tony follows his gaze, but he doesn’t instantly see the threat. He just sees a guy in a suit, who happens to be staring daggers back at Steve.
“I don’t want your money.”
Tony nods. “No time like the present.”
“You’re so tight, Steve,” Tony moans, and he adds another finger, stretching and scissoring to loosen him a bit.
He probably lays there like that for another twenty minutes before Tony starts to stir. He watches as Tony grumbles, and then suddenly his eyes shoot open as if he just realized that there is someone else in his bed. Someone else
He wakes up a few times through the night. The first time, just to Tony murmuring lighting to someone on the phone about “tracing a call,” and the second time to Tony having a quiet, but heated, conversation with someone in the living room. Steve wants to get out of bed and find out what’s going on, but he’s too tired and he falls asleep again before he can.
“Um, no,” he responds, realizing he hasn’t eaten at all today. Two beers at Ryan’s house was his lunch.
“I’m feeling okay,” Steve nods back. It’s not a lie, either. Steve usually heals very quickly, but the car accident must have done more damage than he initially thought because his body is only almost there. His shoulder is still wrapped up in the sling, which is annoying, but the doctor told him to wear it for a week. Tomorrow will be officially a week, so it’ll be coming off for sure. Steve’s back still hurts if he tries to bend or twist too fast, but he is getting around just fine.
Steve finally makes it in to shade Tony’s mustache, then draws his lips so carefully and slowly that he’s pretty sure they’ve been sitting there for years. He traces over the lines, darkening them. He starts on the nose, moving up and up until it’s inevitable, he has to look into Tony’s eyes to be able to draw them.
Tony shrugs. “I ask, people do.”
“Why?”
Steve listens to them chatter about his work for a few more moments until they move on. He stands back a few feet to look at it from their perspective, and he’s glad he drew the happy girl after all. The scene should have been a mother and her daughter having a good day, but in reality, it hadn’t been like that at all. The mother was on her phone, and her daughter was sitting by herself quietly until the mother yelled at her, and then the girl had cried. It had been a sad thing to see.
However, Time became concerned when the Ancients decided that the Infinities needed

Be warned, Vlad spends this entire chapter drunk and angry.
Heyyy look who finally finished the fucking chapter.
Clockwork was now livid and Vlad, who suddenly had rings that seemed to suck the light away pass over his body and in their wake left a vampiric ghost with long black hair and four sets of sickle-like fangs, looked more than ready to kill. Even Charles fixed everyone with a glare. (Tony was simply trying to contain an excited cackle along with a great deal of questions he wanted to ask that would be highly inappropriate at this time.)
“What is it, Tony?” The super soldier asked, “What do you want to say to Vlad Masters?”

The word "You" is an exception, it is still spelled out as "cae" entirely because I decided to make things easier by dropping letters you don't actually say after I wrote this chapter and I don't feel like going back and changing it.
Steve can’t help but to smile. Tony is certainly known for his antics, and the media eats him up and broadcasts his every public move. They must have wondered lately where he was, and why he was hiding.
“Everything okay?” Tony asks.
“I can tell,” Steve laughs back.
“You shouldn’t have to go through it.”
He goes to the elevator quickly, holding his stomach in his hand again, and then dares to look up as the doors slide closed, watching Tony’s confused face go from shock to hurt.
When Steve starts to move, Tony’s chest squeezes tightly, waiting for Steve to say, “I have to go.” But instead of getting up, Steve drapes his arm around Tony and they lie there like that, pressed together, covered in come and sweat.
“Me, either,” Tony says back. “Well, not anymore. I do bad things when I drink and learn lessons the hard way.”
“I will,” Steve promises, and he bites back a choking sound.
Tony disappears around the corner and Steve is left standing there trying to get the image of a disheveled Tony Stark out of his head.
“Did I do something to upset you?”
“My work will wait for me,” Tony says back.
It’s a few hours later when the detective arrives at the tower. Tony managed to get Steve calm with tea, and a gentle blow job that definitely helped. But as soon as the elevator dings and the detective walks off, Steve’s whole body goes rigid again.
He can hear monitors to his left making noises, and his hand is trapped in something warm. It takes a him a moment to realize that it’s someone else’s hand against his own, and that he’s not trapped. It actually feels nice.
His head goes back to Stark Tower, about Tony being so close, about the way their tongues melded together, fighting for space.
“Um, Mr. Stark?” Steve says when he’s within hearing distance.
Steve lifts his hands slightly so rest on Tony’s sides, pulling him in for a deep kiss. Their tongues meet in the middle, Tony’s stubble rubbing against Steve’s face. They moan into each other’s embrace, and suddenly Steve doesn’t care if this is a bad idea anymore. He wants to spend this night with Tony. He wants to enjoy his time, because definitely, this will be the
“Almost five,” Steve answers.
It probably wouldn’t be this busy if Tony Stark weren’t on the guest list. There probably would only be one reporter, maybe two, talking about the newest up and coming artists, and the guy whose art once sold for a million dollars at a charity auction. But, with Tony there, there were hundreds of people moving in and out of the gallery, just trying to get a look at him and the eyecandy he was carrying around for the day.
“Sorry,” he says, but doesn’t offer any further explanation.
“I know him from my…line of work,” Steve says.
Steve swallows and just nods, unsure of what to say. He had been expecting for Tony to get angry, throw something, hit him even. But complete understanding and acceptance…he wasn’t prepared for that. He didn’t know how to handle the emotions that came with it.
“Not yet,” Steve says back, circling the base of Tony’s erection to stave off his orgasm. It takes a second, but finally Tony regains a bit of composure. “I want you to fuck me, Tony. Think you can?”
“Do you want one?”
. What was Steve supposed to think?
Another week has passed, and still not much has changed. Tony is withdrawn, and that worries Steve. They had stayed in the tower mostly, seeing each other as a routine for meals and Tony would come lay down with Steve until he fell asleep, and then he’d go off and do whatever it was he was working on.
Tony nods. “I think that’s a good idea.” Tony pauses, and then he takes Steve’s wrist in his hand. “But first you need to wash this off.” He nods to the blood that is still staining Steve’s fingers, and Steve stares at it for a few seconds before he nods.
“Of course whatever I want,” Paul says back. “You’re my little slut. You love it when I do this to you, don’t you?”
Steve’s stomach growls and Tony grins. “I knew you’d be hungry!” he says, as if it were the lottery and he’s just won.
“Go in through the door,” the guy says obviously.
“Am I…okay?” he asks after a moment.
Tony blinks, seemingly unaware of how long he’s been in his lab. “Sleep good?” he finally returns.
“I don’t need your help!”
The officer nods, and then suddenly the room is empty. It’s just Tony and Steve, and they’re still clutching each other tightly in the same spot on the floor.
Steve takes his phone as he eases into the water, putting it carefully on the shelf as he dips his body below the surface. His phone buzzes again so he has to wipe his hand on a towel before grabbing it. The message reads, “What time can I expect you?”
Steve takes a step back, wanting to ask if he could “feel the lines” but not sure how Tony feels about being touched. He decides he can probably sculpt without having to make Tony uncomfortable, but it’s just something he’s always done.
“Helen Cho is in the building coming to the lab as we speak,” Jarvis spoke.
Tony just held her and laughed. “No. I told you. This was to see a doctor, Loo-Boo. We will go next year for your birthday to do all of that.”
Luna could hear people in her class take pictures of her and start recording the conversation. “Pops. We can fix it.” Luna pleaded with him speaking into the phone's speaker. “I can get Bruce on the phone and we can try something else. Pops I can’t lose you too. I just lost Dad. Not you. Not you please…”
She nodded and leaned into him. “Let’s go dance. Together. Pretend no one is on the dance floor and just move.”
“Why did you attack Stark’s Tower?”

[Dad: She’s dreaming.]
“Peggy? She not dead. We just had lunch with her.” Peter protested and began to cry.
“Bucky, where in the sam hell am I?! I want to go home!” Steve asked his oldest friend walking over to him. Just watching him Steve could tell there was something going on that he didn’t know.
Tony left the kids and knocked on the men’s bathroom. “Steve, you in there?”
“Not sure… I’m not so sure. She’s not gonna be the same! It’s my fault. ” Tony told him and leaned back in the chair. It was obvious that he hasn’t slept in the past two days.
The frail Stark-Rogers girl grew up faster than she was supposed too. Everyone in the Avengers including Happy became her guardian to make sure she was raised right. Luna went back to Hogwarts to gain her sight back from Dumbledore. He was more than happy to give it back to her. After the news went out again that there was a hidden daughter of the famous Stark-Rogers couple she graduated from Midtown High and went to MIT online schooling.
“Hey, Papa.” Peter smiled and took a bite of the ice chips. “I heard I freaked a nurse out with my finger! Is that true? I hope it is!”
“No. It was a mistake that won’t happen again.” Bruce set a hand on his shoulder and smiled. “It’ll be okay. I promise.”
“Not about that, Stark. We need to get the press all on the same page about your family life. You caused this mess and you will fix it. There are eight press meetings set up for both of you. And depending on what you say five for the twins. Which they need to sign with us if they want to stay on. They can not play hero without my consent fur-” Fury barked at them.
Jessica shook her head. “No. Luna’s real name is Luca Lovegood. She was taken away from her parents for doing an illegal sex reassignment.”
Luna started to laugh and snorted covering her mouth. “There my parents. Of course, I’m like them. They have had me since I was five. It’s been seven years with them two months ago. I don’t remember the first four years of my life. I remember little things… like the sex change surgery and there faces a bit, but… no matter what. Tony and Steve will always be my true parents. I don’t care if they're not the same DNA. Blood doesn’t make a family. Love does.”
“Peter, I think you need to get that suit back on,” Tony told him and hit the Avengers Assemble button. The whole tower was starting to go into lockdown. It didn’t take the other team members long to come down to the lab.
She nodded and helped him sit on the bench then climbed up herself. Peter yawned and curled into Violet sucking his thumb.
Tony kneeled slowly and started picking up the glass plate shards. “Hand me a bag, please.”
“Why won’t that kid close the wormhole?!” Ant-Man yelled into his headset.
“No. Tell us now, please. I need to stand.” Steve told her and looked at Tony who was about to pass out from standing still. Steve sighed and helped Tony to sit down in the nearest seat. “You are getting looked at after this.”
The group ran as fast as they could. Luna stood stunned looking at the man standing stunned. She backed up slowly and ran towards the others. When the same man from the other side of the room appeared in front of her and smacked her in the face with the butt of his wand. Her lip immediately started pouring out blood along with where she hit the back of her head.
Luna shrugged and pulled out the Stark Tablet and put in one of her headphones listening to the material on the worksheet. Once the class ended the pair walked out together with Ned and MJ. Flash was right on their tail.
When Peter walked inside Bruce stopped what he was doing and ran over. “What happened?!”
She grinned into his neck leaning into him more. “You make a hot Natsu. Now let’s get going. Happy will have my neck if I’m late to something again. Newt let’s go, buddy!”
“Yo, Penis Parker! Look at you four. Are you having a foursome or something? Can blind people have sex? I guess she can’t tell if you have a big or small dick. Good thing too you seem like you have a small one.” Flash asked them pushing Peter into the wall.

“I'll ask you again:
“Return the Time Stone, Clockwork,” Dr. Strange demanded. Clockwork’s face hardened and Vlad stopped twitching and purring drunkenly and began his thrashing and snarling anew.
“We can find a way to have you stay free without the Time Stone, Clockwork,” Steve tried, hoping to soothe the angry duo on the couch and still coax them to return the stolen Infinity Stone, “I’m sure of it.”
The human stared at the unmoving ghost that was now in the form of a young adult (eighteen, nineteen at the oldest) and shifted back a little when he noticed the long, jagged scar over the specter’s left eye began glowing the same red as its unblinking blank eyes. Dr. Strange could

Xavier knew that Stark had figured out Vlad’s secret and really wanted to confront him, and so he knew Tony’s motive for extending the invitation. He also knew that Strange had figured out who Work really was and had confided in Tony. CW gave him a knowing glance when he silently warned him, and responded only with a mental chuckle and an “Oh, I know. I’m looking forward to it.”
Peter was the only “reporter” (Tony refused to call him that because “it makes him sound like one of those vultures”) allowed into the after party despite the presence of alcohol and the fact that he was underage, because he’d asked Brock why a man of Mr. Masters’ stature would allow a quote “charity case” unquote to periodically trip him into his lap all night and the teen had then turned to the couple and apologized for the older reporter’s behavior after the blond had stormed out. Peter had been hearing the man talk like that all day, and he was sick of it. Vlad had said, “Well, at least the

Not even Charlie had been able to get him to speak, and Charles reported that when he’d prodded the man’s thoughts he was told to piss off, albeit in ruder and more vulgar terms and in Russian and perfect classical Latin, and then received a slew of very creative and vicious death threats when the graying man realized that it was a

The first Ancient, a powerful ghost who called himself The Majesty (Time called him a pompous jackass, and then had to explain to his siblings what that was (and they then agreed)), had decided to break off a piece of each Infinity’s core and give it to their caretakers, thus granting each caretaker the title of “Master.” Clockwork could still vividly remember the

of all things (Clockwork had given him Vladimir’s birth mother's locket that had been taken from him by the American agency taking in Russian orphans back in the sixties and seventies)).
Vlad tore the bowl off his head with a snarl, revealing a pair of glowing red eyes sunken into a very corpse-like pale face as his makeup dripped off with the punch, and lunged, snarling like a rabid cat with his mouth open so wide it surely had come unhinged and four sets of long, sharp fangs making themselves visible, at the no longer bickering duo (who were now screaming and hugging each other in terror). Before anyone could pull themselves out of their shock (which actually only took about one second, if even that), Charles Work was airborne and yanking Vlad back as he flew back and forcefully landed on the couch, pinning a livid and thrashing Vlad’s arms to his sides whilst wearing a facial expression that clearly stated that this was in no way going to plan.
“Steven Grant Rogers,” Charles stated, “Were you even

Clockwork suddenly lunged forward and phased his hand through the Eye and grabbed the Time Stone. He pulled his hand back and thrust it through the now open door in his chest and behind to clock within the casing, fitting the stone into his well-hidden core. The tolling of bells and the sound of thousands of clocks ticking away flooded the room and overwhelmed Dr. Strange as he crumpled down on the floor with his hands clamped over his ears, eyes locked on the entity. Clockwork’s aura flared powerfully, his mouth fell open and his eyes widened to near-perfect circles.

“I know that Dr. Strange has not told you all he knows, likely because he thinks it irrelevant, but the Time Stone allowed its Master to control time because of me. I was bound to it not because of some ancient spell, but because it was formed when my core was
Clockwork paused to give everyone a moment to process what he’d said, he knew that Tony would give in and start asking excited questions soon (thankfully none of which involved the re-creation of the Time Stone, but most were about his core and how cores in general worked), so he calmly added, “And Tony, I will answer most of your questions about how ghost cores work tomorrow morning and your questions about ghost culture and ghosts in general later.”
and in another timeline I already have, and if I wanted to draw it out I’ll have you know that when it comes to physical strength I am surpassed only by my sister Power. Or I could simply release my mate here and allow him to unleash his righteous fury upon your asses.
Clockwork harshly shook himself out of his thoughts and back to the present. Now was not the time to fixate on the past. Right now, Clockwork had a piece of his core to retrieve.
Charles had then, out of curiosity, tried to look through Clockwork’s thoughts, but was met by the ghost blocking him and only letting him hear the words, “Nice try, but not happening.” Clockwork then initiated a mental conversation with the telepath. Charles learned from their conversation that Clockwork’s brother Psych had trouble tuning out the thoughts of others for centuries and would often shut people’s brains off if they thought too loudly or too often and so his siblings quickly learned to block him out, and if he could block out the Ghost of Mind with ease, he could certainly block out Charles in his sleep.

The Eye of Agamoto, from which he could feel the thrum of power from his fractured core radiating out and calling to him. Distantly, it occurred to him that Dr. Strange might be able to feel the Time Stone calling out to him.

A few days prior, Tony had run a facial rec on the Wisconsin Ghost out of boredom and to test out his updates to the software (he improved the bone structure recognition algorithms), and had spit out his coffee and ordered JARVIS to redo the scan when the results of the first scan popped up on the screen. After it had been confirmed that no, it was

At this moment, as Steve was about to respond, Scott and Clint’s argument had escalated to a shouting match which quickly drew the attention of almost everyone in the room and just as quickly devolved into a shoving match. Right by the concessions table. The duo fell hard on the table and the punch bowl was airborne. It flew through the air, and by the time CW had gotten Vlad out of his own head enough to be aware of his surroundings, it was too late. The punch bowl landed on Vlad’s head, soaking his suit and hair, and the entire room froze, silently watching with shock or horror (Vlad’s temper was just as legendary as his alcohol tolerance, and it was no secret that numerous different judges had saddled him with a
