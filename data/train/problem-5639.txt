“We used Thor's lightning once,” Steve said. His heart was pounding in his ears. This was Tony's field, right? Solving the problem in a split-second of ingenuity.
“Oh, that's actually for—oh, it's fine,” Steve's voice trailed off as Carol took a long slurp. “Thanks for looking out for me. You know, I'll just make more.” True to his word, he went over to the machine and started a new batch. Which was ridiculous, he had his own mug of coffee right there, and Carol wondered whether that was his invitation for her to take Steve's too. Its smell was proving quite tempting.
“Top of that store.” The stucco roof of the restaurant would mean anyone who dropped off there would spend a moment trying to find their footing, giving Steve time to pick them off.
“That's good,” Rogers said, quietly, like he didn't want to admit it. It was easy, now, for Steve to see his past through the tint of nostalgia. But back then, he'd still had to deal with the guilt of losing Bucky, and trying to live in a world that barely needed Captain America, and didn't care about Steve Rogers.
Steve licked his lips, and tasted copper. Tony must have bitten him too hard earlier and drew blood.
“Yeah, few things worth turning down an orgasm for.” And there, a way to angle into asking if they could do this again, multiple times, even. “I'm pretty sure Rhodey thought we were fuckbuddies earlier.”
“Sensitive, really?” Tony curled in a hollow next to Steve. Steve turned his head, and they shared a kiss. When they let go, Tony smirked, letting a finger run over Steve's balls. “Have you ever tried anything with your ass? You should, it's an amazing ass.”
Steve hopes they were good ones, but Morgan’s face betrays nothing but child-like curiosity as she stares up at him.
If Steve had thought that touching Tony before, through layers of clothing, had been a shock, then this is. This is being hit with the full force of Thor’s lightning. The person he’d been for the past five years, the person who’d been in love hopelessly, endlessly. Whoever that Steve was no longer exists, with the force of their newly formed bond. He can’t take his eyes off Tony when their hands clasp together, and even though Tony’s eyes are hidden behind his sunglasses, he knows Tony is doing the same.
“By the way,” Rogers muttered. “I gave Tony a vial of my blood. He seemed to think it could help reverse the effects of the deseruming.”
It was nothing like this, wasting away in a hospital bed while his husband fretted over him, like those soap operas that Tony was full of disdain for, yet always up-to-date on the latest developments.
This was exactly why Tony was his favorite. Tony clapped his hand on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve reached up to grab his hand before he pulled it away.
Tony had a trail of dark hair, starting from below his belly button, that thickened the further down it went.
Generations upon generations of old wives’ tales turned into its own sub-field of philosophy. The evolutionary perspective on hanahaki disease posit that it’s the heart—the soul’s immune system. The disease is symptomatic of the body’s rejection of something dangerous and its attempt to expel it from its system. The danger, of course, being unrequited love. Love can be an inconvenient barrier hampering people’s impulse to reproduce, and none more so, the theory states, than unrequited love. If, by nature, your love will remain unrequited, and your love will be unconsummated, then the body tries to physically get rid of it.
A wave of pure, startled fondness washes over Steve. His heart pounds, even as his throat constricts. “That was mostly me,” he admits. “It’s not like Vision could really eat. And Wanda never got used to having access to whatever food she wanted, I think.”
Tony’s feet pound against the shoreline when he sprints. It’s more jarring to have to come to an abrupt stop than keep going. But Steve’s made the same decision. A few feet separate them, but they watch each other like they’re on two sides of a gaping abyss, with neither of them sure how to cross.
The tears came, more easily than they had when he'd met his mother, when Steve began to pound his fist against the wall. He was shouting, and his face was turning red. For all his beauty, he was a devastatingly ugly crier.
Instead, Tony leaned in, slowly, hesitatingly, like he was reminding Steve that he could stop him any moment.
Steve hadn’t exactly had much time for sight-seeing, and previously had no real inclination to travel. Just walking outside was a trip into a different world, and going home hadn't felt like it for a long time, before Tony.
“Nothing but small-fry, Steve,” he said over the comms with a laugh. Steve's lips quirked up despite himself.
Tony grumbled. “The last guy who did that to me didn’t get to play in the orgy. You’re lucky I like you.”
A small sigh came from beside him, and the couch shifted when Tony got up. There was a pause, like Tony was ready to say something. But even with all of Steve's enhanced senses, he didn't hear anything other than the sound of footsteps walking away.
Steve’s eyes are locked onto his, and Tony can’t look away. He hasn’t ever been able to deny the full force of Steve’s attention the rare moments he has it. He watches as Steve gulps, the action rippling down his throat, his Adam’s apple bobbing.
“But no team to train superheroes that aren't mutants that's not controlled by government interests?” Tony insisted.
Steve scanned the headline. It was the one from yesterday, with the headline plastered over the front page. After Jan pulled out today's newspaper, he noted the story had been relegated to the entertainment section.
It was even more awkward for Steve than it was for Tony, Tony was sure. No one else they knew really understand what Steve Rogers's mother meant to him. In the moment on the street, Steve had eyes for no one else other than her, but after the fact...Tony should have excused himself and left them alone.
“It's okay,” she told him, and brought him in for a hug. Steve's shoulders shook as she rubbed his back.
He knows what her answer is. Loving Tony is worth the pain. All of it: emotional, physical, like a rendering of his soul. It’d be worth his life, part of Steve still believes. But he can’t save Tony. He has to leave Tony’s memory to everyone else who loved him. There’s enough love in the universe three thousand times over for the life of Tony Stark, and what is Steve’s love for him in the face of that?
There was a tapping on the side of the couch, as Tony looked at the screen. “It’s probably better for us to take our vacation now, rather than later.”
Instead of a chorus of outcry or annoyance, the room went quiet. No one seemed to be interested in looking at anything except their drinks.
It wasn't only Tony back then–there had been Thor and Donald Blake, and even Hank and Jan had kept up the pretense of secret identities. It was surreal to recall how it worked back then. Now it was second nature, to know the names of every single person under their mask. It had become important to Steve to be able to see his friends' faces.
He let his hand run down the wall and let go, but there was nothing behind it, turning back to the empty lab.
Tony's cheeks were covered in blood, and Steve jerked back before he realized the blood came from his own fingertips. His fingernails had been ripped off.
“Gotcha,” Tony said, and as they rose, turned in a semi-circle, shooting off repulsors against more agents. “We're going to have a hell of a time getting all of these Hydra out,” he added.
“It was magic,” Thor insisted again, a bit more quietly, and went off to wherever he had to go to get to Asgard. Under a bridge underneath a piece of cardboard, a nudist beach, the corner of a backroom of a club filled with smoke and hard drugs. Steve didn’t care anymore what had to be done. If Tony needed a damn fairy godmother to save him, Steve wouldn’t stop until he'd wrung out every last speck of fairy dust in the world.
Was that it? Had he pleased Tony by getting mad? Was that a turn-on for Tony, and one of those—those kinks that Jan had wanted so hard to try out with him. Thinking about being nothing but—but an unwitting source of sexual satisfaction for Tony made Steve's inner valve go to red, set to explode.
Steve pinned Tony's free hand by the wrist to the mattress and made Tony look him in the eye. “Don’t talk about anyone else.”
He reaches Tony’s bedroom and carefully removes his shoes before tucking Tony in. Steve lets the rattle in his throat out for once, and the breathy rasp is too loud in the darkness. He jerks out of his trance and stands up.
Tony scoffs, but there’s no heat to it. “I already made a big deal out of my goodbye the first time around when I came to the compound. Said that Daddy’s off to do some Iron Man things and save the world. Morgan was pretty excited about it, all things considered.”
Their first kiss as an engaged couple ended with Tony becoming too enthusiastic and both of them toppling to the floor, but of all of them, it was Steve’s favorite.
Steve felt a rush of heat shoot down his spine, and it was definitely only because he didn't like seeing his friend be hurt, or touched like this.
The universe is telling him, that he made a mistake somewhere, choosing to sacrifice the perfect love. She had believed in him before he believed in himself. The moment he downed the airplane, he had lost his chance for an idyllic life. He had never been meant to fall in love again, and his sickness is proof of that.
The armor was unresponsive, and Steve clicked the latches on the side of his helmet, revealing an unconscious Tony, green flight gel running down the side of his head. Steve patted his face, his heart racing, desperate for any response.
Rogers's expression grew blanker, and Steve could understand what people meant about the Cap expression on the surface level. But whatever Rogers did to hide his emotions couldn't work on Steve.
There’s a small snort from Tony. “Well, I’d never want to let the team down.” Tony shuffles in place, and the rare moment of shyness sends a surge of affection through Steve. There’s a part of him that he knows places Tony on a pedestal, but seeing him like this affirms what he already knows: whatever Tony has done, he’s done through conscious choices, decisions, always moving forward. It’s something to admire. Steve wishes there was a world where they didn’t have to make choices like this, but Tony has this ability to make them and own them. He’s amazing.
Rogers stood in the middle of the street, chest heaving, and wiped an arm across his face. Tony, floating over the scene, looked over in Steve's direction and raised an arm.
Steve tries out the words to himself, in one of the motel rooms that still charge money and he still insists on paying for, when there are entire neighborhoods of abandoned houses with their broken windows and ajar doors for travelers needing a place to stay, or food to eat.
“You woke up all alone, sixty years in the future and became the star of a B-rated sci-fi flick.” Tony squeezed Steve's fingers. “I should be thankful your imagination is still so limited.”
Steve's takedown hadn't been the most basic, and they couldn't start with it. Steve told him so, trying to ignore how aware he was of his own skin and how it might not just be Tony who wouldn't be able to stand hours of intense grappling practice.
“Ooh. I think it’s been a while since we last played. Time to learn all about everyone’s latest exploits,” Jan laughed. “Let’s get to it, then. Should we refill on drinks?”
“Let's save that for a last resort, Captain.” Thor landed with a heavy thud next to them. She swayed a bit on her feet, swearing when she saw Tony’s state.
Once, the idea of Steve being sued was laughable. But now, the name Captain America didn’t bring as much goodwill as it used to, ever since Americans had to come to the uncomfortable realization that Steve Rogers existed under the mask.
A bright light lit up the entire street, even in the daylight, and the back of Steve's neck burned at the heat of the beam. When the rumbling was gone, the wailing was even louder. Steve shot up, looking at the collapsed building.
Tony snapped out of it, his eyes alert as he glanced over at Steve. Steve basked in the fullness of Tony’s attention. Tony laughed. “Yeah, it’s the worst.”
“It’s none of her business, and she wouldn’t care. It’s none of yours either, unless you mean to join us,” Tony said airily.
“Well, that was a good one, Carol!” Tony said, clapping his hands together. His voice was unnaturally high. “You got everyone to drink, well, except me. Because….well. So we have our winners for the night!” He drained the rest of his glass. “Anyway, I’m out for the night. I want to make some headway on the Iron Man propulsion system tomorrow. Jarvis has the night off, but you’re all adults. You can clean up after yourselves, right?”
With her first plan of action stalled, Carol had to go test her luck on a much larger, more difficult target.
“It's not,” Steve smiled, like he was sharing a secret. “No one to bother us, because who's gong to leave here before midnight? And there's the coat room,” Steve said primly, as his hands slid around Tony's waist. Tony admired the muscles in his shoulders before Steve tilted his head at an angle to kiss. Not the right angle, but it was fine, Tony would give him all the time to adjust.
Years pass. They want Captain America to contribute to the recovery effort somehow, to lend his face to the world’s healing. Steve doesn’t know what he’s done to help, until he sees a flyer for a support group at the VA center. It’s not just for veterans, of course. But when he enters, the entire group turns to face him, and Steve feels a little guilty that he’s taking the spotlight away from others, or from the counselor who’s actually there to help. Steve’s…Steve’s just here to be helped, he thinks. But the others hang onto his every word, no matter how forced or contrived they are. He still doesn’t know how much he can share. He remembers his painful adjustment to the future, where he believed anything he said, any pain he shared, would make others uncomfortable. But then again, keeping his feelings all to himself did the same thing. The few people close to him were concerned with how much he hid away, how little he opened up. But the people at Steve’s first support group, even with his fumbling words, had nodded, affirming with gentle words their shared pain.
In the hospital bed, Tony didn’t look much better than he had before his three surgeries. His heart rate was weak, and his breathing was shallow. If there was a change in either, Steve would be the first to know.
“That’s not very nice, Steve.” Natasha purses her lips to smother the sudden, unexpected smile. “But well, maybe a girl’s got more appetite when she’s got things to do.” Like coordinating a worldwide aid effort didn’t count as enough. “Not that telling Tony that would make any difference. To him, he’ll always be feeding a team of superhumans.”
Tony brought his gaze over. The tense lines of Steve's back made the muscles there even harder to ignore.
“It's fine. I'm just...sensitive,” Steve mumbled, and he was trembling already in Tony's grip moving slowly up and down.
He felt Tony shift, but the other man didn’t offer any words up. What was Tony going to tell him? Even money couldn’t buy his life away from cancer. Steve had known the first time he’d kissed Tony back that he was falling into something he couldn’t handle. But there was a reason that Tony lived like he did, to the fullest. Back then, it’d made Steve envious. Back then, he never would have imagined ending up here. That was just like Tony, to turn his views upside-down and make him realize there was so much room for life to change for the better.
“Intriguing,” Reed said. “Anthony Edward Stark. Iron Man? And none of my records indicate any Howard Starks.”
He still loves her. The part of his chest that isn’t weighed down, the part of his throat that doesn’t itch, that can be soothed sometimes, is the evidence.
“Dumber than usual, you mean? I did.” Tony went silent for a moment, before speaking up again. “One just called me a time traveling murder bot. Right before I blasted him in the face. Have to say, the first bit is new.”
“I know what you’re doing,” Tony said. “You broke up with Jan, you miss that sort of connection of living with someone intimately. But I never tolerated that bullshit. You can’t sit here and tell me what to do. Even if we were fucking, you couldn’t do that to me.”
Steve, ever the stolid one, couldn't stop fidgeting. He rocked back from one foot to the other, and kept glancing over at Tony from the corner of his eye.
“You two some of those wanna-be superheroes? The hell, don't use my alleyway to change into your get-ups. Have some decency!”
He hoped Tony wasn't hurt, or in trouble. Tony's business suit covered all of his skin, and Steve searched him over worriedly.
“If I had Thor waiting for me, I never would have bothered bringing you home.” Tony’s voice was strained, and a rush of ugly satisfaction came with it. Good, Steve thought. Tony should stew in his embarrassment. He clearly never felt enough of it to prevent him from doing idiotic, thoughtless things, not if his dick was too busy giving its input. “No, it’s Cap, can’t you tell?”
“That's a thought,” Reed agreed when Tony told him his suspicions. “Perhaps we're not a parallel universe, but a parallel timestream, where the Avengers never existed.”
Tony helps Steve to his feet. The moment’s passed, Steve thinks. The first time he’d kept a secret from him, it’d blown up. It’d ruined them, the team, the world. Steve can’t do it again, no matter how much it’d make Tony hate him. Tony deserves to know all of Steve, after Steve spent so long hiding himself away.
“Oh. Oh, so Captain America hates the passive voice as much as my high school English teachers, does he?” Tony’s eyelashes fluttered, and it was quite unfair they were so long and curled so delicately, as Tony looked up from underneath them.
It was especially late this evening, late enough that Steve didn’t think that Tony would want anything more than a bath and his bed. Yet here Steve had waited, waiting for the last few hours. Steve jumped, twisting around when he heard the ding of the elevator as it approached. His heart rate picked up against common sense.
The wolf whined gently, making to back up. The closer Tony came, the lower it sank to the floor. Tony reached out to touch it, and the whine rose in pitch. But the wolf didn't run, tracking his hand with its sharp blue eyes.
But, he realizes, that’s not the question Tony’s asking. Does Steve trust Tony enough, to lay down not just his life, but the life of the trillions lost? Steve can hand over his own life without a second thought, but the thing about Captain America is that he doesn’t have that luxury of only caring about himself.
Humanity is always fascinated by tales of tragedy. Of suffering through pain, of chasing something impossible. The beauty of unattainability. It takes a year to reach this point, but Steve doesn’t think of it as sad anymore. As a toll on his body, as beautiful suffering. He doesn’t dwell on the pain, or the sadness.
Tony hadn't stopped, and it hurt so much, to think he'd been holding this back while they played at marriage and happiness.
“To go, please,” she told the waitress who approached them with their food in hand. Jan stuffed more than a few bills into the empty water glass. “For the excellent service.”
Bucky and Sam don’t deserve to lose Steve. He doesn’t want to say they’d never forgive him. But Natasha would never forgive him, for not moving on when she never had the chance to. Tony never would, either.
Carol, Jan, and Wanda immediately drank. No, wait, that was Tony drinking. Steve’s face grew hot. But it wasn’t just Tony, there was also Sam and Clint. And Hank, after he pondered his drink and proceeded to take a deep swig.
Steve's cheeks grew hot. Would he? Did Tony notice how Rogers looked around him? Had he noticed, back then, how Steve had been?
Jan jumped when the table jumped. Steve curled the fist he’d slammed into the surface, lowering his head. He was utterly exhausted.
“Anything for my favorite Captain.” Which was complete bullshit, everyone who'd ever met him knew who Tony's favorite Captain was.
“We tried, but all we have to go on is the crazy chick who can't stop talking about how we all deserve this.”
“Easy now?” Tony's voice was gravelly, dropped an octave lower, and now that he was literally between Steve's legs, there was no stopping the sensation that sparked in his groin.
Gail's smile was brilliant. “I'm glad. And no matter how long it lasts, remember that. I know that Bucky worries about me. It hurts, when he tries to talk about my future, or even tries to pull away. I can’t stop him from feeling things, or wanting to do something, any more than I can with myself. I can make him feel supported, and know that he's loved, no matter what he thinks he's doing to me by my choosing to stay. It doesn't even compare to what he's brought into my life.”
The fur loosened and shortened beneath Tony's fingers the more he pet, and he had to back up and lean back, as the wolf grew taller, its snout and ears shortening. It was one of the most surreal things he'd ever seen, and by the end of it, it wasn't any less surreal, with his hands resting on the face of a very naked Steve Rogers.
Extremis feeds Tony the newslines, video and audio feeds, reports of the—the newscaster has a slip of the tongue and calls them
Tony was a bit more...forceful than Steve expected, biting and sucking liberally. Steve had imagined him gentler, sweeter, more patient. But it was still
Steve's eyes were closed. When he opened at them, he took a deep breath, shuddering, drinking the sight of Tony in.
Steve’s only been in love once before, and whatever he feels now is nothing like then. His love isn’t neatly wrapped. His love doesn’t bring him simple, pure happiness, but a sense of curiosity and wonder mixed with trepidation. His love feels just like the future itself, a point he’d slowly, barely accepted years after he’d woken up, before half of it disappeared for good.
“Don’t give me that about how it won’t last. You deserve to be happy, at this moment. Heaven knows, I’d give so much to have you be happy, Steve.”
“These readings you've shown me. I'm not sure how I would have ever missed them. Is it possible, that because this isn't another universe, we aren't affected by the incursions either?” There was a tentative hope in Reed's words Tony didn't want to hear.
There’s a sharp inhale, and Natasha fully sits down, propping her knees up and wrapping her arms around them. He thinks this is one more way that he broke Natasha’s heart. She’s so determined to keep their family together, she’s so determined to see him happy. Once, she would have urged him to go after Tony, and confess his feelings. But he sees now, that this is just another way she thinks she’s failed him, and the rest of the Avengers.
“No shame in losing to Captain America,” was all Tony said as they got into position. “But just like you always tell me, treat this like it's real. No more going easy on me.”
Tony was thoughtful as he took gulps from his water bottle, stopping with a loud sigh of relief. “It really depends on how evil-slash-incompetent the attackers are, but I'd say within ten minutes if I'm in the city.”
Carol's first tip-off came the Wednesday after the new charter had been signed and the new team had been branded. Enter the Mighty Avengers, with the new digs to match. T'Challa's people had done a thorough job tidying up their new HQ—Carol could mostly forget that they were currently operating out of a corpse. The corpse of a Celestial whose left ventricle was larger than your average New York walk-up apartment, but a corpse nonetheless.
More so, because more than looks, Tony, even with his guarded expression, looks… content. He hauls Morgan up higher as he watches them. Steve had once called Tony’s Earth’s best defender, and he doesn’t deny it anymore. But the sheer protectiveness that emanates from Tony’s action. Steve wouldn’t have thought it’s possible to fall more in love with someone, but he’s proven wrong here. Like his body’s fighting off the swell of emotions, his throat constricts, making it hard to breathe.
Here, the light blinded his eyes, and his ears pricked high and alert as he scoped the room in search of what he came looking for.
The Christmas tree reached the two stories of the complex, bright and glittery, like something that would get its picture taken if it were placed in Manhattan. Tony leaned back and smiled from his view near the door, rocking back and forth on his heels.
“He insisted on getting the treats ready,” she told him as he glanced around for Steve. “He...no, not him.” She gestured at the photograph Tony had been looking at. “My son was killed in action. Over a decade ago, in Afghanistan.” She walked by Tony, picking up the frame. “He jumped on a grenade to save the rest of his squad. Received a Medal of Honor for it. I remember the day the officer came to the building entrance downstairs. I nearly didn't let him come up.”
In the guest room at the lakehouse, Steve has a sudden, frightening thought to crush the device. It’s so fragile, just like Tony’s arc reactor had been so many years ago. He was so scared to hold the arc reactor back then, but right now, he’s just angry.
“This isn’t my problem,” Tony said abruptly. “It’s yours. You judge people, sort them all into these different levels of—deserved respect. I don’t need you to sit here and talk to me, knowing that you think I’m lower than you because I like to fuck men.”
As awful as it was, Tony hadn't wanted to accept it, either. A different timeline without a trace of the incursions. A world without an Avengers world, and without a Tony Stark.
“Right between all the disease-infested bugs and pollen and wild, rabid animals that will eat our faces off. Wonderful.”
That’s not it, Steve thinks, as Tony continues to deflect. Steve doesn’t deserve the shield. He doesn’t, if he’s quite honest, want the shield anymore. But he’s looking at Tony, and it’s not about what he wants, is it? It’s about what Tony can offer him, and how he deals with that. He’s never taking it for granted again.
“A week. No, make it two weeks. At first, I thought I was just being forgetful, but it's more than coincidence at this point.”
Well, Tony considered after Rhodey had left, his stomach still had some butterflies, but that had gone surprisingly well. Chalk it up to holiday good will and the leftovers they had of Asgardian mead.
Tony showed up to the gym just as Steve asked him to. He had on a black t-shirt, sweatpants, and, most importantly, no tech.
The others laughed, but Steve couldn’t laugh with them. The memory replayed in his mind, reaching out to Tony's face, desperate for a response, any response. Knowing that Tony was in this place because of Steve. For Steve's sake.
The first time Tony woke up, truly woke up, Steve only knew because he’d memorized every pattern of Tony’s. Tony shifted, and his breathing became more regular, and Steve stilled, waiting for him to open his eyes. A few moments later, Tony slipped back to sleep, and for the first time in what seemed like ages, Steve could take a full breath.
“No, and good for you, we know more about timestreams now, enough to get you home.” That got a reaction out of Rogers, a slight, quick grin. Steve continued. “The question before that is who brought you here, and why.”
When he said it, Jan sighed, like she was talking to someone much smaller than Steve was. “Steve, you volunteered to become a supersoldier. One of a kind. And apparently decided to marry the person whose dirty laundry was being aired to the whole world before he even learned to walk. What were you expecting?”
into the simulator. This is about as much skin as I can show on campus, so that's good enough for your delicate sensibilities, right?”
“You’re already working on it.” Steve hunched his shoulders, and the sudden shame was a bitter pill to swallow. Of course, he’d been blinded by the glitz and glamour of Tony’s life, the women and parties and flying suits of armor, though the last one was uniquely Tony Stark. Tony was very good at distracting you from his reality of being a shrewd businessman underneath it all, or maybe Steve was good at not wanting to know.
Tony didn't reply, but he did lower his right arm. Steve stepped close and wrapped his arms firmly around Tony. No more one-armed flying for them, anymore. Tony locked his arm in place around Steve.
Tony laughed. “There’s a mansion, over on Fifth Avenue. I was going to give it up for Ultimates use. You’d like it. Right across the street from Central Park, great place for runs or dates with your rebounds. Rooftop pool. Not much of a training gym there, but that can be arranged. It’s much more your idea of a rich person than the guy living a thousand feet above the rest of New York.”
Wow. He lays his palm on his chest. Is this how Yinsen felt, all those years ago? Tony doesn’t think he’s ever found a calm like this before.
Tony sniffed. “I’ll have you know, I ran out of everything, including the crap, two days ago and was too busy vegetating in old underwear to get more.”
And okay, there was a reason Steve made the calls for the team, because there was no way this display could have been made in polite company. Steve's kisses were as intense as their first, but now their bodies were flush together, and their hands could go anywhere.
Meanwhile, Steve had been happy to hide away and “collect his thoughts and plan his short-term, achievable goals to address them” or whatever the shrink had told him. He’d even tried going through a carton of ice cream, and even if it couldn’t make him physically ill, it sure did a hell of a job of making him feel just as awful. Steve supposed that if they weren’t part of SHIELD anymore, he wasn’t required to have people tell him what his own thoughts meant and how he had to act on them anymore.
Maybe if Steve waited this out long enough, it'd turn out that he'd never had this conversation. It was all in his imagination, was what his mind had concluded. If he kept silent, then the world would arrange itself to match.
Tony clears his throat, disconcerted. “I’m not sure I like that tone of voice, like you think I’m a figment of your imagination. How about
But selfishly, he wants to relish this rare, fleeting moment with Tony all to himself, where he can be honest.
“But what was it?” Miles asked, crouching down and rubbing at his cowl, like he didn't want anything more than to remove it.
Doc Ock had stopped moving, and a robotic voice came from him instead. To his relief, Steve noticed the tentacles had frozen in place, although they were still framing Tony.
Tony goes to his car, and Steve takes the moment to wipe the saliva away from his mouth. It’s from sheer force of will that he stops his cough, but it’s not like his childhood, with his weak asthmatic body, where no matter how hard he tried to keep down his cough, so to not frighten Ma, he couldn’t help it. He’s sweating, and he adjusts his collar, but his sickness isn’t enough to ruin this moment.
“I know,” Steve finally confesses. “I know that if I just let myself succumb to the disease, that it’ll take everything away from Tony’s sacrifice.” But—he’s loved Tony for so long. His love is an anchor, keeping him forever moored at dock, overlooking the sea and hoping, imagining, the life he was made for. But the sight of the ocean, the sky, the endless horizon, is beautiful enough. Always has been. “But, Tony died so that we could continue to live, and make our own choices. These past five years, running away from my feelings, even though my body was literally telling me I couldn’t do that. That wasn’t living.”
This room was charged. The electricity here, literal and figurative, had the fur on his scruff standing on end. He raised his nose to sniff the air. His tail swept low over the floor, slow and careful. The other sleeping quarters he'd checked tonight had been proper dens, dark and quiet, their inhabitants wrapped beneath nests of warm furs, or curled around each other. It was enough for him to leave satisfied, because even if his pack wasn't all together, they were comfortable and safe.
Steve couldn't say he had ever enjoyed doing this as he picked people off. He wanted to feel more in control, more connected. Maybe that was why being the Unity Squad's handler had worked out so well.
The bed shifted when Tony rolled over onto his side. “I should have known that I’d piss you off either way,” he said, oddly petulant rather than joking, and an unexpected rush of fondness caught Steve off guard.
embarrassing to think about now, even for Steve. That secret identity Iron Man had maintained for their first years on the team.
Natasha finds out when Steve comes back to the compound, six months after he first left. He’s not planning to stay. He’s made use of his phone for the first time in months, calling in favors he used to be too proud for, to get a place in DC. Regardless, she’s the one person who’s willing to stay put, and he thinks it’s for the team. For a place to come home to, if they wish. So he owes it to her to visit, once in a while.
Tony was up on his feet instantly. “Give me one last spar,” he insisted. It made sense after they'd spent most of their session drilling—why not humor him?
“What…?” Steve’s eyes snap to hers. She’s still guarded, and distant, but she stays perfectly still as she nods almost imperceptibly.
“Oh, right, I have to report in.” Tony nodded at Steve. “Excuse me.” The faceplate slid back down. Rogers seemed disconcerted. His Tony still had eye sockets.
A long yawn greeted the two of them. “Good morning,” Tony called out as he shuffled in. From the corner of Carol's eye, she saw Steve freeze. She hummed a greeting to Tony as she turned to observe the other Captain more closely. Steve was carefully staring down at the countertop, before he let go of his freshly acquired new mug like it burned.
But the pieces began to fall into place. The armor began identifying her facial structure and comparing it to Steve's. Tony didn't need it to tell him though.
Tony smiles at Steve too, who’s lurking in the background, eyes glued to the screen like a dying man to water, and calls him over. Steve can’t stop himself from smiling back helplessly.
Steve’s sobbing harder now, so much so he can’t even hear his own thoughts percolating in his mind. Thoughts of
“I’ll think about it,” Steve conceded, and Tony finally smiled back at him, making Steve’s heart flutter.
Stay at the hospital, or the Triskelion, and they would judge him—stay at the Tower, and he'd judge himself.
And it wasn't just Carol's decidedly untrained sense of self-preservation speaking here. After everything those two had been through, it was plain as day what their friendship meant to each other. Hell, they'd come and started a new team together. Again, because there was something about those founding Avengers who could never let go of Avenging. Carol had been witness to how much they tore themselves apart whenever that something was threatened.
Tony’s not where Steve saw him earlier, so he pushes open the nearest door to a meeting room and catches the tail end of Tony’s phone call.
“So do you—” Steve cut himself off abruptly. Tony made a high-pitched hitching noise, raising an arm and aborting the motion, his equivalent to flinching.
He and Jan ended up at the mansion, right across the street from Central Park, with the rooftop pool and a training gym mid-construction. He and Tony had spent a week here after they’d married. A change of pace, Tony had teased him, and had done up the master bedroom with rose petals scattered over the bed, a plethora of scents that had made Steve’s nose itch, and a dizzying assortment of tools and toys that Steve had never heard of, let alone used, even after months of dating Tony. Their secret honeymoon had no dazzling beaches or warm, clear water, but Tony had left things to Pepper for the week and stayed with Steve, uninterrupted, so it was perfect.
“But more alarmingly, we’ve found a machine. A group of people from this era used the machine to go back to the point in time the Hydra agents are from.”
He fell uncharacteristically silent as he studied Steve. Steve kept his face carefully neutral, just as Tony kept his voice carefully casual. Steve thought, maybe, that Tony was puzzling over him just as much as Steve always had for him. It made Steve want to preen somehow, stumping even the worldly genius.
“Don't be shy,” Tony said, “I know you don't touch yourself like this. Mm, that'd be a sight, wouldn't it? Do it a bit tighter, squeeze it, right, right, you got it. See, just pretend I'm not here.”
Steve hummed. He'd figured as such. Tony hadn't mentioned having to stay late tonight, so when he hadn't shown up before the sunset, Steve figured something had come up.
The light of the reactor glows bright and unyielding. The Avengers took the opportunity to get Tony to rest after his collapse, so he’s remained in bed with the aid of anesthesia. Maybe it’s for the better. Tony would be furious if he knew about the Avengers going after Thanos, but neither would he hesitate to throw himself behind the plan. No matter how much he said he couldn’t help, not anymore, Steve knows Tony, knows that their team is only stronger with him on it.
He thinks of Tony, down in the basement level, trying to retrieve the Tesseract. He has a job to do, and someone to who he owes his life, and most of his heart to. He casts one last lingering glance over at Peggy, before turning his back on his past.
“You know how much woo-ing it takes to get a contract?” Tony had never used that tone of voice with Steve before, not even when Steve had made the mistake of mentioning Natasha to him. “I’ve gotten much more done at parties than any board meeting.”
Tony shuffles. “Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn’t bring one for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right?”
The sunlight was blocked for a moment before Gail took a seat closer beside him. “It doesn't. I know it's not the same, but don't forget that my husband also has lung cancer.”
“I see, so you become a worse kisser the more turned on you get,” Tony observed idly as Steve rolled his eyes, going back in for a proper kiss that left Tony no room to complain. He rewarded Steve by sticking his hand down his pants, and Steve nearly fell atop him.
Tony nodded, grabbing for his pillow. “You start sounding like an ass when you have several empty mansions and apartments collecting dust, and your friends insist on shitholes in Brooklyn, or are convinced that the ownership of land and property is the work of dirty, corrupt capitalists cannibalizing the Earth.”
Then Steve excuses himself to the restroom, curling over the toilet bowl and heaving up petals, a bud, and part of a stem, he leans back, resting his head against the wall, and smiling in a pale imitation of the proud smile on Tony’s face. There’s a knock on the door, and he doesn’t want to face Natasha right now. He thinks it might unnerve her more, how this might be the happiest he’s been since…since. It’s happiness, and pride, and…
“You don’t have to worry about that, Steve. For me, everyone loses to you.” Tony’s smile was honest and bright. Steve’s heart skipped a beat before resuming, rapid and alert.
Half an hour later, after Natasha makes a comment about Tony’s wedding, the one that Steve hadn’t even bothered checking if he’d been invited to, he’s heaving mouthfuls of spaghetti into the trash can.
Tony put his hands behind his head, blinking up at the ceiling. “I figured we need a bit of a cooling off period after a guy loses his family, a wife gets nearly beaten to death, and the romantic gets his heart broken. Negotiations with the government are such a slog, and military is even worse. Really now, no need for any of you to concern yourself with it.”
he tells himself. He tries not to think about the future, where the sight of a fuzzy, translucent Tony wouldn’t make his heart swell with fondness. He looks at Tony, and he doesn’t want to forget this. The pain in his chest is nothing compared to the content of his soul, where it belongs. His vision swims, and by the time Tony starts speaking, tears fall freely down his cheeks.
“You're not against it, are you?” Tony picked up the abandoned garland; it left metallic strands on his shirt. “Happy already asked for all the boxes. Think of the symbolism. That's your calling. Avengers: new family, new home. New beginning.”
Even though Steve was wearing a t-shirt and jeans, he felt exposed, put on display. If Tony kept looking at him like that it would be hard to hide just what kind of reaction it gave him.
“Steve.” Tony didn't know what about him, behind the mask of the armor and years of well-trained duplicity, signaled anything to Steve, but Steve came over and laid a hand on his shoulder.
In short, he looked like shit. Tony’s expression shifted to surprise, then to anger, then embarrassment, before settling on amusement.
“You go find your answer. Get a life just for yourself. And then come back and tell me how it was.” Tony pulls Steve’s head down to press his lips against his forehead. He gathers Steve in his arms. He squeezes his eyes shut, basking in the hug. “I’ll be here. The last time you ever have to close your pretty blue eyes, I’ll be there.”
The relief makes Steve sag. Tony’s there, arms around his shoulder. Even Steve’s body takes pity on him now, because for these few moments, every lungful of air is fresh and clear and not racked with pain.
“I’m not pissed,” Steve told him, and Tony snorted. Okay, maybe he was a little. But not in the way Tony had taken it. “You said, once, that your home was open to any of the Ultimates.”
Tony tilted his head, and now Steve thought he might vibrate out of his skin if Tony kept him waiting. Surely, Tony couldn’t be that cruel when turning down a proposal.
Pepper squints at him, and he can see the realization dawning on her. “Steve, you can’t be telling me that you don’t intend to get the surgery?”
A Bucky and Gail he never had the chance to meet, with a child in the frame who was physically older than Steve now. They’d been adults when they’d parted, but not adults like this, with a new house and a newborn and new jobs. A fresh start. He didn’t try to swallow the lump in his throat. Sometimes, he figured, he just liked to prolong the pain.
Steve wanted to say something back, to try to deny it, but what was the point of denial? His energy had been sapped from him. He looked down at his fingers. What had he done now, to bring wrath like this? He wanted the numbness back, the fugue he’d gone through, when waking up from the future, and from last night, waiting by Tony’s bedside.
Carol blinked at the door after Steve made an impressive retreat. That power walk had rivaled his runs. He'd even left without even critiquing her form or technique.
“There are many possibilities yet to be examined,” Reed said. “I assume you've made your own theories.”
“Okay,” she finally said, after Steve had downed hers in a matter of seconds. “I get it. You don’t want the small talk. Let’s talk shop, Captain.” She stretched her fingers before reaching into her bag and pulling out a newspaper. “Have you actually read this article?”
“If neither of us are sleeping, I don't see why it's a bad idea.” The more Steve spoke, the more determined he'd decided he was. “Anything that's on your mind is on the Avengers' mind as well.”
“Congratulations,” Gail said. “Is your calling on us your way of warding off our anger at not telling us?”
“Who put this in here? ” Steve suddenly asked. He frowned at the sprig of mistletoe, twirling it around like he was trying to reconcile it with everything else in there.
been a while since me and Clint have gone on a mission with just the two of us.” Natasha’s clearly basking in it, and Steve doesn’t blame either of them for picking each other for their team. “Anyway, a mission isn’t the time for you two to bare your souls to each other.”
He hadn't meant to meet her alone, but after being ejected out of the hospital ward for shouting at a doctor, then bursting into tears in the middle of the room, he hadn't thought there was anywhere else he could go. Just because Tony was reacting to stimuli again, the doctors told him, didn't mean that recovery was guaranteed. But Steve knew better than them, what Tony was capable of fighting through.
Steve had assumed Tony would be the easiest to talk to. Battle brought people together in a way that not many could understand. Commiserating in shared misery seemed like the next logical step. Steve recalled the rumor mill hard at work, about how Tony had found himself a new paramour. Maybe that’s how it was in the future Tony personified. Intense, all-consuming, like an explosion, and gone just as quickly.
“Cap. I hope it doesn’t have to come to this. Or, I hope if you do have to see this, that the fight’s won. We can go home now, and I’ll be the last one to ever have to call you Cap. That’s one thing I wanted to tell you, if this is the last thing you’ll ever hear from me. The things I have to say…is shorter than I would have liked it to be. Because let me tell you, I have no idea what to say to you, when you’re not right in front of me, radiating all those…team leader, Earth’s mightiest heroes vibes.” Tony waves a hand around and looks to the side. “Team, huh? And I hate to say it. We all found out we’d been working with Hydra unknowingly, and SHIELD was gone. But that little bit, before Ultron. That was a lot of fun. The Avengers gig wasn’t supposed to be fun. We were supposed to finish the fight, and go home. But then I couldn’t be that annoying little voice in your ear. And I know we fight alongside a god, and a genius who breaks the square-cube law when he’s pissed, and we picked up some space cyborgs and Supergirl in the process. But, you made this real, first. You—took charge, like you do, and I felt a little less alone in this vast universe of ours.”
But Tony's training simulator had allowed him to remain sitting. It was a bad oversight for their simulated villain, who had apparently thrown them into a dungeon, complete with the dank smell of dirty water.
Tony looked up from underneath his eyelashes, and Steve thought he could melt into the floor right here. He licked his lips. Tony wasn't letting up, even if they both knew Steve could put on a burst of super-strength to throw him off if he really wanted.
Tony’s head flops back when Steve picks him up. He’s light as a feather--the pressure in Steve’s chest is heavier than the weight of an asleep Tony. If he were awake though, it wouldn’t go this way. He’d be larger with the force of his personality. An awake Tony is a magnet, Steve thinks with a smile. The closer you get, the stronger the pull.
Tony stared at him, and when Steve brought the glass up to Tony’s lips, he swatted his hand away, making a grab for it.
“Tony,” Steve said slowly, staring at him until he finally could keep the laughter down for two seconds. “Please tell me that's you controlling it.”
that important to Tony; he'd always had his company to think about, whether it was an Enterprise or an International or an Industries.  Plus the SHRA. And the Illuminati, and the incursions, and Steve’s breath grew short at the thought. It had hurt to fight Tony, so much it scared him to think of just
“It's not their fault. Look at me. I have Captain America coming to my doorstep and cleaning up my shit.”
What would make him feel better, Steve decided as he pulled up a chair, was for Tony to open his eyes already.
The new nurse should have been Steve’s first clue. By the time he heard the sound of boots, heels, and harsh whispering out in the hallway and realized the shift change also came with the beginning of hospital visiting hours, he found he didn’t care much to move.
More entertaining with Tony, always, but Steve quickly realized he couldn't watch Tony's back like he normally did. That was what his other self was for. Who, despite not being hooked into their communications network, was holding his own.
“Yeah, so I should finish this,” Tony said, and he was the biggest liar in the world because he stopped touching Steve. Steve groaned in frustration, but went when Tony rolled them back over.
“Not that part.” Although Steve still didn’t like that Tony had insisted not mentioning to the rest of the team to cut it back on the alcohol on their account. “I’m sorry for making a scene with you giving me CPR. You saved my life, Tony. You’d do it for anyone.” Because that was the type of person Tony was. “Me using that for a game was disrespectful, and I shouldn’t have.”
“You should really consider making plans, for her sake. No better boy to impress the folks with, right?”
Rogers frowned, his surface-level impassivity gaining more cracks as he struggled between his future looking like, well, Steve did, and the obvious relief at not being quite so far removed in time this go-around. Poor bastard must be fresh out of the ice.
But they worked together well, Rogers making up for his lack of experience with instinct. They were fearless and confident in a way they hadn't been when Steve was with there, and the rest of the Hydra agents were disposed of quickly.
“Maybe it wasn’t the right time for this,” Jan said. “You must be scared out of your mind. I know what it’s like to lash out when you’re like that.”
Fact of the matter was, him and Sam weren't exactly on friendly speaking terms at the moment. Neither were him and Tony. Once, bantering on private comms would have been par the course for Steve with those two, though it seemed they were having enough fun on their own.
Bruce and Natasha are asleep. Steve knows Natasha’s always been a light sleeper, but she hasn’t stirred through his entrance. They’re turned toward each other, hands outstretched but not far enough to touch.
“You can take it, you’re a big boy. Speaking of which, do you really want to spend our last night together making small talk about food?”
It was how Tony worked, appreciative of beauty, appreciative of so much in life that you wouldn’t expect from the man who had everything, but he usually wasn't so unabashed over it.
Steve very much resents his enhanced hearing, and is about to turn and leave. But then he unthinkingly clears his throat to clear out the tickle, and Tony jumps in his chair.
“You’re the one who—who—” Steve can’t even say it. “So why does it matter what I think?” Steve’s not angry. He’s not questioning the unfairness of never being asked about his feelings. It’s honest, earnest, and whole-hearted. Tony finally understands the truth between them.
So far, Tony had an admittedly awkward peck on the cheek with Sam and a chaste kiss from Maria, although he prided in being humored by her.
After the failed time travel experiment, Steve has to walk away. He’s outside of the compound feeling numb. Not disappointed, not defeated, just…moments away from accepting hopelessness. He thinks that if Sam or Bucky saw him like this, they’d be—he doesn’t want to think about it, because they can’t see him anymore, can they?
“Yeah,” Rogers said, hefting his shield higher on his arm. He turned to Steve and they shared a nod before Steve stepped forward to shake his hand.
There's secrets. There's the manifestation of Reality in an glowing yellow gem, but even that doesn't feel so much of a betrayal as the room of shield prototypes and armors painted red, white and blue next door.
Maybe he'd slept in and missed it, which explained the uncharacteristic restlessness. He was much more interested in picking at his fingertips than the two untouched coffee mugs in front of him.
“Stark!” Steve was next to Tony in an instant, dropping to his knees. Tony met his eyes, but his gaze wasn’t focused. His mouth was slightly ajar, and at its corner something wet that Steve didn’t want to think too closely on. He was dressed in an open bathrobe, and the ends of the belt trailed along the floor. There were deep bags under his eyes, and he was pale, so much so that Steve wanted to bring his own hand up to his cheek, just to check the difference in their skin coloration.
Steve could have brushed it off just like Tony, and no one would be none the wiser. Except Tony, who was astutely avoiding Steve’s eyes.
After a moment, Tony licked his lips before offering a smile in return. He lifted his elbow up, and Steve curled his fingers further around his arm.
There was a slight rumbling, and both their heads snapped up. There was a loud pop, before the Thunderbolts landed in front of them.
Tony's word didn't necessarily count for much in this scenario. Steve breathed deeply. “Why was the armor taken down?”
Both of them study the fully-stocked fridge, and Steve understands why Natasha stuck to her simple sandwiches most of the time.
At some point between lives five and four, after Steve disables the armor systems and throws Tony into Lake Michigan, leaving him in a sinking coffin. After Tony is dug up from the bottom of the lake and vomits like a drunkard over the Helicarrier floor, mind dizzy with anger and the closest he's felt to hatred for the other man. At some point, Tony knows that the both of them aren't coming out of this alive.
Tony took a step back, turning. The daylight shining through the mansion's kitchen windows illuminated Steve's profile, making him glow. Tony had lived like this for years, but there was still times like this when Tony could watch Steve safely, wiping at a spill in their shared kitchen with loose-fitting clothes and mussed hair. It was these moments that'd catch Tony off-guard.
Steve can’t look at him. “You saved us. You should be proud. You gave so many people so much happiness.”
“No, it's not just that,” Steve said. “You'd understand if you knew him better. The Reed in our world respected Tony too. He's the one who gets—ideas, gets the cogs in the machine turning.” He turned his head, but Tony caught the last of a smile as he looked at the screen. “Your world is really missing out.”
“No,” Tony says. “I mean, it’s a message, but it’s getting saved until after we head out. I figure sending it now isn’t going to be doing us any favors.”
Tony groaned, pulling away from the other person. His frustration and desire was something Steve had never seen before. His face was flushed and his collar was skewed, the top few buttons unbuttoned, revealing the curls of chest hair. Steve felt something in his stomach twist with the knowledge that this was what desire looked like on Tony Stark—nothing like the humor in his eyes when he teased Steve.
“Actually.” Steve rubs at the back of his neck. “I was going to talk to you about that, and what you think about Sam.”
She found Tony rearranging his lab the next evening. He was having a hell of a time doing it, too, humming and nearly twirling through the place with his energy. She allowed herself a moment of laughing into her fist before she cleared her throat.
“Tony, answer me! Is this...one of the Earths we're facing? That we're in the middle of an incursion with?”
“I mean, now that the wedding is already over, there’s no need for this type of secrecy. Everyone gets hyped up for the wedding, not for the banality of married life and hand-holding.”
After he finished unwrapping the present, Tony concluded that whatever guess he could have made about what it was would have been wrong.
“I thought I had you pinned down,” Tony said carefully, “but sometimes I really don’t understand you at all. You know, I don’t like it when I get proved wrong, but you must delight in it.”
Tony ducked his head down from where he'd been watching Steve. He was similarly chained to the wall, about ten feet away. “It's for authenticity! Any real supervillain worth their salt would strip us bare if they managed to knock us out.”
“I am still analyzing the data, but between Captain Rogers's communications delay and what Iron Man and I have already uncovered here corroborates our hypothesis,” supplied Vision. “The temporal anomalies aren't specific to one area, but to the town in general. For us, Captain Rogers, you have not been using the comms since you confirmed the status of Sunny Lane twenty-two seconds ago.”
Steve didn't even smile, and Tony had to reconsider the inappropriate romantic needling approach. Luckily, he was the master of deflecting embarrassment, so he reached for the mistletoe.
Tony blinked, swiveling his head to look at Jan. Tony stared at her his mouth ajar, and then his lips peeled back in a smile, and Steve was struck with a sickening dread.
“It is,” Tony told him, and he was shaking now. “I said treat it like it's real! Ten minutes, and if you hadn't gotten me by then then it was lights out for you.”
“Fine. Maybe it can't be me,” because when did Tony ever come to Steve for help, anyway, “but maybe someone else can—”
More theories exist on the origins of the hanahaki disease than there are verified cases of it throughout the whole of human history. Those explanations aren’t interested in the
Steve thought about how nice Tony's skin had looked, even in the darkness of the simulated dungeon, and how much he didn't like it when other people, even simulated computer program people, touched Tony.
Tony isn't Steve, so he uses what he has. So he sells his body and a part of his soul. He doesn't think any of the men who claim him really want him as much as they crave power. They want someone whose power they can conceptualize, through how much money, or how many women, or the number of superheroes they've thrown in prison. The amount of deaths they're responsible for.
The tablet tilted, and Tony squinted down at him. He jiggled a leg, and Steve snorted, wrapping one arm around Tony's waist. He felt Tony inhale, and watched him.
“Well, darling, while you manfully protect me from rampaging beasts, I’ll work for our livelihood. So that Captain America can live in the lap of luxury.”
Carol had to snort at that. “Why not? It's not like you've ever had an issue bringing up complaints to him before.”
They fell into the kiss, two, three, and Steve lost count as he ran a hand through Tony's hair, slid his fingers across his neck and over his shoulders. They parted for half-breaths, and Steve's lust cooled from an uncontrollable blaze to its coals, an endless source that could burn, untouched, forever. Tony made soft noises into the kiss, and he went when Steve pushed and rolled them over, not breaking their kiss. He pressed down against Tony, and felt Tony hard against him, and it was being buried in high tide, the heat that ran over every inch of him.
The only time he’d heard her like that was after he’d called Hank the lowest of trash. Afterward, she’d cried in the bathroom. She’d tried to muffle her sobs, but Steve had heard her from their bed anyway. Steve still didn't understand why.
“It’s okay.” Steve doesn’t know how he could have managed for these past few days, being so close to Tony all the time without Natasha here. She’s the only one who knows, and he can’t be grateful enough for her quiet support.
After Steve died, she'd been there with Tony, as much as he let anyone be there. She remembered, even if Tony himself couldn't remember, and that was a small blessing. Jesus, Tony, and her heart still ached remembering, the self-blame, the guilt, the loss of a sense of greater purpose. But, Tony's reaction hadn't surprised her. She knew, after all, what kind of thoughts could lead to a place like that. Before, it had led the two of them to the bottom of a bottle, that self-obsession, the accusations and faults racing through her head.
Steve shot up, his heart racing. The too-small visitor’s chair toppled over. Jan had backed up to the opposite wall by now, hands up.
Steve thought that he was good at picking his fights where they mattered. The freedom and safety of the American people, stopping fascist monsters where they stood. Zero tolerance for hatred and abuse. Now, Steve chose to die on hills out of fear for what he could lose. It was because of Tony. Oh, Steve had fallen in love before, but it was Tony who had reached into his mind and turned it inside out, scrambled up all his emotions. It was Tony who had made Steve realize he was a coward.
