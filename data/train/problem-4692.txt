Dean puts down the digging bar. “Maybe it’s like some kinda mom or grandma thing and it doesn’t taste right ‘cause it ain’t them doing it?”
“Yes. It’s very strange. Do you think it’s dangerous?” Cas frowns down at the ribbon, eyebrows knitted together.
A sleek silver van with the company’s logo on its sides pulls up and stops near where Castiel is standing on the steps leading up to his house. The passenger door opens and a petite woman with fiery red hair and a big smile jumps out.
Cas tilts his head and squints as he thinks, and Dean has to dig his fingernails into the palm of his hands to not reach out and do something stupid.
They walk out to where Elaiza had attacked him yesterday. Castiel finds it difficult to grasp that it was less than twenty-four hours ago. Her body looks so small and frail where it lies in the wet grass, not at all like she would have been the root of his most frightening experiences. A slender frame. A few feet away from it, a head with dark hair that’s tousled by the heavy downpour. Wires poking out of both, no longer sparking, the electricity all fizzled out. No more artificial life in her.
“Yes, they do seem fascinating, but unfortunately I don’t know very much about the mythologies from South America. I think I need to rectify that. Perhaps it comes with my field of study, but I have more experience with the classical European and biblical dragons,” Castiel pauses as he considers what he said, tilting his head he adds, “Well if it’s possible to have experience with creatures that don’t exist in the physical world…”
Castiel looks around the garden, trying to see two different outcomes for his future. One where he keeps on as he has done for the last couple of years – filling his days with writing and reading, pottering around in the garden, and sometimes meeting his family or one of his few friends. The other alternative is similar, he would still be doing all those things, the difference is that he’s guaranteed to have a companion. Someone to spend his time with. He wouldn’t have to eat his meals alone, with nothing but the words in a book or the talking from the old TV for company. What causes Castiel to finally make up his mind about whether to continue on with the project or not, is when his gaze catches on the My CompAnIon van standing by the garage doors, glinting in the sunshine. It hits him that if he were to tell them to stop, Dean and Charlie would begin the complicated process of collecting all of their equipment, load it into the car, say their goodbyes, and then they’d get in and drive away. They would leave Castiel without the promise of a future android, and the company of a friendly and enthusiastic programmer and a handsome and considerate mechanic. Castiel would be back to being all alone in his big house.
“Next time,” Castiel promises with a kiss. Dean smiles lazily at him as Castiel reaches down to finally remove their boxers; he doesn’t get any real help from Dean who still seems to be too loose-limbed to move properly.
“You should have the blacksmith get together with Mish,” Dean says smiling, “He’s always been my favorite.”
Dean catches up to him. “Yeah I did.” He smiles, “She’s really cute and so tiny. Hopefully she’ll take after her mom and stay like that. I mean not tiny, but like, normal sized. My brother is some kind of gigantorman. Don’t know how he kept on growing after he had reached a proper size, maybe our parents fed him some kinda special fertilizer or that skele-gro stuff in Harry Potter or something, because I don’t know, it’s just not really fair when younger brothers grow to be taller than their big brothers, ya know?”
When they come into the house after the confrontation outside the shed, he makes a quick detour to the living room where he picks up his phone, and then he goes to the bathroom with the pretense of taking a shower after his run. Castiel closes the door behind him and he’s only pulled the phone from his pocket and unlocked the screen in the hopes of calling Charlie when Elaiza barges in.
“I’d liked to continue on, maybe one day. But not under him. He’s awful! He’s one of those old school professors who expects all the junior members of their team to do everything for them and to be available around the clock, all year round. Just because he has no life outside of university, he expects everyone else to be like the same. Yeah, no, that doesn’t work for me. I like research, but I need to do other stuff too, you know? So I talked with another former PhD-student, Aaron, you met him earlier, and he brought along one of his promising graduate students, Kevin, and the three of us left university and started My CompAnIon.”
Castiel tiptoes as quickly through the dining room, he turns right into the living room and the left out into the hallway. He instinctively touches his fingers to his favorite of Samandriel’s drawings where they’re all taped to the wall. It fortifies him in his resolution to get free from his android, seeing the drawing Samandriel has made depicting himself along with his uncle on a pirate ship steered by Samandriel’s koala. He has people on the outside who care about him. They do care about him, love him, he knows that they do, no matter what Elaiza says. Castiel needs to get out of here, he needs to get to his family and friends.
“Please, Elaiza, if you only want what’s good for me, then will you please be so kind as to…” Castiel is flattened against the sun warmed wall. He pauses for a moment –
Later that evening, Castiel finds his phone in the kitchen trash can. Crushed into small pieces. Unrepairable.
Castiel didn't need to be told twice. Like a whip hitting it's mark, Castiel's fist shot across and hit Gabriel's stomach. Gabriel's mouth dropped causing his lollipop to land on the floor as he toppled over and held his stomach in pain.
"That's just Charlie Bradbury," Jo explained, "Nobody ever talks to her because she's well… she's really weird."
The ticking of the grandfather clock rang through the dining room as Castiel tapped his pencil impatiently on the table. He had been there for hours at this point and he was beginning to get tired. His eyes were drooping, closing slowly as if any minute he would pass out.
Castiel read the paper and for a split second, it looked as if he almost recognized the number scrawled on it. It happened so fast that Dean had completely missed it but Jo caught it almost instantly.
When Castiel let go, Michael messed with his hair and gently pushed his brother away so he could return to his studies. Castiel made his way back down the stairs and returned to his empty sheet of paper with only one thing on his mind.
Nodding his head, Castiel slowly made his way to the open window in his brother's room. He looked at his brother one last time before sticking his head out. As he looked around, Castiel recognized the view and nervously looked down. On the floor below, he could see the slanted roof in front of his own window. Fuck.
Castiel turned the corner and saw Dean standing there awkwardly. Lucifer took this as his chance and lunged forward since his little brother was distracted.
Sighing and stepping next to him, Anna rested her head on Dean’s shoulder. Though he wanted to move, to get away from her touch, Dean had to admit it was nice to feel someone there. It was nice. But he didn’t deserve kindness like this, much less from Cas’ own family. After everything they had been through. After everything that Dean had done. He deserved to be six feet under, not Cas, not his angel.
"Cas… Cassie…. Castiel! Wake up! You're already late for school," shouted Gabriel, shaking his baby brother awake.
"Of course not, I can handle anything you can," lied Castiel but judging by the look Dean had given him, he had not bought a single word of it.
"Are you sure about that? Maybe he got sick at the idea of being seen around town with you," snickered Dean.
"I hate this place. I hate this place. Everytime we come here, something always happens to me. This is all your fault, Dean. You always like coming here but it always bites me in the butt," Jo cried, tears streaming down her face.
"Sorry Deda, some of the pieces were missing and I had to find them," said Castiel, smiling past the tears he wanted to shed.
The loud clanking of tools could've been heard miles away but Dean didn't mind that too much. If anything, he was more concerned by the sound of constant fumbling around with the wooden slats that Castiel seemed to have such a hard time with.
Castiel walked behind his gay friend, listening to the humming tunes that Dean let out. He had been humming pretty much since they got onto the trail heading to their fort and it got Castiel curious.
"That's possible or maybe, just maybe she'll actually text you back," said Sam, going into the fridge to get himself a beer too. "It would be a shame though, because the second she finds out it was your ugly mug who texted her she might block your number."
"It's still his house and you should respect his wishes. Rules are rules for a reason and they should be followed as such."
"Yes, I was actually about to listen to a story from my grandfather. You can come listen too, he loves to brag about everything he did when he was younger."
It was now lunch and the four of them all sat by the water fountains, enjoying their lunches. The summer heat was still there but with the shade of the school over them, the kids all felt perfectly fine.
"Cool, now… I think I have the perfect place in mind for a fort for us," said Dean, a mischievous smile on his face.
"Since Dean Winchester thought it would be a good idea to text random girls' numbers. Now tell me what happened," Jo whined.
The other boys even had to admit that the idea of Jo ever having children was too funny to imagine so they all laughed their asses off. Even Jo found it more hilarious the more she thought about it.
Castiel could tell by the sound of his voice that Dean had his mind made up and didn't really want to talk about it. It didn't help matters that Jo's and Benny's eyes seemed to pop out of their heads upon hearing it before returning back to normal.
"Patience is a virtue, Castiel. I suggest you learn it," said Lucifer. "Anyways, before I was rudely interrupted. I don't really know how or when it happened but the two ended up falling in love. Sick, I know.
The two boys made their way to the front of the house where Dean opened the shoe closet and had Sammy get in.
"No, she came running into the house frantically going on and on without really saying anything of substance. Naomi is talking to her right now," said Michael, picking up Benny effortlessly from the boys.
Bobby had come by to pick up the boys but before they left Dean scrounged around his father's room for cash. Instead he found something that peaked his interest even more.
"Well that depends, Gallagher. What do you have for us today?" asked Dean, a sly smile on his face as he let go of Sam's hand to look at the counter.
The boys continued to watch her from a distance, both of them trying to build up their courage to speak to her. It seemed like minutes went by before either of them even moved.
When he saw Dean, his face immediately reddened. It was pretty cute to see, Dean had to admit. He looked to be about the same age as him with raven hair and the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen. He wore this dorky looking trench coat around some old clothes that must've been hand-me-downs.
"No, it's not. Now I don't expect you to master it in one night but I do expect you to have learned how to play it by tomorrow morning," said Naomi, that serious look back in her eyes again.
"...You're right, I'm sorry for prying," Castiel apologized. He picked his knees up and held them, no longer feeling any of the warmth Dean had only a minute ago.
Luckily enough, the tall wheat managed to hide Dean much better than he had expected. He stopped in place and listened to his father's curses get further and further away from him. Dean must've stood there for what seemed like hours and when he was sure that his old man had left, he fell to his knees and cried.
It wasn't that the homework was hard, he just found it terribly boring. The idea of writing an essay on how his summer went sounded like fun but the more he thought about it, the more he was dreading to put it on paper.
Dean walked over to his phone and picked it up. When he went to his messages he saw that the mysterious angel responded.
"Castiel, I know you're all for reading but don't you think you should maybe put the book down for once and just eat in peace?" asked Jo, taking a bite from her sandwich.
"Uh… no, like I said, it's been here for far too many years to count. In all honesty, I'm surprised it was still on sale. I told my brother to take it off the shelves," said Castiel, shrugging and handing the book back to Dean.
Castiel could only let go of Dean and start to fumble with his hands again. Dean had never spoken like that to him before and to be quite honest, Castiel lacked the confidence to say anything back.
"Shut up, Benny! I do not have a big head. You're just jealous because you weren't smart enough to ever get a gold star in class," Jo snapped. She stuck her tongue out and kicked him in the ribs.
"Alright! Ow, sorry… tell you what, I'll invite him to the carnival next week," said Dean, holding his arm again.
"You need to call an ambulance, Michael. I've never seen a break like that, not even when Gabriel slipped down those ro-" started Castiel.
She looked at all of her sons who looked at each other, none wanting to volunteer. After a few seconds, Michael said he was sure he had one in the attic from when he was Dean's age he could give him.
The boys laughed as they made it to their home, putting their school supplies away and getting straight to the chores.
"Maybe she meant you two would be a thing," said Jo with crossed arms, "think about it, the sky is blue and the fields are green. Castiel has blue eyes and you have green, it's not that much of a stretch."
"We won't, you have nothing to worry about," muttered Castiel. It was true that with how busy their Father got with work and how their Mother would be busy with housework, Michael often ended up being in charge of his siblings. Though Castiel wasn't much of a handful, at least compared to the likes of Lucifer or Gabriel, he wasn't going to act up now that he finally made a friend.
Sammy just watched the both of them, disinterested. This is how all of their arguments ended, with Jo and Dean on the floor fighting for their lives. Now whoever won was the only thing that would actually change. This time it was looking like the match was in Jo's favor.
It wasn't the best way to wake up but he had far worse in the past. After about 10 minutes of scrubbing, he was good as new.
"I don't think I want to, but I did find this," said Dean and pulled out the slip of paper and handed it over to his brother.
Sorry for all the inconsistent chapter lengths, I only get a few times to actually write the damn thing so I kind of just write whatever I can get down. That said, I hope you guys like it so far.
"I get that but that's why you should probably do it with someone you trust," said Dean, "that's what Bobby told me when I asked him."
"That's different, you're not trying to annoy me when you kiss me," Castiel pouted, drying his face.
"She once ate a worm and she wasn't even dared to," said Benny. "She always does weird things like that."
Michael was trying to round everyone up to leave for school. Lucifer was off double checking his secret supply of alcohol to sell at school (how he got it, Castiel had no idea). Naomi was brushing her hair for the umpteenth time. Raphael was looking for his books, which Lucifer had hidden. Gabriel was trying to sneak snacks in his bag and pockets. Castiel was the only child actually ready, just waiting for the rest of his siblings while he played with Anna.
"That's cool but what do you think about movies?" asked Dean, clearly not interested about what Castiel's father thought about the subject.
"Really, Bradbury? You're telling me you didn't see that ball coming? You ruined our game with your fat head, isn't that right Crowley?" said one of the boys.
"I'll be what?! Naomi, I've seen you play that one before, it's next to impossible to learn," whined Castiel.
"You have no idea, it's been a blast. I tried talking Benny into coming inside but he said he wasn't comfortable with Jo around. What happened there?" Charlie asked.
The two sat there in complete silence, watching the other with what little light they had. Well almost complete silence, Castiel coughed and coughed at the beginning.
Castiel could only groan and stomped up the hill. His legs were getting sore but with the knowledge that the big surprise would be right over this hill, it gave him a small burst of energy.
"Have you ever actually met a lawyer?" Benny questioned, smiling mischievously with an eyebrow raised.
"Did not! I told you it was an accident! You're never going to let me live that down, are you?" Jo whined.
"Yeah, my old man has a lot of porn but I've never seen anything with guys doing it and I'm definitely not going to ask Bobby if it's possible," Dean laughed.
"Being honest and stupid," Castiel said, rolling his eyes and moving away, his back pressed against the wall.
"It wasn't a bad idea though," said Michael, sitting down next to Castiel as they both watched their brothers wrestle around in the water. After getting used to the thing, Dean also took part in the horse play.
It felt like forever but when the boys finally managed to make it to the road, they wanted to drop then and there. They tried to move as fast as they could towards Castiel's house.
It may have been dark but Castiel could've sworn Dean had a black eye. His right eye seemed less bright, more puffy, more swollen.
The whole group laughed and hung around together some more. They played more games, stole some food, and managed to find a psychic. Jo forced her way in but Castiel refused to go in until several minutes of Jo begging him to come with her. He said his father said such things were sinful. But Jo didn't care and dragged him into the tent to see if they had a future together.
"As long as you don't make it a point to go and antagonize people I don't see why not," said Castiel, lifting his head to look up his brother.
"I'll be here first thing in the morning to hear all about your granddad's story," said Dean, chuckling.
Dean just smiled and sat next to Castiel, looking down at the keys and running his fingers gently over the ivory.
“Whatever. You’re no fun, Dean,” said Anna, turning around on her heel and walking off. Her hand waving goodbye as she made her way towards the parking lot. “I have to open up the diner so don’t be a stranger.”
"I guess he has taught you something. Now what do you say for bullying him, Gabriel," smiled Raphael.
"O-or what about that time you tried to help repair the roof to show off in front of our neighbor how manly you were only to fall through said roof and break your leg?" Castiel piped up, smiling confidently like he was the smartest boy in the whole room.
"Bullshit," she said, trying to get the phone from him. Dean put the phone back on his ear and waited for Castiel to answer, pushing Jo away from the receiver.
"We've all done things we're not proud of, alright?" said Uncle Marv in a defeated tone. His eyes glared from one Novak boy to the other, sending some kind of threat to each of them. But it was obvious none of them really feared the old bastard enough to stop from mocking him.
"I stood over the third guy with a metal pipe in hand and right as I was about to swing it… BAM! One of th-"
"Evil demon, you are on the land of Sir Castiel of House Novak and you must leave or I'll… I'll be forced to kill you," said Castiel in the toughest voice he could muster.
Castiel shot up and immediately started to get dressed. His body was sent into a panicked state, throwing things around to look for the best clothes possible. He ran out of his room to brush his teeth, still trying to put on his shirt.
"Cigarettes? Where did you find the money to buy some?" Castiel asked, now looking more confused than embarrassed.
"My Father is a man who takes his role as a preacher very seriously. He said he named us after angels to show God his devotion to him," Castiel explained.
"You can keep it if you'd like, think of it as a thank you gift for earlier," said Charlie, pushing away Castiel's hand.
"I can hear, fat-head," growled Benny, glaring daggers at Jo, "just because I don't speak much doesn't mean I'm a bad listener."
Castiel could only nod his head, laid his hands gently on the white keys, and played. With Dean looking at him, Castiel closed his eyes to focus on the music. Maybe he just didn't like people watching him whenever he played, not even his sister and not even his friend. But that didn't matter at the point, the music spoke to him as he played. His fingers seemed to work it naturally even though he did mess up on several parts of the song. He was secretly praying to himself that Dean couldn't hear it. The only real problem was when he got past the part he was able to play and ended the song with an ugly sound of out of tune keys.
With school being around, Castiel and his friends began to take up the habit of only really meeting on weekends to play. It let them work on their studies more with the play acting as a nice reward for their hard work.
The three of them walked out of the house and to the old truck. Dean buckled Sam in and walked over to Bobby.
"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" seemed to be the only thing Dean could think of as he ran through the house, his old man not far behind with belt in hand. His dad had already gotten a good hit on him before Dean started to run away.
The taste was a new one for the both of them. The faint taste of the cigarettes mixed in with the familiar taste they had gotten used to, catching them both by surprise. Castiel pulled away and stood up, unlocking the door to the closet.
"This blows, why does the older kids' bus pick them up first," whined Gabriel, already sucking on a lollipop.
Desperate, Dean kicked with his free foot and hit his dad square in the jaw. John stumbled back, spitting out blood and lunging after Dean. The boy screamed and threw himself out the window, picking himself up and running along the dirt road leading to his house.
"Good, now come on. Take a seat," said Gabriel, sitting on his bed and patting the spot next to him.
Dean ran along the side of the road to Castiel's house, taking in the nice morning breeze. The sun was just rising over the horizon and with a skip to his step, Dean looked as if he was going to win the lottery.
"You mean like fucking? Castiel, do you even know how that's done?" Dean asked, shaking his head in disbelief.
"I was thinking about building a fort or something," Jo proposed. "You and Cas have tons of land for us to find a cool place to build something like that."
Sorry for being gone so long, life got a bit busy. But I'm back and plan on trying to update this thing more frequently. I hope you all like it
"Well at least one of us got lucky," said Dean, rolling his eyes and using his own thumb to rub mud on Castiel's nose.
"Well if you say you'll be fine, I think you'll do wonderfully at that job," said Castiel, "I know that if you put your mind to it, you'll do the best you can!"
"That's just ignorance. My mom said that if you want to get anywhere in the world, you have to have an education. Especially if you're a woman," said Jo, rolling her eyes.
He looked tired but better than before. The only thing really different about him was the large white cast on his arm.
The Novak boys all walked along the dirt path to their home, telling each other of the day they each had.
"I'll be fine, Cas. I just got into another argument with my old man. It's nothing new," mumbled Dean, his face resting in the crook of Castiel's neck.
Castiel enjoyed having his family over. It brought him some comfort knowing that no matter what he did, there would still be someone who did something far worse than him and they would still love him as their own.
Sam and Dean were used to seeing scary things, it was pretty much a regular occurrence for them. Anything horror related was a bit of an obsession for the both of them, actually.
Castiel looked through one of the old boxes and found one of Michael's old toy swords. The wood on it splintered and the paint was chipped but it still worked.
After one last kiss, Dean was on his way home with Castiel watching him from his window. When he could no longer see Dean, Castiel turned around and faced the kitten on his bed.
"What? No, what the hell are you on about? I found some cigarettes and want to try them out," Dean said in a hushed tone.
"I'm sorry for calling you a 'piece of fucking shit' Dad. I didn't mean it," said Dean. "I'm tired and I didn't mean it."
Once everyone in the congregation had left, Dean waited impatiently to go home. But the longer he waited, the more it dawned on him that he might just be stuck there for all of eternity.
When they got to the Winchester house, Dean sent Sam inside and walked Castiel to his house. Bobby said that he would be at their house for a little bit so Dean felt safe leaving his baby brother there. He had always trusted the older man more than any other adult.
"You really didn't have to, I hate for you to have to use your own money," said Castiel, the blush on his face getting a heavier shade of red as he put the money in his own pocket.
"Cas that can't be true, we're both boys and this just ain't… well it's not natural," Dean said, rubbing the back of his head.
As they made their way onto the dirt road leading to Castiel's, they were relieved to see Michael and Lucifer running up to them.
With that, Castiel walked out the front door and explored the field. They had several acres of land so he might as well explore some of it. After what had been about thirty minutes Castiel had discovered an old tree that could easily hold a tire swing, an old path the led to what looked like a shed, and a rather small pond.
"That's it! She likes to go on and on about it whenever she's here so I finally let her leave a request form for new members."
Dean tucked John in and sat on the edge of the bed, using the blanket to wipe away his father's drool.
"I can handle this, Dean. I'm fully capable of doing this on my own," mumbled Castiel, his arms desperately trying to hold the wood.
“He does have a point, Dean. You give Gabriel a competition when it comes to eating as much as humanly possible,” sighed Castiel, trying his hardest to keep the same pace as Dean.
"Of course, I don't see any reason my Father would say no. I think he might actually like the idea," Castiel said with a smile.
"I don't, I'm staying at a friend's place," said Dean, holding his hand over the phone again. "Will you cut it out? I'm talking to someone here."
"Here you go, you'll be learning Balakirev's Islamey," she said, a rather confident tone in her voice.
"Oh Dean!" Came a voice which completely ruined Dean's concentration, causing him to slip and land in the mud.
"You should all be ashamed of yourselves," Castiel said, turning his back on his friends and running to help out Charlie.
"Don't lie to me, Dean," said Castiel, holding the green eyed boy still to get a better look at him. He smirked and just hugged Dean, letting his friend sink into his arms.
Looking to his side and seeing the large wheat field, Dean darted into their unwelcoming embrace. He could hear his father's screams and shouts not far behind which only motivated Dean to move faster. Dean ran and ran until his little heart felt like it was about to burst, his lungs beating his chest.
Castiel shook his head which earned him a smile from his Father. The two took some of the boxes out of the car and brought them into the house. The second they walked into the old place, the sound of his family seemed to fill it.
"A Carver Edlund book? I haven't read one of these since I was a kid," said Sam, looking over the book and flipping through the worn down pages.
"Okay, okay. I found her number at the old bookstore on Main. It was in some old fantasy book and I figured to just text her cause why the hell not, you know?"
When Gabriel took the book, his eyes widened and a mischievous smile spread across his face. He laughed to himself as he handed the book back to Dean.
"Oh shut up. I'm going to get you a towel," said Castiel, slapping Dean's chest. He looked down at his wet hands and rubbed them into his pants to dry them off.
"I think so too," said Dean, not recognizing the tone in Castiel's voice and continuing to strum the air.
The summer heat was driving Castiel's entire house up the wall so the very first chance he saw to escape, he took it. Though spending the day in Dean's backyard and huddled under a tree was hardly the thing he wanted to do either. He just wanted to find someplace nice and cool that he could ignore the summer sun in peace. Castiel thought and thought and thought and yet nothing came to mind.
“Yeah, I know,” came his reply as he turned around to the sight of Anna. He had to admit for someone pushing sixty-five, she was looking pretty good. But now wasn’t the time for thoughts like that. Hell, it was never the time for that. At least time treated her nicer than it did him.
"I don't know if I want to be a mother, I think I might want to try my hand in owning a business," said Jo.
Dean waved back and walked over to the door, about to grab the door handle when it suddenly swung open.
"Shut up. Benny came in right as they were holding me at knife point and went right to my rescue. He shoved one of them and grabbed my hand, and led me out of the bar. If it wasn't for him, I would be a goner."
In front of him stood a boy. His light brown hair was cut short and choppy, his eyes a bright green, and his tanned skin shined brightly in the setting sun. Castiel could feel his face redden from embarrassment as the other boy helped him out of the pond. Even when he was standing up and in front of him, Castiel couldn't bring himself to speak but instead made a series of noises.
It wasn't until he ran by the window again back to his room that he saw the moon was still high in the sky.
"Cas… you're the only one with blue eyes I know," sighed Dean, trying to figure out if he had seen any girls with blue eyes.
Castiel left the kitchen and made his way up the stairs, when he walked by Michael's room. He saw the door open with Michael studying away at his textbooks. His older brother was always really smart and a hard worker, something Castiel had always admired. Not to mention he stuck his neck out for Castiel numerous times. He was the best big brother anyone could ask for. But after hearing what Lucifer had said, he saw him in a new light.
Dean could only roll his eyes and trudge over to the two. Without another word, Dean held out both of his hands to reveal a tiny black kitten with bright green eyes. It took in Jo and Castiel before licking it's paw and patting it's head.
"Castiel? What kind of name is that? It's weird," the boy said with a smirk. "Name's Dean, Dean Winchester."
"And that's an hour too long. Sammy and Benny are terrible at holding a conversation. Sammy's too little to understand and Benny… while I think Benny's a bit slow," said Jo, covering her mouth so Benny couldn't understand.
"Did you see the way that arm looked? I'm counting at least 4 fractures," whispered Raphael to Michael.
"I promised Sammy that I was going to take him to see a film today," murmured Dean, still not entirely awake.
"What are you doing, Winchester?" Crowley asked, also shocked and by the look of it, scared out of his mind.
"Yeah yeah, are you eyes closed?" Dean asked. The whole gang managed to make it up the hill with Dean's hands still held close to Castiel's eyes.
"Yeah but I don't really think I've ever done anything like getting pissed drunk and wandering all of Ocean Park beach in the nude," teased Lucifer, that devilish gleam in eyes started to light up again. He had his new prey for tonight.
“Jesus Benny, how much do you weigh?” Dean grumbled as the three of them trudged through the field, Sam not far behind.
"Oh hey, Cas," said Dean. Castiel couldn't help but smile softly as he saw Dean open the door to greet him, rubbing the sleep from his emerald eyes.
"Jo, you're being rude. You should take the time and get to know her. It would be the polite thing to do," said Castiel, rolling his eyes.
"Why are you sorry? There's nothing you can do about it, there's nothing you could've done," said Dean.
It wasn't? This was just getting weirder, who the hell bothered to give her a fake name and real number in the book? All these questions were piling up in Dean's head and he was close to getting a headache.
Dean could feel the minutes drag on as he waited for Jo to finally show up to their booth. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail and she looked as if she was just hit by a tornado. The only thing that didn't look as if it were thrown on sloppily was her shirt that read "Little Devil."
Castiel stopped and thought for a moment, his eyes focused. He had his lips pushed out and his eyebrows clenched. His thinking face.
"Language, Lucifer. Father will beat you over the head if he hears you using the Lord's son's name like that," warned Castiel, raising a finger to his lips.
At the bottom of the paper it had the name, Charlie Bradbury, in bold letters. It surprised Dean that Jo had figured out this whole thing pretty quickly. She wasn't much of a puzzle solver but when it came to tracking people down, he knew she would be a big help.
"And then what happened Benny?" asked one of the girls, her hands hovering over her mouth as if she was prepared to gasp at any second.
Soon the hours passed by and the next thing he knew he was almost done with the book. That was until he heard a faint knocking sound which snapped him out of his concentration. He looked around his room and saw nothing but he could still hear the faint tapping noise. It was almost as if someone was tapping on glass.
"Father is in his study getting ready for his sermon this week, he wouldn't even hear if a gun went off in here," said Lucifer.
"Why? You're just going to end up shacked up with some guy and taking care of the kids," Benny said flatly.
"I'm glad we're on the same page," said Dean, opening the door and heading back to the others with Castiel.
"I don't have any," said Castiel, flipping his pockets inside out to show nothing more than a ball of string.
The two made their way out of the store but as Dean was leaving, Jo stood at the door and eyed Castiel.
"And that's what makes you better than those two. You have taste," said Jo, the two of them leaving Dean and Benny to drool over Lisa.
Benny was busy showing off his cast to the group of girls, telling them a story of how he got it in a fight against four grown men who tried to steal from his father's shop. Jo rolled her eyes and made her way straight to the lying little boy.
Benny shrugged and tossed Dean the pack of matches. With a quick swipe across the striker, he lit a match and carried it deeper into the car. He could just barely see a metal object and made his way towards it.
"What is it, Sammy?" Dean said, smiling bigger by the second. Sam's thinking face always meant good things for them.
"I don't have to sit here and take any of this. I won't stand for this," said Uncle Marv, standing up and fixing his coat. His face was now bright red.
It was a three story house that at a glance you could say it looked like something out of a horror movie. Shutters hung loosely to the windows, the paint was faded to the point that you couldn't tell what the original color was, and the floor creaked an unholy sound with each step. A large empty field surrounded the house, with not another house in sight for miles on end.
Jo jumped back and screamed, almost falling out of the open door of the train car had Charlie not grabbed her.
His room was a mess so he made a mental note to try and clean it later. How hard was it find some fucking wrapping paper?
"It's alright, Dean. I'll always be willing to help you out with class if you really need the help," said Castiel.
Dean had caught Lisa's attention who was now looking at him with a blush. He smiled and winked at her.
"Apologize Samantha and then we can go," said Dean, his hand hitting the back of Sam's head in irritation.
"We have a regular who usually likes to read from there. She likes to buy as many books as she can whenever she stops by," said Castiel.
When he looked up he could see a small tear at the edge of Castiel's eye so he decided to do what any
"Thanks," said Castiel sarcastically. He couldn't wait to get out of this damned automobile and find semblance of sanity away from his brothers.
"Hmm… well if this is a girl, she has some of the ugliest handwriting I've ever seen. You sure it isn't a guy?" Jo asked, looking over the paper.
"Can you think of anybody that is usually in the fantasy section of your ever so fine establishment," Jo asked, sounding a bit sarcastic.
"Oh no, not you Cas. You're perfect as is, you act older than you actually are," said Dean, trying to cheer up the younger boy.
Dean was dead wrong. Castiel was right when he said that his father's sermons had no end in sight. It felt like they were there all morning. Hell, it felt like they were there for days at this point.
"And you two?" asked Andy, clearly tired of their presence after not even two minutes of being in the store.
"I guess it's not really all that important, you have some time to decide on a name," said Jo with a shrug.
"Suit yourself," sighed Castiel. He walked back to his bed and threw himself on his brother, causing Gabriel to groan in pain.
Benny helped up Jo with Dean helping up Charlie and Cas. Dean then hopped up and into the car with ease before struggling to pull Benny inside. Using all of his might, Dean pulled a little too hard and ended up throwing himself back and onto the other wall of the train car. He heard something metallic drop onto the floor with a scurrying sound somewhere in the darker corner of the old car. But Benny made it in and that's all that mattered.
"Something about a boy who was jealous you were kissing other boys," said Dean, laying his head against the table.
“I can see that, especially with how you swept all the dirt off of the dirt floor,” said Benny sarcastically.
Dean got back to his apartment and went to his closet to dig through it for some wrapping paper. He knew he had some somewhere, he just had to find it.
“Do you mind telling me about you two? I’ve been dying to know since forever and Cas wouldn’t ever tell,” she asked in almost a begging tone.
"He beat Michael within an inch of his life, of course. Sadly, the other boy's father did much, much worse. To this day, I've never really seen Michael have many friends like that. Hell, he barely even talks to people. Most of the time he's off doing his studies while all the girls swoon over him. It makes me a little sad knowing that he'll never even give them a second thought. And between you and me, Castiel. I don't think Father beat it all out of him."
"Bullshit! When I get my hands on you, you're going to wish you stole from Fort Knox instead," John growled, slamming himself against the door. A sloppy grin grew on his face as he felt the door budge a little. The cracking of wood sending shivers down Dean's spine.
"I don't give a fuck! The kid's too much of a pussy for his own good," grumbled John, his feet still trying to kick Dean.
"Oh… I didn't mean anything by it Dean. I'm sorry," said Castiel, he could see the pained look in Dean's eyes. Castiel never did see anyone besides Dean or Sam at the old Winchester house. He should've put the pieces together. It was obvious, right?
They all laughed and talked about what it was like in the hospital. As it turned out, his arm had five fractures and he had to get put under for the surgery. Benny told them what it was all like having a surgery and bragged about he felt as good as new.
The two boys continued on walking for another few minutes, eventually ending up at an old shed on Dean's property.
"Oh yeah? Well maybe you can tell us about some of your customers?" said Jo, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow.
"Yes, I suppose being friends with that Winchester kid is doing some good for you," said Lucifer, impressed with Castiel for once in his life.
"Oh, I'm sorry" said Castiel, shaking his head and trying to focus on the lesson at hand. Ever since Michael and Lucifer managed to work the piano into the house, Castiel's piano lessons began again. He liked them but it was at times like this that he wished he had kept his mouth shut when he said he wanted to learn at the age of five. Naomi was a stern teacher and demanded perfection. Truthfully, Castiel would rather be with Dean than spending another moment listening to his older sister berate him for not playing up to her standards.
"Yes, we're actually about to leave for church. You can come if you'd like," Castiel said, smiling at Dean's handiwork.
Tomorrow he could ask Dean if he wanted to play and then he could spend all day exploring. That plan would be a lot of fun and God knows Castiel needed it. He had already finished all of his books twice over and the summer days seemed to get longer. They could see what was in that old shed. Or play on that tire swing. Or see how large the land Castiel's father had gotten really was. Or maybe they could-
"Yeah, Cas," said Dean, nodding his head violently, "I've never heard something so pretty before. Can you play it again?"
"Sammy! I wasn't expecting you to be here so soon," said Dean, smiling and taking his brother in his arms.
"So what did you want to do today? There has to be some reason you called us all here," Jo asked once the laughing died down.
Jo took Dean's hand and pushed her way into the store, making her presence known to the guy behind the counter. It caught him off guard as he jumped back a little.
"It's true though, Castiel. Why did your parents name you and your brothers the way they did?" Charlie asked.
Castiel screamed and fell backwards, trying to catch his breath as it dawned on him who it was. He got back up and opened the window.
"No way, he would be in a higher grade had he not failed last year. Now we're stuck with him," Jo complained.
With a crack of his knuckles, Castiel began to play Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16 (in C major to be exact). He could feel his sister's judging eyes glare holes through him so Castiel just closed his own eyes and focused on the music at hand. He had played this song hundreds of times for her in the past and each time she looked at him as if it were his first time even touching a piano. But his family always did try their best at anything they put their minds to, so it doesn't surprise him that Naomi had such high expectations for him. Though he did wish she could be a little easier on him.
The older boy got up and walked over to Dean, handing him the raincoat. When Dean tried to take it, Michael's grip refused to let go.
"Really? Because I couldn't tell with all of the 'I missed you, Cas' or 'you're perfect, Cas'," teased Jo, smiling devilishly.
Before they knew it, visiting hours were over and they all said their goodbyes. They all left the room with Jo being the last to leave.
"Hey Benny, you still carry matches on you?" asked Dean, picking himself up and patting the dust off of his pants.
"Good so um… which room is your's?" asked Dean in an attempt to change the subject before he started blushing.
"I have my suspicions about you and your own little friend but they're only suspicions so I'll leave them be as it is. I just wanted you to know in case you ever felt the need of bringing up the rules to me again like that, that you would have much more to worry about than anything I am doing," said Lucifer, looking at his fingernails with boredom.
The ringing of his doorbell made him jump and ended up knocking his head on one of the shelves. He cussed himself out and walked over to the door, still rubbing his head.
"About time you picked up," Jo whined, "Charlie is at the Roadhouse and she's driving me up the wall."
Tonight, Mrs. Novak had made a full meal consisting of ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, steamed vegetables, bread rolls, and the faint scent of a chocolate cake could be smelled from the kitchen. Dean had never seen so much food in his life, let alone his own kitchen. It surprised him that Castiel's father had all the money for this from being a pastor. Though he would later learn that it was customary for all Novak children to get some kind of job to help support the family.
Jo instantly stopped crying and moved over to pet the little thing with Charlie coming in close second to get a better look at the thing.
Dean looked up and he could see Benny walking up to Lisa and taking her by the hand. The two walked away with Benny looking behind his shoulder to stick his tongue out at Dean. All the green eyed boy could do was sigh and turn his attention to the person standing in front of him.
"We'll have to go back to the scene of the crime," Jo cheered, throwing her arm in the air triumphantly.
Castiel could hear his siblings all fighting over which room was best and who got what (even Naomi and Raphael got involved), his mother could be heard in the kitchen, and an old record seemed to be playing from what would soon be the living room.
"But the weird thing is that she says she doesn't even remember putting her number in any book and that the name it was written under wasn't her's."
Dean sulked in his seat, praying to god for the first time in his life to have the sermon end already. He could've sworn he already had his first chin hair grow by now.
"It's not my fault, Jo over here likes to take her time getting a move on,' laughed Benny, earning himself a slap in the arm from Jo.
The boys continued to sit at the corner and enjoy their treats when an old truck pulled up. It was Bobby, a friend of the family, who asked them all if they'd like a ride back to their house. The boys could all see the sun beginning to set and without much of an argument or discussion, they all said yes.
"Michael would go on and on for hours about this boy. He was like a puppy who would only ever think about its owner. It was cute, really. I've never really seen him as happy as he was then," said Lucifer.
"Yeah, little buddy. Ellen's got food ready at home," chuckled Bobby. Sam smiled at the idea of a warm meal.
"Well you better be careful, I don't want to even think that you two are up to no good. I already have enough on my plate with Lucifer, Gabriel, and Raphael," said Michael, that cold look in his eyes again.
"That's surprising, I figured he would've been repulsed at the thought of being inside a church," said Michael, walking down the stairs and fixing his collar.
"She said I won't find love until I find the one with fire red hair," Jo gagged, "Who in the hell has hair like that in this town?!"
"Yes, I like spending time with you. And Sam seems to be warming up to me," Castiel said, giggling a little.
"See! I told you I knew I heard something," shouted Gabriel, the loudness and shock of the whole situation causing Dean to jump into the pond to hide his naked body but not before the Novak boys all saw him.
"Can't. My old man is already mad at me most of the time; the last thing I need is for him to get mad at me for sneaking in an animal," said Dean, shaking his head.
"I knew it! Sam, don't you think it's weird how Dean talks about his friend?" Jo asked, turning her attention to the little five year old.
There was that one time when he and a girl in his kindergarten class 'dated' but the most they had ever done was share their snacks. And the next thing you know, she broke up with him the second his snacks were all gone. Maybe Dean wasn't as popular as he thought he was.
"You can probably tell it isn't very easy for Castiel to make friends. It's not a talent he possesses. Hell, I would say it's a talent he manages to repel so many kids his own age," said Michael, glaring down at Dean. "But he likes you and you stick around. Don't misinterpret that as I like you. I think you're a bad influence on him but I'm letting you stick around because I know he needs friends."
"That sounds dangerous, are you going to be okay doing that?" Castiel asked cautiously, tipping his toes in the water to see how far he could take the conversation.
The two of them made it to their fort not much longer after that. The old shed stood there with a rather grumpy looking Benny sitting right outside of it. Ever since the incident with his arm, Benny refused to take a single step inside the thing. Especially if Jo was anywhere near him.
Castiel lifts his eyes from the diagram. “Well it’s called ‘Developments in Architecture in Middle Europe between 800 and 1150’. I think the title explains the content rather well.”
Dean flushed at the memory. It had felt so wrong and things had been really awkward between them for a while after the kissing incident before they had decided to put it behind them. He grimaced. “Yeah, sorry. You’re right.”
“Au contraire Cassie boy, I think this is hilarious! Naaaw, I see that it’s shrunken a bit, hasn’t it? I guess that’s your doing Dean-o, cutting it off so many times? T-t-t-t-t. I was so generous with the length of my pretty ribbon, almost five feet is a lot further than the normal distance between the two of you. But of course you couldn’t help yourselves and had to get closer to each other. That’s actually kind of sweet, but I must say, I’m a little disappointed that you figured it out so quickly. It would’ve been so much fun if it had shrunk more…”
There’s a shimmering soap bubble of hope growing in Castiel. He tries not to, he’s not meant to. Not now. He has Elaiza. He should be content with that.
“Yeah, the snow was perfect. It was great actually. It’s nice to spend time with family and do something fun, you know? But there’s like a limit on how much time you can spend with your parents and younger sister before you start to go a little bit crazy. Just glad I convinced them to let me have this paaartyyy!” Victor hollered the last word and the kitchen filled with loud whoops in response.
“It was incredibly thoughtless of you to break out like that, Castiel. I do not want you to do that again. Do you hear me?”
“Castiel, I cannot leave you. I am your companion. I bring you companionship. I am programmed to love you. I love you. I do. No one will ever love you like I do.”
“So, the dowel. I think I can fix it, just needs to be straightened out a bit, but I don’t know if I got something that’s heavy enough in the toolbox in Baby’s trunk to fix it. Do you have anything? Like a big heavy hammer or something like that?”
Hands on his face. Warm. Soft touches and rough callouses. Castiel opens his eyes and his field of vision is filled with tawny brown and green.
Dean helps him up, but once he’s up, Castiel can’t take his eyes off Elaiza. “I-is she really g-gone?” he asks with chattering teeth. “She won’t…?”
“How can you be so calm? I’m in the car, on my way to Castiel’s, you want me to tell the AI turn and pick you up on the way? We need to find a way to stop the virus in Elaiza!”
“That seems to be correct. I have now checked 40.358 gardening resources in 147 languages for their advice on planting fruit trees and the subsequent care of them.”
“Castiel! No, that won’t happen. You are nothing like her! You’ll meet someone and even if you don’t, you won’t turn into Great Aunt Naomi.”
“What’s the matter, Dean? Don’t tell me you’ve seen this so many times you’ve grown tired of it. I know it’s your job, but it’s so amazing to see her come to life,” Castiel smiles at him.
“I need you to understand that even though she has warm skin and an added scent that works like the scent of a human body and even an extra perfume when that feature is activated and she is able to express ideas and thoughts, she is not a human. And she never will be a human. She is still a machine. There is no warm blood in her, no pulse, no heartbeat. There is no sex in her, while she will be able to, um, be a companion to you in that way as well, there is no human or animalistic sex drive in her, she won’t be able to take any kind of initiatives unless you train her to do that. As I said, she is still a machine. A long line of cold, hard code.” Charlie pauses for a moment, possibly to make sure that he is still listening and taking in what she says. He nods and she continues. “Albeit dressed in a soft squishy humanlike covering, but again, it’s a machine and you need to understand that. At My CompAnIon, we have already seen countless of examples of people who have fallen in love with their companions. It is not something the company speaks of officially, but from what I know, none of those have ended happily, so my advice is just be careful. Okay? Think of her more like a friend or a sister.” Charlie tilts her head to one side and looks like she is contemplating something. She adds, “though that might make the intimacy a bit awkward…”
When they stepped out onto the street, Dean realized that Cas had been strangely quiet for someone who was trying to count someone else’s freckles. He looked at Cas who made some very weird facial expressions, it looked almost like he was trying to lick his own teeth.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel gives him a small smile, trying to convey his gratitude, and Dean returns it. Castiel keeps his eyes on him as he walks back to the garage.
“If you do not wish to have me then I shall make sure that you may never be able to have anyone else either,” she says. Her body is small and slight, yet she somehow manages to tower threateningly over him.
“No Castiel, they do not. You are all alone with me. As it should be. I am your companion. I am meant to be with you. Always. I am your eternal company.” She’s so close now.
“Very well. Stay here,” she disappears and Castiel breathes more easily. He stays in his chair, eyes closed, box breathing to calm down. He flinches at the unexpected sound of the front door slamming shut. He rises and walks quietly to the kitchen. Elaiza isn’t there.
“Hey there, you must be Mr Shurley. My name is Charlie Bradbury and I’ll be your programmer for this adventure. And over there is the man who’ll be managing the nuts, screws, spanners, and whatnot, Dean Winchester, the mechanic,” she gestures to the car, where the driver is still sitting in his seat, thumbing rapidly on his phone. “Dean come on, work time!” she shouts at him before turning back to Castiel and continuing “Sorry if he’s a bit distracted today, his sister-in-law went into labor this morning and he’s waiting for news. He’s generally quite charming. Well, at least when he wants to…”
“So what do you do Castiel?” Charlie asks as he hands her milky coffee in a blue cup. Dean accepts his own black coffee with a mumbled “Thanks” while staring on his phone screen again.
“Why, that would be Samuel of course. He shows a much greater propensity for the magical arts than you do Dean, surely you must know that.”
“Yeah, I know buddy, I know. Anyway, research has shown that cars driven by artificial intelligence, whether that be androids or AI built into the cars, are much less likely to be involved in accidents.” Castiel nods. He remembers hearing a lot of talk about that bill on the news, the discussion had been intense and  for a few weeks it had felt like every single think piece in the media had mused about if this would at long last lead to the end of American car culture. Charlie continues, “And that’s amazing, right? We get safer roads and potentially we’re even freeing up some time. I mean, if you can spend your commute to work in the backseat working instead, then the time spent at the office could be significantly reduced. Or for people with kids, they can make better use of all that time schlepping the offspring to and from their activities, either by being able to more fully interact with their children when they don’t have to pay attention to the traffic, or they could simply let the android transport the kids and stay at home and do other things. Just think how many potential sleep ins when parents don’t have to get up only to drop their kids off at school!” Charlie’s enthusiasm for the possibilities of androids shine through in her happy sigh, Castiel looks away from her and meets Dean’s eyes. They share a quick smile.
“Right. Of course,” Castiel says and pauses for a moment and sips at his coffee that has finally reached a good drinking temperature. “Well I think that I actually have an area that would work for your needs as a mechanic. You see, when my great uncle retired, he turned to his other great passion in life, collecting and restoring old cars. He had a garage built so that it’s connected to the house where he could store his beloved cars and tinker with them in the workshop area. I don’t know if he actually managed to get any of them to work, but he enjoyed it.”
“Hey Charlie, Cas got away. We stopped it just in time. Though, gotta say Cas, that was the scariest shit I’ve ever seen, seeing it tower over you like that,” Dean says and shudders, he wraps his other arm around Castiel to, enveloping him, warm and comforting and so very much alive.
“I’m still not Meg. I was supposed to fall asleep when he got here. Castiel’s here and I’m not asleep. He’s the one sleeping, it’s not fair! I’m so tired!” she whined.
Dean looked at Cas. Loud counting was now coming from the house. Before Dean could second guess himself, he leaned in and pressed his lips to Cas’. He felt Cas tense and Dean wondered if he had done something really, really stupid and ruined everything just because he lacked self-control for a moment, but then Cas melted into him and started to kiss him back. The shouts of ‘Happy New Year’ came from the house. Dean finally tore himself away from Cas’ soft lips and leaned his forehead against Cas’.
She takes a step closer, chrome gray eyes glinting menacingly in the sharp bathroom lights. “What did you just say? I am not an electronic device. I am your companion and therefore I must be where you are to keep you company.” Her hand closes hard around Castiel’s phone. “Now, Castiel, my dear, have your shower and then we may go to the kitchen and I shall make you dinner.”
Castiel doesn’t have a moment to himself. He has no possibility of getting away from her and no way of contacting anyone. No phone. No internet. No way of smuggling out a letter via a delivery person since all his groceries and supplies are restocked by AI deliverance services. His only hope is that someone will somehow drop by unexpectedly.
“Threatening me, are you? Still no. Maybe I’ll give you a clue or something when the first draft is done, as a thank you for the gate,” Castiel says, “What about you? Any plans?”
“Fine.” Dean grabbed the sandwich Sam had brought him and took a bite of it on the way to the shower. “But you better wake me up when I’ve had my four hours.”
“Mmm yeah. Can’t wait. Already drawin’ up plans for that. And the next time. And the next. And also the one after that. Might have an idea for the next one too,” Dean says and then he asks, “Is the leg still doing okay?”
“I see, then Rosalind really is the perfect name,” Castiel says and smiles. “She was always one of my favorites too. It’s a very sweet story, my sister Anna has a similar one, only she met her husband Michael in high school. They went to different schools, but their best friends were dating so they were almost forced to spend time together. They couldn’t stand each other, until one day something clicked, and they fell head over heels in love with each other.”
Dean looked down at Cas, he really did look like he was sleeping. Sleeping peacefully. Maybe he should just let him be? Dean shook that thought away as soon as it appeared, no damn it! He was going to be selfish for once in his life. There had to be a way… What if…
This time when he sees a car drive away, there’s someone standing next to him and he doesn’t feel as hopelessly alone as he has done before when people leave his house. He turns to his left where his new android is standing. She turns to him with her light gray eyes gleaming in the late afternoon sun. Castiel smiles. The next part of his life is about to begin now.
After Gabriel has disappeared, they stand there, side by side, in the quiet kitchen. The only sound is the hum of the fridge and the occasional creaking from the bunker’s old heating system.
“Yikes! Dude, no. Just no. That monstrosity does not deserve to share the space with these beauties!” Catching himself when he seems to realize that he is talking down to a client, Dean winces and backtracks. “Um, I… I’m sorry Castiel. I didn’t mean to… I’m sure it’s a nice car…?”
“Okay, I figured you’d say that. It needs to be done in a place that is significant to you, significant to Cas.”
“No. Thank you, Dean. I assure you that I am quite well” he said and took a small sip of his beer. Dean felt a bit robbed of his neck staring opportunity, but then he saw Cas flinch at the coldness of the beverage.
Castiel sighed. How could he deny his best friend anything? He never could, and it had only gotten worse in the past year and a half. Ever since he realized that he not only had a crush on his best friend but was in hopelessly love with him. They had been down by the lake the day that Castiel’s feelings caught up with him. Castiel had been sitting on a blanket, trying to concentrate on his book and listening to Dean and Sam laughing as they had chased each other by the edge of the water. Dean had flopped down on the blanket next to him, water droplets coming off him and landing on the page of Castiel’s book. Castiel had looked up at Dean. The sun had hit him, making his green eyes sparkle in the light and emphasizing his new freckles that had come out in the summer sun. He had said something but Castiel hadn’t heard a word, too distracted by the boy in front of him. It had been like he had never seen Dean before. Dean had needed to repeat himself two times and ask if Castiel had been alright, before Castiel had registered that Dean had been asking about going to go get some ice cream. Castiel had tried to blame being too engrossed in his book and an unexpected plot twist in it, but he hadn’t been sure if Dean had bought it since he had kept looking questioningly all the way to the ice cream stand.
Dean looks deliberately over what’s visible of Castiel’s body, the parts that aren’t covered by the brown towel. He swallows and takes a step closer. “Me too.”
“Okay,” Castiel says, even though he’s not entirely convinced about all aspects about AI security, Charlie’s reassurances are still comforting. “But what about those in Japan? When they started the first super AI, what if it had gone wrong?”
“Ah hmm. Yes. I was just thinking that maybe I’m not comfortable with having you in here yet when I’m sleeping. Or you know…” He shrugs.
“Yeah, she was so good, and best thing was when she baked pies with the things she grew! Dude, her pies were amazing! I have her recipes, but I’ve never been able to get them as good as hers.”
Castiel watches as Charlie has Elaiza pick up and set down various things, repeat words, move in different ways, and see if she can connect to a network to reach information she asks for. Castiel is completely enthralled, it’s truly remarkable to see something mechanic awaken. He tears his eyes away from where Elaiza is making a pirouette under Charlie’s guidance to look for Dean. He finds him standing fifteen feet away, his arms crossed and a small crease between his eyebrows.
He cleans them too, with the same gentle car as he cleaned the one on Castiel’s leg and the one on his face. When he’s done, Castiel is shaking again, skin pulled tight and pebbling, a puddle is forming around them on the kitchen floor. Dean suggests that he’d take a shower, and then, if it’s still needed, they can patch up his leg, no point in doing it and getting the bandages wet in the shower.
“Yes, I’m aware of that by now, but you know damn well that I’ll continue to ask you not to.” Balthazar’s sudden laughter is loud enough for Castiel to wince and move his phone a little bit away from his ear until he hears that it’s starting to quieten down on the other end of the line. Balthazar has never truly learned good phone etiquette; he laughs too loudly, he keeps the phone pressed to his face even if he needs to talk to someone in the same room or scream orders at someone he works with, and one unfortunately memorable time when he’d talked to Castiel, he had even brought his cell phone into the bathroom. Castiel had hung up the moment he realized where Balthazar was.
“Yeah, I did say that, but I didn’t mean that you’d do it now. I wanted to be done with the draft first. Have you changed anything?”
“But don’t you understand? I’m tired of waiting! It’s been almost three years since April broke it off with me and I haven’t met anyone since. I feel too old to go out to bars to meet someone and I don’t understand those dating apps. I don’t want to be alone any longer,” Castiel scratches at a mark in the wooden table and looks down on the floor where Samandriel is talking quietly to his stuffed koala and drawing something that looks like an orange dinosaur riding a rocket ship among the stars.
Dean takes a sip from his cup and continues. “When I was sixteen, our parents left us home alone for the first time. They had saved up money for years to go on a honeymoon, they never had one when they got married, so they saved a few dollars here and a few there. They had enough money for a bargain trip to Barbados in the down season. They left and I tried to take care of Sammy best I could, I cooked for him and helped him with his homework, and I tried not to blow all the food money they left us on pizza. They called once when they were there, and it made me miss them so much. Being in the kitchen with Mom and in the garage with Dad, but they sounded so happy and relaxed.” Dean smiles, but it’s small and sad. “They were supposed to be gone for a week. But they never came home again. There was an accident. On the way back, the plane broke down somehow and crashed. They died.”
Right. Cas wasn’t just a little out of it, he was a lot out of it. Dean flushed and the receptionist giggled as she handed him the receipt.
When Dean got to the room, Cas and the dentist stood on different sides of it, glaring at each other. The dentist was clutching at her hand.
“Good. There you go. Just like that. In and out. In and out…” Dean’s voice turned into a quiet whisper.
“Yeah?” Castiel feels the bubble of hope expand in his chest, he could be on his way of getting out of his writing slump and Balthazar’s positive reaction to his possible solution means a lot to him.
“Thanks man!” Dean ran down the stairs again and through the kitchen where Bela smiled dangerously at him and tried to stop him, but he tore past her out the French doors. The doors slammed shut behind him as he stepped out on the patio.
“It’s not really the chimneys I’m after, I’m looking into the construction of forges during that time and how people worked in them and what they knew about metallurgy. I’m not sure how much of it I’ll end up using, but as I said, I enjoy the books and articles. Maybe I should call up one of my old friends from the faculty and see if she has any tips…” Castiel gets lost in his train of thought, perhaps Hester has a good book recommendation, after all her field of specialty was the professions of ordinary people in the high middle ages.
Dean finally gives in and stirs, his face is half smushed into his pillow and half pressed against a body. A body in his bed? What? That can’t be right, he doesn’t bring anyone home to the bunker, that’s way too dangerous, and besides it’s been an eternity since someone caught his eye at a bar or anywhere else for that matter. Dean lifts his head. Cas. That’s why the voice was so familiar even though he was basically still asleep. He groans and lets his head fall back down on the pillow, forcing himself to move away from Cas. Just a little bit, he doesn’t seem to be able to go very far away from Cas.
Castiel reaches for another sandwich. He swallows the piece of bread in his mouth and yawns. With each bite of his sandwich he slides a little further down in bed. The sound of the long-awaited rain and the warmth radiating from Dean’s body help him to finally relax. His eyes drift close,
They don’t find anything that Dean deems fitting enough in the garage, but on the wall with tools in the shed there is a variety of sledgehammers. Castiel has never understood why you’d need so many different sizes, but Dean seems pleased and picks his favorite. As they turn to go out of the shed, Dean stops and lifts up a heavy metal stick that’s leaning against the wall in the corner by the door.
Castiel likes it, it’s a pretty name so he is surprised when Charlie starts to laugh. Dean grins at her reaction and says, “Right?”
“All right. That’s it, let’s go cut this eyesore off before we turn into freakin My Little Pony or something. Then we can figure out what happened.”
Castiel is sitting in front of his computer, unable to concentrate on the scene where King Mish and the still unnamed blacksmith test out their magical contraptions on a captured Demon. He can’t concentrate since Elaiza insists on hovering behind his right shoulder. He wishes that she would leave him alone. Only for a few minutes. Just so that he’d be able to concentrate on his writing. Castiel is beginning to feel suffocated under her constant surveillance. She follows him to the bathroom. She stands next to his bed during the nights and his fruitless attempts to fall asleep. She comes with him when he takes turns in the garden, which is the only fresh air and exercise she allows him these days. Not having a moment to himself is starting to take its toll on Castiel. His desperation, his lack of proper sleep, and his permanently tensed body make him feel like he’s losing track of time, he can’t remember how many days it’s been since he saw another human being. The fact that he’s incessantly being watched and relentlessly monitored under never-ending vigilance is almost beginning to plant a tiny seed of doubt.
No. No, it can’t be right. She’s standing too close. He can feel the artificial heat from her body. He wishes that she would leave him alone. He can’t breathe and she needs to go away.
The voice is deep and very familiar, it feels safe. But it’s so insistent and Dean doesn’t want to do what it says, he wants to go back to sleep and see if he can find that blue color he saw in his dream again. He protests and tries to bury even closer to the warmth.
“No. I ain’t calling Sam about this. Firstly, he’s having a cozy weekend with Eileen, and I don’t even want to think about what they’re doing but I know that we shouldn’t interrupt them,” Dean shudders and hands Cas a cup of coffee as he looks sternly at him, trying to get Cas to realize that they can never reveal this to Sam. “Secondly, if we were to tell him about this, that you showed up in my bed and that we’re tied together by a shrinking pink band with glitter on it? Sam’d laugh until he got a hernia, and we’d never ever hear the end of it. So, no Cas, we ain’t telling Sammy about this. Never ever, got it?” He holds Cas’ gaze until he nods back at Dean.
This time, Castiel can actually hear her answer. “It’s not fine! I found what’s wrong and it’s really really bad! A virus! So so bad!” she shouts so loudly that Dean removes his phone with a grimace. “Dean, it’s so far from good that it makes walking into the Shelob’s den to help her prep for her blind date with Aragog seem like a better thing. And you know how I feel about spiders!”
“Pirates of the Caribbean, seven films so far, plans for at least three more. The first one from 2003 is considered to be a bit of a cult classic and well-liked by most, the rest seem to fall in quality.”
Dean walked. It felt like he had walked for a week. Or it could be twenty minutes. It was hard to tell when he couldn’t rely on his senses.
Meg-who-didn’t-want-to-be-called-Meg slowly got down and put her head on the improvised pillow. Dean looked at her and then at Cas and then at Meg again, before he bent down over Cas and carefully removed his trench coat. He put it over Meg, tucking her in.
“Yeah, there are some people and organizations that are basically throwing money at the research teams, and I thought of continuing on. They offered me a position after I’d done my dissertation, but it was in a group led by this horrible man.” She pauses. ”He’s on the news sometimes talking about AI development, maybe you’ve seen him? Zachariah Adler?”
It’s a little after four o’clock when Charlie says that they are almost done for the day. She sends Dean out to the van to make sure that they really have everything, just to double check she says. Dean leaves the garage grumbling about that they always place things exactly the same on the floor before they start and that everything they need is already there. Charlie makes a shooing motion and tells him to ‘be a good handmaiden and do his Queen’s bidding’.
“We’ll get to the bottom of this, Castiel, I promise. Aaron and Kevin are still at the office looking through the coding and software of every android we’ve ever produced. We need to make sure that what happened to you won’t happen to anyone else. Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” She throws herself around his neck and holds on tight. Castiel pats her back.
“Yes. He was incredibly persistent in wanting to see you, saying something ridiculous about returning a book. I hardly think that he reads. In the end, I did tell him that he had come in vain, so he left.”
Somewhere, deep inside him, there’s a voice telling him to turn around and run away again. He pushes it down. He wouldn’t get away.
He is on a walk with Elaiza in the surrounding forest and when he offhandedly wonders about what species of bird they can hear chirping from a nearby Douglas fir; she immediately finds information through her network links and tells him all about the spotted towhee – its breeding behavior and its distribution, its conservation status and its interaction with other species in the ecosystem. He thanks her and laments over the disadvantages of not having any musical talent and therefore constantly forgetting the pitch and melody of songs birds, she makes a remark that he doesn’t need to remember them for himself anymore if he doesn’t want to. She is there to help him. He smiles at her, watching as her dark hair gleams in the glade’s sunlight.
That evening, Castiel had paced back and forth in his room, trying not to panic. Falling in love with his best friend was such a bad idea and it was such a high school cliché that he had felt his cheeks burn red when the realization had hit him all over again. But it wasn’t like he could just as sudden fall out of love with Dean and he didn’t want to risk the friendship, so after he had considered his choices, he had decided to suppress his feelings. It hadn’t been easy, and he had spent the last eighteen months pining and feeling jealous when Dean flirted with someone else or went on a date. He had told himself a million times that he was over it, that it was behind him, but then Dean smiled and Castiel’s breath caught in his throat and his heart flipped in his chest.
Dean raised an eyebrow and walked over to Jo, whispering in her ear. Jo didn't look too impressed by the idea judging by the look on her face. In fact, she looked even more judgemental than she was a minute prior.
It was just five dollars but he guessed it wasn't worth the hassle of running into trouble for stealing something like that. So he rang the bell and waited.
The rooms had already been taken and that left Cas with one of the smaller ones on the second floor. He didn't mind in all honesty. The room had its fair share of problems. The paint was old and chipped away, it needed an overall deep clean, and he could've sworn there was a hole that a mouse kept popping his head out of. But it was the perfect size for him and he liked that he had a window next to his bed that let him watch the sunset. To Castiel, that's all he needed to be happy.
While Sam went on and on about how cool he thought the Wolfman was, Castiel just listened and nodded his head. Dean took this as his chance to take what was left of his change out of his pocket and got to thinking.
Castiel turned on his lamp, opened up the book and began to read. "Chapter One. One day when Pooh Bear had nothing else to do…"
Now this really had Castiel's interest peaked. What would Dean have to show him that everybody else needed to see also?
Castiel just nodded and looked at the little five year old who was holding tightly to Dean's free hand. His dark brown hair was a shaggy mess and his clothes looked a bit worn out. They had to have been hand-me-downs from Dean.
"Hmm? Oh, nothing! You might want to be careful, if she's such a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons she might not be the kind of girl you want," warned Jo.
"This sounds so amazing! I've never read this one before," Castiel said, trying to hand the book to Charlie.
"Mm-hmm… well, he likes the Ten Commandments. My family would watch that in the theater back in California," said Castiel while he remembered fondly of the days that he and his family would spend in those theater seats to watch the sea part before Moses. He was always awe-struck and for the longest time thought that the film really captured a miracle only to be led on by Gabriel who finally had to explain to him the magic of special effects and editing.
"But if it is possible, I wouldn't mind having my first time be with you," said Dean, smiling softly.
"I got it covered, Sammy. You know I would never let Dad lay a hand on you," comforted Dean, pulling Sam into a side hug.
"Father has some paperwork and meetings he needs to do while Michael is in charge of counting the tithes, and Naomi makes sure everything is clean and ready for next week," Castiel answered.
Dean jumped back and went straight for his window, opening it. He took one last look at his door, wiping away a tear from his swollen eye. The bruising began to set in.
The moon was high in the sky and Castiel found himself looking out of his window, enjoying the night breeze. He could see the road that led to his home and along the way he could see another house in the distance. It's lights were on and he could see Dean outside, playing with another little boy on their porch. Cas smiled and laid down in his bed.
No matter what Dean tried to do, Benny kept on groveling on the floor. The sweat poured down his face as he groaned in pain.
"Just put the book down, Cas. We're all talking to each other and we hate seeing you out of the conversation," Dean said, taking the book from Castiel's hands and placing it on the ground next to him.
"I don't know, Cas is a bit weird so it would make sense that their friendship would be weird too," said Sam, thinking about the whole situation.
Dean just stared at Castiel, his face getting red and his eyes looking at Castiel's lips. Had Benny, Jo, and Sam not been there, Castiel had an idea of what Dean might've done. Dean started to use it as a way of saying thank you or goodbye or hey or even just to surprise Cas. A kiss from Dean was becoming really common for Castiel but the blue-eyed boy would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy it every time Dean pressed their lips together.
She didn't remember putting her own number in a random ass book? Dean thought that if he did something like that he would probably remember doing it. Maybe it wasn't her who did it? It did seem weird but Dean didn't want to put too much thought into it.
"Yeah, I made a bet with a friend that if one of us kissed a girl first the other would get a dollar," Dean chuckled, cleaning Castiel's face.
"Don't say it, if you say it then that's basically admitting defeat and I refuse to lose to Jo," growled Dean.
Castiel talked on end for as long as he could. It felt relieving to just tell someone how he felt about Dean, he never had anyone before to talk about it. Gabriel just smiled and listened, occasionally putting in a little joke here and there. Before you knew it, Castiel was rubbing his eyes and yawning. The idea of sleeping slowly creeping up on him.
"Do you hear something, Raph? I think I hear a rat squeaking," said Gabriel, pretending to ignore his baby brother.
Castiel made a weird face and tried his best at cleaning off the mud but still ended up with a little bit of dirt left. When he finished the younger boy could see Dean walking off and ran up to him.
His thoughts were cut short when they both looked up at the sound of an old truck pulling up. The sound of it's exhaust popping could be heard even over the storm.
Dean starts when Cas knocks on the connecting door, and then pushes it open without waiting for an answer. If it was locked, it would probably be locked from the other side. Cas is down to his shirtsleeves, and he looks tired in the lamp light, older than he should, and Dean is struck, not for the first time, by how he seems to be aging right along with them.  He hasn’t been able to bring himself to ask about it.
