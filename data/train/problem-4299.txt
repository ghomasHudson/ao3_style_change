“Just....... tell Dean to have a good day, and not to worry about when he gets back. I will find another apartment and be out of his way before he returns. Just tell him to have a good time today.” Castiel turned and put his duffle under the bus. He glanced back at Sam one last time before he boarded, everyone gave him space as rejection emanated from the man in waves.
With Cas in his room, Dean rushed to the door to see Sam standing there, arms folded with his most intense bitchface. “You
, Castiel was never more thankful for having his own room than in those moments. It was like an unreachable itch underneath his skin. He could take the edge off, but he knew the only way he could be truly satisfied would be if his green-eyed Adonis were the one with roaming hands.
“Will you be here for every run?” Castiel asked the question trying not to sound too hopeful. Spending the time with Dean made him feel more like a person and less like property or an object. Spending the time with Dean he was just another kid in a secret hideout.
A nurse crouched in front of Sam with a hand on his shoulder.
“Thank you Dean-o, and for your joint cooperation, turn to your right and lift the first lid.” Gabriel pointed and they both turned just now noticing that there was a row of covered dishes just behind the bar.
“You threatened to burn his record collection? That’s pure evil bro. Anyway, you forget I work at a bakery and that mans core weakness is pie. If you can wait a whole day there will be his top 5 favorite pies delivered fresh baked and still with an apology note,
The next summer Dean and Castiel get married in a garden surrounded by wildflowers, Pies and all of their family. Dean will never admit it, but if you look really close at the photos Charlie took, you can see a few tears in his eyes when he finally gets to kiss his husband.
The information that she found wasn’t much and it wasn’t too promising, but it was something. She had found police records, records from juvenile detention and records from a mental institution.
Having already worked it out with his professors, Castiel took all of his final exams early. None of them wanted to risk him going into labor while he was in their classroom. Castiel was walking out of the campus bookstore when arms wrapped around him covering his eyes. His whole body went rigid and fear began radiating from him.
Dean gave Castiel one last kiss on his cheek and hustled out of the room. He knew if he left it for too long those two would try to start on their own making the mess he’d already signed up for exponentially worse.
Dean walked into his apartment he still shared with Sam---- “Four years, Sam!! Four years and these idiots still can’t get their heads out of their asses and just get married.”
“Oh, I know!!” Claire screamed way louder than necessary.
“Deal”
“Don’t worry I’m sure they’ll love learning the art of pranking from their uncle Gabriel.” Castiel wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
The house was neater than he expected. Usually leaving the three of them at home all day would have him returning to find the living room overtaken by a pillow fort. Or remnants of some at-home science experiment gone awry. The day they tried diet coke and mentos was the worst.
time. He had been waiting for 2 hours, no missed phone calls, no messages. Cas finally gave in and ate his food, drank his beer and got ready for bed. He plated Deans food and placed it in the refrigerator. At least whenever he gets home he can have something nice to eat.
two chapters in one day?!?!
“SAM!!! Are you even listening?!?!?!” Deans voice screeched through the phone almost making Sam drop the phone in an effort to save his eardrum.
Much to Cas' surprise Dean got up and walked towards the stage grabbing the acoustic guitar before taking a seat on the stool placed center stage.
Unknown to him Castiel was watching his every move beaming at the joy on his face and in his scent. Castiel looked as if he was staring into the sun with adoration.
“So I’m going to take a stab in the dark and say its no longer needed for me to disappear over spring break?” Both in the guilty party nodded. “Good, now I’m going to pack for my road trip, and you two are going to apologize, and I mean NOW!”
They spent the rest of the night watching Marvel movies on Netflix and cuddling in a nest of pillows and blankets on their bed.
“Don’t worry baby you’ve got this. I just listened to that presentation 4 different times and I’m still intrigued.” Dean pulled Castiel in close and started to pump out as many comforting pheromones as possible. Castiels body slowly went from rigid to lax.
“Dean I don’t know what or who made you believe any of that stupidity, but you and they are completely wrong. Dean! You are an amazing, caring, and beautiful person. You have such a wonderful giving personality and that is why you have such close friends that you refer to them as your family. You’re strong and ooze confidence. You claim to be barely hanging on when you and I both know that you are in the top 10% of your class.” Dean was struck mute at Castiels speech. He had no idea that Castiel saw him that way. ‘
Gabriel sat there staring at the brother that made it out. He wasn’t broken or destroyed like him or Luci. He walked into this room with the purpose of telling Castiel who he was, and where he came from. Lucifer their older brother at a young age had a psychological meltdown and in his moment of insanity had killed their parents, hospitalized Gabriel and almost suffocated Castiel. Gabriel had protected him until the police arrived. Lucifer was living his days out in a mental institute in Florida. Castiel was blessed not to remember the ordeal. After looking into his blue eyes and listening to that speech he knew it was best left unsaid
“Hey Cas, what’s up?”
Gabe grimaced, he remembered the worn omega that had shown up on his brothers' doorstep, the man Castiel had made it his personal responsibility to rebuild. Even if in the end he would be heartbroken and useless for anyone else. How they couldn’t see that they were perfect for each other was beyond him. Idiots belonged together, now they just have to make them realize they deserve it.
That night was another campout. The boxes had all been placed in their respective rooms and the furniture set up accordingly, but Castiel just did not have the energy to unpack anything before the morning came.
Was it his own desperation or his own shaking hands but Dean could’ve sworn he felt Castiels hand twitch.
“We’re all going to get them through this together. We are a family, and we are there support system. We can be there for them in more ways than donating body parts.” Sam helped Jess pin-up her hair as she slid in the tub.
“Now I don’t know your whole situation, but I can tell you this; money is great, but it doesn’t keep you warm at night. Money won’t sit and watch movies on a Saturday night, money won’t make you soup when you’re sick, money won’t be there to share your joys. So, tell me, son, what’s more important? The money or your family?” Cain finished his drink, tossed a $20 on the bar and collected his bags.
“Oh really Dean? Tell me, if you could do anything to me right now…would you?” His chosen girl of the week embraced his flirtatious ways not knowing that at this point in the night he couldn’t even remember her actual name.  She looked up at him with her midnight blue eyes, not quite the color his heart desired, but close enough. “Youll find out soon enough, let’s get out of here and go back to my place.” Dean wrapped his arm around her waist and led her out the door to his precious Impala, his baby.
“Now you hold on just a minute there. I don’t know where you think you’re going, but if the answer ain't getting back in that bed then we are going to have a problem.” Castiel was ready to argue but was leveled with one solid glare from the nurse.
Dean walked to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water, weekend or not, hangovers were no fun. It was only then that he noticed the note, ‘
“Dean, Cas isn’t cheating on you, he’s sick.”
“Fine I’ll handle the cleanup but you owe me.” Charlie leveled him with a glare.
Cas looked anywhere but at his husband, his guilt for not sharing his condition earlier was only getting worse, but this was not the time or place for that discussion.
Dean and Cas had been through hell and back, their marriage tested, and now they were embarking on a whole new adventure and starting a family. Life for the Winchesters could only get better.
That’s what friends are for, and brothers of friends
Dean walked in and dropped on the couch,
And you know I ain’t good at this stuff
She looked up at him with big blue eyes and placed one hand on his chest. Yet, looking back at her, Dean felt nothing… in fact he couldn’t even remember her name. “Sure thing sweetheart, I’ll give you a call.” He smiled at her stepped back into the apartment. “
Cas’ ringtone echoed through the house as Deans phone sat on the coffee table. Dean ran out of his bedroom in nothing but his boxers, leaving behind a sleeping Lisa to get to it before Cas ended the call. “Hey Cas, …Yea no I understand….there's no rush….I’ll see you later then.” Dean kept is tone cheery and carefree, but his disappointed scent betrayed him.
“….And he didn’t mention the extension I’m guessing….I’m sure he’s just trying to figure out all the details before he talks to you about it.” Sam tried to smooth over the situation, which he just realized was worse than he’d previously thought.
Castiels’ eyes became comically large.
Charlie is leaning on the desk talking with what looks like a new client. Dean sized him up before he got to the desk, short, animated and he looks like he’s trying to flirt with Charlie, Dean chuckles thinking how bad this guy is wasting his time. Must be some spoiled rich guy who’s too concerned over their car.
“Really, you’ve been talking to Charlie about me? Like you don’t have enough going on in your own life” Sam rolled his eyes but continued. “Yea Dean we’ve been talking about you, only because we’re concerned. You’re working like it’s the source of your oxygen and with everything, Cas is going through we worry.” Sam leaned back against the counter and just waited.
“I umm got us an apartment right off campus, and I got a job already waiting for me when we move. I told you I was going to take care of you and I meant that.” Dean pulled Cas into his lap, the same way they sat for so many hours in their little hideaway.  After what seemed like a forever silence, Dean pulled a small box out of his pocket.
“Dean…..Dean please at least let me answer you before you keep yelling.” Sams' shoulders slumped a little, his guilt all coming to a peak. “Dean, look I couldn’t tell you. Between doctor/patient confidentiality and Cas making me swear not to say anything I couldn’t tell you.”
Don't Be mad at me
Cas watched the clock, time ticking away.
“Well Winchester, are you going to sign? I haven’t got all night.“
“Hey Dean, I know this trip is usually just for you and me, but have you ever thought of….I don’t know…inviting someone else to go along?” Sam stepped back from the map and grabbed the dart out of Deans hands. It was a metal dart that would surely leave a hole.
What he hadn’t expected was he was openly dating Gabriel and that small omega was honestly impressing him and showing him new things every day. Dean had taken care of him before but this level of care, doting is the only apt description of what he was experiencing now.
“Plus last time I left it up to you to come find me, we didn’t leave here till almost midnight and that’s only because I came looking for you, and found you asleep with your face in a book.”
to die. He wasn’t even competent enough to accomplish that.
Dean strolled into the kitchen for a glass of water, napping always made him thirsty. “Sorry ‘bout that. By the way, have you seen my phone? I gotta check in on the shop.” Dean was leaning against the counter watching Jess chop the vegetables. He couldn’t help but think of how good a mom Jess was going to make and how Sam was a lucky guy.
“Wait, Sam, you said a moving company, where are they moving to?” Dean hadn’t tried to call home since he’d left on such frayed terms. He figured they could take his last two months to cool down, he’d come home and it would all work itself out.
Castiel kept talking unprompted. He had to give it to Dr. Barnes, there was something about wearing out his body that gave him clarity in his mind. Thoughts weren’t so jumbled up by emotions he wouldn’t or couldn’t express.
“Sam? Sam knows too? Well, what is it, Charlie? What is it that apparently everyone knows about my husband that no one felt the need to tell me??” Dean was starting to let his anger overtake his concern. Cas was his husband if anyone was supposed to be the keeper of his secrets it should be Dean, not Charlie and definitely not Sam.
Would a divorce really solve his problem? His problem was that he was lonely. He missed his husband, he was tired of being a consolation prize.
The two sat in companionable silence for some time.
“Aww, Dean don’t tell me the little lady is giving you problems? I thought you were old school like me, not one of these new age equality blah blah blah people. You wear the pants in the marriage just show her who’s boss and she’ll be eating out of your hand.”
Once upon a different life
“That is your highness to you, my good handmaiden. I am discussing logistics and strategy, you can wait for your queen inside.” Charlie waves her hand at the door chuckling as Dean bows and continues on his way. Sam just rolls his eyes. Charlie grabbed Sams arm before he walked reached the door. “Come with me, Sam.”
get you in too much trouble with your moose of a man so just chill. Let the Queen handle it.
He skimmed through the brochure a little more before hopping in the shower. He was pleasantly surprised that the towels were fluffy and soft, almost like drying off using clouds. He looked at the bottle of scent blockers peeking out his bag, then he pushed it down, it’s his vacation if people didn’t like the way he smelled then too bad for them.
“Hmm, that does sound good. I know just the place.”
“Okay, all is forgiven. Point me to the chocolate river.”
“Sammy!!! You are not gonna believe what happened.”
“Talk about what? Talk about how I’m a terrible husband? I drove Cas to do this, it's all my fault. Or how about I’m a terrible father? Aiden barely speaks to me. Claire isn’t old enough to really put it together but she’s starting to realize that I’m the reason Cas isn’t around. Pretty soon she’s gonna hate me too.” The self-deprecating speech was running on a loop in the back of his mind at all hours of the say since being kicked out of the hospital by his husband. Papers or not Castiel was his husband.
thank you again, I would have been claimed by now if not for you and sam
Aiden looked up at his dad and for the first time in a long time. “Dad? Can you read me the bedtime story about Horton?” Aiden hadn’t asked for that story in a year or two. It was a story he only let Dean read to him. Dean locked eyes with Sam and they both had tears in their eyes. Aiden had just shown him a level of acceptance that he hadn’t had from his son in a long time.
“Dude I saw you a few days ago, so we both know that excuse is crap. Plus you’re all fidgety meaning there’s something that you want to talk about you just don’t want to be the one to start it. So, I’m gonna say some keywords and we’ll go from there.” Charlie watched Dean do everything to avoid eye contact. Whatever it was, he was most likely freaking out over nothing.
The guilty look on Deans face and the way he shied away after their brothers left only makes him believe that his presence made Dean uncomfortable, but when they were on the couch they were practically cuddling while watching Deans most recent movie obsession.
Then there was one that Castiel couldn’t remember. The woman he was looking at seemed very familiar. Standing there in a wedding dress, with tears in her eyes. Those bright eyes.
Castiel is familiar with solitude, he’s been alone in one way or another for his entire life, or at least that’s how it’s always felt.  The only son in a house full of women, his dad, for most of his youth was a ghost in the house, he knew he was there, but never actually interacting with the one son he had.
“Hey Cas, I missed you last night. I got home with some good news about the shop and you weren’t here.” Dean tried to sound inconspicuous, but he couldn’t help but wonder if his husband had been out on a date.
“Hello?” Sams' voice was little more than a grunt. Dean looked at his watch, it was like 2 am where Sam lived. He hadn’t thought this through he just needed answers
“Relax Sam, the doors aren’t actually locked, but they are booby trapped.” Charlie went on to explain that there were speakers all around the roadhouse to make the sound effects believable. “They can walk out anytime they like. The better question is why haven’t they tried?”
“Wrong Winchester” Cas simply winked as he walked out of the room to enjoy the rest of his graduation party.
The door to the bedroom blew open under the force of two hyper children.
What Castiel hadn’t expected was to walk into a spotlessly clean house with dinner already been prepared.
Castiel refreshed their mugs with coffee, his sweetened with a little honey and a touch of milk. Deans just black. ‘
Later that week Cas would show back up to his house with a mating bite and an engagement ring on his finger. He was only there to collect his things. They already had an apartment waiting for them right by his college campus. Cas was free to live his life the way he chose and he fully intended to do just that.
Cas rolled his eyes, an action no doubt, learned from his time around Dean.
Dean had mostly tuned out the conversation in an effort to concentrate on Aiden. He still wasn’t quite settled into space so Dean pulled out his favorite snack maybe that along with the action figures he was already playing with could help him settle.
“Well, I don’t really agree but I can’t force you to stay Cas. Just let me know when the bus leaves and I will make sure we get you to the station with plenty of time.” Castiel nodded the direction of the door as Sam walked out.
Cas stood off to the side and let them have their moment of hugs and kisses and ‘I missed you’s.
This was going to be a slight problem for Dean. Lately, he hadn’t been the best at keeping his more adult dreams under control. Recently he has been having very sultry and down-right pornographic dreams or should we say fantasies, about Cas ever since he went all righteous fury and yelled at him. There was just something about seeing him that way that did things to Dean that he….
“Dean Winchester I told you that pudding ought to be gone. Now you sit down here and eat.” The nurse walked back in with a tray of soup broth for Castiel to attempt. Next to the bowl of soup was a sandwich and chips, no doubt more food she planned to force on Dean.
Deans days, however, seemed to only get darker. As much as he had believed in the past that he was really doing the best thing for his family, it had become so glaringly obvious that he had turned out to be more like his father than he ever wanted. He had become so obsessed with his own issues the family as a whole had suffered. Castiel had been pushed to attempt suicide and clearly still harbored such rage toward him for things that he hadn’t even thought about. Things that he only considered to be affecting himself, not those around him. He was so obsessed with making money for his family that he hadn’t had while growing up, he forgot about the things that really mattered. The things that really bothered him, like his dad never being around, leaving him and Sam to basically raise themselves. Dean had done the same thing, only his other half wasn’t dead, Cas was there every day trying to hold together the family that he had taken so easily for granted.
“So…..what had miss perfect running off?” Charlie glanced over at Cas while they walked to her car.
The day at Hershey Park was tainted, every funnel cake Dean bit into tasted of regret, every rollercoaster ride just felt…empty. Dean knew exactly what,
“Daddy isn’t that great at bath time, he got water in Claire's eyes and that made her scream. So I asked to come downstairs before them.“ Castiel couldn’t help but chuckle at their oldest, he was always very frank in opinion and never hid his thoughts.
“Anything you desire my queen!” Gabe said over his shoulder.
“So…how did it go?”
“Good now. Better. I can't have you both laid up in the hospital.”
“Gabe I need your help. I don’t know what I was thinking agreeing to go on this trip. It’s only the first day and now I have to share a room with Dean. I don’t know what to do.” Cas flopped down on his back with the phone to his ear desperate for any type of assistance or advice.
“Seriously Dean? That’s how you answer your phone? What if it was someone like your boss?” Sam rolled his eyes, he was leaning on his desk in his office, he had a few minutes before his next litigation meeting.
Pleasantly surprised, they didn't even have to order. Jo was working tonight before she started up karaoke night and brought them their usual minutes after they sat down.
have on pants.
“Yes, a transplant. As I said there are a few steps before that so don’t panic. Although it would be wise to be prepared.
“Why would you make a terrible mate?” Sam looked at the loaded question. Those two out in the dining area were easily two things
“Well said Red.” Gabriel giggled at his own rhyme. “but first we have some major damage control to do.” The two knew exactly how to apologize and set out to make it happen
The duffle bags were packed and being loaded into the trunk of the Impala while Castiel stood off to the side and watched the brothers argue about practically everything.
“Well, if this is what we get, I say we cooperate. If nothing else we get a free lunch out of the deal.
“You didn’t? Sams' voice perked up in shock, maybe excitement. “Dean you need to get home now.” Sams mind started going a mile-a-minute. If Dean didn’t sign the papers that meant that Dean hadn’t chosen his work over his family. Castiel was about to move those kids back to the coast near him and leave Dean behind based on the wrong information. “Those aren’t the only papers Castiel had me handle. He had me update his will, Dean he named me to take the responsibility of the kids in case anything happens to him.” Sam stayed silent for a moment to let that information sink in. Castiel hadn’t been doing well, he’d seemed sullenly resigned lately. Sam figured he’d be able to see them after the move as he wasn’t going to be too far away from them.
“No, buddy I didn’t know that. Can you tell me what you did in class today?” Cas loved the way his son could create and discover in Minecraft, but the fact that he always was so absorbed by it worried him, was Aidan losing himself in the game to fill the hole left by his father not being there?
“Hello, Dean….yes I am fine….I just have an idiot for a brother…..yes Gabe is back in town….I will tell him…goodbye Dean.”
…..I would do whatever I could to show you how much you mean to me, and how much you matter.“ Cas knew that it was still difficult for Dean to discuss.
“I don’t even want to know, just don’t call me for bail money.” Cas pinched the bridge of his nose after he put away his jacket. No one said a word so he turned and headed to the kitchen for a bottle of water.
Hold back the river so I
"Hush Sam, if they do she'll be the cutest girl ever. Deans green eyes, with Cas' dark hair. I can see it now." Jess put a hand on Cas shoulders.
Castiel woke up early the next morning not afraid, just resigned. He’d lost his temper, said and did many unforgivable things. The note waiting for him was a clear sign that he was about to get kicked out. Not in any rush to be shown the front door Castiel slowly packed away the few personal items he had amassed in his time there, had breakfast and sat in the common room.
“Do you think that it worked? Do you think he will be happy when he wakes up?” Jess sat close to the window trying to contain her emotion.
*****
"Must be doing something right
“I know we all want to see them get their heads out of their asses and just get together already, but
“Huh?”
Castiel laid up that night unable to sleep. He was battling his self-destructive mind. No one knew that he had tried to speak to counselors about his daily mental battle. For a while he was fine, everything was great. He had a loving husband, two wonderful children and a job that basically made him Willy Wonka. (Well in his mind anyway). Now he was getting divorced, possibly losing one or both of his children.
“You got me Cas, but do you want to meet up after? Maybe go out and celebrate? It’s your last peaceful moments before your family descends on the town for graduation” Castiel stood from the stool and considered Deans proposal. “Sure Dean. We can either go out and celebrate or we can drink to forget. I will see you after my presentation I need to go prepare.” Castiel bent down and kissed Dean on the forehead before getting in the shower.
“Castiel tell me, do you believe that you are ready to try and have a session with Dean present?” Pam sat on her yoga mat with both legs tucked under the opposite thigh. Castiel finished his round on the punching bag. Then he met her face to face as he sat on his own mat. “I think I have learned enough that I can.” Castiel had minor flashbacks to that day, the amount of anger and resentment that he’d held inside for so much time. “I want to be able to gauge both of you, to understand not only what kind of mentality we are dealing with but what I need you to be prepared to deal with in the future.” Pam made this statement with the most kind of intentions, however, Castiel took offense. Dean may have been mistaken in his actions but Dean was still the man that he loved and the father to his children meaning that Pam did not have free reign to talk about him in any manner.
“I’m just saying bro, I’ve been there to witness the heart eyes when you think he isn’t watching, which he isn’t but that doesn’t mean that Sam and I don’t see what’s happening here. I’m just looking out for you bro, I don’t want you to get your heart broken.”  Gabes hand rested on Castiels shoulder with a firm squeeze.  He found it hard to believe this was really about him and not about the infatuation his brother had with the younger Winchester.
“He what? Sam, he hasn’t touched that will since Claire was born.” Dean took another deep gulp. He’d caused his husband such pain was there any way he could get back the man he loved? Of course, he didn’t say any of that to Sam, this wasn’t a chick-flick moment.
“Just sit your butt down this is a celebration dinner for you and your great presentation”
Castiel was stuck somewhere in limbo. He could tell that he wasn’t dead but he also wasn’t completely alive either.
“I’ll make an effort to not let it happen again.” Dean Suddenly found his fingernails interesting. Picking at them as he always did when he was nervous or uncomfortable.
from the top of the list. Important enough to warrant a negotiation but not so infamous that they had their own body count of ‘contractors’ who had attempted their capture.
The two-day drive happened and ended with Castiel on autopilot. Normally, he would have made the trip last a week. Sam would meet the moving truck at the new house so that they could unload, and he would turn into what Dean always called a ‘true road trip’. Walking into the new home Castiel almost felt…numb. This house was everything that the kids wanted. They were close to the water, Sam was nearby meaning his dog Bones was always a willing playmate. Most important, by getting there early meant that he could sign his updated will just that much sooner. It would all be over soon
When the dam breaks you don't get to control the flow
That’s how Cas found himself alone again in a new state with no friends and a husband halfway across the world.
“Castiel, he presented as an omega last week.” Sam stared at his brother with bitchface #4 like that completely explained everything.
Sam should have said something!! Yes, he could admit that he hadn’t bothered to call his brother lately. Lately being the last month but
Castiel woke up trapped in what could only be described as a labyrinth of arms and legs. He’d forgotten about this part of having his husband home. He reveled in the warmth and embraced the wonderfully domestic moment before the madness of the weekend. Looking beside him he took in the relaxed almost child-like appearance of his husbands face.
Sam rushed into Dean’s bedroom dragging Gabe with him. Lisa was just starting to wake up. Sam grabbed her pants threw them at her and told her to put them on. His tone left no room for argument.
?” The wheels were already beginning to turn in Gabriel's head. “Yea…..now that I think about it, kidnapping and tying them up till they talked does seem a bit extreme.” Charlie finally chimed in. “and as Sam pointed out, also illegal.”
After they walked in Dean noticed things were off, first, they didn’t get their normal booth, not too unusual it had been a while since they were there on a Friday. Then Sam happened to be there, weird considering Sam hadn’t gone to the roadhouse for a meal since he’d gone full-on vegan and hadn’t had a Friday off in over a month.
“Dean!! We’ve gotta help him!! Tell me you’ll help me save him!! There’s got to be something we can do!!” Dean jolted up at the sound of his door hitting the wall while trying to keep up as Sam spoke in rapid fire. Sam was on the brink of tears with his puppy dog eyes already in full force. Not fair
Dean read over the whole contract again just to make sure that there was nothing new added, having a brother for a lawyer made him extra wary when it came to signing things.
After the first few lines, Dean realized all of their closest friends were a part of the crowd. ** Well now is as good a time as any. Definitely better than I would’ve thought up**.  Dean just went with it, relaxed into it and really started singing from the heart.
After Charlie watched Dean practically march out of the shop, the first thing she did was pick up the phone. The secret was out; the least she could do was warn Sam that he’d be on the receiving end of Deans wrath sooner rather than later.
Castiel and Gabriel talked about the new developments in their budding relationships until Dean came back home. Instead of being forced to witness the sickening adorability that was their relationship. Dean talked about his paper and complained that Gabriel used all of the peanut butter and he was having a serious craving for some peanut butter cookies.
"I hope you liked your gift, I mean I know it wasn't like your favorite song or anything, and I probably could have practiced....." Dean was rambling still somehow nervous and embarrassed standing right in front of Cas.
I just heard you sigh
“So…..are we not going to talk about how you’re making Castiels favorite foods or….. “ Dammit why couldn’t Charlie leave well enough alone.
Sam stood there looking at how much thought Castiel had put into making this trip amazing for them, not for them
“So we will give you two about 5 minutes to decide who takes the first question. Don’t try to escape, the doors are locked and if you try to pick the locks Gabriel, our resident trickster, has booby trapped them all. May the odds be in your favor.”
“Probably a good call, I like all of your
As they sat hand in hand waiting for the doctor to come for them, Deans nerves began to get the best of him.
It didn’t become obvious to Sam or Dean what was happening to Aiden until one day they both received a phone call from the school. Aiden had a meltdown in the middle of the library and refused to move from the spot in the middle of the floor. He wouldn’t talk beyond screaming and the counselor didn’t know what to do.
Castiel placed his phone back down on the counter top and cleaned up after himself, he was always a considerate guest. Luckily, after the first few times Dean caused Castiel to flee his own apartment, he began keeping spare clothes at Gabes. It was quite convenient over the past year, although every time he used those clothes…his heart broke a little more.
Cas trudged up the stairs emotionally numb.
Cain smiled and Cas slightly chuckled at that thought. Dean had the biggest heart of anyone he’d ever known but when his husband was angry, it was almost like the wrath of God.
It was only because of this that Dean even bothered to apply to college, but only the colleges that Cas applied to, he was going to follow him and protect him until Cas told him to go away, whether it was brotherly love or something else that was the force behind the desire, Dean never took the time to figure out.
They were immediately seated and placed their orders.
“Did you forget your key again Cas?” Dean turned off the vacuum and jogged over to the door. When he snatched it open, he barely hid the look of shock on his face. “Lisa?” With a hand in the center of his chest, she pushed him back into the apartment. “What are you doing here I thought..”her lips silenced the end of that sentence.
Cas tried to get up and head for the bathroom, but Dean only held on tighter snuggling into his shoulder.
“Keep it up and I just might pay for your culinary training myself.” Castiels boss pats him on the shoulder as he leaves for the day.
After his graduation party, Cas went out to meet up with Dean. What he didn’t expect was to be driven to a candlelit picnic by the lake. “You know for someone that says they don’t do chick flick moments, this is a very chick flick set up here.” Cas stared wide-eyed at the scene in front of him. “I guess you just bring it out of me Cas, what can I say.” Dean gave him an almost predatory grin before he leaned in to kiss his boyfriend.
“Castiel my baby boy how are you doing?”
Dean was lighting a few candles after closing the windows when Cas walked out of his room. Dean practically tripped over himself trying to walk closer.
Charlie was thinking it but never said it.  Dean continued on rambling what he felt was a justification for his request.
Had he really said that?
“Sorry about that, but they’ve had that baby shark video on loop since lunch. Now I can hear you. Did you and Sammy have a good day?” Dean glanced at his watch and noted that it wasn’t later than expected and he still had a little more time before taking dinner out of the oven.
This is not what he expected. Pearly gates? Angels on fluffy cotton candy-like clouds playing harps with halos floating above their heads? Or maybe hellfire. The smell of burning flesh and constant shrieks of terror and pain. He could have and happily would have taken either. What Castiel didn’t expect was silence.
Dean saw himself waking up to Cas and the kids in the kitchen, maybe a dog or a cat, definitely a house pet of some sort. He would kiss everyone bye before he went off to work. He worked somewhere that was very physical, he wanted to work with his hands. Construction, mechanic, carpentry, it didn’t matter he just didn’t want to be stuck behind a desk somewhere.
By the time he finally went home the house was dark. There was a note on the refrigerator telling him there was a plate waiting for him. Dean peaked into their bedroom, Cas had been curled up in bed for at least an hour or two, his book still resting on his chest. he could only wait up for so long.
“No, they answered. It just seemed as though mom had been possessed by an actually enjoyable person.”
Castiel danced around the punching bag releasing a fury of blows until his arms ached.
As the day turned into night, the drinks went from spiked to straight shots. The more alcohol in his system the more freely Castiel would share his feelings. Tossing back the next round. “Gabriel you don’t un..under…stand, Dean is perfect. He…He’s not sub….submi…he doesn’t take shit from anybody. He won't admit it, but he’s a genius. Since he moved in, I’ve never called maint….mainten…he fixes everything. Dishwasher? Fixed it. Bathroom sink? Fixed it. Broked the ceiling fan? Fixed it. How could someone that amazing want someone as awkward as me? I can’t have him the way I want. So I will gladly be his friend. Yea it’ll hurt when he leaves. But somethings better than nothing.” Castiel scent was proud yet depressed at the same time. He was broadcasting his feelings for anyone in a 50 yard radius. He was obviously proud and boasting about the omega. Also so depressingly sad and pining as he was convinced Dean would never be
So now we have come to the end of this emotional rollercoaster. I hope you enjoyed going on this journey with me.
“Cas you act like I could leave you for even a second right now. I’m not going anywhere, angel.” Dean pulled the small couch next to Cas bed and laid out getting comfortable for the night.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank goodness its Friday then, I usually let the kids stay up late and since you’re here you can be the one to get soaked giving them a bath. I’m going to take a long hot shower. We can all stay up and watch a movie together afterward”
Dean got up, hopped in the shower and got ready to start his day. As he walked out to the kitchen, he could hear Cas on the phone clearly talking low enough he didn’t intend to be heard.
Gabriel kept walking as Cas stopped in shock. He’d never taken Gabe for the sentimental type. He knew Gabriel loved him and was protective, but this was new. He was the only family Castiel still kept in contact with so as long as he would be there Castiel wouldn’t turn him away.
After a day or two of merely going through the motions, he became proactive. First things first, get a normal job. Something physical, something manual. He wanted to keep in shape but not take away extra time with the kids to workout. Thinking about his skills, how much time he was willing to be away from the kids on a daily basis and a few other factors let him narrow down his options.
“Gabriel, what are you doing? Unlock the doors and let us out!” Castiel wasn’t even sure that he could be heard but it made him feel a little better.
“Dean Winchester, would you do me the honor of becoming my mate?” For a second there was complete silence, long enough for Castiel to think he’d be rejected. Just as he went to rise to his feet Dean smashed their lips together with such love and desperation.
Sam sat in his office looking over Castiels file for the 5
She knocked on the door and poked her head in. “Cas they have a spot for you, sweetie, we’re going to go and take a look around in the morning.”
Charlie: Hey Can you meet at the roadhouse
Sam stayed at the threshold, he didn’t have time to stay all night, Jess needed him home. “Oh also, it's not your same pills but they work just as well but no rebound period.” Sam handed over the prescription bottle and turned to walk away. He felt a renewed hope blossom in his chest, now with Dean in the loop they could get Cas through this.
“I didn’t think we were that bad, I mean so what we did a little making out at the bar…its not like its anything you haven’t seen before Red.” Dean popped a few white chocolate chips in his mouth and pulled the crumble out of the oven to cool. He wont bake the cookies for a few hours, ”
Charlie toasted them all on their last night out as a group. Dean and Cas just rolled their eyes. Gabriel almost choked he was laughing so hard.
“Pam says that I’m doing pretty good. Oh, that’s my therapist by the way.” Cas noticed the confused look on Sams’ face. “She’s...unconventional to say the least.” Cas thought about his initial response to Pam and her punching bag, workout, yoga mat, and Zen garden. He barely gave her a chance in the beginning, but she was his last chance.
Rant completed Castiel turned and stalked back to his room slamming his door. Dean stood there unmoving in shock, Castiel yelled at him. Not only did he yell
to earn a love like this
*$*$*$*$*
"Come on Sammy the best I can come up with is eating some bacon cheeseburgers sitting on Baby's hood while looking at the stars." Dean knew after the year that he just put Castiel through, their first anniversary had to made into something special, but knowing he wasn't exactly the most romantic, he went to Sam for a better idea he had.
Divorce papers. Dean sat and stared at the papers with his husbands no
Dean sat there dumbfounded, he didn’t know what to say he didn’t know if there was anything to say.
“Dean, I thought we were all meeting out by the car, am I late?”
Castiel yelled out from the bathroom as he brushed his teeth. He didn’t wait for a sound of acknowledgment.
Dean sat next to Cas’ prone body in the hospital bed, hooked up to machines surrounding him. His heart slowly started to shatter, he couldn’t lose his husband. He should’ve gone straight home, he didn’t have to stop by the shop, they knew what they were doing. He didn’t have to stop to get a burger either, that was just selfish, he should’ve been focused on Cas not how tired he was, not how he didn’t think he could deal.
Aiden adjusted by doing what he had always done best; he went numb. Pushing away from the parent he viewed as not wanting him was a defense mechanism he learned and perfected after realizing that daddy Dean wouldn’t be around as much as he wanted him to be long ago.
Suddenly in the hot seat, Gabe squirmed but answered honestly. Satisfied with his answers, Charlie let the conversation lean back to their scheming.
Sam popped in on his lunch break to make sure Jess wasn’t smothering him. Bobby and Ellen came by and dropped off food for him and Dean because according to Ellen “Hospital food is bland crap and you boys need food with flavor.”
It was during the 5
"That was amazing." Cas threw his arms around Dean's neck and kissed him to silence his nervous rambling. "I didn't know that you could sing like that Dean. I loved it." Dean blushed at the praise Cas showered him with.
Cas strolled into the back of the auto shop with Deans newly discovered favorite. His afternoon classes had been canceled for a rally for homecoming. He knew earlier in the week but didn’t tell Dean so that he could surprise his alpha. What he saw when he turned the corner……..
“YOU DID WHAT?!?!?!? I disappear for two days to get some much-needed studying and you two decide to turn into secret agents, bad ones at that.” To say that Sam was displeased with their most recent activities was a grave understatement. Charlie and Gabriel had decided to let him in on their plotting and scheming. At least they both had the brains to be embarrassed and ashamed during their scolding.
“So I'm Dr. Mullen but you can call me Cain. I understand you’re here for a confirmation on a diagnosis? “Cain hadn’t glanced down at his notes on Cas situation and all the lab results that had been sent to him by Sam, instead he held eye contact with Castiel.
“Dean”
It’s better to have everything out in the open so no one would get hurt in the long run. Sam never thought he would find a possible mate this soon, but he wasn’t mad about it. Something about Gabriel being his polar opposite made them work together so perfectly. Nevermind the fact that Charlie had already gifted them with a couples name.
Cas only shook his head as he slowly put Deans room back together. This wasn’t the first time and much to his chagrin, it wouldn’t be the last. Cas cleaned up the room and put everything back where it should be including the one family photo that included his mother that Dean kept only in his drawer.
“Yes, I was, but now I’m home and fully involved.” Dean looked over at the corner. Aiden had yet to acknowledge his presence.
Sam wiped a hand down his face and let himself relax. This might actually work, technically this was no different than two people sitting in a room on a video conference.

(See the end of the chapter for
“After Sam noticed he wasn’t looking too hot and figured out it wasn’t a cold, Cas swore us to secrecy. He said you were already so stressed out running the shop, that he couldn’t add to that. He did promise to tell you once there was a definite diagnosis, which happened last week.” Charlie tried to focus on anything except the glare Dean was giving her. Feeling like a small child under the scrutiny of a disapproving parent.
“Umm… its been like a week.”
Check the will
“Its okay to yell at me, I may be a little under the weather but I’m not glass,” Cas yelled over the noise of the mixer and grinder going at the same time.
The first few test results start coming in for possible matches.
Somehow since they were children Dean always managed to get under his skin. Cas would never admit it was because of the soul-encompassing crush he had on his best friend and no matter how many times Gabe pestered him about it, he made a vow to himself after seeing Dean with that girl Lisa, he would never do anything about it. Friends were all they would ever be, and although it would hurt like hell, he was okay with it.
The lighting behind Charlie turned dark and she was hit with a spot light. There was also the sound effect of a heart beat echoing around the room.
Day by day the story grew more elaborate and became less and less about anything Cas thought but took on a life of its own. The characters seemed in charge of their own stories and it was only Cas’ job to write it all down.
Castiel plopped down in the seat across from Dean, he wasn’t sure if it was him coming down from the adrenaline rush of last night and this morning or his shock at the audacity of the man in front of him.
After he’s done with clean-up he looks up to see fire red hair walking in its Charlie, she’s usually part of the morning crew, oh well. He waves and clocks out. It’s still too early to pick up the kids so he just pulls out his phone after he parks at the school, only about 45 minutes to burn. Cas calls the only person he consistently talks to that isn’t telling him his children's educational progress.
“Oh, you’re ready to finish signing then? Good, you only need one final signature and date at the bottom since you’ve filled in everything else already.” Mr. Pravus opened the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out the contract that Dean had previously filled in with all of his demands.
“Cas I already ordered you a burger with a side salad. Should be here any second, where’s Gabe?” Charlie was making small talk knowing that Gabe was setting up the next step and double checking everything.
“Dean this day has been about us. We need to… I mean I… Dean I planned a whole speech but it's evading me right now so I’ll just…Dean, I love you. I have for most of our lives. I know I’m not perfect and I’m probably not exactly the alpha I should be but I know that if you could just give me the chance I would spend the rest of our lives doing everything I possibly could to make sure that you felt loved, protected and happy.”
“I’m going to make a toast. To Castiel and Dean the newly mated couple. May they have many gorgeous grandbabies for me to spoil.” Chuck couldn’t help but groan.
“That’s wonderful Dean, I am ready to go.” Castiel double checked his pockets for his room key and wallet and stepped out closing the door behind him. This time he led the way while Dean trailed behind him to the car.
This was the fourth time that Cas had been left alone with the children while Dean chased after the impossible dream job.
Hearing the voice he allowed his rigid body to relax. His scent went from fear to irritation quickly. “Gabriel, has no one ever told you it’s a bad decision to sneak up on a pregnant omega?” Just as he finished, his phone went off. Cas held up a finger to let Gabe know to wait.
“Okay I know that look, its the same look you had after you and Cassie broke up, and after you were so convinced Lisa was cheating so you just ended it. Whats goin on, spill” Charlie folded her arms across her chest and perched in the middle of Deans desk preventing him from escaping into his computer.
Dean spent more time on research and strategy than he ever had previously in his career. Typically, he would just go with whatever information was given to him in the dossier for his next “acquisition”, but since he had lofty goals in mind and was working to fast track the end of his contract, he needed to be sure that he could trust all of his information. Ramiel was not above sabotage, Dean had seen many good operators get injured on the job due to false or incomplete information. This was important to avoid because according to the contract, any time and money spent in recuperation due to injury while working had to be repaid to the company, meaning an extension on his time. If any of what Sa has been saying is true, then that’s not something Dean can risk at this moment.
“That’s it! File the paperwork, Sam. He’s made his choice.” Castiel sat at the dining room table in the dark sipping on the whiskey Dean had left behind. His voice was more growling that speech.
Dean placed a blanket over Castiel and packed his duffle for the trip ahead. He made sure to pack those jeans that are just slightly too tight and always make Cas drool. Then he dug in the closet to find every green shirt he had. Cas always said the color made his eyes sparkle. Anything he could do to make the trip better or easier for Cas, Dean was going to do.
“Jo don’t start. Yes, I have a ring. You know I don’t do chick flick moments, so romantic I don’t know and let me work on getting Cas to say yes before we start talking churches” Dean took a deep breath clearly still nervous about his lack of a plan.
Gabe took the concoction off the heat. Grabbing a bowl and some organic berries Gabe moved over to the counter top to face his brother.
“If you do I’ll make those stuffed bacon burgers that you love so much for dinner.”
“You just pointed at all of me” Castiels voice rough from disuse. His eyes narrowing in confusion and anger.
With his final words, Castiel took off his wedding band and slammed it into Deans' chest.
“Is there any way I can convince you to eat that somewhere else?” Cas had stopped typing at some point while Dean was deep in thought staring off into nothing. “I can barely hear myself think with all of the noise you’re making. You do realize theres a no food allowed sign on the door right?”
D: I guess you’ll have to show up to find out
Who do you think is the Alpha??? Who do you think is the Omega???
The nurse put a hand on Deans shoulder.
“No, you're not going to start the farewell speech. You’ve got a long road of recovery to go yes, but you’re not so far gone that its time to plan the funeral. Look, we didn’t want to tell you but after the last time you blacked out, all of us got tested for donor compatibility.” Sams eyes locked on his hands in his lap as he went on with the story of how they all decided to keep it a secret and if any of them were a match he would have received a kidney from an ’anonymous donor’.
By the start of the second chorus Dean had locked his eyes with Cas and pulled him onstage, **might as well go all in and give him a real show** hoping the words in the song fully conveyed how he truly felt.
“Now that we’ve got that out of your system.” Pam pulled the gloves off of his hands and handed him a bottle of water. “Let's move on to the next step.” Castiel sat down on the mats in front of the window and started stretching. Bringing his heart rate under control Castiel grabbed a resistance band and stretched out his legs. “I do trust Dean to look after our children. I trust that he believes he was doing what was best for us. I don’t trust him when it comes to me.”
*$*$*$*$*
Castiel believed it was more to keep them from driving a teacher insane. Alone, either of them wouldn’t be too much but together they could test the patience of Gandhi. One was calculating while the other was rambunctious.
When Dean walked back in carrying a mug of tea for Castiel and a mug of coffee for himself, Cas couldn’t even bother to pretend to be embarrassed.
"Could you imagine if they have a girl?" Sam was laughing at every scenario that was playing in his mind.
He gave Mrs. Mosley Deans number, he didn’t want to give Dean a fair warning and after their initial conversation, she agreed, Dean would need to be blindsided with his help. His help needed to be tough, motherly, and possess knowledge about love and his history.
Back in her small office, Charlie was putting to use her not-so-rusty hacker skills. There had to be someway to fast track Cas on the donor list. She researched donors and the best people to turn to in these situations. Of course, family was the best and most likely option, she had remembered that the ex said Cas was adopted when he was 3 or 4 and barely remembers anything about his family. Charlie dug and found the records that happened to be sealed, but nothing is sealed for Charlie Bradbury, of course after a few keystrokes, she had the whole story. The family tree, the police reports, and the subsequently closed record adoption.
“okay.” Aiden finished his dinner without another question.
“That’s not the point Dean, I was talking to Charlie and she said you are barely gone from the shop long enough to sleep and
Every couple of hours Ellen comes into the room bringing with her a new snack and a drink to wash it all down, removing the previous snack and beverage. Disheartened that seeing bites missing was a rarity.
“What does Dean know?” Sam sighed half grateful not to have to keep up the secrets but he knew Cas, there might be a new lie to follow.
His body moving on autopilot, he plopped down on the floor in between the kids. Claire immediately claimed his lap.
This wasn’t an unusual thing as he’d done this with them for every move, even when they were infants and only offered gurgles for their opinions.
The tune to "Must Be Doing Something Right"  begins to echo through the speakers and Cas is in a wide-eyed daze as Dean stares him down through the first verse. By the chorus, Cas has a dumbfounded in love look on his face.
“yea I knew I could count on you for this. Goodbye”
“I never said I left Gabriel, I just was not
Dean sat on the floor as Sam was escorted by security off the floor.
“I see babygirl, that is pretty cool. Are we keeping this a taking it home?” Castiel looked at the neon orange bag sitting next to him in the sand and noticed there was a plastic baggie with three other shells already in it sitting on top of the rest of the items.
Dean sat in silence, Castiel was truly leaving him, leaving behind the dream home they had together, moving to a new place where there would be no memories of Dean.
“Dean?” Castiel climbed out of their bunker and looked back.
After Sam left Cas knew even more what he had to do. Missouri walked in while he was lost in his thoughts. “Honey you look like your mind is going a mile a minute.” She went on taking his vitals and checking the readouts on all of his monitors. “Missouri, I’ve heard the statement ‘it is better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission’ do you believe it is true?” Missouri finished writing down her notes on the clipboard at the foot of his bed. “Boy, what kind of stupid are you planning?” She was never one to sugar coat anything. Always told it like it was, that’s why she is the best person to talk to about his idea.
“I was asking you what you thought of the treats, the baker said they used honey instead of sugar. The mini pies are great.” Dean sat back in his chair next to the bed, with another tart in hand. “Those.” Cas pointed in Deans direction. “are actually called tartlets, but yes from what I’ve tried these are pretty good.” The rest of their night went about the same, random conversation that covered just about everything from Deans impending foray into the world of LARPing.
The mystery was driving Gabriel insane, but Naomi was loving it. Before Castiel was just some young omega from a small town with no real draw for the alphas, now powerful alphas from all over the country came for a chance at mating him during a run.
“Whatever bitch”
He hasn’t moved one inch from the bed she laid him in.
“AB negative”
“Can’t be meeting the family, cause you’ve grown up with Cas so you know the family. What about mating?” Deans scent spiked and he has never been more excited to see a bacon cheeseburger and Charlie's chili cheese fries in his life.
"I'm alright Cas. I'm just ready for dinner. Aren't you?" Dean tried his best to keep the nervous tremor out of his voice, he knew what the night ahead of them held, he just hoped it was as perfect as he envisioned.
The five minutes up and Deans burger gone.
*$*$*$*$*
When it was all said and done the three grown men walked out carrying their enlarged bars with pride. Names printed on custom labels in bright white lettering across the front.
“Really? I can smell the lust from all the way in here babe!!!” Dean yelled from the kitchen, where he was waiting for the kettle to heat.
Underneath this lid were two drinks, one a cold beer with a koozie and a insulated cup filled with honey hibiscus tea.
Ellen stood outside the door to his room weighing her options. She wasn’t sure if she should tell Castiel everything or anything at all. Would he reject the help if he knew that it was Dean who set it up? Would he sink even deeper?
“Well that just sounds like so much fun, you really love school don’t you Claire. Can you tell me about your house? What's it like at home?” Missouri was steering the questions towards the real subject matter and Deans' heart rate picked up with every second. Claire talked about camping in the backyard at their old house, loving having her own room so she didn’t have to share with boys.  Both adults had to chuckle at that.
The only thoughts in his head include his own disgust with himself and wondering where the children are if Sam is obviously camping out in his room. At least he knows this is real, nowhere else would he have such negative thoughts.
“Now get off my couch and go home to your angel, he’s probably waiting for you with pie and a Dr.Sexy DVD.” Charlie ushered Dean to the door and gave him one last reassuring hug.
I'm sorry it has taken so long for an update to this story but it is a very emotional one and I'm doing my best. I hope I still have some readers out there who appreciate it.
Jess held the phone out to him again. “It’s Cas, he’s awake and asking for you, Sam already told him you needed to rest so this was our compromise.” Jess grabbed his hand and thrust the phone into it forcing him into action.
Ellen came by for her weekly visit. She was the only name Castiel had on his visitors' list. He didn’t want the kids to see him this way, it would only upset them. If he let Sam come it would undoubtedly lead to a conversation about Dean and that was the last thing he wanted to be thinking about. They couldn’t take a walk in the garden because of his most recent episode so she sat with him in the common area while they watched a documentary about the birds of the rainforest.
“Wow, no pressure babe. Do you want me to come for support?” If his presence there would make Castiel feel more relaxed and stable Dean would be there front and center. If going to the presentation meant he had to miss one of his classes as well then….Cas didn’t need to worry about that.
“Gabriel… yes I know you’re sorry that’s why I’ve decided that you are going to help me figure out a way to apologize to Dean. I yelled at him this morning and I need to make amends. Meet me at the coffee house on 4
“Wooo!!! I’ve got my very own alpha moose!!” Gabriel wrapped his legs around Sams' torso and began bucking his hips as if he was riding a horse with one hand in the air spinning an imaginary lasso.
By the end of it, Castiel was pacing not even acknowledging the other two people in the room. He never gave Dean a chance to respond or even nod his agreement or disagreement with his perception of the events. Meaning he never looked up to see how bad his words were hurting Dean.
“Why is that always your first question? Never mind, nothing like that, I just need you to pick me up from the bus station. I’ll be there in about an hour.” Gabriel knew from the tone in his brothers' voice that something had gone really wrong on the trip.
“If I eat it all, can I have…..one of the galaxy suckers Uncle Gabe sent us?”
Right after this run, Cas passed off his college applications to Sam to be mailed out. Dean having already graduated was working full time at Bobby's auto shop saving up money. He needed to save every possible penny if he was going to support Cas in the near future. Once the college replies started coming in, all mailed to Dean and Sams house, of course, Dean started pricing apartments and searching for jobs.
*$*$*$*$*
Castiel stood in the room looking around at the different stations she had pointed out, the punching bag, the yoga mat with a rainbow of bands stacked on top of it and then a desk with all kinds of art supplies. He had to admit, his brain did seem to work a little better when his hands were busy. This might just work.
Castiel had previously wondered how Ellen had gotten it, but now he knew. Dean had brought it for him. It wasn’t the first time someone had offhandedly mentioned Dean or called him his husband. Maybe they didn’t know that he had filed for a divorce, maybe they didn’t know how much Dean was the reason he had been there in the first place. Either way, it didn’t matter. Castiel sat and stared out at the flowers, they never let him down.
When they got back to the house Sam didn’t even go inside. He walked them to the door and promised to come over this weekend to make smores and roast hotdogs.
“Gabriel, did you know mom and dad had a bet going about me and Dean?” Castiel had his trademark head tilt.
He didn't know how, but he was going to keep Cas in his life for as long as Cas would have him.
“Boy, I’ve been thinking about us.
“Whatever Charlie, I got them at the new bakery that opened up a couple blocks from here. I spent the night at the hospital with Cas, and I figured if I was going to come late I better keep the queen happy.” Dean walked over to his office to check what paperwork he had waiting for him on his desk. Not too much out of the ordinary, some order forms, payroll, random contract, shipping paperwork.  Checking his email, he had a new one from ‘
Sams' voice wavered and broke a little. He was finally relieved that he could talk to Dean about it all.
Aiden standing in front of the NASA building.
Seven times, seven times Castiel had gone on a run and never been claimed. Cas made it to his 18
“Dean Winchester, you bring your butt in here and keep me company while I make you some chili.” She brought everything she would need to make what had been dubbed some of the best chili ever. She’d won a few ribbons in a couple of local competitions and was quite proud of it.
Castiel stopped punching the bag completely lost in confusing. Why not Dean? Had he really considered Dean an option at that point? Would Dean have taken him home and loved him still after all that had been said and done? NO! Castiels mind screamed back at his self-deteriorating thoughts. That night happened because of Dean, that night happened because of his own issues, they both were responsible to some extent.
“There’s a place right there and look its attached to a lounge,
“Okay papa, can I go first?” Aidan looked like he was just as done with the situation as his father. It didn’t help that Aidan ended up being his clone with slightly lighter hair.
Seven hours after hard labor, some threats from his mate and a broken hand. Dean held a twin in each arm as introduced them to their uncles.
“Alright then, I believe you met my associate, Dr. Loki, already? He will be assisting. Let’s get this show on the road.” Cain walked over taking the locks off of the wheels on Cas bed and wheeled him out of the room.
“There’s plenty for me and Cas. No rabbit food for you Sammy, sorry.” Dean tossed a bunch of bananas and a bottle of water into the backseat without looking. Sam’s grunt let him know he hit his target.
“Cas…” Dean sat next to the bed searching for the words clinging to his husband's hand as solid proof that Cas was in fact still with him. “Please can you, can you at least tell
There was a heavy silence from the other side of the phone.
“Whatever guys, just so happens I already have a plan and I’m gonna ask Cas to marry me.” Dean couldn’t even lift his eyes from the beer he was holding in his hands. His nerves made his hands shake.
“You guys don’t know what you’re missing.” Dean used his fork to point at Sam and Cas unintentionally flicking some filling across the table.
“Roadhouse, burgers, beer, with Gabe. Cool?” Sam broke into caveman speak knowing he’d only hold Deans attention for so long.
Instead of spending more time waiting for Aiden to answer, Dean stood up scooping the ball of a child up in his arms. Ms. Mills hooked Aiden’s backpack on Dean's shoulder. “Since this is the first time anything has happened, I think we can chalk this up to a bad day and try again tomorrow?” Ms. Mills pat Dean on his back and walked the two to the door. “Bye Aiden I hope you have a better day tomorrow.” Aiden didn’t move.
Ellen proceeded to check his vitals and reflexes since he seemed up to the challenge.
“Who are you?”
“Yea Cas. I’m here. I deserve whatever you were thinking.“ Dean walked over to Cas taking his jacket off of his shoulders and hanging it up on the hook by the door. “The chili needs to simmer for a while before its ready so how about you and I sit on the porch and talk while the kids burn off some of their energy outside? I’d really like a chance to talk to you” Everything in Deans body language portrayed his remorse and shame.
“What? Its called positive reinforcement Sam, I learned about it in my psych class. “ Charlie shrugged and snacked on her own fries.
“I’m never leaving you guys again.”
“I don’t want to leave him, I love Dean you know that, but I’m done being second best or an after-thought. I’m hoping this is the wake-up call he needs, and things start to change.” Cas let his head drop back onto the wall. It was taking everything in him not to cry. He had to be strong for the kids. He always had to be strong for the kids, but his strength wasn’t running low
“Okay so I’m looking at your labs and I have a couple things to discuss with you.” Cain pulled a file out of his briefcase and set it on the table in front of him. There had to be enough papers that the stack was at least two inches thick. Dean stared in disbelief if this was lab results for one patient. Why didn’t they just issue laptops to all the doctors it had to be cheaper.
’ ..well I’ve made up my own,
“Do I really Sam? It was you that noticed I hadn’t been eating, it was you that noticed I was always tired and you only see me on the weekends at Sunday dinner. So I think its clear at this point where his priorities are right now.” The anger and frustration was boiling to the surface as Cas took a deep breath to keep himself in control.
Cas chuckled marking his page and pushing his stack of books to one side. “Well, you know me, Jess, it doesn’t matter where I am as long as I have a good book about flowers and bees.“ He used the controls on the side of the bed to sit up even further. Cas eyed Sam as he was shifting from one foot to the other and fidgeting, Cas could tell there was something he wanted to talk about, and he was about to burst.
Castiel went to his room that night with a lot on his mind. So many things…so many different ways to interpret it all. The day was long enough without being dragged out by Charlie and her shopping extravaganza. Dean had made sure that he was coming home for dinner, was that so he knew how much to cook? Did he plan to have dinner with someone else? The soup was his favorite, but Dean likes it just as much.
“So.. a few days huh?” Castiels' first words after Cain left the room. To him it had only been a few minutes, one second he was going upstairs to the bedroom, the next he was lying in a hospital bed hooked up to a billion machines.
Dean snatched the duffle out of his hands and tucked into the trunk right next to his own.
After a few regulars, she picked up the microphone and announced that they had a special guest performing tonight and asked him to come to the stage.
“Exactly” Ellen stood up and moved higher up on the bed. “I’ve got a friend that works in the best mental healthcare facility in the state. I would like to give them a call and get you a spot.” Ellen ran her fingers through Castiels hair, greasy from not being washed, but she didn’t shy away from showing him any affection that he allowed. “If that is okay with you. I don’t want to force you Castiel, but you’ve got to know that you can’t just lay in bed forever.” Her hands pushed away from the blanket and pulled Castiel into what can only be described as a tight mama bear hug.
“And there's the rage…put it all in the bag angel.” Pam started calling him by the nickname after their second session. She said he had unleashed god-like wrath on her
“Seven, seven times before I decided that this daddy shark needed a break. Besides the kids needed something to help them burn through their sugar high without them becoming destructive.”
The next morning was just as rocky.
“Sam, I’m sure Cas has better things to do with his break than spend it driving around with me. I mean us.” Dean hoped Sam didn’t notice the slip. “Especially after the way he came and yelled at me, I’m sure I’m the last person he’d want to spend time with.” Sadness leaked into his scent.
To say that the next morning was awkward would be a gross understatement. Castiel didn’t bother to show up to breakfast, he just texted Sam to bring back a snack to his room. Castiel was embarrassed for his actions, he was ready to buy a bus ticket and end his vacation early, the last thing he wanted to do was cause tension on their family time. It was clear that Dean didn’t want to be near him and he wasn’t going to force him to be.
A little more research and firewall breaking, she found a name of one person in his birth family, Lucifer Shurley.
Dean took a deep breath and hoped his scent hadn’t gotten too out of control.
“Oh sweetie you’re awake, thank goodness. If you didn’t wake up soon I was going to have to bring in an extra bed and IV for that husband of yours. He hasn’t left you longer than it takes to use the bathroom and barely ate since we brought you in.”  The nurse was gentle in all of her checks gingerly moving Cas’ limbs in the daily exercises to help with his circulation.
Dean seemed to accept the curt response and thumbed through a magazine he’d brought with him to the study room. His classes were over for the day but he had to wait since he was Cas’ ride home. This months antique cars magazine had just come out luckily so at least the articles were new to him, unlike the stacks of other issues he had back at their apartment. Those he had gone through so many times he could almost tell you what was on every page from memory.
“Alright queen they will be here around 4, is everything set up?” Gabriel was sitting next to Charlie as she was focused on her laptop typing away at some sort of code.
Sams entire personal immediately switched, you could see him go from brother-in-law Sam to Dr. Winchester.
Dean was still riding the learning curve and Castiel well, he was, gone.
“No one tells me no Dean, no one. I thought you knew that.” Ramiel reached into the inside pocket of his blazer and pulled out the contract that Dean had refused to sign before. “This can go one of two ways, you can sign it now and I will forgive this…..tantrum, for a fee of course. Or I can show you the true extent of my knowledge of pain, after which you sign it with your broken fingers.” Dean glared at the man that had once been his mentor, someone he aspired to become. “I will tell you, Dean, in full disclosure, if you force my hand, those you care about will suffer most.” Ramiel lifted his cell phone and showed him a CCTV video recording of Aiden and Claire at camp. ” Cute things aren’t they, it’s a shame how fragile life is at that age.”
It was only then that Castiel started to realize that things weren’t quite right. Little things were off. Like the sand didn’t actually stick to his feet. He never needed to reapply sunscreen to the kids, yet they had been out there all day.
Honestly, he wasn’t sure what he was going to say.
Aiden went through his day as normal. Get up eat breakfast. Somebody would take him and Claire to summer camp, and well now school. Get picked up. Uncle Sam makes dinner and puts him to bed.
“Am I alright? Sam why am I looking at divorce papers from my husband excuse me
“Sammy, Gabe. I would like you to meet Samantha Jean and Lenox Gabriel.” He handed each uncle their namesake and watched the tears well up in their eyes.
“Dean you’re rambling.” Cas put a finger over Deans lips to stop him from talking. It was obvious that he was nervous but Cas couldn’t figure out why just yet.
“Yea they found me, it sounds like you know more about this so tell me what happened Sam? I thought I had time.” Dean took another big gulp of whiskey. “He—Cas—he told me that he would divorce me if I signed another contract. He gave me an ultimatum, our marriage or the next contract.” Dean had so much more to say but this was not the time or place for sharing and caring.
Bringing Claire home for the first time.
he would be old enough to remember. His silence actually only meant one thing, sadness. Aiden never dealt with change well. If there was a call from school about his behavior in the coming days Castiel wouldn’t hold it against him.
“It is Dean, please calm down we’ve only been waiting for 5 minutes.” Even though Cas anxiety was through the roof he somehow managed to be the calm to Deans storm.
“Yes.”
“Crap, fever and shakes are not good babe.” Dean jumped up from the bed to snatch his phone off the dresser. These were two symptoms Cain told him to look out for. How long had Cas been like this while he was gone? Maybe he shouldn’t have stopped at the diner for a quick burger and talk with friends.
Cas let go of a breath he’d been holding for far too long at this point. “ Ok so you’ve told me what it is not but you also haven’t said that I’m perfectly fine…. So are you going to give me the bad news or do I have to wait for dessert?” Cas was relieved that he wasn’t being given a death sentence but on edge with what possibilities were left.
“Doctor? Here’s the blood sample from patient Shurley for the test you requested.” A small blonde nurse holds up a few labeled vials of blood.
******
“NO I am not the owners' daughter, I was here to see Dean.” She folded her arms across her chest and shifted her weight putting it all to one side. The smirk on her face and glint in her eyes told him she’s just trying to get under his skin. “Oh ok, I wish I had known then I would have brought you lunch as well, but then again most customers don’t come into the back of the shop let alone stay while their car is being worked on. Luckily it's only a window and headlight, so you’ll be on your way soon. Just like all the rest” Castiel turned back to the workspace and adjusted the photo Dean kept there of the two of them from the first day in their apartment.
The big night was upon them, and Dean's heart was pounding from the moment he picked Cas up for their date.
“Dean? You usually call in the middle of the day, is everything alright?” Dean could hear his brother shuffling around, no doubt the moose was sitting up. A groan let him know Sam had just looked at the clock.
” helpful tips from Gabe the resident baker.
“Everything alright Dean?” Castiel strolled up next to Dean holding both of their duffle bags slung over his shoulder. That good old alpha strength, those bags might as well have been filled with air.
“So what is it this time?” Castiel didn’t even bother to let Dean reach his seat and get comfortable, the only time Dean seemed to need to talk is when he was leaving again. Chasing after some magical amount of money to fulfill a space that money wasn’t going to ever satisfy.
“huh? Oh hey Charlie.” Deans eyes barely focused on hers and she instantly knew that look, he was spiraling. That meant Cas either still hadn’t told him, or hadn’t told him everything. Either way this could only end up bad if it wasn’t fixed.
Finally the first meeting with the doctor
For every run afterward, they continued to work the plan. Over the years the boys had to expand the underground fort cause well they couldn’t stay the size of small children forever.
“Alright I think I’ve had enough of being trapped in this car for the day what about you guys?” Dean looked over at Cas who seemed to have a growing attachment to the large pack of Redvines he found in the bags an hour ago.
And with that thought, he would slip into being ridiculously horny. Cas would start thinking about their many nights under the stars before they had the kids. The way they could take each other apart. Their honeymoon.
Castiel for the good of his own sake had stopped wearing pajamas and house shoes to his sessions, now he would show up in either basketball shorts and a t-shirt or sweatpants and sneakers. The t-shirt inevitably would come off as he preferred the freedom of movement and he did work up quite a sweat depending on the subject matter. Pam didn’t mind she always told him whatever it took to be comfortable is what he should do.
After releasing a breath he’d been holding, Castiel couldn’t help but smile and shake his head. The kids would make it through this just fine. It was him that he was worried about. Well, not worried about. He just had to hold on for a little bit longer.
“Hmm just trust your instincts. I’m sure you and Sam will come up with the perfect name for your baby.” Castiel was disheartened to know that he’d never know their name, never hold them in his arms, never hear the baby giggle. But he’s doing what needs to be done. He can’t let them all suffer through watching him slowly die when he could do something about it.
“So… does that mean you’re okay with this?” Castiel was so confused, his mother was typically so reserved and professional. He was not expecting her to have a fangirl moment.
“D--Dean?” Castiel tried talking. His voice was rougher than usual. Dean had been here. Dean had seen how pathetic he had been. Dean had decided he wasn’t worth sticking around. Castiels spiraling thoughts must have been broadcast across his face.
“Castiel”
“I know this is not what we discussed Castiel but it was what I felt was needed to be done in the best interest of my patient. As well as I wasn’t going to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder knowing Dean Winchester is coming after me.”
When they pulled up to the front of the inn, it seemed as if they were in the middle of a movie set. The large picturesque home was sitting in the middle of a pasture reminiscent of a classic Christmas family special. There were wildflowers everywhere and a walking trail. Across the front porch were old fashioned rocking chairs some painted white, some still in their natural wood coloring. While the brothers took in their surroundings, Castiel snuck away to check in, he didn’t want either of them to know exactly what he’d paid for the three of them for the next few days.
“Whatever, just don’t get caught swimming in the chocolate fountain alright?”
This was going to be a hyper afternoon.
Dean walked into the shop on autopilot, he breezed pass Charlie like she wasn’t even there.
“You need to vent and talking to yourself is not going to help. You need a face to face confrontation so that you can truly feel ready to let go of these emotions.”
The week caps off with a crappy start to Friday morning. Castiel woke up 3 hours before his already stupid early alarm. Why was he awake? Nightmares, he had them every time Dean went off to foreign worlds to work his negotiation magic. Todays nightmare? Dean being blown up in a case of wrong place, wrong time.  Realizing that going back to sleep he laid there staring at the ceiling. Not much really going through his mind, just the daily plan.
“Come on, just give it a try.”
“So are we going to talk about that or…” Gabe let it hang in the air.
“You’re insinuating that I am romantically interested in someone. You and I both know that I am fully committed to my work and don’t have time for such things.” Castiel repeated the line that he’d been taught by his family. School first, relationships can happen later. “Cas the only reason you’re not looking is that the omega of your dreams already lives with you in domestic bliss.” Charlie gave him a pointed look, leaving no room for misunderstanding precisely who she was talking about.
“Look I get it, Sammy, I’ll call more often.  Look its only for a little longer, if I take this extension we will be set for life.” Dean was determined to prove he could provide for his family, anything they wanted he was going to be able to buy.
Cain finally looked down and chuckled. “Yes we are friends from college, I was a guest speaker for a seminar concerning genetic anomalies and hereditary diseases. Sam was a very ambitious student and wouldn’t let me leave until I’d given him every bit of research I had on the subject.” Cain smirked remembering the headstrong med student who seemed determined to heal the world on his own.
Dr. Loki smiled and flipped a few switches. “Well, I’m the only candy obsessed doctor around that just so happens to have it. He pulled an oxygen mask over Cas face and the aroma of fresh honey took over his senses. “Breathe deep for me Castiel and Godspeed.”
“I know you love me and I love that you're willing to put up with yet another documentary for me. I don’t care what they say, you’re a big teddy bear, Dean Winchester. Well let’s not put a damper on the mood, tell me how many rock & roll baby names have you suggested to Jess and Sam this week?” The chuckle he felt rumble through Deans chest told him that things were lightening up. “Hey is it my fault that I want my niece or nephew to have an awesome name? I just wish they would tell us which one it is already.”
The next his mood would turn to full-tilt rage.
*******
“Dean!! Thank you!! Thank you!!” Cas kept repeating those words squeezing him so hard, Dean thought he might break a rib.
It was during the 6
“Alrighty good answer, your turn Dean-o.” Dean had barely glanced up while Cas told his story. He remembered that day. He’d pestered the babysitter so much about the moving truck and who was in it that she’d sent him outside to play with Sam in the yard.
The moving company showed up and Castiel confirmed the new address where they would be moving. Cas had flown out and found the perfect place. One of the children’s rooms already had a complete wall of chalkboard paint. He’d let Claire enjoy that room so that Aiden could be free to paint his room anyway he pleased
“Would I be able to paint my room any color?” Aiden was laser-focused on a knot in the wood grain.
“You don’t even remember her name do you Dean? Dud I don’t know why you go through all of this, just tell that blue-eyed hunk of man meat he’s yours already.” Charlie watched the blush on his ears, she knew Dean was pining away for his best friend, but too many comments from that man that claimed to be his father, thankfully he was long gone, but the damage was done.
“Hey nice to see you, stranger.” Jess bumped shoulders with Dean when he walked in the door, he hadn’t been to a Sunday dinner since he’d taken over the business, often using his Sundays to do the books or catch up on cars that needed work.
to go there. It was just a random point on the map.”
“Hey, she forgot to give us menus.” Sam turned in his seat trying to catch someones attention.
.” He motioned to Deans collection of records ominously.
Dean had been one hard nut to crack but when he did open up those emotions poured out like a fountain. Missouri stayed quiet in her corner this was a family moment she did not want to disturb. Aiden's body language had gone lax and he held on to his daddy and his sister. A heavyweight was finally off that poor boy's shoulders. He’d not had a chance to vocalize his thoughts yet but something in the shift in the room told Missouri that he didn’t need to, everything was right in his world.
“A chance? A chance for what? To get humiliated and raped in the woods? Thanks a lot, Gabe.” Cas barely could hold back his anger. The only thing that kept him from running away was not wanting to say goodbye to his best friend Sam.
“Okay, one, stop touching me and respect the fact that I am happily mated, and B, my omega keeps me perfectly happy in every way that I could possibly desire. I’m going to have someone else fix your obviously personally broken window and headlight so you don’t think you have any chance.” Dean forced the girls' hands to her own sides, crouched down looking her in the eyes.
“I umm...you’re a great guy Cas, really. Forget about what your family said, I think it’s great that you’re not some boring alpha knothead like your brothers. Since when was being kind and actually listening considered a bad thing? Let me tell you if even half the alphas I’ve…” Dean stopped mid-sentence when he noticed the jealousy spike in Castiels scent. “Umm what I mean to say is Cas, whatever omega you end up with is going to be a really lucky girl and they’re going to want you for the right reasons.” Dean wrapped an arm around Castiels shoulders and pulled him into a hug.
“What about… Ariel?”
“Its okay Sam I’m sure he’ll mention it soon. I have to go its time for me to get the kids.”
Dean sat at the table in utter shock.
omega.
Charlie put her phone away satisfied that all she had to do was calm her friend and any worry he might have.
*$*$*$*$*
“Test? Umm sure just go ahead and take it to the lab. I’ll check the results later.” The doctor barely looked up from his newspaper.
with, but this was important.
“Dean, don’t talk like that, Cas is going to be ok, we’re doing everything we can for him right now. He’s got the best specialist in the country as his personal on-call doctor. We’re scouring the planet for a donor match. What I need from you right now Dean is Jess is coming to get you. I need you to go with her.” Sam kept his tone firm. If he let his own emotions get the best of him now, he wouldn’t be any better than Dean.
Sorry Its been a while since I've updated the story. School is taking all of my time right now. I will update as often as the inspiration strikes.
“Right this way you two. Enjoy your dinner.” She sat them at a table away from everyone and walked away.
It hadn’t escaped his attention that in the time he’d initially woken up and went back to sleep, Sam had disappeared. Also that no one had come to see him. Sam hadn’t returned. Dean hadn’t made an appearance and without either of them coming by, he couldn’t see the kids.
began to echo in his mind. Before he could do anything stupid, a waiter ran up and smashed a rag into his face that had been doused with a neutralizer. He couldn’t scent Dean anymore, and he was quickly gaining control over himself.
“Somebody tell me again how these two idiots could be so oblivious? They have to be actively ignoring it. Look at Cassie’s face. It’s even too sweet for me.” Gabriel gestured at the camera.
Dean slammed down the metal bowl in his hands onto the counter. “No its not! You’re…you know what nevermind. We’re out of cream and I need it. I’ll be back.” Dean snatched his leather jacket off the back of a chair and stormed out the door.
*$*$*$*$*
Cas curled in his bed, the other side was too often empty and cold for him to not feel as though a part of him was missing and now something might seriously be wrong with him. He needed to talk but Dean was clearly too busy for him. He decided on the only other person he knew wouldn’t mind a late night conversation, but calling this late would be rude.
“I don’t know what you’re thinking but what I do know is that you’re wrong. So you have a problem how are we going to fix it, Winchester?” Charlie pulled out her cell phone while she gave Dean time to think
He didn’t remember anything about Dean coming home.
Cas was just so tired of fighting and being angry, all the rage bled out of him and he just let it play out.
*$*$*$*$*
“I became somewhat of a mentor for him from that point forward. We’ve kept in contact since and I have to say he has not disappointed with his progress.”  Cain continued with small talk for a moment while he looked over the lab results and notes that were sent to him by Sam the day before.
“Excuse me…police chief? What?? Did I miss something between last night and this morning?” Dean almost choked on his coffee. He did a quick mental check trying to think if he’d done anything to warrant such a visit.  He’d kept all the paperwork in order, made sure to file all the correct papers when he took over the business from Bobby. Was he in trouble??
“okay well, you know the deal, stay as long as you want, just lock up if you leave before I get back. I have some errands to run then I need to go to work.” Gabe grabbed the container of raspberry and dark chocolate brownies off the counter, grabbed his backpack and headed for the door. Without even looking up “Tell Sam I said hi.” Castiel smirked to himself when he saw his brother hesitate on the way out the door.
Castiel plopped on the couch cell phone in hand. Nerves causing his hand to shake he dialed the number and prayed no one would answer.
Cas got up and walked inside not leaving room for more discussion. He’d all but forgotten about the chili sitting on the stove. Taking that into consideration he amended his evening plans. He walked to the master bathroom and started a hot bath and tossed in his favorite lemongrass bath bomb. By the time he walked back into the kitchen Dean had both kids seated eating their own bowls. Claire was inevitably making a mess and Aidan was being very particular about the order in which he ate his Triscuits with his chili.
dead. That’s his older brother, who seems to be a bit….” Charlie searched for the right word..”Mental.” Dean wanted to be mad at Charlie for the hacking, the invasion of privacy and going behind his back to do it all, but he had already planned to ask her to do it anyway.
“Castiel, breathe, come back Castiel.”
"That's great and all Sammy, but our first date was at the roadhouse, I barely paid him any attention and I'm pretty sure that's the monthly karaoke night this month." Dean was all but defeated, there was no way he could make this first anniversary special enough to show Cas how lucky he really felt to have his love.
Cas stared wide-eyed, he didn't know that Dean sang.
Dr. Loki walked up to a machine next to him and asked if he had a preferred scent or flavor that he wanted to drift off to. “Well, I highly doubt you have it but if you have honey… I’d greatly enjoy it.”
*$*$*$*$*
“I need you to make Deans favorites.” The plan was formulating in Castiels mind and there was no way Dean could say no. It would be sweet but not overly so. His proposal would fit Dean.
“Have you talked to Dean this week? Last I heard he was looking at extending his time because of some ridiculous bonus they offered him.”
Cas snatched the remote from his hands and pulled up the documentary he’d meant to finish a few days ago. “Business is a job, nature and its preservation is for fun.” Cas smirked at Dean as the documentary played. He barely paid any attention, too lost in the heavenly bowl of soup in his hands. The day Dean finds someone to settle down with will be the saddest day of his life.
Once she triple checked that her latest find had been safely secured, Claire bolted for the water. Castiel called out to Dean to ensure that he saw Claire heading back for the water. She never went any further than knee-deep, but the pull was still strong enough to knock her over if it was a big enough wave receding.
Sam cleared his throat bringing both men back to reality.
(See the end of the chapter for
A moment of pure love.
“Cas, this is amazing. You are amazing.” Dean locked eyes to ensure that Castiel truly believed and trusted his words. “I love you Castiel now make an honest omega out of me and feed me pie.” Dean pulled Castiel towards the bed slowly stripping him of every piece of clothing.
“I wonder if shes like me, they say boys marry their mothers you know.”
“Yo Sasquatch I’m dropping by with treats I hope you have on pants!!” Gabriel knocked on the door to Sams place holding his new creation. It was made with him in mind.
“You are amazing Dean and I’m going to show you just how much.”
, Dean.”
“Yea I’m good red, so tell me beyond mooching food what brings you by today?” Dean stood up and headed back to the kitchen, there was too much on his mind to be idle. Thank goodness he still had cookies to put together but instead of peanut butter and jelly, he opted to mix up a fresh batch of white chocolate chip, one of own personal favorites.
“Nah Cas go for it, sit in the front. I need the back to spread out anyway.” Sam slid into the backseat from the other side of the car leaving no room for argument from Castiel. “Besides, we still gotta pick up snacks for the road and if I have to listen to him explain why the chili lime is the best flavor of beef jerky one more time, then my head will explode.” Sam already had his jacket tucked under his head and a dog-eared book from one of his classes ready for reading.
Dean had Castiels ring in his hands during his speech looking down at it, he realized there were a few tears escaping during his speech. He quickly wiped them away and attached the ring to the chain around his neck.
This chapter was particularly hard to write. SO many emotions and so much to unwrap in a small amount of time. I'm sorry its been a while since I updated. I hope somebody out there is still reading.
Adult Claire carrying her first child.
“I would love to Dean.”
“So, Dean what’s this good news of yours?” Castiel bit into his steak and could not hold back the moan.
“Cas? What are you doing here?” Dean barely got the words out before the sounds of locks clicking echoed through the now empty building.
“What you up to there Cas?”
Jess sat at the table staring down the envelope sitting on the kitchen counter. She sipped her tea and thought about what was hanging in the balance. Could she really bargain away her children? Sams words weighed heavily on her as she sat down her mug and ripped open the envelope. She had to know could she help. Jess was sitting tense staring down at the lab results when Sam came home from work.
“Oh come on Charlie, Gabes all jokes and sugar.” Sam was the first to respond while Gabriel seemed to find his fingernails increasingly interesting. “If he really wanted me he would’ve said something by now, you’ve got one couple don’t push your luck.”
“Aiden? Buddy, I need you to uncurl so we can get you buckled into your car seat okay? I understand if you don’t want to talk and I’m not going to make you just yet.” As Dean sat Aiden down on his booster he experienced what a ball of rage really meant.
Claire was passed out before the Incredibles even made it on the yacht, Aiden was gone by the time Frozone made the ship skid to a halt.
“And no sweetie, daddy won't be coming to help us. If we move it’ll just be the three of us.” Castiel ran his fingers through her hair trying to comfort her as best as he could. She looked up at him confused for a second but just as quickly she shrugged. “If we move then I’ll get to play with the mermaids if we don’t then I get to stay with my friends here. Like Alex, she’s my best friend.
“Only omegas?” Thank goodness she was a beta or else rejection would be flowing from her in waves.
“So Charlie, it is Charlie, right? You seem way too…high tech for a place like this, so how did they rope you in?” He sat on the edge of the desk and offered her some strawberry licorice while his eyes seemed to be scanning the papers on her desk looking for something.  “Well, I don’t think that much your business.” Charlie barely looked up from her computer screen, if this was him trying to flirt, he was seriously wasting his time.
“Take me to see Charlie, I need to ask her to do something for me.”
Castiel released the tension in his shoulders a bit letting his shoulders slump, Dean was right.
“Yea sure baby, anything for you.” The tight look on Castiels face pained Dean so much. It hurt, even more, knowing it was him that put it there.
I make dumb decisions. My scent is even wrong for an omega. I don’t—“.
“Come on guys lets get you to school, papa needs to get to work.” Cas shuffled the kids out the door.
“Charlie, you’re next. We need to find you a lucky lady so you’re not the fifth wheel.”
“That will be a perfect apology Gabriel, I will have the note to you by this evening.”  Castiel didn’t even say goodbye, he picked up his refilled coffee and headed out the door. This short conversation with his brother gave him a lot to think about. He indeed was running out of time and if he was ever to express his feelings to Dean, he needed to do it soon…..but how.
Shortly after, Dr. Cain came sweeping into the room looking at some labs that had been run earlier and checking the different monitors that surrounded Cas’ bed.
“It’s a little north of here on a farm.” Ellen went on to tell Castiel every detail she could remember about the place. It had been years since she’d worked there but it was highly unlikely that much of it had changed. “It’s a small facility, so you won't just feel like a patient connected to a number on a chart somewhere. In the past, they have incorporated many different types of therapy so I figure it might be the place for you. So….can I call?” Ellen tried not to sound too hopeful, she didn’t want him to feel pressured but at the same time she was out of options.
“So everything went as planned?” Sam asked Dean when he finally got home.  He knew the answer when all the alphas came back empty handed but he still needed to hear that there were no problems.
*$*$*$*$*
Aiden didn’t know exactly how to answer, he wasn’t much older than her, but older was older. He remembered a little bit of what uncle Sam had told him. “Papa is sick and has to stay with his doctor. When papa gets better, he will come home okay?” Aiden curled around his sister like the overprotective older brother that he was.
Dean wasn’t so sure about moving into a house. He loved their apartment, it’s been home for him for the last few years. The idea of leaving behind all of the memories unsettled something within him.
“On one condition.” Cas gave a gummy smile. “Whats that Cas?” Dean actually stopped breathing fearful he hadn’t done something right. “Only if you give me your bite before we leave here tonight.” Cas leaned in and kissed Dean on the neck causing a shiver to go down his spine.
Charlie looked at him with a grin. “Maybe”
“Yes, Castiel?” Dean was packing up the snacks and water bottles so no clues were left behind.
“That’s how you train a pet Charlie, not a person.” Sam shook his head but looked back at the monitor. Both men looked happy, Castiel wasn’t vibrating with nerves, if he didn’t know better, they’d look like two friends sitting and enjoying a snack. Just maybe he should lighten up on Gabriel and Charlie.
Castiels thoughts continued to spiral. The only unifying thought—he was beyond saving—and everyone knew it.
Charlie's hand stroked up and down Deans spine as the last few sobs wracked his body. Dean slowly got his tears under control with a soothing deep breath and had a new glint of resolve in his eyes. He would get his husband through this, he had to.
*$*$*$*$*
“Shows what you know moose, let’s go I’m starving.” Dean hopped out of the car the second it came to a stop in the far end of the parking lot. Dean looked around at most of the people he saw leaving the roadhouse in groups, some were dressed normally while others were dressed like fantasy characters from Charlies LARP group.
Cas took a deep breath, the emotions he’d buried so deep were trying to surface. He’d been numb for so long now.
“Hey Cas, sorry I just got out of the shower, I was covered in grease from the auto shop and I know how much you love my scent.” Dean inched closer to his omega mate, smirking knowing how much it wasn’t his words that were holding Castiel’s attention, but the towel hanging precariously on his hips locked in his laser focus.
Hold back the river, hold back
There was never a perfect example of the ‘deer in the headlights’ look as Dean had at that moment. He almost choked on the onion ring he bit into.
Gabe grabbed Castiels attention and told him about his encounter with Sam outside handing him the note when Naomi had her back turned. Cas unfolded it, read it and threw it away. Maybe they weren’t words of love after all.
Missouri didn’t bother to start with a phone call, she knocked on Deans door after the kids were at school. Giving him no chance of closing the door in her face she pushed right in and headed in search of the kitchen. Heavy talks required comfort foods and drinks.
Samantha jumped out of her chair and ran into the kitchen. “They’re up there daddy!! Papa put them up there so we couldn’t sneak and get them!!” She was jumping and dancing in front of the refrigerator pointing to the top.
“ and what Cas? Whats wrong, what has you flying off for the weekend to see a specialist? Charlie only told me because I went to work this morning heartbroken convinced that you were cheating on me. I heard you talking on the phone this morning.“ Deans voice carried a little more conviction, he needed to know and he needed to know how he could help.
Dean pulled off the highway and tried to grab all of the bags out of the trunk but was stopped by Castiel. “You’ve done all the driving thus far at least let me carry the bags? It only seems fair” Dean shrugged and moved from the back of the car to go check in and get a couple rooms, but Sammy was already leaving the front desk.
Becky and Chuck couldn’t have been happier. Their son had graduated, gotten his dream job and if plans went right, he was now mated to the same green-eyed omega that they used to watch him drool over for years. Gabriel was clearly falling in love with Sam. Although he’s not the type of alpha they would have picked for Gabriel, he so quiet. They can see why those two work well together. Sam was the quiet to Gabriels crazy. He anchored him and Gabriel brought excitement into Sams world. All work and no play was no good for anyone. That was something the Novaks knew too well.
Dean had promised him this new move came with stability and less travel.
“Dean..are you trying to name one of our babies after a Disney princess? What makes you so sure that we are having a girl?”
“Aidan!!! Claire!!!” Cas called the children down to look at houses with him.
“Aiden buddy?” Dean crouched next to where Aiden was curled up. “Hey, big guy can you tell daddy what’s going on? I want to help you but I can’t fix the problem if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.” Aiden squeezed his arms around his legs a little tighter and made small growling sound, the only signals of Aiden being aware of his words.
