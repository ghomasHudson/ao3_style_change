Because Tony is still rooted to the spot despite the dismissive note to his words he notices the determined jutting of the Captain’s jaw. The man takes purposeful strides towards Tony, and the mechanic forces himself to stand his ground. His heart hammers in his chest, and because of the way his breath stutters he knows he’s seconds away from being thrown into an attack. Panic claws its way into his throat and his mouth goes dry. The familiar sensation of extremis reacting to his flight or fight response prickles at the back of his mind, and he curses himself for trashing the suits he’d had in the compound. They’re in ‘storage’ now, which means they’re at the tower to be used under Rhodey’s discretion. After their first week, and the stupidly ill advised ‘joy ride’ Tony had taken which resulted in a trashed workshop and half an acre of woods charred, the mechanic had thought it’d be best if he stepped away from the armor for a while. More often than not the suit feels more like a curse these days. And it sucks, it bites and tears at Tony to have his second chance, bought in blood by a man too good for such a cruel world, taken away. But every time he’d looked at the scars on the armor he’d been back in that bunker, every time he stepped inside his cocoon he’d heard the whirring of a metal arm and the hollow sound of a vibranium shield; every time he’d looked at the HUD screen all he’d seen was what was meant to be a familiar arc-reactor blue that sent his panic spiking.
"Sir, structure collapse on 15th street by the army. Many individuals were injured but 2 civilians remain trapped underneath rubble" Jarvis showed surveillance of the area, revealing as first responders and good Samaritans attempted to dig through to get to the aunt and child. "With gas pipes leaking, not only is the air poisoning the both parties, but the chance of  combustion has increased by 59%" Tony huffed and flew over. From below, fighting along the spy, archer, scientist, and prince, Steve left his orders as the army got smaller "Stark, I'm on my way, you'll need back up." He looked to the team. "The rest of you, finish up. Try to limit casualties and show them what you're made of. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Thor, you've gotta try and slow them down. You've got the lightning. Light the bastards up. Nat, stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk...SMASH." The super soldier ran after his husband. Tony smirked at his tail and sped to the scene.

After their farewells, they followed Maria to their agency to talk about the baby. Tony caught Steve alone as Maria went to make a call. "You really want this?" Tony asked, his face stained with dried tears. "I think we can handle him. Besides, we did want a family" Steve held his other half close. "I'm ready" he kissed Tony's cheek. The inventor couldn't believe what he was living through. "We're going to be great fathers" He assured. Maria came back with a ton of paperwork. "So you really want to foster this child? You understand the complexities of raising a toddler, especially after such trauma?" She asked. They both nodded and they began to file the paper work, agreements to do background checks, wellness checks, environment checks, agreement to attend parenting classes and to gain responsibility of Peter. It wasn't going to be easy, but they were going to get through this together.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where is this coming from?' Steve questioned his husband. Tony sat up in the bed. "I don't know Stevie, but seeing you comforting that kid after he suffered, it sparked something in me. I think we should look into it at the very least and if we don't like it, we drop it, no questions asked." he negotiated. Steve thought about it and sighed. "Honey, I'm not so sure I'm ready to be a dad" he admitted. "No one's truly ready at first, babe" Tony answered, standing up to pace. "I'm so overbearingly happy with just you and me, Steve, trust me. But a kid to expand our love, think about it." Steve brushed his hair back with his hand, guiding Tony to bed. "It's not a definite yes yet. I'll think about it" he kissed Tony's cheek. "We'll discuss more in the morning babe" he yawned. That seemed to pacify Tony allowing both men to turn in for the night.
After the paper work was filed, they worked harder than their SHIELD training ever put them through. They met with lawyers and counselors, took the parenting classes, baby proofed the house and spent who-knows how much to prepare for the chance to foster this kid. Tony even prepared a bedroom right next to their room. Everytime they became discouraged, they looked at the photo and worked harder to get it approved. After 3 weeks of classes, background checks, and hellish rejections of the house checks, they were called back to Maria Hill's office.
Tony was awoken the next morning by a phone call. He groggily sat up, careful not to wake up Steve. He picked up the phone and hit the answer button. "Hello?" he yawned. "Good morning, Mr. Stark. This is Maria Hill. I understand you did want to keep updated with the Parkers" she started. Tony was fully awake at this point. "Is everything ok?" he asked, rubbing the sleep of his eyes" Maria hesitated for a moment. "Well that's the reason I am calling. I did send some background information on this family. The woman, May Parker, has turned for the worst at the hospital. She requested to speak with you and Mr. Rogers" Tony sighed, his mind racing a million miles away. He had the feeling that something was going to happen. "We'll be there in an hour" He said before hanging up. Tony leaned in Steve. "Honey? Time to get up" He kissed the gentle soldier's faced until he woke up. "My, isnt this a surprise. Usually, I'm the one waking you up" he kissed him back. "Yeah well our presence is requested at the hospital" Tony informed getting up. His husband reluctantly got out of their bed and got dressed. "By who?' "The woman we saved from the building" the inventor threw on a shirt and blazer and tossed Steve his button up. Although Steve was confused, he went along with it, offering to pickup some flowers.
“You didn’t have to fly in from London, Pegs.”
“Agent America. Cool.”
It took a minute but he waited patiently for Tony to speak up, smiling widely when the answer was a soft yet clear:
“No, I know.” Howard nodded. “If you wanted his money, you were gonna scam him ages ago. No. You’re here, talking about marriage. Meaning you are smart enough to want the Stark family money. That will go to Tony and his spouse once I retire and he takes over the Industries.”
. His Steve nearly died. That sentence was going to haunt him for the rest of his life.
’ children.
The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair, and she swore she'd be my love forever…Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows, fair is the lily of the valley, clear is the water that flows from the Boyne. But my love is fairer than any.”
“Hey handsome!”
Silk words and silk touches.
Steve leaned against the headboard and took his time looking over the pictures. “Mh…wax doesn’t portray very nicely on digital. It’s like taking a picture of an impressionist painting…it looks amazing to capture the details of the strokes and the paints but to get the right illusion you need a little blurriness.”
“Mr Stane gave us the video from the surveillance cameras and Mr Harris pleaded guilty, we don’t need these as proof.” She informed him. “Your husband is a very brave man.” She added. “Not every man would jump in to save the life of their in-laws.”
“I told you I could be your secretary…”
“You’re sick.” He repeated, brown eyes looking up at him. “Why haven’t you told Peggy the truth?”
Tony remained frozen for several seconds, feeling like a fish out of water, mouth gaping and one hand still plastered to the glass where Steve's come was languidly dripping down. Then in a daze, knee-walked back to the bathmat to sit back on his thighs, hands now limp in his lap. His cock throbbed, his mouth was dry and he was so horny he was sure if the cage had allowed he could have cut diamonds.
He tossed and turned in bed, trying to ignore his erection. Completely natural response, Rogers, he tried to remind himself, and absolutely inappropriate. He is in trouble, he is in pain and here you are jerking off over him. Well, the voice of reason in his head pointed out, if you could have your pleasure in him, he wouldn’t be in pain now, would he? No.
New Month, New project! I began this at the beginning of May, but so many things happened that put a hold on this! Hopefully it's worth the wait! my apologies again, I suck at starting fics but... here we go.
They sat in those uncomfortable leather seats, Tony fidgeting his leg nervously. Steve grabbed his hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. "its going to be worth it" he assured. Maria printed out a list of papers and typed away on her computer before standing up and meeting with them. "Mr and Mr. Stark-Rogers...I'm pleased to announce you were approved to foster this child" The pair lept to their feet and embraced each other, crying happy tears. "We're having a baby!" Steve repeated in such joy. Tony kissed Steve and laughed happily. "Lets go get him, shall we?"
Debris fluttered in the sky as the roar of the Iron Man suit echoed over the city. Clint and Nat evacuated most of Manhattan just as the fight entered Queens. Loki was back again with his own army of undead soldiers, straight from Valhalla. The hideous monsters preyed over the city and destroyed the buildings, their dead green eyes scaring civilians and their mighty swords swung and destroyed all that they touched. The dust and concrete floated in the sky as people ran faster, some hiding in near by buildings as Clint shot his arrows and Nat sent her blasters at them. The green ghostly zombies charged towards Captain America and Thor, standing in the center of a road. "Looks like they're lining up" Thor smiled, swinging Mjölnir and conducting electricity. "Well, they're excited." Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers. They high fived as a green roar of rage leaped overhead and pounded on a soldier on a building. "Keep them contained, keep the damage contained" Tony barked through the comms as he blasted at the larger warriors. "Find Loki, take the scepter,  finish off his army" Thor ordered as hew flew off.
Peter sat on the stretcher next to his aunt, sobbing and gripping to her hand. May squeezed his hand and weakly opened her eyes. "My little Peter Rabbit...you hold so much bravery for such a small boy" She wiped his chubby cheeks and closed her eyes. A woman from social services came and grabbed him as the paramedics wheeled May into an ambulance and drove off. Peter wailed loudly as the only family he had left was gone. Tony heard the cries and looked over at the dusty and bloody baby. Steve noticed and his heart shattered. "He was the civilian with the woman we rescued." He said sadly. The other Avengers watched and heard the boy crying and wheezing. The soldier took a deep breathe and walked over to the social worker, surprising the team. "Excuse me... Do you mind if I hold him?" Steve asked as the Avengers followed behind. The agent's badge shined as she turned to face the taller man. "Captain. You were the one to save him weren't you?" Steve nodded, his sky blue eyes, not leaving the boy. She handed him gently to Steve, who instantly warmed up to him. "Poor kid. He's been through a lot" Steve watched as the helpless little boy stopped crying and curled up in his arms. "I'll bet. You were very brave" He whispered to him, chuckling when he heard a hiccup. Tony and the others surrounded the soldier and toddler, cooing and taking turns holding the sniffly baby. "What's his name?" Tony asked as he awkwardly held him. "His name is Peter Parker. Investigation shows he's no older than 2 and the the woman he was with was the only relative he had." The Avengers grew mute upon hearing the news. Tony gave him back to the worker and cleared his throat. "What's going to happen to him?" The worker rocked Peter gently and sighed. "He'll be going to the foster system until and if his aunt stabilizes." Natasha broke the silence following the response. "And if she doesn't?"  "If she doesn't make it, I'm afraid Peter will have to stay in the orphanage" She explained. Tony was heartbroken. He looked over at Steve and an idea hatched in his head. He would have to discuss with Steve later. "Fingers crossed that this little guy has a happy ending" Bruce smiled. The others said good bye and headed to the jet. Tony lingered and watched Peter. he cleared his throat a bit and sighed. "Well, I would like to keep updated on this family..." He mumbled softly. "Oh! Well this is very surprising but you may stay in touch with the Parker's. Here is my card for any questions or concerns you may have." Tony took the card and nodded. "Thank you...Maria Hill" He looked over at the toddler one last time before he left with the team on the quinjet.
Back at the tower, the team of superheroes began to wind down for the day. Thor would be returning to Asgard with Loki the next day and after a day of turmoil, they agreed a sleepover that Stark tower would definitely strengthen their bond. Tony opened up his tower to allow the heroes to bunk in the guest rooms (Loki would stay in a cell until tomorrow). They got dressed in their pjs, ate some dinner, and got to know each other little more. Steve smiled but when he looked to his husband, his face went serious.
OMG Im sorry for the short chapter and for it being a 2 parter, but They were approved!!! They are bringing this baby home! Check in soon for updates! Chapter 3 will be a heartwarming one! ILY 3000!
The duo made their way to Queens Medical Towers, carrying a bouquet of flowers. They checked in as visitors and were told to go to room 454. Tony and Steve loaded into the elevator and rode, their hands intertwined. Tony let out a sigh and inched closer to his husband.He had a gut feeling something was going to happen. The elevator stopped and after 10 minutes of looking for the room, May's room was found. it was dimly lit as they walked in, a heavy smell of hand sanitizer and roses filled the air. There lay May Parker, wheezing with each breath, coughing here and there. In the chair next to her was a social worker, the one who called."Mr and Mr Stark-Rogers. Glad to see you could make it." They shook hands and watched as May slept. "Im sorry, but why were we called here" Steve whispered. "Mr Stark wanted to be updated on Mrs. May and the child you both saved yesterday. Im afraid the prognosis was grim. With many spinal and skeletal injuries and trauma, The doctors gave her only hours left. That was 10 hours ago." The 2 men were surprised and looked to May. "im so sorry" Steve whispered. "Mrs. Parker requested to converse with you both before it was too late" Tony listened to the heart monitor quicken gently and slowly but he looked to the floor. Suddenly, a groan was heard; May was awake but very weal. Her gentle gaze faced the Steve and Tony and a smile creeped on her face slowly. "A-are these the gentlemen who rescued me and my n-nephew?" she quivered but not of fear. "We are, Mrs. Parker " Tony clarified.  This made the elderly woman smile. "I noticed the rings on your f-fingers. You 2 make an adorable couple" she wheezed. "To be young and in love. Ah my husband would have loved to meet you both" A violent cough bursted from her chest, increasing her heart rate. She asked for their story, smiling and laughing at the husband's wedding story. She shared her life story with her new friends, recalling them of her brother and his wife, how they died and left the baby to her and her husband, Benjamin. "When he passed, leaving me with a baby to raise, I just didnt know what to think. My little Peter is such a wonderful tot." She coughed and looked at them tiredly. "Have you any children?" She asked, Steve blushing and clearing his throat. "No maam, but we are discussing it" He held Tony's hand. May smiled, wheezing a little bit when she looked at them. "I know we only met, but I want to ask you both something...a favor if you will" Tony held her rose soft hand and nodded. He had only known her for a day but she was so sweet and kind. "I know how harsh and broken the foster system can be, with no guarantee to be adopted or even kept safe. I don;t want my Peter to go through that, I was his only family left and...and" She started weeping and coughing, holding Tony's hand. Before either could say a word, Steve spoke up. "We'll take him in" May nearly cried harder, kissing the captain on his cheek. "Thank you thank you thank you" She wheezed, the beeping getting little faster. "Please, I only ask that if you could foster him until a family is found for him." She handed them a picture of Peter celebrating his most recent birthday. Tony stood next to his husband and nodded. "We'll take good care of him" he promised. May layed back and winced in pain, Her heart rate increased until an alarm went off.  A team of nurses rushed in and tried to help her. The heroes and Hill stood back as they watched. The aunt laid in bed weak and ill, glancing at the heroes and then towards the ceiling. She choked on a tear, smiling weakly. "Benjamin..."she breathed out. A flat line was heard and the woman fell into a peaceful rest. Tony and Steve gripped their hands and held each other close as they said goodbye.
“It’s unfair, both to you and me, Tony.” Steve said, and got up, collecting the cartons to put them into trash. “This is not a good time to talk about it. I wanted you to come to me for lunch because I wanted you to relax, not because I wanted to have an argument.”
It took another minute before Tony replied but when he did, his heart rate had gone down. First, he sat back, looking at the floor between their knees, then he breathed deep, visibly preparing himself for something.
The alpha would have none of it. Instead Steve grabbed Tony below the thighs and lifted. Their chests were pressed together and Tony’s legs wrapped around Steve’s waist. The omega was hanging onto Steve’s neck for dear life, all the while moaning and pulling the alpha still closer.
"I'm scared of being alone."
Sounded immensely boring to Tony. What were they, an 80 year old married couple!? He was expecting Rogers to be a bit old fashioned, but what the hell? Dinners, and cleaning and.. talk??? When Rogers said "enjoy eachothers company" Tony pictured them sitting in identical arm chairs, knitting or reading a newspaper. The phrase very well could mean that they'd get to fuck but this was the most boring way Tony had ever heard it put.
"That's it.. I'll give you what you want." Steve murmured,
"What's your safeword?" The dominant asked, his deep voice and demanding.
The panic attacks were just another very well kept secret.
“Too tight. I’m not gonna hurt you.” Steve told him.
Tony smoothly slid to his knees on the cushion and looked up at Steve, lightly leaning on his leg. Only then did Steve take the drink from Tony’s hand.
Banner snorted.
“Don’t care.” was Tony’s answer but of course it was mostly the heat speaking.
“Mr Stark is conscious sir, but his body temperature is 93.7 degrees Fahrenheit.”
“Not work related things. It’s sort of personal.” Pepper added.
"Please! Please let me suck your cock!" He was unaware how he was shuffling forward on his knees, "I'd make it so good. I promise Steve, you'd love it. I can make it feel amazing, you can fuck my throat if you like, as hard as you want, I won't complain.. "
He had come to a decision when he was making the sandwiches and that decision was that Tony would learn to cook. After all how hard could it be? He was a genius and he was good with his hands. All he had to do was to pretend it was a chemical process. Even bare ass naked and wearing an apron in the kitchen he was still Tony fucking Stark. He'd nail this.
He rounded the last corner at full speed and was hit in the face by the completely undiluted scent of an omega in heat. Times ten. He reeled for a moment,  trying to collect his thoughts enough to proccess the image before him. Two common thugs had Tony on the floor, one held his tie like a leash with a foot between his shoulderblades as Tony laid face down, the other was trying to avoid getting kicked in the face while he tried to rip the expensive suit pants off him.
Did he have a head wound? Or had blood poured out of his mouth? Caused by some internal damage? He needed to find out fast. He tried to concentrate. He was supposed to be a great strategist and he usually was but… A small voice kept chanting ‘your omega a is hurt and what are you doing?’ at him. Not. Steve’s. Omega.  Still even the rational part of his mind coun’t deny that if Steve could at least touch Tony he would feel calmer.
But before Pepper could tell him to sit down again, Jarvis spoke up.
The mocking smiled disappeared at that, Tony looked down at his hands, then back up at the other man.
"You're not going anywhere." The colonel said. Then in just the right voice, "Sit down."
“Colonel Rhodes.”
"Right now, you're in no position to hope for anything." The bed dipped under Steve's weight then strong hands pulled Tony's hips up, forcing him into a kneeling position with his head still on the bed. Tony felt exposed, his hole within direct line of sight of the Captain. But when he tried to get up on his elbows, a heavy hand between his shoulder blades pressed him back into the bedding.
“Tony..” Steve made to get out of bed but suddenly his nudity wasn’t as unimportant as moments ago.
“Glorified mechanic you mean.”
"See you Merida."
“Tony? What’s wrong?” He was trying to sound calm and comforting but he wasn’t sure if he succeeded. “They are just doctors, they want to help you. You have a head wound.”
For the second day in a row, Tony woke up in Steve's bed. Except this time it was still dark outside.
He exited the alley that connected the two main streets together and looked around the empty block. It was sufficiently late at night that most people were asleep with the occasional occupied cab driving by. He raised his head and subtly scented the air to catch a whiff of the cologne that Tony liked to bathe himself in.
Steve's hand closed around his balls that were dangling between his thighs like an offering in this position. Then the hand moved even lover to stroke Tony's cock. It was already slick. Tony's moan turned guttural.
Steve smiled. "Not the begging Tony. I think you saw how much I enjoyed having you beg for my cock." Seve cupped Tony's cheek and ran a thumb through Tony's bottom lip, for one whole second his eyes fixed on it. Then he let go.
"You always have a choice." Barton shook his head, as if disappointed. "I'm just saying at this point, what do you have to lose by giving it a try?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You reek of him." Rhodey declared, his tone accusatory.
“No one will come in. Tony, trust me alright?”
Rogers sat up then and reached for Tony's collar, where he was standing between the doms spread legs. Tony flinched and the dominants hands stopped.
“Tony..”
“Tony is a regular here..” Pepper pointed out the obvious, sounding a little dazed, “Maybe they just checked if there was any physical problem and no one bothered to ask him anything?”
“I’m sorry.” Tony told him. He looked chastised but he didn’t sound like it at all. For the first time he was resenting Steve interfering with his business. He was apologizing to appease Steve, not because he thought he had done anything wrong. Steve needed him to understand.
“He did.” Pepper said sadly. “Tony is not stupid you know. He was 16. Already more involved in company business than Stane was comfortable with. As much as Stane tried to bench him, and told him not to worry his pretty little head, Tony lost the trust he had in the man. At least, to the degree to hide his heat from him. Who knew how Stane would react to finding out Tony was an omega? He locked himself away, he got through it. I don’t know how. But he held off revealing for sure that he was an omega until he had definitive proof that Stane wasn't going to try and push him out of the company management. He wasn’t expecting to be fucked over so royally.”
Coulson turned to him, “I have no intention of ‘tattling’. Without your consent anyway, Mr Stark. But I think informing the director would be the right thing to do. It would be safer that way if nothing else.”
He needed to find Happy, right now.
“Nothing that we can’t fix. It’s just that, you have forgotten about some decisions you’ve made about your life. And I wouldn’t want to rush you, but it’s important that you know about them as soon as possible.”
By that point Steve was starting to get used to Tony looking at him for guidance. It still felt weird but not unfathomable anymore. Knowing that pre-head-wound Tony would have despised the idea of going to a shrink, he told Tony that it was up to him and he didn’t have to go if he didn’t want to. Still, he hadn’t been able to help himself but remind Tony that it could help.
Few days after that passed uneventfully. Steve always had Tony come to his office for lunch, Tony never tried anything like that first day and Steve was grateful for it. After their awkward conversation at Steve’s office Tony had visited him in the gym, but Steve had gotten the feeling that Tony had done it not because he’d needed Steve but more because he wanted everything to be okay between them. So Steve hadn’t brought up the subject again and they’d both acted like nothing had happened. If Tony felt embarrassed or humiliated by Steve’s rejection, he never showed any sign of it to Steve after Steve had had to leave his own office.
Tony agreed. He did feel calm, everything was clear cut and obvious. He didn't really know why he'd struggled so much in the beginning. This felt really nice.
The bastard sounded so calm, as if Tony wasn't about to tear his hair out.
"And to answer your question," Rogers went ahead, "The point wasn't that you couldn't take orders from me. I was your team leader. I was never your dominant. If you can't see the difference now, trust me, you will see it soon."
"Tony, for what it's worth, I think you've made the right decision." Rhodey spoke up and held Tony's hand, to thread the omega's arm through his.
"God you are so beautiful.." Steve murmured and then there was a second finger pushing in.
"If you wanna know the truth... " he started, "I still a had a poster of you on my wall when I started to present. I left it behind when I left for MIT." He gave the head of Steve's penis a lick and Steve's hips shifted impatiently.
Steve sighed. "I said language. And I mean it. For that, I'll have to wash your mouth out with soap."
Steve shrugged then reached for the drink the bartender was setting down in front of them. He took a sip of the bourbon before he said, "I like him. I don't like him threatening my omega but I understand his reasons. More importantly, have you seen his date?"
"Oh it's not? I thought you understand the concept of fair, between you and me. I am the dominant, you are the submissive. Which means I give the orders, and you obey the orders. Is that fair?"
“Is.. Is that bad?”
“Then you’re mine.” He told the omega, “until then, you belong to me.” He said into the delectable ear just under his lips. The answering “Yes, Steve.” was subdued but content. Tony sounded quietly happy in his submission, and a feeling of bone deep satisfaction bloomed in the pit of Steve’s stomach, filling a hole he had not realized had been there before. He was so fucked for going along with this, but he also knew there was no stopping for him after this point, not until Tony pushed him away. As long as Tony wanted him, Steve would be his.
“I can’t do this Steve. I can’t.. I can’t pretend to be an alpha. I know being an omega doesn’t make me weak but.. I don’t really know who I am, and where I am half the time. I keep looking around for.. I don’t know what to do really… Why did you bring me back? I was good at the workshop. I can work from home. I don’t..”
They'd said their "I do"s and Tony had been kissed and hugged and got congratulated by everyone he cared about. There was no point in lingering when he could take all that home to play with.
"Are you uncomfortable?" Steve asked,
"Shut it Rhodes. I'm a grown man." Tony said, then to Steve, "So?"
"I want to suck you off so badly." Tony murmured in his ear and Steve shivered. "While you're dressed up like this. All authority and power. And I could be naked and on my knees for you. Wouldn't you like that?"
“I remember a nuclear bomb. Fury had something to do with it? And I keep thinking the phrase ‘rage monster’. What even is that? Have we fought a green angry monster? The Avengers or whatever? There was something about an energy source that gives me the creeps. The Tessawhatever. All the bits and pieces are a little disturbing. How do I trust SHIELD? Frankly, you guys don’t have much credibility other than Steve’s word here.”
Tony shook his head, "No I'm.. flattered." he smiled. Then Steve pushed the basket of clothes towards Tony, with a smile on his face too.
Steve looked up from the map in front of him.
Tony seemed to think about it for a moment, like he would open his mouth and answer but then he simply nodded.
“Shit..” He grabbed the wheel once more and tried to concentrate on the road.
“Cap.. Cap-” Tony made a half motion like he both meant to stand up and crawl to Steve, then stopped himself, shivering and.. writhing. There was no other word for it. Steve looked down at the mess that was Tony, for a moment not knowing what to do. A choked sob from the brunette brought him back to his senses.
But Steve was already out of the room, in his tighty whities and nothing else, he ran through the corridor bare foot.
Tony looked down at himself first, then to the pieces of armor that he was still sitting in. Steve watched him, trying to understand how Tony would react to the state of his suit but when Tony looked up there was an odd look in his eyes. Not anger, no, but more of a pleading look, a confused, scared,  helpless look that Steve had seen only once before. It made his blood run cold in his veins.
Tony wanted to ask when and why he'd acquired a 'nice selection', but thought it wiser to be quiet for now.
“That’s the Colonel.” Steve said, not exactly grinding his teeth. Pepper shot him a warning look. They weren’t supposed to outright tell Tony. Steve didn’t hate the Colonel. There was just something that rubbed him the wrong way.
After his shower though, when he had dressed himself back in his day old clothes that still smelled faintly of Tony, he hadn’t felt like leaving, going to his own empty house. He’d talked himself into staying a little while longer, just until his hair dried, then just until he’d finished this bottle of beer. He had asked Jarvis to put in a movie, something old, and easy to watch. He must have fallen asleep after that.
"We'll see." Steve said then he tipped his head back, letting soapy water wash over down his chest and cock, as he started to pull on his cock. Now he was fully erect and Tony was very impressed.
There was a piece of paper on the dresser, between books and odd knick knacks. Tony could see it was a drawing even though he could see just the back of a leg in pencil. Steve was busy doing whatever he was doing with his clothes so he pulled on the drawing, the paper easily slipped free.
“Not your fault.”
It was just Steve. Some kid from Brooklyn, he tried to remind himself. Not the first alpha you had to deal with. Not by a long shot. He is a nobody. Compared to killing Obie, giving a little lip to Steve Rogers was nothing. Tony could get over it.
“Oh.” Tony looked thoughtful for a moment, then “Is he my-”
Tony startled awake feeling like he was hit by a bus, when his alarm went off just a couple of hours later.
On the other hand, there was the fact that Steve Rogers was a dreamboat. Tony had had the occasional fantasy where he imagined the Captain giving different kind of orders in that commanding tone, with that intense look.  But it was more erotic curiosity than any real attraction. Rogers definitely was the top dog. Not to mention he could snap Tony like a twig if he wanted. The thought was scary but still made a thrill run down Tony's spine. Apparently he also had amazing control over all that strength. After kneeling for him and being petted like a dog, Tony's hind brain was already rolling on to it's back and showing it's belly to the strongest dominant he'd ever met.
“But you’re just a baby!” Wanda says incredulously.
“I thought so too,” Steve said with a look of introspection.
“When is the hearing?” Wanda asked.
“Go,” he says into the mop hair. “It’s fine. Thank you, though.”
“And look where it got them!” Tony bursts out. His chest is heaving and there’s sweat running down his back. “They were forced away from their homes, separated from their loved ones; everything they had built was torn to shreds because of what I did. Yes, I saw what Ross was trying to do. I thought I could do some good. I thought I could work things from within; changed the course they were creating so that not only would we continue doing what we could to save this chunk of rock, but I could continue keeping them protected. God, I should have known. Every time I try to do something that will keep them safe, I end up putting their lives at risk. This… T’Challa,
“It—it’s all right, Steve, like you said we both knew this was coming,” Tony bites his lip, takes a shuttering breath, and then looks up at Steve. He’s trying so hard, Steve can tell, not to cry. It breaks his heart in two. “I just—”Tony looks away, over Steve’s shoulder and then seems to come to a decision. “I just hope you know that I love you,” the breath leaves his lungs and the young genius gives a sad little chuckle. “I love you,” he repeats, his voice steady. “And you made me happy. And I’m sorry that wasn’t enough for you.”
“Thanks for telling me. I’m so sorry, Dad. I’m so sorry for what he did,” and he sounds it too. He sounds like he means it.
, but this was different. I could tell. This was a

“Can we come too?” Harley said with painfully false cheer in his voice.
“You don’t know what I’ve done, Sam,” Tony says into Baby Bart’s hair.
“I know you do, Tony,” the Captain says in tone that is much softer than what Tony was expecting. He half thought they were going to start a screaming match right then and there. That’s how it had always gone before, anyway. “And if you’re busy then we could have this discussion later. I don’t want to inconvenience you—“
Tony finally meets his eyes in confusion. Obviously, he had never thought to ask himself this question. He’d just accepted the fact that a random woman had walked to him to confront him about his son. Steve doubts the words murderer hadn’t passed her lips. He wonders how many of these incidents Tony was subjected to on a regular basis.
Two years after their breakup, Tony is hospitalized under mysterious circumstances. Steve had had the near heart attack of one of his kidnappings three months prior, then another year and a half before that, and then right after their split. Those had always been scrutinized by the news and gossip rags. Those times there had been plenty of information and multiple SI press releases. It never got easier; Steve was still as terrified on the latest one as he had been the first time. In his darkest, most selfish moments, he’s incredibly grateful they had never happened when they were dating. He doesn’t know how they might have dealt with that.
It has never been superiority or stubbornness. It has always been guilt.
ledge, Tony! He was about to swing out of his apartment!”
Before that, however, there had been James. James Buchanan Barnes with the long hair and the cool prosthetic and the dark, dark brown eyes that saw all your secrets but gave away none. There was James, who had never been attractive before then even though Tony had known him most of his life. Bucky, as his friends called him and
Sam: hey dude call me when you get this
, while he hid you all away?! Or, better yet, my
Steve chuckles and offers his hand before Tony can retort. He doesn’t miss the way Tony straightens as he looks at them or the quick glance the boy shoots at his mechanic. He knows how important this is. Has seen the genius interact with all the children. And while his shot at a good impression is impossible at this point, he still wants to start this acquaintance as amicably as possible.
Finally, on the night before the hearing was supposed to happen, he found Tony lounging on one of the communal living room’s couches. He had a hefty folder on one side, and a tablet on his lap; his feet resting on the coffee table in front of him. There was a cup of coffee next to them, too, and Steve, despite his anger, was still glad that it was nothing alcoholic. He made his way noisily into the room, he had noticed with shame the way Tony flinched now if someone snuck around him from behind, and cleared his throat.
“I was
“You fucked up a good
“For this, I can be,” the doctor responds determinedly. He doesn’t return the smile, and Steve didn’t expect him to. Both him and Thor are different, now, and well… now they know the story. They’re well aware of what has happened in the last two years since they’d been gone.
Also, I hope you are all keeping safe through this global crisis. I wish you the best if you're in a difficult situation right now, and that it gets better at some point. In the mean time, I hope reading these stories brings you a little respite.
thinking about it. And when they were in school, because Natasha had dropped out of expensive ballet school after their parents passed away, tony sat on the side instead of the middle. And even though it was more awkward than before, they still watched movie together and went to amusement parks and bowling alleys and record stores together. It was fine, really, and well when Bucky smiled, Tony still felt that little stutter in his heart, but he was handling.
“YOU noticed! And you’d never even seen Dora before!”
kid, reached out with trembling fingers and grasped his. Because there was his kid telling him he was going to be okay, and Tony would burn every star in the sky to make that true for him.
“When?” Is all Thor says.
had called him. From the very beginning,
“Your home,” Nebula says, and her voice is kinder than he has ever heard.
“Hey, Mr. Dad?” Peter said, one day exactly eight months and twenty three days
“You only look taller ‘cause you like wearing those weird platform shoe things,” Harley grins. Steve thinks back to a hours before and realizes that, while the spider boy still has some catching up to do, he’d probably overtake Tony soon.
“Though I wouldn’t have said it quite like that,” Rogers said with a meaningful look towards a giggling Cooper and an exasperated Laura. And then, in a move completely unprecedented to the mechanic, he turned towards him and asked, “Tony? Will you be able to join us?”
, he wants to say, but can’t get the words out.
“I’m not the one with that particular bad habit,” the other man replies immediately, though Steve is beginning to clue in. If the retort is that fast it means that Tony has learned that a berating is coming and he has rehearsed for it. They have done each other so much damage.
“I can’t tell you,” Bucky says with a shake of his head. “I promised him I wouldn’t, and even now I won’t. Maybe he’ll want to tell you, someday, if you make it that far but I won’t break his trust. I haven’t in all these years and I won’t start now, but… Sam is going to kill me for saying this, but I need to tell you. Stevie, you fucked up a good thing all those years ago,” Bucky says seriously.
“As I said, she’s a kid that needed help. I know a thing or two about absent fathers,” Tony said without meeting the other man’s eyes. He was the last person to pass judgment, he knew, but goddamn. Cassie was a sweet little girl who adored her father and would talk about him for however long they let her. He’d known he would do anything to keep her safe the moment he had found her and Hope.
, he thinks for a second. Somehow, he doesn’t think this is what Peggy meant.
“No, let me—“he blows a breath to his nose. He feels his jaw clamping shut, fighting against his weakness, but he forces himself to open his mouth. “Wanda reminds me of myself, sometimes. She’s so young and she’s already lost so much, so when she’s… every time she’s in trouble, I feel like it’s on me. I had Bucky, back when I was growing up and I lost my Ma, and I always knew how lucky I was to even have that much. Every time you kept telling me she wasn’t a kid, I—in some way, I knew that. I
“You don’t know that,” Peter whispers into his shirt. “You don’t know that. Every time I feel like I might be getting better I just remember Aunt May, you know? The Vulture’s men… they just—so easy. She was gone, just like that. And the thought—just thinking it could happen to any of you. I just—”
“That’s my job, Pete,” Tony joked in an attempt at levity, but Peter is stubborn, just as stubborn as Tony or worse. Like Steve.
“So Vision’s out of the question,” Steve interrupts when Wanda opens her mouth. He sends her a glare that used to work with Peter when he was in a mood to be sassy, and he’s glad that it works on her too. “Still, we need to find out what’s going on if—”
Steve feels his throat closing at the words, his eyes stinging with the effort it takes to not cry in front of Tony; that is at least one cruelty he can spare him. He already feels like an ass for breaking his heart; he doesn’t need to put more doubts in his head. Still, he opens his mouth but no words come out.
the guilty part of Tony whispers at him.
“I just—I don’t understand,” he says softly.
Tony realizes then. He may be raw and brittle and just as wide open as the captain, but now he’s got the upper hand. He’s been
“How’d you get in here?” he says, and subtly tries to move the kid’s attention from the alcoholic disaster that is his life. he stretches as much as he can in his stuffy shirt, and then slumps back into the chair as his body seems to give out. Jesus, he’s tired, and sleeping in the shop didn’t do his back any favors.
“’Teve! Ahhh!” Nate says and gnaws at his cheek. Steve blows a raspberry onto the baby’s cheek that sends him into a fit of giggles.
I  love y'all and your kind messages <3
,” and nobody misses the implications of that statement, “I chose that months ago. I want to stay.”
. And then he tells about getting the call, and telling Tony, and how he just—he lost it, you know? His Mama was gone, and that just—it shattered him. So I borrowed a car from Jarvis and I went looking for him, and there was—there was left over police tape and debris and—and
Steve feels his own panic climbing, then. He can recall only one instance when Tony willingly talked about his parents before the fall out in Siberia. One instance when he had been drunk off his ass and delirious with grief. Steve remembers how the mere mention of Howard was enough to send the genius retracting into his shell; remembers the instances where pushing too much had led to days of black-out windows in the workshop and a haggard Tony at the end of them. When all these thoughts catch up to him, he begins to frantically think about what date it is.
The other man speeds up to meet Laura halfway, but before taking the baby, his eyes lock on Clint’s and he stops dead on his feet. The archer sees the dread in the other man’s eyes as he takes a step back, and then the distress when Nate gets even more upset. The archer hates himself a little, for hurting his son and putting that look on Stark’s face.
“Seven hundred dollars, Tony,” she shakes her head. He knows she finds him ridiculous.
“They want to speak to her directly,” Vision said and Wanda whipped her head around to look up at him. She let his hand go, and he stepped back resignedly. She pushed back from her chair and wrapped her arms around herself. “Her pardon has been the hardest to negotiate, and the lawyers believe that it would be best for her to be present when her case is being discussed. As a show of good faith.”
“I made you breakfast,” Tony says and grins at them. There’s a mischievous sparkle in his eyes that they have missed desperately, and they laugh. Maybe a little harder than necessary seeing as it’s six forty seven in the freaking morning and all he’d done was pour cereal and milk on bowls, but damn it if seeing him smile isn’t the most wonderful thing.
Soft voices were coming from the kitchen and he braced himself before he entered it. He expected Clint or Natasha or even Vision and Wanda, but what he found was Rhodes leaning against the breakfast counter while Tony rooted around the cupboards for food. He glanced briefly at the frown on the colonel’s face before he moved towards the sink to deposit his cup before moving towards Tony. His eyes briefly met Rhodey’s and though it was still so hard to read the other man he felt as though there was a hint of approval there.
“Bring it on, Rogers.”
“So where will you go now, Captain? To discover this fine country and all it has to offer to a man out of time like you?”
“Hi, Pygmalion. Welcome home.”
“Hey…”
“Yes, Sir?”
“Is that his blood?” Tony asked, noticing the splatter of red on his father’s pristine white shirt. He felt his stomach twist unpleasantly as his brain caught up with his mouth and he looked up to Howard, to his tight lips. “Jesus!” He hissed, covering his mouth with his hand, dragging it down his chin slowly. “What happened? Why was my boyfriend with you?”
“Tony…harder. More.”
Why would Tony even be interested in him?
But everything went black before he could try to answer.
“Sure you are. It’s your dream, is it not?”
City: Rome
“I might not be much company this season.”
“Yeah, probably just a food poisoning. I’ve been avoiding that crappy burger place and I’m good. And I have news!”
“They’re real.”
Steve sat back on the floor, sighing heavily. “Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
“But y’know…Halloween will probably be a bit of a bummer and Thanksgiving, depending on how quick those results arrive. But…but we can do something fun for Christmas?”
Tony blinked awake and glanced over to Steve still fast asleep before he turned to see Sarah sitting in the chair on the other side of the bed, his mother sitting next to her and his father standing at the end of the bed.
“Fuck yeah. Now that’s more my thing.”
“Tu sei…bel-lissimo.” He said softly, struggling a little with the words. But it was worth it to see the grin spreading on Tony’s face, the faint blush on his cheeks.
Day 1 – Castagne
Tony was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a pair of Steve’s large sweatpants that rode low on his hips and nothing more. His hair was still a mess, sticking up all over the place and his beard was unkempt, his back still red from the wax and on his lips a wicked pleased smirk.
“Sure thing, Monet.” Tony teased and leaned in to kiss him. “You’re making me blueberry pancakes.”
“Hey yourself.” She smiled and made sure to hold her cardigan closed as to cover the stain. “How are you feeling now?”
Steve hummed a little before smirking. “Witches and Sirens do.” He said, as it was obvious. “They can travel the ocean flying or swimming, so they came to America while the others stayed back.”
Bucky’s expression cleared immediately and he nodded. “Of course! We can go somewhere fun and party or—do one of your artsy trips and visit a bunch of boring museums.”
“Said he’d be coming as my favorite Captain.”
Steve let out a laugh that felt like a sob when he heard Tony’s voice, felt his hand between his shoulder blades and he slowly turned around, grateful for the hug despite the fact that he was covered in blood and afterbirth and anything in between.
“Or Brian.”
Steve nodded wordlessly, his mouth dry, his brain starting to feel numb, empty as he focused solely on keeping his eyes open, slowly sinking into nothingness.
Tony marched out of the elevator and headed over to the nurse station, opening his mouth to ask about Steve Rogers when he noticed a familiar figure in one of the hallways and pushed himself off the counter and over to his father’s pacing form. “What the hell happened?!” He snapped, trying his best not to raise his voice. And failing miserably. “There’s a dozen reporters out there and two police cars! Where is Steve? What did you do?” He asked, standing so close to his father he could smell his stupid cologne.
“Please. Please Mr. Stark…I-I…ah! I want you to fuck me—harder.” A loud moan interrupted when Tony hit his prostate. “Please, fuck me hard and fast. I’m your bitch! Tony, please, please. I’m your bitch! Make me feel it. Make me come---I’ve been hard for hours waiting to come here.”
“Tony…”
! Tell me what kind of accident results in one of our visitors getting shot and then
Steve huffed. “I look awful.”
“Can we---” Steve paused, looking down at his lap for a moment, blinking back his tears. “Can we wait until next month on the scan?” He asked. “I have to go to the New York Comic Con. I’m gonna present my comic book to the Marvel panel.”
“I've been a wild rover for many's the year, and I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer, but now I'm returning with gold in great store, and I never will play the wild rover no more.
“About a thousand dollars.”
For the occasion he put on a small ponytail hair extension and pulled out from the safe the most garish jewels his mother owned –all in gold, ça va sans dire – to give that extra touch.
Then, while he was distracted complimenting Bruce on his costume as a 50’s cop, that he spotted him.
He wasn’t drunk.
He was a younger version of Tony.
“Woah, hey kitty.” He said softly, scratching the pet behind the ear delicately before turning back to Steve, moving closer. “Look at you...” He smirked. “Shatner is shaking.”
“And do you know how much Tony has on his bank account?”
After everything was said and done, after watching Thor take that damn Tesseract away from Earth… that’s when it hit him.
“Look I’m sorry about that little show back there but…we thought it best of break it to you slowly.”
Sarah clicked the flashlight off and slapped his forehead lightly. “Because I knew you’d get yourself killed jumping in front of a gun to save the first asshole that crossed your way!”
They kept in touch via texts and mails and Steve eventually arrived to the west coast and stopped by. Tony took him to see Hollywood and they spent a couple weeks in his house there before both decided it was time to get back home to New York.
Steve moaned around him, relaxing his throat for him and obediently moving his hands behind his back.
“She says she’ll forgive you if you bake her an apple pie with your Ma recipe next time you visit.”
“I-I…I’m not sure.”
“You can use it again. And Rhodey will cry again.”
Steve sat at the table with the publisher, showing him some of the stories of Iron Man’s origins and talking about the way he’d like to develop his character.
“Look at me.”
“What favor?”
“I wouldn’t expect anything less. So is my blade, it’s a piece from my father’s collection.” Tony hummed, taking the short sword from its sheath and showing it to the other. “The old man loved all kinds of weapons.”
“Easy…” Tony moaned, pressing his hands to the other’s chest to keep him still and Steve could do nothing more than follow his instructions. “Slowly.” He added, moving up and down over him, forcing Steve to follow his pace, his hands touching him all over, silk against his skin. “You’re gorgeous like this, baby.” He purred. “So good for me.”
“Steve…Jesus.”
Another life beyond the one he remembered.
Bucky snorted and turned to look at their ‘prisoner’ before he ran a hand through his hair.
Steve’s fingers moved to caress his hair slowly and massage his scalp. “What are you thinking, my love?” He whispered, the words making warmth spread into Tony’s chest.
“And that’s a hundred stories tower you have. This is a two stories hotel room. I could literally jump down from here without a scratch.” Steve retorted.
“You guys finally getting onto something?” Clint asked. “It’s been five months, it’s about time.”
“And remember my 7
“I had a gorgeous Irish lover once.” He said, moving to the bars and reaching out his mug for Steve, who got up and grabbed the bottle. “Sometimes I couldn’t sleep, I’d remember bad things or have bad dreams, and my sweetheart would stroke my hair and sing me to sleep.” He continued, smiling up at Steve some.
“You’re gonna be my secretary, Mr. Rogers?”
“Steven, he can’t have that! The boy’s seventeen!”
“Shh…I got you. It’s the blindfold. A little too much, uh?”
Turning around, he saw Tony stand by his deep red car in a light grey suit, sneakers, his eyes looking at him intently behind the sunglasses and…everything came back to him.
“God, look at you…”
He could feel something weird in his head, a little voice, every single time he looked up and saw Tony stare at him, he couldn’t tell why…but Stark’s gaze made him uncomfortable. It was like the man was looking for something and Steve didn’t know what it was.
“Go get the potato gun, kid. We have a war to win and we will have no mercy.”
A small snort. “Why do you bother teaching me love songs when you could write better ballads yourself, Rogers?”
“I am.” Steve promised. “It’s really better since I started going to the gym and all.” He smiled. “I probably just had a couple coffees too much yesterday and my body is complaining.”
“C’mon, I made reservations.” Tony prompted as he took his hand to pull him away from one of the churches. “You’ve seen enough saints for one day.” He teased, leaning up to kiss his jaw. “Can you imagine how hard it’d be for a vampire to live in Italy? God, poor guys.”
“Like it’s a chore to cuddle you.” Steve grinned. “You can take them home and read them in bed with me if you want.” He added, a not-so-subtle hint of flirt in his tone.
“Mr. Stark…you can’t call your secretaries ‘darling.” Steve chided in a playful tone.
“You too, Barton. This is Comic-con worthy. Love the guns.”
“You understand what I’m talking about, right Steven?”
“Now you’re gonna become as famous and rich as I am.” Tony told him that night after making love. “Will you forget about little ol’ me?”
So here was Tony.
“Yeah…yeah. I’m gonna work with one of the creators of Thor. I can’t wait.”
Leaning against the railing of their small balcony, Tony was sipping orange juice as he watched the tower in the distance, rain still falling, sated and happy.
“It’s good luck to touch her.” Tony informed, nodding to the statue. “They made it in bronze because of that. The original was getting ruined.” He added. “It’s said it’s good luck to touch her right breast, over the heart, so her sad fate won’t happen to you.”
“I don’t but I probably shouldn’t stress my eyes so thank you, darling.”
They questioned him again but Steve didn’t give them an answer. He knew it was silly but if there was even a single remote chance of being able to live another life or even just a full day in Tony’s universe…then it was worth it.
Hill and Natasha were near the bar, chatting amicably, the first dressed as a hockey player and the other as some manga character, sporting a black short wig. Both looked absolutely stunning and terrifying.
“I’m drawing a comic book, too.”
“And?”
“He got into a fight with Pym on some sciency nonsense in the saloon over a game of poker.”
Steve’s eyes opened once more with the firm order, responding to it as if his life depended from it.
“I decided I wanted my birth name on my comics instead of Carter-Martinelli. But…Kurtzberg is way too long and complicated.”
“He came to my office to talk.” Howard told him, moving to sit in a chair across from him, leaning his elbows on his knees and wringing his hands worriedly. “About you, about how he wants to…it’s not important.”
“But come ye back when summer's in the meadow. Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow. And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow. Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so!”
Steve stood by the side, his hands raised as well, terrified as much as everyone around. He could see the desperation in the man’s eyes and when the gun was aimed at Howard’s chest, Steve’s body started moving before his brain could decide to and he grabbed the man to push him away from there.
Steve nodded weakly, swallowing hard.
Steve stretched his hands some against his restraint, not enough to get free but enough to feel the burn of the soft fabric on his wrists.
Howard had refused to give Tony extra money to pay an apartment to use with ‘that blonde bimbo of yours’ so Tony moved into Steve’s crappy apartment for 4 years, helped him pay the bills until Steve graduated and moved back with his mom in Brooklyn to take care of her. Tony remained in Boston for almost another two years to get his master degree before he joined him.
“Steve, c’mon. Are you kidding?! We’ll help you out.”
A moment he was standing, the next he was laid on the marble floor with people around him and strong hands pressing on his chest, right under his collarbone. “Steve, Steve, don’t fall asleep!” someone ordered but his eyes fell so heavy.
Steve agreed with a sigh. “And we shared it.”
“I pay one of the utilities, cable and half the internet.”
“Yep, I am.” Steve grinned playfully. “Pig in a blanket.”
“So it’s a fake one.” Maria said. “Like one of those Elvis chapels?”
“Oh, this is beautiful…” Steve let out as soft gasp as they stood on the terrace, watching the sunset on the city, he smiled, turning to find Tony staring at him instead of the view before of them and tugged him close in a soft kiss. “You know I love you, right?”
They got tipsy on wine laying on the beach that night, making out like teenagers and Steve woke up in the morning fully hard, happiest than he had in ages.
Steve smirked, moving to almost pour the water before pulling it back and taking a long sip from it himself.
Bucky exhaled a soft ‘Fuck’ and Sam reached out to put his hand on Steve’s knee. Eventually, he looked up to them. “I’ve a day of scans and more tests scheduled in two weeks.”
The Tower was finally finished and Tony offered the Avengers a place to live.
“Aw, Stevie. I’m willing to lay down my whole fleet for you.” He purred and put both his hands on Steve’s chest, sliding them up and linking them behind his neck.
No matter what everyone thought, Tony knew his limits. He had many many years of practicing with booze and he could tell when he was drunk. He wasn’t drunk now.
“Would you sign a pre-nup?”
Steve let out a small huff at that and grabbed a mug, pouring himself some water and sipping it as he watched Stark singing. “I’ll keep him in there to sober up and then let him go home tomorrow, as usual.” He assured his deputy. “You can go, Bucky. It’s nearly sundown anyway.”
“Just-just a little more.” He breathed. “So good. So very
“Tony…” Steve smiled brightly at him and approached the workbench. “It’s so good to see you.”
When the two of them moved officially together in Tony’s penthouse apartment in New York, Steve found a job drawing comic stripes for a magazine and collaborating with a small graphic design society.
Tony pulled him back in his arms, laughing and quickly getting lost in Steve’s kisses, his arms, the scent of his skin, the sounds of his moans as he came.
“Who the fuck cares, Steve. God! You’re my brother, I love you. I don’t fucking care. I would rather live in a car for the next twenty years than let you give up!”
It was the right decision. For himself and everyone around him. But it didn’t mean it was an easy one. The fact that the doctor didn’t fight him on his choice meant he wasn’t just being pessimistic, they too thought none of the treatments would help.
Tony ignored whoever was clearing her throat and kept kissing his Captain, tugging him in to deepen the kiss. Weird, he thought Steve was taller than this.
At some point his mother moved back to sit next to Howard, his arm around her shoulder and their hands intertwined; Tony was sitting across from them, feeling exhausted, his eyes red and slightly swollen as he stared the door intently, praying whatever entity was gracious enough to give him Steve not to take him away from him. He knew he was not worth it but he was doing his best.
Tony started massaging his forehead. “What happened?”
“What do we call this hero?” His teacher asked.
He was about to call his secretary for a coffee – Pepper and Bambi had
“We’re not gonna have a second date, are we?”
“You told them.” Steve guessed.
His boyfriend was hooked up to a couple monitors and an IV, his face was pale but his heartbeat was steady, his vitals normal and Tony made a beeline for the chair at the side of his bed, taking his hand in both his. “Don’t you ever scare me like that, Rogers, I swear.” He told him even though Steve was still on anaesthesia. He moved his head to rest on Steve’s thigh, closing his eyes and letting the warmth of Steve’s hand and the sound of his heartbeat lull him in a light doze while just a couple feet from them, his parents and Steve’s mother were still arguing as if they were on some fucking Oprah talk show.
"This is none negotiable Tony." Steve interrupted his indignant gasp, "You need to get used to a decent and healthy sleep cycle. It'll get easier as you get used to it. After breakfast I'll take a bit of time to go through news, paperwork and reports, while you clean up. this is the time you'll be cleaning up the gear from the previous evening as well as breakfast. Lunch will be at my descrition, depending on what we're doing that day, but dinner is going to be at home this week. You will cook, we will have dinner, then we will talk."
Holding out Steve's shirt, doing up his buttons, helping him with his atrocious belt, then tying his shoes while he himself was still naked was a humbling experience. Not to mention the feeling of Steve's skin under his hands, through small touches, little brushes of knuckles.. All Tony could focus on was Steve now. It was also a little bit ridiculous and Tony might have laughed if he hadn't been so subdued. But now it just felt fine. Steve wanted him to do things so he did them, feeling useful, being helpful.
“Yes, sir?”
"Depends on your definition of duress."
"No." On the screen, Tony answered the reporters question. "He is too professional for that. Steve would never let our personal relationship effect how we work together in the field. Though I'm completely fine with it if he'd rather spank me than file a report on me when he's annoyed."
Alright, I wanna start by apologizing. If you've read this a while ago, sorry for not updating in so long:( And if you've read this recently, I'm sorry that I won't be updating for a while yet.
Steve stepped back, running a hand down Tony's flank then stared.
Steve felt like he wanted to tell Tony to be polite once more, not to talk about himself like that, to stop sounding like Steve had brain washed him or something. And he felt like he wanted to get up and yell ‘in your face!’ to the colonel. But Tony wasn’t done yet, he kept on talking even when the colonel looked like he wanted to interrupt,
After a while of listening to Steve fiddle with cartons and paper bags above his head, he caught himself thinking about dumplings and nothing else. He had seen some interesting and even amazing stuff in the R&D but kneeling here, with Steve’s solid presence, almost radiating heat, smelling like reassurance and delicious food, it all seemed irrelevant. He found that, once more, he could let go.
Steve tried not to grimace at how pre-amnesia-Tony would hate himself for saying something like that. But he didn’t interrupt.
It was a pencil sketch of Tony. He couldn't see the face because the subject was facing the wall but Tony knew it was him because it was from last night where Steve had made him stand against the wall holding pennies, with his back arched and legs spread. It was exactly from Steve's point of view from the couch and was pretty explicit.
"That a Disney reference?"
The cock cage had become an uncomfortable but exciting buzz at the back of his head. All through his mopping and cooking and working, he had been feeling it, but not really. The occasional move would feel uncomfortable, then he'd be reminded of why his dom had put a cage on him and he'd be torn between a tiny thrill at his helplessness and embarrassed frustration.
"Steven Grant Rogers. Will you marry me?"
He planned out the whole conversation in his head. There was no need to be emotional. He would explain to Steve that sometimes subs could just be too far gone to be retrained. Sometimes people would just have a groove carved in them either through this experience or that. And Tony had very deep grooves. It was just too much work to mend these grooves and Steve deserved someone grooveless, someone, shiny and smooth. Plus, he had been doing very well, hadn't he? Steve could maybe just tell Fury that Tony had learned his lesson and all was well. Everything could go back to normal. Tony felt like he'd learned a lot, like listening to Steve, trusting Steve... Trusting Steve..?
“Sure you are.” Steve replied then set the pizza on the table. “Why are they in the parlor? I thought you kept them in the workshop.”
“Tired. But I’m not sleepy anymore. My head aches.” Tony said, again, in an almost normal tone. Steve realized what made it different was the lack of sarcasm, the trade mark sass.
“And mute please.” He said.
Steve considered for a moment if he wanted to insist, but he really didn’t know if it was just Tony, or something else.
“Stane did this. When Tony’s dad died and Tony was hitting puberty, he saw his chance. He saw Tony was becoming an omega, sweet young thing he could both breed and order around. Then why let him have the money? He convinced the board of directors at the time, arguing that there was no way of knowing if Tony would turn out to be an omega or a beta or an alpha. No one wanted an omega boss. They all agreed business and omegas didn’t mix. Tony had to become an alpha. And when he would hit his first heat, Stane would of course be the obvious choice to marry Tony off to.”
Of course. It didn’t matter though,
Steve kept looking at him, sitting on the bed ramrod straight and face devoid of expression. He didn't look cold but he looked nothing like the loving and passionate dom Tony had seen him to be so far either. He was just sort of blank. Hiding, Tony thought. But hiding what? Tony wasn't stupid, but he also couldn't bring himself to believe that Steve might be hiding how much he cared.
Steve hugged him tight as they laid there and all Steve could think was “Why?”.
Pepper eventually wiped her hands on a napkin, put the TV on mute and turned to Tony.
“Alright.” Tony said. “I have no idea what sort of seizure you’re having but infirmary is on the 5th floor.” Then the doors dinged open and Tony left the elevator.
“No. Tony, you were not.” He said and handed over the Starkpad.
That wasn't what Tony had been expecting.
"You know," Steve spoke, startling Tony, the Captain had his back to him, and was languidly scrubbing up and down an arm, "you don't appraciate these comforts enough.. I mean constant hot water? That is luxery."
And Tony heard Steve stand up. Tony panicked a little bit.
Tony pulled himself out of the car, feeling drained.
Steve, good, loyal and smart, had understood what Tony needed. Tony hadn’t expected him to agree. But then Steve had placed his hand on his throat, not restricting his breathing, only holding, gently, but firmly.. He had said he found Tony attractive.. Why hadn’t they done that before then? What had stopped them? Steve had been clear on this point too. Tony still didn’t believe he could have said such things to Steve, called Steve names and pushed him away. Had he really been that stupid? Once he had Steve’s hand around his neck, he had wondered how he had even lived without it for so long…
There was no way he could have kept proudly silent, even during the first few hits. He was yelling and biting the cushions. But towards the end his cries had turned into sobs. Steve's arm was always there though, keeping him in place, keeping him steady, anchored.
"I don't care. Doesn't make a lick of difference."
"There." Gentle hands fit the tip of Tony's cock into the opening of the plastic bottle, then Steve's big warm palm was gripping Tony's cock.
And Steve should want that. He wanted that, for Tony to be fine and to be back to his usual self. Still he couldn’t get out of his head how Tony had called for him, how he had leaned into Steve’s touch. He had started saying something, when Steve had come back to save him from the medics, he’d said “I thought..” and then never finished his sentence.  He had looked so betrayed at the idea that Steve would leave Tony alone.
Steve's mouth was already full but he spoke anyway,
“It’s too soon.” Tony paled further. What was he going to do? Should he call for Steve? It would be the logical thing to do but the captain had already refused Tony several times, calling for Steve now would amount to forcing the captain and even Tony wouldn’t go so low, guilting and scenting the alpha into fucking him would be disgusting, not to mention destructive to their relationship. But what else could he do? How did he used to get over his heats? Maybe he should try calling the Colonel.
Tony nodded absently and started to get undressed to get ready for the day, then he stopped, his shirt half way off.
"You've been such a good boy today. Really, the best." Steve kept talking, his hot breath just wreaking havoc on Tony's neck. His head slowly fell to the side, exposing more of his neck for Steve's lips, tongue, teeth, really whatever he wanted to do to Tony's neck... But the dom merely kept speaking.
“What drugs?”
"Pretty good actually. Uhm.. I know you said this week was going to be about adjusting to this whole Dom/sub thing but do you think I could borrow some pen and paper from you? I'd like to take some notes about my prototype."
"Tonight? Other than the matter of your punishment, just to talk and relax. You can start by taking off your jacket."
“Did we meet here, or outside of SHIELD?” Tony was starting to bounce up and down a little with excitement. He could ask almost anything he wanted to know, and Banner would probably tell him.
"Ohwaanala awara.." he said and immediately decided to stop trying to talk.
Steve interjected with a tight “What do you want?”, ignoring the agents remarks about Tony. If Coulson wasn’t aware of what sort of leverage this information gave SHIELD over Tony, Steve sure wasn’t going to be the one to tell him. First thing he needed to find out was if Coulson knew about the reason for Tony’s pretence.
“You did.. I’m sure you’ll catch up fast.”
"Tony, that's enough." Steve sighed behind him, while Barton tried hard not to laugh. He had black bags draped over one arm and a suitcase was sitting next to his feet.
In the mean time, I know how annoying it is when an author goes so long between updates, takes you out of the story, makes you forget what you've read previously. So I apologize. But I can't honestly say I'll be returning to this soon either. I need some time.
