Dean wasn’t about to deny him, even though it was several hours before he’d assumed they’d get to this point. He still hassled him about it as he wriggled out of his underwear. “We haven’t even made it to the shower yet and you’re all up on my dick. Thought I smelled terrible.”
Dean laughed and put his phone in his pocket, hoping he succeeded at least in getting Sam to stop texting for the rest of the night. The last thing he wanted on any date night was run interference against his brother’s persistent cockblocking skills that seemed to work no matter the geographical distance between them.
So the only thing Dean said was, “Actually on Friday nights we watch the new Dr. Sexy reboot,” and let them laugh some more.
“But you won’t put a ring on it,” she said and that made him startle for a second. “Or is it Cas?  Because until he does, you’re still boyfriends.”
“We’re not going to prom. I’m not gonna give him my letterman jacket. Boyfriend is for teenagers or people who are considering other options. Cas and I are very old and basically married.”
Green-haired girl glared up at Cas from the floor. “So you’re saying always be afraid. We’re helpless.”
The kids laughed a little at the break in tension. Or at the momentary relief of not being the sole focus of Cas’s attention, which could be overwhelming for normal people.
Dean lifted his hips as much as he could to help Cas get the thing from under him, but he couldn’t help feel the sexy vibe leech from him a little.
There was nothing he could ever say that would make other people, civilians especially, understand how deep Cas was wove into his soul, but maybe if he’d said that Dean wouldn’t feel so much like he was lying about Cas. Saying my husband Cas would have been just as much of a technical lie as my boyfriend Cas, but he thought he’d like to say it more.
Dean grabbed the underhang of the chrome bumper on the Caddy and pulled his creeper seat out from under the car. He’d been under there for at least 90 minutes, replacing hoses and allowing his knee to rest. Cas had been very pushy and adamant about Dean not overworking his knee the first week back at the garage under some misplaced notion of obligation or pride to prove he was feeling better than he was. Dean said no, of course he wouldn’t do that, he wasn’t an idiot.
Dean cracked open a tin of soft food for the cat even though that was Cas’s responsibility and followed the usual Cas-finding trail. It wasn’t likely he took the students into his grow rooms, but sometimes he talked to people there because he was just more comfortable in his hot smelly rooms surrounded by flowers and mushroom tanks, but they weren’t there. Then Dean went to the research library, the study, and then the practice room. And Cas’s little student group must have covered as much as they could with lore and unarmed combat, because the scene Dean walked into was a bunch of punk kids surrounding Cas with knives.
He was hoping to slip out without interruption, but he had to leave through the reception room where Mimi and Elisa, the receptionist and Mimi’s 19-year-old niece, were.
Cas occasionally took Dean on something he thought of as a Cas date. It was sometimes a trip to a museum or planetarium, but mostly a trip to a park or natural landmark, where Cas would talk with personal knowledge about life during the Cambrian era or the glacial events that made the lake they were looking over. Those Cas dates seemed to provide him the same kind of contentment that Dean got from driving Cas someplace in the Impala and feeding him dinner.
Dean usually tried to ignore the bluetooth set up in Baby-- he’d finally been overrun by constant nagging in the name of how much more music he’d be able to access on his phone and working in a garage where people did those upgrades. Well, it sucked that everyone was right, but now the wait was bugging him, but he scrolled through his phone to find his Cas playlist to make the drive go faster.
It was also slightly necessary, because apparently Dean’s knee was feeling stickier than he’d thought. The moment he pulled up his leg to get out of his coveralls a sludgy pulse of pain radiated out of his knee and there was that moment of doubt he’d be able to extend his leg again. Dean didn’t say anything, but Cas still noticed. He pushed Dean’s shoulders flat on the bed and untangled Dean from his pant leg.
. The past few years a lot of Cas’s energy and remaining sense of militaristic purpose was dedicated to his very elaborate indoor/outdoor gardening system. Dean’s knee had been bad for years, but it swelled up about twice its size after getting thrown in the woods during a hunt and proceeded to get swiftly worse. The fact that fall coincided with the end of gardening season turned about roughty 99% of Cas’s attention to him. Aside from the “definitely long term lifestyle changes you will need to make for your health,” Cas wouldn’t shut up about “gentle, limited exercise” and a diet regimen to “promote joint suppleness” because his knees were “basically arthritic already, do you want a total knee replacement surgery in five years? Dean, are you listening?”
She was shorter than Cas but had broad-ish shoulders under her denim jacket and pretty muscular legs in her skinny jeans and combat boots. She looked like a healthy, capable, athletic twentysomething, ready to rumble. And it wasn’t like Cas looked sickly or anything, but by comparison he appeared to be a guy in his mid-50s with lots of crow’s feet, permanent eye baggage, and now pretty pronounced salt and pepper. Not quite slim anymore, not obviously muscular. He was even barefoot, and wearing lounge pants and an old bleach-stained Iron Maiden t-shirt of Dean’s. He looked like he was just off a wake and bake, instead of leading a knife fight workshop.
It was a very unneeded reminder just how fucking hot Cas was in a fight. Those were few and far between to see these days, which was great, actually, a fucking relief. But seeing the sharp focus in his eyes, the precise and sure way he held a knife. Did not help that Cas was indeed wearing his slutty yoga pants. They were basically the same as all the other stupid lounge pants he wore around the bunker once he’d been mostly human enough to realize that some clothes had better textures than others. Except he had these light grayish blue ones that grazed Cas’s butt and the outline of his dick like they were trying to make Dean jealous.
Despite intending that “stop texting me” message to be both real and for the both of them, after a few seconds he got another message from Sam.
With his secret still secret, Dean pretended to weigh his clothing options, like he hadn’t already decided he was going to wear the cowboy boots Cas got him for his birthday last year. Since he only got to turn 50 once, Dean decided to go all out. By the time Cas leaned into the small walk-in closet, Dean was fastening his bolo tie with the montana agate slide, also a previous birthday present from Cas.
Mimi said, “Your boyfriend always takes you there on your birthday every year, doesn’t he? It’s sweet.”
Thank fuck, Mimi could sense the palpable dread coming off Dean, and she stepped in with her niece. “People don’t get married for lots of reasons. Don’t be rude.”
“I’m not—my knee is fine. I’m not just leaving early because Cas said. I have to,” Dean realized too late exactly what he was doing. Trying to get out of one embarrassing hole by digging a different one. “Get ready,” Dean finished lamely.
In fact he had a monthly date night with Cas, but it was only for his birthday he bothered driving all the way to Junction City to go to Hanneman’s. Which he’d done the entire time he’d worked at Jake’s.
Cas didn’t hesitate to crawl on top of him, setting most of his weight down on Dean’s hips but careful not to knock Dean’s knee with his foot. “What for?”
a back support belt underneath his coveralls. He didn’t need to look old and feel old all at the same time he was turning fifty. Besides his knee was still sensitive enough that extra changing in and out of shoes and pants a bunch of times drained him.
Dean scowled and pulled away, unimpressed with this verbal trap Cas somehow laid for him. But whatever. He could definitely have patience.
Luís also walked under the hydraulic lift from the other side of the ugly ass Hummer they were detailing, apparently looking to see what happened.
Once they were clean-clean, Dean wrapped a towel around his waist. He pecked Cas on the cheek and realized this was his narrow window of opportunity.
Not that Dean or Cas had always been good at following through on that in their own lives, but it was solid, safe advice for kids that were probably going to be facing many opponents stronger than they were.
So… Dean was bad at coming out. It was the only time he’d ever done it, so that’s not a big shock. But he wished he’d have just said at the time he was married. It wasn't like plenty of people didn't already assume they were married, just by seeing them together.
Cas pushed his hands down on Dean’s shoulders and abruptly got off of him. “No. We’re going to be late,” Cas said in the extremely malicious tone of someone who never ever cared about being on time anywhere before that very moment.
been thinking of, well, not fixing it, but doing something for a long time. And Elisa had kinda put a hat on it, and well, coincidence made him nervy.
There was a little quiet verbless rumble from Cas’s throat before he spoke. mouthing at Dean’s neck and jaw. “You need to abide by a routine of gentle, healthy exercise.” Then like he was simply too annoyed to tolerate it anymore, Cas pulled away, letting Dean’s good leg bounce back on the mattress. He snapped the elastic band of Dean’s briefs a little too much. “Off,” Cas demanded.
The drive home to the bunker was kind of a long commute by design. A lifetime of marathon driving sessions meant the 35 minute drive home was usually relaxing for Dean. A little chance to unwind, barring any stressed out hunter trying to get a hold of him about why their supposedly simple salt and burn wasn’t taking or a paranoid call from Sam when he couldn’t get a hold of Cas for some reason.
He always got a fresh trim at the barbershop the week of his birthday. He always ran Baby through the carwash the morning of his birthday. He always bought donuts for the garage, and a piece of pie for himself, from the Sweet Shack down the road. This year was the only difference, with Mimi Herrera, Jake’s wife and office manager, beating him to the donuts due to the honor of turning fifty. He always made a reservation at Hanneman’s, the best steakhouse west of Kansas City, at the same table he liked in the dark corner. He always left work a little earlier than he normally would. He always got the 20-ounce ribeye and always had a steak sandwich for lunch the next workday.
Dean checked the bowl outside the kitchen for Cas’s stupid cat. Cas had argued that it would be beneficial to have a mouser because human habitation in the bunker blah blah blah, ventilation and food storage yadda yadda yadda. And Eileen and Sam had backed him up saying the bunker was so big, it wouldn’t affect Dean’s allergies all that much. But Dean was pretty sure it was all just a sneaky plan because the first thing Cas did was name the little monster Mafdet after some ancient cat goddess, bought a quilted cat bed, and handed Dean a bottle of claritin. Now there were freaking cat highways all over the place she used to hiss at Dean from whenever he had to take a leak or get a snack in the middle of the night. Whatever, she mostly stayed out of his way and made Cas happy.
Dean ignored the heated feeling on his face, rolled out his shoulders to appear at maximum height and size, and tried to pull a big bad hunter expression, like he was considering kicking RJ’s ass. What he was actually doing was feeling out if his knee was locked up or not, or if maybe as a surprise his back was causing the trouble this time, because that was the stage of life he was at now. Any part of him could just go into catastrophic failure if he moved the wrong way, apparently.
Then Cas did put Dean's heel on his shoulder, sliding one hand down to release the velcro strips of Dean's knee brace. He tossed it aside and rubbed the underside of Dean's calf.
When he was younger, Dean only celebrated his birthday as an excuse to drink more than usual and as a sympathy pickup line for chicks. When he was even younger than that, as a way to score free desserts at restaurants and little else. Now, somehow his birthday was a whole event. Now there was a family friendly portion with cake and candles, and Jack, Claire, Sam, Eileen, and Cas watched a movie with him. Now there was a work portion, where his co-workers roasted him and got him stuff for his workstation. Now there was an exclusive part of his birthday for him and Cas alone, where he could expect everyone to give them special alone time and everyone would go along with it.
, and they made his ass look hot, and shoved the small box in a front jean pocket. The left one so Cas was less likely to reach into it on a whim, because sometimes Cas got horny whims and he had never once respected the idea of Dean’s personal space.
One of the kids in the practice room, the girl with dyed green hair he thought was called Alaina, caught one of Cas’s overhand attacks. She made the mistake of trying to overpower him instead of getting out of his range of attack. As Dean suspected, Cas’s next move was to let go of his knife and used his free hand to catch the falling blade. He gently pressed the knife handle under the girl’s exposed ribs in a silent expression of
“She’s got a point,” Dean said from the peanut gallery. “You look kinda tired. I’d put my money on her.”
So Dean felt bad for leaving early, but not so bad he was ready to rush his 50th birthday date night dinner.
in response said something either really gross or really rad about what long term relationships did to a person. Dean couldn’t tell.
Cas rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to stay home. I’m just saying you could pick a more convenient locale.”
She turned to Mimi conspiratorially. “Which white boy won’t commit? The busted ken doll looking one who’s in love with his car or the old time-y detective one who can’t make small talk to save his life?”
First of all, he’d always thought of his birthday dinner at Hanneman’s, and frankly all of their monthly date nights, as Dean taking Cas out. Dean always drove, because he just did. Dean always paid, because Cas still barely understood the concept of credit cards after all these years, and they’re all under Dean’s names, real and fake, anyway. Dean tried to make more of an effort to look nice on his birthday just so Cas would like it more. Hell, Dean usually bought Cas a gift on Dean’s birthday too because Cas didn’t have one and refused to make up one.
more hunters. He didn’t want more people inducted into hunting. But people got dragged into this life, usually through tragedy, and needed to learn as much as they could, as fast as they could or they’d get dead. Or worse, the whole damn mess could drive them to become like John Winchester, bringing their world crashing down around their own families. There was certainly no guarantee they would get a Bobby Singer handed to them to help them navigate through it.
A very funny response from Sam Winchester, or in a conversation for the Winchesters at all. Everyone in the family could clean, assemble, and load a shotgun in their sleep. No one here even remembered what a normal response to danger was.
Dean slipped back into their room and got Cas’s gift out of the hiding place in the side pocket of Dean’s dust-gathering go bag underneath the bed.
Dean took a few concerned steps forward. “What he means is basically err on the side of caution. Look, I baited you. You’re young and ready for a fight, so I fed that because I knew Cas can kick your ass. Cas can kick a lot of people’s asses. You’d be stupid to be offended by that; it’s a big club. Here in the bunker, that’s safe and you can learn from that. Out there, you may not be able to survive if you don’t adapt quickly to everything you learn.”
“I like it just fine. And I want you to have your enormously oversized slab of birthday meat. You’re the one who’s always worried about getting there on time.”
No life or death emergencies to pull anyone away. No cockblocking family members hanging around for at least another day. No reasons to fear or find discomfort in the waiting, either.
Nothing had happened. Sure, it sounded like Dean had slammed his hand under the hood or maybe been crushed under a falling engine block. But no, he
Cas only looked at him in the mirror but the grumpy set to his eyes and jaw relaxed, and said without hesitation, “I love you too, Dean.”
Dean had only ever had to talk about what Cas was to him directly a few months after he started at Jake’s.  He started getting offers of group outings to bars and blind dates. Mimi had been telling him a lot of details about her single cousin Flora. Dean blurted out “I can’t date ever again because I’m with a man and it’s extremely serious,” like a doctor had diagnosed him terminally bisexual. Gave her the bare details and tried like hell to act like he’d never mentioned it before because he was just so nonchalantly out and proud.
Today, Cas was training some kids sent their way by Claire. She found them on the trail of a vampire nest and totally underprepared to take it on. The soonest they could get to Kansas had been Thursday. And it had been easier to just let them stay overnight, so Cas had more time to get them prepped.
That made Cas look grumpy and he pushed back against Dean’s hips spitefully. “Fine. I guess we don’t have time for handjobs in the shower either then.”
Dean laughed, but felt a little bad. If his knee were up to snuff, Cas probably might’ve taken Dean’s antagonism out on Dean.
But Dean hadn’t expected spies. Brazen colluding against him, like Dean couldn't be trusted to just say when his knee was hurting too bad and needed a break.
Ever since Dean’s surgery, Sam was still in worry mode all the time, mother henning over every little thing. Dean’s fucked up knee was not the end of the world. It didn’t suddenly mean Dean was fucking incompetent. It was like 35 years of driving experience, legal driving at least, meant nothing to this man. Fuck, Dean had once driven Sam and their father to the hospital in a complete white out blizzard, hydroplaning half the way through Mankato, without a scratch or a skid. Now there was a snowstorm.
If he could be a fraction of that to someone who needed it, well, then, he could make his peace with it.
Cas was running the kids through armed sparring. They must have been at unarmed combat for a while before. Cas had some sweat lines under his pits and the girls’ hair looked a little frazzled. In one subtly slick move, Cas used the boy to show them how to use someone’s knife against them in a rear chokehold.
. The resulting old man noises he made were enough to inspire alarm and worry in the faces of the two twentysomethings who he’d once seen try to prank each other by spraying each other’s clothes and food with liquid rubber sealant.
Cas turned away for a second and threw the two knives in his possession into the big wooden target they had for knife and axe throwing, casually wowing the kids without noticing. Then he came back and extended a hand to the green-haired girl.
. He didn’t really stop people saying it normally, but it was date night and he was turning fifty, goddamn it.
That had been somewhat standard, though, in Dean’s post-semi-retirement life. New hunters that came to them usually very much lacked basic hand-to-hand or emergency triage skills. And when they were new to the concept of semi-retirement, even when Dean was still hunting full time but thinking about slowing down, Dean used to flip out over it.
Cas’s hand followed the line of Dean’s half unzipped, motor oil smeared coveralls to the open collar and smiled a rare beatifically untroubled smile. “You smell terrible.”
After a long moment of looking handsome and stoic in profile, squinting at the horizon the car full of young hunters had disappeared into, Dean’s resolve broke down. He pulled Cas into his arms, chest to chest, and kissed him. And kissed him again, and then again for a long, deep, tongueful time. Cas’s hands slid up Dean’s back to his shoulders and back down. Cas’s right hand even kneaded into that spot just above his tailbone that always felt tight at the end of the day. Cas found it right away every time.
When they were driving away, Dean finally gave in and pressed right into Cas’s side and slid his arm around Cas’s back. The air was chilly, but it wasn’t snowing yet. He wanted to touch more than that, but settled for behaving like a normal person and not mauling Cas in the open air like a horny teenager. He gripped the spot right above Cas’s hipbone as the kids drove away.
in response said something either really gross or really rad about what long term relationships did to a person. Dean couldn’t tell.
Castiel took his seat again but remained on high alert. He let his eyes fix on nothing, while snatches of the conversation floated over to him.
“And I’m not ready to leave Virginia yet, all right?” Dean sounded like the confession was wrung from him. Castiel wondered what his monitors showed during this conversation. Tachycardia? Tachypnea?
He watched as Dean’s pupils blew wide open and his lovely mouth parted and he dropped his gaze to Castiel’s mouth. Cas lifted his chin, leaning forward--The shrill sound of Dean’s ringtone startled both men into taking several steps backwards.
He paused, glancing at the door numbers, and –now some five minutes late- opened the door and stepped in.  Dean swallowed as every head swiveled to stare at him.  He hitched his backpack higher on his shoulder.
Hey, he made no bones about the fact that secretions were disgusting. “There’s a reason why I’m a nurse and not an RT, okay?”
He tries and fails to get comfortable in the folding metal chair. The best man is Sam’s oft mentioned older brother
He roamed his hands across Cas’s lower back while he kept kissing his way down his stomach. He noticed that Cas was quivering under him. He took Castiel’s cock in hand and started slowly caressing him, while he leaned over and licked the head. Cas gripped his good shoulder, hard, and Dean took that for enthusiastic encouragement. Dean licked his lips again, and took the head into his mouth, slowly sinking down over the crown before rising up, and letting his cock penetrate his mouth again and again.
“Come on man, I stole one of those recliners from the floor and I’ll get you some ice water.” Joe added kindly, “I can hook you up with a pillow and blanket if you’re wanting to stay.”
Dean just stares into Castiel’s eyes, like he’s trying to see into his very soul. His brow is furrowed and his beautiful lips pressed tightly together as he searches Castiel’s face. Finally, Dean drops his head and releases a long breath.
Then Dean is laughing and pushing Cas’s hands out of the way, opting to just do it himself. He gives Cas a little shove so he backs up against the couch while Dean finishes getting his pants off. He’s standing in his underwear, flashing golden skin and generally looking so edible that Cas forgets that he should be losing his pants too. Getting with the program, he wriggles out of his jeans while Dean keeps his eyes absolutely locked on Castiel. Not used to having such a laser focus directed at himself, Cas falters a little, suddenly unsure about literally stripping himself bare in front of someone he’s just met.
“Yeah, Winchester, I have eyes, what I’m talking about is the beat down Novak gave Rourke.” He eyed Castiel disdainfully.
He stared at his phone, unsure of how to respond. He finally opted for the thumbs up emoji and then locked the screen.
Maybe fifty yards away a twisted wreck of smoking metal lay half inside his shed. He could smell some combination of burning rubber and smoke. His first action should have been to call 911, but instead he ran to the car, looking to see if it was on fire or what. As he got closer he could see through the spidery cracks in the passenger window that there was someone in the driver’s seat. He went around behind the car calling, “Hey are you okay?”
He couldn’t see the expression under Joes’s face mask. He had the feeling that it was carefully blank.
“Dude, it’s not just that. He…he stayed with me, and explained everything.” Dean shook his head very slightly. “He made me believe I was gonna be okay.”
He didn’t care that his boyfriend was not only beautiful, but kind and funny and generous. He didn't care that Dean clearly wanted to settle down and be in a committed relationship. He certainly didn’t care that Castiel knew that effectively, Dean was Jimmy’s boyfriend in name only.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Dean’s chest rising and falling rapidly. I never even took his pulse, Castiel thought. What is wrong with me?
“Mate,” Castiel answers, simply. He rolls them over so he’s straddling Dean. Castiel’s skin is heating as they speak. “What are your thoughts about mating in haste?”
Sometimes Dean wondered if the hospital people knew who he really was. Cas had mentioned a few days ago that he was listed in the computer as Trauma Male Macaw. Standard, he’d said, because he had to have a name in the computer system and a lot of trauma patients came in before anyone knew their name, like Dean. Although he was lucky since he’d given his name to Cas at the scene. Apparently, it made it easier for unconscious patients to respond if they were called by their first name. Familiar.
“Grumpy guy? Beard and hat?” Dean inquired and Cas nodded.  “That’s my, uh, Uncle Bobby. Me and Sam live with him.”
“So it kinda seems like we’re on the same page, here.” Dean said, running a gentle thumb over Castiel’s lips.
“Yeah, you too,” Castiel replied, on autopilot. He sat down, still sort of reeling from the barrage of information he’d just gotten.  He pulled out his phone to check the time. It was 0240 on the 11th now. He scrolled through his contacts until he got to his friend Joe.
It turned out, after a dose of pain medicine and some jello, Dean did actually feel a bit better. He felt pathetically grateful for the reduction in pain. The teeny little bit of food went a long way toward helping his nausea. Turns out, you can get nauseous from being really hungry. Who knew?
. He rolled his eyes. Country music was so not his thing. Who gives a shit if some singer is gay? Who even cares these days? Apparently many people, he discovered. Poor guy, Castiel though. No wonder he’s “in hiding.”
The tickle at the edge of his mind chose that moment to reassert itself, much stronger this time. It was starting to become tinged with fear. Frowning, Cas turned away from the note, and back down the hallway to Dean’s bedroom. He paused outside a moment, just …waiting. Listening. He rapped on the door three times. “Dean. May I come in?”
(I know it’s hard to breathe. You have some broken ribs and they made your lungs collapse. We have to put in a tube to get the blood out of your chest.”
“Oh my God. Dean… you feel so amazing.” Cas sounded wrecked. His hips were moving now, chasing Dean’s mouth. Dean moaned over his cock as he bobbed his head. His right hand gripped and stroked. Dean lifted his head to see how Cas was doing, but kept jacking him.
For the first time since Dean started school in Sioux Falls, he had to get through a day without seeing one friendly face.  He couldn’t help but looking to his left, at the empty chair beside him in the back row. It was stupid, he’d think something funny and then turn to Cas to whisper it, but…his seat was just empty. It sucked.
That brought his mind back around to the call he’d just had with Castiel. The social worker lady had kind of freaked him out by suggesting he needed to go to rehab! ‘You won’t be able to care for yourself safely and you’ll need people around you to help out with ADLs’.
Bobby Singer had to admit: when he got the call that Sam had been beaten up at school and could he please come and pick him up—He’d nearly had a heart attack.
“That’s right. Now go get your school shit out of the living room and take it to your room, Dean. Then you can the old man here fix some dinner. You know I don’t feel right any more lest you two are eatin me out of house and home.”
Hannah groaned. “Committee meetings. It’s terrible. I’ll be back here on Saturday and Sunday, so think of me when you’re sitting around in your pajamas.”
Dean stopped and idled the Impala along one fenceline and watched as the horses munched solemnly on a great pile of hay. They were pretty enough, he supposed, but that didn’t mean he thought it was a good idea to get on one’s back! He’d much rather ride a motorcycle. At least that was something Dean could control, not like riding a gigantic animal with a mind of its own.
Dean tried to lean his head away from the burning pressure but that just set off the grinding in his collarbone. “Urp,” he managed.
Cas clutches at Dean’s shoulders to stay upright, and he just can’t believe how fucking good this feels. Dean kisses and sucks his way down the side of Cas’s neck. He’s on his knees on the kitchen floor, pressing his cheek against the straining bulge in Castiel’s jeans while his hands sneak under Cas’s shirt, exploring his skin, and flicking gently over his nipples.
Bobby felt like a bucket of ice water dumped over his head.  The breath got stuck in his throat for a long moment before Sam added, “Come on, Bobby, let’s go home.”
“I'm sorry,” Cas tells him, and means it. “You deserve such good things, Dean.” They’re staring at each other again. He can’t help looking down at Dean’s mouth, at the perfect curve of his lips, wishing more than anything to kiss them. He drags his eyes back up to Dean’s.
Rolling his eyes, Gabe strolled past the wash stalls. The shelves on the north wall of the barn had iron hooks attached to the top that were good for tack cleaning. Hang the bridle on one and easy-peasy-lemon-squeasie tack cleaning. No stooping, no bending.  Gabriel let out a low whistle as he observed all the bridles that had been cleaned
Castiel ignored him, just kept dipping his chamois cloth in some neatsfoot and kept working on his standing martingale. Gabe craned his neck and noticed that Cassie had carefully placed three saddles on the rail that divided the grooming stalls. Judging by the dust, the saddles were next on the Lady Macbeth tour.
But, Dean. Dean was different. He was like the only thing in color in Castiel’s black and white world. He listened in fascination when Jimmy had first started talking about this new guy, the mechanic who cooked three course meals and had a 15 year old cat. He watched as Jimmy rolled his eyes every time Dean talked about his classic car, or mentioned his little brother (yes, you mentioned he’s a lawyer, Dean, Jimmy would say)
Sam blinked. “Okay, wow guys.” He looked over to Castiel. “You’ve been teaching Dean about his medications?”
Dean pressed his lips together, and shook his head a little. “It was just a shitty day.” He couldn’t help but search Castiel’s face. Sometimes Dean felt like Cas could read his mind. Sometimes he wanted to read Cas’s.
know what it’s like to be single.” Castiel says without thinking. He looks over, but Dean is looking down at his fingernails. Oh, he realizes.
Castiel closed his eyes, breathing Dean in. He pressed their cheeks together. “How about this then? I don’t want to live without you anymore. Move in with me. Be in my bubble. Make love with me, build a home with me, share my life with me.”
“Are you gonna fill out an incident report, Castiel? Why weren’t you wearing your goggles?” Jessica sassed him cheerfully.
Standing in the doorway to Dean’s room in the ICU, Castiel covered his mouth as he yawned. The Intensivist had just completed morning rounds, outlining the plan for the day. Dean continued to make slow progress. Weaning the ventilator was taking longer than expected. The Docs wondered if aspiration pneumonitis was a factor in how slow Dean’s lungs were recovering. They’d decided to start some steroids to try and reduce the inflammation.
Dean looked so miserable and alone that Cas couldn’t help what happened next. “Come here, Dean,” he said, and opened his arms.
Dean shifted on the couch, turning his body more toward Castiel. He reached out with his left hand, using his thumb to swipe against Castiel’s stubbled cheek while his fingers slid into that silky fluffy hair. Cas reached up and held Dean’s palm there, closing his eyes for a moment before turned his face into the caress and kissing his palm.
Castiel reaches out, lays his hand over Dean’s. Dean is just looking down at their entwined fingers like he’s seeing a ghost. “I promise you, if it was in my power to start over with a completely new slate I would.”
Castiel shuffled across his hardwood floors, in sweats with comfy moccasins on his feet. His hair was flattened down on one side, his eyes gritty and only half open and he needed a shave. Working one night had completely fucked him up. He’d be up all hours of the night for the next few days with his luck. Didn’t matter. With five beautiful weeks of vacation he had plenty of time to relax and not think about the hospital.
Jack still took a pretty good morning and sometimes afternoon nap so Dean kept the baby monitor receiver with him as he did the yardwork, checking in on him every 15 minutes or so while he slept.
Smiling, Castiel said, “Goodnight Dean, and thank you. For my lawn and more importantly, for being you.”
Finally, just before Gabe was about to break and make a quip, Castiel spoke. “I invited Dean to come out today.”
Castiel locked up the front door, and went into his bedroom, flipping on the light. He closed his blinds then rolled onto the bed with a small huff. He settled back into his soft pillows, thinking about the events of the day. He took a few moments to just breathe, with one hand on his belly and the other arm stretched across the bed.
“C. Maybe you will fall in love with me. Maybe I’ll fall in love with you. I can’t know what’s gonna happen tomorrow or next week. Last month I thought I would be in Canada right now. I never expected to wreck my car, I never expected to almost die in butt-fuck Virginia, and I never expected
. He felt oddly distanced from everything. He watched calmly as his car shot over a bluff, and crashed through a wooden fence at a rather frightening angle. He watched the world turn over and over as the car rolled sideways down the hill. A tree seemed to fly by the windshield and again Dean had plenty of time to think,
“That means you have a leg that’s not broken. Or, I will pick your ass up and set it down in my car. But you ARE getting out of that car, Dean, and I AM taking you to a hospital.”
Gabriel tried to look innocent. “What? You know how I like meeting your friends.” To Dean, the older man said, “I’m Gabriel, Castiel’s older brother. One of them, anyway. By the way, little bro, Mikey is strongly considering coming back early from Florida.” He paused then added, “Mikey said that Dad was happy the other guys looked worse than you and…who was the young man in your pictures again?” He sounded sly.
Dean shifted against the bed, pushing himself up so he was propped against a bunch of pillows in front of the headboard. “Get rid of those?” He asked, nodding at Castiel’s sweatpants, which by the way, were doing nothing to disguise the very firm hardness there. Biting his lip, Cas slid off the bed and stepped out of his pants. His cock was just as gorgeous as the rest of him and bobbed in front of him.
Dean nodded. “I think I’m still getting enough knee sympathy to swing breakfast in bed tomorrow too, if I play my cards right.”
When she almost hesitantly took it to stand back up, Cas said, “Also when you’re falling, tuck your tailbone. You need to practice that. Are you ready?”
had done. And he couldn’t say some nobody county clerk signing a piece of paper couldn’t possibly be more legitimate than literally defying the will of God and Death and Angels to be together.
Dean actually hadn’t wanted to change at work. Normally he did make an effort not to reek like the garage, especially if they were going out, but willing to risk the smell a little longer if it meant that no one would see him wearing a knee brace
As much as he wanted to get back home, it took a while to actually leave. He lingered at his station out of necessity and good housekeeping mostly, but also because he was mildly disgruntled over being harassed by twentysomethings. So he rushed through clean up, put away his tools and oil rags, brought the car back down to her wheels, and took some time with the degreaser to get his nails somewhere approaching clean enough for date night. By the time he tarped the Caddy it was almost 3:00.
“One, the most dangerous monsters don’t look it, for exactly that reason. Two, you have no idea how to gauge an opponent's experience level when you are yourself so inexperienced,” Cas lectured. “It’s safer to assume you’re at a disadvantage.”
Dean scoffed at Sam’s put upon tone. Like Sam and Eileen weren’t going to take full advantage of their sexile in Santa Rosa. Dean would’ve bet everything in his wallet that the hustle in their step finding some guys bones had very little to do with the general threat level and more to do with having a full day off tomorrow away from the bunker.
Dean had a plan and he wanted to follow it. He had a whole once in a lifetime 50th birthday weekend ahead of him to exploit to its full potential. He did want to pace himself. He could luxuriate in it like he never could when he was younger.
After a minute of that, Dean's focus drifted from eyeing naked Cas to twinges of discomfort that couldn’t be overcome by soft hands. Cas must've seen it in his face because he eased Dean's leg down to bed level, gently bending and unbending his knee the way down. Then Cas did step in between Dean’s legs, much closer, his hands massaging the meat of Dean’s inner thighs, very slightly moving his thighs apart.
The Dean next to him considers this. "Well, I haven't promised anything," he says. "You want me to do it?"
“Hold your horses, boy, I’m getting there.” Bobby hesitates one more moment, then sighs. He leans back and sips from his beer. “Your kid is the new god, and he’s doing a bang up job as far as I can tell. And Cas… your angel is the new Death.”
It takes forty-one year-old Dean five minutes of repeatedly punching his bedroom wall with his left hand, his skin splitting open over his knuckles to match his right hand, and another ten minutes of deep measured breathing, to calm down from the fear and rage. It takes a ten minute shower, blood washing away down the drain from both hands, for the shame to set in.
Dean glares harder at the table. No Banshees yet. Barely any demons. No angels. No leviathan. No Chuck.
Giving up alcohol was no small thing. Dean tries not to dwell on the way it still pulls on him. There is an aspect of it that feels like failure too, like being reliant on anything was a weakness, but Dean thinks he understands what Hank is saying.
Dean eyes him. “Yeah? What does your form look like, anyway? Do you have tentacles? I bet you have tentacles.”
When Dean pulls off the highway and gets out of the Impala, Cas is still standing in his slightly unnatural stillness, waiting for him. Dean sweeps him up in a hug, squeezing him hard, feeling Cas return the pressure.
Cas wasn't offended by it. Humans could believe or not believe. It wasn't his job to convince every single human being of the divine justice of The Plan. So Cas didn't care about the thinly veiled religious commentary, wasn't bothered by the gay angels or the literal war against God. He was a little surprised to find some merit in the accusations of heresy, but he'd tucked it away in the back of his brain and hadn't thought much about it.
Dean had grinned, cheered up by not having to risk electrical shock for the ability to plug in his phone, and clapped Cas on the shoulder. "Knew we kept you around for a reason, buddy."
For a second, Dean wishes Cas was there, but he squashes the thought. It makes him feel guilty, because Sam still comes first for Dean, always will. It’s just… There’s things Dean can’t put on his baby brother, and Cas already knows, has already been there through his panic attacks.
Cas picked up the hands resting on his thighs and kissed the back of Dean's fingertips. "I think I would rather you laid back and let me."
Dean skids around a corner without pressing on the brakes and feels the Impala wobble. He'd never actually flip his baby though. Not like this.
Younger Dean is getting water from the kitchen, watching them over his glass, and Dean thinks that, in another life, he wouldn't have been like this. Dean wonders if there's a world out there where he was allowed to grow up soft - a world where as a child he'd been kind and nurturing without having to be a parent, where he'd been loved and loving without having to be an emotional partner to his dad. But maybe the world wouldn't have let him grow up soft anyway, even if mom hadn't died. Maybe soft, fragile, pretty boys like Dean always get broken by life.
Dean has always said he was never a child, and it’s true. Hunters aren’t. He couldn’t be a kid, not with everything on his shoulders. He’s not going to deny the adult shit that sixteen-year-old Dean was dealing with either. But looking at himself like that, seeing himself for the first time, really…
Dean shakes his head, pushes himself upright. "No, I mean, I need you to stay in this room. I can't have you in there with me. I can't… I don't want you to watch this." Dean lets himself fall back again the door for a moment. "I'd rather die," he says quietly.
Not that there seems to be much in the way of personal info saved to Cas' phone. Dean has to fumble his way around, getting the hang of the "apps" for a while, but he's pretty sure Cas was telling the truth when he said he didn't really know how to use it either.
Sam would have been guilty too, would have blamed himself for Dean putting his neck out to protect him, Dean taking the brunt of John’s anger for Sam running away.
“So, Dean,” Hank says, setting the clipboard down on a little end table next to the chair. “I understand this is your first time seeing a mental health care provider.”
Also, I am not a mental health care provider. Please take everything here with a healthy dose of salt.
“I’ve got Cas to interpret, and new Dean to drink with, so take your time,” she says easily. She winks at Dean. “I brought the good beer.”
“Run!” Benny launches himself where he can see the dusty paw prints end and yells when he is bit. Dean freezes for a second before taking off past the hounds. He can hear Benny’s screams along with the hellhounds snarling and barking. Benny is able to take down one of the three hounds after Dean before he’s bit in the neck. He’s almost fully decapitated, gasping for breath as the hounds move off him and slowly walk down the hallway to the back door.
Gill looks down and runs a hand through his grey hair before he speaks. “I don’t know, sweetie. She...well, she might not come out.”
Dean laughs. “After that bj I gave you yesterday, you’re really calling me brother? I thought you were from Louisiana not Alabama.”
Dean takes a deep breath in, trying to push down the hurt he feels. “We’re in this ghost case. She's haunting her transphobic aunt. Samantha died a year ago and people suspected her aunt did it. No one can prove it. ‘m pretty sure the aunt is some type of witch or psychotic bitch. They found a small bag- like a hex bag- on Samantha during the autopsy.”
She called Uncle Bobby yesterday to tell him that she was going to pick up Sam from school but she couldn’t stop thinking about the last part of what he said.
“Well, it’s not, Sam.” Dean takes a deep breath. “I’m trans, so if that changes your perception of me, then fuck you.”
“Dean, you’re not selfish for making a better life for yourself. That’s human nature.” Bobby stands up again, dragging a chair near the phone.
Mary doesn’t understand why she had to clean the motel room they were staying in. The motel had maids who would clean the room, so why did she have to do it?
Sam sends a quick prayer to God, asking Him to let Mary know that he loves her and to thank her for him.
“Not to sound like a monster, cher,” Benny holds Dean tighter. “But this doesn’t sound like something nearly as bad as it could have been.”
“No, Bobby,” Dean shouts. “I could have waited! Once Sam left for college I could have left with him or- or- or literally anything else!”
“Sam,” Dean says, voice rough. “It hurts knowing that you won’t take the time to do something someone wanted. You may not understand it, but it’s very important to me that you allow people to make their own choices and to respect them.”
She opens the door quickly and rips open her already packed bag. She hands Bobby a small wrapped box.
Sam looks down. “I didn’t know it was that serious. I just thought it was some type of drag queen thing.”
“Dean, seriously, the stubble is not going to magically fall off in the shower.” Charlie calls from the couch.
Sam sits next to the bathroom door. “So get this, the lady we interviewed yesterday about the ghost was the dead guy’s aunt. Apparently, she threatened to kill the guy on multiple occasions because he dressed like a woman.”
Bobby scoffs. “You sure that’s a good idea? She’ll be right angry with you when she figures out it’s fake.”
Hannah’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh, well, she was over one day and while I was trying in dresses for homecoming, she told me she always wanted to wear a dress. We were the same size so I let her try mine on. When she saw herself in the mirror she broke down. It took awhile but she finally told me how she felt like a woman and not a boy.”
Dee sits up to face her. “I just...I’ve always felt wrong being a girl. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”
“Well, son? What should I call you?” Bobby takes a sip of his beer. “I may not fully understand, but I’ll try to make you as comfortable as I can. It’s the least I can do as your friend.”
She takes a breath in before stepping into the bathtub to wash away the evidence before they go back to Uncle Bobby’s house tomorrow.
Charlie purses her lips. “Dean is...well, he knows what happened to her. And if we can get Bobby to give us some iron weapons, I’m sure Dean will explain it to you.”
Dean nods and stands, offering a hand to Hannah. “Thank you for your time, contact us if anything comes to mind.”
Dean shakes her head. “No! He doesn’t use me as bait. Jesus Christ, Sam, I just meant that you hate hunting. I actually enjoy it. So what’s the big deal if I get a little scratched? I’m fine so it’s fine!”
“What does that mean, Charlie?” Sam stands up and grabs her arm. “What do you mean Dean’s suffered for me?”
She smiles again and kisses his cheek. “Alright, enough sap from you, Pine Tree. I’m going to bed if you want to join me.” She winks and starts up the stairs.
“Yup!” Charlie looks at Sam. “We were on a case nearby and decided to visit the man we’ve been talking to these past few months.”
Charlie recognizes the glint in Dean’s eyes and nods. As she shoves everything in sight in her bag, Sam asks, “What? Why?”
Cassie takes off the bracelet and hands it to Bobby so he can look at the engraving. “More like a bracelet, but it means the same thing. I’m surprised he didn’t tell you that. You were the one who gave it to me last Christmas.”
“Nothing,” she says quickly. “I was just wondering if you’ve taken T yet. My friend's cousin's boyfriend’s uncle is trans and he has a shit ton of testosterone he’s supposed to take. He doesn’t anymore, something about microchips from Russia or something. The guy’s crazy.”
“Exactly!” Dee takes a deep breath in. “And even though I can do things better than my dad, sometimes, he never listens to me because he calls me a girl but I don’t feel like a girl. So, maybe, I’m a boy.”
Bobby scoffs. “You’re in my house and as long as that is, you’ll abide by my rules. Sam goes on hunts when he wants to, he’s still in school, anyway. He can’t miss too many days.”
“Blonde hair, red shirt, uh, pretty tall. Maybe about 6’2”? Dean shrugged. “He pushed me out of the way before heading out the back door. I thought it was weird so I ran in and saw my brother passed out on the bed next to his girlfriend who was stabbed in the stomach. The room was on fire so I checked for a pulse on Jess before grabbing Sam and running out.”
Mary whimpers, tears streaming from her eyes as John’s alcoholic breath burns them. John rears back his arm and punches Mary in the face.
Dean laughed before blowing out the candles. Sam, Bobby, and Charlie clap while Benny messes up Dean’s hair.
Charlie nods and looks at Sam. “C’mon, big guy. We need to get you to our hotel room before the shock sets in.”
The three of them go back inside. John doesn’t come back that night so when Bobby drives the two of them back to the hotel, Dean hands Bobby a gift for Sam tomorrow.
“I’m sure she’s one now.” Sam laughs. “Every time my dad forced her to go to some school dance, she would leave early. All of her dates were pretty much hand picked by either dad or Uncle Bobby. She hated wearing the dresses and make up, but I caught her a couple times with her best friend, Cassie, twirling around in them after the dance was over. I’ll always remember how happy she was then.”
“Yes, already done.” He snaps. “You’ll take the car to a hide out in Rochester and when I’m done, I’ll meet you there to give you directions to your new safe-house.”
“Hey, Sam!” Dean calls out. “Next time you see dad, tell him I said ‘I’ll see you in hell,’ alright?”
Dean threw her duffle bag at him while he was talking. It hit him in the face with a smack, the extra boots doing a number on his nose. She takes her silver switch from her pocket and stabs him in the chest.
“Miss Arbeit,” Sam leans forward. “Can you tell us about anything strange that happened that night?”
She can see her in the classroom still, Mr. Willer talks to her about something. She walks in the classroom again.
Mary- no. Deanna. No, that doesn’t sound right either. She scrubs a hand down her face and sighs. Dee. Dee works.
“My dad had a similar thing,” Sam remembers how John ransacked the burned motel and car for the Winchester Journal he was known for. He went crazy trying to find it and was never the same suave guy on hunts ever since. “He lost it in a fire with my sister. She got killed by a demon for laughs.”
“You know I can’t do that,” Benny looks down at his hands, crinkling an old receipt he found in his pocket. “I can’t let you give up.”
Dean looks at Bobby. “Dad’s been through some shit, Sammy. He doesn’t know how to express his emotions.”
Principal McDonald nodded. “I understand, but don’t you want to go to college as well? You’re the best student in your grade, you have a bright future ahead of you, Deanna.”
He starts with the back section and holds the sharp edge to his hair. This is it. After this, he’ll officially become a man. Dean Robert Winchester. Dean.
“For you, bitch.” Charlie sighs. “It’s not easy to say this, but that hunt a year ago actually killed you. Dean made a deal to bring you back, but instead of ten years, he got only one. It was a big request, i guess. He’d do anything for you, Sam. It’s his job.”
“Pretty sure it’s a ghost, Mare.” John slurs. He throws the empty bottle in the trash and reaches for another. “Why don’t you lay down for a bit and rest up before we go research, eh?”
“Well, he wanted to keep it a secret. He took me on a couple hunts after that. That camping trip in July was actually a hunt for a werewolf. It only took a day so our plans were saved, thank god.”
Sam laughs and shakes his head. “We’ll visit the friends first. Kimberly Slater, Terrance Oscarlee, and Hannah Arbeit. They’re the ones okay with the ghosts lifestyle. I think Hannah was the one who was closest to him.”
“Please do,” Dean says. “Charlie is coming tomorrow, she’ll take my room. I need some space from this.”
Dee leans in closer to her. “So if I asked you to call me Dean, you wouldn’t mind if I kissed you right now?”
Dean laughs and grabs a couple paper bowls for both of them. “I won’t leave your worthless ass to starve. Now come over here and help me make some grilled cheeses.”
Bobby laughs softly. “Yeah. He was a smart kid. He built an EMF when he was ten out of an old walkman I had.”
“Well, son,” Kelly pats Dee on the shoulder. “I’m proud of you, whether you’re a girl or boy. Any adult would be lucky to have you.”
Sam looks down. He never knew Dean ran from him. He just assumed that Dean was making his parents proud. “What happened?”
Dee almost cracks her neck with how fast she looks up. “That doesn’t sound...right. You can do that? Just change gender like that?”
“Okay, mom. I love you, too.” Jane runs off with the rest of the students and Kelly looks for that blonde girl.
He thought it was a small nest of vampires but it turned out to be a serial killer. He located the guy and gave him to the cops within a day. Overall, it was a small trip and took about two days. The only thing that lengthened his stay in the nearby city of Lafayette was a guy named Benny.
“Come on, Sam,” Charlieleans down to look at him in the passenger seat. “If we don’t save Dean, you’ll probably never get to reunite with your sister.”
“Good. That’s good.” Dean looks down at his watch. “I’m going to hang out with Cassie tonight. I’ll probably sleep over at her place.”
He finds her sprawled on the burning bed, half her body on fire. Dean coughs at the stench and tries to choke the fire off of her body. He picks her up and runs out, picking up a few photo albums as well. Firefighters are at the front door of the building with oxygen masks for Dean when he gets there. one of them rushes to Jessica’s body but Dean shakes his head.
“You know,” Sam whispers to Charlie, while Bobby and Dean throw sassy insults at each other. “Dean shares the same birthday as my sister. He kinda looks like her, too.”
“Sam!” Dean sprints into the room where Charlie and Sam are sleeping at 11:50pm. “Charlie! We gotta go. Now!”
“Yeah, well, I just wished my sister could have seen this.” Sam says, pulling out his keys, Mary’s old switchblade is his keychain. “Without her, I don’t think I would’ve been here to see this or meet you.”
Dean and Benny laugh for a while, rolling in the sheets under the sunlight peeking in through the window of their room.
“Sir?” Dean stands up and looks at John’s face for a second before looking down at his boots. “Is it alright if you leave the journal here so I can add more information about Wraiths I found?”
Dee shifts her weight in the chair. “Look, Principal McDonald, I know There’s a month left. I would continue if I could, but I really need to start working, especially now. My dad was injured on the job last week so we have no income right now. I have to pick up more hours or another job to help him.”
“Mary? Are you alright?” Bobby sounded worried over the phone Mary had in her hand. “Be honest with me, girl-“
“Not much.” Benny reaches into his back pocket for a small folded up piece of paper. Dean raises his machete. “Come on, brother. I thought we just talked about it.”
“Well, not every car.” Dean blushes. “There’s a few I can’t fix at all. I'm not the best, but I'm not the worst.”
The two sit in silence until they reach the hotel. “You know,” Dean starts. He takes a breath in. “Sam’s not a runner. He faces his problems head on. Hec won’t stop until we kill that son of a bitch.”
“Mary always did know what to get me,” Bobby says, turning the book in his hands. He reads the blurb on the back as Sam pulls out the gift he’s been dreading.
Bobby leaves the room as Dean hits Sam with a pillow. “No, bitch, it’s for my friend Cassie. I was supposed to visit her today but it’s okay, I’ll visit when I come back.”
They’re about an hour out from Grand County when Garth calls. Sam picks up and listens patiently to Garth’s rambling introduction before he seems to get to the point.
The memory shifts and jerks, and it catches now-Dean off-guard. He thought for sure they would get to the part where John drained two beers and a glass of undiluted whiskey and asked Dean if he'd known about all of it. He thought they'd watch the part where John's rage was ice again, when all he did was slap Dean once across the face before heading up the creaking stairs, where all his passion had been used up on Sam. Where Dean had stayed up all night, stripping wires until his fingers bled, kept company only by the bottle of whiskey.
“Hang on,” Dean says, coming to a halt a few inches in front of Cas. "Hang on a damn minute, Cas. Name another one."
“Look, Sammy, I promised I’d give it three months. And I will, alright? But let’s just go ahead and make a blanket assumption that no, I do not want to talk about it with you.”
"I don't think so." Sam sighs. He would have preferred a shield - or a full body of armor, or a nice wood-panelled room he could lock his brothers in for a while to keep them safe.
“So, supposedly it’s over,” Dean concludes, after an abridged account of their defeat of Chuck. “But how am I supposed to believe that? And even if Chuck… If he’s really gone, our name is still out there. There’s any number of sons of bitches who’d like to kill us. So if I… I already worry about the people I’ve got. It feels like inviting people into the freaking shadow of Death just to have a passing good opinion of them. I don’t need anyone else, and I don’t want the burden of anyone else’s death on my shoulders. I’m just… I’m tired of losing people, man.”
Older Dean and Sam found out about Adam years after John's death, but dad is still very much alive to Dean, even if they aren't in the same timeline anymore. Dean can't imagine facing his father after this. He's not going to have to, probably, but there's still a chance he gets dragged back there.
. I remember changing Sam’s diapers and making sure he was fed and… I mean, how the fuck did I do that? How did dad let me do that? I don’t remember ever being that small, but I must have been. Right? I remember starting to think there was something wrong with me that I couldn’t keep up, that I couldn’t be what my dad needed me to be. I felt like I was failing all the time, ‘cause I couldn’t handle this responsibility of being an older brother. But. But… Jude’s so small.” Dean gives up and puts his face in his hands. He lets his shoulders heave once, drawing in a ragged breath.
He's running out of backroads to drive on. If he keeps it up at this rate he'll be back on a highway soon, and as much as he wants to run, that's not why he's out here.
"Well. Yes. And I don't know, man, I wasn't there. I get that it was bad and we both made some choices. But I know you. I still know you. And you'll always be the boy who stayed after school to tutor the kids who were struggling, the kid who dragged me to volunteer at animal shelters, the frikkin' toddler who brought me a baby bird that fell out of its nest and cried until we put it back. You're not evil, man. You don't have it in you."
"I'm fine," he says, one hair off from a snap and Sam raises his eyebrows at him as he pours himself a cup of coffee. It's strong and bitter, of course, because Sam and Dean were the ones who taught Cas how to make coffee in the first place. Sam opens up the fridge and dumps the last of his soy milk into the cup.
," Dean had said, his six year-old voice tremulous and practically on the verge of tears. "Don't go. We need you. Just 'til Sammy's better,
Dean's grandparents are nearby, but they don't come around often. Pamela is around somewhere, eyesight fully restored. Dean even runs into Missouri, who he hasn't thought about in years.
Dean watches the way younger Dean's eyes follow Jack out of the room and sighs. They're going to have to send those two on a bonding trip or something, because Dean can tell already from his younger self's face and the friction between them that the primary emotion between the two at the moment is an uneasy jealousy.
Like Dean hadn't spent half their childhood keeping Sam out of the way, taking the fall, getting between them.
Dean lets go of his face and touches his hand to his own mouth unconsciously. “What the hell was that for?”
Dean drives a little ways out from the bunker, still in the heart of Kansas, to this little copse of trees off a backroad. There's a strip of grass out there that is green and dotted with wildflowers, buzzing with spring and insects.
Dean can't even be upset; he's just glad he can still make this Sam laugh. He pulls a mock grimace and waves a warning finger at him. "Hey man, you might be older than me in this timeline, but I'm still your older brother, I still raised you from a snot-nosed brat. I retain all rights to sagely advice, no matter what my alternate self has fucked up."
Dean puts his arm around this strange older version of his baby brother, an odd feeling that he can't describe twisting in his gut. The last time he saw Sam, he was eighteen and storming out into the night, leaving Dean behind with only the shreds of a family left to him. The last thing Sam had said to his face was to tell Dean that he was a pushover and a coward, yelling at Dean to think for himself, accusing him of only ever following blindly in dad's footsteps. And the last thing Dean had said to Sam… Well. He's pretty sure it was yelling back that Sam was selfish, that you didn't walk out on family. Something like that.
"Dean -" Sam starts to complain, then stops. He looks at Dean's face, then away. "You're not doing anything stupid, are you?"
"So how'd it happen, Cas? Did Jack rescue you and offer you the job, or...?" It's hard to be nervous in Heaven, but not impossible, apparently. They're edging closer to the last time they saw each other. Dean thought he was ready for it, but he's not. He's still himself. He's not good at talking, not good at any of this.
"Pull it together, Winchester," Dean mutters to himself. He's close to losing it, and he can't. Not yet.
"Dean," Sam says, and then he stops. The silence feels ominous, even in the dark of Dean's closed eyelids. "Charlie called yesterday. She found some cursed art forum stuff for us, and info from one of the previous dealers of the vase. Looks like we got it wrong about Cerodicus being trapped inside it. It seems like he's actually bound to the vase itself. If we can perform a binding spell on him, just a normal spell, binding him back up should fix the vase and he'll be trapped again. We won't need to use Jack's powers."
Short of running away, of going to Bobby or letting Sam get taken by CPS, Dean doesn't really know what else he could have done.
And huh. Cassie. Cas. Dean never thought of it before, but his first love and his best friend… It's kind of funny.
The thing that is eating away at twenty-six year-old Dean isn’t Hell or the demon blood or the frikkin’ apocalypse or any of that - it should be, but that is so far beyond Dean’s ability to process, something that he may never actually go through, that he’s kinda able to shut it away. No, the thing that is going to kill Dean is
But Older Dean just parks the Impala in a spot outside the building and unlocks its front door with one of the keys on his keychain.
Cas didn’t know at the time that this was the kind of question that people in relationships ask each other, the same way he didn’t imbue any extra meaning into the way Dean had started to turn to him sometimes on long drives and ask him what he was thinking.
Sam shakes his head. "He'll grow on you, I swear. But you're welcome to use the range if you want. Maybe, uh, give other Dean a little time to blow off some steam first."
Chuck told them once, and Dean believes that was real surprise in his voice. Castiel was never supposed to rebel, just happened to come off the line with a "crack in his chassis," a split in the seams of his faith and obedience that Dean managed to worm through with his own persistence and blind obstinacy. Cas falling, always so literally falling, for Dean wasn't destiny. It wasn't pre-determined, wasn't something Heaven had planned. They weren't soulmates, weren't
just come into its own. Jack's doing that. Oh, a little nudge here, a little push there, but for the most part it's…" Cas gestures vaguely over the ledge. "It's not part of some great cosmic plan. It just is. It's just life. And death. And death is very… administrative. I'm keeping track of the numbers."
Dean tells him everything he can think of, tells him that he's sixteen, which surely is old enough to be looking after his little brother for a couple of days, tells him that of course their dad is staying with them, that John works two jobs and comes in late and leaves early, that's why he hasn't seen him since he dropped Dean and Sam off last Wednesday.
Dean breaks off sniffling again. At this point, it barely registers. It feels good, talking to Cas, even though it cuts him open. He even thinks he's telling the truth here. He knows that he has to try and live some kind of life now. Sam and Eileen have been talking about stepping back from hunting too and are going to look around the area, maybe settle in Madison. Sam and Dean didn't have to say it to understand that they both still want to be near each other. Maybe not right on top of each other any more. There's room, without Chuck, to make a little breathing space between them. It's not going to be easy, but Dean thinks he'll be able to handle it, and Sammy will be alright. Sam has Eileen, and Dean can't find it in him to be too bitter about that.
"No one's dying," Sam says firmly for like the hundredth time that week. "We're not gonna let either of them die. Not from this. And as for why Dean at twenty-six, I don't know. It seems like a Crowley kind of thing to do, you know? Mess with Dean's head, make us think we have to pick which one of them lives."
Cas nods, apparently fine with taking words of caution when it comes from Sam. Which, Dean thinks, actually seems pretty fair.
And any other morning, Sam would assume that Dean was in the shower or had come upstairs without him noticing, or had fallen asleep in the library again. But Sam knows. He just knows.
Sam has a few scratches on his face, but he otherwise looks unhurt. The knot of worry in Dean's chest loosens, the relief a warmth he didn't know he was missing.
"Briefly, yeah, in 2009. They put out a new album, but don't worry, you hate it. I was surprised, honestly, I'd have put odds on them killing each other before they ever worked together again."
Dean had been so hungry, but after that first night he wasn't going to bring it up. He'd just made sure Sammy was fed and tried to ignore the new sensation of his gnawing stomach.
Cas makes a little noise of surprise and, like he didn’t plan it or think it through at all, he kisses Dean. Dean puts one hand on Cas’ neck, grabs the front of his stupid trench coat with the other, and kisses back. It’s not a kiss that’s going anywhere, but it’s sweet, slow, something that isn’t about sex at all. It’s just easier than speaking.
The wave of denial and anger that Dean has been riding for six months crests and crashes, bringing him tumbling down into the riptide. Grief seizes him and buckles him over. It winds him, leaves him gasping like a blow to the stomach. Everything is blurry, everything aches, and Dean grips his fists into his own hair and sobs.
It's the sad, tired, kind of schlumpy guy who kisses Dean who is also the first person to want to hold him after. He pulls Dean into his chest, their bodies aligned, spooning, just cuddling him. And what Dean hated in that moment more than anything was the realization that he wanted something like this.
Of course, a lot of the time Dean had just slept in the Impala. It was cheaper, and less lonely somehow. He'd curl up in the back under dad's old leather jacket that still smelled like the old man no matter how many years Dean wore it, with a flashlight and a paperback book he'd found at a thrift store or stolen off a tourist's table or something, and read until he fell asleep.
"Honestly, Dean? I think you're out here because you're being fucking suicidal." Sam's anger is back, but Dean recognizes this one as his mask for hurt and desperation. "And I'm not telling you this because I think you did the right thing with Cas. Whatever he deserves, Cas
Cas doesn't really understand why Dean calls him this sometimes. He knows it's a term of endearment, and he knows that Dean says it sarcastically, but it's also… it's only ever with Cas.
, exactly, just strange. It’s a sort of buoyancy that has taken up residence in the same space where his anxiety sometimes pulls at his chest and stomach.
“This is… Dean, this is senseless.” Cas isn’t crying, but only because he seems too pissed off on top of the pain. “You said we should talk. Let’s
"You don't get to make Cas' decisions for him, man. I know that's - look, I'm not trying to dredge up all our shit, and I'm not saying I've got room to judge or throw rocks, okay? I know you want to do the right thing here. But I'm telling you, giving up like this isn't it."
“Oh yes. You boys feel that?” Molly waves a hand around in the air. “Quite cool in here, isn’t it? You don’t think a house as old as ours has central air conditioning, now do you?”
“You are good to your core,” Cas continued, low and soothing. “You never deserved to endure the things you faced in Hell. Whatever may have come of Heaven and The Plan, I still know you to be righteous. You are worthy, Dean. Worthy of all forgiveness and grace.”
"Yeah," Dean says, because he can't shake the image of his own hand wrapped around Cas' throat. "Fuck. Fine. Find me a shrink."
Eighteen-year-old Dean stops scrabbling at the demon's hands as he presses the pillow over his nose and mouth, suffocating him. He fumbles instead for his clothes, discarded on the floor. He's going lightheaded by the time he fishes the necklace out of his jeans pocket and blindly shoves the Magen David into the demon's face.
Well, no, he didn't, not really, but he never thinks about it. Never. Hasn't in over a decade. It isn't even conscious suppression anymore. It was so long ago and so much has happened since.
All Dean knows is that his younger self flings himself in front of Cas and Dean loses track of the arrow, but he sees younger Dean falling to the ground. Cas is on his knees in an instant, calling Dean's name, his voice broken, desperate.
They were quiet for a while. Long enough that Dean's fingers ceased to feel like ice. He didn't take them out from under Cas' shirt though.
Dean's memory turns to another hospital, and present-day Dean makes a strangled noise where he stands beside Cas.
“There’s never time.” Dean sighs and rolls onto his knees, pushing himself up. His very bones ache and he mourns the lost cinnamon roll briefly. “C’mon, kid. We got our sob stories out.” He reaches down a hand and Sam lets him pull him up. Dean gives his brother another brief hug, thinking to himself that he’s going to need to drink a half bottle of whiskey the second they get back to the bunker to forget all of this.
Cas makes a pained sort of sound that might have started as a laugh. He leans down and presses his lips to younger Dean’s forehead. “You are so loved,” Cas whispers against his skin.
Crowley’s long, lingering gaze rakes over Dean’s body this time. “Sorry, darling. I gave you one fix. He’s an extra. He doesn’t belong here. Don’t twist your pretty little head up about it.” Crowley winks at him, an amused expression playing on his face. “If you need a distraction, for old times sake, give me a call. Otherwise, stop summoning me.”
In fact, the problem is that sacred trees or blessed wooden artifacts turn up too much information. Sam, seemingly acting out of habit, delegates areas of research to Jack and the Deans. Cas gets to do whatever he wants, apparently, because he gets through more material than any of them, is the only one who can read Greek, and Sam trusts him to prioritize on his own through some unspoken nerd code.
Dean wants Cas too, wants him so bad he doesn’t know how he’s still functioning without being able to touch him properly, and it’s so, so tempting to push it. But sex is… Dean thinks it would probably be good. Quite possibly mind-blowing, given that Cas probably knows his body better than Dean himself does. Dean really, really likes sex. It’s fun. It’s a connection to another person.
“It was the last great period of the dinosaurs, you know. I don’t understand why modern artists insist on depicting the dinosaurs as scaled when they’ve known for years now that almost all of the species they’ve discovered had feathers. Plus they never take into account the different possibilities for fat deposits and musculature, so everything ends up in the shape of the skeletal structure, which isn’t a great tool for accuracy. I’ve always thought, personally, that chickens share a great deal in common with what you call a Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
“What are we making, anyway?” Dean cuts a generous amount of butter into a pan and dumps in the onions he chopped.
When Cas stops, Dean nearly walks right into him. He catches himself and does not go careening into Cas’ back as much as a certain traitorous part of his brain is insisting that it would like to. He has really, really, got to get a grip.
The entire room shakes. Dean jumps and Cas jerks his head up to look towards the ceiling. The walls are rumbling.
“Yeah,” younger Dean says. He tosses one to present day Dean. “Here, old man. You think you could swing that at an arrow?”
Cas' fingers slide beneath Dean's cheek and tilt his face up. Cas looks down at him with such earnestness, so much tender affection that it could absolutely wreck Dean.
“Guess I just wish you were here. I… I always wish you were here. Felt that way when you were alive too, so maybe it’s not that different. You were always leaving, and I was always letting you. I’m sorry. Fuck. I’m so sorry, Cas.”
Dean’s stone number one has always been family. Sammy, when it comes right down to it, but, yeah, people. Saving people, hunting things. Loving people. Losing them.
It's one of the few things Dean always knew he was naturally good at, why it seemed right to him that his life was going to be full of violence when he was practically born to shoot. His memory of the first time dad took him to shoot bottles off of an old fence has always been washed with gold, with that feeling of dad praising him. John had seemed genuinely impressed, openly proud of Dean for what felt like the first time in two years. It was one of the only times in his childhood that Dean felt like he'd actually done something right.
They are saved from filling in the remaining decade - and from Dean get truly sloshed before 10:00 am - by Cas arriving in the doorway to the library. He hesitates there, looking between them.
"I know, Dean." Cas' voice is gentle, kind. Like maybe he's had this conversation before and was even expecting it. At least he calls him by his name without hesitation, like Dean is still a person.
Cas does not touch him, does not force him, but he holds out his arms and Dean… Dean sort of falls into Cas, lets Cas wrap his arms around him, not so much a hug as being held, warmth and strength and protection.
"Thank you for your assessment of my powers," Cas says dryly. "Next time I will ask for your opinion on nonlinear interdimensional geometry before becoming a dispersed wavelength of electromagnetic radiation."
“Dammit.” Dean wipes his face. He takes deep, shuddering breaths. Miracles have happened before. Cas has heard him before, come back before.
*A note on Eileen's Judaism: Listen, okay, I know there are lots of reasons Eileen would not normally be the one to perform the Final Kindness for Dean, but we don't know that she *isn't* part of a
“We’ll start searching tomorrow on a grid, go over everything again, anywhere you missed,” he says tonelessly.
Dean unpacks the last of his belongings that night. He’s already put his photos out on the nightstand he found at a thrift store, although he’s planning to find frames for them this time. All that’s left are some clothes in the duffle bag, but as Dean is digging them out he feels something in the corner underneath the stiff bit of plastic canvas that makes the bottom flat. Dean digs his fingers under the flap and feels cold metal. When he pulls his hand out he’s holding his old ring.
Young Dean scowls at them, but he shrugs. “Whatever. So future me has got a stick up his ass about Jack using his power, right? Is putting the vase back together going to kill him or something?”
“C’mon,” Dean says again, laughing a little. “Dude, I didn’t even finish highschool. I don’t think I ever got a grade above a C in my life.”
For reasons that no one will explain to Dean, everyone else seems upset with the idea of letting Jack use his powers. Jack himself doesn’t seem as worried about it, but Dean can tell there is something more there that they aren’t telling him.
Dean had said "Is this another of your 'human categorizations are inherently meaningless' things? I get it, life is pointless, we're all gonna die and the universe won't mourn us, etc etc. Super nihilistic for an ex-agent, of Heaven, dude, but I'm on board."
Sam’s eyebrows have creased slightly by the time Dean looks up, like he’s puzzling through Dean’s words to find whatever they’re hiding.
Cas certainly didn't have a gender before he fell. Or, if he did, he had a gender like the Spanish word for "homework" has a gender - something purely linguistic. Or, maybe, it was purely theoretical - he had a gender in the way that light is both a particle and a wave. Or, perhaps, it was just that Cas had never thought much about it as a being of light perceived primarily by other beings of light.
A lot of Dean's music is tied up in memories of Cas now, which is a big neon warning sign Dean doesn't need. Cas is there in REO Speedwagon the first time they went through a Taco Bell drive through, complaining that this was
Every piece of self-preservation he had told Dean to say no, to shut him down and out, just turn off and stiff until the tenderness in Cas' voice went away.
When there is that all too familiar rustle, and Castiel suddenly appears in front of him, Dean startles, grabbing the ball instinctively, the only item he has at his disposal.
Cas’ eyes are still closed and he looks a little miserable. He nods. Dean wants to kiss the sadness out of him.
"Tell me something, Cas. You say "the observable universe." Is the unobservable universe Chuck's multiverse, or...?"
"Ah," Dean says, uncertain how to respond to this. The couple of people at the exhibit with them are starting to stare and point as the elephant continues to focus on Cas. "That's real sad, Cas. I'm sorry. Um. Does she want something from you though?"
for a life where the Winchesters didn't get every exception in the book, where they were neither blessed nor cursed, where there were no Big Bad Evils, but no miracles either. No more Chuck, no more insane deals, no more bargaining their souls away for each other, no more fighting for their storyline above the fate of the world.
Because of course. Of course one of his own demons is the things he wants. The darkest, most desperate desires of his heart.
"Ineffable," Cas repeats. "I suppose you could say that. Inscrutable. Intolerable. I'm not much of an angel, you know. Not how you'd understand us to be if you could have met the rest of my garrison. We are warriors of God, soldiers of Heaven. I rebelled and fell a long time ago, Dean. A long time in human years, anyway. And even after I fell, I wanted to believe in my Father. I've always tried to have faith, like a good son, a good soldier. It is not a simple thing, to look on the face of God and wonder if He is fallible."
"They're the child of an angel and a human. Very rare, very frowned upon by Heaven. Jack was born three years ago, and nephilim grow up quick in some ways, but we've kind of been raising him in other ways."
“But Hell, I don’t know, Sammy. Maybe place doesn’t matter so much, but, yeah, I see your point. Hard to think about a future in an underground bunker. If… uh, if we make it out of Endgame, what do you think? You and Eileen gonna find a house somewhere? Get a regular, boring ass job, finally have a real kid of your own?”
Eileen turns to younger Dean, practically beaming. Younger Dean's eyebrows have shot up and Dean squirms internally. He was such a little shit at that age. He was insensitive and kind of misogynistic, and probably ableist, and he doesn't like to think about any of that. He doesn't want Eileen to deal with any of his twenty-six year-old self's problematic crap.
Dean keeps his shirt on when he’s not in the water, too weird and self-conscious about his body and hyper-aware of the all the twenty-something tan and cut queer guys littering the beaches. He and Eileen stay on the beach at first, getting a little sun drunk and eating chips, laughing at Sam trying to outswim Cas, now out for revenge at his premature dunking into the waves.
"Uh." Dean would probably have laughed at anyone who said "social support network" to him in his life, but the answer is not really funny. "That's kinda it. We've got the hunter network and some friends who are still in it. My friend Charlie's been heading the central network since we left, sometimes we video chat, and our friends Garth and Jody check in once in a while. But… it's, uh, if you're trying to leave the life, it's hard to stay in touch."
"Look, are you ever going to talk to me about what happens to us?" Younger Dean shifts in his chair. "Sam told me some stuff last night about the last couple of years. Getting possessed by an angel, and Cas dying, and you and Cas, uh, falling out pretty bad recently over this Jack kid getting someone killed. He wanted to make you seem less like an asshole, you know. But he said there was stuff you should be the one to tell me about what happened after… after dad died."
Younger Dean kneels on the other side of Cas, looking stricken. "He was fine before we… teleported or whatever."
Dean hadn't counted on Cas crying, and he told himself that was why he'd wrapped his arms tight around him, rubbed a hand up and down his spine, and eventually, when Cas had calmed down again, tossed a blanket over them, mess and all, and fallen asleep in Cas' warmth.
“It’s something brave,” Cas goes on hastily. “To love like that. And to love even after all you’ve been through.
Sam, angry, defiant, the sheer raw energy of being eighteen angled in the tensed lines of his body, still looks like he's been slapped.
Dean lays on his stomach and tries to turn off his brain, but it just keeps spinning. He’ll probably be dead soon, or someone will be. He doesn’t let himself think about where he’ll go when that happens. A part of him just… It’s not that he wants to die, not really. It’s just that, when he does, he wants it to be over. Heaven or Hell, whatever’s waiting for him, he just wants to know that that’s it, there’s no more false hope in coming back, no more hurt he can cause Sam.
“I had faith in the plan then, faith that I would know what I needed to when I needed to. But this wasn’t about need. I wanted to know more than I’d been told. I located where the famous Dean Winchester was supposed to be while I was in the area, and I turned up.
“No, no, you don’t understand. I can always hear it. You can hear it too - the sound of space breaking through your radio waves, the static, Dean, that’s the sound of the universe.” Cas had turned his big blue eyes up to Dean, always looking at him like that, like Dean was something valuable, something central to Cas’ being. “When there’s static on the television, that’s space, it’s all radiation and waves. I’m all radiation and waves. You know that, don’t you? I burn brighter than you can imagine.”
Sam just rolls his eyes, already pulling things from the fridge. "It's good for you. You can't live off of burger and pie forever, you know."
Younger Dean looks up at him warily from beneath some pretty sick bruises and nods. "Yeah. Whatever, man."
Twenty-two-year-old Dean doesn't see any good options laid out before him at this particular crossroads, and so he makes the only choice he feels he can.
I'm sorry about younger Dean (see: Crossing Lines), but I wanted to give Dean both the death he deserved and the life he deserved. We should have gotten at least one.
They do indeed lie around on the beach with drinks that come served with little colorful paper umbrellas. Dean’s not even embarrassed about it - his margarita is huge and cold and fucking delicious. He catches Cas watching him lick the salt off the rim of his glass and grins at him, winking.
Dean frowns at him. "I hate to say it man, but that sounds like a lot of bullshit to me. You've been together for
There is a sudden crash, followed by a string of curses and screaming, which is pretty much the cue. Sam kicks the door in, and Dean follows after him as they barrel in to a dimly lit corridor.
The man sighs. His eyes on Dean are hungry. "Come on," he says again. "Four hundred for an hour. You're not going to get a better offer tonight. We don't even have to fuck. I just want to slap you around a little and maybe use that mouth of yours."
John stops, his hand still raised, panting, looking down at Dean like he's vile - no, worse than that, like he's nothing.
No Cas yet, either. No one who looked at him like this, who noticed when he was drifting too far off in his own head and pulled him back.
Dean digs his fingernails into the wood of the back porch steps, feeling it give way easily enough. He'd balked when it seemed like Sam wanted them both to go to a professional for real. But then Sam had announced he was abandoning law school to become a social worker, of all things. And Dean wasn't above poking fun at his brother, but, really, it made sense for him. Sam was good with people. He was sensitive and open, he got people to talk, and he wanted to help. Sam wasn't a quack, and unfortunately, Dean was pretty sure this meant he was going to have to accept that not everyone in the therapy business was either.
Dean looks down at the cement beneath the creeper where oil stains are scattered Pollack-esque, even in Heaven.
This is the point where they usually start arguing, where Dean gets defensive and Sam gets stubborn and they end up unresolved and cranky. But Dean didn’t come down here to pick a fight. And anyway, with this song in his head, in the mood he’s in, this strange, tired, detached sort of place in his head, he can understand where Sam is coming from.
It’s something that Dean has never allowed himself to imagine, because thinking about what it would have felt like to have been loved at that age, to have been shown attention and tenderness, would be admitting that Dean wanted those things. That he wants them now. It was pointless to think about it back then - he probably wouldn’t have survived it. There are things that Dean hides from himself because it’s easier to live without knowing about them. He learned how to do that young.
This is how it always is. The brothers in this car, the smell of gunpowder, leather, and whiskey wrapped around them like a home, waiting through the darkness for whatever comes next. The world always promises to end and then it
He turns to take a good look at the two other guys and immediately raises the gun again, finger going to the trigger.
"It's not about you, Jack. Not really." Sam stands up before Jack can ask him what he means. "I'm gonna go check a few things. See if he took any of his phones or anything else I can track."
Dean hadn't planned on letting Cas stay. He'd figured they'd fuck and then after an acceptable minimum, he'd kick Cas out so he could sleep. But he hadn't planned on Cas' face when Dean finished and crawled back up to lay next to him.
Dean is getting a better sense of his future self, recognizing himself more and more as older Dean begrudgingly allows it, but this is
“Yeah, okay.” Dean didn’t come here for an argument either. He looks down at Cas, at his handsome, tired face. He’s spent more of the last eleven years staring at this face than he cares to consider, but he never gets over looking at him. That alone should have been a big fucking warning sign in the beginning. “Listen, can we talk?”
He hears it when Constantine says "You like this don't you?" and Dean's breathless, wordless agreement.
"I'm begging you, man - " Dean's interrupted by the sound of footsteps. He and Sam turn in unison, Sam reaching inside his jacket for an angel blade, Dean hoisting the shotgun he's been holding at his side.
Dean's head is still pounding. He rubs his temples absently. Cas has gone right back to staring at him, like it's habit.
Dean swallows, caught off guard and abruptly torn between defensiveness and the need to talk to someone about this. “I… I don’t…”
It was a handful of touches in quiet mornings in strangers' living rooms, before Sam woke up, gruff whispers telling him to be careful not to wake the baby, or being groped in the dark corner of a bar when he went out to hustle pool money, or a hunter as old as their father with tobacco on his breath whispering all the things he'd like to do to a pretty boy like Dean for a full half hour before John had come back.
Dean blinks, trying to decide if Cas is being sardonic. The troubling thing is that he's pretty sure he's not. "Wait a second, dude. I was kidding. You telling me you've actually got wings? What, do you have a halo and a harp too?"
From there, things get easier. Sam adjusts his computer search to include a number of different spellings and shortenings: Cerodicus, Xerodicus, Cero, Xero, Zerodicus, Serodicus, Zero, Sero, Cerodycus…
“I suppose I did brand you, didn’t I?” Cas whispered against Dean’s skin. “I meant to claim you as Heaven’s, the mark on all souls who have been saved. I did not think to claim you as mine.” Cas kissed up Dean’s shoulder to the curve of his neck where Dean’s head was turned to the other side. “Even if the moment I touched your soul, I knew.” Cas rested his face in the soft skin of Dean’s neck, inhaling the smell of him - that gunpowder-whiskey-leather smell of home. “I will not say you are mine if you do not want to be, Dean. But I touched your soul, and it was… You were the most singular point of being in the universe, everything collapsed in on itself into this point of light. I saw you and I knew… I was an angel of Heaven, Dean, and I had never known the sort faith stitched into your soul. Your unyielding love. It was blinding and unbearable. I thought that looking at you must be something like what other beings feel when they look at an angel’s true form. Only instead of burning, you…” Cas’s breath hitched against Dean’s neck. He was still caressing Dean’s other shoulder with his right hand, his left slotted against the proof that he had once touched the raw soul of Dean Winchester, runaway savior of Heaven. “You unmade me. Slowly, I think, and then all at once. From the moment I touched your soul, I think some part of me came undone for you.”
"Hey, if you don't like it you shouldn't have named him after me while I'm still alive. I can't just call him
Cas brings Sam a jug of water with a cross hanging in it from a shelf against the far wall. Dean watches carefully as Sam takes a drink, makes a face, and hands the bottle to the older Dean. Older Dean scowls but he takes a drink without flinching.
Dean had snorted and said “What does that even mean? Are you telling me to say the Serenity Prayer, doc? I stayed out of AA for a reason, you know.”
After another twenty minutes and a couple of turns that lead them up and away from the sound of the rushing river somewhere out of sight, they walk into a new copse of trees and Dean can just
“You heard the wraith back there. It’s been doing this all over the country for years, and no one ever had a clue. It’s not like they report increased cases of chronic insomnia in the papers. We’re so stupid.” Dean clenches his hands into fists. “I mean, we were always listening to police scanners, why did we never think about getting plants in hospitals? There’s so many signs we could have had people looking for. I always thought dad was right and it was better to be on the road, to go where the hunts took us, but how much did we miss by not staying in one place long enough to even know what’s normal?”
"Dean," Hank says, like he can see this happening. "I've said it before and I will tell you as many times as you need to hear it that this wasn't your fault. You didn't deserve to be hurt like that, physically or emotionally. I'm not blaming Sam either, but your brother had agency, even at twelve years old. You didn't deserve to be blamed for his decisions."
about it, so Dean pulled him down by the back of the neck, kissing him hard, trying to put a lot of unsaid desire into the way he arched up against Cas. And Cas, surprisingly, seemed to understand what was being asked of him.
Dean is used to clothes being a size too big on him, and there's something deeply comforting about borrowing Sam's clothing. They always used to share when they were younger. He takes a moment to look around Sam's room, at the neatly made bed and scattered books. There is a TV on the wall, but not much in way of personal effects or decoration.
Dean likes it that way. He thought maybe he’d want to be a full-time pediatric nurse, but dealing with sick and injured kids every day takes its toll. The emergency room is its own form of stress, of course, but it’s a good distraction. The nurse manager shuffles him around and lets him request assignments most of the time.
Sixteen-year-old Dean, standing in the parking lot sweating under his usual protective layer of flannel, just got the call from John saying he was back at the motel. Dean hasn’t told him yet, couldn’t bring himself to call him over the phone and confess his failure. He’d been holding on to a desperate hope that he could find Sam, or that Sam would come back on his own.
"You okay with just helping yourself to whatever's in the fridge? I was gonna make myself a green smoothie for dinner," Sam says when the books and files are arranged to his liking.
Dean strips down to his boxers, and Cas follows his lead, getting under the covers as Dean turns out the light. Cas pulls Dean into his chest, arms wrapped around him, and Dean tangles their legs together, curling his hands up against Cas' ribs, arms pinned in the heat between their bodies.
"My boy. Dean. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, son, for everything." John's rough voice speaks directly into Dean's ear as he holds him harder and longer than he ever has. They stand like that for some time, feeling their way through things. Dean is overwhelmed by it, but it's nice. He's not self-conscious about crying in his father's arms, and John just holds him, exactly the way he should have held Dean as a child and never did, at least not after Mary died.
Younger Dean rolls his eyes. "I'm just asking. I mean, you know, I thought I was pressing my luck to think I might see 30. I never dreamed I'd get older than that. So, I don't know. Not saying I want to quit now, but after everything you and Sam have done, you guys ever thinking of turning it in? Packing off to Hawaii or something?"
The universe is chaos and statistical entropy. Dean has already been given more chances than any one person could expect to have. This isn’t exactly comforting, it isn’t even a fully conscious thought in his head, it’s just something he understands as Sam rushes toward him and stops, hovering, too far away.
"Hmm," Cas said, letting his head rest gently against Dean's. "I suppose I'd rather have you, snakes or not."
"And it's not like I'm gonna get better. Not at this. And it just… it feels selfish to… I mean, you could go find someone who could actually give you a life together. You should. Fuck, you really should, Cas. Because I can't do it. You know I can't."
Fourteen-year-old Dean takes the cash and stuffs it into his inside jacket pocket. The man smiles, turns around and starts walking down the block, knowing that Dean will follow him.
Dean wanted kids of his own once. He'd liked Lisa a lot, of course, maybe even loved her, but half of loving Lisa was in being something like a dad again. When he'd moved in with them, he'd just lost Sam, and spending time with Ben had hurt and healed him at the same time. He'd kept thinking how he'd do it right this time, how this time he wasn't just a four-year-old struggling to hold his baby brother. And then the thoughts of Sam would shut him down and he'd end up closing off Ben anyway.
“It’s just… I feel like a lot of stuff’s been coming up lately,” Dean admits. “I keep thinking… You know, my nephew just turned four. And he’s this incredible kid, reminds me so much of Sam at that age, but he’s mischievous like Eileen too. He’s a sweet kid. And I keep looking at him, thinking ‘he’s four years old.’ He’s just a baby.”
Four weeks later, Dean has a room in an old farmhouse that's way too big for just him and Miracle, and a barn renovated for commercial licensing that already features a modern bathroom and a small bar space. He's got five acres of land he doesn't know what to do with, and an extra cottage that probably belonged to a groundskeeper at some point at the edge of the property that's falling into ruin. It's all a bit extravagant, really, but Dean's committed, so.
That even though he wasn't born to earth like Anna was, this is just his form on earth now, because it's the form he prefers. He can barely imagine what it would be like to take another vessel, even though he could, even though maybe, if he picked a different kind of body, he could have the things he wants.
“No, I’ll… I’ll go with you,” Dean says. He feels, for reasons he’s not willing to look into, suddenly shy.
"After everything, if you're so eager to walk out on your family, then leave." John's voice rises, breaks off without breaking. "But I'm warning you, you walk out that door, you better not come back."
“Get down on your knees and worship at my feet,” Charlie’s voice says over the line. “‘Cause ya girl has come through once again.”
So what if Dean and Cas never… So what if they never held hands or kissed or fucked or whatever. Dean never would have understood it when he was younger, but that’s not all love is. Cas knew every inch of Dean from the inside out. Technically speaking, Cas had touched Dean more intimately than anyone else ever would. Cas had gripped him by his fucking soul. And even after that, he’d still loved Dean. Still thought Dean was worthy of that kind of love.
John gets into the passenger seat, not looking at Dean. He notices the way Sam is glaring at the back of his head though.
It had been after Sam got his soul back, after the worst of his hallucinations. And Dean just… he was trying to reassure himself that his own soul was mostly functional. He'd wanted to ask Cas to check, but Cas had been broken then too.
Cas has got to be in his mid-forties, at least in appearance. He's an angel - an actual celestial being with the power to time travel, wipe memories, and put people to sleep. Dean's willing to bet there's a hell of a lot more that his grace can do. He's kind of weird, but clearly smart. Clearly capable in a fight or he wouldn't be around.
"You got something on your mind, son?" Bobby calls. Dean can just see his shins from under the car as he sinks down onto one of the work stools.
Cas looks human, actually. A little more human every day. He says he still doesn't sleep, but he looks like he needs it. He's looking tired, old even.
Cas' expression is one of an endearing sort of long-suffering. "Yes, you still have your car. There are also a number of vintage vehicles in the garage that I could not begin to name. If you'd like, though, we could take one out."
“But -” Dean starts, and then stops. He crosses his arms and scowls somewhere around Hank’s collar. “But I
How patient Cas still is, Dean thinks as he checks reflexively for any cars following him in the dark onto the road that leads up to the garage entrance.
"This is exactly how it changes things, Dean. You lose hope. When we lose someone, when we lose Cas, you spiral. I mean, look, I do too. It feels like there's this colossal weight on my chest all the time. But at least I know why I wake up feeling like I can't breathe. I can't bottle that up or pretend like it doesn't exist, or it would kill me. The way it's killing you."
Dean is thinking again about things he'd rather ignore. He's thinking about the last time he'd died and how he wanted with such a deep unsettling calm for it to be final. He's thinking about younger Dean saying "you've got
