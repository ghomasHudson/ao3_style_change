The angel stayed awake for a long while after Dean had fallen asleep, making sure to chase away the nightmares that threatened to consume him before finally drifting off to sleep himself.
“Alright, up we go little boy. I have one more surprise for you tonight and then its into bed with both of us.” Cas wrapped his Dean up in an oversized towel, drying him quickly and efficiently before carrying him through the doorway that connected the bathroom to Dean’s bedroom.
Dean wasn’t an Omega.  Pretending to be one to stroke his husband’s ego and grant himself a vent of grace to pretend he didn’t have any responsibilities of his own, it was a slap in Michael’s face.  Michael, who deserved only roses and satin, who gave so much more than he took, who had taken beating after beating from the Universe and every alpha he’d ever met, and bravely shook it all off to try once more to have faith…in Dean…deserved better than this.  Dean thought back through the last couple of months, at his whining, at his conceit, at his blatant abdication, and his mindless entitlement.  How did Michael find anything about him to love?  Was it purely hormonal?  If they didn’t share a set of bonds that wrapped around their psyches so tightly as to be irrevocably braided together, would Michael still love him?
“Good. Get dressed and go back to class. It’s time. Take this note to alpha Jo so she knows you’re on orgasm restriction.” He scratched out a quick note, signed it, and handed it to her. “Off you go, beautiful. I’ll see you this afternoon. I love you.”
Michael laughed out loud and kissed Dean’s lips, making his partner lean around and strain to keep the connection.  Slowly, Michael began to move again, easier this time, gentle and hot, holding onto his hips and working his thumbs into the meat of Dean’s cheeks.
Michael was already snoring before Dean settled. Dean propped himself on an elbow and regarded his mate. He stroked the damp black hair off Michael’s forehead and followed it with a kiss to his shoulder, to his scar, to the red spot on the back of his neck where Dean’s teeth ground harmlessly down.
“I know.  But that’s just the point.  I can own up to it, and I can apologize, but I don’t know how to fix it.”
“I don’t suppose he’ll be trying to administer family therapy again any time soon,” Gabriel observed as Michael heaved noisily into the sink again.
Castiel glowed at the imagery, but the expression on his face didn’t touch the ember in his belly. “Yes, that’s right. I’m beginning to feel excited at the prospect. I can’t wait to see if they catch. We could be parents eight months from now.” He wasn’t faking his enthusiasm, and April couldn’t help the happy blush that covered her cheeks, a mirror of his joy, but that ember still burned hot and bright even though he wasn’t looking at it.
He went quiet and listened to the Claim vibrating in his head wondering what it must’ve felt like for April’s wolf to have had a glimpse only for a moment of another wolf even more Submissive than she, and get the shortest-lived hope that she might be able to win in a straight-out battle, only to be subsumed in the end because that Submissive wolf was attached to an alpha who wasn’t about to let it happen.  He worked his blue jeans all the way off and tossed them over the side of the bed.  He pulled her in tightly and used his stumpy toes to grab hold of the blanket at his feet and work it over them both.  She felt hot against his body, but she was also sweating, and he didn’t want her chilled.
His tears abated, and he began to press his ass backward against Cas’ erection.  Cas moved beneath him, to shift away enough that he didn’t breach Dean yet.  He brought his hands up to cup Dean’s face and bring him in for a deep and sensuous kiss.  He whispered to Dean so softly that Dean could barely hear him, “I love you too, Dean.  You deserve to be loved.  You deserve everything.  Please, don’t ever forget it.  I love you.”
“And another thing,” Dean picked up, clearly having continued the discussion in his head instead of out loud.  “Of course, I care.  Just because I haven’t put a cock-cage on you or locked you in the basement doesn’t mean it’s not affecting me.  But I don’t really get a say in this, man; I really, really don’t – not unless I’m going to walk away from Cas, and I’m not gonna do that.  You want to know what I feel about it?  Here, feel this.”  Dean swept it all up and shifted it through the bond to his mate, whose eyes grew wide.  All the anxiety, the ripe fear, all the jealousy and ugly possessiveness, the alpha urge to put his foot down, the hurt…so much hurt, and mixed with it all, coating it, was a thick layer of trust.
Dean had spent the morning and well into the afternoon quiet and subdued. Castiel had expected a bit more excitement from the little, as this was their first big outing together where Dean could just be himself. The angel had willed everyone around them to suddenly feel the strung urge to be somewhere else, leaving the two men virtually alone as the traipsed through the aquarium. Cas tried not to panic as Dean lagged against the angel and remained sedated through each exhibit. He didn’t know how to handle this side of Dean, more used to a cranky and bratty Dean. It took everything in him not to scan the boy for any illness or mental anguish. The angel sighed and cursed himself, for probably the millionth time, for promising not to use “any of his mojo” on Dean as the hunter had so eloquently put it.
“Samuel, you need to finish your dinner.” Gabriel’s voice had hardened as he sternly guided the plate back in front of his boy.
Sam was all too eager to begin his vacation and readily stepped into Gabriel’s embrace as he flew the two of them to the retreat and in the blink of an eye they were gone. This was, of course, after Dean had made both of them repeatedly swear up and down that they would call if anything seemed even remotely fishy. Dean, on the other time, he needed more time to shed his hunter skin and let his more tender and sensitive submissive side slink out into the world, to be the side of Dean that only Castiel got to see. He needed time to open himself and to be receptive to letting Castiel be in charge after spending so many weeks being the tough and in charge machine that he was with the rest of the world. Cas knew that Dean needed this time and he could let Dean have that. He let Dean drive the first half of the six-hour drive, directing him on where to turn but for the most part they just enjoyed the others company.
Dean pinched himself hard and whimpered to stop that train of thought. He was a hunter. He would go back to his normal life in two days and that’s all there was to it. People counted on him, depended on him, to keep fighting the good fight. He wasn’t doing anyone any good playing house with an angel.
“Shhh, it’s okay. All is forgiven my boy. We’re all done now, Dean. Nice deep breaths. We’re going to go upstairs now, have a nice bath, and then we’ll climb into bed. Doesn’t that sound nice?” Even as Cas spoke he was toting the exhausted boy up the stairs to the master bathroom.
The angel didn’t bother lecturing anymore, they both knew why the boy was here and talking in circles wouldn’t do either of them any good. With that thought he pulled Dean over his lap and wasted no time starting in on the boy’s underwear clad bottom. For several long minutes the only sounds that filled the kitchen were crisp slaps and Dean’s gasps and cries. Castiel wasn’t spanking particularly hard but he definitely wasn’t kidding around either. Dean knew better than to act out like that, but he didn’t have it in him to be overly stern.
“The restaurant where we are meeting Sam and Gabriel is a few hours away. Why don’t you lie down in the back and close your eyes? There are few things that sleep doesn’t help.”
One day left without monsters, one day left without the pressure of saving the world, one day of happiness left. Killing things was the family business, one he’d never quite been able to shake despite several chances to do so. But that was before Cas - before Daddy. Now the angels had shown him that the world wouldn’t stop if Dean took the time to be happy.
“I think you’ve just ticked off every stereotype on the checklist for a well-satisfied Alpha, C.J.”  Dean took the cigarette out of Cas’ hand, took one deep puff, and smashed it out beneath his boot heel.  Castiel wasn’t a smoker, never had been, but his wolf liked an occasional puff.  Cas only ever lit up during his Ruts, and only when he was pleased with the wolf’s performance.
Also, my final read-through, and no, I still don't pass my writing by a beta because I'm too possessive and impatient, I found way more typos than usual.  That means I most certainly missed some.  Sorry.  I know typos can kill the flow of thought-images.  I'll fix them eventually.
“Yeah, well, whatever. You and your say can go cry over a broken contract all you want. I have no problem with it.”
Gabriel moaned louder, rocking back and forth, and Castiel couldn’t take it anymore. At fourteen, he wasn’t nearly old enough to help. His virgin knot wouldn’t be capable of giving his older brother what he needed anyway. But the adults weren’t doing anything, and the stout walls and doors did nothing to keep the pained cries from echoing down the hall. Cas had hoped that just sitting with his brother and bringing him the scent of alpha, even an immature alpha, would help at least a little, but it wasn’t helping. Cas’ erection hurt, but if Gabe wasn’t getting any relief, Cas wouldn’t allow any for himself either. Sibling taboo be damned, the smell of Omega in Heat sent Cas’ head spinning and his cock into a new dimension of stiff. It left him fighting against urges he’d never experienced before, and it was a heady struggle.
Dean huffed.  “I just hadn’t tied those dates with these in my mind.  I didn’t forget I’m getting married.”  He rolled his eyes.  There was a deep discomfort in the way he said it that made Sam cock his head and pay attention.
“Thanks, I think,” Dean muttered. He sat forward on the couch, leaning his elbows on his spread knees, looking intently at the floor. “It’s kind of a habit. I had to learn to hide it from Sammy when we were kids. I got to where I barely think about it in the morning, even the ones that are really dark.” Dean fell silent.
“This way, Alpha,” said an assertive beta nurse.  Cas appreciated her efficiency.  He needed to get Dean out of the hallway before Michael came through.  She led them to a small surgery prep room with a lockable door.  Cas deposited Dean on the gurney in the middle of the room and then stooped down to look at his eyes.  Dean sat slumped over, too still and too compliant.  He didn’t look present at all.  Cas snapped his fingers in his face, and Dean’s alpha-red eyes locked on Cas’ blue ones.
“No, Dean, Claire doesn’t have a big knot.” Cas scratched at Dean’s scalp and pressed his face in closer. “Her new mate has a big knot—really big for an alpha-Neutral woman. Big for anyone, really. It almost didn’t fit.”
Maureen nodded. “We’re close, but every time we start to get enough evidence, they scatter. I’ve told Christian – we need an Omega infiltrator. It’s the only way to get close enough without them catching on.”
“Dean, Pet,” Castiel said in a quiet voice.  Dean looked up.  “You’re through eating.  Go downstairs please and wait for me.  Leave your clothing here.”
what I want, alpha. What I want is for you to plant a pup in my belly. I don’t really want to be bleeding when you do that if it’s all the same to you. I figure I can keep my Omega up front at first and give you that, so we don’t get our wires crossed. But it might be difficult for me to hold it for long if we’re not careful. My lead-up to Heat is a fucked up aggressive mess, man. I’m all over the place, and I’m testy as hell. My wolf is one cantankerous bastard when the hormones get out of control. It’s a recipe for a fight, I’m telling you. If my cycle were running ahead of yours, we’d be golden here, but it’s not. You’re going to Trip first, Dean. That puts me at my most aggressive against you at your most alpha. The Heat’s gonna help, but I sometimes wolf out even when I’m in Heat. It’s just something that’s going to take careful management, that’s all.” Michael stayed well away from Dean physically, and he didn’t look at him any more than he had to. Dean had his shirt off. Sweat and sawdust coated his hairless chest.
Cas grinned.  His husband was beautiful and trusting and sweet.  He’d turned out to be an exceptional father, to no one’s surprise.  And Cas found that moments like this one, sharing small moments of peace while they watched their children grow were the ones that meant the most.
Billie nodded.  “By the way, on the subject of the wedding.  Bobby’s found you a photographer.  He’s flying a woman in from Belize.  He asked me to ask you to approve the expense.”
Dean corrected his posture with a “Sir.”  Behind him employees noted the state of his backside, and they made a bit of a stir before Castiel set them all back to moving as they were.
“Shh!” she admonished. “What is it with you? Why do people always do what you want them to do? They wouldn’t have done it for me.”
Ketch didn’t falter. “Maybe not, but you sat there and told us you’d follow every one of those rules. Now, you’re either going to hold up your side of that, or you and I give the Alpha here cause to think we’re not committed. I don’t know about you, boy, but I’m not moving back to that one-bedroom flat in the middle of the Ozarks. You asked me when we met what my line of work is. Allow me to demonstrate.”
She blushed again and looked at Michael.  “Will you be my escort, Michael?” she asked shyly.  “I won’t win.  But I’d like to have you there all the same.  You’ve supported every step I’ve taken.  And you do look amazing in a tuxedo.”
Jo cinched an arm possessively around April’s waist, and she regarded Jess coolly. Jo remembered Jess from years before, and she remembered watching Dean tend to his heartbroken brother in the aftermath. “So it appears. Hi, Jess. You good?”
“I know,” she admitted. “So does Michael.” She didn’t confess anything though. “Dean, why doesn’t Michael like me? We’re going to be spending so much time together. I don’t like being disliked. I know it’s not possible to be everyone’s best friend, but I’d hoped that in my own Pack at least…”
“No, you misunderstand.  I’m not mocking you.  I may not understand what my son’s vision for his family is or how it fits together, but I’m not blind.  I see that he loves you dearly, and I admire the nerve it took for you to come and lay all of that at my feet.  He tells me that your mate’s pup will be parented by the four of you?  Although, how anyone as young as April could think of parenting anyone is beyond me.  She still needs parenting herself.”  Naomi shot another look out to the dance floor.  “Oh, Lord!” she exclaimed, averting her eyes, and Dean huffed a short laugh.
“Ooooh, Charlie, not supposed to say that word,” Jimmy observed. Dean glanced across. All six pups were staring in awe. He sighed and stood up.
Dean nearly hyperventilated in panic at the insane stretch and burn, but his rim locked tight around Cas’ whole hand.
“That’s my plan, yes.  If you authorize it, that is.” Cas had a distant, slightly alarming look in his eye.
“They’re keeping it a tightly contained secret,” Sam answered, nodding his head toward a colleague he hadn’t seen in some time.
“I’ll call to check availability and schedule us a tour,” said Michael.  “If they don’t have September 9th available, do we keep looking for another venue or change the date?”
“Ma’am, it’s just that my mate planned to mentor me? We thought I’d be assigned a paper-pushing job, some kind of coordination?” Michael pointed over his shoulder at his mate.
“Trust me, it bites!  So then, Castiel comes down to get me from Dallas, and he’s got the whole sales pitch worked out: the ring, the fucking roses at the table, for God’s sake, and I can resist all that shit, but he looked straight into my face and told me I could be a person with him, not a Sub, not an alpha, none of that fucking pigeon-holing bullshit, and that we’d be making our decisions together, as a team, in a partnership.  Did that look like a partnership to you?”  Dean gestured back up to the house behind him.
“S’not funny, dude,” Dean protested.  “I’m still bruised from last night.  That was way outta line.”  Dean tended toward bitchy when he was drunk and morose.
“Do you take nothing seriously?!” he charged, inexplicably angry, stirred by something he couldn’t name or touch or see. “Are you just going to drift through your life on a cloud of endorphins and take whatever they plan for you? Do you have any fucking idea how talented you are?!  Are you ever going to grow up?!”
“It’s good to be the king,” he whispered into her ear, and then he turned her chin and kissed her.  Castiel ate up the amused adoration she fed him.  It wasn’t what he’d been feeding from for the last six months; this was far more grounded and unstaged.  It was something rich and real, and he shifted into the kiss to let her feel how grateful he was, how blessed.  The condom caught in the wiry curls of his pubic hair and tugged painfully, and he winced, grunting out a sound of disfavor, of privileged distaste.  Condoms were of the devil, he was sure of it.
“We need to get home, Alpha,” Sam put in, pushing his chair back.  “Hank’s eye appointment is early, and we need to get the twins to bed.”
Maybe that’s why you keep an arm’s distance between you and the masses, for your own safety, ‘cause you don’t stop and consider anything, you just throw right in with whoever.  I know that’s not what it feels like to you, but take it from someone who
Dean wasn’t sleepy, and he could remember every moment.  Every single one.  Weren’t wolves supposed to have memory blackouts of the humiliating behaviors they displayed while under the inebriating effects of a Mate-scent?  Still tied chest-to-chest with his Omega, Dean wormed uncomfortably until he pulled first one, then the other of his knees out to either side and under Michael’s legs which were locked around Dean’s waist, hooked at the ankle.  Dean sat upright on his sore ass with his legs bent sharply back at the knee, breaking Michael’s foot-lock, and he scowled at his mate.  “You could at least TRY to help me maneuver.  This is SO not comfortable.”
“You’re going to go in there in a couple of days and knock her up again,” Michael added as a non sequitur.
Virtually no angst in this chapter except for in the mind of the unrealistic but adorable Alpha who wants to co-Chair a pack.  Who does that?
I felt so bad that what was intended to be just an intro to the chapter turned into 10000+ words of no plot at all, so I wrote the next chapter too.  You're getting a twofer today.  If you like the raunchy stuff, stay here and read 44.  If you want plot, skip it and jump straight to 45.  Maybe read them in backwards order.  I don't know why you would do that, but it's a free country, right?
“Home,” she repeated dully. “I can’t go back home, alpha. I’m not tying myself to that asshole; I don’t care how bad it hurts. I trusted her, and look what that got me.” By the end of her statement, she’d gagged and doubled over, drawing her top leg across Dean’s hip and curling into the cramp in her core.
“In New York!” Michael clarified. “You monopolized his time on that trip based on Pete’s directive, and you haven’t reverted back to your agreement with me yet. You’re still monopolizing his time. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember authorizing April to speak for me on matters of my mate.”
here? You got a lackey back there with some free time between mopping the john and wiping jizz off the walls?”
“I know,” Michael admitted. “I’m just mad at the Universe, I guess. I want her to have what we have. I want that for everyone. …except Cain.”
“If I hear you right, and from what I already know about you all, you’ve got the perfect Omega mate for your Alpha.  She’s compliant and soothing for the Alpha who feels like it has to fight for consensus everywhere else.  The Alpha can spend the day battling it out in a world that just won’t give it what it wants, and then come home to a perfect, willing mate to soothe off the edges and make everything better.
Dean grinned, glowing in his happiness. “I thought I smelled something new last night, but I wanted to wait until I was sure to say anything. It’s much stronger this morning. I’m sure of it now.” Dean’s face froze in an expression of shock at hearing his own statement. Saying it out loud changed everything. Now that he’d said it, it sank in. Dean was going to be a father. Michael’s surprise mirrored Dean’s, but there was nothing odd about that. They’d both laid so many claims, one atop another in the last couple of days, that the two of them were trapped mirroring one another incessantly for now.
“Yes, please,” she answered trying to puzzle out why April and Cas both looked pleased, and Michael looked ready to run for it.
He nodded distractedly and took another deep breath and another sip of water.  Sarah hadn’t touched hers.  “In a Primate family,” he went on at last.  “It might be expected that a situation like this could cause friction between the two women, but that the mother would ultimately win out and assert her rights to parent the child.  Some families recover, and some harbor resentments forever.  Some mothers may not have any ill feelings at all.”
The room went nuts. Papers literally flew into the air in the rush of bodies to reach him and shake his hand or hug him. The feeling of relief was palpable, like when the news of a ceasefire finally makes it to the front lines, and everyone can stand down within the euphoria of having survived. Sam, however, waited for the crowd to thin. He worked his way to Castiel, his face carved from stone, immune to the celebratory atmosphere. Castiel braced himself. He wasn’t going to back down no matter what Sam had to say, so he faced the beta-Dom directly, making no move to posture. Castiel respected Sam a great deal and prayed they could soon be brothers. He owed it to Sam to face him now as a man, not an Alpha.
The day was half gone by the time they headed back east toward home. Setting the service for Wednesday afternoon meant that Castiel wouldn’t have to miss it due to his interview with the FBI and Dean and Michael could expect to be clear enough from cycling hormones to attend without causing a ruckus.
“Jesus! That’s the hottest thing I’ve ever seen!” said a voice from behind them as Michael took ownership of Dean’s mouth. It was Margot. She wasn’t Dean’s favorite, but it didn’t matter. She had a job to do, and she was here to do it.
Michael leaned in and ran his hands over Dean’s back, butt, thighs, between them and back up to tighten a hold on his balls, making Dean suck in a breath and drop his head against the corner tiles.  Dean widened his stance and bit his lip in anticipation.  Michael sucked another bruise into the back of Dean’s neck where bruises are hard to pull.  He used his teeth to grind out a good reaction beneath the surface.  If the Dom wanted to lodge a mark there, by God there’d better be a mark there.  He examined his work and kissed over it with gentle lips, continuing to knead Dean’s heavy sack with one hand.  He worshiped his mate’s body with his mouth and his breath long enough to have Dean whining into his corner, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
Castiel and three of his housemates were in the air on their way to New York.  Benny was knotted to his beta mate, sweaty and spent and happy.  Bobby was house sitting at the big manor with Sam and Gabriel, playing another round of poker and getting his ass handed to him by the Omega and the beta both.
They weren’t finished talking about it yet. Dean wasn’t planning to budge where Michael’s safety was concerned, but Michael had some valid points. Part of Dean wanted to castigate Cas for being party to this foolishness, but Dean hadn’t really made his instruction clear. Michael was right that Dean had put completely opposite statements on the table. He’d promised Michael he could make these choices for himself. Dean meant to keep that promise, but he also meant to stick fast on the point that he needed to know when, where, and with whom Michael planned to go public. No more ambushes, even ones that made him feel like
They jumped and scooted gracelessly from the room.  They lined up shoulder to shoulder at the bannister overlooking the grand foyer.  Their father stood imperiously at the foot of the stairs red-faced, staring straight ahead.  One look down at him had Gabe nudging Cas’ ribs, and they practically tumbled down the stairs to re-set directly in front of him.
“Well then, I’ll just have to keep putting it back every time it heals, won’t I?” Michael snarked from the back seat, fitting his headphones over his ears and squirming in his seat. Dean rolled his eyes and stepped on it. It was going to be a long drive home.
“She makes me feel good, Castiel. She makes me feel safe. I dunno where it’s going from here. We didn’t do a lot of talking yet.” Gabe was surprisingly sincere.
Dean struggled to his feet and limped up to Cas who looked like he knew what was coming.  Dean whispered right into his face, “If you collapse from exhaustion because you push yourself when you need to be recovering, April’s going to go down with you.  She won’t rest if you’re stirred up, Alpha.  You two are too closely linked right now.”
He grinned. “She’s gorgeous, just like you are,” he told her with pride. “And she’s huge! I’ll be honest, Pete, it never occurred to me that yours would be that … expansive.”
“So, you see, Sammy,” he said happily.  “We’ve got everything under control over here.  You guys keep doing what you do, and knock one outta the park for me.  We’ll keep the pups alive and fed for you while you’re gone.  I’ll be back on the road just as soon as I can, right boss?”  Dean tee’d the question up for Cas, and Cas answered resolutely in the affirmative.
“On my way,” Benny told her, hanging up.  “Jack and Andrea are here.  I gotta go get them.  Dean, will you please find Jo?  Tell her it’s time.”
Castiel turned his eyes on Sarah, mutely commanding a statement from her as well.  She hiccupped and then stammered a bit before finding her voice.  “Sir, it…it … was … wasn’t something we really even considered.  Not in the way we should have.  It seemed a natural progression.  Everyone was frustrated at the disconnect.  We were so close to conveying the exact
“You carry every burden for everyone and act like you deserve it.  You don’t, okay.  You don’t deserve to take all of their pain and heartache onto yourself just because you couldn’t protect them from hurting.”
“I trust you, Jack. God, it feels so good. I trust you. Could you? … Just a little … Ahhh!” She panted in his ear, curling toward him until she could claim his mouth and bring him back up with her. They kissed sloppily. Tongues met around huffing breaths as his hand moved between them and she dug her fingers into the flesh of his arm and his back, tugging him closer.
Cas knew a fight was coming, he had seen it brewing since the car ride over. They usually started their time like this, with Dean fighting to give up control after so much freedom. Dean would be surly and ornery; he would act out and immediately regret it. Cas would spank him, Dean would apologize, all would be forgiven, and they would go on about their time. The only difference being that all this behavior would have to be constricted to twenty-four to forty-eight hours as was their usual get away time. And that wasn’t to say Dean would earn multiple spankings in that time period, sometimes he really needed to be broken down before he could be built back up again.
So, I'm 'that' writer I guess. The one that updates like months in between. It's fine if you hate me, I hate me too. But here's some bratty little Dean to hopefully make up for it.
“Yeah, Daddy.” The boy sighed. He leaned into the angel's touch and continued to sag against him as they walked.
The bedroom was spacious enough that the center held plenty of room for both men to sprawl out and play with toys or do puzzles together. There were toy chests lined by bookshelves filled with puzzles and boardgames on one wall, in the adjoining corner was an oversized rocking chair flanked by more bookshelves that held the colorful spines of books that Dean actually wanted to read. It was the perfect cozy corner to curl up in before bed or on rainy days that trapped them inside. Against the opposite wall was a queen-sized bed, the comforter was a deep dark blue with stars dotted across it and on one of the bedside tables was a small plastic mouse. The mouse was slowly and soothingly changing colors as Dean stared at it. The walls started out a soft pale blue at the top and faded to a navy blue at the very bottom that matched his bed spread.
It wasn’t every guardian angel that fell in love with their ward, but Dean was special, and their bond was even more so. As much as Dean hated their ‘chick flick moments’ he felt it too and had a hard time going without seeing Castiel for more than a few weeks. They both still had their own jobs to do, Cas had missions from heaven and Dean was always busy stopping yet another apocalypse or fighting some monster of the week but they both did their best to make it work, stealing moments here and there between near deaths and injuries. It was hard on both of them but what Cas had in mind would hopefully help them both. He had told heaven that he was done for a little while, that his ward was his priority now and that they would have to make do without him.
He watched in horror as Gabe leaned over and whispered something into his younger brother’s ear that made his face turn red. Their server walked up to their table at the moment, apparently not sensing the mood, to ask if anyone needed dessert or the check, just in time for the salad that Sam had swept from the table to coat her midriff. Sammy didn’t stick around to apologize, he ran for the door with Dean right on his heels ready to give him a piece of his mind.
“Cut the crap, Sam! We were in there having a nice, NORMAL, dinner! No hunter talk, no monsters, just family and dinner. And you ruined it!” Dean was hot and shaking as he yelled at his brother.
“Is everything okay, baby?” Cas asked as he rubbed a hand smoothly up and down Dean’s back. This wasn’t the first time that he had asked that same question that day, but not knowing what else to say when normal conversation was hardly getting a response.
Dean and Cas sat in silence for a while, should to shoulder on yet another crappy motel bed that sported stains that neither of them wanted to think about. Cas had felt Dean’s anguish mounting and had hoped that Dean would call for him before it got to that point. He always gave Dean the chance to come to him and ask for help but he never made Dean wait very long, he couldn’t make him wait that long. The angel knew that this was a battle he would be long fighting thanks to the suck it up attitude John Winchester and his A-plus parenting had twenty-six years to instill in the boy. Castiel was sent here to relieve some of that pressure now though, as his guardian angel, and to hopefully reverse the years of unhealthy coping mechanisms, and to provide what joy he could in the boys’ life.
Castiel stopped short outside of the door that Dean assumed led into the house, spun around to face Dean and grabbed him by both shoulders.
“Great. Let’s go see this week long surprise, then.” Dean groused a bit and looked doubtfully at the vast nothingness that seemed to surround them.
The boy rested an elbow on the table and sighed heavily as he dropped his head onto his palm, continuing to roll his peas from one side of the plate to the other. He wasn’t sure why he is making a fuss about eating. Sure, vegetables were the worst, but he was usually a pretty good eater, and Daddy hadn’t even given him that many peas tonight. Dean was also known for his never ending appetite, so he should have at least eaten the yummy looking chicken tenders in front of him. But he just didn’t want to eat tonight.
The tub was one of Castiel’s favorite parts of the house, he had it specially made so that both men could recline comfortable even if facing each other. It was also deep enough that the water swelled around their chests if they sat up straight. Dean relaxed into the angel and let himself be maneuvered so that he was reclining with his back against Castiel and let the warm water and bubbles ease tension from his muscles. They soaked in silence for a while, the only sound was that of the water as it splashed against the sides of the tub in response to the movement of Castiel’s arms as they massaged knots the hunter didn’t even know he had.
“It is about a six-hour drive from here, Dean. We can drive your care there and you can rest during the drive. I know you haven’t been sleeping as often as you probably could have.” Castiel gave him a stern look as he finished reassuring Dean that Baby would in fact be okay, letting the man know that sleep was important, and he had agreed to try to sleep more.
“Anything that’s bothering you, Dean, we can work it out together. All you have to do is talk to me.” The angel tried again. Blue eyes filled with concern.
“A few hours, it’s almost seven now. Just in time, you’ll be able to see everything before darkness falls.” Castiel was almost bouncing in his seat with exccitment.
The hunter took in his surroundings as he blinked sleep from his eyes. The two men were parked in front of a Chili’s and dark had fallen, other than that Dean was pretty lost. But he was soothed by the fact that his angel was with him and by the years of falling asleep in one state and waking up on another in the very same Impala he was in now.
Sure enough, Dean could see it now as the drove up. A two story farmhouse sat in front of them, looking perfectly aged with white shutters surrounding each of the windows and a covered porch that wrapped around the entirety of the house. There was a beautiful oak tree out front, large and sprawling with a swing large enough for two people hanging from it. He sat up even straighter in an attempt to peek into at least one of the windows that might give him a glimpse of what was hidden behind the large red front door. They pulled around the side of the house into a two car garage that was much too large to be an original part of the house. Dean took in all of the lifts, tool boxes, and lights that littered the garage as the pulled in to the spot specially marked ‘baby’ in sharp letters on the concrete below them as well as on the sign that hung on the wall in front of them. Cas had built this garage just for her, for him. Castiel had to pull Dean out of the car because he was too amazed to move.
Dean stayed in the center of the seat, close enough that their shoulders brushed as they swayed with the car, but he sat up straight now as his eyes darted from place to place as they drove. Cas could tell the boy was anxious and placed a hand on his knee to quell the unconscious jiggling and the way that Dean was fiddling with the radio. Dean looked sheepishly at Cas and folded his hands in his lap.
“I’m sorry, Daddy. I understand.” Dean repeated, his lower lip trembling but his tears had slowed as he wrapped his arms around himself.
“No way, Cas. My car, my rules.” Dean snapped, fighting the urge to give in but not really knowing why.
Dean sobbed as he dragged himself over to the indicated drawer and rummaged through it. He hated the spoon he thought miserably. He found it rather quickly, but he couldn’t quite force himself to return to his waiting angel right away. The boy jumped though when he heard his angel clear his throat and hurried back to him, not wanting to earn anything more than he already had coming.
Cas held out the two choices for Dean to see, “Which would you like to wear, baby?” He asked and was unsurprised when Dean indicated the dinosaur jammies.
“Dean, it’s time.” Cas said, startling Dean out of his thoughts. “Please pull over at the next gas station. I’m going to drive the rest of the way.”
Castiel did his best to stifle the sigh he felt escape from his lips yet again as he climbed into the front seat to begin the drive east.
“Dean, you need to eat, not push your food around on your plate.” Cas scolded softly after watching Dean play with his food for several minutes.
The hunter granted Castiel a soft smile as he leaned into the angel’s warmth and sighed. It had been a long time since Dean had stopped jumping out of his skin every time the angel appeared out of thin air. It had also been some time since Dean had found anything but comfort and solace in Castiel’s rough voice, and this time was no different. He let out a second shuddery sigh as the angel rested a hand on Dean’s shoulder and rubbed his face furiously with his hands in an effort to fight back the tears that came rushing to the surface. All of Dean’s walls seemed to come crashing down the moment Cas arrived, and heaven forbid the angel touch him, then he was practically defenseless. Everything was just too much, everything was just weighing down on him, and the pressure never stopped.
Once upstairs, Dean refused to be put down. Castiel managed to get the tub running as he held his lover but there was no way he was going to undress either of them like this. Any time he tried to set Dean down the boy would scream and start to cry again and Cas just couldn’t listen to him cry any more tonight. They both knew that the angel could just will all of their clothing off but he knew it unsettled Dean when he used his grace. He also kind of enjoyed doing things the mundane human way most of time. A fondness he had developed after years of following the Winchesters across the country and during his stint with humanity after he had lost his grace.
Castiel tugged Dean’s underwear until they flagged around his knees and pulled the boy back over his lap. He knew Dean didn’t need much more before he was done and opted to bring the spoon down only a few dozen times. Each snap of his wrist caused the hunter to shriek and writhe beneath him, hands firmly wrapped around the angels’ ankles. As soon as Cas was done he threw the spoon to the floor and pulled Dean into his arms. Dean wrapped himself around the angel and buried his head in Castiel’s neck, apologizing profusely and letting himself cry a little bit more.
“Oops, I guess I do have one more surprise for you my boy.” Cas said, hurrying to sit back up and reach into his bedside table. When his hand resurfaced he was holding a stuffed bear with soft velvety black fur and piercing blue eyes. The angel was a little nervous his boy wouldn’t like it and wondered if he should have chosen a different bear, but this one just called to him.
“If you would just tell me where we are going, then we wouldn’t have that problem.” Dean muttered to himself, his hands gripping the steering wheel a little more tightly than necessary.
Dean laughed and joked with the others, a watchful eye on his brother and the archangel. He insides churned every time Sam pushed him off or rolled his eyes at Gabe’s hushed request for him to eat. Why was Sam being such a brat? Why was Gabe letting him get away with it? It wasn’t until Gabe, Cas and Dean had all finished eating when the evening came to a head.
Dean is finally settling in and is back to his typical bratty antics. Typically Cas shuts these down pretty quickly, but is feeling guilty about yesterday so he doesn't. Chaos ensues.
“I love you more, Daddy.” Dean was already closing his eyes and curling up on his side around his stuffed angel bear.
You would have thought that Dean would hate Scooby Doo. After living a life hunting monsters and other things that go bump in the night it would understandable if Dean avoided all things monster related in his free time, but Dean absolutely loved this cartoon. Perhaps it was because the monster was always just a person in a mask or some fancy computer work at the end of the day. There was always that happy ending at the end and the gang stayed together no matter what. Cas wasn’t sure of the exact reason, but he didn’t think it hurt the boy to watch it so he continued to allow it.
The angel turned around and sighed to himself as he surveyed the food and glass covered floor in front of him. He set the timer on his phone for the promised five minutes and then hurried to tidy and stow away the rest of their dinner. There was no way he was planning on coming back downstairs tonight and so it needed to be done now. The drive had been a long one and the weeks leading up to it even longer and he wanted nothing more to be in bed with his boy already. It took everything in Castiel to make him wait the full five minutes as he listened to Dean cry to himself in the corner, but Dean often needed this time to sort himself out and calm down.
Dean crumpled it up and threw it into the trash.  “I’m not leaving you anywhere this week, my love.  For now, you go where I go.”
“Yours, Sam!  Always.”  Her body told his that it was the truth, and her eyes showed him a bitch wolf in complete agreement.  Years of longing showed in those blue eyes, fear and hurt replaced by hope and lust.  The bitch rolled in submission, so the Dom took a deep breath, set his jaw, and went for it. Her plastic shopping basket lay near her head on its side.  The eggs had spilled and broken and turned her blond hair dark where the curls became sticky in egg white.  Sam ignored the mess.  He was still sentient.  He was still Sam.  There was a dreamlike insubstantial feel to the air around him, but his mind was clearer than he could remember ever experiencing before in his life.  It didn’t feel much like how he’d heard Mating-Triggers described, but he didn’t doubt himself for a moment.
“When that girl asked you if you’d rather top or bottom,” Sam replied, fixing his too-astute eye on his brother’s face. “You said you switch it up depending on who you’re with, even in your free time.” He paused a beat, then continued when Dean didn’t respond. “Dean, when was the last time you were with someone new in your free time? Never, right? Not since college? Dude, I know you. You’re so monogamous, you put fifty-year-old Baptists to shame. And yeah right, as if Castiel would
Dean grimaced. “It’s not that. God, it’s so stupid. I shouldn’t have said anything. I ruined everything. I don’t know if the rules change when we’re in cycle. Michael, you said that it’s okay for me to touch, but what about him? What if he touches me? Is that okay? You two had an agreement. Did we fuck that up?” Dean hunched his back and rested his forehead between Michael’s shoulders.
Cas growled loud enough that Dean’s mouth snapped shut.  “That’s NOT going to happen,” he insisted again.  “I vetted this guy.  He’s not her type at all.  She’s certainly not his.  There’s no chemistry between them, no spark, not even the frictional kind like she had from the start with Michael.  Dean, at some point, we have to let go and trust our mates.  I may not fully trust Cain yet, but I trust April.”
“I appreciate the offer, Michael, and I’ll accept to some degree.  Take all the actions you need to keep Dean balanced, but this incident needs my involvement.  He sabotaged my mate, and he did it intentionally.  I take that as a personal affront.  I
“Here’s the thing, Michael. We’ve discussed this before, haven’t we? What we have here is a pattern. A pattern of poor decisions. Every time we call you on it you swear it’s the last time. You swear you’ve learned your lesson…” Jody split the two ropes at his belly button and ran each strand between his legs on opposite sides of his junk before tying them off on the loop at the back of his neck, leaving two long strands hanging freely down the center of his back.
“You’ll be able to with some experience. It’s not impossible, just uncomfortable. For now though, let’s try to return him to an unaroused state. So what do you do now?” Her voice rolled back down in tension, reminding him that getting stirred up wasn’t helping.
“It’s relative,” Cas told him.  “For perspective, think mountain and molehill.  I wasn’t locking her out of my entire personality.  I was guarding my Omega mate from the worst my awful designations have to offer.  I would hope you’re doing the same.  Michael’s not Ozzie, but no Omega needs the burden of all your insecurities.”
Dean set a heavy hand on Michael’s head, then let it shift to the back of his neck.  “I’ll heal.  It was worth it.”
“Dad, where are you? Are you okay? Hey, tell me where you are, and we’ll come get you.” Dean stepped quickly into a quiet side hall, his finger plugging his opposite ear so he wouldn’t miss a word.
“I need some time, Dean.  I’m not leaving.  I’m not leaving you.  Of course I love you.  Can I please have a few minutes to myself before I slip and say something I don’t intend?  May I have that, please?  You know how difficult this is for me, and I’m not fighting one designation.  I’ve got both of them clamoring at my breastbone at the moment.  All I’m asking for is a little time to handle myself before I talk to you.”
Damn, he had an awesome Pack!  He gunned his baby a little, and headed for home.  If this was to be their last hoorah before they married, Dean wanted to make it worth the effort.
Dean laughed.  “Right.  And it’s fair that you got stuck doing it every other minute of every other day.  We’re a Pack, man.  We look out for each other.  Truth is, I wanted to sic you on the bastards, not hold your leash while you muzzled the wolf.  You know how I feel about this stuff.  That’s not likely to change.  But I know how
“Yes,” she said without pausing her fingers.  “Instrumental.  I’m just letting it flow.  Sometimes I find melodies like this…just opening myself up to whatever happens and listening to what my fingers do.”
I promise to do a review of tags soon. I haven't updated them in ages, and there are some missing. Point out any that you notice, if you don't mind. My mind really doesn't work along those lines.
Sam started first.  “Hi, Janine.  Thanks for your question.  It was brave of you to ask, and it’s the kind of question that could wind up helping a lot of people, so I’m really grateful to you.”  Dean nodded his agreement.  “I want you to remember that you shouldn’t
Cas stared out the window, ignoring the reflection in the darkened pane.  His reflection.  He couldn’t make anything mean anything.  He’d been so committed on his way in, stubborn as a bull, no doubt whatsoever about right and wrong and who deserved to die bloody.  Now, the whole world was spinning in freefall.  He wasn’t sure of anything except that he didn’t ever want to feel this way again.
“Have you mended any of the very public rifts between you and the Congresswoman since her unfortunate illness?”
“That’s rough,” agreed the old doctor much more mildly than he normally spoke. Evidently, he nursed a soft spot for Castiel’s mate. “I’m sorry.”
Castiel thought about hitting him.  A solid punch to his jaw or repeated pummeling into his chest, anything to break him out of his stupor.  But Zachariah turned away as he was still frantically searching for a way to make him stay, and he shuffled out, closing the door behind him.
“Yeah, I get it.”  Sam got it.  He knew the risks.  He just didn’t have a choice.  Dean was gonna feel the rough side of Sam’s paddle when the dust cleared though.  Sam was absolutely sure of that.
Dean heard the disdain in Castiel’s voice when he spoke to his mother after she said anything particularly ignorant or blatantly false, and in Dean’s mind, that tone seemed to overlay the words he spoke to Dean as well.  They were the same, Dean and Naomi – Naomi by choice and behavior, but Dean simply through birth and existence.  He simply wasn’t enough; would never, could never be good enough.
Dean sat cross-legged on Pam’s leather couch.  She side-eyed his boots but said nothing.  He had his head bowed against his open palms, working his fingers through his hair in frustration.
Gabriel worked his way methodically back up three floors in the dark.  This side was unguarded.  Apparently, the security team didn’t think anyone would be hunting for a way INTO the dungeon, and hadn’t thought to secure it; either that or there were hidden cameras that Gabriel’s scoping had missed, in which case he was a dead man.  He made it to the garbage chute and moved as fast as he could.  He eased the limp form in past the lip and let her go, letting gravity slide her body to his partners waiting at the bottom.  He listened for the gentle thump and was just about to step onto the seat himself, when a heavy hand came down upon his shoulder and arrested his motion.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, Alpha. Don’t you dare! The same as my dad? No. No way. My dad lost touch with the
“Usually birthday presents come without strings attached.  Now you’re telling me I have to say yes to your proposal or I don’t get to keep it.”
“I don’t plan to use anything, uh, unique, Sir.  Can we do traffic light colors?  I’m comfortable with that if you are.”  Dean took another sip and noted the approval in Castiel’s eyes at his response, or maybe at the pace he was drinking.  Whatever it was, it felt good that he was already pleasing his new Dom, and he felt a little bit of tension ease.
and listen when you tell me I’ve been brainwashed.  I get to expect others in the house to respect me too, Pop.  That’s the difference.”  Michael looked over at Rachel and his mother, frozen on the couch.  He prayed they both stayed out of it, and he nodded when Rachel cautiously took their mother’s hand.
Dean chuckled and checked his wing mirror.  Habit.  There was nothing back there to worry about.  “I could do that, Sam,” he pointed out, “but I wouldn’t want to scar you.”
“Does your brother still paddle your backside when you misbehave?” John asked with a rare glint in his eye. Dean sputtered to a stop.
“I’m no good like this, Dean,” Cas admitted.  “I feel it like a splinter in my side.  It’s incredibly distracting.  I need to get home.  If I’m not there when she needs me, what good am I to her?  Fuck the interviews!  I’m going home!”  Cas stopped and faced Dean resolutely.
“It has to stop, Dean.  You’re a part of the equation.  You know better.  You have no right to put the full weight of responsibility on Michael.  He’s Omega!  He cannot bear that weight for you both.  That’s not fair to either of you, and someone’s going to get hurt.  I won’t have it!”
Warning for sexual contact that is of dubious consent.  There's no actual dub-con here, but the lines of communication weren't followed prior to.  Assumptions were made, control was taken, questions weren't asked.  We can apply this warning to several of the scenes in this posting, explicit and implicit.  So be aware.  It's getting rape-y again.
“Oh, fuck it all, Cas! Don’t you see? I can’t tell her no. She’s played it so that I’m stuck! It’s the first time she’s been that straightforward, and if I turn her down, it’ll just prove to her that direct communication is a dead-end street, and she’ll go right back to scheming below the surface! Damnit!”
was eating the Alpha, but they hadn’t touched on it yet.  Dean could tell.  “How’s the FBI investigation into the explosion coming?” he asked.
The cop was already parked behind them.  He’d disengaged the siren, but his lights were still on, a warning to passersby to give them a wide berth.  He too got out of his car.
“Let’s watch!  We haven’t had a Mating here in months.  This is exciting.  I’ve NEVER seen an AS/OD Mating before.  That was brilliant to prep him with punishment.  Look!”
“There is nothing you could ever do for which I would not forgive you, sweet Omega. I understand what drove you, and I understand how Dean turned your impulse to his own uses. You’re not responsible for Dean’s behavior, Michael, only your own.”
Kali gave her a simple smirk.  “I really doubt you could pronounce my full name, Mrs. Novak.  In the U.S. I go by a diminutive.  You can call me Kali.”
Quiet nights in Gabriel’s room, when Cas crept in and slipped beneath the covers to sleep in a space that felt a bit less cavernous and a bit less alone, were made for soft confessions.  Gabe listened to his little brother in a way no one else did, and he didn’t chastise him for tucking right up into the curve of Gabe’s body.
“Only while Dean’s likewise indisposed,” Cas told him.  “Same as always.  We’re not out of town though.  I expect to be notified if anything untoward happens.  I’m not a teenager.  My Ruts don’t incapacitate me to a degree that makes me incoherent.  Call me if you need me.”
Dean stared at him for a moment and then set his pen down. “No,” Dean told him, unconsciously lifting his chest. “This is none of your business. It’s between Cas and me, and you can butt out. I don’t need you regimenting my schedule.”
It didn’t take long, but there was a brief pause and a skittering through Dean’s thoughts that was jarring enough for Michael to pick it up through their bonds. Soon the skittering stopped, and Michael felt warm moisture surround his cock. Dean rested his chin on the chair’s seat and moved in to be comfortable. He planned to hold this position for some time if his posture was anything to go by. Michael sighed, then opened his eyes and began to feed himself.
“Dean, I scare him. I don’t mean to do that. I would never hurt him. I don’t know how to teach him he can trust me.” She was gazing toward the front room, although she couldn’t see past the beaded curtain in the doorway.
“It is barbarism, and it is ultimately little better than the Progressives who allow their Omegas to wallow in dangerous fever, chanting that chastity is a purification. There are better ways. We cannot allow either of these roads for our children, Dean. It might be a challenge, if we have more than a couple Omegas, to search out a good mentor for each. They will all need different things, I’m sure. Of course, it’s also within the realm of a healthy parental scope to allow for a limited degree of carnal contact between parent and offspring in order to teach, guide, and protect young Omegas. It’s a fine line between parental guidance and inappropriate sexual grooming, but sometimes the paternal parent is the best first choice.”
Cas tried to blow him off. “He’s alpha, Gabe. He’s Mated now, and that means he’ll want to face his Rut as an alpha. We only played it that way because we’re…us, I guess. It was never more than a stopgap until he found a mate to knot.”
“Not at all, Gregory.  It was a pleasure.”  Cas waited the requisite polite pause while the correspondent signed himself off by name, then hung up with a deliberate slam.
in a tuxedo. Jesus, man, Michael could run for office if he wanted to, and he’d win in a landslide. This is working.”
“I was going to wait until after Michael caught,” Dean began slowly.  “I was going to pick a fight with him while we’re out driving in the middle of nowhere and tell him I was breaking it off with you, that we were moving out of the manor, maybe set him some terrible rules, really restrictive ones, you know, whatever it took to piss him off.  He was going to refuse to move.  I know he would do that now.  He loves you, and he loves that house.  I was planning to get so enraged that I pulled over and kicked him out of the car into the night on the side of the road and leave him there.”
Cas rounded the table to stand before his brother.  He put a hand on Gabe’s arm and shushed him calmly.  “Don’t worry, Gabe.  It’s our house.  She’s just a visitor.  She has no power over any of us, and she’ll behave herself or she’ll find herself on her ass on the sidewalk outside the gate.”
“Come on, man. There’s no reason Gabe would be their priority. To them, he’s a small fry. They don’t know he’s connected to Oklahoma. Do they? Does anyone? All they know is a guy named Maurice was there two weeks earlier, and he rescued one girl. They may not even know that much. Don’t you think their main goal right now is to stay out of jail?” Dean bore into Castiel’s face with unblinking eyes.
“Medium raspberry tea. Nothing else.”  Dean dug his wallet out and then he prompted April to continue.
Michael didn’t answer. He didn’t move either. He blinked every now and then, so Dean stroked him gently with both bonds and tried to comfort him, calm him.
“We have a couple of routes we can take that you’re not going to like. I know you don’t want us prostituting ourselves, Cas, but it would be the fastest option.” Dean took his regular seat at an angle on top of the front of the desk. “Easy money, and lots of it.”
“Shhh. Calm yourself, Kitten. No one’s going to hurt you. I’m not even going to touch you. I’ll just leave this here.”  Cas set the vibrator into a clamp below April’s crotch, and he tightened the screws. The support bar ended with a wide brace across her hips, but had she wanted, a mere shift of the angle of her hips would have brought her into delicious contact with the vibrator. Dean’s eyes were as wide as April’s. Self-control would be an agony this close to her Heat.
“I hadn’t thought about it.”  Cas turned to look through the windshield.  “It wouldn’t be fair to forbid it out of hand.  I suppose we’d have to keep the option open, wouldn’t we?  Although it would have to be a marriage approved by her familial Alpha, and since that Alpha is also her mate…it’s not especially likely that she’d get an approval.”
“But alpha, I failed.  I choked and retched.  I don’t deserve this.”  Michael’s voice was stretched with his effort to keep still.  The tight, wet tunnel around his dick felt like heaven.  Dean squeezed, and Michael made a noise of raw lust from the back of his throat.
He slammed home again, feeling the impact jolt down his arm into his back, into his hips, and he ached. He realized after the fourth blow that he ached everywhere. He was shaking badly, crying openly, and he swung again, releasing a bloodcurdling wail of torment. The trunk sagged and split beneath the strength of an alpha, no match for the sheer force of Dean’s despair.
Dean wheezed and white-knuckled the arm of the couch. He craned his neck to seek fresh air and keened.
“I was going to submit an application to establish our Pack.  We don’t have to, not today.  I still need to go in because I haven’t filed April’s ‘Change of Custody’ form, but we don’t have to do the other.  I can wait until you’re ready, Dean.  I mean it.”  Castiel watched Dean’s face with concern and understanding.
Dean sighed heavily. “Yes! All right! Yes! I felt vulnerable as hell and the thing is, that feeling? Like he had
She blushed at the moniker and the clear command, but she lifted onto her tiptoes and kissed his cheek.
“Indirectly,” said Dean cryptically.  “It wasn’t about what you did to him during your negotiations over me though.”  Dean stopped walking and turned to his fiancé.  “Was that really necessary, Cas?  Tell me you didn’t have a choice, man.  You scared the shit out of him.  Was it worth it?”
She licked her lips and engaged. “Sir, it won’t be the same. I’ve read your work. It’s brilliant. It’s what got me into this in the first place. But it’s all from the wolves’ point of view. There’s no point of reference that ties it to the Primates. Sir, please. I’m not going to put anyone at risk. I’m not going to judge you. There’s no arguing with your training techniques. I’ve seen the statistics. Since you opened your doors, everything’s better: crime by Lupins, crime against Lupins, mental illness, chronic disease, poverty, cases of abuse, illegal prostitution, drug use, employment rates, stability and opportunity, it’s all better. It’s
“Why, Dean?” Michael asked, his eyes glued to the words.  “You did all the research before you ever met me.  It was Cas, not me, who…”
Crowley knew what Castiel wanted. He wanted full control. He wanted to direct both organizations. Crowley twitched at the very idea. His instincts rebelled at having that much power in the hands of a man so clearly obsessed with his own supremacy. Crowley was no saint himself, but he had a mandate from the Keller Foundation, and he meant to see it through. Dismantling the old guard had taken much too long in building momentum. Once he finally wedged his fingers into the cracks and showed how much rot lay in the groundwork, the Foundational Board finally let him swing the ax ruthlessly, but they only allowed it on the contingency that what he built in its place was stronger and safer than what he’d pulled down.
“That’s great,” Jack told him cheerfully. “Let me put the details into the system, and I’ll get you set. He can come in for the exam and blood tests any time next week. The clinic doesn’t require an appointment for that.” He reclaimed the mouse and keyboard from Erich, who seemed sad to see the profiles disappear to be replaced by dry forms. Jack patted his thigh reassuringly and nodded him toward a wall display rack full of brochures for different contract designations. The brochures held many of the same photos, and Erich busied himself perusing them.
“I do,” Cas allowed. “We both value stability, Uriel.” Cas let a pause in the conversation emphasize that both Alphas were busily reading the other’s scent. “I’ll have the champagne on ice. You won’t regret this. She’s perfect for you, she and Helene, both.”
“Yup. Every little hamlet and major city is probably as overwhelmed as we are here tonight. Some of them undoubtedly paid attention to history and were ready. Lawrence Kansas, not so much. Here, he’s calling for you.” Dean held the tent flap open for Michael to duck through. He followed his mate into the warm, if slightly stuffy, tent. Cas pointed Michael toward a seated registrar.
Cas placed his own hand on top of Dean’s and said, “So now we turn back to the uncomfortable conversation of Kate and her foster alpha. There is an Ozzie living in my home under the auspices of a probational stint as nanny to my children with neither my invitation nor my permission. I’m not about to forget that, Dean. Applying to the state board to foster her while her legal battles are in limbo without first obtaining my nod was a subversive trick.”
Dean turned to face April. She peeked up at him again. He raised his eyebrows. She licked her lips. Behind Dean, Sam and Jess climbed back onto the coach with the twins. Dean grabbed hold of the overhead rack and leaned out of the walkway to let them pass. It brought him closer to April, and she leaned further away.
“I don’t need a bratty brother, Dean Winchester.  Gabe is brat enough for anyone.  Go on, get off of me.  Get out!”  She shoved him off, and he let her, still chuckling, but testing her scent for signs of real distress.  There were none.
A big thank you to all of you who sat in the darkness with me this last round.  You help more than you can possibly know.
Cas looked up and pinned Dean in place with his eyes.  “I won’t know whether to take it seriously until I’ve
“Yes, on both counts, alpha Winchester. I’m happy to agree with you about his attributes. Coffee, Omega? May I bring you anything else?”
“I can’t catch a fucking break!” he sobbed.  “I’ve tried so hard to turn over a leaf and jump where they said to jump, and it’s all smoke and mirrors!  I’ve spent my whole fucking life in freefall, and I’m STILL falling!”
Cas recoiled in disgust.  “You did this!  What the hell is wrong with you?  Someone could have been killed!”
Before Meg could respond, Charlie was out the door and flipping off the foreman who stood a dozen yards away with his phone to his ear.  All around, as the newly risen sun bathed the construction site in a warm glow, workers looked up from their morning tasks to watch her stalk across the property, her red hair ablaze as it flared out behind her.
The threat made Dean pause.  It figured.  Leave it to the brat to kick up a fuss over every argument Michael threw at him until he dangled the carrot.  Michael’s face told Dean he was busted, and Dean had the grace to blush.  He rubbed the back of his neck and buried his lower face in his crossed arm, thinking hard, working back into his head where he needed to be.
“Uh, sure, Alpha.” Michael pushed his chair back and looked down. Dean’s eyes were wide, his breathing harder than normal. “Dean? Is it all right with you if Castiel tackles this one on his own?” Dean’s wide eyes narrowed a little in thought. He shrugged, and then he nodded. Michael passed the answer to the Alpha.
Michael let that statement stand without comment.  The silence lengthened.  Michael’s phone buzzed in his hand.
“If I’m not wiping it off, you can assume I want it there. Leave it alone or suffer my displeasure.” Cas slipped another broccoli floret into Dean’s mouth to protect the brat from his own smart mouth. He kissed Dean’s nose. The cafeteria offered a selection of finger foods just for this sort of sharing. It wasn’t Dean’s favorite lunch, but he did enjoy the feeding itself.
“I’m so fucking sorry, alpha. I’m so sorry. You don’t even know. I would never hurt you like that, not on purpose. Can you ever forgive me?”
“That’s not true.  You didn’t see him from the inside when we thought you and Michael were going to leave us.”
Michael moved to the side where Dean couldn’t see him, even with his peripheral vision, and dialed the manor house.  He could still salvage this.  All he had to do was fess up to Michael that the hairbrush was in his bathroom drawer where he’d put it when he unpacked, and although he’d still get it from Michael, Cas never needed to find out.  But he couldn’t speak.
Dean nodded in the darkness.  Their eyes had adjusted.  Enough light leaked past the heavy curtains from the sleepless city that they could both see.  “Dean, he and I are not balanced.  No matter how much I’ve come to accept how it’s going to be, he still stole from me.  I should have had you to myself, but I didn’t.  I don’t.  I never will.  He owes me.  It’s a simple matter of pack justice.”
He raised her up and encircled her in his arms.  She clung to him and melted into his chest.  They stood together, letting their Mating-bond speak all the words they couldn’t say out loud, swaying just slightly.  Finally, Castiel let his arm slide downward to support her backside, and he lifted her easily.  She wrapped her bare legs around him without emerging from where she was breathing in his scent, and he carried her, naked, to the dining room.  Dean swept up her clothes and followed, setting them under Castiel’s chair at the head of the table.  Cas set April down in a cushioned chair next to his own, but he didn’t give her permission to dress.
“That’s probably for the best right now, Omega,” she reassured him.  “If you’re not going to do anything about it, there’s no reason to torture each other.”  There was an unsaid portion left hanging in the air between them – why wasn’t Michael moving to do anything about it?  She didn’t ask, but he knew she wanted to.  Dean was so close to Tripping, all it would take would be a deep, filthy kiss or a little light dry humping, and he would topple over into all she wrote.  Michael’s body would likely respond within half a day.
“No, Sir.  You were right.  I don’t know what came over me.  That was a shit thing to do.”  Dean’s face registered the swift swirling of his mind.  He seemed caught between his alpha designation and his front brain submissive.  His eyes flickered from point to point restlessly.
“Are you coming?” he asked Nicholas.  Nick shrugged and lifted the tome he was holding, an indication that he needed the weekend alone to study.  It was either that or he was in no mood to nurse his roommate back to good spirits.  Castiel didn’t give him a second thought.  It was probably best that the Omega had a couple of days to himself.
“Yikes.”  There was no judgment.  There was just a soft sort of sympathy, and it kicked tears into her eyes that she hated.
They weren’t only talking shop though.  Cas interspersed the job of orienting themselves for the week with grilling Michael over the exercises he’d been assigned, and the Omega was on top of both.  He jotted unrelated notes in his book even as he carefully described to Cas every instance he’d catalogued through the day of his wolf’s impulse to suppress the Omega and how the interaction had turned out.
“Lemme up!  Stop, man.  Let me…catch my breath.”  Dean wormed his way up and slunk backward onto the couch without covering up.
“Up you go, my love,” Cas said cheerfully.  He uprighted her then swept her into his arms to carry her into the bathroom where he stood her by the sink and began to give her a painstakingly slow sponge bath.  Michael stood balefully in the middle of the room, totally lost, unsure of what had just happened or what it meant.
Naomi looked around her room sadly.  She wasn’t going to miss it at all, but she was once again completely untethered, and she felt an impulse to cling to the horrible space simply to have something knowable at her back.  She felt small, a sensation she hadn’t felt in years and years.
Benny turned his sparkle onto Dean. “What’d I do? Well, it seems to me we got, oh, I’d guess seventy-five percent of the fellas at this table walking ginger today, and I know I’m right as rain. So, you do the math.”
They rounded the still pool and slipped through a wide French door into the short hallway that opened into the rear of the dining room on one end and the main parlor on the other. Dean nearly ran into April’s upturned hand. She had frozen at the arched entranceway, the plastic bag swinging on her wrist as she caught Dean in the chest. She put a finger to her lips. Her eyes were wide and amused. “Dim your bond,” she whispered. “Don’t let him know you’re here yet.”
Dean replied. “Michael had the last of it, Fred. We’re gonna head down to the H/R room to get Cain cleaned up. You’ll vouch for where we are if Cas goes on a tear with his flock all spread out, won’t you?”
There was the tone that Cain’s body responded to unwittingly. He turned his back – and thus his groin – on April.
was really strange. Dean usually jumped at the chance to get his freak on with the Big Bad Wolf himself.
Sam answered her.  “Because there IS a distinction between DF and rape, but no Primate was ever willing to listen long enough to understand that distinction.  We’re very much hoping you’ll be the first.  Give us a chance to show you how it works.  Please.”
“Oh, come on, Alpha.  So she got turned on with having you watch.  That’s a common kink for Ozzies.  You can’t blame her for taking the opportunity when it was there.  Doesn’t mean she’s going to fuck him randomly from now on.  In fact, the fact she was so blatant about it this time proves she’s not planning to make a habit of it.  She probably saw this as her one and only chance to see you watch her take another alpha’s Claim.  She was probably hoping you’d be proud of how well-behaved she was.”
At last, there was a break in the tension. Dean’s eyes showed a sudden mirth that Cas didn’t try to translate, and he cleared his throat. Both of them turned in startlement. They had obviously forgotten he was there.
Cas saw that too.  “Get your head off the wall, beta,” Cas reminded him.  Sam straightened.  Castiel turned to Benny.  “I understand your misgivings about Cole.  We’ve discussed his attitude and his approach, but I agree with Bobby on this.  We can keep a close eye on his progress down there.  I’m not going to take my eye off the ball again, but we need to give the boy a chance.  I’ve put a lot of thought into why this fiasco happened in the first place, and I think it’s because we hold too much of the power and the learning opportunities to just the wolves in this room.  If we don’t start spreading it around and allowing more of the younger staff into the inner workings, we’re not giving our colleagues at our satellite facilities enough of a chance to learn what they need to know.  None of us will be here forever, and we’ve been hoarding it mostly to ourselves.”
the hot water on his skin right now.  Not just awareness that he’s warm, but I can actually feel the shower as if it was me in there.”  Jo pulled her knees up to make a tent in the blanket and rested her forearms on them.  “It’s amazing.  I can feel the wound on his shoulder sting when the water hits it.  I can feel the emotions that make him want to keep running water over it and making it sting again and again.”
” he said with emphasis, lowering his chin. “Allowed a beta-Neutral, who you’ve already accosted once, to put a rope corset on you, and you wore it to class.”
“Good. Then we understand one another. I will not forget what my wolf had to say on Friday, Winchester, and neither should you. Both its actions and its words hold profound significance between us. Do not expect to goad me into repeating that performance. It won’t happen. I make the rules in this house, in this marriage, and in our Tertiary exploits. Unless you’ve changed your mind about acceding to that – and if you have, I promise nothing but will hear you out – I expect this discussion to put your outrage to rest.”
Cas couldn’t look away from Michael’s eyes, golden and glowing. Michael panted hard. Sweat dripped down his temple, his chin, his hairless chest.
He felt light, easy, blissful in a way he couldn’t begin to describe.  He chuckled at the idea of a harp plucking S.O.B. sitting on a cloud and watching the world pass beneath him.  This wasn’t that.  If this was heaven, then it was built by someone who knew how to throw a world together right.  It was built by someone who knew Dean from the tips of his gelled hair to the dusty scuff of his boots, and he smirked.
“Got it,” answered Jody. She was a beta, and she could smell that he was as well. He wasn’t going to get a ‘Sir’ from her just because he was cranky and authoritarian. That was going to have to be earned.
Michael shook his head.  “You’re living in a dream world, alpha.  A relationship like this might work for two alphas who can’t keep their hands off each other, but the best I can hope for is to be allowed Omega fucking rights with her.  Aren’t the horny little Omegas cute together?  It’s not ever going to be enough.  It’s not about sex, Dean.  Christ, I don’t even want to scene with her.  I want…”  Michael clamped his mouth shut, aware suddenly that he was saying too much.  Dean was Castiel’s – lock, stock, and barrel – and whatever the Omega told his mate would get back to Castiel.
Michael dropped the tablet he carried with all the lyrics loaded on it.  He ignored everyone else, and he ran after her with a quiet, “Pete,” on his lips.
“So,” Dean started again.  “The secondary and tertiary are bigger and wider than the average bear.  That’s not really news, kid.  Tell me about the other one.”
Michael couldn’t argue the logic. Cas and Dean put in intense hours at the Facility. Both of them came home spent more days than not. Michael’s commitment to his fledgling career had been rigorously tested from every direction, and he found himself determined to make a go of it, but that left him limited hours in each day too, no matter how he rearranged. Michael did most of his schoolwork and what classes he could in the evenings, leaving his mornings free to be a mother to his pups. But sometimes he encountered a pinch point where only a concerted effort and hours of studying could see him through the next test, the next practical – times like today.
“He’s really, really pissed at you, man. I just don’t know… You may get your teeth knocked in before you have a chance to say a word.”
Dean shared a quick glance with Jess and then with April.  They’d both seen it, too.  Clearly, Cain was the kind of Sub whose needs were fulfilled entirely through private intentional scening.  Outside of the bedroom, not a whit showed to give him away.  If anything, he appeared dominant in public carriage.  Dean thought rapidly through the Doms on the Contract wing, wondering if any of them had the weight to handle Cain.  Unlike Dean, who sometimes had to fight the desire to roll for the Neutrals on staff, Cain probably wouldn’t kneel for any but the most Profound Dominants.  And he likely needed an alpha-Dominant at that; someone without a trace of humor to their play; someone like Raphael or Uriel, someone hard and unforgiving.  Someone intense and somber.
Dean’s fingers went cold, and his cock throbbed.  He hesitated to answer the question, but in the end, he had no real choice.  “No, Sir.  There is no excuse.”
“We’re not bandaging it,” Billie stated. “And I can clean it myself, thanks.” A look from Benny ruffled her further. “And you can keep your stupid
What she now knew dovetailed seamlessly with what she’d seen of him as she watched him remove Dr. Meyer with a scalpel and military precision. He was indeed ruthless where his enemies were concerned. He was cold, unforgiving, decisive—Gabe hadn’t even shied away from the label psychotic—but to become one of Castiel Winchester’s enemies took deliberate work. It wasn’t accidental. It was only with a history of weighted works at one’s back, weighted to cause harm, to destroy people, to undermine what was being tirelessly built, that drew his ire and his action. Castiel removed these people like carving mold out of a wedge of cheese. He kept the good and cut out the bad. And he continued always to build. It happened everywhere at once.
“You’re beautiful, Pet. So good for me.”  Cas broke his kiss to praise his Sub only to dive back in and kiss him again, deeper and wetter, more desperate.
Michael smirked. “Mm-hm, and that’s your big dream? To join the Topeka Kansas Symphony Orchestra and spend your life there? Hey, I’m not judging. It’s good you have a dream.” Michael took a carrot, dipped it, and took tiny bites, re-dipping after each one and chewing with his mouth open.
to do.  Fuck, Cas, I’m drooling over the very idea.  It feels like a ravenous beast just woke up inside me, and he’s starving for it, but it’s not my tertiary.  Bring on the masses with their cocks out, Michael!  Bend me over and use me hard, then wipe my ass off and throw me up on the shelf until you need me for a party favor again!  And I’ll take every hit and every degrading word, and I’ll soak it up and feed off it.”
“Yeah, call it,” Dean told her.  “We’re done here.  Log it at 10:47 a.m.  Wrap it up.  Give them some privacy.  Ellen, it’s all yours.  Nice work as usual, Omega.  You’re amazing.”
Dean leaned across the bench and put his hand over hers.  “Charlie could never hate you, kiddo.  Maybe you helped more than she was ready for.  If she lashed out, that’s not hate, it’s fear.  I need you to buck up, stand up straight, look her straight in the eye, and be real for her.  She doesn’t need you to cave on her now.  She needs you to be strong.  That’s what Pack does.”
Cas was already breathing deeply and evenly on one side of the enormous bed.  He looked very wrong alone in the bed that could easily hold all four of them.  Dean tucked himself in the opposite side and eased backward up against his Alpha’s warm naked body.  Cas adjusted to him in his sleep, sliding an arm across his ribs without waking up.  Dean pushed his ass back into Castiel’s groin, seeking as much contact as he could get.
Cas manhandled her left leg around his body until her torso fell and she had to catch herself on her hands or risk smashing her chin into the floor.  He wrapped her legs around his waist, leaned way down and scratched his blunt fingernails the length of her back from her shoulders to her ass, dragging them painfully over the scorched red flesh, leaving white streaks in their wake that slowly turned into red welts.
She giggled, slightly hysterical. “Is anyone ever ready?” Her belly swooped and her feet broke out in a cold sweat. “But I can’t swim if I don’t jump into the deep end. Besides, you haven’t done a teacher eval in years, you prick.”
Michael bolted.  He disappeared through the door, still nude and wearing a pair of expensive running shoes.  Dean grinned.  “Two.”
“The cops are on their way, Omega.  I’ll send them an SOS that there’s a mother and child trapped between the crowd and front wall.  They’re trained to handle this.”
Sending so much love to the Pack.  Y'all are my rock. (Yes, that's subject/object agreement.  It's a big rock.)
“This is their son, Michael.”  Naomi smiled warmly at Michael and shook his hand for a little too long, wrapping her other hand around to keep him in place after practically dumping her drink at Rachel to hold.  Rachel caught it in surprise.  Dean sat forward on the couch, suddenly much less ready to slouch his way through the evening.  “Michael is Dean’s new mate.  They’ve only been Mated for about a month.”
“Very well. The next regular training session begins in two weeks. Billie will arrange to have your orientation scheduled and get your access to The Facility arranged. You will go nowhere in my building without an escort, not even into the restroom.”  Cas finished his coffee and slid to the end of the booth. “Billie?” he asked. “Have you got everything you need?”
Bobby stood to leave but paused in the doorway.  He kept his gaze straight ahead at the doorframe opposite as he stopped and leaned against the jamb.  Bobby was part owner, but his employment was contingent upon Castiel’s approval.  Always had been.
“He’s not a twenty, Dean. There’s really no such thing unless they redraw the chart, thanks to our Alpha. Plus, Castiel Claimed him with no issue or any significant struggle. He’s nowhere near Castiel’s twenty.”
“Kitten, would you please take Alex upstairs?” Cas prompted calmly. The phone rang again, but no one moved to answer it. Fred was fielding their calls and organizing the glut of media requests. There was already a line of news vans growing at the gate.
“At the end when I fucked him. I’m telling you, Dean. It goes this way for me all the time.” Michael watched himself, his own cheeks beginning to flush, and his penis rising slowly over his bare belly there on the couch. They watched it play out in silence. Dean stretched and set his plate on the coffee table, and after a moment, Michael did too. “All I have to do is think about it, will it, and a Claim sparks,” he added softly.
Cas ignored the growing tension between his Omegas.  Soon, they would find an outlet to express and release the sexual tension that nearly made occupying the same room with them both impossible.  Dean had a point it seemed.  They were Omegas after all.  He was delusional to think they would be able to resist one another forever.
Dean stared at her.  “I wouldn’t miss it for the world, kid.”  He ran a hand over the back of his neck and reversed course to head out into the sunshine toward the woods down past the big tree.
“He’s not talking about it,” Michael conceded, grabbing a new basket from the stack and upending it on the floor to begin sorting through.  “But I can tell it’s eating him.  He misses his dad.  Kinda strange considering they spent Dean’s entire adult life fighting.  And especially when Ellen holds one of the pups…”  Michael looked up at his sister and took a deep breath.  “I think Ellen must be a lot like his mom was.  I get this heartbreaking sadness from Dean whenever he sees Ellen with the pups.”
They planned the menu, then Michael phoned several caterers to arrange for quotes and tastings and let Castiel show him the inner workings of their accounting system and how expenses were documented.  Michael clutched the arm of his chair in shock when the numbers flashed across the screen in front of him.  There were…a lot of digits.
“All right.  I know how much it eats away at you when you feel guilty, so we’re going to take care of this right now.”  He opened the report so he could determine what the stroke-count should be and whether she’d Released during her previous run-ins or not.  “Afterward, I want you to take an Epsom-salt bath and relax while I make dinner.  Go ahead and get yourself placed.”  According to the report, she was given 10 for forgetting her homework, just 5 for losing the game, and 20 for arguing in class.  He owed her 70 tonight and could expect a substantial Release.  She was a little overdue.  He reminded himself to ask her more about the fight over dinner.
“I fucked up, Benny. I can’t fix it. All I can do is shake myself up, learn from it, apologize to everyone as if that could make any difference, and try to move on and be a better man. I wish I could turn myself in, take responsibility for what I did, but I can’t do that. As you say, everything depends on me. I’m so sorry.” Cas leaned against the wall, letting it hold him up.
“Hm,” Michael replied. “Well, I’ll know for sure after my test. Come on. Up you get. Let’s go face the gauntlet.” Michael stood and pulled her up with him. He didn’t bother to dress. Neither did April. They gathered their scattered clothes, Michael discovering that his blue jeans were ripped irreparably. He waggled his fingers at her through the hole and she smirked.
Dean scoffed.  “Don’t give me that stink-eye.  You’d be all for it as long as you were allowed to watch.”
“Oh. Yes. We’ve got a Pack member convalescing in one of the lower rooms. She won’t be needing dessert, Tony. If you like, you may enjoy the last one yourself.” Michael spoke with authority, and Tony couldn’t have known to check with the Alpha before bowing politely and ducking out.
