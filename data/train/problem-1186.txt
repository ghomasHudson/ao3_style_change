The ice covered him from feet to head and John wondered if he should quit while he was ahead.
John doesn’t mind this sneeze jump as much as the others. Sure, going through basic training a second time wasn’t exactly a blast, but he knew what to expect and what’s more, he still found some level of enjoyment in pushing his body to the limits.
He was so caught up in his desperate wishes and thoughts that he didn’t notice when the ringing in his ears began. He barely twitched when his nose began to tickle. But as he took a deep breath and felt the pressure build and soar, he found himself crossing his fingers. He hoped. It was all he had left. Hope.
He didn’t sneeze.
It was the two of them against the rest of the world. One day, he would convince the silly man to believe in it too. Whether or not he believed in it while also knowing all about Sherlock and his abilities….well, it was a possibility to consider later.
John sneezed. Loudly. Violently.
So-called prevention techniques looked sketchy at best, ranging from obvious things such as removing irritants like dog hair or cleaning the house regularly for dust and dirt to pinching the bridge of the nose gently and breathing deeply.
He didn’t know what happened. He still wasn’t quite sure about the how. As time wore on, it became easier and easier to forget that at one stage, he had celebrated hitting a decade of existence in the world. It was difficult to remember things like that while learning how to master the jungle gym at the local park, racing cars with Daniel at playgroup and struggling to articulate desires and feelings generally, let alone discuss the possibility of being ten years old rather than three to his parents.
In the blaze of Sherlock’s deduction and energy, John felt the ice around his eyes melt enough to see clearly for the first time in what felt like forever. He saw clearly enough to agree to have a crazy new flatmate.
If Sherlock couldn’t deduce this on his own, perhaps one day he’d be able to muster up the words to tell him.
John didn’t sleep the night before his birthday, the feeling of dread having turned into something cold and restricting. Sometimes, John felt as though he couldn’t breathe through the ice that had made a home inside him. The day of his birth came and went – with friends and cake – and no ringing in his ears or feeling the slightest urge to sneeze.
The next day John handed in his resignation even as he signed up to join the army as a part of the RAMC. For the first time in a long while, John’s lips twitched up in a semblance of a smile as he signed his name on the enlistment form.
John waved her off with a shake of his head and a small smile. He stretched and felt the bullet wound in his shoulder pull slightly, making him wince. Reasonably recent then. He had time. And until now, that wasn’t something John took great pleasure in, but now, now he felt his lips twitch as he struggled to contain his laugh of relief.
Doctor.
For now, they were Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, perfectly average in their own brand of normal.
Was there any point to attempting to achieve anything or was he just a sneeze away from starting all over again?
Was his decision to finish school early this time going to be the difference which meant he wouldn’t sneeze himself back again?
In order to cope, John Watson forgot that he ever was anything more than what he is right now.
He wasn’t stopping.
On the day John graduates, he does so with distinctions and yet can barely muster up a smile for his mum or for the camera.
John became very curious about the mechanics of sneezing. The public library only had limited resources but what he found was both disturbing and reassuring. Sneezing was completely involuntary, ergo he couldn’t choose to sneeze even if he wanted to. Yet something which reassured him greatly was discovering that one couldn’t sneeze in their sleep. He wouldn’t go to sleep in one time at a certain age and wake up another time a different age. He’d always be completely awake with every jump
He's pulled from his pleasant thoughts when the driver coughs "Uh, Boss? We're here."
“No, no,” Molly quickly reassured, “just pushy. In the non-literal sense. They’re all just…we’re a quiet town,” she offered by way of explanation. “They’re hungry for something aside from the upcoming school plays and community charity events.”
Apparently John’s understanding is a cue for Sherlock, because the man leans forward and kisses him. As if John’s realization of his helplessness and his fear of profound shame is erotic. John kisses back anyway, because there’s really nothing else he can do.
But random acts of murder and blood ritual as a sign of affection would go unappreciated by John Watson. More than likely it would inspire revulsion.
After Jim had caught his breath again he said, “Well now, I believe that has done wonders in improving my temperament.” His fingers probed inside of the abused red rim of John’s hole. “I don’t think you’ve been this loose even when we’ve taken you twice in one night Johnny-boy.”
John felt so unsure of himself that if he had not been leaning against the wall, he was sure he would have lost his footing and slid to the floor.
He knew it was the end when he could feel prickly pubic hair. The crystal-clear memory of Sherlock’s cock, and the knowledge that all of it was now buried inside of him, made hot flashes run up and down John’s skin.
“Perhaps you can mind your own business for a change,” Sherlock acerbically retorted, “and stop trying to parent me. It’s embarrassing.”
He whispers sinfully in John's ear. "I'm going to fuck you." John doesn't whimper, doesn't protest. But the fear rolls off of him in waves, and his hands are clenched so tightly that he may cut into skin. "This won't be painful for you John, I swear it. But as I said yesterday, you won't receive an orgasm unless you ask for it."
“No, you didn’t,” John was far from mad about it. He was grinning, pleased to have called out on Sherlock’s ridiculous need for theatrics. “You also didn’t need to have us jump into the bushes either.”
“What the hell?” John blurted.
John mopped up his coffee with a napkin and wryly said, “I think a formal apology is the better way to go, or else they really
There was a muffled bang down the hall. The paramedics were here. Sherlock took out a small compact disk of white cream and smeared it on his chin. It wasn’t a perfect job, but with the rush the medics would be in, they likely wouldn’t notice.
don’t seem like the kind of man who’s modest.”
“Ah it’s alright sir, this one’s on the house. For all the good your husband and his business partner provide the town. Finest liquor in the establishment.”
John berated himself for being frightened of nothing. John knew the effects of fever on a man, and the previous night’s events were hazy due to said infection. Lord only knew what he had done to himself in a fit of wildness.
It would be inaccurate of John to think of the greenhouse as spotless when he stepped inside. After all, there were tools the gardener had left strewn about, and the potted dirt and melting snow tarnished the pathways. Yet there was no broken glass, no pools of blood, no sign of a struggle. Just a greenhouse, with all of the signs of care and maintenance attached to it.
John took a few moments to breathe out. It helped to avoid an unnecessary mess in the infirmary by smashing everything to pieces. A whirl of complicated feelings churned his insides. John’s mind ticked over every revelation he’d learned. His understanding of Sherlock, Mycroft’s accusations, and John’s confused feelings kept him from establishing any firm hold on reality. Calm slid from him like a live eel, ready to swing around and bite him if given the chance.
“You have to say it,” Sherlock insists, rolling his hips and watching as his cock slides in and out of John’s body.
. Oh God what does this mean? Is Mr. Holmes going to get fired? Is he going to be expelled? His parents will never forgive him. Mr. Holmes will be branded as a sex offender. Oh God, John can't feel his limbs.
They walked for more than an hour in the dark. The neighborhood they ended up in was less than reputable, but John had seen far worse in London. Up ahead, there was a large and abandoned building. From the rusted gates and numerous smaller facilities, it was the remnants on an old plant.
While John would normally have been flattered by this praise, he was only confused now. Just a moment ago the man had said he wasn’t even good enough to shovel horse shit. Now he was piling on the flattery.
“Fuck’s sake,” John cursed into the pillow. It took him less than two seconds to come to a decision. “Were you tested during your rehab?”
Back when he'd still shared a nest with Harry, they'd always turn on each other. It was something of a catharsis, even if the exchanged words always did more harm than good. She would start off by telling him not to be so damned depressing, he would retort by saying she could show a little respect.
Sherlock cards his fingers through John's short blonde hair when he's back in his body. John stiffens, mortified at what just occurred. Did he really just come in his trousers? From kissing?
“Impatient,” Sherlock chastised as he laid his body flush against John’s. Finally, the craving of their skin was being satisfied.
“Oh, little brother. What have you done?”
A genuine groan escapes John's throat, and he flushes. Sherlock grins against his mouth, and repeats the motion, but with firmer suction. The hands touching John's face become greedier, moving down his neck to his collarbone. Sherlock's careful about not pressing too much of his weight on the doctor, he kneels between John's parted thighs, and lust racks through his brain.
Later that night, John was alone in his room. Sherlock and his business partner, Jim, had taken the guest rooms. Even though this meaninglessly large house was more occupied than it had been in a very long while, John still felt it was empty without Harry’s raucous laughter.
John blinked the crud away from his eyes. The sun had warmed his face into wakefulness. The curtains were flung wide open to display the white winter sun. Even having slept well past his normal hour, John felt exhausted.
Sherlock silently assessed him before he bluntly asked, “Does my sexuality bother you?”
"What?" John's eyes shoot open, and he stares at Sherlock. Who is just looking at him impassively. "Fuck no, I'm not doing that." Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Jim grinned at him, “Oh we know. So, help us settle a little dispute Johnny. Sherlock and I both have an invested interest in a certain project. This is not just any small business venture. This is the coup-de-grace, the magnum opus if you will.”
“Oh, how could I forget,” Jim said. “You’re going to love this Johnny. Well, not really, but
Soon, Sherlock picks up his pace, which causes John to cry out. He releases the spit-slick cock, suddenly caught up in Sherlock's prick brushing against his prostate. His legs tremble, and his knees ache from their standing position. Jim takes himself in hand, feeling the steady burn of orgasm rise up inside of him.
After he’d soothed his thirst, he tentatively rose out of bed. Every part of him ached, and he cursed his illness more as a man who enjoyed his health than as a budding physician. John picked up a small mirror to inspect his morning stubble and debate the wisdom in handling a straight razor when he felt so weary. Something in his reflection caught his eye.
Which, John thinks, may be the wrong thing to do. Should he fake apathy to the fate of his sister? It was his protest that got Angelo killed in the first place.
John let out a breath. His hands were steady as he clasped Sherlock’s shoulder. “The second you feel something is off, get out of there. I’ll watch your back.”
But this time Sherlock is clearly waiting for something, and John’s not sure what. He hopes that he’s not
Sherlock presses his mouth to John when he comes, trying to give back the gift of the anti-kiss. John accepts, lapping his tongue in Sherlock's mouth.
"Yeah I'll bet you don't, wallets and phones, now." The leader is waving a knife while his two companions watch the street for any curious Samaritans. John shifts and the man gets closer, and the knife is now steady. "Hey! No sudden moves!" John stops and Sherlock can actually feel the sarcasm when he speaks again, "She's kinda blocking my way mate. Unless you want a go at my trousers?" The reaction is quick, and Sherlock nearly reveals himself when the man cuts John's cheek. Regardless if this man escapes, Sherlock vows to have him killed.
He wants to go home. Wherever that is now.
Sherlock flinched at the accusation, but didn’t refute it.
John expelled a strained laugh, “This just all seems quite mad.”
John's mind is too busy whiting out to respond to the rhetorical question. A year? A full year? They've been...'together' for that long now? When he focuses again on Sherlock, he looks contemplative.
“Sherlock,” John’s voice was raspy with want, “I’m ready.” Sherlock paid him no heed. He only bent his head down to kiss and bite along John’s neck and collarbone.
John doesn’t forget all that he ever was in favour of who he is now.
John smiled at the decorations scattered around the living room. Red and green were truly garish colours when paired together and yet somehow, it all seemed so festive and happy. There was just something about this time of year with everything it entailed.  He even tolerated Harry quite happily, all sibling disputes and rivalry put on hold for the holiday.
Yet another thing John had left unspoken. John didn’t want all the unspoken things resting in his chest anymore. He wanted to set them free, but only if Sherlock was around to hear them.
John smiled as he picked up his coat off the back of the chair. This wasn’t working for him anymore and there was a certain relief in acknowledging the fact.
That day, John decided – fuck it. He was done with spending his time with his nose in a book. No more dragging around textbooks or feverishly writing notes or spending hours upon hours studying for an exam that was over and done with in the blink of an hour. John was done. As a qualified doctor, he knew all this stuff already.
Although John considered that maybe the pressure building up in one’s head probably didn’t feel nice, ordinary sneeze or not. And certainly the tickle in the nose was confusing because did that mean he should scratch his nose or not? Would scratching help? The sensation didn’t seem to register properly so he could respond in a way that helped…
“John. I can manipulate water and bend it to my will. It means I’ve never in my life had a cold cup of tea. Dull. Now about that murder Lestrade’s just called about…”
Then the sand storm hits. John and his unit duck for cover wherever they can find it, caught in the middle of a patrol in unfamiliar territory. John doesn’t quite get his scarf up to cover his face in time and as the dirt fills his nostrils; he feels a familiar pressure accompanied by the ringing in his ears.
Yet John found himself utterly enraptured during his research about sneezing and the human body generally. Gradually, his books involved less information on the specifics of sneezing and more about the body and how it worked. When it came to make potential career choices, John knew with a stunning clarity he hadn’t felt in years what he’d like to study.
John got shot.
At fifteen, John resigned himself to the fact that small and short may just be what the fates had in store for him. He knew all about growth rates and hormones and all that jazz, but even as his mates towered over him, it was disconcerting when half the female population looked down on him as well before they even bothered to put on their high heels. But even as he resigned himself to not having a whole lot more height in him, he decided that his size would have little to do with how he conducted himself. He made it an advantage when on the rugby field. Any opponent who dared to think the smaller boy was in some way incapable regretted the assumption.
Were there any events which were consistent each time he jumped backwards? Were there things which changed? Were there things he could deliberately change? Was there something other than sneezing which served as a catalyst for his time jumps? Was there any logic to the ages he went back to or the age he was before he jumped back? Was there a purpose? Did he have some grand task to fulfil or an epic adventure to embark upon?
John smiled. This time, he would save Sherlock. He would not jump. This time, he would know he was loved. He didn’t have to return it, but this time Sherlock would know that he had saved a man by melting the ice around his heart.
Even as John threw himself into experiencing his childhood a second time his parents struggled with a child they grew increasingly concerned for. John’s parents weren’t raising their son for a second time; they were navigating parenthood for the first time and couldn’t understand John’s behaviour and mannerisms. It was never anything they could firmly place their finger on.
He tried smelling the flowers on his bedside table in the hope the pollen would irritate his nose. He tried swallowing his water too fast without pausing for breath, only to splutter water down the front of his shirt just as a nurse arrived to check on him.
He coughed and spluttered through the last dregs of his drink, feeling the tickle from his throat all the way to his nose. With a quick shake of his head, he paused before settling deeper into the comfort of his chair.
The day he learnt he wasn’t subpar at anything was the day he decided he would be whatever the hell he wanted to be, Mycroft be damned. Well, the child’s equivalent of such a decision. It had taken considerably more years and a better knowledge of the world which surrounded him before that seed of a thought germinated in creating his own occupation, Consulting Detective.
John sneezes.
Even in Sherlock’s mind palace, that phrasing failed produce favourable results.
The day after, he would celebrate with his family.
He still couldn’t legitimately blame Sherlock when things weren’t quite so ordinary though.
What was the use of being a time traveller anyway, if he couldn’t take advantage of this small thing? Nothing else about the ability seemed worth it, in his mind. With that thought, John hit the books and put his every effort into streamlining his education. He spent some limited time pretending to conform to the expectations his physical body dictated but largely allowed the assumptions of what being gifted entailed to give him more freedom. People thought a gifted child may struggle socially. Excellent. Perhaps he’d use that as a reason to socialise less.
One does not introduce themselves by screaming their undying love for another, after all.
“Do you need anything else, Dr Watson?”
He’d made a time traveller grateful that he sneezed his way through time.
“A case?” John looked almost hopeful to see Sherlock in his armchair, in a typical ‘thinking’ pose.
Black coffee merged with orange highlighter in a sickening, blurry swirl.
He saw clearly enough to shoot the cabbie.
He couldn’t remember much about the first time it happened.
John.
John was done with school and everything to do with it. He couldn’t hide the mismatch between himself and his peers, even if he had tried. He knew that they had tested him for being gifted and decided to play upon the assumption. He could be gifted if he wanted to be. He had a working knowledge of the education system to the level of a fifteen year old and the life experience of a twenty-three year old. He could test again and jump several levels to finish school early. Any qualms about what that would mean for him socially could all go rot because he felt more at ease with those who physically matched his mental age anyway.
He sneezed.
John felt all the ice which had slowly melted under the Afghani sun begin to creep back up and over his skin again, crawling and itchy and cold.
That was surprisingly manageable.
John woke the next morning and requested a belated yet simply birthday gift from his mum. He asked for a calendar to track the months and days. He didn’t care about the pictures, dogs or cats or something to do with whatever was popular at the moment. He just wanted to be able to mark down the days in a vivid red marker, each day a victory against himself and whatever it was that made him sneeze himself back in time the first time.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John barely glanced up from his book long enough to grab the coffee sitting to the right or even paused in reading his sentence to inhale the tar like brew. As a child, he had been lauded as gifted and thus earnt his place here right now, studying medicine. This supposed giftedness didn’t help him pass his exams better than anyone else, though.
Sherlock Holmes was quite used to being anything but average. In fact, for a few short years he’d actually thought he was less than average and with all the logic only a small child could muster, he’d dreaded school. What was the use of discovering new things if he wouldn’t excel at them? Would he always be destined to live in Mycroft’s considerable shadow?
John waited to sneeze.
John was no longer a doctor, merely one of many students attempting to become one.
He couldn’t blame her though. Who sweated so much in the middle of winter?
Sherlock didn’t really have time or patience for normal.
Those things he could certainly attribute to Sherlock.
“Soon, Sherlock. I’ll see you soon.”
Experience and wisdom with the vigour of youth.
On the day John graduated University, he was quite sure you could cut a vein and he’d bleed caffeine. Thanks to his shiny new medical degree, he’d be the one to apply blade to flesh, thank you very much. Nobody could wipe the grin off John’s face, stretching from ear to ear. Not Harry’s absence due to another alcohol-infused bender or the lack of any real friends to celebrate the day with.
The only reason she couldn’t fully call him on his behaviour was because, despite the lack of books in John’s life, he was still excelling at university. He would stay up late the night an assignment was due and in a mad frenzy of typing, would write it up and hand it in the next day, grumbling under his breath about how he couldn’t bring his assignments from his previous experience of uni with him to this time.
That said, you couldn’t wipe the grin off his face the day they handed him his high school diploma as he graduated.
There was nothing typical about a sneeze which blew his consciousness backwards through time to inhabit the younger body of his three year old self.
Briefly, Harry became his drinking partner and wingwoman. Together, they would party, drink and try to perfect their seduction techniques. Eventually, Harry became concerned with John’s drinking.
Dr John Watson rubbed at his eyes as he closed the door behind his last patient of the day, wondering what it would be like if sneezing was merely one of several symptoms that pointed to something perfectly ordinary like asthma or a cold. It must be terribly reassuring, he mused, if sneezing meant naught more than a trip to the doctor and possibly several days off work for recovery.
John kept a notebook, hidden amongst all his textbooks and assignments for school. It was a simple notebook with a black cover and blank, unlined pages. In this book, he noted down what he remembered from the first time he travelled in time, what he noticed the second time and what he noted this time.
If John thought that he had wanted to sneeze after getting shot, he’d clearly underestimated himself.
A sense of dread began to grow in his gut. It felt like a curious mixture of molten lava – roiling hot; and stone - heavy with lethargy. John was going to be ten again soon. The first time he had celebrated this birthday he had been excited to hit double digits. This time, he wondered if he would sneeze himself back to the age of three again. He didn’t want it. He didn’t want to be ten again if it also meant being three as well. He was sick of being so small. He was tired of all the limitations his own body placed on him as well as the restrictions of what was socially acceptable for a young child to say and do. He wanted more. He wanted to be ten for longer than a day, possibly even experience what it was to be older.
John Watson liked to think that at heart, he was a fairly average British male. He liked his tea, he loved his Bond films and he had served Queen and country both on the battlefield and within the walls of a clinic’s office. He didn’t have particularly stunning looks, he was just inside the average height ratio…well, ok he was on the shorter side of average but that was still average, thank you very much!
Dr. Watson with all his fluffy, too large jumpers which hid a surprisingly firm, fit body. A man who merely rolled his eyes at the contents of the fridge before reminding Sherlock again to keep his experiments to the designated shelves and away from the consumables.  John was the man who giggled when Sherlock made a comment where others would stare at him in horror and disgust. He was perfectly ordinary in all the ways that counted and yet didn’t bat at eyelash at Sherlock’s quirks, no matter what he threw at him. John had become indispensable as his conductor of light, which justified Sherlock’s uncertainty that John might not be able to handle yet another thing which made Sherlock anything but average. It’s why he never said a word. He wasn’t sure there was a socially acceptable way to express what he was. What he could do.
Sure, having a mad flatmate made looking in the fridge every morning a daily adventure. Let’s not even talk about the true purpose of a kitchen. Or mention the skull. And he supposed that a bright yellow smiley faced riddled with bullet holes did demonstrate the crumbling façade of human experience in some modern artistic sense.
John didn’t notice the warning signs at first – the pressure slowly building in his head and the ringing in his ears were just attributed to a headache. Too long staring at the blinking lights on the Christmas tree, perhaps.
On the days he wasn’t too tired to function, other students would catch John Watson smiling at random times and for no apparent reason. Sometimes, they’d wonder what it was that he was smiling about.
John can remember feeling his ears ringing even as a strange pressure began to build up in his head. Then the tickle at the back of his nose started. At least the tickle was familiar, a sensation John typically associated right before he sneezed.
John growled to himself before tipping his head back and swallowing the rest of his drink quickly, without pausing for breath.
Each day, he grew older.
He was a doctor. And no sneezing had gotten in the way of is achieving that in the last six years.
John can feel himself learning how to live once again, how to feel alive.
Sherlock was adventure, sarcastic wit, warmth and home. All wrapped up in one ridiculously mysterious, beautiful package. Somehow, Sherlock became his own brand of ordinary which complimented John’s, like two sides of the same coin. That’s when John felt like taking another crack at poetry at any rate.
He would be more than this.
John sighed and gave it up for a bad job at the moment, deciding that a good cup of tea was in order. Perhaps Sherlock had – as he bounced down the last step he heard the kettle whistle and felt a grin tugging at his lips. Perfect.
John began to take risks, because what did it matter if he would end up travelling back and essentially being about to start all over again. He allowed his recklessness to rule over his head and thus saved many, many lives of different soldiers primarily through prioritising their lives over his own. He’d get the chance to have a do-over. They wouldn’t.
As John grew he began to remember more and more of his first ten years, began to compare this time with that time. At a physical age of seven with the mental age of fourteen, John considered his actions and the corresponding consequences in a way no child really thought about such things. He thought about the fact he was thinking of such things in such a way in the first place. Eventually he reached a conclusion about everything that had happened so far. That first backwards jump grew to be accepted by John as ‘normal’ or just ‘it is what it is’, for how else can a child who has nothing but his own experience to draw from possibly understand the reality of the unique ability he had.
He opened his watery eyes to see a pile of text books balanced precariously to the left of a battered desk, a mug of steaming coffee on the right next to some pieces of paper with several lines of text highlighted a bright orange.
Sherlock was everything. And John would make sure he’d know it.
The tickling in his nose grew and grew, until all the twitching and scratching in the world couldn’t seem to help it. It was simply unbearable.
The problem with heat and energy is that John grew to crave it. Once the ice had completely melted away and John settled into his life with Sherlock, he found himself protecting Sherlock again and again in order to keep that fire nearby.
John stared at his bed in dismay. He wasn’t sure he could sneak another set of bed linens past Mrs. Hudson and goodness knows what she would think. If he was lucky, she’d leave it at nothing more than raised eyebrows and an exaggerated wink.
When John’s body physically reaches the age of thirty, he considers it a minor miracle. He treats it exactly as such things deserve, by having a few glasses of scotch to toast the empty air of his flat. He looks around and sighs. His lethargic lack of purpose after his last sneeze jump continued to weigh on him, even now. He was thirty today. He just felt empty. He felt like the ice was no longer merely inhabiting his veins. He felt like his entire being was made of ice, like his limbs and flesh were coated with it. A dull, heavy ice that nobody would call pretty wonderful, simply annoying and…there.
"Good boy," he groans, before he can catch the endearment. He doubts John would enjoy that particular pet name, but he hasn't seemed to notice. Sherlock, in the meantime, has stretched John to a very acceptable level.
He ducks under the yellow tape and hears a sharp female voice call out, "What are you doing here, Freak?"
“Oh? Are you sure there weren’t any other things of note to discuss?”
“Alright,” Mary nodded, “did you want me to come too?”
He could still manage this. A warmth charm and a minor illusion were easy enough to craft. John didn’t need to know.
"Close to six months, I think." It's hard to tell. From the time he'd been in his cell, to the 'box', and to Sherlock's suite, he hadn't had access to a calender until Baker Street. By then, he'd forgotten the exact date of when they'd met.
John sucked in a breath, but did nothing else. Sherlock just lightly traced the soft skin, preserving this moment forever in his hard drive. Reluctantly, John could feel heat pooling in his groin at Sherlock's teasing touches. Sherlock took his eyes from his own hand to watch John's face. Still gripping his hair, Sherlock turned John to get a better view. John's eyes were closed, denying himself with the stubbornness that was just as much a part of John as his bone structure. When John's member had slightly stiffened, Sherlock gripped it blindly. Slowly, he began stroking.
Sherlock is so pleased by that he thrusts harder.
Well, that was good, because John wasn’t able to stop himself.
Both men alternate their thrusts in and out of his body, and everything becomes a white haze of pleasure to John. All he knows is their heat, deep inside of him, permeating his skin. Even the sharp edge of orgasm has faded, and John is lost in the contentedness of giving these two what they want. And what they want is him. The easiest gift he can give.
His thighs kept John’s hips still, while his long fingers easily kept John’s wrists pinned above him. Sherlock highly doubted that John really wanted to escape. John’s eyes were wide and dark with unexpected arousal, and the tiny shifts of his hips was for seeking friction, not leverage. But Sherlock enjoyed the base pleasure of asserting his authority. He watched the boy’s tongue dart out to wet his lips. And saw how John’s breath quickened with lust and realization over his own helplessness.
“I think you will agree to my rather lax and generous terms, before I leave this office to depart for the next train, Doctor Watson.”
At first, John was foolish enough to think it was coincidence. Excuses like rabid predators and drought turning everything to kindling was much easier to deal with than the cold chill that John felt when he’d first heard about the incidences.
John finally turned around at that, and cupped Sherlock’s angular cheek in his hand as he said, “There’s nothing wrong with your character.”
Instead, Sherlock lay down beside the boy, moving him over to make room for Sherlock’s much longer legs and far wider chest. John could only half heartedly protest, too exhausted for anything else, “Don’t you have your own room?”
Sherlock moaned from the thought. He moved down John’s chest to the nipples he’d been rubbing, licking one into his mouth. He felt as though he should thank John in some way. As if stimulation was the only way for Sherlock to fully express his gratitude in seeing John captured moment by moment.
Sherlock.
Like being pricked with a needle, John recalled fever and a weakness so thorough his limbs became useless hunks of flesh and bone. The rest was clouded with obscurity. But he’d been incapacitated, possibly even delirious.
While John wanted to believe that a group of teenagers, no matter how stupid their chosen extracurriculars, wouldn’t resort to outright murder, there was no denying the bloodthirsty look in Gary’s face, or the way the others jumped up from their seats to comply.
He looked up at Sherlock again, who hadn’t lost his pleased expression, and couldn’t stop the giggle muffled around his food.
Sherlock’s fingers, for they must have been his, curled inside of John. He feebly arched his back, his limbs inexplicably lax and unresponsive.
“After all,” Moriarty pressed, his eyes gleaming with a dark temptation that even Lucifer would have envied, “it’s not as though he’ll be able to recall any of it.”
He let the words hang between them, unsaid. It felt wrong to say them out loud. He didn’t even know why he was mentioning this. John could have made a huge mistake. Maybe talking about it would make their interactions seem sordid, which would cause Sherlock to become uncomfortable, and then he would never want to talk with John again.
“Ah, there he is, joining us in the fun,” Jim cooed. He spread his fingers inside of John’s body and watched as the muscles in his back twitched. “Don’t you want to participate Sherlock? You enjoyed yourself last night.”
The idea is frankly absurd. If he hasn't cracked from all of this, he's not going to weep from a damned missing chair. John heads to the sofa to eat, when he finally spots the difference in his cell. It had been niggling at the back of his mind, but John had passed it off as anxiousness. The straps on the bed are gone. Now, it's a simple single bed with white sheets and a pillow.
John shakes his head. He can't articulate why he doesn't want new clothes. But the explanation slugs through his drugged mind. The pajamas were the only thing he had to remind him of his previous life. A boring life it might have been, but it was his. He was free. And Sherlock is going to take away the only link he had to that. His thoughts are dragged back to his current situation, when Sherlock delicately runs his fingers across his scar.
John sighs, and sinks onto his roof in dejection. It's not like he wishes anything bad to happen, but the nightmare has been replaying in his head no matter how many times he tries to ignore it. He just wants to take out some of this helpless frustration on
John couldn’t stand the thought of being angry with him after that. He proceeded to assist Sherlock in his own undressing. Soon they were two heated bodies twisted together atop the sheets. Sherlock pulled away to get the vaseline they stored in their nightstand.
Sherlock looks calmly back towards him, and the indifferent expression furthers John's rage. "I'll kill you!" John swears, ignoring the warning bells in his head that try to tell him that this is probably the last thing he should say to this psychopath, "I'll fucking kill you I promise!"
John’s fingers curled into the sheets to help him hold onto sense. Sherlock’s own hands wriggled underneath to clasp him close. John was now completely captured by the heat and weight of two human bodies.
No. That was entirely...Sherlock looked back over to the camera. Ignoring the looks, Sherlock strode back and forth in front of it. Predictably, the camera followed his every move.
Defiance and fear wage an equal battle in his chest. His jaw barely clenches before Sherlock continues talking.
“Won’t they see us if someone goes to the bathroom?” John asked.
John sighed deeply before he tossed his spoon into the sink and gulped down coffee that was barely below scalding. He dumped the rest of it down the drain, and made sure to rinse out the coffee pot before heading out the door.
It sticks halfway out, twitching with the rate of John’s pulse. John glances at it, and he makes a pleading sound.
John closed his eyes for a moment to gather his bravery. It was buried somewhere underneath his crumbled ethics.
“Not at all. It’s always the persistent little problems that are the most aggravating Johnny, remember that when you practice medicine with undeserving laymen. Now what caused you to arise at this ungodly hour?”
The master criminal typed silently away at his computer. Controlling thousands, if not millions, of lives with a single click of his mouse. After several minutes, the man looked up, not even bothering to act surprised that Seb was there.
John’s heart fluttered as he stepped back. “Yes,” John stammered, “I suppose that would allow for some-I mean- I think I have confused you on the definition of-”
“Sherlock, do you really need me to explain that to you?”
“Mm, you were right John, it is worth it.” Sherlock’s voice rolled through John to settle somewhere in his stomach. “A pity there isn’t much more.”
Gentle. Sherlock is being gentle.
“Erm,” John hesitated to bring this up, “in the spirit of honesty, you should know something else.”
Comprehension was the spike that was nailed simultaneously into John’s heart and brain. Jim said, “I usually don’t like getting my hands dirty, but in her case, it was a pleasure.” He crooned the last word. The familiarity slithered into John’s ear.
ridiculous, where did that thought come from?
Ten minutes. John could wait for ten minutes. After that, he’d cause a distraction, and give Sherlock enough time to get away or grab the evidence he needed.
John’s grin didn’t falter for a moment. “Be thankful I got us a towel at all. I would have gladly left you in your own filth and gone to sleep, but I want to remove the sheets from my body in the morning without taking my skin with it.”
“Mary,” John tried, “I’m really sorry--”
John only knew that whatever Sherlock had planned would prevent him from leaving the mountain permanently. With the remembered sensation of fangs grazing his legs, John reached for the lip of the cave’s ceiling.
He leaned away, and John couldn’t stop the moan of protest. The dragon smirked down at him. He grabbed one of the many bottles he had wedged along the side of the bed pit. He placed it firmly in John’s hand as he commanded, “Prepare yourself.”
But this had been too close for Sherlock’s liking. Far too close. He remembered crackling light that had killed dozens, laced with the intention to kill two more. He could still see her face, contorted into a crazed grimace as her milky white eyes had stared at John as he fled for cover.
The fingers stopped moving. John heard soft but passionate swearing above his head. He felt Sherlock’s forehead, hot and sticky with sweat, press against the back of his shoulder.
As John scrapes away the semen crusted to his thighs, he desperately wishes for soap. Or lye. Preferably acid. Stop it, he tells himself. Self harm isn't needed here. He's not stuck in his flat being chased to madness by his own boredom. He's a prisoner, he can get out of this. He has a physical enemy that he can fight against.
Sherlock moves the toy in and out of John, and somehow that's worse. Now, John is stuck between relief and blinding pleasure. His prostate is beyond sensitive, and he can't get hard again. Not this soon. John's just left to writhe, unable to get away from the onslaught. The vibration isn't even that powerful, but if Sherlock decides to turn it up, John's done for.
He waited for John's shift to end, then set himself up by the door that John always left from. The plan was to walk into John, acting like he had business elsewhere and had just happened to show up. That was the plan, but it was completely derailed when he was accosted by a gun pressed to the small of his back. A voice addressed him intently, and by the position of the gun and direction of the voice, his assailant was approximately seven inches shorter than him. "You are going to calmly walk to the alley to the left, and if you make any attempt at getting noticed, I will shoot you through the spinal cord."
Ever since he’d seen their dead father’s face literally at the bottom of a whisky bottle, Harry didn’t dismiss it as an odd manifestation grief. Both agreed to keep quiet about lest he ended up on the wrong side of Bedlam.
A look of fondness came over Jim's expression, and he leaned back in his chair as he looked at his pet.
“I told you John, they only wanted you when you were useful to them,” Sherlock was close enough to touch. He trailed his claws down John’s cheek. “All I had to do was make sure you were far more dangerous to keep around than to send away. Do you see how fickle humans are with the things that should matter the most to them? Because I can assure you John,” the claws pinched John’s chin, tilting his head up so he could gaze directly into Sherlock’s reptilian eyes, “no matter the levels of chaos inflicted upon me or others, I would have
John hears the sound of fastenings being freed, and the rustle of cloth down skin. Then he’s being pulled backward and up. There’s a dizzying sensation as the blood rushes down from his head, followed by a stab of unexpected pleasure when Sherlock positions him to sit on his cock.
The ride back to Baker Street is filled with silence. John was still reeling from his initiation of the kiss, and Sherlock’s assessment of his character. John tries to tell himself over and over again that it wasn’t true. He didn’t live for this, didn’t crave this lifestyle of constant fear and anxiety. He couldn’t possibly find enjoyment out of living like his feet were strapped to land mines.
She nodded at the door, “He’s in here. Last I saw he was pretty out of it so try not to disturb him too much. If you need me, my name is Janine.”
. With a shuddering jerk and a tiny cry, he spills himself into his boxers. There's a heavy stillness while John breathes his way back to sensibility. Jim licks the love bite adoringly. There's going to be a very vivid bruise right on the top of his shoulder come morning. Jim should ask John to take a picture and send it to his phone.
“I promised I’d take care of you John, and I will. From now until the end of our days.”
Flight. Heights. Oh,
Not that John thought he could do much good there anyway. Doubtless they had found an even more secluded hiding spot for the keys that led into the area of interest. So Sherlock and John both sat in silence, with the oppressive air of all that remained unspoken crushing them both.
"Up, John. Sit up on your knees if you want to have some relief." John complies, though it is a difficult order. His eyes are closed, and his breath is coming out in stutters. He still can't think past the burning that comes trickling from his stomach, up through his chest, and into his brain. Sherlock's hand comes back to run through his hair, and John moans. His head rolls back with the motion like an attention starved puppy.
“Teaching you a lesson,” Sherlock responded. He stared John down with eyes that held no hint of mercy. “I’ll have to cauterize the wounds immediately so you don’t bleed out. This will hurt, so I’d advise giving in to the urge to faint.”
“Put him to work with me,” Sherlock continued, “and I’ll give him a good sum of money each lunar passing. He’ll more than likely pay off his father’s debts and begin to accumulate his own wages in, oh, three years?”
It felt like failure.
Relief pulsed through him, more soporific than any infusion he had used to cure the nightmares after his return from war. He tensed again when Sherlock’s face came close to his. “I need to take care of something.
When Sherlock moves up to his neck, John tilts his head back for better access. The smooth sensation over his stinging skin makes John unwillingly closes his eyes. Distantly, he thinks about how easy it would be for Sherlock to close his hands and choke him to death. John doesn't dare to dwell on why that doesn't bother him.
John looked utterly wrecked. He looked debauched, dazed, and almost delirious. His blue eyes were glazed over, seemingly unable to look away from their ceiling. His blond hair was ruffled, either from tossing against the pillow or from gripping it with his fingers, Sherlock couldn’t tell. But he would know. A rosy flush had spread from John’s cheeks to dust across his chest. Shallow breaths expanded his bitten and bruised skin like living artwork.
John didn’t think there had been a dream, but there was an unsettling sensation of wriggling that refused to leave his body. He finally caught the last of Sherlock’s words and looked up in apprehension, “What do you mean?”
“What did you touch?” Moriarty asked in a dark voice John had never heard before. His hand was slammed onto the wall once more, “What did you see?” Jim yelled the question in John’s face.
"Which is why, thanks to his pleadings," Holmes said wryly,"I am allowing you to make up your grade."
Molly’s smile quickly vanished, “Wait you—you mean you don’t know?”
John arched underneath in a blaze of relief and adrenaline turned to arousal.
Sherlock rubs the scar one last time, and puts the sock on. The shoes go on next, and there's no odd sudden reverence there, thank Christ. But now the air is charged with an odd tension. It's not like Sherlock to stop, with pain or pleasure, regardless if there's dinner plans waiting or not. Which is a load of bollocks anyway. Sherlock could buy, threaten, or blackmail an entire chain to do his bidding all with a few quick taps from his Blackberry. But stop Sherlock does, and he pulls John up to stand when his phone gives a small chime.
"Not really, but if it will ease your mind," Sherlock grabs John under his arms, easily lifts him up and swings him around so John is sitting on the desk. The back of John's legs collide painfully with the surface and John lets out an irate, "Hey!", before he's being kissed again.
“No! I mean, yes! Yes you do have to explain yourself! My lord!”
“Shame you didn’t bring it with you,” John said, “I would have loved to hear it.”
Before the boy stepped away, stunned by the rapid change, he managed to remember something.
“But I will. I promise you, I will protect you this time.”
John slid his free hand down to his cock. He took it in hand, and it felt like an electric current. He couldn’t remember being this eager and hard before. He stroked once, twice, and felt everything below his navel tense in anticipation.
, he has such a clever tongue."
But the gargoyle merely shrugs, "Bit of both I suppose. I tried once. But you humans change things so constantly it's a wonder you don't get lost trying to go down the street."
He noticed Sherlock had been staring at him hopefully. Apparently catching John literally with his trousers down had done nothing to deter him from wanting to spend some time together. John sighed, and tried to ignore the expression spreading across Sherlock’s face that looked an awful lot like smug triumph.
"Do you know what his fellow comrades called Sebby? His infamous nickname?"
"Well I mean, even by gargoyle standards, I'd be pushing it a bit if I were that age. I'm closer to a hundred, when all is said and done."
“Something similar,” John allowed. Sherlock said nothing, merely waited in patience for John to either elaborate or shift the topic to something else. John was too tired to try and conceal this from his husband, who had been nothing but attentive at his bedside while he lay ill.
“Right, I forgot, mandatory bodily demands are beneath you,” John dryly says. He takes a sip of his champagne to prevent himself from saying something else.
Sherlock spat out his apple bite so he could have the room to laugh. “Oh, yes, certainly. That’s what I want to do with my life. Join a career that’s filled with busywork, red tape, ridicule, and at best chasing an idiot who couldn’t outrun or outsmart the
John was so startled that he let go of the cloth and stepped back. Sherlock, with all of the fluid grace of a cat, sat up and removed it from his face.
Sherlock flopped down into his seat, not bothering to look over the menu. Minutes passed in tense silence, both brothers waiting for the other to start speaking. Everything was always a contest between the two of them. The wait staff were practically beside themselves, too cowed to approach the table. They could feel the unspoken challenge permeate the air around the pair. Sherlock drummed his fingers across the tabletop, sighing and flickering his eyes over the window. The ice in the water glasses clinked delicately. Mycroft's last snap of the watch was the final straw.
With the wrist still captive under his mouth, Sherlock glances up at John through dark lashes. The man has not taken his eyes off of him, stonily watching as Sherlock has lavished his arm with nips and licks. The sight of those steadfast eyes is the most addictive thing Sherlock can think of.
John couldn’t even muster a slight tinge of remorse when he kicked the downed man hard in the groin. The knife wielder regained his wits, but not enough of them to give him much sense, as he tried to jump over the whimpering man to get at John.
“John? What is it?”
For all he knows, the creature could just be insanely vain, or this is a hobby to pass the time.
John began to wonder anew if his time jumps were linked to having a particular task to fulfil. He began to wonder if he needed to play it safe or if being a time traveller lent him a sort of invincibility from everything, even delaying old age beyond the scope of what John considered normal. He was a fifty year old man; living in the prime of life in a thirty year old’s body.
When he reached the final one, addressed to ‘Sherlock W. Holmes’ and ‘John H. Watson’, he cramped his jaw to keep back the wrenching scream. This sheaf contained more than just his signature to sign away his inheritance and, unwittingly, his soul.
Stop. Just stop.
To his shame, he felt the hot prickle of tears at the back of his eyes. Denial swarmed him, screaming from some place that felt as though it would wither and die if his conclusions were true.
John squirmed for a moment, then stopped himself. He inhaled deeply while shutting his eyes. When he opened them, defiance shone through past the fog of lust. "Piss. Off." Would John ever cease to surprise him? Sherlock dearly hoped not.
He flopped over onto his back. As he licked his lips, he was struck by how dry his throat and mouth felt. It was a good job Sherlock was not here to kiss him awake, as his mouth tasted foul. Since no one was around to hear it, John groaned as he sat up to reach for the pitcher and glass on his nightstand.
He turned his head and shouted, “Sherlock! Grab the rope when you’ve caught your breath.”
The sound of the satin sliding free is much louder than it has any right to be. Instead of pulling it off and hanging it, Sherlock begins to flick open John’s shirt buttons.
"Listen," he adopts the most apologetic tone he can, and it's sincere, "this is going to sound weird, but my boyfriend does have some self-confidence issues. He's getting over a pretty bad break-up, and he might not take too well to, well, you know." He rubs the back of his head, playing up the shy.
Sherlock's hand grips him firmly behind his neck, and pulls him back into a kiss. The lust is now dampened with fear, and both men notice the sudden stiffness in his body. With small swipe of his tongue over John's lips, Sherlock says in the opposite ear, "Hush, John. It's alright. We're not going to hurt you."
“You. Standing up to my brother.”
Sherlock’s snort of disdain sounded the same as when he was a dragon, but he complied with John’s request. “I don’t understand your modesty,” he said with a twinge of annoyance, “I don’t wear garments as a dragon, and taking on the shape of a man doesn’t change what I am.”
Mary nodded absently, clearly already thinking about something else. “I think we should invite him over sometime for dinner. You said he’s bored here already yeah? I’m sure you’re right, and he just needs some friendly faces to talk to.”
“You’re going to pay for that, little aristrocrat,” the man snarled.
He jumps across, and the impact shakes the foundation of the building he lands on. The boarded up windows could mean it's empty, or just occupied by people that don't have access to phones. He hopes it's the former, he doesn't need people coming out to inspect all of the ruckus.
She pushed a lock of hair behind her ear and said, “Well, I’d better, uh, go find some way to make myself busy, before I put my foot in it again.”
Jim huffed in disbelief. “Well I haven’t heard anything and I’ve been traipsing through this place seeking you. There’s no way an animal could have burrowed in Johnny, there’s well-laid brick surrounding the foundation, specifically to deter pests.”
The man blinks again and says, "Sebastian. But I'd prefer it if you called me Moran if we meet alone again." By his tone, Moran highly doubts this will happen. John's inclined to agree.
His response is John finally pulling his head away from his arm. He's staring at the wall now, resolute and ever silent. Sherlock had really wanted to see John's expressions, but the stool had been the best option he had. Borrowing from Jim was unpleasant, but he didn't have anything on hand to suit his purposes. The promise of next time was quickly becoming his mantra.
Molly nodded and quickly left with her things. Despite her statement of not having been involved with Sherlock’s plan, John was sure she was just as tired from the attention as he was.
Sherlock's lips pull back into a simile of a smile, "Hello Sergeant Donovan. As always, I'm here for you to make my day a little brighter. Your attempts at intelligence are always amusing."
“Yes,” Sherlock slowly said, as if he really was just realizing that fact himself, “you are.”
“Oh, you know,” the keeper waved his hand vaguely, “provide the means for decent work, coin to fix the buildings when disaster strikes, that sort of thing.”
“Is something amiss Johnny?” Moriarty called out from the end of the line. John spun around to stare at the pair in disbelief. They only regarded him with either curiosity or deep sympathy. John saw the concern from Molly, and the carefully neutral regard from Lestrade.
The worst part was, he didn’t feel like he regretted any of it.
Sherlock greedily soaks in how John’s flush of shame is darker than his tones of arousal, how John’s insides turn warmer, and how lax his body becomes when John fully accepts that he can’t stop what Sherlock has set in motion.
Then he remembered something important. “You do realize that the only reason we had to run in the first place is because you threw a temper tantrum though, right?”
John did not believe him. He tried to come over to Sherlock’s house, under the pretense of bringing some sleep aids, but Sherlock didn’t answer the door even though his lights were on.
His and Mary’s relationship coming to ruins was such a long time coming, that having it out in the open had shunted all of the stress into his leg. Now that he had slept it off, it was no longer a weight for him to bear. It seemed as good a reason as any.
“Are we not?” the dragon frankly asked. He stepped towards John, maintaining the same fluid grace he possessed when he was far larger. “I’ve just shown you a form that could lead to my ruin if others were to know of it. If shedding your clothes is supposed to be equivalent to that level of vulnerability, wouldn’t that make us intimate now?”
As if Holmes would take pity on him for having an actual head injury. Hah.
, with enough force to split the cavity up to the sternum. By the frayed edges of skin, it was with something incredibly sharp and slightly separated. In fact, Sherlock splays his hand slightly away from the body, and his eyes widen. The rips correlate with the spacing of a human hand. Albeit, a very, very large human hand.
“…Okay. I’m not saying that you’re in. But we’ll go for a trial run for a while. Make sure you can stand up to the demands without falling over. We’ll give you pay, and occasionally, even a bit of the wares.” He leaned forward again, his expression serious in its capacity for cruelty, “If, however, I find out this was all just a little fib to snatch up as many goods as you could get your hands on, then there’s not a damned place you could go where we wouldn’t hunt you the fuck down.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Yes, I saw through the door viewer. Now why are, uh, you here,” he mocked.
“Wait here,” John ordered before he closed the door.
His eyes are still wide open when Sherlock smashes their lips together. John's hands fly from the sink to grip onto Sherlock's head and shoulders. John doesn't know what this means, if he's won or this is just some strange attempt at a diversion, but John gives as well as he gets. His tongue fights for dominance in Sherlock's mouth. He's far from the submissive man he was two nights ago.
“Orchestra.” Sherlock picked at the paper of the table. “Or what passes for it in this wretched school anyway.”
Phrases like ‘Apply pressure and K will buckle, bring up wife-JM’ or ‘The cousin is in massive debt, he can be reasoned with – SH’ showed up in telegram after telegram. Dread crept up John’s back with clinging spider legs. He had never pressed for much information about his husband’s work. All he knew was that they were prominent business consultants, overseeing countless projects when companies ran into issues that needed creative solving.
John stills. He waits with a steady hand clenched around his utensil.
for you otherwise." The two lock eyes, staring each other down. Icy, forced indifference meets with triumphant blue.
“…My lord?” John asked when Sherlock remained quiet by his door, “Is there…something I can help you with?”
Sherlock’s silent, then he rolls the word off of his tongue, “John.”
“God you were such a brilliant actor. I could’ve sworn you had switched with a doppelganger when you walked into the light.”
"What?" Sherlock demands. Which just makes John dissolve into more giggles.
He does his daily routine with more vigor, still thinking of ways to escape. He likes his seducing plan, but what's the endgame?
“What? Prepare? Sherlock, it’s just dinner. You don’t have to--”
He ducks his head back down to his test when Mr.Holmes sharply looks up from his reading. John resolutely tells himself that he's not going to look up anymore, that he's going to get this damned thing finished. He looks up at the clock and winces. He's barely halfway through and he only has half an hour to spare.
He tossed the body away from himself, where it landed in a heap along the road. John crouched low, ready to rush the second man who was slowly lumbering upwards, but halted when the man held his hands out in surrender.
Sherlock’s words rang like a tolling bell in John’s mind. It wasn’t like a warning, more like an announcement. Here lies the last remains of John’s hopes that Sherlock was wrong. The cynical thought tasted like blood, but it was only John biting the inside of his cheek.
It's a short one, because John realized he was doing it two seconds after his vocal chords rang out. Sherlock becomes irrationally angry that John is hiding sounds from him at this moment, so he bites harder.
Before he could reach for Sherlock again, his wrist was caught, and brought down his own trousers. The familiar sensation of his own hand on his member, but being directed by another man, was alluringly erotic.
John makes a sound like he’s being tenderly eviscerated. Sherlock is so enraptured by that noise he compels John to do it again by twisting the sound in tiny circles and random stop-start motions.
An auburn eyebrow raised itself to declare how unimpressed it was with that excuse.
There was the pop of a bottle being opened, and then the rather ridiculous sound of a viscous fluid being pushed out of a tube. John nearly laughed at that, but he jolted instead when he felt a slick and bony finger pressing against his hole.
John had started to comply but Sherlock put a hand on his shoulder. “That won’t be necessary officer,” Sherlock said in an assured tone. John was beginning to suspect that there was a very real chance that this kid would be the death of him someday.
“We should go. Coming here was a mistake.” Sherlock’s hands were curled into small fists on the table.
The steel painted vine green and the reflective glass were a stark counterpoint to the mansion’s dark wood and stone steps. Inside, a tropical array of flowers flourished while the outside world was still caught in the dead of winter.
John can only stare. His brain can only manage stutters of "Not happening. Is this real? Does he like me too? Did I trip and die on the stairs and this is my heaven?" Then his mind completely whites out when the man leans forward and kisses him soundly on the mouth.
John dully cracks the chocolate and watches the meticulous formation splinter to land in the white mousse. He’s eaten about three bites before he manages to mutter, “Turned out to be pointless. All of that work, I mean.”
“He suggested as much when we fought,” John said, “and I’m still shocked at his selfishness.”
Sherlock pulls back, achingly hard. His body screams at him to continue, to complete the last few thrusts that would finish the job. But he's not going to come into John's mouth tonight.
John watches his hand curl up into a fist. It wouldn’t matter either way, he tells himself. The language of the obsession doesn’t change the fact that Sherlock’s dangerously overzealous.
John didn’t have an answer for him. He wanted to, he desperately searched himself for a mature and logical response to that question. But he couldn’t find anything suitable. Everything he thought of utterly failed to express how much he wished—
Sherlock nodded, and kept his eyes meekly on the floor. Snow slapped his hands on the table in fake joviality, “Right then, let’s talk in my office. I can think of a few grunt jobs you could do where a rail thin nobody like you would go unquestioned. The rest of these shits are too posh for it.”
Sherlock thought,
“I—what? No. I said I would do it for free.”
His long fingers trailed down John’s neck. John shivered from the rise of gooseflesh, although he couldn’t decide if it was from the clinging chill on his skin or anticipation. Sherlock quickly unbuttoned the front of John’s shirt and pulled it off of him without preamble.
A picture is starting to form in his head, and it becomes crystal clear when a dollop of cold lube is placed directly on the head of his penis. John can't stop the small "Don't," that escapes his lips. Or his legs from backing away just to be stopped by the wall of the the box against his calves. Sherlock moves forward on his knees, and grips John's arse painfully. John hisses from the sudden pain, and the message is received loud and clear. Don't move again.
“You said you wanted to help,” Sherlock said as he tossed the white cream into the same bin as the drugs. “I’m asking for it. Meet me in my hospital room tonight and I’ll explain everything. And bring your gun.”
He was slightly later than the ringing of the first period, which meant he blessedly didn’t have to make small talk in the teacher’s lounge. He doubted he’d be brought up for arriving later than any other teacher in the building, since most kids didn’t get ‘sick’ until at least midday.
do dirty work. I also smoothed out any flaws present in the plan to reveal a prized aspect that not even dear Sherlock was aware of. I did all of this, and therefore, I argue, I also have a great deal invested in this project and it is just as much mine as it is his. We were wondering if you could aid us in settling who has more right to the project by virtue of your objective opinion.”
He struggled to come up with a good excuse for Mary. This had been the first time in a long time that they had been intimate, but John felt like Sherlock deserved some company after all that he had done.
Mary knocked on the kitchen door. John opened it and smiled in apology.
A nattering part of him wondered why Sherlock bothered to include the detail of his safety. He shut it up in irritation, too tired and sick with confusion to bother adding to his anxieties.
John went very still. He kept his phone aimed at the conversation, but his other hand curled over his weapon.
Sherlock goes back to looking angry, and his hands clench painfully on John's shoulders. ""What about her?"
As Gary and some other boy hefted Sherlock between them none too gently, John tensed again. None of them seemed to be carrying a firearm, but a well-placed switchblade could do fatal damage in minutes. He wouldn’t be able to spot it from this distance until it was too late. John’s fingers twitched over the handle of his gun.
John didn’t have a response to that. He just smiled, and felt his steps become slightly lighter. When he glanced at Sherlock, they were sharing the same smile.
John's head snaps back up. Wait, what?
A common misconception of foretelling is that it’s unavoidable. Somehow, mapping a person’s likely future with Tarot cards or bone throws becomes the only
Jim stroked a hand down John’s face, and John tried to dislodge it. Moriarty only chuckled, “Oh, none of that John. You’re going to have to get used to such things from now on. We’re the only two people in this whole world you can turn to. After all,” he leaned in close, as if they were sharing a personal secret, “you’re officially insane.”
"Nonsense," Sherlock says, almost ready to shove him inside of the flat, or at least give it a good try. For a creature that can eviscerate a dozen armed thugs, he's incredibly bashful about his own presence.
“I appreciate your concern, but I believe we should get moving.” Sherlock hastily whispered as he tugged John after him. Soon, they were running side by side.
John laughed, “You both continue to surprise me. In your hobbies and your intellect.”
John looked up and smirked. “Yeah, fair enough. Thanks for indulging me while you could.”
Sherlock slipped two fingers inside of John during Jim’s speech. John’s body refused to cooperate when he instructed it to kick the man away. Jim continued to speak while Sherlock stretched him.
For a moment it was so much like his sister was there in front of him, that his heart cracked with remembering that she wasn’t. “I mean, what is here that cannot be gotten from the plants?”
John swallowed, but his mouth remained dry. “I-I wasn’t,” John tried again, “I wasn’t spying on you.”
Smiling like a skull at the thought, Sherlock presses a kiss against the underside of John’s ear and whispers, “Happy anniversary John.”
Sherlock grins. Time to begin the hunt.
Nothing was adding up.
John becomes breathless again at the last thought. He opens his eyes, searching Sherlock’s as if for an answer to the unexpected impulse.
He worries about the padlock. He has his tools with him of course, but they won't do any good against the rusted and possibly disintegrated gears. He grasps it and pulls down to test its durability, and it unlatches easily in his hand. Sherlock nearly crows in delight.
Which is brilliant. More people means more avenues of escape. John would try to flag down a cab, but there are no cars passing him on the street. There's barely anyone around at all. John wonders what time it could possibly be to make London so stagnant.
John’s eyes lock onto Sherlock’s in their reflection. He slowly shook his head, even though John wasn’t entirely sure what he was denying.
“You’re right,” she said in that brushing silk whisper, “there are rules, even in Death, we must adhere to. I believed Them. But while I was living, when was I ever one who followed the will of another?” With her veil in place as a gentle barrier, she brushed her exposed teeth against John’s forehead in a pitiful facsimile of a familial kiss. “Follow me John, bring your night candle, and I shall show you the truth.”
John didn’t stifle his laugh. “Never mind. Shouldn’t you be in class?”
His brother was still in need of one. And suddenly vicious suspicion and greed stabbed through Sherlock’s mind. He wouldn’t let Mycroft lay his fat fingers on this one.
She’d often reply, “Probably wander around London like a limping puppy until I finally found you.” He’d laugh, retort with something playfully protesting or mildly self-deprecating, and then kiss her.
“Any other brilliant plans?” John asked. He saw two boys up ahead, who must have been tasked with guarding the regular entrance. They took notice of the commotion, and started to run in their direction.
He crept out as carefully as he previously had, his nerves strung even tighter than before. The stairs invited discovery, so he hurried down those. He knew they were too well kept to creak or groan under his weight. He felt exposed in the sparse entrance, where minimal decoration and open space spoke of grandeur more eloquently than cluttered luxuries. John wondered when such a lovely place had become a warzone that he must tread through.
His fingers are clutching the ends of the armrests. John can feel the strain on his muscles from his extended position on his toes. Small tremors are shooting over his body, and his mouth is dry either from the drugs or the panting. He feels so full, while being so exposed, he feels fucking filthy and debauched, and he has never been so turned on in his life. Before this ends, John thinks, he'll have Sherlock's head on a fucking spike.
Even with all of Sherlock's preparation, the vibrator is large, and John can feel it all along his walls as it pushes in. It doesn't hurt, but it's unyielding, and John really isn't looking forward to when this thing is turned on.
She smiled a little hesitantly, “Well, one of my coworkers, Janine, got tickets to the London Medical Conference, but her date cancelled at the last second. I thought it would be a nice vacation. We can rent a separate room and stay a little longer than the conference days. We could see the sights, make ourselves into proper tourists. Except we actually know all of the good places to eat. What do you think?”
John falls into a fitful sleep, ignoring the ache and dampness in his backside, and the bruises starting to form along his arms. When John dreams, it's of blistering winds, blinding sun, and the roar of gunfire and the scent of blood. He jerks awake to the hated color of white. John suddenly misses his forgotten reality so much he nearly cries.
"John, I've seen the footage before you put on the clothes. I know that your rectum is the area that you've wounded the most, and you're much more likely to get an infection if it isn't treated. So stop being childish and let me handle it."
Snow slowly began to look satisfied and smug. Gary looked like he was about to swallow his own tongue.
Then he remembered that there was an alchemist within the town. Not a physician by any means but the closest one could call upon for an emergency this far from civilization. She specialized in herbal remedies. If anyone, aside from Moriarty and Sherlock, could identify the properties, it would be Ms. Hooper.
He goes back in, cupping John's jaw and rubbing small circles with his thumb. Predictably, John goes boneless and moans into his mouth. Jim opens his eyes to look at Sherlock, who's remained surprisingly quiet during this whole exchange. He's standing there, avidly watching as John comes apart under Jim's lips. Now the man knows how it feels to watch from the outside. It's utterly fascinating, seeing him enjoy the attentions of someone else, to watch him be plucked apart from the simple nerves in his mouth and tongue. Although, Jim enjoys the hands on approach considerably more.
John hummed noncommittally. He felt like more than a bit of a prick for blocking her attempts at conversation, but as much as he didn’t want to talk about his life, there also wasn’t very much to say.
He's done his exercises three times, he's ran backwards. He's bathed himself so many times he's practically raw. The sweat from his workout had irritated the scratches to an unbearable extent, and John had let that distract him for a bit. Then he began naming off all of the bones in the human body, starting with the toes and working his way up. When he was done with that, he tried recalling the separate sections of the human brain and what function each served. Neurology had never been his strong suite. John had tried counting the tiles on the walls, but staring at the spotless white seemed to make things worse.
“You know what? Never mind, it isn’t important,” John said at the same time Sherlock went, “He suggested you and I were lovers.”
Mary’s call ahead turned out to be a huge help, as they led him to Sherlock’s room once John said his name. “Mary’s a godsend around here,” the nurse said, “and we’d be monsters if we kept this kid away from the only guardian he’s got right now.”
“But a virgin Omega as your research assistant? I asked you to attend in order to
“That’s it,” Sherlock encourages when John’s breathing begins to smooth out. The hand on his arm leads him to the side. They step forward, and the faint scratchy sound of music tells him they’re on the lift. He’d been so far gone he hadn’t even heard the ring.
John gave himself a moment to reflect on how strange his new husband and housemate were. Genius was often paired with eccentricity he supposed. Lord knew that the both of them could outsmart the Devil if it ever became an option.
"Yeah, yeah alright just give me a moment okay? I'm coming down." Sherlock knows from experience that it takes two minutes at a brisk pace down the steps. And John will take the steps, he won't trust an elevator if Sherlock is obviously pressed for time. It takes John one and a half minutes. And by the way he's smoothing out the back of his pajamas, there was a fifteen second delay in which he grabbed his gun and put on his shoes.
John knew she meant it in a good-natured way. Mary had always expressed herself in the most honest way possible, and came off sounding a little brusque for it occasionally. Still, the implication of Sherlock’s intelligence being seen as a party trick or an odd quirk prickled at his skin like a scratchy sweater.
John felt like he had been staring for too long. He looked forward, where he could pretend that if he tilted forward a little too far, he could fall straight off the edge of the Earth and plummet into a world of velvet and diamonds.
He needs out.
“I love you.”
“Huh?”
Sherlock pantomimes a wide yawn, lifts up his arms, and drapes them over the sofa behind John.
Thunder cracks like a schoolmarm snapping a ruler, aghast at his effrontery. With a wave of his hand and a sharp word, the living room is bubbled in silence.
The fireplace flames crackled behind him. Without thinking, John tried to reach for the glowing ash. A chorus of alarm erupted behind him, and Lestrade pulled him away before he could even graze the fire grate.
John falls on his hands with a soft, pained 'ah' escaping his lips. The pyre roars back, and John shudders in pain. "There are a few things mixed in of my own design. Call it a home recipe," Sherlock mocks as he twists the computer chair around to sit down. His feet extend to widely splay his legs in a provocative manner. The erection in his trousers is brought in to stark view from the pull of the fabric.  He smirks, like a tyrannical ruler on a throne, while John fights the urge to writhe on the floor.
The smile freezes on Sherlock’s face. John doesn't dare look away. There’s a time and a place for submission, a lesson John has learned through sweat, blood, and tears. Doing so now is begging for the wolf to tear out his throat.
It’s John’s turn to snort, “Yes, well, please forever leave me out of your theories of ‘romanticism’.” John fidgets with the end of his jacket sleeve.
“Oh, did you think we were done?” Sherlock asked innocently, as he tugged at John’s clinging trousers. The motion forced the serf onto his side, and John squawked in protest at the treatment. Sherlock tossed the fabric away, climbing back onto the bed and over the boy.
Jim beamed, spreading out his hands and arms in a congratulatory gesture. "See? I knew there was a reason I kept you as a partner, but that's not entirely it Sherly."
He blinked to reorient himself, and caught the last trace of a small smile on Sherlock’s face. John’s heart skipped. Apparently, using his brain was enough to briefly draw Sherlock out of a foul mood.
On the news John watched the next morning, while Sherlock discreetly observed every breath, they displayed the mugshot of Kirstie Trelbig as they recounted her death of a sudden heart attack in her cell the night before.
“You’re dead,” John said with finality. “You’re going to be a dead teenager in ten seconds; if you don’t tell me the fucking Nobel Peace Prize winning reason you concocted to act like you were an addict for over a
“Oi,” John argued, “I will have you know that this is a classic film. Built on the merits of fine British action heroes, and the joy of watching things explode.”
“Yeah, and uh, we’ll have it at your place.”
“Free?” John spits, but Sherlock ignores him.
All three of them are exercising their control. Jim watches Sherlock and John's reaction with hungry eyes, his erection lying bobbing and forgotten between his legs. John counts backwards from ten three times, easing his body around Sherlock's cock. Eventually, the sting fades away to a dull ache, and an all new kind of whimper is wrenched from John's throat.
And it was the delicious and rare smell of an untaken Omega that made him sit up in his chair.
He places the water bottles on the surface, and looks John in the eyes. His breath is stolen away from the amount of lust in that gaze. Jim's lids lower, noticing the small gasp.
“Well, good thing that we’re in a hospital, if that had happened. Which it didn’t. So don’t worry so much.”
Perhaps they had all been transferred to the sea, left afloat on the open water, with how assuredly the floor was rocking.
Something very important was happening, something that would alter their interactions forevermore. But John couldn’t think of a way to get everything back to the way it was. He felt like a train that had suddenly derailed, and there was no way to get the tracks back. All John could do was float in the loss of solid ground, and wait for the impact.
"You know what?" Eliminate the problem entirely, make up an explanation to Sherlock later, "I'm actually just going to go meet up with him. You can keep the booth, it's fine. Your friends will probably be grateful for it." He gives another tight smile, and goes to find Sherlock. If he finds him, he can just give a half truth to the whole thing. She sat down, he got up before she could talk. Because he knows better. That should work.
“Oh really? You seem to be doing everything to prove the contrary.”
John's not sure what the man finds, but he continues talking when he's done. "They enjoy their little mindfuck games, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he left that here on purpose."
The air stilled between them. There was a long pause as both brothers made a decision.
With a shout of anger and fear, John gripped the length that wrapped around in front of him. He lowered himself down and tried to walk backward. He could barely move. Even with his feet planted on the ground, Sherlock’s feeding of the chain into the created nook pulled him forward.
"We just flew," Sherlock breathed.
In fact, John’s shoulders begin to hurt quite distractingly after ten minutes of relative silence. John shifts around, which seems to be allowed, until his back is propped against the headboard. It’s still not ideal, but at least he can feel the blood running back into his hands.
He kissed his way down John’s chest. Each one seared like a brand. It wasn’t until Jim reached his navel, that John’s tongue felt small enough to allow for speech. “Am I…drugged…again?”
Before John can comment on the 'weight' thing, the man has one of his wings in a gentle yet unyielding grip.
“Then why let it bother you? With every certainty, I can tell you that that’s all that people do Johnny. They die.”
Which, of course, was why he had forgotten about his own wife until she greeted him at the door.
The empty fall enveloped him as he heard a familiar roar.
“So how long did you live with humans?”
“The bones were here; the fight took place mere hours ago! It was all--” he stopped himself. John looked down at his hands, covered in black. It clung like ash, or like false accusations made evident, filthying everything he touched or said.
He pushes Sherlock away, (don't think about the consequences of that), vaults off of the bed, and rushes to the toilet. He's bent over, sweaty, and his mouth tastes vile when the room stops spinning. He blindly paws at the switch, but Sherlock's hand beats him to it, and his sick is washed away. He stares at the clear water, barely distinguishing his reflection.
“Yes,” John interrupted. He didn’t know how Sherlock was able to keep breathing at the same time as those rants. He didn’t think he had seen Sherlock take a single breath inward.
blatant about it. John uses some of the leftover cream as lubricant and begins stroking. He tries really hard to think of that beautiful blonde nurse from the surgery. Of the tiny mole by her mouth and her rounded and full breasts. Instead, John thinks of himself on the stool that still hasn't been removed from his room. He thinks of the unerring accuracy of long, pale fingers. Of a deep and growling voice at his ear, promising remarkable pleasure if he would only give in. Let it happen. Let go.
Sherlock can't be too accommodating, he did give Jim instructions not to bother him.
And then John's resolve to wank one out becomes steely. Consequences? Fuck it. It's enough of a hassle being in here. He can take what Sherlock can dish out. Hell, at this point, physical pain would be preferable over the constant nagging worry that
Sherlock gently pats the side of John’s face to get his bleary attention, “Not to worry John, I’ll be back with the needed remedies. I’ve heard aftercare is important for this type of thing.”
Moriarty motions to the plush chair next to him, "Sit down Johnny, let's get started. We don't want to be here all night do we?" There it is again, something passes between the two men that John can't quite make out. He sits down, quite confused at the inside joke that seems to involve him as the punch line.
John had found a quiet place away from prying eyes before he dry-heaved. Was this ever going to stop? Was the next visit going to be the village’s last? All because he had rejected the advances of a dragon?
“Hold on, I never said I would do that.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, “Well, that would depend entirely on what it is you think I’m doing. I’m observant, Doctor Watson, I’m not a mind reader.”
“That isn’t an issue in this case. I’m of consensual age.” The hurt was being rapidly replaced with practiced certainty. Like Sherlock had come prepared for this argument.
“Well,” Jim immediately brightened, “good thing I came out to fetch you then. I saved some food for you with the intent to join you for a late supper. And I refuse to take no for an answer about it. After all, we have much to talk about.”
John thought about it, “You know I think you could use one, you’re practically rail thin.” He smiled at Sherlock’s glare and held up his hands, “Alright, I see your point. I just didn’t think that you liked all of the you know,” he gestured at the brick façade and wrought iron lamps on the outside, “pomp and circumstance.”
“Oh thank Heaven you found him! I almost started to search the other side of town before I saw your horse.”
Fury.
The whole thing keeps John’s back arched into an almost perfect bow. His arms are bound together and rest against the dip above his coccyx. John is rendered immobile and silent by his own pliability.
?” As soon as the question left his mouth, John regretted it. He was still too unbalanced by the visit, and the implication that he and Sherlock were—had been--. Well.
"Hm, little Johnny," Jim croons as he turns the head to give a peck on John's lips, "ever the trooper."
John’s spirits were quite lifted. Sherlock saw the change in mood, and tension leeched from him. “Oh, thank the Lord,” Sherlock sincerely said as he set his book on the nightstand, “there’s the good-natured John I know, not the stranger flinching at shadows.”
"Perhaps the dosage of diazepam was a tad excessive." muses Sherlock. John quickly turns towards his captor's voice, and nearly falls on his face in the process. His hands and knees are on the floor now, and his vision is swimming again. He hears approaching footsteps, and tries to move back. He's stopped by the leg of the table, and he feels frustratingly helpless with the relaxant coursing through his body. Sherlock's smiling in his face now, and he moves to punch it off.
He thrashed in the grip of the phantoms to find himself staring into Jim’s black eyes. John’s neck tingled from a fresh and slowly blooming bruise. His wrists were pinned to the bed, which seemed excessive since John could barely call upon the strength to move his body.
“Not in the literal definition, perhaps not. In the sense of day-to-day function however, you’ve shown to be quite necessary.”
The wings immediately fold around his shoulders, completely obstructing the view and Sherlock nearly kicks himself. The gargoyle huffs a laugh, "Good luck, that opening is barely enough to fit the bottom of me through. And those windows I saw in the front are too exposed."
“Sorry John, can’t hear you, already leaving.” Sherlock waved goodbye without looking as he walked away.
John prayed that he could vomit the substance, and perhaps he’d be free of the effects. Despite his wishes, and his quavering stomach, nothing came forth. Desperation moved his trembling limbs, and he started to reach inside of his mouth. The pads of his fingers had barely touched his tongue before it was yanked away.
His tongue is seeking, and slowly explores every inch of John's mouth. When Jim pulls away for a breath, John unconsciously follows with his lips. The man giggles, pleased at John's cooperation. In the original discussion of the plan, Jim had been worried that he'd be forced to only watch as Sherlock ravaged John on the desk. But this, is certainly much more satisfying.
By the end of the day John felt more like himself, and was able to walk around without much pain. Sherlock saw how that had slightly alleviated his mood and brought more news, “I received a telegram today, from the retired professor I got in contact with.”
Sherlock shook his head. He seemed to have trouble following the meaning of words. He scratched at his arm, “I just—I lost my stash. From earlier. I can pay again; I just need a bit more.”
Jim's head falls back, and his groans join in the chorus. John dares to suck at the head, moving his tongue at the same time. The action causes Jim to clench the back of his hair. John doesn't really mind. He lowers himself a little, and bobs his head in the same time as Sherlock's thrusts.
“Yours,” John nearly yelled, hoarse with the volume and his continual moaning, “I’m yours Sherlock.”
“John,” Sherlock said, “I am so sorry that you found out about our unfortunate past this way. You were never meant to see this.”
The late evening sun allows no hiding places in this vast space, and it wouldn't dare go out when it could be easily seen at this hour. Perhaps it sleeps somewhere else? Maybe this is its search tower? A place to keep its food and "precious" belongings before going on its patrol.
“Remember what I said John,” he murmurs against it, listening to John’s shuddering breathing, “only while you’re in pain.”
The guy assesses him dubiously once more, then nods his head to the other side. "Get in, there's a place not far from here."
“Then the only thing you truly know about me is my relation to Sherlock, along with my name. For you see, it would be enough to catch my attention that Sherlock would have found anyone at all to include in his reckless schemes. What pulls me away from my busy schedule, is something else entirely.”
When Sherlock gets his breath back, he starts moving. Shallow thrusts, ones that send sharp notes of pleasure through John. Sherlock's cock is only brushing his prostate. And God, even with all of the lube and prepping, Sherlock is still pressed against his walls. If Sherlock's movements are meant to drive him mad, then John considers it a job well accomplished. His body is long past the point of decency. He's writhing against the buckles. Not to get away, but to get more friction, more movement wherever he can find it.
Instead, they both clung to pride, their supposed last and most cherished possession, and stalked off to their separate beds without another word.
Each dig through the rock tears at his hands. Just as the love for his kin tears at his soul. His rookery brothers and sisters, his elders, his friends, all of them lost to the fear of the ones they'd protected for so long.
He wants to explore John's mouth as he cries out from being filled to the brim. He wants John to scream to the heavens from an overload of sensation (pleasure or pain Sherlock doesn't care), but Sherlock will be the only one to ever hear it. Sherlock loves this, loves watching his soldier come apart under his touch. And they've barely even begun.
Sherlock, despite the fact that he remained as giddy as when he had dismissed a police officer, was clearly fighting sleep. John was too. So they kept each other awake with recounts of what they’d thought of the other during the escapade.
Jim protested, “Oh you spoilsport, you’re going to block his face from me!”
John looked mildly perplexed. This certainly called for a demonstration. Without saying anything, Sherlock laid himself beside John. The blonde strained against his bonds to the opposite side, attempting to put a bit of distance between them. John's stomach was still exposed to the cold air, and Sherlock began tracing patterns on the skin with his right hand. His left arm supported his weight behind John's head. In fascination he watched John's muscles flinch away from the touch Sherlock inflicted. John faced the wall, resolutely ignoring the ticklish sensations.
John tried turning away to uselessly shuffle about and give the boy time to run far away, but he stopped short when a hand gently fell on his arm.
After a little while of peaceful swaying, John asks, “So, what have you been studying?”
“What does your brother do again?”
He pushed down the strange non-memories and said, “Indeed. I don’t suppose that, as new companions, you could sneak me out of this room for a short while?”
John’s chest twinged in sympathy. He knew that Sherlock and Jim had only ever found solace in the other due to their massive minds. Such brilliance, and tendency to overlook conventional etiquette, must have made for isolated childhoods; the likes of which John could never hope to fully understand.
“Did I drink anything before I lost myself?” John didn’t realize he’d asked the question aloud until he heard the words leave his mouth.
At first, he just arrived later than the norm. John never drew attention to it, because he didn’t see a good reason to. He took it as a possible good sign that Sherlock was finally becoming interested in his orchestral class.
What he finds are cars. Dozens of them. All kinds. From a school bus (John prays that wasn't used like he thinks it would be) to what looks to be an authentic 250 GTO Ferrari. That had been the car of his dreams when he was a kid. John shakes his head. Focus.
It was with no small amount of bitterness that John began to wonder if Sherlock had been right all along. Perhaps there wasn’t much this town could offer in terms of lively discussion. John dismissed those thoughts. Clearly there was some misunderstanding. If Sherlock and Jim contributed as much as they did, half of these people were employed by them in some fashion. John being here must have seemed like an envoy coming to evaluate the behaviors and mannerisms of their subordinates.
Yet that was what John saw. He saw bloodlust in the dim reflection of that icy gaze. Inexplicably, John almost could not recognize his own husband.  A quick revival of his senses caused him to stop Sherlock from pursuing the bandits with a restraining hand on his arm.
“We take every precaution,” Sherlock assured him, continuing to look completely surprised that his husband would be so accepting of a strange past time.
Sherlock sighed like he was deeply saddened by the question. “Perhaps. Your room was cleaned while you were unconscious. You will have to speak with Moriarty, who’s been as distraught about your condition as I have been. But, my dear John, you must understand that questions like these are the reason behind what I must tell you next.”
Slick fingers pressed against his entrance, and he bit down on his tongue to delay his cry. Strange fingers slowly opened him up. The sensation of the slickness, being on his belly, and his thrice damned response to danger had John slowly shifting his hips against the sheets.
John could deal with the bondage, the gag, and the abrupt shift into sex, he’s been doing that almost every day. What makes him nervous is the mirror.
He turns the stove on, facing the gargoyle once again, and pulls a face at the frown the gargoyle sports,
“Stop! Sherlock, please! Just stop!” John is half out of his mind with longing, but he still possesses enough sense to guess Sherlock’s response. When it comes this far, the point of begging turns paltry anyway.
At 20, he was content with the idea of dying young. It would make for a much prettier picture, wouldn't it? No one wants to look at you when you are 80, dead or alive. It would be better if he died before the effects of natural aging could be seen negatively on his face.
Sherlock startled when his mobile pinged insistently at around 3 am a few days later. He had dozed off while he was thinking on the couch. This was happening more and more since John was very close to forcing him to eat. Sherlock wasn't sure how to handle the new development. When the case had started, eons ago it seemed, he had put up a barrier, wanting to see the devil as all the evil in his life. After all, he was the reason, his life hadn't really been a life anymore. It was his right to push him into that particular corner, wasn't it? He didn't want to think about it any further but the thought kept nudging him consistently. As awkward as it sounded, the devil, John, had become somewhat of a dependable companion in Sherlock’s life. That development was dangerous beyond belief but Sherlock didn’t feel inclined to halt it just yet.
Like promised John had come back to check on Sherlock later that night, when the noises coming from his bedroom indicated that another waved had just subsided. The sight of the other lying completely wrecked in a mess of tangled sheets, panting hard and looking delirious made John’s heart ache. He did his best to care for the Omega before leaving him to sleep. With any luck the boy would sleep for some time, his body already looking wrung out to exhaustion. Sighing John grabbed his phone and left a message for his secretary, taking time off work for the next two days. Although he had planned to leave Sherlock on his own, trusting the other would know what to do with his heat, he couldn’t bring himself to actually leave the flat. He really desperately needed the curly haired boy conscious enough to talk this whole predicament through with him.
John paused briefly, turning himself more squarely towards Sherlock. "Because I don't actually take anything that isn't given willingly and", he gently cupped Sherlock's chin to press a soft kiss to Sherlock's bottom lip, "I wouldn't have been able to coerce you into anything for days now, even if I had wanted to."
“Wait five minutes and then try to get it up again?” there was a smirk curling along the plush lips and John had to chuckle.
For a fact, Sherlock had never let anyone in his room since he had presented as an Omega. No one was allowed to upset the calming and familiar balance of smells he had achieved. Therefor this was definitely not his room. His eyes flew from one wall to the next, quickly assessing the contents of the strange surroundings Chest of drawers, wardrobe, bedside table, full length mirror, a small sideboard holding an iPod docking station and a few memorabilia he wasn’t really looking at. His hands started to clench in panic. Due to his meticulous schedule keeping he was aware that his heat was about to set on within the next 24 hours. With trembling legs he got up from the bed, realising that he was only clad in a thin dressing gown. His mind came crashing down with the most likely reason for his situation.
“Well now,” she said, and that familiar grin began to brighten up her face, “hello to you too.”
Yet, despite the pain, the disgust and the hatred, John can feel himself becoming hard again. Apparently, enough time has passed for the relentless stimulation to finally take its toll. With the blindfold and the steady rising of arousal, John almost loses where he is. For a split second, he feels like this is consensual.
Sherlock led him further and further away from the town, until they were travelling up a winding pathway. They were further into the countryside than John had ever gone, and he privately wondered just what Sherlock had planned.
It didn’t matter, John told himself as he walled away the realizations that were trying to break through. This development between them was being stopped, one way or another. There was no point in trying to figure something out when its point was already moot.
As he realized he could lose the use of his leg, like a fairytale blessing revoked, the loss of everything else came crashing over him too. No more fun and interesting conversations during lunch. No more late night texts to his phone asking for some bizarre ingredient to an even stranger experiment. He wouldn’t know when Sherlock had gotten into another argument with one of his teachers, or when he had scathingly deduced every dirty secret of a snide student. The sense of purpose and belonging that John had settled into over such a short time was now gone.
He expects anger at the abrupt question, instead the man's eyes lighten with something like approval. John doesn't know it's because he'd asked about the specific digit, not why Jim did it at all. The ghost of a smirk disappears when Moran replies, "Used to be a sniper. Damn good too. One of the best. On my second night here Jim cut off my trigger finger. Said he was going to be the only important thing in my life anymore." By the end of his speech, Sebastian's absently cradling the hand with the missing appendage.
Eventually, when sweat had made a steady trail down John’s spine, the man left with his gathered documents, humming a lilting tune. John waited until he heard the click of the door, the last of the footsteps, and several dozen heartbeats, before he let out the anxiety that had been lodged in his lungs.
Sherlock’s lips warm under John’s gasp when he starts stroking John’s cock again.  It had flagged perceivably under John’s knowledge, and it takes a bit more effort on Sherlock’s part to get it hard again.
John has tilted his head for better access, and Sherlock has never felt happier. The kisses travel from his neck, to behind his ear, to his jawline. His other hand is resting on John's shoulder for support, though he is careful not to place too much pressure. The wound is still fresh, and he doesn't feel like this moment warrants pained cries.
John woke up. His wrists were strapped to the headboard with soft but unyielding leather. The waking nightmare of the past few days caught up to him, and he thrashed.
Regardless, they both wanted a
He runs up the steps, body balanced on the edge of excitement and conclusion. He's making a lot of noise up the metal stairs, and the creature would have heard the fire alarm, but hopefully the fear of being seen in broad daylight will keep the creature from escaping from its only exit. If it tries to come down the steps, Sherlock will easily be able to intercept it.
The memory of John stretched, filled, and aching is too much. Now he's hard. John gives a small groan and thumps his head back against the couch. He feels like his balls are about to burst if he doesn't come soon. Knowing medical certainties doesn't help with a body's urges, John's found out. John remembers Sherlock's warning about consequences.
John nearly steps back to try and help, but Sherlock stops him by placing a hand under his chin and tilting it upward so that he can lean in and kiss him. As John moves his lips against Sherlock’s, and moves his tongue in the familiar patterns, he’s distantly relieved. This is familiar territory. He can lose himself here, and not have to think about cutting truths or unknown motivations for a short while.
"Regardless of what emotion you feel John, it's unwarranted, I assure you. What we have can be enjoyable for you, I promise." He says this while never stopping his application of the ointment. The stinging is receding, and John's body involuntarily relaxes at the soothing sensation of the cream. Well, most of his body is relaxing. Another part of him is still responding to human touch, no matter where it comes from.
Experience, possibly but certainly not wisdom.
He tries to gently squeeze the bridge of his nose even as it twitches from the tickling sensation.
It felt so worthless. What was the point?
He needed to sneeze.
He didn’t merely want to sneeze anymore. He needed to. Desperately.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
He’d never actively wished to sneeze before and the one time he would choose to, it didn’t happen.
He lay in a hospital bed in a room with the shrill beeps and buzzing of various monitors, with crisp white sheets and voices murmuring in the corridors.
John glanced at the bare spot above his bed where he had pinned his calendars to the wall. It was no use marking time anymore.
Nothing happened.
John was something of an outcast at school and even sometimes felt that way within his own family. He was that quiet kid, the weird one, the strange child. He found himself more interested in what teenagers were doing and talking about than his own classmates. John caught himself wondering if being a teenager himself would somehow close the gap – he’d still be interested in teenage things even as his so called peers began to show an interest, surely?
Don’t do this.
John thrived in his new environment and embraced being a teenager. The gap between him and his peers had closed enough for him to have some really close mates - no longer was he that weird kid. Somehow, his behaviour seemed more age appropriate and reassured everyone around him, his parents included, that John Watson was actually quite normal after a bit of an interesting start to life.
Well…John Watson. But that was hardly ordinary.
As John watched the sun set for the first time on his tenth birthday, the ice on his chest seemed to thaw inside in correspondence with fiery glow upon the edge of the horizon until finally the ice seemed to melt as darkness took a hold of the sky.
He had time.
John felt that same icy coldness sliding through his veins, settling in his chest. That ice would no longer be his companion only on his birthday each year, nor would it melt with each sunset. Instead, that familiar heaviness became the one thing he was certain of.
John looked around his office at work as the door clicked shut behind the last patient of the day. He rubbed at his tired, dry eyes and glanced at the wall. Medical degree framed and in pride of place – check. At least there would not be another attempt at university. John breathed a slow, relieved gust of air out even as he checked the date on the desk calendar. Ah, only three year this time.
John watched a red sun sink into a dark green horizon and didn’t think the colours were the slightest bit garish. He looked down at himself, already suspecting what he would see and feeling strangely numb at the sight of blue pyjamas with multi-coloured stars dotted here and there. Pyjamas clad upon his ten year old form.
Even more dreadful, what if his last sneeze was it? What if he never sneezed again? Was this all his life was to be, from here on out?
At parent/teacher interviews, while John quietly read a book out in the corridor, they were asked what kind of work they did with John at home to help him achieve these results. Initially considered gifted, it was established that he wasn’t gifted so much as focused, seeming to have previous experience with all the learning material. Mr and Mrs Watson could only shake their heads in wonder as they denied having any particular routine to help their son. They couldn’t explain it. John was just…John.
Here the days bleed into each other not because of a mundane similarity, but because each day is so strikingly different he couldn’t begin to describe it. Some days he is on patrol with his unit, where they scout different locations or come across different people and danger seems to be breathing down their necks. Other days, he spends in the medical tent where the closest he gets to the action is when he is trying desperately to save the life of the soldier on the table in front of him. Yet more days, he lazes around on his bunk, hazy from the heat and awaiting his next assignment.
Of course John knew the reasons Sherlock had given him, voice grainy over the phone and raw with the emotions Sherlock thought himself above. John had pleaded, reaching for the man high above as if the distance between them was little more than a concept. Easily swatted away as an annoying idea.
John rediscovers himself in the army. He finds a new purpose for himself in fighting whoever Queen and Country point towards. Slowly, he feels the ice which covers his limbs and flesh melt under the heat of the Afghani sun, his skin slowly turning such a bright sheen of gold it makes his blonde hair look pale.
John clenched his fists and banged angrily on the desk, spilling the cup of coffee all over the pieces of paper.
For fear of a sneeze, was John to sit on his arse and be naught more than this?
But it was also his only chance at bringing a third party into this, someone objective who could help via intervention. He now had to deal with this on his own.
His leg tensed with the instinct to kick and buck away, and a sharp pain immediately followed. John would have been prepared to try and free his captive leg at the risk of heavy lacerations and further ire, but he was let go at the last second.
He looked like every mopey teenager that hadn’t gotten his way. Which made John’s eyes narrow in suspicion.
John was amazed, terrified, and bewildered. “That’s correct. Absolutely correct. How did you know-?”
