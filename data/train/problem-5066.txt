Everything in the workshop is exactly as Tony left it. While the tower sustained some damage during the attack, the actual point of Chitauri ingress had been a gaping portal that stretched over the George Washington Bridge and into Fort Lee. The location of that time/space tear was just one more senseless aspect of an attack that had no herald or causation on 'their' side of reality. It was as though some fool god had thrown a cosmic dart, only to miss New York City proper by a hair. Nothing about the battle had been logical, least of all its abrupt ending, but Rogers has turned it over and over in his mind so many times it seems as though one more tactical assessment will break the fragile casing which holds him here, in
the one way he and Tony _are_ the same. Neither one of them is afraid to die for the 'cause', even if they're not always sure what that cause is. ('Protect', yes-- simple, visceral, but what the hell does that _mean_?) Hell, Tony's gone down in flames so many times he's starting to feel a little disappointed when he gets back up again.
talking to the absent genius, leaving silence in those places meant for technical jargon, and filling in the quips as if-- with enough practice-- he might function as some sort of conduit. He drinks and the ghost of Tony drinks, neither of them suffering for it-- and companionable lapses occur when the soldier's imagination falls woefully short.
Tony bobs back up with just as little warning as when he laid his head down and, as Steve reacts to the sudden motion, his chin almost collides with the alpha's skull. Both of them manage to dodge in time, which leaves them nose-to-nose with one another, so close Rogers can see the flecks of deep cadmium gold which hide in his bondmate's dark eyes. He licks his lips again, mouth suddenly far more dry than may be accounted for by mere medicinal side-effects.
, as profound as a boat suddenly lifted by a mile-high wave. It's nauseous, molecular, and accompanied by a thin high scream. Tony thinks the voice sounds female, but the pitch is so mutilated by agony that it's hard to tell. Distant, but with the force of the desperate. She's gonna hit this one out of the park, folks. He wishes he could take comfort in the knowledge he's not the only human here, but the quality of fear in that cry makes it rather a moot point.
While he tries to entertain this thought with his hallmark irreverent humor ('I've been held hostage in classier joints than
understand cold, hard facts-- coordinates and points of enemy ingress, artillery deficit and casualty figures. He's not the only one left mourning after the Battle of Fort Lee, and yet…
All of this passes through Steve's mind in a handful of moments, the sort of mental calculus omegas must perform all the time as they try to suss out the finer details of what is and is not permissible. He feels these considerations wending between the emanations of coruscating light and incomprehensible equations that stem from Tony's end of the bond.
Tony used to make cracks about being his own worst enemy-- born with traitors already inside the gate. An aching, belated sense of commiseration has come over Steve these past few months
Like a shift along the spectrum of light, his perception changes utterly while the world itself remains unaltered. What has been a fairly academic consideration of his 'new' biological identity and the consequences thereof-- terrifying enough for the cascade of changes it portends for his comfortable and prosaic life-- is cast suddenly in the ultra-violet of visceral, mortal dread. Even the bond he both treasures and fears is really only a means to an end for, since humanity's close brush with self-annihilation,
The alpha draws closer still, leaving barely a breath between their bodies. "Do you think I want one of those delicate whips of blown glass? Some sort of automata that says 'Yes, Alpha' and 'No, Alpha', and knows every standardized erotic pose?"
[+] Kay Sage was an American painter who began working in 1936. She identified as a Surrealist despite the fact many in the school rejected her based on her gender and upper-class background. Her painting, "Tomorrow Is Never", makes me think of how Steve would probably feel on his worst days in the 21st Century.
partly submerged-- intersecting in his gut. His eyes feel gummy, but closing them provides little relief. An intolerable brightness surrounds him, light so harsh and unrelenting it feels like a solid thing, despite the fact it has no discernible source. No bare lightbulbs or warehouse fluorescents here, and Stark has come to the conclusion that this diffuse brilliance is a significant decorative flaw. To be cliche is one thing; its almost entertaining to see would-be villains posture in overdone noir, or watch Hydra commandants strut as if they aren't the distillation old-world nightmare. They make mockeries of themselves, and Tony loves to point this out. Even in Afghanistan, he couldn't quite keep a lid on his smart mouth. One of the burlier minions-- a sadistic homunculus Tony dubbed 'Tweedle Three', having used up Tweedles Dee, Dumb, and Doo-Doo-- swore he'd have the engineer's tongue as a souvenir when his usefulness was over. Tweedle Three's attention was far from flattering, but actively loathing Stark kept the bastard's focus away from Yinsen. The nascent Iron Man put an end to the thug, but not before… well.
"What isn't helping?" Stark asks, pulling away to search his mate's face for distress. Steve points upward with a sheepish look and Tony gazes as instructed, seeming to notice the elaborate and unusual ceiling for the first time. "Huh. That's a bit much, even for the Grandmaster. Does it bother you?" Then, without waiting for an answer, "I'll have them find us another room."
Tony looks up at this, what was obviously intended as only a swift glance quickly morphing into a prolonged and hungry gaze. His eyes are very arresting-- entrancing, their attention almost a palpable thing. A tongue, shockingly pink amongst bruise-colored lips and dark goatee, darts out briefly, as though tasting the air. "You look--"
to be rescued. Sooner or later, his captors will move him, or feed him, or come to to interrogate (or manically pontificate at) him. Some detail will slip, someone will screw up.
Is that Tony's thought, or only Steve's admittedly vivid imagination? It's rare for bondmates to communicate more than impressions, ideas, or vague memories, but it isn't unheard of.
Some of the larger clusters are presided over by impressive blank screens, but still more feature an ominous emptiness where holographic displays once hovered for their creator's reference and tactile manipulation. Tony had coaxed Bruce into the Avengers Tower with promises of an R&D wonderland, clearly gratified by the physicist's reaction, but Steve had known enough to be astonished as well. He couldn't see it from their perspective, of course, or articulate his awe in any way that wouldn't sound profoundly foolish. Yet his had been the amazement of someone who can appreciate a marvel as-is, without needing to deconstruct it. 'A miracle
Slowly, solemn as an art student in a vast Florentine cathedral, Steve begins a circling tour of the room's shelves and benches. Draped as they are by clear, protective plastics, it is still perfectly easy to discern the tools and half-finished projects beneath, even if it isn't always obvious what those projects are
- the truth, or the Goddess of Truth, daughter of Saturn in the Roman Pantheon. In this 'verse, a spontaneous true bond triggered by genetic/spiritual compatibility (depending on who you ask), as opposed to a bond arranged for political purposes.
had close calls before. The Avengers have seen Iron Man subsumed by molten steel, seemingly defeated by an LMD, and the civilian Stark attacked or kidnapped in the few short feet between office door and limousine.
U and Butterfingers stopped moving shortly before JARVIS himself fell silent. Even now, they sit inert in their charging stations, shrouded in an air of disuse despite their overall cleanliness. Steve is uncertain of just how much individual impetus they ever possessed to begin with, for they were always the more predictable and obedient of Tony's 'bots. For any given value thereof. Dummy is the 'quirky' one, simultaneously the oldest and most childlike of Stark's creations. Arguments surrounding code evolution, machine learning, and the possible development of independent (if not exactly 'free') will are enough to make the old soldier dizzy in under five minutes, and it's hardly an area he'd pretend to know anything about. All he knows it what he sees-- 'anecdata', Tony called it. Dummy is
Steve wonders, for there must yet be cooking grease and dish soap under his nails. He'd tried to clean up when Bernie ordered him out on the floor, clad in a borrowed servitor's uniform that practically hung off his frame. The Grandmaster would not care that they were seriously understaffed and the ill-prepared shift leader had known as much, just as she'd been certain Steve wasn't in a position to disobey. The club has clear standards of aesthetics and professionalism and, at the time, he'd been half-afraid his employment would end before the night itself did. Oh, to be at once right and so devastatingly wrong! Ruefully, he considers it something of a miracle Tony was able to scent him at all over the pungent mixture of a thousand exotic spices and plate scrapings.
He's blushing now, a sad tell that always involves his whole thin frame, while their mutual expectant gazing spins out into interminable silence.
says a phantom echo of the Grandmaster, right next to Steve's ear and seemingly at least as real as the renewed pounding at the bathroom door.
Of course, he is now his alpha's ward, legally vouchsafed to Stark's mercy. There may yet be retribution.
In the oppressive quiet of his strange, vault-like cell, Tony begins to sense a change. The specifics are at first indiscernible, like the sensation of altering air pressure when a plane takes off or lands. Then he's certain it is his ears popping, painfully, though his time as Iron Man has previously rendered him fairly immune. But no-- what his brain is trying to translate is actually a shift in
Rogers had been ready to fight at first, not quite understanding (or perhaps not ready to understand) what was happening. Stark, having caught enough of the ill-prepared servant's scent, had almost jumped him as he turned from the table. Having enough sense to know the palatial amber-and-carnelian floors of the Grandmaster's banquet pavilion were no place for a brawl, Steve's first thought was to get away from the crowd. Alphas take umbrage occasionally, especially when in their cups. It's uncouth, but so is half of what goes on in such clubs, especially the ogling of 'entertainment' betas dressed and scented in omega 'drag'. Unable to think just how he'd challenged the guest's authority merely by bringing euphoric to the table, Steve had dropped the entire elaborate drink tray (which was thankfully DuraChina) and high-tailed it for the relative safety of the kitchen, where he could at least defend himself without an audience and fight on familiar ground.
Though Steve's own immediate sensation is one of guilt, as though he himself is some sort of peeping Tom, he also can't help but find the paradox rather striking.
"Some nose on that fella," Steve remarks inconsequentially, now leaning against the smooth metal wall of a workshop in an entirely different century, where it isn't illegal to marry outside your race or love someone of the same sex. You can even dance with them out in the open, assuming you can dance at all. He's so tired, running on fumes but unwilling to sleep because he knows he'll dream, and the enemy is moving around in the dark. Redrawing the lines.
All of this had left Tony to follow, deaf to the shouts of his compatriots, chasing Steve down isles of industrial equipment while his quarry calculated hasty strategy and at last, massive pot lid in hand, turned for a show-down. Rogers isn't sure what happened to his makeshift shield-- at some point, he was staring at the alpha with a dizzying feeling of revelation and only his bare fists raised. 'Apocalypse,' they called it in catechism class, 'a drawing back of the veil'. He'd certainly
Why is it that, just when you really need to write to take your mind off things, your muse takes off for the Crab Nebula without so much as a post-it note? Seriously, I've been trying to finish this since late August, but I think we're finally good to go. As always, kudos and comments make me a happy little speckle, and keep me motivated to decipher my own bloody handwriting. ^^'
[+] It's my personal head-canon that Steve, Natasha, and Bruce (and Pepper!) have a little unofficial club where they sit around and quietly read and listen to music that doesn't involve wailing guitars, usually while Tony, Thor, and Clint are downstairs (breaking) playing with the Wii. ^_~
That earns him an almost conspiratorial grin. "Guess not. Would you like me to see if I can arrange for us to leave?"
Yet that doesn't matter anymore, does it? Rogers may still have that shield against the world-- the flinty look in his eyes and the battle-readiness that doesn't go with his frame-- but Tony won't be fooled. Stark is behind the protective barrier
, who inspired me to go back and take a look at what I had written of chapter two, which was more than I recalled. Submitted for your approval/whumping, a grieving!Steve of a dimension not too far from 616.
. He has neither seen nor interacted with his captors, catching not one glimpse before the blow to his head brought blackness rushing fetid over his consciousness. (And how could FRIDAY-- while not as thoroughly integrated into the infrastructure as JARVIS-- have been interfered with to a degree that would let 'them' get so close?)
himself was delicious and (though memories of last day or so are more than a little bit jumbled) Rogers is pretty sure there isn't a centimeter of his body the alpha hasn't become intimately acquainted with. Though he'd never put much thought into the mating habits of alphas-- such contemplation seemed unsafe, like thumbing one's nose at the Devil, the solicitude still strikes Steve as… unexpected.
"I'm sure they would be happy to take your money," the smaller man says, trying to gentle his gut reaction even as he feels Stark tense, "but there's not much they can do. These things happen… often enough that I carry the pills to begin with."
In answer to the question of his wellness, still very much evident in his companion's dark eyes, Steve murmurs, "I'm fine."
Certainly, there'd been no Steve to knock on the glass with monotonous determination, protein shake or sandwich in hand, practically standing at parade rest like the combined forces of Asgard wouldn't move him until Tony ate. A puzzling anomaly for, though Cap and Iron Man had become a well-oiled if snarky machine on the battlefield, two out of five non-uniform conversations still ended… less than amicably. Yet there he'd be, all six foot plus of super soldier-- buff, blond, and totally unmoved by Tony's lack of gratitude. Once, the man brought him carrot sticks. Carrot sticks! Needless to say, vociferous protests about not being the class pet rabbit and accusations of insincere attempts at team bonding bounced off Cap like bullets off Vibranium. By no means frequent or predictable, it still happened often enough for Stark to determine that he was missing some variable in causation.
The interrupted evolution of these inventions-- here a new 'bite' for Widow, a specialized expanding utility belt for Hank, there a circular contraption that looks vaguely related to Iron Man's HUD interface-- extrudes a sense of limbo that has begun to infect to the entire floor. Perhaps that is another reason Steve often finds himself down here, for the aimlessness of shock and bereavement seems not unlike the fate once promised unbaptized children. He has come to suspect, despite the semantic games of doctrine, that purgatory and even Hell itself have never been places of flame.
Silence is his only companion, not even the sounds of air ventilation to break up the rhythm of his own breathing. Silence and panic-- that old untrained freeloader, fucking with the values and breaking all the equipment. He's keeping it together despite the closeness of the fluid to his mouth and nose, despite the twin rapiers of anxiety-- being restrained
Despite the likelihood that he himself is the topic of conversation, Rogers feels only relief as the coppery baritone fades a bit-- still audible, but just below the mind's ability to parse without active concentration. Tony is obviously still moving about in the large bedchamber. He strikes Steve as the sort to pace, not from frustration or anxiety, but because his restless body cannot travel the endless vistas of his mind.
when others have endured trials far worse (if perhaps not quite so unusual). The mantle of 'atheist'
Naught but a shadow, reduced to faint and hateful graffiti by powerful dermal regenerators, the spiderweb of slashes radiates from a point just to the left of Tony's sternum, reaching loathsome white lines over the alpha's heart to just above his nipple. It is not that the scar itself is disgusting-- it is no different than the handful of far less flatteringly disguised marks Steve himself bears. It is the threat it represents to his mate's life that offends Roger's on an almost spiritual level. The thickest lines are crude slashes-- a village butcher would be less brutal!-- overlaid with fine incisions, all tracing back to the center of chaos, which is perceptibly darker and more apparent to his questing fingertips. It reminds him noting so much as the skewering of 'biological subjects' he has seen at traveling science carnivals, or the disjointed stained glass windows that depict the Solar Lamb stabbing a stake-like cross into the heart of Darkness itself. Medical technology in the Imperium is impressive, said to be greater than Old Earth's golden age, provided one has access to it; that any trace remains at all is a testament to how grievous the original wound must have been. In dim lighting, the cosmetic work would make it difficult to discern, but the location itself is like an unnecessary exclamation point, driving home the fact it is a miracle Tony survived.
about her work, as if you were looking over your own shoulder. Rhodey calls it 'getting bitten by reality'-- that fleeting feeling of alienation from yourself that brings on thoughts of 'where would I be if I wasn't here?' and 'what is 'I', anyway?'. As in, '
!'), there's something about his surroundings that make it more and more difficult maintain sangfroid the longer he's exposed to them. The reasons are ellusive-- unformed, subjective, impossible to quantify. In short, everything Tony loathes. Of equal width and breadth far greater than that of a usual cell, the room he's being held in is perhaps better termed a 'chamber'. It has the air of a crypt with its seamless walls, floor, and ceiling all precisely hewn from dark, oily stone. If someone took advantage of a natural stone cave to construct this space, they've done an excellent job of eradicating the random mineral build-up of millennia. Artificial geometry reigns here, absolute as the uniform poses of Egyptians on their bas-reliefs.
'Are you sure, Buck?' he almost asks aloud. He stops himself at the last minute, not that it counts for much. 'I wish I was sure.'
Experiencing that familiar scenario is a bit contingent upon rescue, of course-- something Tony would have had almost absolute faith in two months ago, and which he still evaluates as an 83-90% probability now. With no idea how much time has passed since his abduction, he has no way of predicting the likelihood that the latest iteration of the Avengers has even noticed his absence yet. That's what happens when you smile, build everyone a sparkling new facility, and quickly fuck off to Malibu as though you don't have your tail between your stylishly-clad legs. Steve had shaken his hand, quipping and nodding as appropriate during their manly parting, but even Tony (king of the unresolved) knows the threads left dangling between them are dipped in poison. Drawing betrayal, judgement, and disappointment up through the unfinished ends like clever roots, so that all might be desiccated without any further effort from either party.
It's tempting, even now. Steve has the choice to think rationally, for a little while at least, but it is not yet an obligation. Tony's eyes are dark, glittering, depthless water by the light of golden moons. 'Umber,' Steve thinks, because he has a watercolor stylus just that shade. It's never seemed like a color that communicated passion or tenderness before, but it does now.
Steve, under the mask and up against his skin. As close as the heart that always beats wildly within his chest during any confrontation, no matter how calm or determined he may appear.
It's a dream he hasn't admitted to since childhood, bright like a vein of silver through the ore of learned practicality. Nothing but mental flotsam from the start, such hopes, but there are still little things he can have. You make do. During festivals and the heavy-traffic of First and Second Summer, the Grandmaster brings in famous City artisans to produce the revues. Play-writes-- such as they are in the dubious genre of the 'boudoir stage'-- and costumers, set specialists who argue over color and lighting, even a hot-ticket 'tweener to headline. On the off-season, though, its just the aging stage manager with Peggy as part-time assistant, so they often let Steve do some of the set design. Especially for the raunchy late-night numbers. 'Just a flat holo-backdrop will be fine,' Reinstein might say, 'Do one of your Post-Burn deco revival things. No one's really paying attention, we just need to set the mood.'
The alpha is purring like a liger now, Steve thinks half-hysterically, still swathed in the surreal impressions they've discussed. The bounding scar adorning his neck is a clear source of pleasure for his mate, who runs a gentle knuckle along the shape of it. Unconsciously, Rogers parts and licks his lips, an instinctual invitation answered with the press of Tony's mouth, though not with the devouring passion he's become accustomed to.
that choice, to run from G-d, the gods, or just random operation of circumstance, and hope to remain free agents. Most omegas end up in political, arranged bonds if no
defied the odds. If Peggy-- a far better manager-- had been on shift, if Steve had been down with one of his innumerable illnesses, if Tony had not booked that particular dining terrace… A definite confluence of events then, yes, though perhaps just as easily malign. The Prince of Darkness can work wonders almost as well as the Solar Lamb. Yet Steve's stomach turns at the thought of losing this nascent connection, despite the fact its bound to cost him dearly. How can he want something--
Tony, seasoned abductee though he may be, lost track of time disturbingly early in this ordeal, and his prison only exacerbates the issue. Not a gap in the confines to let in a waxing and waning sliver of sunlight, not a sound from weather on the roof or traffic in the greater environs by which to extrapolate some temporal reference. All is silence, moments oozing by with slow but irregular protraction, leaving his head to throb and his shoulders to ache from the strain of his hands being bound above his head. Who's to say how long he's been gone, or even when during his latest engineering binge he was snatched? Timekeeping has never been his strong suit, even when not in the all-hallowed creative zone, and FRIDAY doesn't fabricate spurious interruptions to bring him up for air the way JARVIS did.
"'M alright," Rogers says, in typical blatant defiance of the facts. He stumbles towards the sink in its little alcove, the functional parts of the room being clustered in a recess absurdly like a church vestibule. "It's fine. Just nerves."
"I'm not afraid of anything." It's a reflexive response, and actually not quite true. Steve has known fear, as all rational creatures must at some point, he just never lets it stop him. It's a distinction most people don't understand and, if the bravado of the absolute must stand in its place, so be it. "I
Steve wakes to the slide of reverent fingers through his hair and the sight of fish swimming unconcernedly above him. It's difficult to say which of these factors is more disconcerting, especially since the fingers belong to the veritable stranger who is now his bondmate. Those same strong, dexterous digits retreat suddenly, drawing Steve's attention from the crystalline ceiling above to the alpha curled close around him. His companion looks torn between fondness, embarrassment, and some other emotion Steve cannot quite name. On a beta or omega he might call it 'tremulousness', but surely no alpha-- least of all the genius heir to the Stark fortune-- would show or experience such uneasiness with their own bonded.
in three dimensions,' he remembers thinking, watching Tony translate ideas into reality with nothing more than light. It had stirred the recollection of some pulp story he'd read long ago, in which film achieved a level of vivacity that allowed the images to gain independence from the actors themselves. The future--which, to everyone but Steve Rogers, masqueraded as the present-- could be by turns disheartening, encouraging, and often simply alien. Paradoxically, Stark's most outlandish creations often struck a cord of ease and recognition in the sickly, avidly imaginative boy still rattling around behind Captain America's helmet and shield.
So here is said genius, ransom value decidedly up in the air, trying to comfort himself with the knowledge that-- personality flaws or no-- not a soul on Earth would want Stark brains in the wrong hands.
With Stark, of course, it's different. What ought to sound condescending comes off as somehow charming, an invitation to share a private joke. There's real affection there-- Rogers can sense it even without the bond, and the emphatic augmentation makes each sobriquet feel like the lapping of a warm sea. The behavior is brash, dazzling, and utterly natural, the same way Tony's entrance instantly puts him in control of any given room. Steve's had a few glimpses of the business magnate before, always from the safety of back passageways and servant's stairwells that riddle the club, invisible as all the Grandmaster's staff are meant to be. The alpha is difficult to miss, even from a distance. On the raised gambling pavilion, where the golden columns and railings give the overall impression of an expensive birdcage; out in the mezzanine during revue intermissions, mingling with a crowd that always parts for him like the sea before Moses' staff. Stark's legitimacy is that of a liger striding through its territory-- command by virtue of
It is only on the cusp of sleep-- exhaustion born of stress, deprivation, and that good ol' stand-by of combat fatigue-- that he can even begin to conjure the memory of Tony's weight beside him. An arm slung with self-conscious carelessness about his waist, the warmth of a solid and companionable shoulder.
'I'm house-broken?' Steve replied faintly and, while he would later discover she was prodigiously intelligent and amazingly adroit in navigating academic politics, it was her unaffected laughter that endeared her to him, putting him at ease.
If he can just keep everything right, everything ready and waiting in Tony's inner sanctum, then this mistake may yet be rectified. 'Do-overs, do-overs!' they'd call in the play yard. It's stupid, so stupid-- didn't he get bawled out more than once for telling the bigger boys there were no 'take-backs'? He can't help it, though, and the legal limbo Tony had the foresight to contrive for the protection of his company and inventions only bolsters that belief. Afghanistan, Gulmira, the mansion a crumbling fireball as it fell off the Malibu cliff… people have counted Stark out only to eat their own words.
A/B/O fics kind of… invalid? ^^'' I enjoy reading them, I just never thought they'd be in my repertoire. Apparently I missed a memo somewhere.
It is in the process of his intimate ablutions that a thought occurs to Steve-- one which should have been immediately apparent the moment his mind began to clear. The events of the past several days may be hazy and ephemeral, but their
He's already tested the grieves pretty thoroughly and-- while still definitely metallic-- the material has a sort of flexible adherence to the skin it binds, something he has never encountered before. (He'll need a sample of that, too.) Given the atypical nature of his imprisonment, it's unlikely his chance for a break will come by conventional means and, while he's still fairly confident (seventy three-- perhaps as much as seventy eight percent!) the others will look for him, Tony Stark does not

The very thought of his own life so carelessly and unwittingly avoiding intersecting with his mate's fills Steve with a sense of visceral repugnance, quite at odds with the fact he isn't certain intellectually that he wishes to be bonded at all. The dual beliefs (
Steve's throat is constricting in a way that can only be remedied by his Tri-Ox pills, but even that thought only summons a coil of hysterical laughter trapped in his gut. Isn't that the old chestnut-- that an omega need have no fear of pregnancy if only they held a capsule between their knees?
have been pressured into giving 'private shows'. Nor is it uncommon for guests to bring beta companions-- not into the public dining or entertainment areas, of course, but to chambers such as the one he and Tony are utilizing now. It's all there, writ large in a lascivious wink or the tap of a few deca-credits into someone's personal PADD, as ubiquitous and transparent as the air they breathe.
It's true. Steve always turns back to face the enemy, whomever that might be. Now it takes perhaps ten seconds for the wounded puzzlement washing acid-hot through the bond to penetrate a lifetime of habit, reminding him that the grip he faces at present is not adversarial at all. Even then, he only tempers his struggles to avoid harming Tony (all else aside, Rogers does possess a mean right hook) rather than acquiescing entirely.
Nor is he alone in his intense vulnerability. As if to emphasize this, Tony takes the artist's hand, guiding it beneath the breast his robe and pushing the sapphire fabric aside.
Whatever anyone on the outside might think, Steve has never seen a reason to be unhappy with the life he and Bucky lead. Sure, he's wanted more sometimes, but doesn't everyone? As a boy, he had wanted adventure, like the garbled tales of Old Earth his mother used to read to him, but there isn't much room for that in the Imperium. If he'd been of solid stock, like Bucky, they both might have signed up for an experimental colony-- rough living for betas only as they toiled to make things decent for the population to follow. Everything about humanity's expansion has to be slow and methodical, the recruiting films say. Alphas make the plans, betas carry them out and, when all is said and done, omegas will be moved to ready-made worlds with no material difference from the one they've left.
The Avengers are in the midst of different epidemic-- one of absence. A rash of missing persons cases that has thus far been saved from public exposure due only to the very selective criteria for vanishment.
"I believe you," Rogers tells him, reinforcing this with an earnest nod. A part of him feels guilty-- for the inchoate accusation, the illicit knowledge from the bond, and his own statement of faith when he's not fully certain what they're talking about. It feels like a splinter in his own heart, though the protective shielding he developed long ago argues that only G-d can issue penalties for a person's private thoughts. Perhaps that explains the old aphorism, then: 'Alphas still your tempers, betas still your tongues but, in the stillness of omegas, G-d requires the sum.'
"I see my omega and I share the same nonstandard definition of 'fine'," Tony smiles, leaning in. From beneath decorously lowered lashes-- it's such an act Steve wants to laugh at himself-- Rogers tries to gauge if this is some incongruously jovial prelude to chastisement, stiffening in spite of both intention and discomfort. Only a kiss lands on his cheek, dry but ardent as the very first caress. "We speak the same language."
. While they take place in the same universe, each can be read on their own. This thing just bit into my ankle and wouldn't let go.
-- like Steve are still rare. Right now, Tony is getting his first look-- by no means objective just yet-- at his mate: gangly, sharp-shouldered, possessed of boney chest and protruding ribs that make him look perpetually half-starved no matter much food Bucky surreptitiously moves onto his plate. His palms are too big, fingers slender enough to favor artistic pursuits and, while he is considered of surprisingly acceptable… intimate size for a beta, such endowments are considered too much to make for an attractive omega. The less said about the width of his hips in relation to successful birthing, the better.
Something shutters in Stark's interior castle then, a slamming echoed in his expression, though it seems the blocking of shadow than a refusal of illumination. Steve can't help but think of Old Earth ruins, the labyrinthine and often incomprehensible structures of pre-Burn civilization which were always said to be tenanted by atomic wraiths. The current world has no tradition of ghosts-- a thousand years of carefully designed civilization on a previously uninhabited world is hardly conducive to such things.
"Second of the ten-day," is the absent reply. The businessman is already playing quick, clever fingers over the touch screen, no doubt checking stocks, messages, news alerts, and any of the other myriad aspects of connectivity that compose his professional life. Vaguely, Steve marvels over the juxtaposition of this consummate business stag with the flagrant libertine portrayed by the media, but a greater part of him is focused on a more prosaic surprise. The Church keeps a more traditional calendar-- supposedly a hold-over from Old Earth-- but Rogers is used to seamlessly translating between it and secular time-keeping. The last date he remembers is nine of the ten-day, always a hectic time at the club, comparable to the old Saturn's Day frenzies of Pre-Burn chronology. Now here he is with Tony, three days later, with only a directionless and sensual fugue to show for his missing time.
The thought makes him chuckle, a sound thankfully light on hysteria. It's the sort of odd-ball, half-irreverent humor that makes him feel more settled-- a 'what-can-you-do-about-it' whistling in the dark. Moving perhaps a bit gingerly, he avails himself of said lavatory and then even the bidet. Normally the latter might seem like just another facet of decadence, but he's grateful for the lukewarm water, washing himself with his typical detachment. It doesn't quite work, though, no matter how diffident his own touch remains. While there's no actual pain, he does have areas of undeniable hyperawareness, muscles pleasantly sore in a way he would not have credited without experiencing it himself. The remnant sensitivity carries its own vague eroticism; tantalizing, ghostly caresses to his core, his nipples (which Tony subjected to the most assiduous, loving torture), and the bonding scar on his neck. The latter throbs deliciously when brushed by the robe's collar, but Steve has avoided examining it-- either by his own touch, or in the mirror. This new sensuality is already making his body feel like an odd contrivance he's somehow piloting. There's no reason to reinforce such delusions by lingering over that which so blatantly marks him as no longer his own. They speak of 'self-possession', of getting ahold of one's self, but an omega belongs to their alpha alone.
While the Grandmaster hardly runs a brothel, Steve knows for a fact that a few of the more lithesome and convincing chorus
Tony tells himself he's being overly critical of his present abductors. So what if the outré stone walls gleam and issue light while denying themselves as the source, now and then rippling as if with some vegetable sentience? He's uncomfortable, yes, but also unmarked-- there have been no vengeful beatings or applications of 'motivational' pain. In the distressingly varied annals of 'The Abductions of Tony Stark', these particular kidnappers aren't rating very high so far. Perhaps they're inexperienced, or from a more obscure school of torture. He snorts and chuckles to himself at the notion of breaking down 'information extraction' methodologies like movements in art. The Classicists, heavy on the fists, boots, and tooth-extractions; the Baroque adherents with splattered blood-play and iron maidens; the Modernists with their mind-games, water-boarding, and machine guns.
The endearment, show and cavalier though it may be, settles like a searing ember in the omega's loins. Tony has bestowed endless pet names on him in the last few days, from the fairly prosaic ('sweetheart', 'darling') to the puzzlingly eccentric ('cream-drop'? 'sugar-blossom'? and what the hell is a 'gummy-puff'?). As long as none of them involve the word 'little', Rogers supposes he can take them in stride. He's more accustomed to well-meaning insults as signs of affection-- being a beta, at least within one's own social class, is like being a member of a rowdy extended family. Amongst their own, betas are the world's put-upon herdsmen, shaking their heads over the other polymorphisms and commiserating about life in the trenches.
"Honey," Tony tells him with no small amount of pride, "I have a skim-shuttle. We can be in Hu'Maliwo in forty-five minutes."
His distress-- if not the cause itself-- must be evident, for Tony makes a gentle crooning noise, smiling apologetically. "I've been lying here for almost an hour," Stark confesses, "looking at you and trying to think of something charming or clever to say." He rolls his dark eyes in odd self-deprecation. "Preferably both-- I have a reputation to uphold."
His friends and colleagues reach out to him but Steve, though perfectly aware he is not the only one devastated by Tony's death, can only ape the appearance of reaching back. Yes, I'm coping; I'll find you if I need to talk. I know it's a process, I know it takes time; things will get better, etcetera, etcetera, amen.
amongst betas other polymorphisms just don't understand. Betas enter and leave existence alone; no 'perfect match for them, be it genetic or spiritual. G-d's gift to their sex is that of choice. They can make a pact in full possession of their faculties; '
"Yes," Steve replies simply, which is apparently enough for the alpha to draw him in tightly, taller form bowing over the smaller. Tilting his face up, relieved at the all-encompassing embrace and the knowledge they are at least united in honesty and confusion, the omega finds himself once more staring at the lazy drifting of the impartial fish above. Mostly to himself, he says, "Those really aren't helping."
' was his mother's more philosophical approach, accompanied by a heavenward roll of her eyes when people pointed at them on the street. '
that fly between continents, between galaxies bridged by a rip in space and time. If Steve's strike team now consists of a 'god', two former spies, a giant green rage monster, and a married couple who can each change size at will… well, it's easier to summon belief (or at least the suspension thereof) for _that_ than it is to face some of the future's less savory aspects. Wars fought no longer just between nation-states, but with shadowy ideologies that bleed over borders; diseases like AIDS; ebola and anthrax cooked up in labs.
"Water!" Stark says, as though a student shouting out the answer in class. "May I get you some water?"
"Do you think we have time before the next wave of…" the omega waves his hand vaguely, unable to think of a term that isn't either embarrassingly clinical or so steeped in beta patois as to be unintelligible to outsiders.
- slang term in this universe for a beta or younger alpha in 'drag' as an omega, basically creating the only 'opportunity' alphas have been pre- or extra-marital affairs.
How many low and crumbling walls did they lean against, he and his men, listening for footsteps or goddamn horse-hooves in the distance? All those tins of food from the ruins of houses and not one can-opener between them. Fucking spoiled, Morita said, and then showed them how to do it using a knife *without* cutting off their fingers. And on the remaining brick, there was often peeling paint-- everything from advertisements for chemist's remedies to war propaganda or KILLROY WAS HERE.
Rogers strokes the other man's hair out of deep and inexplicable kinship, focusing on the silky texture and his own evening respiration. His lungs tingle with remnants of the mist and he tips his head back, savoring all the little ways his body relaxes after an attack. As a child, he'd sometimes thought of the tales of changelings after the Burn: the scrawny creatures Ruin-folk produced in those rare instances radiation did not render them sterile. It was supposedly the aim of all debased tribes to find some pure human infant unattended and secretly make an exchange since, while not as healthy uncorrupted normal babies, changelings did look remarkably similar in their early lives. It was only as they matured that their abhorrent nature became unmistakable, and Steve remembers carefully examining his own body in the brief privacy of their small bathroom, looking for tumors, toes growing into hooves, buboes, or any of the other myriad signs of degeneration. He passes his tongue over dry lips, thinking how funny childhood fears are… and the backhanded way they sometimes come true.
Steve experiences one of those absurd upwellings of affection so mythologized in bonding romances: a sense of rightness at odds with the raw facts of his situation, a rush of comfort and warmth. It goes a long way towards dispelling the slow, icy panic clawing at his spine, and so he welcomes it. Whatever else, Tony has been a kind and considerate mate throughout the bonding heat-- the blazing kaleidoscope of broken recall still leaves no doubt of that.
The secondary lights flicker on as he enters, rendering the vast space as a sketch of gray charcoal on paper in only slightly lighter shade. Though clearly decommissioned, the place is dustless and unsheated. It is not a tomb but time capsule, everything spotless and just where Tony left it, standing in defiance of the days and months that have passed. Here, Steve can pretend the 'sleep' mode is temporary, that the master of ceremonies is in Malibu, Tokyo, London, or somewhere amidst the many-times-redrawn map of Europe. Sitting on the ratty couch which still smells of grease and (more faintly) an expensive cologne whose name he cannot pronounce, the captain can imagine Stark's insufferable and incongruously endearing vindication when he helps himself to the small stash of liquor stored nearby. The cabinet-- if the deco-cubist's nightmare can be called such a thing-- is programed to permit access only when all machinery has been shut down, and he was once certain it would open only for Tony. That doesn't seem to be true, and the inventor took such delight in those rare moments Steve relaxed enough to drink that he doubts his lover would begrudge him now. He can sip from the stock of Vat 69 for its taste alone
"Pep, I have to go." The words are uttered by some being outside the swirl of madness. Then his name again, much louder, as though from all directions-- within, and without. "Steve," Tony says, the tolling of a remorseful bell, "I'm sorry, but I'm coming in."
"Good morning," Tony replies, stroking his mate's hair just once more, this time with a single and almost tentative finger. He seems both encouraged by the polite greeting and somewhat at a loss. The latter is not surprising. When he'd come to the Grandmaster's Alpha Club, the industrialist would only have expected free-flowing drink, drug, and entertainment-- certainly not a random
Steve recalls kissing it frantically as he laid against Tony's chest, distressed almost as if the wound were fresh. Knot anchored in his mate, Stark had soothed the omega soberly. Not a hint of the humor or cavalier wit which so characterized his public persona, only a solemnly repeated promise, '
is concrete. Iron-clad, the age-old story; and iron-cold are the tendrils of realization-- bedecked with innumerable thorns-- which unfurl with slow horror from Roger's subconscious, where the seed has been waiting.
'Watch him for me, will you?' Stark asked, already moving away. 'I know it's safe to leave him with you!'
Hardly an ideal omega trait-- Steve recognizes that, but can't and won't apologize for it. He is who he has always been. A few days of sound mating and biological reclassification aren't going to change that. "I don't have any training," he remarks after a beat, deciding to let the bald facts speak for themselves. "I thought I was a beta and, even if I hadn't, it's not as though Brook's Village has a legion of etiquette instructors."
The notion of breakfast has an astonishing effect on Steve, as if the mere mention of food is all his stomach required to roar to famished life. Someone must have hastily stocked the chamber with fruits, cheese, and vitamin cakes before ushering the newly bonded couple inside-- he can still see the detritus on the nightstand, and vaguely remembers licking sweet juices from Tony's fingers while the alpha fed him pieces of a fruit whose center was like a violet star. The 'provider instinct' at work, though Roger is lucky the unidentified offering didn't turn out to be once of his yet-unknown allergies.
Flinching inwardly, Steve realizes he has his arms crossed over his chest, less a gesture of modesty or coquetry than sheer combativeness. If Tony notices, or subjects his mate to any sort of evaluating gaze at all, he gives no sign, instead reaching into a nearby bureau for the complimentary robes stocked by the chamber-staff. Like everything else at the Grandmaster's establishment, the selection is even more gaudy than it is luxurious; concoctions of velvet with plush quilted lining, wispy satin delicacies shot through with metallic thread or brilliants. Shrugging into a mantle adorned with predatory birds, the alpha hands Steve a similar one done in crimson and gold, rooting amongst their discarded clothing with his free hand. When he triumphantly holds up a holopane, the smaller man leans forward eagerly, absently pushing up the robe's long satin sleeves.
were fabulous, and Rhodey-- in the tones of the perpetually burdened-- told Stark to please stop saying 'fabulous'. Technically homeless (okay, between unexploded domiciles) Tony had lasted two days in a mansion-less Malibu before retreating to one of his bolthole labs in Arizona. It was temporary, he told Pepper; just until the Tower was finished, he assured Rhodey, still working on all sorts of gadgets for you and yours.
The liquid surrounding him barely qualifies as such. A gelatinous gray mixture, clear as glass and slippery as intestines pulled from some live and bleeding form, it bears down upon him with unexpected weight. Shifting position is out of the question, for he's been arranged so that his feet are propped flat against the vat-wall behind him. His achilles tendon has already filed a complaint. The height to which his restraints are drawn forces him to stand on his knees, with no give that would allow him to climb to his feet even if the substance didn't provide so much resistance. It squelches, it splashes and sloshes in every onomatopoetic aspect of water, but its as heavy as cement. There's a feeling of
who pushed that precipitous nuke into the portal which so mysteriously and spontaneously opened over Fort Lee, New Jersey. Pushed it through and made it back before the gates slammed, only to fall…)
Regardless, it makes Stark's already handsome face seem younger, almost boyish. Tony, Rogers corrects inwardly. His mate had not wanted to be addressed as 'alpha'-- he insisted Steve say his given name, over and over, even when that wicked tongue was making articulation rather difficult. After taking Steve's kisses, what Tony seemed to want most of all was the name of his new omega. He'd said the sound of it tasted good, that
The therapist's response had been gentle-- too gentle to hide the scientific caution that motivated it. He needs to work on consciously work on integrating his experiences, she advised. Not only his recent loss, but his displacement and the 'new chapter' of his life as a whole. Given the amount of trauma he has experienced in a subjectively short amount of time, of course his mind would attempt to reject the entire series of events. It is never the less unhealthy to indulge such fantasies. A large part of Steve understands this line of reasoning-- even agrees with it, though his stomach churns when he considers it for any length of time, as though attempting to eject or sweat out poison. Yet a silver of his soul, the same one that allowed him the imagination to attempt survival in this new century, wants to continue arguing. To explain about intuition in the heat of battle, how artistic rules about perspective extend to reality, how some things are just fundamentally
"Thank you," is Steve's eventual response, in part to soothe the less-than-reasonable protectiveness common in newly-bonded alphas. It doesn't sound particularly placating, but the darkness edging around Stark's expression shows he too is aware of the clamorous world outside their borrowed chamber door. The inventor, of course, will have more fiduciary concerns to consider-- that, and his balance on the dizzying cat's cradle tightrope that is life in the corridors of Imperium power. You might be able to come up with a list of potential bondmates that present more of a political liability than himself, Rogers realizes, but it would be a short list, and it would take a while. His Ma would remind him to be himself, since 'people will think what they like no matter what you say'.
So here Steve stands, a war hero with that absurd prefix 'super', fresh out of astonishment and saddled with a second chance that, like the aged apples he and Bucky used to beg from the grocer, isn't quite as shiny as it seems on the outside. Bucky, Peggy, every single one of the Commandos-- gone.
"Pep, Pep," he can hear Tony saying, like some codeword or echo in a schoolyard game. Red Rover, Alpha-May-I. "When the transport's here, just put in on stand-by, I don't know--" Then, more distinctly, "Steve! Steve!," in a way that travels down the bond like the most industrious of winter winds, chill fingers always finding the slightest gap in threshold or window frame. Rogers shivers uncontrollably, though in truth he is flushed hot with his folly and his fear.
And, given Steve's physical weakness, what nearly took his mother's life will almost certainly take his.
Rogers refuses to be one of those people, someone who thinks that Tony would go down without a fight. He saw the body, performed just as expected at the funeral, responding appropriately to the hands placed gently on his arm, the half-hugs and fist-clasps of commiseration. He recalls staring at those people from behind his soldier's mask of stoic duty, how each visage-- known and unknown-- seemed like curious blotches of the abstract. One big Rorschach test. He doesn't know what he'll do when the time missing and mourning Tony eclipses the actual length of their companionship. He doesn't know what he'll do next month, next week, beyond the assignments SHIELD and Avenger's necessity lay out for him. It's all one foot in front of the other, one more breath as you struggle and the cockpit fills with the sea.
It sounds phenomenally stupid, certainly nothing he'd put in the incident report Natasha will undoubtedly bully him into writing, despite the fact SHIELD no longer exists. (Independence from government interference should mean independence from bureaucratic paperwork too, but no one ever listens to him.) Most likely, she'll delegate the task of wrangling him to Steve, who cannot even lower himself to bully his own coworkers like any decent commander-cum-office-manager should. Instead, the Captain merely radiates expectation, vague resignation, and a sort of wistful tolerance until Tony complies just to prove he can occasionally be responsible and, for G-d's sake, Steve, just stop
Though the Captain had given no great outward sign of distress, Fury had dismissed him after the official SHIELD review exceeded a dozen replays of the footage. There'd been bile in Steve's throat then, the old insistence that he could take anything the world threw at him, conquered for the first time by an icy wave of loss. Grief was cold, the howling of winds along steel trestles and amongst embers that, while snuffed and dying, still smelled of human flesh. Arctic waves that broke through every barrier, stealing breath and time.
Tony stills abruptly, but his withdraw is slow-- a feat of applied will. His look is a searching one, though he keeps his arms about the omega, who himself makes no attempt to leave. In fact, Steve laces his fingers at the base of Stark's neck once more, all the while wondering if the alpha will come to resent him for the sway he now holds. Perhaps this is the power for which omegas are punished, the daily measures of protection and limitation a way of extracting payment for this period of inversion. The least of all polymorphisms, able to destroy their masters with a look or a touch. Even alphas who bond for political reasons, with no imperative and far milder heats, know the threat is out there.
"If the next word out of your mouth is 'adorable', we're going to have a problem," Steve informs him mulishly, focusing on the robe's irksome sash even as his face heats again.
Each morning, Steve Rogers wakes to do battle. His foes-- regardless of any actual villainous activity-- are many and varied. Beginning, of course, with those deceptive layers of forgetfulness which come to work their attrition while he sleeps.
What Steve finds there-- first by blind touch and then by alarmed investigation-- should not surprise him. Yet, because his mind is experiencing the most clarity it has enjoyed since he dressed for work on nine of the ten-day, shock strikes him afresh. It is as though ground-lightning has fastened on his fingertips, traveling ominously to his core  to kindle primal concern for his bonded. In a flash of agonizingly intimate detail, he recalls his own worried and inarticulate fussing when he'd truly first encountered it during their mating. As they'd grasped each other eagerly, each as desperate to learn the other's body as one memorizing a treasure which may be stolen away, he had come upon this… the scar on Tony's chest.
naked, an intoxicating scent cresting over him in waves, alien, inescapable, and yet familiar as his own skin.
"Shut up, shut up," Stark says with surprising ferocity. For all their vehemence, the words lack heat, leading Steve to believe the anger and negation are not aimed at him. If Tony has complaints to lodge with the Almighty, he may need to get in line. "Don't say things like that." As if to reinforce this, the alpha kisses his bondmate's fingers. Roger's bony digits are still wrapped tightly around the vial of pills, yet Tony touches them with lips as reverent as a believer kissing the ring of the Hierophant in New Rome.
"Yeah!" he calls back, bracing himself against the marble sink, palms flat and arms locked straight at the elbows. No, no, don't tense up! "I've got this!"
His recollections, the stirring of his loins in eroticism and shame (some of the things they'd done--! If the acts
Then, abruptly, there is nothing to struggle against. The alpha unhands his mate, and they stare at one another for several long, protracted moments while their chests heave in tandem for separate reasons entirely. The bond vibrates with emotionally charged color/scents which do not echo the expression on Tony's face-- or at least the way Rogers would have interpreted it without added psychic insight. What he sees is a look of astonishment and concern tempered by the self-assurance that pervades the features of any fortunate stranger to defeat, and something Steve might have labeled irritation. What he
. The eye traces a plane, an archway, and skitters away nauseously, repelled. It's out of alignment somehow. Not by much, but Tony is an expert in disciplines were a little error can go a very long way. If the… dissonance… were any greater here, it might drive one crazy. The whole thing certainly _sounds_ crazy but, now that the thought has solidified, it cannot be escaped. Reality dangling by a nail, ever-so-slightly askew, and perhaps hung someone who wouldn't know if the picture was upright in the first place.
The bond's intensity should ebb though, he thinks, inner voice unconsciously adopting the uniformly encouraging tone of EduComputers from his youth. They'll each get a handle on their own end, for practicality's sake at least. Sheer self-preservation. Stark certainly won't want his inexperienced, public-educated bondmate exposed to the plethora of sensitive information in the industrialist's mind. Perhaps comforted by the promise of future privacy, or even by his alpha's psychic solicitude, Steve watches his own pale, blue-tinged complexion begin to revive in the mirror, leaving a reflection that seems more familiar than anything he's seen so far this bizarre morning.
that term!) constitution. During his official classification as a beta, he'd been given all the clinical reasons why he was a genetic dead-end. He'd listened politely to the healer's apprentice, of course, though he could easily given the lecture chapter and verse himself. It was only what he'd heard from every teacher, healer, priest, and Church acolyte since he was old enough for schooling. Now the grotesque cosmic joke is perfectly, irrationally obvious: G-d, who supposedly knew better than to allow Steve's genes to spread, has in fact pulled the ultimate bait-and-switch.
s Reed Richards is likely inventing at present), he has lost any real sense of purpose which might once have justified the absurd fluke of seventy years on ice. For the boy who'd always scraped by, skin-of-your-teeth sick and eating peas on bread as a celebratory meal, there'd been no whirring time machine or dazzling portal. No sir, he got here the hard way. It was, perhaps, appropriate. Some might point out that he's already gotten one short-cut-- a body he never worked for. 'You,' Colonel Phillips had once told Doctor Erskine, when he'd thought their lab subject was out of earshot, 'are already shooting for a miracle, and now you've put your money on the runt of the guinea pig litter!'
He is not a Man Out of Time, though the media has delighted in that sobriquet ever since the Avengers found him. He has Time in abundance; or rather, a great deal of it has accumulated around him, leaving him untouched. They marvel at him, the glittering and fast-paced people of this brave and unpredictable new world, constantly asking him to affirm the wonders and progress of their modern age. And would they likely stick him in an exhibit next to Piltdown Man if they thought they could get away with it? Brother, you'd better believe it!
Seconds slip by as in a lava hourglass whose neck is too narrow, dollops protracting into grotesquely elongated tears. Managing perhaps only three breaths in the interim, Steve is immeasurably relieved by Tony's return, gaze riveted on the life-saving vial held in those strong, elegant fingers. Perhaps only twice the circumference of a stylus and small enough to disappear entirely in Bucky's fist (though not quite so swallowed by Steve's), the container is made of a pale durasteel that, despite the material's known longevity, still has enough wear to betray omnipresence in its owner's life. The day Rogers received it has passed out of memory, lost with the day he first learned to toddle or grasp things in a tiny, pudgy hand. The stopper is attached by a short chain, the only 'ornament', save where his initials are inexpertly stained along the side. The last bit is Steve's doing, using a laser pen and cobalt flame-dye-- one of the many amateur skills he's picked up in a long string of woefully short machining jobs. The vial has been tossed, kicked, stepped on, and given the old heave-ho into puddles only slightly more often than Steve himself, but it is the tiny, chalky capsules within the watertight tube that are truly dear.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. If you could take a moment to comment and let me know what you think, I'd be forever in your debt! (And yes, this would involve sprinkles. ^_~)
is fading. It summons old memories of loss few nowadays would understand; old locks of hair, pocket watches and lockets rusted shut, photographs of infants whose hasty arrangements could not disguise the fact that they were already dead. The world Steve has arrived in has its share of medical horrors, blights so potent they are confined to acronyms and monikers like HIV and the "Big C", but the sheer mortality rate is nothing to what laid with his generation. Death cheek-to-jowl in your bed, next to the mashed potatoes at supper, in the very real timorousness of 'Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep'. Polio, influenza, diphtheria, pellagra-- fevers in yellow, scarlet, and typhoid variety! The lurid monsters of his childhood are allnow little more than footnotes in medical texts, and all around this new century the smell of antibacterial tinctures not quite dispelled by their floral/berry top notes.
like worried pacing. Aimless fretting, the way Steve himself sometimes feels inside. Stepping past that circle, like some grammar school chalk game, the captain comes to stand before the 'bot, unlit and unmoving on the charging platform. He gets down on his hunches to pet what Tony nominally treated as Dummy's 'head', and it seems then that exhaustion clamps around him all at once, just as night would suddenly revert to true darkness after a mortar barrage.
Feeling useless, every inch archaic, Steve paces in Tony's old play-land. He should sleep-- he's been up seventy-two hours and, while his tolerance of prolonged wakefulness is impressive, there's a reason Coulson and Jan bullied him back to the Tower. There's nothing he can do right now, without an enemy to outwit or a fortress to storm. Their present operation is still in the investigative phase, largely in the all-too-qualified hands and minds of Hank, Bruce, and even Reed. All the same, still he cannot shed the sense of wrongness, of inaction and alienage clinging to his skin.
"I suppose we should get out of bed," Tony agrees belatedly, harkening back to an earlier part of the conversation as though the last few minutes simply haven't happened. "I'm not so foolish as to think we're completely out of the woods yet, but we should make arrangements while we can." He rolls off the high mattress with ease, looking back at his mate inquisitively. "Unless you'd like to finish the heat here?"
Every day for almost two weeks, Steve has entered the SHIELD conference room designated as their C&C to face the blind yet somehow accusing stares emanating from the massive main screen. The tally is up to eight disappearances-- two more than when the mystery first came to their attention. Given that the first few cases had intervals of several months between them, the frequency is picking up at an alarming rate. Each face is that of someone taken without warning, snatched on some mundane errand with not a lick of evidence left in their wake. Adam Brashear, who disappeared in the 52 meter breezeway between canteen and laboratory at JPL. Mark Cadmon, respected neurosurgeon and responsive prosthetics pioneer, who disappeared on a path in Yellowstone National Park when his wife briefly turned away to take a picture. Bobbi Morse, up-and-coming biology graduate student at Cambridge, whose friends lost track of her in a crowded bar-- no indication on CCTV that she ever left via the building's single exit, but absent all the same. A biochemist, a programmer, the mastermind behind an enormous internet startup company, an Air Force pilot rumored to be in the running for the first manned mission to Mars. An acoustic weapons specialist who never returned from taking out the trash; and Jane, who left Darcy for what should have been a five-minute check of equipment on the observatory's second tier.
[+] The other artist mentioned is Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The criticism is typical of his work, but I still like him. ;-)
Time, and Molecule Man's solipsistic plotting, would show him what he had perhaps already known only in his gut. Beyond the shock and necessity of maintaining focus in a combat situation, had he been angered by the deception which-- though Tony had no way of knowing-- had caused so much turmoil within his own being? He'd been led towards false assumptions as surely as Sister Marie Patrice once guided his cursive, hand-over-hand. That the
but it's actually too late now. Rejection, if it were possible at all given the apparent strength of their connection, would have taken place in the initial scenting phase. Rogers rationalizes the fluttering sensation of being
There are two more photos, damning and separated from the rest, as if to prevent contagion. Leonard Samson and Helen Cho, two more great intellectuals, ornaments in their chosen fields-- psychology and endocrinology respectively-- greatly mourned by friends and loved ones. Having vanished before anyone connected the incidents, they are the only two victims ever recovered. Some mercy, that-- so small it can dance with the angels on the head of a pin. Both were found between six and eight weeks following their disappearances, laid out in an area of atypically high magnetic activity and radiation fluctuation, within ten miles of their last known location. Each was missing some odd item of clothing-- socks gone while shoes were present, bra missing while the shirt was still in place. To make matters worse, their autopsies were as identical as they were bizarre: each dead only a few days, bodies frozen solid in defiance of logic and weather. More baffling still, all natural fluids-- including the vitreous-- had been drained. What little moisture medical examiners did find existed on the cellular level, accompanied by minute traces of a colorless and unidentifiable 'gel' in the lungs and/or stomach cavity.
