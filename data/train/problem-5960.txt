A long moan ripped through the air, when Tony shoved his mouth so deep onto Steve’s cock that Steve felt his head brushing the back of Tony’s throat. Steve’s hands trembled with a combination of self-loathing and arousal. His hands were on Tony’s shoulders—he could’ve stopped this moments ago. Tony’s body was muscled enough, but they both knew he wouldn’t stand a chance against Steve’s strength. And yet… this wasn't something he’d felt before. Nothing even close to this. Tony was swirling his tongue around him, before pushing his mouth so far down on him as it would go. A hand had busied itself with Steve’s testicles and it was damn hard to form a decent thought.
“Then how was it? Explain it to me!”
It was a message. From the future. From his
Tony let his forehead drop against the moist shower wall. He hated feeling so insecure, but what would happen if the one thing that had brought them together was gone? Maybe if he had the chance to see those flashbacks for himself, maybe if he knew what Steve knew, he’d be able to keep this.
“I’m not sure it’s working,” Tony was saying. “The numbers seem good, but nothing is happening.”
Tony shook his head, standing up. “I’m taking the tent,” he announced. “It’s too crowded here either way. Split the beds however you want.”
are you?” Steve asked.
Ian took that moment to yawn adorably, and the disgruntled expression that followed sent everyone to another cooing-fit.
When everyone was gone, there was a long beat of silence, and then careful, measured steps. Tony took a deep breath and stood up, stretching a bit before he turned around to meet Steve’s thoughtful gaze.
Well, Steve thought as he stared after him. Maybe it shouldn’t be as surprising… how fast things could settle back to how it had been before. With the two of them taking opposing directions as soon as they were given the chance.
he'd done it. He was feeling uneasy as well, but the magnitude was vastly different.
“What are you talking about?” Maria asked, looking confused, and yeah, great—at least
A sigh. “He’s getting better.”
“What the hell even happened there?” Clint asked. “Did you find Barnes?”
Oh God, how the guy could be fifty percent Dalai Lama, and fifty percent swooning schoolboy, Tony would never understand.
… but what I’ve done—it’s unforgivable.”

"It can be ‘sleek and graceful’ however much you want, but it's still made of the strongest alloys you can make in your shop and I
Eight hours and nine minutes, but it wasn’t like he was counting.
“You can’t go around telling yourself that every wrong move you make might destroy the world. It’ll drive you nuts. You have a responsibility to try and do good, just as much as every other man. Not more. Don’t do this to yourself. You deserve to try and have what you want. And you want Rogers, don’t you?”
Steve blinked, his brow furrowing as he fought to pull his thoughts together. “The shooter,” he started, twisting in his seat. “The one at our apartment.”
It was a bit worrisome how the simple thought of Steve as an actual Captain could turn him on so effortlessly. At one point, Steve had been in military uniform, doing military things with military determination, all focused and combat-ready and uncompromising and…
“Tony… the baby’s crying,” Steve said, his eyes big and unsure.
Steve perked a brow. “When was the last time you had a good night’s sleep?”
The ground seemed to rumble beneath Steve’s feet. And if he listened very carefully, he could almost imagine Stark Mansion sighing happily just to have the name of its old mistress in the air once more.
“Duly noted,” Clint said and reached behind himself.
And whoever
Tony hummed. “So… we’re on the same team again?”
The man, a blond guy with nice-enough features, cast him a smile that rang just a little bit strained. He shook his hand with a strong grip. “Don’t worry about it.” He closed his mouth, his eyes wandering intensely over Tony’s face, before he cleared his throat. “Hope he isn’t sick?”
Steve’s brows furrowed. Tony made it sound as if Ross wasn’t already up and about, constantly looking for affiliates to support his campaign. As Secretary of State, he was very busy raising counter-arguments on Bucky’s impending acquittal. He didn’t argue on Bucky’s mind-control, which—strangely enough—only made it worse, but instead he tried to make it seem as if the Avengers were an uncontrollable force in itself, doing as much harm as they did good.
The sun had yet to rise on the horizon, but frankly, the next day couldn’t start soon enough. It had been a hell of a night, and now all he wanted to do—all he craved for—was call Tony and then get a few hours of sleep. But these things were too few and far between, even on a normal day. Any planning he did was second only to what Fury would say in regard to all this. He did not like to doubt his good intentions, but Fury was a spy first and foremost.
The air between them stilled. As did Rhodey’s expression.
And yet, there Tony was. Clearly a figment of his imagination, and yet strangely real.
“Yeah,” he retorted coldly, staring at the ground. “Take it from me, things don’t always go as planned. In fact, if you take a look at a random chapter out of my non-written memoirs, things usually end up going to shit.”
Tony stilled, then resumed his work. It was a little bit of a struggle for him to get his fingers beneath the lacings; they were a bit smoldered, but eventually he got them all loosened enough to pull off the uniform easily.
“No,” Steve admitted, then hesitated just a second. “Um, I was Justin Hammer’s assistant for a while, so I was familiar with his weapon’s designs and his daily affairs.”
Tony felt him pressing an ardent kiss to his forehead. He smiled. “Yeah. I know.”
“How much we have to be thankful for,” Wanda replied with a smile, wrapping a hand around Pietro’s. “For a moment I thought I had lost you.”
“I do,” Steve said. Weirdly enough, even with his beefy shoulders, he looked almost dwarfed in the large bathroom.
"How did this even happen?" Wanda asked, seemingly ready to forget all about the meeting in favor of talking this through. She was still not a hundred percent happy about working for Tony, but without her brother to anchor her, she was on uneven grounds, and even though the team had been working together for a while, she still felt like an outsider.
Tony cleared his throat uneasily. “She left. Said she needed some sleep, but I figure she wants a bit more time.”
“We should be fine, as far as I can tell. There’s a twenty to twenty-five feet layer of debris above our heads, and it should all be removable without much of a problem. I, uh… think they’ll be able to find us in three hours. Four, maybe.”
“Did I what?”
“That’s the hottest thing that ever happened to me,” he admitted quietly. “And that’s saying something...”
“Why do you think he spent so much time here?” he asked Steve. “Away from home? Why do you think he twitches every time Stark Mansion is mentioned? His wife
Realizing that, Tony opened his eyes all the way. That weight on his waist was an arm that was wrapped around his middle and his legs were somehow tangled in Steve’s. They were spooned together tightly on the floor, a thin white blanket draped over their bodies.
, then stared into the distance.
Tony just hugged him back, gaze wide and imploring. Every single one of his nerve endings was buzzing with jubilation and relaxed bliss. “Me, too.” he said, glancing at the side of his face. “I know that my attempt at… wooing you has been… well, ‘pretty crappy’ comes to mind, but if you have another term—”
What if this was the rest of the 82%?
When he settled in his bed with the too-soft mattress, his eyes were so heavy he fell asleep the second his head hit the pillow.
think.”
It likely wouldn’t be easy to change one’s modus operandi. It was one thing to know that they could be good together, and another entirely to figure out how to get there.
So Tony tugged off his shirt next, and opened his belt without taking his eyes off of Steve. He couldn’t help but grin, cocking his head. “Any surface is fine, really.”
Slowly, he pulled on the finished suit, then stared at his reflection for a few dazed minutes. He barely recognized himself and silently wondered what Bucky would think of him now.
When Tony boarded his private jet the next morning, the phone in his back pocket vibrated. He flipped it open and looked down on the display, a smile tugging at his lips.
Tony leaned a bit closer, looking at him. “So. Do you like your new rooms?”
Steve nodded harshly, his racing mind determined to keep up with every sensation. Faster was good. Faster was infinitely good. He focused on the wet slide of their erections and, at the same time, the look on Tony’s face. The way he moaned and melted into him—the way his tongue danced with Steve’s as their lips moved together. Tony always kissed Steve like he was starved, and Steve was the only one who could quench his thirst.
“Good thinking.” He didn’t say anything for long moments, his eyes travelling slowly across Vision’s features. At first, his expression was very composed, almost detached. Then, it suddenly became very vulnerable.
* * *
Tony closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind. Something wasn’t quite right about all of this. That much he got. Something was up, that was why Steve had decided that fleeing was his only option, that he even had to call in reinforcements, and Tony just hadn’t figured it out yet.
“One more time, Stark, I dare you—”
There was a blast of air, and the next thing Steve knew, he was knocked to the ground. While he hadn’t seen anything, he knew enough about how it felt to be tackled by someone, and this had definitely been a person—male, probably.
Steve huffed, smiling at the skies. “So get ideas.”
* * *
“But,
‘We all miss him.’
"I try," Steve said in response, letting the tease linger before finally taking his hand from Tony's person and pulling back to assess his clothes. He wasn't sure how to get under all of that. The zipper at the front was pretty self explanatory but the rest of it…
“I know, but we’re going to start at the beginning.” Natasha smiled at him, ran a comforting hand down his back.
Steve laughed warmly, and laid a hand on Bucky’s shoulder, pulling him in for another a massive bear hug.
“Look,” Tony said, speaking right over her, because at the moment he couldn’t care less about her delicate sensibilities. “What did you expect, exactly? You made your standpoint
Tony lifted his head and stared down into Steve’s glistening eyes, his fingers sifting tenderly through the damp hair at his temples. “Alright?”
“It’s strange that Stark didn’t want to be here, after all of his fussing when they found you,” Natasha mused, and smiled when she noticed Steve staring at her in question.
But now… How could he hope to keep this when he wouldn’t even survive this war?
Tony nodded and a grin spread over his face.
“Inside. Time to go sleep it off.”
“This is nice,” Steve said softly, almost so low Tony couldn’t hear. He was probably afraid to say it. Braver this time, he added, “Talking with you. Like this.”
“No,” Steve said, then bravely kissed Tony for that look on his face. “But I want to make sure we’re doing it right. Got so much to make up to you.”
“Oh?” Pepper asked. “With whom?”
Gently, Steve pressed him down on their bed. Their kiss was fervent, passion-filled, and Tony used it to communicate all that he was feeling at that moment: hunger, need, joy at both of them being alive. And, more than anything else: love.
“I can make you feel so good,” Tony repeated, running his index finger over Steve’s shirt. “You never did this before, did you?”
Like a bull charging, the guy lunged for him. Steve readied himself for the attack, his hand, holding the shield, outstretched. The guy’s bulk of muscle and thick bone was astounding. The striking force of the Winter Soldier’s body was enough to send Steve stumbling backwards onto the floor again. Next to him, Bucky tumbled to the floor as well, seemingly unable to stop the momentum that carried him. He would have fallen onto Steve, if Steve had not quickly thrust one leg upward. His knee caught Bucky in the hollow of his back, and he heaved him out of the way before the soldier’s fist could hit him. Bucky rolled twice before he caught himself, pushing his boots into the ground and flipping himself upright. When Steve turned around, their opponents were already coming for them again.
Steve looked around. He’d been here once, in that room, he realized. That was Stark Mansion, wasn’t it? Tony had taken him there, a few weeks after their engagement. He’d wanted him to see the place where he’d grown up, and they’d spent hours upon hours looking at photographs, most of them with Jarvis and Tony, or Peggy and Tony, only rarely stumbling upon a picture where Howard—
“I assure you we don’t want Mister Stark any harm,” she said. “We just want to find out the truth.”
“Oh God, I’m gonna come,” Steve gasped. “God,
“On the other hand,” Tony said, bringing Steve back to the present. “Maybe you just need a bit of persuasion. I was told I can be very persuasive, and… you’re every bit the kind of guy I’d want, so…” He trailed off and wiggled his brows at Steve. The gesture was more goofy than suggestive, but Steve didn’t let his amusement show.
Tony hadn’t even opened his eyes, and the room was already spinning. One of those fast spins that made him claw for balance even before he was fully conscious.
“If they find him first, he gotta turn himself in.”
Tony sighed deeply, even as he stepped forward to help the robot out of its misery. And Steve smiled when he saw him petting the claw fondly.
The truth was that Tony had killed his wife, Steve thought miserably. The why’s and how’s wouldn’t matter to those people. Tony had killed her, and that was it. It wouldn’t matter to them that Indries had done everything in her power to push Tony into doing the unthinkable. And it wouldn’t matter that Stane only did what he did to get the company under his control, and use Tony’s inventions in any way he saw fit.
There was a sound that was probably meant to be a sigh, though it didn’t even come close to a human one.
“Tony?” Steve called, looking around.
“I don’t know,” he whispered, and it was surely the wrong thing to say, but it was the truth, and he’d made one promise to himself—that from here on out, Tony would only ever get the truth from him.
Natasha smiled, and there was visible tension in her shoulders. She glanced at Coulson, who nodded. “No,” she told Steve. “I have to make a short detour to Calcutta. But I’ll meet you there.”
“I take it you weren’t expecting me to visit?”
“It’s gotten worse in the last week. I ordered a few pain killers—homeopathic stuff,” Tony added hastily at Steve’s raised brow, “and toys and whatnot. Vi said he took the cake in this department, most of the time, it’s not that bad for babies.”
Steve stood up, turning on him with shaking hands. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he demanded, and it didn’t matter
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, as I said, I have work to do,” Tony announced, casting Steve a strained smile as he walked towards the door again. “Have a good trip, wherever you’re going.”
He gave Steve’s ass a light squeeze, then leaned up a bit, mouth now close to his ear. “What would you say if I told you I’m prepped and ready to go?”
God—It was only four years. How had he managed to get there in four short years? Convincing Steve to be with him, to marry him… just…
kid. It’s gonna be worth it.”
Steve fell on the ground, and it was harder and harder to stand up again. When he did, though, there was some small hesitation on Bucky’s part. They stared at each other, the storm outside making it somewhat difficult to hold their position, but neither of them moved.
In any case I invite you all to chat me up on Tumblr and discuss this with me if you feel the need, because I KNOW this is a different approach and one not all of you might like ... and if that's the case I hope you can overlook this part and still enjoy the upcoming Civil War installment. :-) Little Ian will now play a part in this verse, it's one of the few changes I decided to do because... let's be honest: Civil War with a baby? Heartbreaking. (However ... since I got so many asks: I intend for Civil War not to actually break any Stony hearts. It won't be all sunshine and butterflies, of course, but I love them too damn much to really do any permanent damage. If you survived this AoU fic, CW will be bearable, too. Pinky promise.)
The words completely floored Steve. “What?”
Fully prepared to lower the two of them to the kitchen floor and let Steve have his way with him right then and there, guests be damned, Tony’s eyes opened wide when Steve abruptly stopped his teasing and pulled back. “Hey!”
There was a little pause and Tony could almost see the gears turning in Steve’s head. “Natasha and Sam,” he said, eventually, putting the upmost professionalism into his voice, “you’ll come with me and Tony. Thor, you’ll take Clint and Bruce with you. Retrieve the wings, and come back to DC as fast as you can. We’ll all meet up at Fury’s checkpoint. Status reports only via our private servers.”
“No,” Steve blurted, his hands settling on Tony’s hips without much thought. “Just keep doing that.”
Blind? Tony frowned, not getting what Steve was talking about. In the last months, he’d thought of every possibility, every divergence of the Sokovia Act. How to work around it, which changes to make. And that Steve had the audacity to tell him he was blind was just—
Steve looked adorably put-out about being caught literally with his pants down, and Tony was
When neither moved and the silence stretched between them, Bucky shook his head. "So, how bad was it?" he asked, indicating the door. Steve only lowered his head, and said nothing.
kind of flirtation with a seventeen year old, no matter how experienced—more experienced than Steve—he clearly was. He cleared his throat and sent a grateful look towards Bruce. Of course, he wouldn't have let Tony's flirting get under his skin if he'd known. By now, he had enough practice with keeping students at a friendly teacher-student distance.
The smile on Steve's face turned softer, and he was genuinely happy to hear this. It meant more to Steve than Tony probably knew. Because it meant that Tony liked all of him, Captain America, but also the man under the uniform.
It made him wonder why he’d never had any trouble understanding Tony. Sure, in hindsight, he should’ve realized that Tony was no ordinary man—that something was special about him—but he’d never felt as lost around him as he did with most people here.
He also seemed to be in the middle of moving.
Tony’s eyes flickered back to their brown color. He stared at Steve as though he had just awoken from a horrible dream and his mouth opened and closed in a futile try to find the right words. “Steve…” he echoed, grabbing for his hands and pulling him nearer. “I didn’t
It was
There was no way he was sleeping in the same room as Tony tonight.
“We could always not go,” Tony offered meekly.
“We do now,” Steve said before he could think it through. The words were out his lips and he pressed his eyes closed, as if in pain. He shouldn’t have said that, Tony wouldn’t want for him to force his feelings on him and—
“You and Steve,” Natasha said with empathy, “you’re always taking the brunt force, it’s just who you are, so the least James and I can do is stay by your side, keep you sane without the other until you can be together again.”
“It’s called making amends,” Strange argued. “I met the Captain, once. And I do believe the two of you can choose a different path if you try.”
had ever looked at him that way.
“Yes?”
Steve didn’t pull his hand away. “Since you got here,” he started, and he didn’t look half as nervous as Tony expected him to be when talking about… this elephant they’d been tiptoeing around ever since arriving here. “Didn’t you ever wonder what could’ve been if things hadn’t gotten in the way?”
Tony didn’t know how long he sat in his workshop, simply staring down at his own hands.
“And… how? Does it hurt?”
Lowering the hand from his face, Steve set it firmly on Tony's shoulder and pushed him onto his back before shifting to rest some of his weight on top of him. He stared Tony in the eye for a brief moment, then shook his head, his eyes closing.
"When was it you met, exactly?" asked Betty, who was sitting next to Bruce.
This was it then. No more test-runs. No more idle twiddling. Together, he and Bruce would get Barnes out of wherever his mind was stuck. And maybe…
“I think today proves you don’t.”
Steve felt a sudden rush of bravado. Could it really be that Mister Stark was flirting with him? No. No, it wasn’t possible. Mister Stark wouldn’t be flirting with a
Teaching had gone by easy enough, his students as quiet and uninvolved as ever. Steve had tried to make the subject more appealing, really, but how many people out there could say they had a passion for history? And a specific subsection of it, for that matter, was all the more boring for them.
“Indries wasn’t afraid of anything,” Rhodey whispered. “But, Steve—”
“Two point five,” Tony mumbled, without taking his eyes from the road.
Tony leaned back in, running his tongue over Steve’s lower lip. “About time you admitted it.”
“We need to talk,” Steve said, and his stance had already eased a little, though his hold on Tony was unwavering. “You need to listen to me.”
“Now?”
Steve let his eyes travel all over Stark Mansion as Tony’s words echoed in his mind. This… this belonged to him now? It couldn’t be possible—not for someone like Steve, who’d never owned more than could easily be stashed in a small backpack.
“No,” Tony said. “But I know how to find him.”
Raising a hand, Tony scrubbed it over his forehead, sighing. “I’m… I just want to… apologize, for what I said about your friend yesterday. Don’t know if you remember—"
Steve didn’t have to look too closely to see that the tanks had been emptied. The liquid was halfway gone, pooled on the floor in front of them, but the figures inside the tanks were clearly… dead. Their slumped bodies half drifted in the water, half leaned against the glass containers. As far as he could see, there were no shot wounds, no sign of any violence. There was no way to see what had happened to them.
,” Tony said on a sob, and Steve was too aware that the rest of the room was deathly quiet. “You
He and Vision, they had grown close in the last couple of months. While there were distinct differences between Vision and JARVIS, it sure did feel like speaking with his old friend whenever Vision was around. True to his words, Jarvis was a part of Vision—just more.
It was always like this, Steve thought grimly, given the government’s propensity for exerting control over their initiatives. They weren’t likely to relinquish it now, even if Tony agreed to comply with their orders.
Tony frowned adorably. “I did?” he asked, then huffed dismissively. “Ugh. That’s your fault. It’s Bucky-here, Bucky-there all day, of course it caught up on me. Doesn’t mean anything.”
With that, they were gone, none of them sparing a backward glance.
“I know the window’s in the back is too small for you to climb out,” Steve called back, then set down on the sofa. “I’m not gonna leave.”
Another message appeared on his display.
Shaking his head against Tony's, Steve let him pull him down until they were both sitting there, on the workshop floor. He held on tight and closed his eyes. "It
He had
Something about this—and Tony blamed his exhaustion and general bad mood that he couldn’t put a finger on it—rang a bell in the back of his mind. Tony stared at the man, at his foreign face, and found he couldn’t place him at all.
— Andy Warhol
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Best buddy—You owe him—I get it. I’ll be back down in an hour.”
Steve wound an arm around Bucky. “We’ll see what Tony has to say to that once we get home.”
Steve sighed as he nodded. “First I have to find it.”
It was classic, it was simple, it had Steve’s tactical style written all over, but Tony had to admit that it worked out pretty well. They weren’t the bestest of buddies, aside from him and Bruce maybe, but they certainly clicked on the battlefield.
Sam’s expression suddenly shifted and he barreled forward without warning. For a moment, Tony thought he’d hit him, what with the way his eyes had widened and he had exhaled a sharp gasp. However, the next second, he pulled both arms around Tony’s chest and dragged him off to the side. Sam had used a bit too much power with his own repulsors, and together, they crashed into a nearby wall.
, Steve continued.
Perhaps he wasn’t alone, then, in this sudden feeling.
"Whatever you say, Tony."
“I officially forbid these words in this exact order,” Tony said, rubbing a hand over his face. “I’m
A gentle hand came to rest on his arm. There was a long silence, and then Rhodey said quietly, “It was Ross who insisted on that ultimatum—a mistake I didn’t see at that time either…”
Rising with a sigh, Tony scrubbed a hand over his face. Only then, he realized that while someone had taken the helmet off, he was still inside the suit. Staring at the left gauntlet, Tony’s head was throbbing its displeasure. “Just peachy,” he lied, only briefly glancing in Natasha’s direction. Her face was mostly impassive, but he’d known her for a whole long while now, and he spotted the little things that meant she was worried as hell.
“There,” Clint chimed in before Steve could say anything more. “It’s the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge.” He paused for a moment. “It’s them. I got three with the cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.”
Damn it.
Tony sighed, opening the blueprints of Mark Forty-Three. Building something always distracted him from whatever was weighing heavily on his mind and so he set out to make improvements on the suit’s chest-plate, first.
. Nat—well, I have no fucking clue what they did to Natasha, but you probably do and I’m guessing she won the worst-childhood-lottery. And
After merging the Mind Stone with JARVIS’ matrix, both Wanda and Pietro had agreed to join the fight. While Steve had briefed them and Vision about the team’s usual MO, Tony had given Barnes’ broken arm a quick once-over. Ultron had basically torn the thing’s software apart, and while Tony could easily re-install a backup, it would take a good few hours to really fine-tune the settings.
“What,” Steve prompted.
. Sometimes he would just moan. But every hour of the night, Indries’ name lived on his lips.
“You as well,” Steve replied truthfully. Tony was wearing a black tux with a waistcoat that was of the same blue color as Steve’s tux. He looked perfectly comfortable and devilishly handsome.
, Steve was fine with that. Today, not so much. “Look, if he’s busy… just say so. I’m not in the mood for long and complicated excuses.”
,” Tony said as they slowly—carefully—walked down the stairway. “I asked him for two fucking months, and he can’t even give me that.”
“Tony,” Steve prompted, sitting down on his side of the bed. He reached for Tony’s shoulder, rubbing the skin there. A hand settled on top of his, and Tony pulled gently to press a kiss into Steve’s palm.
Steve breathed a choked moan, thrusting forward in time with the strokes of Tony’s hand. “Yes…”
“Come again?” Fury asked.
Tony huffed in mock-outrage. “Your father has a sarcastic way about him sometimes,” he said, brushing his thumb across the baby’s back. “It’s not very attractive.”
Tony parked the car just around the corner. Walking up to the bar’s entrance. There was light techno buzzing its way into the cold air, and Tony pulled his coat further around himself.
case…”
“Great,” Steve replied on a huff. “Thanks.” With that, he lifted Tony off his lap just enough to torture them both before pulling him up and down again with fast and sharp movements.
Tony—”
Natasha shook her head. “No. It was arrogant to make that decision for you—I realize that, now. But I still think you were better off not knowing. It wasn’t the right time. You meant too much to me to lose you to a ghost.”
Alright, first things first: He needed to figure out where he was. Only then, he could figure out a way to go back.
These past two days had been the best of his life. The absolute best. And despite all of Tony’s happiness, he was terrified. Not just about Rhodey—this, this was the beginning of a whole new life. His own future seemed to be set in stone and Steve? Steve would be in California, soon. And Tony would’ve liked to believe that they could make the long-distance thing work, but… at the end of the day, there was no telling if this was truly the beginning of something, or also the end of it.
Because this, here… he knew there really would be no other memory he’d rather die to.
Tony’s head flew up.
There were about two seconds of undisturbed bliss, with Tony’s mind floating off to a space where Steve had actually just agreed to go steady, before his words registered with him.
“Alright,” Steve said, albeit reluctantly. The other laboratories around them stood empty, and there was no way to tell which route Ultron and the Maximoff twins had taken. He had no idea where they could be now. Seoul was huge, and maybe they’d already left the city long ago. Or Ultron might have set up shop anywhere in town to upload himself into the new body.
Steve looked at him in surprise. “You do?”
SR 2:14 P.M.>You should see what's going on in my pants
anything. On the contrary, he was going on dates with girls, he was talking about them, ogling them, and just—there had been never any doubt in Steve’s head that Tony was straight and… he’d been surprised, that was all.
, he hadn’t done that before, this was his first time, of course it was, and could whoever-he’d-been-with please show him how things worked, thanks very much.
“That goes both ways,” Steve said and leaned in for a last kiss. As he left for the elevators, Steve swiped his shield from where it was hanging on one of the workshop walls.
After a beat, Tony’s arms wrapped about him and he was kissing him with such intensity, with such need, that it was like being hit by a tidal wave. Steve toppled over, his arms tight around Tony’s waist. He could barely make it to the couch and let himself be pressed into it.
Tony’s face fell and a choked sob escaped his lips as he pressed another kiss, and a second one, against Steve’s lips. “For once, I don’t think that’s enough,” he breathed.
Steve grinned wryly. “Wonderful. Thank you.”
“Charming,” Tony said, but there was no heat behind it. It was hard to imagine that it should be so easy. But… come to think on it, Tony could admit that they were all much more relaxed around each other. Not so prone to weighing each word the other said. They all… they all laughed more, relying on each other, trusting each other, and if Tony was perfectly honest with himself, he couldn’t imagine them breaking apart because of this, either.
“Well, you know what they say,” Tony prompted, “age makes you wiser.”
The larger part of Tony itched to go to Steve and make it all better. He wanted to take him into his arms, and get the fuck out of here, away from all the pain. Right now.
With a steady hand, Natasha pulled him towards the door, and they both came to a stop in front of it.
Steve had figured as much. The struggles, the blackness of his eyes—Tony must’ve somehow accessed Extremis again and had been fighting Ultron the whole time. “Can he stop him?”
It was a shame they weren't in the same team anymore, he mused absently. If they had been co-leading, he'd be able to see Tony every day.
It wasn’t a very good picture. Aside from the poor quality of the image, the angle was odd, and yet… it was them at their happiest.
“—tell them to go shove their sniper rifles where the sun don’t shine?
A smile had taken hold of Steve’s face and he shook his head with a soft expression. “You called him Bucky. That’s a first.”
me to let it go?” Steve asked, and Tony only pressed his lips together, for once unable to find a proper answer. Steve sighed. “You know we have to talk about it eventually.”
And a lot more red.
“Yeah? I’d like to say I will beat the ever living hell out of you if you try, but…” He laughed, a soft sound as he lifted his fractured arm. “We both know I can’t.”
He’d spent the entire day looking at his own quarters, then Jarvis had led him to the library, the gardens, the dining rooms and the swimming area. Afterwards, he’d tried looking for ‘the workshop’, as Stane had called it—a place where he figured Tony’s inventing took place—but it was nowhere to be found.
kissed back, right? Tony tried to remember things that weren’t Steve’s taste and the smoothness of his lips or the way his heart had practically hammered against his chest.
Steve let out a small sigh, nodded and turned away from Peggy’s gravestone.
He needed to respect that.
Because Pepper was awesome like that.
“Yeah, I know. Got it under control,” Steve replied, trying to sound put together. He had promised himself that he wouldn’t show the terror he’d felt upon seeing Wanda Maximoff’s vision, or the anxiety that still plagued him at the thought of Ultron controlling Tony via Extremis. As ridiculous as it sounded, he couldn’t quite get over the thought that they might not have much time left, and if that was the case, Steve didn’t want anything more to come between them. Saying it out loud would make it another problem.
They were just about to kiss when a voice floated in from the living room.
Bucky tapped a finger against his temple and Steve’s eyes widened when he understood.
Tony visibly swallowed, though he didn’t move away. “This could backfire real bad. I just feel the need to say it once for the record, so you can’t blame me later.”
. And this might go on a little longer, but I know you’ll push through, and I will, too.”
“What for?” Tony asked breathlessly.
The only thing he cared more about was Steve.
His technique was almost as good as Steve’s, and that was something that he refused to take lightly. He sat his shield back on his back and flung the helmet on the ground—eternally grateful that Tony was already on his private jet right now, because it was pretty safe to say he wouldn’t approve.
Steve glanced to Tony where he sat slumped over his still-filled Shawarma plate. He looked just as exhausted as Steve felt, and Steve could see how far his thoughts had drifted off.
“Your sarcasm accomplishes nothing!”
“Oh, I dreamed of you for years, basically my whole youth. But you weren’t like this, not so…” He swallowed, and words seemed to fail him. “You’re different.”
He lowered them both on the bed, not allowing an inch to come between them for even a second. All of Tony’s reactions were on autopilot. Steve met him for another fierce, hungry kiss, his mouth loving him for all he was worth. And just like that, the world around them vanished. The taste of Steve was in his mouth again, his tongue between his lips. Steve’s fingers tunneled through his hair, his teeth nipping at Tony’s lips, trying to consume him whole. And Tony was helpless to do anything but let him.
Eventually, Tony motioned for Steve to move forward. As hot as it was that Steve could do this against the wall with no effort, he really needed to touch him and touch him
“All clean and fresh, aren’t we, pumpkin?”
Steve smiled,
Steve glanced over to Bucky. His expression was one of infinite regret, as he, too, stared at the monitor. “Neither of you has.”
At some point, he reached out and entwined both of their hands. And here, in the quiet aftermath, Tony could at long last acknowledge to himself that the bubbly feeling within his chest coupled with the sharp stab of pained longing he felt every time he looked at Steve was something the romantics called love. Something he had searched so long for, but never dared to admit it to himself.
There was no time to think. Tony dodged an arrow—one he had designed,
Steve stopped, surprised that Vision cared enough to notice. He’d wondered how much empathy the man possessed, and to be honest, after hearing him talk for the first time, he truly hadn’t thought Vision would worry about human emotions at all.
“I’m trying to do you a favor here,” he said with a slightly gentler tone. “And by doing so, I’m taking a lot on faith. The least you could do is hear me out.”
“Yes,” Natasha agreed, though Tony knew there was a ‘but’ before she opened her mouth again. “Steve and James… they still hurt people. Ross wanted that leverage so he could force our hands and bring them in and… Tony, we can’t say no.”
“Hello.” Tony waved at himself, his eyes sparkling darkly. “I’m
They trailed after him as he made his way towards his main workstation and only stopped when Tony turned around again, the blueprint in his hand.
babysit his little boy.
It looked at once strange, beautiful and entirely supercilious.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said quietly.
“No!” Tony yelled. “I don’t care what you think you
Tony stuttered, frowned. He was almost sure it started with B. “Well, he likes to be alone most of the time… you really think I have no friends?”
He pumped into him a couple of times, back and forth, and Tony tried spreading his thighs further apart, his trembling calves battling his jeans until they were around his knees. “Come on,” he whispered hoarsely. Demandingly. “Just do it now.”
“Oh no,” Steve breathed. Slowly, as if in trance, he walked into the kitchen area. There was a paper calendar on the wall—a tradition Clint had once insisted on—and it was set to the month of June and the year on it was 2022.
Then, Obi drew in a deep breath, and whatever protest had been there was apparently dying on his lips. He swayed a little when he stood up, but before Happy could get to him, he was already waving him off. He straightened his back and assessed Tony for a moment longer, before he made to leave the shop without so much as another word.
Most of all, he felt sorry for Tony.
A pause. When he spoke again, Tony’s mouth was right at his ear. “You look too pure to be real. And anyway, this is my dream, remember?”
“And I love you. As long as that is still true, we can work out everything else, easy as that.” A gentle smile crossed his face. “Life doesn’t give you second chances without reason. We’re probably on our sixth by now, that’s gotta count for something. And don’t doubt for a second that you’re making me happy, because you do. Every single day.”
A still beat. Iron Man’s eyes settled on Steve. “I don’t care. He killed my mom,” he said and without another word, Tony raised his free hand and shot a repulsor-beam directly at Steve’s chest. It pushed Steve off, but didn’t even smolder his uniform. It was enough power for his grip on Tony to loosen, though, and he heard the whoosh of foot thrusters and didn’t manage to hold him back in time.
organization. You
“All right, Edwin,” Rhodey said. “Thanks.”
Bucky froze, every inch of his body wrought with tension. “No I don’t!” Hard, shattering gasps rocked through his chest. He turned around swiftly, eyes clashing again with his before exploring the area behind him.
Steve squared his small shoulders. “So you want to… be with me?”
Steve furrowed his brows, looking down on their entwined hands. “Don’t say that.”
Tony sighed. “Bucky Barnes’ old unit was captured in ’43. Zola experimented on him. And I guess that… whatever Zola did, might’ve helped Barnes survive the fall in Italy. And the years that followed.”
Tony snorted. “I kind of own the place,” he said. “Not officially, but I will, in a few years, so…” He shrugged. “No objections.”
,” Tony rasped, turning around as his voice broke. “Don’t just stand there! Get out—Get out, please—”
Really, it had seemed like a wonderful idea at the time: Hooking up with Steve just a few days before New Year’s Eve, spending one of the best nights of Tony’s life with the guy, and another just-as-great morning, before parting ways and deciding to ‘meet up later’ again when they both ‘had the time to spare’.
He had already fanned the embers into a blaze by the time Steve got to the firepit. Tony looked up at him, then squatted on his heels beside the fire.
PhD, it's his second. He did the first at Dr. Reeds'."
A small grumpy yawn left Tony’s lips, but he forced himself awake. Sure enough, his head was craned back in an awkward and entirely painful way. The apartment was still dark, and Steve was kneeling before him, his face illuminated by the dull light of the arc reactor, while he was caressing Tony’s neck in slow strokes. He was wearing gray sweats and a blue t-shirt now, his blonde hair still somewhat damp from the shower. His blue eyes were very large as he looked up at him.
That soft sound of his name coaxed Tony’s eyes back to Steve’s, his eyes wide and imploring. He wisely ignored the way his chest constricted at the emotion he saw in those eyes. The emotion that had been there long before, had been strong and alluring, often making Tony contemplate if he could get away with kissing Steve right in the middle of a debriefing.
you around, that’s what this is! Are you really telling me you wanna try long-distance with a 3000 miles between us? These things never work out for anyone. And I don’t want to force you into trying.”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
It worked, but not much. Tony honestly didn’t know what was worse: the fact that he didn’t regret kissing Steve, or the fact that he really missed him.
“I can see why I would dream of you,” he said, his voice strangely soft as his eyes did the vertical dance once more. “I always preferred people with fight in them.”
“I gotta agree, Bruce,” Tony said. “It was hard enough to keep them from turning you in after Wakanda. We’re already short a few team-members. I can’t lose you, too.”
Steve smiled. “Two’s company.”
“Of course I thought about that,” Tony said. “Even suggested it to her. Offered her money. She laughed right at me. Said she’d make it the scandal of the century. She’d tell the most horrid things about me, make up various perversions, tell I beat her, used her, raped her. She said she’d ruin not only me but my entire family. Pepper, Rhodey. Everyone. I couldn’t do that. So I made a deal with her. We’d handle our marriage as a business contract. Be the perfect couple in public. Stay out of each other’s space otherwise.” A pause. “At first, she played the game brilliantly. But after a while, she began to grow careless and in the months that followed… she drained me of everything. She couldn’t just do as she pleased, she wanted me to suffer. She threw one party after the other, fucking whoever made eyes at her. So I drowned my pain in booze and… I don’t really know what sent me over.” He brushed both hands through his hair as if he was ready to tear it out. “Do you really want to hear this?”
“What about yours?” Steve shot back and already wanted to swallow his words down the next instant. It wasn’t fair, none of it. He stared off, then, not looking at any of them.
"You look like shit," Bucky greeted as he walked in from the corridor. He was holding two beer bottles in his hand as he approached, and handed one to Steve.
, Tony,” he cursed, and there were trembling fingers brushing along his neck, while Steve buried his face in Tony’s shoulder.
A smile. Tony was a sucker for Steve’s smiles. “You’re not even curious?”
“Sure. Mi casa es su casa,” he told Steve and waved a hand around at the workshop, then opened a holograph of the bulb’s scans JARVIS had made a day ago. Zooming in, he cautiously began to peel the artificial layers away. Only when the sliding doors closed half a minute later, he knew Steve had left, and felt himself slumping back into the chair’s back rest a little.
* * *
So he did, fingers brushing over Tony’s flushed cheeks. “That was incredible,” he murmured as he dropped his face on Tony’s shoulder, burrowed there, replete and spent.
Sam sniggered.
Cringe. What the hell was he doing?
“And don’t pretend to be indifferent, Natasha, I know you feel the same way,” Steve said.
He abruptly tore his gaze away. What the hell was he thinking?!
“I-20-8-Y-4-7-H-6-9-W.”
Steve nodded, saying nothing. They all had their fair share of nightmares, and he’d known Tony’d had a particularly hard time after his fight against Aldrich Killian, and once more after Ultron.
Tony snorted, and nodded. Something in his tense posture shifted then, and Bucky could see as he visibly relaxed. “Alright,” Tony said, “let’s get this thing done?”
A soft sigh escaped his lips. “It’s my fault, Nat. Anything that happens… If Stark breaks up with him…”
Tony ground his own middle against Steve’s, his hand favoring him with a good squeeze. Steve gasped lightly, his chest rising and falling in shaky motions. Slowly, Tony leaned forward, his fist sliding up and down Steve’s length. He paused for a moment, savoring this, before he bowed down, licking Steve from balls to tip and sucking his length into his mouth. His lips brushed just slightly along him, his mouth caressing him with tenderness. Eventually, he was bobbing his head with slow leisure. His fingers gently massaged the base of Steve’s erection as his mouth trailed the length of him back and forth.
,” Steve demanded, his head hanging low now. When Tony pulled his fingers free, Steve’s back arched. He groaned, loud and unashamed and beautiful, before his head turned aside to glance at him again. His eyes were glassy, his face flushed, and Tony leaned forward to kiss him deeply.
Friends. He could be friends with Steve again, right?
Tony suddenly let go of Steve’s hand, sitting up. He stared at him for a very long moment, as if only now taking him in fully—his face, his hair, his uniform. His face flickered over Steve’s body as if cataloguing the changes he was probably detecting just then, and Steve had to school his expression when Tony’s eyes turned to slits.
Steve looked adorably relieved. “Yes, please.”
“Yeah, not really,” Tony shot back on a little chuckle. With a low groan, he rolled around until he was lying on his back, only one foot still touching Steve. “First time I realized I liked both girls and boys was while watching Saving Private Ryan, and that kinda stuck…”
Shaking his head, Steve gave a faint shrug. "Not my business what I'm doing in other realities," he said, smiling with mischief. "Though if I'm busy fighting you, then clearly I'm missing out." He cupped the back of Tony's head and nuzzled his cheek. "This is much better."
He wanted to, with every fiber of his being, a big part of him was just too afraid to hope.
Clint sighed. “Phil will have a field day when he hears this.”
“Steve…” Tony started as he pulled back. He opened his mouth to say more, but it was then that sirens resounded all around Steve and he jerked awake.
Clint sighed. “He won’t be able to ignore it either. They won’t let him. It’s not a question of what Tony wants to do and what he doesn’t.”
A small breathy sound. “Guilty as charged,” Steve said. There was a long pause, as if Steve had only planned for a ‘hello’ and not much more. He awkwardly cleared his throat. “Did I wake you?”
“We’ll find out soon enough,” Steve replied. Wanda especially still had trouble keeping her surroundings in mind, but she did need field experience so this was a good way as any to start. He swiped a comm piece from Tony’s desk and set it down on his left ear.
Tony watched in amazement and narrowed his eyes as she turned to look at him. “You holding up?”
Natasha’s face tightened. “You couldn’t have helped—”
Tony heaved a long breath, feeling disheartened all of a sudden. He pulled his hand back after squeezing Steve’s lightly, and instead rubbed his forehead for a moment. “There’s… reasons, why Pepper broke up with me. The damn bunny was just a drop in the ocean of all reasons. And I guess it’s just fair to warn you that I’m…” He cleared his throat, putting the fork down for good, his appetite fading. “I’m not an easy man to deal with, in the long run. And you might think my eccentricity is charming now—which is still surprising to me, by the way—but… people tend to find it less charming the longer they know me and I’m…” A sigh. “I
bearable.”
Steve had been so deeply focused on the two that he hadn’t heard the sound of footsteps behind him, and he wasn’t at all prepared for the vicious kick to his lower back that came just a few seconds later. There was an explosion of pain in his spine, and he hit the pavement on his hands and knees. Before he could recover, another kick landed on the side of his head, pushing him over onto his back.
Steve grabbed for Tony then, touching wherever he could, like he could never get enough of him, which he suspected was true. He kissed Tony slowly, but his touch was more urgent. When he pulled them tight together, he couldn't help the small hitch at how their dicks slid so perfectly against one another.
With every glide, Tony's breath quickened. One hand dropped to the one Steve had pressed against his shoulder, while the other shot upwards to rest on Steve's head. When a subtle shift in position made Steve's cock hit that tender spot inside of him more fully, his name fell from Tony's lips in a long groan, followed by a list of strangled obscenities when Steve held that angle with precision, hitting Tony's prostate over and over again.
“I’m James Rhodes,” he said. “It’s really good to meet you, Steve. You can call me Rhodey.”
Because of Ian.
Steve was about to speak his mind about Tony's alleged future conquests, but held his tongue. He smiled instead and finally rolled off of Tony. Much as he liked lying there indefinitely, the condom was starting to get unpleasant against his skin and he wanted it off.
Lifting his gaze again, Steve realized Tony was staring at him intently. And there was something in his eyes that gave Steve pause. A flare of insecurity. Uncertainty. Doubt. “We’re gonna get through this together, aren’t we?” Tony asked quietly.
Tony looked down to where their hands were joined, tracing a thumb over Steve’s cufflinks. “And here I thought you couldn’t possibly top that, but there you go. You win the wedding-gift competition. Congratulations.”
Steve groaned and flopped back into his seat. He released another sigh and only begrudgingly opened his eyes, when Natasha prodded him with a finger on his biceps.
Steve swallowed. So Mister Hammer knew of the nature of their relationship.
Natasha stopped, but didn’t turn around. “You’re welcome. But I did both of you a favor,” she said, then left.
, in ways that had sometimes scared him, because…
“You seem stressed,” Tony said, his voice a bit toned down. The others were immersed in the movie again, with Thor’s laughter and Clint’s random snorts resounding in the room, but Tony could see that Steve wasn’t really into it. He had that look again, like his thoughts were locked up in a whole other lifetime, and while Tony couldn’t exactly relate, he did feel sympathy for the guy. Hard to imagine having lost everyone you ever knew, and a whole world as well, in the blink of an eye.
It took several long seconds for Steve to understand what had just happened, and when he did, Bucky was already yelling at him.
Steve smiled, his fingers dancing around Tony’s cock. The smile illuminating his face grew seductive and he tightened his grip around him. Steve had memorized him so effortlessly. He knew exactly where and how to touch him, knew exactly how he liked to be kissed, knew more about Tony than anyone had ever known.
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again. “Yeah,
, Steve thought, but couldn’t bring himself to say it. Tony wouldn’t want to hear it, and Steve didn’t want to darken the mood. He knew—not so much by actual words from Tony, but by all the things he hadn’t said—that he was still wrecking his brains over the hits and words he’d inflicted upon Bucky in Siberia.
To finally have a little bit of peace for themselves.
, after all. “Don’t try to sweet talk me. I may love you but that doesn’t mean you can just get away with insulting my board of directors.”
“Uh…” Tony prompted. “Hello?”
Steve knew—Zola’s testimony was enough to verify what his eyes were telling him with factuality; and yet he heard and disbelieved its weight with callous concentration.
. It was a word Steve hated with a passion. It sounded as if Tony was broken.
Tony turned over to face Steve. “Why aren’t we getting rid of all these people who shouldn’t be living here?”
“Yes,” Bruce agreed. “Thor’s still looking for you. I’ll try and contact him.”
“Do you mind some company?” Rhodey asked.
Steve blinked. “You?”
stretching out behind Tony in a manner Steve had only seen in Renaissance paintings.
“Coulson’s idea,” Maria explained.
He was alive, somewhere, and they’d get him back, and then, maybe, they could start forming the friendship their future selves seemed to have, no matter how strange the thought was.
“You’d love that.”
,” Tony said, slapping a hand to his heart. He held Steve’s gaze a moment longer, before he put the tumbler back down on the table and walked over. It was the first time he was within arm-length, and Steve lightly bit his lower lip when he got a whiff of Tony’s aftershave.
It had Steve smile; he couldn’t help it.
When the repurposed warehouse building came into view, Tony slowed down the Audi . He parked it in front of the entrance, leaning back in his seat. He sighed, brushing a hand across his forehead. “What am I even doing here,” he mumbled.
Sam nodded. “On a scale of one to ten, how weird was it to be stranded in another dimension with Stark of all people? I mean, did you guys even talk?”
“The area had been cleared before we even got there,” Sam explained.
“I’m willingly sullied,” Steve reminded him, and smiled. “And I’ve never been all that virtuous.”
. Then he pinched his nose and shook his head. “Is this how it’s gonna be now? Give you two an enclosed area, and you’re going at it like bunnies?”
He had no idea what time it was, nor did he particularly care. Instead, he allowed himself to take in Tony’s relaxed expression. What would he give to just stay here, in their little sanctuary, and not face another day full of this hatred. Why couldn’t those people see what a wonderful man Tony was? Why couldn’t Tony?
He stared out onto the moonlit night sky and got lost in the movement below. At least, that’s why he told himself he didn’t hear Happy approach. The steps on the ground were loud, but he was dazed, lost in his thoughts, and he didn’t hear him.
“Thanksgiving dinner?” Bucky offered as he walked into the room.
It wouldn’t be happening, though. Not on his life. If they really decided to care for a kid, Tony had to make sure this world was as secure as it could be. He owed Steve that much.
“He’s… he’s just trying to wrap up the…
Why was Tony here?
Tony nodded. “We… all are. I can’t even remember all of them not being here.”
“You remember?” Steve asked, and God—it
Tony was kissing him like it was the most normal thing in the entire world.
,” Steve answered, though he slowly realized that Tony was merely reciting things that he already knew.
“It doesn’t have to make sense.”
A beat of silence.
“Ah.” Steve rubbed a hand over his face, before handing the tablet over to Natasha. “How long did you know about this?”
Steve felt something very warm settle in his chest. “You really love me, huh?”
Tony released an obscenely loud and sort-of-broken mewl as he pressed his face into Steve’s shoulder. At this point, he was just trying to keep up. Every nerve in his body was on fire and the hard slide of Steve’s cock was driving him into a steadily rising madness. He forced his muscles to contract around him, his heart singing at each little moan Steve released in return.
me to keep trying.”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
His heart was about to leap through his chest as he raised his fist to the door and knocked.
And any second, Steve was certain he was going to wake up, realizing that he was only dreaming a very weird, and very impossible dream.
Steve blinked and finally quit his staring-contest, turning to him. He’d lost his helmet at some point and his eyes—his eyes were mirroring each and every loss he’d endured in the last few years.
“Is that guy wearing a
Tony bit his lower lip, looking as troubled as was humanly possible. His gaze dropped to their joined hands. “You’ll hate me.”
Steve nodded, and pulled at Tony’s hand, bringing him nearer. “Don’t worry too much,” he whispered, then kissed his lips chastely.
She was right. Together, they could do this. They could face the past and start a future. They could know heat in the middle of a winter storm. For all that was behind them, there was only the road ahead to look to. The first means to an end either had ever known.
"Why would you go to the trouble of designing this for me?" Bucky asked, not even bothering to wonder if it was indeed designed for him. Bucky was usually not the kind of guy to ask pointless questions or beat around the bush.
Steve looked back at him. And there—there was that warm smile again. Steve was looking at Tony like it was a big relief he was here—as if looking at Tony was somehow a big reassurance. “Thank you, Tony,” he said.
Tony blinked and ignored the pain that jabbed his side for no reason other than it was there and wanted to be remembered. He was staring at Steve with such intensity that he nearly forgot everything else. “You want to shut down SHIELD,” he said then, almost mindlessly. The words were there but they didn’t quite make sense, yet.
his lips.
crossed his lips only a few years ago—he really had changed a lot more than he had realized. “My kid’s a bit of a nightmare these days.” He offered his hand. “Tony Stark, I don’t think we’ve met.”
Most days, he had no idea what was even going through Tony’s head. Whenever he worked with Extremis, he mostly stared at a spot on the floor, his eyes hidden from Steve’s and his mind far away. It was something Steve had meant to address earlier, but between Bucky’s recovery and the endless hearings Tony had to attend on their behalf… well, Steve hadn’t wanted to put even more pressure on his shoulders.
It was his own fault for allowing himself to fall in love with Steve, but it was also Steve's for allowing it to happen. And he was tired of Steve’s back and forth, tired of this dancing around each other.
“You can talk about it if you wanna, you know…” he said after a moment, reaching out to put his hand on Steve’s chest, feeling his heart beating beneath his fingers. Whatever Steve was dreaming of was likely not something Tony could relate to, but… talking helped. Or at least, it
Guys, I'm so very sorry for the delay. Enjoy the final chap!
Tony hummed in something that wasn’t quite an acknowledgement. There was an edge to his voice as he spoke up. Steve supposed it had something to do with the obvious involvement of magic. By now, everyone knew how much Tony hated not to be able to control these kinds of events. “She’s gone, I think,” Tony mumbled.
Next to him, Maria stepped into the room. She laid a hand on her left ear, listening to the comm-line. “Barton placed the first blade,” she told them quietly. “They’re initiating launch.”
“He will. I have zero doubt about that. And just for the record… you two have my support—even then. Tony can be an ass, but—” He shrugged. “The good kind, right?”
“Hold still, if you can.”
“Stark is…” Bucky started, frowning as he visibly searched for the right words. “He doesn’t really do compromises, does he?”
“And you think he’s going to be all right?” Coulson asked quietly.
Despite the common room being effectively deserted, it still felt a little like standing in an open field where anyone could eavesdrop, and Steve's sense of privacy was nagging him.
“Let’s get that time machine of yours,” Tony said, just in time before one of the bots turned up in the shadows.
Steve was thrusting in deep, hitting every sweet spot, and Tony’s mind just whited out, his body losing all posture. He groaned, surrendering entirely to Steve, and came, hard, his cock pulsing against Steve’s fingers.
It looked like they didn’t have a single care in the world.
“It’s a reasonable worry,” he defended himself, trying not to meet Steve’s gaze too often. “If I understood myself correctly, which of course I did, the switch-back only works because you have the same DNA. Our Steve doesn’t have the Time Sequencer in your time, so he relies on you being sent back. If something happens to you here, he’s stuck.”
Steve’s apartment was in the second building from the corner, within walking distance of the Smithsonian and National Gallery. It was secluded and out of the way, and while the area was somewhat world famous, it had a small town charm that he knew reminded Steve of his childhood home in Brooklyn. Which was probably the reason why Steve had bought the tiny apartment in the first place.
“I saw… that this was what we’d need,” he replied. “Doesn’t matter if what the Maximoff girl showed me was real, I
After one more hop, he deposited Ian on the bed in a giggling heap, then jumped on after him and pushed his rompers to the side, nuzzling his bare tummy, blowing loud raspberries on it.
“Steve,” Tony said softly. “If we can’t accept limitations, we’re
It obviously wasn’t her fault he didn’t remember her, and Tony wanted to tell her that, but Natasha only smiled and shook her head. The next second, the med kit shut with a definite metallic snap. Natasha picked it up, standing. Her face was closed off and Tony knew she wouldn’t want the comfort—she’d made up her mind about Bucky Barnes long ago.
Steve quirked a fleeting smile. “You haven’t seen the other guy.”
, had expected to hear when it came to Natasha’s past. He was aware that Clint probably knew all of it, but that was
what she was talking about. While he still wasn’t sure Vision even needed human food, he seemed to have lost some weight so that his normally snug nerd-pullovers hung off him like a sack of potatoes. He looked as if he wanted something very badly and could not get it. And Tony had a feeling he knew what it was.
Steve’s mouth opened, a low gasp escaping him.
"Grasp the deeper meaning behind a huge stuffed bunny?" Steve scrunched his nose, though he was still smiling. "Who even gets something like that for their sweetheart? It's completely ridiculous."
“Things change. People, too.”
While his own erection was still very much
“I think I’m finally making headway.”
“Tony,” Pepper answered, and nowadays she wasn’t even deterred anymore when Extremis’ robotic voice greeted her. “The party already started?”
“Maybe he thinks you’re an easy mark,” a voice said.
And that also meant Tony was the benefactor who’d funded the expedition. His heart swelled. Tony had looked for him—had searched for over sixteen years. That had to mean something, right?
Steve stepped closer, and his expression turned very serious. “You have a huge heart. That you’re trying to solve every problem with rational thinking, it doesn’t change the fact that your heart always leads your way, too. You agreed to work with Ross because you saw what our powers could do if they weren’t controlled. You… have the biggest heart of us all.” A self-deprecating smile rose to his lips. “And where does that leave me?”
When he finally looked up to meet Tony's eyes, he saw him looking back at him, and had to smile. "So that's what it takes," he said, resting his palm over Tony's belly, fingers tracing along his abs. "To get us to meet, I mean."
Gently, he put a hand on Tony’s bare back to keep him steady. “Here, let me.”
“Detective...” Tony swallowed. “
And without warning, Tony’s body went on autopilot. His fingers wove through Steve’s hair, drawing it out of his face, so he could see Steve’s pink lips stretched around his dick. He drove his hips upward, demanding more. More of Steve. More of his mouth. Steve’s tongue swept over his aching head, suckling at the beads of precum gathered there, his lips curling and wandering further down Tony’s length.
“You’re starting to sound like ‘Drunk Tony’.” Steve grinned wickedly and kissed him all the same. Tony utilized that advantage and wrapped his thighs around Steve, pulling himself on top, and earning a long-winded groan as he began to rub against Steve.
God, she was even more beautiful than he remembered. And then her hand on his neck, kneading the skin there. He fought the instinct to pull away. It had been years since he’d felt a gentle caress, and it made him uneasy to have someone touch him like that. But when he looked into Natalia’s eyes, he saw profound understanding there. His muscles relaxed, and his head dropped onto Steve’s shoulder in defeat.
It was a lame joke, he knew, but it had Tony huff a breathless laugh, so at least it broke the tension a little. “Oh, really,” he answered dryly. “Looks like you lost.”
“Harder,” Tony pleaded in a strained voice, repeating it over and over again, breathing heavily. His fingers dug into Steve’s neck as his hips moved back and forth, his back arched, trying to keep Steve’s length inside. He was drowning in sensation, lost in the feel of him, and it went on and on until his hands clawed mindlessly on whatever part of Steve he could find. Every nerve in him was so sensitized that the climax came as an unbelievable rapture.
, he didn’t have to. Instantaneously, Tony wanted to cradle him in his arms, to shelter him from the harshness of the world, and to remove the terrible look of sadness that was now darkening his features. On the next beat, Steve buried his face in both hands.
“Captain?” Tony asked again, reminding Steve that he’d been staring for long moments. With a swift movement Tony pulled the sunglasses off his nose. The torn currents of his brown eyes burrowed into Steve’s with intensity that knocked the wind out of him.
That was almost twenty years ago.
Tony released a trembling breath and gripped his cock to lessen the strain a bit, before pulling his knees up to give Steve better access.
“It’s Happy,” the man replied as he let go of him again. “Just Happy.”
Steve groaned, half annoyance, half want. Tony leaned forward and the position made their kiss a little awkward and sloppy but fuck if he cared. His fingers resumed their movement, caressing the skin of Steve’s back, then his stomach, purposely ignoring Steve’s dick as he moved them back to his ass, fingering the stretched skin of Steve’s hole as he started to languidly slide in and out of him again. His pace was slow, now, but he gave each movement as much momentum as he could. He let his fingers trail up to Steve’s back and watched him curl into his touch like a cat.
“Steve,” Tony whispered, feeling all kinds of useless. This had never happened before, not since they’d gotten together—not since their first night all those months ago. Steve had always been very still while sleeping next to him, and besides a few mumbled words here and there, he’d been quiet. Now, he seemed to be one step from screaming,
“Then let’s start with this,” Steve said. “What am I to you, where you come from? What are we to each other?”
Tony shifted uncomfortably. “Now you’re just being dramatic.”
Tony watched with bated breath as Steve’s thumb brushed over the back of his hand, and he couldn’t help it. He shivered, his own forefinger moving just that tiny bit to touch Steve’s hand, watching the movement as if it might be his last one.
?” Tony huffed. “You
“Oh, you
A lot of things were going through Tony’s mind, just then. He wished he could call Pepper once more, apologize for the clusterfuck that had been their relationship. He wished he could step out of the suit and hug Rhodey until the world ended. And he wished… God, he wished he had more time to… to…
“Nat—”
“What are you talking about?” Steve asked. “It’s nowhere near his birthday.”
, he thought, or he knew he wouldn’t stop. “Just come back quickly.”
Tony hummed. “It is,” he agreed, then swallowed, defeat leaking back into his eyes. “Too late, I guess.”
"Yeah," Steve said, sounding out of breath. "We should go."
They had been sitting on the sofa in the living room, hands clutched in some weird parody of a romantic comedy. Steve’s mother was a whirlwind, plain and simple. Her reaction to her son’s outing had been hilarious; and soon after, she’d hugged Tony to her chest and called him her son. It didn’t matter to her that Steve was bi, or the fact that he was currently in love with another man.
Steve gulped audibly. “Where’s Rhodes? I thought he was looking for you.”
“Of course not. It might take him a while, but everything’s forgivable. Even for a criminal centenarian.”
“How was he when…” Steve trailed off, at a loss for words.
“We were,” Steve said, and when he saw Natasha smiling knowingly, he felt his face heat. He cleared his throat, willing himself to keep his cool. “They just didn’t share much information that would help me find them.”
Steve sighed, but nodded. “Did everyone make it?”
Keeping his breathing even, Steve clenched and unclenched his fists once, twice, then shook his head. "Funny," he said around a chuckle. "It's when people say 'no offense' that they say the most offensive stuff, isn't it?" He was shifting his weight from one foot to the other lightly as he spoke. "Do enlighten me,
Steve sighed, too, wringing his hands. “You told me, yes, but never… I didn’t believe it was true.”
“We’re disgusting,” Tony mumbled.
"You're dealing with a minor," he said promptly, giving the woman a pointed look. "I'd keep my distance if I were you." He turned on his heels then, only to find Bucky standing a step behind him, just as he’d suspected. Steve clapped his shoulder with a tight lipped expression that showed every ounce of fury Tony's comment had lit up. "Come on."
“We gotta go help them,” Steve said. “We can’t let Rumlow get away with that weapon. But afterwards…” He stared at Tony. “You’ll have some explaining to do.”
read_sockets, write_sockets, error_sockets = select.select(socket_list , [], [])
“I heard you.”
Steve thought it over for a moment, then smiled. It had taken long enough for Tony to allow a professional to care for Ian for so much as an hour, so Steve should probably be encouraged that Tony suggested a teammate for the first time. And anyway, a few hours for themselves sounded heavenly. “Okay,” he said, returning Tony’s embrace.
Barnes broke away with a sigh, his massive shoulders slumping in a manner that almost imitated defeat. A few uncomfortable seconds of silence spread between them. They seemed at an impassable standstill.
“No one died,” Steve amended, “and they would’ve killed you! Damn it, I don’t know. I was trying to keep you safe—”
Tony snorted. He contemplated Vision for a long moment, watching his bowed head and dejected air.
“Steve,” Bucky breathed inarticulately, as if the word had just wormed its way past Bucky’s lips without his consent. And they remained that way for a long moment, Bucky just staring down at him, trying to place his forgotten memories before confusion melted into despair. His brow furrowed. He looked so close, then—within reach of an objective he couldn’t identify…
“You’re a slob,” she chided him, and tried to look disgusted. She failed, however, when Ian stretched his chubby arms into her direction. That was one of those amazing things Steve had learned about Natasha in those last years: She really, absolutely, unashamedly
Next to Steve, Bucky rolled his eyes. “You think you’re going to decide for all of us? If I’m being carted halfway across the country against my will, this will better be a democratic decision making.”
“It’s fine,” he said, after a moment of puzzled silence. “Wasn’t the first wallop between us. Probably won’t be the last.”
“After what you did to me back there, I was sure I was done for tonight,” Tony admitted, smiling. He pressed both hands against Steve’s chest, determinedly moving him backwards. “Must be your charming presence.”
Not even a glimpse of the man Steve knew seemed to remain in his blue, haunted eyes. He wasn’t himself. It was an understatement, but this was far worse than the times he’d been triggered at home. Natasha had her ways of getting Bucky under control, but for Steve, it had only ever helped to fight Bucky until he had no power in himself anymore.
He looked up, back at Tony’s face, and forced a smile on his face when he saw Tony’s worried expression. “You,” he said truthfully.
Steve blinked. “What?”
Tony tried not to let his nervousness show, but it was a futile thing. Vision and Rhodey had been giving him confused glances on his way up, but he really didn’t have the mind for any explanations.
Tony's breathing was shallow already, coming in quick little bursts that caressed Steve's face. He didn't try to stop Tony's hand from moving, and while he appreciated the kid's restraints, he found it weirdly frustrating.
“We still don’t get along, huh?” Tony asked.
“I know baby, I know.” Desperate, Tony started to pace. Over the distressed sounds, Tony started singing the first thing he could think of:
, he did,” Tony said. “
"Plenty," Steve said, his tone quiet, private, as he leaned down to nudge Tony's head aside so he could get at his throat. His hand kept the constant tease to Tony's cock, which peeked through the unzipped suit, while his other hand sneaked around to rest on the small of his back, pulling him close against himself.
“Jim, can I ask you something?”
“And if I weren’t drunk?” he prompted, chuckling lightly when Steve cast him an unimpressed look. “If I were sober and just really into you?”
Well, this had to stop.
, he’d never had any problems not to act on it. When he’d thought about his future, it had always been so clear that he’d eventually marry a nice dame, if she’d have him, and start a family.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
They all likely threw a lot of commentary and innuendos their way, but Tony didn’t even listen. As soon as the elevator doors closed, he barreled into Steve, pressing him into the backrest. He closed his eyes as they kissed, and in this moment, Steve became
He let his head fall against Steve’s shoulder, and breathed in deep.
Tony thought miserably.
“Sweetheart,” Steve prompted when he noticed Tony’s face fall. His mouth covered Tony’s then, and Tony felt fingertips brush across his chest, across his heart, as if Steve was trying to pull out the hurt. And it felt—it felt as if it was working.
* * *
“And right now, you’re trying to run away too,” Tony continued, “which—as Natasha so kindly put it—apparently makes both of us the most emotionally stunted persons on this planet.”
“Thought so.”
He wound an arm around Steve, stepping even closer while carefully balancing the cup of coffee so it wouldn’t spill over. He let his lips brush along Steve’s throat, inhaling his scent so he would never forget this moment again. “Looks like he was right about that.”
“Sure,” Tony agreed. “You’re linked to all cams, including Redwing’s.”
And Steve was whole-heartedly responding to him.
Tony stared up at Steve with wide eyes; a surprised yelp escaping his lips when Steve suddenly set into motion. For the fraction of a second, he’d thought Steve would push him off and that would be the end of it all. But then, Steve was hovering above him again, face just inches away, and he looked about as unhinged as Tony had ever seen him before.
you,” Steve breathed as if just pushing the words out there. “In the last couple of months… it was hell and I’ve missed you
“You shouldn’t have come,” Bucky eventually said, and Steve heaved a breath of relief. So he was back to himself again.
“You’re shaking,” Steve pointed out, not unkindly, and put both hands on Tony’s face, softly caressing his cheeks. “What happened in there? I thought everything went just as we’d planned.”
Natasha looked amused, Sam had a small smile on his face, Bucky was just frowning at the table.
“You sure you don’t want to take a nap?” Sam asked quietly as he made to stand up. He’d been sitting at Steve’s side for hours without complaining. “I could stay a little while longer.”
Tony looked down, bit his lower lip, and took a deep breath. Which meant he was gathering his emotions, ready to stamp them down as far as they would go. “Let’s talk about it later,” he said, confirming Steve’s thoughts.
At that, Tony smiled. “I know that. I wouldn’t even be here if I didn’t know that.”
* * *
Of course, he wouldn’t leave the room.
TS 2:28 P.M.>I know, I know. You’re busy. I’m busy. The world is a shitty place. We’ll make it happen
And by God, the devil’s lips tasted like home.
"I'll make it up to you every day."
Cold seeped through Steve and then he couldn’t hold himself upright anymore. He couldn’t stand. He just fell down on the ground, leaning against the open cabinet.
“I still can’t believe it. You’re from the future,” he murmured, like he’d been doing for the last half hour straight. “Let’s start with this: When exactly did you learn how to time travel? I mean, I’ve kind of been waiting for you to build a time machine for decades now, but the fact that you’re here and you obviously didn’t bring me with you, you’ll understand I’m a bit bummed.”
Sam scoffed. “Excuse me? I served for years before I even joined Air Force. They made me go through another
On the one hand, he couldn’t wait for the war to be over, but he dreaded it all the same. There was no telling what the time after this would bring. More often than not Steve had wondered if some power had brought Tony to him just so he could bear through all of this. The night after Project Rebirth, when he’d wished for his life to gain some meaning—that had been the night when he’d first met Tony.
* * *
“I agree,” Steve said. “We’ll think of something we can offer them.”
Steve nodded. That much was true. He wasn’t sure when Tony would arrive, but they couldn’t wait forever. For all he knew, Zemo could’ve already woken up those five soldiers, and they had to take them out before they could leave.
. I don’t understand a goddamn word you say!”
Steve agreed with a desperate nod, fingers abandoning Tony’s hole to rip his shoes off and then both pant-legs free. He stepped up between Tony’s now naked legs, winding both of them around his waist. “Sure you can take it?” he asked, and Tony could barely refrain from rolling his eyes.
Tony hummed and leaned closer against Steve.
“They know what happened. They don’t know we made it, but I assume they would be looking for our bodies anyway.”
Steve was still looking at him through the mirror, Tony realized. So he cleared his throat once more, and said: “Just wanted to see if you have everything you need.”
“Aww, Barnes.” Tony said in a tone that clearly betrayed his surprise. “I knew you secretly liked me.”
He felt the shield Howard Stark had given him resting safely on his back, as he let his gaze sweep over the mountains before him. He felt determination settle inside him like a long forgotten dream and he knew, even if this might be his last battle, he’d give it his all.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You’re ridiculous,” he said, but it didn’t stop him from letting a hand slide between Tony’s thighs, grabbing his boxers and pulling them just over his ass. His hips nestled behind him. He shifted, one leg curling over Tony’s thighs, and after taking the lube in his hands he pushed a finger into him, pumping steadily. “Gonna do this slow,” he whispered into Tony’s ear, “take you hard.”
Steve nodded. He lingered a moment longer, and searched Tony’s face. “I’ve been meaning to tell you—”
“And you didn’t tell me, you asshole!” Rhodey said, actually looking affronted. “Dibs on male first name, you hear me?”
home. Just because you work here now doesn’t mean you can tell us who to invite into it.”
here?”
The thought equally amused and horrified Tony. He’d only been around DUM-E for an hour or so before hell broke loose, but it was very clear that if DUM-E had to decide about some war strategy, he’d probably offer to send the other side flower bouquets and call it a day.
wanted to punch him in his foreign face. “I bet they’ll want to know where you stand by then. Coulson has been meeting with Rosalind Price. She was head of the ATCU, so I suggest you’ll call him, rather sooner than later. Things are moving fast, gentlemen.”
? The guy was actually leaving Steve and Steve was about to ask for his fourth whatever-it-was. Whiskey, probably.
“I understand,” Steve told him, then closed his eyes.
“Yeeaah,” Clint drawled, clapping a hand on Cooper’s shoulder and already pressing two steaming mugs in Tony’s hands. “Guess Uncle Tony is right about that, buddy.”
“Tony…” Steve breathed with wide eyes.
The man next to him, one of the armed guards, offered a nasty grin, taking a step forward. He leaned down, lips pressing to his ear, just as the familiar pain started to surge through every part of his body, whispering, “Just close your eyes and think of America.”
He grinned into the kiss, then scrambled out of bed. Following Steve into the bathroom, Tony took a quick shower, toweling himself off afterwards. When he looked up into the slightly fogged mirror, he met Steve’s gaze and smiled, and that look and his face—even while he was shaving off his non-existent stubble—was somehow full of both appreciation and pensiveness.
“And then there was you, and
At that, Steve’s breath shot from his mouth as he started to come, completely untouched. Tony shut his eyes with how much Steve was squeezing him and jerked forward, thrusting into him hard, feeling Steve quake and tremble beneath him. His lips opened against Steve’s shoulder blade to groan into his skin. Everything stopped for a few perfect little seconds, and then Tony’s orgasm took him as he spilled into Steve, hissing as his body tightened around him further.
"DUM-E?" He blinked, looking around. "Where's Tony?" Because obviously Tony would have to be in the vicinity if DUM-E was set loose on campus. "Did you get lost?"
“If it’s a dream, we’re sharing it.” Instead of drawing away, as Tony had expected, Steve burrowed closer into the embrace, pulling him near against his chest. “So stop talking before it wakes us up.”
“Please,” Tony said, feeling small and vulnerable, and hating himself for it. He took hold of Steve’s uniform, pressing against him. Steve’s breaths were slow and even and Tony tried to mimic the movements, finally managing to pull air into his lungs.
front passenger.
“And we’re good together,” Steve added wistfully. “Or we used to be. Whenever there’s a catastrophe at hand, we all work like a well-oiled machine. Once the fight’s fought, however…”

And now, standing so close to Steve, pressing against him chest to chest, Tony needed desperately to remain angry. To maintain that much of himself. To remember how he felt the moment Steve’s fist had broken through the helmet, hitting him over and over again.
Peggy’d been the first person he’d ever fallen in love with, and he remembered looking at her back then in Italy, and thinking, for the first time in his life, that she could be someone he’d want to spend the rest of his life with.
It took considerable effort to keep himself from shaking in his spot. The headache was ever present, and Steve really needed the distance, but Tony was still
“I know,” he said. “Just… being around Steve has been very depressing lately.”
Slowly, the girl leaned into him, brushing her lips back and forth across his own. He squeezed his eyes shut, shaking his head. When her fingers reached for his fly, unfastening the top button, he shifted away. “Прекрати это.”
“That’s…” Bucky rolled his eyes. “Very helpful, thank you, Thor.”
"You're so good to me," he said, not even sure where the words were coming from as he set a pace. It wasn't particularly fast. Steve wanted to concentrate on each move, draw it out as much as he could without losing the edge.
“We didn’t break up,” Tony explained, at least, he didn’t think so. With the way he’d treated Steve in that cave, he might see that differently. “We just… Sometimes life takes it all away from you, and you gotta fight to get it back, you know? If you plan to make this superhero gig a habit, you’ll have to accept that. Cap and I did.”
“I woke up.”
she breathed. “
"You better keep that promise. I won't hesitate to kick you out otherwise." It was a blunt lie, but Steve didn't mind telling it, since he knew Tony would likely disbelieve it anyway.
Tony sighed, letting go of the arm for a moment. “I do. You’re the only one in the team with a decent taste for coffee. You can tease Steve even more than me. You make Nat giggle, which is as scary as it is awesome and most importantly, Ian adores you, and he’s my boss, so…” He looked at him, and there was nothing in his gaze that suggested he didn’t mean exactly what he said. “I was wary about you first. You and Steve, you have a history that, to be honest, made me kind of jealous. But you’re his best friend, and a decent person, I don’t see why we shouldn’t get along just fine.”
What the hell had he just listened to? He wasn’t even sure he wanted an answer.
His eyes momentarily flickered past Tony, spotting the bedroom, then moved his arms lower and raised Tony upwards—not quite carrying him, but not far from it either.
“Not long,” he replied. “Just… frequently. Steve’s really busy.”
The amount of rhetorical questions he was asking himself was getting a bit worrisome.
“Third,” Steve corrected. He drew back, taking hold of himself as he pulled out of Tony carefully. “If you count the one time in the gym.”
"Thor, make sure Black Widow and Hawkeye are looked after and brought in quickly, will you?" Steve said into the comm, only getting a confirming hum.
“He’s cute when he goes all Captain-y,” Tony told the others.
“My beautiful boy, you’ve gotten so big,” Steve murmured, kissing Ian again, and Tony could’ve stood there forever, just watching them.
“Of course.” Tony chuckled as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. “They know you belong to me now. That makes you one of the most important persons in the whole mansion.”
And yet, he was scared. More scared than the whole time at the front lines. More scared than the moment he’d been injected with the serum, because if Tony looked at him with indifference, Steve wouldn’t know how to keep going.
A cheeky smile crossed Tony’s face, and he brushed a kiss against Steve’s lips. “Did I mention I don’t do bottoming?” he asked, then snorted as Steve’s expression just kind of… fell. He tried not to let it show, but couldn’t hide his obvious surprise.
“I—I don’t know what… what…” Steve stuttered, his voice shaking.
With a last, trembling sigh, Steve came inside Tony once more. And when his glossy, sated eyes met his, Tony’s could have sworn he’d kissed the sun.
It was so hard, seeing him like this. So far, Tony had—despite all of Steve’s fears—managed to never let get Extremis get too far under his skin. He’d always ruled Extremis, Extremis had never ruled him. But in those last few weeks, Tony didn’t just seem ‘distracted’; he seemed to be lost in a whole different world.
“That fucking hurts!”
A smile played around the corners of Bucky’s mouth. “Alright. Count me in, then.”
He didn’t dream of Tony. Once he’d closed his eyes, he didn’t find himself back in the room, he only dreamed of the ice, an endless coldness. Somewhere in the distance, he saw brown eyes boring into him, heard someone call his name, but as soon as he jerked awake in the morning, he was alone.
Steve leaped out of the chair, busying himself with the pizza and pointedly not looking at Bucky. Only once he had it happily baking away in the oven, did he turn around to face the other man, his best friend for most of his life. "I'm sorry, okay?" he said, his voice low, strained. "I'm a shitty coward and I run away from things I can't handle. It's what I do, apparently."
“Thirty years,” Tony said. “Also: Fuck you.”
Then he heard the screams around them and pressed his eyes closed.
When Natasha had left, Bucky trailed into the kitchen, only to come back out a minute later and with a huge bucket of ice cream.
“Doesn’t matter,” Steve said. “Tony already said… he said it was just ‘a’ future, not necessarily ours. The Tony from the other time said something similar. That time travel always creates divergences.”
“The way you tease me and the way you tease Steve are definitely not the same thing, thank god,” Bruce said with a little shake of his head. “I know you had him carry you home last week. He texted me after. He even put you to
The clock went off, and Steve shook his head. This wouldn’t get him anywhere, and the gym was waiting. It usually helped clear his mind, anyway.
Seeing how this was only about their fifth real mission after officially becoming a team, things were looking pretty well coordinated, Tony thought. Steve, as always, was fighting at the front like a good little soldier, with the wonder-twins as back-up. He and Thor kept the skies in check, and Bruce, since he wasn’t jumping around and smashing things, gave clever tips via the comm-line.
He leaned back to look into Steve’s eyes, framing his face with both hands. Unbidden, a smile rose to his face, probably way too giddy and way too much in love, because Steve was right there with him and that was probably the greatest thing that had ever happened to Tony. “But I, uh, guess we have to up our communication skills, discuss things openly, and all that.”
When he finally made his way out of the communal space and into the elevator that would take him to his own floor, Steve pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes, then rubbed his forehead slowly. Why was he hallucinating about Tony of all people? And why were they in ancient Roman clothing? What the hell was his brain doing?
Sam nodded. “I mean… you’ve sorta made out with a married guy.”
“I don’t have any camping equipment.”
TStark (chat_server:46953) connected
Steve smiled despite of himself. It was such a Sam thing to say. “Yeah.”
He didn’t have much cash on him; and tracking his credit cards would be far too easy for people like Ross. Or Tony, if they forced his hand. And they
“My pleasure,” Tony replied, and smiled, though of course Steve couldn’t see it. He made JARVIS do a quick scan of Steve’s body and was relieved when it came up clear. No anomalies, at least not yet. “You sure you don’t feel anything funny? Any pain, weird urges?”
It might be a problem now.
It had been their first real Avengers mission after what had happened in Washington. A lead on a HYDRA research base in Eastern Europe had come up, reports of experimentations on humans led by a high-ranking member of HYDRA called Strucker. So they’d taken a Quinjet and raided the area. The whole building complex had been cleared out, though, and whatever HYDRA camp had once been set up there, they had obviously gotten a heads-up. Strucker had left them a little surprise party though, a few dozens of HYDRA agents that had offered a fair share of resistance. It hadn’t taken the team very long to get the situation under control, but in the end, the mission had still taken up most of the night.
A ship?
The bot stood in the room’s corner, though his claw was moving curiously when Steve walked closer.
Steve paused, huffing a low laugh. His fingers trailed a bit lower, searching the heated skin for—
“Sir,” Steve said after clearing his throat. “I came to explain myself.”
Stane sneered at Tony briefly, reaching into the lapels of his coat jacket to retrieve a piece of paper. “Indeed, I have.”
“Well, if this is the result of Tony trying to work with the authorities,” Clint murmured, “I don’t want to know what happens once he’ll have to call a veto.”
“That’s what I just said, right?” Tony asked. “Apparently your file has been dubbed ‘Supervision Suspended’ by some unknown parties. Government’s throwing a fit, but there’s not much they can do, the documents are sound, no traces of any hacker, so you’ve been cleared for the time being. Doesn’t mean they’ll let you go on missions afterwards. In fact, I’m sure they’re gonna revoke it as soon as they can, but for now, you can consider yourself one of the team.”
“Yeah, I got that,” Tony said with a sympathetic chuckle.
Steve felt his heart beating a little faster, not knowing what to say.
“Tony…” Steve started, as he realized that Tony was leading him in the direction of the bathroom. The idea of showering, of becoming clean, ridding himself of all the ash and dirt felt… wrong. How could he go back to normal just like this? There was so much to do—they would have to call in a press conference, monitor the humanitarian assistance, and he needed to make sure his teammates were alright, he needed—
Yet, Tony had a feeling that… that—
Tony chuckled. “Your denial is starting to lose its charm, you know.”
The others were already sitting around, waiting. Barnes cast them a suspicious look, the others tried to avoid looking at them at all.
Tony snorted. “Yeah… right. I had a couple of broken ribs that told me otherwise.”
Tony nodded as well, and made to stand up. At the door he paused, looking back. “He doesn’t expect you to be the same person, you know? He just wants you to get better.”
Tony smiled sadly. He’d pulled both of Steve’s hands on his lap, brushing his fingers over Steve’s with soothing movements. “I know you tried to save him. And Bucky chose to go with you.”
in. Barnes. Wilson. Rogers.”
Steve snorted, not bothering to keep the façade up any longer. “Just admit it, you’re dying to get home.”
Tony took a deep breath, squeezing Steve’s hand in reassurance. “He’s alive. J brought him to the tower. He's still unconscious, as far as I’m informed, but he’s fine, and healing… almost as fast as you, by the way.”
Pepper huffed loudly enough to attract a few glances.
And it wasn't a confession so much as it was a simple statement.
Ultron pulled the shield out before throwing it back in Steve’s direction. Simultaneously, he fired a blast at him, and Steve had to sidetrack and therefore couldn’t catch the shield in time and watched it toppling to the street.
“Tony,” Steve breathed, irritated. “I—”
And that was it. One of the best friendships of Steve’s life had been trampled to the ground, because he hadn’t managed a decent reaction, and Tony had never spoken to him ever again.
Steve’s eyes widened, as realization hit him. “Wha—”
“Oh Tony,” Steve breathed. He needed to get out. He needed to get out
When Tony turned around, he spotted Vision staring his way.
Steve raised a brow. He hadn’t even talked to the guy yet, hadn’t forwarded him any of the information he had on Tony.
He released a soft breath and let his eyes once more take everything in. “For what it’s worth, I’ve never seen anything so breathtaking,” he told Tony. “Thank you for bringing me here.”
Pepper nodded somberly.
Steve looked both relieved and equally frustrated with Tony. It was a look Tony had been used to getting from Pepper and Rhodey, and he really had to physically bite back a comment on how it had apparently only taken Steve three weeks to get to this point.
But those days were over. For good. The new department was now officially introduced, the investors were lining up to throw money at the company, giving a nice closure to Tony’s first quarter as Stark Industries’ CEO.
Before his comrade so much as reached the car wreck, the woman leaped forward, trying to throw him off the steep slope next to the stairs with the force of her body. And then, she plunged the knife in her hand neatly into his heart. There was no wasted movement in her kill, and not a moment’s hesitation.
"Very well. Shall I inform him of your arrival?" JARVIS' tone was bland enough that Steve couldn't really read if he was satisfied or not. He reminded himself next that it was an AI, a program. It wouldn't have emotions, would it?
, Steve?!”
Tony started to play with his nails. “Anyway, then there was the year from hell, and… well, that’s when we…” He glanced up at him. “And that was… bad.”
“Steve,” he corrected, even as his skin reddened.
Tony snorted and leaned up to kiss Steve’s lips. “True.”
Tony glanced at him timidly. “You did?”
“You’re not going to jail,” Steve said, swinging a roundhouse kick at two robots flying by, sending them to the wall across the bridge they were standing on. “These are… I’m sure Tony’s lawyers will come up with a fancy name, ‘Circumstances of potentially apocalyptic significance’, or something. You’re needed, it’s an emergency, they have to understand that.”
And what a downfall it was.
"You feel so good," he murmured, soaking up that pink flush on Steve's cheeks. Just being here in Steve's presence, he felt like he'd kissed the sun, only it was much sweeter than he could have ever foreseen. It was like opening himself up for a better part of his life, and for the first time not being rejected before he even got there.
“I’ve done my fair share of bad, too.”
During the next couple of days, Tony spent most of his time in the workshop, discussing time travel and its risks with Bruce and Stephen Strange.
When he was sure Tony was done talking, Steve reached over and took Tony's hand again in both of his, letting his thumbs run along the back of it.
, and that was…
“Oh and—Mr. Stark?”
“Then how about we’ll keep it a secret, between you and me.”
He currently stood at the bar, watching the people mingle in the ballroom. Tony had to greet each of the guests, schmoozing his way around the room, and if Steve had ever doubted that Tony belonged in this world of glitz and glamour, he stood corrected now. Along the way, Tony introduced Steve to so many people he did not even bother trying to remember all their names. It didn’t matter anyway.
Of course he cared about Steve.
And the world veered off its axis again, as Tony brought down the hammer and was engulfed with the plant's pollen.
“You said that ten minutes ago.”
The next day, Tony was making a weary trek through the empty hotel suite. There wasn’t a chance he could get any sleep like this. Part of him had been hoping for Steve to come with him to Washington, but he didn’t seem able to just leave Barnes’ side, and Tony wasn’t going to put him on the spot by asking.
Was it his friends that brought this out? Steve wished he knew. But whatever it was, he never wanted to spoil this moment for him—to shut out the light and bring back the darkness.
Tony guessed he was right. The world had come undone around them, swallowing friends and foes alike. Tony had stopped taking note of the body count at some point.
Tony sighed. “It’s tough for everyone.”
Steve sighed. Sure. Why not the hell not. “What about me, then?”
“No.”
Rhodey tossed her a sympathetic glance. He was wringing his fingers nervously. “Doesn’t matter. Don’t really think the UN cares what we decide. If we fail to bring them in, they’ll try to arrest them on their own. And that might not end well.”
The place was exactly how Steve remembered it from his childhood. There was the overpriced gift shop littered with thousands upon thousands outdated products. Before entering the first hall, an old man took their entry fees and gave them a pamphlet guide.
Tony grinned mischievously as he leaned up. “Absolutely not.”
“Stop freaking out, Tony.”
“Tony?” Steve prompted, wanting to take it all back at once. Whatever horrors Tony associated with the workshop, Steve wanted no part in them if it made Tony look like
His Devil Face. It had returned to him at long last.
Sam nodded in agreement. “Steve’s the perfect mother hen.”
It took him five whole minutes and a lot of prodding to get Steve’s address. He knew Steve was living at some apartment complex near the arts faculty, and the taxi driver changed route without so much as batting an eye.
“The implants left no permanent damage as far as I can see.”
So much could change in his sleep. And maybe he’d get to meet Tony after all.
Steve nodded, his eyes growing distant with shades of remembrance.
And almost as if she read his mind—almost as if to illustrate that point—Natasha brushed a thumb across his cheek, murmuring, while she did so, “Let’s not do that again.”
A surprised chuckle left Tony’s lips when Steve pulled him back by the hand and drew him into a kiss before they had even reached the bed.
Tony knew all this, it only mattered that there might’ve been a way to save Bucky. “I could’ve saved him!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Endless moments later, Tony’s trembling voice echoed over the comm-line. “Fire,” he said, and the sound was hollow and empty. “Fire, now.”
Bruce, however, looked exhausted and shaken, staring down at his hands without really doing anything aside from massaging steady circles into the sole of Tony’s naked feet.
,” Tony snapped without even turning around. With a brush of his hand, he swiped the contents on the working table in front of him to the floor, then leaned down on it with both hands.
The floor trembled with the weight of Tony’s confession. Steve had known where the story went, of course, but now, he couldn’t help but shiver. His eyes flickered over to where a few boats stood anchored to the floor with thick ropes, wondering which of them it had been.
Steve was having none of it, he put a finger on Tony’s chin and pulled him in, taking a content breath as their mouths met.
Light was all around him—blazing white, hot, and cruel. Nothing else. Nothing at all for what seemed like an eternity. Then, the world appeared again in a blinding whirl of color and sound, and Steve was thrown on the ground so hard that it knocked the breath from his body.
Blindly, he took hold of the bedcovers and draped it over them.
No, it meant
[New Client2] [chat_server:46956]
Adrenaline was still spiking through Steve’s veins, and the battle with Johann Schmidt was on constant replay in his mind. He had freed Bucky—had managed to find his still-alive friend against all odds, and now, he could finally do what he had always wanted to do.
“Null Time Sequencer, yes. And no—we want
have a presentation tomorrow? At your alma mater? Weren’t they planning a gala for you, honoring the anniversary of your graduation? What kind of anniversary was that again?”
Like they had suddenly found the perfect way to coexist and Tony just didn’t remember it.
“Not sure how we can get through this by fake-fighting them,” Rhodey said, his voice thoughtful. “Especially if
“We reap as we sow,” Steve intoned, cupping Tony’s cheek with his left hand. “I don’t like my life without you either. It’s been all out hell.”
“But—”
On the next beat, shots were ringing all around them.
“You dog!” Tony exclaimed and laughed. “Congrats.”
“It makes you stronger?” Steve asked warily. He hoped Tony wasn’t in constant pain, but his features looked relaxed enough, his breathing not as deep as it could be, but not too shallow either.
good guy, and more importantly: they were happy—still happy, even after three years and counting. After a rocky start, they had ended up becoming one of those sickeningly cute couples that still kissed and hugged and caressed each other whenever they had the chance. They bickered and argued, too, sure… sometimes more than Tony was comfortable with, but they loved each other, they
He’d made him laugh, he’d challenged him… and he’d saved his life.
, wasn’t much of a surprise. He replayed those last two minutes in his mind, trying to wade through his own admittedly not very straightforward words, but coming up empty.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Which one?”
Tony took his hand once more and led him through the gates. Steve smiled, because having someone to hold his hand at a funeral, that’s what he had been looking for for years, at every single grave he’d had to stand. His father’s. His mother’s. Friends. Family. He had known… holding himself together the day Peggy died would be one of the most difficult things Steve would have to do.
Steve's eyes flew open and he threw his hands forward, palms open to grasp his attacker by the shoulders. He rolled them over, hands smoothly gripping at the offender's neck.
And it was good; being close to Steve again. Tony might have to admit that it had been a stupid thing to do—to just block Steve out because he’d been embarrassed. He’d just thought that Steve had been well and truly disgusted with him, but that obviously wasn’t the case, so…
was… something else entirely. It was hot and slick and soft groans and trembling limbs. They were rolling and pushing against one another like oil and vinegar, moving in tandem as their climaxes built. Every time Steve pulled back, Tony moved to slide down the length of him, rolling his hips until their bodies were touching again. And all the while, Steve stayed safe and steady on top of him, his cock throbbing inside Tony, while he kissed him so sweetly he could cry.
“Okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Peggy said in mock-drama and with a light chuckle. “That’s usually followed by you doing something drastic like… crashing a plane into the Atlantic.”
Steve would never forget him, though. That much he knew. He would go on, sure, but he would carry these days with him forever.
“I’ve never seen him with friends. I guess I never… He seems happy, not so burdened,” Barnes observed. “He’s different from what I remember.”
For a second, Tony contemplated taking Steve up on that dare. A countdown. How old did Steve think he was, five? Still, Steve had that determined no-bullshit look going for him, and Tony really didn’t want to wake up the whole dorm right now.
What if he was already too late now?
“Will you tell Steve?” Barnes asked, and he studied Tony with intensity that could melt an iceberg. For some reason, Tony had the feeling he was being tested.
Tony’s mouth opened with a question on his lips, when understanding finally dawned on him. “Shit, you thought it’d kill me.”
“Since I started behaving like a Grade A asshole.” Tony smiled kindly. “I tend to get carried away when I want to have something.”
His arms locked around Tony, one hand smoothing down the tense line of his back, while the other cupped Ian’s tiny head protectively. “Nothing will make me leave your side… I promise.”
“Wait,” Tony grunted—not his robotic voice, his real one. His eyes were brown and he panted, obviously exhausted, as he leaned back in the chair.
“I’m still doing that,” Steve said. “Every moment here with you is one of those memories I’ll want to look back on when I’m old and frail. These might not be the best days of my life, but they’re still amazing, because you’re here, with me.” He smiled, kissing along the lines of his goatee. “Loving me.”
Clint huffed, pointing back and forth between Thor and Bruce. “And what am I supposed to do, exactly? Cheering them on?”
“It was Rhodey’s idea!” Tony whirled around, pointing a finger at him. “And I need him to be there with me for this, so there wasn’t a choice, alright? Now leave and let me set-up the goddamn tent.”
Steve wanted to pull him into his arms. He wanted to do so many things, but in that moment, Tony’s words registered with him. And when they did, Steve didn’t know what to think.
There were things they both needed to face. The world outside waited with a whole bunch of people who would not understand, and the next catastrophe was already somewhere down the road. It didn’t matter, though. Nothing mattered right now. Tony’s arms were around him.
A second later, Tony was braced on his arms above him and Steve felt the length of his naked body sliding against him, chest and stomach and hips pressing into his. Tony made an odd sort of movement, a kind of side-to-side wriggle of his hips, settling himself between Steve’s thighs.
“Yeah, it’s awesome,” Rhodey said with a cheeky grin as he let the suit disassemble around him.
The Quinjet started to descend towards the city’s outskirts. Steve offered a hand and Tony eventually pulled himself to a stand.
“But I’m sorry, too, for the record,” he added. “For attacking him, I mean.”
There was something else; an unspoken fear lurking deep in his mind; one Steve didn’t want to breach but it was similarly something he felt they needed to discuss. And as Tony ushered him across the threshold leading to his penthouse—he felt his nerves dancing.
And Steve was desperate to keep his eyes on him—addicted, as he was, to the sight of Tony’s gorgeous face. And now that he was all but convinced this was real—or as real as the dream allowed—the thought that he was truly doing this with another man was nearly too much to handle.
“He wanted to get away from all that,” she said, sounding more wary than ever.
, Steve. No need to hold back anymore…”
Tony didn’t want him to know certain things, Steve also knew he had to hear this eventually.
Steve chuckled. “He’s a charmer,” he observed. “He’s stolen everyone’s heart.”
Slowly, Tony turned his head on the bench, glancing over his shoulder at Steve. He was still panting, too, and his eyes were not-so-subtly fixed on Tony’s ass. That was quite the sight, probably, but somehow, Tony couldn’t find it in himself to be self-conscious about any of this. He only just managed to press his sweat-laced hands against the bench’s steel frame, raising his upper body with a long, trembling sigh to lie down more comfortably.
In seconds, Tony watched as Sokovia got torn apart, rock and soil flying everywhere, and the only thought he managed to conjure up was that while they had certainly managed to save most of Sokovia’s population, surely not everyone could have made it.
Because if Tony lost all hope, so would Steve.
“You. I need you,” Steve swore ardently, pulling Tony closer. His now free hand settled at Tony’s boxers, pulling them down over his ass in one go.
There was silence so thick you could cut it with a knife. The others sent Tony looks that tried hard not to be accusing or pitying or variations of the two, before they made to leave, too.
Bucky hummed, and withdrew the knife again.
He knew SHIELD had plans for him. They wanted him back in full-strength as soon as possible. Therefore, his week would be packed with many things. Like talking to a psychiatrist. And learning more about the new world. And training routines with Barton and Natasha.
. No bulk—not like himself, just strong definition; and he moved all easy and unselfconscious, as if... as if he had been naked in front of Steve a thousand times, as well.
Steve sat up, grasping Tony’s wrists and stopping him. Tony sent him a questioning look that Steve answered with a shy smile, his inquisitive fingers itching to take to the undressing-part himself. “Let me.”
“Do you have the keys?” Steve asked, realizing that the others were somehow up and about and he hadn’t even realized.
“You over it?” Steve asked.
“Where’s Steve?”
“Asgardian?” Bruce prompted, as soon as he’d sat down.
There were steps behind them and Steve smiled at Scott as he got out of the van as well. Clint had called an hour ago, telling him that Scott had agreed to join their group. Apparently Sam knew him from a few months ago though he refused to go into detail. Still, Steve had a good feeling with him.
“What are you thinking of?” a sleep-kissed voice asked, startling Steve.
“Thought you visited her regularly?”
He grinned toothily, grinding down because the position called for it. “Well. My first official act will probably be letting you fuck me on my new shiny CEO desk, and then, yeah, I will fire him.”
Steve sighed. “Not like that,” he amended, trying to gentle his expression a bit. “Just a few hours to clear my head.”
“She’s fine. Didn’t get hurt.”
Steve tried to jerk his wrists out of Tony’s grip—his mind on one-track to remove his clothing—but Tony refused to release him. He could’ve broken free, of course, and easily so, but right now, he was willing to follow Tony’s lead. So he just kissed back; he kissed Tony and the earth ceased moving.
, we can't really have sex down here, can we?"
And maybe that was Natasha’s whole point.
It was reckless and completely insane, no matter how hopeless the situation looked right now.
it, Steve. You damn well owe me that much.”
He didn’t know if he could deal with Tony’s rejection, though he knew in his heart that it awaited him on the other side of the ‘corridor’, as Tony had put it.
[Vision] [chat_server:46958]
“Hmmm,” Rhodey agreed and there was the slightest tug of a smug grin at the corners of his mouth.
But he didn’t.
As memories of their childhood flooded his mind, memories of laughter, whispered promises and shared sorrow, a sharp pain jittered up his spine. His brain was too clogged with the barriers of self-loathing. He shouldn’t be allowed good memories. He’d taken life after life, and with perfect indifference in his heart. So many men, women, even children. He remembered shooting Howard and his wife like it had meant nothing to him. Remembered what it had felt like to pull the trigger with perfect clarity. And while those memories ripped him apart, at least he deserved them.
“No, I’ve told you all that I’m going to. Do you think this is easy for me? Being here with you, having to work with you, knowing how much you secretly hated me the whole damn time? Wondering if you maybe still do.” He shook his head. “The only reason I’m even bothering with you is…”
He’d already finished breakfast and put his hand on Steve’s once more, brushing a thumb over the back of his hand. “Well, at least there’s nothing that could go wrong with
old,” Steve countered as he neared him.
Everyone came together, with fists or weapons, and soon enough, chaos broke loose. Tony couldn’t exactly miss his targets, but his moves were predictable at best, and they’d trained together long enough that he could be sure the others would find a way to dodge his beams.
What if this was exactly Ultron’s plan? Separating Tony from the rest of the group?
Nodding his head, Steve leaned in to kiss Tony's cheek. "I'll make sure she doesn't scare you too much," he said, mock serious, and then pulled back again to look over Tony's form. The memory of his nakedness draped over that bench press was making its way to the front of his thoughts, but when Steve looked to Tony's face, there was something… not quite off, but just…
“Please,” he pleaded. By the end of it, Tony’s chest was littered with little bite marks, thin trails of saliva, where Steve’s tongue had made its course.
“Well, this is embarrassing,” Tony said, coming back to his only decent thought and glancing up at Steve, who… had a ring in his hand, while awkwardly scratching the back of his head.
But that wasn’t the case. Tony just wanted Steve, and he always had.
In the background, Tony heard the others talk quietly, with Natasha scanning their files, trying to find how much Ultron had plainly deleted, and what he was making use of. With the ringing in his ear, Tony didn’t get half of what they were saying, and he didn’t need to. He had been hands-deep inside those neuro-nets, and it was clear that if Ultron had access to the internet… he was long gone, and everything with him.
Sighing, Tony rubbed his forehead. He hadn’t even managed to organize DUM-E’s transportation to New York, yet.
“I’m sorry you had to find out like that,” Steve said, a shadow falling over his face. “I never wanted you to. It might change everything.”
As soon as they approached the large RV, they overheard a heated debate about driving arrangements between Rhodes, Tony and his father, which apparently resulted in Howard yelling ‘how his credit card had paid for the fucking Winnebago, and this trip was a complete waste of time anyway and everyone was going to do as he fucking said or else’. He ordered for Rhodes to drive, because in his opinion, he was the only one with ‘hair on his chest’. Then he had knocked back his whiskey, mumbled something incoherent to Tony and walked back into the house.
“What is it, then?”
It wouldn’t have killed him, but the sentiment was very clear.
“Look. Let’s just drop it for today. We’re getting nowhere, and I’m really, really tired.”
Vision smiled, and he realized it was likely the first smile ever to reach his lips since he’d been transformed into this strange body.
A choked up moan left Tony’s lips, followed by a keening sound that was so excruciatingly erotic that Steve came hard without any sort of warning, his sight whitening out for a moment as he felt Tony shudder and groan helplessly against him as he too fell over the edge.
“I thought you’d like it.” Tony smiled gently. He walked over to him, his thumb stroking the back of Steve’s hand. “And I hoped you might come here again, sometime. When I work. You could stay here and draw a little,” Tony suggested.
Tony held up his hand. “Stay out of this.”
“No. It’s probably not, right?” Tony asked, shaking with a mixture of laughter and pure horror. Of course they didn’t get it, how could they? How could they understand that everything—
“You said we’re leaving in half an hour,” Tony reminded him. “Can’t be much longer than twenty now…”
“The Chitauri wasn’t something that couldn’t be destroyed,” he pointed out. “I’m out of my depth. Ultron can hide about everywhere, get into every bit of tech, and come back out of it stronger.”
There was a pause.
Sometimes Tony really hated his life.
At that, Tony grinned. “Endless sexcapades, you mean? Why, Detective, I never would’ve thought.”
“You won’t have to find out,” Steve said, moving even closer. “I promise.”
“What?” Tony asked with a raised brow. “That your brain gets overwhelmed with seventy plus years of jumbled memories? Yes, that’s perfectly normal. Call it a side-effect. There will be triggers, but you’ll learn how to deal with them in time. And while you do that, you have a bunch of superheroes around you who can deal with you not dealing. Steve’s a tough cookie, you know that better than anyone. That little black eye there? Is probably already healed, alright?”
On one hand, Natasha had told him about her own visions and Clint's, but what they were seeing had actually
Tony raised an eyebrow, smile firmly in place. Steve couldn’t remember seeing him do anything but smile the entire evening, and he probably wasn’t faring any better. “Did you tie a red ribbon around your dick? Because, I gotta tell you, my plans for tonight are kinda single-minded.”
“I don’t know,” Steve said truthfully, though he remembered a green light coming for him, which would mean…
happened? Why did Stane hold so much power over Tony? And would he truly do whatever Stane told him to?
Steve slowly leaned down and pressed his lips against the arc reactor, then licked one of Tony’s nipples.
Tony stopped in his tracks and stared at him.
“You are,” Rhodey insisted and leaned even closer. “Are you… I mean, are you actually into that prof? Tones, he has to be at least ten years older than—”
“You think you can just do that?” Tony snapped with palpable anger in his eyes. “You let me wait here for hours! I thought something
“Yeah, he got off the grid. I was sure we had him—for a moment, but he managed to escape.” Steve’s heaved a low breath. “Wish we could’ve put an end to this. Now we have to start all over again.”
meant as a compliment. I just thought we wouldn’t be so good together.”
“Steve?” a robotic voice called.
Automatically entwining their fingers when he met Steve’s amused gaze, Tony smiled. “Sorry for standing you up,” he said. “I kinda lost track of the time.”
to. The only thing I know how to make is the goddamn Thanksgiving dinner menu, and I can’t exactly make him turkey. And I also can’t order pizza all the time either, since that’s not very healthy. And then there’s not just dinner… There’s breakfast and lunch, and I have to make sure Ian eats a healthy breakfast and I don’t—”
“And were we
strong. Stronger than any man he’d ever faced. Heck, Steve was halfway convinced he could take it on with a whole dozen of enemies right now, and still come out alive on the other side. His muscles vibrated with power, his heart was going a mile per minute, and he felt the urge to run, to move, to
And in that moment, Tony… Tony knew exactly what he wanted. Of course he knew it. Had
“Nothing I built is a let-down, wing-boy,” Tony said with a smile. “So, I take it you were pretty good with maneuvering them?”
“Nah,” Tony said, unable to stop his mouth from tilting into a half-smile. He tried to get a glimpse at the ring, but Steve still had his hand closed around it. “That sounds exhausting. Think I might just take what I’ve got here and leave it to you to make up for this… very
“So you don’t want to me to put it to you?”
Something rustled in the far distance.
. Right where Steve could make sure to keep it that way.
Tony forced his feet to the door and carried himself across the threshold. He hadn’t bothered to change clothes before coming here, too busy freaking out about what he might find. And though it sort of surprised him that he was able to care at all about his appearance right now, the part of him concerned with Steve dumping him in about five minutes burned with the need to at least look the part while he did so.
“You’re kissing me,” Tony murmured, regaining some ground. There would be a moment to cry his heart out, but that moment clearly wasn’t now.
“You can say that again.” Tony turned to him. “Did you just say ‘fuck’?”
Tony sighed. Nodded. “And he’d lose.”
The cheers that erupted from the balconies were almost as loud as the fireworks that crackled, surely calling everyone’s attention. Tony used that moment to lean up and kiss Steve square on the mouth. “Guess you’re lucky I’m putting up with you.”
“What are we gonna do with him?”
He shook his head, banishing those thoughts from his mind.
They started with the grounds around the house. The grounds of the Graham Mansion were as big as the estate of Stark Mansion—not so much in structure as in means of acreage. There was a restaurant with bar on the premises, a pond and a gazebo. The gift shop was in the back alongside the courtyard. The property was surrounded by a number of bare-branched beech trees; and the whole appearance, all except the cars and the definite hum of passing traffic, made its origin more authentic.
It was worth
"Not a ghost," Steve countered. "Just…" He waved a hand vaguely. "I dreamed about you this morning… Thought about calling. So, just a bit strange to see you now. How've you been?"
“I know.”
It had taken a single glance at Bucky and half a minute later, they’d stepped outside, and the fresh air along with splitting log after log in half was doing wonders to his mind.
There was a considerate pause and visible surprise on Steve’s face. Bucky sat back down next to him and… this felt strangely formal—two people walking on eggshells although they’d shared so much with each other. He was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to hug Steve, or at least shake his hand or something, but he didn’t really know how to proceed with that.
There was every chance he’d regret this in the morning. Every chance that they’d be back to square one. He had to savor this, had to make use of what he had, had to…
* * *
Tony huffed. “I can’t care for you the whole time. You’d starve.”
“And you’ll be there for the rest of it,” she mused with a soft sigh. Peggy met his eyes again and they shared a small, private smile. “I’m so happy for you.”
Another ring. His phone kept blinking, and eventually, Steve reached for it.
“I've been looking for you,” he said, glancing meaningfully at Natasha. “Maria just called. Project Pegasus is down.”
Tony hummed, making Steve chuckle. “Jealous?”
up, so…”
Thank you all so much for your comments and... So sorry for the delay - life's been a bit busy lately. I hope you all had a great start into 2018, the year I will probably look back on as the year 'Marvel ultimately broke my heart'. Ugh.
Tony sighed and rubbed his forehead. “For now, there’s nothing we can do. Maria and I have been trying to establish the Avengers as an official defense institution, but it’s just… they’re really making it fucking difficult.”
For a long time, it was as though time slowed to a crawl. He could feel things happening around him—vague, unseen movements and sounds he could not fully comprehend. He was awake, and then he was not. And every time he woke up after that, new memories had returned to him. And as if in a dream, he heard people coming in and out of the room, asking him questions like ‘How are you’—something he had not needed to answer for a long time.
An impressive few leaps on her part, and Tony staggered backward with a knife between his eyes, just an inch from piercing his forehead, before she pulled it back again.
He’d never really been a cuddler in bed, he prefered his own space, hadn’t once managed to fall asleep as long as there was another person pressed up against him, and yet… here he was. Tangled into Steve and sleeping like a baby.
That had Tony huff at him, sounding almost angry. “That’s all?”
? But you never allowed me to… I asked like… a
“You’re right about
before it was literally too late.
Steve didn’t remember this day.
"Stay there," he said once he managed to recover some composure. He shifted off of Tony to grab for the bag and rummage through it.
God, Steve had been such an idiot for not seeing it sooner. The raw emotion in Tony’s gaze when they’d discussed the Accords, his gaze almost swimming in tears when he’d looked at him in Siberia.
“Take the tour through the house,” Carol said, then looked around. “Right?”
They would make sure of it.
The thought, the mere suggestion, made Steve’s stomach churn. His jaw tightened. “I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.”
At home, Tony immediately went to Ian’s baby room. Vi had put him into bed for a quick nap and gave Tony a short goodbye hug before she left.
At first, neither of them spoke. Tony seemed uneasy, and his gaze shifted from Steve’s face down to his hands. “You’re hurt.” His voice was low, almost casual, as he caressed the scraped knuckles.
Steve forced himself to blank out his mind and fall asleep since no good, no good at all was going to come out of staying awake.
He let go of Steve’s shoulders, putting both hands on his face instead, gently stroking along his cheekbones. The guy was unreal, all deep blue eyes and kissable lips. There were a few drops of sweat lining his brows and Tony leaned up to kiss each one of them away.
Steve vehemently shook his head, and the moment that followed stretched forever. Steve was panting almost as hard as he was, studying him intently. And Tony couldn’t look away, willing Steve to understand. The ground on which he stood trembled beneath his feet.
“I am impressed. I anticipated more difficulties.” His master smiled. “Gut gemacht, Soldat.”
“Awesome!” Steve called, looking way too enthusiastic just because a bunch of people had apparently died in here. Tony should probably find it more worrying than sweet.
Wanda’s expression remained impassive, but Steve could’ve sworn one corner of her mouth ticked upwards all the same.
* * *
Once this was over, he’d shove his pride down on the ground, and put back together what he’d broken.
Steve smiled, and leaned in to brush a soft kiss on Tony’s nose. “I think you’re right.” When he looked back down, Tony could practically hear Steve’s breath hitch at the sight.
“Yes,” Tony agreed. “In fact, I think that… you and me going camping is a really great idea. Unexpected, maybe. But great.”
“Tony, please say something,” Steve prompted, while slowly pulling his shield from the back holder.
Steve swallowed. He knew Tony had a point, and he wouldn’t argue with him on this. He looked at Bucky for a long moment, before he stood up. Then, he reached out a hand and pulled him up. “You alright?” Steve asked.
, all right, all right,” Tony breathed and—ever so casually—moved his hips backwards. “Jesus, when did you get so shameless? Just give me a minute. Or two. We need to at least say goodbye before we blow this joint and I probably shouldn’t do that with a boner.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said. “I’m so sorry. I don’t… I was so sure you hated me. If you’d said something—”
“Now’s really not a good time, Steve,” Tony murmured after a moment, fingers trailing along DUM-E’s claw that was still trying to find something it could greet properly.
For the span of the next day, Steve tried to stay away from Tony as best as he could within the confined space of the RV. He couldn’t think with him around, with his gaze always trailing to Steve like he was waiting for him to say something already.
The elevator soared higher still.
, Tony’s voice echoed over the comm line. And, then, over their private channel, “Steve, copy now, or I swear to God—”
state the more than obvious—we’re running out of time.”
Tony shivered, shaking his head. “I can’t let you die,” he said urgently. “Maybe if I tell you how—“
"Listen to me very carefully," Steve said, his voice lowered to a mere hiss. He knew he didn't have more than a few seconds to make a point before Stane regained his bearings and tried fighting back. That would make words redundant, and Steve preferred words to outright violence. "You will treat Tony with respect. Do we understand each other?"
He hadn’t known how to reply, so he hadn’t said anything at all and only watched as the others left the room.
Anyway: I want to thank the wonderful
Fury cleared his throat. “Well, I know this might be difficult, but for the purpose of finding out what happened with Mrs. Stark, we’ll have to go over the previously recorded testimonies.”
"Hey, kid, don't go falling asleep before you tell me where you live," he scolded gently. He definitely shouldn't be enjoying this as much as he was, nor be flattered that Tony apparently liked his sweaty smell.
Prep was good and well, not that he didn’t enjoy it, but they’d been doing this for years, very regularly, and letting Steve stretch him on his cock was one of the simpler pleasures. This was as much about love as it was about reassurance. And for that, Tony didn’t want to wait any longer.
"Breathe, Tony. It's just you and me here. You can ask for anything you need," he said slowly, smiling slightly. "Can't promise I'll go through with it, but if you don't ask, we won't know." He kissed Tony's cheek, pressing their bodies firmly together. His face felt flushed, so hot he could feel it throbbing.
This might not be permanent, but it had left a permanent mark in Steve’s heart. All he could do right now was enjoy it and hope it wouldn’t hurt too much when he remembered who they were…
Tony smiled and brushed his fingers through Steve’s hair. “I probably will at some point, give me a little time.”
The rest of the morning routine passed rather quickly, and they were fed and on their way to SI sooner than Steve had anticipated. He kept sending worried looks at Tony. The closer they got to the place, the more Tony fidgeted, and it was clear he was pretty nervous about the ordeal they were about to face. That was all the more reason they should go through with it, Steve thought, and reached over to put a soothing hand over Tony's thigh.
“The facility was home, too,” he said. “Home was wherever the team was. At least, for me.”
There was the slightest tremor in her voice; one more thing that was so clearly different about her.
Right.
“Not so much anymore, no.”
Bucky just nodded, breathing in, and nodded some more.
Steve let himself slump forward over the railing, needing just a second. “Stand by.”
They could go to that agency, decide how to do this and… start a family. And dammit, he
Steve fought the feeling to glance over his shoulder guiltily. They were alone, but
It was almost too easy. The twins and the one HYDRA agent were staring towards where the noise was coming from, and Tony could see as Steve raised his shield, probably wanting to knock the agent out with a smooth blow—when, suddenly, Wanda cast a blast of magic at the agent herself.
“It’s all true.”
“So…” Natasha began with a little amused huff and raised both hands to Steve’s head to smooth down his hair. “I hope he made it good.”
beneath, and even back then, he had known that this might just be the beginning.
“This is crazy,” Tony gasped, pulling his mouth away from Steve’s. He didn’t put up a fight when Steve turned them around, hovering over him now. Instead, his legs went around his waist automatically, pulling him back down.
Steve’s free hand slapped him playfully. “Our teammates are not sprogs.”
Tony met Steve’s eyes and felt a shiver run down his spine, his hands impatiently tearing at Steve’s uniform trousers. “Baby, I’ll keep on wanting you forever,” he whispered, yanking the belt away and jerking his fly down with more impatience than he cared to display. Didn’t matter, though. Steve’s cock sprang into his hands, after Tony dragged the pants down over Steve’s ass, and he was rewarded with a moan in turn.
With a firm grip on Steve’s arm, Tony suddenly led him around a corner and into the darkness of the balcony. “Don’t ever say something like that again,” he hissed. “Ever. You hear me? I owe Obi
to us. What the hell makes you think he’d sign a contract?”
Another arrow; Tony ducked gracefully, and instead threw back a kick that landed Clint on the ground.
“Yeah, we would if we could,” Tony said. “But the TVA confiscated one, and Doom destroyed the other before it could be discovered. There’s actively no way we can get our hands on a Sequencer here. They’re already gone.”
The bastard had always been too perceptive for his own good. And apparently, some of that knowledge had survived the transition. Once again, Tony wondered how much of JARVIS actually remained in the Vision.
“Sure it is,” Tony replied and shot a repulsor as a distraction, followed by a small-caliber rocket. “It’s a game. And we’re all losing.”
“So, there were only two suites free, but there’s… two separate bedrooms in each,” he explained, clearing his throat. “I’ll take the suite over here, and you can both have a room in the other—”
Tony rubbed his forehead, immediately in defense-mode. “I’m not sulking.”
been. He’d never even denied it. And that meant that he was still Steve’s partner, his… whatever they’d been heading towards.
It took all of his willpower to turn around and walk away. The sight of Tony so relaxed and sensual followed him all the way to the meadow, and all of Steve’s concentration went to his groin as he tried to will his erection and the images of Tony away.
