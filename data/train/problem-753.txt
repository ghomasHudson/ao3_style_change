Sherlock frowned. That was an odd, uncharacteristically sentimental thought. It rather surprised him.
A collective, stifled chorus of gasps, screams, and groans swelled into the air as John winced and shook his left hand, wiping away the scarlet blood smeared across his knuckles with a grimace.
John was totally unprepared for the sudden and shockingly hefty weight of Sherlock launching himself from his rickety chair and tackling John onto the grubby kitchen floor. Rather violently and, as John's back landed against the floor with a jarring
"I mean everything I say. Everything. Often it's for the sake of a case, it may be a falsification, or, as you would say, a 'lie,' but I still mean it. False words can remedy the most wretched of deeds. John...fanciful speech aside...I don't want you to be with anyone else."
John stared hazily at the blood that had already, unbelievably, soaked his entire upper arm and was streaming in bright rivulets from his elbow, wrist, and fingertips. He vaguely heard Sherlock's sobbing, frantic breaths, and managed to clear his throat. "Gonna need...a new shirt." He laughed woozily…before everything ebbed away into aching darkness.
"Sherlock? Sweetheart, are you all right?" John's voice was rough and scratchy and Sherlock opened his eyes to find John hovering above him, concerned, lips red and swollen. Sherlock surged upward, kissing John as passionately as he could, trying to taste himself in John's mouth and moaning when he did.
"Did you ruin the last pair?" John whispered teasingly near Sherlock's ear, laughing softly and Sherlock responded with a short huff of nervous laughter- then tensed at the first brush of calloused fingertips against the top of his pelvis. They glided down, down, down and stopped just short of where he wanted them to be. John's fingers sifted through Sherlock's hair and he spread his legs further apart, wordlessly urging John to go lower.
Sherlock huffed out a breath and reached for John's cock again, encircling it in his hand and, after feeling it throb in his hand repeatedly, stroked downward forcefully.
The crotch of Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms was saturated with his clear enjoyment, clinging to the rigid length of his penis and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. Sherlock exhaled and shivered in delight, shifting to grind down against both John’s hand and his crotch in eagerness. By the look and feel of him, John was sure he was already on the edge of orgasm, and the increasing tremors in his thighs and hips only verified his presumption. Sherlock leaned down for a soft, lingering, teasing sort of kiss, keeping the contact light and provocative, and gave in to his need to rut against John for several, erratic, lustful moments, before he forced himself to stop and pulled back, pushing up onto his knees above John.
"If you're going to do that...hurry it up...if you're not finished in five minutes I'm going," Sherlock growled, unsure whether he was more frustrated at being delayed in the investigation, or at his own cock's less-than-ideal eagerness in the proceedings.
"Christ, Sherlock, I forgot. Open the rest of the cookies?" Sherlock could hear the helpless, goofy grin without having to see it.
Sensing John's underlying discomfort, Sherlock seized his face on the main road. The sky was a polluted grey-black, the air foggy and freezing.
"I was properly motivated," John shrugged easily, smooching him with an extravagant moan, and laughing happily into the kiss as he bumped his hips against Sherlock once more.
John watched as Sherlock plucked up bottles of lubricant, choosing one of everything and scattering the packages atop the pineapples like naughty, suggestive confetti.
John relented somewhat, taking Sherlock's face in both hands, cupping his hard, red-stained cheekbones, hypnotised by his plump lips and inebriated pale eyes. "Beautiful."
He slid the fabric from John's shoulders, running his hands greedily down the exposed skin, feeling the flex and pull of John's muscles beneath his palms. John arched beneath his touch, breathing heavily.
"...Thankyou, Sherlock," John grinned, easing away his lovers' anxiety. "Do you want me to tell you what I find attractive about you?" The doctor asked, chuckling to himself, as he smooched Sherlock's collarbone.  "You're a narcissist, so I can guess the answer," John added.
"No, no. it's…fine. Um…do it again." Sherlock uttered awkwardly, his cheekbones blooming a delicious, rosy pink. John smirked and reached for Sherlock again and Sherlock watched those hands, so skilled in so many ways, come closer and closer. He stared down at them as they came up and framed his face, going almost cross-eyed to keep them in his line of sight as they cupped his cheeks, rough and warm against his skin. John's thumb brushed over Sherlock's cheekbone and only years and years of pride kept Sherlock from arching into the contact. His throat went dry at the sensation, a hot fluttering swooping and diving through his chest as John slowly leaned closer...and closer... Sherlock's eyes widening the closer he got.
Sherlock wrenched the door open and, avoiding looking at John, plucked the needlessly elaborate card from his hands. He frowned as he scanned it then handed it back to John with a derisive snort.
“…Sexually? From a massage?” Sherlock sounded far too interested, amused and satirical at the concept. “Hm – Didn’t you go through physio? How on earth did you manage?” Sherlock’s fingers abruptly spread out, quite possessively, promiscuously, and then were dragged up John’s spine to his nape, before he stopped.
Sherlock, in the over-decorated private room that was trying far too hard to be sumptuous, pocketed the bundle of notes, before his mouth was molested by the older man’s, an inelegant tongue prodding against his lips, whilst eager hands squeezed his leather-clad hips.
"What do you need?" John asked, pulling off Sherlock's cock, making him whimper at the loss and reach blindly down to grope at John, wanting him back.
Sherlock winced, shooing John's hand away from his very over-sensitised shaft. "I wanted to have sex with you." he said simply, glancing around the room and biting the inside of his mouth as his brow crinkled. "I ruined it."
Sherlock devoured the final, soft, sweet chunk of pineapple, his eyes closed, focussing on the sensation of saccharine tang on his tongue. He swallowed, glancing at John with a hint of hesitation as the shorter man cleared away the remnants of their pineapple, wiping down the sticky counter, and gave an assessing glance at the remaining fruit covering the surfaces of the kitchen.
"Mm. Years ago. Not since I was in my twenties." John stretched out beside Sherlock, content to let his arousal simmer for a while, pleased he'd been able to reduce Sherlock to the semi-boneless state he was currently in. As far as that went, he could take care of himself. If Sherlock was too tired...
at it," John cooed, with some fascination. He gave it a few long, tight strokes, his other hand kneading Sherlock's lean thigh.
Sherlock's insides twisted with shame over what he'd said. As soon as he'd got back to the flat, Sherlock had googled what 'snowballing' was, appalled to find out it had nothing- absolutely
John peeled away his underwear and sat quite complacently and nakedly on the edge of the bed, giving Sherlock a dark-blue, gimlet eye. "And you didn't tell me that you had a toy stashed away."
Breathing unsteadily, Sherlock sped his hand up but it didn't help his climax, which remained steadfastly nowhere. He whined very softly in desperation.
Sherlock watched John stand up and extend his hand to him, feeling shell-shocked and dizzy with false confidence. It took him a second to respond, grabbing his doctor’s smaller hand a little too hard and letting himself be pulled up and led away up creaky stairs, through summer-hot gloom.
Ten minutes later, Sherlock was writhing, his lean legs trembling violently as they rested on his doctor's shoulders. He sat on the edge of the sofa, John kneeling on the floor between his jerking legs, holding them apart with considerable effort and teasing him with the tip of his tongue.
Sherlock gripped John's hand as they neared the upmarket restaurant twenty minutes from Baker Street. The precipitation had ceased momentarily, but the sky was still a plump, indecisive bulk of un-shed rain clouds.
His skin turned to gooseflesh at the teasing sensation of his fingertips against his own skin and he sighed, long and pleasured. He traced his fingers back up and over his neck, arching, throwing his head back and closing his eyes.
“Oh…oh,” Sherlock said, nodding even as his pale eyes and rose-stained cheekbones betrayed his surprise. “Should we…shall I do that, then?”
The women's head jerked up and she stared at Sherlock and John- Sherlock flushed a faint pink and John smirked smugly.
His thoughts were unpleasantly halted as his bladder twinged painfully, and he shifted again in his seat.
John gave Sherlock a long, gimlet Look before taking a deep breath. His next words were tinged by an audible, restrained smile. "Remind me why I love you again?"
Lestrade was right on his heels, just as worried, calling for backup as he thundered up the stairs after John.
He was startled by Sherlock suddenly murmuring loudly into his ear. "Did you know Charles Dickens stayed for nearly 6 months at this residence?"
He revised that idea when the belt whistled through the air and cracked- stingy and sharp and painful- against his arse. This wasn't going to be very good.
Something clicked in John’s head and he uttered, “Hang on, isn’t Mrs. Hudson back soon? Did you text her? Tell her the…news?” Their landlady had been away in Dorset, staying with family for ten days.
The antagonist scooped a few fingerfuls of browned, peppery meat into his own mouth, closing his eyes, pausing...then nodding with culinary satisfaction.
Sherlock," he practically growled, reaching down to his aching cock and rubbing it. "What is wrong with you?" he tried to snap, but his own hand on his dick was too good and he was pumping himself before he could fully show his annoyance.
He wondered if John felt this way- the swoop of arousal and the demanding possessiveness of knowing no one else had touched John the way he was about to- when John did things to him. He rather thought not, because the idea made Sherlock want to hide John away from the rest of the world and keep him all to himself...and John didn't seem to struggle with any emotions like that.
the one who didn't tell your co-workers you were in a relationship?" Sherlock fired back, finally finding his voice even if it quavered a bit. "Were you embarrassed? Ashamed of dating a man? Or were you hoping to still get off with them, John? A bit of much-needed action to release some stress...since you obviously can't find that with me?"
He didn’t avoid John’s scar, he never had - the milky keloid splash on the back of his left shoulder, which he knew John was silently grateful for. He
"Sherlock...I thought I said you couldn't watch porn anymore." John grimaced as he heard what sounded like a ferociously-satisfying orgasm echo, tinny but loud, from the laptop's speakers.
Sherlock could see the jealousy and resentment lurking in Shaun's eyes. It was obvious and he wondered if seeing John now, without his cane, perfectly healed, was making him regret ever tossing John to the curb like garbage.
Sherlock made an abrupt loud and broken noise in response, and grappled for John’s nape, then the bedding, messing it up under his clinging and digging fingers, “
John planted his right hand on Sherlock's left shoulder in the golden, artificial light afforded by the streetlamp, quickly meeting the grey-green eyes in the gloom and wordlessly confirming that his weight was comfortable. He leaned upon the detective and knelt up after slathering his left fingers with cool lube. His dark eyes fluttered and his face flushed almost imperceptibly with slight self-consciousness as he penetrated himself.
Sherlock's resulting, barely-audible groan was delicious...and after John had tentatively thrust once inside his lover, making sure he wasn't too sore for this, Sherlock became more vocal. His fingers gripped demandingly, desperately, at the tight flesh of John's shoulders, managing to avoid pressure on the milky keloid remains of the vicious bullet wound.
"From Navan. Thought you knew that? Or am I just 'the Irish guy?' I joined because you and the other guys from Uni joined up. Wanted to be in a new...scary place with mates, I suppose." Shaun replied curtly, wanting to get this over with as quickly as possible. They'd been mates for years, but that had never necessarily precipitated discussing personal details with each other.
"You meant it?" Sherlock repeated, eyes flickering between John's, the doctor's gaze hypnotised by the little hazel imperfection of the detective's right eye.
Sherlock twitched and jerked with each touch, his penis bulging as he wiggled around, oozing further upon his tensed stomach, “I nuh-never ignore you—
be able to fit in a single bed." He said thoughtfully, perched on the edge of said generously-donated bed.
"You're fine now, Sherlock." John whispered, even if he sounded angry and Sherlock could feel the tension radiating from him. "You're fine."
The vague pleasured noise that John responded with resulted in a full-body, powerful pulse that almost sent Sherlock over the edge, burdening him with the tell-tale signs of a tempting orgasm – the helpless jolt of his pale, muscular thighs, the clench of tight stomach muscles, the wonderful, if momentarily-frightening breathlessness of an imminent climax.
"I haven't poked anywhere Molly hasn't given me permission to," Sherlock retorted, ruffling his wet curls once more, unaware he'd said the most suggestive thing yet. "Molly...I need to dry off."
"Yeah, well, not all of us routinely get woken up by it," the DI grinned, calling for some Guinness. "I'm assuming he has one," he shrugged. "Never know, the man's kind of an alien. Do aliens have pricks?"
John took a vaguely-composed breath, grinning widely and devilishly. "You know it’s a year, now. Today. Hope you bought me a present."
"Have you...done that before?" The detective croaked, clearing his throat and sitting up against the plump pillows, glancing down at his still-tremulous muscles with fascination, before dragging the sheet from the lilo to cover his modesty.
Sherlock mashed his lips to John's, kissing him roughly and desperately, backing him up until John's back hit the wall, vaguely aware of the carrier bags dropping soundly to the floor, uncaring when there was a faint clink of glass breaking and a wet sound of something leaking within the plastic bag by John's right foot.
"Go over there?" John pointed to a series of benches near the small lake in the far distance, situated in a thick clump of weeping willows. Sherlock led John to one nested right at the base of one of the trees, which cast a deliciously cool shadow over them. Sitting down with a small sigh of relief, he looked out over the lake, pleased that this little nook of the park was quieter than the sun-drenched core.
Sherlock watched John pull on his boxers and sit back down on the bed, with a sinking feeling in his chest. Something must have shown on his face because John, shoulders sagging, kissed Sherlock's forehead.
and I don't want you on it." He bit off and turned, as if to leave, then spun around again, eyes blazing. "Even
"Aren't you?" He wriggled his eyebrows and Sherlock sighed. It had been weeks...and John still hadn't got off. Sherlock offered each time John made him climax, but John always laughed and waved him away, saying he didn't need it. That he was fine. He was proving a point. Sherlock knew John wanted to come- he still got hard, gave Sherlock dark, lustful looks...but he hadn't broken yet.
"Now just a moment, young man!" Mrs. Hudson protested sternly. "I'll not have you racing in to my flat and making up stories. Are you high?" She asked, peering into Sherlock's eyes.
He groaned as John fucked him, wishing he could get hard again. John pounded into him, bringing down his hand to slap the hyper-sensitive, brutalised flesh of Shaun's left buttock, where the blood-stained welts made his lion tattoo look like it'd had been whipped with razor wire by a cruel circus-master.
"Disregarding all of your puerile sexual connotations, I suspect the main reason is that I love him for exactly what he is, and I'm not going to judge him on his ability to get me off," Sherlock replied. "And now that we're both bored of your tiresome company, we're going home to make love." The detective made to turn away, pulling John with him, when he abruptly stopped, and turned sharply as if something had suddenly occurred to him. "Oh! I forgot. Shaun? ...You're a cunt."
John watched Sherlock's throat bob as he swallowed, cheeks flushing in both arousal and embarrassment as he licked his lips. "You weren't here. I...needed..."
Sherlock whined, tossing his head to the side, rolling his hips against the vibrations, grimacing when the toy didn't slickly slide into his arse, there was too much friction- but he needed more-
Sherlock's hips jumped at the feeling of warm breath against his erection and he strained his neck to look down, upside-down, at John, who gave him a grin.
"I'd...b-brace myself on your chest-" John placed his free hand on Sherlock's chest to demonstrate and felt Sherlock's breathing pick up. "-and fucking ride you into the mattress. It'd feel so good. I'd be...
John took a deep breath, trying to understand how his life had come to this- shopping for sexy things for
No matter, Sherlock decided, eyes flicking from side to side as he worked it out. They could simply use the olive oil again. There was plenty left and it smelled nice and was adequately slippery.
Sherlock nodded, incapable of words, shuddering at the memory of how the man had weighed them, considering. "Said...they were...sweet."
"Good choice." John inspected the transparent flesh jack, turning the pliable rubber over and over in his hands, curiously sticking his finger inside the opening to feel the rubberized bumps and grooves lining it.
Sherlock watched John go, biting his lip, a worrying fear clawing at his chest. He knew John was a man of his word- unswervingly loyal- if he said he was going to break it off with his women then that's exactly what he would do. Sherlock should be able to trust him. What if he didn't, though? What if he strung them along, told them he was just busy, waiting to see how this...whatever it was...worked out with Sherlock? Keeping his options open.
Sherlock gave an aborted moan, his erection, which had faded in the face of too many choices, returning in full. He was very much aware of how good it would feel, what John had said, how much he wanted it. "I...yes. That. That’s more than…That is...if you're amenable...I would like that, John."
"Not until I get my fingers inside you," John told him with playful sternness, making sure Sherlock was in no doubt as to his use of the plural.
"Here we are. Finally," John whispered, smooching into Sherlock's scalp, playfully nibbling at his hair and pulling it with his teeth, still giggling deeply. "I would let you fuck me, you know."
"John." He whispered again, thrilled when John's mouth turned up into a sleepy smile at the sound of Sherlock's voice...but remained steadfastly, annoyingly asleep.
"I'll teach you sometime." John laughed softly, hugging Sherlock again before standing up and offering his hand. "Come on. I'll help you-"
"Sherlock!" He called through to the bedroom, hearing a faint groan in response. "We need a shower, come on, get up."
!" Sherlock suddenly yelped, his grey-green eyes flashing open for a second, before squinching tightly shut again. "...John...I'm s-sorry," he hissed in a ragged voice before his orgasm overpowered him and he jerked irrepressibly, his come squirting hot and inconsistent into his virginal briefs.
"In the movies with all the romantic music and the heated looks and the happily ever afters?" John asked, raising up on his elbow so he could stare down at Sherlock who avoided his gaze, still feeling vulnerable and hating it. John tiled his chin until Sherlock was forced to meet his eyes.
John froze, and his peaceful heartbeat thudded back into fight-or-flight mode. "...How would that help?"
"I...I didn't...don't know what you're talking a-about, Sherlock." Molly stuttered, her face going red and embarrassed tears springing to her eyes. She blinked furiously to clear them, unable to look at John and even Sherlock's face was too much to bear at the moment. "I- I really didn't...I- I mean, I
"Fuck you." Shaun spat and took a menacing step toward John. Sherlock stepped in front of him and Shaun drew up short. "I suggest you leave. And never try and contact John again," Sherlock threatened sternly. Shaun hesitated, clearly torn.
Sherlock’s hand snagged at his elbow the moment he past through the detective’s doorway to get out into the corridor leading to the kitchen, “
Ten minutes later, John sipped tea in his armchair, his wet, ash-brown hair sweetly spiked, absently watching the TV, waiting for Bargain Hunt to start. Sherlock sprawled on the full length of the sofa, staring at his phone with an intense look in his eyes, and occasionally flicking a piercing gaze toward his doctor. His glossy, near-black curls were starting to frizz slightly as they dried, and the sharp, sweet smell of their tea tree shampoo permeated the cosily-cluttered room.
"Are you embarrassed of me?" Sherlock suddenly blurted and John's hands stilled against his skin. "I mean…are you ashamed of being with me? Is that why you didn't tell your co - workers about us? I- I understand if you are." He hurried to say, heart thrumming in fear, when John drew in a breath to answer. "I know I'm not...not the usual standard of beauty you date. I've mentally compiled and compared the level of physical attractiveness of the women you generally date and you average, based on societal standards of beauty, at least an eight. Sometimes a seven. I would rate myself a six on a good day- perhaps slightly more when I wear those royal blue pants you so favour. So I understand if I'm not… Well. All that fantastic. And I know I'm impossible to get along with. And I have strange proclivities which you're very good about dealing with... I...I understand it, John, I just…wanted to ask." Sherlock mumbled, voice strained, trying not to sound as hurt and vulnerable as he'd felt earlier when he'd realized that John had kept their relationship hidden.
"Sherlock, can I lay with you? This lilo's really fucking me over and to be honest, it'd be nice to hold you."
don't," John beseeched, surprising the detective by taking his shoulders for support, and then clambering into his lap, facing him with a cheeky grin.
"Molly, how much are you being paid to advertise bleach products?" Sherlock asked, trying his hand at a joke- Molly usually appreciated his humour and he turned, expecting to find her behind him, surprised when she wasn't. Then he heard the heavy footsteps, two people, coming up the stairs at a very slow pace. Ah, good. She was helping John with the luggage.
The late-June afternoon was sticky, and warm, and grey, like used chewing gum, the redolent heat had sucked the colour out of the muggy sky like so much fleeting sweetness. A watery sun winked occasionally, optimistically, through thick milky clouds.
She squirmed on the bed in silent frustration, her orgasm, which had been looming and promising, now abated, leaving her throbbing in denial. Molly sighed, taking her hands away from between her legs and fisting them in the sheet beneath her.
He dipped beneath the covers, tracing his way down to where John's penis lay, flaccid and nestled atop his testicles. Still asleep. He cocked his head, smiling at it...before tonguing the head.
"...If you knew...why didn't you do anything?" Sherlock asked rather pathetically, his striking features contorted in a beautifully baffled expression.
With a deep and positively loud exclamation, Sherlock shifted his legs, lifted his hips some more, and raucously began moaning and grunting with each thrust, “Mm…
"We're not going to miss it, Sherlock...Jesus, it's way too early." John muttered, scrubbing his short hair and sitting up reluctantly, Sherlock's obvious enthusiasm propelling him into action.
A sudden, spontaneous and irresistible idea swamped John’s dizzy consciousness as his body taunted him with the fact of his animalistic need to come.
Did John really need clarification? Was he that thick? "Yes. It was true!" Sherlock snapped, sitting up, angry- totally unprepared for John to lean forward and kiss him.
“It wasn’t a game, you know. It was obvious you’d find out eventually. I wasn’t exactly keeping it from you,” Sherlock said, patting and then stroking at John’s sternum through his t-shirt. “Very doubtful I’ll get bored of sleeping next to you. It’s quite pleasant. Hence the reason I’ve continued to do it.”
“I’m already marrying you, you daft twat,” John replied fondly, mussing his detective’s wet and wilted curls.
A pleasurable, cooling breeze was starting to pick up and invited itself through the open living room window, stirring the previously languid heat. Keith was quietly nibbling on some leftover chicken on the kitchen counter, his luscious tail wafting happily with every few mouthfuls.
"My bottoms stay on." He said, voice hard and brooking no argument. He expected John to sigh, to say he was stupid and if that was the case then he didn't want to watch- he would be able to see anything that way…but John nodded, leaning forward in his chair, eagerly looking at Sherlock, anticipating a show.
Giving a broken, pleasure-filled wail, Sherlock reached back with flailing arms to dig shaking fingers into John’s waist, “Th-that’s
," Sherlock groaned, collapsing back onto the sofa, gasping wheezily, his bright, grey-green eyes staring at something beyond the ceiling. John grinned, getting up on sore legs and pecking him on the cheek.
John swallowed with barely-restrained arousal, his eyes flickering tellingly as he glanced over his partner's shivering body, which was a glorious study in absolute want. "Christ, Sherlock...you...need something inside you?" He asked, even though Sherlock had pretty much already made this fact clear.
It had been frustrating, considering having John in his bed was brilliant, and yet the man refused to enter his body. Or, to be entered.
It hurt, John's plea, but Sherlock hardened his heart. He knew he was doing the right thing. "John...maybe later. We could…or rather I could. ..for you. .." He trailed off awkwardly.
John could see the pulse at the side of Sherlock's neck leaping, his eyes dark and dilated. Fuck. "Yeah. Sure." He smiled. "Of course you can."
"We need to be closer." John tugged Sherlock against him, wedging his cock between them. "To ensure maximum heat transfer."
"John...." Sherlock's own hips hitched forward without his permission and he glanced down, surprised to find his own cock drooling pre-come onto the sheets beneath him. Suddenly, seeing his own cock, how hard and aching it was, made him aware of just how turned on he truly was. How his pulse had centered between his legs. Testicles drawn up tight. Cock bobbing.
He cleared his throat and had the decency to blush when Sherlock threw him a questioning look, as they approached a series of glass tanks, where all kinds of invertebrates were dwelling lethargically.
His doctor was always apt to provide him with fascinating snippets of his personality, exposed as little threads in his words and actions, that Sherlock was secretly and painstakingly collating as a rough tapestry in a spare room of his Mind Palace. It was a work in progress, and it might indeed, never be completed. He had never been particularly good at needlework, so it was fairly unkempt and rustic-looking. It had a few glaringly-bare sections, though they were bolstered and added-to fairly regularly, increment by tiny increment.
“Alarm system. Sneaking into tight spots. Carrying secret cameras in its collar. Ingratiating yourself at the vets if the vet turns out to be a serial killer.”
Sherlock was beginning to feel the distracting and unhelpful burn of honest panic under his skin, and he struggled to keep his breathing measured, as he jerked as far away from his antagonist as possible. The man in question was remarkable in that his appearance was utterly
John grinned, despite himself. "Promise you'll do it without sulking, sub-plotting, or thinking of any kind?"
"Are you outta your fucking mind?!" Shaun shouted thickly, blood pouring over his face, glaring at Sherlock. "I'll fucking kill you-"
“…Ah. Yes. Sorry,” Sherlock babbled, blushing hot under John’s gaze, picking and twisting the duvet between his fingers.
John jolted, breath leaving his body in a rush. He squirmed on the bed. "Yeah. That's...that's great, Sherlock." He hesitated, then. "You could...harder. If you wanted."
"Show me what you got from your dickhead friend." John said, nodding pointedly at the heavy paper bag that had been deposited by the dressing table.
"Are you all right, Mr. Holmes?" He'd asked, eyes trailing down Sherlock's body and Sherlock nodded, flushing. "Well, it's a very lucky bloke you've purchased all these lovely things for." Chaucer winked and Sherlock had been glad John was outside and hadn't seen. "Your bit of rough has probably never handled silk before. Make sure he knows it needs to be treated…gently."
A cab ride later, John helped Sherlock up the stairs to their flat. His assistance was unnecessary, Sherlock was fine if a bit shaken up, but John kept his arm around him, steering him into their flat and easing his jacket off Sherlock's shoulders.
"Look, John, Sherlock is a lot of things. Believe me I know that. He's got a hell of an addictive personality but, I dunno mate. He's kept you around a fair while. This might not be something he'll get bored of."
"Come on, Sherlock." John breathed, tracing idle patterns on Sherlock's hips, skirting close to his jutting erection but not moving to help. "Come on, love, I know you can do it."
Pausing long enough for Sherlock to note that he was considering lying, John nodded after deciding the truth would be best, "It...crossed my mind."
Sherlock frowned, wondering if this were a trap. John had been reluctant earlier to discuss his sexual past with Shaun (even in his head Sherlock winced in disgust at the name) and now...now he wanted to talk about it?
Feeling unbelievably flustered, but trying not to show it, she turned from the kitchen counter to look up and lock her chocolate-brown eyes with Sherlock's icy grey-green ones. She tried, really, to flick her gaze towards to the living room and see if John was listening, but quite frankly, she felt supernaturally rooted to the spot, and her focus was reluctant to shift. Only her mouth seemed functional, and she stuttered awkwardly, running a hand through her straightened hair in an irrational act of comfort, and attempted a display of confidence. "What…what were you thinking?"
The taller man was trying to re-adjust his damp, rebellious curls inconspicuously, when he felt warm, wet, reluctantly-welcome arms wrap around his narrow waist. He let out a very weak noise of disgruntlement. He was about to place his hands protectively, and thankfully, over his doctors', when John pulled back with a sharp exclamation.
"Maybe we should go." John murmured quietly, not wanting to draw attention to them. Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he stared at the gang of young men now only a few yards from them. A swastika tattoo decorated the side of one's neck, while various other ones sported symbols affiliating them with a well-known gang which had been the perpetrators of a string of burglaries, murders, and drug trafficking. Sherlock had seen the file at Lestrade's behest. Not that these men were the ones who'd done such things. But they
John smirked, casually wiped a few beads of sweat from his forehead and damp, sand-coloured hair, and left the room, to the pronounced, insistent groans of his detective. He made his way to the living room and picked up his discarded, abused phone, quietly amused, once again, at the number of missed calls.
, he thought in a dizzying panic, the words blooming and gyrating frantically in a psychedelic dance in his Mind Palace.
John's hand, which had been affectionately kneading Sherlock's bare bicep, stilled. "...You...you can't know that. Why do you think that's a fact?"
"Thanks for the heads-up. Do you really sleep in my bed with me sometimes? Without my knowledge?" John asked casually over his shoulder, affecting indifference.
"Oh my god..." John giggled, body shaking as he tried to keep his laughter inside. "You're not serious. Please...just...Oh god." Sherlock chuckled against him, his laughter a dark rumble in the blackness, and they shakily righted themselves as best they could, sticky and damp.
John gritted his teeth as unhelpful memories of wild, rampant encounters with his ex-boyfriend swamped his treacherous mind. What Sherlock was doing to him- now teasingly running his hand along John's cock- was nothing compared to what his ex had done, what John had delighted in with him...and that was fine, John sternly told himself, ridding himself of the memories and focusing on Sherlock, whose head was cocked to the side, studying John, giving him the creepy idea that Sherlock could read minds.
?! Do you have any fucking idea why I'm late, you selfish prick?" John asked, his anger returning in a sudden, hot swoop even as arousal spiked through his body at the picture Sherlock made on the sofa, debauched and gorgeous.
Knowing Sherlock was close, that his shaky, out-of-rhythm thrusts were drawing to a close, beckoned John's own orgasm that much closer. He whined, thrusting into Sherlock's fist as rapidly as he could.
He had been stripped down to his underwear for a reason that he didn't want to even speculate. He swallowed another quick mouthful of blood from a dislodged molar, trying to ignore the worrying wobble of the tooth in question. He held his breath and braced himself to attempt to disguise the shiver that was tremoring through him from the chill of the ill-lit basement.
at moving things beyond the too-quick pecks he sometimes gave Sherlock, innocently pressing their lips together before quickly pulling away. Sherlock's virginity obviously made John want to take things slow and Sherlock, for one, was tired of it.
John curled his hands into fists on his lap, trying valiantly to keep them to himself, and eyed Sherlock's newly cut hair for the umpteenth time in the past hour. It was shorter than he'd seen it in a long time, the curls barely an inch long and slicked into a fashionable style. John wanted to mess that style up. He wanted to run his fingers through the gelled curls and ruffle them,
Sherlock nodded, clearly hoping John would open his mouth- which was mere inches away from his cock- and take him inside, perhaps swirl his tongue over the head before sucking his cock....
"Need your help. Right now. Where have you been," Sherlock panted through the door crack, and John frowned at the fresh, hot sweat running down through the detective's tousled fringe and over his reddened forehead.
That was a lie, though. Sherlock could see it. John's eyes went all pinched at the corners as he said it and his mouth narrowed down. He didn't want to "see where things went"...he wanted...a relationship...with Sherlock. "You..." Sherlock squinted and dodged his head a little as he ascertained the expression in John's eyes and translated it.
"It needs to be placed back in a safe tank as soon as possible, it's pretty weak. Poor thing." John quirked an eyebrow at this, but Sherlock didn't appear to be joking; his striking face was straight, his features calm, if a little distant. "We need to give Lestrade some bad news. Come on." He turned and held the heavy, chipped back door open for his partner.
Narrowing his eyes in playful disdain at being ordered around, John took his sweet time in fetching the lube from the bedside table, regardless of his own impatient arousal. Plucking the slightly-sticky bottle from its gooey harbour beside the lamp, he rotated his hips thoughtfully as he slowly popped open the lid, swirling the slick liquid in the transparent bottle raptly.
"Surprised by that." John's finger pressed more insistently against him. "Would've thought you'd want to know everything. And since you've been trying to suppress your gag reflex...only serves to reason…"
Sherlock felt as if he were walking in a daze. Everything around him was fuzzy and indistinct, his eyes unable to focus on any one thing. His prick pulsed inside his trousers, half hard and leaking, buzzing in arousal, still waiting to be brought off.
"Maybe it's a plebeian thing. When I say you're 'alright', it means that you're cool. That I like you," John laughed sweetly. "Being posh, you probably wouldn't get it. Give us a kiss, darlin’," John pronounced extravagantly, in his best East End accent.
John had kept stealing glances at Sherlock earlier as he paced around their bedroom getting ready for work, shooting furtive, sneaky looks at Sherlock's exposed body and his unashamedly hard prick. John's want for Sherlock had been palpable, in the way John's eyes had darkened at the sight, his tongue coming out to moisten his lips again and again, and his inability to tear his eyes away from his boyfriend. It had been almost enough to soothe Sherlock's hurt feelings. Almost. Not quite though.
Sherlock swallowed heavily, sudden arousal swamping his body and making his pupils dilate as he thought of it. Intercrural sex. His eyes darted over to John who was leaning back in his chair, unaware of Sherlock's activities, staring at the other diners as he waited for Sherlock to be finished.
John chuckled, much more open with his amusement. Then, to Sherlock’s bafflement, he pressed his lips to the soft wound in a brief kiss.
? Sherlock couldn't believe his luck, some part of his distracted brain asking whether John actually meant what he was saying, or was just expressing the most efficient phrases in order to dump someone quickly and with minimal fuss.
John's voice drifted through the thin wall and Molly's heart leapt in her throat. John thought Sherlock had been flirting with
His body practically melted under the man, his body going slack as Sherlock lowered him to the floor, shifting his own naked body to straddle him whilst sucking hard at his lower lip.
Sherlock felt John chuckle into the kiss, his lips curving up even as he kissed him. Sherlock, feeling shaky, strained up, wanting more. Impulsively, he stuck his tongue out, without grace or finesse, against John's closed lips and John made a surprised noise, pulling away. Sherlock's hands slipped from around his neck.
"That I'm a fucking queer!" John hissed at him, quaking with fury as he shoved Sherlock back down flat on the bed with a lot more force and bitterness than he'd intended.
Sherlock growled. He thought about leaving the room. That would show John. If he just got up and left. But no. He couldn't leave. Not when John had so obviously found his own prostate, eyes widening as he moaned, hand working faster under the sheets.
And so Sherlock didn't waste any time, straining his hips up, tilting them so each drag of John's cock in and out slid along his prostate, making arousal fizz in his abdomen. He gasped helplessly, rutting back against John, concentrating on the feeling, trying to ignore the little voice in the back of his mind that was telling him he'd never be able to come without at least a few strokes to his cock. He was at a boiling point, the very pinnacle before he tipped over into orgasm…but couldn't…seem…to…go over. Sherlock whined, writhed, and tried to get his hands free, desperate to come. He just needed a stroke. A finger. The barest of pressure and he would come.
Sherlock let out a soft breath of relief when John turned the water off and stepped out, getting their fluffiest towel to dry Sherlock with.
Sherlock gave both John and Mrs. Hudson an injured look before stomping downstairs. John hoped he'd gone to get some towels.
Sherlock shivered at the pleasured, agonized moan John let forth as he did, and he eagerly took over fucking his fingers into his doctor, keenly watching for any reaction of pain in John's body. All he saw, though, as John urgently, breathlessly instructed him to insert another finger, was pure arousal. John's nipples were pebbled, hard, his skin covered in goose bumps, muscles jumping and shivering under skin which was starting to take on a slight sheen of sweat. And his cock, bobbing between them with the urgent movements of Sherlock's fingers as they drove into John's body, was rock hard, fluid beginning to pool at the tip.
and across his perineum, sparking pleasure along his nerve endings and making his vision go slightly fuzzy at the edges.
of arranging John in the position he wanted him in and in the end, it was John who did most of the work. Grinning wolfishly, he arranged himself, naked, on all fours in front of Sherlock on the bed, handing him the bottle of lube with raised eyebrows.
"John..." Sherlock reached out to help him, not understanding why John- his usually patient and understanding John- was acting this way...because Sherlock hadn't wanted sex?
"Sherlock," she said gently. "It's not that easy to admit you love someone, not when it means so much."
The next morning, Sherlock groaned as the insistent, full-volume tune of his mobile's ringtone startled him from a delightfully-comatose, uneventful dream. He rolled to the side, fumbling for it, and knocked the mobile off the cheap bedside table. Cursing, he flopped after it, kicking John in the thigh as he flailed.
," he shrugged, standing up and pulling on his coat. "It was lovely to meet both of you. Really. Perhaps let's leave this sort of thing to special occasions from now on...you are bearable, more bearable than most, I should say, but I suspect none of us would really relish having to spend more time than we have to in each other's company. For the record, I love your son very much and you needn't worry, I will protect him with my life and will always put his life before mine."
glazed when John jerked the door open, towel wrapped around his waist. He gave Sherlock an amused look as his eyes darted from his flushed face to the rose.
John chuckled and bent, tilting Sherlock's head up with a finger. "Definitely doesn't count." He murmured before pressing his lips to that ridiculous, rambling, cupid's bow-shaped mouth. Sherlock, one hand still clutching his rose, arched up into the kiss, his other hand grasping the front of John's shirt and tugging. His intentions were clear and John hesitated- briefly debated- then pulled away. "Sherlock-"
"I've managed to repress my gag reflex so it's only 12.2% efficient." Sherlock murmured seductively, before suckling with genuine pleasure on the base of John's shaft.
Sherlock knew. "...It's amazing. Thanks," he said honestly, placing it reverently to one side and stood up, going to hug Sherlock, and then awkwardly losing steam, patting his upper arms instead.
"Not a porn phrase." Sherlock staunchly defended himself, face flushing at being almost discovered. "I want you to...to thrust into my arse hard. Very hard. Like- like that, John." He moaned a bit theatrically as John, huffing, sped up.
Slowly, mindful of making too much noise, Sherlock began a deliberate, firm rhythm at his cock, pumping his hand over the swollen shaft with brisk, business-like strokes designed to get him off in a hurry. He hadn't done this in ages- hadn't felt the need- but since his and John's first kiss, Sherlock's libido, usually quiescent and dormant, had taken a sudden upswing. It'd clambered for his attention on a daily basis, whereas before he'd barely felt the occasional twitch.
His eyes still closed, but with the bright dawn piercing them irritatingly, John groaned and kicked down the bedsheets which felt sweltering. He sighed happily at the cooler air over his body. Satisfied, he nuzzled against the warm flesh beside him, only vaguely recognising that it was a hip he was nosing sleepily, and not a sharp-featured face.
Sherlock's hand faltered in its rhythm and John moaned, jerking his hips up, chasing after his orgasm.
"You don't have to ask me for a kiss, Sherlock," He said gently, bending down and pressing his lips against Sherlock's.
Either way, for the first time since he could remember, it was the slightest bit...annoying. John's blissful mood was irritating while Sherlock was distinctly not happy and there was a persistent, niggling heaviness in his groin from unsatisfied lust. Not to mention his arse was throbbing from earlier and - Sherlock suddenly realized - John hadn't even checked to see if he and his arse were okay. He suddenly felt vindicated in his bad mood.
"You weren't able to engage in the kinky types of sexual activity he wanted-" Sherlock blinked, derailed in his deductions, and swivelled his head to stare at John. "You weren't damaged. He...He shouldn't have...I'm glad he left you."
There was a tangible pause in the pitch-darkness, before John heard a query strained by awkward, sweet consideration.
Sherlock huffed irritably as he followed John and Greg towards the pub a few blocks from Baker Street. The two men ahead of him were chatting animatedly and laughing, seemingly unaware of the consulting detective following in their wake.
Sherlock snorted, derisive. "Who'd want to steal me away? You're the only one who ever wanted to put up with me."
He closed his eyes, sucking on Sherlock's cock, willing him to come before the genius inadvertently drew blood. Pre-come flooded his mouth and Sherlock's thighs began shaking in a tell-tale presage of his orgasm.
"John...maybe this isn't a good idea" Sherlock said with a sickly expression. "If we just...you know...turn the lights off," he mumbled awkwardly. His erection, which had been very pronounced in his thin bottoms, had noticeably flagged and he couldn't look at John, didn't want to meet his eyes, afraid of what he'd see there if he did. This hadn't been a good idea. He should've listened to John when he said they should take things slow.
"...Um, Sherl?" He said, as the beep welcomed him to speak. "If you're okay, can you let me know? It's just...you know...um..." he trailed off feebly as the phone cut him off.
At Sherlock's abrupt and shocking bodily clench and a frankly-frightening huff of air that told of troubled lungs, John started to panic. That was until, curled against him, Sherlock ejaculated copiously, eyes startled, pale and wide, and his delicious throat bobbing with each forcible, strangled yell of utter pleasure.
"Oh...god...yes...yes,” Sherlock whispered, almost too overcome to expend any extra decibels on actually vocalising his pleasure. He realized he was shaking all over, slumped over John and still holding him in what had to be a horribly uncomfortable position now he'd come. He quickly lowered John's legs and almost collapsed atop him before remembering, the split second before he did so, that John was injured. He caught himself in the nick of time, surprised at how foggy his brain was, and rolled to the side, shuddering at the sensitivity of his cock as it slipped from John's body.
"If you get hard and want me to do more I will." John's fingers stroked carefully along Sherlock's flaccid cock, gentle and sure.
“Come all over those pretty lips of yours. Your cheekbones.” He caressed the parts of Sherlock’s face in question while Sherlock shakily undid John’s jeans and tugged them down to let his cock spring free. Sherlock looked positively giddy at the opportunity of pleasuring John now that he had confidence in himself.
"John, please undress me." He asked bravely, breathing heavily, long fingers clenching into frantic fists at the request.
He sighed, breathing in the smell of John and the lingering scent of semen. He wasn't tired, didn't feel sleepy in the least, but it was worth wasting time lying in bed with John, just being near him.
His fingers flailed for something to grab on to. The wall of the concrete building whose corner they were hidden behind was too far away to reach and Shaun's black hair was too short to get any leverage in.
Sherlock scowled childishly and opened his mouth to complain further, when John leaned close to his ear and murmured in a deep, sultry tone that he had frustratingly little experience with. "I promise I'll make it worth your time if you go."
John shuddered. "Yeah. I'm fine. Just..." He shuddered again, unable to stop it. "Sensitive. Fine, though."
Despite the memory of where he was and why rapidly returning, it still took John a few bleary moments to make the connections and settle himself into the heated embrace which was making him swelter. He acknowledged his morning erection and the awkward but wonderful position of Sherlock's lax hand resting over his hip, dangerously near his eager crotch.
Regardless, he needed to get drunk and talk to someone other than Sherlock about the issue between them that the detective seemed to have blown out of all proportion.
…I don’t know how long I can…” he tried to gesture with his clinging hands yet only managed to ripple the covers under him.
John huffed, hips smacking against Sherlock even harder, chasing his own orgasm with selfish abandon, despite the fact Sherlock was writhing below him from sensitivity, cock twitching a few more spools of come.
"JOHN!" Sherlock yelled loudly over his shoulder, attracting more than a few surprised stares from fellow shoppers as he aggressively commandeered a trolley. "Keep up, no time to lose! Where's the vegetable...bit?" He waved his hand in a vaguely questioning gesture, his keen eyes darting around intently, trying to deduce it.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "This?" He asked, ghosting his hand along the ridge of John's cock, watching it flex beneath the luxurious fabric. John's eyes went half-lidded and his breath sighed out shakily. Sherlock's hands continued on, stroking the inside of John's thighs, tickling at the backs of his knees.
"I- I...behaved badly during lunch with your parents." Sherlock stuttered, trying to make his brain work so he could apologize effectively. "Unforgivably so. Horribly. I shouldn't have said what I did. I'm s-sorry." Sherlock flinched hard when John enveloped the head of Sherlock's aching cock in his mouth and swirled his tongue around the head, making fresh pleasure burst inside Sherlock's body. "
"John insisted on delaying us," Sherlock said bluntly, and there was no hint of humour in his cold green eyes. "I'm guessing that with the new-found complacency of the perpetrator, you have some half-decent physical evidence this time? Don't place too much value on it, there’s a good chance it will have been planted and will have an obscure provenance to throw you off track. You're better off looking at past crimes with similar MOs. And this man will have a juvenile record of anti-social behaviour against non-specific individuals. Possibly even minor arson."
Sherlock's face was suddenly in his vision and John blinked at him, crying out when Sherlock pressed hard on his wound.
"Yeah, thought you'd thrown a strop and changed your mind," Greg replied. "Sit down, join the 'masculine talk,' we've already started," he grinned.
Sherlock's face was flushed a dull red and he refused to meet John's eyes. "I...no. That's not what I want. Not anymore. You carry on as much as you want, John. I'll watch you reach orgasm if you want."
Mrs. Hudson stood with a small tender smirk, smoothing down her deep-purple dress and bouffing her hair as she prepared to give her recalcitrant tenant a few parting words. Mr. Chatterjee’s  brother was looking after the sarnie shop today.
Someone had hurt Sherlock. Had touched him and violated and damaged him. John was glad he'd killed the bastard. He only wished he could do it again, more slowly this time. Make them suffer like his beautiful love had.
Sherlock breathed a huge sigh of relief. Swallowing heavily, his chest heaving and limbs trembling, Sherlock wiped his hands ineffectually on pyjama bottoms that covered shaky thighs. He inhaled a few more much needed breaths, his body reluctantly coming down from its orgasmic high, wincing at the feeling of lukewarm semen gluing itself unpleasantly to his crotch and upper thighs. Sherlock stood with a stifled groan, his muscles protesting the movement, his legs having fallen asleep as he knelt beside John's bed.
The attack against his prostate provoked renewed interest from Sherlock's cock, which had never gone completely soft. As John thrust ruthlessly against his prostate again and again, Sherlock's cock started- to his dismay- to harden again. John was delighted, eyeing Sherlock's inadvertent, but wonderfully tempting post-orgasmic state. He nudged the toy a little deeper into his loose and languid detective.
The young woman gave out a squeak, jumping as her hand stilled its movement to the pesky bit of metal digging in to her left breast to see a figure looming in the doorway. He had his arms crossed behind his back and an intensely quizzical look in his piercing eyes.
"I can't stand you dwelling on me and Shaun. I can practically taste your jealousy, and it's fucking bitter. If you've got questions you want to ask…just get them all out of the way now so we can get over this."
"Yup. Because you're like me. You're a good guy, most of the time. When you're not, you don't mind breaking a few rules. You're not ruled by your dick but you sure as hell know what to do with it."
"Think John's got another way to indulge his homo-erotic urges these days." He said childishly, nudging John and grinning widely.
"Mm...yeah." John agreed lazily, sighing contentedly. He could still disconcertingly feel his heartbeat in his cock but his body gradually relaxed the longer he laid against Sherlock.
John grinned to himself and stretched, before thumbing through his apps, wanting to entertain himself with something cheery before he went back to sleep, to try and prevent him falling back into the same nightmare. It worked sometimes. It depended on how bad things had been, how distracting the apps could be.
"Because I'm not as dense as you think. And you're not as good as cloaking your emotions as you would like to believe. I'll tell you what you want to know. Because I know you want to know it. So let's just get it over and done with."
Sherlock watched John's eyes narrow, sparking as he became just as angry as Sherlock was. Not just as angry, Sherlock thought, there was no way John could feel the level of anger, hurt, and betrayal he was currently experiencing at finding out John preferred his own paltry hand to him.
"Anything in particular?" Sherlock asked, swivelling around and fixing John with his penetrating gaze. John decided, not for the first time in any of his communications with Sherlock, to be utterly and totally frank.
John coughed out a surprised, keening noise, frowning in the dark at the effort of the pleasure. “Dy – do you want to get undressed?” he asked throatily, running clawed fingers down Sherlock’s long, bare back, to bump against the waistband of his silken pyjama bottoms.
John's face turned a ruddy red and Lestrade looked torn over whether or not he should laugh or be embarrassed. He settled for chuckling awkwardly and rubbing at the back of his neck, which had turned a stunning shade of red.
John suddenly shouted, hunching forward, semen erupting from the tip of his cock in strong, powerful spurts. Splashes of musky, hot liquid decorated Sherlock’s pale face in a barely-noticeable white patina. His enviously-clear skin glistening with John's release, Sherlock abruptly grinned with glee as he licked off the lukewarm seed from his front teeth, and knuckled a fist fondly into one of his damp eye sockets. He darted his tongue out to catch a few extra renegade drops as it slid down his face.
Shaun shook his head. "No one...ever wanted...oh, fuck Watson. Fuck me." He dropped onto his elbows, changing the angle, and suddenly it was easier for John's hand to slide further inside. Shaun keened.
"Yes, of course it did." Sherlock replied, confused, letting John pet at him and sat on the bed, gently pulling John into his arms. "Breathe. Just...breathe, John. You're fine now." He murmured and John took a great, gasping breath of air, breathing in the familiar smells of wool and musk and cigarettes. He was so overwhelmed he didn't even have the energy to take Sherlock to task for smoking, he just clung tighter.
John had always preferred altitude. Even as a kid, he had unfailingly picked the top bunk bed if the situation arose, and sometimes ended up in childish fisticuffs if said bunk was in dispute. He just felt intrinsically safer when he was higher up. It had taken him a good few months to stop distractedly fretting about his office at the surgery. His
. John felt a twinge of unease as he curiously inspected the vibrator. He knew he was perfectly average in length and width and Sherlock had always seemed to love his cock but he was uncomfortably aware that he fell a bit…
An impish expression rippled across Sherlock’s face, so he hid it into John’s shoulder for a few seconds, and darted his gaze around the room in nervous anticipation, “And
“It’s fun to watch you suffer,” John replied, flashing his bright grin, before licking his thin lips tantalisingly.
He pushed his arse out, wanting- craving- more and John gave it to him. Another bruising smack on his bottom sent Shaun careening into orgasm, convulsing and crying out helplessly while John dropped the belt and rubbed at his welts. The pain made his orgasm that much more intense and he could have sworn later that he saw actual stars dancing in front of his eyes.
"Do you really want it to be over quickly?" The taller man asked in a voice as deep and dark and inflammatory as a lungful of coal. "I can make it last as long as you need. Or...as long as I want."
"John?" He whispered, tickling a few cool fingers across the doctor's cheekbone, playfully booping the tip of his nose. "I love you."
. Come here." He said brusquely, grabbing John's hand and towing him quickly away from the throng of people. John stumbled, spilling his fancy drink. "Sherlock! What-?"
"I'm-" John swallowed thickly and tried to form words again, his warm, damp mouth smearing Sherlock's cheekbone as he whispered harshly. "I'm going to make this the last thing I say for now - do you want to see this through? I can stop if you want. I promise."
Before he could really think about it, the doctor made some kind of sound, bracing himself on the floor and effortlessly flipping them. Sherlock landed on his back with an undignified huff and John pulled his hips back enough so that he wouldn't be tempted to slam himself into Sherlock's body.
"Describe in every detail you can manage, how you want me to lick…or suck…or touch you. And I warn you, John, I won't be patient when it comes to your stuttered adjectives." Sherlock grinned with predatory amusement while John wondered where in the hell his shy virgin lover had gone, the one who had trouble articulating the simplest of things, and when this mischievous man had taken his place.
"Thanks for the warning, love," John sheepishly remarked, inconspicuously wiping his knuckles across his lips.
"...I...I'm...g-gonna..." Sherlock panted gracelessly, the exertion burning in his muscles, and his imminent climax a wildfire in his blood.
"In...in the wardrobe." He managed to get out, his voice grating and low in sudden arousal. John grinned and eased off the bed, going to the expensive wardrobe and carefully sifting aside designer shirts, shoes, and various disguises as he looked for the illicit stock of sex toys which were housed somewhere within. His hand finally bumped into a crumpled and well-worn carrier-bag and his grin widened.
. Just put them on and come here and kiss me." John yanked down his own boxers and kicked away the duvet, pushing his laptop to the floor with a dull 'clunk.'
What sort of statement was that? Sherlock wondered if he could somehow live in the little loo for the next few days because at the moment he couldn't go back and face John. Not after…all that.
"...Just this once, then," Sherlock muttered, before unhooking his right arm, lowering his hand with almost un-erring accuracy to John's cock, and pumping it hard.
Sherlock managed, with a reckless and desperate effort, to insert the toy fully in one go, with a strangled groan. He writhed for a few seconds, adjusting to the sensation of having something in his body, of being so very
"Takes care of another one of my problems- I get to stake a public claim on you. In actual fact, I'm always rather terrified of someone stealing you away from me."
Sherlock, staring with almost comic engrossment, eased the pressure but didn’t stop rubbing. Letting go of John’s sticky, trembling hand, he placed his own tacky palm across John’s testicles and pushed down gently, easing his hand in quick, firm circles. His expression brightened in fascination as a few more watery spurts of semen spattered from John’s tortured shaft, the doctor twisting violently on the sweat-wet bedcovers and sobbing out hoarse, broken noises.
," he warned, his body sliding down his armchair and practically onto the floor as his body heaved. He moaned, kneeling awkwardly on the living room floor, fisting himself with brutal, blurry speed, struggling to reach his peak.
"Sherlock..." John struggled but Sherlock's grip was firm. "God. Please-" He started gingerly raising himself a few inches before dropping back down onto Sherlock's cock with a relieved groan. He repeated the move, muscles already protesting the strain but the arousal burning through his body demanded satisfaction.
Sherlock was gloriously naked, and now he perched on the edge of the rumpled bed, his sleepy features brightening with inquisitiveness and attraction.
"You're a menace. And nose massages still count, you berk," John answered, allowing himself a small chuckle. "I don't know. I guess I'd feel pissed that you only wanted to spend time with me when I'm unconscious."
“Well then. Away you go,” John instructed, flicking his hand with an impatient gesture. He made a show of settling more comfortably into his chair, crossed his arms, and raised his eyebrow expectantly.
"All right. I'll do it." He said, putting down the soaked flannels on the night table. "Roll that way. No-
"G-go as slow as you want. Just. Start. Please." He spread his legs even further, offering himself to John. John hesitated but slid his fingers from Sherlock's arse, using them to spread lube on his cock.
Once they were both prone on the bed, said amorphous detective immediately wrapped every extremity around his doctor, resulting in a faintly-disgruntled noise from the smaller man.
"Let her check you over." John murmured, giving the nurse an apologetic glance while he openly ogled. "I won't go far."
Sherlock, surprised, found that he wasn't hard anymore. He wasn't even faintly aroused, the idea of John rolling him over and stroking him off or even using his mouth to make him come holding...surprisingly little appeal at the moment. As John recovered, Sherlock supposed he'd let John do whatever he wanted. It didn't matter...
Sherlock jerked so hard against his restraints he knew he would have bruises later. At the moment, he couldn't be bothered to care.
He glanced at the time on the laptop. He had approximately half an hour before John came back from his irritatingly routine morning food shop.
Sherlock pulled John into a quick kiss, not relishing the idea of more networking with his boorish friends, but ready to do so...for John. He was certain that the mingled sweat and lovebites he was wearing would be more than sufficient as chainmail.
The detective took a few moments to soak up the delightful wet heat, his striking eyes closed, and took a deep inhale of the faintly citrusy humid air of the bathroom, before he opened his mouth to expound his complaints. He was, however, interrupted, as a distinctly choked groan reached his ears, and he stared at the mosaic of hot water-droplets and shuddering, familiar skin that made up the glass door of their shower.
," he observed in wonderment, taking the moment to slip his two fingers fully inside Sherlock, loosening the tension in his wrist in case the other man bucked.
, are you all right?" John asked again, stressing his name overzealously. "You didn't seem like you enjoyed the joke."
He huffed out quick, shallow breaths, keeping his eyes closed and steadily thinking of sex, fucking into a tight, willing body, feeling muscles contract with pleasure around him, grunts of pleasure falling from his partner's lips- a partner who suddenly morphed into a man with curly hair, pale skin, and eyes blown wide in innocent, stunned pleasure.
John didn't need to bend over like that in order to get something on the bottom shelf at Tesco. And he didn't need to
Sherlock reacted nearly instantaneously and let out a silent gasp against John’s lips with an almost violent shudder of pleasure, which arced his spine and made his hips tremble on an uncontrollable rut forward. He went taut afterward, his entire frame warming with an impressive flush of heat, and he moved his abruptly-unsteady hand from John’s face to his shoulder with a clumsy grapple.
Sherlock huffed as John playfully licked at his chin, tossing his head to avoid any more contact. "Busy." He murmured, scrolling to the appropriate entries. Sherlock winced in fond annoyance as John, not deterred, nibbled at his throat instead, before tugging his hand away from the keyboard of the laptop and licking his pineapple juice covered fingertips.
"Hush." John panted, licking at his neck and groaning. "You can come...but you have to come from this...just this...me fucking you...think you can?" He asked, amusement in his voice at Sherlock's agonized, disbelieving moan. "Come on, Sherlock...you've done it before-"
Fifteen minutes later, the detective was showered and dressed and in the living room, fiddling with the dark curls of his fringe and idly contemplating a haircut. John’s energy had not dissipated, and he still hadn’t left the flat for whatever errand he seemed set on when he had returned from work. The doctor was currently faffing in the cluttered kitchen and occasionally taking rushed mouthfuls of the too-hot tea he had just made.
Sherlock was actually scuffing his feet like a stubborn toddler as John pulled him with considerable effort down the street.
"No, I'm sure that won't be necessary. You resized me last time. I'll take these. And another pair in red for John."
He grinned into the dark, shaking his head. It seemed he needed to have a talk with Sherlock in the morning.
John grinned and squeezed Sherlock's large hand back. He appeared to hesitate about something for a moment, his dark eyes thoughtful and distant. Licking his lips, he propped himself up a little and retrieved his phone, amazed that it still had one bar of battery life after its arduous day.
Sherlock was flushed a shocking pink which made his wide, pale eyes even more striking in comparison. "Um, can I just...just once? Now?"
John stared at the brunette, who flashed an impossibly-cheeky grin. He was about to ask some of the questions that had been haunting him, but Shaun shook his head in an almost telepathic response, saying in his charmingly-thick accent, "They'll wonder where we've got to." He promptly turned, looking frustratingly unruffled, and once again, totally unperturbed by what had just happened.
"Jesus." John moaned, humping at Sherlock's face before he could stop himself and groaning as his cock slipped over Sherlock's tongue. Sherlock released the faintest, asphyxiated little sobs of need. "Oh, fuck. Come, love." John was shaking with exertion, his body contorted awkwardly. The shivery, 'too much' stimulation of his cock was making him antsy and he couldn't wait for it to end.
Sherlock's mouth went dry. He belatedly realized he was breathing faster than normal, his chest rapidly rising and falling at the gorgeous sight of John, half naked and erect, in front of him. John's thighs, muscular and stout instead of lean, were covered in a fine smattering of light coloured hair. The same hair surrounded John's cock (average length, slightly above average girth, with a gentle upward curve), in greater quantity and decidedly darker, though still blonde.
“Come on, you wouldn’t know rudeness if it smacked you in the face. Besides, you know I’m right,” John teased, as he slowly pulled off his own underwear and lay back with a teasing grin. Sherlock was going to take him, and John liked it rough, therefore an angry Sherlock was entirely conducive to his needs.
Lestrade had accepted it as if John and Sherlock had always been together, which was a relief despite the odd joke here and there. The man had been married a fair while too, so he might have some insight on whatever... him and Sherlock... were.
The doctor bit down on his right thumbnail in a vague sublimation of a curse. "You look fucking amazing." John confessed honestly, huffing in irritation at the refusal of his body to co-operate with the frankly-overwhelming lust which churned enthusiastically, but redundantly, through his system.
“Please, go ahead, you know very well that I enjoy a bit of erotic asphyxiation,” Sherlock responded candidly, looking at his fingernails with a complete and almost totally-believable air of distraction.
"I..." There was a distinctive and notable pause as Sherlock gritted his teeth, squirming entirely unintentionally as the carnal undertones of John's voice made him shudder.
Sherlock rolled off of his doctor obediently, eyes lightly closed, his damp body limp, and a silly smile on his sculptured face.
Those few words almost did John in. He felt the frustratingly redundant throb of arousal between his own legs, his cock too spent to get hard again so soon, and groaned. "Sherlock, I want to be inside you," he admitted deliriously, before depressing the button on the toy and rubbing it shakily over Sherlock's tumescent shaft.
Sherlock, swallowing with a grimace, took a few wheezy, fortifying breaths and decided he couldn't find the effort to form complete sentences. Not yet. He fumbled one shaking hand to John's neglected phone beside them and typed in a message, at a much slower pace than his usual super-speed. When he was done, he held the now-damp screen up for John to read the unusually inelegant message.
Sherlock moaned happily, smiling, the events of last night filtering back through his mind in wonderfully stunning detail. That had been fun. Immensely satisfying. And he'd got away with it- John hadn't known. Perfect.
“Yes! I was lying!" Sherlock burst out quickly, knowing John was putting him on but unable to think of a poor bee in such pain. "I was lying, John. I want to get off. But.." He sighed. "That wasn't what was supposed to happen. It will just be proving me right that you can't go without sex."
You’re not busy. You just had a night terror. You’ll go down for a drink of water in a few minutes because you are dehydrated. Get me the pen. – SH
Clearing his throat, he called out to the brunette in the bathroom wincing slightly at the smouldering sunlight from the open curtains. "Sherl? Stop faffing about and get back in here. I need you."
John paused. "I thought this was what you wanted?" He experienced a horrible feeling of doubt. "I'm sorry...I'll...we'll do whatever you want.."
John panted excitedly at the incredible response, biting his own lip in wonderment when Sherlock pulled back with a hiss, before burying his face in John’s neck and shuddering. John marvelled at the taller man’s intense reactions to such minimal stimulus – he himself was only barely starting to physically respond, still soft for the most part. He wondered dizzily at Sherlock suddenly scrabbling at his wrist, before he realised that the detective wanted to hold his hand. Grabbing the hot, fumbling hand protectively, resulted in a deep-toned groan of relief.
"I'll be back soon, Sherlock." John chuckled, eluding the long, grasping hands of his lover. "Try not to get in any trouble while I'm gone."
“No. How can you ask me that? You saw me moments ago when you put the light on. Did I look naked to you?” Sherlock huffed between a short, quick series of chuckles. “I only sleep naked in the summer—Well, actually, I should say that I typically sleep naked in the summer. I don’t always.”
"Can't you just...can't you just touch?" Sherlock asked throatily, already disoriented and quite frankly stunned by the sensation of another person's fingers on his shaft.
“You have to admit that we solved the case because of it. Without that prussic acid…pig flesh is, biologically, remarkably similar to human flesh, you know. And you got it just when I was at my wit’s end. You must have had a sixth sense. It really helped me a lot, John.”
"We've done that before, John." Sherlock reminded him, scooting back closer and sealing their bodies together. "Your friends and I...don't get on."
"Stop…thinking…S'annoying." Sherlock mumbled, cracking open an eye to stare up at John. His lips quirked up in a half-smile and John huffed, leaning down and giving Sherlock a few reassuring kisses on his slightly bloodied lips, his flushed cheeks, somewhat concerned by the fierce heat Sherlock's reddened skin was giving off.
John smirked, humour in the crinkles of his face, and arousal in the spark of his dark eyes. "Make love to me."
And John, fuming and red-faced, fully intended to go back to his office and eat his lunch in peace, perhaps while searching for a new job, when Jason's oily voice drifted out into the hall.
He took a sip of his beer, pretending not to notice Sherlock sliding down the zip of his jeans and insinuating his fingers into the opening, stroking John's cock delicately. He stared straight ahead, trying to pay attention to some bullshit story his friend was telling while his cock throbbed into full hardness.
He rested his mobile on his chest, resigned and waiting for Mrs. Hudson's inevitable text back. This was a regular argument he and Mrs. Hudson had- or rather, she argued while Sherlock did his best to tune her out. John would never want him, despite Mrs. Hudson's assurances he did, that John was just a gentleman and he didn't want to pressure Sherlock or make him feel uncomfortable.
John nodded, placed Sherlock's muffin in front of him, and sat in his own chair, sipping at his coffee, content to watch the passersby while Sherlock did his clandestine research.
"Just...yes," Sherlock murmured vaguely, backing away from John and settling himself on the bed, toeing off his shoes and socks and burying his toes in the carpet, flexing them nervously as John knelt in front of him. John reached up, bringing Sherlock's head down so he could gently kiss him, slowly stroking his tongue along Sherlock's and burying his hands in Sherlock's thick curls. He didn't grasp at the silky curls, didn't tug or yank at them as he sometimes did. Instead, he used his light grip to gently direct their kiss, tipping Sherlock's head to the side.
John grinned, but his eyes still betrayed a considerable amount of awkwardness. The detective quirked his head slightly, and swept down to overwhelm him with an intense, heated, wet snog, tongue swiping possessively at the enamel of John's teeth, and the slight ribbing of the roof of his mouth.
"Okay. I'm....alright," Sherlock announced in a fragile yet deep voice, his eyes concentrated on the soft, wet target between John's legs. He applied lubricant to his cock and then nudged forward a few awkward centimetres on his knees, pressing his eager, swollen tip to John's entrance, huffing a couple of grounding breaths before easing forward. John took a deep breath and tensed when the head of Sherlock's cock popped past the first ring of his muscles and Sherlock froze, tensing himself and gripping John tightly.
“Would have thought woodlice were a bit pedestrian for you,” John commented lightly, glancing up at his petulant flatmate. “Surely you were pulling them apart as a five-year-old in the garden. Come to think of it, most five-year-olds probably were.”
"Might want to pull off." He said hurriedly, tugging lightly at Sherlock's hair but Sherlock sucked his cock deeper, swirling his tongue over and over the head- and John was lost. He shouted when he came, a wordless expletive, spilling into Sherlock's mouth in short, quick bursts that left him shaking and gasping for air. He twitched and shivered through his orgasm, breathless and wordless for thirty seconds before blinking his eyes open. Sherlock's mouth was still on his cock, his eyes closed, tongue lapping up every molecule he could acquire from John's ejaculate, his hands traversing from John's body to his own temples, fingers poised in their 'Real-Life to Mind Palace transition' position.
Molly had just turned back to the food she no longer needed considering she was stirring with a new kind of hunger, before those words had her eyes snapping back to Sherlock's face.
John could still feel Sherlock's lips against his cheek, his hot breath ghosting over the doctor's flesh. It was when he felt the tip of his cock pressing against something that was definitely not a mouth that his eyes flew open.
John was a bit hazy about how they'd got here. One moment they'd been talking, having an awkward conversation over coffee, and the next Shaun was dragging him away from prying eyes, dropping to his knees and-
always buy things. Anything I tell you, in fact. Even that posh heated lubricant I sent you on an errand for," He said, unconsciously rewarding himself with a few stunned and affronted glares from other shoppers in the vicinity. He dumped the next batch of pineapples into the trolley while John flushed, avoiding the curious stares from the other shoppers. "Besides, this is all for
John's eyes were still closed. Was he fantasizing about Shaun? Remembering the last time he'd done this with his ex-lover? Was Sherlock not doing it right, was so repulsive that John had to pretend he was someone else? Was that what John had been doing the whole time?
John grunted with a perverse satisfaction, sucking hard just under the tip of Sherlock's shaft and pushing the detective's toy just a few more tempting centimetres inside with a jolt of effort, doing his best to control the bucking brunette whose violent howls were actually hurting his eardrums with the remarkable decibels they reached.
“Would be a waste of mitochondria,” Sherlock muttered, moving back from the mantelpiece and scowling as his landlady carried on tidying up.
Sherlock knuckled a hot bead of sweat from his pale forehead with his free hand. “Such a radical, John.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to expound his statistics on London's male rape crimes, the high ratio of rapes to murders, and inform John of a relevant rape-murder involving a drag queen which had happened two streets over less than three years ago…but changed his mind at the last second.
"J-John?" Sherlock gasped, eyes blinking open, dark and full of want. His hips stuttered forward again, once, twice...and then John saw the moment Sherlock realized what he was doing…Why it was wrong of him to be doing it.
intimately." The still-unnamed sales assistant purred, giving Sherlock a once-over that set John's teeth on edge. "I've been dressing him the past four years." He gave a small, nostalgic sigh and John got the feeling the young man would have rather
John may have wanted to stroke himself as quickly as possible and be over and done with it, but, if Sherlock were going to have to do such a mundane task, he fully intended to make the most of it.
"Christ, Sherlock." he exclaimed helplessly, tongue coming out to lick at his lips, throat bobbing with a desirous swallow. He reached out and brushed his fingers against the wet spot, lips parting as he felt the damp warmth of Sherlock's release. "I did that." He murmured, rather stunned Sherlock had come so quickly, just from John muttering filthy things to him.
Sherlock's hand tightened exponentially on John's, and his swallow was obvious, and the bob of his white throat was eyed by both of the men beside him. An ugly grimace finally relented and commandeered his delicate, masculine features. "I'll tell you what John wants. He wants the delight of your total and permanent absence from his life. And if you ever attempt, in any way, to contact him again, I will personally cut off your stagnant testicles with a rusty scalpel, fry them in garlic, and make you eat them. Do I make myself
"Yeah, it's great." John slid onto his own seat, putting his hand over Sherlock's knee as soon as the taller man sat beside him.
“Well, you……” Sherlock appeared to hesitate, before relenting and spewing out a nervous stream of quick deductions, his face growing redder and more discomfited by the second. “You’ve exclusively dated women and repeatedly denied homosexual leanings. Today I expressed my interest in you – specifically, that I had fallen in love with you – it then transpired that you, a hot-blooded male, had gone without sex for what you consider a prolonged and unacceptable period of time. You also learnt that I am a virgin. The opportunity must have been too good for you to pass up. Because suddenly, here we are in bed. You’ll get your rocks off and also be doing me a favour by ‘popping my cherry’ and substantiating my feelings for you.”
“Mm?” Sherlock replied in a low, husky sort of a hum, one that was integrated with a groan of delight as he arched up and urged John further down.
Beneath him, John was groaning, pushing into each thrust with a slight whimper. He fumbled at his cock, jerking it frantically, out of sync with Sherlock's slow thrusts, trying to speed his own orgasm along before Sherlock came. Sherlock, however, was starting to feel an unnerving, gut-clenching certainty that something wasn't right. The metaphoric twist of his insides at his physiological nervousness was matched by a very physical, albeit very gradual deflation of his erection. Taking a fortifying breath. Sherlock pushed harder, slightly panicked as he watched the smaller man below him forcing along his own climax.
"...You could do that now...I like it," Shaun confessed quietly, sighing with an amalgam of disappointment and hope as John removed his finger from inside him.
"...You've borrowed my toothpaste. Knob," John murmured affectionately, whilst trying to remember exactly how much leeway he had to shuffle backwards without actually tumbling out of his rather humble bed. "This must be a dream, because you shun all my cheap stuff."
Sherlock thought frantically, ransacking John's extensive room in his Mind Palace feverishly. The flesh-coloured filing cabinet with suspicious white stains on it that housed sexual memories was quickly overturned and hordes of powerful physical triggers hit him at once, leaving him struggling to articulate. "Muscles,” he said abruptly. “The ones I could see in your thighs and abdomen clenching, they told my eyes you were exhausted and ecstatic and alive. And the ones I couldn't see, I could
"I don't want to be better. I want to be perfect," Sherlock muttered. "Otherwise, why would you -" He abruptly shut up, snapping his jaws closed, and pulled the duvet over his head, his near-black curls smooshed sweetly under heavy fabric.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “You’ve discovered my secret. However did you figure it out?” he drawled in deep sarcasm and then shot him a sudden glaring look. “
"-incident...but then you had to come back and act...like a fucking...five year old. All because you wanted sex. You wanted this." John cursed and started fucking into Sherlock again, as hard as he wanted, chasing his own orgasm, openly and selfishly.
He panicked briefly as Sherlock's strong, heavy hips bucked, his thigh muscles flexed and jerked, and a deep, throaty shriek sounded out somewhere above him, but he managed to hold on to his detective through his brief, violent climax. He nipped and kissed at Sherlock's inner thighs, massaging his backside and hips, as the detective came down with massive, heaving, noisy gasps, swallowing deeply every few seconds, all his muscles twitching with exertion.
At John's angry shout, Sherlock turned, clicking off the bedroom light as he left, finding John and Molly in the foyer, both out of breath and red faced. Molly 's face brightened on seeing Sherlock...then grew worried.
John huffed a sweet, high-pitched laugh, his face brightening beautifully. He eyed the last three cookies. Sherlock was about to crush one of them in a strong fist when he caught John's anxious excitement, betrayed by his breathing rate, pulse, and frankly everything in his demeanour.
"I know you're going to check for yourself anyway so…yes, I like bondage. As much as you like getting off in public." John grinned. Sherlock smiled in return.
John sat back and, biting his bottom lip as he knelt above Sherlock's knees, took hold of his own hard cock. He immediately started a forceful rhythm of mindless, animalistic thrusts into his own fist, exuding constant, shaky groans.
"Oh, shit..." John's hips thrust forward as he came, come dribbling from his prick and spattering down to decorate Sherlock's hair in thick, fat drops. He stared down at the mess as he came, eyes dark.
Molly openly gaped at John, flicking her chocolate brown eyes over to Sherlock as he filled in the more indiscreet details of their story, overriding his doctor and taking pleasure in expounding the intricacies of their pairing.
"It's not like you have room to talk." John reminded him, lifting his head to see where the vibrator had got to.
"Mm...think it'd be fairly obvious." John smirked, looking at Sherlock through slitted eyes, pleased when Sherlock blushed as he watched John's hand moving under the covers.
Limp and lethargic, Sherlock returned the kiss slowly at first, but then seemed to regain more vigour and interest seconds later to open his mouth for more and reach for John, pulling him close, “You now,” he husked, reaching down to timidly brush his knuckles against John’s crotch.
“Well, no, if you insist on being pedantic. I thought we could skip all that…stuff,” he waved his hands airily, “and just get to the end. Which is now.”
John moaned but dutifully opened the phone with his left hand and saw who was calling. Sherlock listened to him talk, obviously to Mrs Hudson, and was startled when John slapped him on the arse.
As music started playing, John brought his towel up and scrubbed at his hair, feeling a little ridiculous as he struck something of a pose, legs spread apart, one hip cocked to the side, arse on display. When he lowered the towel and snuck a glance, Sherlock had wandered in from the hallway and was hovering, unsure and clearly aroused, in the doorway to the sitting room. His rose was gone and John wondered where he'd dropped it this time.
here?" John couldn't stop his emotions from mirroring Sherlock's sarcastic bitterness, mostly because he felt Sherlock's attitude was uncalled for and he was getting a little fed up of the petulant child act.
John felt a small frown crease his features, not quite liking the predatory look in Sherlock's eyes. "I don't think..." John swallowed hard, unsure what kind of territory he was walking into. Sherlock had been merciless with his deceptions lately, and it had made John wary.
Sherlock raised his head, glanced down, and then let out a noise comprised of frustration and utter lust as he watched John’s ash-brown hair tickle his pale thigh. Letting his head fall back, he panted, closing his eyes and suddenly shuddering hard, before going relatively calm again.
He grinned at his wrecked and trembling detective. "How often do you use this? And…" John paused to clear his throat and his distracted thoughts, highly aroused and wishing he could get hard again. "…do you…always use it in bed?" John couldn't help his imagination furnishing him with delicious, vibrant pictures of Sherlock fucking himself all over the flat when desperation seized him.
"You were listening to my conversations?" John asked, then snorted. "Not surprised you were. Yeah...I did say that but...we don't have to be dating- officially- or anything, Sherlock. It's...whatever you want." John gave Sherlock a serious look. "
Fifteen minutes later, John halted outside a busy Costa's, hands in his pockets. He hadn't said much during their walk and Sherlock had to grudgingly commend him on being almost as stubborn as he was. That was fine. There was still plenty of time to get the information he wanted out of John.
Sherlock thought about refusing. He was still angry and hurt and, while he accepted John's apology, it still didn't solve the problem.
Locking his arms around John, Sherlock rested most of his weight on him, feeling John support him admirably. "I'm not lying, John, when I tell you this. And it's not...endorphins. It's not lies, it's not...something I would say unless I really meant it..." He paused before whispering against John's neck. "I love you. John Watson. I utterly love you. I don't know why or how you put up with me. I know I'm impossible sometimes...rude, arrogant...demanding...but...I am grateful-"
!" John jerked, not having expected Shaun to do...to do that. He squirmed as Shaun plunged his tongue past his loosened ring of muscles again and again, swallowing enthusiastically. Guttural groans and sharp, breathless gasps of air between his thighs truly bewildered the inebriated doctor. He was edging beyond 'drunk enough to enjoy and accept and remember,' and nearing the state of 'I'm not really sure what's going on but it feels alright, but now I'm getting tired.' His indigo eyes blinking heavily, he nudged at Shaun's short black hair. "Wha' you doing?"
Now, with his dominant hand useless, John worked on different ways to grasp himself and awkwardly began stroking his cock, watching it sluggishly fill out beneath the water. He tried to keep himself from thinking of...well, anything. Not Shaun. Definitely not Sherlock. Just concentrating on the sensations and trying to drag pleasure from his body. He needed the stress relief that an orgasm offered.
John was stunned, not sure what to even think of that new information, his mind already spiralling down a not-very-pleasant train of thought- when Sherlock giggled heartily.
His life had been irrevocably changed. He wasn't out of hospital yet so there weren't any decisions he needed to make except get better. Rest. Relax. Let others take care of him. It was horrible. He chafed under the constant care, the way the staff looked so concerned and talked in in a hushed voice to him. He wanted to shout at all of them. He'd sent Shaun numerous messages, none of which had been answered, and John wondered about that. He knew Shaun was still alive, had made enquiries about him, but he remained silent.
what I want to do with you," John muttered, swallowing with a faintly-unattractive gulp, his indigo eyes somehow dark and bright at the same time. As he spoke, he divested himself of the rest of his uniform.
Shaun rocked back against John, his hand a blur at his own groin. "Oh, god yeah. God...like that. D-do it like that."
John didn't know what to say, torn between outright rejecting him for a deed that might emotionally scar him even more, and grudgingly accepting. He felt Sherlock's large, cool hands slowly, so slowly, pull his own towards his crotch.
John wiggled his fingers inside the detective, moving his hand until he could curl them and stroke that lovely, soft bundle of nerves in the way he knew Sherlock liked it. His body was trembling from the force of his arousal and he found himself rolling his hips idly against the sofa. He sucked harder, taking him deeper, keeping himself occupied with Sherlock's cock and not the fact that he was being begged to fuck the man into the cushions.
"Really?" John whispered back, leaning up to reach Sherlock's ear, stroking his newly-short hair briefly, and catching sight of the creepy sales assistant in the background. There were few places for the interloper to loiter out of sight in the remarkably empty, yet massively-overpriced shop.
There was a shocked chorus of snickers and giggles and Jason smirked viciously, glancing around the room.
He nearly choked when John's hand unpredictably grabbed his own and forced his long finger deep inside, twisting the axis of Sherlock's wrist so that his fingertip hit John's prostate with almost disturbing accuracy.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed, white hot anger starting to bubble to the surface as he processed her utter shock over the fact that John had a boyfriend. So John hadn't told anyone he worked with they were together. The knowledge that John had hidden it away as if he were ashamed of it…hurt. It seemed Sherlock would need to make a trip to John's place of work and let them know John was
John lost track of how long they lay together. Sherlock was motionless in front of him, his breaths even and deep, and John thought, after a few minutes, he'd gone back to sleep. It made something funny but pleasant rise in his chest at the idea of Sherlock falling asleep in his arms and he thought, for the first time, that maybe they should share a bed more often. He'd thought it was a good idea their keeping separate beds since they'd just started their relationship…but this was so nice. John could see himself falling asleep with Sherlock in his arms every night-
Sherlock, dizzied and dazed by lust, by the cloying words John was saying, flinched in delight as John relentlessly smooched across his cheekbones, his jaw, traced the little dip of his philtrum with his tongue, making Sherlock gasp.
Molly sighed heavily at the self-conscious words from the beautiful detective in the next bedroom, spreading herself with her left hand whilst simultaneously inserting the vibrator even more deeply, using the tip of her right forefinger to stimulate her clitoris.
He licked his plump lips indulgently, feeling the twinge of a dormant orgasm, but he forced himself to calm down once more, two long and dextrous fingers still buried inside himself. With his free hand, he scrambled for the vibrator, his inanimate neighbour in the stripped bed, and proceeded to slick it with lubricant, clumsily and without grace, with one hand.
She couldn't hear everything John and Sherlock were saying, only the occasional odd word that made no sense- something about milk, which was puzzling- but the rumble of Sherlock's voice through the wall was enough to speed her along. Molly rolled her hips as she flicked the button on her vibrator, finally turning it on, the buzzing sending her body into quick little shocks of pleasure, promising presages of more to come.
John giggled. "Happy us." He agreed, motioning toward the table. "I, uh, ordered your favorite and...Christ. Is this too cheesy? This is ridiculous, isn't it? You think I'm being stupid." He scrubbed the back of his neck, agitated, hating the way Sherlock was still silent, staring at him as if he were more appalled than flattered.
The tall brunette chuckled as he moved his arms to hook underneath John's, his hands curling back to grip his shoulders.
been naughty." He said, taking the vibrator from the drawer and looking at it properly, still rather amazed Sherlock- Sherlock Holmes- used a sex toy to toss himself off with. Not only that, but one that was so...
"Whoever she's recently had sex with, obviously. She's the sort of person who would delight in informing everybody she knows the moment she confirmed that her uterus was occupied with a foetus. It must have been relatively recent. She's intelligent enough to realise that a missed period is a warning sign, and of course she's qualified in the medical field. Within the last two months, then. Who's she been going out with? That......" There was a long, furrow-browed pause. "…...Craig?"
"The roof's caved in Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock had nothing to do with it." He gave his boyfriend a swift look. "Did you?"
Painfully aware of his own heartbeat now, practically vibrating through the mattress, John nodded, and was appalled to find himself on the verge of tears again. Not daring to speak for fear of his voice breaking, he nodded once more, and blindly pressed a very small, very quick kiss to Sherlock's cheek, before settling back into his pillow. It had been almost impulsive. A quick thank you. An expression of affection. John was glad for the darkness.
John led Sherlock over to the table, the taller man trying to hover behind him and appear as if he belonged in such a place. The soldier was greeted with a yell of "John!"
“Of course.” He watched the detective upend the bag, smoothing a layer into his storage box, creating a makeshift litter tray.
Laughing breathlessly, John took the opportunity of illumination and a bare bed to flip Sherlock's weight with ease, cradling his torso and skull as he bundled him onto his back, proceeding to snog him with grin-stretched lips. Sherlock moaned in reaction and arched up to keep them as connected as physically possible, even going so far as to part and bend his legs. His skin was scorching and the beat of his heart was suddenly, tremendously, very noticeable from both his throat and his chest, as it seemed to vibrate his entire heaving ribcage.
," the brunette muttered, eyes squeezing resolutely closed, swallowing extravagantly and nudging at the occiput of John's head, forcing him even deeper into his own crotch. "...John you've got to tell me what it is," Sherlock uttered hurriedly, writhing on the damp bed.
“Why would I tell anyone? Who would I tell?” Sherlock said with a small scoff that blew over John’s hairline just before Sherlock’s lips brushed the sensitive skin of his ear. “Your secret is safe with me, John.” John could literally hear the smirk that grew after the uttered words.
"John...this isn't the right place to...Ugh!" He yelped, loudly, as John flicked open his trousers with mind-boggling speed and skill, and shoved his hands into Sherlock's underwear. Sherlock winced with pleasure, but mostly with the realisation that John now had a few fingers' worth of copious, lukewarm pre-come on his hands.
John drank in Shaun's choked breaths like manna as the brunette struggled to claim each inhale, and force out each desperate exhale with a tangible, thrilled panic. He felt a fresh flash of fury at the thought of Shaun's other conquests, of Shaun doing this with all the other men, and he gave a particularly violent thrust. Shaun yelled and his cock filled in John's hand, impossibly hard, before he came, hips jerking forward as his orgasm was ripped from his body. He sobbed, shaking, as the last tremors ransacked his body.
John gave out a splutter just as Greg choked on his own tongue, and the atmosphere around them was suddenly so thick with awkwardness that John could hardly take a breath.
"Are you sure you don't need me to resize you, Sherlock? It's been at least two months since you last bought pants. You may have gone up a size." Chaucer explained, looking- to John's mind- anticipative.
Sherlock laughed, startled, and for the moment pushed the repulsive, horrid thoughts from his mind. He devoted himself to the task of kissing John, sliding his tongue between his lips for John to suck on. This did, however, require further thought.
John shrugged. "I wanted to see what you were going to do. And then when I realised…didn't want you to stop." He leaned forward, fingertips tracing the side of Sherlock's neck, making goosebumps break out along his skin. "Wish I could've seen it though." He murmured, eyes dropping to Sherlock's lips. "God, the
"Hmm? Oh, there was nothing on TV and I was bored. I didn't want to wake you so I thought I'd..." Sherlock trailed off, his eyes still fixed on the screen of the laptop, and John turned his head, wondering what held Sherlock's attention so much.
Sherlock could hear the heart monitor attached to him start to get faster, broadcasting his distress, and the door opened, John quickly striding in with a worried look on his face.
John's face was blank as he eyed the space beside Sherlock, which Sherlock patted encouragingly. "Sherlock...I don't..." John trailed off awkwardly. "I don't know what I want, alright? Especially from you.”
"It was...indescribable...so...so new, so...so deep and…...I was inside you.” He beamed, loopy and delirious with pleasure and the knowledge of a job well done.
"Yes." He heard himself say, his voice breathy and slightly desperate but Sherlock only experienced the barest twinge of embarrassment. He was more concerned with kissing John and finally- finally-
Sherlock seized John's face, giving him a deep kiss, his tongue exploring a part of John which he had already committed to memory down to the last millimetre, and which he now just indulged in for simple pleasure and gratitude. Pulling back after a frankly dizzying snog, Sherlock licked his lips, breathing hard, and cupped John's cheek. "How do you want it to be? When I ask you? Tell me."
As John moved to mouth at his stomach, careful not to tickle him, Sherlock’s cock began to show more hopeful interest in the situation, twitching a few times against his lover's chest.
!" John shouted, as the exhausted detective did his best to finish his wildly bucking doctor off. Sherlock's cock, softened, slipped out of John's arse- John growled in protest- and so, never stopping his urgent hand at John's cock, Sherlock jammed three fingers of his other hand inside John's loosened hole and pumped them, fucked John with them, twisting his wrist and deliberately stroking over John's sensitive prostate.
"Because you're a fucking beanpole." John groused, settling himself along Sherlock's back and scooping him up in his arms. He curled his body around as much of Sherlock as he could and the taller man made a happy, contented noise.
Sherlock shrugged "That's his job. Clothes don't fit right unless all the appropriate measurements…"
Sherlock blanched and jerked away from John, rolling over in their bed and turning his back to him- not before John saw the prominent erection tenting his pyjama bottoms and the wet spot he'd leaked onto the fabric.
A flash of insecurity showed on Sherlock's face before it was wiped away by a confident smirk. "Whatever I want. That's the point of this, isn't it?"
He turned his phone off, tossing it to the side, and nestled in alongside John, burrowing into his chest and breathing in his sleep-warm smell. He wouldn't have this for days...he intended to make the most of it.
"She's a fucking state. A whore. Bloody...train wreck. Must be about seventy percent silicone. Feel bad for her, but.....Oh, was I right, by the way?" John asked, grinning hopefully.
"Not again." John said, pulling Sherlock away when he went to duck down again. "Not...not that deep, love. I don't want to hurt you and that...could seriously hurt you. Here." He grabbed Sherlock's hand and fisted it around his wet cock. "Like this. Just like this. God, I'm almost there after that anyway."
"I...should not have..." Sherlock searched for an appropriate word "...reached orgasm down your throat."
"If it helps, you don't look like one." Greg took a pull of his own drink before setting his friend with a more serious look. "What's going on, mate? You've got your classic 'Sherlock's fucked me off' face going on."
He managed to stop himself just in time, instantly admonishing himself for what he had been about to say. “-…But we both know that’s not the organ you usually think with.”
"Fuck you too, love…Bill. Hey," John answered, sounding enviably composed and amiable. "…Yeah...course...not doing anything tonight," he spoke happily into the phone, swatting away the detective who was selfishly nibbling at his navel.
He had watched his phone being taken from the room along with the rest of his clothes, and he could only pray that it was still turned on somewhere, and still had some battery life. The basement he was currently in after being subdued into near unconsciousness with fists, was practically subterranean. He wasn't sure how many flights of concrete steps he had been dragged down, but he was sure that any reception on his phone was going to be tenuous, if it existed at all.
"...John...tell me it's you." Sherlock demanded as he pumped slowly but forcibly into the toy, frowning in carnal concentration, hair starting to wilt into a pretty, dark mess.
, was never going to work. Besides, I assumed you weren’t interested. It always came across that your only attitude toward sex and relationships was basically disdain, if not actual disgust. Plus, you said you only just fell in love with me yesterday.”
John teased the tip of Sherlock's cock with the wet entrance of the flesh jack, easing it down over his cock, and Sherlock's head fell back against the pillow.
online. Why did you ask me if you don't want some kind of ceremony? Thought you'd love having the world revolve around you for a day."
Once he had finished, flicking cooled, sticky tissues into the toilet and flushing it, their gazes met, and they both let out brief, dirty chuckles, Sherlock's deep and devilish, John's higher-pitched and infectious.
. He gritted his teeth and tried his utmost to hold back the desperate, breathy yelps that burned up his throat as his body trembled through the orgasmic shocks of previously unknown intensity. The sharp lance of pain in his upper arm translated as the merest whisper in his head under the paralyzing weight of his climax. Sherlock's entire body was trembling, pleasure zinging through his frame. His brain felt fried.
John growled and wriggled, decisively shoving his detective off of him, causing Sherlock to bounce heavily on the bed beside him with a frustrated, baritone mewl.
Sherlock frowned at the dig at his lapse in logic, but a sharp vibration in his pocket reminded him that all was not lost. Mycroft may yet come through with a solution. At the bottom of the Pandora's Box of brotherhood, was perhaps one tiny, fat blob of hope.
“Do you want my help or not?" Sherlock spat, grimacing and crossing his arms, turning to stare out of the speeding taxi's window at the dizzy amalgam of populated tourist attractions, and the more-densely populated, less attractive districts of central London.
John would have preferred to take refuge in his admittedly chilly office all day and avoid the inevitable confrontation with his co-workers, but he was starving. Bracing himself, clenching his fists stoically in a habitually comforting motion, John exited his office, avoiding eye contact as he walked down the hall and trying his very best to appear nonchalant.
John abruptly stood up and, with stunning acuity and skill, disabled Sherlock with a few sharp, precise blows from expert palms and fists. Wrestling Sherlock to the bed, John quickly tied the momentarily incapacitated detective to the headboard with Sherlock's own scarf- handily pooled on the bedside table- and straddled Sherlock roughly.
"Um...no, not that..." Sherlock demurred quickly, nibbling his full bottom lip and looking worried. John frowned but shoved his worry to the side.
Sherlock's features darkened in discomfiture, and he swallowed, his succulent pale throat bobbing. "No John, your…your tongue, in … …I saw it on the internet," he murmured, gesturing one long, pale hand towards his crotch.
Whooshing out a breath, he focused back on Sherlock's cock, flushed and hard, surrounded by transparent silicone. He began to work the toy faster and Sherlock jolted, his hips thrusting up. He reflexively sucked hard on the soft, warm flesh in his mouth, the remaining tang of John's previously expelled semen a familiar and delightful treat on his tongue. John writhed as Sherlock sucked his cock, panting from overstimulation. It was an odd feeling. There was no way he would be able to get hard again and it was just sensation, pleasurable sensation, with nowhere to go. He didn't know if he hated it or loved it, if he wanted Sherlock to stop or keep going.
"Molly, I'm...sorry," John muttered, his face flushed in embarrassment and his eyes flicked warningly over towards the oblivious detective, who gobbled down creamy scrambled eggs happily, oblivious to the awkward silence he'd just created. John gave Sherlock a quick kick on the shin, hoping he would understand the inference and to leave off any and all further allusions to their sex life.
"Maybe you're looking at this the wrong way, dear. Maybe it means more than just sex. Has he explained to you why he won't...you know."
," Sherlock swallowed a few times, huffing a sharp exhale as he started a deliberate, slow, hard rhythm. His sore hands twitched as he sought the anchor of John's shirt.
Sherlock was truly baffled. It was barely 6 o'clock in the evening, and there was limited room in the suite for privacy. "Um...Shall we...can't we just...watch..." he struggled to remember the name of the TV show John liked. "Supernormal?"
nine. Sherlock's eyes slid over to John, guiltily. There was nothing to consider. He was going to take the case. He'd already told Mycroft he would be there. To have a car ready for him in an hour or so. He didn't know how to break it to John.
"And you'd let me take it off you afterward?" John asked, grinning. A couple (who looked as if they probably had at least two Rolls Royce's in the garage) walked past, glancing at him as they overhead his comment. Sherlock seemed completely unconcerned with passers-by.
"Well. Yes. That's…good to know. You're very welcome, dear. It was…nice to meet you." She gestured helplessly, clearly at a loss. "Run along now. We'll call…well, perhaps you'd better call us, John."
!" John yelped when Sherlock, without warning, ducked down, engulfing John's erection in his mouth and sucking wetly at it. Hollowing his brutally-sharp cheeks, the brunette swallowed John's cock repeatedly and indulgently, his gag reflex as unresponsive as that of a professional competitive eater.
"Sherlock, get on your knees." John stated tiredly. When Sherlock's mouth opened in surprise, John flicked his pointed finger toward the carpet, as if commanding a dog to sit. Sherlock blinked rapidly, obvious confusion suffusing his face as he slowly walked closer to John. He gave him a searching, puzzled look before gracefully sinking to his knees, wincing slightly when he made contact with the semen-stained carpet.
"I told you...you know I was a...that I didn't have any experience before you." Sherlock said awkwardly, hating to use the word "virgin" in relation to himself.
"…Let's make this quick then," John instructed, standing from the bed and holding out his hand. "Don't think I'm going
It was late the next afternoon when John was given the all-clear to leave the hospital, so long as he was under constant surveillance and 'took it easy.' A few texts to Mrs. Hudson had informed them that the flat's repairs were well underway, but that the premises weren't yet habitable. The effort John was putting into not limping was more of a burden than the actual pain from the deep stab wound he'd sustained.
John was only too happy to take that prize, sliding his hand over the hot length, seeing what sounds he could tear from Sherlock's throat as he stroked him while Sherlock slowly slid up and down on his cock.
!” Sherlock shouted, apparently in full sulk mode. There was a bang and a squeak of the bed, and John could just about imagine the lanky detective dramatically sprawled over the mattress, knowing without a doubt that would be the picture if he went to look.
"Oh, Jesus fucking Christ," John uttered without conscious thought, staring down at the sight beneath him, before wrangling his own wayward dick metaphorically, and physically. Taking his free hand to himself, he squeezed reassuringly, as if in promise of imminent pleasure.
