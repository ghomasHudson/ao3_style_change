Castiel shoots up like an arrow. Michael, distracted, doesn’t see him coming until the last minute. Castiel tackles him directly in the chest, wrapping him up in his arms and legs in an unbreakable bear hug. Sam and Dean are fifty feet below them, a hundred feet out. Using all of his strength, he braces against Michael’s thrashing and yelling, rotating them until Michael’s back is facing towards where the brothers are barreling forth.
The tall grass and flowering weeds rustle, dispersed not by wind, but from the charge of their grace crackling through the air.
fuzzy around the edges. Blinking a few times, Castiel pulls his glasses off his face and starts cleaning them idly with his shirt. “Why are the symbols vibrating like that?”
"Benny," Dean smiles warmly, the one he always reserves for the burly police officer. "Ready to leave your wife for me yet?"
Thinning his lips, Castiel picks out the yellow fluff, dropping it onto his napkin. He takes a sip of his tainted coffee, gathering his thoughts. “I am not your father.”
“If what you’re telling me is true - and I know you’ve never lied to me - Dean’s being protected by the government, or someone important. For some reason. I’ve been meeting with him for hours, Charlie. He insists that he didn’t kill anything that wasn’t worth killing.”
“Mmmh,” Charlie stuffs the muffin into her mouth and holds it there with just her teeth, pulling over her wireless keyboard and tapping around on the keys. Castiel sits quietly, eating his muffin and watching her fingers move with idle interest. After a few moments she takes the muffin out of her mouth and grins, pointing at the monitor on the right, “There we go. It’s a pawn shop, so they have surveillance in that alley.”
Slowly, Castiel returns to his seat. He’s still poised to flee, belatedly remembering the panic button the guard had told him about. He could hit it at any time, leave and never come back. Pamela had said that he would be able to interview Dean once a week up to the date of his execution, but he also had the option to stop at any time. Shoulders getting stiff from tension, Castiel’s back stays straight as he sets the recorder down on the table again. He hadn’t pressed ‘stop’.
“How old?” She picks up her fork, collects some salad on it, and then scrapes her teeth over the tines as she eats.
A bit of sadness fills Castiel. Ghosts helping them from beyond the grave. Whatever world they won’t return to, he won’t have a Charlie. He won’t have a lot of things, but as he searches Dean’s face, he suddenly realizes he’ll have everything to gain. “For the record,” Castiel leans back in his chair, folding his arms over his chest, “I still think you’re a psychopath.”
The last image lingering in his brain is Dean on his knees, bloody and broken, begging Castiel to come back to him.
“Good point.” She laughs, patting his back affectionately. “Don’t get all pruny, you still have two other tables to take care of.”
The driver’s side door opens. The man that steps out is unfamiliar, handsome in a suit and tie, black hair slicked back and his white smile reflecting the gleam of the snow. Feeling shabby, Castiel clears his throat and swings the shovel up to prop it up over the back of his shoulders.
Dean recoils, the anger and frustration on his father’s face unlike anything he’s seen. Next to him, Sam is trembling like a leaf. Dropping their bags into the footwell, Dean brings Sam into his chest, wrapping his arms protectively around him. Sam’s gangly and reedy, all knees and elbows, but he curls into Dean perfectly, his face pressed into Dean’s neck.
“At the very least the law requires a public attorney to be assigned if a suspect can’t afford a lawyer.”
Pamela!” Charlie suddenly yells, standing up from the couch and practically vaulting over the coffee table on her way into the kitchen. “I almost forgot, I’m such an idiot!”
Castiel sends his car an amused glance as he walks away from it, a shovel slung over his shoulders as he goes deeper into the woods. “I haven’t scared anyone today.”
Castiel’s hand shoots out, grabbing the nurse’s wrist. He looks up at the man’s face, eyes wide and hot. “The baby?”
As they walk down the stairs side by side, he sneaks a glance at Michael. He hasn’t touched Dean, leered at him or made him uncomfortable. He answered a few questions Dean had about media types but other than that, he seemed perfectly content to let Dean do his own things. Right now the man still has that soft smile on his features, which are totally relaxed. He looks like an entirely different man, than the frustrated an angry person who had a standing weekly appointment with Dean, the man that only showed his teeth when feral.
“Hey,” Dean scoots to the edge of the couch closest to where Castiel is sitting in the recliner. His smile is soft and earnest, that boyish sparkle in his eyes. “You’re my family now, too. A’right? I know I can be kind of a dick, but I know you mean well. And you-” he licks his lips, shrugging and trying to casually avert his gaze. “You been doin’ right by me. This whole time. I dunno how to repay you-” he holds up a hand when Castiel opens his mouth to protest, “-and I know you say I don’t gotta. But the least I can do is treat you with the same respect and decency I do my own family.”
“What about you?” Castiel asks. His eyes flick down to his recorder, the light flashing intermittently, reminding him that this is an interview to try and get more information out of Dean. So far each meeting has been a drawn out conversation, but Dean somehow gets everything to turn on its head and focus on Castiel. Castiel is long past thinking that he leads these interviews, but he still tries to keep them on track whenever he can pull himself out of the depths of Dean’s lush spring green irises long enough to remember that he’s here as an investigative journalist, not some sort of long lost friend.
wearing his pajamas and looking- looking-” His cheeks flush. “It looked like a walk of shame, Benny.”
Questions burn through Castiel. How long has this been going on? Dean has clearly been in the hospital before- had the injuries been worse? Had it taken longer for him to heal? Dean had told Castiel that he’d been finished with school, but Castiel can see now that Dean likely dropped out. Did he drop out to work? To- to sell himself, to support his brother and home when his father couldn’t? The odd nights Dean took off from the club, was it because-
The boy makes an airy, positive noise in reply. Castiel leaves the hospital room, nodding at Benny who walks past him to head inside. On the walk through the maze of hallways and people bustling about, Castiel resolves himself to do anything he can to help Dean.
Undeterred by the obvious subject change, Michael rubs either of Dean’s biceps with his palms. Another cluck of his tongue and that pitying look has Dean queasy. “Do you not trust me?”
"Ha!" Dean laughs mockingly in reply. Castiel says nothing as he disappears down the hallway. "Cas? Cas!" Castiel's bedroom door shuts, muffling Dean's voice. "That's not funny Cas! Hey! You can't- you can't ground me, y'hear? Hey!!!"
Ducking his head to hide his smile, Dean takes a moment to gather himself before playfully knocking Castiel’s hands away from his shoulders. “Yeah, yeah, alright.”
Castiel doesn’t drink often, but after leaving the prison, an hour having gone by quicker than anticipated, he wastes no time in telling his taxi driver to take him to the bar by his house despite the fact it’s only three in the afternoon. Satchel in hand he settles down heavily on a stool at the bar, clumsily bumping his knuckles on the underside of the bartop to find a hook to hang his bag. Once he finds it he puts both hands on the bar and waits for the bartender to notice him; he holds up two fingers and Benny, the bartender, smiles warmly and dutifully pours him two fingers of whiskey.
"Mr. Novak?" Michael clarifies. Dean nods. The older man hums. "I see. He doesn't have a very good opinion of me, then."
Putting down his bagel sandwich, Dean wipes his hands before scrubbing them over his face in frustration. “But I was disrespectful to you.”
“You can be there for him when he messes up. Be there for him when he comes back from those wrong choices. Brother, you can’t prevent him from doin’ anything. Good ol’ Dean’s a free bird. Y’can’t cage him. But when he comes back to the nest....you’ll be there for him.”
to think!” Dean explodes. The guards don’t even glance their way. Surely they’ve seen worse family reunions. Hot with anger, Dean points a finger to his dad. “You weren’t the only one who lost mom! We were just
Feeling warm all over from such a heartfelt speech, Dean drops his gaze as his cheeks burn. Clenching his jaw a few times, he fidgets with the napkin in his lap. "And now… without your wife. Are you happy?"
“I need to know more,” Castiel says, conviction filling his voice. He’s a madman, alone in his apartment, surrounded by printouts and a map tacked up on the wall with red string criss-crossing the length of it. “I need to save Dean Winchester.”
But Michael only smiles a fraction wider, this time showing his teeth for pleasure. “I’m glad you liked it. I ended up missing quite a few pieces, but I can always return.”
Blinking in surprise, Dean’s body language finally relaxes. There’s something like… pride?, shining in his eyes. “Why aren’t you a cop? Or detective?”
Castiel opens his dresser to fish out a fresh pair of boxers. Now that the scent from his own shampoo isn’t clouding his senses, he can smell something delicious in the kitchen. He drops his towel and pulls on his boxers, “I trust you figured out when would be a good time to call him?”
As the door opens to the back step, Castiel’s breath freezes into the chilly night, puffing away towards the nearly burnt out security light. It’s here he finds Dean, huddled up on the step with his too-large leather coat wrapped around him like a moat surrounding a fortress. Rubbing his hand over the back of his neck, Castiel puts the stopper between the door and the jamb, then lets out a sigh as he sits next to Dean on the tiny step. Their body warmth spreads between them, Dean’s right and Castiel’s left. It’s silent for a few minutes, breaths punctuated by little sniffles coming from Dean, coming from where he’s hiding from the world in his jacket.
Castiel’s heart swells and aches all at once. After a moment of consideration, he points to the slightly darker one. Satisfied, Dean carefully applies it to his full lips, blotting with a tissue until none of the color transfers. He turns around on his stool and unties his shoes to pull them off, placing them under the bed and exchanging them for a pair of black pumps.
Elbows on the desk, Castiel cards his fingers through his hair and pulls. He should probably drink some water and eat food that isn’t microwaveable, but he feels like if he stops now he’ll lose his steam and lose track of where he is. It’s easier to work through the aches and pains and complaints of his body than it is to stop and take a break and pick things up again.
"You're real nosy, buddy," Dean says, an edge to his voice. "And before you go making assumptions, I'm not homeless or anything, OK?"
. They watch TV together, play games together, just sit down and hang out and do nothing together. Dean’s reminded of why he’s done so much for his baby bro, no matter what it’s cost him. He falls in love with the stupid kid all over again. Sam had been signed over to Ellen and Bobby’s custody, but they didn’t bother to bring him back to their home when all he really wants is to be with Dean.
exhausted. He slumps a little, leaning against the tiled wall, which isn’t even cool because the temperature of the water is so hot. His temple rests against the wall as well, his eyes closing as he forces himself to take a few deep, calming breaths.
“D’you know how many last nights on earth I’ve had in the past thirty years, man?” Dean asks, his gaze lifting to pierce directly into Castiel’s. Ice freezes over Castiel’s nervous system, sticking him to the uncomfortable chair in a rigid position. “They kinda lose their sparkle after the ninth or tenth spin. The past six years have been the worst. This reset button is nearly impossible to find, but...” That odd, fond glint flashes in his eyes. “I think this time might do the trick.”
Today, on the anniversary of her departure from the world, the sky is overcast but the temperature is warm. The cemetery had been peaceful and quiet, the noise from the outside world muffled by the surrounding trees as he set down a bouquet on Daphne’s eternal resting place, where a marble angel stood watch over her. After taking a walk around the beautiful grounds and regaling Daphne’s spirit with the happenings of the past year, he had veered off to a trail that led into the local protected forest, headed to a spot where he enjoyed watching the river and sitting in the dappled shade.
The room shrinks in size with how fast Castiel’s legs carry him across it. He gets in Michael’s space, their chests and noses nearly touching, Castiel’s voice a low, nearly inaudible growl. “You will leave our home. You will never touch Dean again. You will never contact him, look at him, you will never breathe the same air as him again.”
Dean smiles sheepishly, ducking his head and fidgeting with his water glass. “I was thinkin’ about joining the community dance center.”
Charlie leaves for the day to head back to her place a few cities over to check on her apartment and gather her mail. This leaves Castiel alone with an Enochian printout, an empty apartment, and a dull ringing in his head. Sitting on his couch, he puts on his glasses and stares at the ceiling for a second, hoping to give his eyes some sort of recalibration before he looks at the page.
Castiel’s jaw clenches, the white noise buzzing incessantly for a few seconds before subsiding. A few things start clicking in his head. When he’s sure his head won’t start buzzing again, he says, “You passed your psyche evals.”
to think about. He’d rather have his bubble popped than fall into a slow spiral thinking about how John’s gonna act when he comes home to his boys.
They almost make it into the crater Castiel had left. They fall just south of it, creating a bigger, deeper crater, the archangel landing first, Castiel atop him. The heat from the explosions was so great Castiel’s skin has melted and fused with the material of Michael’s jacket, white feathers sticking to his flesh. He’s dizzy from impact. Michael twitches in his arms, not yet dead, for nothing but an archangel blade can kill an archangel.
Oh. Those words came out much easier, and a lot sooner, than he intended. They surprise Dean as well, his eyes widening and lips parting.
The DJ adjusts the spotlight to swing over towards Dean’s cage, momentarily (and visibly) stunning the dancer. The crowd follows the light, a murmur falling over the crowd as the music fades to silence. Dean looks frozen for a moment, staring out at the crowd and likely realizing the magnitude of him getting up into the cage dressed as beautifully as he is…
?” Dean can’t help the strangled laugh that spills from his mouth. “Come on Sam that guy’s a loser! How did he beat you?”
Hebrew language. Anyway, ‘Angelical’ language was basically a huge secret from the humans because God and his buddies didn’t want the humans to actually know how to interact with them outside of all the prayer hoopla. Like, literally, this dude - ummm, Kelley I think - was like, the sole contributor for the Enochian language and alphabet. He had a buddy who was just as cuckoo and together they were trying to unlock magical worlds or something.” She blows out a sigh, scratching at her jaw. “I was half asleep at this point but I think I still have the web pages pulled up.”
“We shall continue as we have been,” Castiel says easily. “And when we are ready and it is time for more, then we shall have more.”
The bound and gagged man weakly tries to kick at Castiel. Castiel’s big, strong hand snaps out to grab his ankle, breaking it with one mighty, expert twist. A tortured scream gets caught behind the duct tape, Castiel leaning bodily away from his car so the sound doesn’t carry to Dean on the other end of the line.
He's frightfully young, like this. Damn that John Winchester for making Dean grow up too fast. Dean hates being vulnerable, hates showing weakness, to the point that he thinks it's a flaw to be
“If we are in a time loop won’t we also have to alter time itself? Not just our location?” Castiel asks.
four times, even though every time he has politely deferred to his competition. He knows he’s good, but he doesn’t necessarily want to be publicized for his talents. Everything after college has been nearly handed to him, he’s so good at everything he’s ever tried.
Dean’s expression softens a bit, but his eyes are still bright. “It’s not that I believe in things, Cas. It’s that I’ve spent my whole life fighting ‘em.”
Chuckling, Castiel nods at Benny, who disappears into the crowd. Castiel takes over gently holding Dean’s arm, guiding him behind the bar towards a door that leads back to the kitchens. The noise cuts in half and he lets out a little sigh of relief, feeling his bag get heavy again.
He pays for Sam’s extra curricular activities, pays for summer camp, buys school supplies. Dean’s on his own, though, like he doesn’t need any financial help. But the truth is, he doesn’t need help- because he’d dropped out and taken care of everything on his own.
Castiel spends the weekend with a bottle of scotch and so much research spread over his home desk he’s pretty sure he’s responsible for part of the deforestation in South America. After his outburst with Dean Castiel had come home, knocked himself out with some pills, and then woke up with a weird determination to look through all of Dean’s records.
It’s crushing. And it’s something that he’s thought about before, thanks, not like he’s a total idiot about his situation. But thinking about leaving the place that they were once all happy in, where mom and dad were in love and they raised Dean and Sam… Castiel’s right. This place hasn’t been a home since mom died. No matter how hard Dean tries to hold everything together--like that scene in Spiderman where the ferry splits in half and Spiderman webs both sides and tries to hold the halves together and it’s a losing battle because he’s a freaking kid and he can’t possibly save all those lives in such a dire situation--things will never be like they used to. And that won’t change. Not now without John, and certainly not when he’s out of jail.
Still looking confused but sobering up quickly, Sam glanced from me to Cas in quick succession and asked, “You feeling better?”
“I dunno…according to this Tikbalangs are more mischievous than malicious. Some even say they’re guardians of the forest. Not only that, but why would there be one here in the Pacific Northwest?”
Unable to resist exhaustion any longer, I set my chin down on the countertop, let out a long sigh, and concentrated on how wonderful it felt to have my brother so close.
Castiel noticing me at his side, leant down and scratched behind my ears. He shot Dean a disapproving look on my behalf.
Castiel pressed a hand against Claire’s shoulder before heading out to the car. I stayed back to say goodbye. Sam followed me into the front yard and sat back on his haunches as I knelt next to him. Running the palm of my hand along the top of his head I mumbled, “Take it easy on the kibble, okay? Can’t have you getting too soft around the middle.”
? I thought, my face heating up as I stripped down. I threw paranoid glances at him, but he remained facing the other way.
The desire to diffuse the tension with humor had been so great that I hadn’t thought too much about continuing the conversation between us. I realized my blunder as soon as Castiel tensed under my palm and pulled away from me. He definitely hadn't wanted me to hear him.
Eddie was waiting for us at the trailhead with an extra four-wheeler. I breathed an audible sigh of relief when I realized that we weren’t hiking back to the watchtower. He was just finishing hitching a small trailer to the back of his as we walked up, hands getting slick with black oil. When he caught sight of us, he straightened and gave an awkward wave before motioning to our ride.
that I never had to see the seraph ever again,” the Empty said coyly, opening her eyes as she traced circles on the armrest at her side. “I may be willing to release him.”
“I’m seriously glad you’re alive…” Dean whispered thickly, pulling the other tight against his chest and burying his head further in the crook of Cas’ neck.
I was so tired of fighting though. These invisible demons my father instilled to “protect” me from the real ones. Both Sam and Cas were right. I needed to stop setting myself up for failure with such crazy expectations. Not unless I wanted to do more harm.
I looked to Jack who nodded. I looked to Sam and Eileen who nodded. And then I looked at everyone and hollered out, “Buckle up everyone!”
I could see the way his dark brows furrowed over his hauntingly blue eyes that he was upset. Cursing myself quietly, but unable to take back what I said, I dug my keys out of my pocket. I stubbornly avoided looking in his direction and ignored him saying my name.
The boys headed down the main road of Jericho on their horses less than an hour later, keeping their hats tipped low over their eyes. They didn’t want to alert the townsfolk to the fact that they were there looking for someone,
Both wondered about the New Year and what that meant for them and their family as they went back to Dean’s room and got dressed. Neither really knew what to say. That is, until Castiel draped his blazer and trench coat over his forearm and headed toward the door. Dean caught the movement just as he was pulling on his sweat pants and blurted, “Wait!”
I spun wildly in the direction of the voice, but there was nothing there. Only the quiet trees that seemed to close in oppressively all around me.
“He’s a squirrely one!” one of the men hollered, wiping at the fresh cut on his lip that Dean bequeathed him. “That aint normal for an Omega in heat.”
Once inside and situated at one of the lonely booths near the back window, I pulled out my laptop. Might as well get started on the case if we had to wait around. The waitress nervously asked if we wanted to get started with some waters. She was young and seemed new to the job.
Before this thing could sink its claws any further into my insecurities, I clenched my jaw and put four rounds into its chest. The image of my Dad jerked back with every impact. It was a tough sight to swallow. But the fact that it maintained eye contact the entire time was unsettling enough to remind me that it wasn’t real. A bubble of disappointment swelled in my gut as I realized that those bullets had had no effect whatsoever.
My sweat slicked shirt clung to my torso as my chest heaved. I checked the room once again, half expecting it to morph into the forest once more. Cas moved, drawing closer. I flinched. He held up his hands, “You’re safe.”
Sam rolled his eyes, taking off in the direction of the town hotel. Hopefully there was still a room available this late in the day. The pair made their way across the street, avoiding eye contact with each other. Inside, a tired looking man greeted them, blinking heavily lidded eyes.
“What happened, Dean?” Sam asked gently. His hand on my knee startled me but I didn’t brush him off. The warmth from his palm and the lack of judgement in his voice was helping to calm me.
Birds chirped lazily as the morning sun slowly lit up the sky. A thick blanket of fog settled over the damp earth, making the forest feel even deeper than it had before. My ankle ached as I sat staring vacantly through the dense foliage, chin resting on my fist.
When Sam looks across the room to me, I see something in his eyes that I wasn’t expecting in that moment. Apology. Sheepishly, he puts his arms around Eileen’s shoulders and pulls her in to his side as other hunters step up to welcome her. My mouth drops open when I realize why.
He nodded, casting his eyes down at his feet before turning them to me. He was out here avoiding my brother. Both of us knew it.
“Hey, check this out.” Sam called after I’d taken a few bites. “Paper from Whatcom County mentions something about what the locals are calling ‘The North Cascade Vanishings’.”
The first shift of bone under my skin popped sickeningly. I drew in a surprised breath. My clavicle made a crunching sound next, like someone tearing the husk off of corn, as it collapsed. I started losing count of the number of sounds I heard. All I could do was shut my eyes and hope it would stop soon.
Cas nodded in satisfaction, reaching down and gently shaking Helena by the shoulders. She came awake with a start and a sharp intake of air. I stood and explained, “We should get some sleep.”
Looking over at Sam who was diligently setting up a tent in the small corner of Gorge Lake Campground on the far western side of Diablo, I  tried putting a positive spin on our situation. When was the last time we’d gone out and dug our hands into the dirt a little?
Giving her arm one last squeeze, I nodded in appreciation and backed off. The shaking that had been plaguing her hands before lessened as she gathered up her supplies again. She asked us to follow her into the morgue (a more sterile environment) with Sam. Gingerly, I picked him up. He didn’t open his eyes. A pang of worry shot through me, but I shoved it down. There wasn’t enough time to act like that now.
“I’m here, Dean.” Castiel answered, gripping Dean’s shoulder above the mark that he had left so many years ago.
Placing the girl back on the metal slab, Helena went back to the x-rays and produced two and explained feverishly, “Her doctor sent these over; they’re from a bike accident she had two years ago.”
A solid knock on the door startled me out of my trance. I looked up just as Helena stood and moved to open it. It was Ivan. He looked tired but glad that the crazy ordeal seemed to be over. Helena gathered him up in a sudden hug, squeezing him tightly and burying her face in his shoulder. A deep red blush colored his entire face, making him look like a school boy. A wild departure from the normally uptight officer of the law.
“Yeah…just a bad dream.” I answered, not intentionally wanting to sound unsure, but it came out that way. Trying to cover the fact that I, Dean Winchester had been rattled by a nightmare, laughed shakily, “We gotta stop bonding over barf.”
The party went on for hours. None of them could remember getting Thanos-snapped out of existence which was good. Sam filled them in on how we took down Chuck, only adding to our legendary clout. I didn’t say a whole lot. Just listened to the other stories being told and watched as everyone got drunk around me as I sucked on ice cubes.
It was here that Sam noted a strange feeling growing. It was like sitting next to a fire on a hot summer night, but more intense and came from deep in the center of his being. He’d never felt anything like it before. His thoughts began to jumble, making everything feel like he was watching from over his own shoulder as they happened. His hand shot out and found Constance’s throat and squeezed, catching her just as she was about to bring both her fists down on his head. She choked; surprised.
Castiel's familiar greeting was more than welcome after what went down just a few minutes ago. Tilting the phone from my mouth for a moment so he couldn't hear, I let out a long sigh and said, "Cas, man, it's good to hear from you."
I pulled away from him, trying to get some distance. But his arm trapped me against his side. After a moment, the mattress shifted and my heart doubled its pace. His chest pressed against my back as he re-secured his arm. His hand gripped my shoulder above the mark he’d left pulling me out of Hell and mumbled into my ear thoughtfully, “We have not wandered the same paths, but I think there is understanding between us.”
“I’m sorry,” a feminine voice said shakily from my blind side. I threw out my arm and caught nothing but air. “It won’t hurt for long.”
The angel felt clumsy. He kept getting distracted by every noise and movement that the hunter clutching onto him was making. He knew exactly what to do with the green-eyed hunter. He had witnessed thousands of years of fornication of all kinds. The problem was that it was Dean. Everything he did was unique and new.
“Now listen here: people are in danger. Two innocent kids are missing, possibly dead. And they have nothing to do with your Company Town politics. If you want to continue on your crusade later, that’s perfectly fine, but right now we need to ask you some questions.”
Once inside, he set Dean down and guided his head back onto the pillow. Soft snores rose up as Castiel stepped away, studying him. He looked younger, less troubled when he slept. The angel liked seeing him like this.
Sounding as nonchalant as he could, he called over his shoulder, “Oh, yeah, just hunting buffalo. I’m riding out with Dean to bring him back…”
The strength and cheer that had been fueling my facial expression before seeped away quickly. He didn’t comment. Didn’t say anything really, just stared at me. Like he already knew what I was going to say; what I was thinking. It twisted my insides. Pursing my lips, I turned my body away from him unconsciously. Or consciously. Who the hell knew? Rubbing at my jaw with my free hand I glanced to the angel to see if he’d noticed my weird behavior.
There were still more images left on the table, but the ones displayed looked strange. Squinting slightly at the x-ray of the pelvic area I asked, “Is that a –”
Blood. Blood everywhere. Splashed across the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Every surface of the sitting room was drenched in red. As the doors yawned open, the smell intensified, hitting him like a blow to the face. Sam pressed his hand to his nose instinctively, but the scent was already burned into his olfactory senses. Staggering forward, his boots slipping along the wood, Sam found that he could not tear his eyes away from the horror that was the far western wall. Every square inch was covered in dismembered body parts that had been nailed in a sickeningly beautiful pattern around the fireplace.
His shoulders tensed for a moment before he stepped back and motioned silently for me to go inside. The living room dining room and kitchen were all part of one 20x10ft box. Very open concept. If a little cramped. Floyd brushed by asking quietly if I wanted something to drink and motioned for me to take a seat on the dated ‘70s couch. It smelled faintly of mothballs and pot roast.
She paused long and hard. It was unusual since she was normally such a chatter box. Finally, she said, “Got a monster ain’t never been seen before. No one I’ve asked is willin’ to help. You’re the only one I got left.”
It was my first solo case without Dad. The one he let me go on just before he went missing and I went to go get Sam from Stanford. I got wind of a witch doctor that was using hoodoo on tourists. Long story short, he’d get their money and then kill them using some pretty nasty magic. Halfway through the case, I ended up running into Maxine. The witch doctor had killed her aunt and she was looking for revenge. She of course wouldn’t sit on the bench like I politely asked her to, and ended up tagging along.
As I stepped over the threshold into the oppressive nothing, I took in a deep, steadying breath and then sprinted forward. After a minute or so I stopped and hollered out, “I wanna talk!”
“They wanted someone to get a head start on the search, see if it was people getting lost or if it’s just a work abandonment thing.” Sam answered quickly.
Following his lead, I took out Sam’s from my duffel bag and called over to the slightly pale looking mortician, “You should get some rest too.”
AN: I tried indenting the first few chapters and I have quickly realized how annoying that is to code, so I am abandoning that! Hope it doesn't ruin any immersion.
“No, haven’t had good enough reception for a while. And the WiFi here sucks. She still has one of the bodies though. And the collars are in evidence lockup at Ashland PD.”
I thought sadly as I reached out with my hearing for any signs of where people were. The house was quiet.
Sam’s head whipped around to give Dean a horrified look. Dean couldn’t meet his gaze. Instead he called dangerously through gritted teeth, “Just try it, assholes.”
I believed him, but I still felt slightly responsible. I mean, how did the witch even get the drop on me? I thought I checked my surroundings before helping Maggie.
Sam stood watching, face blank. Dean glanced at him warily, wondering if it had been his imagination - the power that had come off of his brother. Eventually the older of the two muttered something and went off to retrieve their horses.
“Yes,” Jack nodded, pressing a hand to the spot over his heart. “We’re in balance and she’s happy with that.”
We weren’t going to get much else from Mr. Waithe. I shot Sam a look and saw that he was thinking the same thing. Keeping his voice soft Sam asked, “Can we speak with your wife?”
Taking in a deep, shuddering breath, I started slowly, “Billie had us cornered in the storage room behind some warding. I really thought we were done for. But Cas…Cas made a deal with the Empty. Before. To save Jack.”
It felt like Dean’s stomach collapsed into itself and dropped out of his body. He didn’t want to think it was true.  Omegas went into heat about once every three months, regardless of whether or not they were mated. Pheromones were released that affected Alphas and Betas (more so Alphas) and an Omegas body would grow weak and sensitive.
At this his face melted seamlessly into a blank stare, giving me nothing. In that second, I was unexpectedly transported back to the woods, staring at the monster demanding I tell the fake Castiel my deepest darkest secret. My anxiety and doubts were choking the voice from my throat. A vision of Cas gurgling on his own blood, superimposed itself over the real one. I blinked, trying to get it to clear, but it was no use.
Dean opened his mouth and nothing came out, at a loss for words. He gave Castiel a very pointed look in the hopes that he would pipe in and be a little more helpful. Glancing up from me and noticing, Cas shrugged, “With Sam the way he is, we could use the extra hand. Druidic magic is more unpredictable than witchcraft.”
The pair dismounted quickly after that. Sam resisted the urge to offer help and instead said, “Why don’t I go find some wood for a fire? You get camp set up.”
“Thanks again, Jodie.” I said, electing to move the conversation on. “I owe you one. Sam and I both do.”
Her fingers dug into my windpipe and I felt my vision begin to spot. I tried hitting her and breaking free, but it was no use. Dimly I wondered if getting killed in the Empty meant I would end up here too.
Not satisfied with Dean’s lack of reaction, the Sherriff’s eyes flashed dangerously. He shot his Deputy a pointed look just before lunging forward. In an instant both Dean’s wrists had been snatched by the pair and locked in handcuffs. His arms were wrenched up and the other end of both handcuffs were secured on the bars above his head.
My mouth fell open when I realized I was hearing my Dad’s voice from the night I’d never forget. Caught off guard, I dropped my gun slightly and glanced around. Nothing. Only the RV’s, Baby, and Sam’s tent.
She seemed to want to say more, but couldn’t quite figure out how to say it. I could tell though that she was eager for this whole thing to be over and done with so she could get back to her quiet life of cutting up normal dead people.
The lawmen pressed Dean for answers for what felt like hours before the other Deputy from earlier came bursting into the jail. He was breathing hard like he’d been running.
Just as he was making a move to step toward me, Maggie let out a loud yelp from the next room, clearly panicking at discovering herself in a new environment. He gave me a regretful look before turning back to help Helena with calming her down. I let out a subtle breath and thanked the universe for small graces.
Castiel couldn’t think. He let his vessel’s natural instincts kick in as his desire blossomed like a flame. This time he was the one to initiate the kiss. Dean’s hips gyrated, rutting against the solid form of the angel. Their breathing became labored; hot and wanting. Castiel lifted himself enough to angle away from Dean, leaving room for him to run his palm greedily down Dean’s taught chest toward his belt.
Her face twisted in agony as tears slid down her cheeks and she said thickly, “Carly was my roommate my junior year…”
There was a brief pause before fingers touched the leather around my neck. As soon as they started fiddling with it, I felt a pulse of power. Helena recoiled with a yelp of pain. I opened my eyes to see Castiel and Dean at her side, looking in horror down at her hands and me on the counter.
"Damnit!" I grumbled in frustration, kicking at a moss-covered log. The rotting  bark crumbled apart, pieces scattering everywhere. "What do we do now?"
Blinking, Dean tried to do as much, but found that his boots were like cement blocks strapped to his feet. It ended up making the trek across the ice-slick parking lot that much more difficult. Sam grumbled in annoyance, securing fistfuls of his brother’s jacket as he heaved him along, careful to avoid patches of slick snow. The pair staggered up to the Impala just as Dean started complaining about not wanting to leave.
A hand shoots out and grabs Castiel by the front of his shirt, yanking him into an alleyway. Reflexively tightening his grip on the items in hand so he doesn’t spill them, a surprised breath gusts out of his mouth as he’s pinned up against a brick wall. The man in front of him is wearing a three-piece suit and looks like any other professional on their way to work this morning, his hair coal black and his eyes a startling shade of blue.
“Come to my first performance,” Dean says decisively. He isn’t even on the team yet, but there’s a promised determination in his eyes.
Castiel lets out a soft chuckle before shifting his grip so he can haul Dean up with him when he stands. Dean’s still a little unsteady on his feet. Castiel tucks him under his shoulder and says, “We’ll come out for your stuff later.”
She stood, nervously smoothing her pencil skirt as she took off at a quick trot down the left hallway. Normally I would appreciate the sway of her hips as she hurried along, but my mind was about five miles to the west wondering if Cas was doing alright.
Once the sun had come up enough to disperse the mist, we headed back to the bar. The owner seemed surprised to see us considering we left so late last night, but didn’t linger on the thought too long. He asked gruffly what we wanted for breakfast and quickly shuffled off to start on the order. Holding the mug of coffee up to my forehead I let the warm porcelain sooth away the stiffness I’d been carrying around like a cloud over my head. I nursed the scalding liquid and continued to meditate on the blissful silence that had finally settled into my mind.
Castiel nodded absently, tugging Dean to his feet. The two sober ones ignored the nonsensical mutterings of the blonde between them and concentrated on getting inside as quickly as possible. Luckily there was no vomiting or falling. Once down the stairs, Sam helped guide Dean’s limp body into one of the library chairs. He groaned and put his head on his arms.
My anger and fear manifested as a low growl deep in my chest. If I could actually move, I would use my new mouth to bite the shit out of their leg. The witch seemed to understand my meaning and gave me a wide berth as they hurried to the back door and slipped outside. The brief blinding flash of light made me flinch away.
The eye without blood in it fluttered open. I was close to the ground. Everything around me looked twice as big as it had minutes ago. Confused, I struggled to look down at my body. My clothes lay draped over my shoulders, looking as big as a blanket. Despite still feeling like there was pins and needles under my skin I wriggled free. What I saw had me whining pitifully all over again. Fur. The same color as my hair covered my entire body. Well, if I could even say it was my body anymore.
“Okay…anything else you can tell me? Do you remember seeing the others acting up before they disappeared?” I asked before taking a gulp of my delicious coffee.
“Isadora.” Taking in a shuddering breath, she turned to glance over her shoulder at the young people huddled together by the tower, and mumbled, “Started hearin’ screams around one this mornin’. Woke me up. Sounded close, so I started hollerin’, tellin’ ‘em to come in the direction of my search light if they could see it.”
“If you take the angel, eventually he’ll end up back here.” She groaned. “Doesn’t matter how long angels live, they all do. But he is
Sam raised his brow at my exclamation but ultimately ignored my comment. Instead, as I moved to start filling up the tank, he tugged out a notebook that he’d been scribbling in while we drove. Slapping it on the top of Baby he started, “I think we should hit up Floyd Rees’ place first seeing as how he’s the only eye witness so far that thinks something’s wrong. We need more information about what's going on.”
“Okay…” Dean coughed, turning so Castiel wouldn’t see the splotchy heat spreading from his cheeks down his neck.
There was nothing I could say that could comfort him. So, I settled with resting a heavy hand on his shoulder in solidarity. Meeting my gaze unflinchingly after a moment he said, “I hope you find whoever is responsible for this.”
Castiel explained to Maggie that we weren’t the bad guys and that she was safe now. Sam tried communicating with her too, but didn’t seem to be having much luck. It took a while but eventually she calmed down. Well…as much as one could after getting told you were stuck as a dog for the time being.
Smiling softly, Castiel nods and takes a sip of his coffee. “I can only imagine. But Bobby and Ellen are taking care of Sam now, so… what
“Yeah,” Dean chews his lower lip, then relaxes back against the pillows, staring up at the ceiling. “Are you gonna get in trouble?”
. When the man stands from the rubble the camera has a clear view of the massive wings spread behind him, and then in the next instant, he’s gone.
“Ok, so,” Charlie plops down in a chair in front of her computer, typing and clicking away. “When she was announced as Dean’s lawyer the dark web went all abuzz. I had no idea why, until I started scanning through encrypted messages.”
A few moments later, he’s still in the same position when he hears Dean come out of his bedroom. He doesn’t take his eyes off the ceiling, but he hopes that Dean will continue the conversation. “Dean-”
"I know we did things the wrong way," Dean finally says, "and I'm sorry if you get in trouble. But I wouldn't change anything about it." Shining eyes look towards him. "I… I really did feel safe, Cas. I got to dance, and I got to be… me. So, I'm sorry that you might get reamed, but I'm also- y'know- thank...ful. God, that sounds shitty."
Swallowing thickly, Dean continues to hide his hands in his lap so the trembling isn't noticeable. "So it was just me."
Heaping their wet clothes on Dean's waiting arms, Castiel chuckles as the young man tries not to wobble with the wet weight. Dean just offers a cheeky grin and turns to go to the laundry room, disappearing as he starts singing "Purple Rain" loudly and off-key. Castiel grabs two towels from the linen closet and dries his feet and legs before moving into the kitchen. He sets the unused, fluffy towel down on the island and then uses the other to ruffle his hair as he makes his way to the stove.
They both stand up, the conversation drawing to a natural close. Before Dean can leave Castiel calls his attention, a soft, nearly paternal smile on his features.
Sam rolls his eyes. “We’re in a safe house. I managed to set this one up last week and so far no one knows it’s here.”
Dean closes his eyes. “Better get outta here before Bobby n’ Ellen show up. They’ll wonder why an old man is checking in on me.”
The car ride to the hospital is a blur. John is speeding, surely, but also Dean’s just… hazy. Aside from holding his brother to him he doesn’t really register anything else going on. His mom is in the hospital. She had a stroke. She could die.
A boy’s vision of his mother is truly something unique. All of his life, Dean’s been a mama’s boy, despite doing his best to impress his father at any turn. When it came down to it he loved curling up with her, loved spending time with her, talking to her. She knew everything about him- his preferences, his thoughts, his secrets. There is not a single person in this universe who understands Dean as well as his mother, not a single person that he could ever let his guard down so freely with.
The way Castiel explains it, like the grass is green and cows moo, strikes Dean as odd. Neat, but odd. Also refreshing. He doesn't beat around the bush.
Clearing his throat, Dean sits at the coffee table. “I, uh. Wanna thank you for lettin’ me stay here last night.”
"I have special stages, large enough to fit one person. They are fitted with cages and guarded at all times. There, my dancers entertain and perform for tips. Unfortunately I just lost a dancer. She graduated university and is moving cross country to start a doctorate program. I was thinking about putting out an ad, but I was afraid only the wrong type of people would apply."
They both shift so they can watch the events unfold on the screen. Castiel walks into frame at the mouth of the alley, and the stranger seems to materialize out of nowhere before immediately pushing Castiel up against the wall. Charlie pauses the video, and they both stare at the screen.
Lowering his chin, he regards Dean for half a second before he needs to close his eyes against the onslaught. A little groan leaves his lips without permission. He puts his elbows on the table, slides his fingers into his hair so his palms are on his forehead, and then clenches his jaw a few times before speaking.
“Cautiously. I told him what’s past is past, and at the time he seemed to agree. Now it’s clear he feels differently.”
. The highway is about three miles from this remote spot in the woods, he could make it. Cardio wasn’t his thing in high school but right now he feels like he could run halfway across the world with the way his blood is rushing through his body.
“It fits why she would pick a name like Woman in White as her calling card. And the date of their drowning is close to when she threw herself in the river.”
In the light of the early morning, Sam peered down at the map in his lap and pointed, “Here’s where Pa went. Blackwater Ridge, Colorado.”
He searched my face for a moment, silently looking for something. Eventually he nodded and started slowly, “I’m…I’m in everything now. Every drop of rain, every spec of dust. I saw the way those people looked at me back there. They’re all counting on me now.”
“Cas…” Dean breathed, the hand that had tugged on the angel’s coat sliding up and around, pressing him closer.
“You said in your statement that Mr. Darrah had been acting strangely before taking off into the woods. What made it strange?”
“Shut up!” Gertie lashed out with one of her hands, a burst of flames arching across the distance between them.
Understanding where her head was at, I said, “Yes you can. You’ve dealt with crazy shit like this before.”
Looking me over, he took a moment to make his mind up about me. When he came to a conclusion, he glanced regrettably at his brother before standing and motioning for me to step away with him. Once we were out of earshot he chewed once more at his already slightly bleeding nail and asked, “What do you need to know?”
Sure enough, as I looked up, I saw the sheer joy on his face. Grinning from ear to ear he thanked her for the compliments and said that we had to be on our way. As we left, Dean stuffed his hands into his pockets and commented wryly, “Dude, I had no idea that having a dog would be such a good way to pick up chicks.”
“There abouts,” I could hear the smile in her voice as she let out a breath of relief. “Listen, I’m callin’ in that favor you owe me.”
Glancing at me out of the corner of his eye, he said, “I think we’re dealing with a druid, not a witch. A number of families came out of Ireland after the death of Christ and went south.”
I gasped and gazed confused at my dead brother’s corpse now staring up at me with cloudy, expressionless eyes. His purple lips parted again as he whispered, “
As soon as the words left my mouth I remembered. I’d been tinkering with something in the garage and then felt a sharp pain in my head. Next thing I knew I was here. It was almost funny how boring of a way to go it was.
The younger Winchester thought about stopping him. Dean was an Omega after all. If anyone figured that out like that prostitute had, they’d haul him off. His instincts were telling him to follow his brother. But his head was urging him to get to business; the faster he found John Winchester, the faster he could get back to Stanford and Jessica.
Dean whirled, going to his brother’s side. Pointing out the names and the article, Sam continued, “You said Constance’s husband said she killed herself after something bad happened, right?”
“Never realized there was more than one type of green.” I commented, mostly to myself, but Sam smiled as he looked out the window.
“Seems that the shifting has stopped.” She commented, releasing her fingers from prodding my hip bones. Tugging her stethoscope from the bag at her feet she popped them into her ears and pressed it to my side. “Respiration is good.”
It was getting harder to keep my eyes open. My body had become numb except for the creeping cold. He gripped my chin, forcing me to look into the pitch black of his eyes. I groaned as he whispered, “
“Don’t breathe a word of this to anyone, if you know what’s good for you.” Cas growled, wiping the evidence away with his free hand.
He turned to give Dean a sly look when he noticed Dean hadn’t even noticed they were in. Sam snagged the back of Dean’s collar and dragged him into the room, shutting them in quickly. Dean tugged himself free, shooting Sam a dirty look before the pair looked around in awe at the collage of newspaper clippings and wanted posters on the wall. It was similar to what Dean had been carrying around in his saddlebag, but greater in scope.
The younger Winchester watched Dean struggle into his saddle, concern flashing across his face before he said, “Right…I found out where Joseph Welch lives and went to talk to him while you were
, I thought to myself. “Cas is waiting outside. Figured we can come up with a plan and then roll out.”
Instantly I regretted doing that. As I looked up into Cas’ face, I could see the hurt and confusion flit briefly through eyes that looked even more blue in this light. Unable to stand whatever it was that was going on at this moment, I shot to my feet and started walking down the embankment.
“Yup. Stroke.” Bobby answered, popping the top of his drink and taking a long sip. “Not the stupidest way you could have gone, that’s for sure.”
Sam wondered if he should tell Dean about his intentions with Jessica as they made their way on foot through the city. They were brothers after all. Dean would probably be excited that he was going to start his own pack. But for whatever reason Sam couldn’t bring himself to speak.
She softened when he used her nickname, only a trace of skepticism remaining in the corner of her slightly pursed lips before even that melted away, transforming into a smile. As she draped her arms up and over Sam’s shoulders, pressing her body against his boldly, Sam noticed the flush of drink on her cheeks. Leaning in as she tugged him closer to her level, she whispered into his ear, “Care to escort an Omega home?”
“Gertie Fraiser, thirty-seven, works as a seamstress for a number of theaters in town.” Ivan answered with a small huff. “Two of which are the Cabaret and Allen Elizabethan Theaters where the victims disappeared from.”
The Winchesters hadn’t mentioned anything about last night at all. Sam steered clear of the campsite for a good two hours before coming back as loudly as he dared with an armful of firewood. He found Dean curled up on his bedroll pretending to be asleep. But he could see the fresh sheen of sweat shimmering in the moonlight on his brow. Clearing his throat quietly, Sam set about getting ready to sleep too.
"You'd be surprised," she answered. "Inexperienced hikers come out here pretty often thinkin' they can handle the wild without a guide or the proper equipment. More often than not I spend my days trackin' down those who've gone and gotten themselves hurt or lost."
She didn’t even bother scenting him, or commenting on the fact that he was being improper by not giving her his full name. She seemed dazed. Noticing this, another young woman strode over protectively and growled at Sam. Trying not to anger her he made his neck even more accessible and said, “I was hoping you wouldn’t mind me asking a couple questions.”
With a long sigh, Sam rested his chin back between his paws and closed his eyes. Quietly, I stood and headed into the kitchen where Castiel and Helena stood around the counter. She had just pulled her laptop out and slid it over.
Pausing, Castiel processed Dean’s words and noted the way he wouldn’t quite meet his gaze. Dean was used to being in charge, being sure. But now he was showing his underbelly, his weakness. And Cas realized what an honor it was.
We spent every second at the bar pouring over any and all lore we could get our hands on. And what we couldn’t get through, Sam was able to copy and paste onto his phone for when we next had free time and no Wi-Fi.
Gentle fingers probed the fur covered in blood, pushing it apart to reveal the skin underneath. As she worked, she narrated shakily, “Looks like he’s – he’s got a contusion on the back of his skull with a – a superficial abrasion. This cut above his eye is pretty deep. I’ll have to stitch it up.”
I passed by them and a dozen other bodies on my way to my room. Miracle trotted next to me, tongue lolling out of the side of his mouth as he panted. All my mind had time for was getting everything we would need together. I went to my dresser and started rummaging through the drawers.
It couldn’t taunt me into getting upset. I’d grown up fighting monsters, nothing could get under my skin.
I was. Of course, I was. Cas was in heaven and his family was all down here. But he wasn’t trapped in the Empty, doomed to relive his deepest regrets over and over again anymore.
His attention was making me feel claustrophobic. But it still didn’t stop his words from making me feel…important. Something I wasn’t used to having outside of Sammy. Maybe it was the drink, or the fact that I’d just gone through my own personal hell. Maybe a little of both, but I suddenly felt the walls that I’d worked so hard to hold up all day crumbling down. Letting out a shaky breath, I ran my ands through my hair and allowed my eyes to fill with tears. Looking even more worried, Cas dragged his chair closer and pressed his palm firmly onto my shoulder like he always did. I leant into the familiar strength his silent touch offered me.
My eyes had adjusted even better in the dark, despite not being able to see the green color of the exit light anymore. I caught sight of tall shelves filled with random equipment lining the far wall. With every last ounce of energy I had left, I limped into the darkness. I found a space big enough to shove my small body on the lowest shelf. God it hurt. My skin and bones were still raw from the transformation. Any contact felt like someone prodding a barely scabbed over wound. But once I was still, my eyes closed and I let my head fall down.
Castiel groaned, long and low. When he opened his eyes, he was unfortunate enough to meet the gaze of the other person in the room. The other Alpha’s condescending gaze further narrowed smugly on Cas’
I was shaking my head in denial. I didn’t like this. But that didn’t mean it wasn’t true. Looking at the kid, I felt my throat constrict. He wasn’t just Jack anymore. He was everything.
As soon as Sam looked at the entry in the journal, the younger Winchester formed a plan. Waiting a few minutes, he cleared his throat and called, “I can’t really see what I need to to uh, find out where this goes. You – you mind if we stop and make a fire?”
We worked for hours. It wasn’t complicated. Mostly duct taping a bunch of stuff together onto carts and backpacks. Lastly, I strapped a couple speakers onto Baby’s roof (after a quiet apology to her). With Charlie’s help, she was able to get my cassette to play on a loop after some clever B side recording and blast out of said speakers. We all stood in the garage where all the cars were parked and tricked out to the nines with anything and everything.
I was also thankful that Sam had reminded me back at the campsite to bring along my jacket. Despite being in the full swing of spring, I could once again feel the bite of the cold coming down off the mountain tops. In fact, I could see misty clouds gathering up there now, threatening a storm. Who knew if it would happen, knowing how unpredictable the area was. The curse of Washington was that if it wasn’t raining, it was threatening to. I’d only ever seen a handful of clear days and that was over on the Spokane side to the east in the dead of summer.
Mary looks at Dean, surprised, though there’s a glint of pride in her eyes. “I will make sure he spends that time reflecting on his actions.” She looks towards the principal, standing up and holding out her hand. “Thank you, sir. Come on, Dean.”
“I don’t-” he clears his throat. “I don’t know what happened.” He looks at her, feeling heavy for himself and for this stranger. “How long have you been here?”
The man gets up and charges Castiel, swinging with his fist. Castiel has never been in a fight before in his life, but he lifts an arm to block the punch, feet dancing to parry. The man’s fists hit like iron, but Castiel blocks like steel, something like instinct guiding his hands to start returning the blows. The sidewalk cracks beneath their feet. More lights burst. When the man lands a punch on Castiel’s jaw it sends a wave of energy out into the street, overturning a car. When Castiel kicks him square in the chest and sends him into a building, the bricks break and crumble around him, burying him in plaster. Staring in shock, Castiel looks at his fists, looks at the people fleeing from the scene, and then takes a step back when the man stands from the rubble, nary a hair out of place on his handsome head.
Perhaps, he thinks, it’s because their trauma had been laid out so clearly for the other to see. That open feeling of vulnerability without the accompanying anxiety with it actually feels… fairly nice. Castiel often hesitates in telling people about his wife and child. The looks of pity tend to be a bit too much. When he’d briefly donned the white collar in his father’s footsteps immediately after Daphne’s death, he found peace in being the one people confessed to, and not the one people wanted to hear confessions from. But that became burdensome, and when he realized what he wanted to do to honor Daphne’s death, he removed the collar and replaced it with something more colorful, instead. He hasn’t looked back since, but he still finds comfort in lending someone his ear when they need it.
Kevin’s house is neat and orderly. His mom fusses over Dean for just a few moments, but when Dean explains he’s on the wrestling team, she just grumbles about boys too aggressive for their own good. She preens about Kevin being in band and suggests Dean also join, seeing as it’s less violent and more rewarding, to which he awkwardly chuckles and says he’ll think about it.
“Cas –” I started wearily before I was cut off by a soft growl. Looking down, I noticed Sam. He’d slipped in without anyone noticing.
I watched uneasily as Helena shakily tended to my brother. All the while my mind raced. I wondered what kind of spell could not only transmute a living human into an animal, but also scramble an angel’s powers. Seems Cas had the same thoughts as he came up by my side.
As Dean (who had looped back to loiter outside the border house awkwardly) stepped into the room. He too froze in horror. The sight was something that he had never seen personally, but had heard plenty about. It was exactly what John Winchester had described to him over and over again growing up. Nearly identical to what happened to Mary Winchester. All Dean could think about as he gaped in shock, was that this was what their Pa said Mama had looked like pinned to the ceiling of their homestead in Kansas.
I pushed us apart abruptly, but kept him near enough so I could take in how wonderful it was to look at him up close again. Same innocent head tilt, same scruff on his jaw, same blue eyes and full lips that had haunted dream after dream.
“You seriously don’t expect us to sit by and watch you go in there by yourself.” Claire scoffed, shooting to her feet. Kaia followed her, curling her fingers into the back of her shirt.
, Dean thought, still unwilling to uncover his eyes. Tugging at the fabric of Cas’ pants in annoyance he grumbled, “Take these off.”
“Everything is going to be alright.” he murmured, lips dragging across her skin slightly as he spoke. “I’ll be back. I promise.”
Taking the reins and swinging up into his saddle, the taller of the two muttered, “We got work to do.”
I straightened in my seat and gave him my attention as he started, “Okay, so according to Filipino folklore there’s something called a Tikbalang.”
The rustling grew louder alongside the sound of my heart pumping blood in my ears. Sam glanced at me, shifting from foot to foot in agitation as we waited. Unexpectedly, what jumped out from the bushes wasn't a monster or anything. A deep ginger puff ball streaked out. A fox.
“We fucked up,” Sam says, squeezing Castiel’s shoulders. “We all did. But this is it, Cas. Can you wait for a full explanation until we’re done?”
“You were having a… nightmare?” she guesses, stepping closer once it seems like Castiel has his bearings. “Are you alright? That was super freaky. Your eyes were all rolled back and you were twitching.”
Dropping his chin and feeling his neck protest at the sudden movement, Castiel looks over at Dean, who has a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and his eyes on the ground. “Dean, I’m sorry-”
at this turn of events. Serial killer Dean Winchester, most famous man currently alive, volatile and bloody down to his core… is discussing particle science with an investigative journalist in a locked, secluded room in a maximum security prison. Swallowing thickly, Castiel’s brain finally catches up with Dean’s words, and he nods.
She settles back down into her makeshift bed. Both of them have small, tired smiles on their faces as the quiet takes over once again. He sets the bar aside for later, then also shifts on the seats until he can lie on his side curled up, using his arm as a pillow and closing his eyes.
“We don’t have a lot of time if the God squad is up your ass already,” Dean says. He licks his lips, then sits forward in his seat again, catching Castiel’s eye. “Do you trust me?”
Gasping, Castiel jerks out of his stupor. Water, cold water, sloshes around him and spills out of the bathtub. The washcloth falls from his eyes and the ringing in his ears subsides enough for him to hear Charlie knocking on the door, calling out to him from the other side - but her words sound muffled, like she’s trying to talk through a brick wall instead of a flimsy door. His eyes open and he could swear he sees white-hot fire escaping from his own lashes- he lifts his hands, digging the heels of his palms into his eyes, his breath coming out in stuttered gasps.
“Oh my God I- I thought-” Dean stands up jerkily, like he doesn’t know how to use his limbs. “I’m sorry, I thought you-”
He excuses himself halfway through under the guise of getting more alcohol. Nobody at present needs more, but the bottles are empty, and he needs an excuse to leave the noisy apartment.  A man cuts ahead of him in line at the liquor store, shooting Castiel a snooty look and putting some large bills on the counter for “the good stuff”.
Feeling his heart tug for the hundredth time tonight, Castiel settles down. He lies on his side, facing Dean, contemplating how he looks during total and complete rest; his smooth brow, soft eyes. Not a single line of worry. He wants to reach out and touch him so badly he nearly shakes with it. Instead he draws the blankets up under his chin, snuggles down, and closes his eyes.
A few days before Christmas, Castiel comes home from a late night at the bar. He’d been arguing with local police about whether or not some people could sleep in his breezeway and ultimately, when he couldn’t convince the cops, he let the people into a side area, which is fenced off and meant for outdoor diners. He’d set everyone up with containers of hot soup, made sure everyone had weather-appropriate gear, and then promised he’d be back early in the morning to get them breakfast and send them on their way. The cops can’t tell him what to do with the property he owns, but if he has to usher people where they’re not seen, he’s happy to.
“That’s wonderful,” Castiel says honestly. He picks up a bagel half, taking a careful bite. “Who are you going with?” He tries to sound as nonchalant as possible.
WIth a flash and a bang, Michael disappears in a gravity-pulling whoosh, Castiel stumbling until he falls to the ground. His head feels like it’s splitting down the middle, agonizing pain searing through his nervous system. He can’t even make a sound, his body curling in on itself like a spider that’s been stepped on, his fingers and toes twitching.
Dean closes his eyes. Shame prickles behind his eyes, knowing that Sammy found out about the unsavory things Dean had been up to overnight to pay the bills. “Dancing here is different than bein’ in a strip club, y’know. I don’t take my clothes off.”
They don’t say it outright, of course. But Castiel is smart, and through their stilted conversations and the remnants of his own memories… he knows he died.
“About…?” Charlie’s voice is concerned as she finishes doing whatever she’d been occupied with. She stands next to Castiel, putting a hand on his bicep.
Swallowing, Castiel lets out a little sigh and gives up on his book. He puts in the bookmark, then sets it aside on the table. “I… haven’t celebrated the holidays since Daphne died.”
“And cut your suffering short? Never.” Dean ruffles his hair more affectionately this time, then manages to wrangle together everyone’s order. When he wanders away from the table to put the order into the kitchen, Charlie intercepts him by grabbing the tail of his apron and untying it as he walks, the fabric and all the contents of his pockets spilling to the floor with a clatter. “Damn it Charles!” Dean stumbles to make sure he doesn’t step on anything, pulling the hand towel out of his pocket whip-quick to snap it out at Charlie’s thigh.
soldier, Castiel. A great leader. Our disappointment runs deep, but we have been trying to correct your actions.” The man looks Castiel up and down. “And yet every time you only manage to fall further. Your attachment to that
Squeezing his hand, Dean turns to face his brother, putting both hands on his shoulders and trying to send him a reassuring smile. “We don’t have to.”
“Gotta say,” Dean says, looking around the next corner, “never envisioned you with a gun. S’pretty hot.”
Shrugging again, Dean sighs. “They never really were high on my priority list. Birthdays were never a big deal in my family, even when we were all together.”
Castiel lifts up his glass of orange juice to hide his smile. “Like you’re heading to your graduation ceremony.”
“You’re right about that,” Benny reaches out, placing his hand gently on Castiel’s wrist. He forces eye contact, his eyes kind and smile warm. “But you know what you can do?”
to be what Dean is talking about. Standing up, Castiel gathers everything, pocketing his recorder. His eyes throb. His shoulders ache.
“Is there, um,” Kevin’s still blushing a little. “Do other- I mean I’m being nosy but I’m…  curious. Does other stuff make you feel good? Like makeup does?”
Huffing, hating that his brain is being so active this early in the morning (he blames it on the awesome night’s sleep he got), he stands up and stretches until he hears his back crack. He’s wearing pj pants and a long-sleeved tee, for once having been in the perfect temperature zone to fall asleep comfortable. The window is cracked, the blankets are the perfect weight.
The trunk opens. Michael lies in it, gagged and bound, a plastic tarp spread under him to prevent… anything… from staining the carpet lining. Castiel hadn’t scared him in their living room but now he looks absolutely terrified. Not a bit of hair is out of place, there aren’t any visible marks on his body. Dean thinks that he must have been drugged in order to be subdued and thrown into a trunk without incident.
“Can I ask you somethin’?” Dean murmurs into Michael’s shoulder. His pajamas are silk and cool to the touch.
Castiel sees the smirk on his lips. Rolling his eyes, he turns. “Come see me when you’re better, Dean.”
“Because each of those roles have very different requirements and expectations,” Castiel explains patiently.
Dean flushes. "Yeah. That part I was unsure about." He lifts a hand, running it through his still damp hair. "I just… I've always been interested in dancing. And I wasn't allowed to do it growing up- not like how I wanted to. So I taught myself in private. YouTube videos and stuff y'know? And this isn't- this ain't one of those romantic dance movies where a kid has a passion for dance and then goes off and like, wins a competition or saves someone's life or whatever. I just-" he frowns at the table. "I just wanna dance."
“Tell me why you want to be with me.” Dean finally says. “A legitimate reason. Tell me that you like my music or my dumb shirts or how I don’t function in the morning without coffee.”
“Thank you,” Castiel rumbles. He slouches a bit in the uncomfortable seat, tipping his head back against the wall. “Have you heard anything?”
“Good,” Castiel says. “Your audition is a live test in front of the crowd. I can pass your song request to the DJ.”
“I must ask you to leave,” Castiel says politely, though his voice is a growl. For a man who avoids eye contact with the common person, it’s easy to pin Michael to the spot with his glare.
“Yeah,” Dean says, folding his arms over his chest. Castiel resolutely doesn’t look at the way the short sleeves cut across his biceps. “This ain’t my conversation. Or even
Sticking his tongue out, Dean turns to put his elbows on the island. As Castiel walks to the sink to start cleaning up, Dean's voice stops him.
“Fuckin’ cops, man. Hassle you ‘cause you’re tryna give them a safe place to stay.” Dean walks to the sink, filling up a glass of water. His freckles are bright, his skin a bit paler than normal due to the time of year. This winter tone allows the flush on his body to stand out even more magnificently. “As if the city can’t provide plenty of help for the homeless.”
“It ain’t like that,” Dean quickly says, some of his bravado leaving him. The tone of his voice causes Castiel to pause. “People wanna know my story, right?
He opens the mirror to grab his clippers. He won’t shave it completely off, but he will tame it at the very least. His fingers fumble around a few jars and bottles until he comes across some beard oil he picked up ages ago. Checking the label to make sure it’s still good, he sets it down on the counter. Trimming and cleaning himself up doesn’t take long, and when he’s done he looks a bit more like himself. He quickly takes care of his mess and then wraps the towel around his waist, opening up the door to the bathroom and releasing all the steam directly into Charlie’s face.
“The world is tired,” she would say. “Like humans, she needs a nice, long nap, so she can wake up beautiful and refreshed.”
Snorting, Castiel nods. “You’re right. I think… I’ll check in with Dean. Make sure he’s really doing alright. If Michael has changed… then I don’t want to get between them.”
At the restaurant, every night there’s an overlap with day shift and night shift before the crowd is thinned for minors and turned into the club. This means that for one hour Castiel and Dean’s shifts coincide for one hour. They don’t usually talk much- not because they don’t want to, but because they both are busy doing their respective tasks. Dean is responsible for closing the daytime till and dispersing the tips to the other servers, while Castiel is responsible for opening the night time till and stocking the bar in preparation for the late night customers. They chat here and there when they cross paths, mostly asking each other task questions, and when Dean clocks off he wishes Castiel a good night and then heads out the door with Charlie.
He gets to the box that has his lingerie and lovingly hangs it up in the closet. No folds or wrinkles will be found in them now that he can take care of them properly. He’ll do all of his laundry tomorrow; Castiel’s fabric softener smells really good and honestly, Dean wants everything of his to smell like
Eyes widening, Michael takes a step forward, which causes Dean to reflexively take a step back. “Dean, I’m trying to make amends.”
, my son’s only been eighteen for less than a year and still lives under my roof, so as far as I’m concerned,
Castiel smears a hand down his features. “Ever since I started interviewing Dean, I haven’t slept through the night. I…” he licks his lips. “I either have nightmares, or very vivid dreams.”
Charlie takes a deep whiff of the air. “Well, you don’t stink, and your apartment doesn’t stink, so at least there’s that.”
Exhaling slowly, Castiel does his best to release the tension in his body. “Where does all of this leave us?”
Standing up, Dean leaves the condo without looking back. Michael doesn’t pursue him any farther. The adrenaline in his body for once isn’t from fear or panic--it’s from exhilaration. Michael finally got what he deserved and though Dean was a fucking idiot to even give him a chance, damn it felt good to turn the tables on him. The elevator can’t go down fast enough, and once he’s in the garage he practically skips to his car. The drive home consists of him singing to Pat Benatar and using his steering wheel as a drum. When he parks in the driveway Castiel is just leaving the front door for his morning jog, looking confused when Dean hops out of the car and runs toward him.
“How did you sleep?” He asks it as casually as possible. He knows that he, personally, slept like the dead and woke up feeling more refreshed than he has in a long time.
When he gets home Charlie is at his kitchen table, having let herself in with her spare key. She had brought her desktop computer, three (three!) monitors, along with two laptops. All of her tech is spread out on Castiel’s table as well as on the counter space he doesn’t typically use.
Besides, the only person he’s ever lain with like this before was Daphne. And while Dean is entirely one-hundred percent not her…
"You haven't had the opportunity to properly mourn your mother's death," Castiel murmurs. With a hand free, he gently cards his fingers through Dean's wet-spiked hair.
” Pamela says, a bit of amusement in her tone. She sounds pretty laid back for a defense attorney. “
a compliment. Bobby and Ellen aren’t the type that praise often, so they disguise it in clever ways and deliver it with subtlety. “So, Sammy. Who you gonna take to Homecoming? Sophomore year, huh?”
“January is bitter cold,” the older man speaks like he’ll die if he doesn’t, “and the bar is slow after the holidays. I haven’t taken a vacation in a while and would prefer to go someplace warm. If that would be… agreeable.”
Dean looks down at Sam. "Y'know… we've always dreamed about this day. Fucked up as it is. And we always agreed that… if things ever got outta control, we'd do whatever we could. Both of us." He looks back at Benny. "We'll testify. Sammy- will he be taken? Or can he stay with Bobby and Ellen?"
It’s on a sunny spring day, Sam’s birthday behind them, that Dean and Kevin are jogging leisurely around the track. The sun is warm on their heads and shoulders, their pace even with one another and their breaths barely labored.
They bluster into the house, wet and laughing. In the foyer they shuck their soaked shoes, hang their sodden coats, and continue to laugh. As soon as they parked their cars in the driveway a thunder clap opened up the dark clouds overhead, spilling a torrential burst of rain down to the earth. Castiel saw Dean nearly fall over from the force of it, and he himself slipped on the wet grass as they tried to hurry inside. Now, water puddling on the wood floors, they try to curb their laughter as they undress down to their boxers.
Dean flushes, immediately thinking of the makeup hidden away in his own shoebox, the high heels under his bed-
“Fine,” he replies, doing his best not to take in Castiel’s sleep-rumpled appearance. His hair is flattened on one side, probably from falling asleep with it wet, his matching set of navy blue grandpa pajamas adorable and sheet-wrinkled. His scruff is scruffier, his eyes a bit droopier.
“He has broken the rules of living under my roof,” John says, anger still threading his voice. “He’s barely eighteen and a- a
Dean weighs his options. There's really only three: go hook, go play with Sam, go with the hot dude to a bar.
The principal steps aside with wide eyes as Mary brings Dean into the office. The leader kid is in there, the other few kids scurrying out when they see the anger on Mary’s features. The three of them sit in front of the principal’s desk, Mary letting go of Dean so he can put the ice pack back on his face.
Dean jolts so violently, his chains snap taut, his fists slamming the table so hard it vibrates even though it’s bolted into concrete as he stands. Surprised, Castiel whips back in his seat, though Dean isn’t anywhere close to reaching him, eyes wide and heart in his throat as Dean trembles with rage across from him.
“I found them all quite charming,” he admits. He shifts, adjusting the pillows around himself. His bed has been too big for him for quite some time.
.” Aghast, Castiel speaks lowly and with emphasis. Dean flinches at the tone. “I’d appreciate you not jumping to conclusions.”
“Maybe you’ll look a little less pretty now,” one of the boys says. Another one reaches out to grab Dean by the hair, taking advantage of his one-footed wobbling to hit his head against the locker again.
“Heya!” Dean’s cheery voice bounces around his skull. “You gonna be home soon? Dinner’s almost ready.”
When he wakes up it’s not with a start. He wakes up slowly, easily, calmly, staring at the ceiling of his bedroom as his heartbeat slows. That’s new.
He withdraws his finger, tucking the tray under his arm and sending his family a warm smile. “Holler if you need me.”
“Look, quickest way I can describe it is that we’re getting out of this life,” Sam shakes his shoulders gently, scooting closer. “You, me, and Dean.”
“Gonna be late!” Dean says, grabbing Sam by his backpack to haul him out of the kitchen. “See you later!”
“Cas,” Dean reaches out to grab Castiel’s wrist. Castiel can’t remember if they’ve ever physically touched, but his fingers burn and lick fire up his forearm.
It doesn’t last long. All he remembers before going under is the scent of fabric softener and ozone.
Turning on awkward, newborn calf feet, Castiel bumps his knees into the door of his car. “I can be there in ten minutes.”
As they leave the principal’s office, Mary wraps her arm around Dean’s shoulders to pull him into her. She takes a few deep breaths, he mimics her, and then she lets out a sigh.
Exhaling slowly, Dean licks his plush lips, and then starts recounting the events. “Wasn't much at first. Noticed these guys bullying one of the smaller dudes. This guy- he got arrested for stupid shit. Drugs, burglary. He wasn't a tough dude, just a tweaker that got caught on a bad night. It was maybe a coupla weeks after I got in that I noticed them givin’ him shit. And me- I was new, y'know? Fresh meat. I was tryna keep my head down. Some of them didn’t even know who I was.” He smiles ruefully, meeting Castiel's gaze. “I'm sure you've noticed, but my looks attract a certain type in this kind of neighborhood.”
Charlie chews her lower lip, shrugging helplessly. “I don’t know. I feel like we just accidentally opened Pandora’s box. Instead of getting answers we’re getting more questions.”
Dean lets out a slow exhale, then clasps his hands on the surface of the table and leans on his elbows with a confident smirk. “My name is Dean Winchester, I’m twenty-six years old. I’m an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and frisky women.” He pauses for a moment, and then adds: “I did not kill any people.”
, Castiel!” The man suddenly yells. The street light they’re standing next to bursts, much like the light that burst in the prison, the shards of glass catching the rainbows of the sun as they sprinkle around Castiel, caught in his hair, dusting his shoulders. “Heaven is broken because of
It’s the first time Castiel bypasses security. They don’t even try to stop him as he strides confidently forward, and it’s a good thing he passes them, because today’s the day he has his gun in his pants and a knife tucked away in his blazer. He’s wearing navy slacks with the matching jacket and a black tie, but something seems… off. Like his outfit is incomplete. He can’t dwell on it too much, though, because there are much more important issues than his clothing, at the moment.
His roommate is attracted to him. Especially now, Castiel surmises, that he’d thrown Michael out of their apartment. As far as he knows, Dean hasn’t talked to Michael since. Good riddance.
“Really?” Dean asks. Benny had managed to put all of the bills in a gallon ziploc baggy for Dean; the baggy is stuffed.
Castiel gets into contact with Sam via e-mail. It’s easy for them to exchange photos and videos this way- or, rather, it’s easier for Sam to send Castiel sort of a how-to manual on the supernatural. It’s all still a little mind-boggling for him but Castiel figures, at this point, everything he has is on the line. His (fake?) job, his (fake?) life, his (wobbly?) sanity. He may as well follow these Winchesters because, firstly, it doesn’t seem like he has a choice, and secondly, what’s the worst that can happen?
i've never read the bible; all research is done via google and some sites i forgot to save the links to; just remember this is a work of fiction thanks!
Dean barks a laugh, “Anything for that 401k, right?” Once his chuckles subside, Dean settles comfortably. Castiel had opened up today’s interview by telling Dean he may ask any questions he wants, and Castiel will give him honest answers. “Alright. So: does working at
Snorting, Dean nods. “Sounds about right.” He sends Castiel a small smile. “Didn’t overwhelm you too much?”
The first snow has fallen. Dean loves the first snow, how it blankets the city and muffles all of the noise for just a short while. Hell, he even loves shoveling the driveway, to Castiel’s surprise. He has some pretty awesome memories of winters with his family; driving out to the mountains to rent a cabin for the weekend and do their best to sprain something while sledding, the house always smelling of casseroles and pie, shittily made scarves and gloves that his mom tried valiantly to turn into something passable. Even throughout the tough years with his dad, Dean always found time to appreciate the snow with Sammy and try to instill some semblance of normalcy in their lives.
“Then by these hands,” Michael says, lifting his hands palm-up in supplication, voice trembling, “you shall die.”
"Pissed," he replies quickly, hotly. He drops his hands so he can stare up at the ceiling. "He… kinda reminded me of my dad, a bit. The way he'd treat me. But when I saw him the other day he seemed… sorry? But I dunno if it was a trick." He flowers. "Doesn't matter anyway."
Charlie glances around the kitchen suspiciously. “Alright, where do you hide it, and why can’t I smell it?”
Or is it, instead, Castiel’s own personal thrill at being secluded in a room for one hour every Friday, the most gorgeous man he’s ever laid eyes on sitting across from him?
. Castiel doesn't need to ask to know that Dean hasn't let out his emotions in a healthy way. He'd been too worried about bills, about Sam- his developmental years got crushed beneath John's boot and while Dean is mature and can handle anything life throws at him, he's still… naive.
Dean avoids any more questions by smoothing his hand down his shirt and frowning. Castiel catches this, watching a few different expressions filter over Dean’s features; frustration, confusion, and then exasperation.
is busy. Castiel offers shelter to people experiencing homelessness when the months turn cold, employees taking turns to go out and give meal tickets to those in need. They’re some of Dean’s favorite customers--they’re kind, full of gratitude, and great storytellers. The patrons scattered between these people are friendly and welcoming. Dean has a hard time believing in God these days, but whenever he takes a step back to absorb everything, this sure seems like Heaven.
"Dean," he says. He folds his arms over his chest loosely, a physical barrier to try and block some of the sunshine coming out of this guy's ass. "You bring in strays often?"
“You’re safe,” Castiel repeats the words he’d said earlier in the day, giving Dean’s arm another squeeze.
Frowning at the floor, Dean chews his lower lip. “Y’know what I wanna wear?” Castiel makes a positive noise. “Somethin’ pretty. The ladies there… they got dresses and diamonds and nice lipstick. None of them look like slobs.”
“That’s because Dean is guilty of killing, but not for the reasons people assume.” Castiel leans back in his chair, frowning at the monitor. “What else do you have on Pamela?”
Swallowing thickly, Castiel leans his hip against the island. “I’m not sure. If you’re free, I’d like to exchange food for an ear.”
“Because you’ll go down too,” Castiel points out the obvious. Then, allowing true amusement to shine on his hot fucking face, he says, “And I think you’ll be good at this.”
Instead of looking overwhelmed by Castiel’s explanation, Dean looks enthralled. His relaxed posture tightens with excitement and he leans forward a bit, Castiel belatedly realizing that… he is perhaps the most intelligent conversation partner Dean has had in a long, long time.
Something in Mary softens, though her brow stays furrowed. “Surely someone can take responsibility for him.”
“Ok. So you know that, like, most of the languages of early man or whatever are dead, and everything has just sort of evolved. The first drafts of the bible are in Greek and-or-Hebrew depending on what text you’re looking at, but we can suspect that the oral story got a little flubbed from one mouth to another until some genius decided to write it down. Right?”
Thinking, Castiel sighs. “Perfectly happy. No secrets, other than his identity. Michael seems to spoil him a little, but Dean’s been… well.”
“I fuckin’ socked him,” Dean says breathlessly, pulling away to look up at Castiel with sparkling eyes. “Clocked him right in the jaw.”
Castiel stares at the screen for a few seconds, then pulls away. “Can you isolate the Enochian text?”
exist.” Dean’s relaxed in his chair today, knees spread, shoulders drooped, his smile lazy. “So: you don’t believe they exist because you’ve never, personally, seen one- right?”
Smiling, Dean allows the warmth to spread through his limbs. Fuck his insecurities. Fuck trying to ignore his feelings. He says with affection, “Don’t ever change.”
Dean’s phone blasts Metallica from where it’s charging on the counter. John’s ringtone is a standard ring, and Dean had set the jail to a shrill alarm so that he’d know not to answer either. Wiping his mouth on a napkin he gets up from the table and slips on socked feet to the counter, grinning when he sees Castiel’s name on the screen.
It’s a good place for him to lose himself, though. Like putting on soft clothes and high heels and listening to Tchaikovsky, the feeling of his sneakered feet hitting the ground,
“What the fuck kind of options are those?” Dean demands. He knows immediately that he should be terrified of Castiel, but he really only finds himself grievously exasperated. For the few months they’ve been living together Castiel has been the ideal roommate; clean, quiet, polite. Hell, the dude even cooks sometimes when Dean doesn’t want to. They’re not best friends by any stretch, Dean has kinda always thought that Castiel has some sort of social disorder, but-
When Castiel peels himself - literally - off of Michael, he stands on wobbly legs, looking up when a whistle catches his attention. At the ridge of the crater stands Sam and Dean, both of their faces pinched in worry. Dean throws something down at Castiel- he catches it deftly, despite the rapidly deteriorating use of his limbs.
“Thanks guys,” Dean says warmly. He accepts Ellen’s hug, squeezing her back tightly in return. He hugs Jo, shakes Bobby’s hand, then pulls Sam in for more of an earthquake than an embrace. “You tell me what color tie you’re wearin’ to the dance and I’ll make sure to match it nice n’ pretty,” he says with a huge grin.
Dean takes the hanger with slow hands, looking at the shirt thoughtfully. Still seeming as though the shirt will bite him, Dean sets it on the bed and starts unbuttoning his shirt. By the time he has the blouse on he already looks more relaxed, his shoulders less tense and his jaw relaxed.
Rolling his eyes and smiling, Castiel puts his empty mug in the sink. "Very well. Don't hurt yourself."
He’s an expert at using the bars to move his body, side to side and up and down, spinning on his heels like he’s been walking on them his whole life. He’s not as flexible as the other dancers, which Castiel knows will change as soon as he befriends them, but what he can do is still impressive, backbends and extensions of his legs making his already tall body look longer, leaner.
Stepping further into the room, Castiel puts his hands back into the pockets of his trench coat. “I have to get going.” The restaurant is open right now, and when Castiel had checked his phone he had about a dozen messages from concerned employees. “Can I get you anything?”
defensive. “The guys got rough, the bruise is ugly. I don’t want people to worry about me.” Then, an afterthought, “Is it that obvious I’m wearing makeup?”
On the concrete floor he’s drawn symbols and sigils with chalk and his own blood. Whatever spell ingredients he’d managed to stash on him before the world literally melted around them are displayed prettily in the triangle, a metal bowl in the center filled with herbs and bones. Each of them stand at a point of the triangle, looking at everything dubiously. Even Sam looks slightly unsure.
Shrugging, a pleased flush spreads on Kevin’s features. “You’ve helped me out so many times. Just returning the favor.”
The sidewalks are bustling with midweek errands, people on their way to work mostly, dressed in business attire as they hail cabs, wait for the bus, or walk to their destination. Castiel lets his gaze slide between the passersby, not focusing on a single person, merely absorbing their presence and energies. Inside the coffee shop is subdued, a few patrons at tables and half a dozen in line. Castiel relaxes, looking up at the menu. Charlie will drink anything with lots of caffeine and sugar, so she’s pretty easy to shop for. His eyes drop to the display case, noting that he can build a mix-and-match of a half-dozen muffins, and when it’s his turn to order he relays everything.
“There’s an art gallery opening. It’s kinda hoity-toity but,” Dean stands once his shoes are straightened, flushed from bending over. His rosy skin makes his smile brighter, “I really like going to them.”
Is that thrill related to the danger of being around Dean Winchester, most prolific serial killer in the history of modern man?
Castiel doesn’t reply. The silence in the kitchen is suddenly deafening. Curiously, he glances over his shoulder as he turns on the tap to start cleaning up. Dean is frozen, bacon halfway through his mouth, eyes wide in surprise and unseeing. Without saying a word Castiel starts washing the dishes, movements slow and gentle, avoiding any unnecessary clanging and banging.
“Still sleeping like a baby,” she replies, some cheer in her voice. “I tell ya, I’m not surprised it’s taken a hospital trip to get that boy some rest.”
And Michael… he seems honest enough. Besides, Dean will be able to size him up on a date. If Michael's still a creep then he'll ditch him. Michael never knew how old he was, either.
And hearing Castiel say it… that hurts. Not in a pitying way, no- in a… sympathetic way. Dean’s not so naive as to think that he can replace his dad with Castiel (it wouldn’t even work that way, what with him being so attracted to the asshole), but the man’s presence in his life has already been so… uplifting? Inspiring?
This morning, he brings the tray into the master bedroom. It’s a cozy space, sunlight streaming through the curtains and washing the foot of bed in golden rays. The dark comforter soaks it all up, no doubt, keeping Daphne nice and cocooned. Walking in, he sets the tray down on the nightstand, then puts his hands on either side of Daphne’s shoulders, feeling his palms sink into the soft mattress as he leans down to press a kiss to her forehead. Even freshly shaven, he knows his stubble tickles, his five o’clock shadow basically a part of his anatomy.
, lulls him into a headspace like no other. When he’s dressing up he’s focused, watching himself in the mirror, learning a new routine, trying new makeup. Running is just… running. His mind frees of clutter. All of his switches turn off.
found each other,” Michael coos, pressing his palms together in prayer and kissing the tips of his fingers. He looks at them with faux adoring eyes. “True love really does conquer time and space.”
Smiling small, Castiel nods. The warmth from their little step-bubble fills him up a bit more. Just as he flexes his foot to push himself off of the step, Dean comes tumbling forward, his mouth finding Castiel’s in a clumsy kiss. Shocked to stillness, Castiel waits to see if Dean fell or stumbled- but then Dean’s head is turning, his plush lips more insistent, and Castiel’s hands fly up on reflex to push him away.
Breathing a sigh of relief, Dean walks over to the booth to start busing the table. He carefully stacks dishes while keeping an eye out for Charlie’s tip; he finds it and sets it aside for her to grab, then blinks when he sees a business card on the table.
“Gotta audition and stuff so they put me in the right class, but,” Dean licks his lips, shrugging. “I went to one of their recitals this afternoon and it just looked… fun. Obviously they compete, but it’s clear that the dancers are havin’ a good time.”
The little sneaks of the true Michael that Dean had only gotten glimpses of… this is him. And Dean… kinda likes him.
he did what he did. All those vicious killings, varying in violence and precision- different victimology, different weapons, different parts of the country.
And Dean--well, Dean was… himself. His usual charming, warm, affectionate self. Castiel truly feels as though they’d come closer together after tonight’s affair. Excluding the whole Michael incident, Dean has been an angel.
Grunting in exasperation and pain, Castiel takes off his sunglasses, the frames clattering on the table as he puts his hot palms over his hot eyes.
They share a laugh. Dean feels a warmth blossom in his chest so foreign to him it flushes his entire body. Kevin is… awesome. So accepting without judgment. Being able to share his deepest darkest secret with someone other than the mirror in his bedroom is oddly liberating. And incredible.
Smoothing his shirt down, Castiel dislodges his wrist and turns to face Dean. “Please let me know if he causes you trouble in the future.”
“No, you’re trying to fix something that ain’t broken!” He puts his palms over his eyes pressing as he spits out, “Fuck.
“Today’s the anniversary of his wife’s death,” she says it like the sky is blue, reaching across Dean to pick up two clean glasses from under the bar. “Sometimes he’s gone longer than a day.”
because Crowley likes him - Castiel Novak is the top journalist in his field because he worked his ass off for it.
“What-” Dean licks his lips. Michael meets his gaze, frightened like a deer, and Dean rips his eyes away, afraid to let the situation wholly sink in.
“What’s up?” She says with a smile. Her and Dean are so much alike, he wonders if it’s some sort of cosmic chain of events that has them both working in his bar.
Thinking about Dean selling his body makes Castiel’s stomach churn. Thinking about Dean dancing in his club gives him conflicted feelings- on the one hand, Dean was still selling his body. On the other hand, he was at least dressed and safe. Thinking about the hell that Dean must have been going through with his dad and having to take care of Sam, because Castiel can see now, Dean is Sam’s truest and sole caretaker. Castiel physically aches for him. It leaves a hollow pit in his gut and he knows it’s not his fault, he doesn’t need Benny to relieve him of responsibility- but now that he knows, he… should do something, shouldn’t he?
"What was so bad about your marriage?" Dean does his best not to wring the menu with anxious fingers. "I figured you were… that you needed an outlet for somethin' you were too ashamed to admit. And bein' ashamed made you angry."
Mulling over his thoughts, Castiel starts clearing dinner, boxing up the leftovers and putting them in the fridge.
But Dean coming into his life and slotting so easily into the little folds Castiel didn’t even know existed has been a true treat. They’re still independent enough from one another that they function separately, but when they’re together it’s just…
Eye skirting over Castiel’s features in assessment, it takes a whole minute for Dean to relax in Castiel’s grip and slowly nod. Releasing him, Castiel rubs at his chest idly, clearing his throat.
“Don’t go to a motel,” Castiel finds himself saying. “You can stay with me.” He’ll have to spruce up his guest bedroom to clear out some of the dust bunnies, but he has room. He can’t stand to think about Dean going through what he did tonight and going off somewhere with no support, to be alone with his thoughts.
“When he’s ready he’ll bring it up. Knowing how his brain works he’s probably waiting for things to crash and burn because he doesn’t believe he deserves anything nice, let alone someone to care about him.” She says it flippantly, but Castiel understands. They’ve learned to deal with Dean’s strange coping mechanisms--mainly his self-deprecating humor.
“My wife, too,” she says. Her eyes are still closed, her body still in the fetal position with her face smushed into the pillow. “Car accident.”
Dean shrugs. “Not sayin’ anything like that, Jo, you know it. Just hate to see a jerk like that get exactly what he wants.”
A waiter appears out of nowhere, setting down two glasses of ice water and hot beverages. Hot cocoa with whipped cream is in front of him, a hot tea spread in front of Castiel. Huh. The waiter leaves, Castiel idly pouring hot water over his teabag.
“Yeah,” Kevin snickers. “If they don’t unite our nations diplomatically, it’ll probably be done by marriage.”
“I’m sure these are all things we can look into,” Benny’s soothing, beautiful voice is starting to lull Dean to sleep. “However, sir, I’m gonna have to take you in.”
Raising his hands, Sam stands and takes a step away from what looks like a weird satanic drawing on the floor. He eyes Castiel’s gun cautiously. “You’ve never had one of those before.”
Sam stands up, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie. He stares at Dean for a moment, glaring, before he climbs up into the bed and burrows into Dean’s side, careful of his injuries. Like that he settles against his brother, like a child to a parent, and like that Dean draws the blanket up to cover him, like a parent to a child.
“Yeah.” Dean takes the ticket and offers a small smile. The price in the upper right corner makes his brain stutter a bit, the tag
“A polite-” Dean lets out a hysterical laugh. Now that Castiel mentions it, he is probably the most polite fucking person Dean has ever met. Courteous, even. Oh, fuck. If you wanted to compare the two, Michael was the monster and Castiel was the saint. “What are you lookin’ to accomplish here, man?”
Castiel pulls away first, always able to collect himself better and faster. Dean feels like a slug. He looks at the grave, unable to see Michael’s body from this angle, and instead of feeling disgusted with himself, he lets out another hysterical giggle, wiping a hand over his face.
Shaking his head, Castiel reaches forward with his hand, then aborts the movement quickly. “I would never, Dean.”
“Uh, other than the fact she’s probably not who she says she is? Not much. She popped up on the radar the day after Dean’s arrest and hasn’t exactly been keeping a low profile. She
“Journalism is a complex field,” Castiel says honestly. “It takes more than a journalism degree and an English degree to do what I do, specifically.”
Dean nods repeatedly. Castiel stands up, nodding as well. “Then consider yourself hired. All money you earn while in the cage is yours to keep.”
Castiel’s gut swoops. He wants to believe it’s from Dean’s smart comment and not from the nickname. “I suppose that’s true.” He shifts again in his chair. Dean’s eyes track the way Castiel’s forearms flex when he laces his fingers on the table. Goosebumps erupt on his skin, but he continues. “However, serial killers like Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer suffered from delusions, yet had moments where they fit into the neat bubble of society. I’m just trying to understand, Dean,” Castiel says, his tongue fattening and wetting with Dean’s name on it. He swallows, and then continues. “I am trying to understand how a man who passes all his psychological evaluations with flying colors can tell me that he’s been hunting monsters for the better part of his life.” His head tilts. “Unless monsters are a metaphor?”
"You seem focused on the costumes. You do know that strippers… strip, right?" Castiel tilts his head.
Frowning deeper, Castiel reaches across himself to put his hand on Dean’s shoulder in what he hopes is a comforting way. He’s always been awkward, but he’s hoping to push past that for this. For Dean. “Under my watch and in front of my customers, if it’s anyone’s fault it’s mine. Your guard looked away for just a second and someone snuck past-”
gonna put the moves on Castiel it wouldn’t have gone anything like last night. Best to just forget it. After all, Castiel had been quick to reject him.
Waving a hand idly, Michael takes a deep drink of his seltzer. He seems to gather his thoughts for a few moments, before sighing. "I really messed up, didn't I?"
Pressed against the side of his head I muttered loud enough that only he could hear, “I’m proud of you.”
Hurrying over to where he sat crouched, I saw that he’d isolated a set of tracks. Barefoot, size six or seven and small like a woman’s maybe. They moved away from the campsite some ways, and then suddenly stopped with no signs of turning back. Gently touching the last print Sam muttered, “This must be where Carly got taken.”
Sam raised up a blood smeared hand toward his brother. Dean's dark blonde brows furrowed as he shook his head in question.
We decided that Ivan and Cas would hike around to the back of the property while Dean and I went to the front. They would come in as soon as they heard fighting or shouting. Dean was hard pressed to let me tag along, but he couldn’t exactly argue with a dog.
When Castiel felt Dean’s lips move slightly against his own, his first instinct was to pull away. He had kissed before, so he recognized what the hunter was doing. And he understood too that Dean was drunk and therefore impressionable. Cas thought he may be mistaking his lips for a beautiful woman’s. But he found himself stopped by one of Dean’s hands snaking up and curling around the base of his neck, trapping him there. Only when the water was gone did they pull apart.
The last time I was teleported out, I felt Eileen’s hand on my arm, stopping me. Miracle was at her feet, panting heavily and clearly exhausted from having chased after me again and again on foot.
I grunted in agreement, the subtle throbbing in my head reminding me how many beers I’d downed last night after finally getting back to the hotel room. We were in Malta, Montana chasing down a witch that had been kidnapping children from the Fort Belknap Reservation and harvesting specific organs from each of them to fulfil a spell. Not sure exactly what the end goal was, and I didn’t really want to know.
The pair went through the alleyway, silent and brooding. When they reached the other side, Sam noticed the beautiful black mare hitched and waiting. That was Pa’s old horse, Baby. He’d gotten a good deal from a rancher they’d helped with a bandit problem and raised her from a foal. Sam never thought he’d see the day that his father entrusted his precious horse to someone else, even someone like Dean who loved her as much, if not more.
“It’s fine,” I muttered, shaking my head as he tried to bend down and inspect my ankle. “We need to find Sam.”
He was so busy living in his own head that he didn’t notice the figure in the alleyway next to the boarding house until it was too late. A hand shot out from the shadows, clamping down on Sam’s shoulder. His response was immediate. He put himself between the unknown assailant and Jessica, snarling like his father had taught him. Next, he moved to overpower, gripping handfuls of clothing. Blows were traded and deflected. To Sam it felt like ages. In reality it only lasted about thirty seconds.
“I’m Ranger Bonham, this is Ranger Plant. What happened last night?” Sam asked gently embodying the word empathy.
“Good,” Sherriff answered, placing his hat on his brow as he strode to the door. The other two fell in step behind him.
“Real quiet the last couple days before,” Floyd muttered looking thoughtful. “Like I said to the police, distracted. And then…he talked about hearing his little girl just before taking off. Said he heard her calling for him, but she’s been dead for ten years.”
Another Illustration for the story! I'm trying not to procrastinate editing the next chapter...but I totally am, I'm sorry! ;p
Ever since Sam could remember, their Pa had drilled them with survival, fighting, and the notion that a person’s worth was found in what they presented as. Sam and Dean were expected to be Betas. The best of all of them. That’s what John Winchester was. Anything less was dangerously vulnerable. It was what Pa blamed for Mama’s death, second only to the bastard that killed her.
“I don’t think –” Cas started, but was interrupted by the Nephilim calling over from the doorway, “I want to go! I’ve been doing some research and I know how to kill vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, w–”
Chewing on a piece of jerky as he crossed the street toward the hotel, Dean squinted against the late afternoon light. The unusual autumn heat was driving people inside. In fact, the only ones who remained on the baking street was Dean hurrying through the dust, and a small posse under an awning near the hotel. Dean’s chewing slowed as he took in the look they were giving him. He’d been around enough people to know the look of a Beta eyeing an Omega.
Sam rolled his eyes and continued, “No, listen to this: ‘Three workers have gone missing over the past two weeks. Eyewitnesses say they last saw them wandering into the forest in the middle of their shift. One, native Diablo Washingtonian Floyd Rees, says that the site manager said something about hearing his little girl screaming for help shortly before running off.’ And get this, I did some digging and I found other disappearances going back decades. Not all at once like right now but Dean, this sounds like a case to me.”
I followed his gaze, my eyes tracing the beach. It was unlike him. I mean, Dean Winchester walking a stormy beach brooding sounded more like one of the chick flick movies he pretended not to like.
“I don’t need to do nothing. I’m fine.” The blonde countered. “Killed those bastards without you, didn’t I?”
“No!” I cried, springing forward. I blinked and, in that brief second, I felt a spray of warm blood across my face. Two of its spines were driven through the pale flesh of Cas’ neck easily coming out the opposite side like a needle through fabric. His mouth worked soundlessly, crimson trickling down the corners as it filled.
The three of us stood in silence. I felt Miracle’s tail whipping against my leg. When I looked down and stared into his unashamedly loving eyes, I suddenly knew what we had to do. Letting out a joyous bark of laughter, I ruffled Miracle’s ears and started toward the Impala.
Sighing, the younger Winchester hoisted his rucksack higher on his shoulder before opening the door to the boarding house. The lights were on, but it was quiet. There was no sign of anyone.
“What’d Pa say?” Sam asked softly. Despite not looking forward to the answer, he needed to know how Dean was doing with what must have been a terrible time.
“I recommend taking time to get used to your new body.” Castiel called from the other side of the table.
I hunched involuntarily away from his touch. Either not noticing, or not caring, he leant closer. His soulful eyes silently told me that I wasn’t alone. I closed my fingers around his, leaning gratefully into his touch.
We high tailed it back to Diablo and found Eddie waiting for us next to a woman sitting slumped against a boulder. Blood covered both of them. He turned wide eyes on us as we approached.
Silently, Joseph held out his glass. Dean obliged. After downing the contents of his third free glass, the man’s eyes looked a bit glassy. Rubbing at his tired face he grumbled, “She got real…down, after…after…well, one day she rode to the bridge just outside of town and…jumped in the river.”
He tucked me in like I was a kid, but I didn’t mind. The last person to do it had been mom. I let my body sink into the mattress as the blanket settled over my body. Sitting on the edge next to me, Cas pressed his warm hand to my chest. That’s what I liked about him. He was a master at communicating quietly. Every gesture, no matter how small, was genuine and meant something. I’d seen it when we’d first met. I think that was how I could tell he was one of the good guys.
“Okay,” Sam said, glancing between the pair of us. “Dean and I will go to the morgue and do the interviews. Let us know if you need us.”
Taking up her candle, she slipped out of his room, her skirts rustling like dried leaves. Sam listened to the sound of her heels clicking softly against the worn wood floorboards as she made her way to her own room. Adjusting himself in his pants, he cleared his throat and turned back to his rucksack.
Sam hadn’t heard her come in. His fingers froze around the pistol he’d almost pulled out. Jessica didn’t know about his past life. Not everything. And he wanted to keep it that way.
Before I could give him any sort of reaction, Claire asked loudly, “So what’s the plan, Dean? We gonna go kill the thing that took our angel?”
And like that she was off. Sam and I stayed on her heels. Around the corner from her office was a set of heavy double doors. As soon as we stepped inside the temperature noticeably dropped. She made a beeline for the back wall and wrenched open one of the human sized drawers. On the slab was who I assumed to be Gail, a twenty something year old with a shock of blonde hair. She looked utterly wrecked. Cuts and bruises littered her body.
And I have to apologize for being SO bad at this website! I feel like a baby deer learning how to walk. (Love you LittleRedDragon) lol
This time though, as I saw the inky black swallow my best friend, I knew it was different. He’d said as much himself. That self-sacrificing dumbass had made a deal and didn’t bother telling anyone about it until it was too late. Anger, confusion and disbelief rendered me mute as he vanished before my eyes.
His expressive eyes that thankfully still looked like his went from me to Castiel over my shoulder and back again before he nodded. I could see he wanted to talk; to get to the bottom of what had happened. But his body was already shaking with the effort of trying to get up. Trying to avoid his wounds, I reached out and ran my palm along his back gently.
Which was true. But this was also an opportunity to get away and clear my head. Something I hadn’t been able to do in what felt like forever. I think Cas could kind of see through my motivations though.
The sun streamed through the thin curtains over the single pane window, stinging my sensitive eyes like someone was holding a cut onion under them. Squinting, I grumbled under my breath and slowly sat up in bed. My brother Sam moved so his tall frame mercifully blocked the offending rays from searing into my retina and tossed something onto the covers next to me. It thudded and bounced against my hand. The sweet, sweet waft of whatever bacon delicacy he’d brought me as a greasy hangover cure instantly making my mouth water and giving me a boost of energy.
Eventually, my brother emerged. Rubbing at his sleep filled eyes. He blinked  through the early morning light to the pair of us standing before him. Voice still thick with sleep he asked, “Dean? What…?”
” It said, moving faster than my eyes could track to just out of my range. Castiel grimaced, pawing uselessly at the hand holding him as the sharp points stuck into his skin once more.
Careful to keep his face neutral, Cas answered by placing his hat low over his brow. He brushed past Zachariah, his spurs clanging softly as he headed for the front door of the saloon. The grizzled men and women nursing their glasses of whiskey eyed the lawman as he strode briskly through them. He didn’t pay them any mind.
“Golly,” she breathed, pale chest turning red and splotchy with stress at the thought. “Of course. She’s back in her office. Right this way.”
As I wrenched open the door, I looked up over the top at Sam and Jack staring at me like I had gone crazy. Rolling my eyes, I used my keys to point at each of them and emphasize, “We’re not leaving him there.”
Moonchild froze as she stepped down from her box. I watched as her face drained of color before she looked to Sam and asked urgently, “What are their names?”
Pain even worse than the cut radiated from my neck as the weight of a collar was closed around it. The bowl of herbs nearby burst into a ball of blue flame as the voice started chanting in the same language as before. Hearing it now, I could recognize it as a version of Gaelic. Not that I could do much with that information now. But it was all I could focus on as the sheer amount of pain sent me to my knees.
He pulled her in close, one hand curling around the small of her back. Leaning down, he pressed his nose into the crook of her neck, right where she dabbed her perfume in the mornings and right where her Omega scent would be strongest. It smelled like peonies and honeysuckle warmed in the heat of a summer’s day. Sam imagined that that was what her Omega scent was like. Jess trembled against him, but not in fear. She tilted her head to give him better access and clung to his solid frame like she would tumble away without him.
Wiping at my running nose, I staggered over to the edges of the camp and started rooting around for some more wood to throw on the coals. As I searched, I subconsciously went over the evidence in my head, so when I briefly smelled the heady aroma of tobacco, I thought it was just a trick of my sleep-dazed mind. But just as it dissipated, I realized it was real and tensed.
Back out in the main room, everyone stood nursing beers and talking amongst themselves. As soon as I emerged, they quieted and turned to look at me. Feeling the adrenaline coursing through my veins once again, I boosted myself off of a chair onto the table piled high with our supplies and called, “Okay, everybody, listen up!”
Nothing felt right. Everything seemed forced and rushed. We came up with a plan and suddenly my face was getting pushed in by Chuck’s soft knuckles. Finally, I felt something. Deep in my gut. I shot a look at my brother out of the corner of my eye and grinned. Blood spilled past my lips and from my brow. Sam’s face looked like a mirror of my own.
Sure enough, as I studied the creature, I could see something golden flashing over its shoulder as it tossed its head back with a laugh. What should I do? Castiel looked like he was in pain but holding it back. He wanted me to go, to save myself, I could see him willing it in his eyes. There was no way that was happening.
His breathing hadn’t changed all that much. He looked mostly calm aside from the tension in his brow. I kept my eyes glued on the road after that. Guilt started to creep into my thoughts, causing my hands to tighten around the steering wheel until my knuckles were white.
Wondering where the stable keeper was, Sam walked over to his horse and started the process of saddling up. While Dean went over his mount with a critical eye Sam asked, “So who was Pa after? Why didn’t you go with him?”
As we got to the edge of town, Dean pulled out his gun and checked to make sure he had a bullet chambered. We could see Officer Oblonsky’s car down the road from the one-story ranch house that Gertie and her mom lived in. Before we got any closer, Dean muttered, “Hold up.”
Cas and I were right on Joel’s heels as he led us through the theater. Slipping past the workers Joel explained hurriedly, “The other Agent – Sam – wanted to ask me about Thomas, but I told him about my friend Maggie. I thought she might be in trouble ‘cause she went out for coffee this morning for all of us working on the set, but didn’t come back. Sam said he would help me look for her.”
“I think it’s time we go head up to the tower and have that chat with our friendly neighborhood Firewatcher, Isadora.”
“No.” Dean answered, his breath hot and close enough to the iron bars to make them steam up a little. His heat was close.
“You don’t.” I cut in, squeezing his shoulders firmly. Jack’s eyes widened in surprise. I smiled reassuringly and continued, “It’s like you said, you’re in everything now.
My initial thought was ‘which one?’. But I had to take this seriously. I held Cas’ life in my hands. But it was like my mind was going on overload with too many possibilities. I’d written my slate blank with too much ink.
Realizing what he was doing, Dean slowly released his brother after a long pause and warned, “Don’t talk about her like that…”
As soon as the door creaked open, he wasted no time scooping up his father’s journal and his gun belt before heading out into the darkened street.
In the next instant my mind went blank with sensory overload. Soft, full lips pressed against my own. Not that I hadn’t ever been kissed before. But this one was so gentle. It was like every lost moment and every tender thought between us was being conveyed. I couldn’t help but inhale sharply in surprise.
Dean hung his head, but struggled not to do so. His true, biological nature was clashing with the conditioning both brothers had been brought up with. Sam couldn’t imagine what that had been doing to him. They stood silently, unsure of what to say while their emotions continued to run high.
Jack’s brows scrunched up in confusion at the metaphor, but didn’t question it for too long as Sam clapped him on the shoulder and led him toward the stairs. The pair waved to Castiel as they left. As soon as the metal door clanged shut behind them, the dark-haired angel quietly turned to the unconscious man at the table.
“I – I don’t think I can, S-Sammy.” I whispered. My voice struggled against the overwhelming urge to cry as I thought of the blissful smile on Cas’ face right before he was taken.
It didn’t take him long to loop around the back of the house to the other side of the clearing where the outlaws were posted up. He saw the flutter of Constance’s white dress in the faint light. He leveled his pistol at her and fired. Missing. The figures adjusted their positions realizing they were getting flanked. One made the mistake of peering out to try and locate Sam and caught a bullet straight in the forehead. He slumped to the ground lifeless.
Sam swallowed hard but Dean just chuckled. A look of distrust crossed over the older man’s face as he took a step closer toward the Winchesters. They both stiffened as the Sherriff scented them. Dean in particular averted his eyes and tried hard not to pull away. Feeling his brother’s distress, Sam shot him a questioning look.
Coming up to his side, I wrapped my hand around the spine and muttered reassuringly, “Don’t worry, this’ll only hurt for a second.”
Despite the Plumb Weed in his system, Dean could still feel the urge to cower away from the ferociousness behind the man’s words. Taking in a steadying breath, he waited a beat for the feeling to pass before saying, “No, sir. I only intended to share in your…pain.”
The overwhelming heat, the roar of flames, the pressure of Castiel’s powerful grip on my throat, all vanished. My eyes shot open and I found myself back in the clearing I’d started in. Castiel was still there, glaring at me from only a few inches away. But something else was restraining me. Stabbing pain came from both my hands and feet. Glancing over I saw a thick metal rings piercing straight through my palms. Blood trickled slowly from the holes. It was attached to a chain that extended up into the canopy and out of sight. My feet were similarly bolted to the ground.
His hand hovered over my cracked ribs, asking silently if it was alright. Instantly my mind flashed to my nightmare from last night. And what happened after I woke up. The
The glare she sent down my way from her perch was enough to chase off any idea of laughter. Sniffing she said, “Yes I do. I don’t associate with the enemy.”
“Constance was the love of my life,” Joseph confessed sadly after the sting of alcohol faded. “Prettiest woman I ever known…”
Her powerful thighs locked around his hips as she shoved two fingers into his mouth. Dean watched as the Beta power in her eyes began to steadily intensify, her irises glowing a sort of silvery white. Soon he wouldn’t be able to resist at all. He had to do something, fast.
My brows drew together in question as I struggled to come up with a reason for why that made any sense. Voice faltering slightly, I asked, “But, aren’t dams supposed to be like…better for the environment than other things?”
They dismounted, Isadora unlatching her field first aid kit from the back before heading over to me. Kneeling at my side, she muttered, "This might hurt a little."
It took a few more coaxing words from the angel, but finally, Dean’s eyes fluttered open. They shimmered with a mournful pain. His mouth opened and closed as he looked blearily up into the angel’s concerned face. For a second it seemed like he didn’t believe that Castiel was there, and then relief flooded his features. He closed his eyes and whispered, “I’m so glad you’re alive, man…”
I looked up. There, impaled on branches of the dense canopy, was Castiel. His blue eyes were wide and his mouth open in a silent scream. As I screamed his name, a burst of angry flames spread out from behind him. Suddenly the whole forest was on fire. I screamed and screamed unable to do anything.
. Still looking like he was itching to pull his gun, he looked to Castiel and said, “Agent Dion, I’m going to need you to explain what the hell I just heard.”
Finally getting a bit of the Destiel action! Thanks for the long wait on this one to those of you actually reading my passion project. I've been feeling kind of down lately about my writing but I do love this story and where its going so that's kept me going. Hope you're happy!
“Hey,” Sam called, reaching over to shake Dean’s shoulder. “You’ll kill me if you throw up in your own car, so don’t.”
It took him longer than he cared to admit, but eventually Dean was able to free himself from the cuffs with a shim that he had hidden in the lining of his coat. After biting it free he placed it in his hands and went to work. It felt good to get blood flow back into his fingers. Next, he got to work on the lock to his cell. An easy enough task for the experienced Winchester.
Helena woke up shortly after and joined us in the kitchen. She checked me over while Cas pulled up surveillance footage that Officer Oblonsky emailed. Dean cooked bacon and eggs, acting uncharacteristically quiet. She still looked a little shaken by the fact that the man she’d been talking to only yesterday had been turned into a dog.
The man’s voice cracked on the word boyfriend, and suddenly I knew why they hadn’t been talking before Thomas’ death. The blood drained from my face as I asked, “Would his boyfriend be the same Joel Brown that reported him missing?”
She started at the sound of my voice, as if she'd forgotten we were there. Turning her large brown eyes on us she stuttered, "S-sorry, I think my...my eyes are playing tricks on me."
I glanced up and saw Helena looking at me with concern. Before Cas could answer, I waved her off and muttered hoarsely, “I’m fine. Sorry to wake you.”
As he gently sat me down and guided my head toward the pillow, I grumbled his name sleepily. He came close, close enough for me to smell his naturally clean scent; something like faded aftershave. Speaking quietly, he asked, “Yes, Dean?”
“Ok,” the nurse says. He reaches down to help Castiel up by his elbow, guiding him out of the emergency room waiting room and down a few different hallways. The room he lets Castiel into is quiet, occupied by only one other person, who has a backpack and a pillow and the chairs arranged so she can lie down. She barely moves when they enter. The nurse sits Castiel down, then squats in front of him like a parent to a child. “I’ll let Dr. Barnes know you’re in here. I do recommend you call
Frowning, Castiel turns to look at the Dean-shaped mass next to him. “You don’t think it was your fault, do you?”
Hooking won’t be the answer forever, but over the past year or so Dean’s learned that he’s valuable. He’s pretty. The obvious step up from hooking is stripping and he’d like to think he’s flexible enough, rhythmic enough,
Castiel falls silent, absorbing the information. He doesn’t get long before Dean starts fidgeting again.
“Dean, are you nervous about high school?” Mary asks kindly. Once everyone has food on their plates, she sits down and sends her eldest son a concerned look. “It’s an entirely new world."
It’s pretty much business as usual, just without the impending doom of John getting pissed about something or other and taking it out on them. In fact it’s downright domestic fuckin’ bliss. Sam’s back to his usual smiley, obnoxious self, no longer sequestering himself in his bedroom to work on homework or play video games. The living room? Fucking
“He doesn’t need fixing,” Castiel finds himself snapping. She blinks. He clears his throat. “He is welcome to stay with me as long as he needs.”
Castiel’s phone is resting on the kitchen table between himself and Charlie, the call on speaker. He frowns down at the device in confusion, tilting his head. “You have?”
Feeling confidence filling his core, Castiel looks back up at Michael, who has finally noticed the car coming. He looks unimpressed.
Wiping his hand over his mouth, Dean slouches back in his chair and stares up at the ceiling with his arms folded over his chest. A slightly defensive pose, but it’s a lot for him to process. After a tense, silent moment, he blows a breath from his lips, frustrated. “I don’t know, Cas. I been thinkin’ about it since you brought it up and I just- it’s hard to think into the near
“Why would you?” Dean asks with a shrug, but his tone is still bright. “Here’s the thing: your particle acceleration theory is good. Not many flaws in it. But it’s still just a
“No,” Castiel shakes his head sharply. “He’s not delusional, Charlie. All of the mental health professionals he’s seen have signed him off as bipolar, and nothing more. He’s certainly not psychotic. Well- perhaps a
“Anyway. Every so often I'd give him an out. When guys started gettin’ rough I'd interrupt with something bogus. Laundry duty, or the library cart. Stuff I was assigned to but was allowed to pick a partner with. And it worked… for a couple months.” Dean’s gaze drops to his hands, which he folds together, lacing his fingers and pressing his palms together tight. There’s a slight furrow in his brow, and Castiel is once again struck with the uncomfortable realization that Dean is beautiful… and Dean is
