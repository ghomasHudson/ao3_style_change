"Mm. Where was John going?"
“I can solve it.” Sherlock told him. “Ask Gregson! Gregson takes me to crime scenes.”
"And your pants." John said. "Nothing I haven't seen before – I want to stop the bleeding."
Enjoying wasn't the word – treasuring, desperately fostering, insanely grateful to FEEL again, all his nerve endings on fire with pleasure.
He swore, overcome. Mycroft was molten hot and so tight! Bloody hell, it had been a long time! Lestrade groped for Mycroft’s hand and their fingers intertwined. Mycroft’s breath was hot on his face as he began to move.
I felt ill, brunch heavy in my gut. It was suddenly perfectly clear: John would leave me, perhaps not today, but soon...
"We are friends, Sherlock. You're my best friend."
“He died last year.” Victor smiled ruefully. “He would have HATED that I was at his funeral.”
And again, the Alpha had set aside (visibly) the instinct to claim and breed Sherlock and helped him up onto the fire escape.
John appeared in the doorway between our rooms and we exchanged a glance. He went to my door and opened it. I noticed for the first time that he was favouring one leg.
"This isn't casual for me, Sherlock." I said to him. "I don't think it is for you either... but I need you to tell me so." I ran my fingers lightly over his chest, snagging on the warm metal barbel bisecting his nipple.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn't react how I'd imagined, neither pitying me, scorning me, nor – as in my most cherished fantasies – embracing me and kissing me with an erotic fervour that matched my own.
John had felt confused and ashamed. Dad had begun criticizing his size only recently and John didn’t understand why. "But I'm scrum-half. Coach starts all the new kids as wings or full backs, but he said he wanted me to be scrum-half ’cause I was fast."
But nothing was really
“No! No, self-inflicted.”
It was forty minutes before I heard anything – and then it was Mycroft dictating to one of his aides as he came in through the front door. I listened to him shed his coat and issue a series of orders. Eventually my brother made his way into the study. He was on the phone, arguing about something deadly boring. I don’t know how he does it, waste his genius on trivia like transportation policy or trade deficits or what Putin eats for breakfast.
James Sholto’s expression was strange. Embarrassed, John realised. “I was married for a while.” He said. “It didn’t work out.”
“Is it true, what they say about the bond?”
“Boyfriends?!” Mycroft looked momentarily furious. “I shall have to have a word with the research department!” He winced. “If anyone is left.”
“Will you do it?” Sherlock asked.
"Yes."
"You told me all about it."
“I can’t... just tell him to go.”
John saw Shane’s eyes traveling to where his left hand used to be. John still hadn’t looked and he hated Shane for looking. He closed his eyes. He felt the prick of tears and hated Shane even more. John didn’t want to be seen right now.
…an intense burning that almost made Lestrade fall backwards, sprawl them both on the floor. He cried out, shocked and overwhelmed — even as he felt Mycroft jerk and gasp and scrabble against him...
Because I AM both pathetic and unworthy.
Ravi laughed briefly. “We share an ex, John and I. Lovely to meet you, Seb.” He turned away from Moran. “Call me, John.” He said to me his hand leaving my back only to drag knuckles across my chest. “It’s been too long.” He leaned in pressing his cheek to mine and air kissing. “Have fun tonight.”
Usually my heart melted when John did that, and I could deny him nothing. But that day I was furious with him. I just hadn’t realised it yet. I only knew I was sick with the painful anxiety of impending loss.
It didn't help that Sherlock felt like crying.
“How did you stand that? Seeing him with them?”
Shane looked at him quizzically, but John wanted to hold onto his good mood. "Another round?" He asked, and left for the bar before Shane could answer.
"But... I don't know how!"
"Sherlock?"
Not that he would characterize Shane as 'quiet.' Certainly not during sex anyway. John smirked to himself thinking about last night. He had introduced Molly Hooper to one of Shane's single friends at a dinner party and they seemed to hit it off. She liked Shane too – but then who wouldn't? He was interesting, articulate, witty, well-read, fluent in three languages AND laid-back, comfortable, an all-around regular bloke.
“He’s from an old family? I’m surprised, their bondings are almost always arranged.”
"Is that what you want, John?" Shane had asked quietly. He was sitting in John's chair, his legs and arms pulled in defensively. "For me to step aside? You can be with him now."
I waited outside, holding a cab. Holding my breath.
Something hit me – something that felt like a freight train – and dropped me to the floor. I shook my head. When my vision cleared, I saw it was Hulk. Nazer and another man lifted me back up and Hulk slugged me again, his massive fist slamming into my gut. I felt something tear. I shut my eyes, it would be over soon.
"You're NOT injuring yourself." John insisted.
I hugged his shoulder, kissing his cheek and filling my lungs with the scent of his skin. It hurt my heart to see how bereft of kindness and contact his life had been that a little dog warming his feet could seem so profound.
"Because I can't prove it, Bruno. The police are maddeningly particular about that. But his M.O. is not kidnapping. He's a sniper, he shoots from afar."
He didn't finish his sentence because John hurled his plate across the room into the cupboards. His fork followed.
John struggled less, having taken advantage of the hours before midnight to nap (next to me in bed, a warm yet separate presence). But he had a harder time keeping still, shifting his legs and wiggling his fingers so much I wanted to hiss at him to stop. I restrained myself.
"If it means I can leave this room, then yes!" Sherlock had to escape this nightmare!
“Have you talked to the police? Filed a missing persons?”
I sighed. I filled my glass and raised it. “To Sherlock.” I said.
She nodded, still probing his feet. “How long were you on your left side.”
Lestrade chuckled. “HRH survived.”
We kissed, stroking each other – it felt almost like playing lazily with myself except the shape in my hand was unfamiliar and the mouth on my own was hot and demanding... it was nothing like playing with myself! I laughed out loud, struck by the silliness of my thoughts, the strangeness of being with a man this way...
His bruises were fading, the finger marks on his neck now a dull green. And though he was thin and seemed weary, John looked healthy – and reassuringly normal – in jeans and a maroon jumper over a plaid shirt.
Sherlock shrugged. "We had eggs and mushrooms... this was the only recipe I could find that fit the ingredients at hand. I had to borrow an onion from Mrs. Hudson..."
I too startled, locking eyes with John. It seemed I held his gaze for hours – he had gone deathly pale and his gaze burned into me – but a second later he retreated shutting the door between us firmly.
When it wore off, I had refused another hit. It was hard – I had wanted it. But I was determined to keep hold of myself. The withdrawal might not be so bad after just one hit... I couldn’t be high if there was any chance of escape... but Nazer had simply smacked me around and when I was weak with sickness he dosed me again.
have sensed that something was off. When the DC came to interview them, John was still compelled to do the whole aggressive-Alpha-stay-away-from-my-mate thing (that Sherlock found unaccountably thrilling). When Lestrade came in the room, John had bristled for all of 15 seconds before standing down and inviting the copper in.
“Hormone injections?” John asked.
But he continued to shake as if heaving great sobs. I stroked his hair to try and calm him.
“It doesn’t matter, Sherlock. I know
John set that aside to think about later.
Sherlock shrugged again. "It was for the best – I didn't want the distraction."
Shane grunted with the effort of standing still whilst Sherlock used him as a prop. “He can’t walk – he can’t even stand!” Shane snapped. “Let me push him.” He thrust the detective back into the wheelchair.
"I need to speak to Geraint." I went right to business – the memory of John's face when he caught us kissing... I never wanted to see John look like that again. "Do you know where he is?"
Sherlock winced – a ripple of pain through the numb. Of course she noticed – that was her job.
"The night shift registered a complaint about you." Angus Church whispered hotly. "You're going to get yourself banned if you keep this up. Is that what you want?"
"I brought your dinner." I said.
It was a comfort, in the cold, black interior of the vehicle, that John had found the captive Omegas. He was taking them to safety –
"You-tube video." He said.
“He shot Moran?”
Oblivious, Bill activated the iPad on the table.
"You should get it." Sherlock said, meaning the exact opposite.
“Père thought bonding him with the right person would give him a better perspective – humble him a little. But Mummy doesn’t want him to bond until he’s older.”
“What happened to your sister?” Sherlock asked softly.
“Hello, Mummy.” Sherlock said.
“Fuck. The pool he took us to…?
We’d been in the street – it was a Tuesday and we’d shared a leisurely brunch at a restaurant I favoured. John wasn’t working at the clinic any longer and more importantly, he’d finally been able to stop using the cane. As we strolled back towards Baker Street, a woman passed us... and John LOOKED. He looked at her like he looked at every woman he found attractive, staring at the sway of her breasts and her hips, licking his lips and watching the wind catch her long hair.
John was hard – they were both hard (a nice bonus of being with a man, no guessing if he were aroused too) – and Shane's hand groped him through his trousers.
They’d had it off in the Library, the three of them, Mycroft, Sherlock and herself. It was terrible. It was close to Sherlock’s time, everyone could smell that. It was putting all the Alphas on edge – it was never comfortable to find oneself experiencing the heat pheromones of a close relative. It made one hot and bothered and ashamed of oneself. Tempers ran high and Mycroft’s calm suggestion that they hear Sherlock out and then discuss it devolved into a shouting match in record time.
I rang off and returned to the rec room. There I flopped back down on the sofa and returned to composing. I had started a new piece in rehab - it was tempestuous and violent and my fingers ached for my violin.
Vaguely, he saw Mrs. Hudson fussing over him, picking up her teapot, moving the rolling table away from the bed, calling for assistance…
Sherlock looked her in the eye. She was trying to help, she'd helped him before – she was observant and really quite clever. "It doesn't matter." He said.
Shane's arms locked around him. "Stay here – take it off here."
Sherlock sees through everyone and everything... except perhaps himself.
“Niece! And it's nowhere near time!”
“Hello.” I said, standing up and extending my hand.
It really was good to be home – excepting how the back of my neck itched when I thought about a sniper’s rifle pointed in my direction.
The Omega hesitated barely an instant before he fluidly stepped into John’s hands. John shoved upwards with all his strength and the Omega got an arm over the concrete cap of the wall. He scrabbled upwards, avoiding grasping hands by millimeters.
He approached the bed and John sat up with interest. He watched as Shane opened a drawer and picked up a condom and a bottle of lubricant – he tossed both on the bed next to John. Shane pushed John back and climbed on top of him, pressing John's arms over his head and kissing him. "Oh god, I've missed this." Shane murmured. Their sex life had been robust before John's abduction, not even Sherlock's return had diminished the frequency or ardor.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “Give me the pack and I’ll send you your texts.” He said.
I gave him a moment to acclimate, running my hands over the pale expanse of his back.
"Ok." Shane set it aside.
“That’s rough. Still, better than being surrounded by Betas.”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice had changed – it was formal. Cold. My hand froze with a forkful of egg halfway to my mouth. He had my attention. “We can’t let anyone know. We have to act like we always have in front of other people.” He shifted restlessly. “In fact, I should close the shades. Anybody could see in.” To my amazement, Sherlock stood up and did just that.
“Of course he’s real!” I shouted. “Do you actually think Sherlock is a fraud!? That Sherlock invented him!?”
“Yeah. And muscles. They all got muscles, Alphas. Like yers ‘ere.” She poked John’s shoulder. “Big.”
“Call me if John needs anything.” She’d said, unperturbed, and made her way back to her own apartment.
"Yes. Obvious. You asked how I'm feeling, I'm feeling desperately bored."
Cam shook my hand too, his limp fingers icy. “Good to see you again, John.” He said, his voice flat.
"So why keep John around at all?"
"Yeah... bye..."
Walter nodded and it was obvious he thought he had found a way to 'crack' me. "It's important to you, this relationship?"
I nodded and fondled his cock with intention. I was done fooling around.
“Tie her ankles.” John said tersely. “She won’t be out long.
“You knew I’d run.” Sherlock said. “You tampered with my suppressant.”
After dinner, Seb revealed that his large, London flat had a conservatory. I wondered again how a Brixton lad in the Queen’s ‘daft and barmy’ was able to afford all this.
"You didn't tell John." Mycroft pointed out primly.
"What difference does it make!? You want to be with me!"
John had braced for Sholto to tell him that Harry shouldn’t have been out in public with Alphas. That was stupid! She was just gone eleven, still a kid! They’d been to the cinema. “Yeah.” John was defiant.
I decided not to think past that. It was too much.
“I don’t think you heard me, new blood. I fancy you!”
But the bloody therapist was right. Instead of hugging him, John had tried to strangle him. Sherlock shouldn't be surprised – he knew John's temper well. He'd been an idiot not to expect his anger. He had to face it, he'd lost John. All the love he felt was not enough to overcome what he'd done. They MIGHT be able to have some kind of friendship – they might not – but that was the best Sherlock could hope for now.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“How suspicious?”
I wiped the mess off Sherlock’s torso and cleaned up as much of the shortening as I could.
And want him SO MUCH. Sherlock's feelings were raw, untempered – like a tidal wave crashing down onto shore, flooding and destroying everything in its path. Could John withstand that much pure emotion and still be himself? Or would it consume him, make him part of itself, part of Sherlock, with no individuality ... nothing of his own...
“Would you?!” Mary asked gratefully. Then her face fell. “It’s such a long shot... I don’t want to waste your time, John.”
Either London had realised that noise attracted the infected, or most of London was infected.
Perhaps the ease with which I’d gained status and gathered crucial information made me complacent. Perhaps Vinokourov was forewarned and my growing hair and pale eyes were too distinctive, despite the brown beard and glasses I wore. Perhaps I was thinking of going home, seeing John, when I should have been on my guard.

Finally, they reached the right building. He pried open the roof door and scrambled down the stairs. He didn’t pause on any of the floors, but continued down past street level to the basement. Then he led the Alpha to another stairwell and down and down using only a small penlight to show the way. At the bottom he found the door to the tunnel and, locking it behind them, jogged its damp and mouldy length. There was another basement and another tunnel. Then a stairwell, rickety and covered in cobwebs. It creaked as they ran up. As they reached ground level again, a dismal gray illumination from a filthy skylight lit their way. This building was long abandoned, its doors and windows boarded up. The only ingress was through the tunnels. On the fourth floor, Sherlock had stowed supplies for emergency use. And fleeing minutes ahead of full-on heat from vile, sociopathic Jim Moriarty – and every Alpha in the vicinity – was the very definition of an emergency.
"Yeah. You know she and Vic are mates."
“I would care if you sought out sex with someone else, yeah.” I said seriously. “But if it’s part of the job, something you have to do to stay alive, I understand. Just... just be safe. Yeah?”
“That’s good.” Sherlock commanded. “Now the others.”
He took Sherlock’s clothes and left. I went back to bed.
I came back to myself slowly. We were lying in an untidy heap on my bed, sticky and damp. I pulled out carefully – Sherlock hissed quietly – and rolled off his chest. I took off the condom and tied it off. I forced myself out of bed and threw the thing away, then looked around for a suitable cum rag.
Through their empathetic link, he felt the effort it took for John to control his base instincts, to set his Alpha jealousy aside and focus. Sherlock tried to be patient. "Right. Yeah."
John meets Seb Moran for a date. Then meets up with Mary for several.
“Mycroft smiled – you saw it, I know you saw it. For your brother, that’s practically a wedding announcement. Definitely the look of a man getting laid.”
"That didn't matter. I prefer being celibate. I never bothered him with those feelings."
“Er, no – I wouldn’t have planned it in the middle of a rotation. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.” The elderly Beta they were working on had been a patient. She still had tape on her arms and electrodes on her chest. Her hands and the insides of her elbows were blotched purple and green with bruises.
“Maybe we have it wrong? Maybe they weren’t being pimped out?”
"I think he just didn't want to come to hospital."
“Clearly.” Sherlock shifted his legs, restless now, but unable to separate himself from John. “We haven’t been able to find him, John. We’ve been taking his syndicate apart, Mycroft and I, destroying it... but Moriarty himself is nothing more than a rumour. A whispered name. A voice on the phone. He’s smoke… vapour…”
I sat down – I was wrapped in his dressing gown (and nothing else) and it occurred to me that if Mrs. Hudson came in right now, the jig would be up.
I set aside those thoughts and hurried back to Nazer’s cell knowing he didn’t like to be kept waiting.
After that, I kept track. I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself. She texted him more now than she had before. I found I hated her – more emotion than I'd ever wasted on one of John's insipid girlfriends. It wasn't her fault, I knew that, but I couldn't be angry with John.
Fuck. "I'm not sure I remember." I said, giving Ravi a warning look. "Grindr?"
I felt his hands on my head and shoulders. “Stop, I’m too close.”
. I will deal with that, captain. Now get it done!”
We finished the bottle – well, mostly me. Lestrade passed out on the couch. I returned to the bed I’d shared with Sherlock and wrapped myself in his duvet. His pillow smelled faintly the way his hair had smelled, of eucalyptus shampoo and herbal-scented grooming cream.
“John, you’re not ridiculous!”
It struck me suddenly that Cam had the unfeeling eyes of a psychopath. There was no comparison to Sherlock’s quicksilver gaze – when I looked into his eyes Sherlock couldn’t hide his vast wells of sentiment...
"You didn't interrupt." I said. "He's gone now."
I was in the rec room watching a cocaine junkie across the room making plans to hook up with a meth addict later in the laundry room. I couldn't hear them from where I reclined on a sofa but it was obvious. I wondered that the staff didn't do more to discourage it.
John stayed until Sherlock fell asleep.
“I’ll go too.” Victor said. “It’ll be better with three.”
^^^ I’m sure not. Let’s get together soon. You can catch me up. I owe you a drink, at least, for running out on you like that. ^^^
“I used to do this for Jim.” Moran said, still manipulating John’s penis expertly. “He needed… intense experiences. Very intense. He bored so easily.” John was full hard now. “Mm, you ARE a big boy. I wouldn’t have guessed.” Moran’s eyes flicked over John contemptuously and then he turned away.
Moran walked to the center of the room – Sherlock stayed near the door. “There’s nowhere to hide.” Moran announced. “I built this room, I know every nook and closet.”
“My little brother wouldn’t like how you’re neglecting yourself...”
On an impulse, John stopped at the Underground. He studied the routes – he’d have to transfer twice, but so what. He pulled out his Oyster card and started down the long, long escalators. There were a couple of people spread all across it unmoving. John swore. Stand to the right, walk to the left – that was the rule.
“How long?”
John was appalled to see his erection returning. And appalled to realize his mistake. Fuck! "You've been following me around for months." John said hoping it was true. "You think I wouldn't notice? Stop it! Stop touching me!" John tried to shift his hips away, but the hammock left him nowhere to go.
There was no couch, so John pulled the extra pillows and duvet out of the closet and made a sort of nest with the futons at our back. He pulled the telly out so we could see it from our nest and flipped through channels whilst I lay quite contentedly in his arms.
He hadn't felt like himself in a long time. Months. Over a year, maybe. He certainly hadn't been sharp whilst abusing heroin. In rehab, his head had felt like it was wrapped in cotton wool most of the time. It had cleared slowly and he'd come back to London, but not to HIS London. Not to Baker Street and Lestrade and his life as a consulting detective. He hadn't been welcome in Baker Street, and though he'd moved back in now, Sherlock realized he couldn't stay there. When John was healthy again, he would have to leave. How could he live with John and not HAVE John?
I closed my eyes. John hadn’t left when I told him about the prostitute – I had expected him to. He hadn’t even gotten angry. He... he understood. He still loved me. I could barely believe it – I knew I didn’t deserve it.
“What is it doing under the table?” John sounded more exasperated than stroppy.
“You can tell by looking?”
John took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. “What’s your name?” He asked.
“Mm. How did you meet?”
Midweek I had a text from Mary.
“What is it?” John asked softly. “What are you thinking about?”
Mummy scoffed. “We all do.”
“Yes. We need to find a hiding place in here. We need to catch him in the act.”
“That’s it, Shezzer? Nothing else to say for yourself?” Vino asked mildly.
“Sure, you would.”
"It's just a joke, John. I'm sorry."
“It starts north of the house, leads up onto the cliffs and travels along the ocean. It’s the trail that Afan…” Victor stopped, looking grave.
"She's in my bedroom." Moran said with an appraising smile.
I snapped on my lamp and cringed from the sudden blast of light. As my eyes adjusted, I discovered John had put a glass of water and a bottle of ibuprofen on my bed table. He'd also plugged my phone into the charger and put that in its usual spot there too.
Lestrade chuckled. “He said you’d say that. He told me to tell you that everyone needs looking after sometimes.” He paused. “John, this might be out of line, but ... he gave the impression that you two were...”
Geraint looked up from his task, frowning. "Who said that? Selwyn? He just likes to stir the shit."
"No, don't... don't go... John..." Sherlock whimpered.
John looked back over at the figure on the bed, curled in the fetal position – a position that John himself had helped the nurses achieve, carefully moving Sherlock's limbs as they had rolled him onto his side. The memory flooded John with tender feelings.
John sat at the table, shielding his eyes from the light, groaning a little each time he moved. I left him alone, I had a... well, honestly, a not very interesting case, a five if I were being generous. I took my time with it, though the answer had been obvious after a few minutes.
Slowly at first, exploring the depth and heat of the other man, trying to find just the right angle. Then faster and harder as Mycroft urged him — then begged him. Lestrade’s movements became more focussed, more intense. He bit into Mycroft’s shoulder, then kissed it. Mycroft reached for his neck, his fingers grasping. Lestrade’s breath was harsh, Mycroft’s a gusting moan. Sweat dripped from his face onto Mycroft’s neck and he spared a moment to lick the salty drops, all the time thrusting into Mycroft’s willing hole.
Sherlock read John as easily as he did everyone else, how had that not put him off? John knew he had bad habits – nasty habits even – just like everyone does. How could Sherlock see all of that and still want him?
SureSecured: An hour. Your place.
When Nazer had first dragged me in front of Vinokourov, I saw immediately he knew I had come to the prison to bring him down. I tried to turn that to my advantage – I could be a double agent. I spoke about how valuable I could be to him. I displayed my skills, showed how I could deduce secrets for him. “I can give you an edge no one else can.” I’d told him. “I’m a resource that shouldn’t be wasted.”
I pulled him through the doorway into a completely empty room, tatami mats covered the floor, rice paper covered the panes of the window. There was an open archway with sliding doors to another room, this one with a low table and four legless chairs on the tatami. One corner of the room had an almost invisible black sink set in a black countertop next to a cupboard with sliding doors. The only thing on the counter was an electric kettle and a black teapot. There was a bowl of fruit on the table. I looked at Sherlock questioningly.
John floated upward, his head slowly pushing against the surface of the water. The water resisted, it stretched... finally it tore and grudgingly gave him up to the air.
Sherlock sighed. He'd really hoped that Moran would leave Bruno out of this. Now he'd have to save John AND keep his dull boyfriend alive.
John felt his face blank – it was all he could do not to snarl at her like a cornered animal. It wasn't an accident! It had been done to him purposely! He didn't contradict her – he didn't say anything to her. John just stood there, paralyzed.
"Anwen? Victor? What were they doing?"
Time to meet Mummy! Even Sherlock is tongue-tied in her presence. Sorry John, had to happen some time.
He walked home. It was a long way, took him almost two hours. When he got there, Mrs. Hudson was waiting.
It had been almost easy to take John's cock then – as loose and lubed as he was from the earlier coupling – John gave it to him all at once with an animalistic grunt.
The sharp, shocking burst of pleasure overtook me. I came with a cry I barely recognized as my own. John continued to jack me while I came, blasting our chests with thick, white ropes of semen. I lost the plot for a bit as I arched and writhed, bliss jolting through me, wrung from my body by John's capable – oh! So capable! – hand. I could write odes to John's hands!
Just a touch of Mystrade for the aficionados.
"I see you got dressed."
I admit, seeing Sherlock snogging with Victor had me out of sorts. More than out of sorts – I wanted to scream when I saw them. I still wanted to scream.
He began to fuck Sherlock, leaning forward, looking into Sherlock’s eyes as he shoved himself up his arse. God, he was so beautiful, dewy with sweat, full lips parted, panting, eyes unfocused with lust. “Harder!” Sherlock demanded. “Fuck my arse harder!” John felt his bollocks slapping against Sherlock with every stroke. Sherlock began cursing elaborately, begging for more, saying absolutely filthy things. John loved it.
He certainly WAS a crack shot.
"Mmmm." Sherlock had forgotten how much he liked the thing with the peas. John's appetite was much improved as well, Sherlock was happy to see. For a few moments they savoured the meal in companionable silence.
My dream was still close, the panic and fear still dragging at the edges of my consciousness. I went to Sherlock and touched his forehead, feeling for his temperature.
“I’ll see you next week.” Mycroft intoned. “Goodbye.”
"John! Where is Sherlock?!"
John hoped he was faster.
Shane looked up, took in the scene. “He’s convinced himself we’re going to abandon him.” Shane told Sherlock. “That everything is different now.”
“The child is fine.” A gargoyle said. It sounded irritated. “Sherlock. Where’s Sherlock?”
“He’s an idiot.”
John sniffed and cleared his throat, pulling himself together. “If there’s nothing else…?” I heard John stand up. He was leaving – it was too soon! I couldn’t bear for him to leave yet!
“Go to sleep.” Greg rumbled, pulling the duvet over them. “Stay.”
As they kissed, John felt a seed of passion take root and begin to grow – a little seedling in his groin that he could nurture. He wasn't hard, but John's cock was taking notice, it was willing to participate. John thought it wouldn't take much for his blood to run high. His relief was heady – almost an arousal all its own – and it spurred his attentions to Shane.
"But..."
“OK.” I said simply.
And it seemed that it was again.
But members of the gang had returned whilst we were searching and we’d been obliged to huddle together at the back of a closet, bodies pressed against one another, John’s breath soft on my neck... after a quarter hour, we’d been discovered and had had to fight our way out. John was magnificent! I’m handy with my fists, and I have a number of street-fighting skills that serve me well, but John’s hand-to-hand combat is second to none. He unerringly uses his attackers' weight and momentum against them, even after they realise this short, regular-looking bloke isn’t an easy mark.
I got dressed. I skipped underwear and zipped myself into a prison coverall. I pulled on my coat then wrestled with my socks and boots. I hadn’t worn my boots in days. I struggled to remember how to tie them. Then struggled to do it with the splint on my hand.
When they were finally done with him, Sherlock had stood in the shower for a half hour, scrubbing the dirt from his skin. When he emerged, Lestrade was there. He listened quietly to Sherlock's explanation for faking his death and leaving town.
“Hush.” John soothed him, running his hands over the smooth, white hips and up under the shirt the Omega still wore. “Hush, I’m right here.” He pulled Sherlock’s hips back until the head of his cock tickled his entrance. “I’m right here.”
“Well, that’s helpful.” One of the techs snarked.
"I'll get an artist to sit with her." Said Lestrade. "If she'll talk to him. She wouldn't talk to my men." He added in a mutter. "Good work."
“It WAS for a dry cleaner. The clerk knew the customer, said his name was Ross Noble. He came in a lot, apparently, a real clothes horse.”
"I won't let them take him!"
“And Geraint?”
“I fancy you.” He said and I cursed my utter stupidity. This wasn’t the start of a way in, this was sex, nothing more.
"Thank you, John."
He covered his face with his hands, willing away the renewed arousal he felt. John didn’t regret what they’d done, it just made everything more complicated. Too complicated to do it again. But he hated the sorrow he felt watching Sherlock walk away. He hated the sorrow in Sherlock’s eyes as he’d sighed.
“Hey, John, how are you feeling?” Shane asked softly. He pulled a chair up next to the bed and sat down.
"Of course not."
“Och, I’m sorry – I can move Gretl...” The proprietor had brought our tea.
"Yes." Shane acknowledged. "But I'll still miss you." John accepted another kiss.
And that had ended the conversation. It HAD been the last thing on John’s mind. But just about the first thing he’d done. Fuck.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah.”
“We haven’t finished talking. We...” Better to just tell him. It’s not like John could hide it. “We had sex.”
I cut off his protest. “Sherlock, I always make tea. Why would this be different?”
"You were always so matter-of-fact about the most horrible things."
Mum had rung the police, but John had fought them – and little Harry herself had done a bit of damage – but there were too many of them. John had taken a vicious beating.
I couldn’t help but smile. “Yes.” I agreed. “He is that.”
John hadn’t realised how anxious he was about the impending separation until he was kissing his Omega with a needy desperation he’d never before experienced.
“How are you feeling, John?” Bob asked.
“Finish your tea, dear.”
“Then he shouldn’t have jumped off a fucking building.” I snapped. I glared at him, fists clenched, daring him to say another word.
John was smiling at me. He'd bathed and dressed, and eaten obviously. His cane rested against the couch next to him.
accepted him. You reject everything I give you!”
“Over here.” Sherlock called to Lestrade.
“From outside?” Lestrade asked, alarmed. “I don’t want anyone else to get hurt.”
"Obviously!" Sherlock attempted to rein in his irritation. "But that's between John and me. It has nothing to do with you."
“Mm.” John grunted as he gained his feet. Sherlock admired his body. His Alpha rippled with muscle as he walked, calves flexing, glutes springing, lats fluttering as he reached up and scratched the back of his neck. John’s thighs were firm and thick, his shoulders broad and when he turned, Sherlock saw his chest muscle undulate and his abs twitch. His mouth watered hungrily.
Until Moriarty killed himself. He had killed Moran’s reason for being – his pursuit of happiness – when he had swallowed his gun. He had left Moran with his beautiful, meaningless things, aimless and angry, with nothing left to pursue. For this, Moran blamed Sherlock.
“You won’t.” Sherlock groaned, pressing his hips forward and gyrating. “You’ll be savage.”
"Yeah, sure."
And, John suspected, the scratches on his face were becoming infected. He hadn’t washed it properly the first day – hadn’t really had a chance – and when he did wash it, all he had was soap and bottled water.
“Oh!” John mumbled. Shane kissed him once more, then slipped off the couch onto his knees. He was tugging at John’s pants – John sat up and helped him.
"I can see why the police used you – how did you get into that?"
It was frightening and no one knew what was going on — was it a new drug? Some kind of designer stimulant that made people feral? Or was it a virus? Bacterial warfare? A terror attack?!
“You see my face?” John asked. “That’s the look.”
“She found me.” Seb gestured at the tiger. “And I looked death in the mince pie. You’ve looked death in the eye, haven’t you John.”
“Your date with Moran. You told her you were gay. Did you think it would put her off?”
I had never seen a black man look ashen before. But Vic's sad eyes grew round and the colour drained from his face.
"I..." I was overcome by a coughing fit that threatened to turn my lungs inside out via cheese grater. It was bad enough that John was on his feet rubbing my back, handing me his handkerchief.
Angus laughed. "Exactly! You should be getting as much 'help' as you can manage."
John had started after his Omega as soon as he saw Lestrade sorting Mycroft. But the last thing he heard his brother-in-law say surprised him so much, he turned back and stared. “Call me Mycroft. It’s Gregory, isn’t it?”
"Because your unresolved feelings for John are distracting you."
They arrived at street level and Shane half-carried John out and onto the pavement. "I'll flag a cab and you can use his phone while we go to hospital. What did he do, John? Why can't you walk?"
“I was just thinking I should go to St Barts now, get started analyzing that mud...”
"We all have our talents." I said.
I came – I hadn’t been sure I’d be able to, but I had. And then, miracle, I felt Sherlock’s ecstasy as it came upon him and swept him away. The look on his beautiful face as the pleasure overtook him… it was wonderful!
I was in control now. But now, right now, that wasn’t about tying him up or spanking him, humiliating him, any of that – it was about making him feel completely loved and cared for.
Shane and John were still deep in conversation when Sherlock went by the room. He took the stairs down to the cafeteria and got some tea. He put extra sugar in it and drank it slowly. It was lunchtime and the cafeteria was busy. He remembered he was supposed to eat lunch with John. John would insist that he eat. Sherlock bought some jello and ate it.
“The teapot lady left, but both of your boyfriends are here. Please get them out of my hallway, John, they’re annoying everyone.”
"I'm sorry, but...."
John looked into my eyes. So much love in his deep, blue-gray gaze. "Scoot up, then." He suggested, laying back. "Sit on my chest and fuck my mouth."
“I’ve done something terrible.” I said abruptly. I hadn’t intended to say anything, ever. But in the face of John’s love... I couldn’t pretend any longer...
"Thanks." John said when Sherlock returned.
I want you, John. It's not rational how much I want you. I want to give myself to you. I want to feel your hands on my skin, your mouth on my neck. These are things I think about when I am alone – how it would feel to press the full length of my body against yours. How it would feel to have your hands in my hair. How it would feel to walk down the street holding your hand, to look over at you to find you smiling at me… I won’t lie, I have no experience with loving or being loved – in every sense of that word. But I want you.
“That’s not how –“ Sherlock began.
"Where are we going?" John asked after we'd sat there awkwardly for several minutes.
Sherlock was released the next day. John had come to hospital for a check in with his surgeon, an appointment with his prosthetist and OT. Sherlock waited silently in the lobby until he finished. Then, wearing his new prosthetic, John brought Sherlock back to Baker Street.
"About how you'd expect." Sherlock replied.
“Oh... shite...”
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“Turn over.” I told him. “Hands and knees.”
“I don’t care.” I said, smiling at him. I pulled the third out and stacked it and then the fourth. I spread a bright white sheet over them, tucking it in with military precision, then tossed a white duvet and several white pillows on top.
I met his eyes – lovely golden brown with intelligence behind them. "Hello." I answered.
John was chuffed.
“Of course.” Cam stepped up and unlocked Moran’s front door.
“Why? Why can’t Mycroft’s people – or the police for that matter – just grab him when he comes back?”
I awoke to Mycroft’s voice and nausea.
It was dusk by the time I emerged. My hair was short - it had grown out since being shaved in hospital, but the dark waves weren't yet long enough to be unruly. I wore a suit, but not my Belstaff coat - I'd opted for a khaki trench and trilby instead. I could hide behind the collar and under the brim, the unfamiliar clothing a better disguise that anything more elaborate. I was anonymous, just another city boy on his way home from work.
"I think..." Walter said, breaking into my reverie. "... that you might be projecting your own feelings onto John. This is about you, not him."
you know everything about me?”
“I thought you knew — that you deduced it years ago. I figured if you were interested, you’d make a move. You never did.”
"I don't require my friends to agree with me."
"Bed." I said. I turned and opened the door to our flat - our home! I took a deep breath as John kissed my neck. It smelled as it always had, of tea and dust and faint traces of takeaway curries. The odour was, perhaps, less caustic without my chemical experiments, but I would remedy that soon enough. I stepped into the doorway and stopped. Light from the streets outside flooded the room. "The curtains are open." I said.
"John, he's back..." Sherlock strode into the kitchen, but stopped short when he saw Shane. His face went completely blank.
He roused himself, found his pajamas and dressing gown and went into the kitchen to make tea. He heard the shower being turned on.
It was for the best, he told himself sternly. Shane was good for John, he had an emotional intelligence (he repressed the automatic sneer) that Sherlock completely lacked. And Shane was rich, he could buy John one of those expensive prosthetic hands he had researched, one that would give John a semblance of normalcy.
John's eyes snapped open in surprise, their glaze of pleasure sharpening into focus. Sherlock nodded in affirmation. He licked his lips and saw John's eyes flick there, mesmerized.
Sherlock didn’t bother answering. There was no point – John knew how he felt, John knew exactly how he felt. Always.
Sherlock felt a ridiculous, shameful hope blooming in his chest. "You ... you want to be with both of us?"
"John..." Sherlock started...
“I would expect them to find a more secure place for the infirmary after you raided it, in any case.” Sherlock said.
Realising I was in love with the man was a shock. But I could trace that too to the beginning – to after we had confronted the American tourist in the back of the serial killer’s cab, after we had run all the way back to 221b Baker Street and John had collapsed against the wall in the front entry trying to catch his breath.
A fit of coughing interrupted my train of thought and I sipped more water. I staggered across the hall to slash and when I glanced in the mirror, I saw that I was naked.
Lestrade had forgotten how different it was, kissing a man. The rough intensity, the raw strength of his partner, pushing harder, overpowering and being overpowered — all juxtaposed with astonishing gentleness, the feeling of being cared for, not just having to take care… Lestrade wondered why he’d given it up.
"Yes." Sherlock rubbed at his arm.
I couldn't tell how close our pursuer was, or if he was as confident in the maze as John appeared to be, but I wasn't going to waste time trying to find out.
Geraint grunted. "Ani's always insisted on being satisfied."
I have stayed away in the hope that distance and time would take these inconvenient feelings from me, free me to be the person I was. But the longer I am away from you, the worse I feel. I have sunk into misery and degradation so great it paralyzed me. I was too selfish to think that my actions might have made you unhappy too.
"Sherlock...!" John moaned as I sunk my teeth into his jaw. "Sherlock!" He pulled me tightly against him, his mouth on my neck, his hands on my arse. I felt the firmness of his burgeoning erection and ground my own against it, groaning in pleasure. "Sherlock..." John's hands had moved to my shoulders, holding me still, pushing me back slightly. "Sherlock, let me look at you." He said. "You're well? You're... good?"
"So you want to be sober for this relationship."
Then I hear John.
Sherlock laughed. "You really are desperate, Bruno. You know you can't hope to compete with a superior mind..."
"Down here." Shane gestured. He was relieved when she followed him.
“Doctor…” John started to protest but stopped himself with a sigh. She was trying to help him. “We haven’t discussed it yet.”
I sat up. “OK. What’s the plan?” I was going to be part of this, come hell or high water.
John had giggled adorably at my quip and I laughed with him.
We clung to each other afterwards. John kissed me, less desperately than before, but still fiercely. I held him tight against my chest and whispered into his hair.
When he was finished detailing instructions to the forensics team, Sherlock took one look at how I favoured the arm Moran’s rifle butt had impacted and insisted we go to A&E. I didn’t protest – it hurt quite a lot and was beginning to swell. X-rays showed that it was not broken but it had continued to swell and was beginning to bruise rather spectacularly. We left with an ice pack and paracetamol.
“I’m fine.” I growled. “Where’s that backup?!” As if on cue, the front door burst open and gun-wielding men and women in bullet-proof vests flooded the room. I sat back, leaning against the side of the couch, and let Sherlock issue commands. Moran was cuffed where he lay and the rifle carefully laid in an evidence bag.
“I’ve been so insensitive... I just didn’t think...”
I took a few slugs of beer and managed some chips. Lestrade ate steadily. The chips settled my stomach a bit and I ate some more. I tried some of the fish. It tasted like childhood at the shore.
“I said stay out of it.” John didn’t raise his voice, but he didn’t have to. He used his command voice, his ‘Captain Watson’ voice. He sounded dangerous. John waited until Sherlock nodded.
I ran, even though I knew it was fruitless. I was grabbed and shoved painfully against the wall before I took two steps. I struggled, but I was held fast – a man on each arm, another behind me, his hand heavy on my shoulder. They turned me to face the room.
“I wish I were up for it.” John said. “I’m sorry.”
The police drove up as we emerged from the hedges. I surrendered the hunting rifle immediately and Lady Anwen tearfully backed up my account of the goings-on.
“Where will we go?” A girl with flaming ginger hair asked in a small voice. John’s heart broke for her – it was very possible her parents had sold her into prostitution and she had no home to go back to. A century ago, she would have gone home with John. But then, a century ago, a bonded Alpha would not have fought for other Omegas. And Omegas, whilst chattel, had not been gathered together, trafficked and sold over and over as these had been.
I could barely breathe. Anger kept me from running after him, but I wanted to. I wanted to follow him, see for myself where he went.
"Do it now."
Vinokourov had taken great pleasure in telling me that I would be beheaded. I hadn’t reacted – Nazer had given me a few lines of coke to wake me from my fading heroin high, and my mind felt sharp. Sharper than it had in weeks. Vinokourov wanted me to be frightened. He wanted me to blanche and beg, to cower before him and plead for mercy, for my life.
A finger of depression touched my heart – a taste of the emptiness that had consumed me after I was invalided home. Once again I was wounded, alone, staring at a Tube map...
It was half ten by the time they were finished at the police station. Mike said he was tired and grabbed a taxi for home. Jason looked at Shane and some silent communication passed between them, and Jason begged off too.
“Mr. Watson. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you.”
Where was Sherlock? John was bait, Sherlock was supposed to be hidden nearby… but Sherlock was dead. John felt the familiar pull, dragging his spirits down, depressing him. Nothing was bright anymore. Nothing mattered.
I shrugged and took a gulp of wine, wishing I were anywhere but there.
It was early morning and I wasn’t yet quite awake, still dozing but becoming aware of my surroundings.
He forced his mind back to the matter at hand – the man following John.
"Christ, Shane..." John exploded.
John looked hard at the nurse, saw the impish look in his eyes and realized he was having a laugh.
“Because you’re completely predictable. Of course someone wanting to entrap you would send a woman exactly your ‘type.’ He’d know you’d be hesitant to believe she’s a criminal. It’s exactly what I would do.”
"How did you... how did it happen?"
"You still can't stand to be in the same room as Vic?" Was Geraint's greeting.
“Then ...I thought you were dead. A part of me was... just gone. Forever, I thought. I knew I’d never be whole again. With time, I might find someone to be with... but I’d still love you, still mourn you. Any other relationship would be a pale shadow... a consolation.”
Or was he thinking of rekindling the relationship with Victor?
the fight. John started counting his breaths to center himself, going back to the most basic control exercises he'd learned. Alphas fought – they were hardwired by millennia of evolution to compete with each other violently for food, resources, Omegas... The fact that they no longer needed to fight each other to survive didn't change their hormones and instincts. Young Alphas were channeled into sport and the military, they were rigorously taught to control their base instincts, to rise above them. But still, Alphas fought. They fought with their fists when they were young and if they were smart, they learned to channel the competitive spirit into athletics or business or finance...
"Stop!"
For a moment my weariness and congestion were forgotten. My blood surged and the heaviness in my lungs felt like lust. I unbuttoned John's coat, with frantic fingers, and pushed it back from his shoulders...
At long last we were dripping and steaming in the old servants’ hall. I threw off my orange jacket and struggled to unbutton Sherlock’s coat with my cold hands. Anwen’s fingers slipped under mine and opened them deftly. We pulled it off him, then she unlaced his sodden boots and pried them from his feet.
“Tell me about the bees.” John said, closing his eyes again.
John’s laugh was strangled as he wrapped his arms around me. I grasped him back, wanting only for our embrace to last forever.
"The creepy night nurse has shot to the top of my suspect list."
“He did.” Mycroft confirmed.
“Yeah, and Omegas. Omegas are supposed to smell sweet and Alphas smell spicy, or something.”
Perfect! I rocked again, savouring both the sensations and Sherlock’s reactions. He moaned with pleasure and lust and I pulled back farther this time. He began to move against me, fucking himself on my cock, slowly at first, but with increasing vigor.
Sherlock saved the Alpha who had saved him. It hadn’t been easy, he’d almost been pulled back down into the mob. But Sherlock was tenacious for an Omega, and the Alpha had made it to the top of the wall.
It hurt to give up the hope John had given me at Wallog more than I expected. And there was still a part of me clinging to that hope stubbornly. Sitting next to him, so close that I could smell his soap, see the stubble on his cheek, the way he licked his lips... I wanted him! How could I accept that I'd never kiss that stubbled jaw?
“Oh! I’m going to cum!” I wailed.
Bill followed Ellen to the bar to talk to the bouncer. John pretended to be quite drunk and loudly appreciated the talents of the current dancer, a curvy, blonde Beta female taking her clothes off to, of all things, Brian Eno’s
He would have to send up a signal flare and wait for Mycroft’s people to come get him.
“I do.”
“What are you talking about?” John asked flatly.
Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Bill slip the bouncer a wad of cash. That had to be the initial drugs purchase (molly and coke, Ellen’s drugs of choice). Now Bill had to bribe the man for the information they needed.
"Sit down. I'll go get your pajamas."
“What’s that accent?” The smuggler asked – I was fluent in Russian and conversant in Kazakh, but nowhere near good enough to pass for a local. “American?”
He ran his hand gently over the black skin. "Does this hurt?" He asked.
John ran his thumb softly across the bond bite.
know the number one cause of death for male Omegas
“No, I’m not. Do you know why all the coppers are here?” He gestured at the groupings of white-suited forensic techs and the uniforms at the periphery.
John kissed him. “It will be fine.” He soothed. “Let’s get it over with… erm… stay over here, ok? Let me deal with him.”
Gregson was a tiny Alpha female with shrewd eyes. John immediately knew he would not want to be on her bad side. She tossed a thick file at Sherlock. “Down the hall in conference room ‘C.’” She commanded. “And don’t get coffee all over my files again!”
“Let’s don’t start something I can’t finish.” I said, doing nothing to stop him. “I have work today. So do you, if I’m not mistaken.”
When had Mycroft and I stopped combining forces? After the fiasco with Victor Trevor. I had not forgiven my brother for 'rescuing' me, instead I began to avoid him. Mycroft had graduated University and gone off to work in London and I had gone away to Eton at about the same time ... surly adolescence had hit me hard and only contributed to my desire to cut him out. Drug addiction was just the cherry on the sundae of our estrangement.
John held him close while he sobbed, feeling foolish but unable to stop. John pet his hair and whispered about how beautiful he was and how loved he was.
It took a moment for his words to sink in and then it took everything in me not to pull away from him. Sherlock felt the tension in my body regardless and his misery increased. He moved to stand up, but I held him more tightly.
"No, you can't get sick too, John." I backed away from him, almost falling off the couch. "I'd best get to bed." I fled to my bedroom for a second time that evening, pressing myself against the closed door. My neck burned where his mouth had been, I wanted him so much! If only he hadn't smelled of her...
What was that?
In the next story in this series, we find out from Mycroft's POV how John and Sherlock got back together. When 'Biology and The Consulting Detective' is finished, I'll start posting 'Biology and The British Government.'
“Yeah, of course. Every day – well not so much during Sherlock’s heat, but otherwise.”
“How is that good?”
"Just one, sir. He had missed an appointment – hadn't called to cancel and Mr. Polidor was very put out – when he returned the Colonel told me that a close friend had been killed."
And then I did, my back locking up and my knees giving out, pleasure like electric shocks jolting my body. I let out a long gasping wail and shot great ropes under the table.
Sherlock waited by the door while the doctor examined John.
But he didn’t. John did something that felt much, much worse. He turned on his heel and stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. His footfalls on the stairs slightly lopsided, betraying John’s aching hip as he left our home. I heard the street door fall shut and John was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
to do this.” Mycroft said coyly.
Sherlock texted that he would join her in an hour.
“I’m home.” John called, snapping Sherlock out of his reverie – he must have lost track of time after Mycroft left, it was getting dark out already.
"No." Sherlock said. "No." He kissed John's temple. "You don't have to apologize to me."
He’d had no autonomy, bodily or otherwise. All of his independence had been stolen. And I knew how important his independence, his need to be in control of his own destiny, was.
I looked at him dubiously. The last thing I wanted was to get closer to the rotting, crawling horror on the couch. But when Sherlock raised his eyebrows in an irritated question, I sighed and approached suddenly grateful to be swathed in protective paper and latex.
“What’re you staring at, faggot?” Hulk moved into my personal space.
John felt overwhelmed again, felt the tears threaten to overspill his eyelids. “Is it? Shane, I don’t want to lose you…” A tear got loose and John wiped at it angrily. “But I don’t expect you to want me now.” John couldn’t bring himself to wave his stump in Shane’s face, he kept his left arm firmly under the blankets. “It would be easier if you just left. The longer you stay, the harder it will be …”
“Clay is clay.”
I opened the door. John was stacking our breakfast dishes with his back to me.
Sherlock wiped the cum off his stomach with a corner of a blanket, his Omega cock softly nestled in the black curls at his groin. “You’re gorgeous.” John told him.
"I love you." Sherlock murmured, when John released him. He nuzzled John's neck, the warm place by his collarbone, his jaw - until John pushed him gently away. "Thank you." Sherlock said.
“And it’s really dangerous? Like people actually shooting at you and all that?”
I opened my eyes again and John stood in the doorway. John, my miracle.
John had meant to kiss him once, maybe twice, a reassuring kiss. He'd suggested the chair because with everything else – his injury, his raw nerves, his surging anger – he hadn't wanted to strain to reach the taller man's mouth.
"Shut up." Sherlock stood his ground.
“Help me with this?” She asked, indicating another body. It needed to be stripped and washed.
They got Indian for dinner, again sharing curries, but John stuck to drinking beer. He liked Shane, he was attracted to him, but he wanted to be sober for whatever happened next. He wanted to go in with his eyes open. Or NOT go in. He hadn’t decided.
“Yeah, a couple. That and Alpha stalkers.”
"No, of course not. John, I love you – I don't want to lose you."
“Yes. I knew there was a man eater, didn’t I. Had taken some tin lids from the village. Three or four of the little ones. Didn’t know she’d caught our scent – then she took Wiggins, me Sergeant. Nothing I could do for him, unlucky bugger, his fruit and nuts spread all over the bloody place. Put him out of his misery from the snipers nest, didn’t I, then put a ball between her mince pies. I used this gun.” Moran opened the case and took out a military style sniper rifle and handed it to me.
John had had a blast. And Coach Burns had singled him out for praise, pointing out a bit of fast footwork he'd done midway through the half-hour.
“Lestrade...!” Sherlock struggled — and sobbed — and Lestrade abruptly realised that the man’s legendary brain had abandoned him. Sherlock was not rational.
I have always found Mycroft’s tunnels to be incredibly useful. And Mycroft to be exceedingly stingy with allowing me to use them.
But tonight was different. Tonight Shane was taking control. And John was more than content to lay back and watch Shane's thighs flex and his prick bounce as they made love. It was slower and sweeter than usual and it was exactly what John needed. When he came, jacking Shane's cock to bring him off simultaneously, he felt some tears fall – he loved Shane so much! He was so lucky to have such a caring man.
There were separate loos for men and women and whilst Anthea showed Mrs Hudson where to freshen up, Mycroft descended upon Lestrade. With a significant look, he took Lestrade down the hallway to an office where he shut the door behind them.
Then the light opposite snapped on. And there was John!
"I didn't mean to wake you." I said. I was shaving in front of the bathroom mirror after bathing, a towel around my waist.
“The sad fact is that most Alphas survive their Omegas, but Omegas almost never survive their Alphas. Sometimes a bonded pair comes through here together… and those Alphas… their brains are
"He was poisoned." John said. "The same way the other two were – Fraser and Krazinsky."
Mycroft actually reached out to me, his hand hovering hear my arm as I shrank from it. “Oh please! We aren’t going to start HUGGING now, are we?!”
Something jarred me awake. Something loud. There was shouting... I was irritated, couldn’t Vino just bloody get it over with!? Just cut my sodding head off! I was ready!
"Bruno?"
“I did THAT ages ago.”
"You can tell that from here?"
Sherlock sighed deeply… then looked up. “Actually, I think you can.”
I think of all the time that’s passed.
They didn't have sex that night. But Shane stayed over. (John changed the sheets without comment.) In the morning Shane wrapped his legs around John's hips and John's cock was happy to come out and play. Their lovemaking was sweet and then suddenly it was savage, Shane bit down on John's nipple, the pain an electric jolt straight to his prick and he had pounded Shane's arse, ignoring his gasps and cries until he was cumming.
“Sherlock?”
They’d taken the three Omegas to John’s house – by then all three were alert and talking. One wanted to go home, said she’d been snatched from her own backyard. The other had been sold, as Harry had, by her Alpha guardian and had nowhere to go. Both of them, like Harry, were no more than fourteen.
But I held my tongue. Sherlock had waited until he could dress and walk around before meeting. He had refused to receive me – or anyone – in his hospital room, so I wasn’t going to fuss over him now. And in spite of his thinness and the shadows of healing bruises still evident on his face, he looked beautiful to me.
"In my room." He said over my question. "Stay and eat, John." And he was out the door.
**We haven't? Let's.**
Perhaps if he’d grabbed her any other way, she could have gotten the upper hand. As it was, she almost killed him immediately – as soon as her face emerged she hurled a stiletto at Moran’s neck. With that lightning speed, he got an arm between himself and the knife and it embedded itself deeply near his elbow. In the seconds it took him to pluck it out, Dusette was on her feet and dancing away, another knife in her hand.
I had an upper bunk, of course. I would have to earn a lower bunk, earn a place in a better room with fewer roommates.
"Ugh, I had my fill of maggots yesterday."
"Yes!" John said quickly. "Oh, yes!"
I love you. It's not rational, but John, I love you. I couldn't let Moriarty know what you meant to me – he would have killed you and I couldn't allow that.
"Yes."
“Place like this should have another set of stairs in the back.” He whispered to John.
I don’t recall ever arguing with Victor, and I had no reason to have a disagreement with a trick, or any reason to bother if I did. I was not used to CARING about the person I argued with – I’d never been invested in the other person’s point of view.
“Too much?” I asked quickly. “Should we stop?”
His contrition was palpable. Would a few days have made a difference? Would a week? Without a doubt!
Afterwards they walked to lunch. It was a sunny day and it felt good to be out of doors and especially out of hospital. John had thoroughly enjoyed eating – something that hadn't happened since Sherlock's return.
Ianto stopped suddenly and I almost walked into him. “LOOK!” He shouted, pointing. I searched ahead – and saw a bit of black among the gray. We picked up our pace, going as fast as we could without falling. The closer we got, the more certain I was that we’d found him. It worried me that he wasn’t moving.
I felt tears welling. I had cried yesterday when John had held me... I wanted so much for it to be more than it was, more than a doctor helping his friend heal...
Sherlock made it to the outskirts of the city and left the lorry, thanking the beta driver profusely to throw off Mycroft. He hid himself in the back of a moving van for a ride into the heart of London. Sherlock had a bolt-hole in Camden that his nosy brother didn’t know about – it was in a CCTV dead zone – and he planned to hole up there until his blasted heat was over. He would handcuff himself to the iron radiator to keep himself there when his biology tried to force him to seek out an Alpha, any Alpha, to assuage his suffering.
“Stop saying that!” John snapped.
“It’ll be fun.” Lestrade told him. “Rosie’s a good age for it. She’ll keep everyone occupied.”
that turned them into mindless vectors for the disease. Once bitten, their only purpose seemed to be to bite other humans and spread the infection as far and as fast as possible. Holding them at bay in these numbers without hurting and even killing a few was impossible. And Lestrade didn’t fancy becoming one of them.
"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing in here?"
“I have you all to myself for the next five days.” John said, kissing along Sherlock’s collarbone and then the delicate indent at the base of his throat. “How could I possibly be happier?”
"I'm glad you decided to come." Shane told him, kissing John hello.
But then John started to tense, his body going rigid. Sherlock released him and John turned away quickly, walking back to the kitchen and his mug of tea. Sherlock followed.
John had disappeared. I wandered out into the corridor and saw that he'd removed the crime scene gear and was chatting with a pensioner in the doorway of the next flat. I left him to it – he would get more from the woman than I could.
Sherlock had texted back immediately: **Investigating your shadow – can meet later**
"If you're going to move out... or anything like that, I'm asking you to postpone it until after the trial. Please, John."
“You’re an idiot.” John said. But he said it fondly. “You really need me to explain it to you? You’re amazing, Sherlock! How could I not love you?” John kissed my temple. “You said I was shattered, you saved my life – I wouldn’t have lasted much longer the way I was before we met. You saved my life and you became my best friend...and all of a sudden I had the best life.
on the proper way to raise an Omega! We went around to all her teachers and no one had seen her since lunchtime. Her afternoon teachers had reported her absent, but the school secretary thought she was just skiving off. Molly would
John, who I had abandoned. And betrayed.
"Do you believe Sherlock was sincere?"
“Early in me career.” He replied. “Before I was promoted.”
"You arrested him."
“No Fred McMurrays.”
“Don’t joke about it.”
"Thanks!"
“John.” Lestrade said sadly. “He’s gone.”
triumphant. “I’d recognise you anywhere.
Shane impulsively took John’s hand. Sounds like you've had a rough time.”
“But you didn’t.” Mary said bitterly. “So, we knew Sherlock was alive. Sooner or later he would come back. Or you would lead us to him. All we had to do was wait.”
Sherlock glanced again at the short Alpha who had saved his life. The man wouldn’t meet his eyes. There was blood on his face. His hands were balled tightly into fists and he was biting his bottom lip – he was doing everything he could to keep his base instinct to fuck Sherlock in check.
“I was just leaving anyway.” Gereth asserted, standing up. “Cheers.” He said to me as he left the conservatory.
“I... I’m sorry...” Sherlock’s voice broke. “John, I’m sorry.”
John took a deep breath and forced himself to step away from the Alpha. She was dead, he was certain, and that gave him an unwelcome surge of triumphant joy. He wanted to shout his victory, advertise that
“Oh... er...” Lestrade momentarily looked like a deer in the headlights. But he recovered himself rapidly. “Yeah, this way, Mr. Holmes. We can find someplace more comfortable.”
“Nice.”
The man was medium height with an athletic build – he moved like a tiger, a creature so powerful he need fear nothing in the jungle. A hunter.
“Yeah, they lock us in.”
Eventually, though, John roused himself and went upstairs to sleep in his own bed. I kipped on the couch again, forlorn and abandoned. I didn't know what to make of him – attentive one moment, texting with Mariah the next, and disappearing from the flat for six or eight hours, returning drawn and footsore.
"What can I do, John?" Sherlock asked mournfully. "How can I .... help? Tell me what to do."
The footsteps walked to the window and stopped again. I imagined him staring at our distant windows, smoking contemplatively. Abruptly, he moved away from us, into the kitchen – I heard the tap of his shoes on the tile, heard him run the water. He opened the door to the loo (I was briefly relieved that I’d remembered to shut the door after discovering the corpse in the bathtub) and I could hear him empty his bladder. He flushed and ran the water again. Then he moved farther into the flat. I could hear him faintly in the bedroom, several ‘snicks’ and then a metallic sound. His rifle. He was taking it from its case, checking the scope, screwing on a silencer. He returned to the lounge, his steps heavier. He opened the window and the desk chair creaked as he sat in it. I listened to him setting up his rifle in the window. Then nothing, no sound at all. I imagined him sitting poised behind his rifle, the windows of 221b in his sights. The automoton would do its thing, move the curtain and expose its head soon enough.
Until he killed one of them with his chainsaw hand – he hadn’t meant to, it just happened. The other one cleaned up the mess and told John it was OK, as long as he was happy, and smiled at him indulgently.
“Mycroft told me...” John began. “That you’re not staying in London for long.”
I had urged Sherlock to lay on top of me instead. I finally got a good look at him then. Superficially he was still my Sherlock, long and pale and elegant, his big hands moving expressively. But he was very, very thin – he’d lost at least a stone of muscle since I’d last seen him naked (and he’d been too skinny then). His muscles had atrophied whilst he was held captive, whilst he lay in hospital… His knees and elbows were overlarge knobs in the centre of his spindly limbs, his hands shook and his gums were receding, his skin was dry and his colour tinged with gray.
Unfortunately, Mr. Watson’s phone had been in his rucksack, so he couldn’t be traced that way. (Sherlock’s phone was abandoned in his bedroom, a demonstration, if one had been needed, of how determined he was not to be found.) John Watson hadn’t been picked up by CCTV anywhere in the city since climbing that ladder and, presumably, running off with Sherlock. Regardless, Mycroft’s agents were even now knocking up all of Watson’s associates and searching St. Bartholomew’s Hospital with a fine-tooth comb.
Sherlock looked directly at Shane Bruno again - the first time since his examination when John had introduced them. The irritating ... suitability... was still there. He was extremely successful - obvious from his vintage Rolex (understated, unobtrusive and undoubtedly worth a mint) and the hideously expensive haircut and hair product. The man had good hair and he was vain about it. He'd also had his teeth straightened and bleached, but otherwise he was humble and unassuming. He could afford bespoke clothes but his shirt was Banana Republic, his trousers were Uniqlo and he wore an old pair of brown wingtips - nothing special. He had a posh flat, but he could afford the whole building easily. But he didn't need it. He could afford fancy cars but he didn't want a car at all. His accent was akin to John's, solid suburban middle class, his education wasn't fancy, his grandparents were poor Italian immigrants - Bruno was self-made, no one had given him anything. Even so, he had no need to brag about his accomplishments, he didn't care to broadcast his wealth and success, he just wanted to be a regular guy.
"What's this?" John asked without touching it.
“Not in a bad way.” Sherlock told him. Maybe he should feel belittled, constrained, that he had to give himself to someone – an Alpha, the source of all his problems – to ever be safe. And he always had chafed against the very idea. So what if he were an Omega! It was just biology! He was a person – an incredibly intelligent, independent, strong-minded person! He was a genius and a scientist! He was valuable for far more than his bloody womb and pesty pheromones. If it were possible to survive the removal of the offending parts or even to suppress the intolerable heats, not just his scent, he would have done so in a second.
"I'm not making it up, am I." The stocky northerner said, concern on his face. He put his hand on John's shoulder. "Have there been other  instances of forgetfulness?"
Mycroft rang for the nurse. As she hurried in, I caught sight of John staring worriedly into the room before the door closed.
7. Smuggler. Source for any and all contraband. Bottom bunk. Also occupies windowsill, 90 percent of shelving. One of the only fat men in the prison.
Mycroft’s house is a wonder of spycraft. It’s a modest brick house in Mayfair – not the posh part, but the anonymously middle-class part. Like the still-standing facades of row houses demolished to accommodate the Underground, the homes neighboring Mycroft’s are actually part of his complex, insulating him from contact with punters and rubes. The whole place is wired to the gills, infiltration would be impossible (I know, I’ve tried often enough). There’s a control room where Mycroft’s security detail is camped and an excellent kitchen staffed with a very accommodating cook. But the real marvel is the basement. Or the basements. There are three levels below the first floor, each serving a specific purpose
“Be an idiot indoors, ok?”
John took one look and attempted to smile. "Madam Dusette." He croaked. "I presume Sherlock called you in?"
Shane had quite a few questions for John about different kinds of wounds and how long it would take to die from them, what sort of damage certain weapons would wreak and what weapons had made certain wounds.
I nodded and made my way to the bar. We weren’t at a pub, I’d suggested a rather posh cocktail bar with a reputation for attracting a gay crowd – not my usual sort of place. I wasn’t comfortable here, which I hoped would cover that I wasn’t at all comfortable with Moran.
"You should have thought of that before you crawled into my bed, then. Shove over."
The Alpha stepped towards him, into Sherlock’s personal space. His scent was everywhere, cut grass and hot sun and growing things all around Sherlock. “I don’t even know your name.” The Alpha said. “I don’t understand.” He reached out and caressed Sherlock’s jaw, his fingers tender.
“Sweaty.” John had replied.
Sherlock shrugged. “If that’s what he’d wanted, he could have put me in his infirmary and harvested my eggs.”
“I asked him to come.” Anwen said. “About the will.”
The boy looked wary. “Alfred.” He said.
And that was it. Lestrade had shoved his dresser into the closet. If Mycroft opened the door, he’d find a jumble of shoes and laundry on the floor below the hanging suits and shirts in dry-cleaner's bags, Lestrade’s secret clutter.
Sherlock finally talks with Victor, then interviews the other members of the family.
But he was laying in John’s arms with the taste of John’s cum in his mouth, his lips bruised from John’s kisses and he had never felt happier. If Lestrade showed up right then with a serial killer, he would solve it without leaving John’s perfect embrace.
John was baring his teeth in disgust.
John fucked me, his hips slapping against my spread buttocks, slamming me against the table. John fucked me savagely, keeping me pinned, immobilized beneath him. I couldn’t have escaped if I tried – but why would I want to escape such a divine battering?
I was terribly out of practice, but Sherlock didn’t seem to mind. I applied myself, my hand meeting my lips every other stroke, nuzzling his sac, taking each testicle in my mouth. He spread his legs wide as I returned to his cock, tonguing his slit then swallowing him down. I brushed my fingers down his perineum, ghosting across his hole and he groaned aloud.
I could give him this.
"They're chopping my hand off." John repeated in a much smaller voice. A voice filled with pain.
“It’s, erm, just Greg... Mycroft.”
"So." Shane said. "You love him."
Sherlock arrived with the food a few minutes before eight. Shane carefully got out of bed and helped Sherlock set up the rolling table wile John adjusted the bed and adjusted himself in the bed.
The hunter in the dark green coat sipped coffee and watched the restaurant. Sherlock was happy he’d found this doorway – it hid him from the hunter sufficiently. The man was examining every passerby. If anyone walked past twice, they had his laser focus. Sherlock would have to be careful with this one.
And waited.
“Your daughter is… somewhat older.”
“You think John would be happy to hear I took you larking all over town?”
We got fish and chips to go and ate on a bench in a little park. I fed him salty chips every time he seemed to lose interest in his food.
“Depends how you define “ok.” She’s alive.” I rubbed my eyes again. “Sorry, I shouldn’t be so bitter. I got her into a rehab facility. Some crazy posh place in Switzerland. I flew there with her and stayed while she went through detox.”
“Run, Suki.” John cried.
He looked absolutely lovely in his too-small t-shirt, his hair rumpled, his lush lips dark red on his pale face, his eyes so sharp. He could see right through me. Even the chapped pink of his nose was enticing.
He was rude to his neighbors, but several of them let him know they were sexually available regardless. He never used to care about such things - he'd file the information along with everything else. But now he found himself wondering what it would feel like to be with the voluptuous industrial designer on the second floor or the brutish sculptor in the flat below. He found himself trying to work up some enthusiasm for the sculptor and his built arms and muscle bound chest... but he couldn't. He wasn't John.
"I... I've never wanted that before. I don't want it." Sherlock noticed dots of blood seeping through his sleeve. He'd scratched open the track marks again. God, they itched still.
“How do you do it? Suppressants mask your Omega scent, but how do you convincingly emulate a Beta scent?”
Moran’s hand settled on Sherlock’s hip. “Shall we?” He asked, indicating the tunnel.
John introduced Sherlock to the psychiatrist, Bob.
Abruptly, he pulled me off his prick. I looked up at him astonished.
"Yes!"
When Mycroft had introduced her to James Moriarty, Mummy was disposed against the match. Moriarty was unobjectionable, but a Holmes Omega could do so much better. Sherlock could have been bonded with royalty! Or any of a number of billionaires. For a healthy, young, fertile,
John cursed under his breath and grabbed a folded sheet from a shelf and wrapped it around the girl. He picked her up gently in his arms and carried her to the center of the room. "It's going to be OK, Molly." He reassured her softly.
Mycroft... I’ve met several times with Mycroft about the Moriarty problem. I don’t like his predictions about where this chapter will lead, but he’s rarely wrong about these sorts of things. We have been preparing.
John shoved his socks in his pocket and began to try to work his boots onto his feet. “Just a minute.” He said. He had pulled his jumper and jeans on over bare skin. He hadn’t been able to button the flies – he was still having a lot of trouble with fine motor skills – but he was covered.
"I've never been more serious." Now Sherlock's brow was furrowed.
There was dead silence for a long moment... then Sherlock started to guffaw heartily. "I'll order food." He said, pulling out his phone.
"I'll have to go sometime." John said. "It'd be like being back in the army, going on holiday by myself... maybe Venice should wait until I have someone to go with."
The medicine he did bring took the edge off my suffering – enough that I felt like sitting up and eating the chicken soup John had brought for me as well. I turned on the telly and flipped through channels. 'Die Hard' was on Cinema Classics, John loved that film. I finished my soup and tea and lay back down listening to Alan Rickman's baritone... I used to be able to do a pretty good Hans Gruber impression...
That’s when John discovered the final indignity. His sex organs were exposed. The ropes carefully encircled the base of his penis and scrotum, presenting them outward. Flaccid, it was uncomfortable. Erect, John imagined it would be excruciating. Either way, he felt extremely vulnerable.
“John is happy when I’m happy. And it isn’t
“Family emergency. You get a pass.” She sipped her drink, regarding me over the rim. “Do you want to talk about it?”
If I could go back, would I? If I could have him alive in all his prickly, infuriating glory, would I? My heart says YES! In an instant. He's mine! My best friend, my closest companion, the man that knows everything about me and loves me - ME! As average and unspectacular as I am, that magnificent creature loves me! I love him too.
“Oh.” Suddenly I felt weighed down, defeated. I’d thought being with someone else who missed him would lighten the load, but it was having the opposite effect. I went home soon after.
“Come in, gentlemen.”
“Yeah. I mean, it’s an upheaval – had to take time off school, had to move. All my life plans, I have to rethink them now that it isn’t just me. But I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
“Once I began recognising the pattern, I began to see it other places – Moriarty’s fingerprints, his signature, is all over the drugs trade. He controls it and almost no one knows it – not the cartels, not the police, not Interpol or the D.E.A., no one.”
"And our flaws."
“She’d left a blood trail into the drain, but it was drips. She wasn’t losing a lot of blood. The wound might not even be fatal if she could keep it from becoming infected. It wouldn’t rob her of much of her speed and strength, and the adrenalin would more than make up for it. If she found me in the drain, she’d make short work of me before I could bring my gun to bear. I could hear her up ahead, growling and tearing at the foliage as she ran, but I couldn’t see anything. It was black as pitch.
“I could kiss you for hours.” Sherlock rumbled.
"That was." John agreed. He kissed Sherlock, enjoying an encouraging hint of arousal in his own battered body with relief – the first sign that at some point, he would feel normal again. John had been almost convinced that was impossible.
“No. It’s gone grey. Dead grey.”
“It’s not funny.” John said, sounding hurt.
And end up in prison. That wouldn't do.
“Well, you look lovely.” I told her. She squeezed my arm and I cleared my throat self-consciously. “How’s your cheek?” I asked. “Your eye?”
“Do your brothers feel the same way?” I asked. “Does Geraint feel he was cheated out of the Earldom?”
I walked through two separate rooms, both I would classify as 'the living room.' I suspected one was called 'the morning room' and the other 'the lounge' or some such. One led to a conservatory overlooking the ocean – not that much of it was visible through the morning mist. The man who had taken our bags to our rooms was there watering the many plants.
“I just... I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do. Things can’t be the way they were, not after this... this betrayal. But all I’ve wanted for two years is to have that back...”
“I MIGHT eat if anyone had thought to stock the cupboards.”
“It’s not what you’re thinking.” Sherlock said softly.
Sherlock could fuck himself.
“And conversely, to find Alphas that are trustworthy.” Lestrade extrapolated. “So you think John would have smelled ‘perfect’ no matter how you met him.”
“What do you think about the will? About the substitution?”
“Hurry up! Don’t make me have to come find you.”
“‘E talks to it.” Victor volunteered.
“Where were we?” I asked, cupping his jaw to kiss him. He was passionate – fiercely so – and I felt myself responding quickly. It was heaven just to touch him again, to run my hands over his chest, down his thigh, to kiss the shell of his ear and feel his shiver of delight. I pushed him down onto his back, rolling on top of him.
“John, you do appreciate the importance of keeping this secret?”
“That’s my advice to
"I know, my love." He smoothed John's hair, petting his head.
Moran slashed out at her with the knife he’d pulled out of his arm. She evaded and jabbed with her knife, scoring a cut on his shoulder. And another along his thigh – she had knives in both hands!
"Ohhh!" Sherlock sighed. John smiled – pleasure was replacing the pain. He began to fuck slowly, steadily, Sherlock grunting with each thrust. "More, John..."
“I want to see you.” He said, putting Sherlock’s legs over his shoulders.
“Intelligent precautions.”
The biggest problem was my gait. I know I have a distinctive way of moving. I had to disguise that somehow. I wish it was as easy as affecting a limp, but somehow that made me move MORE like myself. Especially after fracturing my hip and gimping around London for two months. They certainly had that uploaded for comparison. Arg.
Sherlock did know. "Fine! But I'm not wearing your clothes."
Moriarty. If he even suspected the depth of my feelings for John he would kill him outright. But I feared that if John left now, moved out, Moriarty would punish him for the disloyalty. That death would be infinitely more cruel – Moriarty didn't tolerate disloyalty. I had to keep John close, but keep Moriarty convinced he was nothing but a 'pet'...
As irritating as that was, John was relieved Sherlock hadn't awakened from his swoon in the same romantic mood he'd been in before fainting. Sherlock's naked desire to so completely intertwine his life and John's was overwhelming, discomfiting and frightening. No wonder Sherlock had run away from John – John felt like fleeing the intensity of Sherlock's emotion too.
Last night, around midnight, Sherlock had been woken by a night nurse. "You can't sleep there." She said. "You can't get in bed with the patients."
"Normally, I'd agree with you - John is more than capable. But being around you is hazardous - wasn't he kidnapped TWICE by murderous thugs because of you? There's a criminal outside right now watching his flat BECAUSE OF YOU!"
Sherlock shrugged one shoulder without looking up from his phone.
The entire time I berated myself for letting myself get distracted – allowing my anger and worry over Sherlock’s desperate state get the better of me. I forced myself not to blame the other soldiers – though why one of them couldn’t have simply shot the machete-wielding madman was a mystery. I could have been WITH Sherlock instead of fretting endlessly about him.
"John might disagree."
“Not to worry, I’m doing a favour for the landlady. If it works out, she’ll give us a break on the rent.”
The torch app on John's iPhone flamed to life. "I can get us through." He said. "Trust me." Anwen hesitated as John started off – but another gunshot and a rustle of shrubs had her running after him. I brought up the rear.
There was also a coat room that held many of the family's coats, jackets and boots – I wished I'd raided it before starting out on the Cliffside Trail the day before. A small toilet with a stall shower and well stocked linen cupboard was adjacent to the guest room, but available to all. Behind that was another staircase leading to the second floor.
"How long have you been in love with him." Victor asked me softly.
(Had he trimmed in anticipation of this? Coupling with ME? The rest of his body was natural – John wasn't much for manscaping... or had he done it for HER? I put her out of my mind. There would be time for that later.)
John took a swig of his beer. He set it down and held his hand out to me. I wasn't certain what he wanted, but I tentatively put my hand in his. He squeezed it and smiled at me. "Thank you for cleaning up the mess." He said. I smiled back at him and for a moment we sat there, holding hands across the table. Butterflies erupted in my stomach as he ran his thumb across my knuckles.
John scoffed. "You're looking forward to sleeping in your own bed instead of crowding into this thing. Besides, hospital gives you the heebie-jeebies."
“You really do get around.” Shane looked disgusted. “That was supposed to be a joke on itinerant.”
I looked up and blinked. Lestrade was standing in the doorway of the bedroom.
*Your boyfriend? Have I met him?*
“Sarah.” I said, then I scoffed. “Not that any of those thugs knew that – she went by ‘Misty.’ Is anyone ACTUALLY named Misty? Her real name is Sarah.”
"John knew." Sherlock said brusquely. "And I've BEEN doing something - I've been attempting to link Moran to Moriarty's network, whilst watching for any hint of criminal activity. He's insulated himself quite effectively, but it's clear he's behind several high profile assassinations."
"Who is this?" Sherlock asked.
Moriarty had used him against me once already. He would again, given the chance. I couldn't allow that. What wouldn't I do to protect John?
"No, sorry."
Sherlock felt John stir, waking him from the edge of slumber.
It vexed Sherlock that he hadn't solved the suspicious deaths in the intensive care ward.
The fire escape led to the roof. Sherlock dashed across barely glancing to see if the short Alpha followed. He leapt onto another building and then another, stopping only to get his bearings. He heard sirens – the police were finally coming to break up the riot. Sherlock hoped they only sent Betas. Surely the police were intelligent enough to work out what had happened.
I smelled it then, on his wooly jumper: along with the scent of ale and cigarettes: perfume.
I made him drink a glass of water. He complained about his throat hurting, but he drank it with my help. Then I put him into the bath. He was docile, doing whatever I bid as long I stayed nearby. There was no way I was leaving him in this state.
“My father. He told me to trust it – if someone’s scent was bad or even off, to stay away.”
“A big, tall Alpha, brown coat, short blond hair, pink face, smoking a cigarette, with his trousers tucked into rubber boots. Anything else you remember, Auntie?”
I opened an eye and looked at her. She was young, only a few years out of medical school, short hair, no makeup, military uniform. She wore a new necklace, it was sentimental but cheap and common, brassy...
Sherlock poured John more wine as John filled their plates. On a whim, Sherlock poured himself some wine. John raised his eyebrows at that, but said nothing.
He dropped heavily into a chair, regret bowing his head. “I never should have left! What have I done?!”
"No..." John paused. "But I need to practice... If the fight had been longer... he easily could have taken advantage of my handicap."
"Are you breaking up with me?" John asked. He felt tense again, his jaw aching with it. He felt profoundly confused – he'd thought he'd made a decision, and Shane ending their relationship would make it easy for John... but he felt incredibly sad at the thought of losing this gangly writer with the floppy hair. How could he hold two people in his heart at once?
"I guess."
“Ok.” The Alpha said softly.
Two days later there was a third body.
I tried not to look as shocked as I felt. Thirty million pounds is ‘somewhat more?’ This is a totally different world from what I live in.
“We were at an impasse.” I interjected forcefully. “Jim and me. I knew he could call you off – you and the other snipers. He knew that I could work out how, that I could make him tell me. Jim understood me – my genius – better than anyone. He understood what I am capable of – that I am capable of everything he was. Everything. He shot himself, killed himself, so I couldn’t make him tell me how to stop you killing my friends, so I’d HAVE to jump. He killed himself because it was the only way he could win.”
“Fine. Do you want takeaway for dinner? Or anything from home?”
Sherlock woke in pain.
), and focussed on it.
John stepped up onto his feet, still straddling Sherlock's lap, then spread his legs wide, balancing on the wall, until his cock was level with Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock leaned forward and took the head between his lips. He tongued the slit, savouring the salty bitterness there. Then, again cupping John's arse, urged him forward.
Victor cringed.
How could Sherlock blame then when even
“I'm a trauma surgeon.” John said in a voice devoid of emotion. “Do you have a prosthetic for that?”
I laughed, watching him drain off half the glass. “That was rugby.”
Normally, I’d stay as far as possible from the crowded, tourist-riddled intersection, but today I wanted the crowds. One thing being shorter is good for: disappearing in a crowd. I leapt from the cab onto the teaming sidewalks. I let myself be carried along until I saw one of the big purveyors of cheap fashion and ducked in. I stood, invisible, between the teeming racks for ten minutes, watching the door. I didn’t make anyone who might be looking for me.
I scoffed. “Moriarty again! He’s your excuse for everything.”
We were in a small tiled hall. In front of me was a step up onto wood floors. There were slippers on the step. Through an open doorway I saw tatami mats. I took off my shoes, stepping carefully into the wood floor in my socks.
“How can you be so sweet?” John asked. “You’re the worst human being I know.” He guided Sherlock into a comfortable position on his side, John pressed against his back with his arm around Sherlock’s chest.
"Different than what he did to you. We went to his bedroom – he had the skin of a tiger he'd killed there as a rug. We lay down on it... his touch made my skin crawl... he played games, seeing what I'd let him do... he undressed me and himself and pushed me onto my stomach. He was going to do it... I was trying to prepare, but it was all I could do to hold still... he was just getting started..."
“Then you’ll come back?”
The first time he fingered me, I just about passed out from the pleasure. He could see how much I loved it. It wasn't long before he was fucking me. I had no idea anything could feel so good! I especially loved it when he held me down on his bed and whispered in my ear what he was going to do to me with his cock.
Shane glanced down at Sherlock and Lestrade followed his gaze. Sherlock was black with filth from the floor, his white vest stained, his arms streaked, his hands and feet completely covered and gritty. He imagined it had got on his face as well.
"It's not your fault, William. Stop beating yourself up. This is something terrible that happened to you, not something you deserved."
“Yeah.”
The seventeen steps up to 221b seemed never ending. At the first landing Sherlock burst out of the flat and clattered down to John.
“John! Oh, John!” Sherlock cried, his entire body straining, shuddering. I felt the hot spray of his ejaculate.
There were three other women and another man, none of whom made much of an impression and I struggled to keep their names in my memory. I WAS happy to note that two of them wore jeans.
Sherlock smiled at me so fondly that my irritation drained away like water through a sieve. Unthinkingly, he broke off a hunk of strudel and popped it in his mouth with a satisfied smirk and I smiled with utter fondness myself. I wasn’t the only one who was predictable.
Victor shrugged. “Afan showed me his will after we married. He wanted to leave me half… but I talked him out of it. All I really want are some of the things that were ours – a painting we bought on holiday, a tea set he fancied… maybe some of his things as mementoes – I gave him a pen for his birthday one year. He carried it everywhere…“ Victor bowed his head and I felt badly that I’d reminded him of his grief. “Sorry…”
Note Chekhov' hedge maze.
I frowned. "If you see him, please ask him to come to my room immediately."
Moran was already moving across the room to a hose coiled neatly on the wall. He turned the single faucet and tested the stream of water. “Watch out.” He told Sherlock, indicating that he was going to spray John and the sling.
“John...” Sherlock had said quietly. There was such sorrow in his voice.
"He didn't say."
“I know.” Mary assured me. “That’s what I’m saying. I wouldn’t have invited you here if I thought you were interested... but you’ve been nothing but a perfect gentleman, John. You make me feel comfortable. I appreciate that almost as much as the rescue.”
"Because you're so decent - I like to hear a decent man talk about the indecent things he's done."
He set that aside. What was the last thing he could remember? He’d work back from there. He’d been in his flat... with Sherlock! The bonding, the heat, the riot – it all came back in a flash. Where was Sherlock!? John thrashed vainly against the hard, plastic bonds – he HAD TO get to Sherlock! It was imperative!
“Sherlock, you don’t have to worry about me. Not right now. Whatever you need to do now, know that I love you and I trust you. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you. Come home when you’re ready. I’ll be there. And if there’s anything else you need, just let me know and I’ll come.”
Sherlock told himself not to want more, to cherish the memory of having been loved, but to accept that that part of his life, so briefly ignited, was finished. But returning to celibacy was more difficult than he could have anticipated. His body yearned to be touched.
"To everyone but him, I imagine."
I set out.
"John, don't confuse what YOU would or wouldn't accept for what Sherlock would or wouldn't. If you were in Sherlock's position, you think you would walk away. But that doesn't mean he will."
“That’s so romantic!” Paula said.
I clung to his wrist as I gasped for air like a fish. I stomped his foot under the table, hard, then gritted my teeth and broke his thumb. He screeched. The guards watched with minor interest as I reclaimed my hunk of bread.
I couldn't share him, I knew that now. I'd thought I could. I'd thought that there wasn't a deal I wouldn't make if I could have John... but the thought of him with his girlfriend (any girlfriend) turned my stomach.
My heart was racing. I gripped the sheets tightly, fighting vertigo, trying to orient myself in the waking world. Moriarty was in jail – he'd been denied bail! He was in jail and he'd go to prison after his trial.
"I... I don't think that's a good idea."
“Christmas Eve drinkies!” Molly exclaimed. Mrs. Hudson passed around the tray of fancy little... goblets? Drinks glasses? They weren’t flutes... more like tulips... Lestrade wasn’t certain what they were called. He took one anyway and raised it for the toast.
John continued to stare at him, but the listlessness was gone. John's face was animated with emotions too fleeting and complex for Sherlock to decipher. They coalesced into a flare of temper. "What the bloody fuck are you talking about!?" He demanded.
He clenched his jaw, but he took my arm and stood up. I held onto him as he climbed out of the tub, his cock piercing flashing in the light, then wrapped a big towel around him. He started drying himself off.
"I don't know. I can't imagine it. But who would kill him?"
“He said...” Sherlock looked away. “It doesn’t matter.”
I dithered over his toiletries, trying to decide what I needed. Soap – soap was good.
“That’s... erm, interesting.” I said, my whole body tingling with excitement. “So... next week?”
The teenager gasped when she heard the name and everyone looked at her.
The empathetic link was ever-present. They might be kilometers apart, and the low hum of Sherlock's concentration or excitement or irritation would wend its way through John's emotions. He could separate his own feelings if he thought about it, but the world was so much richer with his mate's sharp sensations mingling with his own. It gave John new perspectives, new contexts. The link even brought them together in sleep, their dreams mingling, blending, coalescing into strange and wonderful vistas they shared together.
"I'm sorry I interrupted." John said to the dishes. "I thought he'd gone."
I didn’t end up incorporating it, but I was thinking that John’s sudden disappearance would be a red flag if he was indeed being watched. Mycroft, of course, had a story ready: John had to take his drunken sister to rehab on the spur of the moment. Harry actually DID end up in a Scottish rehab centre, and John was helicoptered to Edinburgh and put on a train back to London. An operative of Mycroft’s handed John an overnight bag with clean pants in it – something John would have really appreciated in the hotel!
Next week, a check into how the Omegas are doing at Sherrinford.
As Moran stepped back to survey his work, Sherlock reached out and tugged John’s arm out from under him – his circulation needed to get back to normal as quickly as possible. John had both eyes open now, they were locked on Sherlock.
"The body of a man identified as Terrence 'Taz' Blymore, was found in Olden Road near St. Mary's Church early Saturday morning. The cause of death is unknown pending autopsy, but police on the scene reported that Blymore did not have any visible injuries. A police spokesman declined to speculate whether Blymore's death was related to that of Maxim L. Favreau, a French citizen, who was also found lifeless in the vicinity of St. Mary's three months prior. It was determined that Favreau died of GBH poisoning under suspicious circumstances."
It wasn't until someone knocked on the stall door that John realized he was slumped against it, unmoving.
"Yes! I'm sure." John snapped. "I'm a bloody doctor, remember."
John orgasmed again, nature doing its level best to impregnate the Omega in heat. It shook John to his core as he clung to Sherlock, his lips pressed to the fresh bond bite. The pleasure was profound, and he discovered tears falling from his eyes as he shuddered and shot load after load of his cum inside his sweet Omega.
We stayed like that for a long while. John never seemed to tire of running his fingers gently through my curls. I dozed feeling safe and cared for.
“It isn't safe, John.” Anwen said.
I wake in the pitch dark, vertigo stealing the mattress from under me for a long second. Then it’s there, solid and firm and I am lying in bed. I reach for John… but he isn’t there.
- Yes. Please. -
“What happened?!”
“Mrs. Hudson!”
When the blonde woman’s face turned towards him, nostrils flared, Sherlock wanted to cry. He was so close! Instead, he ran.
“Bloody hell, Mycroft.”
“Of course.” John leaned up and kissed the taller man, pressing against his long body, tugging his collar to pull him closer. They lingered over the kiss.... with a sigh John stepped back. “Where are you going?” He asked.
“Here he said. This will help.” He carefully laid out a line of cocaine and handed me a rolled 100 tenge note. The sight of the drug calmed me, energised me. My weakness and incoordination disappeared. I took the tenge in determined fingers and bent to the line, snorting it quickly.
