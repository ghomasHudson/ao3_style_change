“Hey, are you alright-”
Maybe he finally fell asleep after powering through three nights straight?
A simple idea, something he never actively thought about in the past, but one that brings some flicker of hope back that he grabs tightly with both hands. Quickly Peter gets another cup, a larger one, and fills it with the hot, dark liquid, before he prepares it the way his dad loves and pops always disapproves of. Then he rushes off towards the labs, absolutely sure of his whereabouts this time, and forgets his own cup on the counter beside the note.
It’s not good (never again), but it takes the edge off of the too bright sun scorching them. It makes the wind a little harsher, rougher, not this soft breeze nipping at the strands of hair hanging into his eyes and comforting his face the way
He can fully understand him, more than anyone else out of the Avengers, since he was there from the beginning on and saw every cruel, dirty detail, but Tony needs to realize what he does with lashing out at his loved-ones, once he lets himself drop into one of his moods they tried to get rid of years ago; once Pepper decided he wasn’t worth the pain and worry.
And there it is again.
In the following silence he hears Nate shifting his weight to stare at him fully. For several seconds Peter watches a young girl exit the diner with her mother, before he finally caves in. Maybe it’ll help him convince Nate that they
He knows it makes sense. During weekdays he stays at the tower, close to the school and his friends, on weekends he drives out to the facility to see his family. He doesn’t have a problem with that, he really doesn’t, but after the drama around this Sokovia mess started –
He freezes.
Another thought enters his mind, fleeting and nearly gone, before Peter perks up and goes with it despite knowing that it isn’t the best of ideas. Not at the moment. But if there is even the chance of radioactivity being involved, if there is a chance for his uncle to help him…
A shiver runs down his spine.

They could be anywhere on the planet. Literally. Even if he finds out their whereabouts, how is he to get there? Charter a private jet from his dad? Sure, great idea, maybe he’ll ask him to come along while he is on it.
“So you have nothing yet?”
Nate stays silent and in the way his eyes focus in on him he seems to know exactly what Peter is talking about.
Nate remembers his conversation from before all to vividly. His eyes seem to darken and for once he pulls Peter with him and leads the way instead without further comment.
idea what this is about, so stay out of it.”
He’ll probably notice something is up the second Peter asks about their whereabouts, but then again he seemed to mentally be far away yesterday and absolutely determined not to say a word to him. And since Tony is being Tony, it would only make sense for Peter to look for some answers elsewhere, wouldn’t it? With everyone gone, the only logical way is to go to Rhodey for some unbiased answers...
“And obviously as mischievous as your father.”
“You mean the whole-“
“He has been… different. Of course he has been after all that has happened, which I still only know half about I think, but… I tried to talk to him, I went to his lab, patient and all of that, but-“ the shattering of the cup still echoes in his mind and he has to hold himself back from flinching at the emotional pain hitting him head on, while he continues.
They can’t have abandoned him without a word, they can’t have just-
With a shake of his head Nate refuses to answer straight away and chooses a free parking spot in front of a run-down diner. When the engine dies down and Peter is still staring at him in irritating stubbornness (he perfected it somewhere between overprotective parents and being invisible to the outside world), Nate finally returns his look with one he is unable to decipher.
? How is Pops? Why?!
“Mr. Hogan is calling you, sir. Shall I put him through?”
It’s a long shot, but willing to take every seemingly plausible explanation to whatever the hell is going on, Peter takes it as serious as possible while scrambling to his feet to survey the damage.
Irrelevant. Just keep breathing. In and out. And another. In and out. In and out.
There are countless rumors, more than Peter has listened to in the past week and less than what could help him make sense of it all. Maybe he should have actually paid attention to the gleeful newscaster or his classmates’ whispered words. Maybe he should have addressed the topic way sooner and not turned a blind eye towards it all, hoping they would solve it themselves as they usually do.
And then it turns, shifts and he is left with a weird tingling in his neck that puts him more on edge than seeing his parents fight a seemingly indestructible opponent named Ultron on national TV.
“I left to get back my life.”
“Let’s go.”
The thought scares him so much that he takes a hasty step forward and clears his throat, if only to get rid of the oppressing silence that hangs over their heads like a scythe. No music is being played, he notices belatedly, but before he can give it more thought, his father freezes in front of the computer display projected into the air and turns to him with a scowl on his face.
Nate heaves a deep sigh, looks towards the sky for some unknown guidance, before he returns Peter’s stare and opens his mouth for a final reply.
“I… I made you coffee.”
“For all I care that piece of-“
“Over my dead body.”
At the end of the corridor he currently wanders through is the entrance to the IT-department. One whose employees should be safe and sound back home. With a short look over his shoulder he begins to run in barely concealed excitement towards the open doors. They don’t have to be locked somewhere as safe as here, right?
So yes, he is going to go straight to his bickering parents, knock them over their heads and then carefully inform them of his little problem, whatever it might consist of really. At least he didn’t rip the door out of its hinges upon entering the car, nor did he stick to anything else since the fridge incident. If it weren’t for the vivid images in his mind, he might think about having imagined it all due to some fever rush.
The sarcastic tone doesn’t want to fit to the memory playing inside of his head and pulls him back into the harsh reality rather painfully. For several seconds he stares at the unfamiliar buildings in front of him, before it all comes back and he turns to Nate with a frown on his face.
what his employees so casually chat about, instead of telling him what he obviously needs to know.”
And all they have in common in the foul mood that lingers in their eyes and haunts Peter as if he is the reason for their unspoken misery.
“Sure,” he answers the mechanic voice (it’s not real, no matter how hard his dad tries) and finally stands up to stretch his aching muscles. Maybe he should have gone to bed the evening before, maybe he shouldn’t have stayed on the couch glaring at the muted news in his miserable state, but…
He misses it. A lot.
An idea enters his mind, short-lived when he thinks about it for a second, because if someone online would even have a hint of their true whereabouts, Peter would be able to visit his dad in a high-security prison right about now.
Maybe he does.
His father nods positively in Bruce’s direction, before his eyes roam back to his son. Internally he curses. If he sees it coming from a mile away, he will stop him before Peter takes so much as a step onto the platform. Look away, come on, just one glance…
“I am so sorry,” the young waitress blabbers, as she kneels down at Peter’s side to wipe up the rest of his coke. For an awkward moment her shoulder-length hair gets in the way and blond strands land in his face, which results in him nearly hitting her in the face, before both of them break out laughing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony has his head buried in his hands – a safe indicator that he really fell asleep in the middle of brooding, but his bouncing knee is telling otherwise. And then there is something glimmering to his right. Shards are sprinkled over the floor beside the doorway, directly under a dark, wet spot on the wall.
The typical frown on his mentor’s face is deeper than usual, not as dark as it was the evening before, when worry had accompanied his every step, but not as easy-going as Peter has learned to live with at the tender age of nine.
Of course he knows the answer – it couldn’t be more obvious, even for someone who doesn’t know Tony behind the fortresses of walls he pulled up somewhere in between begging his father to love him and losing his mother. But he asks him anyway like he always does, when Tony needs to say it out loud to
With renewed resolve that he desperately tries not to show, he barely nods and then grabs Nate’s hand to pull him with him in the opposite direction. They need to get out unseen – impossible with the amount of cameras in the facility – but some places...

to be around here.
“Bits and pieces. What the others told me about.”
Peter doesn’t jet around the world in first class seats and airplanes with his family, since they successfully managed to somehow keep him out of the press with sneaky entrances and a lot of bribery on dad’s part, but Peter genuinely doubts they’ll fit in there with Henry’s broader statue, who seems oblivious of their upcoming doom.
He needs this, maybe more than dad does.
Tries.
And there it is, the opening Rhodey has been waiting for since he woke up in a hospital to a physically and emotionally beaten best friend that refused to loose the bottle in his hand and just
The temperature seems to fall below the freezing point and together with it his hopeful thoughts.
“You have
“Everything. My mind. Peter… Steve.”
MY-GOD!
Will this be the new thing now between them? Instead of greeting his son the second he comes close to the labs, even if his target has been another, and pulling him in to tinker and quirk and test until Steve comes to get and chide them without really meaning it… this? A future with his broken father, who locks himself away for hours with no end and forgets there was a family to fight for once before stupid arguments and thick-headed minds.
, which is a complete one-eighty to how queasy his empty stomach felt just hours before.
A sarcastic snort pulls him out of his observation and back to their talk, when the one with the familiar laugh lets his name drop in a way that pulls at his stomach uncomfortably.
Friday’s confirmation is followed by a voice that unwinds his tense frame for a moment, until Peter realizes that it is his voicemail. But seeing as his uncle is god knows were doing god knows what, it’s probably the best he will get at the moment, so he frantically thinks of how to begin, while getting ready at the same time (because Happy can’t get into the kitchen and see the damage, otherwise Tony will know
“What-“
“I doubt that. He has always been very adamant about your whereabouts and he will be especially now.”
And a little bit afraid, if he is being honest with himself.
“Peter, honey?”
With a grunt the guy falls silent beside Nate, ignores him for a minute until they arrive on a strung-out field on the outskirts of the small town, before he turns a skeptic eye back on Nate. “Of what kind?”
He won’t get it, won’t listen to it, and even
Maybe he’ll laugh in his face, when Peter asks him to come back home.
The short moment of silence increases Peter’s nausea, as the other two obviously give their companion a silent, long stare. He is not. His dad would never-
Nate stiffens beside of him.
“I think I told you to rest?”
His tight voice and the barely audible whisper make Rhodey close his eyes. Of course he feels the pain. How can he not?
This time however he is faced with utter silence, which feels so strange and alien to him, that he considers asking Happy. Multiple times his eyes flicker to his driver, while they finally leave New York City behind to enter its much quieter outskirts on their way to the facility, but something with him is obviously off.
“Peter-“
There is that tone he absolutely resents. The one he only ever used at the VA, counseling and connecting and
“It doesn’t have to be, if you two would just get over your big egos!”
For several seconds he keeps quiet though. Watching his father work, lost to the world and in one barely anyone can truly follow… Tony Stark is a marvel and mystery all the same. It’s not the first time Peter watches him silently, it’s not the first time Peter is eager to join him in his projects and throw in some suggestions from time to time…
“If you don’t follow me, I’ll tell
The scowl disappears, the tight grip around the tool in his hand loosens and then he seems to deflate, before he comes over with long steps to pull Peter into his arms. The soft kiss onto his scalp blows the upcoming fears away without effort and for the first time since Peter entered the Avengers facility yesterday, breathing in and out seems less heavy.
The look in his father’s eyes changes, with one move he seems to grow in front of him to an intimidating figure he doesn’t recognize. The genuine anger in his voice and the fury in his eyes scare Peter to death. But before Tony realizes, before Peter can take a literal step back to defuse the situation-
Peter shouldn’t be ungrateful – after all Nate actually got him out of there – but he can’t help the frustration slowly building up. By the time they’ll leave the country for real (if Nate is actually willing to go through with that and not just wasting time to contact his dad), Tony will find them one way or another. They should go as long as they still can, while his father broods away in his lab.
He hates himself for the audible tears in his voice, he hates himself for showing him how much this hurts, but it is what finally gets through to his father.
To get rid of the tight squeeze in his chest, Peter tries to focus on his other, more emotionally distanced problem.
“Sounds like you are talking about Loki,” he mumbles with a shudder and the loud laugh he is rewarded with breaks the awkward tension in the air. For the moment.
“Come on,” third guy laughs highly, “he’s not dangerous, he is his dad.”
to him.
He means both of his fathers, but only one is able to face his anger, and the simple reminder of what he has lost, of what is no more in their future, makes him give in to the fear bubbling right under his skin. He tries to hold the tears appearing in his eyes back, but with every word they become more and more audible in his shaking voice, which grows quieter and quieter.
“What are you talking about?”
This is wrong, it can’t be-
For the first time this morning his dad looks at Peter. Really
It is obvious what he wants to talk about, so Peter doesn’t give him the chance to do so, when he only just pushed his doubts and fears aside to motivate himself for what lies ahead of him. Quickly he unbuckles the seatbelt and jumps out of the car with a cheerful “Don’t worry, Happy, this’ll be fixed sooner than the stupid fridge.”
“We need to get pop- he needs Steve back. Even if he wants to rip his head off right about now. And if I’m honest I need him, too.”
His voice is barely audible. The pit in his stomach deepens as he leans against the doorframe.
“Yes,” he hears coming out of his mouth. He flounders, unable to close his

The shower water stopped. Steve usually didn't wrap his bottom half in a towel if he was in the tower. But today was different. He closed his eyes and dried his head. He walked to the edge of his bed. He couldn't stop smelling his Tony. He couldn't get Tony's scent out of his brain. Maybe it was a mix of emotions that pledged him. But in his mind Tony was his, His mate. Steve slapped himself on the face. He knew it was wrong to claim Tony. Even if Tony did kiss his face. Should he apologize? Yeah! 'apologize' to tiny tony. He heard a soft whimper in the distance. He finally opened his eyes. It was Tony. They both had a pregnant pause. Tony didn't say a word, but Tony didn't move either. Steve grabbed his clothes and then went into the bathroom again. He closed the door before he quickly fumbled to put on some presentable clothes. He tripped over himself putting on his pants. Then he walked out with his clothes on his body. He looked over to the Omega still in the males room. They both said each other's names in unison. They waited a while before they finally said in unison "I'm sorry" Steve scoffed at the male and then smiled a bit. He adored Tony.  "For what? For what" he smiled before hovering his hand over to pet the Omega. He leaned in when he got the permission from Tony with a soft nod that it was okay. Then he softly ran his hand through Tony's curls. Tony leaned into the touch and just purred. Steve lifted his legs m onto his bed. He laid on the covers and watched as the Omega swam in his blanket. He pulled his hand out of Tony's hair which made Tony give out a soft whine. He looked up at Steve to see the male stretch. Steve went back to petting the male. Softer than before. Tony laid his cheek on the alphas leg. He nuzzles his face into Steve. Steve broke the silence "is it that bad being out of the lab tones" Tony naturally didn't answer. He just clinged onto Steves pants. He softly nodded his head. "You could override the command captain" he said as he glared at Tony. "I know, I'm sorry" Tony rolled his eyes and then softly said "you're not" Steve scoffed and said "you're right I'm not". Tony and Steve fell asleep like that. Steve affectionately playing and patting Tony. And Tony holding onto Steve like he was the only thing he ever needed.
How diiid Tony get in there?😳 And where did Stevie sleep
His eyes widened at the sight. Natasha decided to scream at the top of her lungs just to see if they would respond. They did, Steve held Tony closer to his chest and growed. He saw a smug face on Bucky then realized exactly what he was doing in the first place. He let go of Tony and then lowered his head.  It was an embarrassing moment for Steve. The super soldier freed his arms and then said "om- Tony I'm sorry" stark rolled his eyes and acted as if he was fine. He kissed the man's cheek quickly before saying "buy me dinner first Rogers." He got up and went straight to the elevator. Steve sat up and stayed in the spot of the 'accident'. Bucky and Natasha both looked at the male with an elementary school grin. "Ooooooo" Natasha said as Clint walked in and joined in on the teasing. Clint didn't know what was going on but that sure as hell didn't mean he couldn't make fun of it. He looked at Bucky innocently and then steve. "Stevie and Tiny sittin in A tree" Clint widened his eyes as he knew what to say now. "Ooh this is my favorite game! K.i.s.s.i.n.g!" He sang along. He went to go sit down on the couch and Natasha gave Steve a hand. Steve huffed and then thanked Natasha. He was extremely flustered. He stiffly walked to the kitchen and drank a water bottle. He lingered at the kitchen with the water.
And Steve is what he wanted.
Does Tony remember why his heart beat like this? Does he remember, when he warmed up to Steve like this? Nope. It was a long time ago, nearly as long as he could remember the first appearance of the star spangled man in his life.
"Hm?".
Bucky kinda got the picture already but he just wanted to strike up a conversation. Steve gleamed up as he started to answer. "S-so his robot" Bucky tilted his head as he looked at Steve answer him "robot? You mean apartment?" Steve blinked for a minute before he chuckled and said "yes the apartment, he, he's been in there for about a week, so, so I"
Stark was supposed to be taking the day off. He was leaning on a coffee table grumbling. He was using a notebook to scribble out ideas. He was sulking. Nothing made Tony's mood better. Steve lifted Tony's arms, and picked up the crumbled papers with his free hand. Tony whined a bit as he began to bitch "It's been a day!" He grumbled before crumbling the papers up "it's been 12 hours, and I was assigned to keep the lab locked for you and banner till the 72 hours are up." Tony huffed as a year rolled down the man's face. He was frustrated, upset, and bored. He was even considering helping Steve with his cleaning.
A little salute as he was sprawled out on the floor. His eyes closed, The alpha with his arms open to accept whatever harsh fate the males 'best friend' was going to give the male. "Till the end of the line" was a saying that fostered in Tony's head as his heart dropped. Tony Stark knew he shouldn't have watched the footage from a typical avengers fight. But something, somewhere in his brain he wanted to look back at it.
"Steve?" Tony whined out.
So what do people do whenever they feel almost replaced? Talk about it? Demand attention? No!! They lock themselves up in a lab and ignore society until further notice. Tony delved deep into his work, so deep that he didn't even notice what day it was. Tony worked until he passed out on the lab table. It was all a blitz, maybe a non-existent dream. He fantasized about a certain man kissing his head.
"Till the end of the line soldier"
Tony Stark idolized the man. Tony Stark had his first heat just thinking about the man. Teenage Tony pinned for an alpha' that he knew all too well. Not the star spangled man, but Steve Rogers himself. And did Tony know that his feelings were neutral? No. The way Steven Grant Rogers looked up at Bucky whenever that man said 'stevie' broke tony's heart even more. Tony couldn't get over the fact that Bucky was the new 'tony' too Steve. Or was always the 'tony' to his Steve.
Tony rested his eyes as he nuzzled more into the pillow he hugged. He felt more comfortable than he has in a while. Before he got into the sublime he forced his eyes open. "Jar-" before he could finish the sentence, or world the a.i responded "it's 11:45am master you've approximately slept for 8hours and 56minutes" It felt like magic, Tony didn't want to get up. He purred slowly as he rubbed the pillow way too much. He just stayed in the bed, the bed of his Comrade, his peer, his 'friend's bed. Tony broke his own heart on that last part. His 'friend's. He laid in the bed wondering about what exactly Steve was doing at this time. He just fell asleep peacefully again.

of him.
“Shit, shit, shit,” Bucky’s chanting as he hops in a circle, trying to get his arms through his own coat without losing the rest of his drink in the process. “I’m outta here on that one,” he continues inexplicably, clapping Steve on the shoulder and sending a sorrowful glance in reply to Steve’s hands raising in question. “Nice knowing ya, pal.”
Steve presses forward before Tony can realize what he’s doing and comes to his senses. He crowds Tony close, tightening his own arms around Tony’s middle, and their lips are parting and everything is coming together into one sweet, agonizing glide. He groans into Tony’s mouth, feels Tony lips curling up at the edges in return, and dives as far as he can into what he distantly recognizes as the best kiss he’s ever had.

made DUM-E.”
Everyone in the room besides Ty erupts into cheers, and Tony pulls him down for yet another lingering kiss, his thousandth tonight and the beginning of many more to come. Steve holds Tony even closer as their friends come up to congratulate them, heart as full as the first Viking to ever step foot on the moon.
“I can find no substance or other plausible cause, sir. Do you want me to contact-“
“Tony-“
Maybe he is relieved to finally have time for the values he holds dear without having to care for a troublesome teenager every weekend.
Now it is all gone, lost. No more laughter in the morning from the kitchen, when his parents were oblivious to his presence; no more quiet nights on the couch, when they were too comfortable to leave the arms of their loved ones; no more kisses onto his scalp he squirmed under but secretly craved for.
“I’ll be back in just a moment,” Pops promises with that steady voice of his. Peter has no clue how he does it. But instead of just taking it for what it is, a quiet reassurance for his grieving son, Peter acts up. Because it couldn’t be further from the truth. “No, you won’t.”
“Exactly,” Nate confirms happily and flips another switch, until the lights turn on. With a nervous glance through the window in front of them Peter checks whether Henry is already on his way back.
He doesn’t understand how that last hug haunts him, how he wakes up crying and screaming because he can’t remember the position of their arms, how close his father pulled him, how shaky his voice sounded, how there might have been a subdued
The last thing he sees is the terrified look in his father’s eyes, before they disappear.
It’s messy and
“Exactly.”
“Peter, baby-“
“So, will- are you around anytime soon? You know, the new Avengers facility is really coming along,” he begins and feels the bitterness bubbling up in his throat, unable to keep it away, “It’s great. Actually it is so awesome, that everyone is living there now. I know right? Except for when they are gone for stupid missions, which is – oh, wait – all the damn time. And the labs, I can’t even- it is as if dad messed them up on purpose or something, but that doesn’t make any sense because he is hanging out there all of the time now. And I’m stuck here in the tower, you know I would really appreciate some company fro-“
Bending over he clutches the handle of the door and breathes in a deep gasp, while his senses are being flooded by
“It’s just you and I, buddy.”
“I won’t.”
“At least tell me where we are going and what this actually is about.”
Then he slowly walks over to pick up the pieces. One by one.
With desperation he grabs at it, but the more he does, the more his doubts return.
“Wait, is this some ‘I’m secretly siding with the other team’-stuff, because then I’m so out of this conversation-“
The web shoots out from the little machine hidden on his wrist and straight for the control panel. He knows he has hit his target, when Bruce’s curse mingles with those of Sam and Bucky. They are close, too damn close when he can feel Bucky grasping for the hood of his sweater and barely missing it, as he takes a jump onto the illuminated platform. The small vial of red sand grows uncomfortably warm in his hand, but it all becomes insignificantly unimportant, when two broad hands clutch his arms and pull him close to Pops’ chest in a protective embrace.
Before Rhodey is able to limp his way forward to Tony’s side and check whether he drank himself into a coma or not, he begins to notice multiple things though, as the pain finally ebbs away for some precious seconds.
And he can’t sleep. Can’t eat. Can’t take a single step.
So besides a small pillow he always takes for longer journeys and a notebook, he grabs some spare money together with some pens with the familiar Stark Industries company logo to keep himself busy. A map would be good as well, Peter muses and starts roaming through old issues and books, since he won’t be able to take his phone with him. Tony would track it in a minute and the least Peter needs is for his father to follow him, before he is able to find pops wherever-
“No, definitely not!”
Disdain slowly crawls across his face, half of it hidden behind his arms crossed on top of his knees, as his eyes fall on the rays of sunshine brightening the warm summer day outside the window. Inside –
…the thought isn’t so far-fetched, is it? Especially regarding a soldier whom a whole life has been stolen from by circumstances he could have evaded one way or another.
Oh god, he is staring at him, there is the familiar frown on his face Steve always punishes him with, when he knows exactly that Peter is full of bullshit-
Distinctly familiar.
Should Peter have returned home sooner? Should he have paid more attention to the rumors? Because no matter how crazy, a germ of truth is always hidden beneath the mockery of shallow people, who rip lives apart in live shows for money and power.
For the first time he seems to acknowledge Peter’s silent presence behind of them. Before the scowl on his face can deepen any further in obvious curiosity and suspicion, Nate puts himself in between them and refuses to budge.
He doesn’t even comment the broken fridge door, as they bypass the kitchen on their way to the elevator.
“Maybe someone should get him away for some time. Back to New York, ya know? If I remember half the shit Stark pulled back then…,” first guy throws in again, while their voices grow even louder. How in the-

“It is Saturday morning, 9:04 a.m.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A little note is stuck to the fridge and eager for the distraction of his troublesome thoughts, Peter steps closer to take a look. It’s from Rhodey. Nothing unusual, he has to go into town for an appointment, but that he felt the necessity to let him know makes him feel raw and unreasonably angry at him (another part is glad, so glad; not another person that abandoned him yet again).
“Help!”
“What the-“, Peter mumbles with a frown on his face and puts the bought sandwich aside on the counter to take a closer look at the spot between his palm and the door. Nothing sticky, no spilled juice, no super-glue due to one of the teams’ pranks, since he is still alone as one can be in a city filled with millions of uncaring people.
Some stay to talk for a bit, others fleetingly greet him and then rush off.

not a proper explanation, but he can’t bring himself to tell an employee of all people about the dirty details. Even if Nate seems to be the only chance he has at the moment to get his dad back. Both of them, actually.
Because the media is going crazy, accusations and worst case scenarios are thrown out from exclusive morning shows to dubious tweets. He knows most of them are bullshit, his fathers are probably laughing about the insanity of it all together at the facility right now, waiting for him to come home, but if they are not, if things are really, really bad between them (worse than the whole Ultron fiasco)…
“Your da- Steve is about to go.”
“And for once I have no fucking clue how to fix it.”
“It’ll only be a blink of an eye for you, I promise.”

A short and shrill laugh escapes his throat, but it does nothing to erase the lingering feeling in his stomach, nor does it ease the tension in his shoulders.
“Here we are,” the unexpected voice from the front seat pulls him out of his thoughts and with surprise Peter looks out of the window over the large compound. They have already arrived?
“Nah, he still has the kid around. He’ll be fine in time,” a third voice argues and carefully Peter leans forward. Nothing. Where the heck are they?!
In the back of his mind he knows pops won’t take it, that he won’t be reachable via his number anymore, but he can’t stop, if Peter stops there is no way for him to fix this mess of a life. And if he can’t fix it, if there is no way-
A battle plan.
The words of the emotionless newscaster echo around in his mind, again and again and again-
“Peter, kid?”
obviously.
“How much we screwed up?”
The fear is solely mobilizing him. Pushing himself up he has to lean against the wall in his back for a moment to let the blood rush into his head. Sam hovers beside him, worried and with a hand outstretched in case he crumbles again like he did during the funeral. He doesn’t and instead pushes past his uncle, eyes still on the ground and hood pulled deep over his face to hide from the world. At least a little bit, if he is being forced to face it.
“You- You need to help me! Please!”
“No, of course not!” he exclaims with all the surprise Nate’s question leaves him with, while he finally turns around to glance at his older companion. “He never would.”
“He has barely any left,” he mumbles instead with some pity for farmer-guy, because apparently Nate has been some Flash-on-steroids-kind-of-kid, if Henry’s remarks are anything to go by.
“Not happening if you’re already fired due to you bitching about him with your little friends and siding with Captain America.”
He melts into his father’s embrace and closes his eyes.

The shivering starts again.
With quick steps he rushes off to his room, oblivious of his father’s call and on a whim that quickly takes over his mind.
The inaudible sigh of relief is still easily detectable in his friend’s and mentor’s voice, as Peter roams through the filled fridge, one hand on the handle, the other on a package of cheese. True, he has been feeling like death warmed over after the end of the school trip to Oscorp, but at the end it was a simple cold that came and went just as quickly. No need to worry.

Natasha and Bucky were coming up from the gym. Bucky was holding onto an ice pack. He was Proud? Yes proud of being beaten up by Natasha. Bucky was smiling like a dweeb holding ice onto his wound. Natasha stopped in her tracks and raised her hand. It stopped Bucky from talking all together. They both walked to the mass that was huddled up next to the couches. They got close and saw the sight. They smelled the overbearing scent of oakwood and cinnamon.
Modest and simple, the bed was extremely soft, the scent was somehow extremely intoxicating. Tony allowed himself to lay back into the bed. His back hitting the soft pillows and comforter. The scent of oak wood and cinnamon was all familiar to Tony. "Steve…" he mumbled out  affectionately.

Tony walked into his floor. He softly panted before Rolling his hands in his hair. He gripped it softly before yanking on it. "Shit-" Tony blew some air through his teeth, and laughed. Tony went into his bathroom to check the damage Steve had done. Tony looked at the rim of his slick filled pants and just yelled. He smiled through the ugly yell. He slipped his bottoms off. He threw them at the wall and then started to pick out some sweatpants and boxers. He cleaned himself up. Tony then began to look at the wall. He was bored and annoyed. He couldn't get that stupid alpha out of his head. What was even more annoying is the fact that he couldn't get the smell of hi- the alpha out of his brain. Tony yelled once more and then puffed out his chest. He decided to do what he wanted today.
Unacquainted feelings.
Tony was acting hostile with Bucky in the first few weeks. Bucky went to pay the other soldiers back as he sat on his right. Steve calmed down by then. Steve was just leaning into the affection that he was receiving from Bucky. "So tell me about the stark '' he hummed out as he looked at steve. Steve's eyes lit up as he looked at Bucky. "He's, he's honestly so dang cool Bucky'' Steve went on about the male. Bucky just pet Steve and let his friend go on about how much he was infatuated with him. But did Steve know of his own feelings towards the stark. Steve went out to go to the gym on the lower floors. Bucky went to go relax a bit more. Bucky pondered what the other male was doing so long in Steve's room. Sleeping maybe? He decided to break the peace. Bucky walked up to the door and knocked on it. He waited a bit before walking into the room. He saw the stark wrapped in Steve's clothes. His cold heart was melting at the sight. What did his friend do to deserve this? Bucky knew the answer, he was Steve and Steve deserved the world. Bucky heard Tony's breathing pattern change. He knew Tony was up. "Stark you up?" He said as the male mumbled something under his breath "Tiny you know that I see you up" he said as he pushed Steve's shirt off of Tony. Tony quickly grabbed the shirt and glared at Bucky. Once again Tony failed at looking "threatening" Bucky sat by Steve's bedside not saying much. They didn't speak at all really, but Bucky enjoyed their silence. It was like he was giving a shovel talk to his new brother-in-law. But the tension with less tense and the words weren't verbally exchanged. Bucky hummed and then said "I know your secret'' Tony's eyes widened as he looked at Bucky. Almost as if he had a 'secret' to begin with. "you're mad at me" Tony eased up as he heard the male talk. He was Honestly mad at the male. What did he do? Other than taking care of h- their Steve, and, there it went. Was he mad? Bucky chuckled softly as he watched tiny scramble for an answer "let me rephrase that, you're not mad. You're jealous" Tony didn't say his face said more than anything. Bucky chuckled as he got the answer he was looking for "What I don't understand is why he's kept you waiting, hmm?" He said as he lowered his hand down to Tony's face. Bucky was surprised that Tony let him pet him in the first place. Tony was actually relaxed. He let out a soft purr. "Ayo Tiny tell me when you guys need some time okay?" The male calmed down Tony so much. Tony closed his eyes, Bucky gave off the same Aura as Steve. He smelled like burned pine wood and chestnuts. The first word he spoke to Bucky that day was "it's Tony not tiny" he said as he pouted subconsciously. Bucky gave off a little smile as he got sassed by his brother's wife. "I know what I said." Tony scoffed and then punched the male petting his hair. "Whatever jerk"
After Bucky and Tony's 'talk' the day went on very average. Bucky training with Natasha in the gym for entirely too long, and Steve being the most domestic alpha ever. Not like it was a complaint. Steve took pride in this tidiness. Steve was brought up as a Omega. He was sick as a child for a long time. So when his 10th birthday rolled around the elders in the community began treating the boy like a Omega. He believed that he was Omega too. But if he could go back in time he wouldn't change the way he was raised. He knew more things than the average alpha like how to sew or how to knit. It was more manlier in the army to know how to sew than to die in the cold. So yeah, he did take pride in knowing how to cook, clean, and sew.
Steve hit Clint before he got up and went over to the couch "fuckouttahere" he loudly said as his voice cracked. Clint chuckled in amusement before saying or rather imitating a rather stern Rogers "language young man were you raised in a barn?". He accomplished his job and he saw how red and upset the captain was. Clint finished his food, and crawled back into his vents. He went to go see if he could bother someone else. Or rather just sneak on the conversation. Bucky wasn't slow, he was adding up on the behavior of stark and Steve. It made so much more sense on why
"I missed you too ace" Bucky said as Steve looked at the food and a soft tint of red was faintly present from the embarrassment. Bucky watched as the male ate the eggs. He leaned Onto the table as Steve shoved some eggs into his mouth. He waited a few seconds before he
Something The Omega had to leave behind. It's like everyone in their life's has had a crush of three on Captain America. But there is only one of them who will always catch the captains eye.

Steve was giving Bucky attention. He has for the last few weeks they recruited him. He was his only friend, his best friend, his brother for a long time. How could Rogers not be clingy to the male? How could Rogers not hang onto Bucky's every word? The last time he left Bucky hanging,, well now they're here in the present.
Chapter two
"Goodbye Stevie~" he said as he giggled and got up. He took a shirt and then quickly changed into the shirt he stole from Steve. He left his shirt on the door knob and left out. He went to go see if there was food. He luckily smelled someone in the common area cooking
Steve was almost finished cleaning up the common area. The work went by so well while he was watching Tony pace the floor. Steve looked at Tony for a bit before going into his room. He softly chuckled he thought about the male getting wined out of shape about a lab free day. Steve took a shower. He put on some normal clothes and saw the little distraught Omega looking at the wall. His stomach did a little flip. Was Tony hurt? He walked closer to the male, and then eased up as he saw Tony just staring at the wall. Steve decided to push the boy. Tony made a little squeak as he fell onto the floor. Tony laid there and began some dramatic antics. "aaahh" he softly said as he pouted. "Captain Steven issa bully" Steve chuckled, his mischievous  smile reached his face. "Is the lab the only thing the nerd has going for himself? Hm?" Tony sat back up and glared at the male. "What kind of question is that? Of course" Tony used all of his force to push the male down.
