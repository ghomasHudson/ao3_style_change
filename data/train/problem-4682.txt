"Ok ok, whatever so you gonna tell it or what," She said in a very low making Dean chuckled, he knows Charlie can't hold it when it's come to secrets.
Wow, Castiel Never thought he will talk to Dean like this, that he will comfort Dean like this ever but here he is, trying to make Dean feel better like they are some besties. But hey Dean deserved that after what he did tonight. It's kind of a brave thing to do with guilty thoughts or not.
"Okay fine. But there is not much to say. one day....." Castiel started to say everything happened since his and Dean's first meeting.
"Dean Dean Dean, c'mon man. You don't need to be rude like that, I was going to giving you a chance to fuck that kid, as I know you can't keep it yourself, you just want to ruin the kid, aren't you now De.." Azazel couldn't have time to finish as Dean jump and punched on his face so hard. Alastair and Raphael grabbed Dean yelling to stop. Azazel touched his bleeding lips and spat.
So Dean trying another smooth plan and it's succeed. But he got to know another unexpected information and it's kinda broke him. But he shouldn't be like that. He only have to focus on his bet. But what's happening to him?
"4th, I really want to fix everything and to make a new friendship, 5th I owed you one for my mom and I can't tell you how much I'm grateful for that, 6th I just want to make it up to you, so I'm begg..." And suddenly Dean got interrupted by Cas at that point.
"Yeah, but this is all my fault, he just tried to help me, but I left him, arrr I'm a such an asshole I'm not a good friend" Kevin started his cry again.
Dean got changed to his practice attire but still, he didn't meet anyone of the team. He is not even late today. Maybe the team must gone to the ground already, he thought and jogging to the ground quickly. But to his wonder, no one was there too. Normally when it's coming to practice time Coach Rufus will be there before at least 30 minutes but today even Coach is not there. Strange. Dean rotated another round confusing and then decided to call Michael.
Dean's hands roam all over Cas's soft body, his gorgeous breast is getting bigger and harder as Dean smirks into the kiss. Cas finally pulls out from the kiss when he is lost of air.
Well well, Winchester always knew there was a big secret with you. So here we go. gotcha.
Holy fuck he is fucking cute on my clothes.
"Strange" He mutters.
"Who? That Castiel boy?" Raphael asked.
“Babe look, I’m…” Cas starts but Dean cuts him off.
"But Dean.."
Charlie glared at Dean before slowly leaning in.
"ok ok I will be fine sweetie, don't worry and hey don't do that be nice to your little brother" Mary smiled at him and joined Sam.
Dean and Castiel walked together toward the car park. It's almost late night and the weather was cold a bit.
"By the way did you felt, son? You are so badly wet" Mary asked very sadly trying to wipe some dirt from his hair.
"You?" His voice came like a whisper.
"No Kevin, don't worry I'm okay now," Castiel said to him trying to smile but he failed.
"You bitch open this fuckin door"
..............
"Um, Charlie, I have a question?" Dean said. He spent the entire night thinking about what happened to him that night. He couldn't believe that anyone caught him. Someone caught what he is doing sometimes when he sees Castiel anywhere randomly. Actually, he can't help it, it just happens. Even it's getting a few minutes for him to understand what's going on with him or that he keeps staring. So the only one he could speak with that is Charlie.
"Oh baby you were pouting as hell"
What? Did he really text that he missed me too? Woah. Dean forgot that he was in a middle of an important business meeting as he grinned at the phone like an idiot as Charlie nudged at him causing him to make his face to a business mood again.
" Nope no chance, I'm pretty sure, and I'm guarantee that he is a dedicated virgin" Azazel compromised.
“Hmmm, okay, okay…but I need few days. We will check for five days, then if something happened again, we gonna get an appointment. But if nothing happens in those five days, we gonna forget this psychiatrist thing forever. Deal?” Dean asks and leans again for Cas’s lips.
Sam quickly looked at his Mom. She signed with her eyes as it's okay.
"Ohh, no no please don't call me mam, just call me Mary. I'm Mary. Um.Mary Campbell"
"What? How? What is it, Gabe?"
"Well, okay go ahead, and then what? you will go out. and I'm gonna follow you everywhere until you agree to listen to me properly," Dean said rubbing his thumb over Castiel's soft back of the hand, loving the soft skin underneath his hand. The action made goosebumps erupted all over Castiel and Dean chuckled softly.
Hope you are well.
Dean cups his lover's face softly then presses his lips to Cas’s soft and warm lips, Dean kisses him so lovingly. After minutes, he fulls out but still presses his forehead to Cas’.
Dean sees red as he was on the edge. He wanted to punch all the members of his gang and tell Castiel to go away from him. But he can't. He just stayed their gritted his teeth.
"Oh my god, yes? Oh god Cas, you said yes? thank you, thank you so much Sweetheart" Dean screamed in happiness, and also Castiel laughed happily.
*Soon after they came to the Castle, Prince Demon Dean started to screw the Tape ball and jumped to Prince Castiel and bullied and mess with our Cute innocent Prince and then Prince Castiel started to cry.
Then Mary let go of his hands caressed his head.
Cas quickly moved away towards Sam's side glaring at Dean. And that exact moment, a huge thunder exploded with a huge noise. It's kind of made their ears locking and Cas starlet like a little kid.
"Shutup Gabe, you are not helping here" Castiel showed his older brother away from him and stepped toward the rose bouquet. He touched the beautiful rose petals with awe.
"Yeah, I know. So Cas, I think I should go now, and hopefully see you soon?" Dean asked glancing at his watch.
"Look at your beautiful hole Cas, all juicy and well opened. Getting fucked by my tongue. Mmmmmmm I'm dying to insert my fingers inside it baby, and I know you will enjoy it like you never did with your own fingers" Dean said slowly running his one finger towards Cas's pussy hole.
"Ah Dean, he is a freshman, and one of our favorite one," Uriel said grabbing Kevin's shirt.
Teddy was sat on the cement bunt in front of the garden and Castiel sure teddy must definitely higher than him. Hell, right now teddy was sitting but still he taller than Castiel. And teddy was a huge, giant one. Castiel's face completely flushed with embedded and tint of anger.
And then Dean realized that he was supposed to get off of Cas and right now he is crushing Cas. Shit, his body parts are seriously pressed into Cas's body parts and that's not supposed to happen.
Woah, how much alive in that voice when Cas talks to his mom like Cas really loves to talk to her. Not only Mom but also with Sam. But when Cas had to release a one-word out for Dean, he acting like that's the most disgusting job in the world. Dean sighed. No wonder about that though. Cas got reasons and all those reasons made by Dean. So Dean deserved it. And hell, he is literally planning to fulfill his bet over Cas. So there's no need for more examples. But actually, was Dean really going on with his bet? Or he is losing control of his deepest desires over Cas. Isn't he slowly breaking his deepest forbids, the deepest secret that he buried deep inside his heart, longtime ago? Dean comes out from his thoughts when Mary's voice came in.
"Yes, and please don't think that I'm overstepping it, but I already told you that I have a friend who knows about ballet a lot. Actually, he is a great dancing instructor and he has a dancing academy. When I asked him how to choose those shoes and stuff he asked me to whom I got those gifts. So I told him about you. Then he told me if you want, you can join his new class which starting in January. Then I thought its a nice idea and you will be surprised. After that I made registration for you" Dean said and see Castiel's face change to a huge smile but with a bit shyness.
......
"Dean... Please just calm down okay, I think no one has seen them but I someone have got the number of the vehicle, so probably the police will catch them soon, so you don't worry about it. And also I'm started to feeling well more than before, I think I have a quick recovery power from my guardian angel"
"Nah, it's not a bih deal Jo, actually it's about this fucking football team, I will take care of them soon" Dean commented stolen a chip from Charlie's plate.
"Yes, true mates, I mean personally it's like a joke to me, I don't believe it, it's just a fairy tale. It's kinda some juicy secret detail for teenager pups, right?" Castiel questions as he wants Gabriel to agree with him eventually. But Castiel regrets asking about it because normally Gabriel would tease him at least for months, remembering about this question.
"Yeah okay you sweetheart"
//how's your meeting? Do you come back today? Or maybe tomorrow?//
Castiel rolled his eyes throwing his keys to the table then removed his trench coat.
"Oh Mary, I'm so sorry, I wish you were there, that night. I missed you, Mary. but Sam told me where you were. So I didn't want to bother you. But I'm sorry. Can I do anything to make it up to you Mary? Please tell me?"
"Okay, then have some drink. please help yourself, there are Coke, beer, and some soda are in the fridge, oh and some lemonade too. it's your first day in my home and please at least have some drink please, because unfortunately, I'm not in a situation to serve you any other way" Dean said sadly, but a mouth full of food.
Before start making eggnogs Castiel noticed that Dean making another thing quickly. After seconds the whole kitchen filled with cocoa smell making Castiel's mouth-watering.
"Yes Mr. Winchester, I'm afraid to tell you that Castiel was gone back home because he got a phone call saying that there is an emergency, so he went home in the morning," She said in a worried voice.
"Woah, Woah, wait a minute Cas, what's the hurry? Hey, by the way, I noticed that you just mistook me for somebody else, right? So who's this person, trying to scare you all the time?" Dean asked and how much he tried to hide his jealousy, it was so obvious and that made Cas filling with more questions.
Jody cried a bit hugging both Dean and Cas telling them they are the best lovers she had ever seen.
"Okay I promise Cas, and, and this means I have a chance? Cas will you go out with me? One date Cas?"
Castile burst out as soon as he saw Dean with the puppy. His eyes went wide but it's shining with excitement as he kept looking at the puppy.
"Thank you, Dean. I'm glad you like it, now please eat"
"Yes, Castiel?"
"Of course I'm not, Lisa, why'd I cry?" Castiel answered not showing any change on his face.
Would it be a sin
Lisa was giving hints to him for weeks now, flirting and bending over tables and pretending to pick up something she dropped when Dean passing by her. Yeah, she is into Dean, so be it. As soon as the last lecture end Dean walked out and started to search Lisa and her gang. It wasn't hard to find her.
So tell me what you think about today chapter?
"dude what's going on? Is everything alright " Charlie got serious this time.
Castiel shivers with that memory. What if Dean tried to say the truth. No, no way, he is just a cunning alpha. I will find the truth soon. He determines quietly as Gabriel continues his answer.
"No Mary no I don't want to go to the hospital" He murmured.
Since a kid, Castiel's favorite toys were teddy bears. He had a good collection of teddies. But he always tried to hide that from society. Only his family knew about that. And with time his passion for teddies went away as he tried to fade it away. But However, Dean found out about that. Or has he guessed it? Very suspicious. Castiel thought about it so much. But he wasn't angry with Dean. Now he felt a bit upset about how he left Dean there. But he can make up to Dean tomorrow. Yes, he will, definitely. He promised to himself.
The four of them decorate the huge tree with loads of ornaments and Christmas decorations.
Both of them were beyond happy tonight. Castiel could swear this is one of his favorite days as he smiled and laughed a lot. And being loved and cared for so much. And Dean protected and saved his honor by doing that romantic singing today. And proved that he is loved and cared for.
"No Dean, I was never been your friend, I'm sorry I lied," Castiel's voice came very weakly and bit his already heavily damaged lips to hold his cry and failed as he started sobbing.
Cas moans, screams, making the most delicious sounds beneath Dean who speed up his thrusts and pounding hard into Cas, each thrusts aiming at Cas’s prostate. Dean’s eyes roll back as he felt his orgasm is rising inside him.
"Oh then it's good, so you wanna join me for lunch Anna?" Castiel offered a friendly way because he could use some human-to-human time after all.
"Anna, I don't have a boyfriend because I don't want one if I want anyone I will find one, and about Mr. Winchester, he is my friend and we even didn't date for once, so how would you say that he left me?" Castiel burst out and Anna stared at him with wide eyes.
"They hide all of the ancient books and documents, written about true mates and soul mates" Gabriel whispers as Castiel's eyes widen with surprise.
"Look, baby, it's not like I'm pushing you okay?. We already got a decision and I promised you that I will wait any longer it takes. I don't care how long that time, but you just take as much as you want. And I'm waiting for you. And I promise you, I will never going to break your heart. I mean it, NEVER. And I don't want anyone else, I just want you" Dean said ducking his head to catch Cas's gaze, his thumb softly caressed on Cas's cheeks comforting him.
"My goodness, but I remember as you have joined into that last war, we faced with them?"
"Oh, those are Castiel's" Dean replied with a matching grin as someone praised his gift.
Dean stopped and then Cas can hear someone tried to breathe very hard like someone hitched his breath. And why Dean stopped talking every once and while?
"It's very nice to meet you Clarence, and I don't know how to thank you for doing that, I mean, dude I really owe you a big time," He said.
"You are unbelievable man Dean, you know?" Castiel asked pushing Dean playfully putting his hand on Dean's chest.
Dean automatically stood up. What the hell Sam was doing. Shit. No Sam is right. Dean wished if he could go there and hug Castiel right now. But he can't. Practically how much his heart shouted at him to go there and took Castiel to his arms and soothe him, to tell him everything is gonna be okay, he can't, he can't do that, at least he didn't have a right to do so. So he just stood there without moving or say something.
Dean was stuck with words. He knew he fucked up.
"Dean, you know you can talk with us right? and you were definitely in a problem, we can see that" Jo sounds a bit sad. She is always very caring about her cousin brother.
"Shut up Dean it's perfect. And of course, you don't need to apologize for yesterday. But because you put your valuable time and effort to bake this delicious looking and smelling, a cute cupcake for me, I'm gonna eat it" Castiel said making Dean more stunned.
He came out of the lift typing a message to Gabriel, letting him know that he is on the way. and didn't give much attention to anything else around him. So that's why he didn't notice the man standing in front of him, few steps ahead in the guest's area.
"Aww, how thoughtful of you my dear, now stop dancing around and tell me what you want this time," She said in a firm voice but smiling with Dean a bit now.
Castiel chuckled softly.
"No, no please don't. I'm sorry for everything Cas. I don't know how to fix my past but I really want to make it up to you, but dunno how to.."
“Me too Cas, cum for me babe… aah I’m right behind you” Dean groans and the next second Cas cries out as he comes with Dean’s name. He eventually clenches his tight rim around Dean’s cock as Dean lost his control.
Then he heard a knock on his door. Castiel's face changed to a question look as he wondered who must be coming right now. Because he doesn't have many visitors, hell he never had any visitors besides Gabriel. even Meg, Adam or Kevin were never came to his house. So who would be this? He thought walking towards the door. If that was the night he would be definitely asked who is this before open the door, but since its daytime, he thought that's not necessary as he slowly opened the door. The next second his eyes go high and he grabbed the side of the door putting his whole weight on it to keep him standing.
Then suddenly Castiel looked at her with begging eyes.
Okay buddy, not a big deal, just find the book and get out of here that's the plan. He just murmured rubbing his palms together as he stepped to the library. The first thing he did was given the Winchester Charmin smile to the librarian then went through all the book racks finding his book until he saw him. Dean just stopped right there and stared at Castiel. Castiel looked so calm, absolutely concentrate on the book, he had no sense about what happening around him. Dean's face lightning up slowly with a soft warm smile quickly to change a soft chuckle as he saw Castiel had held a blue color pencil between his ear and his head. Probably he forgot that he had hold it there. Dean chuckled again. He didn't know what is he doing. He just stared at Castiel and chuckled. Then Castiel decided to that's the perfect time to bit his lips unknowingly what he is doing. It's kind of his habit. When he is doing something interesting he bit his lips unintentionally. But Dean wanted to stop him. damn that soft-looking, pink, and plump lips, getting hardly bit by those teeth. Mmm Dean wanted to do that for him. He just wanted to storm there, grab the kid and kiss the shit out of him. To kiss those pink lips, those broad and pink and already Well-bitten lips. Hell, what the fuck was he doing no no no not again. Every time he gets a chance to glance over this weirdo he did that, just staring at him especially on his stupid lips. But why the hell. I have to get out here, he thought but too late Castiel's ocean blues was aiming at him. He looks scared, and With a thousand times of questioning look on his face. Like what the hell is going on. Dean's eyes got wide. didn't know when he caught up by Castiel. However, he saw him now. He had to run hide or anything, to vanish from here. With that thought, he turned around like a flash and hit on someone. Dean cursed and grabbed the nearest book rack to balance himself.
//Mom, you slapped me//
"Dean, we.. Oh god"
.....
Castiel shouted and sit on the bed, he was shaking and crying. He can still feel the cold in his vines. His whole body was covered with sweat. he just tried to breathe in and out slowly to a rhythm. He started to sobbing slowly. He can't get rid of those nightmares ever. Every day he was suffering from it. He stayed on the bed because he didn't want to go to college it's Saturday. He stayed until his mind is ready for thinking far away from his nightmare. then he figured out he needed something to eat something when he pulled on his pajama pants, they are getting huge for him now. Great, he is getting skinny Because he had used to skip eating and lots of his meals. He sighed and opened the fridge to get something to eat. Awesome there is nothing to eat besides a few spoiled veggies and expired milk carton. He checked the cupboard and luckily his Chocolate Cereal was there, but only a few spoons. But it was satisfied right now. So he figured out that he needs to go shopping for groceries now. Actually, he didn't get any groceries after Gabriel visited two weeks ago. So he ate quickly it without milk. And get ready to go to the shop.
Castiel quickly opened the Dean's gift. His heart started to beat a bit fast. He really wanted to know what is Dean's gift. Finally, he opened the gift box and he gasped when he see it.
One after one came and all the bullies’ team hit Castiel on his cheeks, stomach, and even his hips. Until, Mr. Singer was running into them yelling to stop them. As soon as they saw their swimming coach running towards them the bullies’ team let go Castiel and ran away. Castiel was almost faint but through his swallow eyes he saw Dean glanced at him once and his face was blank no happiness from his win against Castiel, and then next second he joined to the team and ran away.
Finally, they said their byes to Castiel and gone promising will meet again soon.
To be honest Cas always loved and craved for someone to be with him, some friends to hanging out with the whole of his life but right now all he wanted is to be alone.
"SAMM!" very nervous Cas's voice came as soon as Sam burst open the door.
2 The man (Unbelievably handsome) who was covering his mouth with his both hands stood within a flash and tried to come near to Castiel, like a helping gesture, but still laughing.
"Yeah, okay. Thanks. And Cas is doing fine, I mean he is just still don't like to be social a lot, but he is doing fine" Sam said getting his eyes back to the book.
So they reached Gabriel's room and he was so energetic this morning more than yesterday night.
Dean snapped at the door at that same moment to find out Cas was standing there with horror in his eyes. Dean never expected to see him right now or right here, and honestly, he didn't know why he was going to attack this kid, as he just stared at Cas when his heart pounded uneasy way.
"Hmm wish if you there with me as my boyfriend"
"So hello Castiel, I'm your new friend Dean" Dean said dramatically.
"Yes baby"
Castiel never saw him after the elementary school neither Dean. Castiel was walking towards the main Hall finding Meg when someone bumped into him and he is almost falling his back. Next second a very strong hand grab his arm and helped him to get on his feet again.
But Dean can't do this. He can't let anyone see that he cared for the biggest nerd in the college. And helping a gay boy with his panic attack? No. Absolutely no. He can't do that. Hell, he got a reputation to save. With that thought, Dean looked at Cas who was struggled with breathing and turning purple obviously. And the next second Dean stood up on his heels and ran. He ran fast as he can toward the college building.
There was a hesitation before the answer from the other end. And his voice came very deep and kind of shaking.
"Mhhmm mhuum mmhhaauum" Cas trying to say something and Dean still staring at him with a hurtful face.
"Hmm, is that so? But you know you are a huge idiot Cassie, I don't understand what you thinking, you were the same as this since you are a child" Gabriel's voice changed to something pissed tone.
"God Cas, I know what you want and I'm gonna give everything that my omega wants. Mmm so good, my beautiful omega, I'm gonna fill you up so good and I'm gonna fuck that your tight, little pussy so hard..." Dean growlers lowly sucking a mark into Cas's neck, then licking it flat with his tongue.
What's going on? Dean gulped heavily.
“Oh you are killing me Cas, did I mention to you today that how much sexy you are?” Dean asks in a lustful voice and moves his mouth to Cas’s neck and starts to press light kisses there.
I'm happy it's happened💚💙 Destiel is Cannon.❤❤
"Wow that's a brilliant idea, also Mom is not home tonight, yeah I should try that, but... Oh.. That's not gonna work Dean" Suddenly Sam's enthusiastic voice went dull as his face goes down.
We won 😭😭 ❤💚💙❤❤ but the most saddest win ever. 😭😭😭😭😭
"Damn right I agree with you Dean, and hey nice job man you made him happy," Sam said to his brother and Gabe nodded at him.
"Amazing Mom smells so nice," Sam said.
Mary chuckled. She reminded the day they all met. Then she got an idea as she smiled brightly.
"Yes Cas, my love?" Dean's voice is deep and dry.
Dean wanted to sit for the exams. Its been only a week after the join to the college and all he wanted is to do his studies well to make his Mom proud and happy about him, so he wanted to sit for the exam anyway, it was important to him. So he checked the phone to see what time it is, so he can figure out is he still got time to go to the class. Otherwise, he can go with the team.
Castiel chuckled.
Dean winked at him and eagerly opened the wrapping paper without tearing it. Castiel of course had neatly wrapped it. Yeah, classic Cas. Castiel carefully noted Dean even didn't tear it. And after unwrapping he even bothered to quickly fold it and put it aside from him like he is gonna take it with him. Wow, unbelievable who thought this mighty, strong, handsome as hell, flirty Automobile engineer can be sappy like that.
And hey it's Christmas time uhhh so excited 🎄❄💝✨💫☄☃ even I'm a Buddhist I had celebrated Christmas for my entire life, so my lovelies Merry Christmas😄🎄🎁❄🎅
Cas : well, same here. I guess.
sorry for the mistakes. :) have a good day.
"Hey, stop both of you. Sam, I can understand that, but Dean is changed now, besides I also in the house this time, so Cas would be fine with that"
Without conscious Dean slowly leaned toward Castiel's face and Castiel licked his lips.
Ellen is Mary's best friend and cousin sister. That's how Dean and Jo-Adam tweens became cousins, because Ellen is their mom. And most of the time Mary went to see Ellen and help her in their own restaurant, the Roadhouse. And today Mary get a call from Ellen as she got sick and now Mary is going to their house because it's almost Friday so she decided to stay over there to take care of her cousin. She had informed Dean and Sam as they promised that they can take care of their dinner without Mary.
(See the end of the chapter for
stopped a bit but eventually, he shrugged out from Dean's grip.
"Of course looking at....." Azazel intentionally stopped his answering to look between Dean and Castiel grinning this time.
..........
"Dean, son I'm going to the grocery store, do you want anything?" Dean heard Mary asking from the downstairs.
Castiel glanced at Dean and slowly took out the items from the box.
"Oh god, where are my manners, sorry again, I'm Castiel Novak and I really really didn't see you sitting there," Castiel said and held his hand toward Dean who quickly grabbed it and shook it smiling at him. His hand was hard and soft at the same time, with broad palm and long, thick, fingers and it's warm when it's clapped with Castiel's hand.
"Yeah, okay, cool" Dean's voice was nervous too.
He occasionally glanced over the upstairs as he knew Dean's room was there and he couldn't stop little sighs too.
"Okay, okay I'm gonna pretend like that, sorry handsome maybe next time," Gabriel said winning at Sam who chuckled back.
"Well, anywhere I can be near to you as much as I want. And anywhere you can wear it" Dean chuckled and Castiel joined with him.
Castiel tightened her hand who held till now.
"Okay, that's really good Cas. But you don't want to worry about anything now okay?, I'm also here for you" Dean said giving him a smile.
Cas's yells swallow by that and only little moans and whines come out. And because of the shock and, the milk inside his eyes, he can't see properly the man's face but he can see that his face also covering with thick milk as it's now getting clear second by second as milk is pouring down through his face.
"Don't thank me, Dean. So how's your work, I mean your meetings?"
Today also they were sitting just like a normal day. Dean can see the side of Castiel's face. Right now he was holding his pencil into his cheeks. Dean licked his lips before giving his attention to the teacher who started to instruct the assignment.
Is this really going to end now?
Dean presses a kiss on Cas's lips and they go to sleep. Hours pass and suddenly Cas wakes up to the cold bed. Dean isn't on the bed. Cas checks the Time and sees that it's 12.30 Am.
"Why do you even asking? Told you that it's not your business, please leave me alone" Cas said in a calm voice.
"Cas I don't know what happened to me and I just, I just didn't want to people to talk about shit, and god this is so hard to explain man" Dean looked away unable to find the right words to describe what he wanted to, without hurting Castiel. But he didn't know that Castiel already knew what was happened yesterday. Suddenly Castiel started to laugh sarcastically making Dean look at him in a questioning face.
"And even he holds that Angel pup" Charlie, the redhead, female alpha who's Dean's bestie, also adds.
Dean: Cas. Cas I want to talk to you” he said calmly.
As soon as Dean walk passed by the reception he heard Donna the receptionist calling after him.
Cas sighed.
"Oh Mom actually when I got the news I almost forget him but after when I drove here I thought and decided it would be good I came first to see you then I will pick him after his school and then I can bring him to see you, so I came directly here, besides I didn't want to waste any time, just wanted to see you" Dean was still in so pain as his voice came so low.
That's not what they planned as all three Winchester's eyes went wide. Cas sounded like he is about to get a panic attack.
The man was still laughing and he was now bending a little bit because he can't stop his laughter.
"Yeah yeah very cheeky, aren't you now," Dean asked and Castiel shoved Dean by his shoulder. Okay now that means Dean has something for him today, Dean is not stopped his effort of wooing Castiel. Castiel felt a relief. But hey Castiel shouldn't feel relief. He is not gonna give hope to Dean. But Castiel failed to hide his, now not pouting and relieved face. But also Castiel was very excited and curious to see what Dean got him today. But he didn't have to wait for long for that.
"Look Dean right now I'm really mad at you, and I hope you will stop this at least after this" With that Castiel stormed towards his car and drove off even without giving a single glance at Dean.
Hello my lovelies 😍😍
"Yes mom yes, how could I forget him when you daily remind about him" Sam answers impatiently.
"Dean... No, you can't do that, please, my breasts should not be seen by anyone but my future husband, otherwise, they will kill you, I can't let happen something like that to you my beloved, but the only one I want to be my husband is you, but right now we can't." Cas cries with a shiver when Dean pinches his left nipple.
"I have another question?"
"Oh, God Dean how could you cum inside me in front of your brother," Cas asked in teasing and hot tone after they break the kiss for air.
"Cas, can I ask something?"
"Hey is that Kevin nerd" Azazel's voice was very enthusiastic because that's their new target of bullying.
(See the end of the chapter for
"mmm I love to suck your nipples babe and drink your milk, mmmm" Dean murmured through the Tongue around the bud. He let go of the nipple slowly and leaned to Castiel's lips and kiss him passionately. Cas moaned to the kiss and started kissing back eagerly.
The call connected and within the first ring, Michael answered the phone. As soon as he answered Dean recognized that he is on the loudspeaker as he can hear the other voices coming from the background.
"Yeah? What is it?"
******************
Have a great day lovelies😍😍
"Man, he was a pain of the ass, and next day that crazy coach, Singer asked to come to his office and questioned us, but he had no clue that was us beaten the kid, coz he didn't see our faces that day. Good for us he just warned us that's it, then we released" Uriel said with a smirk on his face.
"Fine, and I can't wait to see you again soon Cas"
"Well, I agree with that too. And here, I already dialed his number" Sam said putting his phone in his ear.
"And Sam you know, when I came to meet you here I was a mess okay? I wanted to talk to you before I do something stupid myself. There was a problem in the office and however, it triggered to the old man" Dean said looking at his hands on his lap.
Cas turns his head to see Dean’s pouty face and chuckles.
"Seems like you have a secret admirer Mr.Novak" Messenger boy said pushing the huge Red Rose bouquet to Castiel's now free hands.
But then there is another long pause as Dean was staring at Castiel's plump kissable pinky lips unconsciously licking his own lips and Castiel was staring at Dean's freckles as they are visible beautifully to the sunshine. Both of them didn't understand what they were doing. They just be there staring at each other when they heard a sarcastic voice behind them.
"And by the way, why are you in the office so early, I think you should be the first one who came to the office beside the security and cleaning officers," Dean asked and Castiel started to remove his coffee soaked trench coat.
"I said shut up" Cas yells and Dean feels his Alpha getting started to weak dangerously. He never felt this much weak or helpless. He wants to cry, to scream. But he can't. And the pain in his heart starts to spread all over his body. He can feel his Alpha is wailing and hauling sadly. And the cut on his neck starts to pour out more blood.
Dean could hear the reverberation of his Dad's words from years back.
"Okay, okay Winchester take it easy, but just remember your time has started already," He said shrugging Dean's hands off his collar.
"Actually Mr. Winchester it still hurts everywhere but feeling better than before," Gabriel said smiling at him.
"Baby tell me, what happened?, god you are shaking Cas" Dean grabs his shoulders and asks.
" Yes of course I am. And I'm done with it " Dean said that and stormed past him towards the door.
"Aww honey you angry with me? Please let me see your face once darling"
Cas knew what Sam saying right now is true. And he was so badly stinky right now. So he needed to get a shower. Definitely need. So he signed and let the young man drag him to the Dean's room.
Cas burst opened the washroom door to see the most unexpected scene ever.
"Okay, who wants a fresh honey tea," He asked smiling at Gabriel.
"Yeah, I'm fine Cassie, that asshole is just a sick bastard" He murmured before sighed heavily.
Dean said again very slowly and in low voice.
Throughout the entire year of kindergarten Dean and Castiel kissed as cute best friends just like normal kids do, but sometimes Dean wanted to kiss Castiel's lips because it's too much pink and beautiful. He always loved to see his best friend's lips. But he makes sure to do that when no one is no around because he remembered the last time. Also Dean loved his best friend's beautiful blue eyes. When people asked him why Blue is your favorite color, he didn't hesitate and telling them because Castiel's eyes, and that they were the most beautiful blue eyes he ever saw.
"Wait Alastair let me handle it with here," He said and came between Castiel and Alastair. What? What's going on? Azazel looked like in a shock. He thought Dean was gonna hit Alastair. But no he is going to help him. What the fuck Winchester. A hard fucker.
"Okay then give me a second, I will give you a lift, coz I also going to the town, so you can go with me," Dean said walking towards the cupboard which he put his keys. But Cas seems like got shocked by that. He glancing at him like he can't believe what he just said.
So Dean kept trying to talk to Cas every day but every time Cas didn't even glance at him. He acted like Dean is invisible. And for Dean's disadvantage, he only can talk to Cas when other students are not around them. So Cas understood that quickly and he took advantage of it. So this one time, Dean catch Cas in a student-less area in the library. Dean walked into him before sitting on the nearest chair trying to pull a friendly chat but Cas didn't waste a second and he gathered his books then sit at another table some other students already sitting. Dean gave him a sad face before getting out of the library. And again Dean got Cas on the Cas's favorite place out of the playground. When Cas sits behind the huge tree. he loved reading there because he loves to that peace around there. Normally students not coming that area a lot. So Dean knew that. But also soon as Cas saw Dean jogging towards him he took his phone and called Alfie asking to join him with Meg, so Dean knew he can't wait here when Cas's friends crashing there soon. So another failed attempt. Likewise, Dean didn't get any chance to make a friendship with Cas. Even a few times Dean tried to convince Sam that he should invite Cas over another day but every time Sam gave him a weird look. And then one time Sam called Cas and asked him to come over but Cas kindly turned down that telling about his studies and stuff. So Dean is still being rejected.
Castiel didn't reply because he was still processing. Dean looked at his eyes the next second, they were soft, no anger in those eyes anymore.
"Yeah okay. And don't forget to call me when you reach home okay?"
"Actually I was having a bath" Those words just came out of Cas's mouth as Dean lost his words.
"Well, to be honest, this is my favorite table Cas, and this is my favorite chair," Dean said without a hesitation taping on his chair.
Castiel was angry, in pain, afraid, and also he was almost having a panic attack, then Dean chose to beat the kid hell out of him exactly the same time as Dean punched on Castiel's stomach. With that Castiel fell on his back.
"Oh god no, no. see. It's not something like that. Don't be afraid. I just didn't want you to go away if I keep going to talk to you when you asked me to go, that's why, look Castiel I'm so sorry man, I was being so rude to you. In different ways. I'm really sorry, I didn't mean any of those" Dean said in a pleading way.
Before Dean stops his aftershocks, Sam started yelling, closing his eyes with his hand.
Cas whine into the new sensation and he understands that Dean is fucking his nipples. Dean closes his eyes, his face turns up and his head falls back as his hips thrust and thrust. His hard, pre-cum leaking cock hitting and pressing into Cas's nipples. Which now soaking with Dean's saliva.
Castiel closed his eyes sobbing. Suddenly the images coming and going inside his head like a flash. Their childhood memories. Dean was kissing his lips on the day of football game in the school, then suddenly they were aparted, and Dean stand and go away from Castiel. When Castiel crying with pain. Then again images flashing all the time Dean kissed him between elementary school and Kindergarten. Dean stopped kissing Castiel and left him alone in every flashed image of the memory. Then last he saw when was the first time Dean kissed him in kindergarten. Castiel's eyes filled with more tears as little cute and kind Dean stop kissing him and left him on the ground to cry himself. Castiel opened his teary and bloody eyes.
Castiel looked away and laughed at that. His cheeks are burning and he couldn't be redder at that time.
"So Dean, how did you do this all? I thought you were in your meeting. I even texted you few times" Castiel asked as he wanted to know about it.
"Okay, then good. And I'm gonna text back as I'm sure that you are not home tonight"
"But Cas, I don't want to get the advantage of your kindness"
"Well, it's healing" Castiel answered without any emotions in his face and turned his glance again toward the window.
The sleep is even not close to him right now. His heart is still thumping hard enough to hear that sound outside. Cas touches his neck and hisses in the pain he feels. This is gonna be a long night. Cas thinks as he sobs with the huge pain stab inside his heart.
But he tried to forget about him and concentrate on Mary and Sam. Castiel knew who Dean was. He didn't even want to think about what will happen to him when they going to college tomorrow. Because unfortunately lots of things happened today, Dean to get revenge tomorrow. So he didn't want to think about it now.
.....
So how is it?☺😊😍
Yeah it's not nice and his voice went to that rude voice again, but Castiel didn't care. Why should he care when Dean already called him to hurt him in big time.
Cas didn't answer or looked at Dean this time. He wanted to yell at him as 'what do you want Winchester' or 'go away Winchester', but actually he can't do that after all right now. Dean kept coming to him and act so normal, be nice to him for some reason. And act like they were never been enemies before. So Cas isn't an evil kid, he just tried to keep himself out of the troubles. That's it. But when someone trying to be nice to you, how could you yelling at them. Nope Cas can't do that, because naturally, he is a very kind kid. So instead of yelling, Cas kept ducking his eyes not wanting to make a conversation.
"Besides if you actually don't care about that nerd why do you hesitating this much Winchester, don't let us think other than that, uh I can't even think about that, coz I don't think Winchester is gay for him," Raphael said and next second he pinned to the wall by Dean and got a punch to his face as Raphael yelled with pain.
"You are sounds like so cheesy you know?"
"Okay man, then see ya later," Dean said quickly.
.....
"Yeah, yeah, everything is great, I just, um" Sam chuckled nervously, looking at his Mom like he is asking for a guide.
Alastair nudge Dean and gesture ar the poor kid who was staring at them with a fear-filled face. He looked like he saw a ghost. And he seems so weak. Dean sure if he put a finger on him he will fall into the floor, that much weak. Dean knew he doesn't want to bother about that but he can't even calm himself anymore saying himself that Castiel is fine, he is absolutely not fine, and on the other hand, why is he care. Okay, Dean is absolutely fucked up.
"Ahem, excuse me can you show me where the hell those vegan eggnogs are?" Dean tried his best not to growl at the sales assistant. Dean was angry, very angry.
Castiel takes some time before gathering himself to ask that one question that bothers him the most.
"It should be Clarence," Mary said smiling at Sam who standup quickly from the couch beaming and coming behind Mary towards the door.
Cas got a deep breath and closed his eye for a bit. Cas sighed heavily before answer Mary.
"Sam, come let's go, he is going," Mary said and signed Sam to let go of the shopping cart. And they walk very slowly behind the boy and waited for him to put his bags inside the old truck and leaving the grocery park.
Dean felt very happy and he bummed with happiness.
Cas : Deannn, what. what are you doing?
Hello lovelies hope you doing well 😍😍
"She will join us anytime now," Alfie said trying his tickle mission again.
"Ahem, hey can I talk with you a bit Castiel?" Here we go again and the voice came very low and small.
"Are you kidding me, just tell me everything I'm dying here to know about you more" Dean quickly jumped in.
Sam started with a soft smile.
"Dean if you don't mind I can heat them for you"
"And Mary I never thought that I'd say this to anyone else in my life, but I wanted to let you know why I hide my real name from you. because I want to prove that I'm not a liar, to prove that I'm not a cheater. You are the first human being who be kind to me after my brother. So I can't just let you think about me like that, even you never want to see me ever again I want to say this to you because you remind me of my Mother and I missed her so much" Castiel cried again.
.......
"Ellen I couldn't, any one of us couldn't. Dean's Alpha acted very possessively and threatened and snared to back off immediately. Even he has almost killed Alastair for mentioning to put Angel omega in the dungeon"
"You fucking slut, I knew you were fucking with Benny from the beginning. Tell me why did you do this to me? Doesn't your fucking pussy get satisfied with a huge cock like mine? Huh? did you want more cocks bitch? Do you want to give your sluty hole to another man like a fucking whore? Tell me you whore?"
"What? I was just going my way, you are the one who came into me" Alfie isn't a stupid kid but he said it in a calm voice because he didn't want to pull a fight with Dean Winchester right now.
"Yes, Dean?"
"Oh god Dean, your cock"
Anyhow, this case is different, even he baked this pie along, he can consume it with few people who genuinely appreciate his presence. So it would be so nice.
"I'm feeling good now, um, mam can you please tell me what happened? I mean who bring me to the hospital? Because I don’t remember much”
"Hmm, in that case, YES for your first question," Castiel answered slowly like a song.
Dean keeps rocking up against Cas as he fucking through his orgasm and his aftershocks, spilling his seeds as much as he can, marking his lover in inside.
"Who knows? Your lover boy suddenly went outside calling to someone, I don't know where he is gone"
Castiel asked getting out the things from the box one by one. There were different bees friendly seed packets which of course writing as "bee mine". And a bee journal writing as " Beekeepers' journal. And a book named Beekeepers' Bible. And the last one was a very cute tank crop top which written in the middle as "Bee mine" With little two bees and a heart in the middle.
"Call me when you finish, and please don't try to walk yourself, I'm just right here, outside of the door," Castiel said kindly before walking outside of the door closing it behind him.
Dean yelled as Mary came to settle brothers quickly.
Castiel signed and closed the door. He felt happy and peaceful after years. That's strange but in a good way.
Castiel's jaw dropped and he wanted to punch his brother. Dean started to laugh.
Dean quickly started to type.
"Dean. You can't do stuff like this. look around, people looking at this, looking at ME, god. Did you think that I'm a high school teenage GIRL? Can you understand that you made me embarrassed in front of my co-workers?" Castiel asked pointing at the giant chocolate color fluffy Teddy Bear in front of them.
"Woah Cas? You okay?"
"Son of the bitch, I was planning a big entrance to the first time you sit on my beloved baby, but it's already happened in an unexpected way. So anyhow meet this is baby" Dean express and pretending like he is presenting the car.
"Okay, Dean go ahead. And I promise you I'm not going to do such a thing. No way" Castiel answered.
Dean was always very happy to hang out with his real friends like this. They are always very kind, funny and always there for him. After his family, this was his second family. So hanging out with them make him calm down always.
"Oh My Fucking God, No, no, no, oh God oh God, this is not happening. I didn't see it. Ohhh my fucking eyes, I can't believe I saw my brother fucking raw in to my brother-in-law. Now I have to live in my whole life with that. Next time try it with closing door ass holes.
Dean moves very fast and turns around to grab Cas's hand which he was holding the dagger. And the next second, Dean is out of the tub as he locks Cas's both hands to his back. Then the dagger falls with a noise, eventually. With that Dean pushes Cas into the nearest wall, as Cas's back tightly presses into Dean's chest. Dean's hot breath ghosting on Omega's neck and Cas tries to get rid of him but obviously fails to do so.
"Okay, tell me what's going on with you? "
"Dean, I don't care about your sickness. I just care about you, I don't want to see you in pain, that's it" Castiel said. And Dean quickly lifted his head to look into Castiel's eyes as Castiel blushed.
"Hey, Dean I'm ready, can we go?" Sam also took a sandwich before asking so.
"As the rumors captain and coach both are spelled out and there is this new coach. They say that he is experiencing less and nerd, so we have a big chance this time" Michael answered.
"mmm how could I stop baby, you Cummed untouched and I was lost. And you couldn't blame me ye know, I got one hella fucking hot Husband" Dean said and caught Cas's lips again.
“Ohhh…Dean please need your cock, I don’t need to cum without your cock inside me”
"Um, Clarence what are these" Sam asked without go and open the lid.
"Yeah, I guess that's correct Sweetheart, thank you"
Cas went home with new energy for the first time today. After Dean's texting, he felt really happy and he wanted to sing and dance over it. Finally, he came home and checked on his brother. Gabriel was getting better speedily causing Cas's relief.
The only thing working on Dean's body was his eyes. His brain is having a coma right now but his hungry eyes roaming all over Castiel's tan and beautiful sexy body but then Castiel suddenly looks like he was getting out of his own brain coma. because he just sat on the bed and covered his body with the only cloth he got in his hand, the pant he was going to wear.
Daphne :
"Wait, I think you just lied Cas, and it's okay. and by the way please accept this treat Cas, I guarantee you this is the best donuts in the whole city, and I didn't know which tastes you like so I brought all of the flavors they have, would you like to try one Cas?" Dean asked in a very kind way.
Both parents slowly getting into sleep as their baby is sucking Castiel's nipple sleeply.
Their baby is sleeping with full tummy. His tiny hands are on above his head. Dean is next to baby and his hands also above his head. Same pose.
"My chest here, little bit hurting Cas," He said again with a little bit pouty voice. Then Castiels quickly look at the place Dean pointing at. Then grab both Dean's shoulders and leaned to his chest then press another kiss there.
Castiel said with pure concern about Dean as Dean stared at Castiel.
"Well for the second question, the answer is, YES"
"I don't know Charles, I just missed him so much. I don't know why he doesn't accept me still. I mean I don't want to push him but damn, I'm falling so hard for that guy, I can't handle it, Dude. It's scaring me, I have never felt for someone like this before" Dean burst out without hiding anything he felt right now.
"Hey Charlie what's up," He said with an excited voice. His best friend can always makes him chill.
Donna's head popped up over donuts boxes.
"But you know, don't worry we are not gonna bite your precious new son, I mean at least ME, I'm not gonna bite him but I can't guarantee about this drooling giant here, I don't know what's going on him though" Dean chuckled and earned two punches from both Mom and Sam.
Cas gulped.
Cas put his dirty clothes outside and Sam took them downstairs. Everything was peaceful, Cas just tried his best to not think or touch anything in Dean's bathroom.
"You know, since you are a vegan, you can just sit here and talk with me, and finally it's only you and me, so you can talk you know. we can get to know each other" Dean said collecting the stuff he needed.
"You know, I'm in a hurry, and my brother is in the car, he's gonna kill me if I got late, and these vegan eggnogs are very rare to find so can you please give me this, if you want I will give you money"
Dean fell into a cafeteria seat. What the fuck happened there, he thought running his fingers through his sweaty damp hair. Fuck! He was in one second behind from caught up with Castiel back there. Phshhuu... He sighed as smirking at the cafeteria table like he did something big.
Cas starts to think. Maybe he put it on the table unbalance. Maybe that's why it has fallen. He let out a little laugh.
"No no Meg, I can go to the class, I want to go, and I want you all to go your own classes please, and guys thanks for. Thanks for being there for me, it's a big deal for me" Cas replied weakly.
"Oh thanks, Dean," Castiel said shyly and Dean was still staring at him.
"Wow bro really? You seriously turn down that kind of man? Dude just brush your brain out of that rust a bit and open your eyes wide and look what you doing, man don't be stupid to lose that kind of love, Cassie you deserved to be loved"
"Gabe, let me tell you something. Actually, I have a secret to tell you. But first, let me ask another question. And then give me some time to think. Because my head is kinda messed up right now. After I will tell you that secret, will you agree with that?" Castiel was going to never tell anyone what happened in his chambers last night. Still, he was able to convince all the soldiers to make it a Classified secret. But right now he understands he can't keep it to himself anymore and he needs some help with those answerless questions he got.
Dean never expected something like that. If you asked a few days back, Dean was the last person who believes 'love in first sight' or about 'soulmates' and 'true mates'. He would laugh his ass off if someone brings that in a week ago, but right now he is a mess and madly in love with his Omega, his true mate, as Dean sees it right now. But the thing he really can't understand is, why Cas keep rejecting their bond like this.
Castiel thought if he answer quickly this drama will end quickly. So he answered Dean.
"Oii Winchester why the hell you miss the Practice today morning" That's Raphael.
Castiel glared at him this time.
Dean slowly moved his lips to the wooden spoon.
Sam just very carefully noted Dean's laugh and his happiness. Because it's a bit rare to see. And Sam felt relief to see his big brother like this.
With that they were going to go to the hospital, Castiel's mind worked quickly and next second he found himself taking to the lady paramedic.
And Cas's fic I edited myself for my fic💞💓😘❤
"Um, What are you doing Cas?"
Two weeks passed slowly not having major issues for Castiel, not cutting, not self burning or anything. But only here and there few panic attacks.he made sure keep his desire down and not went to the hospital to see Mary. But he also wished if he could meet her sometimes. But he can't. as he didn't know anything about Mary he can't find her now. Because she must be already gone home now. and other problem was he didn't want to tell his true self to her. So he had to ignore her.
"You know Sammy, I suppose to be in that comfy and warm coach cuddling with my comforter and drinking my morning beer, and now look at me, I can't believe you chose your "to be brother in law" Over your own brother " Dean yelled trying to sound more powerful than the wind.
"Oh, Dean.. I.. I.. Just" Cas started like a cry but Dean stopped him.
"Charlie messaged me in the afternoon man," Sam said as Dean understood that Sam thinking that he is in Charlie's home right now. Not a wonder as it's pretty late at night now.
"I love you Dean Winchester, more than anything else" Castiel answered smiling at him and then Dean Kissed Castiel smiling like he got everything that he wanted in his life. They kissed and kissed and kissed and then they lived happily ever after.
"Cas? Please tell me that you are okay?" Dean said so softly like he is talking to a baby. He must be unconscious. For a second, Dean got distracted by Cas's innocent unconscious face. It's so beautiful, and it's also pale at the moment. But still beautiful. So peaceful and so soft. His cheeks look like a girl's cheek. and his pinkish, kissable lips, goddamn it. dean wanted to touch that soft-looking plump lips. And his eyelashes were amazing. And his sharp jawbone is so hot and unbelievably addictive. And Dean dying to nibble on it. Dean wanted to touch that soft face, but he barely stopped his thoughts and finally, Dean tried to take Cas to the bed without letting him go away from the hug as Cas is still tightly pressed into him. If he, comfortably laying on the bed, it would help Cas to breathe steadier.
They ended up transfer Donna to the ambulance on the way and they drive behind it to the hospital. Sam already called both of them and informed her family.
And also before everything, he had to fix one major mistake. His name. he is going to tell Mary that his real name, is the first thing this time.
"Oh no, not only him, they choose me too, remember the last time, he got to face them because of me" Kevin replied.
"What? It can't happen, he was just here, before a second ago. How? How could even he disappeared like that?"
Castiel rolled his eyes.
"Hey Deano, you okay? What's going on with you man?"
Cas places both arms back of Dean’s head and pulls him to his lips. Dean climbs the top of Cas and captures his soft plump lips hungrily. Dean sucks Cas’s bottom lip as Cas moans to his lips and runs his long fingers through all over Dean’s hair. After minutes or hours, Dean slowly pulls back and puts his forehead on Cas’s.
"No need, I just came to inform my decision"
"You little shit, you are such pain of ass, do you know your presence can destroy an anything? Huh? you are a useless, weak, broken, empty, not wanting, not cared, fucking piece of shit. you are nothing"
"What the fuck that fucker doing all over him?" Dean never expects to say it loud but too late, Lisa's eyes were on him with a not understanding face.
Then Castiel pulled out his phone and get a quick photo of the cupcake. Wow, today Castiel is full of surprises. Dean thought quietly.
Cas Sweetheart - //but you should concentrate on the meeting, aren't you?//
"Stop you little bitch, I'm gonna catch you soon and make sure you will regret betraying me" He yells.
"Dean, your big cock is so hard, mmm probably we should stop now and getting on our clothes back before someone walk into us like this" Cas says touching Dean's naked chest.
"Me too Dean, me too" Castiel replied slowly but happily because he got to hug Dean again.
Cas didn't replay quickly as Dean grinned, knowing probably he must be blushing again.
So I hope you tell me if there anything in the fic that I should correct.
Cas knew Dean will call him anytime but before that, he decided to get a warm bubble bath as he prepared a nice warm bubble bath in his tub. He found a few lavender essential candles and lit them around the tub. He grabbed a hand towel and his phone before putting it around him. Finally, he poured a glass of red wine for him as slowly he got into the tub. The warmth of the water made his heart happy. He slowly layed there resting his head on the edge of the tub.
" Yeah... fuck my tight cunt! Uh, Make me scream with that big dick of yours!" Cas said and lined his clenching hole on Dean's cock, he slowly sank down as he whimpered with the feeling of the sweet ache he felt.
"Holy fuck, then what had happened?" Uriel asked with an interesting tone.
"I know what is that Cassie" Suddenly Gabriel says with a very determination voice.
Castiel bit seductively his kiss swallowlen bottom lip and moaned.
*Prince Castiel accepted it and Blushed deeply.
"Yes Mom, mom I'm so sorry I didn't be there at that time, shit I'm so sorry mom. I can't believe that I didn't reach the news because I didn't check my damn phone. I'm so sorry mom" Keen couldn't resist anymore and he started to cry.
"Mmm never Cas, never gonna stop. I'm gonna eat your delicious pussy for hours baby" Dean groans.
"Okay baby, see you tomorrow," Dean said giving him a goofy smile and waving at him.
So I'm waiting for the ideas about my fic 😍😍 I like to make mistakes if there any. Thanks 😍😍😍
"Yeah okay," Castiel answered and it was his turn to staring at Dean when he made them two cups of hot and freshly brewed coffee.
In the whole day, Dean was finding a good time to talk to Cas. In the morning he saw Cas, actually, he didn't see him, practically Dean searched Cas everywhere and found him in the studie area. He wanted to talk to him but Meg was with him. Dean knew Meg chick and her mouth. He didn't want to anyone know about what's going on between them. So Dean waited. Then after his classes, he finally saw Cas alone near his locker and he looked around to see if whether his asshole football team anywhere near. After he got satisfied with the environment he happily walked towards Cas but before he reached to him, that little fucker Alfred or someone Dean never remember the name, ruined the moment and came to Cas. So after stalking Cas a few hours like that Dean finally saw Cas walking toward the playground alone. Dean followed him without noticing anyone. He just wanted to get a decent apology and make a path to solve every problem. And mostly be thankful for what Cas did for his Mom.
Then next second, "Not yet" He burst out, smirking at Dean who's eyes rolled back and head tipped backward to follow them.
"You remembered?" Dean asked softly but Cas hadn't guts to say yes as he didn't answer that. Because wasn't it obvious that he is remembered everything when he thanked him? Because of nothing coming from Cas Dean tried again with his big question.
"Annoying brothers" Dean huffs a smile rubbing his back of the neck.
"But as I told you that day, the first day we met each other, I was having this. But after I talk with you it's vanished like magic. And when I'm leaving the building that day I was a new man. Since that day because of you and your presence in my life, it's not triggered like it's used to be. You were a real Angel to me Cas, you saved me" Dean murmured looking at Castiel's eyes directly.
Dean: so when you say “YOU” that means both me and Sam, right?
Dean was in his bed groaning himself, unable to believe what had happened to him this evening. His whole life changed in one single evening.
Sam smiled and nodded.
So Dean keep trying and poor Cas keep resist him
He gritted his teeth and hit his own reflection of the mirror with his heavy bad. The bag hit the mirror and flying away but below the end of the mirror got cracked a bit and a piece felt down near Castiel's shoes. Without even a second thought he picked it up and shoved up his sleeve of the shirt. Then he ran the mirror piece on his hand a few times, cutting the flesh without even thinking.
"Alfie please don't do that okay? You really scared me" He said while closing his locker.
"What the fuck you doing here Novak and how the hell you command me to get out of my own fucking room" Dean groaned and stepped forward to Castiel's personal space.
Gabriel presses his lips together and glances at his confused brother.
"Maybe, but I don't like"
Ellen's forehead puckers as she starts to think like it is a puzzle.
Cas can't understand the sudden change of Alfie. Cas only got two friends in here as he didn't want to lose them, Meg and Alfie. Kevin also a friend of his but he is a freshman and a huge book nerd, so he is not joining them all the time. But for few days, he noticed that Alfie always choose the times that Meg Can't join with them and then he will acting so weird. But he can't understand why is that? Today is a day like that as he can't wait to finish his food and got back to his next class.
Dean didn't want to talk with them but too late they saw him. So he slowly walked towards them.
"I asked, how you get it? Did Sam gave it to you?" Castiel shooted without mercy.
Dean pretended like he is honored and he bowed to people around him. He smirked getting his guitar in his hand and glanced up at Castiel who's still on the balcony.
"It's okay Sam, I can manage" Mary assured Sam who was gonna complain again.
Before the practice starts today, Dean was in a grumpy mood. but as soon as the practice starts, his mood changed into this super active mood and he started to play like crazy, and as the captain of the team, Michael couldn't hesitate or lose to Dean as he signed others to follow his lead as they all played shoulder to shoulder. But they never knew Dean was in kinda self-punishment mood. So when it's coming to the end time of the practice everyone sighed with relief but Dean got another idea as he challenged Michael to another round, it turned to one another round, and another and more. So now they have played full two hours of extra practice and all boys were so pissed off.
"But Dean I don't know that I should do it, because jeez it's been a while and I'm.. God, I'm too old for these things" Dean rolled his eyes.
"Um. Mary, of course you can come over. But um actually I have to go right now but we will meet again and then we will talk about it, after you recovered fully, you can come around, so then I will leave you to get some rest, you look like you can have a great nap right now" Castiel said smoothly smiling at her, not wanting to hurt this kind and lovely woman.
Sam didn't say a word and directly walked to Castiel and pulled him from his mom's hand then hugged him.
"What? Cas did he just, wow your brother is definitely hard to understand, and very unique" Dean said laughing.
"Ellen that's not the most bad thing happened"
Castiel said in a very lovely voice making Dean's brain crazy.
But today, he kinda put a little step further, yeah he able to make a good show in front of the coach. So it would be a big step for him after all. He sighed with that thought.
"Cas I don't want to hurt you, please stop struggling. And promise me, then I will leave you" Dean tried again.
Dean can't believe this is happening. Now he is completely on Cas's body, hovering over him. Not crushing him but his weight mostly on Cas. Cas is closing his eyes tightly. And making it worse Cas completely smells like him. Maybe because he had used my shampoo earlier. Damn, this is too much and Cas looks so delicious like this. Dean barely stopped him by groaning over Cas.
"No complaints Dean, chop-chop back to work and seriously give something to do too, wanna help you," Castiel said and stand up with Dean mostly touching their shoulders. Dean glanced over him peacefully.
Hey please let me know what you think about the chapter?❤❤😍
"Hey, you okay?" She whispered getting Dean out of his thoughts. He tried to give her a reassuring smile but failed.
Dean: smart huh? then can you explain why is the Great War Soldier’s eyes filled with tears when I got injured by Donatello’s spell?
"babe I want you to ride me, ride me like a cowboy. Mmm... Come over here and ride me hard"
"Alfie I can recognize your cold hands even you put a finger on me," Castiel said rolling his eyes and closed his locker before turning to his friend. Alfie chuckled and act like surprised.
After Dean satisfying with the scent and taste he wraps those long thick fingers which were now glistening with his saliva, around his shaft and starts to pressure himself rutting forward into his fist. He imagines all the ways he wants to take his boyfriend, all the dirty things he wants to do to his sweet omega, soon as after he came back home. But until then he releases his seeds into his hand screaming his mate's name.
"Hey Cas, I missed you, it's been a while since the last time I saw you," Dean said and grind over the boxes which was he holding up.
"Babe I Love you and our son more and Love this baby too," Dean said over Castiel's wet lips.
"See, we even think just the same thing at the Same time, we are a match made in heaven Cas," Dean said chuckling. Castiel’s cheeks burn intensely.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas keeps cries and sobs. He is sitting on the floor, laying his back on the door for a long time and still he can't hear anything from the other side of the door. Every inch of Cas's heart is hurts, aches. But he has to go through this whatever happens to them right now. He has no idea how he should help Dean but the only thing he understands is Dean should go to that psychiatrist as soon as possible.
Dean smiled at him.
"Nope absolutely no, I also didn't watch Harry Potter for a long time and I want to join with you guys," Dean said and struggled on his seat for a better position, causing his and Cas's thighs to rub few times before Dean's thigh settled on Cas's thighs. Cas glared at him before trying to pull out his leg slowly, not letting it obvious. but before that Dean slowly moved his leg. but still, it's on Cas's, mostly. And Dean put his hand on the popcorn bowl which was on Cas's lap. He caught Cas's eyes when he put his hand deep down inside the popcorn biting his lips. Cas gulped. What the hell Dean is doing. Finally, Dean got a hand full of popcorn winking at Cas before looking at the movie with a smirk and shoving some popcorns into his mouth.
He didn't break one of the bathroom tap because he got angry with Dean, because he didn't come to see him today. And then that coffee mug slipped from his hand not because he was too caught up with the thoughts of Dean's absence. Not at all.
"Yes, son the nurse said that you kept asking about my situation" Mary chuckled.
"Oh wait here, look there is a note" Gabriel almost yelled and Castiel grabbed it before Gabriel tool it.
"Don't be ridiculous Dean, obviously Sam told me"
"Why are you even finding him? And no, he didn't leave yet, he is using the bathroom. And Dean, who do you think made this super delicious smelling breakfast?" Sam asked smirking at Dean as first Dean's brows drew together in questioning look, then they got wide before his face turned to a jealous reflection. But in a moment he managed to wipe that look on his face as he cleared his throat.
Tell me how it is?😍😍 love your big kudos and comments.
my baby boy can have me as your wish, take me as you want love”
"Books. Of course. Looking at books, and what about you?"
Dean's brain was completely working backward since Cas agreed to come over. He heard the doorbell rang, and Sam welcomed Cas. And then he has listened to them when they went to Sam's room. Dean's heart filled with a strange feeling at that moment. Like a jealous. But it's ridiculous, right? Cas is the same age as Dean. and he is elder than Sam by four years. They can't be besties, right? Besides Dean was Cas's first best friend, so it's not a big deal. But then he reminded their relationship status. That he was Cas's personal bullies and they were enemies. Shit, Dean's head tried to blow with all that details. But he shook his head to concentrate on what should he do next as his plan was going on very well. He waited a bit thinking about that when he heard Sam asking Cas to choose a movie and suddenly Dean slide out of his room quietly.
"No Jo I wasn't.. It just a small incident no halm, Charlie is always overacting when it's coming to that nerd. Sometimes I wonder whether she is my best friend or that nerd's best friend" Dean said dramatically.
Gabriel who came back and done a lot in the end game, smirks at Dean said that he can arrange a lesson and teach him how to make a Angel to a quick orgasm, earning a death glare from Cas. Making everyone laugh but Making Dean and Cas blush like a beetroot.
"Oh hello, Mr. Winchester what do I owe this honor?" Mrs.Pamela greeted with her usual smile on her face. Dean ducked his head and laughed at her sarcastic tone.
“Yes love but I swear it's just happened. I woke up with a boner and I was gonna go to the bathroom. Because babe I can’t nah? I gave you a word, I have to wait” Dean lift his face to look at his boyfriend’s face.
He was tired of this shit. He didn't even want others to think that he cares about that nerd. Now they started to think maybe he is gay for that fucker. Arrr everything is happening because of him. Because of his fucking break less mouth. He remembered the day all of this were started.
Dean keeps saying with an apologizing tone. then Cas turns to face Dean and glares at him. Dean stops talking as he gulps. he is scared that Cas will upset again. But after seconds Cas starts to laugh at him. Making Dean confusing. Dean can’t understand what is happening as he stares at his laughing boyfriend.
"You know you are a good boy, you already proved that you can protect your papa" Castiel pretended to talk to the puppy and kissed its head.
"Dean I want to say this to you right now. And I should do this a long time ago. I'm really sorry for taking this too far" Castiel said not looking at Dean as Dean's whole body started to sweat. He felt like his breathing getting messy second by second.
"Oh shit" Cas's words slipped and he fell into Dean's chest, again.
"Oh my god Castiel please son don't talk like that, you are not a curse you are a precious little kid who is very kind and very good gentlemen, please don't say those stuff again" Mary stroked his silky hair, still rocking him.
"Actually Dean I also got to know very briefly about that when I received the call. Gabriel has been fallen from his roof. He is a very stubborn man. He always does stuff like this. And nurses told that there are few broken bones, and minor internal bleeding. That's why I got terrified." Castiel said.
Then they heard the sirens sound of the ambulance and within a second they had arrived and then everyone was being forced to move aside as the ambulance workers turned up. Castiel quickly got asides giving room to Paramedics and next few seconds they got managed to get the victim women into the ambulance after do all the necessary medicine giving to her quickly. Meanwhile, Castiel heard Paramedics talking to each other while they act so quickly.
"God Deano, are you kidding me right now? You brought me freaking donuts and a bunch of candies, man where have you been in my whole life?" Gabriel screamed and quickly got a bit from one donut.
"Are you sure Cas?" Why he keeps calling me Cas. No one calls me Cas.
Cas beg and he felt the room start to spinning. He felt Dean press his hand into his neck and tighten his grip shouting and cursing him. Cas feels he couldn’t breathe and suddenly his vision goes blur then get darker, next second he passes out on the bed, beneath Dean.
Castiel suddenly pointed at Dean and said. "He started that" And Dean rolled his eyes.
But unfortunately, Cas felt that feeling again as his concentration is broken for a moment and he turns his head to look around to see if there is anyone else looking at him. And that exact moment he doesn't see Michael's incoming shot and he falls on the ground with a huge thud. And both Michael's and Raphael's swords are on his face the next moment.
"See ya bitches" Charlie said with a small smile and went with Jo. Dean also smiled at them.
"What No, eww, it's been years and I don't want to even remember his name, and I don't name that as love, I didn't love him, never. actually, I didn't love anyone in my life if I being honest. just a few datings that's it" Castiel shrugged.
Dean feels his orgasm getting closer and
"What? you even didn't listen to the bet, the nerd is never coming to any party, not even for a one, so we give you 4 months, after 4 months there is Raphael's birthday, and he throws a huge party every year, I'm sure this year will be the same, right Raphael?" Azazel kept saying ignoring Dean's cursing at him.
"Thank god I didn't buy you a toilet paper" Castiel chuckled.
"Hey Winchester what's happening around you, you just ran out like a crazy dog last day, and even after you came back, then you have gone without hanging out" Alastair shouted at Dean when the football team saw Dean came near to the his locker.
"Yes I can, you are mine, so I can see anything I want, Screw our kingdoms. baby please?"
What he wants now, great.
“Cas please sweetheart I need you, I need to have sex with you, can I?” Dean asks and leans to Cas again licking Cas's neck softly. But Cas immediately puts his hand on Dean’s chest pushing him lightly.
Instead of stay in a room like a princess, he always wanted to be a soldier. And the day he finally gets permission to be a soldier, he has sworn on his life to behave and stay pure and clean. Because even he became the most beautiful male omega Angel in the kingdom, he has that royal warrior blood inside him. so he trained since he was a child even every royal captain are disagreeing and disapproved of his actions. But finally, he became a soldier after that oath, to protect his purity for the sake of the kingdom, until the day, the king decides and chooses the Alpha husband for him. So because of that, Cas even can't think about a random Alpha like this. But hell, Cas just got his first kiss from an Alpha, other than his family. And a strong Alpha hand on his ass. And just as Gabriel said, it's a wonder how he didn't kill that Alpha right there. But he didn't do that and here he is thinking about that very Alpha, on his bed. Cas sighs trying to get some sleep but then here is that strange feeling again. Like someone is looking at him. But this time Cas didn't bother to check his room as he knows there is no one in his chamber. So he closes his eyes slowly even his instincts keep telling him that he is wrong.
"Cas? Cas? Hey buddy? Are you okay?" Dean asked softly and quietly.
Dean can see how uncomfortable Cas is right now. But he wished if Cas can sit there with him so relaxed way, just like he sat with Sam before. Dean can see the side of Cas's face. That side of his cheek is turning to pink now. Dean wanted to place a kiss there. But he took down his inner mind as he looked away from him. But only just a few seconds as his eyes turned into Cas again. Cas is beautiful. A really beautiful boy. His innocent face made Dean's heart shutter right now.
Then Dean's phone started to ringing and Castiel looked at him when he took his phone from the pocket. Dean checked the caller ID and held it to Castiel to see it too.
Castiel rode His hubby's huge cock as there is no tomorrow. Babbling how huge he is and how it felt huger inside him.
"Well, I know stuff" Dean shrugged. Castiel gave him a suspicious look but didn't try to go along with that.
Cas starts to bobbing Dean’s cock eagerly while catching Dean’s eyes with lustful eyes.
//Hey Sweetheart//
"Oh Cas, she's saying that... Sam going to tell him the exact same thing Mary said but Cas's confused voice cut offed him.
"Okay, Sweetheart then I will hang up. Um, I'm sorry for bothering you. I didn't.."
“Hey calm down Dean we just fucking with ya, what you say the treat is all mine, let’s hit the bar” Azazel quickly said patting Deans' shoulder and smiling at him.
Castiel is a very neat kid, he never put his works behind his back. As soon as came back home he put all the grocery bags on the counter and started to unpack them. arranging all the stuff in the right places. After all are settled he thought he will get some quick shower before cocking something to eat as he felt he was starving.
"And how about your family, are they aware of this?" Dean asked again.
“Okay, then two days!” Cas says as he crosses his arms over his chest.
"You are like poison to me. And you obviously hate me, that's the reason for all of these problems. But If you really want to make it up to me because of your Mom's sake, just leave me alone, just please act like I'm invisible and I promise you I will do my best to stay away from your steps too"
"What? what did you mean by that?" Dean not sure what she is going to say.
"Am I okay? Sammy, c'mon you should have called me and inform me about Castiel's family urgency. Man, why didn't you tell me that?" Dean yelled and Sam stood up.
and Castiel didn't know anything about Dean right now but he can imagine his character very clearly.
Cas : it’s just like you, flirting with Daphne.
In the next second two things happened in a recorded time.
"Cas, are you okay? I'm sorry about this.. " Sam started.
Mary chuckled and leaning over Castiel and whispered.
"What? How did you?" Castiel started and Dean gave him a cocky grin.
It was after like two weeks since Dean started to ask him out and hitting on Castiel. Dean's unstoppable flirtings, gifts, pinning on him happened daily without any doubt.
"Mr.Winchester? Mr. Winchester, You here with us?" Zachariah asked glaring at Dean almost a sarcastic way.
Mary and Sam looked over the food and smiled.
"Oh, yes, yes, of course, Russia office.. Right.. Um, exactly Russia office what? Can you explain it a bit?" Dean was clever to cover it smoothly but everyone knew what was he doing as all other members started to mumble while Zachariah rolled his eyes.
Castiel stopped running by his place where he and his small friends' group hanging around always. It's a huge tree beside the end of the college playground and very peaceful. He sat down there and kept breathing up and down to control the panic. He felt he is doing fine after a few minutes as he stayed still there for a few minutes. Slowly he got to calm down. then he remembered his lunch. He didn't have any appetite now but he knew he wants to keep his mind away from what happened a few minutes ago. Because he didn't want to have a freaking panic attack now. as he slowly brought it out. It smells good. Castiel just sighed and unwrapped the p & j sandwich, then slowly moving it to his mouth but suddenly he got a huge pain in his hand and mouth as the sandwich fly away and felt to the ground. He grabbed his hurting hand with other hand with pain. He can feel the sour and copper taste of the mix of his tears and blood in his mouth. as he realized he is crying and probably his lips are cracked open. He can see now what's happening. Dean, it's Dean. he had kicked his hand which he was holding the sandwich and now he is looking at Castiel like a monster with a death glare. Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and kept wrapping his good hand around the hurting hand. With that Dean grabbed Castiel's shirt and yank him up.
"Cas, you just came for me, I can't believe it baby" Dean mumbled softly. His eyes were very lifeless even he tried to smile, the normal beautiful green was shading from them and instead, they were a bit redded. Maybe it's because of the panic he is going through right now.
"fuck baby, feel so good mmmm so hot, you are so gorgeous like this, all wet and tight and so hot for me.
Dean :
Okay, now Castiel's alarm went ring and Castiel couldn't think what to say to this weird man in front of him. But he hated himself for beaming inside, for knowing this bouquet was for him. Dean hasn't any girlfriend. This is for him. Wow. But why I'm happy about that. He is supposed to act like he is pissed. Gather yourself, Novak. Acting like you are not interested.
"Well let me think," He said and Dean groaned and pouted.
Dean didn't say a word as he was staring at the love of his life. His beautiful Castiel. His crush repeatedly rejected him but offered his friendship.
Cas leans down to kiss his lover. He kiss goes smoothly as Cas starts grinding his ass on Dean’s cock, and Dean moans to Cas’s mouth. Dean’s hand snakes to Cas ass cheeks and squeezed it slowly. Dean’s cock stars to getting harder when Cas’s firm ass cheeks and his hard cock rub on his own cock repeatedly.
How the hell this stubborn Demon Alpha, coming from nowhere, commanding me like this? He wants to fight this Alpha, but first, he must cover himself. So Cas get the advantage of this chance and quickly get out of the tub. Next, he grabs his robe, wrapping it around him, and then he sees his dagger on the desk as he takes it without any sound. Dean is still turning his back to Cas as he thinks it's the only chance he will get. The next moment, Cas reaches for Dean's neck and puts his dagger to his neck, from behind him.
"Okay..... Maybe I was... Okay? But now I'm genuinely asking for your forgiveness Princess Castiel? Forgive me? I'm so sorry, and I'm not planning to kill you. Definitely not"
Oh, that Sandwich. That freaking sandwich.
"Cas you okay sweetie, nothing happened right," She asked. Castiel smiled at her.
Is Dean finally done with Castiel? Over with him? He didn't find Castiel attractive anymore? There were loads of questions fighting in his mind. But to be honest he is the one who kept telling Dean that he doesn't need to bring gifts anymore and visit every day. But now, he is being worried like a pathetic high school, teenager girl. Awesome Novak.
“Cas, wait. This morning I woke up on the couch, but I was wondering why. because I remember I carried you to the bedroom promising you to make love to you, but then I woke up on the couch, that make no sense and I felt some kind of strange.
Castiel nodded sadly. Dean had already told them about their past. His friends must be know the whole story. so it's not a problem then, he felt relief and there is nothing to worried.
Dean slowly touches his face and gets some juice from his face and licks it into his mouth. And he closes his eyes and moans.
"Hey Cas, you made it, come inside, I'm glad you came man" Sam welcomed Cas happily pulling him inside the house. Cas gave him a nervous smile.
But Dean didn't giveup on his mission as he quickly cornered him again against the counter.
"Um, because I didn't have a pencil," He said and Castiel glared at him.
"Please don't pretend, you know what I'm talking about. You had listened to my story, aren't you now?" Castiel asked when he felt he wants to cry again.
"Well, well, well look what we got here our beloved fag, heyyy how you feeling this morning, seems like you can't even stay a few hours without seeing or having a piece of him now huh?" Azazel asked pointing at Dean.
Normally, Castiel is never got bored with his job. He always working great enthusiastic and happy. But for the first time, today he felt so dull and bored. Felt no mood to even smile a bit with his co-workers. Yeah, maybe it's because Mondays really suck. But definitely not because Dean is not going to come to see him today. He will tell so if someone asked him.
After few minutes Dean stops his crying and screams, he is holding on to his lover tightly, and close his eyes tight. he just wants to calm himself down, always Cas is his cue, so Dean stays still there.
Castiel got relief for a second when his name paired with Oliver. Because that kid is a decent one. Not a bully but a calm one, so Castiel could deal with him easily not going to working together. but when Mrs.Pamela recorrected it, his heart sink with an unclear fear. And then Dean, breathed out heavily, giving the teacher's back an annoying face for almost giving him a heart attack.
"Look at you my prince, such a slut for my giant Demon Cock, aren't you now Angel, such a cock slut... Mmmmm my slut" Dean groans staring at Cas's beautiful shining blue eyes. Cas moans into Dean's cock bobbing his head up and down fast.
"Hey, hey, stop that just let him be like this. He was going to having a panic attack" He said like a whisper, not wanting to scared Cas again.
Happy Birthday to the Greatest Hunter ever 💚💚💚💚💚 Happy Birthday Dean Winchester love ❤❤❤❤❤
Castiel working on a shitty company that happens to have a new management takeover for a while now. However, because of the covid 19 situations, he is currently working from home. but unfortunately, Cas has to go to the office sometimes because his company is struggling with the new management's shitty decisions.
Sorry for the mistakes
Castiel can hear that word again and again.
"You sure Dean?"
"Cas, I told you, I can't resist you anymore, besides if we caught up they have to listen to us first. we are in love after all that's it. and whatever happens, right now I need to do this Cas, I wanna see you cum on my fingers. I wanna see you all sheer bliss out. So let me have you, baby, I'm gonna take care of you" Dean rambled between little sucks on Cas's pussy lips here and there.
Okay, this is going to be a so hard time. Cas just looked at Dean again before he answer.
Both of them go to meet their family Doctor, Balthazar. Cas told the full story to the Doctor, as he creases his forehead.
Yesterday morning Dean was planning something when his Mom invited Cas to a game night. Dean was going to go home for the game night with Sam, his Mom, and Cas. Yes, he got his practice but he was planned to skip it for only this time. Hell, he did a great job to give this idea to Mom. So then he can be more close to Cas. And deep down inside his heart, he really wanted to be there with Cas, to look at him when he smile or blush or maybe when he bites his lips unconsciously. Yeah, he told his Mom that he wouldn't be home, but he just lied. He really planned for this time. But right now he was fed up with everything and everyone. He isn't going to crash their freaking game night or whatever shit is that. They can do it all themselves.
Last year Dean faced the most unfortunate incident unexpectedly. And he kept it as a secret till now. And with that he fell very badly with his anxiety and very serious panic attacks, his health started to get low and he got sick very badly as the doctors assigned him to change his living place to a new place. After a lot of arguments with Mary and Sam, finally Dean agreed to go to Russia and start a new life there with a fresh start. But all of sudden Castiel came into his life one morning and it changed Dean's whole life as he canceled his move and decided to control the Russia office from here. And to be honest, he really didn't give a lot of attention to that side. Anyhow now it's got into a bigger problem without even noticed.
"He said I'm a very weird and unnatural person and he said he feels like I'm a creepy guy, and broken up with me, and it didn't matter to me but his words made me so down and, I stopped even thinking about it and continued my studies after that.
Castiel said and Dean gave him a puzzled look.
Queen Mary is walking back and forth in the healing chamber, anxiously, her eyes still wet with tears.
"Yeah, actually I was. But in the morning one of my co-workers mentioned that it's Valentine's Day and all I can think about was you. I was cursing myself for forgetting about it, then I managed to end the meeting in the morning and drew back here. I wanted to do this for you but was afraid to do so because if you got upset like last time when I brought that teddy" Dean chuckled and Castiel gave him a sorry look.
"Woah, Hi to you too," Dean said a bit pouting at Cas. But Cas just rolled his eyes and turned around to go his way. But before that Dean ran in front of him and blocked his way.
"So look, I'm sorry, I actually didn't mean to fight with your boyfriend yesterday okay? It was a mistake" Dean said again nervously looking away. Shit, he hated when the 'your boyfriend' word came out from his mouth.
"I mean.. I mean your face yeah.. You know" Then he chuckled as he didn't know what the hell wrong with Castiel’s Lips, his pinky, pinky lips, ok shut up Dean.
"Thank you for your kindness, Winchester. But no. I can take my bus" Cas said quickly and turned around before Dean saying anything else indicating the conversation is over. But Dean didn't want "No" As an answer. So he tried again.
Cas sighs. Cas loves Dean so much and it's just a scenting, so Cas spreads his legs inviting Dean and giving more room to Dean.
"Yeah? Okay then, I'm disappointed by the way" Dean chuckled again sitting next to Castiel on his bed.
Dean eagerly licks a stripe on Cas’s cock head and starts to suck it. He keeps bobbing it and glances at Cas who closes his eyes tightly and licking his own lips.
"Yes thank you, Sam, oh but wait a minute"
"Oh god, I'm sorry, it's my towel, it's, it's just broken, I really can't get up like this, I mean, can you please close your eyes, I'm gonna get up really quickly," He asked like a beg.
Dean just wanted to show Cas that they are civil. But when Alfie come and all over Cas, it was kinda too hard to control himself from killing that bastard right there. But why? It's their private life. Dean just has to seduce Cas to have sex with him only once. That's all that he got to do. But why Dean can't see clearly when Alfie trying to claim Cas as his. Dean was so fucked up but he is still don't want to think about it deeply as he started to flirt with the girl stands next to him.
He just laid on his couch soon as he got home.there is few hours until he had to leave the house otherwise it would be early to go to Mary's place. He was so excited and nervous in same time so he couldn't do anything right now. Then he got an idea. Actually, this is the first time he going there it would be nice if he can bring something with him. What would be good for taking for a dinner over? Castiel didn't have lots of money for a fancy big present. And he doesn't have to impress anyone he just wants to make Mary happy and to be polite. Besides Mary never gonna accept any expensive gift if he even tries to bring them with him. So he started to pace back and forth in his room thinking more.
Dean smirked.
The pain was high but he felt its fading the ache of his heart. So that's fine that's what he wanted. It's started to blood leaking in the angry cuts and Castiel quickly washed his hand and all the blood coming out of the cuts. He kept holding his hand to the water until the bleeding stopped. His cry also fading away with the blood. His whole body was hurting. He can't say and point to a place where the pain coming from because everything is hurting. Slowly he put down the sleeves and then he felt it, he was sweating, and also he was trembling and shaking. He tried to breathe slowly, but he can't do it properly as breathe started to shortened and then started to tightness in his throat. He is having a panic attack. His hands gone to his neck grabbing it tightly as he tried to keep calm his breath, he couldn't see anything as everything gone blur. His eyes slowly go to close as suddenly he felt two hands hold his shoulders and shake him. He can hear someone calling him. "Clarence, Clarence look at me hey hey, c'mon. Breath with me slowly. C'mon you can do it honey. C'mon". Castel can hear the voice now. His vision getting to clear and his breath started to steady now. He looked at his friends who have surrounded him and trying to help him get out of the panic. Meg kept holding his hands and caressed his back smoothly talking to him. Slowly Cas got better and he started to cry.
"Yeah, I saw the way you tried to talk with him, cornering him like that, I mean c'mon man, did you really tried to bully him in this house too? I can't believe my brother will do something like that, I mean why would you hurt some innocent kid like that, you are terrifying me Dean" Sam shouted and Dean was shocked with his confession. Since Sam and Mary got to know about Dean was bullied Cas, Sam didn't even talk about it, Only Mary gave Dean a warning and a very long lecture, not to do anything like that. And Dean had to swear thousands of times that he is not a bully as they thinking and he only messing around with Cas sometimes. Anyhow Sam never brought anything about that until now. Maybe that's why Sam blasted like that suddenly. Dean really froze with that though. He always tried to be a role model to his little brother. So this is like someone slapped on him as his brother's words, shut in his mouth.
But turned out that impossible. because Dean started to bring things that no one knew Castiel liked them. Obviously only he and his family knew. That's made Castiel shocked how Dean gets to know about that. but afraid to ask how Dean got to know that, he likes the things Dean brought for Castiel.
"No. but I'm afraid to think what kind of game you gonna play today," Castiel said looking around suspiciously. Trying to hide his curiosity as big as hell. Dean laughed and shook his head as not to worry.
"Look I'm going to get up right now," Cas said quietly.
"is that so? but don't worry this doctor is a genius. Gabriel gonna be recovered soon" Dean said squeezing Castiel's hand in a reassuring way.
"Obviously because you have a terrible and cruel plan inside your cunning brain, and tell me how many people came with you?, and what's your plan? To do a sudden and unexpected attack?" Cas asks.
"Dude, you said that you are going to that girl's house," Sam said shoving his hands in the air like a complaint.
Castiel barely knew about Sam's private life at that time. He barely remembered Sam had a big brother but he had never seen him. That's why Castiel totally got screwed up when he met Dean for the first time.
