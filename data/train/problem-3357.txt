Standing shoulder to shoulder, they look over the field. Dean is reminded of the day last week that they had gone for a run and stood quietly on the end of the pier.
“Is that why you keep staring at them?”
“Uh, no, just me. I was just - ” Dean rubs at the back of his neck and glances at the pool. “Checking out the damage.”
“This way,” Dean hisses and drags Castiel across the lobby and through the ‘Employees Only’ door. Down the short hall, and into the apartment. Luckily, John had left it unlocked.
Cas nods, moving to grab one of the handles on the giant thing. He looks to Dean expectactly. Pressing his lips together, Dean grabs the other and together they heave it from the bed of the truck.
“I don’t want you to leave,” Dean murmurs.
“I couldn’t have you making a mess with that thing,” Dean says against his mouth, and he feels Cas nod.
It’s not until Bobby returns to the table that he responds, expression apologetic. “I had a suspicion.”
This late in the season and at this time of night there are very few people on the beach, mostly a stray walker or two. They wear sweatshirts, as the sun sinks and the breeze off the water comes with a chill, but Dean doesn't really notice. He sits until he’s the last person on the beach for blocks and blocks in either direction. He sits until he can see the lights of offshore freight ships twinkling in the dark - green on starboard and red on port. He sits and he wants to call out Castiel’s name, despite knowing how slim the chances are of being heard, but he stays quiet.
“I don’t need help. Go watch the movie.”
Cas’s face breaks into a grin, and Dean can’t hold his own back when he looks at him.
was at the Roadhouse. And he hates sitting at the bar when Ellen’s behind it giving him withering looks, so that means she must’ve been here all night, letting him drink in peace.
“Where are you going?” Castiel asks as Dean shoulders through the door into his bedroom.
- ” Sam says incredulously, and he looks to Dean to verify, who just shrugs. “You’re that old? You look like you’re Dean’s age.”
Head snapping back with a shout, Dean reaches up instinctively to get a hand around Alastair’s wrist. Dean twists, trying to break out of his grip, a piercing ache shooting up through his knees where they press into the dock, when he hears the unmistakable
John nods, satisfied, and all four of them stand with their bowls in their hands, rather awkwardly.
Dean was brought out of his thoughts as the doctor handed Mary a new prescription. “These should help with the side effects.”
Sam and him had been close as brothers.  The four year age gap had Sam looking up at his other brother.  It was Dean that taught Sam how to tie his shoe laces, how to catch a ball, and even on one memorable occasion, climb the tree in the backyard.
“I didn’t want to, you know, be nosy, especially without sharing myself.” Dean struggled to explain. It didn’t seem he had the same issue as Dean. Garth spoke of some illness he was struggling with. Whatever it was, it seemed Rufus had pushed to keep Garth safe and healthy.  Dean grinned as the older man came into the office, it seemed the gruff man had a thing for lost causes.
The drugs Dean was on were quite extensive, and many of them were quite damaging to his body.  In an ideal world Dean would be slowly weaned off them, but they couldn’t risk prescriptions being traced back to the Doctor’s practice.  Dr Shurley, (call me Gabe, Dr Shurley sounds like my Dad) had gone over all the symptoms Dean would be facing, giving him a daunting list of what to expect over the following months.  A part of Dean was terrified by it, but also the Doctor’s, Gabe’s calm manner, the confidence he was placing in Dean to handle it, seemed reassuring.
Dean sighed for the loss, before moving down to his old room.  It surprised him at first how bare it was. Sam’s room, long unused, still held his character.  But Dean’s seemed so bland, without character or personality.  It wasn’t that his parents had removed anything when he moved out, it was simply that there was nothing there.
When he thought of his own small apartment it was still pretty simple.  Dean was not a collector of things.  However, he could be found in the things he did have.  There was the growing collection of vinyl records that he had spent hours, scouring through second hand and retro record shops for.  It wasn’t simply is specific taste in music but also the search for the right album cover and liner notes.
“Don’t you dare give Garth more than two cups a day.”
Dean understood it, he really did.  For one, Sam was a teenager.  He was deeply concerned in the opinions of is peers.  It was a normal rite of passage.  Plus, he knew being a sub made him weird, an inconvenience and problem.  He couldn’t expect Sam to deal with that.  But he had started to miss his brother, and that separation only grew.
They had always had a good relationship.  Dean’s disability never impacted their games or came up as they obsessed about Star Wars. There were no subs in the galaxy far far away.  But as Sam grew older, and more popular, he became more aware that his brother was different.
“What are our options?” Mary asked, as she glanced over at the silent Dean.  He could see the tears glistening in her eyes.
He’d really felt confident, the next two days he started to settle into the possibility of his new life. Able to leave the apartment, he explored the area around the workshop. At first he headed out on foot cautious not to get too far from the safety of his own home. There wasn’t a lot to discover.  The area was mostly industrial, workshops and slightly dilapidated office buildings. The next day, he took the car, widening the search. He’d felt his heart raise as the fear grew.  As he drove, there was a constant call to run back to his new home, to hide away again. But he’d promised Bobby that he would push forward, that he would overcome and he couldn’t back out with such a simple task.
Castiel stood up, and promptly almost fell back down. Dean ran over to him and held his arm to keep him from collapsing.
He liked Cas, sure. The angel was his best friend.
Cas pulled back and looked deep in thought. “The spell wasn’t all that bad, was it? And how did Sam say we could break the cu-“
How fitting for the Capitol.
Dean shrugged. “I just noticed that you weren’t quite adhering to dress code, is all.” Dean pulled out his phone, opening to the pictures of the victims that Sam had sent him. Dean also made a mental note that he had a few text notifications from his brother, but decided now was not the best time to open them. “Have you seen any of these men in the past few weeks?”
. I’m not counting it a win until there is actual lip-locking, Samuel, and you shouldn’t either.” She then let out the squeal Sam had been waiting for, and threw her arms around his neck. “But yes, they did affectionately make lip-to-cheek contact, and it might not be the same as saliva-sharing, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.”
. (He had been to Hell multiple times, and felt this was a necessary comparison.)
Cas appeared suddenly on the barstool next to Sam, nearly sending him and his protein drink falling to the floor. “But I don’t eat, Dean, so technically I cannot be classified as a ‘not sane’ eater.”
"That's my chair, bitch!"
Lisa shushed him frantically, one small hand coming up to cover his mouth like she could shove the words right back in. “Dean, the cameras, remember? We don’t know where they are.”
“I - I’m sorry,” the words were out past his lips before he realized what he was saying, and then he could feel his face crumpling as he reached for something, anything to cover his ugly, scarred body. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
he couldn’t find his pillow.
Dean groaned, rolling off of his bed and face-first into the floor of his room. He didn’t even have the energy to put his hands out to catch himself, he just slid off his bed like all the bones in his body had been misplaced. (Which, it wouldn’t be the first time.)
Cas just stared back at him with wide eyes, completely flustered.
, your friend called and reserved some spots for you!”
Cas hummed along to the song, and Dean reached forward to grab his hand. Cas turned around.
Laurel sighed softly, leaned against Cas’ chest and began to sway. Cas stiffened as her hands roamed all over his back, and he looked frantically for Dean.
Cas must’ve seen the hurt in Dean’s expression, because he exhaled and continued. “What I mean is, you just be yourself, and ignore everyone else. If they want to be snooty asses, then that’s their problem. You look
The man scrunched his nose up, his black pencil mustache starting to look like a squiggle of Sharpie on his upper lip. Dean almost offered to grab a napkin and wipe it off for him.
Sam cleared his throat as he set the prompt on the table, and then smiled. He shifted himself before grabbing his stomach and miming a hearty laugh.
Dean’s smile disappeared. “I can move you into a sitting position, but I can’t untie you. Can’t take any chances with you trying to escape.”
Charlie nodded enthusiastically, drawing the attention of Dean. “What’s got you so happy, Charles? Care to share with the class?” Dean said, frowning.
Charis nodded before getting up in search of something to write with.
“Exactly, Cas!” Charlie said, and she caught his eye in the rearview mirror. “Now that we’re almost there, does anybody want any snacks?”
“Not long. Only a couple of hours.” Castiel began to move closer, seeming to sense the wave of panic about to wash over Dean. “I promise, you’re safe. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”
Castiel’s eyes opened and widened. He turned around and was face to face with a terrified looking Sam.
It was fucking
Sam stopped mid-stretch like a sasquatch caught in headlights. “Uh...no?”
The bar’s exterior was modern, all crazy geometric shapes and tin and metal where tin and metal were unnecessary. The bar was called
Dean raised a hand in a half hearted (let’s be honest, a one thirteenth hearted) effort to get up. “Too much work. Not enough energy.” Dean said.
The woman laughed. “I’m sure this will only take a few minutes,” she said, and Dean had a few more moments of internal struggle before he sat down. “What’d you want to talk to me about?”
, and since neither were ready to go to bed (or leave each other’s company), they decided to watch
and tell the police about what was going on in this house, what was happening to Sam and Dean.
Dean shrugged, smiling as he bit into a piece of bacon. “It’s all good, I have bacon.”
“I’ll be fine, bitch.”
He could go back home and keep
Winchester charm was on old ladies who had information they wouldn’t tell his giant brother (Sam could be intimidating when he was pissed off from getting hit on by one too many ladies over the age of sixty).
“Yeah?”
“I know you have no reason to trust me,” Castiel started, and Dean nearly snorted.
"Do you think they'll have their gay awakening in the kitchen? Slow dancing together with a bottle of wine?" Charlie asked, slapping her knee. Sam had only seen people do that in movies, but it fit Charlie’s mood perfectly.
but Dean wouldn’t-
“I should call Dean. We have a development, even if the case isn’t solved yet,” Sam said, reaching for his phone. “Eileen, you’re the best.”
“If you guys are done staring soulfully into each other’s eyes, I would like to go inside and get drunk now,” Sam commented, his voice unnaturally bright. Dean flipped him off, but his giant little brother had already opened the door and was holding it ajar. Dean rushed inside before he realized he was still wearing the trench coat.
Dean pasted on a lopsided grin before turning back to Charlie and Sam. “Yup! A couple! Alright, I’m tired as hell, I’m going to bed. Goodnight!” He said, voice full of fake cheer to cover up his need to kiss Cas again.
of criminals and it all went to hell. I extracted him and saved his life,” Cas turned his gaze onto Dean and the adoration in his eyes surprised even him. “Our love just sort of blossomed from there.”
So, they’d need an ironclad strategy that had the best chance of one of them surviving. Dean tried very hard to think about how, even if one of them won, it meant the other would be dead. “Okay, so.” He leaned forward, putting his tactical brain to use, recalling previous Games he’d watched. “You’re unmated. And pretty. You don’t want to catch the wrong eye, but you don’t want to be completely unlikeable either, or they’ll kill you off.”
“Well, and then I said, ‘that’s interestiiiing’-“ Becky suddenly stopped, and brought a hand to her mouth.
Dean watched as Castiel’s body relaxed and his breathing evened out before he walked out of his room and closed the door behind him.
Dean nodded mechanically, and Castiel was honestly surprised he didn’t salute.
Dean quieted, rebelliously muttering, until the sense of her words sunk in and he stopped.
The bustling of people was overwhelming, some dressed in fancy clothes Dean had only ever seen rich people wear, some in clothes that barely covered anything.
“I don’t know,” he burst out. “I don’t know who he is or what he wants, or what he’s going to do to me. He acts like he’s nice and actually cares but for all I know, he saw me up on that stage and figured he could get someone to keep his bed warm that he could beat on, and a free vacation to the Capitol, and he isn’t going to try to help us at all. For all I know, he’s gonna send me into the arena with my ass ripped open from struggling on his knot!” Dean paused to take a breath, his shoulders heaving.
leave a comment? your reactions and this posting schedule are some of the only things keeping me sane and alive :)
Someone-probably Sam-banged on the bathroom door and Dean just sang louder in response. “
Sam looked down and groaned. "Seriously?!" The box was covered in freaking
He felt vaguely like a cat, and the thought made him sneeze.
So he wanted to do it himself. Dean’s lip quivered as he dropped his hands and let himself be maneuvered into their large en-suite bathroom.
Dean had been avoiding Cas since Charlie and Sam had picked them up at the craft store the night before, and Cas had no idea why.
Dean heard a squeak from somewhere in the dark, and he cracked open one eye while he took off his bloodied jeans. Castiel was looking into the corner of the room with wide eyes, holding a squirming piece of darkness. “Dean, please.”
“Make my wish come trueeeeeeee. Aaaaaall I want for Christmaaaaasss-“ Dean stopped prematurely for a breath.
Charlie smiled and held up her pointer finger. She rummaged around in her bag and grabbed a small pasta angel she had made when she was a child. She handed it to Cas, his nimble fingers taking the creation with care.
“‘Cause I fucking kidnapped you and I can make you suffer.”
, or that it really matters, and she’s a very attractive woman-“ Cas winced. “I-you-not that I’m
He wasn’t sure which abyss, but he was confident in his analogy.
Someone cleared their throat behind them. Dean turned to see a middle aged man in a Peacekeeper uniform standing in the doorway with Ellen Harvelle.
Dean sighed. Of course this would happen to him. Why wouldn’t it? Of all the criminals in Kansas, he just so happened to be the one that stole a car with a man in it.
Well, more like he held Castiel’s hands together and forced him forward, ‘cause the shoelaces were starting to come untied and Dean still needed to be a threatening presence.

Dean looked at his phone and nodded. “Yeah, man, right here.” Dean showed Cas the message.
“Fuckin’ asshole,” Luke mumbled as he handed Dean some money. Dean gave him a sleepy smile in return, missing the money the first time he reached for it, because there were four Lukes and he was having a hard time figuring out which one was actually there.
Dean could feel Cas’ gaze boring a hole into the side of his head as he looked at Sam, all faux-innocence. “Miami, of course.”
special thanks to everyone who left a comment or kudos, you guys really make my day every time I see a new one <3
Castiel giggled. He
Suddenly, he dropped his bowl of muffin mix. “
Sam got up and went looking around for a book. “I’ll bet you I know what it is,” he said, finding a book and slamming it down on the table. He opened it to a page and ran his finger over the lines while mumbling something to himself.
Dean stood still (in terror or anticipation, he wasn’t sure) as Cas stepped forward with green paint on his finger and drew a dot right in between Dean's eyebrows. Dean felt the confusion on his face, and Cas murmured softly, "I didn't want to cover your freckles.”
"It's fine, really, you saved me from hours of frustratingly staring at my book and still not comprehending anything. Besides," Castiel lifted his honeybee book up for the boy to see. "It wasn't all bad."
“And how are my favorite young men doing over here?” Laurel said, standing above their table like an intimidating grandma.
“Sure, sugar, but not here. Out back in five minutes?” The woman said under her breath as she walked past Dean, brushing his shoulder. Dean nodded like a dumbass before he realized she wasn’t even in the room anymore.
he couldn’t untie Castiel.
Dean started unlacing his work boots. The shoelaces were strong, they probably wouldn’t hold the man when he woke up, but it was better than nothing, Dean supposed.
“Sorry,” Cas said, and he eased his foot off the gas pedal.
“Lise?” He asked quietly. “Are you all right?”
“He seems like a nice kid,” Castiel said loudly, like he had no regard for his personal safety. Dean flinched and looked over his shoulder, but could still hear the voices on the TV from where they were.
Everybody shook their heads. Sam raised his hand as if to say he did want snacks, but Charlie immediately shot him a glare that said
Dean bounced back against his seat, wincing when it put an odd angle on his knees. “
,” Dean sang as he dropped his duffel bag on the lime green couch that had some questionable stains.
was making his fingers twitch.
Sam shuffled forward but then back again, unsure. “Um…”
Dean scoffed. “What are you, fucking twelve? No!” He threw the car into park and ran his hands through his hair, pulling at the strands until he could think straight. “Just let me- let me figure this out.”
Ambrosia gasped. “Oh my, that’s just awful.”
how much she had scared him.
Next, Cas started to unbutton his shirt, his eyes set squarely on a point in the back of the room. He glanced at Dean when he heard the hunter inhale sharply, but when he looked, green eyes were averted somewhere just over his shoulder.
Dean huffed a laugh. He took one of Cas’ hands in his and placed the other on the angel’s upper back.
Charis put a hand on her chin. “He looks vaguely familiar, yes. I do believe I saw him at a bar or restaurant since I’ve been here, but I don’t really remember much before about three days ago.” She smiled apologetically before leaning in and stage whispering “Miami sure knows how to party, doesn’t it?”
Castiel took a step towards the man, and the man slid backwards, towards Ellen. “I’m sorry?”
Dean pasted on his patented Winchester smile. “My-“ he glanced at Cas. Boyfriend? Husband? Fiancé? What was Cas supposed to be?
“Dude, look.” She pointed over to them, and Sam followed the direction of her finger over to his brother and their angel, who had just pushed off the side of the rink while holding hands.
Dean snorted and ran a hand through his hair. “I think that’s an understatement, Cas.” He grabbed his phone and dialed Sam’s number.
But if their dad found out Castiel escaped, would Sam and Dean last long enough for Castiel to get them help?
“Dean! Get in the damn car!” Cas practically yelled, startling the other three.
“I hate goddamn crocodile tears,” Dean stated bluntly, and he wasn’t really sure why, but Cas burst out laughing.
Dean was sure he had never heard anyone use a semicolon while speaking before.
He passed Sammy on his way up, his little brother struggling not to cry. “It‘ll be okay,” Dean whispered to him, knowing full well that that was a promise he couldn’t keep.
The ransom drop had gone successfully, Dean concluded proudly, because he watched from a distance as Luke and Alastair pulled their truck to a stop along the road. They got out, drenched immediately in the rain, and Dean watched as another truck pulled up beside them, and John hopped out.
There were giant buildings, huge spires that reached up toward the sky, built with incredible architectural skill. Everything was so perfect and shiny, there must have been so many people living there… Dean was completely awestruck.
Dean was never one to ditch out in the middle of a date. But
he was going to do about making sure Castiel actually did go home.
Castiel laughed, a giddy laugh that verged on a giggle, and Dean treasured the calm it brought him. Once he stopped, the grin Dean got was enough to make him smile in return. “Bacon is quite delicious, isn’t it?”
- would correct him.
Cas shifted uncomfortably. "I am not an expert baker."
“Okay. I think we can talk to our stylist about that,” Lisa mused. “So, how are you going to deal with Castiel?”
’ but decided that was information Castiel didn’t need to know.
“I think it’s truly poetic that they chose that tree, Sam. It’s almost like it's a Freudian slip or something.” Charlie whispered to Sam, under the cover of the Metallica blaring through the speakers.
Dean laughed. “Very, very exciting.”
No wonder Cas had only gotten laid once. If that was his best line, Dean wondered how he even managed to function.
They walked up to the doors of the restaurant and entered, a breeze of fresh, air-conditioned air blasting in Dean’s face like he just opened a door into Antarctica. Cas led him towards the waiter at the entrance (when had Cas grabbed his hand?) and smiled.
want it to be a country song.” He flipped through the channels until he found one he liked and tapped the steering wheel nervously. “Alright, here goes nothing.”
The man crossed his arms and looked at Dean, obviously not buying it. “If you let me go right now, I won’t tell anybody anything. Promise.”
Castiel nodded slowly, because that whole interaction had been...well,
As he walked towards the campus library in a flurry of snow, Castiel considered the consequences of just dropping out as opposed to actually studying. All of his pre-med classes were excruciatingly boring, his head a mixing pot of Latin terms, the human anatomy, and random physics problems he had no use for. Castiel shivered as a particularly violent gust of wind wove its fingers through his hair, and he pulled his jacket tighter around him.
and charades. Unless you guys wanna play hide ‘n’ seek or something.” Charlie said, and Dean grunted in agreement (she hoped).
the chapters will be getting longer soon, promise! :))
Castiel whispered, looking horrified.
“What can I get you boys to drink today?” A young waitress walked up, pen poised over her notepad to take their order.
Dean looked down at him with a raised eyebrow. Castiel put his (newly freed) hands up. “Hey, man, you try staying in the same position all night.”
Cas smirked and Dean thought he heard a chuckle from down the hallway.
Cas’ hands flew up to his mouth and he looked at Sam with pleading eyes.
Cas looked at Dean dubiously, a small smile struggling to surface on his lips. “Fuck off, Watson.”
Instead, he pulled her into a tight hug, and she buried her face in his neck, the way she used to when they were hugging on the schoolyard, back when the Games were a distant fear, almost a bump-in-the-night for her.
This was going to be fun.
“We’re quite well, thank you.” Cas said politely, not taking his eyes off of his drawing.
Dean blinked at him
tired, and he wanted to get out of his fucking tuxedo and into some comfy flannel pajama pants and just collapse into bed with his angel.
“Don’t ‘Deeeean’ me, Charles. I don’t do Christmas trees. Right, Sammy?” Dean was cooking breakfast in the kitchen, his
“I didn’t
Bob made a sound that sounded vaguely like a hiss and Dean sneezed in response, sending both cats flying off the bed in an attempt to flee. “Bob is a grumpy old man, I rescued him from a retirement home.”
Dean knew what that meant, and shakily raised his hands to Castiel’s belt, fumbling with the buckle. His fingers didn’t want to cooperate. He was struggling with it still when broad, tanned fingers gently lifted his hands away. “Dean,
Dean sat up, and Cas whimpered a little at the loss of contact, but if there was a problem, Dean needed to fix it. The night had been too precious for them to be ambushed by something supernatural.
The Reaping that was the following day.

make Dean’s heart stutter like it just ran into a brick wall.
It took two rings for the Sasquatch to pick up.
Cas chuckled. “I love you, too. There, are you happy?”
Carver Edlund?”
Dean brushed a lock of hair off of Cas’ forehead. “Are you mad that I came out onto the beach with a pretty lady instead of finishing dinner with you?”
“Dean, so help me, I will get Cas in here and he will teleport your ass into the war room.”
“Fine, whatever, but I don’t need you acting like my mother, Cas. Sam already does that enough for the both of you.” Sam ignored the jab and hummed along happily to the song on the radio, causing Dean to look over at Sam in surprise. Sam never liked the music Dean picked.
Cas nodded, and he politely placed his sugar packet to the side (he had discovered while fumbling with the packet that sugar was a replacement for honey, and couldn’t stand to think of the betrayal to his bee friends). “I think that could help us with this case, yes.”
Unless Castiel got an offer for him. Buying and selling omegas was technically still illegal, but that was hardly ever enforced.
Cas grinned, either oblivious to or ignoring the blush making itself known on Dean’s cheeks. “Uh-um-follow me,
“What the fuck happened to the rope?” Dean asked, eyes widening, ‘cause if he were in Castiel’s position, he would’ve punched Dean unconscious and fled by now.
“Let’s go check in, Dean,” Cas said, breaking Dean out of his trance. Dean shook his head once to clear his mind and wiped some drool off the side of his mouth.
Cas was sitting on the counter, which was covered in white (it looked like powder,
They fell in with the crowd as they got closer, and Dean waved to Lisa, a pretty omega woman about his age who Dean had once dated, back before they both presented.
Dean’s Mariah Karaoke is pretty good, huh? Who woulda thunk it? ;)
“Oh, Ellen! Twenty nine is a good year for you, my dear!” A short man with wild blonde hair said, running up to their escort with open arms. He winked flirtatiously at her, and Dean watched in confusion.
Dean grabbed Charlie's arm to keep her from ditching it into the hallway. "Okay, first of all, this is supposed to be a hidden base, so I don't think we should have lights outside, because it could lead literally
“Dean?”
Dean glanced down to Cas’ lips, into his eyes, then back down to his lips. Dean leaned in, and Cas’ breath caught-
“Well! I was coming over to tell you boys that it’s time for our dance break!” She said, her (predatory) eyes landing on Cas.
“Dean, I would like to learn how to drive.”
“We can get dessert in the room,” Dean whispered, his voice hoarse as he stared into Cas’ eyes.
They were not handling it well.
Dean laughed again and nodded. “Just to make sure.” Cas leaned forward and kissed Dean one more time, a longer kiss where the hunter put his hands behind the angel’s neck and Cas laid Dean down in the back seat of the Impala.
Castiel scooted his chair back as quietly as he could, the wooden legs scratching at the carpeted floor. As Castiel stood up, the stranger
He didn’t move, he couldn’t feel, but then suddenly a heavy pressure was applied to his chest, and
“Charlie, you’re going to rot your teeth, and then you’ll have to go to Garth’s dentistry place!” Sam cried, feeling very scandalized that everyone in the room would choose cookies over vegetables.
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie ruined the moment with a moan from behind them as she bit into another cookie.
. He cleared his throat and after an awkward moment of staring at the angel and willing him to stop looking (and being) so damn wonderful, Dean untangled himself from Cas and excused himself to the bathroom.
Castiel just stared at Gabriel, mouth slightly ajar.
and Dean was tempted to just hang up on him. “I mean, why haven’t you answered any of my texts? You practically dropped off the face of the planet!”
And the
Dean looked at Cas with a raised eyebrow.
Dean was still looking into Cas' eyes, with obsidian pupils almost overtaking forest irises. Cas licked his lips involuntarily, and when Dean’s eyes followed the movement, Cas could feel a heat uncurling deep in his gut. Dean looked back into Cas' eyes, leaning forward, his movements infinitely small and slow. Cas could hear his heart pounding in his ears, and he was about to close his eyes (he didn’t know why, but he was just mirroring the hunter) when Dean stopped moving.
able to suppress his laugh to an aggressive exhale through his nose.
, then we can move on to the one about the reindeer with the abnormally colored nose." Cas decided, and the other three nodded as they bustled around the kitchen collecting snacks and drinks.
Maybe December wouldn't be so bad after all.
Dean scanned the bar for his date. He had no idea what she would look like, and honestly, he was starting to regret that stupid dating app when a woman walked up to him with a wide smile.
And then all the memories of the day before came flooding back.
“Why can’t yo-“ Castiel began to say, but was interrupted by a crash and some muffled yelling coming from downstairs.
"Do you guys get it?" Sam asked, his voice full of hope.
"I-Well, it's closing time now, I was about to wake you up to leave." Castiel gestured loosely to his textbook, which held a small pool of drool. The boy looked down at the textbook, a faint blush creeping onto his high cheekbones, fighting for dominance among the constellations of freckles there. "So it's-" Castiel looked at his phone "-nine forty five."

Dean coughed a little (again) before making a weird gesture with his hand. “What do you think rule number two should be?”
Dean blinked. “W - why would I need a place to stay?”
, Sam got up and stretched his back, saying he would see everyone the following day.
this chapter is where the non-con comes into play, and it’s VERY graphic, so please be careful
(See the end of the chapter for
"But I'm keeping Cas company, huh, Cas?" Dean said, elbowing Cas in the arm and refusing to drop Charlie’s gaze. The angel looked up and nodded, as if to say
"Dudes, these are
“Lisa Braeden,” Ellen read. “Please come up to the stage.”
Castiel stiffened. “A ransom?”
Cas and Dean didn’t respond, they just nodded absentmindedly and continued smiling at each other.
“You guys seen Cas?”
Sam had found this bar on Google maps, his gargantuan hands clicking away at the little keys on his new phone (his last one had been crushed by an anti-industrialism ghost; they had decided as a group to not speak of it ever again.) “It’ll be fun!” He’d said, sounding all too much like a little kid begging to go to an amusement park. “It’s a bar, Dean, c’mon.”
Dean just about jumped Cas’ bones right then and there, and had to excuse himself to the bathroom to take a good, long look at the man in the mirror (for the second time since they’d arrived).
“You’re back? You remember me?” Dean asked hoarsely, looking around at the mess that had been their (
“I don’t know where to get one either, so do your research and we’ll go grab one. We are
“I think I love you, Cas,” Dean said quietly.
“I’ll see you around, Cas.” Dean got out of the car reluctantly, already missing the sense of safety that being near Castiel gave him. He looked through the passenger window and smiled at Castiel, who returned it.
Charis beamed at the large man who came out of the bathroom. “Agents, this is Harold. Harold, this is Agent Trevor and Agent Prince.”
Alastair was pointing to a sign on the side of the road, near some old crossroads. It had -Dean took a minute to count- eight sides (was that a...pentagon? Dean knew it wasn’t a square, but he couldn’t remember the name), some bullet holes, and was red.
Dean sang quietly, pulling Baby into a parking space. He shut the radio off and grabbed his keys before he got out and ran towards the store entrance.
“Can you just get dressed, please?” Cas asked, his voice small. Dean nodded, and grabbed his tuxedo from Cas’ arms, then walked stiffly into the bathroom.
“Okay, I got it!” She exclaimed triumphantly, before taking a few steps back from the table.
Charlie and Sam gave them blank stares.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean cut himself off with a cry, and he fell to the ground as pain blinded him. His ankle was caught in a hole -by the feel of it, a small hole for rear view mirrors or miscellaneous trinkets John found in cars.
Naomi had blue eyes.
“With my credit card!” Charlie retorted, setting her bags down with a
Maybe it was time Dean re-thought his life choices.
“Dean, you can go,” Cas said, his voice almost lost to the sound of Grace’s crying and the loud thumping of the music.
"I told you guys it would be fun!” Sam smiled as he painted a neon pink streak down his cheek, the paint glowing in the dark of the bar.
And nope, that didn’t help Dean’s morning wood
, he stayed looking at Cas until the angel’s eyes closed and his breathing evened out. He looked so peaceful in sleep, so beautiful.
When he got through the entrance of the mall, he stopped short.
“I just- I’m really tired, Cas,” Dean said, turning away from him and standing up, offering a hand to Cas.
Dean heard the water turn off and quickly finished untying his shoe. He stood up in his socked feet and turned towards the bathroom, right as Cas walked out.
Dean sighed. “Listen, I was having the same problem as Cas today at the grocery store. I kept singing freaking
Cas looked to Dean for help. “I’m Agent Trevor, this is my partner Agent Prince,” Dean said, gesturing to Cas before he paused.
Cas was about to flip over and stare at the ceiling, wallowing in his misery (again) when his door opened.
But that’s all they were, just dreams. Nothing more than a fantasy that Dean needed to let play out. And while that was happening (and his dick was getting more attention than it deserved), Dean just needed to make sure to stay away from the angel.
“Excuse me, but some of us need actual sleep,” Sam said, yawning.
Cas stiffened.
Dean’s eyes widened.
Dean blanched. “That might just be what they want you to think. We’ll have to double check?”
Lisa’s eyes widened and she looked around the train car frantically. “
He was doing this for Sam, he was. He would make it back and make sure his brother never had to shed another tear ever again.
It was fucking
Charlie nodded again. “Cas?”
Dean was silent, wondering that very same thing. “Dean?” Lisa was scared on his behalf, which was sweet of her. He just couldn’t handle her gentle concern, though.
"Dean, I have no idea. Maybe we have to face our fears? I got no clue, man." Sam said, pulling at his (luscious) hair. "What scares you the most of this whole situation?"
Cas nodded slowly at this sentiment before continuing. “You told me I was useless, and then walked away. I tried to follow you. I tried, Dean, I really did, but then I watched you die. You were
Castiel made a little gasping sound, though he had no idea he was capable of it. “If you let me go, I can help. I can help you, and I can help Sam-“
“What happened to your project, Dean?” Cas asked, the worry in his voice nearly over powered with curiosity.
Dean looked at his burger with pure love in his eyes. He sunk his teeth into the burger and looked to the water-stained ceiling of the diner, thanking a God he didn’t believe in for every kind of meat imaginable.
vibes.
“Hey Sam, do you think we should-“
how many times I’ve wanted to murder you, sunshine.”
It was a soft kiss, gentle, tender, like Cas still wasn’t sure if Dean wanted this, giving him space to pull away. Dean sighed happily and leaned into it, putting one hand on the angel’s shoulder and intertwining the other in the soft, tenebrous curls at the base of Cas’ neck. Cas framed Dean’s jaw with his hand, and Dean was about to add his tongue to the mix when Sam cleared his throat.
“I don’t know. I mean, he’s an alpha. But sometimes he seems… nice, almost.” Dean stared out the window, watching the world go by. Castiel was an enigma. Dean didn’t know him; the kindness could be a facade, but somehow he seemed genuine.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Dean that had kidnapped him and put him in this position in the first place.
Cas’ face fell, and he turned towards his window as Dean started the car. “I’ve seen a lot of movies,” he muttered, and Dean turned on the radio, oblivious to the change of attitude in the car.
Dean sang back, his voice tight and breaking through the last words. “Oh my god.”
your responsibility. She’s our little sister, Dean, you said so yourself.”
So he wanted Dean on the bed, which meant Dean’s ass was on the line. He hoped he’d be allowed time to prepare himself, but that was seeming less and less likely. “Y-yes, alpha,” he murmured, standing on shaky legs, hoping his terror wasn’t as glaringly obvious as it seemed to be.
Cas continued to color, humming softly to a song Dean
Dean blinked and glanced at Castiel’s face, which was open and inviting and tinged with concern. He watched curiously as Castiel set a pile of clothes on the counter and kept a safe distance in between them. “Y-yes, alpha.”
Dean let go of Lisa’s hand to touch the necklace Sam had given him.
Sam flinched and walked over to sit back down on the bed. “I’m just going to stay here,” he squeaked quietly, pulling his knees up to rest his chin on them. He rocked back and forth gently, foot tapping anxiously on the bed.
Cas loved being bossy, and Dean didn’t mind it one bit. (It was pretty cute, if Dean was being honest.)
“Sam,” Castiel breathed, but the rest of his apology died on his tongue. Sam stared at him for a minute before looking down at the man -
Dean mulled this over. “Yeah, that could work.” He looked at Cas skeptically. “So not only do we have to act like federal dicks, but we gotta act like a couple at the same time?”
It was actually a decent angle to cover. Dean mulled it over. Cas was dead. That scared him. Dean was stuck in a nightmare he often had, causing him to wake up to Sam holding down his shoulders as Cas whispered Enochian to him. That scared him. But what scared him the most?
so there is a graphic description of drowning in here, just a heads up <3
The lights turned white, and Dean turned toward Cas, the green of his eyes standing out against the bright lights behind him. They looked like a forest, brimming with life and emotion and nature.
“If someone says ‘Merry Christmas’ one more damn time, I
. Dean may be willing to give Cas the world, but
“Sir? May I have permission to speak?” Dean asked, a bit unnerved by this whole situation. Not only was he being carted to his death, but he also was expected to hand his life over to this man, someone he had never met before.
Sam laughed. “Yes, you’re an idiot. Jerk.”
"Huh, that was weird.” Dean said, turning and coming face to face with Cas.
he was feeling. Eew.
That’s how it happened.
“You a fed?” The woman asked suspiciously as Dean approached.
, Sam blinked and seemed to notice the (not frayed, despite Castiel’s best efforts) rope that was keeping Castiel tied to the bedpost.
Eileen blushed and grabbed the spoon from Sam’s uneaten soup. “You’re not so bad yourself, Sam.”
Dean turned around slowly, focusing his eyes on his angel, who was now standing. Dean looked at the halo and swirl of paint on his face from earlier; the rumpled trench coat that had somehow managed to make itself back onto its rightful owner in the midst of alcohol, magic, and sappy love confessions; his tousled black hair; his ocean blue eyes that were staring back at him. Dean grinned like an idiot at Cas, not really sure what to say, as his mind randomly decided to listen to the
lips that would be awful for kissing. Just horrible. And they totally wouldn’t look oh so good wrapped around Dean’s dick, those blue, blue eyes looking up at Dean through those inky black lashes.
Dean put the Impala in park and leaned back against the seat, running a hand through his hair. “This is not going as well as I thought it would,” Dean said under his breath.
Dean rolled his eyes and smiled as he walked over to his car. “Heya, Baby,” he whispered, running a careful hand over her top. “Lookin’ good, sorry I had to leave ya, but you know how it goes.”
Dean snapped his fingers. “We can each sing and see who sings back!”
“We shall,” Dean said, and before he could reconsider, he offered Cas his arm (like the gentleman he was). Cas hesitantly took it, his touch feather light. “Let’s go be some grandiloquent sons of bitches.”
“Why does this feel like goodbye?”
No take backs, no miracles, no acts of spontaneous resurrection brought about by over-emotional, over-powered beings.
Sam’s gaze flicks back to Dean, still al little puzzled, but he knows better than to ask Dean to fill in all the blanks.
He pushes the heels of his hands into his eyes, smearing wetness around more than wiping it away. He moves to rub the scratchy forearm of his jacket across his face, to maybe do a little better at sopping the damp. He spots the red, then… the blood. Sees the shape of it and is reminded once again.
He really isn’t ready to face it himself. He’s avoided it from… well, probably from the beginning. Because somewhere in those first moment of Cas’s grace taking him up, rescuing him from the depths of the fiery abyss, it touched his soul and left an indelible mark. He’s done his best to bury it away ever since.
They’d gotten by for
“Took Cas,” Sam concludes.
Cas’ eyes are wet and shining and when he says, “Because it is.”
, all along … for years, probably. Deep down he’s always known. But he’s never bucked the status quo and never dragged all those dark, little boxed-away secrets and feelings into the light because if there’s one thing Dean has learned it’s that he doesn’t get ‘happy’; he doesn’t get good things. He doesn’t get to keep the things that he…
His name being called and echoing through the halls of the bunker.
Jack is looking between them, taking his cues from Sam and Dean both, and his nod is slower, more deliberate, but he gives it.
Dean nods, just a fraction, barely a dip of his chin. “Empty stopped Death, but…”
Sam’s mouth drops at the corners, confusion dragging them down.
They’ve said goodbye before, and he tries to remember that, to focus on that, but
it to Cas, “He didn’t sacrifice himself for
“Popping people out of existence. It wasn’t Billy.”
He said it because he knew he’d never have to see Dean again. Never have to risk whatever Dean might give back to him. A fist, a laugh… a kiss.
“Yeah,” he says again. “Yeah, kid. I guess that’s what we do.”
“Right, well… I suppose we should go figure out how to save the world.”
“How? Was it Billy?”
It’s Sam.
Sam glances between them, confused.
He wants to beg and to plead and to pray to the universe, to fix this, dammit! To make it right. But he knows that’s just Chuck, and he’s an asshole and he’s probably laughing about this right now - about how well it fits into his glorious narrative. Dean wants to plead to something else,
And that makes him feel like he’s betraying memories of people he’s loved, people who’d had a place in his heart long before a reaching out hand seared itself onto his soul.
And then, because it feels like instead of the little miniscule rivulet of emotion he meant to let trickle out past the floodgates, a torrent rushes out instead, crashing the barriers and forcing them wide.
“No,” Sam, amends, shaking his head slow and deliberate. It looks like the heaviest thing in the world. “No, Dean.
He wants Cas to take it back. He doesn’t want to face what it means.
“Dammit, Cas.”
“Dammit. I will always, always love you.” It’s a whisper, a breath. It doesn’t even carry far enough into the room to echo off the stone floor or the shelves or the shattered remnants of a door. But it reverberates around him nonetheless, ringing in his ears, pulsing through his veins with every heartbeat.
“Everyone,” Jack says.
And keeps echoing over and over. So, he builds up the walls again, blocks it out, subsumes it beneath bitterness and betrayal and heartache. He shunts it away to that place within that will never, ever be cracked open again. He knows that, now.
“I love you.”
“When I was gone,” Jack begins, tone gentle and flat. “After I died, Cas came to heaven to get me. The Empty was there, and she caught me, and she wasn’t going to let me go. So, Cas made a deal. His life for mine.  And she accepted his bargain, but didn’t take him right then. She wanted him to suffer, so she said that if the moment ever came that Cas ever experienced true happiness, that’s when she would come for him.”
“No, it’s fine, really. Martha Stewart is a total bitch. I get my information from
Dean opened his mouth to reply but before he could, there was a knock at the door. Dean’s entire body tensed up and he put a finger to his mouth.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice was small, and Dean looked up at him to find his kid brother looking at
“Dean, the steering wheel is moving on its own! I’m not even touching it!”
How was that even
Castiel blinked his eyes open and threw the pillow to the side, hands blindly groping the bed for Dean. He turned towards the door, and was met with the sight of Dean pulling on a pair of boots and Sam watching impatiently by the door.
Dean and Cas exchanged a glance as the door to the bathroom opened. “Christie, who the hell-?”
The song on the radio changed, and a little bit of static came through. Castiel furrowed his forehead and went over to the radio to tap on it.
“I’ll tell you all about it in the car, Cas. Although it was pretty-uh-pretty-“ Dean trailed off and scratched the back of his neck. He turned to look Cas out of the corner of his eye, his body at a forty five degree angle between the door and the-
Castiel turned around as Dean’s knees hit the floor, and surprise painted his features. “Dean?” he asked, his alpha voice still in full effect, whether he knew it or not.
. Then he opened his mouth and sucked in a breath, like he was gonna say something. Then he closed his mouth and continued staring.
Dean was unprepared.
Cas was trying valiantly to hold back a smile, and Dean waved a hand in his general direction. “You can laugh, man. I’m truly, pathetically wasted.”
“I’m going to untie you now,” Dean explained, climbing onto the bed and kneeling behind Castiel.
“What’s up, buttercup?” Charlie asked as nonchalantly as she could. She reached for her Hello Kitty bag, but a hand on her arm and some pleading eyes from Cas stopped her. “Cas?”
, if Alastair didn’t kill him, he might do it himself.
Hallmark movies? Like at all? Because we all know how the fake dating story ends!”
Dean’s throat suddenly had a lump, and he cursed whoever was out there that puppy dog eyes were a thing and that Castiel wore them so damn
Then Dean threw his head back and laughed, a full body laugh in which he had to hold onto the back of the seat to keep from toppling backwards.
“Well-uh-listen, Cas, Christmas is something I used to do with my parents. Like, every year, we’d go all out, with lights and caroling and milk and cookies-“ Charlie smiled wistfully, lost in a different time. She sniffled once before continuing. “And you know how Sam is, all ‘let’s talk about our feelings’ all the time, and so I told him about it and how lonely I’ve been every Christmas since they died. I’m just so happy to be sharing the most wonderful time of the year with my found family that it gets to be a little much sometimes, you know?”
Dean only realized he was still staring at Cas when the angel began to stand up. “No, but if we find any new information we’ll be sure to inform you.” He shook Ambrosia’s hand and strutted towards the door.
to happen, but nothing did. Tisiphone’s face twisted into a smirk at his expectations.
“Would you-” Dean licked his lips and put a hand behind his neck. Then he took a deep breath, set his jaw, and looked at Cas, determination on his face. “Would you like to cuddle with me?”
“Look at me,” she hissed back. “I’ll be the weakest one in that arena.” She wasn’t wrong. She was tiny, with little muscle mass. Dainty. Dean was probably going to have to watch her get ripped apart.
innuendo? Fumbling over his words? That was not Dean.
“Come in,” he squeaked, then he cleared his throat and repeated himself.
"So, Cas, since the library's closing and I jipped us both a good two hours of study time, how about I take you out for coffee or cocoa and we head back to my place?" Dean said as he stood and began to gather his things. He lifted a hand to the back of his neck, the blush on his cheeks becoming more prominent as he realized the implication of what he said. "To study, I mean. Obviously. That's what I meant. Studying."
“Sounds like some James Bond shit right there,” Dean replied, taking another generous bite of his breakfast. “No one’s ever cared enough about me to do some James Bond shit.”
Cas’ adorable little frown deepened. “No. You, stay,” he said, snuggling deeper into Dean’s warmth and tightening his grip around him. “Stay.”
“I’m fine, ‘m fine. Me ‘n Sammy are both with our Uncle Bobby, he’s real nice, was a family friend back when-“ Dean paused, and Castiel’s heart ripped in half like a kindergartener’s Valentine’s card. “-when Mom was alive. And it doesn’t matter how I got this number, what matters is that I’m about to ask you a very important question.”
“You thirsty or anything?” Dean asks as he unlocks the apartment door. “You sure you don’t want to go in the pool for a couple hours?”
Dean chuckles. “We can get cotton candy later.”
Cas nods, and takes the shot, and Dean hoots when the ball lands perfectly in the cup. There are cheers from a few people who were standing around and watching, but Cas only has attention for Dean, turning to beam at him. Cas’s face is absolutely lit up, his eyelids noticeably dropping with alcohol and fuck, Dean wants to kiss him so bad.
The tanks that guide them down the hall are full of the most brightly-colored fish Dean has ever seen, and the corral practically glows. At the end of the hall, they step into the main section of the building and all three of them stop in their tracks, dumbfounded.
Reaching out with a wet hand, Cas drips on the floor as he grabs hold of the front of Dean’s t-shirt and pulls him down to himself. With a soft chuckle, Dean goes easily, and he feels Cas’s grin against his lips as their mouths meet.
Dean walks away.
“Yeah.”
“I already bought the stuff from him. You can pay me back later. And I won’t even charge you for what he smokes,” she jerks her head towards Cas. “Because I love you so much and want you to come.”
Traffic isn’t too bad driving down to the inlet, but all the stop lights make it take about fifteen minutes to get there. Dean drives around looking for a parking spot around Dorchester Street.
With the dancing glow across his upturned cheeks, Castiel is iridescent. There’s a shine in his eyes and a softness to the set of his mouth that Dean can feel viscerally, blunt beneath his ribs. Cas must sense him staring because he turns, but when their eyes meet Cas’s face doesn’t lose the look of astonishment.
“Yes,” he says, but Dean has a strange suspicion that there’s more to it.
“Does your father know?”
“They got nothin’ to do with what you done, or haven’t done, or whether you did enough for him - whether you were enough for him. You hear me, kid?”
Cas looks pleased at that.
“We won a few games, yeah,” Dean says. He jostles Cas with his elbow. “Cas carried the team, though. I think I only made like four cups all night.”
“Is that like... young? For mermen?”
Clutching each other, they make out in the dark, standing in Dean’s bedroom in the middle of the night.
“Well, there was no need to be,” Dean says shortly. He straightens the covers on his bed, where the two of them had rumpled them just minutes before, and pulls them back to climb inside. “Are you gettin’ in bed or not?”
Coral hears him coming from her square of sun on the checkout counter and blinks her eyes open, raising her head. She stretches as he approaches and he can’t help but smile at the way she spreads her toes and yawns before sitting up on her haunches, wrapping her tail around herself.
“John, you can’t say that, you can’t stop this.”  Mary’s voice matched the brokenness in John’s voice, hers also showing a level of grief.
Garth cut him off “Different things maybe, but still surrounded with misinformation and bigotry. And you’re sick right now, so I’m going to help you.  Its as much about me paying back for what I received as your own needs.”
“Pretty much.”  Rufus waved to the seat opposite him. “I am glad you are doing better Dean. Now things are settling down with the meds. We, well, you are going to have to start dealing with the symptoms, with learning to live with your disability.”
Dean thinks that it surprised everyone, himself included, how quickly he managed to pick up things. On one day, when Bobby he stomped in, locking himself in his office, Dean had been left to his own devices.  Without anything specified on his work list, Dean had found a chassis in a work bay and had started to tinker. Tinkering quickly became focused work, to the point Dean didn’t notice the day passing as he worked on rebuilding.  It was not until he heard a cough from the door way that he had realised it had gone dark.
But then one lunch time, Mary had turned up to take Dean to the specialist.  Dean had noticed Gordon’s intrigue at what was going on, but had managed to divert it, making excuses that he may be too drowsy to drive afterwards. He could tell Gordon was suspicious but had taken Dean explanation at face value.  It might even had worked if Mary hadn’t spoken up, reminding Dean in front of Bobby and Gordon, that they would need to check if all this new responsibility wouldn’t aggravate Dean’s submissive status.
“Looking good there, Dean” Garth smiled at him when he returned into the breakroom.  Dean nodded, and went over to pour his coffee.  He raised the pot to Garth, silently offering the other man a coffee.
He jerks his head in an abrupt negative. “No. Not quite.” He swallows, tries to steel himself for the telling of it. “She… she got her scythe back. She’s dying. Didn’t have a lot of time left. But before she went, she wanted one last thing; to take me out. Ca… he… We couldn’t stop her. We didn’t know how. There was only one thing that could’ve gone up against her–”
. We didn’t see another living being… they’re all gone. Vanished. It’s just us.”
So, he can’t say it and he hates, hates Cas for a minute for speaking it aloud, for no longer sublimating it into banter and battle or bitter recriminations, which have always been just that little bit sharper, just that little bit meaner, because of what they’ve both kept to themselves.  And, really, Cas didn’t need to say it. It’s shining in his eyes, and it’s always been there hidden behind that miraculous blue.
He disconnects from those things as well, and slumps back down to the floor, ignoring the spike of pain that jolts each nerve as he collapses like a boneless, lifeless thing.
, can grow there anymore.
He stares at the wall, that mundane stack of empty brick, denial and rage clawing at his insides.  And he knows why he’s so broken, why this time goodbye feels so real.
“I… I don’t know,” Sam admits sounding helpless and frustrated and defeated and like a little boy who just wants his big brother to make things right.
“Dean!”
Dean just tried not to look for it, tried not to see it. There’s no mistaking it though. Not
Because,
“What do you –” Sam is about to ask, but something on Dean’s face must fill in the blanks for him.
Except – and maybe it makes Dean an asshole – but he doesn’t think Sam is as broken from it, could ever be.
Dean tries to stand, his knees ache and creak and pop, and there’s a pang in his chest that’s just as likely from Billy’s invisible hand squeezing, as it is his broken heart.
is different. This time, the things that have always carefully gone unsaid have been spoken, and what that means is that this time: this time it’s for
“The Empty,” Jack interrupts, looking both knowing and bereft at the same time.
Coming into his life and going out the same way. Never giving him a choice either way.
“Jesus, Cas. I got too many years of baggage, too many hang-ups… too much of my dad. I dunno, man. I dunno if we’d have ever got there?” He shrugs, helpless. “Maybe if we could’ve stopped running, coulda stopped fighting, could’ve stopped hating each other every other day. Could’ve waited until the world… the universe was ready to cooperate and maybe give us a break. But you know… Winchesters. Probably never would’ve happened.” His mouth twists, bitter and rueful.
Dean shrugs. “Yeah. Probably. I dunno.”
“I’m sorry,” Sam says, and he sounds like he means it and knows what it means. Dean knows he does. He’s experienced loss… maybe the same kind of loss... in the last dozen hours.
Pain, at least, is something he can feel. He’s numb to everything else.
Dean knows he’d be lying if he said that he’d have done it any different. As much as he wants to tell himself that if he were a little bit more prepared, or had an inkling that this time, this time Cas would unearth that purposefully buried, deepest of truths and bring it into the light, he’d do it different. Answer him, at least. Thank him? Tell him what?
Damn Cas for saying it.
No one else.
The words hit him like a fist; like a bullet. And, the pain that follows is ten times as sharp as either.
Dean realizes then that it’s not the words themselves, it’s the fact that Cas gave them voice. He’s known,
He places his hand over the bloody handprint, fingers lining up, feeling the material already stiffened, and flaking. Still, he presses there, what would be palm-to-palm. And in this lonely darkness, he lets himself have this one moment, this one thing.
, for us to just give up. Roll over. Let this happen. He stopped Death from taking me, so I gotta stop the world from ending.”
“It, uh… wasn’t just people from other worlds, or people who were brought back.”
“Wasn’t Billy, by the way,” he goes on to say.
“Dean, are you here?” And Jack.
“He’s gone, Sammy. Cas is…” but he can’t finish.
“Who else?”
Fuck.
The way that Sam’s face changes, Dean suddenly knows there’s even more bad news…  like he isn’t shouldering enough of it.
Sam’s calling, and he knows he should answer. He knows that unlike every other time the world has gone to hell, that this time is so much more. But he can’t bring himself to slide a finger across the surface to answer, or to swipe the call away.
Jack is the one who says, “Maybe we need to find Chuck. Once and for all.”
He wants to lie and say that it’s not fair that he didn’t get a chance to say it back. And it would be a lie. Yet, at the same time, it’s also a truth.
He’s flayed, raw, hurting like he did when he was in hell; before he felt that hand grip his shoulder.
His eyes are dry, gritty… aflame with that aching pressure that’s making his head throb.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean wants to scream.
“Dean” Sam says in the way that makes his name an entire sentence.
He curses Cas again, and again.
He can read the extent of it on Sam’s face then; sees what he’d been blind too through the haze of his own grief.
else, that could exist that might be able to fix this, to right this most grievous of wrongs.
It’ll never cross his lips again. And, there’s no one to bear witness (not the one person who should), but it needs to be said.
Whatever the world has left to throw at them; Chuck, Death, the Empty… it doesn’t matter now. If he can lose Cas… really lose him this time, then the only other things he has left that he loves; there’s no keeping them safe.
other time he’s been able to hold on to the smallest fragment of a kernel of promise, of potential. A dry, minuscule, desiccated seed that would take miraculous cultivation to even begin to sprout into hope. But now, the depths of him lie fallow, and nothing,
But he doesn’t want to see it or hear it now, either. Not this time.
There are another six missed calls on his phone, and he’s got texts and voicemails from both Sam and Jack, and when he’s finally got his thumb hovering over the call button, he hears noise outside the room.
Dean shakes his head and hefts his weary shoulders. “I dunno, Sammy. I just know that Cas didn’t sacrifice himself for us–” and he amends because he
The cold cement of the bunker wall seeps through Dean’s jacket and flannel and his face and his throat and his eyes burn from the rough, quiet sobs that he tried like hell to contain. Until they forced their way out, each one - each gasp and each tear – hurt, scalded.
