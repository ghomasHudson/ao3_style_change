Daddy and Mummy Molly must have discussed more than simply babysitting, though, because they were on the phone for a long time. And, when Daddy came back to let me out of my room, he wasn't seething anymore.
When it began to take effect Sherlock fussed at first, fighting the strange feeling of unnatural sleepiness after he had slept so much already. His movements became even more uncoordinated, and his whimpers desperate.
John gave another wide blink of disbelief and an incredulous-sounding exhale as he regarded Sherlock and the thing in his hand.
Sherlock's agitation increased with each passing second. As soon as the click of the rear buckle opening could be heard and the straps went slack, Mary helpfully reached over to unhook the simpler closures in the front and gently pushed the straps aside.
He knew he was tense, he knew he looked it, he knew John picked up on it. But he couldn't help himself. He added a shrug, hoping to make it seem like his heart wasn't ready to stop the moment John opened his mouth.
Much to John's relief Sherlock's pulse slowed to normal after a minute, but he was concerned that the baby was so overly excitable.
At the same time, Sherlock instinctively opened his mouth in response to Mary's touch. She quickly turned his head back toward her and tried again to help him latch on.
He was half afraid of turning and finding John staring straight back at him, a bit like he'd thrown the occasional glances at Sherlock during the anorexia film.
He imagined how wrong such a conversation might go. Snippets of an outraged John Watson, making large, emphatic gestures while he laid into Sherlock for being so utterly intolerable, played through Sherlock's head. The row played through in a multitude of variations, interspersed with the occasional unlikely show of sympathy.
John carried Sherlock over to her and tenderly laid him in her arms, then carefully took Sherlock's dummy away.
He stopped there for a moment and wondered if he shouldn't brush his hair first, splash some water on his face.
John injected air and a bit more lubricant into the cylinder through a valve at the top, easing the pressure so that he could, again slowly, press the plunger back down until Sherlock's navel popped free. When it did, it remained firmly clamped as a very pronounced outie.
He was sat on his bedroom carpet, engrossed with a colouring book, when the door to the flat opened and John's distinctive footfalls wafted to his ears. He stilled, listening to the reassuring, familiar sounds of John settling in.
Daddy and Mary knew Sherlock's body was marred, and their knowing made the entire room feel yucky, in a vaguely chilly and sticky sort of way that made Sherlock wonder if they might be mad or disappointed with him. He was aware of their concern over him, but was it good? Was it bad? Did they think his back had something to do with the bad drugs he took today? He felt as though he'd done something wrong, something he wasn't sure of but that he was being judged for.
Crayoning briskly and methodically, Sherlock felt his mind clicking into gear and meeting the same resistance as it had all week. He wholeheartedly wanted to go back to being a baby right that instant, so his 'aging up' only topped out at maybe a seven-year-old level for now.
Embarrassed at how the ache inside his bellybutton was slowly turning into pleasure, Sherlock began to suck his thumb as a distraction.
Don't kill me. I just write the stuff. For entertainment purposes only, pure fiction, never happened (to my knowledge), etc, etc.
Sherlock removed his nippie, set it down in its usual place on the nightstand, and found a hankie for his nose. Meanwhile, John straightened the perpetually rumpled covers on Sherlock's bed and turned the top edge down invitingly.
It seemed the success of the soup last night was so encouraging that John and Missus Hudson deliberately put it on the menu again today. Only, today it was far less acceptable. It was watery, sickly-sweet mulligatawny, and Sherlock wasn't at all in the mood to force it down. Somehow, the offence made something click in Sherlock's already worn-down subconscious, and he acted out without exactly meaning to.
It left him more or less on autopilot, his body cold and his thoughts detached from the rest of him. He stopped shivering, but his fingers and toes, unnoticed, began to turn slightly blue as his blood pressure dropped to conserve precious energy. In part, the cooling effect of the bathwater still evaporating out of his hair on an already chilly morning was also to blame.
"Fun? What, asking me to call a phone you can't pick up constitutes fun now? How does that even keep you entertained. Did you set it to a rude ringtone or something?"
John slid his hand up the tubing and did a double-check on its connection to the IV bag. The movement of his steady, sure surgeon's hand fingering the line looked so intimate, Sherlock unconsciously nibbled his lip and let out a breathy, desperate noise. John tutted down to him in response.
John rocked him and rubbed his back, and briefly snuck his hand up to Sherlock's forehead to check his temperature. In the space of time it took him to do that, Sherlock went entirely limp against him.
Sherlock's eyes were still red rimmed and achey despite his nap, a backup of tears unable to drain away while his eyes were shut. He scooted next to the bed, rested his shoulders on the side, and rested his eyes while he tried to calm down and not think about guessing what John was thinking.
Sherlock squinted guiltily up at Daddy when the doors were opened. He sat in the bottom of the wardrobe, his bare butt crushing some expensive-looking shoes.
"You're so jumpy today," John noted with worry. He rubbed the duckie flannel softly over Sherlock's chest and felt the baby's heart racing.
It was the middle of the day on a weekday, so John saw no one when he glanced around to make sure they were out of earshot.
This continued until even John could see Sherlock's mouth was getting dry. He set the half-eaten toast down and asked gently, "Can you take a sip of tea for me?"
He allowed himself the fleeting notion that he was having dinner with his Daddy, or at least with his very nice Uncle John who cared for him very much.
"I just did," John pointed out with a nervous puff of a laugh. He half-smiled down at the dish towel. "It's... kind of nice, actually. You usually put up such a fight when I try to help you with anything."
The tinkling started very soon, Benedict's overfull bladder spasming a couple times as he relieved himself in a loud, steady stream. When it was eventually over, Benedict peered up at Martin expectantly.
She smiled and then, since I hadn't slept much, she wrapped me up in my blanket for a kip and called me a caterpillar.
Irene herself had already refitted a few of the rooms for her own purposes; for when she entertained particularly kinky, particularly
He tried too to ignore the frequently nagging thought that it was unwise and unhealthy to keep imagining John as his caretaker. He ignored it because he knew all too well that if Daddy-John was what he conjured up when he was little, it was because that was what he needed, deep down, to see.
Talk amongst the grown-ups this week has been "poor, depressed Sherlock this" and "have you found any more illicit that". And, during the conversations they think I can't hear, Mycroft's been trying to convince John to allow an all-expenses-paid holiday at home. As far as I can tell, John's haggled Mycroft down to one week instead of two and still hasn't said yes. Mycroft needs to learn to stop asking and just hide the cash somewhere, then tell John, "Oh, by the way, it's in your coat pocket," or, "it was in today's mail and you can't send it back," along with probably, "the call's already been made, the clinic won't be expecting you until next Monday." I can't believe that hasn't occurred to him yet. He stopped asking with me ages ago.
Sherlock was quiet, trying to devise an excuse that would get him back out of the kitchen without any fuss from John. The last thing he needed was for John to watch him fumbling with the spoon like a two -year-old, never mind wearing his big yellow bib to catch the drips that sometimes happened when he ate regressed.
defrost during my naptime, and I even took the precaution of covering the plate with the fancy glass serving lid thing, but when I woke up and Daddy was going to help me make my sammich (John thinks it's cute when I pronounce it like that aloud), there were bazillions of new fruit flies inside the lid, crawling all over my bread.
2. Cold sausage straight from the fridge eaten right before multiple servings of fibre-rich Hobnobs makes/traps way too much gas and I get a really, really bad tummy ache for the rest of the day.
Benedict was standing with his eyes closed until they adjusted to the light, in just his nappy and a baggy, gray Weta tee shirt bearing an image of Smaug on the right breast, in the same style as the dragon appeared on Bilbo's map. He knuckled some of the sleep crust away from his tear ducts as he finally started blinking and squinting. Meanwhile, Martin stepped into his slippers and came around the bed to wrap an arm around Ben's waist and guide him over to the wall.
After a couple minutes, Sherlock still hadn't woken but his breathing remained steady. John lowered Sherlock's legs and quickly unzipped the pyjamas, stripping him down to his nappy.
"Good boy," Sherlock was thrilled to almost-hear when he was done and Daddy reached over to flush the potty for him.
"Baby needs to go wee-wee, hm?" the imaginary doppelganger of John whispered fondly into Sherlock's ear. Sherlock pretended this John was real.
"Oh," Sherlock breathed when he realised what it meant. He bent down, picked up his dressing gown, and went on tiptoes to hang it onto the hook on the back of the door so it would stay relatively clean and he could wear it again after his bath.
In fact, Daddy was surprisingly tender with me for the rest of the day, so I can't complain. He didn't even try to make me eat a meal, and let me get away with just crackers and tea.
He returned with a pacifier that was, like the baby seat, sized up to accommodate the fact that, no matter how infantile Sherlock's mindset currently was, physically he wasn't all that little.
And his father, same as ever, didn't pay much mind to the boys. He never had been much enthused about the idea of having children of his own. Not that he wasn't proud of Mycroft's career, but, then, the entire family fawned over that.
Turning serious again, Mary pointed out, "I think you're right about him sleeping a lot. He probably will. He was trying to sedate himself to never wake up again, wasn't he."
He sighed, "Yes, Sherlock. You were a good boy for not killing the poor toads, but you still scared them a bit."
Daddy rolled his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. At least that was over. He kissed Sherlock on the boy's perspiring forehead and pulled up the side of the cot, locking it shut. He then wound up a music box he'd brought from home and let it play while he set about cleaning up the things they'd used.
"Thanks, sorry about that." John explained as Mary gingerly took the clothing from him, "I'm going to give the crack baby a bath now. It's his own fault he won't get breakfast for another twenty minutes."
John heaved a grim-sounding sigh. "Yeah, that's about it. Last time, he stayed this way until the drugs were out of his system. All through detox, and then most of the day after it was over. About four days straight."
Coming 'round to where he could face John, a pouting - quite nearly crying - Sherlock fidgeted nervously and moaned again, "Mmmmbee?"
Frowning upon feeling tears filling his already tired eyes, Sherlock found himself admitting, "Doesn't feel like I deserve it." He bashed his cheek frustratedly into one knee and hugged his legs tighter.
John watched him try to reach for his chest again. The consternated look on Sherlock's face when he discovered how limited his range of movement was turned out to be John's only warning before Sherlock began to full out strop, keening and drumming his feet into the mattress. Baby pulled frantically at the cuffs, but to no avail. Everything holding him was solid.
John went and hovered by Sherlock's chair, where, predictably, the detective stayed firmly planted and engrossed in the microscope.
It felt... not exactly wrong, to have someone comfort him, but too good to be true.  Too good to last. This was a dream he would wake up from any moment now. Sherlock's shoulders shook harder. Finally he hyperventilated himself into a semi-numb semblance of calmness and quieted down.
He took his time leisurely and watched Sherlock skip all the way to the sunny swinging spot. Sometimes Sherlock began swinging without him, but this time Sherlock sat bouncing his bum in the plastic blue swing until John arrived and gave him a few good, strong pushes.
Washing out the sippy cup and placing it to dry beside his RAMC mug, John smiled a little smile, thinking how adorable it was that Baby Sherlock was so keen to do everything his Daddy did.
Little Sherlock was startled awake by the sound of the tapes on his diaper being peeled off, then a draught licked him between the legs as Daddy opened the diaper.
John felt his heart twist at the request, and the only possible answer was, "Sure you can, Sherlock. Absolutely, if it helps you. That... even sounds kind of nice." He further checked, "Is that a yes?"
Daddy and I have come to an agreement that I'm allowed to skip tea on most days so long as I've had breakfast and lunch, but I hadn't eaten much of lunch that day.
So the above is what a partially regressed blog entry looks like. I'm not sure it has much merit, but I'll post it anyway and see what sort of reaction it garners.
Due to... reasons... it has been surmised that a certain someone is probably prone to holding in his wee a lot longer than is healthy.
Sherlock hadn't shivered at all since John had tucked a second blanket over him and set the incubating cover atop his cot. It would all have to come off again in a few minutes, once Sherlock's treatment began, but for the moment John wanted him to be toasty warm and comfortable.
"He's up," he sighed to Mary and hefted himself out of his cosy seat to go deal with the toddling terror.
"Uck," Sherlock made a deliberate near-choking sound and drew a slimy, half-chewed inch of celery out of his mouth. He dropped it with a show of utmost distaste directly on the kitchen table, not bothering to use his sandwich plate.
taken the liberty of locking Sherlock's hands into soft, pink scratch mitts when the Little detective repeatedly refused to stop rubbing at his itchy eyes.
Recoiling from the acrid wetness in his mouth, over his chin, and down his front, Sherlock sobbed a bit more, unable to help himself.
John tried, "I saw some old boo-boos on your back. Do they still hurt at all? You don't need to stay in the booster if it's hurting you."
John said it's a cheap gift, (as if that's supposed to make me feel bad about it,) but if someone's going to bother with gifts it stands to reason they should be useful. Besides, Gormund was the one who specifically said he could use a VCR. He'll be getting exactly what he wants, and I'll have more space in my bookshelves with it gone.
John knew. They had yet to discuss it. The bedroom was still littered with toys and baby things Sherlock did not bother to put away before dinner. John saw them, stepped around them when he helped Sherlock get ready for bed. There could be no denying it now, no clever back-pedalling.
He tapped his mobile's disconnect button and turned around to peer at the door to Sherlock's room, where he'd shut the unwashed, still residually drugged detective to wait for him and think about what he'd done.
John's voice grew a little warmer, more placating than insistent, "It's dinner time, Sherlock. Are you coming out? You've been hiding out in there all day."
"Sherlock, no!" Luckily, John was close - and quick - enough to catch him before any of it could spill over the seat.
Maybe part of why I was fussy last night was because the spiders have started to find their way indoors again. John and I went all summer and autumn without seeing a single one indoors, but then yesterday I saw an enormous one in the front hall and found another inside our flat. I'm not fond of arachnids. Having to dispose of the second one on my own may have been what tipped my mental balance into being Little and agitated for the rest of the evening. Normally, Daddy takes care of the spiders or other crawlies, unless they're work-related.
It was worth how sweet Sherlock acted for the rest of the morning, and the little guy even went down for his nap early, no fuss, thanks to a minor caffeine-and-sugar crash.
talk about this tomorrow, Sherlock, if you still want to." John promised with a pensively terse but warm smile, "I do not think
John tried to check, "Are you a very little baby right now? Am I going to have to put you in nappies?"
Sherlock hesitated. He couldn't decide if crawling to his seat would be overkill at this point. It was what he wanted, though. And then he wanted John to notice how he couldn't stand on his own, and to lift Sherlock into the chair and maybe even find a strap with a buckle to make sure he didn't fall out. It would be very nice to have his own highchair. Perhaps it could be built using a barstool, to give some extra lift for his long legs...
Finally, the doctor gave one loud clap and said with a little extra volume, "Come to the table and eat, Sherlock."
In other news, Mrs. Hudson encountered one of my footed sleepers in the wash by mistake, and now she won't shut up about it. She's threatened to cut off the heating to our flat just to see me wear it.
When they got Sherlock home to Baker Street, the first thing they did was launch into the much-needed discussion that hadn't felt right to have in front of the driver. They set a shaky Sherlock down on the sofa, just to watch him dazedly slide himself down to the floor a minute later.
To his credit, he at least sat down with John and had a taste before he started to give the doctor trouble.
It was a trifle awkward at first to let myself fall into my Little mindset around Molly, just as it was at first with John, but I think she and I are both more comfortable with it now. The turning point for both of us might have been when she caught a cold on our final morning at the hotel.
Without turning to face John, he angled his head back in his direction just enough to ask, calmly and openly, "So what are you going to do about it?"
John just made a rude joke about other things clenching before he retreated to his chair, referencing an instance of spontaneously farting the seventh through twelfth notes of the first bar in Peter's Theme from
He heard John putting things away and shutting off lamps out in the living room before coming back to the bedroom with a tepid glass of distilled water from one of the jugs Sherlock kept below the sink. John knew Sherlock would refuse tap water. Theirs tasted chalky.
Sherlock grunted in the affirmative and took it, a happier sort of peacefulness settling over him again as he lied back and suckled. His stomach rumbled, his breakfast finally starting to digest, and John indulgently tugged the blankets down just far enough that he could rub Sherlock's tummy. Sherlock's eyes closed as he relaxed.
Mary stepped out of view, and a few moments later the quiet strains of Brahms' Lullaby filled the ward room.
"Well, no." John sat back, wracking his brains for the identity of his mysterious closeted infantilist acquaintance. He grilled Sherlock, "Is it someone I work with?"
He manhandled Sherlock back into the warm baby clothing, then grabbed a pillow off the bed to tuck between Sherlock's head and the hard flooring.
John picked his way up at an easy pace, aiming for the well-trodden, dirt-packed steps contained by the worn arcs of old, strong tree roots peeking out from the eroded slope.
All of a sudden, Mary paled. She pointed past John, towards Sherlock, and gasped, "John, what's he doing?"
Warning for more toilet talk/allusions in this chapter. I really didn't plan it this way, I swear. Xb
Dropping his hand, John said in one big whoosh, "I've been really worried about you, you know? Weeks ago already, it's like you just
Sherlock had been out long enough to completely fill the nappy in his sleep. He wasn't sure how he felt about not being able to remember releasing his bladder at all, but then Daddy took his mind off that with a very thorough changing. Sherlock cringed at the chill at first, but Daddy's hands were nice and warm; and someone had even pre-warmed the wipes.
After the tub was full and the tap shut off, John's imaginary hand twisted the faucets as if Sherlock hadn't already done it himself.
"Alright, Daddy's here," John eased the lanky boy out of the dark wardrobe and gathered him up in his lap on the floor.
John sighed. "Yes. I can tell you need to go. Come on. Whatever it is you're looking at will wait for you."
Daddy's spending more time with me lately now that he and half of London have it in their heads that I'm a drug risk 'again,' but not everything has gone smoothly.
Digging in his gown pocket for the lighter, Sherlock spat, "Your visual memory assessment of what it
A few hours later, Sherlock's skin felt more of a normal temperature. Almost a bit cool around his feet, even, which was certainly an improvement. Whether it was due to getting rest or the smelly, garden-grown antibiotics, Sherlock's fever had broken. John spread the bunny blanket over Sherlock up to the waist.
It was a sharp sort of burn as the needle sank in, bypassing the protective barrier of Sherlock's skin and entering the closest vein to the surface with perfect aim. It penetrated what felt like the exact centre of Sherlock's bellybutton knot.
John carefully sat down in his armchair with his morning coffee, keeping an eye on Sherlock to be sure the little one kept his distance from the hot drink.
"That's got to stay in for a few minutes," Daddy replied, rubbing Sherlock's thigh with one hand and keeping the thermometer firmly seated with the other.
"Hey, look," John pointed ahead of them a second later, "I can see the road up there. We're not far from the swings now."
Just one more chapter to this instalment, I think.  It may be a long time coming, as usual, since I'm still facing the tech issues, and now a lot of family stuff and long-term stress-related health issues to boot.
Like last time, I apologise if the narrative isn't up to par with the first three chapters. This entire chapter was hammered out in one solid blast session (just last night) and only edited briefly. I shall blame any and all typos on the booze, for it was involved.
This. Sherlock regressed into Little headspace because he was feeling yucky, and John deciding that Irene's clinic, being so well supplied now, was better accommodation than 221B when it came to caring for an ill, Little Sherlock.
Sherlock latched on and suckled with a small smile on his lips the entire time he drank. It felt so nice to be held by Daddy at the end of a long walk. He felt a bit sweaty, but knew that Daddy would take care of that when they were home. It would be Daddy's decision whether he bathed Sherlock before of after his nap, probably depending on how tired he thought Sherlock appeared.
John gently applied a fresh damp cloth to Sherlock's forehead, whispering to him, "There you are, sweetheart."
John set the empty bottle on the coffee table and petted Sherlock's hair, proudly whispering, "Good boy... There's my sweet little boy."
It struck Sherlock that he'd already taken that leap. If he didn't already subconsciously trust John with this, last night would not have happened. He would have to remember to keep reminding himself of that in future, until he felt secure enough not to worry over it.
I did get good-boy points for remembering to drink something today; I went nearly three days without water back in June, and it was not a fun experience. I don't think Daddy's entirely convinced that wasn't on purpose, but I honestly did just forget to drink anything since I wasn't eating anyway.
"Beeeeeee," Sherlock answered sadly, under his breath, unfurling the wrinkled bundle he'd had clutched to his chest.
"NOOO!" Sherlock hollered. He kicked at the floor for emphasis, smacking his thigh into John's armpit and nearly dislodging him.
- Lastly, in the course of ensuring Mycroft wouldn't be persuaded to hack the image file in case John asked, I may have flung some insults which Daddy overheard. Included use of the word 'penises' quite loudly. I'm sure the looks on both our faces were amusing for whomever was monitoring the camera feeds that day. I love my Daddy because he is above such crude punishments as washing my mouth with soap. Though the five-day ban on telly isn't great either.
Sherlock, smelling what it was, reached up with both hands to receive the mug, excitedly demanding, "Ah'fee!"
Waking up to yet another morning of the previous night's crying-induced congestion was the least of Sherlock's concerns.
John's eyebrows shot up. Sherlock still sounded Little, but had been so deep into headspace up until a moment ago that he'd been incapable of using his words. He must
"Go to the bathroom and brush your teeth. I'm going to get you one more glass of water, and after you drink it you're going to sleep. Go on, get ready for bed."
in his nappy. He always knew enough to scoot himself over to the bathroom door so John would have a cue when the baby needed to be helped onto the toilet.
John nodded in understanding and coaxed her out of the flat with a few more gentle words. He had noticed Sherlock's mannerisms changing slightly as the holiday trimmings went up and realised the detective was involuntarily slipping into Little headspace. It remained to be seen whether Sherlock was slipping into Toddler Mode or would mentally regress all the way to his tiny baby state.
"Um..." Sherlock looked down at himself. He wrapped his arms across his naked chest and said under his breath, "Oh."
The password I changed to wasn't even that difficult. It was Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Seriously; piece of cake as long as one spells it correctly.
Very groggy, he struggled not to slip right under again. He could not muster the strength yet to open his eyes, and only perceived the general brightness of the room, the chilly air around his face smelling faintly of antiseptic and lavender, and soft voices barely on the edge of his hearing.
I left the hiding place I mentioned previously at a later time than I intended to, due to the necessity of a long nap, and John spotted me on the street on his way home from work. Despite neither of us being impaired as far as walking went, he forced me to get into a cab for the end of the trip back to Baker Street.
He took his pacifier and wiggled under the blankets. He snuggled up to Hippie, a well-worn terrycloth bunny that was as old as he was (and so named because, being a bunny, he hippy-hopped). Now that he was full grown, Hippie was only a tiny bit bigger than his hand. He held it to his chest and focussed on trying to relax. When he was ready to turn onto his stomach and sleep, he would set his nippy-nip and the fragile stuffed bunny on the nightstand.
John beckoned him to follow back up the path again. "We've got to get going too, Sherlock. You still want to play on the swings, right?"
John, encouraged that Sherlock at least hasn't dumped it out in the sink already, sipped at his own and tried to coax him, "You can pick it out, that's fine."
Sherlock grunted and sleepily brushed the back of his hand over his face. Daddy knew he was resisting the urge to suck.
Still drowsy, Sherlock only managed to watch some of the goings-on from beneath his heavy eyelids. He was awake enough now to feel anything done to him, but not with-it enough to protest as Dr. Watson's hand went straight for his diaper first thing, feeling around and crinkling the material to check if Sherlock had urinated. He hadn't.
On an equally happy note, neither Mycroft nor Mummy has called recently. Last I heard, Mycroft agreed to visit our parents for Christmas. Ergo, I am most definitely not doing the same.
"No!" John warned, catching his baby boy's hip as the little rascal tried to roll out of the soggy, opened nappy, "You're still wet, don't mess up the sheets."
Speaking of videos, Lestrade is getting my parents' old VCR for Christmas so his family videocassettes won't be obsolete. My father keeps all his electronics in perfect condition, so the VCR still works like new. I don't use it anyway, and I've had it for nigh on eight years.
Even though there was something of a speech attempted, it was easy to tell the overperspirating orator had been hard-pressed to find enough flattering things to say about me to fill the entire four and a half minutes. Good thing he had his cuecards with him, or the speech might have stretched past the five minute mark on account of all the 'hms' and 'ums'.
The doctor quickly masked his surprise and said carefully, "Not unless you promise to let me in there with the vacuum cleaner tomorrow. Missus Hudson would be horrified by how long you've let it go." The ending punctuation was his cup being set on the table.
John smirked wryly at his hands. "No... No, Sherlock, I know that's just the way you are. Your pride, or whatever; you have a hard time accepting help, don't you."
She stroked his shoulder through the blanket and fleecy sleeper while he snuffled and swallowed, eventually successfully starting to drink from her.
Sherlock flopped onto his side atop his bed, arms crossed, in a blatant pout. A familiar whirling coil of loneliness and grief welled inside him, making his eyes itch and his chest tighten. For no logical reason, he felt as though John had abandoned him; as though, as Sherlock's father, had stormed off in anger and left him horribly alone as punishment for simply wanting to be closer.
Since Mycroft caught wind of their playtime, he'd been generously eager to supply discreet transportation to Little Sherlock's favourite haunts. On his own, John would never have thought to buy a car when work and the pubs were so close to Baker Street. The car stayed with Mycroft, or with whomever the driver was that worked for Mycroft, but a simple text from John's phone could have it waiting at the door within twenty minutes on any day of his and Sherlock's choosing.
And yet, when Sherlock was Little, it was as if a pinhole of light promised there was a way to reach the surface. But someone had to be waiting up there to meet him, or the journey was futile. He needed John.
By the refrigerator rules set down by John and Mrs. Hudson, all the Petri dishes stored in there needed their lids on, but a 'covered' one meant the experiment required a completely airtight seal for storage, so cling film would additionally go under the lid.
In a congested, depleted daze, Sherlock didn't have the will to argue. He did as he was told, then returned to his room and stripped off his gown and flannels. He slid into bed and covered himself quickly for decency's sake.
John all but flung the scalding hot toast onto the plates, and Sherlock shut the pantry without bothering to find the juice, figuring the tea John made was still hot and would suffice.
A moment later, Sherlock's hand also went to the back of his neck. His long fingers toyed with his curls, another sign of anxiety that tended to be more prevalent when he was Little. He glowered down at the toilet while his fingers twisted absently.
The needle fully seated, it had almost completely disappeared into the depths of Sherlock's fleshy innie. The IV line trailed out of his gut like a long, synthetic umbilical cord, feeding the glucose serum directly into his intestines via the adjacent vein.
Sherlock's robe and underwear were quickly a wrinkled pile on the floor. Pretend-John raised a condescending eyebrow at his little one, though, which stopped Sherlock from stepping into the tub.
Sherlock kicked his feet a bit under the table, his littleness going warm and fuzzy at John's concern over him.
"Let's hope that headache is gone when the morning comes," Mary quipped and took a sip of the tea Mrs. Hudson had given her.
He procrastinated long enough to take Sherlock's pulse, to reassure himself, then stood and strode purposefully down the hall.
Later, it was time to re-check Sherlock's vitals. He let out a great, big yawn as he was manoeuvred in Mary's lap.
With that she disappeared, making sure to close the door firmly behind her to keep the noise from travelling too much.
He snorted at the word 'stash'. Sometimes, he got a kick imagining the look on Lestrade's face if he perhaps told him one day that he'd dropped the cocaine for diapers.
In short, love was superfluous - and dangerous - and he knew it. Which was why he still had such difficulty justifying his want for it after all this time. And wanting it from his unsuspecting flatmate, no less.
Sherlock continued to sob pitifully, drumming his feet on the floor to make sure the grown-ups knew he was still cranky and wanted out of the seat. John and Mary stared as Sherlock finally resorted to stuffing his fingers in his mouth. That, at least, helped him quiet down a bit.
Sherlock had picked out the knee-highs instead of the mid-calf version, because they had more bees and more honeycombs on them.
John saw Sherlock consider it before the fussy beanpole huffed disgustedly, shoved the chair backward with a rude scrape that was sure to scuff the floor, and started to head for the sofa.
It was, almost, a bit like Daddy signalling to Sherlock that he was about to send him to bed for his own good.
"Okay," Sherlock finally said, letting John know in that one word that he still wasn't thrilled about it.
Sherlock wasn't Big, though, so instead he cowered from John's pensive frown. He also made one last involuntary tinkle into the toilet bowl, startling himself. John's hand shot out to steady him when he jumped.
flies, fifteen of which I kept, plus I smooshed the spider that waltzed into the flat tailing the flies. Oh, and then there was one more fruit fly after Daddy took the photo.
A dumb grin spread on Sherlock's face at the thought of Daddy being home with him. Even from a different room, Sherlock felt John's relaxed presence like a warm blanket. He could picture John seated at one end of the sofa, elbow on the armrest and leaning the side of his head on the palm of his fist while he watched telly, and wearing that bare hint of a smile that sometimes crept up on him when he got really into it.
Despite the tension, Sherlock's flight response didn't kick in until that documentary ended and the voiceover on the rolling credits announced the final documentary of the night would be what sounded an awful lot to Sherlock like something to do with either infantilism similar to his or the worst real parenting imaginable. The latter possibility sounded far too tabloid, leaving the former as more likely, however unlikely overall.
Thankfully, John found no such mark. Still instinctively suspicious, but now feeling a bit sheepish for his paranoia, he silently vowed to keep a closer eye on both Mary and Sherlock, for the latter's sake.
Tomorrow I'll probably take a walk in the morning, a sort of routine check-in with a few of my contacts, and then have a Busytown marathon so I stay out of trouble until John gets home. (The 1990s episodes, obviously; the remade series is absurdly dumbed down. Awful.)
That spurred John to his bedside, whispering in an effort to get Sherlock to match his volume, "Okay, okay. Good morning, baby. Let Daddy check your nappy, and then we'll get your breakfast, yeah?"
jokes. It's funny how mass texting to a group of drunk and/or hung-over individuals can bring light to the darkest recesses of their senses of humour. Some things were meant to remain hidden.
She woke with a headache that morning and told me it was especially throbbing near one of her eyes, so I did what Little-me felt was the natural thing to do, which was to wave my hands around the bed to chase away the ouchies so the ouchies would leave Mummy's head and eyeballs alone. Then Mummy said her cold wasn't that bad, that it was probably just an idiot allergy. So I checked under the bed, since that was the only dark place for an idiot to fit if they wanted to hide in our hotel room, but the mattress was on a solid-bottomed frame with no underneath space. As I told Mummy, there were no Anderson bunnies (the assumed derivative of dust bunnies) beneath the bed.
The two snuggled up to each other and lied together silently. As the time stretched whilst they waited for the night to reclaim them in sleep, a few occasional growls and grumbles could be heard from Benedict's gut settling.
Eventually it decided it was safe enough to creep around the stump a ways. Sherlock cautiously followed it until it edged itself under a broad, green, fallen tulip tree leaf and disappeared from view.
"Sure." Wisely, John refrained from mentioning that he would be trying to put Sherlock down for a nap first thing when they got home. If all went according to plan, Sherlock would go down easily after their hike of what must have been five miles, and he would get his story when he woke up.
Daddy made me throw out an entire Petri dish today because it moulded. I admit I wasn't intending for that particular one to mould. Daddy also wasn't happy to find out I haven't eaten since early yesterday morning, so we're getting takeaway tomorrow, probably Chinese, since Daddy says I put up the least fuss with takeaway food when I'm big and we haven't got any baby food in at the moment. Getting me into Little headspace at mealtime is John's 'secret weapon', but he can't use it if there's no food around. Hence my refusal to do the shopping for him during weeks like this.
John sighed to his laptop as Sherlock reached their landing. It was just typical of Sherlock to use Little-space as a manipulation to excuse himself from having to perform basic chores.
"And what are you up to today?" John asked without looking up from the news reports on his laptop while Sherlock, in dressing gown and pyjamas, made his slow, meandering way to the sofa.
John was left to hold his chin in his hand and drum his fingers on the table and wonder why the hell he even bothered.
John's. My laptop died last week, and John's been stingy about sharing his. Last night, he insisted he needed it so he could look up something he hadn't gotten around to searching for at work. I'm getting a new computer soon, but not soon enough.
(Sherlock had tried once, with heavy-duty packaging tape, and John had needed scissors to get him out.)
John sighed that familiar, frustrated sigh of his. "Sherlock, biscuits aren't dinner. Missus Hudson was out today and brought us back a carton of that squash soup she says you like. There's some honey ham, too. Come on out."
"Just tired?" John guessed. He figured if it was real pain, Sherlock would have nodded 'yes' to prompt John to guess exactly where he hurt.
Sherlock frowned as it struck him that John was indeed gentler with him recently. He hadn't yelled more than once in the past week, and his sarcasm was at an all-time low. He'd been particularly patient with Sherlock, the birdseed incident aside - but even then John took the route of least resistance. Ordinarily the argument would have gone on until Sherlock huffed off in a snit, not John, which meant, seeing as how Sherlock could hold out an awfully long time before huffing off, John knew he was doing both of them a favour by cracking first. Ergo, despite the inconvenience, John felt generous that day.
"Here, can you finish your bottle for me? When you're finished we can have a cuddle," he bribed, feeling more and more self-conscious in front of Mary.
I put extra sweetener in today's coffee and then went to sit in John's armchair to wait for the inevitable, but Daddy caught on to what I was trying to do and made me sit on the toilet until it happened. Only took ten minutes or so, but still... the principal of the thing... not bloody fair.
Missus Hudson had obviously not mentioned to John that the squash soup Sherlock enjoyed was the homemade sort. Sherlock recoiled just a bit from the heavily seasoned steam rising in front of him from the dish.
The blanket became heavier, warmer over him, and then, after the sound of something rigid and possibly plastic settling into place overhead, the voices were muffled.
I completely forgot to link this fic up to its recent companion work, "Extended Scenes from Sherlock's Little Blog". That's done now, so you can find it linked at the bottom here as the next story in the 'series', or listed among my other fics.
Sherlock tucked the clean spoon in his fingers alongside the rim of the bowl, preparing to stand and leave with it. He hesitated, part of him wanting to stay and sit with John.
He drifted in this simplest state of being, knowing Daddy was near and everything was right with the world. Time did not matter. He stopped sensing it. He lay sprawled there for aeons.
The baby cried hard and painfully, his throat becoming sore from stifling all the sobbing that he couldn't let John hear. What would have been heart-rending wails were no more than a hoarse stream of air escaping the grimace with which Sherlock was fixed. He mastered silent crying decades ago; it was automatic now. Even his little side, so much freer with emotion once he acknowledged its existence, was that methodically repressed.
He only spat up a tiny bit when she finally got a burp out of him. She quickly wiped his chin before he could drool into the swaddling blankie.
"Oh, God," John muttered helplessly when he saw Sherlock's shoulders shake. Without stopping to think, he wrapped himself around the shuddering ball of detective in front of him, just hugging and letting Sherlock cry. If it worked the night before, hopefully it would work now. He couldn't help wondering, in an unobtrusive whisper, "Is it really this difficult for you?"
Sherlock moaned happily around his dummy. It turned into a mew of surprise when the doctor turned Sherlock's head gently and slid the plastic-sheathed probe of a tympanic thermometer into Sherlock's ear.
John hadn't really found out about it until they'd started with the age-play, so he wasn't entirely sure it wasn't simply a defiant act stemming from Sherlock's regressed side.
John managed to herd Sherlock to the kitchen for lunch to make good on his promise the evening before, which Sherlock deeply regretted.
"Yes, 'Oh'," John mimicked as he took a sullen, unresisting Sherlock by the arm and led him down the hall. "And what happened to the alarm you were supposed to set on your phone?"
Mary calmed him down again and cuddled him for a time, making sure to give him occasional brief, reassuring massages through the swaddling. Safe physical contact, extremely important for early infant development, was an integral part of Sherlock's care right now; without it, his ability to trust and accept care from others later in life might become compromised.
The rubbery squirty toy squeaked shrilly as Sherlock chewed on it all through his hair being rinsed. He may not have been mentally 'all there' for the moment, but, as John predicted, he was definitely in his Little 'sweet space'.
"It's okay, shh..." Experimentally, John rubbed the back of Sherlock's neck, trying to soothe him. He spoke into Sherlock's ear, hoping his gentle tone would calm Sherlock down. "So you told me last night you like to regress, and you say it's easier to accept my help when you're like this. Do you want my help in the future?"
Unbeknownst to the bewildered baby, the eyedrops weren't anything special; just standard lubricating drops to help combat the dry winter air the building's heating system was recirculating.
Finally, the heavy trickle died away. The dominant sounds in the cramped bathroom were of both men catching their breath and of Sherlock's ragged, unsuccessfully stifled crying.
John trained his ears on the other end of the hall for a minute to make sure Sherlock wasn't acting up, then turned back to the sitting room window and tapped through his contacts list until he found Molly Hooper's number.
Daddy put the stick back down on an instrument tray and dipped two gloved fingers into the open pot of lubricating jelly beside it. Then Daddy pulled Sherlock's legs wider apart, reached between, and ran his fingers around Sherlock's hole. Daddy smeared the cold gel around, and then inside.
"You did what, now?" John asked with trepidation, walking in and examining the window. It looked suspiciously fine, untouched.
I told Daddy that if one of the decaf options was toothpaste that tasted like wonton soup and tempura chicken, we wouldn't need to spend so much on takeaway food.
Mary helped John wheel the cot closer to the adjustable lamp standing among the other equipment. Turning the powerful lamp on offered another source of heat for the chilly man-infant lying helplessly on the thin hospital mattress.
John gave him the bottle next, musing to himself it was a good thing he'd already planned to give Sherlock gripe water; it would prevent gassiness later on as Sherlock's gut was reintroduced to semisolids after days of nothing but tea and peripheral nicotine.
"Nail beds slightly blue," John observed, picking up one of Sherlock's clammy hands and gently rubbing his thumb over the pale fingers. "Let's get him on oxygen."
He found he was dreading trying to deal with her right now. He almost wanted to barricade himself in the bedroom with Sherlock and... well, never leaving the room ever again was a bit extreme.
John noticed the change, and, as he set the mug down, the words, "Good boy," just sort of slipped out.
He listened silently to Baby's heartbeat, then lungs. It was futile to ask Sherlock to take deep breaths or cough for the stethoscope, as he was too 'small' right now to follow directions.
placed at the back of the pantry, even after I explained. Daddy says that if I want to restart that experiment, I have to do it outdoors. Unfortunately, insect-proofing a container to put outside would restrict airflow, and that'll skew the results. I'm not sure yet whether I want to bother doing it.
That's also apparently why John felt the need to divulge to Molly that he'd discovered the secret of enjoyably occupying the same personal space with me, and was ever so happy to share. I'm slowly forgiving him for that; not quite all the way there yet.
Reminder to self: we're out of bubble bath. Need to remind John to pick some up. Should perhaps emphasise that it could help remove the last of the turmeric stains from the bathtub.
It was one of Sherlock's more unusual bodily quirks, and it was difficult for John not to laugh every time it happened. John bit his lip to keep quiet, lest he wake the sleeping baby far too soon.
Lestrade or anyone thinking they can hack a copy of you-know-what, you're only getting a censored version. The uncensored original is backed up somewhere your best computer forensics tech would never reach it if they had all of the next century to try. You're welcome. Remember: what is seen cannot be unseen. I'm doing you a distinct favour. Can't have you weeping with envy next time John accompanies me to a crime scene, now, can we.
Feeling a rare case of tears coming on - well, not so very rare if Sherlock was honest with himself - he whisked off to his own bedroom down the creaky, lonely hall.
Sherlock keened, feeling the pain all the more acutely thanks to the effects of the recently removed clamp. Mary diligently held him still, pressing him into the mattress when he tried to arc his back.
Sherlock hesitated and made an aborted motion that looked like he wanted to shake his head in refusal. The final sign that John would have to take full control was Sherlock's other hand raising to his face, and Sherlock's thumb slipping into his mouth.
careful and didn't spill any; the droplet on the tabletop is where one of the flies landed when I scraped it off my hand, so that was intentional.
Written just last night, and I broke out the booze toward the end, so my hearty apologies if it's lacking. Completely unedited, un-spellchecked, un-beta-read, etc. Hot off the press, finished shortly after five a.m. (Edit: typos fixed. I found a few spots where my missing H key became problematic.)
John tugged at Sherlock's chin one more time. "It's to help you feel better," he said. "So you won't be sick tomorrow too. Come on. One good swallow, and it'll be over."
"Could be," John agreed, peering at Sherlock's eyes and mentally taking note of the pupil dilation. "With everything he took, if he doesn't have the mother of all headaches right now, he will by tomorrow morning. And I can't give him any of the painkillers we've got here, after all that. Missus Hudson might hear more screaming later. His reactions when he's Little can be kind of involuntary."
Daddy just added that I shouldn't pinch his laptop in the middle of the night to type, but I told him I needed a distraction from my tummy ache... Daddy says if I give myself another tummy ache this way, he's going to keep the biscuits locked away from me, even when I'm big! D:
John took note of it and tactfully went straight for the remote control, letting the box fill the awkward void.
After couple slow, soothing minutes of Brahms, without warning John removed the IV from Sherlock's tummy.
Warning: It was unplanned for, but there's potty talk in this chapter. It came as a surprise to everyone involved. Tags have been added.
In a deliberately cheerful voice, John, getting up onto his knees in front of Sherlock, said, "Okay, you know what I want now? A cuddle with my baby! Come here, love. That's it."
"I don't know," Sherlock mumbled. He half-lied, "I didn't watch anything, just checked to see what was on an old video."
Daddy was wearing a white coat, too, which frightened Little Sherlock just a bit. But it was still Daddy, so Sherlock wasn't
Sherlock held the plastic boat down, then let go and exclaimed as it popped back out of the water. He did it a few more times, trying to see how far in the air it could propel itself. It flew all the way to his feet at the end of the tub, the landing sending tufts of bubbles upward. Sherlock gasped and grinned, and blew at them as they floated back down. He slapped at the mounds of bubbles around him, delighting in their light and airy squishiness.
Some might take that as a challenge, but I predict in John's case he'll feel guilty, now that I've found out, and not want to bother with that trick again. We shall see.
John was back to petting Sherlock's hair when the cleanup was over. His little boy looked so exhausted. Sherlock wasn't even trying to escape the booster anymore.
Instead, he pulled out the half-empty jug of milk, nearly room temperature. Sharing a bemused look with John, Sherlock opened the fridge to put the jug in its proper place, from which he wound up pulling a chilled box of cereal.
Petting Sherlock's hair to keep him calm, John held the thermometer in place until the LCD screen on the handle flashed. He let go of Sherlock and read the temperature display. The tiny detective's body appeared to finally be maintaining a normal, constant temperature all on its own.
Sherlock's fingers curled around John's in a weak but consistent fist. John received the same reaction from Sherlock's other hand as well.
Sherlock returned wearing clean underwear, sweatpants, and his dressing gown, looking no different from last night. Before anyone could say anything, Sherlock headed for the pantry cupboard to look for a bottle of juice he remembered seeing a couple of weeks ago.
Sherlock was back in the booster seat, which had been adjusted so that it cradled him in a reclined position, and he was wearing an extremely childlike ensemble of baby blue tee shirt with a yellow terrycloth bib over it, exposed diaper, and pastel pink anklet socks. John sat beside the booster holding a baby bottle to Sherlock's lips, feeding him cool water.
1. Multiple servings of Hobnobs are not a good meal substitute, especially not when eaten in the space of only one hour.
Sorry for not replying to comments yet. Still strapped for time! Thanks to everyone reading/reviewing!
Benedict, his back turned to Martin, was jiggling one of his legs, rapidly tapping his foot over and over and over and over on the mattress.
It was meant to be a very tiny loft hidden behind the Lie of Leinster Gardens, secretly built atop the façade’s strong support struts to look outwardly no more than an elevated temporary work shed, but that plan was scrapped. Sherlock had bigger plans, and such a small place wouldn't satisfy. Not when he had other bolt-holes to choose from that he could more easily transform.
Turns out the box of her ill-labelled 'natural herbs' really read in full, in the smaller font, 'natural slimming tea,' which was an uninformative euphemism for 'freakishly strong plant-based laxative'. So for three days it was like a repeat of when John mixed magnesium sulphate into my coffee syrup, only slower-acting and more intense upon effect. No vomiting, but more severe abdominal cramps than I'd ever care to reexperience. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Daddy kept me forcibly nappied despite simultaneously keeping me on a potty schedule. Emphasis on forcibly. I can't remember the last time I was in nappies for six days straight. I'd already been nappied for two days before the tea fiasco since John was endeavouring to help me stay Little more of the time.
John hesitated, then waved her downstairs again. "Yeah, well, I'll shout if I need you, how's that."
"On it," Mary reluctantly edged back to the kitchen, trying to keep an eye on them in case John lost control of Sherlock.
John fetched a clean, flannel burp cloth from a nearby linen basket and brought it to Mary, who tucked it over her shoulder to use later.
"Do you think he'll let me get close enough to practise my Mummying skills on him?" she asked conversationally.
Sherlock's tongue felt swollen and clumsy. Fighting against it, and against the sickening way his nerves vibrated, he ignored John's question and quietly asked him, with a nod at the telly to elaborate, "What did you think?"
John enacted a faux double-take and marvelled aloud, "Huh! A 'please' and a 'thank-you' both in one day? I must be doing
Sherlock was ready to explode. John wasn't averse to it as a remote concept, at least. Promising so far, but not enough to proceed with.
"Four days? You mean this," she pointed at Sherlock and the baby seat, "isn't going to let up for four days?!"
Anyway, back to the main points. I'm learning things about Molly I hadn't bothered to notice before, and she's now one of a very select few (two, to be exact) who get to see me when I'm not in a position to be as observant or 'noticing' as I normally am.
He just wanted Daddy to come downstairs, to open the door and see how sorry his little boy was for everything, and to love him enough to accept him this way. With a bittersweet pang, Sherlock allowed himself the indulgence of imagining John coming in, sitting next to him on the bed, and gathering him into a warm hug. All would have been forgiven in that hug, and John could start fresh with Sherlock. He could show Sherlock the kind of sweet boy he wanted him to be, and Sherlock would be so obedient and careful. He wanted to be a pleasant, good little baby for Daddy, even if he knew he'd get mopey from time to time and wouldn't always give John an easy go of it.
Some of the neighbours set up their holiday decorations as early as end of October. Even John agreed seeing houses lit up that soon was disgusting.
That did it. Sherlock couldn't stop himself from crying now. He didn't mean to make Daddy worried. He didn't want Daddy to feel bad. John felt bad and it was all his fault.
"Can Daddy put a diaper on you after we get you cleaned up?" John asked sweetly. He was careful to keep any hint of amusement out of his voice, as Sherlock looked like he was contemplating clocking John in the chin.
Sorry for the long hiatus. As I've mentioned on other stories in the interim, my writing PC died a year ago and I've had major incompatibility issues between old writing files and the pre-owned POS I'm stuck using until I get a new computer. Reformatting the file so I can read it and keep editing/writing is currently a slow, ongoing process.
"Yes, please." Sherlock rolled his eyes at himself after he said it. He was unnecessarily polite in his little headspace. Why bother to say 'please' when he didn't want to eat at all?
John shook his head, remembering, "I've seen him Little and kited before, once. That's the whole reason we had the restraint seat in the first place."
Gracefully indignant, Sherlock plucked the cigarette from between his lips to gawp offendedly at his partner.
And, speaking of Daddy, I've got to go because he's calling my mobile to make sure I stick to the potty training schedule. I already let it go to voicemail once, which I probably shouldn't have done.
John smiled, towelling his hands dry, and answered with a gentle, delighted, "Thank you for eating your breakfast."
Sherlock relaxed as he drank, but the beeping of the ECG distracted him from dozing off - which had partly been John's intention; he wanted to make sure Sherlock finished the entire bottle first. It wouldn't do to let Sherlock become dehydrated on top of already feeling crummy.
At first the baby just sat in John's lap like a mournful lump, trying to decide if he was being dismissed for being too needy and should be even sadder.
Sherlock's entire body utterly lax and languid, he automatically took a particularly deep, slow inhale and exhale that refreshed him to his core. Like a newborn preparing for sleep.
Over the course of the next few minutes, she was able to catch the lilting cadence of John talking sweetly to Sherlock interspersed with the sounds of a nappy change. After that, John came out to retrieve the baby bottle.
"I'm not that hungry. And I have food in here," Sherlock said. He really wasn't hungry at all. Just wickedly thirsty, dehydrated from all his crying.
Readers, you may note that le auteur has valiantly refrained from inserting any What Has It Got In Its Pocketses jokes. You're welcome. (No, really, you don't want me to go there. There are full-blown crossovers there that do not sleep. Not with ten thousand Mary-Sues could you amend this. It is folly.)
Not to mention the issue John would take if Sherlock dug out the cocaine. In addition to which there were the dregs of a few other interesting substances acquired on old cases and forays into the seedier side of his informant network.
Sherlock barely stirred until he heard the stand with the electrocardiograph roll across the floor to the cot.
It was slow going, as Sherlock immediately wobbled and lowered himself to the floor before John could react, then insisted on crawling the entire way. John humoured him, patiently leading the way and stopping every few feet to look back and see how the baby was keeping up.
The bee had become terribly faded, and this was only its second time through the wash since they'd bought it.
Once she finally had his full attention, Sherlock searched around a bit, momentarily disoriented by his own rooting reflex, and found Mary's nipple.
The tooth is fine now; there's just less of it. That single tooth is no longer taking the brunt of the force, which it previously was since it was the slightest bit longer than its neighbours, so the pressure is much more evenly distributed now when I do find my jaw clenching.
Sherlock winced as Mary wiped another stinging antiseptic square inside his navel to clean up the last traces of bleeding from the IV site.
John snatched up his ringing mobile from the back of the examination room countertop. The caller ID read Mrs. Hudson. Probably she wanted to ask him to pick up a couple items if he planned on shopping on his way home.

She didn't expect to get too involved either way, whether she was welcome to or not; she was close enough to her real due date as things were and wore out quickly, so although she was sticking around in case of emergency, most of the work was still up to John.
Daddy pressed the cold bell to Sherlock's chest, tutting an apology when a shiver immediately wracked the baby's bony shoulders.
Sherlock was sat on the floor, slouched beside the coffee table and mouthing at it. He gnawed on the edge of the wood single-mindedly until John rushed over and pulled him away from the table.
Sherlock gave a happy, if not clumsy, open-fingered clap before Daddy took his wrists and guided him to the sink to wash his hands. Sherlock imagined that John's hands scrubbed on either side of his own, helping him to wash and teaching him how at the same time.
About to move Sherlock to the tub, John realised he had a small dilemma. He needed a shower too, and he could either take it after Sherlock was clean, leaving him alone or with Mary, or they could have their bath together.
The milk was warm, thin, and slightly sweet. Pleased and contented, Sherlock cooed around Mary's breast as he sucked down his meal.
"Thank you, luv. If you need me, I'll be right here." She blew him a kiss, and picked an old periodical from atop a stack inside the box tucked under the coffee table.
4. If I can't walk through the kitchen without sneezing, it probably means one of my experiments moulded over.
He anticipated, of course, that John would respond in this vein. But if only he had given Sherlock something! Something to take and run with, to introduce the notion. To justify asking to call him Daddy.
Sherlock stirred half-heartedly at his bowl of soup, the mediocre result of two hours of toil on Mrs. Hudson's part. There were far too many celery pieces in it. And he didn't want to so much as touch the apple bits floating amongst them.
Sherlock sighed and dragged on his dressing gown, then picked his way through the shadows to the door.
Mary returned and interceded by forcibly freeing Sherlock's thumb from his mouth and coaxing him to take a freshly sterilised, standard hospital issue dummy instead.
Sherlock was about to pocket the stupid thing and scurry to his bedroom lair when John surprised him by reaching out and gently taking the pacifier from him.
Now that Sherlock had stopped flailing, John gingerly plopped down on the floor and rubbed Sherlock's knee sympathetically while he spoke,
Only John tucked in at first. Sherlock, huddled back in his chair, eyed his breakfast disinterestedly out of his peripheral vision. John swallowed a few bites, then stopped and stared at Sherlock expectantly.
"Okay, Baby," John said softly, "are you ready to put your nappy on? Going to behave while Daddy washes your face and then lets you out of the booster chair?"
Pretty soon, Sherlock found himself in their bed, still in his dungarees, drifting in and out of sleep. He wiggled his toes, noting that Daddy had removed his shoes and socks. He could also hear Daddy nearby, in the room for just a few minutes to put away some freshly laundered clothes, from the sound of it.
Daddy tapped Sherlock's jaw to try and get him to face him, saying, "Come on, Sherlock, behave. I need to give you your medicine."
Sherlock bumped a clumsy hand into his oxygen mask, apparently attempting to suck his thumb for comfort. Mary caught his wrist and deterred him before he had the chance to frustrate himself carrying on that futility.
"Uhn?" Sherlock grunted in confusion. His dummy had disappeared. He tried looking back to Daddy, but Daddy wasn't holding it anymore.
Helpless but to smile reassuringly at his insecure boy, John slung an arm around his shoulders and rephrased, "You're a very good boy, my little Sherlock, and I love you very much."
To my wonderful readers, I'm sorry the waits between chapters on all my fics have been so long, but my life has been an absolute hell for the past year and a half, and things just got worse this month. Expect the same length of delays for the indefinite future.
"There you are," John whispered when he saw Sherlock looking up at him. The doctor removed Sherlock's nasal cannula, the final piece of medical equipment that had been attached to Sherlock's body, and kissed the sleepy boy on the forehead.
Then, kissing Sherlock's forehead, he said, "My turn to wash up. Be good for ten minutes, alright, baby?"
Sherlock tried to think of something to say that would get him back on track, on the path to stealing away to the back room with his spoils, but his brain was on the fritz after running itself in circles over unresolved worries. With a defeated huff he flipped the spoon between his first two fingers and his thumb, holding it properly despite his inclination to do otherwise, and dipped it into the invitingly warm orangey slop. His little mentality was humming just below the surface of his consciousness, craving John's praise, wanting to please Daddy. Sherlock was too fatigued to fight it.
Sniffling, Sherlock swallowed the drainage from his runny nose to clear his throat and opened his mouth obediently. John poked the nipple in, and Sherlock slowly worked down the last half of the water while the other two looked on.
John sighed. He was going to have to spend maybe twenty or thirty minutes of back-and-forth prep work, but he was determined to make the room a suitable nesting space for at least the next twenty-four hours. If he could prove to himself - and Mary- that he could manage Sherlock on his own for that long, maybe they'd both feel better about him sending Mary back to their flat tomorrow, and then John wouldn't have to worry about her triggering any more panic attacks in Little Sherlock for a while, and John could have a break from feeling like he was under siege by his wife.
After a minute, Daddy approached the cot holding a medicine dropper full of well-diluted garlicky, herb-infused vinegar.
This currently has no corresponding chapter in the Blog fic because of technical difficulties, but that will hopefully change.
I'm sure he placed at least two calls, one to Mycroft and one to Molly. The first is a given, and the second was likely in order to set up babysitting for Tuesday while Daddy was at work.
In case anyone was wondering: yes, le auteur really did break a window putting a bed frame together. Not enough floor space to work with, and a coat tree ended up tipping into the window. Twice. It was the second hit that did it.
He stroked Sherlock's hair back until the little one's screams died down to soft, resentful sounding whimpers, then slid a hand between Sherlock's legs to feel up the nappy.
4b. It's a lot of fun to leave mouldy experiments about when Mycroft visits, because his mould allergy is much worse than mine.
- I bit Daddy on the shoulder because he said we couldn't buy cabbage. The Cabbage Faerie is in withdrawal; fairie power currently nil, thus fart-related pranks are at an annual low. But there is broccoli in the refrigerator, so that's looking a bit promising.
Martin swatted Ben's rump through the blankets and heard the man's disposable nappy crinkle under the impact. Shoving at his lover's back to try and force him to roll out of bed, he said, "Come on, up, now."
Sherlock nodded shyly to the spot just to the side of his solo reflection in the mirror. He enjoyed how much easier unwinding into being totally little was when he donned the assorted infantile paraphernalia he owned, but he rarely felt safe enough in the flat to do so with the risk of discovery ever looming in his mind. The twenty-pack of diapers he ordered last year was mostly unused for this reason, and also to make his stash last.
(Well, it's now the sausage and biscuits faerie, but you get the idea. The sausage component of the scent of my rear emissions is sufficiently rancid to make this more than effective.)
John, I did see that smug smirk when you caught me looking a bit green as we passed the Hobnobs at the shop yesterday. I'm very observant, remember. I'll change your laptop password back after I get an apology.
So that's how I wound up spending three days and two nights getting used to Molly knowingly acting Mummy-like and treating me Little when we weren't around other people.
Balling it up tightly and stuffing it in the small bedroom trash bin, he remarked, "Looks like you were holding it for a long time. Again. Love, you know you're not supposed to. Why didn't you wake me up sooner to use the potty?"
"Dunno," Benedict whispered guiltily, staring at the carpet, before popping his thumb in his mouth for comfort. He knew Daddy wasn't
A hint of a contented smile played across Sherlock's lips, and his eyes glazed over as if hypnotised.
Staring off into a corner, absorbing the stimulatory input, Sherlock distractedly mumbled, "Da... daaaadadadada," before stuffing part of a mitten in his mouth and sucking on it thoughtfully.
A small part of him always wondered at how physical the manifestation of sadness was. All the better he avoided it.
The narrative on this chapter is a mix of what was written last year and what I filled in just last night to make it postable, so there may be some pacing discrepancies since I haven't gone over and reread it. The next update may take me a bit longer because I now have to fill in at least one entire chapter from scratch to connect this to the next scene I have down.
Sherlock passed a wry, lopsided smile. The doctor had noticed the lack of disorder and mayhem in the flat after all.
John leaned back, rubbing Sherlock's belly, and tried to soothe him, "Okay, I know. You're finished now."
If Mrs. H does discover the cot and asks questions, the plan is for John to assert that locking me into the bed at night is the only way to ensure I stay asleep. Or something along those lines, we're still arguing over what exactly to tell her. Daddy doesn't want Mrs. H to think we're into BDSM, never mind that I already know John secretly is.
Bouncing him on his knee a bit, John said, "I guess that's a yes. How about you go fold the laundry and bring it up, like you were supposed to do, and while you do that Daddy will set up your Little stuff. Yeah?"
John was ready to just whip the chair out from under him and drag him to the bathroom when he thought of something else.
One good thing is the cot is holding up very well. The shattered window was worth it, no matter what John says. Unfortunately, I won't be sleeping in it tonight. I estimate it won't be safe to leave my hiding spot until mid-morning tomorrow.
Sherlock chewed his lip and worried his fingers around each other, thinking back to remember what he ingested. "I had water."
She made sure to carefully pull his hand out of the swaddling at one point, to check his fingers. They were a healthy, warm pink, and the baby bundled in her arms felt appropriately warm overall. His condition was definitely improving.
," John exclaimed, gripping Sherlock's arms briefly to confirm it. He felt Sherlock's forehead, then his icy fingers. Quickly, he lifted the blankets and urged Sherlock under them. He fretted as he tucked him in, "You're freezing! Why didn't you put on some slippers, or a warmer shirt?"
Showing only minor disappointment, Sherlock took it out and set it carefully on a low shelf in his bookcase.
I don't mind it much, after all it's my smell, but Daddy pulls a face when I get too close. I've had some fun with that. I farted in his lap during a cuddle and told him he'd been blessed by the Christmas Cabbage Faerie.
Christmas Cabbage Faeries don't like being shoved out of people's laps; it's a bit painful depending on the drop to the floor. That's my excuse for not bothering with a gift for John this year. At least, not a gift for under the tree. Gifts from my nappies are another story. I'm going to be quite generous with those for the next couple days.
None of the interviewees on the telly shared Sherlock's demographic precisely, for which he was perversely grateful. It slimmed the likelihood of John connecting him to the practises depicted.
Sherlock let John think he had woken late the next morning. How Sherlock really spent his morning was a secret.
After sitting the baby up to wash his back, legs, and feet, John drained the tub and wrapped Sherlock in two large towels. Somehow he found the strength to carry Sherlock for the trip back to the bedroom, but he doubted he would manage it a third time in one day.
Re-dressing him managed to jostle Sherlock awake a couple of times, but he never kept his eyes open for more than a moment.
Just then, two pieces of toast popped out of the toaster at heart-attack speed, making both Sherlock and John jump. The cereal box slammed down onto its shelf with unintentional force.
Next, the doctor approached with some sort of probe in the form of a short, thin rod on the end of a bundle of wires. He carefully slid the probe into Sherlock's protruding bellybutton, the tight depth of which held the rod in place all on its own.
. Thou shalt not make unto thee an excess of more than one photo shaming nonsense post in the passing of one month.
John sighed at him again, lamenting how much Sherlock must have beat himself up to reach this point. His gaze roved about the room in their silence, and an idea formed.
Blushing over the attention drawn to his 'incontinence', Sherlock smiled shyly and hid his face in John's neck.
Sherlock wanted to know what it was like to be an only child with a doting Daddy who genuinely enjoyed spending time with him. Not an alcoholic-workaholic Daddy who only stepped in when Mummy needed help enforcing her discipline.
Bashful, Sherlock procrastinated and rubbed his face into his knees. Something like a whine caught in his throat.
Sherlock thought to himself without knowing why he went out of his way with his internal dialogue just to torture himself,
John wrote on his blog this morning that I've been "mopey". I'm not moping, I'm bored. My last case was too short and not very stimulating. All I've really got to show for it is a bruised up left calf from chasing someone. Solved it in two hours, arrest and all. The perp was possibly the stupidest one I've ever taken down.
John nodded, reluctantly coming to the same conclusion. Until Mary confirmed it, John's guilt over leaving Sherlock alone for most of the time since his return nagged at him, making him question if the injuries were more recent, something John could have prevented by being more vigilant.
I did manage to wake up before John on the second of the month and slip in a cup of coffee before he was anywhere near the kitchen. I've sort of become re-addicted to coffee in the past few weeks, which Daddy's not happy about. He complains about it quite a lot, in fact. The effects of that level of caffeine aren't predictable; some nights I'll lie awake until dawn, other nights I'll fall asleep by ten but wake up at two a.m. and remain awake.
John tutted and explained, "No, Sherlock, this is Daddy's coffee. You're too small to drink this sort of stuff, remember?"
"I'm so proud of you, that you went like a big boy," Daddy said, "but you're really little today, aren't you? If no one's around, maybe we'll get you into a diaper, hm? I know that helps my little boy relax."
"There's that measuring stick in one of the kitchen drawers," John suggested with no small amount of snark. He scrolled up the news page to find where he'd left off.
Sherlock slept through the night with John beside him. Mary was upstairs in the attic bed after a solo trip to the Watson's flat for their overnight things. Whenever the doctor woke, he would check that Sherlock was still breathing. He was a light breather in sleep under normal circumstances, something John had to panickily remind himself of a few times that night.
Molly gave me some odd looks while she was over, but I was too Little at the time to deduce exactly why. Subjectively, it felt as though she may have been attempting to guilt trip me into feeling remorse for running away with the last of my stash. I'm not sure.
Mary still keeps in touch, so John tells me. It sounds as though she's happy enough with her new life. I can't elaborate any more than that, but there it is.
Normally Mycroft is the one afflicted with hiccups because he just plain eats too much and cramps his diaphragm. I'm not used to experiencing the same myself, and it was not only annoying but humiliating. I've asked ('demanded,' John says... whatever...) John not let on to Mycroft or I'll lose the upper hand when it comes to mocking him about his.
Love and cuddles and baby talk for Sherlock, and eventually kisses if he wanted to keep the detective calm, felt like more than John ever wanted to reveal to her. But there was nothing for it now. He'd need her support in caring for Sherlock. She was right about that.
"I'm trying to get him to hop!" Sherlock explained. "He hopped before when I poked him, but now that he's up against the stump he won't."
Hopefully recent experience has also taught him for the future that scheduling me for a dentist appointment against my will automatically instigates a game of hide-and-seek that he is incapable of winning until said appointment is cancelled or missed.
Sherlock grunted in protest behind his pacifier, (his nippie, the ghost of Mrs. Holmes' voice chimed in,) but gradually rolled off the bed all the same, knowing Daddy was right. He studiously ignored the fact that he couldn't feel Daddy's hand when Daddy reached down to rub Sherlock's tummy to verify the state of his bladder. Instead, he blushed and arched just a bit into the nonexistent touch.
When it was over, John cleared his throat and glanced at Mary with just a hint of nerves before asking Sherlock in a fond tone, "Did baby go wee-wee just now?"
After a brief, befuddled stare down while he removed his boots and coat, John crossed the kitchen and set up dinner with an occasional wary glance back at Sherlock, who waited patiently on the floor.
Sherlock shrugged and murmured, "I appreciate you cooking, John, I really do... but I'm not really hungry."
While Ben groaned and slowly slid out of bed, Martin crawled up to the corner on his side and fumbled until he found the bedside lamp.
at his oversight and apologised, "I had no idea you were feeling nauseous, baby. I'm sorry. Can you try to let me know as soon as you're feeling well enough to take another bottle?"
He checked painstakingly along every part of Sherlock's body for any sign of a pinprick or suspicious discolouration; any sign that Mary had tried to drug him further in the minutes she had alone with him.
He hadn't exactly asked her permission to remodel the rooms inside, but he'd noted upon his initial visit (the one when he and John had legitimately been invited) that there were many more rooms than Irene knew what to do with. The most she could get mad at him for was trespassing, and he was quite certain she wouldn't even bother over that.
Sherlock managed two burps, then John eased him back down. Sherlock's skin still felt hot. John decided against putting Sherlock's booties on for his nap; if he cooled down while he was asleep, John would simply cover him with the thin blanket folded over the foot of the cot. It was a cute blanket that brightened up the room just being where it was, covered in tiny pastel bunnies.
It took both of them to strap a writhing Sherlock into the baby seat. The main fastener was in the back, where Sherlock couldn't reach it to release himself, and the weighted base more or less kept the whole thing from tipping over while the skinny detective wriggled and threw a tantrum.
"Don't fall off," Martin chuckled. He stood close and petted Benedict's pillow-mussed hair while they waited.
The purpose of the question was twofold; to alert Mary that a diaper change was imminent, whether she wanted to stick around to watch or not, and to let Sherlock know that Daddy cared about him and was paying attention to his bodily functions.
Otherwise, her intrigued expression said she was more or less comfortable with the way things were proceeding. It probably helped a great deal that it wasn't her lap being peed in.
No one would. Long-term especially, people found Sherlock too much to handle as his adult self; how on earth could he ask it of someone to deal directly with his overly needy 'little' side on top of the rest?
He was stuck in the same hazy, not-completely-little-nor-completely-big place that he was on Monday. He wanted to please John and to secretly pretend Real-John was Daddy, but knew he couldn't give himself away in the meantime.
John gave him a look and shook his head. "Let's just stay out here and have a nice meal together, hm?" he implored gently.
There was indeed another toad, and this time much bigger. It must have been its obvious adult status that made Sherlock more confident about interacting with this one. He nudged the end of his stick at the toad's legs, and behind it, trying to get it to hop.
The toad wasn't having any of it, though. It appeared to John to be tapping into its self-preservation instincts, keeping stock still in the face of a playful predator.
. And there was nothing for it, because there was work to be done and lives depended on you. But you didn't bounce back, really. And then since Monday I've barely managed to get two words out of you, and I know that's normal but, God, Sherlock, you have no idea how hard it is not to worry."
Sherlock scooted across the carpet after him and stopped at the door. He took a minute to listen for signs that the real John Watson might be about the flat, but it seemed quiet enough.
He and Daddy locked eyes. Daddy smiled one of his most wonderful happy smiles, the kind where the corners of his eyes got all crinkly, and rested his palm flat on Sherlock's lower belly just above his nappy.
"Sherlock, shhhh. Shh," John said as he ran his hands down Sherlock's legs to place a warning grip on the boy's ankles.
Mary clipped a pulse oximeter to Sherlock's finger, then checked his pupil responsiveness with a penlight while John immediately donned his stethoscope and listened to Sherlock's heart and lungs. The ausculator wasn't all that cold, having been in John's coat pocket for a while, but felt strange on Sherlock's skin. When John pressed it close to Sherlock's umbilical cord, the baby could feel the tension on his umbilical knot trapped outside its normal resting place by the clamp ring.
"No? Okay..." Uncertainly, John picked up the mug himself and coaxed Sherlock to lift his head. He brought the mug to Sherlock's lips, tilting it in slow repetition until Sherlock took in total at least a few small sips.
Or perhaps not toddling. There was no way of predicting exactly how regressed Sherlock would be today until John actually saw him, but by the sound of the untempered crying the detective was feeling quite small.
