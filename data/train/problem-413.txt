, so he slows his thrusts to a lazy grind, lets them catch their breaths, traces a lax path with his lips from John’s cheek to ear and says, “I want you to fuck me again; want it slower.”
Sherlock’s smile falters, just a bit. “What?”
“An admirable man.”

An hour to midnight, we settled upon the neutral and pertinent subject of New Year’s traditions as practiced by my Scottish ancestors and which were, by that year,

He could absolutely
“Yes. Great,” Molly agrees, voice cracking.
They look at each other for a stretch.
The moment John’s hands lock around Sherlock’s neck (teeming pulse), John is hauled none too gently to his feet, his shoulders nearly dislocated, and manhandled out of the restaurant.
He pushes his arse back against John’s cock, squirms in John’s grip, his objective clear.
I ignored him, and removed the violin from its case.
Sherlock decides to tell him the story of his grandmother’s life in love: how, despite all odds, she’d fallen in love at the age of sixty and had managed twenty happy years in an idyllic Norfolk cottage with her partner Flora (in their own little world, orbiting each other, all their unbecoming and becoming quirks and pastimes mutually appreciated and understood and loved). Those twenty happy years were the ones in which Sherlock had known her. He does not mention the twenty years she’d had to live alone in that cottage, after Flora’s death.
“And the others,” Sherlock says, clearing his throat as he passes over the rest of the sketches.
“Wrong,” Sherlock says, hooking his hands underneath her armpits and raising her aloft.
“A curious statement, as you have given me more than I deserve.”
“My dear John,” Holmes said softly, cupping my cheek in his bracelet-less hand. “We needn’t the pageantry of matrimony for validation of our affections.”
“And he’s back.”
“Oh, hello,” the woman says, perching her sunglasses onto her nostrils like a pince-nez, and Sherlock zeroes in on the faint jaundice of her eyes. “Is this Father?”
Sherlock turns around and John hastily undoes Sherlock's trouser button and zip, then his own, and fists both of their hard, pre-come pearled cocks together, pulling at them--silkyhot--in feverish desperation.
?” Molly says.
“S’pose so, if he’s figurine-worthy.” He reconsiders. “Though, I s’pose any old plonker could have a figurine made in their likeness.”
“Where else did you go, ‘round these parts?” John asks, and Sherlock will never stop being surprised by John’s curiosity. It is a generous curiosity, because he wants to know Sherlock. He wants to understand.
“Yeah!” Wiggins agrees spiritedly, clearly hoping to get in Molly’s good graces, but Molly doesn’t notice the attempt.
“Daddy! Sherlah! Why are you hiding?”
Sherlock plays
Hafiz grins, petting his son’s hair. “Yep. Had to do
John grins wickedly, then picks up their duffel bag. “Shall we unpack or just pull stuff out of the bag?” Sherlock gives John an incisive sweep-over. “
When the ceremony ends, Mummy turns on her heel and stalks away, as if she couldn’t possibly endure a moment more of the ritual, her ululations ringing throughout the cavernous cemetery.
“Apparation?” Rosie asks.

make observations?”
John scoffs. “Yeah, okay, being a posh git who knows how to ballroom dance doesn’t make you a better dancer, universally.”
Sherlock slowly lifts his hand, fingertips to John’s fingers curved around the glass. Looks expectantly at John.
Mycroft eyes Sherlock warily. “Then again, perhaps we should leave the cake for Sherlock alone. He could stand to gain some weight, lest he disappear.”

Once John shuts the door on the passenger’s side, Sherlock shifts to Drive and peels out the garage.
himself to be attracted to Sherlock. If the events of the past decade had taught him anything, they had shown him, in a torturous and roundabout way, what he wanted all along: Sherlock. In friendship, in work, and, well...in life. And if the events of the past several decades had taught him anything, it’s that he’s always had a simmering attraction to and affection for close male friends, but he’d never nursed them, never let them bloom, always cut them off at the root. But now he’s giving these feelings room to grow, and it’s freeing. And now those feelings are unlike anything he's ever experienced.
Molly and John nod in agreement, their eyes equally starry.
At dawn, delirious with exhaustion, John allows himself to think about Sherlock.
Sherlock’s finger slides across the notches of John’s leather belt. “You were attracted to her to the degree of distraction.“
“Not yet, Watson,” Sherlock calls out. “Let’s see if it’s a friendly animal.”
. You are a forty year old man; it’s time to grow up.”
It’s said as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
Said as if the fact had existed from time immemorial.
“Yeah.” John is watching him. “All right.”
They’ve obviously never
they’d drawn each other's names in the exchange. (Sherlock had been reasonably certain, at one point, that other people existed. But perhaps he’d been mistaken.)
Somewhere along this good-bye tour, I found myself in Hatton Garden, that area of London reputed for its jewelry shops. As I strolled before glass windows with glinting, opulent wares on display, I did not expect my mood to turn dark. It was twice before that I journeyed to that very place to purchase marriage-rings for my wives, who have long since passed from this earthly plane. Their premature deaths were uncommonly cruel, their abundances of kindness and beauty great losses to the world, and an outsider would not hesitate to categorise me as an unlucky man; a habitual widower.
, that Oneness with the Creator, but perhaps it was something akin to what I felt in that moment.
A few days ago, Sherlock had conducted burn tests on various articles of clothing for the purpose of learning more about fibre classification. John hadn’t appreciated the smell, particularly from the acrylic fibre (bit fishy, that one).
In the tent, Sherlock is lying on his stomach atop his towel, chin pillowed on his arms.
John’s barbed mood softens significantly when they get to Hampstead Heath, though it’s impossible not to be mollified by the majesty of the Pergola, a veritable maze of verdant greenery that winds around trellises and archways and stone pillars.
“Do you remember where you were sitting in the train?”
When he had gone through all the comments on the current post, he decided to look back over some of the older posts. John was still asleep, and he thought that it might help stave off the boredom.
John had been in the middle of a very patient response to a comment on “The Proof is in the Paint.” The respondent was questioning the particular chain of reasoning that Sherlock had used to deduce that the callus on trigger finger of the victim had come from endless hours of playing paintball and not from firing a gun that shot actual bullets. John had been very politely explaining the different materials used in the manufacture of the paintball gun. Sherlock, however, couldn’t believe that anyone had needed to ask a question with such an obvious answer. He wanted to delete John’s patient (and very thorough) explanation and call the woman out for her idiocy, but, instead, he finished the sentence that John had been writing and posted the comment. He then quickly signed in under his own name because he couldn’t resist adding his own little postscript - “Obviously.”
“Regret is a sentimental response, Sherlock, though not as obvious as my tears.”  Katherine closes her eyes again, laying her head back against the chair.
“Sherlock!” When he didn’t get an immediate reply, he yelled again, “Sherlock!”
“Sherlock, can you help me with her coat and take her pressure?” His flatmate has already slid the cuff up Katherine's arm.
She sits up in the chair, allowing Mycroft to put a cushion behind her back. She takes the toast that offers her, eats a few bites, and takes a long drink from the glass of water he has left on the side table. She sighs.
Sherlock laughs at that. “Mycroft doesn’t have friends, John. I’ve only had a few.  But Katherine made an impression on us both.”
He goes to wash up and change, leaving her under the care of the highly competent nurse that Mycroft has supplied.  Mrs. Hudson has found her way into the kitchen, and she’s busy making tea and sandwiches for everyone.  Eating is the last thing that any of them would think about, but she knows that they’ll need fuel to keep them going. There is no rest in sight.
Sherlock helped him put his robe on, and went ahead of him down the stairs, ready to catch him if he stumbled. John found his way to the toilet while Sherlock put on the kettle. He came back down the hall, wondering aloud about the contents of the bucket in the shower, and stretched out on the couch. Sherlock launched into a description of his current experiment while he made the tea and was explaining that the kitchen sink was too small, hence the bucket. When he brought John his tea a moment later, he found that John had fallen asleep again. Sherlock left the tea on the coffee table, fetched a glass of water to place beside it, and covered John with the afghan from the back of the sofa.
“You mean that I wouldn’t leave either of you alone, so you both eventually gave up and tolerated me.”
“I know. To have an adoring teenage girl completely in awe of your intellectual prowess and worshipping the very ground you both walked on had to have been so trying. How ever did you cope?”
"She breathes too loudly. I couldn't sleep anymore." She sinks back in the chair, trying to get comfortable. "I don't suppose you have something I could prop my feet on, do you?"
Mycroft returns with towels, and gauze, followed closely by Mrs. Hudson.
“I am sure that he will.  Where is Mycroft? Will he be back soon?”  She is sitting with her eyes closed, looking as though the trip from his room to the lounge drained her of what little energy she had.
“Mycroft had said something about your blog showing an increase in traffic from New York recently. I wondered if that might be a possibility.”
Katherine stands up, turns around, and walks over to Mycroft. She looks up at him for just a moment before she throws her arms around him and begins to cry.  Mycroft hesitates just a moment before he raises his arms and returns her embrace. With that, her crying becomes full out sobbing. He tightens his embrace, and he lets her cry.
“Would you like a cup of tea?”
Mycroft could have done a lot of things differently, but he did not allow himself to feel regret. He had done the right thing, and he would not hesitate to do it again, though he would endeavor to be less abrasive in his approach.
John is staring at the scene before him, mouth dropped open in surprise. Sherlock passes behind him, and reaches out to take his hand, pulling him through the kitchen and down the hall without a word. They end up in Sherlock’s room and push the door closed silently.
Sherlock has come into the room, putting John’s bag on the coffee table, and he kneels down nearby, ready to assist his flatmate as needed.  Mycroft is doing what he does best, texting away on his phone, making things happen, resources available in the way that only he can.   “Just tell me what you need, John.”
Katherine looks up at her old friend and smiles.  It is a tired, sad smile, but he can tell that she is trying to keep the sadness at bay.  She isn’t trying to hide it from him - she knows that would be near impossible. She is trying to hide it from herself, at least for a while longer. He takes a long look at how she has changed in the last twenty years.  She has aged well. She’s put on weight, but it actually suits her.
“I was sad to see you go, Katherine. But it was not for the reason you may have thought.  You were one of the few friends I have ever made. You were, and no doubt still are, my equal.  But I wasn’t in love with you. You didn’t break my heart.  Not that way.”
“Terrorize Mycroft? Well, you’re right in my book.” John is enjoying the mischievous gleam in Sherlock’s eyes as he reminisces.
Chapter 2
“Oh, dear.”
In the 13 years he had lived in Europe, Mateo had never stayed in one place longer than a year or two. His longest stay had been in Barcelona, with Katherine. He had even been investigating the purchase of a house there, with the baby on the way. It seems that he had hoped for the best, but that he’d always planned for the worst.  On the afternoon that he’d gone to call his brother, surveillance cameras had picked him up entering four different branches of multinational banks. He’d made substantial withdrawals from accounts in four different names.  He also retrieved several unknown items from a safe deposit box at a fifth bank, one that catered to a very select clientele who wished to protect their privacy. Mycroft had never heard of it, and he assumed that was not an accident.
She moves over to the far side of the bed, ready to do whatever is asked of her. John can hear Mycroft hurrying down the stairs to retrieve supplies as soon as they arrive.  He’s doing what he can to stop the bleeding, while listening to Sherlock’s updates on her blood pressure. He wishes he had stronger drugs in the bag, but there is normally no call for that. He sighs with relief when he hears Mycroft running back up the stairs. He rushes into the room, followed by Anthea, bags of emergency supplies in her hands.
Sherlock considers John’s insight. “I don’t know. She wouldn’t have taken the risk to travel such a great distance being that far along unless it were necessary. She’s always been a terribly practical person.”
“Then perhaps you’d like a cup of tea or coffee, something hot to warm you up?”
I cough and turn my head to look at John. "I always knew," I tell him. He looks over at me for a moment before we both burst into laughter.
"Aye, very good assessment, John. I'm sure it was not the first time you were held at gunpoint, and it certainly will not be the last time. Best accept that now."
My right hand slips and dangles, my left has too loose of a grip for me to reach back up and take hold. I'm slipping and I plan out potential next moves. There's a net on the side on the ship, if I fall at just the right angle I could take hold and—
“How could you possibly know that?” John turned to him. “For all you know my parents could be like yours, complete homophobes.”
Violet lets out a rough cry. “And I was already planning your future. Your children, and the beautiful wedding with your wife in my lovely wedding gown.”
John was in a bad place. There were, brief, times on some nights when he thought Moriarty was right, there was something more. But those nights John had been drinking, and felt his loss the strongest.
Sherlock stared at Mycrofts back as he walked away.
Lestrade looks weary. "Everything is on board now, I have the crew preparing the ship. Managed to get twenty-eight people willing to go. Crazy bastards."
That was when Sherlock stumbled across another Ninja Turtle themed card that, to Sherlocks surprise, actually had words handwritten on the inside.
“Yes. God forbid you ever truly stand up for yourself. All you do is blabber all their secrets. That doesn't exactly help to get very many people to like you.” John stated in annoyance.
“I’ve been good,” John sighed and looked up to the house. “Really good actually.”
John was also immediate to call Lestrade. There is no way these men are not the killers, and even more so they have attempted to kill he and Sherlock. Certainly if they are not the suspects, then they know something that the police cannot know about.
“John?”
I frowned. "You followed me? Impossible. I make sure I am never followed." I argued with him.
“Clearly so.” John snapped back. “What have I told you about the experiments in the kitchen, Sherlock?”
"I need a crew."
"I'm serious," I tell him with a glare.
me.” John argued. “You took my hand and
"Yes please," I said just as John choked on a gasp behind me.
John and I continued preparing the ship, John began to adjust the sails in final preparations when he called out for me in a hushed tone. My eye roll came on its own, this man sailed the sea with the Royal Navy, surely he can tie a few ropes. When I reached him, Johns brow is furrowed and his eyes are focused on the shore.
“Wrong, they weren't committed by the same person. If you did more than just
John stared at him. “You’re the one who said we are gay.” He pointed out.
I watch John and Lestrade step aboard, and see Lestrade pull the gangplank before untying the ropes keeping the ship in place at the dock. The crew rushes about, with Lestrade yelling last-minute demands at them before we are finally pulling away from the harbor. I steer the ship towards the open sea and the storm straight ahead. Mycroft won't let a storm slow him down, so neither will I. If Mycroft fails at the caves, then I don't want to miss it.
Doctor Harrison looked down at his clipboard. “Alright well his vitals look good, his heart and breathing is stable and regular. Luckily he wasn't injured anywhere too deadly, so no internal bleeding. But you should keep an eye out for any bruising in the area, and also bleeding. It wasn't exactly a clean cut, so make sure he doesn't stretch or move too severely to tear the stitches.”
"Don't you feel it, John?"
They stood there waiting until they were sure he was gone. And soon enough, the two of them departed. Johns heart didn't stop aching the whole drive home.
John balled his fists together and closed his eyes, counting to three in his head. So this is Sherlocks way of being ‘not bored’, well John will not have any of it. He thinks he has taken the bullet-filled walls, explosive experiments, almost eating dead body parts, and playing the violin at three in the morning pretty well. But this? This is taking it too far.
“I don’t care if they like me.” Sherlock said with petulance. “I don't like
“Ugh. God. Harry. No.” John rubbed his forehead with his hand.
This was not how John had imagined the conversation to go.
“The third is that day on the crosswalk when that absolutely dimwitted and
“Because you got me into this.”
It was a normal day, well normal for anyone that wasn’t Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. It had been weeks since their last case and Sherlock was getting testy. John can’t take it when Sherlock is conducting hazardous experiments and shooting walls, but it’s even worse when he is sulking on the couch yelling
didn't know you know?”
“It is Johns choice if he wants to remain in the closet.” Lydia continued plainly.
Once on flat land, I was again greeted by my loving brother. "Going somewhere, brother?" That condescending smile is on his chapped lips again. There is a sudden nagging at the back of my mind that something isn't quite right, I ignore it in favor of just leaving already.
"Yes," I drag out the word as if I could slow down time to keep John from asking more. I slump in the booth and stare at the flame dancing in the short wax candle.
. Although that did not stop Johns thoughts of Sherlock alone somewhere in the corn bleeding to death. It brought John back to his time in Afghanistan, and his soldiers bleeding out too far from John to reach. He had never felt more helpless in his life, and even more so now because he can’t even
Angelo brings them their drinks, and puts in their order when Sherlock states ‘the usual.’
“On the contrary, there are a lot of people who are nothing like their parents.” John stated, feeling contentious.
Day thirty-two:
Lestrade glared at me.
," he throws back, "I just know suicide when I see it. Sailing in this is exactly that."
I've always enjoyed storms. Since I was a child, there was something about the way lightning lit up my room and the rain gave off that distinct smell. The thunder would rumble and I could feel it shake in my bones and down to my very core.
John stared at Sherlock who’s leaning against the tree with his usual grace and elegance. John inwardly smiled, only Sherlock could pull off tree-leaning and make it look as if it’s an act the Queen should be mimicking.
John was dumbfounded. “Er- no Sherlock. Of course not.”
Sherlock growled. Everything is inconclusive. Need more data.
John glared at him. He has gotten use to Sherlocks insults, but they still get to him when it comes to his intelligence. “Why don't you enlighten me with your knowledge? Unless you think my small brain won’t comprehend it.”
"Is that so?" I raised my eyebrows.
John Watson is a boy of kindness. He is the type of person who loves everything and everyone; he can see the best in even the worst people. His mother has always told him that he is ‘her little angel’, always listening and always taking care of those around him.
“But-” John didn't get a chance to protest as he was forced out of the way by another paramedic boarding, the one John spoke to followed closely and shut the doors on him.
And that is why John went to every trusted resource he knew to get the photos tested for credibility. It took four different technicians before John actually believed them. The photos are real, and have not been tampered with in any way, shape, or form.
Sherlock studied John once again, his face revealing nothing but his eyes always flicked across Johns face and stance, trying to figure out his every thought and every dirty secret. John shifted uncomfortably.
John opened his mouth then shut it. Clearly he hadn't thought this idea through. "And what makes you think I would help you?" I continued.
It was around midday when we reached our stop. John anchored the ship when we pulled to port, but I couldn't stop staring at the skies in the distance. The first place I was planning to find Mycroft is in the direction of those storm clouds, and I don't like storms.
He approaches me with a giant smile and pulls me into a bone-crushing hug. It may be true that I haven't been home in a while but word must have spread about the gallows for Angelo to be more delighted than usual to see me.
Sherlock pouted in his seat, he could just ask everyone who got the Ninja Turtle cards except he has received about six other similar ones. (The creativity in the class lacks significantly, not that that is any news to Sherlock).
Plus John didn’t deserve the attention it would bring, and John definitely didn’t deserve the person that was willing enough to break the barriers away. John is undeserving of Sherlock, John should be pushing him away like he does with everything else, but instead he is pulling him closer, selfishly.
I pat him on the shoulder, genuinely glad to have his help again. "You're a good man, Graham."
John held his breath and turned, awaiting the rude lecture.
John rubbed his temples with his fingers. This is all too much for one morning. With a sigh, he spoke only once more to Sherlock for the entire morning. “Just, clean this mess up.” And John left to the bathroom feeling utterly defeated and exhausted.
The two of them walked in the direction Harry and Clara wandered off in and entered a pleasant looking kitchen and dining room. The color scheme could very much resemble a grandparents house out in the country side. White and peach danced around the room, from the walls down to the color of the table cloth and plates. A glass sliding door is open wide, letting in the cool breeze of autumn. Harry and Clara are outside at the large oak tree, pushing each other on the tire swing. John remembered when they first got the swing, he had wanted a tree house, but his father had told him the branches weren't quite right to build one, so they got a tire swing instead. A swing that, even now, Harry hogs with all her might.
And that is why John was doing his very best at creating the greatest Valentines card and picking out the most delicious looking piece of candy in the bag to give to Sherlock. This guy is fascinating to John, and he wants to acknowledge this, considering no one else ever has. His classmates just call him a Freak and run the opposite direction on the playground. John wondered if Sherlocks family knows how smart the boy is and can appreciate such intelligence. No one else seems to.
I stood up and walked to the cell bars dividing us. "That is what I said," I frowned at him. I was caught between determining whether John is intelligent or stupid. Then decided on both, but now I'm not so sure.
“He’s lying. Who are you going to believe? Me or the Freak? Just look at him, there is a reason nobody likes him or wants to be near him. He’s just repulsive.”
But it isn't, you cared so you came and then you ended up on death row because you were recognized. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Sherlock stared at him with a surprised expression. Sherlock had never expected to be looked up upon, only has he ever been looked down on or was intimidating enough for people to run away screaming. Sherlock has never felt before, he only felt when he got Valentines and most recently when he became friends with John. John Watson will always be a puzzle to Sherlock, this confession proving it.
“You knew it would wake me then.” John said, wanting it to sound like a question but came out confident enough to be stated as a fact.
John stared at me. "Er- not exactly."
John sighed. Sherlock Holmes is impossible.
"You're sailing into the unknown with me. Surely you trust me to
The case had brought them to the outskirts of the city to an abandoned farm. Although, saying it was abandoned may have been a misconception.
? John needs this and he will take it with open arms.
After class, John packed his things as quickly as possible and was out the door before anyone else even had the chance to stand up. John made it all the way to the parking lot before he was stopped by someone. Dammit, he was so close.
“Sorry, did I ask for your opinion?” John says, all ice, and Molly looks scandalised by the lancing comment.
Hasn’t he suffered enough?
, “Though, of course, we wish we could’ve seen you twice under happier circumstances.” Leaning back, he takes Sherlock in. “Forty years old--my god.” A squeeze of Sherlock’s shoulder. “Where has the time gone?”
“Hiya.” She spoke to John in a sing-song voice. God, this woman has the voice of an angel. “I’m Sheryl.” She twirled a strand of hair around her finger and leaned against the table top looking down at John and completely disregarding the other two men with him.
So John did the only thing he could think of: get Sherlock out of the flat, and that was a feat on its own because
None of the men moved or even nodded. I pushed the barrel more forcefully into Johns temple, making him flinch. I stared at the sailors expectantly, they nodded. I watched the three men rushing about the ship like animals in a trap, keeping a sharp eye for any tricks they may pull over. The men on deck kept their eyes on the gun pointed to Johns head, unwavering. John stood still in my tight grasp, his eyes also on the other sailors. No doubt he knows most of them. Two men seem to be having a conversation with John just by facial expression. Pity and sympathy from one, the other is a searing rage. Ugh, pathetic human emotions. What good can they do you? Especially now when John is facing imminent death and there is nothing to be done about it?
John sighed and continued to stare at him. His eyebrows drawn down in a frown, and lips shaped in a scowl. It is a funny sight to see, Sherlock pouting in public with his back supported by the trunk of the tree and one foot propped up against it, arms tightly crossed over his chest. His cheeks and nose are growing pink from the cold, John is sure his are too, although the sun is helping. Sherlock is probably freezing, but isn’t saying a word because of his dignity.
, emotions, always getting in the way.
"So I'm just supposed to trust you then? A pirate."
The following years were much the same. Sherlock was growing impatient and actually aggravated that he hasn't been able to figure it out yet. But goddamn the school is huge with over three-thousand students. In grade school, his classrooms ranged from thirty to forty students, but he never so much has given someone the time of day let alone a second glance.
John didn't hear the piano pick up again until he was safely inside his room and tucked under the sheets. The melody danced through the walls and it took John a few counts before he recognized the tune. It is the same song Sherlock plays on his violin, the one he plays when John wakes up from his nightmares. It usually helps him fall back asleep—how Sherlock can deduce
"There is only one person that lives so far off the reservation," John stated easily as if none of this is a big deal. "And that's Maryse."
"All in good time," John muttered.
“It’s safe to say no one is in there then.” John said over Sherlocks shoulder. Sherlock shook his head and forcefully ran his fingers through his hair. A part of John admired how the pale of his fingers and the black of his curls contrast so nicely, another part wanted to slap himself for it.
In Language Arts, there is a girl named Sarah who talks to John constantly, and all his friends told him that she has a major crush on him. Too bad he wasn't interested, she would've made a great girlfriend with her sweet eyes and kind smile.
feeling alright?” John shot back.
To address a specific comment, I am sorry there isn't enough BAMFness. A plot must be created before I can put the characters through hell and force them to be a BAMF. This isn't a story where the characters are automatically developed in that way. They are BAMFs in their own right at the moment given their occupations and will continue to grow as such even if it's not obvious right now.
John sees Sherlock shift in his seat from his peripheral vision.
“He wont want to see you.” John argued. He couldn't decide which was worse: Sherlock waking up alone, or Sherlock waking up with
Of course, it is not required to sign names, not everyone does, but John always signed his name. Always. And he really wanted to on that Valentine.
“Yes you are.”
John looked over to said classmate on the other side of the room. The boy looked intent with his process of reading his Valentines. His dark, curly hair fell over his face as he read one particular card for longer than the others. Suddenly, Sherlock was flipping the card to and fro as if searching for something. John looked away and tried to look busy incase the boy started looking about the classroom.
"Ow. Sherlock what the hell-"
“Yes. She seems to know you very well John.” Mrs. Hudson said with a smile. “Don’t know how much longer I can keep her occupied. She’s persistent, this one.”
The tingling in the hand Sherlock held never faded for the rest of the day.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in his seat, avoiding Johns eye. “Doesn't matter.”
All the while, I could sense John growing antsy. Now he runs in front of me, forcing me to stop abruptly, and effectively block my direction of travel. "I thought we were going to be honest with each other." He looks into my eyes with those annoying big blues of his and watches as I roll mine in return if only to break the intensity of his gaze.
“John.” Sherlock challenged, like his sister had earlier.
So come Valentines Day, Sherlock wasn’t all that surprised to receive a high school version of a candy gram which gave you many more options like roses, candies, stuffed animals, singers (yes some members of the choir come in a group and sing annoying love songs) so all the really tedious relationship things that would usually set Sherlocks teeth on edge, given his circumstances, slightly excited him.
John attempted to go back to sleep. He shut his eyes and tried to let the music lull him back, like the strings of a violin could, but the sound is too foreign. Although it’s peaceful and calming, it is distracting from his attempts at sleep.
Harry rolled her eyes. “But-”
Peanut butter cups. He’s never had them before but he is trusting his admirer to be a good judge in taste as seeing he is a good judge in character (meaning himself, obviously.)
"And then you went into this mansion on the outskirts of the city so I stopped and waited for you. When you came out I followed you into town, watched you get chased, discovered who you are, learned your brother kidnapped my sister and other innocent people and found you in the cellar." John stated matter-of-factly. Yes, it was all quite obvious. But I needed to know what John saw.
“Just like old times.” Johns father stated in amusement, to no one in particular.
"John?" One of the men called in surprise, all of them stared at John in pure shock. Huh, a well-known, liked, and respected Captain then.
"And I steady." A pause. "Sherlock, it's over."
and taken care of
"I don't." John said stubbornly, watching me strap my weapons around my waist.
John frowned, not quite following. “Bees?”
extent."
"Uh, Sherlock?" John mutters beside me. He is looking out at the roaring sea and the impossibly darker clouds on the horizon. Lightning can be seen striking every so often.
have to wear a tie?”
“Number six is Angelos, that one should speak for itself as well.” Sherlock looked to John as if he asked a question, but said it like a statement.
“I didn't say anything.” John stated.
“So you admit it!” Harry was pulled out of her daze and smirked at John.
The only person John has ever come out to is Harry, and thankfully she didn’t pressure him into telling anyone else (specifically their parents) for obvious reasons.
I can't fight the grin finding its way to my lips. "Such romantic declarations at a time like this? Surely you must be
John sighed and rolled his eyes. “I think you’re amazing and wonderful and intelligent and probably the greatest man I have ever met. Even as a child, I knew you were everything and more that a person could ever hope to be.”
“Yes that is what I said.”
"Obviously. Would I be here if not?" I gave him a glare.
The abrupt question catches me off guard, and I study John to find his angle. He is too inquisitive about my life and I know better than to think this question isn't leading somewhere.
"I'll answer your question when you answer mine." I shot at him. I had to crane my neck down to meet his eyes.
John nodded and made his way to the farmhouse, trying very hard to forget his train of thought, and thanking the heavens that Sherlock cannot read minds.
Sitting down in Language Arts, John found everyone ‘modestly’ moving a bit further away from John, including Sarah which surprised him most of all. This is not good.
It was Junior year when John officially met Sherlock. He would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous as hell. It was Chemistry class, of all things. And he was assigned a seat next to his now lab partner Sherlock Holmes. John swallowed hard as the teacher informed them to introduce themselves and get to know their partner as seeing they will be with them for the rest of the year.
They had lunch and John was thankful to see Sherlock eat everything on his plate. Afterwards, the two of them decided to walk back to the flat. They were standing at the crosswalk, waiting for the okay to cross when the indescribable happened.
“Well your boyfriend looks plastered.” Greg stated, apparently hearing John.
“I’m his husband.” John spoke smoothly and without a second thought.
John scoffed and looked to Sherlock for help, and good god did he wish he knew better.
"I'm pulling you from one prison to another, both with very likely chances of death."
“I can guarantee this wont be anything like your encounter with my family.” Sherlock deadpanned.
." I say the words with such distaste that I feel it reflect on my facial expression.
Yes people go through this, and yes it would happen to him if he were gay. Though he most certainly is not gay. It is so wrong and intimidating that John actually understands why people are in the closet. Why Harry hid for so long, though their parents didn't seem to care all that much to Harrys preferences, they were supportive all the way through.
Mycroft and his crew were setting sail by the time I found a ship of my own. It's smaller but still large enough to need a crew. I'll make it work.
Sherlock knocked loudly and incessantly for a full ten seconds before John had to place a hand on his wrist and make him stop.
John nodded and smiled awkwardly, moving from the grand room to the large corridor, “Goodnight Sherlock.” He said softly.
He handed the release form back, and the Doctor left.
The nurse looked confused. “Oh, the man that was here earlier said he didn't have any other family-”
“That’s enough, Mycroft. That is all a lie and you know it.” Their mother gasps in shock but John is pretty well convinced it’s an act.
His father smiled gently. “That partner of yours treating you right, then?” He questioned suddenly in defense, but without malice. That’s strange.
Valentines Day came, and just to Johns luck, the deliveries were made in his Chemistry class and he got a front row view of the people coming and going with nothing sent in Sherlocks direction. The confusion on Sherlocks face was sincere and rather dismayed. When the two women left, the forlorn expression on Sherlocks face nearly broke John. How could he have done this to him? It was a routine, a habit, a tradition; John needs to fix this. He can’t believe how stupid he has been, one bad conversation and John let it get the best of him. This is how Sherlock is, he knew it and even expected it. Yet here they are on Valentines Day and Sherlocks hands are empty.
The pub was getting more crowded and filled by the minute, men and women alike, all seemingly single and flirting with one another. This is usually the time when John would get up and mingle to see what woman he can court into sleeping with him, but he is not alone tonight so it doesn’t look like he will be getting very lucky in that department.
“I’d love that.” Sherlock said and the two of them went over to the counter, leaving John in the dining room staring off after them.
"Do you trust me?" I asked him, only just then realizing my repetition.
Without thinking, Sherlock grabbed Johns face in both hands and kissed him. John let out a surprised gasp that was cut-off on Sherlocks perfect pink lips, lips that John dreamed about. The two of them melted into it instantly, letting the kiss go from messy and hard to slow and gentle.
That really was fun.
“You’re with him?” The man questioned with a smidgen of disgust as he looked John up and down. John glared at him.
Sherlock frowned.
"We need a ship too."
I leaned back in my chair. "It won't be. I made a promise, and I plan to keep my word."
"Why does it offend you so much?"
“Why do
“I am positive of Lestrades words, but I am unconvinced he is correct. That man couldn't tell the difference between a-”
So, before Johns school-girl nerves could talk him out of it, he leaned up from his chair and kissed him.
“Opmh.” Someone groaned, just at the same time Sherlock was shoved forward, making him stumble, though not losing his balance and somehow remaining perfectly graceful.
"Good enough." I said and started across to the docks, John following closely behind.
“Enough with the work talk.” Frederick states irritably.
It all started with Mycroft, the bastard! John swears he lives and breathes to antagonize his brother and everyone around him. AKA, John himself.
“Irrelevant. I just thought mummy and daddy would want to meet the man their son has moved in with and taken a liking-”
“Your struggle, obviously. And I can only understand your mindset in that case. Mycroft is my brother after all, however it is quite clear I'm not that fat.”
John wasn't sure where to go, where does one go when you can’t go to lunch?
My own brother outsmarted me. I don't know if I should be more impressed or annoyed. I take a deep breath and speak. "You sure you want to be taking me? My brother just left with about fifteen or so of your people as prisoners."
“And why would I do such a thing?” He asked smugly.
Two minutes and thirty-nine seconds later, John grew impatient and began shifting his shoulder uncomfortably. Two minutes and forty-four seconds, my plan is ready.
I roll my eyes at his juvenile idea, but sit up in my place anyway, curiosity always got the best of me. "Alright, John. Dazzle me with something from your past." It was meant to come out sarcastic but ended up sounding the opposite.
John looks away with his cheeks tinted pink, and a deep frown at his brows like he is trying to figure something out.
“We are never leaving the flat again!” Sherlock exclaimed dramatically and flopped onto the couch. John sat in his usual chair and looked at Sherlock who appeared as if he were physically violated. John couldn’t help the chuckle that was forcing its way up his throat. Sherlock looked at him and after a moment, he was chuckling too, and soon enough they both burst into uncontrollable laughter.
John wanted to spit out a witty retort but came up short. There is no arguing with Sherlock—well, there is no
John found himself in the cafeteria at the Valentines stand, he is late meeting Sherlock but he needs to get this ready and sent to him. Except this time, John wasn't sure what to say. Before it was always so easy, now it is suddenly the most difficult thing John has ever had to do. He knows Sherlock now, so this shouldn't be so hard, yet he can’t find anything to say. And how should he say it?
I looked at him confused. What could he possibly be going on abo- Oh, my plan. "It looked more realistic if you were caught off guard," I said and kept my eyes on the open sea before me. My, I have spent far too long on bloody land.
“We’re not together.” John stated bluntly. He knows that Mycroft is only trying to work him up and frankly it’s working. “And we’re not actually fighting either, not that it is any of your concern.”
“I wasn't lying you know.” John started hesitantly.
“Well, yes. But you never visit when Sherlock is in the hospital.”
“I know. Do you take me as stupid?” Sherlock questioned with annoyance and John paused before responding, he should've known Sherlock would be like this in person. Now he just needs to find a way to get that smile on his face the way those Valentine cards seemed to. “Just the opposite. I think you're brilliant.” John said.
The next day went just as John had predicted. Passing in the halls people would stare and whisper and the second John looked over they all turned away with guilty expressions.
“You said we were married.” Sherlock stated, voice raspy. John got up quickly and poured him some water.
John peaked up and watched Sherlock pout to himself with the card still in hand.
“You’re avoiding the subject.” He shot back.
“Why?”
"Lead the way." John said looking at me expectantly. The moon is giving enough light to see the curves and contours of his soft face. His blue eyes shined even bluer in the little light there is.
“We’re not a couple.”
“Even a genius can be wrong sometimes.” John said in the thick silence between them.
John stopped instantly at the words for two reasons. One, he has nothing to be sorry for and two, Sherlock never apologizes, so something must really be nagging at him.
That is, until one day Sherlock turns up at the library with a bruise on his jaw and cut on his cheek.
"Are we really going to sail in this?"
At either head of the table was a man and a woman, Siger and Violet Holmes John assumes, and by god if the house wasn't intimidating enough, looking at the owners was a whole new level of posh. The woman wore white pearls and her dark greying hair is pulled back into curls behind her head. Her clothing is golden and elegant, John could've easily mistaken her for someone very close with the Queen. With where Mycroft stands in his career, that wouldn't be too surprising actually.
Our food arrived then, putting the conversation on pause. A plate of Cajun pasta in front of John, and a smaller plate of salmon for me.
“Sherlock.” John nearly yelled and then Sherlock was rambling.
John met my cold gaze. "Because pirate or not I know you're not a completely useless asshole the rest of the world thinks you are."
So come Valentines Day on their last year of high school, John got a bit nervous. He needs to reveal that he is Sherlocks admirer. Will he be disappointed? Happy? Angry? Utterly indifferent? He is finally going to find out.
“Playing hard to get, I understand.” The man walked up to stand next to Sherlock and positioned himself partially in front of him so he could see his face. The man bit his lip seductively.
“So I’m right to assume you will be taking him home?”
John sighed, and absently took Sherlocks hand, squeezing it. Little did he expect Sherlock to squeeze back. John looked to his face immediately and found big blue eyes on him.
“Sherlock he is not-”
Lestrade stared at me with contemplating eyes, but I know before he decides what his choice will be. "I'll gather up a crew," he sighs. "But Sherlock if this is another wild chase-"
"You what?" My eyes narrowed at the suddenly small man before me.
“Well you certainly took your time.” Sherlock stated in annoyance and pushed off the tree trunk.
"Let me light the candle for the table, it's more romantic." With that, Angelo scurries off for a match. John shook out of his thoughts and stares with his mouth hanging agape after Angelo.
I woke with a start at the sound of my name. I half expected to be pulled to my feet and forced down the corridor like the last time I was to be hanged. But this time, something is different. The small window to my cell is not shining any light like before. If I was being sent to the gallows there would at least be a bit of sunshine. So no, that is not what is happening here, I say it's still night and given the weight of my exhaustion, I say it's about three in the morning.
“Right,” John began, “Number ten?”
Sherlock stared up at John, skin deathly pale, lips red with blood. John felt it difficult to look at, he concentrated on his blood filled hands and keeping the pressure on the wound.
“Maybe,” John began, suddenly sure of his words. “I never minded at all. Maybe I wasn't ready to admit it.”
John had a large amount of respect for his sister doing what she did. Even without knowing how his parents would react to this news, John would never be able to work up the nerve to tell his almost-always-absent and very old-fashioned parents that he is homosexual. So instead he told Harry and soon after, John left for the army. Harry completely understood why he would want to go but his parents thought it was ‘absurd’ and never spoke of the matter again. They didn’t see him off for his deployment.
Yes, John is glad he didn't sign his name, even with the slight chance of a good outcome.
Every day he would receive a letter, starting the morning after Sherlock left.
“Why would you tell them we’re married?” Sherlock asked him. “You loathe when anyone thinks you're gay.”
John shook his head. Sherlock is right, he is thinking and far too much, especially on this subject. Nobody is going to see him here, everyone is at lunch.
John smiled softly and nodded his head once.
in a Myth Busters themed card. John smiled softly to himself, that seems exactly like something Sherlock would buy.
Ignoring all of this because I definitely was
"I thought we had all of the islands from England to Australia—"
It’s not so formal to need a full tux or suit, but something more along the lines of Sherlock’s clothing on a daily basis. The pants are a sleek black and the shirt is a shade of dark blue, the tie hanging over the shirt is a smooth black. When John glances at the floor, he sees shining black shoes and thin black socks to match.
I huff out a sigh and cross my arms. "I'm sure I could deduce everything I need to know."
"Yes. Because John it is a dangerous world out there and we are only two men. We will only have each other if things go wrong. Trust me and I'll do the same."
They took a cab to the outskirts of the city. The further they drove, the more expensive the homes; and the more anxious Sherlock seemed to become. He didn’t stop shaking his leg, and as they turned a corner, he started biting at his finger nails. John, becoming increasingly annoyed with him, as well as his own emotions for suddenly feeling a bit fond over the man beside him, placed a hand on Sherlock’s knee to make it stop shaking. At the contact, it stopped and Sherlock looked at the hand and then at John.
Sherlock glared at the door. “The truck to the right of the house is still here. There is only one set of truck prints in the mud, and the most recent prints were made coming in to the farm, not leaving it. Obviously.”
“I wondered how he knew how you took your tea. He would delete that bit of information for most people, especially ones that had been out of the picture for so long.”
John mumbles something along the lines of “it was no problem” and dozes off in his chair. Mycroft continues down the hall to check in on the patient.
John considers this for a moment. “She’s going to need a few hours rest to clear her head.  I’ll need the lab results back from Molly before I can say too much more. But she should be fine.”
“Katherine’s father died when she was 11.  Her mother had trouble coping, which was the real reason they came to England. She was smart, not like me, but not like the others either. She was also incredibly perceptive. She had a way with words, both their usage and her ability to understand the hidden meanings in those used by others. I would not be at all surprised to find that she’d ended up a linguist. She’d be quite skilled at that. She could always see right through what everyone said, and the other children didn’t like being read that way, any more than they liked my observations and deductions. It made sense that the two children that no one else wanted to be friends with would end up as such.”  He paused, but didn’t yet turn away from the window. John could tell that Sherlock was still busy deducing his friend’s sudden arrival after such a long absence.
Sherlock can see that she will not be going any further with her explanation.  He looks up at John entering the room, medical kit in hand, ready to check on his patient.  He gets up from his chair, and goes over to where his violin rests in its case.  As John sits with Katherine, examining her and asking the questions that he could not the night before, Sherlock softly plays a song that he remembers as one of her favorites.  He hopes that it will make up for his probing questions.  He shouldn’t have pressed the issue, but he has a tendency to get carried away when presented with a mystery. He clears his mind of all but the music and Katherine’s current situation.
Sherlock is a bit surprised by her response, but also relieved. He sighs and sits back.
“No, no. I’ll be fine. I’ll just relax on the couch, maybe watch some telly, read a book.”
“Katherine, I need you to lie still and try to stay calm.  Sherlock, pressure.  Katherine, how far along were you?”
Mycroft looks up from his phone. “You’re sure?”
“Wow. I’m so thin there! I don’t remember being that thin - ever! And look at your hair. So short. So tidy.” At this, John jumps up and rushes over to look at something he never thought he’d see - pictures of Sherlock as a teenager.
Sherlock wraps his scarf around his neck, and the two brothers make their way down the stairs, to Baker Street.
He is still playing when Mycroft arrives an hour later.  Katherine is still in the chair, and John is fussing in the kitchen, putting together a light breakfast for his patient.  Mrs. Hudson has been up to see if they need anything from the shops, and John’s sent her off with a list.  It is at the site of his older brother in the doorway that Katherine’s explanation for her tears finally makes sense.
“Put the bloody phone down! Pay attention!” John sounds frustrated, but the smile hasn’t left his face. When Sherlock mumbles something along the lines of “Won’t be but a moment, John,” he grabs the phone from Sherlock’s hands and throws it down the hall.
“Ricardo was an art historian, with a background in architecture. He was in Barcelona working on a book about Gaudi and his inspirations. He was concentrating on the story of the man than of his work, and he often spent his days wandering the city, searching for new bits of information or trying to imagine how it was back then. We were very happy together, especially when we found out I was pregnant. It wasn’t planned, but it was an especially delightful surprise.”  She stops. The expression that crosses her face is a mixture of sadness and confusion. She takes a deep breath before continuing.
John reaches up to pull the bit of marshmallow from behind his ear. “You’re right. As usual.”
John smiles weakly. “I’m sure you did. Thank you.”
“I can understand how neither of them got on with anyone else, but, and I mean this in the kindest way imaginable, you seem fairly normal.”  Johns smiles at her over his mug.
“That I’m right here? Well, you should feel honored, really.”
John looks back and forth between the picture and the man standing before him. “The longer length suits you. You look resentful in the photo.”
“Katherine, Sherlock and I are going to leave you in the capable hands of Dr. Watson for short while. We’re going to the office for a bit, pull a few strings, as it were. We will see if we can’t find out what happened to your husband.”
John met Sherlock’s gaze as he came back in the room, carrying the tea.  “Right. We’ll just have a cuppa, and then I’ll have to insist that you go back to bed, Katherine. You need your rest.”
“Mother was quite insistent that it be kept that way. She is quite disapproving of the current length.”
“He will be here as soon as he can. He had a few things to attend to.”  Sherlock sits down on the edge of his chair, looking across at his friend and thinking back to the last time they saw each other.
His hair has thinned, and he is leaner than he used to be. His face has lost the roundness that it once had.  He seems more serious than he once did.  She can still make out the freckles across the bridge of his nose, though. And she bets that his rare smile would thrill her just the way it had before.
“She came in from Folkestone.”
“Who spoke with Ms. Renier?” Mycroft asks.
“You think that she flew from America into London 3 weeks ago, when she was more than 7 months pregnant? I wouldn’t recommend such a long journey that far along in the pregnancy.  Most airlines wouldn’t have been comfortable with it either, though I supposed its possible.  Do we even know for sure that she came straight from America? Or even what her name is now?”
“It’s hard to say.  Eight months is early, but not so early that there are any major concerns. It will depend on whether or not the child was injured during the accident or the delivery. The are no obvious signs that it was, but I have no way of knowing. I’d say that odds are good that it’s still alive. But where is it?”  John tries hard to keep the desperation from his voice, but he can’t escape the memory of the case they had just finished. His stomach turns at the thought of another dead child, this one gone before it had even had a chance to live.
“You must have meant to tell me more formally, but,
"The Crown."
John’s mind spins.
He’s not picked up Rosie from daycare before, but John’s been waylaid at the surgery and had run out of options. John had apologised profusely (unnecessarily) for “burdening” Sherlock with the task, even though Sherlock doesn’t mind, not at all. But Sherlock doesn’t know how Rosie will react to the change of routine. Her life had already been upended to the nth degree when she and John moved from Chelmsford to London; Sherlock would hate to add insult to injury. And while Rosie is comfortable with him, he’s not acted in a guardian capacity before. It could be a smidge discombobulating.
Sherlock looks at John askance.
A conversation he’d had long ago resurfaces.
He locks John’s mobile and places it atop the sidetable on his flank of the bed, next to his own mobile, which is lighting up with reams of texts from
But then John drops a lit match to all of Sherlock’s paper-thin conclusions, setting them aflame with the words, “It’s kind of the point.”
“Do you?” I said with some surprise.
John could kiss Sherlock and tell him without words everything he wants to say. What he's always wanted to say; what he had planned to say on this holiday.
“You’re shielding her from the reality that destructive actions can have devastating consequences.”
“I’m sorry, are we meant to be in each other’s laps at all times?”
realised that I’m not a complete numpty? After nearly a decade?”
Her arse is ridiculously cushiony and John is getting a bit too
“Seven, in fact,” Sherlock agrees.
As the song starts to die down, Mary meets Greg’s eye and does a panto of sipping a cup, then jabs a finger over Greg’s shoulder. Greg nods enthusiastically, and they head off toward the bar without a word.
,” Sherlock practically moans. “That’s good.”
why the credit card statements listed nonexistent vendors; the club’s been covering up her crimes because they cut a deal with her. They’re getting a piece of the pie.”
“Hi there, Rosie.” Hafiz puts a hand on his hip and leans over, speaking in the fake, jovial tone adults often use with children, “What a pretty name for a pretty girl.”
Greg considers this, looking deeply serious. “A garroting into a beheading, I’d say.”
Sherlock’s lips curl. “Saying it once a year won’t kill me.”
Sherlock puckers his lips ever-so-slightly, a tease. John attempts to close the distance, but Sherlock pulls back at the last moment.
But, then again, he does so hate to disappoint Mummy, and she had seemed inordinately uplifted by the idea of his and John’s entanglement.
“Are you being deliberately stupid to spite me?”
Mycroft pushes the envelope away. “What possible use would
Unfortunately, the RA had become worse in the first few months I had moved into the villa; I had been tending to him carefully but it had amounted to nothing.
And just like that, the frog transformation is complete.
“I suppose if we were to choose just one of the many cultural interpretations of mistletoe,” Mycroft begins, a blessed interruption of the charged silence that’d fallen, “the most apropos one for the good doctor and myself would be the Roman interpretation, which is that of peace. Enemies of war met and reconciled under mistletoe. Though, I am rather certain that this reconciliation was not accomplished with a…,” he wrinkles his nose in disgust, vomits more than says the word, “kiss.”
“Sherlock,” I growled. “Fuck me.”
“I wanted to ask--and take as much time as you need to think about it, yeah? My lease is up next month, and Chelmsford is. Well. Not London. I know I’m here a lot anyway. And I know we have cases. I just don’t--” John looks down at the floor, in the space between them, his brows furrowed. “I don’t want to be reminded of Mary anymore.” He looks up, attention fixed on something over Sherlock’s shoulder. “I know it sounds horrible. I know I should want to preserve her memory for Rosie. But it’s driving me round the twist to just
, John. The passenger seat, if you please.”
“Vi,” Dad says helplessly, hurrying after her.
. He has it, has
Sherlock gives him a withering look. “Don’t insult me. It was 15.”
But it became clear to them that something was afoot.
Lestrade and Molly look at each other. “Well.” Lestrade slings an arm around her shoulders, and looks back to Sherlock with a glint in his eye. “We have dinner.”
Rosie starts, “What is Daddy--”
Sherlock’s smile falls completely as he side-steps, slithering out of John's touch.
Before John can finish his question, Sherlock slips his mouth over John’s cock, wrapping a fist around John’s shaft and working hand and mouth in tandem.
Nothing else matters but this.
need to say it aloud? “I haven’t any data to compare against.”
here?” John accuses, annoyed that Mary hadn’t come to check up on him, even if he hadn’t wanted her to. It’s the principle of the thing. But Greg looks hurt by John’s snappish attitude (wrongly directed at Greg), so John stumbles over himself to say, ”Fuck. Sorry. Don’t worry about me, mate, go back inside and enjoy yourself.”
“Is that what this whole thing is about?” Sherlock nearly yells. “Another one of your schemes to cause more problems in this family, Mycroft?”
"I've heard the stories. I know what you did and what you do now. I know that you would never hurt those who don't deserve it. I know that you care about your brother even if he can be a real ass and I know the real reason why you risked your life to come to this town." John paused and stared at me, waiting for my reaction. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to react. Sure, when it comes to the Navy they are to know the stories about infamous pirates like me but he couldn't know about mine and Mycrofts relationship and there is no way he could know why I came here.
John looks down at his menu and I barely hear him mumble,
"Sherlock?" John follows me, his refusal to drop the topic is clear but irrelevant to me. Instead, I favor observing my surroundings.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Don't bother me with semantics John, the point is you did not pull away or let go until we were back at Baker street.”
John took his seat opposite Harry and Sherlock beside him on the left. His mother sat at one head of the table, and his father took the other, between Clara and Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson is a very sweet, older lady. If John hadn’t known any better, he would’ve assumed that Mrs. Hudson is Sherlock’s grandmother; she reacted as such when they came to the door. But John did know better. Sherlock explained how he met her and guaranteed her husbands execution. John was impressed, in a sick kind of way.
Then John met Sherlock Holmes. The world’s only consulting detective and, as the man claims, a high-functioning sociopath. The man drives John insane, in good ways and bad; and he is an easy distraction, John was even able to move past his psychosomatic limp because of him.
However nothing happened.
“And what if he has?” Sherlock speaks for the first time since John has stepped in-between them. Mycroft holds up his hands in defense. “I’m not stopping you Sherlock. Just remember that he is not the same kind as you are. Not everyone will be pleased with that.” Sherlock shrugs and walks out of the room. John wants to follow him but got stopped by Mycroft calling his name. Mycroft hands him a piece of paper and a pen to write down his number.
“Did you tell him anything?” Sherlock asks and John looks up surprised.
Sherlock is quiet. It is clear he hadn’t thought much about what he would do after he got out. “You can stay with me if you want.” John then says and Sherlock looks towards him. “I don’t have much, but it’ll do. I got a bathtub and running water you can use.” Sherlock clearly hesitates then eventually walks back towards John.
Sherlock stands up. “You seriously want to let him get away with it?"
John makes himself a cup of tea and grabs some aspirins. This must have happened because of the rain yesterday. He takes the aspirins with some water and walks to the living room, sitting down in his chair. He groans as he rubs his hand over his head. This headache was awful. He can feel it pound through his whole head. He sighs and grabs his tea. He should just take it easy today.
He looks down at the money he has so far. Three pound and twenty pence. It’s just enough for a bloody sandwich. He sighs and puts his head in his hands. This will be a long winter. When he looks up again a guy was standing in front of him, with a smile on his face.
Since it is a Sunday there are no shows. The park is closed and there are just a few people around to take care of the animals. When the evening falls and John and Greg had prepare the fish for the next day together (and put it in the fridge this time) and they are making themselves ready to go home.
“That’s Kevin’s.” John says and the boy roles his eyes. “Yes, thank for stating the obvious. Now could you please hand it over?” John hesitates at first but then grabs the laptop and hands it over to the boy. “Here you go.” John says. “I’m John by the way."
“What did you do to me?” John whispers as Sherlock starts to smile.
Greg sighs. “You forgot to put the fish in the fridge man. It has all gone bad now.”
Neither of the boys paid attention to the sea anymore. So they didn’t notice the big wave making his way over to them. It took them both by surprise and Jim, who was still kneeling down, grabbed the rocks and closed his eyes tight. It was only a matter of seconds before the water was gone again, leaving Jim wet, cold and all alone.
“You want something to drink?” John asks. Sherlock shakes his head and looks at him. “I just want to talk and get this over with.” John nods and sits down next to the boy.
John also puts his cup down in the fear that he might drop it. “You want to go back to the man who held you locked up?!” John says, his voice louder then he intends. Sherlock simply nods and John pinches the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock, I don’t think this is a good idea. Not only could he fire me for stealing and lying about it, he could also take you back!”
“My mom and Thomas are sleeping so we have to be quiet.” John says and Sherlock nods before making his way to the living room.
Sherlock’s shoulder isn't in a bad condition but he needs to take it easy. John feels relieved and they make their way back home. Sherlock still has the man's phone and starts calling his brother. John looks out of the window while the Sherlock speaks to his brother in a, surprisingly, calm voice. He doesn’t really pay attention.
When he comes back with a bottle of lube, some condoms and a cloth he freezes in the doorframe. Sherlock is still laying where he left him, but he’s slowly palming his erection while looking at the fire. It is an amazing sight that sends electric shocks through John’s whole body. Sherlock’s skin was almost lighting up, a faint blush paints across his cheeks and his mouth is just slightly open.
“Then it will be even more cosy~” Sherlock tries again. John tries to think of another excuse when Thomas suddenly appears in the doorway. John walks up to the little boy who’s rubbing his eyes in a sleepy motion. “Did we wake you?” John asks while he picks him up and the boy nods. “I’m sorry. Sherlock and I were just about to sleep.”
John blinks a couple of time. “Excuse me. I’m not going anywhere without Sherlock.”
John finishes his task and washes his hands. He walks through the main room towards the exit and his eye fall on the door once again. John stops in his tracks. He stares at the door for a while before he looks around. Everyone is already heading home. He is all alone.
“The manager’s office. He got something I need.”
After dinner they walk around the city some more. Sherlock seems to enjoy getting to know the streets of London. John lets him lead the way and they walk past places even John has never seen before. Sherlock stops in front of a pet store and looks at the fish swimming around in circles in the aquariums. He mumbles something about people being stupid for keeping such creatures in captivity. John takes his hand to Sherlock surprise and smiles. Sherlock doesn’t pull away and they walk home like this. When they walk inside Sherlock strips himself off his coat and shoes and makes way to the bathroom to fill the bath with water. John places the groceries, he has picked up on the way home, away and also makes his way too the bathroom. Sherlock is in just his pants, testing the water temperature and adjusting it slightly.
“Well of course he changed his password if he doesn’t want others to use his laptop.” John says and Sherlock just continues typing. It took Sherlock just two minutes before he smiles and says “Got it.” John looks at him impressed but the boy’s too busy typing to notice. John grabs the newspaper on the table and starts reading. It stays quiet for a while till Sherlock starts groaning again and John sees him picking up his phone and calling someone.
