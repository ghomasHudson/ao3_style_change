“He isn’t?”
“No,” the ghosts said in unison, the very rare feeling they recognized as guilt started to sneak up on them.
Abaddon sighed and got into position for the circle, Meg followed suit. They linked arms and circled gently while Ruby listed off soothing thoughts.
Dean gave a smile, still reveling over his victory the night before, “Fellas,” he greeted, “good morning.”
Eye of the Tiger was blaring from a black 1967 chevy impala as it sped up the interstate. Claire rolled her eyes at her father, who drummed his hands on the steering wheel, singing his heart out. They were on the road once again, heading to who-knows-where. She had literally been in school for a week, and now they had to leave again. She loved her dad, but this was just an awful way for a kid to grow up. Claire finally couldn’t take the noise anymore and reached over to turn off the music, ejecting the cassette tape, yes, her dad had cassette tapes, and tossed it in the shoe box with the rest of his collection.
“We have company!”
Dean blindly felt above his head, thankfully finding a hanging Edison light. The dim bulb revealed that, sure enough, they were standing in a coat closet. He looked down at Claire and grabbed her by her upper arms, “Now, I want you to stay in here, no matter what you hear. Do you understand me?” he waited until she nodded before shutting the light off once again and rushing out of the closet.
Dean slammed the door to his bedroom. He threw off his jacket and collapsed onto his bed. He grabbed a pillow and held it to his chest, “Cas, you’re so soft. I just wanna—"
Gabriel looked at the small mill. He grabbed onto the planks and started to climb. Fortunately, there was a small window on the second story, just close enough for him to climb into the cottage.
“Crowley, I have huffed and puffed, and no I wanna rip this place down. I want my treasure. They can’t haunt a pile of rubble for Christ’s sake!”
“Thank you,” the trio said in unison as they continued to enjoy their breakfast.
“Hey,” he objected, teasingly, “Cinderella got until midnight.”
“I’m getting nauseous!”
“A Rockstar,” Dean said, unhappily.
Al hit the bag of candy he had been munching on out of his friend’s hands, “That’s cause you’ve been eating so much candy, you oinker!”
Alex nodded, and began fiddling with the ends of her long, dark hair, “Listen, if you don’t have any other plans, do you wanna hang out with me at the party? I think it would be fun, and I really wanna get to know you.”
“Come little children, I’ll take thee away
“What has thou done with my son, Gabriel!?” he asked, furiously, begging for his son to be alive.
“Nothin’” Gabriel said as he looked at the other two, “He’s just a little…dead.”
Jack could hear his sister and father screaming from the other side of the door, but he couldn’t bring himself to go near it. Huge black spiders crawled through the cracks in the wall, and had covered the door, “Dad, there’re spiders everywhere, and I don’t have a magazine!”
Deciding not to think about that, she set about unpacking a bit more. The first thing she did was unroll her sleeping bag out on the bed. She didn’t want to sleep in it until they had a chance to wash the sheets. She could speak from experience, there was nothing worse than dusty sheets. Besides, you never knew what types of critters liked to take up residence in them. And judging by the sheer number of cobwebs that covered the place, there were probably a fair number of spiders living in this bed.
A strange, glowing light filled the dark room. Jack looked on in shock as a man with large, black wings appeared before him, holding the missing ball out in his hand, “You’re…” he couldn’t believe it.
“Scrod, you know it’s a bottom dweller, you can eat it with little breadcrumbs—” Abaddon cut her off with a slap to the head. They walked back to the street.
“She’s done for,” Balthazar said, terrified for the fate of the young girl. Gabriel wouldn’t hear it.
Dean’s nose wrinkled at Crowley’s rancid breath, “Maybe you could learn to breath threw your nose.”
“What a little boy. And he’s so well fed, isn’t he? Nice and plump,” Sam couldn’t stop himself from screaming as Ruby kept pinching his sides, testing his body fat, “We could have shish-ca-baby.”
The boys ran through the cemetery and Gabriel led them to the entrance of an old crypt.
Dean pressed a gentle kiss to his mouth, “I thought I’d lost you,” he said as he helped his husband to his feet. Lucifer walked up to him.
“I want you to meet the little woman,” he whispered when they entered the house.
When Claire and Jack made their way back to the lab, they saw Crowley using a crowbar and attempting to pry the padlock off the treasure chest.
“Let me go!” Cas cried, tearing his hands away. He ran away from the spirits and away from the lunatic calling after him.
Abaddon laughed, flustered, “Well…we desire…children.”
Castiel’s hands were shaking as he took the goblet. He never got the chance to say goodbye to his children. The last conversation he had with his husband had been a meaningless fight, and now…he was going to die.
“I can’t croak him now!” Lucifer exclaimed throwing his harpoon behind him until it landed with a ‘boing’ in the far wall.
Cas, thinking he was joking, laughed, and said, “No thanks.”
“Wench! Trollop! You hideous, murderous, firefly from Hell!” Abaddon screamed, enraged. Cain whispered to Dean, “I’ve waited centuries to say that.”
“Dad!” Claire practically leaped into her father’s arms, “Dad! I saw a ghost! It was a real ghost. A real live dead ghost!”
The cat scoffed and slipped through the gate, “Follow me!” they followed the cat past the creaking gate into the old cemetery, “Come here, I want to show you something,” he called, “Give you an idea of exactly what we’re dealing with.”
“Sisters, look,” Ruby said, looking down at the candy bar, “Tis the chocolate covered finger of a man named Clark,” she took a bite, “Eugh! It’s candy! Why would the master give us candy?”
He laughed at himself over how jumpy he was being, and turned back to the mirror, only to receive the fright of his life! His skin was rotted, and his teeth were falling out! He had one eye hanging from its socket, and a rope around his neck!
Claire looked at the three levers next to her, “Which one?”
A knowing smile was his only response, and she just held him even tighter, thrilled over being able to finally hug her friend. The two were so lost in each other, they didn’t notice the other students stop dancing in favor of staring in shock at the floating pair.
Jack looked at it, before dismissing it, “That? Nah. That’s just the vault.”
“So, why don’t you tell us something special about yourself, Claire?” Mr. Lafitte asked after a few seconds of her not saying anything.
Dean chased after him and found him sitting in a small jack o’lantern patch someone had as a decoration. Dean felt terrible when he saw that Sam had taken off his mask to dry his tears. He sat down next to him and said, “Sammy, I’m sorry. It’s just that I hate this place! I miss all my friends and I wanna go home! But I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
“They can’t touch us here, right?” Dean asked for confirmation.
“Have you ever seen a fireplace this amazing? It’s incredible.”
Sam’s eyes widened in panic, “Hide! Hide!” he said, ushering the kids behind some large items. Because he knew the two of them had no business being in the attic, he bent down, and pulled Gabriel into a kiss. They’d had plans to marry before everything had happened, so it would surprise nobody if they were in the attic for a rendezvous. Gabriel stood up on his tip toes and had just wrapped his arms around Sam when they were interrupted by the sound of someone clearing their throat. The two men jumped apart as if they hadn’t been expecting it.
She walked over to it, and stared at herself as she tied the long sash of the dress in a big bow behind her back. Jack’s mom had obviously been a very tiny woman, so it fit rather comfortably on her twelve-year old body. The dress was incredibly stunning, and Claire had never felt prettier. It went all the way down to the floor, until it pooled in a pile of white lace around her feet. It was practically an antique. Possibly even from the early 1900’s. Claire had never worn anything like it before, “Oh, Jack, it’s perfect,” she said, very gratefully, “You think I could wear it to the party, tonight?” Jack didn’t answer, “Jack?” she looked away from the mirror and glanced around the attic, confused by the lack of response.
“Whatever,” she said, walking out of the room.
Jack stared at her, just for a moment before answering, “No. He’d never forget about you,” and he believed it. Claire was special. The type of person who would stay in your heart long after you parted. If you were lucky enough to know her and love her, your heart wouldn’t let you forget her, “Claire,” she sleepily hummed in acknowledgement, “If I were alive, would you go to the Halloween dance with me?”
Claire took over, understanding where Jack was heading, “You know, unfinished business. All ghosts have unfinished business. It’s why they don’t cross over.”
Dean allowed himself to breathe when he heard Jack scream, “Papa!” he turned around to see Castiel collapsed on the floor, with Jack and Claire hovering over his prone body, “Papa, are you all right!?”
Claire’s eyes widened and she jumped off the ghost. She ran down the hall, calling out for her dad. She found her way to the staircase, opposite of the one she had originally used and tore down them into the foyer. Claire couldn’t believe her eyes.
She waited for a few moments, before the trunk’s lid opened, and Jack floated out, holding a long, elegant white lace dress in his transparent hands, “Check it out. He floated high above her head, “Hands up, Claire,” he waited until she did so before carefully dropping the dress over her head, until she emerged out the other side.
“Don’t wanna be late,” Gabriel mimicked in a singsong voice.
Meanwhile, the ghostly trio were not having a good time.
“Catch those children!” Abaddon commanded, “Get up! Get up, get out of that ditch!”
“Not in practice, but I’ve studied it and spoken to people who have done it. I’ve seen videos and I feel very confident in my knowledge. It’s no problem.”
They had looked at house after house, and Garth had found something wrong with each one, “Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, that place I showed you over on Sycamore Street was loaded with plugs.”
“Honey, wait. Now maybe—”
“No,” Gabriel said, giving him a whack in the head, “I think it’s time we gave the doc our own prescription.
A tear began to roll down his cheek, but he angrily batted it away. People who put their families in danger didn’t deserve to cry. This was all his fault. His children were probably hurt, and definitely scared, and his angel was about to die. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the watch he had given to Castiel on their anniversary. He had actually put a lot of thought into picking it out and had been excited to see it on him. Now, he would never see it again. He didn’t want the last conversation he had with the man he loved to be a stupid fight.
Mary blinked, “How much candy have you had, honey?” she asked.
Claire shook her head, frantically, “No! No! No! This,” she wrapped her pinky around her third finger, reminding him of their sacred promise. Dean looked down at their conjoined pinky’s in horror, finally realizing that he had left his daughter all alone. Breaking, not only his promise to her, but his promise to Cas, that he would always take care of her.
“You got it!” Jack said, turning a sharp corner and heading straight towards another wall.
“Dean no!”
“Are you pre-approved?”
“His name was Michael!” another man, this one short, wearing an apron, and carrying a tray of cookies, “Are you kids hungry? Does anybody want a cookie?”
“Chungs?” Al whispered nervously.
The family stood in the doorway but didn’t enter. Nobody was there. The door seemed to have opened on its own. Dean shared a look with his husband, and hesitantly stepped inside, “Hello,” he called, “Is anybody home? Hello! It’s the Winchester’s, from Winchester’s Realties! Hi!” there was nobody. It was as if the house was abandoned. He shrugged and motioned his family inside. They could at least get out of the rain.
“If you find the children, bring them to me.”
“Don’t be like that Cas! I’m on a roll here! We’ve sold seven houses this month!”
“My name’s Alex,” she said, holding her hand out for a shake.
“I’m sorry.”
Cas grimaced, “Charming.”
Dean shrugged, “Well great, I’m in. Let’s get this key.”
The three human boys climbed out of the manhole and looked down at the remains of Gabe. A bus had come speeding down the street, and the cat hadn’t had enough time to get out of the way. He was completely flattened down the middle. Sam couldn’t help but cry at the sight. Cas held him close to his chest and kept him from looking at the remains.
Claire panicked for a second, turning to look in the foyer, hoping not to see any of the resident spooks. But there was Jack, floating harmlessly right behind her. And she knew that if the other three heard another living person come into the house, they wouldn’t hesitate to try to scare her, “Uh…no,” she stepped out onto the porch, pulling the heavy door shut behind her. She stepped just far enough forward that Alex had no choice but to turn and follow her, unless they wanted to talk back to back, “It’s so much nicer out here…out in the fles-FRESH air,” she awkwardly tried to explain away her rudeness, hoping she didn’t notice her little slip of the tongue. She turned back to her visitor and felt her eyes widening when she saw Jack’s head peeking through the woold door, obviously eavesdropping on her.
They hmm’d among themselves for a second. Should they, or shouldn’t they? They decided, as they usually do, that they should. Dean took their silence as refusal, “Didn’t think so,” he said, before turning his back on the ghosts. The three of them rushed around so they were facing him once more.
“It’s all my fault,” Dean said, guiltily.
Ruby was shocked and put her hand out, licking the water from her hand, “Most refreshing.”
Dean shared a look with Cas, something about this guy didn’t seem right, but what could they do. Dean went into real estate agent mode, “Hello, Roman. I’m Dean Winchester from Winchester’s realties. At your service,” he offered his hand, but Roman just looked at it as if he had been offered to hold a snake and didn’t take his gaze away from Castiel.
Claire rolled her eyes, “Goodnight dad.”
One student, who Claire was pretty sure was the same one to snore, eagerly leaned forward, “You actually live there?”
“Curses,” Abaddon sighed, walking away.
“Let’s just take the picture and get out of here,” Ben said, pulling out his phone. The picture easily showed the boys, but none of the mansion surrounding them. He sighed, and handed his phone to his friend while he went to stand where the moonlight was shining through one of the large picture windows.
“Cool,” Crowley said, “Let me try them on.” Dean just rolled his green eyes and kicked off his shoes. They finally let go of him and he rode on, his sock clad feet peddling faster than they had been. That’s the last time he’ll let someone stop him in a cemetery.
Dean gagged at the smell of rot, “Say what you want, just don’t breathe on me!”
A sock was thrown in his mouth. Claire had tossed a pair of socks over her shoulder and somehow managed to hit Jack right in the mouth. He spluttered for a minute and spit it out, accidentally hitting Claire in the back of the head.
They were interrupted from their musings by the bathroom door swinging open.
“Aye, matey. Buccaneers and buried gold. Hunters doth a treasure hold!”
And when the bell finally rang to dismiss the class, and everyone went tumbling to the floor, no one could explain how everyone’s shoelaces got tied together. Everyone that is, except for Claire.
“You’re Gabriel Novak!” Castiel realized.
“There,” his thirteen-year-old daughter, Claire said, handing him the magazine, “Happy?”
Claire was furious. That was why the machine hadn’t worked on Jack, “You stole that! That’s Jack’s!”
Cas bit his bottom lip, before placing his hand on Mr. Morgenstern’s arm and allowing him to lead him away, “Although it might be a bit worn and faded from its original glamor, this house was once filled with so many things…so much life! Grand parties, dancing, laughter! And above all, hope. Being a Morgenstern meant you were denied nothing. The world was yours.”
Ruby quickly threw a blanked over the body of the girl, “There be no witches here, sir!” she called threw the door, trying to sound helpless.
Abaddon set her focus on Sammy. She sent a bolt of electricity towards the eight-year-old, but, fortunately, a tree branch blocked her path. Cain glared at her as Sam screamed, “Go to Hell!” he shouted at her.
Crowley had only followed the car when he heard her fading screams. “Abaddon!” Crowley shouted, not expecting a response, “Are you a ghost yet!?” nothing, “What a tragic waste…she had my favorite sunglasses,” he shrugged it off, and turned to walk back to the manor. Guess he had no choice but to become a ghost. At least this way, the treasure would be all his.
He blushed and looked over at Sam and Gabe, “Poor Gabe.”
Cain gave a confused grunt before he realized where he was sitting. He turned around and noticed his headstone…that was inconvenient. He gave an annoyed grunt.
Before Dean could answer, there was a knock at the door. They shared a look, shocked. The knock wasn’t coming from the study door, but the front. Who would come to Hunters Manor for a social call? “I’ll get it,” Claire said, leaving the room.
“If you keep driving you’ll kill us all!”
“Especially not on Halloween.”
By the time the witches realized they had been tricked, the car was speeding away. “He’s tricked us again!” Abaddon said angrily.
Abaddon stared at the priest standing in front of them, “You do have experience in this sort of thing?”
Claire had found an old-fashioned pump, one that looked like what Miracle Max used in ‘The Princess Bride’ when Wesley was mostly dead, and shoved the end in Jacks mouth, using the air to get him back to his normal ghostly state.
“Why, your wedding of course.”
Lucifer, the proudly middle-sized specter raised a brow, “Well, sure on a scale of one to ten, with ten being fun, and one being Sam,” the tallest ghost grabbed the rest of the donut out of Gabriel’s ghostly hands, and threw it at Lucifer, who skillfully dodged the flung pastry, “Yeah, we had fun.”
“Well…they can’t…” Gabriel said.
“Guys, guys don’t fight!” a young boy’s voice called out as the phone was taken out of Jesse’s hands. The two friends looked on in horror as the phone was held in front of them, “I’ll take the picture! Say cheese.”
“Worse,” Jack replied, “It smells like grandma.”
“I think it’s for you, Doc,” Lucifer said, before both sets of cold hands pushed him to the doors.
The class groaned, but Henry raised his hand and jumped to his feet before Mr. Lafitte could say anything, “Well, as most of you know, my parents have finished the new boathouse. So, I’m sure it would be no problem having the party at my place,” he said with a winning smile. Despite his obvious impression that he was well liked, his solution to the problem was met with nothing more than a few awkward, unenthusiastic claps. Nevertheless, Henry’s smile widened and he bounced back to his seat as if he was being met with thunderous applause.
Cas gave a small smirk and held up a folded piece of paper, “Trick or treat,” he said, waiting for Dean to take it before walking away.
“That’s right,” Bess said, unable to keep the frustration out of her voice, “There were plenty.”
Jack couldn’t help it. He screamed back.
“Yes?”
“Jack…” Claire tried to object. She knew how much this meant to the little ghost. He couldn’t give up his only chance.
Crowley picked up the folder as Abaddon turned on him, “This is all your fault, as usual! If you had just forged the damn will!”
“Wow,” Dean exclaimed, “Nice, very nice. Hey, Claire, how’d you like to eat like this every day at home?”
Jack flinched at his sister and father’s screams. He had to do this. With a deep breath, Jack marched up to the door, opened the latch, and pulled with all of his might. Tears filled his eyes as the large spiders began to jump on him. He backed away from the door as his dad and Claire ran through the door and forced it shut before latching it.
“Well, that just sucks for you. Because I love this.”
“Okay, good,” Dean cleared his throat, and looked back down at his papers, thankful they wouldn’t need to have this discussion. He cleared his throat before going back to the original topic, “You know that I would love to buy you everything that you want. But until Miss. Demoniac pays me, that thing is pretty worthless,” they had been in the house for about three weeks, and while the ghostly trio had warmed up to the pair, they still didn’t know what their unfinished business was, and they weren’t ready to move on just yet. They liked their afterlife. Unfortunately, Abaddon didn’t like that, and she was refusing to pay the rest of what she owed him until they had.
“That’s not the point,” Cas said with a groan, “You couldn’t resist, you just had to come!”
“Hunters manor?” Mr. Lafitte said, already knowing the answer.
The boy had the softest looking, light brown hair with blue eyes that looked strangely familiar, and unexpectedly focused on Claire.
“Hello. Welcome to the library. I would like a book.”
“Dean, get me out of here!” Sam cried from the chair and Dean raced to untie him. Sam ran over to the fireplace to free Gabe as Dean looked at the punks.
Meg turned around and shrugged off her cloak. Her formerly scraggly blonde hair was now cut very short, but looked beautiful. Her skin was pale and clear. Big brown eyes stood out with her sharp cheekbones, “I am beautiful! Boys will love me!” she declared happily, touching her newly rejuvenated body. She was scantily dressed in pinks and purples that would not have looked right with her old form.
Sam ignored him and leaned down to get on his level, “You wouldn’t be trying to keep us out of the house now, would you?”
“It’s just a bunch of hocus pocus!” Abaddon cackled, “Meg,” she pointed to the left, ordering her sister to fly around them. The boys screamed as Meg flew up to them.
“Come on, let’s see what’s around back,” Cas suggested, already walking away. His family was quick to follow.
“Perhaps it is not too deep?” Meg wondered. Ruby and Abaddon shared a look before pushing Meg into the road.
“Then you can handle this?” she wanted to be sure.
“Dad!”
“Hey dad,” Jack asked Dean, “when we get to the lake, can I go to that pizza shop where I ate an entire pizza, and when we got to the cabin I threw up pepperoni? Can we go there?
“I can’t kill the spider, dad.”
Sam growled and lunged at the Doctor, but his own impatience was his own undoing. Dean grabbed the end of the cane and sent the tall ghost flying away once more. As he disappeared, Gabriel was revealed, having hidden behind Sam, while licking at an oversized lollipop in an attempt to calm his anxiety. It didn’t work. He didn’t want to fight this bizarre fleshy anymore. The short ghost gave a nervous chuckle, and did the first thing that came to mind.
“Dead man’s toe!” Meg cheered from her place by the ladder, she started chanting the phrase while dancing over to her sister, she snatched a toe from the bowl and began to nibble on it. It was the witches’ favorite ingredient, and just so delicious.
He had quickly found that one of the quickest ways to get home was to cut through the cemetery, but he was stopped halfway through by two boys.
“For what?”
Meg was just standing there with her tongue out, enjoying the water.
Jack’s eyes widened at the sight of his uncles sitting across from the living people. He rushed to put the plate on the table next to Dean, before turning to his uncles. Lucifer grabbed the little ghost by the shoulders, “How dare you serve these air-sucking intruders before us!”
Abaddon was too slow to run after him, hindered by both the cumbersome axe, and the high heel she had decided to wear that day for some godforsaken reason, “Damn it, Crowley!” she shouted, “This won’t hurt a bit!” Crowley was too busy spilling a bucket of floor wax on the tile of the hallway to pay much attention to her, “Don’t be a coward! If you would just—” she had been walking too fast to care to pay attention, and went flying forward on the slick tiles. Dean had spent a lot of time polishing the floors, telling Claire it was part of his ‘nesting’ habits. The constant upkeep, paired with the overdose of wax Crowley had spread out were too much for her. The redhead slipped on the wax for, and instead of allowing herself to fall down, struggled too much to regain her balance. She scrambled about, until she eventually fell out the second story window.
“Halt!” one of the boys said, a sickly thin one with a short haircut. “Who are you?”
Of course. That was just his luck.
Gabriel’s eyes widened as the book slowly floated over to Abaddon. She opened the book, “His punishment must be more fulsome…more lingering…Dazzle me my darling,” pages flipped, “Let’s see…amnesia, bunions, chilblains, cholera…We can do better than that,” she snickered, skipping ahead a few pages, smiling when something caught her eye, “Ahh…perfect. As usual,” she closed the book with a smile and Meg went to put it back, “His punishment shall not be to die…but to live forever with his guilt…”
“The dead are known for haunting us, but my question is, what’s haunting them? It’s a lack of resolution. Ghosts are simply spirits without resolution, with unfinished business. It’s my job to find out what that is.”
Jack gave the mirror a look, before acknowledging, “Okay, okay,” he got quiet for a second before leaping off the vanity, “But can he do this?!” he floated over to the center of the room. He stuck a finger in his mouth, and blew, looking like he was trying to get his ears to pop. Instead of that, however, his chest expanded, until he looked like a ghostly Superman, cape and all with a large blue ‘J’ on his chest. He turned to Claire and said in a pretty impressive Arnold Schwarzenegger accent, “Come with me if you want to live.”
“En Garde!” Gabriel declared as he and Lucifer continued the fight. Lucifer smirked and shoved the tip of the cane into the Doctor’s exposed armpit, earning himself a whack with the plunger. Gabriel took the opportunity to try and use his umbrella against Dean, but the living man ducked just in time. The makeshift weapon ended up opening up in Lucifer’s mouth, causing him to go flying back as he tried to sort himself out. Dean took advantage of Gabriel being unarmed, and used the plunger as a baseball bat, sending the smallest ghost flying.
“Take a hike.”
“Are you scared?!” Dean yelled through the door.
Dean knelt in front of the trunk, and fit the key into the old, iron lock. He pushed the heavy trunk lid open, and rifled through the contents, “What am I even supposed to be looking for, it’s all junk!”
Lucifer shook his head, and gave Castiel a pointed look, “If you truly love someone enough, they never leave you. They remain in your heart forever.”
“Oh, but when I’m working hard like this it doesn’t matter so long as I’m bringing home expensive gifts, right?” Dean coldly said, motioning to the watch he had given Cas for their anniversary. He immediately regretted saying that when Cas’s eyes filled with hurt. Before he could apologize, Cas was removing the watch, and throwing it onto the bed before stalking off to the bathroom and locking the door. Dean hurried after him, “I didn’t mean to say that, okay? Angel, please open the door, I’m sorry,” there was no response, and Dean couldn’t blame him. He decided to give him his space and turned to leave, only to jump at the sight of Roman standing right behind him. He hadn’t even heard the door open.
“All right, boys!” Dean exclaimed, picking up his bottle of Jack Daniels, and heading towards the door, “The night is young! We are gonna clean out every bar this town has got! We’re gonna booze it, until we lose it, so come on, come on!” he didn’t notice them shaking their heads and rushing towards him, trying to stop him as he walked backwards, not seeing the open manhole behind him until it was too late, and he was falling with a scream.
She plopped down on the floor, pulling her duffle bag to her. Her dad had gotten her enrolled in school on the drive up, and she would start tomorrow. Hopefully, she would be able to find something comfortable and clean. Maybe even kinda cute, something that would say, ‘you want to be friends with me.’ Just because she hasn’t had much luck at the last three schools, that didn’t mean this one wouldn’t be different.
“I’m sorry, Anna. I had to wait three hundred years for a virgin to light a candle,” the spirits vanished.
Claire gave him an incredulous look, “You’re gonna sell a house, with this!” she exclaimed, motioning to the cemetery.
“What do you think of the house, Mr. Winchester,” Mr. Morgenstern asked, focusing on Castiel.
Most of the girls and even some of the boys stopped looking at their partners as a new boy walked down the staircase, dressed as a pirate in a white shirt, with what looked like genuine pirate boots. There was a red sash hanging from his waste, trailing down his black-clad legs, and a very real sword hung from it.
Dean gave an awkward nod, before saying, “Carry on,” it just felt like the only thing he could’ve said. Roman gave a small bow and walked away. Cas walked over to the mantle.
“Punch his face in, dad!” Claire shouted, furious.
“Grab the book!” Gabriel ordered, jumping off it. Dean grabbed the book and they ran, dodging Abaddon and Ruby as they tore through the cemetery.
“But that’s not him! That’s my husband!” Dean shouted. He didn’t like this man trying to use his husband to cover his own mistakes.
Jack growled at him, but Claire merely shook her head, “Come on, let’s go.”
“You always make your costume,” her dad said absently as he blotted at the coffee remains on the papers he had been looking over while he ate.
“Bye bye.”
“Yah!” he screamed, fully prepared to fence with yet another ghost, but this one seemed much calmer than the other three.
It turns out, they wouldn’t need to haunt a pile of rubble. The ghosts were there to stay and judging by the way the construction men were running away, so was the house.
“Amuck,” Meg laughed, “Amuck, amuck, amuck—” she was cut off by Abaddon punching her in the gut. They had to think.
“Bubble bubble…I’m in trouble,” he flirted when he caught sight of the beautiful witches.
Roman left the room to see Sam and Gabriel waiting, obediently. He scoffed to himself as he saw the protective hand Sam had placed on Gabriel’s shoulder. Love was ridiculous. It made these two so easy to control all he had to do was threaten to make one of them disappear. He had done it before with other spirits, and he would do it again if these two pulled another stunt like the one tonight. He glared at Gabriel, “Get him ready. And this time, any further acts of insubordination will be dealt with in the harshest of manners.”
“Will you two stop that!” they stopped short with a shriek. She fixed them both with a glare, “I need to concentrate!”
“Neither his father, his mother, or anyone else ever knew what happened to him those three hundred years ago,” Dean’s history teacher, Ms. Mosely, finished the story. It was Halloween, and he and his family had just moved to Salem. Apparently, the Demoniac, now called Demon, sisters were important to history, “And so, the Demon sisters were hanged by the Salem town folk. Now, there are those who say that on Halloween night, there is a black cat who still guards the old Demoniac house! Warning off any who might make the witches come back to life!” Dean had to admit, she was a good storyteller. She finished the story by throwing a streamer she had curled up in her hand in the face of a girl sitting a few seats ahead of him. He rolled his eyes when she screamed.
In leu of answer, Jack just pulled one of the tassels hanging from the floor lamp next to the chair.
“Do you think we should break into a song?” Lucifer asked, sounding a bit too excited over the idea.
Claire turned to see the pretty girl from earlier standing behind her, “I had that locker last year,” she said with a friendly smile.
If only she had been paying more attention, she would have noticed that her car was too close to the cliff the manor resided on. She might have noticed the cliff’s edge was right outside of her door if she had been paying attention.
Dean shook his head, “But, Cas, I don’t—I don’t really know what I’m doing.”
Abaddon Demoniac glowed a bright green and exploded into a shower of green dust.
“I’m not, I’m just taking my little brother, Sammy, around.”
“Why’d you kill him?!” Dean asked, angrily.
“But,” Pamala began seriously, “Do not be deceived. All things are not as they appear. For the curse to be lifted, the truth must be known! And for the truth to be known, you must find the key!”
It worked. The top of the Lazarus blew steam like a kettle as the machine whirred to life, Claire guessed that was why it was kept under water. Not just to hide it, but because it was steam powered. She was so focused on keeping an eye on the dials, that she didn’t notice a hand in a shredded black suit jacket unlock the beaker of liquid from its compartment. Claire didn’t even notice something was wrong until the dials started to go haywire, and the steam slowly died down, “Jack!” she called out, worried. When she didn’t hear or see anything, she pulled the lever she had used to open the door in the first place. As she hesitantly peered around the corner, her eyes widened at the sight of her friend.
Cas and Sam’s eyes went wide and they stared at Dean. He shrugged awkwardly, “He talks.”
The ghostly trio shared a look with each other. Gabriel smirked and grabbed Jack. With a quick move and a wave of energy, he sent the young ghost flying up towards the full moon above them, leaving his three laughing uncles behind.
“Pardon the intrusion, Sir,” Roman began, “the master was wondering if he might have a word with you in the library.”
Dean gave a frustrated groan. She just had to mention the zombies. He turned back to the door, “Jack please! We’re running out of time, just open the door right now!”
“Michael didn’t kill himself, Roman did!”
Forget the costume, it was only nine o’clock, and the student council wouldn’t show up until at least six. She had a new task.
Sam had wandered around the dancefloor, peering into masks, but he couldn’t find his mother. He bumped into a woman and nearly went into shock. She was wearing leather pants, a red corset and a cone bra. Her blond hair had been done up and she had a microphone attached to her ear, “Mom?” he asked in shock. Mary’s eyes widened. Her kids weren’t supposed to see this, “What are you supposed to be?”
“Jack, this is beautiful.”
“It’s not just a car! She’s a very delicate piece of machinery,” he turned to Baby, and wiped a smudge off the black paint, “Shh. She didn’t mean what she just said,” he cooed. Jack and Claire rolled their eyes.
He walked right by all the girls who were giving him inviting smiles, and held his hand out to the lone wallflower, not taking his eyes off hers. She didn’t hesitate to take his hand.
Crowley and Abaddon knew they had to try a different approach, “What now?”
Claire’s eyes widened; she hadn’t expected this turn of events. Before she could say anything, Henry jumped to his feet once again, “Wait a minute, wait a minute! I thought we were having the party at my place,” when nobody said anything, he continued, “Oh, okay, we’ll take a vote. Whoever wants the party at my house, raise your hand,” he put his hand in the air, and glared at his classmates when not one of them followed him.
Cas wasn’t happy, but he didn’t argue. They looked around the hallway, which was decorated with real suits of armor. It made a very intimidating effect, and Dean didn’t really like it.
Dean sighed, and looked at his brother, “Give me one more chance?”
“Well, she can take you,” he turned to sit at his cheap drum set.
Cas gave him an appreciative smile and headed towards the curtains leading to the library. He smiled when he saw the blonde sitting with his back to the door, “Honey, it’s late, let’s not fight anymore. Come to bed?” he jumped back when the blonde stood up to reveal, not his husband, but Mr. Morgenstern, “Oh, I’m so sorry!” he said, face as red as a tomato as he accidentally knocked over a stack of books, “I thought you were my husband.”
“Come on, let’s go!” he said, pulling his big brother up.
Because she had only just died, Abaddon was still identifiable, with her long red hair, floating loosely around her face, and her too much makeup giving her features definition. You could even make out a hint of the outfit she had been wearing when she died.
“Oh. Well, I think I could come up with something pretty good. Why don’t we just roll you up in aluminum foil, and you could go as a leftover?” Dean laughed, but Claire just looked at him with a blank stare before shaking her head. Dean sighed, and smiled at her, “Don’t worry. You always look cute.”
“I don’t like Latin,” he said, calmly, before trying to leave again.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he jumped to his feet and picked up the crystal ball. He opened the drivers’ side door and buckled the psychic into the passenger seat before turning the car on and backing up until he had a straight shot, “Hold on,” he warned.
Seeing no other alternative, the family stood up and followed the pale butler out of the dining room.
“Shove it Satan,” she muttered.
Meg shot up from the bed, “Trick or treat!” Cas screamed. Dean jumped and backed away. Ruby and Abaddon burst out of the closet, holding a shaking bag that sounded like Gabe, Sammy, and the book.
“Leave me alone! Get away from me!” he finally reached his room, and slammed the door shut, effectively blocking out the pursuing spirit.
“Why?” Ruby asked.
“Dad, please. Whatever you do, don’t let those guys crash it.”
“I don’t care what they said, you are not demented,” Dean could slap himself. That was not a very tactful way to phrase that. Despite his career, he was never good at consoling her. Neither was Cas, but they at least had a more profound bond. Cas had always been able to at the very least, make her smile and forget for a few minutes what was bothering her. Dean and his daughter didn’t have a bad relationship, but it wasn’t the best right now, “You’re a picture of mental health.”
Claire interrupted, “Sunny side up kinda makes me gag.”
There was a sign on the partially open door that said, ‘Candy’s in the foyer’ so they didn’t waste time walking in, “Trick or treat,” Sam said, before a huge bowl of king sized candy bars on a table caught his eye, “Jackpot!”
“My what?”
With nobody containing the book, it flipped open in front of Abaddon, allowing her to read the page, “Fool! All of you! My ungodly book speaks to you! On All Hallows Eve when the moon is round, a virgin will summon us from under the ground! We shall be back! And the lives of all the children, shall be mine!”
“Honey! Nephie!” Dean came barreling down the hallway when Claire began to scream. Jack disappeared right before Dean went sliding into the room, “Honey, honey, what happened?”
Dean just scoffed and flicked the lighter.
“Halloween!” John and Sam cheered while Dean stayed quiet.
“It holds Abaddon’s most dangerous spells,” he explained, “She must not get it.”
“Yes, but the steps were too high. When we get older, we could trip!” Garth tried to reason. Dean liked Garth. He was a kindergarten teacher with a great sense of humor…he just refused to pick a house! and Bess was getting over it.
Come little children, the time’s come to play,
“It is him, Sir,” Roman assured him, “The gypsy woman prophesied her return. And now, the time has come. We’d best get you ready.”
Jack sighed, “I know there’s a way to get it going, I just can’t—”
“Yes, I’m Castiel,” he said.
“There is an evil in this house, a devil’s curse! It seeks to destroy you!”
“You die first,” she turned back to the potion, “Tis ready. Pry open his mouth!”
“Not even on Halloween?”
“Okay.”
“But it is written in his hand!”
“Yes, you can, come on now, whack it.”
“What is it?”
“Of course, anything.”
Claire was feeling the same way, but for different reasons. She rarely ever touched someone other than her father, and even that was rare. Both children felt an overwhelming surge of emotions, and Claire most likely would’ve started to cry if it weren’t for her dad walking into the kitchen.
Dean glared, but simply said, “No,” he went to ride on, but Crowley grabbed onto his backpack, stopping him.
“You idiot!” the red head yelled, “The boy has tricked us! And he’s stolen the book! After them!” The witches walked out the door and down the front path. They stopped at the road.
Claire’s eyes widened, and she leaped forward, landing with an ‘Umph’ on her stomach, the vial safely cupped in her hands as the treasure chest landed a few feet away from her, the force knocking the padlock off. She stood up, rubbing her aching abdomen, and looked inside the treasure chest.
Dean locked his pinky with her smaller one, forging the unbreakable pinky promise. He gave her an awkward car hug, before taking off once more.
“First you must find the trunk,” the psychic said.
Gabriel’s way apparently involved a ghostly horse-drawn carriage going through the walls of the mansion to get them outside. Dean held his children close and prayed. He could be a reckless driver when it was just him, but this was putting his family at risk, and he didn’t like that in the slightest. He shouted out the window, “I thought you said you could drive this thing!”
Roman glared at him, “His children. The ones he wasn’t supposed to bring. Along with that brainless husband of his. If I’d had to listen to another word from that insufferable fool, I think I would have burst.”
“It reeks of children,” Ruby said, hungrily.
When Castiel didn’t find Dean, he hurried over to the window and tried to force it open. He didn’t want to go back out there, and risk running into him again. He banged on the window for a few minutes, but it was futile. He couldn’t open it. He turned around to brave the hallway but stopped at the sight of the pale butler.
Castiel swallowed and looked at Roman, who was giving him a pointed glare. He put his hand in Lucifer’s, “Yes, my love,” and stood next to him.
“Uh-huh,” the man’s voice was unexpectedly gravely.
“Yes?”
“But he doesn’t remember!” Lucifer hissed. What was the point of being together when the man he loved didn’t remember loving him.
“No. Mr. Lafitte, my teacher, talked to me about it after school. He said that the student council would show up early to decorate, and they would also have food and drinks. It’s apparently against school rules for a parent to supply food. Something about not knowing allergies, and not knowing what the parent might have put in the food? I don’t know, it seems weird to me, but what do I know? I’ve never been to a dance, and you’ve never been a part of the PTA. We literally just have to take their word for it. Mr. Lafitte even said they would clean up the party afterwards. The only thing we would have to do is supply the place. Is it okay?” she asked, widening her big blue eyes that she knew were so similar to Papa’s. Her Dad had never been able to resist either of them.
There he was, just off to the side of the mirror, sitting on a sled. He didn’t look happy anymore. Instead, he looked very, very sad, “…I begged and begged my dad to get me this sled, and he acted like I couldn’t even have it, ‘cause I didn’t know how to ride it. And then one morning, I came down for breakfast, and there it was! Just for me, with no reason at all! I took it out, went sledding all day. Dad had to work, so my uncles went with me. Sam said, ‘That’s enough,’ but I couldn’t stop I was having so much fun. Then it got late. Got dark. Got cold. Lucifer wanted us to take a shortcut home, so I wouldn’t get sick. We got lost…Gabriel fell through a lake. Oh, God, Sam was so terrified, and we tried desperately to get him out, but it was too late. We finally made it home, Sam wouldn’t let anyone else carry Gabriel’s body. He never said anything, but I knew he blamed Lucifer, and Lucifer blamed himself. We were all soaking wet by the time we got home…and then I got sick…and my dad got sad…Sam followed Gabriel…and Lucifer couldn’t cope with the guilt of causing the death of both his brother, and his brother-in-law… we all left Dad alone.”
“Not for us, for you!”
Jack wasn’t paying attention as he pulled the door closed with a final look to his friend, “I’m gonna be alive.”
“Not yet! You wake my father, summon the elders! Go!” Balthazar went running back to the village. Gabriel ran through the field, ignoring the pain of small pebbles and twigs attacking his bare feet. Anna wouldn’t have long, “Anna!” he kept calling, praying his beloved sister would hear him. He ran into the trees and immediately tripped, rolling down a hill. He could feel his skin tearing along with his nightshirt. He finally stopped with a painful thud, sharp branches dug into the soft skin of his face. Groaning, he looked up, hoping he hadn’t lost sight of his sister.
They were in.
“Well you explained it very vividly, Abi, the way you started out with the adventure part but then you slowly—”
“Lucifer,” the man introduced, ignoring Dean’s hand, “Lucifer Morgenstern.”
She smiled, “Try again.”
Back at the cottage, Ruby was trying to calm a sobbing Abaddon, “Would you like to hit me? Would that cheer you up?” Abaddon gave a lighthearted slap to Ruby’s hand and continued to cry.
“Nice going, Dean,” he said, sarcastically.
The boys shared a look, neither one wanted to go in, but they also didn’t want to be the one to suggest leaving. But as Ben slowly made his way through the door, Jesse couldn’t stop himself, “Do we really have to do this?” he asked, stopping his friend.
His hand was warm as he led her to the middle of the dance floor. He wrapped her arms around his neck and placed his hands securely on her waist, before gently leading the two of them in a dance.
“To the Save the Bees Foundation: $14 million. And to the Save the Dolphins Foundation: $11 million. To the Save the Pumas Foundation: $1.2 million. To the Patagonian Wasp Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.”
As Dean’s heart broke, the room began to fill with a soft blue light. The ceiling had opened up, and a heavenly light was shining down into the room as the ghost ball that had led Claire and Jack to the attic and started to help them uncover the truth slowly approached. The ball slowly began to change shape until it was in the form of a man. A man with black hair and blue eyes.
Cas nodded, “Okay,” he put the book on the stairs and grabbed his trench coat.
“Wow,” the brother’s said in unison.
He started banging on the walls of the greenhouse, the only place that hadn’t been shut off to him. He was screaming at the top of his lungs, begging for the house to open up and let him in, but it was to no avail. Eventually he gave up and found something large he could use to try to break the glass. Nothing was working! Wherever he hit would just repair itself, and he couldn’t break the glass faster than the repairs. He fought against the windows for a good ten minutes before he tossed the branch to the side and collapsed against the side of his car.
“Oh? But we are!” Ruby snarled and the witches attacked. They grabbed him and picked up the small boy. He screamed and cried for help as they carried him to the cauldron. Dean couldn’t listen anymore. He shot up from his hiding place behind the book display.
Dean turned to the Fitzgerald’s, and whispered, “An interested party, excuse me.”
“Jack?”
The three boys waited a few minutes before climbing out of their hiding places, Cas nearly gave them a heart attack when he accidentally slammed open an oven door. He looked at it for a second before turning to the others, “I have an idea.”
“My treasure!” Jack objected when he saw the chest she was carrying.
“What are you talking about!? We’re going to heaven! You can’t take it with you,” Sam said, reasonably.
“Certainly could get to whatever’s behind those walls.”
They still didn’t notice the two intruders following their every move.
Azazel hummed and read down the will, “Let’s see…bobcats…owls…snakes…Ah. Here it is. Cousin: Abaddon. To my only living relative I leave you the Hunters Manor in Maine.”
“Find the thing that must be read, lest your heart be filled with dread,” Pamela said.
“Quick, hide the child!”
“Come on, Alex,” Herbert said, pulling her away, still glaring at Claire.
Ben rolled his eyes, “Come on,” he grabbed him by the hand, and pulled him into the house.
“Well, take your time. Relax, I’ve got everything under control up here.” A few seconds later, Dean regretted that sentence. The dozens of tombs that lined the wall began to crumble as corpse’s began to break their way free, “Claire you’d better look faster!”
Back at the Winchester home, the book opened its eye.
Dean frowned as Mr. Morgenstern stared over his shoulder. He turned around to see what he was staring at and found his husband. The green-eyed man bit back a scowl and told himself that Mr. Morgenstern was only curious. He motioned Cas over while saying, “This is my husband, Castiel.”
“And waiting for you!”
“Yeah?”
“That’s not generally allowed, Dean,” Sam said, “You gotta go through channels.”
“All right, it’s not the chicken, but we’re still getting out of here.”
She obviously picked a good one, as the door to the Lazarus swung open. Jack floated over, and looked inside the compartment, gathering his courage before heading inside of it. Claire wasn’t comfortable with any of this. There was no thing this thing worked if Jack’s father had never been able to bring back his own son. If a brilliant inventor couldn’t do it, how could Claire? “Jack?”
“I was worried you wouldn’t find it,” she said, walking up to him, “Besides, Jack’s fine. But Pamela said, ‘find the black crypt with no name, or your fate will be the same.’”
“Come on,” Ben said, dragging his justifiably scared friend behind him up the driveway. They found themselves at the large front door, it looked enormous and daunting to the preteen boys. Ben swallowed hard and reached for the handle, silently hoping the house would be locked. After all, an enormous, potentially haunted mansion on the cliffside. It must be locked, otherwise it would just be a prime spot for ghost hunters, squatters, addicts, and all sorts of looters.
“Dean, I’m not going up there! My friends at school told me all about that place, it’s weird!” Sam said, pulling his attention back to his brother. Dean looked down at him.
“Must be a big change for you.”
“No,” Claire scoffed, “We’re not doing anything. You’re the one who keeps packing up my stuff, and moving me around the country. I mean, in two years, I have been to nine different schools. I’ve eaten in nine different cafeterias. I can’t even remember anyone’s name! For once, I would just like to be in one place long enough…to make a friend.”
“What?!” Claire angrily exclaimed.
Dean had taken up residence in the front office. He turned on the PA system and couldn’t resist giving a werewolf howl, and letting it echo through the school, “Welcome to High School Hell! I’m your host, Boris Karloff Jr,” he gave a maniacal laugh. This was more fun than he had thought it would be, “It’s time to meet our three contestants; Meg, Ruby, and Abaddon Demoniac.” The witches in question were wandering aimlessly through the halls of the school, trying to figure out where Dean’s voice came from. A black cat walked out of a room near them. He looked at them and let out an angry hiss. Ruby growled in response and the witches followed him for a few minutes until they heard;
When Sarah came back downstairs to see Nick dancing with the blonde trollop he had invited into the house, she nearly screamed. Instead, she ordered them all out of the house.
“Claire.”
Dean groaned, “I’m glad she was so specific.”
Jack floated in a relaxed pose a few inches above his favorite chair, mindlessly channel surfing. He thought of all the people who had been to the house, recently and all the different ways his uncles managed to scare them off. It happened every time. All Jack really wanted was a friend, but the few people who weren’t scared of him were scared off by his uncles.
“Why not?” Crowley demanded as the pair looked around, trying to see who was speaking.
Gabriel led them to another headstone. This one read, ‘Here lies the body of Anna Novak; Beloved daughter, and sister’
“Nice going, Airhead,” Sam said with a bitchface.
“Daddy!” Claire yelled in fear as the corpse turned its head to look at them. Dean jumped and dropped the key.
“I’m afraid we have plans,” Cas said, polite, but firm. He looked at Dean, “Honey, we can’t stay for dinner.”
Speaking of Cas though, Dean suddenly remembered his favorite picture of him had been in that box.
Every hand in the class shot up, with a resounding ‘yeah!’ that settled it. Now, they could finally get to work.
“Ow! He bit me!” Ruby whimpered. Meg cried out when Sam kicked her in the shin with all of his flailing. Abaddon ignored them and held out the wooden spoon to Sam’s tightly closed lips.
As they climbed out of the car, Claire slammed her door behind her, “Hey, now. Don’t slam the door like that. She’s sensitive,” Dean said, walking over to Baby.
Dean was lucky. He fell onto a shorter part of the roof, rolled off of that onto the green house, and fell off of that onto the roof of his beloved impala. He was in a lot of pain, but nothing felt broken, and he would live. He definitely needed to go to a hospital, but at least it wouldn’t be the morgue. Unlike his husband if Dean couldn’t find a way to get back into the house and save him.
He remembered right in the nick of time, he realized as he caught the wooden frame holding the picture, “Not! Not…this one. Thank you, gentlemen.”
The crowd dispersed as the witches took their final breaths. Charles Novak was the last to leave. As he was walking away, a black cat came up to him and brushed up against his legs, meowing piteously.
Abaddon’s red lips twisted into a sneer, “What do I normally do when something gets in my way?”
Claire rubbed her face where he had just been, “You’re so cold,” she observed, trying not to shiver.
Dean looked between his daughter and the ghost, curious, but also not really wanting to know what was going on between the two of them, “We should get going,” he said, pulling Claire close and preparing to leave the room and head to the party. For the first time, he looked around where they were, “Um…where are we?”
“I can’t believe it’s him,” Ruby squealed as the witches followed the devil into the house.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Oh, come on, it’s just a bunch of hocus pocus.”
“I’m afraid I can’t answer that,” the voice responded, apologetically.
“Gabe? Is that you?”
“Lucifer, you animal!” he smirked at the doctor, “He available, Doc?”
“Could this be an expression of hostility, Doc?”
“Leave him alone!” Jack shouted
Her Dad nodded, before patting her on the head, “Night Nephie,” she rolled her eyes at the nickname. Dad had always said that Papa was his angel, making her their little Nephilim. Nephie used to be his favorite thing to call her, but it happened less and less over the last two years. It used to annoy her, but now she cherished every time he would call her that. She never knew if it would be the last time.
“So, you killed him,” Lucifer was ready to kill.
“No. It’s just kind of sad. In a way, I understand it, though. I don’t remember my mom, either.”
Dean forced himself out of her grip, and rolled away from her. Above them, Meg Demoniac held out her arms, and welcomed death. She exploded in a cloud of purple dust.
Judging by everyone’s reaction whenever this place was mentioned, she was positive that no one would ever come to visit. Not before the Halloween dance, at least. But as she pulled the door open, she was very pleasantly surprised to see Alex, the pretty girl from school, “Alex? What are you do—I mean, hi.”
“You’ll be fine,” Cas said with a comforting smile, before leaning down to kiss his children on the cheek.
“The truth is that they just need help sometimes, just like the rest of us,” the doctor said to the camera, before the narrator took over once more, as the camera focused on the picture of another handsome man, with messy black hair, a subtle smile and beautiful blue eyes.
Jack stopped dancing as the clock struck ten. Claire pulled away, concerned, “Jack?” she asked. Jack didn’t say a word. He simply leaned in, giving Claire more than enough time to pull away and pressed his lips to hers in a soft, sweet first kiss.
Claire and Dean shared a look over their pancakes, both a little creeped out, but neither one hesitating to eat. Jack was really an amazing chef for a dead person.
Jack bashfully looked around the room at all the wide-eyed junior high kids staring at him. He gave an awkward chuckle, and just gave a soft, “Boo.”
Cain was crawling back into his grave, finally able to sleep now that both his and his wife’s murders had been avenged. Cas ran over to the brothers and Dean wrapped his arm around him.
Mary blushed and looked down at the cone bra, “Madonna…obviously…can’t you tell?”
“Come on, Jack, it’s just a spider. How big could it be?” he took his son’s hand and walked him back down the hall to his bedroom. Sure enough, crawling on the window, was a spider, a little smaller than a quarter, “Come on, you’re acting like it’s Shelob, or something,” he pulled the small boy over to the window, “Look, you’re ten years old, I think it’s time you learned how to kill a spider. The most efficient way to crush a spider,” the father picked a magazine off his son’s bedside table and rolled it up, “You take a good magazine, and roll it up good and tight. You get an eye on that spider and take a good side swing to kill it. That’s all you have to do.”
Claire scoffed, grabbing one of the boxes and moving it to the closet. She might have seen Jack inside of it trying to figure out a way to say hi, if she hadn’t been looking at her father, “Please. This is the deadest place yet.”
Abaddon gave a satisfied sigh when she saw the girl. Her bright hair was moving, as if it were caught in a breeze, and she was surrounded by a dull glow. The potion had worked, “Sisters, prepare thyselves. Tis her lifeforce! The potion works! Take my hands, we will share her.”
“Are you trying to tell me that I just spent the last two days holding his clammy hand and waiting for him to die, and all I get in return is one lousy piece of property?” Abaddon was furious. She and her cousin had always hated each other, but this was just too far. This was just Cain’s final ‘I hate you’ to his own cousin.
“Sammy, this is the boy of my dreams!”
Dean smiled at the pair, “Well, Mrs. Fitzgerald…taking that into consideration, there’s only one thing left to do,” he walked over to his clients, and handed them a pen, “Let’s sign some papers.”
Jack and Claire shared a look that clearly said they thought their father was insane while Gabriel looked up at Sam, “The psychic! He saw the psychic!”
“Oh, great,” Sam said, miserably. He had given up on the mask and was just carrying it in his candy bag.
“It’s beautiful, like a fine hotel,” Dean said with a wide smile.
“Oh, God! The woods!” there were two figures heading towards the trees. The boys ran to the edge of the village, a large field was now all that stood between them and the tree line. Gabriel’s heart stopped when he saw his eight-year-old sister, her flaming red hair making her stand out. She was following a stooped figure in a ratty purple coat, “Anna!” he screamed, voice echoing through the field, but she had already entered the forest.
Al couldn’t help but laugh at that, but he stopped after a glare from Crowley. He looked down when something caught his eye, “Woah…check out the new cross trainers,” he said, looking at Dean’s Nike shoes his mom had insisted he get.
Claire was pacing her room, frustrated, “I can’t believe they don’t have any WIFI! We just had to take that little detour. ‘Twenty minutes tops’ what a joke.”
If Claire was being honest, that was the last thing she wanted to do. This was the thing she hated the most about new schools. The awkward introduction. She sighed, but stood and slunk her way to the front of the classroom, trying to ignore the whispers of the other students. She reached the front of the class and avoided looking out into the sea of judgmental twelve-year olds. Before she could get it over with, something unexpected caught her eye. In the poster of Mt. Rushmore, where Lincoln’s head should be, was Jack. He was just floating there, trying to match the face on the poster. When he saw her looking at him, he gave her a big smile and an encouraging nod.
Dean decided to take Pamela, she was never dead, so she stayed behind. Her premonitions and way of speaking would drive them insane at times, but there was one thing she would say that comforted them whenever they worried about the spirits from Morgenstern Manor.
“I saw a ghost. It had a head, and it was round, and it was white and see-through.”
“Well, this is condemned seafront property,” Crowley said, ignoring his acquaintance.
“Or this?” Abaddon mocked, holding her book. Dean screamed and backed away when the book blinked at him. He ran over to Cas, but Abaddon opened the book. A burst of energy shot out at him, forcing him to the ground, unconscious.
The impala sped down the highway towards the graveyard. They just needed to wait out the witches. If they could make it to sunrise, they would be fine. Dean pulled baby to a stop by the entrance and they slipped inside, just as the witches caught up to them. Dean had just breathed a sigh of relief when Cain grabbed him. The zombie had finally caught up to them.
Dean smiled at the couple touring the house, “It’s love, isn’t it? Sometimes, you walk into a house, and you take one look around…and you say, ‘This is for me.’”
Claire looked at the mess of papers and machinery, “Kind of a slob, wasn’t he?”
“What?” Cas asked, smiling. This was so sudden.
“Then why do we have to have what you didn’t have?” she asked, sounding insulted.
Dean’s eyes burned with fury. There was no way this bastard was going to hurt his Cas, “If you put one finger on my husband, I swear I’ll kill you!” he took a swing, more than ready to punch this ghost’s face in, but before he could make contact, Roman had moved.
They were flattered that he remembered them, “At your service, master!”
“Dad?”
“Hey, Dr. Winchester’s got a lot of spirit. You know what I’m saying?” Gabriel asked the other two.
The spirits were listening, Dean figured as both the table and chair he was sitting in began to lift off the ground, “Hey, hey!” Dean shouted. He was terrified of flying, and this really wasn’t helping, “Hey, I’d really like to stay on the ground, all right?!” as the table began to spin, he began to scream, “Can I stay on the ground, please?!”
Dean blinked once, twice. That was certainly not what he thought she would say, “When you say host…you mean DJ, or something? At the school gym, right?”
Cas smiled and relaxed into Dean’s side, and they all fell asleep.
“Bye bye, world.”
“You have a beautiful daughter, Dr. Winchester.”
“Look familiar?”
Lucifer nodded, before turning away to put some of the books on his desk “Yes, he strikes most people that way, but once you get to know him, you’ll find that’s not the case. He’s really very…” he turned back around and lost his train of thought as Castiel handed him the rest of the stack with a sweet smile. Lucifer shook his head, “He’s really very sweet. Thank you,” he said, accepting the books, “He’s been like an older brother to me.”
John smiled at his oldest son, “Very cool.”
Castiel smiled, he loved stories, “What happened here, Mr. Morgenstern?”
The witches ran. They ran back to where they had left their brooms, only to find them gone.
“Where I can watch over both of you until we’re together again, which better not be for a very long time. Goodbye Dean,” he whispered, and Dean watched, not looking away for one second as the blinding white light came once again, taking his husband with it as it faded away.
“You better, Dad. But a single guy your age is more likely to become a hostage in a bank robbery than to make new friends,” Claire said with a little laugh.
Gabriel tore his eyes away from the witches and looked at the chair. His sister was stooped over, so he couldn’t see her face. He was glad. Her hair, which hung like a cloak around her head, was a dull gray. Her hands were wrinkled and looked like claws. She wasn’t moving.
“Oh! Thou hast waited in vain! And thou whilst fail to save thy friends, just as thou failed to save thy sister!” she taunted, before flying down to them.
“Okay, I’ll see you later.”
“Exactly—” Crowley said, before realizing exactly what Abaddon had meant.
Gabriel scoffed before slamming one of the heavier suitcases into Sam’s hands and dragging him towards the light, “The hell I can’t!” he declared as they too, were lifted into heaven, along with the other spirits who had been trapped in the house. They were all free.
After he had expressed his affection to his satisfaction, he walked away from the ghosts and staggered back over to the bar where he had left his bottle of whiskey.
“Why is everyone talking about a curse!” Dean was feeling very tired of all of this, and right now he just wanted to be at the lake, cuddling with Cas in front of a fire, “Wait a second, have you been talking to that crazy green medium lady in the giant paperweight?”
“Yes,” Cas began, apologetically, “We were on our way out of town.”
“It’s no problem, it’ll be a piece of cake.”
He was pulled out of his embarrassment by a frightening wind starting to blow, and ghoulish laughter ringing through the house, “Uh oh…it’s them.”
Claire hesitantly walked up to the entrance and noticed a carving on the door written in Latin, “Look,” she said to her dad, “It’s a warning.”
Claire was not impressed, “It smells like grandma’s house,” she said, wrinkling her nose.
Jack had been looking for Claire all morning with no luck. He had finally floated up to the attic, a room he didn’t see much point in spending time in. The small ghost noticed noise coming from an open door off to the side, and floated over to it. before he could head inside, Claire peeked around the door frame, “It’s about time,” she said with a laugh before pulling back, and letting him see what was inside.
“Dorothy!” Crowley cried happily.
Dean cleared his throat, trying to dislodge the ache that would probably never go away and went back to the box, “I’ll help you unpack.”
There was time later. Time for Dean to talk to Claire about her Papa’s visit. Time for Jack to find the formula for the life-giving potion. Time for the ghostly trio to find a less destructive way to cope with their afterlife. But for now, it was time for them all to clean up the party. Just the father, daughter duo. The ghostly trio. And the one, friendly ghost.
“Claire, chill. Take a breath, or you’re gonna pass out,” Dean interrupted. He would be lying if he said he liked the idea, but he knew how hard it was for Claire to make friends, and she was right about this being a good opportunity for her. He would figure out a way to get the ghostly trio to leave her alone for the night, “Would we need to buy food, or decorations?”
That was until an arm broke through the top of the coffin. The zombie sat up with a grunt. He had long, stringy hair that was pulled back into a ponytail, and through a scruffy beard, you could see a thick black thread keeping his lips together. His skin was a sickly green-gray, but otherwise, he was remarkably put together for someone who had been dead for three hundred years.
“But dad, we have to help them!”
Mr. Morgenstern offered, “Of course, you are more than welcome to spend the night here.”
“…Yes…turkey…Very good sir. If you will kindly follow me?”
Claire followed, “If you’re Stephen King.”
“Down here he could do whatever he wanted to. But no matter how busy he was, he would drop everything to play pirates with me.”
“What?”
Deeming it a lost cause, he read it aloud regardless, “’Buccaneers and buried gold. Hunters doth a treasure hold.”
Crowley leaned over to Al, “They’re very health-conscious there in Kansas,” he said, knowingly. The two boys laughed and crowded into Dean’s personal space.
“Uh…it’s kinda hard to explain.”
“Sisters,” Abaddon said happily, voice no longer hoarse, “Behold!”
Recovered from the fright of his sudden appearance, Dean walked over to him, winning smile firmly in place, “Your grandfather had really good taste,” he complimented, “I’m Dean Winchester of Winchester Realties. Charmed to make your acquaintance, Sir,” he greeted, holding out his hand.
“Listen to this,” Cas said, reading aloud, “Only a circle of salt can protect thy victims from thy power.” Before he could read any more, Gabe jumped onto the book, closing it, “We were just trying to help you,” Cas defended.
Alex smiled, awkwardly, “Can I come in?”
Dean and Sam were actually pretty evenly matched, although Sam’s form was beginning to suffer the longer they fought, mainly due to sheer annoyance that this bone bag was lasting against him.
“Even better,” Lucifer said, reaching for the picture. None of them were serious. It was just another way to rile up their newest…intruder? Therapist? Housemate?
“Who are you?!” Crowley shouted, as Abaddon hid behind him. Less of an ‘I’m scared’ move, and more of a ‘you’ll die first.’
“Sir,” Sam started, wanting to grovel, and beg for him not to damn Cas to this life. Roman didn’t want to hear anything. He glared at Sam with a stone-cold face and growled out;
The two headed back to the Lazarus, and put the vial back in its compartment, ready to bring Jack back to life. But as they pulled the lever to open the door, Abaddon burst out of it, “Ta da!” she shouted, cackling gleefully at the way they jumped back. Crowley wrapped his arms around the treasure chest, “Back off! It’s my turn in the oven!” she turned to her accomplice, “Crowley! Get this thing working you blasted little worm, you!”
“Witch hunters! Notice how they wear black robes, and carry axes to chop the wood to burn us!” Abaddon warned.
“Oh, Abi, how generous of thee,” Ruby said, teasingly.
“It’s your hour, Freud,” Lucifer chimed in.
Jack and Claire continued to follow the ghost ball to an elevator…a house had an elevator. As the doors opened, Jack started to walk away. This seemed like a very bad idea. Claire wasn’t hearing of it and pulled him back by the collar.
Dean faced his trio of enemies and held aloft his most powerful weapon. A weapon known far and wide as something dangerous and vile, something that no sane being, living or dead, would want to be touched by. A used toilet plunger.
“Dad!?” she cried out in shock and horror as the ghostly trio floated over to him to help him regain his balance, “No! What have you done to him?!”
Claire shook her head, before giving the mirror a very pointed look, “How about a reflection?”
Claire and Jack started to run down the hallway, “We’ve gotta go back there.”
“My broom!”
Lucifer sadly leaned against the door. He could have followed, but maybe Michael needed a moment to take things in. He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Roman appear, “He doesn’t remember…” he choked out, “It can’t be him…” the thought broke his heart. He thought he had finally found him again.
Dean shook his head at them, “Don’t worry, we’ll be twenty minutes tops.”
Abaddon raised a neat eyebrow as the front desk worker finally takes her off hold, “Yes, I’m still here. Find me the number for Dr. Dean Winchester.”
“Every house we look at, you find something to pick at.”
“What is it?” Dean asked, terrified for his boy.
Dean shook his head, and patted her blonde hair, “Slow down. What are you saying?”
“I just turned ten! I’m still getting used to it!”
“A holy mess, you know what we’re saying?” Sam continued, “But for you…I don’t know. Maybe we can work something out. If you can keep that demon Abaddon off our backs, then I’d say we got a deal. Right boys?” the other two ghosts nodded in agreement, “Deal?” Sam offered, raising his intangible hand.
Jack sat bored in his playroom, idly tossing his baseball up and down. He could hear the party floors below him, and wanted to go, but he knew that he would ruin the night for Claire if he showed up as a ghost. It would have been nice to show up alive…
“Who?”
“Other settings for what?” Dean asked.
It wasn’t a comfortable sensation, but at least he was through. He ran down the corridor, barely registering Claire’s worried yells. He felt the ghosts chasing him until he reached the top of the staircase.
“I love you too, bitch,” he muttered, kissing Sam’s shaggy hair.
“No! Cas don’t do this! Please!” he begged to no avail. The light was starting to fade from Castiel’s beautiful blue eyes. He had been too late. The truth was revealed, and Roman was gone, but his husband, the love of his life, his own personal angel, was dead. And it was all his fault, “Cas, please! I love you,” he whispered softly as Castiel went limp in his arms.
She took a deep breath, but decided to be brave. Her eyes met Jack’s foggy ones, and she held her hand in the air, palm facing the ghost in an obvious invitation. Jack smiled, and slowly reached out to her.
“Wow,” Cas said, before looking back at the gate, that was chained shut with a rusted padlock, “How are we gonna get in?”
“Roman will kill them if you try to get them out,” he warned, “You have to do what he says.”
“Late again, I see,” Gabriel tsked in a disappointed voice.
“It’s no use! I don’t remember the ingredients! I-I-I’ve got to find my book!” she screamed running out of the room, Ruby trailing after her.
That evening, the witches were standing on the gallows with ropes around their neck. There had been no need for a trial when they found the body of what had been Anna Novak.
“But papa’s in trouble!” Jack said.
As the unseen entity snapped the picture, the boys ran screaming out of the mansion.
After another half hour of driving through a thick forest without any sign of civilization, they finally drove up to an old, iron gate.
“I haven’t seen you for centuries, but come in!”
Sam rolled his eyes, and kept the reigns, slowing the carriage down to a much more reasonable pace. He loved Gabriel, but the man couldn’t drive to save his life.
All he could see was three hooded figures huddled over something. There was the one with the purple cloak from earlier, another in green, and the third had a faded red cloak. He took in the large cauldron boiling over a fire. The place reeked of evil.
“That’s none of your business, that’s who!” the man said, “Now, come on, get out of here! It’s way past your bedtimes.”
“Well, hello little one,” Abaddon said, still in that disgustingly sweet voice, “Such an adorable little…child.” Ruby rounded the counter and grabbed Sam’s arm.
Castiel held his children close as the fireplace seemed to go insane. They all watched in horror as a demonic figure came flying from the flames to pull Roman into Hell. Lucifer and Dean covered their eyes from the flames until it was all over. Roman was gone, and the truth was free.
“It’s protected by magic,” Gabriel said, as if it should’ve been obvious. Dean sighed and closed the lighter.
Crowley whirled on them, holding the crowbar up in defense, “Stay back. Keep away from me! Don’t come near me you spiteful spook, or I’ll knock you into the next world!”
“We’ll just drop by for twenty minutes on the way up to the lake. I swear, we’ll just talk things over. Nothing more.”
“Are you gonna be alright alone?”
“Well, I don’t know! Cat’s got my tongue!” she and her sisters laughed. Nobody paid any attention to the cat hissing at the witches.
Once the carriage slowed down, Dean Claire and Jack looked out the window into the cemetery.
“Paper work,” Gabriel clarified.
Claire walked over, “Oh. My. God. Dead people?!”
This sounded too easy, “You’re telling me all I need to do is find this key, and I can walk out of here with my husband and kids like nothing ever happened?”
Lucifer realized, “You’re not looking for him, are ya, Doc?”
Abaddon and Crowley looked on in horror as a swirling, menacing glowing vortex appeared in the middle of the foyer. The moans and cries coming from the distorted faces were enough to send the two scrambling out to their car, as shrieking laughter followed them.
The three other ghosts groaned when she started crying, “Flesh flood alert,” Lucifer joked, making the other two laugh.
“Go back! I’m not going back there!”
“Castiel Winchester?” he asked. Cas recognized his voice from the phone.
About an hour later, Claire was curled up on her bed, exhausted from the emotional conversation. Jack floated next to her. He knew she was nearly asleep, so was very surprised when she suddenly said, “Sometimes I worry that I’m starting to forget.”
Crowley laughed at her, “Oh, you can haunt me all you want, but it’s gonna be in a great big, expensive house! With lovely purple wallpaper, and great big green carpets! And a little dog…named Abaddon. A bitch! Just like you! I’ve got the power! I’ve got the treasure!” Crowley officially had it all. Everything he wanted. There was nothing left for him.
Dean shrugged him off, “Yeah, well the old days are dead,” he shrugged Sam off his shoulder and ran up the small flight of stairs to the loft attached to his bedroom. He may hate Salem, but he got a cool room.
The trio shared a confused look. Hadn’t they made that clear? Sam looked back at the therapist, “What, you think I’m blind? Of course, I’ve seen him. Who hasn’t?”
Abaddon snarled at her sisters’ idiocy and crawled out of the bushes, “Listen to me you fools! The magic that brought us back only works tonight, on All Hallows Eve! When the sun comes up, we’re dust!” she waited for that to resonate with her sisters before continuing, “Fortunately, the potion I brewed the night we were hanged shall keep us alive and young forever!” Meg and Ruby breathed a sigh of relief, until she continued, “Unfortunately, the recipe for that potion is in my spell book that that little wretch has stolen! So, it stands to reason, sister’s dear, that we find my spell book, brew the potion, and suck the lives out of the children of Salem by sunrise. Otherwise, it’s curtains! We evaporate! We cease to exist! Dost thou comprehend?”
Dean laughed, “You sound like your Papa. He would always use those weird statistics, and I was always too afraid to check if it was true or not.”
“Ouch!” Meg screamed, flying out of reach.
