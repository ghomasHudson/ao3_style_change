Sherlock swallows and looks away, “of course. Now if you excuse me, I have a case waiting.” He clears his throat and sits down; steepling his hands under his chin, legs crossed and eyes closed. “That’s a cue for you to leave, Mr Watson.” John sighs and kneels down, placing a tender kiss on Rosie’ forehead before leaving in a slight soldiers march.
Rosie giggles and looks up at him, “Unwle Mywoft is in wove.”
“I suppose it’s always been there, battling with my conscience. But your birthday two and a half years ago, when you hugged me.” He smiles softly at the memory. Sherlock’ eyes wander over John’ facial features and he melts.
Oh, right. The rain. John can hear it pattering furiously against the roof.
Squatting down next to the wall, he squares his shoulders. One hand readies the robe, while the other grasps the wooden frame in a tight grip. Closing his eyes, sucking in a deep breath—he whips the door open and shoots his arms out, robe sailing towards the floor—only to be met by empty air.
John rationalizes, inhaling deeply.
There’s a connecting bathroom included. Everything on the inside is tinged pink. The walls, the tiling, the sink—even the fuzzy toilet seat cover.
John’s admittedly a little relieved about that last bit. He doesn’t particularly fancy the idea of soot being tracked through his room in the form of tiny pawprints.
Harry had never been the best cook. At most, she could boil some water and pour a bowl of cereal—but that was the extent of her culinary skills. Meanwhile, John could undercook eggs and burn toast.
Glancing over his shoulder with furrowed brows, he observes the propped-open door across the iridescent tunnel—where he can still see hints of
John has a feeling his sister won’t take too kindly to finding a mangy, dirty stray lounging about in their new home. He hadn’t seen any ticks or fleas clinging to the animal’s coat when he’d been petting it earlier, but he doesn’t want to take any chances—he’ll need to find the little guy.
Harry sniffles, wiping at her nose with the back of her hand. Her mouth pulls into a wry grimace as she looks at him, almost apologetically.
Reestablishing his grip on his cane, he gingerly makes his way around to the front, coming to a stop near the moving van.
Her wide grin never falters, even as John stares back with pinched brows—fidgeting under her attention.
The one thing that helps solidify his father within the timeline of John’s life, however—are the snow globes.
“Nice to meet you. I’m John—John Watson.” The boy squints at him, unmoving. John’s cheeks burn.
before he stills and averts his gaze to his experiment.
Oh. Well, then.
In Sherlock’s eyes—John was simply
John understands why—being a solider in the Army is dangerous, they can’t reveal their location to anyone, not even family member. But secretly, John wishes he could know—where his father is, if he’s safe.
“Oh, um. Just a snack.” He finishes lamely. She squints at his “snack,” brows raised.
Sherlock hums again.
“Though it looks like you’ve not been fed much, if that’s the case.” Another meow. “Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat?” Two meows.
“Double, chocolate-y chip shake, with whip cream and a cherry on top?” Her fluttering laugh echoes through the kitchen. After a brief moment’s hesitation, he timidly joins her, chuckling quietly.
Two other doors line the upstairs hallway. One opens to reveal a tiny linen closet, completely empty—save for a carton of extra shelf paper, and dust.
Eyes darting to the forest above, he heaves himself up using his stick for leverage.
“Are you sure it’s closed off? I thought I might have heard something on the other side.” Harry pauses in her digging through the brown takeaway bag. She cocks her head at him, her unruly brows furrowed.
Rain patters heavily against the glass.
Marcus's smile never leaves his face as he turns to John, " you must be Captain John Watson", he offers out his hand for John to sake. John take it and shakes it firmly "Yes I am, but please call me John", Marcus smiles, "well John, Sherlock has told me a lot about you, not to mention I read your blog, its nice to see what my brother is doing", John is slightly taken back, Sherlock talks about him, not to mention to his brother that John didn't know existed till earlier this morning.
Sherlock's Shirt: His Purple Shirt Of Sex
The Underwear John Is Wearing: https://www.garconmodel.com/underwear/dodge-brief.html
"Come along now John, we have a case to solve" Sherlock practically skips away, John follows but not before taking one more look at Marcus, Marcus gives him a small smile and mouths "Thank you" before he walks back out into the hall.
"Yes, yes, I will talk to him", Sherlock waves a dismissive hand at Marcus and Marcus rolls his eyes,
He pulls out a shirt that feels like cotton and has a wine red and dark red checked pattern all over it, he has to admit, it is very nice. Next he pulls out a pair of black slim fit dress trousers, of course Sherlock could deduce the exact size that he needed for his clothes to fit him well.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked at the scene before him and instead of seeing Sherlock and Marcus as they are now, he saw a young frighten child in Marcus's place and a caring older brother, telling him it would all be okay. This was a different side of Sherlock, no petty feud, no barriers, the man he saw here was the real Sherlock.
I would love to get some constructive criticism and also excuse any spelling mistakes or punctuation errors I have dyslexia so it can be easy for me to miss them.
John looks at him and nods slightly hoping he will add to that, Mycroft shifts, pausing for a second, "well that's not entirely true, we are the only two known to the public, people have only ever know there to be two Holmes brothers" He looks slightly uncomfortable, John looks over at Sherlock more than a little bit confused by what Mycroft was saying, "Sherlock?" John says hoping that Sherlock will clue him in. Sherlock who was looking down at his violin in deep thought, locks eyes with John and takes a deep breath, "What my

"Its a deal"
The high functioning sociopath Sherlock claimed to be, as a doctor, John knew wasn't true, but now he saw why Sherlock really did it. Sherlock put up this barrier to protect himself and his brother, he put on this mask to make sure no one could hurt them and so that he could be logical and get things done, so that his brother could be sensitive and do what he loved the most. John also knew that wasn't the only reason Sherlock did it, it was clear that Sherlock put on this mask to protect himself from other people's words and so that his brilliant mind could work without emotion clouding it, but Sherlock wasn't incapable or void of care or empathy, he simply didn't understand it as well as others and often missed certain social queues and facial queues, that meant he could come across insensitive. He saw here that Sherlock could care and feel sympathy and love, but it was also clear he didn't often let emotion get the best of him.
"This is the main room as you know, strippers and the sex workers walk around here flirting with the customers offering extra services and sex, for a price obviously" Marcus turns to face Sherlock and John, "the rooms down stairs are for the sex workers to use and the doors dotted around in here" He points to some rooms off from the main room, "are for the strippers to use".
Marcus had showed them to the main club area, after agreeing to John's offer. Sherlock had threw all of this, had been sneaking glances at John, Though John wasn't sure why, he assumed it was because he had offered to help his brother, in a way Sherlock would not have expected and so John payed little attention to it.
". Sherlock smiles at his brother before taking the key,
John's Shoes In Black: https://www.billyruffianshoes.co.uk/shop/westminster-oxford/
" John says dangerously, he doesn't look at Sherlock, for fear he would question his blush, "why the hell did you buy me underwear?!", John checked the size they are defiantly for him.
Sherlock doesn't respond at first, but as soon as John looks up at him he starts to speak, his head turned from John as he does, "John don't be an idiot, this brand of underwear is specifically one, that a lot of gay men wear, and if we are to bend in we need to match even down to our underwear" Sherlock speaks as though this was obvious from the start, turning his head back to look at John.
"yes precisely John, we will be going to a gay strip club and we need to blend in if we are to catch the criminal who is doing all this" John reaches into the bag and goes red when he realises what he pulled out, they were a pair of briefs, they where grey and neon orange and looked extremely tight, "
, Sherlock stopped in front of the door and hesitated, John looked at him, worried Sherlock might to actually be able to go threw with his. John reached out and put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, "you alright mate?" John asked, worry clear in his voice, "you don't have to do this you know", Sherlock breaths in a deep breath and looks at John,
The man strides over to Sherlock, who's face now adorns a massive grin, the man stops in font of him, "Sherlock!" he speaks in a warm cheery voice, which seems to fill the whole room, "Marcus" Sherlock says back, his voice also warm. Then the two men hug, wrapping their arms around each other tight, rocking slightly as they hugged. When they pull away the man is still smiling warmly, as is Sherlock, "Its good to see you again brother" Marcus's smile seems to widen, Sherlock smiles at him again before gesturing over to John.
"Right!" Peter exclaimed clapping his hands together and smiling at Sherlock who was towering over him, though he was only stood in front of him, "top off then". Sherlock didn't hesitate and with a clinical look he went on unbuttoning his shirt. John tried not to stare as more and more of his slender but muscular frame was revealed, his skin is creamy and reminds john of milk, its not like John hadn't seen Sherlock naked before but there was something so mesmerising about it and where they were didn't help.
John cleared his throat and Sherlock seemed the snap out, and stop looking for whatever he was looking for. "Thank you, John" He said in a small voice, John relaxed and his eyes softened, its not very common for Sherlock to say thank you but when he does he means it, "well of course, anything to help my best mate out" he smiled at Sherlock. A flash of hurt seemed to cross over Sherlock's face but it was to quick for John to really notice.
"well yes, all my best workers to and some of the most popular dancers as well", Sherlock thinks for a second, then looks back at his brother,
Marcus smiles at his brother clearly use to his excitement about murders, then looks over at John, "and you John, will you help?", John had been thinking about what Mycroft said about Marcus being a drug addict since they got here, and he decided what he was going to do, "yes but only under the circumstances that once we have finished this case, you stay with us for a while, so I can make sure you stay off drugs and that Sherlock doesn't take any either", Marcus clearly a little taken back looks up at Sherlock, who seems rather stunned himself, but as soon as Sherlock's eye scan John's he seems to understand, "I believe our good doctor, wants to help", a small smile creeps onto Sherlock's face as he looks at John, then looking back at his brother, he asks, "would you deny him that?", Sherlock smiles at Marcus, who slowly looks back over to John, clearing thinking long and hard about it,
A few minutes later Sherlock re-appeared and signalled for John to follow. Walking down the dark, wet alley, Sherlock finally stopped in front of a dimly lit door and knocked three times, there was some movement from behind the door and then a eye hole was opened up. "Password" a gruff voice asked from behind the door, Sherlock replied "Stuffed Pig", the man on the other side grunted, then eye hole was closed again, the sounds of locks been undone was clearly heard through the door and then the door swung open hard. The guy matched his voice a six foot seven brute now stood in the hallway, He stood to the side, letting both John and Sherlock in.
, I just need to do this for him" Mycroft nods curtly and turns to John
John now focused on the mans clothing, he was naked on his top half apart from some leather straps that crossed over his chest and over his shoulders. The two metal hoops that joined the leather together, circled perfectly on his chest right around his nipples. On his bottom half he wore a pair of tight light grey jogging bottoms, and John very much doubted he was wearing pants as the out line of his cock was clearly visible, he quickly averted his eyes.
"You coming in, Captain Watson?"
He turns back to Peter, "I apologise for that", Sherlock bounces back up like nothing just happened, while Peter sits on the floor, not knowing what to do with himself, "yeah, Sorry mate", John apologises looking at the man on the floor, John offers Peter a hand up who hesitates, but excepts.
at this command and did as he was told, no sharp remark, nothing. John frowned wondering how Peter did it, and more to the point did Sherlock like this? John watched as Peter moved so his pelvis was lined up with Sherlock's arse and Peter adjusted Sherlock's hip position, pushing Sherlock's back so it arched more, "Like this, keep it like this" Peter spoke quietly.
When Sherlock pulled away, his brother was once again smiling, "I needed that, its been a while since my big brother has hugged me" Marcus's warm energy seemed to come back a bit, "so you will help" he looked expectantly at John and Sherlock, Sherlock smiles "of course" Sherlock says, then his face moulds back into his normal calculating look again,  "this is the most interesting case I have had in a while."
“Right.” John says, looking down at his hands.
“Oh, oh, dear.” She sniffed, wiping the tears from her eyes. “Can I get a picture of this?” she asked them.
His phone is laying next to his head, however. Sherlock reaches an arm up to grab it, socking himself square in the eye on the first attempt, but eventually managing to maneuver his limb correctly and grab the damned thing. Best to send a text to Mycroft. Just in case.
“Good.”
“I thought we had already discussed this.” From the change in John’s voice, Sherlock can tell he’s turned his head around to look at the back of Sherlock’s. “It doesn’t just have to be what you need. It can be what you want too.”
“Yes, do let’s.” Sherlock has no idea how he’s keeping his voice so even, but is pleased with it all the same.
“Sherlock?”
But Sherlock has already started to tune him out again. Too many other thoughts to focus on. Focus. FOCUS! Why can’t he just focus?! He needs a case! No. No no no no. That won’t do! He needs something more, something else. Drugs! He needs them!
“Who are you to tell me no? You’re not my mother.” Sherlock glares back at him,
John is standing in the hallway where Sherlock walks back and forth. He’s got his arms crossed and is watching Sherlock’s movements with very tired eyes.
“Wait.”
He takes a deep breath, looking at his room cast in the early grey of morning light. He doesn’t know what this means, having John spend the night in his bed, cradling him, caring for him. He doesn’t know what it means. But he does know how he feels about it. And that he doesn’t want it to stop.
The song that inspired this chapter was 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' by Iggy Pop.
After their Bad Santa was carted off, Sherlock turned to John to say something, but John just held up a hand. He needed at least a few minutes of silence before Sherlock started in on excuses and explanations on why he wasn’t in the wrong.
How odd.
“Ha!” she barked, leaning forward, hand over her heart, laughing as hard as she could. “Oh, Sherlock. What is that on your head!”
“Hey, don’t pass out yet!” Sherlock snaps at him.
Sherlock is in the living room, sat on a windowsill. Window open, cigarette in hand. He puffs away on the stick of tobacco until he is smoking filter, and then crushes the burning remnants into the teacup that he’d nearly filled.
“Well I do have
from them. How absurd! How unheard of! How--How--
Sherlock refuses to let John retreat.
“But what if,” Sherlock swallows down the bile that rises up at the question he needs to ask, “What if when I’m better. What if I don’t need it anymore.”
“I’d like to take you to bed every night. Hold you ‘til you fall asleep. Be there when you wake up.”
Sherlock was still confused. Too many pieces of data still floating about.
“Course you are.” John bites his lips and looks around them again.
“Why, John, must
John raised his brow as a smile still played on his lips, “Oh, a bit of snow will get you to quit, will it? Well then,” he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, “I can think of a few places we might move to.”
Sherlock thinks of spending the rest of the day in bed, but eventually decides against it. Without drugs in his system, the next best thing is to try and wrangle a case free from Lestrade’s grasp. Something over a seven. And then he’ll get another case, and then another. If he gets enough cases in a row he can forget about the fact that his heart is breaking.
“Or whatever.”
Weeks go by in this fashion, one puzzle after another. It’s a distraction. There is no exaltation or elation of the soul. Sherlock’s lethargy had worn off, but his world still remained in varying shades of grey. Even taste had become muted. Smell becoming a blur of sameness. Everything swirling together in a humdrum mix of apathy and agony.
They’d never really been close growing up.
Instantaneously, he’s thrown back in time to memories of Christmas dinners with his family—filled with laughter and stories shared around the table—and the sensation of falling asleep with a full belly in his nice, warm bed.
“It makes them feel incompetent, inept—which most of them are. My ability to deduce their lives makes them feel terribly exposed. It unnerves them. As a result, they tend to react negatively—an acute stress response. Thus, I’ve been told to ‘piss off’ quite frequently in the past.” He states flatly, swiftly pulling a cotton bud from his breast pocket.
However, despite his slight annoyance at not being asked his opinion, John couldn’t find a valid reason to disagree otherwise.
Something furry brushes past his feet, scurrying along the floorboard.
John sighs, running a hand through his slick hair.
“Um, Harry?” She glances at him, bottle halfway raised in the air. She lifts her brows.
Had he just been casually insulted?
Quickly shuffling backwards, John watches—wide-eyed, mouth agape—as it races out of the room. He scrambles for his phone, fumbling with it momentarily before getting a proper grip. Shining the screen towards the scuttling mouse—he tracks its movements with trembling hands.
John frowns at her retreating figure. Sighing, he goes to make his way across the creaking floorboards, but stops short in his tracks.
“That sound great, Harry. But I’m actually supposed to be hanging out with someone tomorrow. A local boy.” Harry’s shoulders sag imperceptibly as she nods curtly.
The corners of the boy’s bowed lips are pulled into an irritated scowl, his jaw clenched—exaggerating the angularity of his already sharp features.
John’s not sure who could be texting him. He’d blocked the numbers of his old school mates, and his remaining family’s contacts were already programed into his phone.
“Dunno, maybe it’s talking about the weather. Or taxes.” Harry’s shoulders bounce as she chuckles, shaking her head.
In an instant, he’s closing the distance between them, his long coat gracefully fanning out behind him. Once in front of John, the boy lowers himself into a crouch at John’s feet.
John stares at the boy blankly.
…..0…..
He unconsciously glances around the room, watching for any signs of movement.
“Oh. I—yes. Our time will have to be cut short.” He taps a single digit against his phone’s screen before putting it away.
“So, where’d you learn how to do it? The whole ‘deducing’ thing?” John inquires in the silence that follows. “They certainly don’t teach that sort of thing at school.” He adds jokingly.
Mentally calculating the distance from the nearby shops to the Pink Palace, John figures he has a solid twenty minutes or so to get the job done.
John wrinkles his nose in confusion, but writes the odd behavior off as another one of the boy’s unique mannerisms.
Exhaling shakily, he goes to get up—to do what, John’s not so sure. He’s not exactly equipped to handle the pest situation that they’ve apparently leased themselves into—and finding the cat with a knack for evading humans has been a disastrous endeavor thus far.
“No, I’d imagine not.” He hesitates, briefly glancing up at John.
, John observes.
Autumn leaves crunch under his footfalls as he sprints along the increasingly slick ground. Mud splashes up his pant legs and onto his coat as he rushes down a slope.
Right, the cat.
Buttons. In the place of Harry’s eyes, are buttons.
John thinks, squaring his shoulders. “Would you maybe—um, maybe want to hang out tomorrow?”
“Oh. I—” She tries.
In a way, it had sort of felt like he was an only child growing up. He’d been aware of her existence, of course—witnessing her experience milestones from afar. But there was always a disconnect between the two them. Harry’s attempt at getting closer to him now, after all that had transpired—in their lives, in the past few months—simultaneously causes his stomach to churn while his chest constricts with hope.
Harry’s drooping eyes flit over John standing in the doorway—her gaze darting back to her laptop just as quickly.
“Bless you.” John mumbles absently, offering his palm up.
Rummaging around their meager groceries—he finds a few slices of ham, wrapped in a plastic baggie. He digs into the opened ‘
John doesn’t move an inch, stunned.
“Grab a candle, Johnny.”
220A—the cellar downstairs, 221B—his and Harry’s current flat, 222B—the adjacent flat, and 223C—the remodeled attic above them. He’d yet to meet—or even see, any of their new neighbors.
John thinks about his mother’s cottage pies and sweet custards. He thinks about her crooked smile, gazing down at him with love. Her sandy locks pinned back from her face—revealing crow’s feet and wrinkled skin. Her soft voice, wrapping around him like a blanket, keeping him safe.
He opens his mouth—whether to accept or decline, John’s not quite sure. But then midnight curls invade his mind, along with a set of two piercing blue eyes—and the decision is made for him.
It doesn’t budge.
A sudden clattering behind him catches his attention, freezing John in place.
The cat is licking between its little paws, eyes shut in concentration, sitting near John’s feet. A small puddle is gathering beneath the animal, its spiky fur dripping onto the floor. Nearly indiscernible tremors wrack through its body.
“Brilliant.” Sherlock utters softly.
The strange thing is—he
John waves her off, reaffirming his grip on his cane.
Sherlock, he surmises, might be one of the most interesting individuals he’s ever met.
John glances over.
box until he finds a short glass. Going to the tap, he fills it up halfway.
Harry nods, leaning back in her chair.
A flicker of movement catches his attention from behind one of the panes. When he looks over, his mouth falls open in shock.
“So let’s dig in, shall we?”
The boy comes to stand in front of John, lifting his chin. He’s clearly waiting for something—a reaction, perhaps. John certainly has no qualms about giving him one.
Harry shakes her head, huffing slightly.
John blinks rapidly, his face scrunching in bewilderment.
The boy possesses an outstanding intellect, far beyond his years. He can hold a stimulating conversation, albeit with an endearing pinch of awkwardness, that doesn’t inevitably veer into vulgarity—a rare find amongst boys their age.
against the muddy terrain as he absentmindedly wanders around the courtyard behind the house. Grimacing in discomfort, he wriggles his toes in a vain attempt to keep his blood flowing—the rubber is terribly snug around his feet.
When Harry asks him what it says, taking the cap off of her second beer, he lamely tells her something about success and luck.
He gasps, head snapping up.
Dashing across the room on the balls of his feet, he sincerely hopes all of the commotion hadn’t woken Harry.
He hesitantly begins shuffling towards the chair furthest from the Other Harry. Abruptly, she holds up one finger with a considering look on her agreeable face.
with SH.
John shuffles to the sink and sets the kettle down. He turns on the tap, watching detachedly as the water fills the pot.
He knows he must look like a proper mess. The bottoms of his pants are wet from scraping against the ground. Patches of dried mud are splashed all over his yellow raincoat. Strands of his hair are windswept, scattered about in various directions.
Something isn’t adding up.
During his deployments, when stationed in a new, foreign territory, their father would find the time to visit a local tourist shop—and buy both Harry and John a souvenir.
“Did the movers get all your stuff upstairs alright? They didn’t forget anything in the truck—or break something, did they?”
He takes the changes in with a surprising amount of ease—he’s already getting used to the nuances of his odd dreams.
John quickly surmises, jumping over a lone, tarnished wheel.
“You think so?” Sherlock asks carefully, eyes flickering between his sample and John’s face. He drops the cotton bud into the bag and seals it tightly.
human.
Sighing, he turns his phone around and looks down at the screen. Thankfully, there aren’t any cracks—only Sherlock’s most recent message displayed on his home page.
The door slides shut, the lock clicking in place soon after.
Thanks for reading!
He freezes, wincing at the loud chime of his phone in the silence. John holds his breath—praying that he won’t have to give chase to the skittish feline.
John huffs amusedly, clumsily getting to his feet.
The trembling sky above roars and flashes violently.
When John reflects on his childhood, memories of his father are usually unclear or hard to come by, unlike the ones involving his mother and Harry. He’d catch himself sometimes, staring off at nothing—attempting to piece together the hazy flashes of a man with a bearded face and crooked nose. Afterwards, he’d inexplicably feel too guilty to ask his family if what his mind had envisioned was even real.
…..0…..
Peering into the quaint kitchen, he squints in an attempt to distinguish the bleary shapes littering the space from one another. Dwindling rays of light—peering through dark, angry clouds—shine through the spacious window, casting a grey sheen throughout the room. But it’s still nearly impossible to see without his phone.
“I almost forgot—how inconsiderate of me. What would you like to drink?” He swallows against the dryness in his throat.
He looks down, scanning the screen for a moment, before his thumbs are flying.
He thinks, even as he reaches out to touch the luminescent walls forming the cocoon-like tunnel, and runs his fingers along the soft, cool texture. It feels as real as the stuttering breath in his lungs or the cold sweat that’s broken out on the palms of his hands.
, even though you shouldn’t have.” Sherlock hums noncommittally.
…..0…..
Sherlock smiles in that peculiar way of his.
John frowns—throat tightening as he tries to swallow back the strange wave of hurt threatening to choke him.
“Your rainboots. No sign of wear and tear, no discoloration. Tight around your toes and heels. They haven’t been stretched properly. New, never worn.” The words are flying out of his mouth in rapid-fire succession as he strokes his fingertips along the tops of John’s boots.
Being twelve years old—with their father’s mind already made up and Harry acting as his legal guardian—John knew he didn’t have much of a say in the decision.
John blinks owlishly.
He nods with a newfound enthusiasm and takes a seat.
The boy huffs exasperatedly, rolling his eyes. He unclasps his hands from behind his back and reveals a magnifying glass, held between gloved fingers.
John frowns at the sad, blue boy.
Poking around in the grease-soaked carton, John stabs a piece of teriyaki with his fork and brings it to his mouth, chewing it slowly. The glazed chicken against his tastebuds is familiar—dull. Swallowing, he grimaces at the unpleasant film of grease that covers the inside of his mouth and throat.
Despite the odd circumstances of their exchange, chatting with Sherlock makes his somewhat unnerving situation seem less daunting. Like he’s not ambling along in an eerie house, as the rain pounds against the roof with a breakneck intensity—all alone.
Breathing in wonder, he picks the chilled treat up and takes a long sip. Creamy, icy goodness hits his tongue, and he briefly shuts his eyes, basking in the taste.
John chuckles quietly, lips pulling into a grin that hurts his cheeks.
Catching his friends talking about him behind his back—calling him a
“You’ve got to be joking me.” He says aloud in disbelief.
Just as he’s about to lower his hand, and studiously ignore the disappointment building in his chest, the boy hesitantly reaches out and grasps it in one of his own.
Growing up, their father was often absent due to his job as an army doctor—to the point where John became accustomed to not seeing him for several months out of the year.
It’s a small thing, really—can’t be more than two-and-a-half feet tall and just as wide. The parlor’s dull wallpaper presses tightly against the door, creating a clear impression that leaves no imagination as to what’s beneath it. A small keyhole is centered on the left side with no handle to twist.
He frowns, looking at the small creature.
“I am—a scientist, that is. I specialize in forensics. When I grow bored—which is a common occurrence—I’ll conduct recreational experiments to pass the time. Microbiology is one of the fields I find most stimulating.” He says lowly, his voice slightly muffled by the wind blowing past them.
…..0…..
He takes in a deep breath.
, John muses.
Twin black, gleaming circles that remind John of his mother’s sewing kit, or the little pawn shop back in London next to his old house—the one that displayed antique dolls in their windows. Something about their frozen faces and blank stares always unsettled John, but he’d comfort himself with the knowledge that they weren’t real.
Fortunately, the room isn’t completely enveloped in darkness—as faint glimmers of grey light shine through the window.
…..0…..
“Be back soon.” She throws over her shoulder.
Down the hall and to the right is the master bedroom. Harry’s room.
John swallows, pulling two mugs from the box that clatter against other bundled ceramics.
“I bet. Thought it was supposed to be sunny in Sussex.”
John pauses, eyeing her warily.
John trudges around the upstairs, cautiously treading between each room—like he’s expecting a stranger to pop out and yell
Gasping, he twirls around—wildly waving his phone into the darkness, but he doesn’t see anything move again. His heart leaps in his chest as he swallows roughly.
“Ah, here it is. Odd little thing.” She mumbles under her breath as she turns around.
“He’s stationed in Afghanistan at the moment. I miss him loads.” John inhales deeply. He watches his breath cloud as he slowly releases it.
She rarely looks at him anymore, if she can help it.
John huffs through his nose, lips flattening into a thin line.
He pauses, thinking of the hollow, stale rooms he’d explored. Begrudgingly, he adds:
“Yeah?” She takes a long swig from her beer. He hides a grimace by swiping a napkin along his mouth.
Scanning the nearly pitch-black room with squinted eyes, he spots a dark blur running into the crevice between the newly unlocked mystery door and—John now knows—the brick wall residing on the other side.
…..0…..
…..0…..
John exhales shakily, lowering his cane to the ground—and freezes marginally when the boy’s glamouring eyes flit to it. However—John notices with a twinge of disbelief—the boy doesn’t fixate on it, doesn’t outright ask why a healthy twelve-year old needs a walking stick, and gives it the same look of disinterest that he’s silently assessed the rest of John with.
“I just—would it be possible to open it—the door?” Harry sighs, but she doesn’t seem terribly annoyed by his persistence.
Pressing an ear to the door, he listens intently. He knocks once—twice—against the wood. The sound that echoes in his ear is hollow—like he’s dropped a coin into a bottomless well. Soft, hushed wisps of air push against the wood, like there’s a draft coming from somewhere on the other side.
The other boy probably doesn’t have much experience in socializing with others. Likely doesn’t interact with kids his own age, as a result of being homeschooled—
“What happened to the bloody lights?” He hears Harry exclaim nosily—along with the sound of crinkling plastic and the front door slamming shut behind her.
“Well, actually—now that I think of it, I didn’t see the box with my snow globes. Do you know where they put it?” Harry stills fractionally, mouth pulling down slightly.
would suit the noise better.
John watches discreetly, while the back of his throat burns—and it has nothing to do with the acidic soy sauce coating his food.
John thinks, tentatively mirroring the boy.
“Oh. So you—” Sherlock talks over him, still typing furiously.
“Are you feeling up to that after the drive? Your leg isn’t acting up?” The brace on her left wrist catches the light as she crosses her arms, tersely awaiting his answer.
John’s reminded of the way he used to brace himself before walking down the hallways at school—after returning with a limp, and a tremor to boot. The endless whispers and stares would slowly eat away at him, from the moment he walked in the building to the second he got home.
Quickly regaining his footing, John assesses the immediate area—frantically searching for a feasible route to evade the aggravated creature.
Just then, a deafeningly-loud clap of thunder roars throughout the sky, its vibrations shaking the floor.
Gritting his teeth against the sudden fury that threatens to rip its way out of him—either through enraged screams or mournful sobs—he carefully executes the breathing exercises his therapist taught him. The harsh pants he exhales gradually devolve into shaky sighs.
, he thinks with feigned optimism.
John cheeks warm under his attention. Clearing his throat, John gestures noncommittedly towards himself, before shoving his hand into his coat pocket.
Brows furrowed, he presses even closer against the surface—head turned to the side, facing the windows.
“No. Just stepped in a puddle, or two.” He offers with a quirk of his lips, looking around the kitchen.
And with their father deployed, every month—he sends Harry a check to cover the bills. John’s seen the envelopes for himself, marked in their father’s handwriting with no return address.
“Alright, everything’s just about done. Take a seat wherever you’d like. You must be absolutely starving, John.” The Other Harry smiles broadly with earnestly raised brows, gesturing to the table.
John gives Harry gives a half-hearted smile in return, turning his gaze to the door.
John briefly considers the fortune. He shrugs good-naturedly and cracks open his own cookie.
. He thinks, levering himself up. Carefully navigating his way to the bedroom door, he uses the bright phone screen to light his way.
“Christ, what happened to you? Did you take a spill?” Her face twists as she registers her own words. John’s face stays carefully blank, even as a flare of annoyance spikes in the pit of his stomach.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, slanted mouth dissolving into a thin line. He pockets his sample before reaching into his coat and producing a mobile phone.
John hadn’t seen Clara since before their mother passed away, nearly two months ago. He could only assume Harry and her longtime girlfriend had broken up—and maybe for good this time around, after their rollercoaster of a relationship. Even when they had little tiffs, it only took a few days before they were back together again.
The chime of his phone in the stillness of the room makes him jolt. He looks down at the screen.
Large, dark clouds blanket the sky, seemingly stuck in a frozen state of unrest, moments before a storm. There’s a heavy, grey fog billowing down over the thicket of pine trees and into the sunken quarry where the apartments are tucked away. John can’t see anything beyond the rolling hills in the distance and the dirt trail they rode in on.
John musters up a small, but genuine smile.
He gapes, simultaneously baffled and awestruck—truly unable to believe what he’s seeing. Vigorously rubbing at his eyes does nothing to dissipate the ethereal sight, except for momentarily blurring his vision.
of mushrooms—and John happens to be standing directly in the center of said formation.
Exhaling softly, he shuts his eyes and tries to fall back asleep.
Reaching the bottom of the staircase, he snaps his head in each direction, squinting into the darkness. A blur of movement flashes in his periphery, and he pivots sharply.
Pitching forward, he blinding gropes the floor for his cane. Unable to locate it, he twists around—and John’s attention is suddenly captured by the sight in front of him.
“Um, what—what have you got? I’m fine with a glass of water.” She gently bats a hand in his direction, smiling admonishingly as she gestures towards the fridge.
Now—as he takes in his surroundings, he decides he was exceedingly wrong in his assumptions.
The cat. It was just the cat.
And yet, the boy doesn’t seem offended by John’s lack of social etiquette. He shifts impatiently, leaning forward on the balls of his feet—frowning at John, like he’s being purposefully obtuse.
Panting, he realizes the only things he can hear are his own labored breaths and the wind whistling through the nearby woods.
“Yeah, alright. That’s fine.”
A black cat is perched behind the glass.
He thinks, taking a bite of his eggroll.
When he finally settles down, his laughter trickling away, John holds out a hand. The boy freezes, eyes flitting from John’s hand to his face, then back to his hand.
. You’re just in time for dinner. Come in and take a seat while I finish up.”
He’s got nowhere left to run.
The glow of his phone reflects off of the brass chandelier hanging from the ceiling as he passes under it. Three of the five candleholders are empty.
“Who’s there? Come out, right now.” He says as steadily as he can.
Loosely held between her fingers is an old-fashioned black key. The bow is formed into the shape of a sewing button, while the tip gleams sharply in the light of the kitchen—reflecting off the whites of Harry’s eyes.
John warily observes, even as a staggering relief floods his system.
Back at the kitchen table, he silently reads his fortune as Harry re-lights one of the candles that’s gone out in their absence.
“Doesn’t make much sense, does it?” She scoffs, lifting the piece of paper before tossing it aside.
He sits there for a few moments, after the mouse is long gone—heart pounding furiously in his ears.
The corners of his slightly chapped lips pull upwards. He inhales deeply, closing his eyes.
He bites his lip, considering if he should let the stray into his room—noting the lack of collar around its neck. For all he knows, it could be feral, and possibly scratch him. John supposes if he ignores it, the cat would be fine outdoors, left to its own devices. The roof partially juts out over the window, which would provide the cat with a decent-enough shelter from the ongoing storm.
Once his brain wracks together enough oxygen to properly function again, John realizes that it’s probably not polite to gawk at someone after they’ve introduced themselves.
John thinks—just a touch hysterically.
Lightning flashes in the sky behind him.
A heavy bang reverberates through the flat. He jumps away from the wall entirely, snapping his head towards the abrupt noise.
Rain no longer sprinkles against the glass paneling, leaving a clear view of the outside for his viewing. The stars dance amongst the sky, glimmering next to the full moon.
There, where the mouse had been hiding, behind the tall, cardboard box—is a door.
“Additionally, you’re meant to tuck your pant legs into your boots, unless you intend to sully your entire wardrobe. Assuming you’re not completely daft, I’d hope this was an ignorant choice rather than an intentional one.”
given their close proximity to your previous place of residence for the sake of convenience. Therefore, London.”
“Yes, John. The most dangerous game of all. We’ll be in touch soon.”
John’s old mattress has been placed on the frame of a small four-poster bed. There’s no canopy resting atop the columns, which makes it look peculiar—like it’s naked. His brown suitcase rests near the fireplace. The hearth is covered with ash, and the metal brackets are devoid of wood. A long shelf is built into the wall next to the door—John can picture displaying his books there, though he doesn’t have many.
Oh, a
“Sorry, didn’t catch that. What’d you say?” Sherlock steadfastly ignores him, intently focusing on his mushrooms. Violent splotches of red begin to sprout from his pale cheeks.
He gasps, nearly dropping his phone in fright as he jumps back, painfully knocking his head into the mantle. Hissing, he rubs the aching spot. Breath hitching in his throat, he squints—eyes following the tiny blob scampering towards the other side of the room.
Vicious snarls fill the air as his throw connects with something decidedly
They’d arrived at the Pink Palace around three in the afternoon, and admittedly—he’d been a bit underwhelmed.
“Right. Thanks. I’ll probably put them on top of the fireplace, like I did at our house.” She nods stiffly, fiddling with the label that’s peeling off her beer as she chews. After a moment or two, John looks down, sighing quietly as he pushes his food around.
“Right.” She says slowly. “Well, don’t fill up. I’m headed out to pick up some takeaway—Chinese. I’ll get your usual.”
He shakes his head, sipping on his glass of coke.
The boy halts five feet from the edge of the cliff, pointing down at the apartments.
Going over to his suitcase, he undoes the clasps and pries it open. After a moment or two of sifting through his things, he finds what he needs.
, he observes.
Brows furrowed, John leans in.
His sister is typing stiffly, her brace immobilizing the full use of her left hand. Her hair is pinned up messily, allowing a few flyaway strands to stick out of her bun. The dark circles under her eyes are prominent—striking against her ashen skin.
John realizes belatedly.
John frowns at the back of Sherlock’s head.
, John thinks disbelievingly, grinning.
He’s sitting upright, reaching into the inside of his coat. A plastic baggie materializes from one of his many pockets.
flat, just as he’d left it. Looking back at this jarring room, he rapidly realizes—while a stunning imitation, this isn’t his own parlor at all.
Straight ahead it is.
John smiles unabashedly, nodding in earnest.
“Course it was. It was extraordinary. Bloody brilliant.” The boy ducks his head, glancing away and back just as quickly. His pink mouth twitches.
He shuffles along the plain, oval rug placed beneath their coffee table. Even without the proper visibility, John knows that on one of the legs—are his haphazardly carved initials, something he’d gotten into trouble for when he was younger. He mentally laughs at the memory.
…..0…..
He rattles the information off monotonously, but his eyes are positively alight as he does so.
The room is fairly large—which is made even more apparent by their lack of belongings. Various cardboard boxes litter the off-white linoleum floor, stacked against the pale yellow counters. Their old kettle sits on the stove, unused. The kitchen tiles gleam from the smattering of grey light that peers in through the spacious window set above the sink.
John knows for a fact that Harry kept her sizable collection of keychains in a shoebox beneath her bed at the old flat. He briefly wonders if she’ll choose the same spot in this house for her keepsakes.
A blur of movement flashes in his peripheral. Whipping his head to the side, he frowns. There’s nothing to see but a few dried leaves scraping along the ground. John shakes his head at himself—shoulders marginally losing their tension.
“I don’t think I’ll ever accept having to pay those.” She gestures towards his hand. “Go on, then. What’s yours say?”
It’s beautiful—entrancing.
Her voice is stuffy when she speaks again, her tone amused.
The door remains shut.
Harry isn’t there when he walks in. Her laptop is gone, her empty glass discarded in the sink.
John lets out a huff, pursing his lips as he tugs on the frame again, with all his might.
He cell chimes a second after he sends his own reply. He glances down, brows furrowed.
“You’re not my sister—you’re different.” He manages, exhaling shakily.
“Right then. I don’t have any kibble—” The ball of fur grumbles.
In the end, John figured a little change might do them some good.
“Oh, sorry. Didn’t mean to step in the middle of your, er—experiment. Hope I didn’t mess it up.” Careful to avoid smushing the spotted fungus, he awkwardly steps back until he’s out of the circle.
…..0…..
John narrows his eyes, huffing incredulously.
John’s brows pull together in a frown, remembering the flow of air he’d heard with his ear pressed to the wood.
“Harry, I’m gonna walk around for a bit.” His sister stops speaking with the mover, but only turns her head in John’s direction, eyes firmly locked on the ground between them.
He swiftly turns and trudges up the stone path, focused on putting one foot in front of the other. The black, rusted gate squeaks unpleasantly as he treks past the steely bars.
Gingerly making his way over to the sink, he comes to a stop in front of the windowpanes—immediately spotting the courtyard he’d wandered around in earlier. Further along—dark, bristly pine trees are scattered across the uneven landscape. In the distance, a large mist rolls through the forest, blurring anything beyond the horizon.
He pulls his yellow raincoat tighter around himself, shifting in place. His oatmeal-colored sweater underneath provides little reprieve against the cold, but John figures he can handle it. Despite the chilly temperature, he wants to explore the surrounding outdoors—a new mystery for him to uncover—even if the promise of dry clothes and hot tea call to him.
It smells exactly like his mother’s cooking, something he’ll never forget for as long as he lives. His chest aches with a deep longing even as he licks his lips, practically salivating.
“—I’ll whack you on the head and then neither of us will be happy.”
He thinks, shaking his head.
“The brand is cheap—an inexperienced buyer purchased these. Urbanites typically avoid donning rainboots in their daily lives, even in the most abysmal of conditions, so it’s highly unlikely that you’d possess this type of footwear unless you were traveling to the countryside, which you obviously haven’t done until now. Therefore, you’re from a city.” John nods, dumbfounded.
“Want to come with me? Scope out the town, maybe get some lunch while we’re there?” Her leg bounces up and down underneath the table as she continues typing on her laptop, eyes glued to the screen.
He warily looks over his shoulder—just in time to witness Harry’s shaking fingers slide around her vodka, before she tilts her head back and gulps it down in one go.
, he supposes, timidly crawling along the cushiony surface. It feels as though he’s navigating across a waterbed, as the springy material yields to his shifting weight and pressing hands.
John turns around, leaning back against the counter.
He takes it with a small smile, momentarily distracted from his thoughts of the door. He remembers doing this sort of thing with their mother, on the rare occasions that she’d order out—and her spouting off inane scenarios to make sense of their often random fortunes.
John nods slowly, watching his sister closely. Harry keeps her head down, twirling the crisp noodles around her fork and stuffing them in her mouth.
John stops cold, squeezing his eyes shut.
He kneels there in the dark, re-reading each text—thoroughly baffled. He has an array of questions he’d like answered, but he figures he’ll start off with the basics.
It was their father’s idea, she told him. Given that only Harry and John would be living in the house together—with their father’s recent deployment with no definitive timeframe and their mother gone, he thought it would be best for them to downsize.
…..0…..
It’s pouring down rain by the time John trudges back to the Pink Palace, finding solace under the porch’s awning.
His sister—however, isn’t what he’d expected to make an appearance next.
He jumps as his phone pings. Something to his left scurries past him.
“Yes, your hidden assailant. The one you so urgently fled from.” The boy says dryly, swatting an impatient hand through the air. “Not a mountain lion, or a fox—and decidedly not any other nonsensical predator your mind has irrationally conjured in its heightened state of fear. Incidentally, neither of the aforementioned mammals are native to this area.”
Pangs of anguish pulsate through his body. His eyes sting sharply, blurring his vision. Blinking rapidly, he cranes his neck up, sighing.
—you in here, little guy?” John whispers. He’s unsure of why he’s lowering his voice, but it feels appropriate in the permeating silence.
He tunes back into the conversation when Harry clears her throat.
“Oh. That’s too bad.”
Eventually, the boy’s inquisitive gaze drags up to meet John’s.
Barren trees are aligned into neat rows on either side of the path, curving downward—their sharp, twisting branches extended like claws itching to scoop John up. Several pieces of old gardening tools lay scattered about—left behind by those who previously harvested from the once lively crops.
“I’m glad you think so, I made it myself. Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m famished.” She beams with her pointed, ruby lips.
Gritting his teeth, he tries again, holding his breath. He plants a knee on the bench, pushing against it for leverage.
Entranced, he watches the crisp, golden roast glisten under the kitchen lights as the Other Harry transfers the pot onto the stove.
Lightning flashes in the sky, casting grotesque shadows along the floor. John wraps an arm around his middle, shivering against the slight chill sneaking up on him.
he was so different from his peers in the first place. But John doesn’t care about Sherlock fitting into a mold for other children to deem acceptable.
He blurrily reaches over to the nightstand and fumbles for his phone. Brows pinching together in a frown, he rapidly blinks at the sudden brightness from the screen until his eyes stop stinging.
Seated at the dining table centered in the middle of the room is Harry—typing away on her laptop. From the smell alone, he suspects she’s been drinking. Her half-empty glass of vodka only confirms his theory.
“I can’t imagine why anyone would ever say something like that. I could’ve been from Bristol or Manchester for all you knew. But then you did—you
John’s feet automatically take him to the kitchen as he types—it seems as though his mind has already mapped out this particular route in the house.
He looks down at the floor.
John laughs quietly, both at Sherlock’s formal tone—even over text, and at his unwavering self-assurance. Being a genius probably does that to a person’s confidence.
He chews the inside of his cheek, carefully typing his response.
John gulps, his eyes widening like saucers. Stumbling backwards, breath stuttering—he pivots sharply and begins to run.
She looks so small, sitting under the single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. Guilt floods through John at his earlier thoughts.
A nameless dread trickles down his spine unbidden. Gulping, he lets out a deep breath—and pulls as hard as he can.
Nevertheless, the cat is nowhere to be found.
“How, um—how did you know I was from the city? From London?” The boy snaps out of his reverie, ducking his head and pointing at John’s feet.
Adults are probably favorable to the children Sherlock has to deal with, when they encounter his intelligence.
A moment later, the boy’s shoulders begin shaking—a deep, gradual chuckle resonating from his throat.
He blows out a heavy sigh. He’s got the thing now—though he’s not exactly sure what his plan is.
Everything seems brighter somehow, more colorful—newer. The floors shine, as if they’ve recently been waxed. The sofa and coffee table and rug are positioned similarly, but there are no stains or scratches or tatters to indicate their weathered conditions.
, John thinks with a grimace, shifting some of his weight off of his bad leg. It’s beginning to throb.
The power promptly goes out.
“I’d recommend acquiring a new pair at the earliest convenience before they inevitably become waterlogged. The insulation leaves much to be desired, I’m sure. The quality of the outer material is appalling.” John barely bites back the startled giggle that threatens to burst past his lips at the boy’s disgusted scowl.
“I’m alright, thanks.” He calmly grits out—heat spreading across his cheeks.
Now shrouded from his view by an opaque layer of fog, John can only imagine the cliff he’d stood on with Sherlock not half an hour ago—the enigmatic boy who he would apparently be seeing more of. A fluttering warmth dances in his stomach without his permission.
“Unless your family was extremely particular in their selection of moving companies—I’d say not, based on the less than stellar reviews they’ve received in the past—they clearly chose
“Your room’s on the second floor, by the way. Just turn left at the top of the stairs, and it’s the door at the end of the hall—second on the right.” She mutters flatly.
, John thinks, heart pounding furiously.
The rusty hinges creak nosily as he turns the doorknob.
Harry chuckles weakly.
John breathes out as steadily as he can.
Hints of a white button-down peek out from beneath the boy’s billowy trenchcoat. A navy wool scarf wraps taut around his neck. The bottom of his slacks and dress shoes are impeccably spotless.
When they finally pry the door open, after the lock turns with a resounding
Socially, he didn't have much to fret over. John used to be quite popular, before—having played scrum-half on the school's rugby team. His teammates, John faintly remembers, were always good for a laugh when he needed one—banded together by the comradery of exhausting practices and shared competitiveness.
Thunder rumbles throughout the darkening clouds hanging over their heads.
Hello everyone! This is the first fic of "The Paranormal Detective" series, where John and Sherlock meet, grow up together, and consistently find themselves in AU situations inspired by popular thriller/horror movies, starting off with "Coraline" (2009). *re-uploaded after some errors*
John’s stomach churns in response, but he manages a wane smile.
Blowing out a breath, he absently rubs at his chest. He’s had enough excitement for one day.
“Were you the one following me, earlier—in the woods?” The cat meows. John blinks, brows furrowing.
John slams the window shuts behind it, exhaling harshly. He takes a moment to catch his breath, plopping down on the bench.
(See the end of the chapter for
He crosses the room to his suitcase, blindly discarding his dirty coat on the floor while toeing off his shoes. As he goes to kneel down—out of the corner of his eye, he spots a black blur dart across the window.
In John’s case, he has his snow globes—little trinkets able to perfectly encapsulate a frozen moment in time within their plastic globes and miniature sceneries.
“Definitely. It’s refreshing, actually—meeting a bloke who’s interested in more than just sports, or whatever video game is out—or girls.” Sherlock mumbles something under his breath—John only catches
The cat is gone when John returns to his room.
A pinch of unease trickles down his spine as an icy wind rushes past him, ruffling his short, ash blonde hair.
Ignoring the pressure constricting around his chest, John enters the house.
Biting his lip, he looks at the other boy.
John frowns slightly, hoping Sherlock hadn’t read his flippancy as a dismissal.
, he thinks, as the hair on the back of his neck stands up. After a moment or two, John shakes his head at himself—he’d been wrong.
He shifts so he’s sitting on the floor, just as his right leg starts to aches.
He looks down at his bad leg.
Turning onto his side, he buries his face into his pillow, smiling widely.
Somber shades of blues and greys swirls together, surrounding a little blonde boy standing at the center of the piece, donning an old schoolboy outfit. A shattered expression of devastation is frozen on his cherub face as he looks down at his fallen ice cream. His arm is halfway raised, his tiny hand still clutching the empty cone—like he can’t believe what’s just happened.
Their mother had been the homemaker of the family. John remembers coming home after tiring days at school, to the smell of her homemade meals wafting through the house and filling it with warmth.
The raging storm outside has lessened—he can only hear soft patterings of rain hitting the roof now. Shimmers of moonlight shine into the room, casting a faint glow across the room. The winding cracks on the ceiling seem to stretch further in the dark.
Sorry for the delay, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I will start getting to the meat of the story soon I just need to build it up first.
When the cab pulled up on a long busy looking street, Sherlock hopped out, quickly sticking his head back in and looking at John, "once you have payed John, wait here for me, I wont be long" and with that he disappeared down into an alley, John sighed and payed the cabby. Once the cab driver left John waited for Sherlock to come back.
John finds out about Sherlock and Peter's past, while he finds himself in an awkward position.
". He looks up at Sherlock, "The strippers that have been getting killed" John said. Sherlock gives John, one of his uncommon "well done" smiles, and turns to look past john at the door, steeping his hands under his chin in thought, "yes but the news papers didn't know, that some of them, weren't just stripper but also sex workers, and my brother is worried about them, he cares deeply about everyone that works at his club, as he had once been in their positions too." Sherlock brow furrowed as he speaks, "hence why he contacted me to help, as he knows the police, if they find out, will put him in prison too", Sherlock looks back over to John with a hint of pleading in his eyes, its clear that he's worried about his brother being next and the murders have only been getting worse.
When John had finished changing he look in the mirror, it was far from what he would normally wear but we had to admit it did suit him. Sherlock did a great job of picking the outfit, well of course he did he's Sherlock. John had also spiked his short hair up a bit, just to add more volume and to play the part a bit more. when he was about to leave his room, to go see Sherlock, he remembered his that he should get his gun before leaving, just encase. Pulling out of his draw and putting it in his pocket, he reminded him self and they were going to be helping with catching a criminal and it would be needed.
From, CMP<3
I'm revisiting my work, i have found new inspiration and i'm updating my work and adding new chapters.
John and Sherlock, go into the main club and down to the sex workers room, for Sherlock's training.
True to his word Sherlock was back at Six 'o'clock exactly, he had a bag in one hand and had clearly been to see Greg as he had the photos from the crime scenes and statements tucked under his arm. John who was sitting at the desk, typing away on his blog, had been startled by Sherlock sudden entrance, "bloody hell Sherlock, don't go barging in the flat like that" John exclaimed. Sherlock who looked like he hadn't listened to a word John had just said, frantically took his scarf and coat off, and chucked the bag he had been carrying over to John who caught it and now was inspecting the contents. mean while Sherlock was scattering the picture and other thing he had got over the table to look at the later. Sherlock happy that he had everything,  walks back into the living room and leans against the door frame, watching John look into the bag.
I'm revisiting my work, i have found new inspiration and i'm updating my work and adding new chapters.
"you-u look fine-e Sherlock", he spluttered, Sherlock looked at him for a moment, clearly not sure John was been truthful but nodded anyway, "Right let's go John or we will be late to meet my brother".
"He's gay" Sherlock eerily calm voice cut threw Johns words.
Once in the club they entered a long hall way, Sherlock walked swiftly down the corridor until they came to a door simply labelled, "The Boss", the name was carved into a brass plate on the door. Sherlock knocked again, this time to the rhythm of "A shave and a haircut", a deep caramel voice was heard from inside the room, "come in".
John's Trousers: https://www.moss.co.uk/ted-baker-tailored-fit-black-trousers-966060515?s=googleshoppingppc&gclid=Cj0KEQjw3PLnBRCpo8PCoaGM99MBEiQAppRuC99aQWihv056yVHmAGHs2ne6Ij4S3lOfLQsyFrRKZiQaAhy38P8HAQ
In the centre against the right wall, was a large stage, with a runway strip going about half way to the bar. It had stage lights pointing down at it and bright white lights lit up the runway strip and that was the main stage. At curtain parts of the night, strippers would come on and preform, Marcus had said, everyone had favourites and would gather round differently depending on who was preforming. Next to the centre stage there where tables and arm chairs. The front row of the tables and chairs were reserved for V.I.P's, people who had payed extra to sit closer, but the seat further back where for anyone who wanted to sit there and didn't cost extra. There where a couple more booths scattered round to sides of the stage, so people could have private conversations or admire the strippers from a distance. The bar was flat up against the left wall, slightly more to the left side of the stage, making it a bit more off set, as to not draw attention way from the centre stage.
"what's this for?" John asked. The clothes inside weren't cheep and not exactly johns type of clothing style, they were tight fitted and diffidently trendy. Then John realised, "these are for the club case, we are going undercover", Sherlock gives john another, small "well done" smile.
He gives John’s hand a weak squeeze, before tightening his grip into a steadier hold.
“What else could they possibly say?” A corner of the boy’s mouth pulls upward as his eyes dart to John’s.
John tucks his head, huffing amusedly.
“A privately-owned business, with only two office locations—Chelmsford and London.” He pivots around, slotting his hands behind his back. “They don’t accept jobs outside of a 50-mile radius. It’s approximately 45 miles from here to London, 70 from Chelmsford—you used the London office.”
However, things changed for John in more ways than one, after the accident.
” Harry recites, finishing slower than she’d started. She squints at the paper, pressing her lips together before looking over at John.
It’s the sitting room—his flat’s sitting room, the same exact room he’d just been in. Well, maybe not
Wet, matted fur covers the cat’s lithe form. Long, silvery whiskers jut out from its narrow face. The cat is staring right at John, nearly lost in the shadows—if not for its azure eyes glowing amidst the dark, showering skies overhead.
John slowly brings his robe up and lightly pats a sleeve against the cat’s body, absorbing most of the moisture from its fur. The cat doesn’t protest, basking in John’s delicate touch, allowing itself to be thoroughly dried off.
The power’s on in this flat, as evidenced by the orange glow shining from the kitchen into the corridor, as opposed to the drab, fluorescent lighting of his own kitchen.
He absently wonders just how long it’s been since this door was last opened.
I hope everyone enjoyed this first chapter. As we go on, the plot will begin to thicken as John soon learns that not all is as it seems with the Pink Palace. Drop a comment and let me know what you thought! Updates to come soon. Thank you!
Kneeling down, he blindly opens his suitcase, feeling around in the side mesh compartment. Eventually, his fingers enclose around a cool, compact item.
—was enough for John to cut all ties with them. Finishing the last few months of school had been a lonely ordeal.
Above the mantle of the fireplace, a peculiar painting—one that the previous tenant must have left behind—catches John’s eye. He pauses, shining the light closer to the canvas, studying the scene.
Absentmindedly, he wonders if they’re the type to wave a friendly hand in passing, or angrily knock on the door to complain about nonexistent noises.
Giving the hallway a cursory glance and spotting nothing, John slowly limps down the stairs. He grips the railing with one hand—clutching his cane and phone in the other.
He think bitterly, walking over to the fridge.
Sherlock stands up quickly, anger clear as day on his face, "I was there for him when you weren't and you don't think I should help my own brother?!"
John moved his head to look at Peter, he seemed to have the same thought process but kept a professional air about him, John wondered what relationship he and Sherlock had, he spoke up, "So Peter, how do you know Sherlock?", Sherlock and Peter both seemed to hesitate in their actions before Peter chuckled and rubbed the back of his head turning his head to John, "I don't know if its my place to talk about it mate but me and Sherlock go away back",
It took a while to process in Johns head but once it did he couldn't help just exclaim, "YOUR BROTHERS OWNS A SEX CLUB!" John couldn't believe it, a Holmes boy was a owner of a sex club in Soho and here he was thinking they were all void of feeling any type of sexual attraction, to well anyone! "Yes Dr. Watson, he is but could you refrain from shouting and keep your voice down" Mycroft gave him a disapproving look and John silently apologised.
Mycroft buts in "He took up a hobby, of sorts, one that our parent disproved of and he was kicked out" he looks down at the floor, "I still payed close attention to him, making sure he was okay, something I still do", Sherlock looked up sharply at his words, "
Sherlock was wearing his normal tight purple top, but it wasn't that what shocked John, it was the tight latex leggings, that left little the the imagination and made Sherlock's ass look bigger than it normally did in his trousers and the, what must have been about seven inch black platform heels.
“Are we in a relationship?”

Sherlock breathes in the scent of John’s hair, holding him tighter. John makes a small sound in his sleep, but just nuzzles closer. Sherlock has never felt like this before. So free yet so grounded.
