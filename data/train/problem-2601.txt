“Bobby, Bobby!” Dean cut him off, waving his had in the air. “You’re not gonna bench me because you’re worried about me getting my feelings hurt!” Dean yelled. “I’m a big boy I can handle it,” he said in a mock voice.
The next day Cas was in Dean’s Car on the way to Charlie’s house. Gabe had teased him mercilessly about Dean picking him up. Once Dean got there Gabe had started making a series of obscene jokes which had made Dean’s face turn a variety of interesting red colors from blushing before Cas yelled that they were going to be late and dragged Dean out of the house.
Cas looked at Dean, who turned his face away. Castiel didn’t do well with humans. What was he supposed to say, in a situation like this? “This is um. The Warrior. Dean came to a scene and. Well.” He looked at Dean one more time. “It appears a party involved was modeling, well, Alastair.”
Pros: He knew Jimmy well enough by now that he would definitely be able to tell if he was lying or not, regardless of his answer.
Castiel pointed the other two in the direction of where police were taking ex-prisoners’ statements. He turned and faced the congregation of cars and people on the street. “These are the last ones,” he announced to the emergency personnel gathered around.
“Shhhhhh! Gabe! Someone could hear, I’m James in public. And I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Cas smacked his palm onto the top of the table and pushed himself into a standing position. “See? Im functional,” Cas said, nodding a few times.
Cons: If he was wrong, Jimmy would think that he was crazy. Or maybe even that he was only dating him for a chance at an insider scoop. Either way he would most likely get dumped immediately and this was a relationship he really didn’t want to ruin.
Cas and Anna were looking out the window. “It’s been six minutes. It normally doesn’t take them that long to get out of cars.” Anna said. “Do you think he needs help?”
They were on the couch, but now they were eating the dinner they had made after that whole conversation where he made Jimmy cry, which Dean was still oozing with mental embarrassment from, because seriously, who makes their boyfriend cry on the first night he invites him over? Ugh! Anyway, he had started a conversation about their food then over the course of talking had gotten to talking about Sam. He knew he was kinda rambling, but he was still so embarrassed, he couldn’t really help it.
Their current intel on Naomi said that she definitely had a point of contact in the local government. High up. Maybe even the mayor himself, but certainly someone that he would be talking with at the gala. With their discovery of Naomi’s involvement with the Leviathans, Cas and his siblings had wanted as many people there as possible, in case they had to split up. This meant that, while usually only Gabe alone or Anna and Cas as a pair went to these things, they planned on all going to this particular event. They figured there would be a big enough crowd that no one would see the three of them together and draw any conclusions.
Dean had been seeing Pamela more often than usual. One thing he was working on was reminding himself that Alastair was dead. Even if someone working with him had come back, he himself could never hurt Dean again. He had seen the proof himself. Remembering that gruesome scene was helpful but not exactly… uplifting.
He almost can’t handle this. All the memories have come flooding through. He remembers being in that situation, Naomi’s tools gleaming menacingly as he sat there, restrained. He remembers how…
“Well. I didn’t have to. I just…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “We were living with these family friends, Bobby and Ellen. I mean really they’re more like just family than ‘family friends’, but… I don’t know. I’d been living there since I was sixteen and I guess, with my little brother already leaving the nest, I kinda felt like I was just freeloading from them, ya know?”
He continued. “And it’s unlikely, but I mean… so is a species as hive-minded as the angels engaging in a civil war so disastrous it left Heaven powerless enough that the Leviathans were able to escape, after which they immediately came to a town that happened to contain 4 angels and an ex-angel.” Gabe began talking faster and faster as he rambled on. “And the fact that Luci, an Original Angel, is an ex-angel in the first place, because an angel had previously chosen to fall from grace, got born as a human baby, met an archangel willing to provide the power and spells to strip Luci of his power, was willing to provide her own blood for the ceremony because she’s somehow such a schemer that she figured out a way to restore her angel memories and powers once her human body reached adulthood, leaving the only missing ingredient the blood of an archangel and a demon-marked human whose soul wasn’t damned, and the previously voluntarily fallen angel had coincidentally started her adult career in a town that also happened to house the adoptive parents of the only one of Azazel’s kids whose soul was fine, because his older brother who raised him and doesn’t even know about Azazel happens to have a soul so strong even Alastair couldn’t turn him into a demon as leverage against the Azazel Kid, who by the way happens to be the same lawyer that got Luci pu--“
“I hope you don’t mind me taking your phone number from your donor file,” Dean said in a rush. “I know it’s not very professional, but. I was hoping maybe… to ask you on a date?”
So a lot of stuff happened in the year and a half since I last updated (ch 7) and ch 8 was the last thing I found in my files. This new chapter I've written since February of this year, but I'm a much different person now then I was when writing the earlier chapters and reading back i feel like my writing is now much different too. I do hope you'll keep reading! but I get if this chapter and the rest are not really your vibe.
Dean smiled at Cas when he saw him look over, then began walking towards them. Cas felt the tension in his body relax, as it always did when Dean was around. Even more so now that they were… involved. He tried to hide his smile, and rearrange his face to the same professional demeanor he had with Dean before meeting him in civilian form. He gave Dean a nod.
Cas turned back to the window. Gabe drew a big heart in the air, then began making obscene motions to the window. Cas grimaced. “I would love for you to introduce me to their pie. But, uh. Do you want to maybe eat it at my place?”
He looked at Anna with puppy dog eyes, tilting his head toward Cas. Anna caught on: Cas was just fermenting in regrets at this point. He needed a change of pace. “I suppose we have gotten as we can with the resources we have here on Earth,” she said. “Taking a breather couldn’t hurt. And Cas, I think getting out of the house would help you get out of your head.”
Anna had gone back to the reading she’d been doing when he barged in, but Gabe started making kissy faces, so Castiel decided to finish the rest of the conversation in the garden.
“I have a plus one, too. I was going to bring Anna, because she enjoys making fun of the ‘posh stuffies’ at these things,” Cas said, thinking of how to cover for if he and Anna had to exchange intel. Making fun of some of the more ‘stuffy’ people at these types of events wasn’t entirely out of character for Anna anyway. He continued “but she has her own invite because of her work with the hospital. I could bring you as my guest, if you would like. That way your brother and sister in law could have a nice night and they wouldn’t feel bad about making you miss out on any, um…” Cas paused, realizing this was either a really good idea or a really bad one “… gossip.”
“We already told the police the blood means Alistair is probably involved. He talks to officers regularly; it won’t be long before he finds out anyway.” Castiel said.
Kevin looked around the bus station. No one with entirely black eyes. Not that that meant much, but at least it was something. He sat down on a bench near the corner. Easier to see, harder to be seen. He put his duffle between his feet and his backpack on his lap.
The evil that radiated out from this place had been so strong that he and his siblings had been able to sense it from their house. Anna turned the knob. The three glanced between each other, mentally preparing themselves for what they were about to see. She swung the door forward.
Anna poured herself a glass of orange juice and sat down across from Cas. “So h---” She was interrupted by the doorbell.  She and Cas looked at each other, identical frowns of confusion on their faces.
Ahhh I went back and read the other chapters and there are s o  m a n y  inconsistencies. But it is already tomorrow, so that is a problem for another time. Also, I started this chapter at 10pm  after doing homework all day, so it is not the best. Hope you enjoy, though!
He’d made out at least two of Crowley’s goons in the crowd gathered on the other side of the lawn out front before Castiel and Archangel had stepped out, but that was nothing unusual. He looked at Castiel and mentally compared him to Jimmy Novak. Of course, the idea that Jimmy was the Clark Kent to Castiel’s superman was absolutely ridiculous, but Dean figured there was no harm in indulging his fantasy.
Dean sighed and tilted his head up from where he’d been laying it on the desk. “Yeah, oh well.” He had been the one to offer to answer questions people had for the newspaper.
Cas and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table. Dean had said the pie needed to heat up after the drive over, so they were waiting for it to do so. “So… How do you and Anna know each other?” Dean asked.
Charlie’s parents had been hit by a drunk driver one night. It resulted in her mom being in a coma for a week and her dad breaking his left arm and leg. She was fine with providing alcohol at her parties, but no one was allowed to leave in a car without a sober driver.
“Nah, Bobby, really! It’ll be fine. Besides, I’m still paying off hospital bills, and I’m trying to get, ya know, a less shitty apartment.”
They refused to tell anyone anything and simply flew away when someone stated asking questions. The only interaction they got from the Angels was when one of them, presumably the Archangel, would tape a copy of the newspaper with dicks drawn all over it above the clock in the lobby with a post-it note critiquing everything the reporter had said about the Angels. Now Dean got interviews and was even on a first name basis with the Warrior, Castiel.
Jo socked him in the shoulder. “She also said not to tell him it was her!” she hissed through her lips at him.
“Yeah,” Gabe said. He had returned from depositing the evidence he had found at their house a few minutes before Cas had joined them. “Lots of leviathan goo, meaning they were definitely moving their power like Anna said. Hopefully we can find some weakness by analyzing the goo later. There were also sigils written on human skin? That was kinda new. I copied them on paper back at the mansion, but I figured I should leave the physical copies to the humans for like… DNA or whatever.”
Renegade stepped out of the house with two detectives and they came to join Castiel and Archangel on the lawn out front. Dean had been watching the other two since they’d stepped outside with a detective and begun speaking with some of the forensic techs outside. After a brief discussion between the three detectives and the three Angels, one of the detectives with Renegade pulled aside the detective that had come out earlier and began talking with her. The other detective brought Renegade over to the three forensics techs he was speaking with. Castiel and Archangel were looking around, and Archangel caught sight of Dean watching them.
“Heard you met with your boy-toy again today,” Ash said and clapped a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean sighed and took a seat.
But that was silly. It couldn’t be Castiel. His voice was too high now any it would be kind of hard to hide glowing eyes and a gigantic pair of wings. Dean was just seeing Castiel every dark-haired white man these days. Besides, the man was still in his pajamas. He probably just woke up and that was his morning voice. Some morning voice, though, Dean thought. Anna even did look kind of like Renegade—
But, Dean thought as his reporter mind kicked in, if, theoretically, they could hide in plain sight, among people, that would explain why Jimmy and Loki had seemed so close. And it would explain the striking similarities between them. When Renegade had walked out, Dean looked at her anew, this time comparing her in his mind to Anna Milton.
Cas turned to Dean and cleared his throat. “The pape--” his voice cracked and he coughed, embarrassed. Then he remembered that he was supposed to be speaking as James Novak, which he usually made his voice slightly higher for anyway.
“Hey, uh, so…” Dean said while he fished his keys out of his jacket’s inside pocket. “My brother and his wife will be there tonight,” Dean said, holding his keys in his hands but making no movements to indicate he planned on starting the ignition.
He went up to the guest room. He closed the door, slid his back down it until he was sitting on the floor, and began to cry.
Although his ‘people skills’ were rusty, Cas was pretty sure Dean was asking if he and Gabe were romantically involved. Which Cas found disturbing in many ways. But Cas could’ve sworn Dean seemed… bashful. An expression he never thought he would see on Dean Winchester.
Dean grunted and sat up. “Thanks for getting me down, Cas. I think I’m gonna take some time and bask in the glory of my survival.”
Castiel stood up too now, excited about Dean’s theory. “So you’re saying it was Thursday’s choice the whole time?” he said. Dean nodded and Cas continued. “That he could’ve done what was expected of him, and the ‘painful walking’ would have been the march of time but while he was poisoned, or he could’ve done what he did, and the walk was painful because his counterparts all thought he was abandoning them.”
There’d been no recent Angel-related activity in the city-- and they tended to only go after crimes committed by certain people, though he’d yet to figure out what was so special about those people, other than them being high-profile—so the goo was the biggest clue. No one who’d stepped away from the scene to the line of police cars had been willing to comment, though, so he’d taken to people watching. Maybe the types gathered would provide a clue.
He could hear tears in her voice, and he knew she was being sincere. But she didn’t understand. It had happened precisely because he was here.
Crowley had already cleared out everything that survived the fire, so all that was left was the building itself and the charred remains of some supplies Crowley had deemed unsalvageable. A disturbing amount of what was left consisted of bones from creatures Casitel was certain contained no supernatural properties, meaning they were just killed for fun. And hung on the warehouse walls as trophies. Cas was trying not to think about it.
He tried to get free. He kicked, trying to hit whomever was holding him. He felt zip ties close around his wrists. He tried to scream, to get the attention of someone in the bus station, but he could feel a seat under him and heard a door slam. They’d already put him in a car.
Kevin gulped. Crowley held the stone up in front of him. “This, dear Kevin, is what I need your help with translating.”
“We should try to find any traces of the leviathans before the human authorities get here,” Cas said. Then he turned to look at the students again. “But we shouldn’t just leave them alone. Ambulances will take minutes to get here.”
Benny sat down at his seat opposite Dean after getting his morning coffee. He saw that his friend was sitting with the side of his face pressed against his desk. “Brother, what the hell are you doing?”
“Now, I know our ranks upstairs are thinner than usual, but it still would’ve taken a lot of power from down here to bring the leviathans to this plane of existence, and even more to keep them hidden. Let’s start by figuring out who or what could’ve done that.”
Once they got in the car, Dean was feeling... not better, per se, but… safe? Before, every breath had felt like a gamble. Any one might have started a flood of tears he wouldn’t be able to stop. But know, he felt… calm.
The movie ended and Dean looked at Cas with a huge smile on his face. Cas knew this was the part where Dean wanted to hear his thoughts.
“For here or to go?” the cashier at Trickster’s Treats asked. Dean opened his mouth to answer when he saw James Novak at the counter.  He couldn’t believe his luck. Dean had been meaning to speak to the man again but thought showing up at his house again might’ve been too… stalkerish.
By then it was about an hour until he usually ate lunch. He began seriously debating whether he could shoot spitballs at Benny without anyone noticing.
Cas was debating back and forth in his head, faster than the speed of light, when Dean tried to change the subject and finally Cas’ more impulsive side won out. “Is this the mayor’s gala?” he asked.
Cas blinked. He was taken aback by how similar the vocabulary Dean used was to the vocabulary he’d heard his own actions described in by his brethren. He hoped the outcome for his siblings would be as hopeful as Dean’s take on the outcome of the movie. He gave Dean a kiss. “I really like that interpretation.”
According to witness accounts, Naomi was a middle aged white woman with reddish brown hair. She always wore grey pantsuits and her hair in a tight bun. She kidnapped people and tortured them to near insanity then made them fight for her, basically her minions. Rumor was that Castiel, the one the Angels referred to as the “warrior,” had once been a prisoner of Naomi but had broken out. Which, Dean thought, was totally badass.
He had gotten there late, Naomi had known somehow. Many of the cells he had passed by had been empty, blood stains still on the floor; it was clear several captives had been hurriedly moved to another location. He freed those who were left row after row, counting all the prisoners who weren’t there anymore. Who he wouldn’t be able to free that day. Who will have to endure who knows how much more hardship.
“Hey!” Gabe cut in. “Cassie, man, come on. We can’t give up here. Positive attitude! We’re not that desperate!”
Castiel looked down and saw a phone. This must have been what caused the thump I heard earlier. He bent down and picked it up. “Is this your phone?”
Inside, Castiel asked the nearest officer he saw where Detective Song was. The officer pointed toward the back of the house. Castiel thanked him and began walking over. He spotted Anna and Gabe next to a man in the kitchen and headed for them, assuming he was Detective Song.
Anna startled Cas out of his Dean-watching “I’ve never seen him use this much brain power at once,” she whispered to him, jokingly. Cas started laughing, then tried to cover it up with a cough.
Gabe was about to retort when Anna walked in the front door and came into the kitchen. As soon as she took in the scene, she crossed her arms. “Ok, boys,” she sighed. “What’s got the tension in this room so thick.”
He paused for a moment. “Well, ‘ask’ them if they’re donating again, then if they’re not, use that charming personality of yours to persuade them,” Bobby added with a note of sarcasm.
Dean nodded. He looked back at the Angels, thinking. “I mean-“ he cleared his throat. “I can come down to the station later today. For your interview, and you can pick my brain too.”
Dean pulled into the parking lot at The Roadhouse. He looked at his car clock. 7:57 pm. He was supposed to meet Charlie for a drink at 8, and he would definitely need one after the day he had.
“That’s not what I’m saying at all, ya idgit.” Bobby sighed. “There’s a list of people who donated last year. Now, the only other one who wanted to do PR was the kid, Kevin. I don’t want him to have to interact with the more… shall we say ‘unsavory’ folks. So I split the list in half. Gave the kid the nicer half. Now, I know you have a complicated history with some of—“
“Well maybe I’ll have to start giving you some homework, so you can understand my spectacularly hilarious references. What do you do all day anyway? If you somehow haven’t interacted with a screen since the invention of television?”
Dean laughed. “You have on a suit worth over two hundred dollars, and you’re gonna wear your 10-year-old trench coat on top of it?”
Encouraged by Castiel’s determination, Dean did just as Cas had said. Cas really was stronger than he seemed, and true to his word his arm held steady the whole time Dean eased down to the branch he was on.
Benny got a proud look in his eyes and started talking about everything his wife was doing. Dean listened and they made friendly conversation afterwards. Benny asked if Dean was interested in anyone. “Not at the moment, no,” Dean said.
This was all his fault. If heaven had been running smoothly, a leviathan escape would never have been allowed to happen. Cas hadn’t been alive yet during the time of the leviathans, and Anna had been too young to remember, but they’d heard the stories.
So Dean had breakfast with the philanthropist living at the edge of town. They talked about Trickster’s Treats, which it turned out they both frequented, although Jimmy mentioned he’d never had their pie, and Dean said that was an injustice he simply could not stand for. That topic of conversation led to Trickster’s Treats’ candies, which lead to honey, which led to Jimmy’s bee keeping, which led to Dean’s love of cars, which led to Baby. Dean was smiling almost the whole time. By the time Dean actually did have to leave, around two hours later, he felt lighter than he had in years.
Cas glared at his brother. “What I mean is, is it wise to answer? Last he saw us, all three of us were together in civilian form. What if he’s figured us out and is calling to write an expose on the Angels?”
After he woke up, Dean took a shower. He was still too out of it from the nightmare do to much more than just stand under the water and let it wash over him, but he figured something was better than nothing. He’d been having nightmares every night since The Archangel had told him that Alastair was really a demon. They were getting a lot better now, but he really hoped they’d end soon. He needed to get his head back before tonight.
In conclusion, Dean definitely needed that drink with Charlie. In fact, he would definitely be needing several drinks.
“I doubt it,” Anna said. “He saw us months ago. He would have called us earlier if he wanted to do that, and he has contacted you as ‘James Novak’ before. Considering that is who the phone is registered to, I’d assume that’s who he’s trying to contact now.”
Anna looked around them. “We should discuss this later. They don’t need to hear,” she said, waving her arm to the side. Cas finally noticed their surroundings, too. Students and professors were staring with looks of shock on their faces. Staring at the Angels, staring at each other, just staring off into space. Anna was right, those of them still coherent enough to be hearing them were clearly in no head space to do so.
Castiel stood there for a while. Dean in his arms. He couldn’t even imagine what Dean was feeling right now. He had failed Dean so much. Castiel had been the one to tell Dean this nightmare was over. All those months ago he had held him, watched him, gave him his word that he was saved. And now. Castiel was the one telling him someone was out there, copying his old torturer. Taking on the role Dean himself had been groomed for. The role Castiel was supposed to have eliminated by rescuing Dean.
Dean made a shocked face that looked, frankly, kind of scared. Castiel rushed to reassure him. “Nothing concerning! Just uh… I would like to figure out how to best um… phrase it in a human language, I guess?” He looked around to his siblings, hoping to convey that they should back up his new lie to buy them some time.
He called Jo to come get him. She’d understand without giving him those “looks of understanding” or asking more questions than he could handle right now. The phone rang. And rang. And rang. He felt numb the whole time.
Dean let out a breath. “Yeah, ok. I’ll just… Do that… then” Dean swayed back and forth a bit in what might have been an attempt to move forward. He let out a noise which was, again, most definitely not a whimper, thank you very much.
This chapter is shorter than usual, but that’s just because the next chapter will be longer than usual!
Dean took out his camera. He’d have to go to the hospital later to interview the patients. He’d had Victor promise to let him know when the hospital called the police to say they were ready for interview. Victor said he was going to take their statements first, but he that he’d call Dean if any patients had the energy to talk to the press after that.
He was in a much different present, now. With much different concerns, which he could now feel all rushing into his mind. He tried to push that all aside; he wanted to give his full attention to this nice night out with Sam and Jess.
“Yes! No one ever comes to our house or even talks to ‘James Novack’. Anyone who knows Anna from her work at the hospital well enough to know of him will probably just think they’re dating. And anyway, that’s just two of us. So it’s not suspicious because- ” he looked around to  make sure there were still no humans in earshot “- the Angels are a group of three. If they see a group, consisting of three light-skinned individuals, where it appears that one is male with black hair, one is a female with red hair – which, no offense Anna, only makes up 2% of the human population – and one is a – no offense, Gabriel – short man with blond hair, don’t you think some people might wonder?”
Besides, Anna and Gabe had already teamed up. There was no way he was gonna convince them otherwise now. He sighed again. “Fine. I guess one night won’t hurt.”
It pulled him towards it. Maybe it must have some sort of beacon the demons after him were tacking it through.
“Besides,” Annael cut in. Her brothers turned to her. “I know we’re the ones who suggested you go for it, but now that Dean has been spending so much time around you in civilian form, he might recognize you. It’s probably not a bad idea if you do less interviews going forward.”
“It’s fine guys,” Dean said. “Benny’ll be here soon. Then I’m getting stupid drunk,” he took a sip of his beer. “But not really, because I have to work tomorrow,” he added.
“How?” He turned now to Gabe. “You said it yourself, a whole army of angels was barely able to do it last time. How do three of us, cut off from heaven, stand a chance?”
If his head was gonna be playing anything, its Jimmy movie was much more fun to watch than its Alastair one, but it made him feel like a teenage girl. The butterflies in his stomach didn’t help.
He passed it over to the angel. She read it over. “Hiding in plain sight. What an embarrassment these three are.”
Alright, Cas thought to himself, I can do this. I’ll just be James Novak and get him out of here before something slips out.
Even if he, hypothetically, had been a little moody, it would definitely have been cleared up by lunch break, because Kevin had finished all the names on his side of the list the night before and it was announced at lunch that, while they’d known for two days now that they’d have enough money for everyone to stay employed for another year, they now had enough extra money that they could finally replace the flier printer and probably even the coffee machine that, after years of valiant service, had broken down on Monday. And, Bobby had announced, after the cheers at that had died down, there was going to be a celebratory gathering at the roadhouse on Sunday, after people were done delivering the Sunday edition, for any staff member and any guests they wanted.
Dean got to the scene. He guessed that the ambulances had been here for a while while he was only a couple of minutes after the police. He had passed three ambulances on the way here as they headed in the opposite direction, and three more were still loading up the freed prisoners who needed medical attention; some cops were already taking statements from the rest. People in bullet proof vests and cargo pants were lined up in front of the building with their hands tied behind their back. Dean figured they must have been the jailers. The cops were handcuffing them one by one and putting them into the backs of their cars.
Castiel hadn’t even realized he thought that about the movie until he said it. All of the sudden the movie was hitting a little too close to home. He could feel himself tearing up as he continued. “And to say that all that had been planned the whole time anyway feels cheap. Like why did Thursday have to suffer through all that if it was always the plan anyway?” His voice cracked on the last bit and his tears started falling outright.
“Ok, Dean. Let’s just stay here.” Cas wrapped his arm around Dean and rubbed his head against Dean’s chest.
The corner of Victor’s mouth rose up, in what might’ve been a grimace or a smile. “See you then,” he said, tilting his head over to the detective he’d been speaking to earlier, indicating that he had to get back to work. Dean nodded and Victor walked away.
“Oh! Time for my shift.” She stood up from the couch and turned around to face everyone else. “You’re welcome to continue this conversation at the bar. If you feel like tipping,” she said with a wink.
“The PR job’s gonna pick up soon. Now, I know you took this job when you weren’t doing much ‘round here but twiddling your thumbs, but Charlie’s predicting these Angel stories’ll be picking up. You sure you wanna continue?”
Castiel looked down at his lap and sighed. He didn’t even know what he wanted with Dean, but it seemed he’d already blown his chances anyway.
Cas and Anna were poring over all the books and information they had gathered about the prophet. They were trying to see if the new knowledge of the prophet’s age and location could help them put together any other clues they had missed.
The people behind those eyes didn’t seem to be in distress, just anxious. Cas imagined the school had issued a “shelter in place,” so any students that weren’t near the music hall to begin with wouldn’t know what was going on in their campus. To them it could be anything from a loose bear to an active shooter. He imagined no one was contemplating the possibility that their classmates had been visited by some of the oldest, most raw creatures in existence.
Kevin pulled the ticket out of his jacket pocket. One-way ticket to Columbus, Friday 8:30PM.  It had been the soonest one leaving the state from when Charlie had told him about the attack. He had stayed at work late so he could drop a letter on Bobby’s desk without anyone seeing. He’d told Bobby how much he appreciated all he’d done for him, and to not worry about him, but that something had come up with his family suddenly and he had to go back home to see them. Bobby usually came into work early on Saturdays, so he should have time to read it before anyone else got there the next day. He’d texted Charlie something similar and thanked her for her kindness earlier that week. Kevin hoped she and Bobby would believe his goodbyes. He hoped they wouldn’t worry too much.
‘Oh,’ Cas thought, relieved. Dean was just concerned about intruding on a roommate. “I—um” Cas swallowed to clear his throat. “I’m sure she wouldn’t mind finding somewhere else to be for one night. Does tomorrow at 7pm work for you?”
“We know you probably don’t want to talk to anyone right now,” Sam said. “So we’re not gonna make you. Just know that we’re here, ok?” Dean nodded. He could feel the tears threatening to fall again, knowing that his family knew him so well.
Sam laughed. “Yeah, the time you answered my call at his house, you two sounded like such an insufferable couple to be around!”
Those may or may not have been sigils. He was not going to try for another glance but, really, what else would be written like that.
Dean was glad that his brain had stopped replaying deeply traumatizing moments with Alastair on repeat in his head, but he could do without the decision it seemed to have made to instead play all his interactions with Jimmy on a loop instead.
“Good start,” Gabe said, “but we have to figure out a way to give the dorms and the music hall something in common. An explanation as to why they would search both.”
Dean turned his full attention to the Angels, now. He watched them converse. He had promised himself that he wouldn’t keep enabling his half-baked delusions that the three Angels looked like Jimmy, Anna, and Loki. But now that he knew Jimmy better, had seen him laugh and smile and talk for hours on end… looking at Castiel now… Dean had to admit it almost seemed irresponsible to not consider the possibility.
Dean kissed Cas back then stepped back with a smile. Cas began removing his trench coat while Dean walked over to where he’d left the bag that he’d brought his suit in crumpled up in the corner. Cas put his trench coat back into his closet and when he came back out Dean had retrieved an umbrella and squashed the bag back to its lumpy shape.
Bobby gave a shake of his head. “Boy you’re making this job sound like winning the damn lottery. But alright,” Bobby said, his eyebrows scrunched up. He was still seemingly concerned for some reason. Dean sat up straighter in his chair.
Cas climbed up and situated himself on the branch below Dean. Thank goodness the Prithsons had planted this tree specifically because it was the kind that would be great for their kinds to climb.
Castiel nodded his head, not sure where Dean was taking this. “Well,” Dean said, “if you remember, when Thursday threw himself in front of Monday and got poisoned in his stead, he wasn’t fully independent of the rest of the days yet. So, Thursday had a choice. He could either get back in line, continue his weekly march, ‘walking alone with pain,’ or he could continue breaking the rules. If he had been any other day of the week, it would have been no question that he would get back in line, and even Thursday contemplated doing just that, which was Afternoon’s whole goal. That’s why Afternoon gives Thursday that whole speech about how he needs to ‘get back in line’ and if he continues on Thursday’ll ‘bring the end of all days,’ right?”
But he could still tell Sam wanted to talk. The man was practically bursting at the seams with Dean-please-open-up-to-me energy. It was making the silence awkward, so Dean decided to fill it before poor Sammy’s will to respectfully shut it gave out. “So, uh. I had to leave Baby at the scene.”
When the weekend came around, Dean skipped the party Bobby had thrown to celebrate getting enough funding for the year, even though he and Kevin were the guests of honor. Everyone he cared about at the paper understood that he was not in the headspace to be celebrating anything, or to spend hours surrounded by loud noises and tipsy people.
Gabe shot up from his chair, but Anna put her hand on his arm. “He just needs some time,” she said. “Let’s try and come up with some sort of a plan, ok? So we can have some good news for him when he comes back down.”
“Well, I’m glad things went well for you,” Anna said. “On the home front, we’ve made no progress. We tried to see if the new information could shine new light on any of our sources, but nothing so far. I mean there is more to go, but the leviathans definitely have an upper hand. I have no idea how they could have known an age and location so specifically.”
She grabbed his backpack and used it to turn him around roughly. “Hey!” he shouted, trying to reach back and stop her.
“Wait!” Dean hastily got up and walked over to where Cas had gotten to. “Hey Cas, I really mean it when I say thanks. Who knows how long I’d have been up there if you hadn’t come and the person who found me might not have been as sweet, so… thanks a lot, man.” Dean said, punching Cas lightly in the shoulder. He held a hand up in front of Cas. “But if you ever tell anyone about this I will skin you alive.”
He’d gone back to the office. Once he no longer had to focus on steering wheel and speed and stoplights and breaks and other cars and lane lines and mirrors – once his brain actually had a chance to think – his mind started racing again with sigils and monsters and out-of-this-world creatures. He’d slumped down at his desk and tried to calm himself. Luckily, Benny had been able to help him, and the panic attack wasn’t nearly as bad as it could have been.
Cas glowered at him. “For the last time, Gabriel. Dean is not our biggest concern at the moment. Anna will be back from her cover soon. We should be focusing on the prophet.”
“Actually, you know what,” Gabe said. “This is kind of a lot and… you’re not the best liar. How about I give Dean the interview this time.”
Maybe one day. My mother will kill me if I get caught texting in church again, though. Goodbye, Dean.
Crowley chuckled. “You sure catch on fast. Must be that MIT education coming through. Sorry about that nasty business in Boston, by the way.” Crowley frowned. “I had to outsource. Ugh, contractors. My condolences about Chantal.”
“Dean!” he heard someone shout and looked to the side. He saw Ash sitting on a pool table and waved to him. Ash jumped off and walked over as Dean made his way to the bar.
“I just don’t understand.” Anna said. “It’s not like this is one of the institutions where most of the student body has supernatural abilities. And even if it was, they’re just kids. There’s no way any of these college students has enough experience to be able to do something the leviathans can’t get Naomi to do. What could they have possibly wanted? And how could that have warranted soul examinations? What could’ve been the goal here except to attack innocent people?” she asked aloud.
Cas only started to like Dean more and more when they had classes together. After a year he realized that maybe he wasn’t entirely immune to Dean’s charm. Which is why Cas was particularly alarmed by the fact that he hadn’t recognized Dean upon first sight. To be fair, Dean was hidden behind quite a lot of leaves.  “So sorry, Dean. I didn’t recognize you from, erm… this angle.”
“I should never have even come to this party,” Dean thought to himself. And he wouldn’t have, normally. Meg was kind of a bitch to him and his brother, so he only ever came to her parties when he had friends going already. But she was real close with Castiel Novak, so he figured maybe she had a nice side somewhere deep down. Like, deeeeeep down. Last year Dean had gone to Meg Masters’ parties on whenever thought Cas would be there. However, Cas was Meg’s neighbor, so that ended up being most of her parties. Now Dean had learned his lesson and only goes on occasion.
Cuz somehow he knows im scared of heights so he always dares me climb something. I get up, look down, boom!
After the attacks in Boston, he had left his mom a voicemail to say he was fine but he had to stay away. Then he’d packed all his stuff up into three suitcases left on his dorm bed for them to give to her, along with a note telling her how much he loved her, and not to worry about him, and he’d call her as soon as it was safe.
“Don’t worry, Cassie,” Gabe chimed in. “You’re new to this. You haven’t been on Earth that long. I’ve been here for eons, remember? Contrary to the stories they tell you all up there, most humans don’t actually believe in miracles.”
There was an awkward pause where they looked at each ither. Then Dean picked his coffee up from the cnouter and hopped off his stool. "Well. I was on my way to work, so I better get going. See ya, Jimmy."
Dean was definitely not moody as he walked into the office that morning. Not in the slightest. He doesn’t know what Charlie’s talking about when she claims the contrary. No sir, Dean Winchester does not get moody because some random dude didn’t want to invite him to hang out.
Benny and Charlie had offered to skip the party and hang with him instead, and Kevin had offered to Dean that they cancel the party altogether, but Dean had insisted they go off and have some fun. At least someone should be enjoying themselves.
It seemed the fire had been started by a cache of holy oil spilling onto a hearth of hellfire. It seemed that an entire rack of holy oil had then caused a minor explosion, setting flame to the surrounding joy-kill ‘trophies’ hung around the exterior walls, which then caught the neighboring trophies and so on until the entire exterior of the warehouse had caught fire.
“Thanks, brother,” Benny said as Dean put his chair back behind his own desk. Dean nodded in reply then headed over to Bobby’s office.
That was all Cas could think. Shit shit shit shit shit. Because Dean had seen them. The three of them. Together. Shit.
Also after 15x18 successfully baited me back briefly, I found out that there was apparently an actual character named Annael, different from the angel who became Anna Milton. However, given the finale, I feel no shame in completely ignoring canon, so I'm not gonna fix that.
Dean drove up to the house. He parked his car in front and sat there for a bit, giving himself a pep talk. He was so fucking excited and nervous and just – he really just needed to calm down. Like, seriously. His stomach had twisted itself into so many knots it was in danger of not even being able to digest the pie. And his palms wouldn’t stop sweating. He dropped his head onto the steering wheel.
Cas stroked his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand in sympathy. “Anyway,” Dean said, “for a long time I just didn’t think about my future at all. But eventually my dad did catch the guy. Then when that didn’t… magically get rid of all his anger and grief over my mom… it sent him off the deep end. He started leaving us in motels for longer, less money for the stays. I had to start… skimping the lines of the law to put food on the table. Bit of shoplifting, bit of gambling. Got busted trying to steal some groceries when I was 16.”
Dean had finished with Crowley and was sitting in his car outside the last donor’s house. He’d made it clear with Crowley that he didn’t want to be there. (“Don’t worry, squirrel. I know you wouldn’t want to dirty your now-lawfully-employed hands with the likes of me. Tell me what it is and get on with it, fortunately you’ve caught me at a busy time.”) The last stop was one James Novak. Dean knows he’s a philanthropist with a reputation for bee-keeping. He tries to keep out of the public eye so there isn’t much else he knows. He reads the file, which does contain more information than he knew before, though. Apparently he was living in a homeless shelter, one to which he now donates heavily, before he won the lottery (lucky son of a bitch). Then apparently he lost it all within two years but had set up so many returning investments that he’ll never have to work again. Room-mates with one Anna Milton, no romantic relation confirmed.
Dean wakes up screaming. The sound of someone else’s screams is still ringing in his ears. He is panting and sweat soaks his shirt.
“Right, well, please, have a seat. I’m sorry to greet you like this,” Jimmy said. He tried to smooth down his hair. Dean guessed, but running his fingers through it seemed to just be messing it up further. Not that Dean minded. He gave up on his hair with a blush. “I wasn’t expecting any visitors today. Would you… uh… like some food?”
A couple weeks ago, Dean had been in a lull of stories, so when Bobby asked if anyone wanted to help answer the questions people had for the newspaper and general PR for when people got pissed at their stories, Dean had jumped at the chance to make some more money each week. He’d thought that it would mainly be dealing with the latter, but this extra task ended up being less dealing with angry assholes and more with stupid assholes, who were one-thousand times worse. Of course, the fact that soon after that he was appointed to cover all the angels stories and now had actual work to do, did not make him feel better about having to play ambassador to the idiots of this town.
“I’m just, a-“ Dean picked the pie up from the seat beside him and held it up. “I’ll just go in then. Now.”
From what he could see of the front lawn, it looked like a huge fight had gone down. There were splotches of blood all over the lawn, along with what looked like thick, black goo. The windows looked like their insides were covered in blood as well.
They looked at each other for a beat. He wasn't sure what to do, so he picked up his coffee. "Well. I was on my way to work, so I better get going. See ya, Jimmy."
“Well, Dean, I’m sure C-James!” She exclaimed a bit loudly, which Dean thought was a little strange, “will be more than happy to talk to you.” She said as she started walking down a hallway. Dean followed her until they stopped in front of the entrance to--Dean presumed based on the heavenly smells wafting out of it-- the kitchen. “He’s just this way,” she said.
Castiel was blushing even more than before “he is not my lover. And I'm not trying to see him. It would be foolish to pursue him. He's human." Cas said. Whether he was trying to convince Gabe or himself, he honestly couldn't tell. After his brief meeting with Dean the other day, he kept thinking about the man. It had been fun to talk to him in a non-professional way. But, it definitely would be foolish to try to build a relationship with Dean. He could reveal his identity as Castiel and put Dean in danger. Then again, if he knew that, what was he doing here. "Besides, can’t I just want to hang put with my bother?”
But what still didn’t make sense in Dean’s crack-pipe theory – even if said theory seemed to be becoming more and more substantial by the minute – was Loki. The Archangel. Why would only two of the Angels live together? Why would two be philanthropists and one be a small business owner?
“James,” Anna said to the man, “this is Dean Winchester, he’s from the paper.” Dean thought she sounded pretty flirty again, so he figured that was just her voice.
But he couldn’t ignore a little whisper in the corner of his brain, wondering: was he really into Jimmy, or did he just like the crack-pipe theory that Jimmy is Castiel?
The only signs of distress he found came from a dormitory building near the edge of campus, closest to the rest of the city. He could sense fear and confusion, coming off many people in waves. There was something strange about the emotions, though. They were… muted.
Benny gave him a knowing wink then changed the topic. They talked about Sam, and how his cases were going. By now both of them had finished their beer, both they both had to drive home so neither of them ordered anything stronger. They talked about Benny, and how his sponsor was (Benny was three years clean, and Dean had helped get him there and was proud of his friend). They talked about the shows they were watching, and eventually the conversation circled back to work.
“Ok, Winchester,” he thought to himself, “I’m gonna look at the photos. Press weren’t allowed in, so I don’t have any photos with blood.” He breathed in. Held. Breathed out. Held. “First two viable photos, and I send it to Charlie. Then Sam can take me to Pam. Ok.” In. Hold. Out. In. Hold. Out. “Ok.” He turned over his camera, and took out the SD card.
He had said to Dean that the scrolls found in the dorm were “meant to channel more power to the leviathans, so they could bring more of them to this planet from purgatory. They’d chosen a place that they thought would be densely packed, allowing them to feed off the unconscious energy of hundreds, but luckily for us the dorms were mostly empty, so the leviathans weren’t able to reach that goal.”
Dean tried to play it off smooth. “Yeah,” he said with a chuckle. “Just nervous, I guess. First dates, you know.”
Dean was still gaping at Gabe. Cas’s eyebrows creased. Dean's silence was concerning. He hoped Dean hadn't spent enough time with the Angels to recognize his siblings, but he was just now realizing that he had inadvertently introduced Dean to all three Angels. He unleashed a litany of curses in his head, hoping Dean hadn't put two and two together. “Dean?”
The warehouse belonged to Crowley. The human blood at the Leviathan house seemed to suggest someone following Alastair’s example. There wasn’t much of a connection, but Alastair’s demise had been what allowed Crowley to rise to power, so they were hoping to find some sort of connection.
He shouldn’t have gone poking around those not-quite-truths. Shouldn’t have asked questions, so many questions that the system collapsed under their weight. Shouldn’t have let his own doubt spread to others, who couldn’t handle it as well, who looked up and didn’t like realizing they were just another cog in the machine. Another drone bee, thoughtlessly following the orders of the queen. Indistinguishable from any other mind-numb soldier.
Each bee had a task which she completed diligently. The bees had a purpose. Loyally serving their queen – their entire being dedicated to the colony.
“Alright, alright,” Dean said, letting her pull him up. “I guess if we all finally have the night off except Jo,” he said, sticking his tongue out at her. She made a face back. “We might as well keep her company.”
A couple seconds later they came up for air. “Do you wanna go out on a date later today?” Dean asked breathily.
They had been texting and calling each other basically every day since the first date. Not that Dean was whipped or anything… just that he was totally whipped.
Bleeeep bleeeep. Dean could hear the lines lazily going off at the phone bank. He had gotten to work early like usual and after about an hour of torturous work, he had crashed and dropped his head down onto the table. He idly blew at a speck of dust that had landed on the paperwork in front of his face.
Now it was Cas’s turn to interrupt him. “Don’t be,” he said. “It’s ok. I miss them. And I do regret how much… damage… my fall from the pedestal of obedience caused. But-“ he trailed off.
Two of the last five prisoners were crying. The one at the front simply looked dazed. Castiel thinks it is likely he’s been here the shortest amount of time. The two he was carrying were not conscious enough to cry. One has not opened her eyes. The other has been mumbling incoherently the whole time. Castiel suspects he was recently in the Chair.
He felt bile start to rise up the back of his throat. He took a deep breath and turned around, leaning against the Impala with his back to the scene. He took more breaths, trying to calm himself before he had a full blown panic attack.
“I’m on the younger end, but not one of the youngest. If that makes sense. I was born late enough to be considered a ‘baby’ of the family, and to be raised more by my older siblings than any parent. But, I was still looked up to. I still had enough siblings younger than me, and even some older than me, who looked up to me that I was seen as… someone to be respected?” Cas quieted. He wasn’t quite sure where he was going with this.
He knew it was childish, but he felt safer in the well-lit office with dozens of people he knows by name than in his anonymous apartment, filled with students moving in and out so frequently you never even really learned their faces.
Cas and his siblings had tried to secure tickets in civilian form for the same reason it seemed Sam planned on bringing Dean. That really was quite smart of Dean’s brother, Cas could see how his brother Lucifer had found Sam a threat before he had been sent to prison and Gabe had bound his powers to make sure he couldn’t use them to break out and expose himself.
“Oh! Well, uh. Great!” Dean said. Cas could tell over the line that Dean was smiling on the other side. He could feel the corners of his own mouth turning up, too. “I was thinking how about Trickster’s Treats? I could finally introduce you to their pie.”
Dean really did feel terrible about taking a possible romantic night away from Sam and Jess, but he was too nervous to outright ask to be Jimmy’s plus one. He didn’t want to seem like he was sugar-baby-ing him. Plus, this was his first turn hosting date-night and he was keenly aware that his apartment was much less impressive than their usual mansion location.
“Yeah,” Dean said, kissing the top of his head and bringing him back to the present. “It all seems kinda messed up and pointless at first. But I swear I didn’t show you this movie just to make you cry.”
Casitel couldn’t say she was wrong. He’s never been great with humans, especially with comforting them. He took off to look around the school. He knew Gabe was already out for evidence, so he didn’t worry about investigating any of the mess he saw. But he couldn’t help but note that the leviathans had really done a number on the school. Debris from the music building was scattered about for almost a full block. The streets, which Castiel was sure were usually full of students and professors, were empty. Eyes looked out from almost every window he flew past.
Dean let himself cry for a while. He knew he had to let himself feel the emotions, but he couldn’t let himself drown in them. He had to at least keep himself afloat, because if he let himself fall it would be so much harder to get up this time.
“Don’t kid yourself, Gabriel! We all know that’s what got us into this mess in the first place. I break everything I touch.” He flew off.
Even with all that progress, things had been so quiet that they’d jumped at the chance to check out a simple warehouse fire.
Cas was looking out the window, waiting for Dean. He saw Dean’s car pull into the driveway, and Dean got out and went to the back door. He emerged holding a suit bag and started walking up toward the door. With all his nerves, Cas was couldn’t help but fly to the door and open it excitedly. “Hello, Dean,” he said, smiling.
He was trying to convince his mind to slow the fuck down, this would only be his first date after all, when Loki walked up to where he was standing by the counter. “Dean-o!” he said in greeting, a huge smile on his face. He leaned, resting his arms on his side of the counter. “You’re here for Jimmy-boy, am I right?” he said, fluttering his eyelashes.
It was the Saturday morning after one of Meg Masters’ all night parties and Dean found himself, as he so often did after one of these parties, stuck in some place so high that he thinks he may barf if he were to look down.
Maybe even heaven couldn’t achieve perfection, but short of perfection, efficiency had certainly been good enough. Before he’d decided to indulge his doubt.
“Technically, you’re here because you rejected your grace, Cas is here because he lost his, and we’re all here because we’re wanted fugitives upstairs” Gabe interrupted.
“Well, they looked through each and every room in the building, so I don’t think they found it. Which means we’re luckily not dealing with a prophet dumb enough to do that.” Gabe replied.
The prisoner up ahead opened the door. Sunlight streamed in. Castiel handed off the prisoners to the medical first responders at the scene.
He’d had a lot of memories resurface that he’d been working through with Pamela. The one upside about the relative calm was that he was able to devote more time to his sessions with her. He’d definitely made progress. Pamela had said at their last session that she ‘would bet that you’re right back to where you were before any of this new “House of Horror,” or whatever those schmucks are calling it, stuff happened. Am I right?’ and Dean had to say he agreed, which is no joke.
“Yeah, heard it was the Warrior who broke them out. Rough one,” Jo said consolingly, sliding Dean’s beer across the bar to him.
More scared than when he was 16, and starting to believe Bobby that his life could be more than running from motel to motel, scamming and gambling to keep Sammy fed.
“Suuuure, Dean,” Sam said. Dean could literally hear the annoying face Sam was making. “Well, we’ll see ya there, man.”
Before he could think of a third option, he was interrupted from his ruminations by an Angel walking over. Not Castiel, though. It was The Archangel.
“ATTENTION EVERYONE THE MOVIE IS FINALLY STARTING!” Charlie called from the living room. A couple more people got up and walked into it.
“Cas,” Dean slurred, pointing at his chest. “I like you ‘n all, but ain’t no way you’re driving my baby.
Dean was still trying to digest the fact that he’d just heard a grown man say “idk” out-loud. He’d only ever heard Kevin and Jo say that, and he always teased the ever-living daylights out of Jo when she ‘verbalized text-speak’ as Ellen called it. But he figured Loki’s advice was probably sound. “I’ll take the honey apple pie, a large to go.” Dean did not want to think about how embarrassingly excited it made him that the dessert combined something he loved, apple pie, with something Jimmy loved, honey. Damn, this date prospect really had his brain in sappiness overdrive.
There was another awkward pause as they looked at each other again. Cas got the feeling he was supposed to say something but he didn't know what. He eventually settled on. "See you, Dean."
“Us angels aren’t that easy. Even cut off from heaven we’re a lot more powerful than any demon, no matter how high ranking. Holy fire is still the only thing that can hold them, and Castiel alone has escaped from at least three rings of holy fire. He’s the lowest ranking of them all.”
“Mr. Warrior,” he said. “My name is Mark. I’m here to stay with the students if you want to get back to your associates at the music hall. However, I am supposed to inform you that your superhuman speed and strength would be helpful in transporting these students to the hospital. We we’re told the students were unconscious but not in any medical danger, so the EMTs will each be bringing their own stretchers, instead of the usual teams of two per stretcher, but even then your help would greatly speed up the process.”
Calling Sammy had been Dean’s original goal, but waiting for him to get here would just be more time in the tree, and Cas was already here. “Ok, ok. I’ll do it.” Dean took a deep breath and took Cas’ hand. He’d been hoping he’d get to do that one day, but he couldn’t think about that at the moment. He took a deep breath.
Benny laughed. “No pressure or anything. All right, best to you then!” Benny called after Dean as he nodded his goodbye and went out to the parking lot.
Cas sighed and crossed his arms. He knew she was right, though. They’d been working non-stop for weeks now. In all honesty, he was a bit burnt out. They probably all were. But he still didn’t think a ‘night out on the town’, as Gabe had put it, would be helpful. “What if someone sees all three of us together? It’s a little suspicious.”
Definitely not like a man still swimming in post traumatic stress who should probably be putting more effort into his mental health.
Do readers tend to prefer one line between paragraphs (the way I did Cas’s POV) or two lines between paragraphs (the way I did Dean’s POV)? Please let me know! If there’s a preference, I’ll space the chapters that way going forward.
Cas tried to turn his glower into a death stare. “No one said anything about love, Gabriel. It would be irresponsible to consider any sort of personal relationship with a human. Whether they know who we are or not. I’d be putting him in danger.”
Bobby continued, “He liberated a building full of Naomi’s prisoners. As of now he’s still there. Go cover it.”
“I think he wrote very respectfully. H left out some things which I’m sure the press already knows which the victims are, perhaps, not ready for the world to know.”
Castiel’s luminous eyes, previously angry and determined, lit up in a smile as he turned to Dean. “Sure, Dean. What would you like to know?”
“Notice the human pictured with the one who calls himself Warrior,” the Leviathan said, sitting back down.
Cas picked up the article and skimmed through it. When he put the paper back down Gabriel’s face was right in front of his.
Castiel remembered having seen Dean at the edge of the scene. He was probably waiting for a statement. “Dean is here.” He said.
“Exactly,” Castiel responded. “I feel like-“ he paused, trying to find the right words “like Thursday finally realized he didn’t need to follow some plan the days he thought were ‘more important’ had decided. He finally realized he didn’t need to always have the force of the whole week behind him. He could start things on Thursdays and end them on Thursdays, just because it was right to do so.”
“None taken,” Castiel responded. “It was kind of like a job. The family business and the family itself were essentially one and the same. For most of my life I never even considered the possibility of doing anything else.”
Victor was talking to another detective. Dean didn’t know her name, but he had seen her speaking to the students outside the music hall earlier. Dean walked over, aiming to stand a few feet away and wait until they finished their conversation, maybe hear some chatter in the meantime. To Dean’s surprise, Victor turned away and started walking toward him as soon as he saw him coming.
It was nice to hang out with his brother and sister in law. He didn’t get to see them very often. They were both pretty prominent lawyers. Usually, when they weren’t working long hours for their paying clients, they were working overtime for their pro-bono clients. He was proud of the work they were both doing – really, really proud – but it was kind of a bummer when most of the times he tried to meet up he was met with “so sorry, but I have to work late tonight.”
“Uh-huh,” Sam said. Dean could practically hear the bitch face Sam was making over the phone. “What’s their name?”
“Oof,” Jess said. “I’ve only heard stories about how the two of you are together, but from that alone I pity the poor roommate who has to sit in a car full of that.”
“One night out won’t hurt. We’ll have a little fun, recharge, and come back at it with fresh eyes!” Gabe said.
Once they got to the party Dean had been pulled away by Garth and Benny and Cas had been forced into a crash-session on Star Wars by Charlie. Apparently tonight they we’re going to be watching the second three which were actually the first three which Cas thought was confusing, to say the least.
When Castiel had gotten there Dean had barely been lucid. He was so frail that when Castiel grabbed his shoulder to guide him out, it had left a bruise.
It was an inescapable truth. Both the fact that the leviathans were really here, and that fact that it was his fault this was all happening. Heaven had been running just fine. It was a well-oiled machine. In fact, it had been the most efficient machine in all of his father’s creation. He should have accepted that. He should have appreciated how important it was that things stayed running smoothly.
He had tried. He had tried so hard. He’d purposefully moved into an apartment where no one would even know his name. He didn’t talk to anyone outside of work really. He needed money but he’d gotten a job in a completely different field than anything he’d studied before. Who would guess a cello performance major would intern at a newspaper?
Ellen walked in “The guest room is clean. You can stay as long as you want, or you can go back to your apartment as soon as you want. Whatever you need, ok?” she said.
“I just saw them go.” Gabe said once Cas and Anna caught up. when he sensed his siblings’ arrival. “Well, the last of them anyway.” He turned to face Cas and Anna. “I got here in time to see them go, but I was too late to do anything about it.” Cas saw a brief but intense look of guilt flash over his brother’s face, before he regained his stoic expression. “Some demons taking a group of humans, but the humans didn’t look scared. They must’ve been some of Naomi’s prisoners-turned-henchmen. That means confirmation that the demons, leviathans, and Naomi are working together.”
I realized idk how to tell everything that is relevant from just Cas and Dean’s perspectives, so there’s a surprise POV at the end! And I’ll probably do a couple more non-destiel POVs throughout :D
“And you know humans don’t do very well when they’re both scared and unknowledgeable.” Anna added on. “They’re liable to start a witch hunt and scare the prophet straight into the leviathans’ hands.”
“Before you go,” Anna said, also speaking so that no humans could listen in. “Most of the kids aren’t responding, but a couple have spoken. It seems like the demons were doing soul examinations. That’s why so many of them are so unresponsive.”
When Anna told Gabe the story, of course, Gabe started laughing and congratulating Cas for “finally showing some emotion.” The next time Gabe encountered a reporter it was, unfortunately for Cas, Dean. Gabe proudly announced that he had glued a reporter to his car as a hazing to join the family, so “anytime you wanna bring him home to meet the family, I’m one step ahead of you.”
Jimmy was glowering at the man. “I was just dropping off your coffees. Have fun, kiddos.” He said, winking at Jimmy. Dean wondered if they were… close.
In his excitement, he had forgotten to keep his voice from the humans. An EMT supporting a crying student shot him a reprimanding look. “Sorry,” Gabe said.
After that Dean had been in the hospital for two weeks. When he got out Bobby made him take sick leave for. After a month Dean was begging Bobby to let him get back to work or he'd go crazy without anything to do. After much persistance Bobby finally agreed. Coincidentally Dean was assigned to go check out the scene the next day when the Angels referred to as Warrior and Renegade had unearthed a group of Lucifer’s followers on the city council. When Casitel had seen him he’d stared at him for several moments, not moving. Dean had stared back. When Castiel broke eye contact and flew away, the Renegade, Castiel's red-headed partner, had actually spoken to Dean.
“I have an invitation too, and I thought it unlikely that there would be two black-tie events in town a month from now.”
But Dean didn’t want to think about stuff like that right now. It had been such a good night. And hell, he really needed a good night. He didn’t want to ruin it thinking about Angels. About how they might live on Earth full-time, instead of defending it as a part-time gig. About how royally screwed it would suggest that humanity was if divine protection was needed 24/7. About how Alastair might have had a different protégé. About how that protégé might be out there. About how –
Sam and Jess were sitting on one side of the booth, Dean on the other. They’d started off at the bar, talking with Jo, but when the rest of the seats had filled up she’d kicked them out, because ‘sorry guys, but flirting gets the most tips and your seats are wasted on guys I’ve grown up with since I was ten.’
Dean had been understanding, and gone along with that for a while, but he eventually brought it up to Castiel that he felt bad intruding on Anna so often. That’s why he had offered to host date-night at his apartment, instead. Castiel knew this was a big deal for Dean. Dean had mentioned to him a couple times that he was embarrassed because, in his words, “It’s just that this place you and Anna have here… It’s so, uh. Grand. And my place is so… not. I just. I don’t want you to feel bad for me, or pity me or anything like that.”
“Fuck it,” Dean said to himself, after a few minutes of valiant effort. He looked for the donor file on James Novak to get his phone number.
Sam laughed. Jess tugged Dean’s arm up as she got off the couch. “Come on, big guy. Loosen up a little.”
“Should I go and let you two have some alone time?” Cas asked with his eyebrow raised as Dean laid face-down on the ground with his limbs spread out starfish style.
“I thought so as well, but… I agree with Gabe. With how old these sigils are, and how complex… I don’t think there’s anything else it could be.”
Hello Dean, this is Castiel. Charlie gave me your number a while ago. I still do not intend on telling anyone about our encounter after what I assume was Meg’s party yesterday, but how did you end up in that tree anyway?
He was worried that people would make a big deal about how long he was out. He still hadn’t even talked about it with Sam yet, so if some random-ass coworkers he didn’t even know had started asking him questions, he would’ve started throwing punches. But Bobby must have made an announcement or something because everyone was treating Dean normally. He was thankful for that.
“Yes, I can see that,” Cas said, frowning a bit. “Well, I know I’m not nearly as tall as Sam,” Cas said, thinking of Dean’s younger brother, who was half a foot taller than him. ”But I could try to help you down myself?”
Cas knew he was originally supposed to fly them back to where Anna was, but he thought them being unconscious definitely meant that plan had to change. The kids at the hall were already so traumatized; they didn’t need to see a limp body and wonder for even a split second if one of their peers was dead.
He had to focus on Dean right now. He couldn’t afford to go spiraling off into his own head. So fast that no human could perceive it, so as not to disturb the man in his arms, Castiel flew to his siblings and told them to leave without him. He had to stay with Dean.
More scared than when this very man had held him last. Had told him he was safe. Had brought the terrifying proposition that... maybe it was really over.
Cons: Of the three of them, Loki was the most likely to call Dean out point-blank if he noticed him acting weird, instead of just politely ignoring it. Also stalking people makes Dean feel creepy.
“Alright. If you’re sure.” Bobby opened one of his desk drawers and pulled out a large manila folder. “Here’s your list. Each person’s got a sheet with name, picture, amount they gave, and some sparse information.  Most of the city’s rich folks are on it, both politicians and the ones the cops can never quite get in jail. Your job, is to make sure they pay again this year.” He pushed the folder towards Dean.
“The end of next month, Sammy?! That’s practically two months away! How’s anyone supposed to know what they’re doing then?”
“Yeah,” Charlie went on. “Over and over he kept being like ‘no you don’t understand, you don’t understand, it’s all my fault.’ I mean I feel so bad for him. I can’t imagine.”
Cas also really wanted to be able to give Dean this win. It was rare that he could do anything meaningful for Dean, and this seemed like something that was really making him feel guilty.
Dean had not taken up saying “Cas,” but he did call him "Castiel," and Cas had begun calling Dean by his name. When Castiel got home that day, Gabriel made it very clear that it was now his mission to get Castiel and Dean together. Castiel had told him all the reasons why that wouldn’t work, but Gabe had merely listed all the signs that Cas was smitten.
Unfortunately, his sudden movements had dislodged his phone from his pocket. It went tumbling down to the ground. Dean cursed. The damn thing better not be broken, because ‘Hey , Mom and Dad, can I get a new phone, I dropped mine from a tree I got stuck in after a drunk dare’ would definitely not go over well at all with John and Mary Winchester.
“Uhh,” Cas said. He had to think. On the one hand, he really cared about Dean, and he didn’t want to hurt his feelings by turning him down. And, if he was being honest, a small part of him wanted to say yes for selfish reasons, too. On the other hand, Dean could get hurt even more if Cas accepted and Dean got caught in some sort of crossfire.
Dean got home and talked on the phone with his brother, Sammy, for a while then took a shower. He headed out to the roadhouse and got there around 7:50. He parked his car in the lot and walked in.
Dean got a confused look on his face and stared off into space (at Cas’s earlobe) for a while. Then his face broke into a smile. “Oh yeah I did! Shit. Looks like we’re gonna have to spend the night here.”
Dean barked out a laugh. “Alright, you sly dog. I’ll ask Bobby if the paper can swing some tickets so you can get some quality Jess time.”
Cas was greeted by the sight of a boy in the tree. The man was clinging to the trunk as if his life depended on it. Which, perhaps  Castiel could’ve believed, except for the fact that the tree was definitely not tall enough to be anywhere near fatal, and the man was only about four branches off the ground.
“She must’ve been moving them already,” Anna said, catching on. “And she wouldn’t have moved everyone out unless something big was going down.”
“Yeah, uh” Dean chuckled, his ears turning red. “I got stuck in this tree, and I was reaching for my phone there to call my brother or someone to help me down. When I, well, I dropped it.”
“Yes, sir,” Dean picked up the envelope and walked back to his desk. He took out his briefcase, and put the folder in there. Benny looked up from his work.
He could stay here and try to get a word from one of the police personnel around, or an Angel, should one eventually walk out.
Anna didn’t pull any punches. Her sense of humor was somewhat dry, like her roommate’s, and she’d call out bullshit the moment she saw it. Anna’s ways of talking somewhat mirrored the direct, but not inconsiderate, way Renegade gave her interviews.
“That’s true, I will be. But I’m sure it is a price that dear Cassie is more than willing to pay for love.” Gabe said dramatically.
ok the line spacing is real off :( but i'm gonna go back and fix that in all the chapters once i've completed the story
“I think that’s a bit of a stretch, don’t worry,” Anna said at the same time that Gabe said “Why’d Anna get a ‘no offense’ too, you didn’t even insult her!”
“I was gonna fly to Gabe’s but, maybe I’ll just walk over and stop at his car on the way? See what’s up?” Anna said.
He checked his watch again. 8:14PM. The bus would come soon and he could board. Then he’d have to start all over again, get a whole new job in a whole new city.
Hey, Cas. Well, apparently when I’m drunk I can’t say no to a truth or dare. Crowly likes to dare me to do dumb things.
Dean was asking Cas questions now. It was hard for Cas to talk about Naomi even still, but he tried. He didn’t tell Dean he’d been in purgatory, but he did tell him he had been somewhere bad. He also didn’t tell Dean that he was there as penance. That he had done something he couldn’t forgive himself for, ever, no matter how much Gabriel tells him it wasn’t his fault, he wasn’t himself. Naomi had been the one to ‘rescue’ him form purgatory. He thought, maybe this would be better, if someone else had freed him, maybe there were some angels left who didn’t hate him.
“Same in the western half,” she replied. “I hope Gabe hasn’t found more outside. The sigils in this room alone are enough to generate more power than we could easily handle, let alone what’s written over the rest of the first floor.”
“Alright,” Dean nodded. Just then he saw the doors open and there Castiel was, walking out of the double glass doors, leading five prisoners to freedom. Only two could walk on their own. One was holding the doors open. The other was supporting a woman with blood running down her right leg. Castiel was carrying the other two out. Dean took a picture.
The look of fear left Dean’s face, replaced with relief. “Of course, of course. I’ll be talking to Detective Henricksen in the meantime. Let me know whenever you’re ready.” He walked back in the direction he had come from.
“I have an invitation too, and I thought it unlikely that there would be two black-tie events in town a month from now.”
Dean paid and made his way over to James. ‘Alright, Winchester. Be cool, be cool,’ he thought to himself. He plopped down in the stool next to him. “Hey, Jimmy! How’s it going?”
“Well, didn’t we once think the prophet was in Boston? That’s a college town.” Anna said. “And we know the prophet is out of childhood, so it’s possible the leviathans have some sort of more accurate read on the prophet’s age than we do, and know for sure that ‘college-age’ is right.”
The smell of vomit and stale blood was in the air. The office building lobby, which had until recently been immaculate, was covered in the sources of the smell. Castiel fought back the urge to throw up himself.
Once she saw his face, Charlie had quickly agreed and Dean had gone back to his desk to get to work. He’d felt sick to his stomach the whole time he was writing the article, knowing exactly how many journalism rules of ethics he was violating as he wrote a story that his witness had literally told him was a lie, but as Archangel was leaving he had told Dean with a wave to “keep the demons out of the presses, or I just might have to smite you!” and Dean was not entirely sure whether or not that was a joke, and didn’t quite feel like risking it. The Angels probably knew what they were doing anyway, with the cover story. He hoped.
Dean was still considering this as Castiel walked over to him. His theory had cracks. But not enough to blow it apart entirely. Now, he just had to start looking for footprints.
Dean laughed at his use of air quotes, then launched into a discussion of the book he had been reading in his free time. Cas was content to watch his animated explanation.
“Shit,” the woman said. “Where? Where is he I’m coming to get him.” Castiel gave her the address and handed Dean his phone back.
He started kicking his legs more desperately, trying to hit anyone, trying to free his hands, anything.
That was a new development. The names. The time before last that Dean had interviewed Cas, Gabe had been there. Thankfully he hadn’t done anything too embarrassing, like tell Dean to propose or buy him roses. He had simply walked up between the two of them while Cas was being interviewed, taken both of their hands, said “Cas, Dean,” and walked away. Cas had then clarified that his name was actually "Castiel," but asked that Dean keep that out of the paper. He preferred the actual names of his team stay unknown. While any entity who bothered to look at the pictures in the news would probably recognize Anna's red hair or realize that the only rogue archangel was Gabe, going by their aliases--- Renegade for Annael, Warrior for him, and Archangel for Gabriel--- offered at least meager protection.
This was good. Baby was something he could focus on. Baby he could talk about for days. He chuckled. “If you leave one scratch on her Sam, I swear…”
He felt a bit like Rapunzel in that Disney movie. Stuck in the same place, doing meaningless tasks over and over again while there was clearly an evil conspiracy afoot.  (Tangled, he recalled offhand, was the name of the movie. A movie which he had definitely only seen on accident, because he totally couldn’t find the remote, even though he definitely spent the whole movie 100 percent laser-focused on finding the remote, not on watching some sappy princess movie.)
“Oh my god, I can’t believe you’ve never seen Star Wars!” Dean shouted incredulously, turning around to face him on the couch.
“No, no. Hey. Don’t talk like that. You didn’t do anything. You were here the whole time, you didn’t do anything.”
Meg’s parties weren’t that bad, actually. Dean went to quite a few parties and he had to say, Megs were almost high class for a group of rowdy high schoolers trying to imbibe as much alcohol as physically possible in one night. In fact, if he didn’t hate Meg and anything she did on principle, he would probably say he enjoyed her parties. Well, except for one thing.
He checked his email for a while, but it was mostly just junk. He decided he might as well do something useful and started to clean out his old photos on his computer that he’d never used in a story. He felt really productive… until after a while he realized that he’d just been looking at different pictures of Castiel for the past twenty minutes. Feeling a bit creepy, he turned off his computer.
Cas faltered. Usually, the conversations came easily with Dean. They had enough to talk about in just their opinions and perceptions of the world that, usually, he didn’t get asked too much about his day-to-day life. He hated those kinds of questions, because that was when he had to lie to Dean.
The Archangel nudged Castiel with his elbow and jutted his chin toward Dean. Castiel looked over and gave Dean a look he interpreted as “I’ll speak to you later but later might not be for a while.” Dean made a face he hoped said “no rush, I’ll be here.”
Gabe was unusually somber. “We’re just gonna have to.” Cas sat down, defeated. “Cassie, listen to me. Listen to me! We’re going to need all we’ve got on this one, we’re gonna need you firing at top capacity, ok? We can’t have you –“
He was in his room toweling off when his phone started to ring. He checked the caller ID. Sammy. He could handle talking to Sammy. It would probably even cheer him up, given how excited Sam’s been for tonight. He swiped his finger across the screen and brought the phone up to his ear.
“Hey, David,” he said to the officer in uniform closest to Dean. “This one’s press. Let’s let him in.”
She leaned over to pour Dean his usual beer. Her shirt rode up and Dean saw an older looking guy eye her up and down. “Hey, creep, she’s my sister,” Dean said, scowling at him. The man raised his hands in a mock surrender and went back to his drink.
Dean walked over to the curb and stood in front of the man. “Castiel?” he asked, holding up his pen and notepad, “are you available for a brief interview right now?”
“Now, now, Kevin,” he heard a man say in a foreign accent. How did he know his name? “There’s no need for all this. We wouldn’t want to have to bring Linda in to quiet you down.”
“There’s something wrong here.” Anna said. “Crowley may be newly established, but he still has several centuries of experience working for Hell. He would never be foolish enough to organize this way.”
Castiel was sitting in the dorm lobby, watching over the unconscious students. Gabriel had come through earlier, and finished his sweep of the building, but Castiel was still waiting for the EMTs. He was contemplating why these kids had been knocked out but the ones at the music hall had not. And what would have prompted the soul exploration.
At first, Castiel said, he had thought he was free. He let out a sarcastic laugh then that just sounded so defeated in so many ways. Dean hated that broken noise. He knew what new-found freedom felt like and he wanted to go punch whoever had taken that away from Castiel in the face. Castiel talked about how Naomi pulled him out but kept him as her prisoner. Dean had wanted to scoop Castiel up right then and there and take him away from everything.
Archangel looked a lot like Loki from the bakery, but Dean was finding the idea that the joking, strange man from the bakery could be the serious, pulled-together Angel even more hard to believe than the idea that the Angels were somehow able to turn off their glowing eyes and make their wings disappear.
“This is,” Cas cleared his throat, making sure to remember the fake name Gabe had thought of. “Loki, the owner. Loki, this is Dean.”
The added challenge of trying to stay awake enough for office-level human interaction without caffeine was not a plus, but Dean had been ready to settle into a day of PR work. Then, someone from the telephone bank came and told him that there was something going on with the Angels and gave him the address.
The day prior, he’d even been able to finish working through the whole backlog of customer service complaints, so. Now he really had nothing to do. He’d spent two hours this morning drinking coffee. Not drinking coffee while going through emails, not drinking coffee while drafting a new story. Just. Sitting at his desk. Drinking coffee.
Charlie cut him off with a wave of her hand. “Yeah, yeah. I know you needed my nurturing feminine touch,” Charlie joked, fluttering her eyelashes at him.
“Dean, I’ve got you. Now just swing your other leg over and slide down the tree until you can rest your foot on this branch. It’s rather wide; I think it should fit both of us just fine.”
He’d looked that way because Cas had been unable to keep him safe. Because Cas hadn’t been able to do the one thing he was here for. Because–
The hood was lifted off his face. Kevin looked around. It seemed like he was in a limo or something. In the seat in front of him, facing him, was the man dressed in all black from the bus station. Sitting on either side of him were the two people who had been flanking him.
He’d also been working more than usual. Dean always got to work early, but lately he’d been staying late, too. He answered PR emails, finding a reprieve in their mind-numbing stupidity. Ugh, people were idiots. Considering their idiocy was currently his main coping mechanism, he probably shouldn’t complain. But he was going to anyway because, seriously people?
Dean closed his eyes and let out a groan. “Finally, something interesting!” Dean stood up from his desk and walked over to Bobby’s office. He leaned against the doorframe. “Yeah, Bobby?” he asked.
Castiel nodded his thanks to the EMT. Faster than an instant, he was picking up the two students at the end of the lobby farthest from the door, figuring he should work from the opposite end of the EMTs to meet them in the middle. He walked them out of the building, then secured them more steadily in his arms and started a human-paced ascent.
Then. A man walked in through the doors. He was dressed all in black, wearing a suit and tie. A woman in a jean jacket and combat boots and someone in business casual flanked him on each side. The woman’s eyes flashed black and she grabbed him. The person in business casual put a bag over his head and he could feel himself being dragged.
“Alright then, Jimmy” Dean said “Like Anna said, I’m here with the paper. I know that you donated a significant amount of money to us last year and, well to put it bluntly, I was wondering if you planned on doing the same this year?”
Castiel couldn’t believe it. He’d led legions into battle, withstood Naomi’s torture, witnessed the evolution of all manner of horrid species. Yet, it was here, in a ballroom in the middle of Kansas, that he felt the most nervous he had ever been.
After about half an hour, during which time Dean probably severely embarrassed himself in front of Cas a dozen times, they finally got to the ground.
Oh. Well that is rather rude. To prey on someone’s fear’s like that. Although perhaps you should keep a better watch on how many drinks you have.
“And left an almighty Word of God in a public dormitory building, filled with adolescents?” Anna added.
“Goo—” Dean started as Gabe came up to them and placed a coffee in front of Cas. Cas cursed in his head.
Castiel sighed. Messed up indeed. So many innocent bystanders drawn into a war between species they didn’t even know existed. He felt a wave of guilt wash over him. Sure, there had been no casualties this time, but what about the next? And after that? He was looking around at the mess that had been made of the college campus, watching as forensic technicians walked around and EMTs took the last few students away, when a familiar face caught his attention.
He almost wanted to laugh. To think, three weeks ago, the main thing bothering him was that some guy he barely even knew hadn’t wanted to give him his number. Things had changed so fast.
He quickly pulled himself out of his thoughts as he saw what looked like the detectives out front letting the Angels leave. The three of them spoke for a while. Then Castiel came over to Dean.
“You’re gonna arrive in the Impala, right? Ahead of everyone else?” Sam asked. “We can look for it when we get there.”
They caught her up. Anna hummed, thinking. “I have to say I agree with Gabriel on this one. With the demon involvement, and the past with both Alastair and his brother, Dean is going to be involved anyway. It might actually be easier to keep him safe with a more personal connection.”
He didn’t know why that idea disappointed him so much, though. It wasn’t like he didn’t see Dean outside their interviews anyway.
The man in front of him sighed. “Nothing, as of yet. It’s you I’m here for. As long as you cooperate, I should have no need to bring her in.”
Surveying the scene outside the building, it seemed like every cop in the city was there. At least every forensics personnel. Some of the people he saw looked like they couldn’t be much older than Kevin. He thought they had to be interns. The police would have to be desperate if they even had them out, working the field for an actual crime, not holed up in a lab.
He should stop unnecessarily frequenting Trickster’s Treats- stop trying to see Dean outside of their professional roles.
Charlie had invited a bunch of people for some party based entirely on a reference Castiel did not get. Apparently “May the fourth” was something worth partying about. When Cas had arrived he told Charlie he didn’t understand why the date was so exciting. She and Dean had gasped simultaneously and looked at Cas with the same comically wide eyes and mouth. Cas brought his hand up to cover his mouth as he laughed. “Is there a problem?”
Dean hadn’t even told Pamela about that word Alastair used to describe himself. He had figured Alastair was just crazy but… once the interview was over and Dean was back in his car… he couldn’t help but dwell on the revelation a bit. He’d thought there was no way demons were real… but then again if someone’d told him a couple years ago that angels and leviathans were real, he wouldn’t have believed that either. As he’d been sitting there in his car, he’d felt a panic attack coming on.
Cas was now keenly aware of the fact that he was not only in his pajamas, but had also not brushed his hair this morning and probably looked like a family of birds had attacked his head.
Eventually, in his desperation, with nothing else to do, his brain decided to start contemplating his feelings.
I feel you’d be surprised by my alcohol tolerance. You do know I grew up with Meg, right? And have you ever met my brother?
James Novak kind of stared at Dean for a while and as Anna left they seemed to have some sort of intense stare-down. The intensity Dean could see in Novak’s eyes and Anna’s back made him begin to doubt that they were entirely unentangled roommates.
Kevin froze again. Crowley could hurt his mom. He stilled his hands and heard the zipper on his bag being opened. The woman took something out and closed his bag again. She threw his shoulder forward, bringing him back face-to-face with Crowley.
Naomi flipped further through the report until she found it. “Ahh, I see. Castiel always was a bit too emotional.”
Gabe raised his eyebrow, clearly waiting for a response. Cas sighed. “Ok, ok. You’re right. Let’s go,” he said. He and Anna took off.
“Yeah, uh we got enough,” Dean said. “Thanks for your renewal, allowing us to keep the city informed and safe!” he said with an overly cheesy voice and a smile.
“Hey, Cas,” a deep, grumbling voice said. Cas felt the vibrations through his forehead. Then he remembered last night. Well, the first half of it.
Dean had been covering non-Angles stories in the meantime, but even then the only thing of interest that had occurred lately was a freak fire at one of Crowley’s warehouses. Dean had gotten there after the fire was already out, around the time of the arson investigators. Crowley had definitely beat them all to the punch, as the inside of the warehouse had clearly been relocated in a hurry.
Dean interrupted him. “Actually, I think that might’ve been the best thing that could’ve happened. They sent me to this home for troubled boys, or whatever. I learned a lot about myself. Like that I wasn’t really into, like, hunting down and ‘punishing’ the bad guys. More into helping people find the truth where it matters. What better way than a newspaper? Well, and it did help that my Uncle Bobby we went to live with after that owned one. For a bit when we first moved in I acted out, got in the with the wrong crowds, but… after a while I started to actually believe Bobby that maybe, things were ok. And then when I wanted to go after a career, he may have nudged me in the journalism direction.”
The three of them looked at each other – Gabe with his arms crossed, Cas squinting, and Anna deadpan. Anna rolled her eyes at Gabriel and continued, “the Angels, as far as the humans know, don’t live on Earth, don’t mingle with them. As far as the humans know, we live in Heaven and come down only for crimes; wear skintight, color-coded outfits all the time; have gigantic, visible wings all the time; and have colorful, bright masses of light where our eyes should be.”
They were discussing how much they should say to the municipal authorities when the first car with sirens parked outside. They had learned the hard way that humans… did not react well to their sudden apparitions. Humans preferred they fly slow enough and on the plane of reality such that humans could see them. Well, really, humans preferred that they walk. So, they flew to the door, then walked through it to meet the humans outside. Castiel still found it rather tedious at times, but the situations in which he typically met humans were, much like this situation, not a time when he could complain about it.
He must have taken too long. Dean said “I understand,” sounding defeated. Hearing Dean sound so sad was apparently not something Cas could stand.
Their first date had been on Friday, and now it was Thursday. Benny was having the time of his life giving Dean shit about how smitten he was already. Dean knew Benny was teasing, but he honestly had to agree. Dean went giddy every time his phone lit up with a new notification. He had even taken to answering his phone before he’d had his morning coffee, which was kind of a big deal.
Castiel liked watching the bees that lived in his backyard go about their daily duties. But sometimes they made him miss home. The colony had a structure. Had order.
Cas chuckled at his brother’s antics as he heard the bell above the door announce a new customer come in. Then he heard the unmistakable voice of Dean Winchester conversing with the cashier.
The next day at work Dean was sitting at his desk. He had sent his completed story to Charlie for publishing first thing in the morning. That was a bit after Benny had arrived. He didn’t cover many stories outside of the Angels, so he had no work at the moment. Which he hated. No work meant nothing to do but think. Not the most fun thing to do. He had been drumming his fingers on the desk but Benny was still working and gave him the stink eye so he stopped.
Castiel was sitting in the garden when his phone rang. There was no caller ID, but fortunately angels did not have to rely on such basic human technology. He knew it was Dean. He flew into the house where Gabriel and Anna were. “Dean Winchester is calling me.” He looked at them. “Should I answer it?”
Now more innocent people had been attacked. At another school he attended. It didn’t take a genius to put two and two together. Supernatural creatures making a bold attack on a college campus; they must have been looking for him and the stone tablet again.
The announcement system came on. His bus had arrived and was boarding passengers at door six. He stood up and started walking over there, when he saw a man do the same from a couple seats away. Kevin quickly turned and started walking toward the bathrooms instead, testing his theory. The man subtly switched his trajectory, too. He had to be another demon. Shit.
2)	Dean was fucked because the dude who just found him in arguably the most embarrassing position he’d ever been in (and he’d been in some pretty embarrassing situations) was Castiel. THE Castiel that Dean had had a definitely-not-crush-I-just-appreciate-your-face on for the past two years. The Castiel that Dean may-or-may-not have only showed up to this party for the hope of seeing. Dean was still too scared to look down, but he could recognize that voice anywhere.
“Yeah, I, uh, come here a lot.” 'Great,' he thought to himself. 'Real convincing and not suspicious a lot, Castiel.'
Gabe had informed the first ambulance to arrive that none of them were needed. Four cars of forensics had come since then. Cas was surprised, there usually weren’t nearly as many police officers there. Apparently, “a crime of this caliber” was making the city look bad and Mayor Roman wanted it dealt with as quickly as possible.
In the end, his mind kept circling back to that time he and Jimmy spoke when he was canvasing for donations. That was definitely Jimmy alone, nothing to do with any possible resemblance to anyone else. And that was what he couldn’t keep out of his mind. He’d had more fun in that one morning than he’d had in ages. And there was just something about Jimmy. Sure, he was funny and sweet and charming and smart and hot as hell, but on top of all that Dean felt almost as if there was something pulling them together. Like they were cosmically meant to be in each other’s lives.
i changed some stuff in the previous chapters, so if you've read them before you might want to skim them again.
But the return to normalcy after memories of Alastair had apparently signaled to his brain that it was time to go back to the small stuff. The really small stuff. Like, ‘a slightly embarrassing moment that happened three months ago and why the fuck does he even still remember it’ small stuff.
A couple people cheered as the last two walked over and an officer wrapped them in blankets to prevent shock. Meanwhile Dean approached Castiel.
Gabe shot up. Anna looked at him, surprised. “But bringing them here! Bringing them here – even with the big upstairs not so big, to bring them here, that would take an angel. We locked those things up six ways to Sunday. An angel is the only thing that could’ve possibly opened that can of worms on this dull plane.”
Bobby barely even gave a roll of his eyes at Dean not addressing him appropriately. Not a good sign, Dean thought. “Dean. I’m gonna cut right to it, boy. Sit down.” Dean did as he was told.
He pulled up to the scene and parked his Impala. He hadn’t passed any ambulances on the way there, which was strange for a skirmish involving the Angels. He supposed that was a good thing though, maybe this time the Angels were only apprehending criminals, not saving victims. When he got to the scene, however, he realized how wrong he was.
“Ok…” Sam said. Dean could tell he wanted to say more, but then Jess, angel that she is, interrupted him.
After what felt like an eternity but also like the blink of an eye she answered. He had fully dissociated by now. “Dean?” He couldn’t speak. He handed the phone to the Warrior.
Benny sat down on Dean side that Ash wasn’t standing at. “Hey, brother,” he said in greeting. He waved at Jo. “I’ll have what he’s havin’,” he said, nodding towards Dean’s drink.
Three months of normalcy was unnaturally long for Dean. He had nothing to do, but also no leads to go off the prove that this lull was a hoax. Sufficed to say, he was going a bit stir-crazy.
He opened his puffy eyes and looked over Charlie’s shoulder at his backpack. The tablet was in there. He had tried to get rid of it. He’d tried to dump it in Pennsylvania, in Virginia, and in Kentucky. But for some reason, he just couldn’t.
Every time he met someone interesting in the past month or so, he hadn’t been interested enough to ask them out on a second date. His mind kept drifting to a certain man with glowing blue-white eyes and wings. Who saved the day and busted down doors with his bare hands yet still looked at Dean with tenderness in his eyes. Which was annoying as hell, considering Dean definitely didn’t even have a crush on the angel. He’d been covering Cas’ stories for the past three months, but recently he had started wondering about the angel on a personal level. It definitely wasn’t a crush, though. Dean knew Castiel was way out of his league, and Dean Winchester did not waste his time on unattainable crushes.
He’s here, now. He’s safe. He can think about more pleasant things. About how he’s hugging his brother goodnight. About how his sister-in-law is smiling at him. About how he has a family and they’re here for him. Right now. And this is real.
Bobby gave another sigh. “Alright. Don’t say I didn’t try.” He gave one last look at Dean. “You don’t want to at least look at some of the names first? I can put out another offer, just bring one more person on to go around instead?”
Dean was leaning against Castiel’s arm. Cas could feel him breathing in and out as they watched the movie. They had done this many times before – sitting together, watching a movie. This time, however, felt a bit more personal. A bit more intimate. So it was killing Cas even more than usual, every time he had to tell Dean a not-quite-truth, and every time Dean called him Jimmy.
“Dude,” Dean said, “you’re telling me you’ve never seen Star Wars!?” Cas shrugged. Charlie screamed and immediately informed Cas that after tonight he wasn’t allowed to do anything in his free time but watch Star Wars. Dean vehemently agreed.
“OK, how does everyone already know about this?” Dean asked “my story doesn’t come out until tomorrow.”
Cas woke up the next morning with his mouth feeling cottony and a pretty bad headache. Though, thanks to Gabe and Meg he’d had worse.
Gabriel shot her a petulant face. “Really powerful prophets can sense the tablets. A powerful enough prophet, especially right after being activated and especially if within a few miles of a tablet, would be drawn to the tablet, seeking it out before even knowing really what it is.”
Dean could count on one hand the number of times he’d gotten a statement from someone other than Castiel. And even then, those had always been Renegade. The only times Dean had interacted with The Archangel were the time he’d inexplicably attached Dean to his car and the time he’d put Dean and Castiel on a first name basis, calling the serious and determined Warrior “Cassie”.
Dean typically had nothing to do on Sunday mornings or most Friday nights, but Cas had to go to church and work.
He got his car keys and walked out to his car, eager to meet Benny that night and unwind a bit after today.
“Uhhh,” Mark said, looking a bit flustered. It was clear he had not been prepared for questions. Luckily, one of the EMTs overheard, and answered as they were lifting the fourth student.
Dean couldn’t go back to work after that. He probably shouldn’t be alone either. And he definitely shouldn’t drive.
Dean wasn’t sure what to make of this guy. His food was great, for sure. Before he met Jimmy, Dean frequented this place enough to ‘know of’ Loki, even if he didn’t ‘know’ him. He’d known he was loud, a bit lewd in his jokes sometimes, and very eccentric. He and Jimmy were close, but he couldn’t quite figure out exactly what their relationship was. A small voice in the back of his mind went ‘they’re Angels together!’ but he quickly dismissed that. When Dean decided to pursue something more with Jimmy, he’d also decided to definitively stop entertaining the idea that Jimmy might also be Warrior. For the sake of his own sanity. It would just be too weird.
That was the first time one of the Angels had spoken to a reporter. Bobby assigned a couple other reporters to work angels cases on a rotation with Dean, but no one else ever got an interview. Bobby assigned Dean to work all the Angels reports after that, and the first time Dean tried to interview the Archangel he had, indeed, ended up glued to his car. It was not his finest moment.
Now a plan was formulating in Dean’s mind. If Sam’s invitation also came with a plus one, they probably all did…
A couple hours later, Cas still hadn’t found Dean again. Most were already at least a little buzzed. Well, the people who weren’t going to be driving home that night, at least. Of course Charlie always let people stay at her place the night after a party. If she thought someone was drunk she would forcibly take their keys and make up a bed for them.
He saw Dean’s own face break into a smile as he finally reached the front door. Dean kissed him in greeting. “Hey, sunshine.”
Bobby Singer looked up from his stack of papers. “Boy, it’s Mr. Singer at work; I’ve told you that a thousand times. Anyway, that superman of yours just hit downtown.”
Dean Winchester had a soul so strong that he withstood three weeks of Hell on Earth. He’d raised Sam strong enough to turn down the devil, to believe he could build his own happiness, with just the measly powers any human possesses. And now, thanks to Cas, Gabe, and Anna, Lucifer was stripped of his powers, rotting in a human prison.
The bell above the door rang, signaling that another customer had walked in. Dean turned around and saw that it was Benny. He waved him over.
Cas thought back to when he and his siblings had decided to make this town the base of their operations, and he had to think of a suitable background story to explain why anyone might know his alter-ego. When he had first crash-landed on this planet, Castiel had been too weak to fly, or even leave Earth’s main plane of existence at all. A shelter had taken him in. He had left once he was strong enough to go find Anna, but he had needed an explanation in case anyone recognized him.
Cas glared at Gabe. Gabe raised his hands in mock surrender. “I was just dropping off your coffees. Have fun, kiddos.” He said, winking at them as he walked away.
Cas had assured Dean that he would do nothing of the sort, reminding Dean that he was homeless not too long ago, and knew how hard it was to find a stable place. At least that wasn’t a lie.
And Cas had seen Dean’s soul many times since then. Every time their paths lined up enough for Dean to interview him, Cas got to see how much he had recovered. How healthy his soul was. How beautiful.
“No, no. No.” He was remembering the sigils now. The ones carved on the floor here. In blood. The ones he’d spent weeks staring at. Days being taught. Months being tormented by. The tears were falling now. “No. He was gone,” Dean whispered, as Castiel pulled him into a hug. “He was supposed to be gone.”
When the night came to an end, Dean they kissed goodnight at the doorway, and Dean could swear no moment of his life has ever felt so straight out of a movie.
“I think maybe move the picture to the right corner instead? I’m sure Charlie will have something more to say about that, though.” Dean said.
But that was a naive thought. And, if he was entirely honest with himself, that was probably for the best. He wasn't even sure whether he was into Jimmy for Jimmy or because he looked like Cas. Dean nodded and left.
“Hey, Jimmy. Uh. Hi. This is uh.” Cas heard Dean clear his throat. “This is Dean Winchester, from the paper?”
He was wiping his sweaty palms off on his jeans for like the fifth time when someone knocked on the passenger’s side window. He jumped and turned to look. It was Anna. Shit. He hadn’t even started the first date and had already managed to embarrass himself in front of the roommate.
Gabe went from joking to serious immediately, and Anna sat forward in her seat. “Information we can read?” she asked.
Anna cut him off: “Yes, and that would be the case, for running into any and all humans except Dean Winchester! Cas is right, he could potentially be onto something.”
“Speaking of the current King, I still think we’re better off appealing to him directly. He controls the gateways to Hell. With that kind of power, we wouldn’t need to go after the Earth-bound angels.”
Things had settled down in the time since the House of Horrors. Dean would even say things had been… completely normal. Which was highly suspicious.
Before he got the chance to find out the answer to that question, his desk phone rang from an internal call. He picked it up. From the other end Bobby gave a gruff “Dean come down to my office,” then hung up.
Because yes, if Castiel was honest with himself, Dean Winchester had the most wonderful soul he had ever seen.
Anna walked up to the door and put her hand on the knob. Gabe and Cas stepped into formation behind her, ready to strike if anything tried to attack. Although, that was unlikely. Castiel could not sense any life inside the house. He could, however, smell the human blood he was certain was staining the walls and floors. So much blood.
He should probably just learn how to steal or something, so that he didn’t have to keep putting other people in danger trying to get a job.
“He’s just this way,” he heard Anna say as she rounded the corner. She gave him a wink and he was confused until right then none other than Dean Winchester rounded the corner.
“Good morning, ma’am. I work for the newspaper. James Novak is one of our major donors and I was wondering if I could speak to him. Is he available here?”
hahaha so I lost all of my files, including the rough draft for this chapter and my plan for this story so the next few chapters are pretty much filler and I'm hoping to find what was list. Enjoy!
I have the next few chapters outlined, but to be honest I've hit a major writer's block when it comes to actually drafting them. So this will probably be the last update for a little while at least :(
“I’m heading out, Benny,” Dean said as he lifted his bag onto his shoulder. He patted it with his other hand. “Gonna talk to some rich folks, make sure they keep giving us money so we don’t all loose our jobs.”
“Yeah. You, the paper.” Henricksen sighed and looked over at the Angels. “They’ve been… I don’t know. Cagey. Lately. They’re hiding something from us. Well, obviously they’ve been hiding this whole… new species… thing,” he said, waving his hands around, trying to gesticulate at something that clearly had him perplexed. “So we know why they’ve been all weird these last few cases, but I don’t know, man.”
“But why search the dorms?” Cas asked. “Surely they would get all the information they need about whether or not a student is the prophet from soul examination?”
“Yeah. My dad was a cop, and so were both of my mom’s parents. I wanted to be just like them when I was younger.”
I can’t remember if they ever gave him a specific ethnicity in the series, but Kevin Tran’s name makes me think the character is supposed to be Vietnamese, hence my language choices.
“Hey, I thought you were on my side! That this outing would be fun, that no humans would catch onto us – “
The man groaned. “Uhhh. Hey, there, uh. Hey” Dean finished lamely, suddenly embarrassed to be found in a tree.
Dean spent the rest of the interview transcribing Archangel’s words without really taking anything in. At least he’d had that tactile action to focus on, or Dean definitely would have combusted on the spot.
At least, that had been the plan. What Castiel’s father seemingly hadn’t foreseen and planned on had basically sent everyone’s predetermined destiny to oblivion. Gabe had gotten tired of the fighting and run away, like the scared younger brother he was. Anna had loved the humans on the planet she was sent to protect so dearly that she chose to become one. Castiel…
“Yesh. You’re talking like you haven’t seen each other in ages. It’s been less than a week, buckos.”
Anna and Cas turned to glare at Gabe. He raised his hands in mock-surrender. “But I can see that that was not the point of this conversation, so continue, continue.”
He was half hoping that maybe the leviathans were just another lie. Another not-quite-truth that he and his brethren had been expected to swallow in the name of blind loyalty. In the name of faith. That maybe Gabe was wrong, that he had been duped, too.
“But it does matter, Cas, because they were hers.” Gabe said. He kept going, trying to reassure Cas. Cas knew Gabe was concerned, because he called him Cas, and he was speaking with an unusually serious tone.
Cas couldn’t help but smile back. He hadn’t really been processing the movie, too busy drinking in the newness of a date at Dean’s, but he did have one point of contention he’d been paying enough attention to register with the movie: “I’m not sure how I feel about the part where it was revealed at the end that the prophecy had been right the whole time, and everything that had happened was destined from the start.”
Dean walked back into the news building a couple hours later. He’d interviewed Castiel for a while and then stopped by the station to get Victor and a couple of the other cops who had been first to the scene.
His jawline was probably the sharpest thing Dean had ever seen. His eyes were the most piercing shade of blue Dean had ever seen. His hair… was not the sexiest Dean had ever seen, but it was definitely high up there. Very high.
Cas was grounded. (“Oooh, Cas. Did you do something naughty?;)” ”I may have accidentally shown up in the church parking lot naked, covered in bees. It is a long story” “Dude, you haaaave to tell me how that happened.”)
Hi so 2020 is still kicking my ass but I’m back atm. I still feel weird about the police though, so I think this will be the last chapter where they actually play in.
“I…” Dean looked down, realized his mistake, and quickly looked back up again. He lifted himself a couple inches off the branch, but then quickly sunk back down. “Sorry, Cas I can’t.” he said breathily. He bit his head against the tree trunk. 'Way to not look like a whimp in front of Cas.'
Cas was definitely taken aback; Gabe didn’t usually like to stick around for the press. In his words, he preferred more of a “leave it to Cassie because I have more entertaining things to do” approach. But Cas couldn’t argue about the lying part. Gabe was much more persuasive than he was and, if Cas was being honest, his head was already spinning trying to keep all the storylines they’d come up with straight.
Cas gave a small laugh at his brother’s antics and sighed. “Alright, alright. I’ll admit. You were right.” Gabe pumped his fists in the air.
Cas nodded that he understood. Dean was here to see James Novak, the philanthropist, not Annael and Castiel, the Angels.
Benny was writing a piece that had to fit in a particularly odd shape for the next day’s paper edition, so he had asked Dean to look at the layout for a second opinion before Benny sent it to Charlie. Dean had rolled his chair around his and Benny’s little desk cluster and was sitting next to Benny’s desk, reading his screen.
As he walked home he tried not to think about Naomi, but he couldn’t help himself. By the time he got inside he collapsed, overwhelmed with emotion
He looked at Cas with concern in his eyes. Castiel wondered if Dean knew about his past with Naomi. He’d heard people on the streets whispering rumors. Or maybe this situation was reminding Dean of when he himself was a prisoner, and Castiel had rescued him.
Cas gave a fond sigh. Dean had brought up this concern many a time. He tried to reassure him “I don’t know if you noticed, but Anna isn’t exactly shy. If she wanted you to come here less, she’d tell you.”
“And that will feel like years to them,” Anna said by way of agreement. “Gabriel, you’re the fastest. Round up everything you can find that will be helpful to us but not to the human authorities.” Gabriel wasted no time in flying off. Anna turned back to Cas. “Cassie, you’re not great with people, but go see if there are any other areas where they’re like this. If they’re in a condition to travel, bring them here so the EMTs don’t have to go so far. I’ll stay with these kids.”
Dean’s smile dropped. He wrapped Castiel in a hug. Cas was so embarrassed. He had seen eras rise and fall, had lost legions, lost friends, lost charges. He shouldn’t be crying over a fictional movie.
On the car ride over they talked about the homework in their classes together, which somehow ended up as a conversation about cheeseburgers, which apparently, Cas loved even more than bees. And that dude loves bees. Dean had to say, Cas continually surprised him.
Cas hissed at him. “Don’t draw attention. He’s already seen us all together. Now he’s met all of us as the Angles and as civilians you two are the only ones he’s seem James Novack interact with. He has to be on to us.”
Dean nodded and headed out. He pulled his jacket off his chair and grabbed his keys and camera from his desk.
Castiel was still not convinced that ‘a night out on the town,’ as Gabriel had put it, would possibly help them at all. “It’s healthy for us to take a break, Cas. It’s a good thing,” Anna said.
But he still didn’t know what, if anything, he should do about the situation. It was possible that Dean hadn’t noticed his siblings with him at the bar, or hadn’t put all the pieces together. Dean was very smart, so Cas somewhat doubted that. But, as Anna had mentioned, when the three of them went about as the Angels they gave the humans no hint that they walk among them every day, or are even capable of making themselves look human. So maybe Dean hadn’t connected the dots. Only time, and Dean, would tell. He decided to just wait, and see what Dean did. But maybe…
Dean thought back on the few interactions he had had with Anna, too. Most were… extremely awkward, in his opinion. But they had been getting less awkward, as time went on. Although he did still feel bad for intruding on her with all the dates he’d had at her house. But he tried to focus on her, push aside all the awkwardness shrouding his memories of her as the boyfriend’s roommate and instead consider what he’d learned of her as Anna Milton.
“Anna,” he said, tugging on his sister’s arm. She stopped walking and turned to face him. “Anna Dean’s here.”
Anna was making a concerned face and leaning over to be eye-level with the car. He rolled down the passenger window so she could talk to him. “Are you alright? I was on my way out but you seem to…” she paused and clicked her tongue, clearly trying to think of a word to say next. “You’ve been parked here a while.”
Dean tried to insist that he really was just here on official business, but if he was honest with himself, he didn’t have anywhere to be in any rush, and the food did smell divine. So, even after the philanthropist with the piercing blue eyes said he did plan on making a repeat donation this year but, “I do feel bad if you came all the way out here just for that. Maybe you’d like to take some food as recompense? It’s from Trickster’s Treats, do you know it?” can you really blame Dean for staying? A man has needs, and if Trickster’s Treats’ breakfast is half as good as their pie…
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, how about you? What made you decide to leave the family business?”
I also spent the majority of my winter break revamping my tumblr so if u wanna check it out it's maybe-i-will-fandom. I don't really post any supernatural anymore though.
Dean asked Castiel if he could tell him what it was like under Naomi. Castiel told him how when he refused to do what Naomi wanted, she said she would break him. She tortured him daily. He told Dean “I wished every day that I were dead. The things she made me do…” he felt tears prickling at his eyes. He took a moment to compose himself.
Just as a heads up, I do think this chapter ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, and it might be a while before my next update. It feels weird to be writing a story with police in it given all the atrocities. And global and local circumstances mean I have less time to write starting this week and when I do have time I am finding less motivation. I very much intend to finish this work, but I will be updating much less regularly than I have been these past few weeks. Safe wishes to everybody.
Cas continued. “Under Naomi,” he had said Dean, “I wished every day that I were dead. The things she made me do…” he had looked away with tears forming in his eyes. He cleared his throat. “She has powerful sources of intel and knows pretty much anything going on in the city at a given time. She forced me to… do things. Terrible things. I hated them, Dean, I hated myself! I almost couldn’t live with myself afterwards.” Dean was heartbroken.
These were the last five prisoners. One had gone ahead to lead them out as Castiel carried two others, one in each arm. He positioned himself so that he could watch the other two, supporting each other on the way out.
Dean couldn’t help but start laughing, he was so excited. He stood up. As he walked by to go to the other room to make the call, he kissed Jimmy with little pecks of appreciation all over his face until the other man was laughing, too.
Loki smacked his lips and turned to look up at the menu. “Idk, man, he likes peanut butter. He likes honey,” he turned back to face Dean, “maybe something with that? To be honest, I don’t see the guy actually eat that much.”
“I'm talking about the fact that you’ve stopped by the bakery every day this week, ever since you heard that reporter say he likes my pie. I have to admit, he’s got good taste in food as well as men,” he said with a wink toward Castiel. Castile blushed as Gabe continued “but maybe you should come up with a better strategy for seeing your lover boy than just… waiting around here, hoping he’ll show up.”
The officers in the first car had, after a brief moment to recover from seeing the inside of the house, informed the station that what they had walked in on was “way out of our pay-grade. There’s so much blood!”
An assistant walked in and placed a report on the desk before leaving. The Leviathan picked up the report and thumbed through it. He continued as if Naomi hadn’t even spoken. “And it seems their extended stay has also made our wing-trimmed friends grow a bit too attached to the surroundings, too. Even easier.”
He’d known about Samuel Winchester his entire life. All angels knew the vessels that could suit an archangel if they chose to visit Earth of their own free will (as opposed to being a runaway like Gabriel, stuck in a human approximation of his essence, without access to one’s full angel powers on earth like a vessel allows). He’d known about Samuel Winchester before apes even existed. The whole Winchester line was quite famous actually. Dean and Samuel, able to host Michael and Lucifer respectively. John Winchester, destined to kill Azazel. Mary Campbell-turned-Winchester, the world-renowned hunter whose death was to start it all. The family that was to carry out the apocalypse.
No. Not Channing. The demon possessing Channing. Because demons were real. And they’d killed his girlfriend. And apparently his soul had a destiny so great that they’d tracked him across half the continent to attack again.
Dean decided to take the time while Castiel was conferring with Renegade and Archangel to review his theory in his mind. He started by brainstorming ways he could get more information.
Castiel had been new to human interaction back then. He had tried his best to assure the man that he had been saved. He did not quite know what would be the best way to ensure Dean’s safety from that point, but the man had been throwing up a lot so Castiel had dropped him off at the nearest place where he smelled food.
“I just don’t see why hosting such an extravagant event is necessary. I mean, won’t it just draw unwanted attention?” the angel asked, straightening her lapels indignantly.
They watched Dean for a few more moments. He hit his head against the steering wheel and started rolling it back and forth. “Perhaps that would be best,” Cas replied.
When Gabe was done Cas thanked him. He couldn’t stop worrying though. “Naomi… she has so many more,” he said in a broken voice.
Considering how big the last Angels case had been, most people were finding this sudden silence a bit concerning. Dean was a bit concerned too, but mostly he was glad for the break, to be honest. He’d sent Charlie his piece on the house that first day, but he hadn’t been able to write the follow-up story. The reporter who’d covered that had dubbed the case the “House of Horrors”. The name had caught on and had not exactly helped the public remain calm. The mounting public hysteria was not making Dean’s attempts to shake his own fear that something big was coming any easier, but he was trying.
Dean nodded again, his throat tight with emotion. He walked past them all, up to stairs to where the bar ended and the Singer-Harvelle house was. He should probably thank them, but he physically couldn’t bring his throat to make sounds right now. They probably knew. He loved them so much.
“Hello, Dean. Is there something wrong? I thought you said the paper had been able to get enough money?” He started chanting in his head. Please don’t ask about the Angels please don’t ask about the Angels please don’t –
He had concluded that Naomi must have been the one to teach the demons that particular trick, as soul examination was usually something only angels and extremely powerful demons could do. He still couldn’t figure out why, though.
Castiel looked at Dean. He didn’t know what to say. He hadn’t known that the man had felt like such a burden on others. He should probably try to -
Dean quirked his lips up in what Cas surmised was supposed to be a smile. “Yeah. Hope so,” he said, and started the car.
Anna came over and put a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, it’s ok. We’re doing the best we can, and that, right now, is the humans’ best chance, ok? But you can’t keep beating yourself up, Cas. And you can’t keep letting utter pessimism be your only outlet, ok? It helps no one.”
Castiel gave a meek laugh “It’s been months, I should be able to liberate some prisoners by now. It shouldn’t matter that their hers.”
He had not seen sigils since he was being held captive by Alastair, so he decided he would definitely not go down that train of thought. Maybe he’d bring it up with Pamela later
He was still trying to come up with an explanation eleven minutes later, when he heard the approach of the first EMTs. From the sounds of it there were five EMTs with 4 stretchers. Eventually they came through the door. Castiel corrected his original assumption: there were 4 EMTs, each with a stretcher, and the fifth person was a uniformed officer. The EMTs got straight to business, helping each other gently lift the four students closest to the door onto the stretchers. The officer walked up to Cas.
“I didn’t find any more sigils, and no bodies or blood. It just looked like a house that hasn’t been lived in for years,” Cas said to Anna, upon his arrival.
“I was young. Sammy doesn’t even remember her. But it changed my dad. And not for the better. He quit the force to work freelance. Doing the same stuff, basically, but he was obsessed with finding her killer. Moved us all around the country looking for him.”
“She’s never… I think the expression is ‘she’s never taken shit from anybody and doesn’t plan on starting.’ So I always looked up to that.”
“No, I’m perfectly fine giving the interview,” Cas responded, “and I know how we’ve decided to go about telling the humans about the leviathans, but what about the prophet? How am I supposed to explain an attack on a college without revealing the prophet’s existence and approximate age to every scared human in this town?”
A man opened the door. Dean walked in and the man closed the door behind him. Dean approached the desk in the center. The man sitting there looked up.
The man placed the coffees in front of them and James said something. They seemed to know each other. Dean registered it in the back of his mind. The two people he knew that Jimmy knew both bore striking resemblance to two of the Angels. And Jimmy himself did look a lot like Castiel.
Dean got down on his knees and started to kiss the earth in front of him. He let out an appreciative groan. “I have never been so happy to see the grass! I LOVE YOU DIRT! Ohhh! I am ready to accept the ground as my lord and savior!!” Cas rolled his eyes at his childish behavior.
