“Because it is more than it is.  You could hate us all.  Blame us, blame me, blame this whole kingdom for your circumstances.  But, you don’t,” Tony pointed out, almost sounding only mildly curious, though Steve knew that was hardly the case.  “It would be understandable, I suppose, if you did.  After all, a slave is not required to care for his Master.  Only obey.  And yet, you care far too readily and far more deeply than you likely should, and dole out obedience in careful measure, as if you only have so much of it to give,” Tony mused, then let out a sharp laugh.  “Perhaps you do.”
should be.  But, certainly, nothing like this should be here.  He wasn’t even sure if it should exist at all, so unnerving was the realization that it might have been here his whole life. Longer, even, by the looks of it.  Protected from prying eyes up here in the far reaches of the mountain.  In hiding, he thought, feeling a chill course over his skin that had little to do with the air.
.  As in, the absence of nothing, which--which he would take. Maybe he shouldn’t, but he couldn’t seem to help himself from clinging to the whole idea of it.  Of it being something. Meaning something.
The garage was much the same as Tony remembered it, though the workstation had been upgraded several times in the past decade, tools replaced, and a new fabrication console added.   There were other changes, of course, accumulated over the decade.  Two bikes hung from a rack on the wall, mementos from their brief foray into mountain biking that ended when a tree nearly got the best of Tony.  On the other hand, they did get a good three year’s worth of firewood out of that thing by the time Steve was done, so there was that.  A nearly pristine set of golf clubs sat in a black bag in one corner.  Golf had seemed like a good enough idea, until Steve shot an eighteen on his first round while Tony dripped sweat in the California sun.  Stacked bags of shelled nuts lined the far wall.  Storing up for winter, Tony thought with a small smile. A dull silver ladder stood behind the bags, partially obscuring a framed Back to the Future poster.  A dry erase board hung on the wall by his workstation with a reminder to call Agent Paz accompanied by a doodle of Tony asleep in his chair with big Z’s floating above him.  He was pretty sure that message was at least two years old.
“Sure was nice for the prosecutor to have all those documents showing the transactions and money trail right there on Camp’s computer like that,” Steve commented.
Steve’s smile grew, and he stood up, then picked up the frame that sat on top of Tony’s workstation, since this was where he spent most of his time if he was away from Steve.  He stared down at the scrawl of words on the back of a check for a million dollars for a long moment before setting it back down next to the other pictures that littered Tony’s desk.  Him and Steve at various events, on trips, and one of them at Steve’s graduation from art school with Steve in bright blue robes and Tony beaming proudly next to him.
“Up, up!” Zola said, clapping his hands together.  “You, go on now and get ready for tonight.   You’ll do well, I’m sure, but we mustn’t keep Lord Stane waiting.  Ah, the white robe for him, of course.  Yes, that will do nicely.   Off you go,” Zola tittered as one of the attendants took Cam by the shoulders and led him out. The boy gave a quick, furtive look over his shoulder at Steve, who lifted his chin in a silent salute, while a burning rage clawed its way up his spine.  There was nothing he could do that wouldn’t get both of them killed, not with thousands of guards and an entire city between them and any chance of freedom, but the urge to do
.  Steve almost snorted.  He still wasn’t sure who he had been angrier at the day Tony’s secret was revealed, himself or the idiot who was supposed to be running their country, not galivanting off on crusades with Steve and the rest of his ragtag group of misfits.
Steve gave the men a last, long look, then nodded and followed a few footsteps behind.   He stepped onto the platform next to Tony. Cam followed, looking upward with no small amount of concern.  A young boy rushed forward to close and lock the gate, someone gave a shout, and the men set their backs to it, digging in to the well-worn groove in the ground beneath their bare feet and slowly forcing the wheels to turn.  It didn’t take long for the cables to go taut, lifting the caged platform off the ground with a surprising steadiness.
“Handling it? Is that what you’re calling it?” Tony demanded, voice going soft. Steve looked away, then down, before lifting his eyes back to Tony with a plea in them. “Don’t give me that look. This isn’t Afghanistan, Steve, it’s fucking Brooklyn.  You can’t—” he broke off, mouth flattening into a thin line.  “What’s this ‘list’ they were talking about anyway?” Tony asked, eyes narrowing on Steve.
He signed heavily and rubbed the fingers of one hand into his temples, tapping the phone against his chin before pushing himself up again.  He looked over at Steve, who was still pondering the douchery of Duncan, but Tony was left with the feeling that if he had looked a split-second sooner, Steve would’ve been looking at him.  He scrubbed his free hand over his face and hit the call button for Pepper.
Two days later, as he rode in the back of the limo over to SHIELD’s West Coast headquarters where the meeting with Captain Rogers was supposed to take place, Tony thought his mom might have won at least one round.  Yesterday had been filled with one appointment after the other filing through the mansion with their lotions, oils and colognes, waxes and powders, scented shampoos and designer clothes, making sure Tony looked the part, down to the white lace underwear that kept trying to creep its way up his ass like it had its own secret mission to pave the way.
“Not even if I was literally dying of thirst in the desert. I have actual life experience on this, so that’s a pretty solid no,” Tony remarked with a wave of his hands.  He walked over and took the seat at the head of the table, swiveling in the black, leather chair until it faced the window.  “Pepper?”
“Right.  So, anyway, Romotive also has a small, but not totally unimpressive, medical research division doing—I’ll give you one guess,” Tony said.
The bedroom was beyond two large, white doors that Steve somehow managed to open one-handed. The bed itself stood at the center of the room, enormous and covered in white linens that shone against the light spilling in from one of the large windows that overlooked the city.  Steve laid Tony out on the center of it, following him down as Tony grasped at him, pulling, taking Steve’s weight on top of him.
“No, it isn’t,” the man agreed, somewhat sagely, as if he knew which one Steve meant, though Steve figured he was just being polite. It wasn’t as if a man like this would pay any mind to a place like Steve’s, except to maybe think how awful it must be to live in a place like that.  “But, still, it is quite late at night for one so young to be out.  Dangerous. You never know what might be lurking about at night,” he added in a light, teasing tone, his eyes sparkling a bit.
As plans went, it wasn’t his best, Steve admitted to himself as he crawled over to where Hammer sat.  It was pleasant to think about though.  He thought he might think about it a lot in the next few minutes.  Thinking about killing Hammer might be the only thing that kept Steve alive in the next few minutes. We’ve moved a bit beyond hoping for a glimpse of the sea, haven’t we, Rogers, he thought.
Maybe he just didn’t have enough experience with compliments to understand they were supposed to make you feel like your skin was crawling, he thought derisively.  He looked up at Steve, who had dropped his gaze to the folded newspaper in front of him and was scanning the articles above the fold.
“Sometimes, I open my eyes and instead of the bottom of a bucket, I see you there, floating, and you’re calling out to me, and I can’t get to you. Someone has my arms, and I can’t get to you, but I promised, see?  I promised not to let you go, and so I have to—I have to—but I can’t breathe, I can’t move---and then I wake up,” Tony whispered, eyes shining.  “Then I wake up, and you are there, and I can breathe again and when I swallow, it doesn’t feel like water filling my throat.  Do you think me weak?  Do you judge me the lesser for this?”
“God-dammit,” he muttered under his breath, barely said before the wind took the words, and the screen went black.
“You are so close already,” Tony mused, sounding inordinately pleased.  “Just from me using your mouth.”  Steve hummed agreement and pushed up against Tony’s hand, though Tony dropped it to his side and tutted.  “Oh, no, I think not.  Not this time, when so much is before me.”
, Steve thought, stomach whooshing in a freefall, the air leaving his chest like it had been punched out of him.
People were looking at him, really looking--maybe seeing, maybe for the first time--and it probably should have bothered him, but he wanted them to see.  To see and to know.  To know that they shouldn’t talk about Tony, not like that.  No one should.  That, he decided, was a good thing, and if what he could do got him that one, good thing, he was going to let them look and not care.
Steve’s hands curled into fists against the counter, where the little vines wound themselves along the edges.
,” Anthony admonished lightly, then reached out and ran a hand through Steve’s hair, light and gentle, and God, so good, Steve wanted to lean into the phantom feeling, chase it until he could find whatever that was.  Warmth, soft and soothing, and not the brittle, stinging pinpricks of brightness that came with not being cold anymore.
Steve looked over at the calendar taped to the wall.  It featured pictures of horses running through meadows and splashing down beaches and was two years out of date, so he always had to recalculate the days.  You could forget in here, if you weren’t careful.  Lose track.  Or just stop caring.  What did it matter if it was Monday or Thursday, except that the Thursday lunch had cornbread, and Monday’s was whatever was leftover from Friday because the supply trucks didn’t deliver on the weekends.
“Funny,” Steve replied.  His hands came up to wrap around Tony’s upper arms.  “You’re beautiful, you know that, right?”
“You were there with your friends. I guess they were your friends, anyway. I'd never met them. You said,” Steve started, clearing his throat. “You said you'd had fun. You know. Sowing wild oats and all that. But, you couldn't live like that. Everyone understood. They were very sympathetic. That one guy once had a fling with the pool boy, he said. The girl—Whitney? She got her dance teacher fired after they were found out. She was much more discrete with the riding instructor though. Live and learn. You don't marry them, though. Important to remember,” Steve said woodenly.
“God, you…you…you’re just…” Tony was saying, staring down at him, and Steve let his head fall back against the bed and closed his eyes.  Ok, so he was probably going to get kicked out and who could blame Tony?  This was hardly the way things were supposed to go.
“I’ll let him flip a couple of cars in the parking lot or whatever, and it’ll be fine,” Tony hummed, then pursed his lips and tapped a finger to the side of his cheek. “He likes that. Says its relaxing. I’m fairly sure he’s screwing with me, ‘cause he has this weird sense of humor that’s almost like dad jokes, but with more violence, so I don’t—”
“Hungry?” Tony asked.  Steve nodded. Ravenous, he decided.  And thirsty. His throat was parched, but he felt good.  Better than good. A little sore, like he had just finished a training session, but not a bad sore.
Steve thought to say something else, but wasn’t sure what. He knew he would do it, though. One day. One day, he would draw Tony, just like this, even if it was only a memory. There was something incredibly intimate and alluring about the idea of drawing Tony like this, maybe because it belonged only to them, even if Tony would never see it. Steve would draw it, one day, and he would know that it would please Tony, and that… that was something. He blinked, looking up at the sun, then back down, dark spots dancing across his vision.
“Sure, let’s just set aside your massive blackhole of self-esteem issues that have been intertwined with Steve since you were a child, because I’m sure that has nothing to do with the problem at hand,” Pepper muttered as she stretched back in her chair, massaging her temples with her fingers.
“Yeah. Exactly,” Tony said, flashing a flat smile at Steve.  “Guess we should head in, huh?” he jerked his head towards the limo’s window, where a couple of tourists were leaning close enough that their breath was practically fogging up the glass.
“Yeah.  Night, Brock,” Steve said. It only took a few minutes before Brock’s steady snores cut into the air conditioner’s loud susurration of air.
“I guess probably some people...wait, the tabloids?” Steve replied with a frown as he tugged the bedspread down and climbed into the bed.  He stared up at the ceiling where two fire sprinklers hung like weird metal stars.
Steve nodded, though he didn’t know.  Hadn’t known.  Any of this, really.  Iron Man said he grew up thinking of Captain America as something of a hero.
“Hey, I was thinking,” Brock began as he took a sip of the beer.  “How about we have a little get together with Jack and the rest of ‘em this week.  Little celebration kind of a thing, what d'ya say?”
Steve just stared at the man. He should jerk his hand away, out of the man’s clutches, but he--he couldn’t.  Or didn’t, whichever. His chest tightened.  He couldn’t swallow.  The tea curdled in his belly. Almost time, he repeated to himself.  Time. The sword hanging over everyone’s head, inching closer each day.  Time for what? Did he know what Tony was talking about? He thought, maybe, he did. Maybe not the whole of it, not yet, but he knew something.  There was a deep truth lurking underneath the man’s words. It was almost time.
see it,” Tony pointed out triumphantly.  “And I’m fine.  Bruce even said this was not like the whole bonding thing.  Bagel?” he asked Steve, holding up a sesame one.  “Isn’t that right, Bruce?” Tony called.
They took the steps up to one of the large lecture halls, with its rows of seats spread out in a rising semi-circle from the professor’s lectern at the center of the room, in front of a large projection screen that where the Microsoft logo bounced around like it was playing Pong, which, when you thought about it, was oddly apt.
“This is Steve. He’s my Omega.   We’re bonded,” Tony proclaimed to the woman pushing the cleaning cart down the hall towards the restrooms.  “I’m going to stop. Really.  Any minute now.”
“My brother’s spell was intended for me, to take my knowledge of the aether, and what it can do, and steal from me the truth that he sat the throne in our Father’s place,” Thor explained, sounding grim.  “Our Captain threw his shield and deflected Loki’s spell at the last moment, or that would have been my fate. Now, I fear, it is he who must suffer this violation. As Loki has escaped to realms unknown, I can only hope there is some aid for the Captain to be found on Asgard.”
He thought about Steve’s face when he promised to help him find Barnes, the absolute certainty that Tony could do, would do it, because he said so, the unwavering faith he hadn’t had in…well.  A long time.  That’s how it starts, he thought.  He fell in love with how Steve made him feel about himself almost before he fell in love with Steve.  Maybe that’s what love is, when you got right down to it.  Steve didn’t lie, which meant he could be the person Steve saw when he looked at him like that, and he wanted that more than he would have thought possible.
Tony started to step away, then stopped and stood back, leaning over and placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “If it is too much…if you need me to stop, you will tell me,” Tony said.  “That night with the chains, I worried I pushed you too far and you weren’t ready, but you did so well. But this—you must promise to tell me if it is too much.”
“Oh my God, I’m leaving,” Rhodey shouted, throwing his hands up in the air and heading for the door.  “I’ll be in the car, you dork.”
“I’m glad, Tony. I really am,” Steve replied, Tony’s words making him think back to his conversation with Cam about the collective sum of the people of the Free States, though he wouldn’t say that to Tony. He frowned. “What of these… ring tribes the General mentioned?”
He’d been worried, Tony realized, the truth of it startling him.  Steve had been worried about him.  No, not worried.  Scared.  Steve had been scared.  He could hear the echo of it in the memory of Steve’s voice, now that he was actually paying attention to something other than how much he hated being berated, and particularly coming from Cap. But there it was. Steve had been scared. Because of him.  That’s why Steve flew off the handle like that.
, he missed him.  The time his parents forgot his birthday when he was eleven, and he spent it alone in his treehouse.  It had been so cold up there, so very, very cold. All around him, and he ached, it hurt, it hurt so much, even now, when it shouldn’t.  The smell of his mother’s perfume. She put the little glass bottle back down on her vanity next to a picture from his parents’ wedding day, when they were smiling and happy for what Tony could only assume was the last time.  Jarvis, putting a cool cloth on his head when he had a fever.
“Oh, don’t even--Look, much as it pains me that Alec Baldwin gets to hold both the #1 and #2 slots on the TMZ celebrity street fight list, can we take this circle-jerk inside?”  Tony demanded flatly, gesturing towards the building.
.  Because it was.  Younger, yes, obviously.  He would have been, what? Steve’s mind skidded over the numbers…twenty-one, Steve realized.  Right around Steve’s age when he joined the Army. Steve had only ever known Tony as older than him, brash and bold, with years of tragedy and triumph under his belt.  Larger than life. That was Tony.
“I’d rather this kind of pain than the other,” Steve said, and found that it was true, though he wasn’t even sure where the words themselves came from. It was a better kind of pain, this stiff burning tightness in his back, than thinking about the things behind it. Easier somehow to feel this physical hurt, focus on that, but he thought that easier might not be better, not really. His mind playing tricks on him, giving him ways not to think until he lost himself to dreams that had no such barriers. There was a phantom pain tingling up and down his arms, and he remembered it, the sting of feeling coming back to them. It wasn’t real, but it was real enough, he thought, a deep shudder wracking his body. Behind him, he could hear Tony draw in a shaky breath, but he said nothing. “Please. Please, Tony. It—I need you. To do this for me.”
“You don’t say?” Tony muttered under his breath. “Look, if you're not interested in doing this, fine, forget it. Not like this was exactly how I wanted to spend my evening.”
He pressed his mouth to Tony’s, catching a puff of warm breath on his lips, the scratch of beard on his chin, and the hint of taste just beyond Tony’s lips.  He had no idea what to do, he realized.  For all they’d done, Tony had never really kissed him, and that left his sole experience with the tavern girl Bucky sent his way with cheap ale and what Bucky later called a heart full of patriotism, though Steve didn’t think it had been her heart Bucky had been eyeing.
“Thanks,” Tony replied.  He walked over to the counter by the stove and poured himself a cup of coffee, then took his seat opposite Steve.  “Looks good,” he observed.
“Hey,” Steve said from behind Tony’s back.  He was leaning a shoulder against his doorframe, hands shoved in his pants pockets.
“I hope you’re right,” Steve said, glancing off uncomfortably towards the distant peaks. Would Tony continue his plan if Steve was not there to see it? Or would he let his anger at Steve ruin such an opportunity to do something truly good? “It’s a good thing you’re doing, Tony. Whatever the reason behind it. I—I know your heart… your heart is good, Tony. You should trust it. Don’t forget that.”
On the far wall, opposite the door, an opening had been cut into the wall. Framed by sturdy black rubber vaguely shaped almost like a heart with a block of padding protruding underneath for support, the opening was filled by a supple, rounded ass spread wide enough that Steve could see the red rim of the man’s hole gaping loosely and shining with lube.
Steve wasn’t expecting the sudden coolness in his mouth.  The ice hit his tongue in a burst of cold. It felt wonderful there, like a balm on a burn, melting into his dry mouth and coating his throat.
“Go on.  I’ll give you the run down on the upcoming Board meeting later,” Pepper called out as Tony stepped into the elevator, the door sliding closed on the last of her words and whatever it was she and Rhodey were about to talk about.  Him, obviously.  Some little tete-a-tete entitled How Do We Solve a Problem Like Tony’s Terrible Past Life Choices, probably, he thought with a beleaguered sigh, though their shared indignation was something truly inspirational to behold.
Right????  Not to downplay the awfulness of Anon’s sucky interaction with their professor, but maybe this will cheer Anon up a bit. I wish I could do the same for Anon, but I’ll have to go with fantasy.
“Steve?” Cam called out, slowing Steve’s steps at the sound of his name.  When had it started to sound strange on anyone’s lips other than Tony’s?  He didn’t know.  “I know, before.  When you first arrived.  I saw what they did to you.  I know you did this for me.  I don’t know why.  No one’s ever…I mean, I’m just me.  No one, really.  I didn’t matter.  But, I did to you, and…I—I know how I seem to you sometimes.  It’s just…I would wish for you happy here, too.  Not just the King.  You. You could be, I think.  When you are with him, you are happy.  I see it.  And he is happy, too.  He smiles and teases and laughs, and you—you are so pleased when he laughs for you!  I see this and—I would wish for you to be like that all the time.  So, you should be with him more, and then you will both be happier, I think.  That is all.”
Steve limped out carefully, each step sending a cascade of want stabbing through his aching cock.  He rubbed his palm over it and pressed down at the base, to no avail.  One of the guards opened the door for him and he stepped out into the hallway, where two of Zola’s flower-crested guards waited to escort him back.  He swallowed his embarrassment and tried to concentrate on walking without causing more of an issue.  The guards didn’t seem concerned with Steve’s condition and nudged his shoulder to hurry him along.  Back at Zola’s compound, they led him to his room and one of them lifted the long metal lockbar from the door, while the other gave Steve a hard shove inside.
“I heard he was so overcome with remorse, he even created a website where he confessed to his crimes,” Steve continued.  Really, Steve’s faith in humanity was one of his best qualities, Tony thought.  “What was that name again?  It had such a nice ring to it. Oh, right.
“Sure thing,” Tony answered, wondering if his voice really sounded that high and excited. Somewhere between doing his best half-drowned, wire-tapping rat impression in Steve’s hallway and their entirely too serious debate over Star Trek versus Star Wars, he’d started thinking of exactly how to break it to Steve that he did a lot of things for money, but not that, though he was more than aware just how fine a line he was cutting there, and that Steve’s life, whatever happened after today, was about to get a hell of a lot easier. With the stupid amounts of money Pepper had him donating to various art schools, they could damn sure find a scholarship looking for a recipient, at the very least. And surely, SI needed…whatever it was Steve wanted to do. Fuck it, he’d just buy Baskin Robbins. Yes, this seemed like a good plan, he thought rather desperately.
“Huh? Oh, no.  No, nothing like that,” Tony assured him.  He didn’t want Steve to worry. “Though with all the honeydew they put in those things, it wouldn’t surprise me.  What?  It’s a filler fruit, everyone knows that!”
By the time they arrived, Steve was starving, which he imagined Tony knew he would be.  The two guards took up their post outside the door and gave Steve a deferential nod as he ducked inside. The chambers he shared with Tony at Greenbriar sat atop a turret, lushly appointed in lush fabrics of greens, blues and golds. A large harvest tapestry stitched with fruit, barley, cloves, and all manner of bounty hung above a huge stone fireplace opposite a thick-postered bed carved with stalks of wheat, acorns, berries and leaves, leaving no doubt where Greenbriar’s riches lay.
After Tony settled the check, they strolled through the casino, with Tony waving at a few of the people who shouted his name.
Still, he could close his eyes and see Pepper’s face in that moment before she’d caught herself and shuttered her expression when he showed her his wrist. He’d wanted her to know, was all. Before they really committed to try something together. Unbonded couples were the norm, after all. Billions of people out there, so it wasn’t exactly a simple proposition to find that one person. He’d just felt that she should know before they went further. Honestly, a part of him had hoped she might find it reassuring, that he wasn’t going to one day find his soulmate and leave her. He hadn’t expected…well, he hadn’t expected to flash to red balloons. He’d gotten angry, and that hadn’t helped. She had been sorry, that much was clear, he just hadn’t been able to tell what she was sorry about, her reaction or the reason why. And that, really, had been the beginning of the end, Happy aside.
“Well, this would be the perfect place, then,” Steve tried, clearing his throat into the awkward silence.
“I will.  Of course, I will.  You worry too much.  It’s fine.  Really.  Clint likes what he does, right?” Steve grumbled.  “You don’t give him a hard time about it.”
In the years after that night, the sky above the mountains flashed with lights and echoed with deep, booming thunder. People said it was just storms, but they crossed themselves when they said it.  Steve liked to watch it from his vantage point in the tiny loft where the window at the foot of his narrow bed opened up to the distant peaks. The noises and lights never frightened him, for some reason, though his mother always prodded him to say his prayers and go to bed, which he did, because he didn’t want her to worry, but the bangs and clamors filled his head as he drifted off and he thought, strangely, of flying, like a bird, but at night, so close to the stars, he felt he could reach out and touch them.
The clock on the mantle chimed dully to tell him that it was just after one, though he knew that already. Tony would probably be in his garage until dinner. He wasn’t coming out to have lunch with Steve and tell him how much he liked soaps and socks, that was for sure. Didn’t matter.  Steve was good at waiting.  There was lots of waiting in the Army, more than most people would think, to be honest, and he was good at it. People thought it was the serum, probably, but it was really more due to years of being stuck in a bed with nothing to do but think.
He didn’t belong to Anthony yet, but he wanted to, oh, God, did he want to.  It was Anthony who had leapt off the picture and into real life, but Steve could almost feel himself solidifying, like if he looked down at his hands, he would be able to see them lose a translucency he knew wasn’t really there.  He could see it happening in his head, though, the dull numbness fading and the feeling of being present in a way he hadn’t been before sending prickles of warmth over his skin. Like waking from a dream, he thought, though he didn’t dream like this.  He thought it would be nice, though, to dream like this.
Most of the discussion wasn’t exactly flattering, Steve quickly realized.  Pain lumbered through his chest, coiling in his gut.  Why did it hurt so much to hear what they were saying?  Why should he care?  People probably said stuff like this about Tony all the time.
“Well, there’s some risotto and chicken in there that was pretty good,” Tony told him as his eyes adjusted to the bright light in the kitchen.  “Guess I’ll just…head to bed, then.”
It wasn’t.  Of course, it wasn’t.  But, the deal the world offered said that Steve would take care of him, protect him, and in return, he would be the kind of person who needed taking care of, who accepted protection and the loss of autonomy that went with that pact.  When it breaks, when it breaks like this, so completely and obviously, someone needed to be blamed, because if not, if it wasn’t any one person’s fault, then the whole thing was wrong.  The whole world was wrong.  What do you do if you know the foundations of the pillars of the world are rotted and crumbling?
Pleasure exploded deep inside Steve.  He twisted beneath Tony, seeking more of that wonderful friction.  “Tony!” Steve shouted, hips bucking as Tony swiped his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock.  It was bliss.  Ecstasy.  He didn’t care what Tony was.  No, that wasn’t true. He wanted this.  Maybe it was the dreams driving him to this, maybe it was the Claim, as Tony insisted, Steve didn’t know, he just knew that he wanted this. Wanted
Hell, if you took out the ice nap, Steve was a lot young—ah, he was youngish, young-esque? Well, really, who was older entirely depended on your mathematical assumptions, so probably best to just leave that.  Point is, maybe that was what Steve had wanted all along, and yes, yes, he fucking knew how ironic it was that he was worrying that Captain America was just using him for sex.
“Yeah, but…” Tony trailed off, looking over at Steve, who shrugged and looked amused by it all.  “Okay, so, what’s our play here?”
“Oh!” Tony gasped in surprise as he felt the full sort of pressure against the tip of his cock suddenly ease and a warm rush of liquid engulf him as his knot retracted. Steve let out a short cry, his body stiffening briefly as the knot released and Tony eased out of him. There was a thin, clear trail of slick between the end of his cock and Steve’s hole, the last evidence of what had tethered them together for so long. Tony sighed and collapsed back onto his heels as Steve rolled to his side, body trembling every few seconds with the after-effects.
Tony smiled, almost mischievously, and leaned over Steve’s chest, dipping his head to take one of Steve’s metal-covered nipples in his mouth.  Steve’s whole body jerked.  His hands came up to scabber at Tony’s head, though he couldn’t seem to decide if he was pulling Tony away or holding him close.  He felt Tony’s tongue, warm and wet, flick against the delicate nub where it was caught between the teeth of the two half-moons.  A low chuckle sent a puff of warm air across it that cooled when it met the wet skin.
But then, New York happened, and they’d fought together, nearly died together, and it had been Steve’s smiling face he’d woken up to, bright as the sun and just as blinding to look at. They’d parted ways as, well, not friends, exactly, but not strangers. A quick handshake goodbye, and Steve had been gone, but that hollow, empty feeling had disappeared as well, swept away with brick and mortar and dust and all the other things that didn’t really matter in the end.
“Gym,” Steve replied, striding past Coulson without looking at him again.  He could feel his muscles tensing and bunching as adrenaline coursed through him.  It was a good feeling.  It was a feeling.  Something.  Hitting things, that he could do.  He could do it with his eyes closed (dark).  Fists pounding, body moving before he even thought about it, and so he wouldn’t need to think about it.  Wouldn’t need to think about anything.  He could just feel.  The way his knuckles scraped on the punching bag.  The way his shoulder lowered. The impact down his arm.  The way his feet fluttered over the mat.  How his stomach would go rigid right as his fist arced up towards the bag.  He would feel, for a little while, and then…then he wouldn’t need to later in the bright light of day.  He wouldn’t need to feel then, and it would be okay for one more day.
Lord Hammer stood up with a sudden flourish and side-stepped his way on odd, mincing little steps over to where Steve knelt.  He grasped Steve’s chin and lifted it up, holding it there.
.  I don’t even have you a ring.  I don’t put my bowls in the dishwasher.  I can’t cook for shit.  I’m--”
“You like the shiny thing, eh?  Well, just hang on there, and I’ll—oh, don’t start—really?” Tony winced, throwing his hands in the air in exasperation as Steve started a shuddering, hitching crying jog that left him red-faced and coughing.  “Okay, fine,” Tony relented with a sigh.  “But, I gotta make you some food.  Food.  You want to eat, right?  Clint said food, and Clint, God help us, is our resident baby expert, so we’re going with what Clint says for now, and no, I can’t believe I said that, either.”  Tony bent down and scooped Steve up, which didn’t quite make the crying stop, but it abated to something more like sniffling breaths that were just waiting for Tony to try that trick of putting him down again.
Passing by the security desk, they headed for the elevator to the suite.  As soon as the doors slid shut, Steve dropped his hand from Tony’s waist and stepped away, like someone hit the ‘off’ button.  Tony flattened his mouth and pocketed his sunglasses, glancing over at where Steve stood, a few feet and a world apart.
“I can swim,” Steve told him, blinking slowly and feeling like he must look like the proverbial deer in headlights.  “You want to swim.”
Behind him, the shower was running, had been running for God knew how long, making the air in the room heavy with moisture, but it still tasted like smoke.  Everything did.  Each breath was coated with an acrid layer of dirt and ash and the melting plastic scent of drywall mixed with carpet fibers into a sludge of cinders.
Steve closed his eyes.  Let the pain of it lift him higher.  He heard Tony curse, and suddenly felt empty as Tony’s fingers left him.  Steve smiled. Breathed.  Went higher.  He turned his head the other way and pinpricks of painful relief burst through one nipple while the other burned hot and taut with the pull of it.  A rustle of clothes, and soon, Steve felt the thick, blunt head of Tony’s cock at his entrance.  It was warm and slick from the oil, but still too big.  It would hurt.  It would feel good. It didn’t matter. He went higher.
“I see you struggle, you know,” Tony continued.  “Against all of this. Against what is and what must be.  I keep thinking you’ll stop, but you won’t, and we both know it.  You think you want to, sometimes, I know you do, but you don’t, not really.  It’s in your blood. It’s where you live, in that moment right before the first blow lands, that’s you.  You’ll never leave it. You can’t. The fight’s here,” Tony added, tapping a finger against the side of Steve’s head, “Between how things are and how you believe that the world could be.”
“I-I would never use that against you, Tony, you must know that,” Steve protested, swallowing thickly.  His heart thudded against his chest, raging in his ears.  He didn’t want to hear this.  It had been the one hope he did not dare speak.  And now, it, too, slipped through his fingers. Politics, intrigue, the grasping tenuousness of it all…it would hardly surprise Natasha that these things would be the fights he finally couldn’t win.
Steve drew back at that small reverberation of air and breathed out a long, ragged breath. This was when Steve would tell him to stop, that he didn’t want this, that he had
“I see that,” the man cut him off before he had to figure out the rest of what he was going to say, his voice surprisingly gentle.
“Give me an enemy to fight, not a hole in the ground to crawl into of my own accord,” Josiah said with a slight shudder.
“I seem to recall telling Natasha that I wasn’t ready to date anyone just yet,” Steve said around a grimace.  “In other news, I should probably change my calendar password to something other than ‘password.’”
“Sorry, Sourpatch,” Tony replied, leaning back against the sofa, hearing a squishing noise, and promptly sitting forward again.
“That it is, that it is,” Tony agreed softly. “Sleep now, my treasure,” he said, though he kept hold of Steve’s hand and pulled it over his chest.
He leaned forward and pressed his forehead against the top of Steve’s chest.  It wasn’t intentional, so much as instinctual, a long-forgotten habit that he apparently never quite managed to break.  Steve stiffened underneath him, but didn’t move away.  Granted, he also didn’t move forward, but, baby steps, Tony supposed as he drew back and looked up to find Steve watching him, brows drawn together and face tight.
“What if she isn’t happy about it?”  Tony clarified.  “What if she hates the way he looks?  What if she finds him repulsive?”
“Wait—what?” Steve spluttered, coming to an instant halt.  “That—that’s real?  The one in the kitchen.  That’s a real Cezanne, and you have it in your kitchen.  Where we cook.  With food and grease and that toaster that does God only knows what—honestly, I think it has more buttons than the jet and who really needs a toaster to do more than toast? And it burns anything I put in there, though even Thor manages it just fine, and I do exactly what he does, so I don’t under---anyway, that’s—that’s a real Cezanne?”
“You did not fail me,” Steve replied.  “You did not, Tony.  This was not your doing.  You cannot blame yourself for what you did not know.”
“Is that so?” Tony asked.  He leaned forward in his seat, hand slipping from Steve’s neck. Steve could see the tightness in his face. A muscle ticked in his cheek where he held himself steady.
“That I shouldn’t be doing this.  That it’s crazy.  That I need therapy.  Go see the trauma guy Rhodey knows or something.  That this is guilt or anger or I don’t know, okay!?!” Tony heard himself shout.  Somewhere, a bird objected to the disturbance, cawing at them from its perch.  “That it’s fine for a project, in the workshop back in Malibu, but that needs to be the end of it.  That I have no business even thinking that I could…do something.  Something like…whatever this…
Celestial navigation, Tony thought, heart pounding.  Find the right one, and you will find your way home.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath.  The alien’s finger continued to trace the rim of Tony’s hole.   He thought his brain had short-circuited. All of Tony’s thoughts seemed to fall off some kind of precipice, like they were swept off a table in a jumble onto the floor.  In their wake, a tide of feeling erupted deep within him. A moan was torn from his throat. Oh. Oh, wow. Tony let out a long, hissing breath and caught the alien’s bright blue eyes watching him carefully.
Tony let out a low, harsh bark of laughter.  “Is that so? Of course. Why not?” he asked seemingly not expecting an answer. He pushed himself out of bed and returned a moment later with Steve’s collar in his hand.  He clasped it around Steve’s neck. Steve didn’t protest. He could feel Tony’s fingers shake as they slid the lock into place. In a way, the familiar weight was comforting somehow.  “
“Of course,” Tony said agreeably.  The weary annoyance was gone from his voice, at least.  “Tell me one of your stories, so that I may sleep,” Tony urged after a long beat of silence.
He wondered if that was awkward for Obie.  Negotiating over Tony.  He hoped it was.  He hoped it was weird and uncomfortable and all the things he’d felt sitting in his mother’s parlor listening to infomercials while she calmly explained that Obie had offered to take him through his first Heat.  A shiver of distaste curled up his spine and settled in his stomach as he remembered the shocked horror he’d felt at hearing that had even been on the table.  Sure, his Heat had been a blindingly unpleasant experience without an Alpha, but, God, Obie?  He’d known the man his whole life.  And he was at least three times Tony’s age.  And he was…he was Obie.  The idea of…well, of doing
“Wait!” Steve shouted, taking the steps two at a time. “Hello! Wait, please! Who are you? Who--” he stopped at the top of the staircase, finding himself staring down a darkened hallway lined with empty sconces, their torches long gone.  At the end of the hallway, a heavy wooden door stood slightly ajar, a warm glow emanating from inside.
“Is this okay,” Steve asked as he broke off, panting.  Tony’s eyes were wide and dark as he looked up at him, his pulse jumping against Steve’s hand where it had settled on the curve of Tony’s neck.
“I like you a mess,” Steve said.  He grinned again.  “You’re always beautiful. But, you’re more…you when you’re a mess.”
“Just had to say it, didn’t you?” Steve muttered, shaking his head, hands on his hips in a posture so familiar that Tony could see it in his sleep.
For a moment, Steve didn’t want to answer. It seemed like an insurmountable task, a thought, then words.  But, Tony had asked.
“My team,” Steve corrected.  “Look, can we just forget it?  What does it matter?  Everyone in boots was looking for you.  It was the biggest search and rescue operation I’ve ever seen,” Steve pointed out, tossing a hand in the air, then bringing it to his hip.  “We didn’t find you.  Like you said.  It’s no big deal.”
“I'm going to have to ask you to leave now, Mr. Stark,” Murdock said, almost gently. “I need to talk to my client. You understand.”
“Nah, Buck and his team are really the best around at what they do.  They call themselves the ‘Howling Commandos,’ believe it or not.  With a straight face.  The higher-ups won’t let Johnson get rid of him, much as he’d like to.  Not many people actually can do the kind of precision industrial welding Buck and his team do,” Steve replied, frowning a bit, because as funny as it had been at the time, it had still ended up with Steve being the one assigned the clean-up task, simply because Johnson knew he and Bucky were friends and he couldn’t get at Bucky directly, so Steve was the next best thing.  Bucky had at least apologized and bought Steve a beer after work.
was his home now.  He still couldn’t believe Steve was okay with him having it.  That probably wasn’t going to last, he realized, but he’d take what he could get while he could get it.
“Will do,” Tony agreed, stepping inside Steve’s apartment as his neighbor shuffled back towards his own apartment with a quick, salute-like wave over his shoulder.
Steve nodded his agreement and followed Tony back inside to Tony’s bedroom, watching with no small amount of interest when Tony pulled the pair of trunks out of one of the drawers of the massive bureau that lined one of the walls.  He tried and failed not to be absurdly pleased that there was a place in Tony’s room where he kept things for Steve.  Well, one thing, but still.  Bucky would probably knock him upside the head if he went back to the apartment and told him that he had a drawer at Tony’s, which he didn’t, not really, of course.
Steve gurgled and yawned, chest shuddering, body going taut with the effort, his whole face scrunching up as the yawn worked through him.  Tony breathed out the edge of a laugh and sank down on the sofa, suddenly exhausted.  Absently, he tapped a hand against the center of his chest where the reactor used to be, fingertips beating a rhythm across the skin. Steve was slow-blinking at him, mouth puckering into a moue as he looked up at Tony and tried to get his arms free of the towel swaddling.
“Not bad-strange.  Just…I’m not sure what to think, and my head is full of, I don’t know.  Thoughts,” Steve said quietly, turning back to the workstation.
For a moment, Tony tried to imagine Steve getting an email notification of Tony’s order, maybe in the middle of a briefing with Fury or while loading up for the long plane ride back to California from wherever in the world he was.   Would he click on the link to see the item Tony ordered?  What would he think about it? What would he think about Tony
After that, Tony just started taking small projects with him whenever Steve decided it was time to go “fishing,” and then picking out something like Piranha 3D from his list of Movies With More Fish Than Us to watch after dinner.  It’s all just a relaxing American pastime until someone loses a foot, after all.  Steve rolled his eyes, but managed Jaws, Lake Placid, A Fish Called Wanda, Finding Nemo and The Incredible Mr. Limpet before finally throwing in the proverbial towel at Sharknado, then suggesting they play cards instead. Tony was still rather disappointed in himself that he hadn’t seen Go Fish coming.
“I’m not a monster,” Steve said, and Stark shot him a smile filled with pleased surprise that made Steve’s stomach swoop to his feet.
“We’re meeting him with dinner,” Natasha said, holding up a plastic bag filled with white take-out containers and way too many fortune cookies and soy sauces.
A postcard with a shot of Coney Island’s coaster was under the handkerchief, next to a matchbook from the cheap motel they’d stayed in during their brief drive to Vermont for the romantic civil union in front of a justice of the peace. He tugged out what sat under that and held it up by the edges, careful not to crush it. Steve’s half of their photobooth strip, one with Tony’s wide-eyed stare caught by the flash and one with his head buried into Steve’s chest, smiling from underneath Steve’s chin, stared back at him, faded and slightly yellow with time, but still almost bursting from the white-bordered sides with happiness, like only part of what they were could be captured.
.  “Here. I just drank.  Feed on me.  Sire’s blood, I promise, you’ll--oh, okay,” he broke off with a slight chuckle as Steve ducked his head and nuzzled at Tony’s neck.
“Why are you even doing this?” Tony asked, his voice hitching a bit, catching Steve’s eye briefly before turning to stare down at the bed.
The LIGO project is real and the scientists working on it are doing truly incredible, ground-breaking things.  Cal-Tech is heavily involved, as are other institutions.
He walked out, wrapped his hands around the edge of the balcony and looked out at the castle surround again.  Watched the guards dutifully stand at attention as a patrol walked by.  There would be three patrols, he knew.  The other would follow along in another half hour.  A long enough break for two people to slip out, unnoticed in the throngs of merchants and servants going in and out of the castle.  Stolen robes, simple ones, not like the lush, embroidered silks that filled the closet here.  Scarves to hide the collars.  Something to cover his head.  His blonde hair stood out too much here.  It could be remembered.
What it really felt like when he thought about it in his head, what the whole stupid fantasy was about when you got down to it, was the idea that he mattered to someone--really mattered.  That he belonged to someone, not in a proprietary way, but in a way that said, there’s a ‘we’ here, and you’re not allowed to mess with that because it isn’t worth it.  No amount of money is worth messing with what we have.
How was it then that Tony felt so humbled, so powerless as he stood here, holding everything that mattered in his hands? How was he supposed to do this without screwing things up and making Steve think of options, which totally did not exist, so let’s just stop even thinking that word, right now.  He should have JARVIS scrub it from any online dictionaries or libraries or e-books and replace it with Voldemort.  That would be ironic. Okay, sure, only for him, but still.
“I’ll manage to struggle through somehow,” Bucky replied, raising his eyebrows.  “You two…”  He trailed off, leaving the question hanging for Steve to make whatever he wanted out of it.
“I’m serious about buying a piece or two,” Stark was saying, shooting Steve a speculative look.  “That wasn’t just blowing smoke because you look like someone chiseled you out of marble.”
He looked at his reflection in the mirror and smoothed down his tuxedo.  Behind him, he caught a flash of movement and turned, then sucked in a frustrated groan and looked skyward for a moment.
“God, you’re beautiful, Steve.  Look at you.  Just look at you,” Tony whispered, ramming deep with a wet squelching sound.  Steve twisted his head around to look at Tony, wanting to thank him, wanting to beg him, wanting to order him to keep doing this, he didn’t know.  All of it. Everything.  He wanted everything.  He wasn’t sure what Tony saw there, but Steve felt him tremble, his thrusts losing some of their power.  Hips snapping hard against Steve, Tony gave a few more quick, shallow thrusts, then drew himself almost fully out and then plunged all the way in until he was fully seated, slamming against that place deep inside Steve one last time.  Steve came again, not as hard this time, but enough to make his back arch off the bed and his neck curve into a display of corded muscles as his throat worked around a silent scream of pleasure.  Tony pumped his hips a few more times, jerky, haphazard movements as he spilled his seed inside Steve, then collapsed on Steve’s chest, sucking in a sharp, shaky breath of air.
“My war.  It was never my war.  War doesn’t belong to soldiers.  It belongs to kings and despots and those who want to take what they cannot earn.  War will never be over, not as long as there are men who crave power,” Steve ground out, then stopped himself and sucked in a breath.  “Sorry, I—“
“Howard, look who I found,” she called out as she walked into the billiards room with Steve and Tony following on her heels.
Tony was staring at him, mouth somewhat agape, before his eyes narrowed and expression went shrewd.  “Yes.  Yes, exactly that.  You said it better than I could, I think. Not many people manage to surprise me,” Tony remarked, still looking at Steve a bit oddly, and Steve recognized the expression as the same one that would sit on Tony’s face while he puzzled over whatever it was on the schematics of his.  “So, you’re an artist.  I should have known.  You stare at the artwork sometimes,” Tony explained when Steve opened his mouth to ask.  “I thought you were just like me and couldn’t figure out what in the holy hell it was supposed to be.”
It was as if there was always some kind of current running underneath everything, a sense of expectation, like standing on the high dive and looking down at the flat water beneath.  It hadn’t seemed like this...whatever it was...would ever be something that either would acknowledge, even if Steve felt it, too, showing up in how closely Steve seemed to watch everything Tony did.  Wouldn't want to miss a chance to find fault, after all.  Still, it wasn't like that generalized frustation couldn't be handled in other ways, Tony always figured, and if he dredged up a few old, almost forgotten fantasies late at night, spending himself into his hand with thoughts of strong, wide hands gripping his hips hard enough to leave marks, well, there were worse ways to deal with whatever tension might still lurk there.
“You went through my stuff?” Steve asked quietly, his hands gripping the seams of the red backpack that was laying, partially open, on top of the desk.
Tony privately thought giving orders made Steve feel better when he worried, like that time when Tony was almost involved in that crazy stuff down on that freeway in D.C. with that crazy terrorist dude shooting at cars and taking out a city bus.  That had been cool.  Okay, not—destruction of property was not cool, but Actual Fucking Captain America showed up, and
“Tony,” Steve said, voice rough and almost hoarse, like the words hurt to say.  “You don’t need to do this.”
“Oh, I’m the stubborn one?  You stalked me onto a bus.  You’re following me across campus.  And for what?  To prove a point?  To be right?  What do you want, Tony?” Steve demanded, pulling himself up short, which let Tony catch his breath.
They had a funeral.  Just him, his mom, and Bucky came, a paltry showing considering there wasn’t much else to do in town and funerals tended to draw a crowd, if for no other reason than you were noticed if you didn’t attend, and there was usually food afterwards.  That unspoken rule didn’t seem to apply to Joseph Rogers, though a few people did bring baskets laden with foodstuffs by over the weeks after the funeral.
It was all right there, so clear and bright, Steve thought if he closed his eyes, he would be able to see the whole of it.  Bucky, in his uniform.  Not because he had to wear it, no, he hadn’t been on duty or anything, but he’d wanted to.  He’d known the effect it would have, how he could cock his cap just so, flash a smile and have the ladies go weak in the knees.  It was seventy-five years ago and a couple of years ago, still fresh in Steve’s mind the way some memories could bubble to the surface as if they had been sitting there waiting for just the right moment.
“I know that,” Steve said.  He rolled his lips together, then looked down at the rug.  “Maybe we could watch them together sometime,” Steve suggested, leaning over and whispering it in Tony’s ear.
“Officially, of course, I cannot take military advice—or any other counsel, for that matter--from a concubine.  But, unofficially…” Tony trailed off, raising his brow.  “I’m to tour the outer defenses with the city marshals on the morrow. Inspect the walls, let the troops present, that kind of thing.  A show, to be sure, but a necessary one.  And important.  Something I do twice a year, so that I can praise their foresight and then fix everything they missed,” Tony grumbled, rolling his eyes and favoring Steve with a slight smile.  He tilted his head to the side and rubbed at his temples, squelching his face in a frustrated sigh before looking back down at Steve.  “Accompany me.  You, and the boy to see to you, if you wish.  You will have to keep a distance and stay silent, which, I realize as I say it, is perhaps like asking the rain not to fall, but, nevertheless, I would have you with me to see for yourself so that you might give me your thoughts later.”
Okay. Okay, so that answered that question. It wasn't really a surprise, was it? Seemed clear when he thought about it. Rushed bonding, Steve bugging out as soon as possible, suppressants and the decided lack of a knot in his ass were all pretty obvious signs. It was good, though, really. Exactly what he wanted. Awesome. Great. His Alpha didn't want him. No problem. Perfect. He wasn't interested in that, either, so. Right. Match made in Heaven and all that.
“This never would’ve happened if it weren’t for me.  Or if I’d have just gotten my shit together instead of being—being this.  I’m sorry, Steve. God, I’m so fucking sorry,” Bucky said, glancing over at Steve.
“Race car tie? Or, maybe step it up and go all out with a cartoon character,” Steve suggested.  Tony could hear the smile in his voice, and found himself returning it, though Steve couldn’t see.
Young, Tony noted.  Younger than Tony had dared to hope.  Maybe seven or eight years older than Tony, which put him on the very young side for a Captain, that was for sure.  Up and comer, Tony guessed, by the look of the hardware on the guy’s chest. That was a hell of a lot of metal, Tony noticed, momentarily distracted.  A lot-a lot.  Like, drag-you-to-the-bottom-of-the-ocean-a lot. No wonder Howard was salivating over the guy.  Decades of connections, indeed.  Guy was clearly going places.
“Trying to push you away?” Tony finished in a quiet voice.  “As someone who is--let’s go with tangentially familiar—with being a big enough ass to drive people away before you inevitably screw up their lives, I give his performance a solid 7.5.”  Steve let out a shaky laugh, and glanced down at Tony, face going soft.
That got him wondering, too. What would it be like to tease Steve like that, joke with him, make him laugh, the real kind that made Tony’s insides go liquid.  What would it feel like to be the one who could do that for Steve?
And Bucky had smiled, wide and devil-may-care and a little sad, maybe, and tipped his cap a little as they strolled to a group of older women with their hair in kerchiefs and their baskets of rations tucked under their arms, setting them to twittering like schoolgirls, the way Bucky could, so effortlessly.  Steve remembered loving him so much in that moment, so deeply, all pure and certain and fueled by a lifetime of huddling by the big wireless in Bucky’s parents’ living room listening to Empire Builder, playing pirates down at Baisley pond, shared strips of candy buttons, a pile of sofa cushions that became a fort to stave off the Indian attack, too many bloody knuckles and busted lips to count, the last gasp of childhood clinging to the them that night before they both went off and became men too soon.
Underneath him, Tony suddenly felt the table shift. The not-gel moved around and reformed again, elevating his lower body and lifting his legs into the air before wrapping around them again in warm, soft sleeves.  It felt a bit like one of those massage chairs, Tony thought, but softer, and all around him. Distantly, he thought that something about this should worry him, but the thought wafted away like smoke and was gone. This was right.  This was good. The gift is life. He closed his eyes and sighed deeply. The not-gel prickled warmly against his skin, like a million tiny brushes, except that wasn’t the right way to describe it, either. He couldn’t really think of a way, but it felt good. Wonderful, in fact.  Everything felt good.
“Ha. Nice try, Rogers. Well, you want to know something? Your premise is flawed,” Tony told him. He shoved his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels, raising a challenging eyebrow. “You think I care about TVs and towels and dishes that match? You think that's what I need? Someone with a few letters after their name, I can trade triple-score kinds of words with? Someone I can sit around and have bank account-measuring contests with, talk about how well our crocodile skin umbrella handles the rain between the curb and Louis Vuitton or how coffee made from civet droppings leaves no aftertaste? That what you think?”
The door jerked open, and a man stood there, hair unkempt and a scruff of beard over a grey t-shirt that said Army on the front and was slightly too big for him.  Oh, and he was missing an arm. So, there was that.
was Steve’s last semi-coherent thought as his back bowed and he saw white spots dancing in front of his eyes.
“Am I alright?” Tony said for him. He stopped and looked down the blank canvas of land before him where the sea rolled grey and white between the steeples of the cliffs.  In the distance, Steve could see the seabirds darting up and down on the breeze, searching for fish, the same as ever, though he suspected they missed the ease of dining on the catch brought in by the fishermen.  “I am…no.  No, but I don’t think I should be.  Do you?  I don’t think anyone should be.   I won’t—I won’t allow this to be my legacy, but I owe it to you, to Barnes, to the people who died here, to at least bear witness to it.  It should be hard.  It—I need it to be hard, so that when it’s done, I can do something with it.”
You can’t miss what you never had, he’d spent years assuring himself. It was the uncertainty, the damn, fucking unknown, that drove you crazy. He’d built it up in his head because it was the one thing he couldn’t have. It was the not knowing that was worse. Wasn’t that what everyone said? Better to know you had cancer than wonder if you did. At least he knew. He had that. He fucking
“I thought I’d lost you,” Tony sighed, sucking in a quivering breath.  “If something happened to you, because of me, because of what I did, God, Steve--”
Steve thought he should be horrified, but the look on Tony’s face pushed whatever else Steve might have felt away.  Tony’s finger slid deeper, slick and wet.  My blood, Steve thought, head tipping back as he arched into the feeling, invasive and filling at the same time, like his body couldn’t quite decide. His cock twitched, hardening as Tony pumped his finger in and out of Steve’s body.  Tony pulled his finger out to rub it through the funnel of blood dripping down Steve’s thigh, and Steve keened, high and needy, breath coming in pants at the sudden emptiness, then the breath was punched out of him as Tony pushed two blood-soaked fingers into Steve’s hole, stretching him wide.  In and out, Tony thrust, over and over, spreading his fingers and loosening Steve’s hole until he could add a third.
“Forget it. I shouldn’t have brought it up,” Tony broke off, letting out a frustrated huff.  “It’s none of my business. Try the manicotti, it’s fantastic.”
“Okay. Okay, okay, you believe me, okay,” Tony stammered, caught off-guard. “So, we're okay now, then, right? We're okay.”
He watched Tony hurriedly reach up and dip his hand in the pot of oil Steve only now noticed on the table, then undo the ties of his breeches and take himself in hand.  A part of Steve wanted to help, wanted to touch Tony like that or offer more.  Tony could use him. He wouldn’t mind. He thought it might even be good, in the strange way that things like that were good with Tony.  In his head, he could see Tony pushing him down on the rug, bending him over and spreading the bruised cheeks of his ass and taking him, there on the rug where he could feel the burn of it in his ass and on his knees.  Tony didn’t, though, just gave his cock a few quick, perfunctory strokes.  Steve thought he should maybe help, but Tony had told him to keep his hands at his sides, so he did. He liked watching. He liked watching, and knowing it was about him, even if he wasn’t doing anything.  There was something thrilling in that power, Steve thought, as Tony gasped, gave a small cry, and came into his own hand, letting it spill over onto the rug between them.
Steve woke slowly, with the vestiges of a dream still clinging to his mind.   The first thing he was aware of was that he was cold. The second thing related to the first, he quickly surmised.  He was tucked, still quite naked, in a burrow of sand that had been scraped out of the beach on the other side of the remains of the fire he built the night before.  His body was stiff and sore. Sand coated his back, the backs of his legs, and seemingly random spots over his body. He itched at it, absently swiping some of it away, not that it made much difference.  His tongue felt grimey, and he could taste sand and salt on it, and then he remembered
“And admit defeat?  At the hands of this...late-night TV, drunken impulse-buy gone horribly wrong?  I think not,” Tony announced with a flourish.  “Okay, does anyone smell burning plastic?”
sooner.  Pansy asses didn’t want to admit to the brass back home that they were up shit creek without a paddle, that’s what it was.”
“Deal was for a blow job.  You want something else, you need to bring some chicks a few more cosmos down at Applebee's or whatever, ‘cause I’m not getting fucked on a—a—God, is that a futon with a Ninja Turtles comforter? Seriously, that’s…depressing. And not a little disturbing, though, I’m oddly turned on.  Who knew?  To be fair, those reptiles are stacked.  Halfshell, nothing.  Anyway, like I said in the email, a hundred bucks gets you an over-the-condom blowie or a nice handjob without the raincoat, so what’s it going to be?” Kirk asked, clapping his hands together in front of him before spreading them wide in a sweeping gesture, awaiting Steve’s reply.
“Well, it makes a whole lot more sense my way if you put the ‘in bed’ on the end of it.  Speaking of thongs, the whole, ah…Rhodey-arranged dance of perfect timing?” Tony asked, waving his champagne flute in the space between he and Steve. “You said something about agreeing to it because you wanted to see me as just a customer, not—not
The world went hazy and soft at the edges. He could still hear noises in the room.  The steady beeping of the machines.  Friday’s mechanical voice. Bruce’s deeper tone.  But, they were distant, muted, as if he was on the bottom of a pool looking up.  Steve blinked once, slowly, then everything went dark.
“Yeah, I know. I'm trying. This isn't exactly how I planned to spend my week, you know?” Tony pointed out.
be nice to be working toward a goal that really meant something.  Not that working at the bar or the warehouse was bad, just... not really the stuff of dreams.
