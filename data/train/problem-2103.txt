“Oh, I don’t think you’ll want to miss this one, Sherlock. It’s right down your street—a new serial killer. And if the evidence is anything to go by, there are at least a dozen victims.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You kept repeating that: Fournier, Fournier, Fournier. Who’s Fournier?”
“Yeah, okay,” he said, and this time the smile reached his eyes. He sobered. “Can we really do this, Sherlock, do you think? Can we really...find our way out of this together?”
John scoffed. “'Release’? What’s that supposed to mean, exactly?”
Sherlock frowned. “Are you sure that’s wise?”
And just like that, Sherlock was hard again. He sighed and sat back in his chair, staring down at the obstinate member now tenting his trousers. What the
Anderson set his jaw and simply nodded.
John stilled and stepped back but kept a hand on Sherlock’s waist as he looked up into his face. “It is, isn't it? You’ve always been there for me. Always, from the very start. Even when you died, even when I married someone else, even when I wanted nothing to do with you. Even when I didn't deserve it—and let's face facts, that was most of the time—you were always there for me.”
I cried for Molly, for all the ways I had hurt her, and been forced to hurt her, though she deserved it least of anyone.
Ever since that night, John and I talk. When we can't sleep, when the thought of one more moment of staring at a dark bedroom ceiling becomes insupportable and we are driven to
, Mycroft?” Sherlock growled, not looking up as he returned to pounding away at John’s laptop.
“Yeah,” said John through chattering teeth.
” He scrambled to the bathroom and managed to raise the toilet seat before falling to his knees, clutching the porcelain as his body began ejecting everything he had eaten in recent memory. He vomited violently again and again, barely able to draw breath before each new paroxysm overtook him. At last it eased up and he fumbled for the toilet handle, flushing away the mess. Everything hurt. Tears had been forced from his eyes and were coursing down his cheeks, and he wiped them away as he shuddered and gasped for breath, head pounding.
“Ta,” said John again, taking a tentative sip. When there was no immediate intestinal revolt, he took another. “Good thinking. That feels good.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned back. “Oi!” John protested, wrenching his arm from Sherlock’s grasp. “Would you
John grabbed his arm and shoved him back just as he reached for the door handle. “Oh, no, you don’t. This one’s mine. Get your own.”
Sherlock stepped back out of her reach, sliding a hand into his pocket to withdraw the mobile in question. “Yes, you have, haven’t you?” he bit out. “And you installed that obnoxious text alert noise while you were at it. I want it gone. I want
THE PIN IS INCORRECT. TRY AGAIN.
was the matter with him? Yes, he had been attracted to John from the very first, but until recently he had managed to deal with that without sporting a permanent boner. Of course, until recently he’d never seen John’s penis, either flaccid or erect, nor had he ever witnessed him ejaculating all over his own torso. But ever since he had—
” and Sherlock was across the room and up the stairs before the echo died. He burst into John’s room to find his flatmate still thrashing about in bed, gasping for breath, eyes open but unseeing. “Sherlock!” he cried again. Not just a nightmare, then. John wasn’t awake. There was silence for a moment, and then John's next words stole the breath from Sherlock's lungs. "I'm a doctor. Let me come through. Let me come through, please," he said brokenly. He moved, restless, struggling against unseen hands.
, John, for God’s sake! Did you swallow a thesaurus when I wasn’t looking?” he snarled, waving his arms. “I’m talking about climaxing. Coming, ejaculating, jizzing, blowing a load!”
Sherlock didn’t seem able to settle during the cab ride to NSY. He took out his phone but put it away again after mere seconds of scrolling, and he kept shifting restlessly in his seat. After the third such squirm, John decided to get to the bottom of it. “Are you okay?” he asked, frowning.
Lestrade came over, face grim. “We can’t leave him in there without backup, with no way to communicate. He knows how to fight, but he’s unarmed and alone in there with a paedophile.”
, and I didn’t. I didn’t, because ten seconds earlier I remembered that we needed milk and biscuits and turned back the way I’d just come. I
“Simply this, John: I need you at your best for the Work. I can’t have you distracted by...”
“Sherlock?” John asked, gripping the detective's upper arms and giving him a small shake as the one-minute mark ticked by. “Sherlock, you have to breathe now. Remember to breathe!”
Sherlock’s gaze flickered up to his, then back down again, settling on nothing somewhere in the vicinity of John’s shins.
Again an infinitesimal nod from Sherlock.
I tightened my grip on his hand. “I know because I have them, too,” I admitted quietly. “Every night. Every time I try to sleep. It’s...quite exhausting.”
“Would you stop—”
This should be the last of the short chapters. After this they'll be a bit longer. At least I think they will. I've changed some of the tags because this story has taken a turn I didn't anticipate. Anyhoo, more to come...
development, and Sherlock cursed inwardly. Bloody woman.
John’s next suggestion was both unequivocal and anatomically impossible and was followed in short order by the near-simultaneous slamming of the living room and bedroom doors, hard enough to rattle the newel post under Mrs. Hudson’s hand. “Oh, dear,” she said, bringing a hand to her cheek. Heaven knew her boys tried each other’s patience on a regular basis, but they’d never had a blow-up like this.
“John?” came Mrs. Hudson’s voice from the stairwell. “Is everything all right up there?”
Except he was, sort of. Mind-palace John was always with him, and always a comfort, despite being only a reasonable facsimile of the real thing. Sherlock closed his eyes, expecting to find the steadiness of his mind palace, but instead there were cracks snaking along the building’s walls and windowpanes as its foundation rumbled and shook. Clearly the mind palace was mirroring the seismic shift in Sherlock’s understanding of the world. Sherlock staggered to the door of John’s wing and pulled it open. Beyond was a howling maelstrom. “Sherlock?” came John’s voice from inside. “What’s happening?” he shouted.
, Sherlock, because we needed sodding
Sherlock decided right then that John Watson’s giggle was the second-best sound on earth.
John quirked a grateful smile, then nodded. “Thanks, that’s good to know.” He cleared his throat. “So, er...serial killer?”
“So I see, apart from your obvious frustration with Dr. Watson’s—” Mycroft paused, smirking as he glanced pointedly at the laptop “—apparent coding genius. Just out of curiosity, have you tried S-H-E-R?” he asked sweetly.
“Great,” John said, smiling. The fondness was still there. “Try not to wake Mrs. H. I’ll see you later.” He stepped away.
First off, I'd like to apologize for the ridiculous delay in posting this. This is meant to be a funny fic, but what with COVID and the entire world turning into a Dumpster fire and reality sucking large hairy testicles, I didn't feel like laughing for a really long time. So my progress on this story stalled.
Sherlock bent forward and put that exquisite mouth to John’s ear. His voice was velvet and steel and oh, God, pure
“No need for embarrassment, John,” Sherlock purred. “The need for sexual release is perfectly natural, as I’m sure you know. As is a response to the sight of another person’s arousal. It’s normal to want to engage in...certain acts...” One long arm curled around John’s waist. “...to want to touch...” A hand snaked itself in under John’s shirt, caressing, exploring, locating the nub of one nipple and rolling it between two elegant fingers. “...or even to want to taste...” And Sherlock did, his breath hot and wet against John’s neck as he nibbled on John’s earlobe and licked a stripe along his jawline. John turned in his arms. Sherlock was still naked, and God, was he magnificent.
He looks down and to the side. "Mary," he says, though it takes him a fraction of a second too long to answer. I doubt he is aware that his fists are clenching at his sides. He's not being honest, not entirely, but I let it go. I have learned to let him speak in his own time. Instead, I smile at him and he smiles back, though his tension eases not a whit.
“And didn’t notice this item here in the background?” Sherlock pointed to a deep reddish blur. It seemed to be an elongated, convex wedge shape, broader at the top than the bottom, painted with paler wavy vertical lines.
“Hang on,” Greg objected. “There’s no way of knowing what’s down there!”
John sat up, then got to his knees. “Yeah, I’m awake. Come here.” He reached out, grasping Sherlock’s right wrist and pulling it toward him, one hand coming up to clasp the detective’s while the other sought out the pulse point at the base of Sherlock’s thumb. He gave a sigh of relief. "Just checking." He stared up at his flatmate a moment longer before pulling him into a fierce embrace. “You fell,” he said, his voice breaking. “I saw you fall.” Somehow Sherlock knew he meant tonight, not all those years ago at Barts. Sherlock bent low, bringing his hands up around John’s back, burying his face in John’s hair.
It took several hours for Sherlock to make it back to 221B. As predicted, finding another mode of transportation from that godforsaken hamlet had proved challenging. He entered the flat to find John sitting in his armchair with his fingers steepled under his nose, staring straight ahead. “I said, pass me my phone.”
“My flatmate,” John offered feebly, rubbing a hand over his forehead. He knew how this would end.
“Over the years, brother, I have learned to brace myself for any eventuality when entering your flat.” He waved a hand vaguely to indicate the space around them. “Decomposing body parts, malodorous experiments, even the occasional drug-fuelled assault—”
Ten minutes later, Mycroft sent the CCTV footage through to his laptop. He cued it up and watched it all the way through to the end, then reloaded it and watched it through a second time. Someone who didn’t know him well would have thought him entirely unmoved—posture ramrod straight, fingers steepled beneath his nose, gaze impassive. Only a keen observer would have seen how the elegant hands shook, how his breath hitched as he closed the laptop and sat for a time with a hand over his mouth, contemplating what might have happened this day. At length he put the computer aside and went back to bed, twining himself about his lover and marvelling at being able to do this now. There was so much ahead of them, so much to learn about being together like this, about who they were together, and he didn’t want to waste a single moment of it.
“Sherlock, do you…”
It isn’t until the last of the stubble has been removed and John applies the aftershave he knows Sherlock favours, that Sherlock breaks. With John’s face so close, he reaches out, clasping John’s cheeks in his hands. He freezes.
‘Yeah, I’m fine, for God’s sake, just…’
Neither man questioned if John was sure. They didn’t have to; John’s tone made it very clear that he would take matters into his own hands if they didn’t give him what he wanted. John was stubborn like that and they both knew it.
‘Yes.’
'Happy birthday, Sherlock.'
John’s hands traced the muscles of James’ chest and stomach, while staying clear of the scars, causing him to shiver.
“Do you - ”
‘Oh God…John, please,’
They fell together easily after that. Sherlock read James’ reactions to John’s movements like a book and quickly copied them, caressing him, stroking him while he and John kissed. John showed James how and where to touch Sherlock. They moaned and gasped in each other’s mouth and when James rolled on his back, Sherlock helped John to settle on his lap, before he settled back on his knees next to them.
‘John, stay awake, listen to me! What do I do? John…’
His shirt. His back. Stupid! Idiotic! He should have thought this through. John can’t see… it never was his intention for John to know. He can’t –
And he smiled. ‘Morning…’
‘Shut up, you two. Go to sleep. Talk tomorrow.’ John moved his hand from James’ waist to pat Sherlock’s hip spooned against him.
‘Jesus, can you two bloody wait until you get home?’
‘Cheers for that one. But Sherlock… you… well, you don’t do that. You hate company.’
‘We’re stuck.’
John Watson’s appearance in his life was like a breath of fresh air after staying underwater too long. A sudden burst of light after crawling around with your head down. And with John came the undying loyalty Sherlock never thought he’d deserve.
James was gripping Sherlock’s leg hard now, but Sherlock didn’t care. He placed his free hand on top of it and as if on instinct, their fingers tangled together.
‘Yes, you did.’
‘Was he like this before?’
Sherlock feels John freeze against him at the statement.
Before he can articulate an intelligent question about what John is doing, he feels himself being lifted from his chair and supported by the strong frame of John Watson. ‘Come on, mate, you need to lay down.’
He is dozing in his armchair, the reassuring sounds of Sherlock in the kitchen working on another ghastly experiment, lulling him deeper into his slumber. When he feels cold slender fingers on his wrist, he thinks he’s dreaming, like he did those two hateful years Sherlock was away and he was alone drowning his sorrows and regrets.
But the need to see this side of John, the side that gave himself up willingly for James, was near overwhelming and the image his imagination conjured up, made him ache with want.
‘’Sherlock…’’
James moved. It only took his two steps before he reached John and he placed his good hand on the other side of John’s head. John tilted his head up the same moment James lowered his and their lips met.
So he waits. He sits and he waits, holding John’s hand as he counts the beats of his heart. Sherlock watching John twitch and groan as he wakes and hushes him when panic flashes through his eyes when he opens them.
Sherlock grunts in response, and without opening his eyes, pushes down John on his back before curling up against him. Their legs are tangled together now and Sherlock has his arm wrapped around John’s torso, keeping him close while his head is resting against John’s shoulder.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, letting his fingers follow the line of John’s spine. ‘I love you, John Watson, and you love me. Please. Believe me when I tell you I know that. I know what I am saying and I know what I am allowing. Invite him over, talk to him…’
‘Data, John!’
James licked his lips and suddenly it dawned on Sherlock; he wasn’t just here for John. They talked about him as a part of this and James had agreed.
James licked his lips at the sight of John’s erection. As he moved forward with his lips parted, Sherlock hands slid up, making sure he hit every single of John’s most sensitive body parts along the way. His sides. His nipples. His collarbone.
Greg’s voice caught in his throat before cursing again and he could hear him shouting orders to someone near him. ‘I don’t care, just do it! Find him, pull everything. Ask his bloody network. John?’
‘’If it’s about the shaving, I – ‘’
‘James…’
That next birthday was forgotten - again - by both John and Sherlock. John was too busy with the preparations for his wedding and Sherlock was too busy trying to ignore the way his stomach clenched at the mere thought of John standing in front of an altar. Without him.
‘John?’ Sherlock reached out to him with a heavy arm when John had removed the big heavy coat and moved to pull off Sherlock’s shoes. John placed a hair on his curls and petted him affectionately.
No, not this can’t be happening! This is wrong, this can’t happen. He can’t lose John, not now, dear God please, not now! John can’t say goodbye. He won’t let him.
Sherlock moves his hands, placing them over John’s heart and presses down.
‘No, don’t you dare,’ Sherlock gritted out and finally –
Sherlock swallows. ‘’Serbia. Before… before I came back.’’
So he revels in the dreamlike touch, tilts his hand slightly so his wrist is more accessible. But then the fingers retract and John sinks in a deep slumber. He barely remembers it when he wakes up to Sherlock’s cursing and the sound of breaking glass.
‘John?’
‘For God’s sake John…’
Sherlock crashes their lips together and whatever John was about to say next, gets lost between their lips. Whenever their lips part for breath, Sherlock manages to breathe out the words that keep swirling through his head.
‘Oh no, you don’t,’ James’ voice suddenly interrupted him and Sherlock froze. His hand had been moving to his own erection to relieve some of the pressure. ‘Come here, Sherlock. John…’
‘Sholto. James. You’ve been emailing for a while and you’ve been entertaining the idea of meeting up. You should invite him over. For dinner.’
Sherlock and John ask, confess and negotiate.
Sherlock didn’t know how long they stayed like that. They probably should call someone, alert the doctor that this time John was fully awake instead of his drifting in and out of consciousness of the last few days. But he didn’t want this to end. Not yet.
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.
Later, when they both had regained their ability to breathe and Sherlock has cleaned the cum of John’s chest and belly, they wrapped themselves up around each other. It was then when Sherlock suggested it.
‘You sure?’
John moved, settling himself on his elbows to look up at Sherlock’s face. ‘You want to invite him over for dinner?’
‘Relax John. Deep breaths. He’ll love it. And trust me, he’ll say yes. He loves you more than anything.’
John’s hands fisted the sheets and something dangerously close to a whimper escaped him. Sherlock let his free hand trace the shiver down John’s back and he tried to imagine seeing James’ cock slide inside of John. They never did that much. It felt easier – no, it felt more natural to have John lead. To surrender to him. To have John take care of him, like he always did.
‘If you want. If he wants. Whatever you need.’ Sherlock had to press down the heat spreading to his cock at the thought of John and James together like that. Not now, this was not for him, Sherlock though firmly to himself. This was for John.
‘I love you too.’
‘I’m here,’ John murmurs.
Unacceptable!
‘John, stay awake, listen to me! What do I do? John…’ Sherlock was rambling, but he didn’t care. Not while John’s eyes were fluttering closed and his cheeks lost their colour and the blood is still pouring out of him and
‘Breathe, S’lock…’
He had a case – at least an eight, a delicious locked room mystery, one that wasn’t yet contaminated by the Yard’s incompetence – but his mind failed to make the connections that otherwise would be blatantly obvious. When he realised he had needed three glances over the crime scene photograph to notice the blood splatters on the western wall and another five minutes to understand what they meant, he knew something was horribly wrong. The all-consuming pounding headache made his first appearance ten seconds after that realization.
and shake her, demanding to know what the hell was wrong with her. She shot Sherlock! His wife, his pregnant wife, shot his best friend and was now carrying a gun with too much ease and no hesitation to use it again.
The first time it happens, John doesn’t even recognise it for what it is.
He must have made a noise because suddenly both men turned their attention to him. James beckoned him over with a nod and a smile and John reached out his hand. ‘Come here, love. Please.’
– and he could  hear Mary’s trembling voice in the background but Sherlock was still talking to him. ‘…please, John, they’ll be here. Hold on, please, I’m begging you, don’t die…’
James eyes flickered up to John’s scar for a moment and Sherlock could see something dark cross his face. Not now, Sherlock thought to himself, making sure John wouldn’t notice by sucking the skin behind his ear. This wasn’t the time.
Sherlock hears the frown and he sighs. He can’t back down now not without causing even more questions. John will know he has more to hide, he’ll get angry, he’ll leave and –
John wanted to tell him to be careful but his words were slurring and he still couldn’t breathe and it felt like he was drowning –
‘You were involved once, weren’t you? In the army?’
James and Sherlock untangled their hands and Sherlock carefully removed his fingers. James reached out for the condoms, handing one of the wrappers to John, who made quick work of it. He settled his hands on John’s hip, ready to guide him.
‘Call Mycroft!’ he snapped at her. Sherlock could see her face become a sickening pale shade. The gun has fallen from her hands and her eyes were still fixed on John’s face. Not his chest. Not at the damage she has done, but his face! ‘Do it, Mary.’
‘Oh God…’ John muttered, a hint of amusement in his tone. ‘You can ask. You know that right?’
‘Not funny,’ he muttered weakly and John smiled. Sherlock felt the need to rush over, to kiss that audacious smile off his face, to replace the horrible memories of having John’s lips not responding against his own with something better. But he was still stuck in his wheelchair – his nurse had been completely unforgiving and unrelenting no matter how hard Sherlock tried to blackmail her – so he settled on placing his hand over John’s.
It was silent for a moment in the other room and Sherlock had frozen.
The feeling of John’s arms wrapping around him surprises him. John pressed himself close, his head buried against Sherlock’s shoulder, his hands once against on Sherlock’s back. ‘’I tackled you… and you let me.’’
‘Go to sleep John.’ Sherlock pressed a kiss against John’s shoulder and John hummed something unrecognisable in response. But he did.
John was leaning into the touch but he made no move to return the gesture. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to – Sherlock could see it; John did want to – but he was waiting. But why?
‘Hmm?’ John responded lazily.
’32 seconds.’
Sherlock nodded and John moved his head to claim his lips in a bruising kiss. ‘I love you,’ he whispered whenever they part to catch their breaths and Sherlock could feel the words reverberate in the movements of John’s hands on his skin. ‘I love you so fucking much, Sherlock… Christ, I don’t deserve you.’
Sherlock could hear Mary’s gasps behind him and Sherlock would have killed her if he could. But John is dying, he is dying because of her and damn it all to Hell if he would let her get away with this.
‘Sort of,’ John admitted, still not looking at Sherlock. ‘It was… Christ, it was war. Sometimes you just got lonely, or the adrenaline got too much and it… with James it was easy. I guess. We liked each other from the start. He had a great sense of humour and was good for his men. It was… good, for a while.’
James’ face softened a little and John turned around, moving away from his hand. But they weren’t out of reach from each other for even a second. They moved in sync, closer, ever closer and Sherlock straightened himself in his chair. Had they been like this back then? God, the mere thought of it made him ache.
‘Please John, I’m sorry.’ Sherlock could hear his own voice breaking, eyes fixed on John’s chest. But Mary is calling, he can hear her talking, help is on the way. Mycroft will be here soon. ‘Please, John, they’ll be here. Hold on, please, I’m begging you, don’t die…’
‘I’ve dealt with worse.’
‘It is my fault!’ Sherlock suddenly shouted and John recoiled. The detective eyes were wild and red-rimmed and his cheeks were tracked with tears, but John doubted if Sherlock even realised he was crying as he continued shouting. ‘I didn’t see in time. I ignored him because I wanted to annoy him. To get back to him for putting back the bloody camera’s.’ Sherlock was climbing of the bed now and started pacing wildly across the room, his hand gestures changing between flinging wildly in the air to pulling his hair. John stepped back, giving him the room he needed, while clenching his hands because he wanted to hold him still. ‘I was too late,’ Sherlock continued frantic, ‘and he trusted me to help him and I was too focussed on Lestrade’s case and now he’s dead! My brother is dead because I didn’t see. Mycroft…’
What else could Sherlock do but to do as John asked him? Especially when he talked to him like that. James chuckled breathlessly at John’s impatience but he said nothing of it. The laughter fell from his lips when another finger breached John and John responded by rubbing his erection against James’.
Sherlock didn’t respond and John stayed still for a moment. The need to get closer to the man on his bed was itching in his bones. He needed to see for himself what Sherlock had done, he had to try and help. But before he could ask, Sherlock moved again. Slowly, like his body weighed a ton, he scooted over to the other side of the bed and turned on the bedside lamp.
‘Oh God…no, please…John!’
'You still haven't given up that blog?' Good morning, John.
John wanted to tell him that he was awake, only his lips wouldn’t move and his breath stilled in his throat.
“Shave…”
Together.
(See the end of the chapter for
His hand pulled and Sherlock followed willingly, struggling to stand up from his chair, until their foreheads are resting against each other.
He took a tentative step forwards and his foot hit something on the ground. The sound of glass rolling around on the floor made Sherlock turn his head towards him. John did not want to think too closely as to what was on the floor and how it stood in relation to Sherlock’s sluggish movements.
‘I called it off, got shot two days later and I didn’t see him again. I tried to contact him when I was back in London and again when I heard about what had happened to him but, he never responded. I sent him another email when you had left and we met up once after that but it wasn’t… He wasn’t the same.’
‘Touch yourself, Sherlock,’ James removed his hand. Sherlock nearly buckled with the sudden lack of friction, but when he felt James’s fingers against his still lube coated hand, he did what he was told. Soon, cold slicked fingers were reaching behind him, probing his hole and Sherlock moved his hand over himself.
‘Asleep. As long as he isn’t working, he’ll sleep like the dead.’
When John had noticed the card his mother had send him in 2011, he seemed properly ashamed of himself for never asking Sherlock’s birthday. ‘Next year,’ he promised after Sherlock ensured it was quite alright. ‘Next year.’
John was practically shivering underneath their ministration, silently begging them both for more. He wouldn’t beg out loud. Yet. But he came damned close when James’ mouth engulfed his cock.
Love hurt.
Not this though. Not with John being so still and pale and not with his blood still warm on Sherlock’s hands as he kept pressing down. Not with the tears blurring his sight and the ambulance too far away from them.
Sherlock pressed down, hard, and suddenly he felt John shift underneath him. ‘Stay still, John, please…you can’t die. I won’t let you, you hear it? I won’t let you!’
‘Yeah, yeah, just go.’
Sherlock tried to step back a little, but John’s hand immediately reached back and grabbed Sherlock’s hips, grinding them together again and James had stopped.
John doesn’t say anything, but Sherlock can feel his hand moving to the buttons of his shirt, hovering, waiting for permission. He doesn’t know why John is not asking him, he can’t read him like this and Sherlock fights down the urge to reach out and touch his face, just to be able to feel what he’s thinking. This is infuriating!
A dry sob escaped him when he felt John’s cold fingers encircle his wrist. He struggled to get the words out and Sherlock could barely hear him but he doesn’t have to. Those eyes, those beautiful grey eyes are telling him all he needs to know and Sherlock hates it. He doesn’t want to know like this, not with one of them bleeding and dying.
Sherlock shuffled closer to James, still on his knees, and when James firmly grabbed his cock, he gasped in surprise. John was moving on his own now, his muscles flexing and trembling with the strain. James was moving in hand in time with John’s movements and – oh God! Sherlock could already feel his orgasm building in the base of his spine.
‘You, John.’ Their lips meet again.
This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t be happening! This was a dream, a horrible nightmare. John felt sick. He wanted to scream, to grab Mary –
‘Yeah. It was.’
‘Bit not good, Sherlock.’
“Do you need a hand shaving?”
When Sherlock’s legs started trembling from exertion, he slid back into the wheelchair but they kept their hands entwined. In the silence that followed, Sherlock counted the heartbeats the monitor displayed and kept carefully track of the number of breaths coming from John. Meanwhile, he pretended not to notice that John’s fingers had moved to his pulse and didn’t stop searching until Sherlock could feel his pulse beating against them.
John’s ears were still ringing from the cold tone of Mary’s voice when she raised the gun. He didn’t hear the gun firing. He did hear Sherlock’s voice –
He could see her now, in his mind’s eye, back straight, gun in her hand. Was she aiming? Or was she waiting for him to make the next move?
‘Sherlock?’ James’ deep gravelly voice interrupted Sherlock’s train of though and his gaze snapped to him. Oh. Him. They were waiting for him… But…
‘’Your shirt, Sherlock.’’
Oh no. This is wrong. John can’t know.
Sherlock had experienced these headaches before. Before John, before the cases, when he came down from the cocaine, he had them more often than not. But they were made up by the wonderful, beautiful, exquisite clarity that preceded them. Then he’d gotten clean – Lestrade refused to invite him back on cases if he didn’t – he met John and the pains were beautifully absent.
'The woman never gives up,' Sherlock muttered. He moved in to grab the envelope - read it before tossing it away like he always did - but something in John's gaze stopped him.
They’d spoken about this, Sherlock realised as he took in both men. James looked calm, in control. The commander. And James was curious and more than a bit aroused.
He dreams. And maybe it’s the grey sky hanging over their heads all day or maybe the fact that today they had a crime scene involving a jealous ex, a tall building and a body smashed to the ground – the first had made it want to seem like a suicide – but John is dreaming about that dreadful day when his world came crashing down along with Sherlock’s body.
John is silent for a moment before he moves. He tries to get enough momentum to properly barge his shoulder against the door, but no matter how hard John tries, the door simply won’t budge. Plus, John’s movement presses Sherlock uncomfortable against the wall.
‘Intriguing.’ John didn’t buy it. Of course he didn’t; he knew Sherlock better than that. To suggest a dinner date… Sherlock had to admit he might have handled this differently. ‘What on Earth do you mean by that?’
John pulled James back up onto his feet, his hands rushing to get the clothes off of his body. Apparently John didn’t like being the only one naked.
Sherlock did.
‘What is it?’
Sherlock shrugged and John’s frown deepened. ‘Sherlock…’
John placed his hands on either side of James’ head, rolling his hips.
Sherlock wants to tell him that he’s fine, that John should go home and leave him be, but the only sound that comes from his mouth is a miserable groan. For a moment he is angry with his body for betraying him and he wants to push John away from him. Nobody, except Mycroft, ever saw him in this way and he certainly doesn’t want John to see him like this, but then John swears under his breath and makes his way to him. John kneels down next to his chair and suddenly he feels the doctor’s hands cradling his face. ‘Look at me Sherlock, would you?’
Sherlock’s heart skipped a bit. Love. An endearment so easily given, often with a smile so warm it made Sherlock want to kiss it. And now, he could.
‘Anything?’ Greg’s voice sounded tired on the other end. John could feel his stomach clenching. Nothing on their end then.
Oh God, how he hated her!
John looked at him with suspicion in his eyes. ‘What are you… oh.’ John moved, straddling Sherlock’s hips and he placed his hands firmly on either side of his head. He stared him down. ‘Sherlock, I love you. Whatever was between me and him… it is history, okay? Done. Over and finished. There is no reason for you to be jealous.’
‘No.’
He remembers John’s surprise when Sherlock first curled up against him after their first time. Sherlock himself had even been more surprised to find he had managed to sleep through the night. Apparently John’s calming influence extended even to the bedroom.
Sherlock hears the sharp intake of breath before he feels John’s fingers tracing the worst of the scars. Another inhale. Another. Not a word. Nothing. He dares not to ask anything when he feels a towel being wrapped around his neck. Even though he can’t see, Sherlock looks down, just so John doesn’t have to look at him when he moves back in front of him. Not a word is spoken as John presses the blade against Sherlock’s cheek.
‘Your heartbeat in rest, it’s slightly lower than the average male,’ Sherlock announces and John finds himself nodding. ‘Was it always like that?’
John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, hiding himself from view again. Sherlock could feel the tightness in his shoulders and his trembling breath. God, how long had he been hiding this? From the world? From himself? How heavy had the weight of his guilt become in the months he and John had been together.
Still nothing. Although… Sherlock can hear it now, the ragged quality of John’s breath, deep, controlled. Sherlock finds himself trying to match it before nodding.
Still…
He had managed to make his way to his chair, curled in on himself, eyes shut, breaths coming from between clenched teeth, desperately trying to find a calm place in his mind where he could just sit and wait this misery out.
‘How badly do you want to find out?’
‘Love you.’ Sherlock moves to straddle John’s hips. John tightens his hold on Sherlock’s hips.
James let out a shaky breath before smiling. He hadn’t removed his hand from Sherlock’s hip and he didn’t when Sherlock opened the lube bottle to coat his fingers.
‘You’re in hospital, John.’ Sherlock whispers, holding John’s hand as tightly as John is grasping him. ‘You’ll be fine. Remember, you got stabbed… You’ll be fine, John.’
‘Shh, love. I know. I know.’
‘Yeah and a lot of good that’ll do us since we’re stuck in the goddamn closet!’
Oh. That was not - Sherlock blinks, his vision still dark, but he can see John’s face so clearly. He can imagine the tentative smile, the warmth and uncertainty in those blue eyes. For even a moment, Sherlock can picture John’s hands and fingers perfectly. To have them, against his skin…
Sherlock stirred behind John but James didn’t pull away from him. Perhaps he hadn’t noticed. Perhaps he didn’t care. But John could feel Sherlock turning to his side, pressing himself up against John’s back. Sherlock’s long fingers caressed their joint hands for a moment before he opened his mouth. ‘You’ve started without me.’
The feeling of James’ hand sliding over his own, made Sherlock look down over John’s shoulder again. James had diverted his attention away from them, focussing on the movements of Sherlock’s fingers on the belt. They opened it together and with a little help from Sherlock, James pulled down John’s trousers and pants. And oh, how Sherlock knew that look well.
‘Shut up, Sherlock.’
John is silent for a moment after that before he giggles.
is coursing through his veins. Sherlock touches him everywhere at once and it’s nowhere near enough. The detective’s expression is surprisingly fragile and insecure and John grasps his hands without reservation. He offers his wrist. Sherlock looks at him with wide open and beautiful eyes and John smiles. Very carefully, he feels Sherlock fingers slide over his wrist and when the rapid beats of John’s heart interact with his fingertips, Sherlock’s face breaks into a smile.
‘Mycroft has her,’ Sherlock started after a deep breath, ‘she…'
‘I’m so sorry…please John. I just wanted it to be quiet.’
They had gotten back in touch after John’s divorce. After John had spent a couple of nights there when he hadn’t been sure he was still welcome at Baker Street. Sholto had called him and Sherlock drove up to the isolated cottage to come pick John – angry and grieving over the lies he had fallen to and utterly drunk – up and bring him back home.
Why is John’s face wet? What –
So it made no sense, no sense whatsoever, that he would be suffering from this again. He was home, John was safe – not at Baker Street anymore, but he was safe – and all was right again. Sherlock dug the palm of his hands in his eye sockets to relieve the pressure behind them, but it was to no avail. Already the nausea was threatening to catch up with him and he groaned. This was unacceptable!
‘More. Sherlock, give me another one.’
‘He might have done.’
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.
And for them to… oh!
Well, in that case.
There had been a time where he had run down the stairs on the mornings of the 6th of January to find his mother already at work in the kitchen and his father bright-eyed and with a wide smile as he pretended not to remember his youngest’s birthday. Mycroft would always be down later, ruffling Sherlock’s hair as his brother’s interest was completely absorbed by whatever gift his parents had gotten him - he knew Mycroft would have left his own gift on Sherlock’s pillow.
John grabbed him, slamming their mouths together. Sherlock let go of James, scrambling to get a hold of John’s shoulders to keep them both upright, but John was moving, sinking down, and John’s sharp hiss interrupted their kiss along with James’ deep groan of pleasure.
Thank you all so much for reading, following, leaving kudos and commenting.
John wanted to scream and cry at hearing Sherlock’s normally arrogant baritone sounding so broken and lost. He longed to smash every single thing he could get his hands on. Instead, he took a deep breath to collect himself. ‘I’m here, Sherlock.’
He can hear John’s soft chuckle as he sinks down on to the bed next to him and Sherlock flinches when the flannel makes contact with his sticky stomach. Sherlock tries to move away – for someone who keeps pestering him to sleep more, John seems determined to keep him awake even longer – but John cleans him despite his wiggling.
Sherlock's POV
‘So am I,’ Sherlock confirms before taking his mouth into a bruising kiss again.
‘No, don’t you dare,’ Sherlock gritted out and finally – finally – he looked up to meet John’s eyes.
Sherlock’s broken plea was too much for John to bear and he pulled him closer to his chest. ‘I know Sherlock. I’ll help, I promise. Go to sleep, please. I’ll be here.’ John pressed a kiss against the dark curls and within minutes he felt Sherlock giving in to his body’s need to rest. ‘I’ll be here Sherlock,’ John murmured and now he could feel the tears that had threatened to break free all night slide down his cheeks. ‘Promise.’
Instead, he moved his hands until they found the buttons of John’s shirt. And he undid them. One by one.
‘Have sex with him?’
John stayed still for a moment, phone still clutched in his hand. He couldn’t believe how fast things had gotten out of hand. What started as a visit from Greg in the morning – only this morning! No more than ten hours ago dammit – had turned in one of the worst days John could recall to memory. They had realised too late how bad things could get, hadn’t realised it was all a distraction, hadn’t realised who the real target was. They had fitted the clues together too late. They had been distracted, still riding their high from Sherlock’s miraculous solving of the ‘Alley Murders’ – Jesus, they were joking about the name for the blog entry when the call came. Too bloody late!
‘’Tell me when!’’
‘’Hey, calm down. Breathe, Sherlock.’’
he is too slow. Again.
Yeah. In hindsight, Sherlock should have expected the argument that followed.
‘John!’
‘Sherlock!’ John exclaimed, freezing at the sight of the taller man near the door, standing completely still. ‘How long have…’
Amazing. Stunning.
‘’John…’’
John frowns. ‘For as long as I can remember yes, but why…’
‘Stop thinking, love,’ John murmured and James chuckled deeply. Sherlock scowled in response but he settled against John’s back anyway. James moved his hand to rustle through Sherlock’s curls a bit and Sherlock closed his eyes when a shiver wrecked through him.
tilting her head as she regarded him. That look…
Dinner. And more...
It were not her words that forced him into action –
And it is only now, when John drifts back asleep again, still clutching his hand, that Sherlock believes it. They’ll be okay.
‘I meant, John, that we are stuck. Stuck as in, I am unable to open the door. Ergo, we are stuck inside the closet.’
It wasn’t fair. He could see the understanding dawn in John’s eyes and he was crying and Sherlock wanted to scream. This wasn’t fair! ‘You’re not saying goodbye.’
The golden band that once adorned John’s finger was on there, along with his watch. But Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the wedding ring. He had cursed that thing before, when he had to witness Mary slide it on John’s finger – he had been spared the horror of looking for the rings – and he cursed it now. It seemed so small and insignificant but the mere sight of it caused Sherlock’s brain to settle on the woman who nearly killed them both.
‘Sherlock?’ James asked and John nodded behind him.
James pulled back a little, regarding Sherlock with heavy lidded eyes and Sherlock stretched his neck for more without properly realising it.
John’s sudden command startled Sherlock, but before he could ask, John explained. ‘She doesn’t… She is not a part of this. Not anymore. Please, Sherlock. Just… just the two of us, okay?’
With all the strength he had left, he lifted his own hand to clasp Sherlock’s bony wrist. He could feel Sherlock’s pulse fluttering against his fingers –
, Sherlock knows. He knows and he hates her and he would kill her if only his hands were not busy trying to prevent the blood leaving John’s body. Even now, even now she thinks of no one but herself.
He was longer than John, Sherlock noted, though the girth was roughly the same. His hand lingered, teasing the sensitive head through the material of the condom and James hissed in response. ‘Sherlock…’
The two men were cleaning up the dishes, occasionally sipping their wine, their shoulders brushing as they worked. And they were talking.
‘You’re staring, love.’
‘Goddammit!’ John hisses out as he nearly slips and they get pressed closer against each other. For a moment Sherlock images this scenario up on John’s blog.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything. How could he? Because he knows, no matter how selfish he might have been in the past, ever since John limped into his life… there was no pain Sherlock would not endure for John Watson. There was nothing his body, his mind, his soul, his heart, would not endure for John Watson. How could he tell John that every single day without him killed him? How could he tell John that the mere sight of that golden band on his fingers tore his heart apart. There was no line John would be able to cross; Sherlock was already lost and broken for him. Sherlock already loved.
,’ the word whispered into his mind, causing him to suddenly flinch away from the hand that held his wrist. His father’s voice always found a way into his life, causing him to flinch away from whatever magnetized him towards things he shouldn’t like.
“How did you know she was going to be away?” John found himself intrigued by the middle Holmes. Not that he hadn’t been before, but now he had a subtle admiration, aside from the adoration of just what the Holmes signified, but of what he could do. He picked apart John’s life by just his watch.
John suddenly no longer found the trio so scary and almost found them… ordinary. He wouldn’t say that because he knew they still had power over him, even if Mycroft had black rabbit slippers on.
“W-why?” John began to blush at his stutter, wanting to slap himself for sounding so stupid.
“Yeah.”
Got me pretty emotional.
I'm going to be away for a few days. Sorry
“This is John Watson. His parents are in the military. Can he stay with us? I promise to take care of him,” he said, almost making John sound like some lost puppy. But, to the three, he probably was.
A few classes rolled by, John only had 1 with Sherlock, 2 with Eurus (without Jim) and 1 with Mycroft. That was the most he had seen the three in his classes over the last 4 years, and it frightened him how close they were to him at almost all times.
“Sure, sweet. Grab him a plate and let us all eat,” she turned to John, gesturing for him to take a seat, “I’m Lydia. I’m certain you know my children,” she almost laughed as if someone not knowing the kids were some joke. Sherlock returned with a plate for John, taking his own seat before they all began to eat. John knew at that moment, eating a soft yeast roll and sipping tea with the three most powerful kids at his school that his life was over. It no longer belonged to him and he knew he was just a toy to them to do as they wished. ‘This could be beautiful,’ a voice whispered in the back of his mind as he chatted nicely with a Mrs. Lydia Holmes. She proved to be just as terrifying as her children, but John hoped to overlook it as he was just filled with anxiety.
“Oh! Willy! You brought a friend?”
Not much more to go, lovelies.
People are going to die...
“Are you going to change or not?” Sherlock repeated, stripping off his coat jacket, leaving him in a stark white button up that seemed to cling to his chest in a way that drew John’s attention.
Also, I tried to edit it to be sure my English is right but I got a little emotional over my own story, so I couldn't edit as well as I would have liked.
Mycroft and John were startled by that. “W-what?”
Sherlock seemed to be amused by John, a little toy for him to bend and break as he wishes. His popularity was what was keeping John from running and he knew it. He knew John needed Sherlock for his final year not to be complete hell. One word to any person and John’s name would be on every tongue at school, one word and no one would look at him like he was scum. Sherlock had all that power in his pale palms, and John knew that they both knew that John was now a puppet. He had gone too far to turn back now.
Sherlock took John’s wrist, eyeing the watch. “You mother won’t be home till morning. That is why you have a second alarm, one for you to greet her and one for you to wake for school. Doctor, late and weird hours. You reset the watch frequently, but not frequently enough for it to be a timer, Not that you would need a timer when you cook, you use the kitchen timer. But, as I was saying,” Sherlock paused for a moment, “come home with us. You can sleep at our house while your mother is away.”
Once the two had gone, John could almost jump for joy. He wound up punching one of the stalls, the wood banging back into the wall before he realized he needed to calm down. ‘It’s just people,’ he kept telling himself. The last hour of school seemed to go by in a daze, because before John knew it, he was dragged to a black car by Sherlock Holmes. Mycroft was seated in the back, Eurus in the front and Sherlock shoved John between him and Mycroft. The driver didn’t say a word as they left the school, eyes following the car as if they knew something was up inside.
“Military. She had leave over summer, but she leaves this afternoon. Joining my father on the fields again,” John found himself admitting. The slender fingers around his wrist made him feel like jelly, how he barely noticed the cold fingers that were undoubtedly taking his pulse as he practically swooned over the Holmes.
Mrs. Turner was in the middle of saying something about a hall pass when John shoved the door open, holding a page in his hand. “Oh, there you two are. I was looking for you, come on we have more yearbook stuff to do,” pushing a bit of an authoritative tone, sounding much like his war general father, John looked to the two Holmes boys. One looked shocked, the other mildly pleased. Both expressions were covered as Mrs. Turner turned back to them.
We are drawing to an end, guys. I am a bit upset, it seems just yesterday I was up at midnight imaging this story.
James hummed underneath their hands. He stepped forward, pressing himself fully against John’s chest and both of their arms slipped around James’ bare torso. John very nearly sagged between them. Sherlock’s erection was pressing up hard against John’s lower back and James made sure his hip was firmly pressed against John’s groin. John was still clutching Sherlock’s hip, keeping him close and James used the lack of distance and his height to tilt his head over John’s shoulder.
He hears himself screaming his name, tries to run, to stop him, to catch him before he hits the ground, but
A sudden rush of pain shocked his system and he can hear himself screaming. ‘Stay still, John, please…you can’t die. I won’t let you, you hear it? I won’t let you!’
Nobody moved for a second after Sherlock’s outburst. John and Sherlock kept staring at each other. Greg kept looking at them both, unable to supress his grin. This had to be the weirdest marriage proposal he had ever heard of and it was goddamned perfect. Leave it to them to completely mess it up and get it right at the same time.
John propped up on the kitchen chair, showing him how to dress a leg wound. Not serious enough to warrant a trip to the A&E on Friday night, but significant enough for John to need a hand. It was only logical, Sherlock had argued at the time; they were bound to get into more scraps together and for all his knowledge, medical emergency procedures was not something Sherlock had ever bothered learning.
He wasn’t the only one alone during those two years. Sherlock left him because a sniper would make him leave Sherlock if he didn’t. Sherlock fought and hid for two years, while those snipers were still a threat. John hadn’t known. Of course he didn’t. It wasn’t until Sherlock had returned and John had demanded Mycroft for answers when Sherlock wouldn’t give them, that he understood the true motivation.
There was something in John’s gaze whenever Sholto came up in conversation or when his phone chimed, bearing a new message for his old commander and friend. And strangely, Sherlock didn’t feel jealous. How could he? Sholto made John smile, made him think of happier days in a dark past. And due to his role in their relationship, Sherlock could feel nothing but gratitude and admiration for the man. He knew what it was like to give John up to someone else. The pain of it.
Sherlock froze in his tracks, his eyes and mouth open wide as the words halted in his throat. John could see the realization and disbelief dawning in the other man’s eyes. ‘Mycroft…’ His voice broke.
John will –
Sherlock’s hands found John’s belt and it is enough to pull James attention away from the marred skin.
With him, John tended to lead, apart from the rare occasions and Sherlock was more than happy with the dynamic between them. John was more experienced when it came to sex and after Sherlock felt like he had caught up with John, he had no desire to change what they already had. But this, this was different.
John knew Sherlock was just around the corner, out of her sight – ‘
But he couldn’t. He needed to – ‘Sherlo…’
Not with John lying on that damnable bed.
– at the same time the pain in his chest registered.
“There is a seat in front of the sink,” John says when Sherlock enters the bathroom.
John could practically hear the pout in his voice and a shaky chuckle escaped him. James pulled back from John’s lips and he looked over to Sherlock’s face in amusement. ‘You slept in.’
Sherlock leaned back and watched James’ cock disappear inside John. John rocked his hips a little, taking in more of James with each movement and it wasn’t long before James started moving his hips to meet them.
‘Never again, John, please, promise me,’ Sherlock begged. John turned his hand to tangle their fingers together and squeezed. His eyes are red-rimmed now, making the blue in them shine even brighter and it is too much, he nearly lost this forever because he didn’t see, because he failed to keep the one man he loved with all his being, safe. ‘I couldn’t… I would have torn her apart if you’d…’
Sherlock squeezed another large dollop of lubrication into his hand and carefully, so he wouldn’t over stimulate him, began to slick up James’ cock.
‘John!’ Sherlock’s voice suddenly rang loud and clear in his ears and John wanted to do nothing more than to reach out to reassure him. But he can’t move and he can’t breathe and oh dear God, this is it! This was wrong…this was all so wrong…
‘Sally will check with his network if she’s able to find one of them. I’ll go to his old places. Will call you yeah?’
Sherlock’s mouth dried up at the sight of James pressing a soap covered hand to the small of John’s back. John stilled underneath his touch and Sherlock could see the tension leave his body on a trembling exhale. James was looking at Sherlock, questioning, making sure, but Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on John. It was remarkable, seeing John like that.
But he knew now.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open, hands already moving to his shirt to undo the buttons. James merely smiled and raised an eyebrow. ‘You dealing out the orders now, Watson?’
John’s heart was big enough for the both of them and as Sherlock crawled on the bed to clean them, he wondered if his own might be bigger than expected.
“Spit it out, John.”
‘Yes, you did.’
John is already aching and the pressure against Sherlock’s thigh leaves him breathless. But he doesn’t pull away.
John was still typing with a faint smile on his lips when Sherlock came up with the idea.
“I’ll manage, John.” He does, eventually, after nearly crashing to the floor because he sat down too close to the edge. John doesn’t comment on it.
During those years there was no time to think of birthdays. Or Christmases. Or any other day to be honest. Sherlock was often reminded of the days he spent in search of cocaine - the days and months and years all blended together until he found his head being lifted by his brother, announcing to him he could go home.
‘’You were angry, rightly so, and I – ‘’
James had moved. He was standing behind John now, leaning down, tracing his lips along the line of John’s neck. John’s mouth was parted, his eyes closed and he gripped Sherlock’s shirt to keep himself upright.
Sherlock allowed himself to take a deep breath, ignoring the sharp pain in his own chest. He was healing still – his own heart had threatened to give out once he was loaded up in the ambulance and the surgery to repair the damage he had done to himself had been taxing. But he didn’t care. Not now.
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.
John followed his gaze. ‘Came this morning.’
‘Come on John, keep up. You had an orgasm, not a lobotomy.’
‘I don’t care!’ he heard himself shouting. ‘If you love him even half as much as I do, then you’ll call him. NOW!’
Your reactions mean the world to me. Please, let me know what you think of it so far.
John was next to him before Sherlock fell to the floor, buckling under the weight of his grief, and held him. They curled down onto the floor together, holding each other like a life line. John felt the warmth of Sherlock tears seep through his shirt when the younger man pressed his face against his shoulder as he continued babbling. ‘I’m sorry…so sorry, Myc. Please…’
Sherlock moved a little closer to John, gently letting his fingers slide over John’s balls to his perineum. John groaned, but he muffled the noise against James’ shoulder. ‘Don’t John,’ James whispered and Sherlock started to press the tip of his finger against John’s hole. ‘We want to hear you. Don’t we, Sherlock?’
Sherlock’s legs are trembling now and if they had more time, John would have pulled off to smile, to kiss those full red lips and to properly prepare them both for more.
John says nothing for a moment, nodding quietly to himself, before moving his hand to his trouser pocket. The box is simple, black, a square and horribly cliché and yet it makes Sherlock’s heart skip a beat when John opens it to reveal a white gold band.
James gave John a pointed look and it took John a moment. ‘Ah,’ he muttered. ‘Yeah. Well, that is the past. He and I tiptoed around it long enough.’
‘Please, John,’ he gasps. ‘You can’t… not now, please. I haven’t told you – I never did and I should have…’
And more...
After his Fall, they came back with a vengeance, leaving him crippled in a dingy hotel room or hidden in an abandoned part of whatever city he found himself in. His mind palace completely inaccessible – just static, a white nothingness where the halls and chambers used to be and it scares him to death, because what if it never comes back?! – no place to retreat, no drugs to calm the pain. Just agonizing pain.
Something must have shown on his face, because John suddenly takes a deep breath. Steeling himself; Sherlock has seen him do it before. Gently, John takes the cup of tea from Sherlock’s hand and he feels like his heart is going to burst. He doesn’t dare to hope, but he does anyway and he fails to catch John’s muttered ‘please don’t let me be wrong’ over the roaring in his ears and then John’s lips are on his own.
‘Oh shut up.’
Sherlock and James looked at each other over John’s head, both of them smiling fondly. Yes, for John Watson, they would try.
‘’No, shut up, Sherlock,’’ John snaps and Sherlock listens. ‘’You hid this. You were hurt and you hid it from me. For God’s sake, Sherlock, some of these… when?’’
John moves to the bathroom first and Sherlock follows the sound of the running water.
The sight was glorious. Sherlock couldn’t look away if he tried to. To think that it was he who did this to John. He, who had made him unravel. It never got old and Sherlock suspected it never would.
‘The man asked, John.’
‘What’s so funny?’
An email. To Sholto.
‘I will never forgive you for that,’ Sherlock vowed, still not looking away from John’s chest, ‘and I’m sorry. I’m so sorry that I didn’t… I should have known, I always know!’ He wasn’t crying – his tears had run out long before – but his chest felt tight and his throat burned and he couldn’t –
‘No, shut up. I’ve seen it and I don’t mind John. I know you love me and I love you. So does he. And you still care for him too.’
John is crying!
‘Prepare him for me?’
‘’John?’’
Sherlock barely has time to react as John pulls him away from the lowlife that now lies unconscious and bound on the cold ground. He keeps his grip tight on Sherlock’s wrist and somewhere in the back of his mind, John notes that the detective doesn’t fight him. He trusts him. And somehow that makes John even more desperate.
Sherlock kissed John between his shoulder blades before reaching back, grabbing the lube and condoms from his bedside drawer. James’ hand settled on his hip.
John took a deep breath and tried to remember Sherlock’s boltholes. But frankly, he had no idea. No idea how to reach out to his friend, no idea how to find him, help him and convince him to come home. Before…oh Jesus bloody Christ. ‘I…Mycroft has a list of all his hiding places in his office, I don’t…maybe Anthea, his assistant, knows some…’
James said nothing though Sherlock could see the amusement in his eyes. He tried to picture them both, younger than they were now, just as impatient. Hiding themselves away from judging eyes, high on adrenaline and lust. Sherlock could see it clear as day in his mind’s eye, just as he could in the shapes and movements of the two men in front of him.
‘I want you there... if you – Jesus, I can’t believe we’re even discussing this – but I want you there with me. Us. If we – ’
‘Yeah…okay. Let me know if there’s any news from the hospital?’
The pain felt as Mary shot him in the chest was nothing compared to the pain he had felt when John had said ‘I do’ to another. Sherlock severely doubted he would live to see his next birthday at all.
Sherlock closed his eyes and for a moment he thought he could taste James on John’s skin. He gripped John’s hips, rubbing himself against John’s arse. A whimper escaped John’s lips and Sherlock groaned against his skin in response. They were both hard – Sherlock could see the bulge straining against John’s trousers when he opened his eyes and looked down.
Sherlock never cared much for his own birthdays anymore.
John didn’t say anything for a moment. But Sherlock could see that he wasn’t going to argue; he was right and John knew it. ‘Jesus, Sherlock… what are you saying?’
Sherlock’s stomach rolled at the sound of a gun being readied and he wondered how he could have missed this? Sweet, clever Mary. So quick to befriend him, so tolerant of John’s need to go with him, chasing criminals through dark alleyways. Patching them up while they’re both still grinning like madmen, completely high on adrenaline.
John rose from his seat them, moving closer to him. Sherlock could barely stand looking at John from up close. The brightness of his eyes was near blinding and there wasn’t a single line on that face that Sherlock’s didn’t want to touch. He wanted to kiss the angry bruise on John’s temple - courtesy of Mary - taste those slightly chapped lips for himself.
It had been good. No, Sherlock rectified himself immediately when the thought sprung to mind. Not good. Amazing. Wonderful. Never would he have imagined that his life would – and could – turn out like it had. He was happy, nauseatingly so. But Sherlock didn’t care. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so at ease with himself and those around him and he wouldn’t change it. Not for anything.
Yes, Sherlock thinks and he smiles. Yes it is.
Stupid, why didn’t he think of that?
‘What do you mean?’ John asks disbelieving and Sherlock rolls his eyes – it is dark enough to prevent John from seeing.
After Sherlock was cleaned and dressed the wound, they talked the night away. Discussion various scenarios and what to do, joking, bantering. It had almost been fun.
Sherlock was laying on his stomach, his scarred back bare and his face turned away from them but John knew he was still asleep; he’d never be this still when awake. James was pressed up against the other side of John, his arm wrapped around his waist, heavy and warm, pinning him into place. He still snored, John realised. Just a little. Not loud enough to be bothersome, but enough to know that it would turn louder in a minute or so.
‘I don’t care!’ Sherlock suddenly shouted, his face turning to Mary’s general direction and if John were lucid he would have fallen to his knees at the mere sight of Sherlock’s fury on his face. ‘If you love him even half as much as I do, then you’ll call him. NOW!’
‘Fuck! James…’
Danger night.
Sherlock frowned for a moment, eyes darting around the room, as if he’d forgotten where he was and what was being asked. Then, when John bend down to pick the syringe from the ground, he snapped back into focus. ‘Heroine.’ The harshness of his voice pulled John back up and he took a step closer to the bed. Sherlock was shivering, hiding away as far in his coat as he could manage. ‘I just need…just want it to stop, John. Please…’ Sherlock pressed his eyes shut and grimaced. ‘Stupid…stupid…’ John could hear him whispering and he felt his insides grow cold as Sherlock continued his babbling. ‘Disappointing. He used to call me that when we were children. Did you know that John? Such a disappointment. I always tried to prove him wrong. Tried to prove I was as clever as him but he wasn’t wrong, was he John? I was too late, I didn’t see…too late.’ He hid his face from John but not before he had seen the trembling of his lips.
Sherlock steeled himself. This was it. ‘That I can share. If you… if you want. I want you happy, John and I know you’re happy with me but I can’t help but feel like there is something, some part of you that can only be happy with him. And I want to see that part. I want to know all of you.’
John was staring at him, eyes a bit glazed from the painkillers but alert. Awake. Fully, finally, after days of living in limbo, he was awake!
Sherlock tries, but he can’t focus and that’s all John needs for him to spring into action. He jumps up and Sherlock hears the sound of the curtains drawn shut behind him shortly after. The room is engulfed into darkness and Sherlock finds it easier to keep his eyes open this time.
he thought. And it was. The onslaught of information Sherlock received from just watching them was staggering. This was John like he had never seen him before, not once in all those months. This was a younger John, more carefree, more lust driven. And Sherlock sensed the same change in James. It was stunning.
That next year he was so deeply involved in solving a gruesome triple murder that he didn’t even notice he was another year older until January had passed in its entirety. And so he drifted on. Constantly alternating between boredom, craving the high only cocaine could give him - but never giving in - and chasing the high the cases would provide him for as long as possible.
It isn’t the first time Sherlock focussed his enormous brain towards John in a dull moment. John can fondly remember – although he felt less than fond at the time – the time Sherlock was examining John’s blood under the microscope in comparison to his own. In fact, John knows Sherlock has an entire spreadsheet on him. How he likes his tea, what time he gets up on average, when and how long he goes out for a walk, how far he can go before John has too leave the flat to cool down – that had not been a pleasant week.
He presses Sherlock’s back against the wall, hard, out of sight and hidden by the darkness. John can see Sherlock opening his mouth in protest but John claims his mouth as his own. Sherlock groans in his mouth as John lets his fingers trail the waistband of his posh trousers. The lack of a belt is really helping him now.
The fifth time is the time John encourages it. They’re breathing each other in for the very first time, their lips barely ghosting against one another. John feels elated and a sense of finally,
‘John.’
At least he was home.
‘’Sherlock?’’
But, when he feels himself slip to the place in his mind where his palace resides, he isn’t greeted with the white static noise of emptiness. He sees him, strong, reliable, loyal John Watson, with a warm smile on his lips, inside the living room of Baker Street, their chairs close together and the smell of tea and home and
Eleven months now and at times like this Sherlock still couldn’t believe his luck. John loved him. Sherlock nuzzled his face against John’s neck, peering over his shoulder to look at the screen as John resumed his typing.
James met Sherlock’s gaze and Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock’s heart pounded when John moved even closer to him, pressing their chests together. He cradled his face in his hands so he could pull him down. Their lips brushed.
‘Sherlock, listen to me. Nobody could have seen this coming. This isn’t your fa…’
‘I’m here, John. You’re okay. Promise.’
John starts laughing again and Sherlock now really starts to get concerned. ‘Come out, Sherlock. As in, they haven’t come out for their sexual preference. And I don’t mean straight.’
‘Come out of what?’
‘John?’
James smile widened and they titled their heads towards each other so their lips would brush. John felt James’ fingers against his skin tighten for a moment before relaxing again. The kiss was unhurried  and eventually they pulled back to let their foreheads rest against each other.
James had ambushed him several days later, while he was still limping a bit, and told him, commanded him, never to do that again. They hadn’t said the words then but John had felt them reverberate inside of them both that night.
I've been thinking about some one-shot prequels (the conversation between James and Sherlock without John & John and James in Afghanistan to name two). Please, let me know what you thought of it and you'd be interested and reading those.
Another time.
6th January 2006.
They moved; James led them, placing his hand on John’s upper arm, while John quietly told him which door to take to the downstairs bedroom. Sherlock followed them, his hand wrapped around John’s. John squeezed his fingers but whether it was to reassure himself or Sherlock, he couldn’t tell.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Oh, how wrong John was. ‘I’m not jealous,’ he declared and John raised his eyebrow in disbelief. ‘I am not! But you get that look in your eyes when you email him and I…’
Sholto – James, Sherlock corrected himself – seemed more at ease than he had back then. Well, no one had tried to kill him here so there was that to take into consideration. He talked more, and he laughed. Real smiles and John got that soft and loving look in his eyes that Sherlock adored.
And that’s the end of that.
Oh buggering fuck! ‘Right…yeah…goddammit.’ John rubbed his face. Damn this day to hell and back. ‘Look, I’ll head to the den I found him during the Magnussen business. Maybe I’ll get lucky.’ Yeah right.
Sherlock couldn’t hear what they were saying and he refrained from moving closer to overhear. This had been the point of it all. For them to sort things out between them.
The room was dark, undisturbed on first glance, but John could see a shape on his bed. Back against the headboard, legs curled up, head resting on his knees, one arm outstretched besides him. A lump threatened to close up his throat and John could hear his heart pound in his ears, but thank God, he thought to himself. Sherlock was home!
John was the first one the wake up. He felt sore but not unpleasantly so, and warm. Very warm. He blinked a couple of times and a smile crept up on his lips when he remember last night. James. And Sherlock. And him.
Sherlock snarled to himself, trying – pathetically failing – to ignore the pounding in his head.
Sherlock’s breath was nearly knocked right out of him. This was a hunger that rivalled their first kiss. A desperate movement of lips and tongues and teeth. James was leading John and John seemed to fall back into that dynamic with ease. He moved whenever James did, responded in kind when James changed his rhythm. But Sherlock could see the trembling of James’ fingers as the stroked John’s cheek with his thumb. He was nowhere near in control as he would have liked to be.
stop spinning me around like we're in some sodding square dance?”
At that, Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to his, gaze raking over him. “Why are you here, Mycroft? Getting a little cardio to work off the six pounds you’ve put on since I saw you last? I’m afraid one flight of stairs won’t cut it, brother dear. And the three—no, four—biscuits Mrs. Hudson fed you with your tea won’t help either.”
“No, we bloody well
“Entirely,” Sherlock said. He showed Greg his phone. “These are 1:6 scale figures designed to be fully poseable and extremely lifelike. They’re primarily used by artists and animators. In most of the ‘crime scene’ photos, an actual person’s face has been photoshopped onto the figures. Which, by the way,” he said, turning pointedly in Anderson’s direction, “are made in Taiwan. The wounds were photoshopped in from actual murder scene photos, if I’m not mistaken.” He swiped through to a different photo, showing it to Greg and John. “The Nielsen case, among others.”
