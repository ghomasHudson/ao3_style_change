to have Lisa sneak out before anyone can notice. And all this with time to spare for him to get cleaned up in time for his first client.
,” the beta greets, prominent lines around her eyes accentuating with her smile. The deep bronze of her skin glows softly and Dior could swear some of this tension leaves his body just looking at it. “How can I help you, sweetheart?” she asks, face kind and smile compassionate.
It strikes him as odd that the omega does not use a concise age for himself and Castiel is hit with the realisation that he has not actually ever - he's never asked how old Dior is.
“Yes - I apologise if that was presumptuous, but it appeared to be the most sensible option,” Cas states. “He…“
He supposes that is why Princess Margot prefers their company - even as an omega, she still holds the highest rank in the room right now. The prince finds it bittersweet for her. However, he won’t deny he also finds her presence entertaining and much more preferable to the prejudiced dignitaries.
It is technically true - Dior is not mated or courting anyone. And although that should bring relief, it does nothing of the sort. Cas feels like his heart has decided the pit of his stomach is better real estate, despite there not being enough room and constricting everything painfully. Unhappiness coils around him with cold tendrils and he is useless in stopping it.
“Ah. That is a precaution not a lot of nobles go through the trouble for. Their master must have had them use scent neutralising toiletries. It is to prevent any altercations between alphas.” his friend informed him as he stopped right in front of a table full of refreshments.
The funny thing about taking care of a baby, time seems to both flow rapidly and screech to a halt at the same time. It feels both like a lifetime and barely a minute since they’ve moved to Sioux Falls at the end of October. Now, November was almost over and Christmas was a looming worry.
“Please, it is no trouble,” the prince says, arms back to hanging next to his body. “Is your head still troubling you? Do you require anything else?”
“That is a ridiculous notion. I am besotted with yours,” Cas says truthfully, now mapping the star chart of the flecks along his cheeks and nose with the same passion and desperation an astronomer might upon the discovery of a new star.
“I’ll give you a piece of paper with the details for curfew, rules, meal times, and so on,” she continues, opening a drawer, presumably looking for a quill or pencil.
And so, with the weather on their side, the ship departed from Dover and started its way to Calais. It was marvellous to see what a difference a few hours and a small body of water could make. Castiel already felt at ease and it had only been a few hours.
“Not yet,” Castiel replies, rubbing his hands together, already icy despite having taken his gloves off minutes ago. “Are you aware of any dressmaker or tailor in the area that operates with sewing machines?”
Dior can’t help it, he makes an incredulous sound at this piece of news, “Lisa. He has no idea you’re carrying his pup.”
Castiel looked at his friend, eyes growing wide and more scandalised by the second. “Altercations? Over omega dominance? Dear Lord, surely we have evolved enough as a society not to fall prey to those animalistic instincts?” he frowned.
Castiel thinks back to the time in his childhood before he ever presented and became a source of inconvenience for his family - instead of another mark of pride. Mike and Luci would spend most of their time together with their nannies and tutors, Gabriel would be off causing trouble to the kitchen maids, and Castiel… Well, he was attached to his mother’s hip.
Dior remains silent but he takes not his gaze away from Castiel’s. Instead, both of the omega’s hands wrap around his wrist abruptly, tightly enough it might have made him flinch in a different setting. The hand muff falls to his lap with a thud.
“No, no. I believe the wind must be playing tricks on our ears. Shall we head inside the carriage now?” the prince asks, disregarding the conversation with two shakes of his head and pulling Dior with him to the carriage.
Dior does not move his hands from where they are sitting bent at the elbows, expression serene, “He can’t know I told you about him not keeping the presents, Cas. I’m the one who will bear the repercussions, and once he realises that you-” he swallows, “-that you care enough to give me gifts
She leaves him against the headboard, no pillows to elevate him, the dips and corners of the wood details digging into his back as a second parting gift. He coughs because his voice seems to have stopped working past that.
!” the prince bellows in English, growl reverberating through their linked, clothed flesh. Dior can hear Castiel’s thrumming heart, spasming uncontrollably in his veins. His own pulse quickens in response.
Dior is actually very quiet for a long moment. That is - before he starts bursting in tiny, darling giggles. The smell of pastries and sunlight washes over him, hugging him tight, leaving him breathless and making him think he would not mind running out of every single bit of oxygen.
They are halfway through the journey back to the palace so Castiel rationalizes that although there will be nobody to open the door anymore, he can simply put it in the letterbox, thus not breaking any of the institution’s rules.
Dior falls silent for a second before he stutters out his unsure response, “Uh, no - uh, a suit would be warmer.”
Castiel relays all of that information and they arrange a time and day for delivery. Once the tree has been paid for, Dean gives him a receipt and a delivery confirmation. “We’ll send out both a text and email reminder on the day of, just in case,” he tells Castiel.
“I-I…” he starts, trying to say something, anything, ready to beg if needed. Cold sweat trickles down his temple, leaving behind a cold track that’s discomforting in the welcoming warmth of the foyer. “I don’t- Could I-”
Castiel turns to Dean hastily, “I hope I haven’t kept you after closing time. My apologies - I should’ve realised the time.”
He grits his teeth once more before he relaxes his jaw and pushes the jewelry minutely towards the tobacco-smelling alpha in front of him, “Four and two, then.”
, requesting another appointment in three day’s time. It hasn’t occurred to him until then, what a truly impressive coincidence this has been.
And this is precisely why Castiel is doing it. He cares not for such archaic notions. He does not see Dior as his subordinate, as inferior to him in any way - but the omega is unwilling to listen to any of his declarations; words are fruitless to a person that has probably been
I've joined two different SPN Bangs for three different writers so I'm going to be swamped this coming month. No time for my own art so I apologise for the lack of in this chapter and next >.<
“Uhm, yes, of course,” the alpha manages to reply, eyes still focused on the taller man in front of him.
He reaches the double doors and wastes no time in giving three soft knocks. An involuntary breath in betrays nothing amiss, yet his stomach twists uncomfortably in the ten seconds it takes the man to answer the door.
Of course, that new development came with its own set of difficulties and trials. But he was ready to take everything that came with it. A small price to pay for this singular soothing aspect of his being that was not inherently damaged.
He thought of Jack’s mum. Kelly was… she was the brightest star in the inky blackness of their family. Where they were all standoffish, she was pliant. Where he was cold and calculated, she was warm and excitable.
The streets are eerily hushed to him now - no far away steps on cobblestones to be heard, no owl in the distance hooting, no grunts from around dark corners. It’s leaving him on edge - he feels as if on a shop’s display with a big sign that says “come-hither” on his forehead and no defense mechanisms.
“Truly?” the prince asks, heart skipping every other beat, as if a steady rhythm is not vital to his well being.
Dior blinks once, slowly, and Castiel is lost to do anything but follow the path of his eyelashes, how they touch cheekbones before returning to their initial position. “Where are we heading, Castiel?”
Castiel grabbed another egg for himself, not waiting for one of the maids to serve him, which earned him a glare from his mother in turn. “I will have to join you on one of the factory tours for me to be able to make a correct comparison between the machines and myself. I might find myself a new friend.” he tries to make light of the conversation, knowing their mother, as loving as she may sometimes be, her temper is also just as quick to show.
Dior gives a small huff, “They are juvenile and in summer they multiply like weeds. Not refined at all.”
He’d tried, he really did. He didn’t fucking want to find the Prince adorable or handsome or steal soft caresses with the tip of his fingers on the alpha’s arm whenever the omega explained something about his cards. Dior most definitely did not want to feel compelled to sit on the armrest of his chair and whisper lowly in his ear, close enough that he could easily pepper the lobe with a peck and nobody would know.
The winding staircase feels somehow much taller than the last time he had gone up. His heart accelerating, a frenzy in his chest. Castiel half-worries that Dior might appear before him in the same state of undress as last time - a thought which impedes his breathing. However, he is resolute to turn his head away this time, as it is the only proper thing to do. The prince would hate himself if he hurt the omega’s dignity in any way.
. Like all alphas, she was also extremely possessive, which is why she made the prostitutes courtesans without autonomy, so they couldn’t fuck anyone else but they were still cautioned to remember who they belonged to.
It had felt as if someone had punched him right in the sternum, stopping his breathing and broken bones piercing his insides. Dior was no longer floating a few centimeters above the ground, a horrible force promptly hurling him back to reality. But for the chair he was currently holding onto, he would have most certainly collapsed.
way of understanding conversation." Balthazar chuckled, his French accent overriding his English one. "We shall attend to all the important affairs as official Foreign Representatives, force our best British smiles and incessantly ask them for cups of tea. And then I vow to
“Is this a bench or an armchair?” he asks, fingertips pressing experimentally into the plush fabric.
, was that we thought sleeping in might be nice for you. Mondays are the worst,” he tells Dior in a soft voice, eyebrows slanting upwards cutely.
And such a being is not worthy of what lays in front of him, eyes alight with humanity, eyelashes threaded with gold, a wit fit for scholars. Truly - one of God’s special children which cannot - will not - be tainted by a half-baked alpha with childish fancies of plain romances. Not when he stands there garbed in white, shining with Heaven’s blessings and looking for all intent and purposes as if he has descended to the mortal realm mere moments ago.
Silence again, this time the only sound is their combined breathing, scents mingling. Cinnamon explodes in a flurry of spice, affecting the prince’s pulse in a foreign way that travels from his chest to his belly, down his groin, and to his toes. All he can hear is a cacophony of his own mortality. Of his humanity being affected by Dior.
And so, without wanting or meaning to, he whimpers and meowls in pain with every thrust or too-tight grope, client after client is spurred on, thinking they’re providing him with any sort of pleasure, thinking he’s exactly what they’re after - a needy whore.
Lunch passes without any problems. Conversation between the people present goes exactly as Castiel expects: mostly political; how both the countries have been faring in joining The Great Powers, plans of factory implementation and the technological advances. He was pleasantly surprised to see that Princess Margot was well-versed in many aspects to do with the betterment of France and genuinely interested in holding a conversation. She joked that she and her sisters were as different as oil and water and they all agreed. That steered the conversation into the direction of their family.
A mischievous smirk makes an appearance on Dior’s face, “Why not? It might shock them into humility,” he shrugs noncommittally.
“That is if he ever decides to stop his shameful antics and behave like a respectful member of this family.” his older brother, Lucius, scowled from across the table, seated at their father's left. “You have given him too much freedom, mother. At this rate, we will end up with a feral beta on our hands.”
The last button pops free and suddenly, there’s long, athletic arms around his neck. For a deranged second, Castiel wants to close his eyes and lean in. He wants to bend his head and lay small attentions to the sharp jaw, wants to give and give
“People like you, Castiel - full of high hopes and wishes for a better world - will never have an easy time getting through other’s hearts,” Dior comforts him, “Sometimes, the knot is bigger than the heart.”
“I must apologise - when I agreed to share my meals with what I thought should be respectable individuals, I did not realise I would feel the need to
Castiel has to smile - of course the clever man would know, “I have no idea what you are talking about. I suppose paranoia could start early in someone’s life.”
It wasn’t long before the alpha’s carriage arrived to whisk him away to the estate just outside of Paris. It took the better part of an hour to get there through the busy Parisian streets. When he gets out of the carriage, he is greeted by the butler and brought into the dining room where Cain is about to have breakfast. Dior found it ridiculous how late nobles seemed to start their day, but never mentioned anything to the alpha.
“Me too, Balt.” Castiel agreed. Of course, he hated everything to do with social gatherings but that part is always particularly unpleasant.
,” he almost shouts, ashamed and frantic in the knowledge that he won’t be able to go out tonight, causing him to fall back on his plans. “It’s not even half of what you need for the minimum of two weeks!”
He opens the box and places it and the lid next to the ribbon. He doesn’t let go of them when he raises his head, green eyes meeting brown, thunderstorm against sunshine.
His own thoughts start to unravel. Lately, he has found himself with an abundance of his thought process being focused on Dior. This time, he takes in the way he can feel the wisps of anxiety his wolf is emanating, and he cannot help but let his own curls of satisfaction mingle with them. He is rewarded with what feels like a snap of jaws for these emotions colliding.
He tries to concentrate to the best of his abilities, to see if there’s any other clue he can latch on. Nothing. He comes up blank, except for the nagging feeling at the back of his head that he’s forgetting something - multiple somethings - and the echo of that simple ‘
Dior makes an affronted sound but does not deny it, “Fine. But it still d-does not change the fact that a prostitute has no such… liberties, like free thought, to choose a f-favourite flower or a favourite colour-”
“I will write up the contract and receipt. Please bear with me,” he says before he retreats to the room him and Dior were in previously, taking his husband with him.
“There are a dozen other alphas and betas ready to pay the same price that pose less of a threat to his livelihood.”
, arms burrowing further in the hand muff, sinking even more into Cas’ side. There is the smallest of twitches in his jaw.
He goes over and kneels in front of her. “I know you’re tired, and I don’t blame you, but I need you to listen to me for a second,” he instructs.
, his mother had admonished him, after another failed courting. It was not her words that cut so deep, but the look in her eyes. His mother had looked
“You said a doctor came to see me?” Dior asks, unwilling to let the silence stretch any further. Cas’ piercing gaze isn't much help to his crumbling nerves. He kind of wants to hide in a ditch.
He does not have the capacity to focus anymore on the wonderful piece. Instead, he cannot help but notice that if he were to push his fingers in with a little more force, he would be touching the man’s chest - and were he a worthier man, perhaps even his heart.
It was Royal protocol that any alpha member of the Royal Family may not leave the palace with their scents covered or in any way altered. A rule that Castiel truly despised for its antiquity, having been put in place by his great-grandfather who was thought to have had a small
The alpha feels the tentative waves of pride from Dior before they get hidden or squashed and replaced with trepidation. He frowns - this is not the first time his scent has done this. If anything, it must have happened at least a handful of times on this outing alone.
He strolled around for a few minutes, enjoying the decor and the paintings, smiling to himself when he’d seen a few signed ‘Colette Omundson’. They were peaceful, the images. Ease seemed to pour out of them and somehow he could see now why Cain had been so in love with her.
He finds Balthazar in the parlor, hands in pockets, and top hat pristinely on his head. He turns his head when he hears Castiel come in and starts making his way towards him. Balt’s familiar smell started to fill the close space between them and Castiel allowed it to relax him.
“Are their Majesties awake? What about my siblings?” Castiel asked, sitting as still as possible whilst his garments were tugged and wrapped around him expertly.
. That thought alone made it worth it for Castiel. He wanted the people to feel protected and secure in their peace. It had been a long time coming and they all deserved this.
“I find myself forced to agree with you, Cassie. England has its own charm, but the French just have a way with artistry.” his friend hummed in reply, apparently pleased with Castiel’s approval.
He rejected him and Dior was moronic enough to let his body trick itself into thinking that Cas was his- was his-
“Have you seen a physician? It might also be dehydration - have you tried lavender baths? They’re supposed to help - the
“The difference between my brothers and I - in years - is insignificant. But we’ve never shared many interests, thus I found myself alone a lot - not that it ever bothered me. It was very quaint - I enjoyed my time greatly, studying, reading, watching my mother tend to her greenhouse…”
“It’s no trouble, really. Not everyone likes technology.” he offers - though not sure if he’s right or not.
Caesar makes a considering noise at the back of his throat, “I’m sure. To be honest, it feels like for once, it’s the man making the cloth and not the other way around.”
,” Castiel managed to croak out. Marvelous, even his voice was betraying his wavering sanity. Let it be known Castiel James the First was barmy and asinine.
“Your Highness, please don’t apologise. I don’t even know what it would be for.” Dior hurried to say, his hands wringing together.
Dior’s heart is beating a thousand times per second. He hopes it doesn’t affect his scent too much - he’d hate himself for letting his emotion get the best of him and being unable to offer her the comfort she needs right now.
“Come get yer combs! Handmade by a beta artisan, out of basswood and cherry and finished off with all sorts of lacquer!” she shouts, a big toothy smile on her face.
him? Watch the way wings sprouted from his back, ready to take off with the measly lump the omega calls his heart?
Looking at Dior, at his undressed state, at his exquisite soul surrounded by filth and dying sun rays-
. Forget small flushes of his ears, his whole damn face was on fucking fire, ready to melt off and slide on the floor along with the slick he could feel forming. He couldn’t help imagining all the implications of that statement. He also couldn’t bear thinking about it.
Filled with a sudden bravado, he started flirting with the alpha, going as far as snaking his arm through his. He did not feel any remorse at that, it had felt right. It had felt better than anything was supposed to in his shitty life. That emotion tugged and prodded at his heart, intoxicating him more than any alcohol or opiate ever could. He knew the alpha wasn’t on his way to the private parlour, seeing as he was heading in the opposite direction, but Dior was desperate to not allow him out of his sight. Resorting to a bit of manipulation seemed the right thing to do at that moment, seeing how the alpha had played along regardless.
!” She continued, starting to look a little wistful. “I wish any of my clients paid me to do that.” There was a collective agreement and Adrien finally came back up from under the water.
The beta stares at him for a few seconds and then his eyes trail over to Dior, taking in the blanket around his shoulders. Castiel is about to inform him that staring at someone’s companion is impolite, but then the man seems to make a decision and opens the door the rest of the way, inviting them in, “I’ll see if Caesar can do anything for you. Please come in,
His stomach knots over itself, a pleasant, warm feeling coiling around his insides, traveling from the depths of his gut to his chest, up to his neck, until he can feel it blooming in his cheeks. He wants to laugh but finds there’s a weird lump stuck in his throat and is unable to make a single sound.
The beta watches him, poised and serene, scentless bliss. She moves her hand slowly towards the box and Dior almost indulges in the dumb reflex of taking them out of her way, back into his pocket.
Lisa was there when he felt like there was no light in the dark anymore, when he stopped caring what was asked of him - how many blemishes he earned. She was the one to - literally - slap some sense into him, crying
He follows her and closes the door behind him extra gingerly as if him being gentle with the door will make the building forget Ruby’s outburst.
When the other omega stops shaking and there are no more sobs to be heard, she pushes at his chest gently and then looks up into his eyes. They’re red-rimmed and glazed over, dried over tracks visible but ignored.
As a gentle reminder, please keep in mind that in this universe there are Primary and Secondary genders. There are biases and homophobia when it comes to primary genders but not secondary.
Castiel flushed at his friend’s crass comment. “Must you always fluster me so?” He tugged at his waistcoat in an attempt to smooth out his nerves, perhaps.
Dior was strangely embarrassed when that feeling set itself firmly - and apparently quite permanently - in his stomach, noticing how it was travelling down to his now stirring cock. He was afraid he might start leaking slick any moment now, and so he did not move for a little while, trying to get a grip on his arousal. It wasn't a very successful try. That smell only seemed to be getting stronger, slowly destroying his resolve to run away. Instead, he started to walk briskly in the direction he thought it was coming from, coming to a halt when another body slammed into him unceremoniously.
Castiel is entranced by the childish giddiness the omega is showing, and only half-hears himself when he says “Rabbit fur.”
This is the only pawn shop close enough that isn’t high-end and would accept any of his jewelry. Dior’s already tried two others, but they didn’t even bother giving him a quote, sending him on his way without so much as a second glance.
He was assisting a female alpha with a game of chess against her companion when Alastair decided to approach him. “Why, if it is not my favourite whore.” he said with a disgusting smirk, giving one of Dior’s lapels a short but hard tug. “I am glad to see my dear friend still has appropriate tastes in bed warmers.”
Bidding Dean and Sam goodnight, Castiel left the greenhouse with a smile that didn’t cease throughout the ride home, making dinner or Jack’s routine.
Her thumb grazes his knuckles slowly, affectionately and Dior wants to bury his whole being in the warmth of that one, single digit.
Balthazar gave a small sigh in return. “Always ready to douse my pants in cold water, Your Highness. I was hoping to ignore that detail.”
The swabs are the worst. They’re long and cold and stiff and they hurt like a bitch. He hums to himself during this part, sometimes. Dr. Sunders never mentions it and he’s grateful.
There is only sweet silence. A silence that sings with warmth and vibrates with the pleased purrs from his wolf. He mindlessly places the pile of carefully folded fabric in his lap and starts a steady, unfocused caress of the soft blanket. His hands then travel down beneath it and inside the hand muff - which is still warm with either body heat or from the hot water.
, he recounted to himself as a reminder to be civil. His social skills might be ‘rusty’ at best, but he could be diplomatic even if their conversation partners were two of the foulest people Castiel has had the misfortune of meeting.
Dior couldn’t calm down. All of his senses were on edge, his body too hot and too cold at the same time. He felt as if he’d been taken over by some sort of madness, very similar to what the nuns used to call possession back at the orphanage. His actions weren’t his and yet he was perfectly aware he was doing them.
All Balt did was laugh and gently nudge him forward. “Let us go. We are keeping the line of guests waiting.”
“I’m so sorry,” Cas bursts out, desperation edging in his voice. Dior stares at him uncomprehendingly. “I never meant to get in the way of- of your clients or perturb you to the point of such a severe migraine. I have no excuse for the way I acted. Please believe me when I say this has never happened before. I have… I have never even come close to initiating a feral altercation.”
“I am afraid there remains no time for us to visit a restaurant on this occasion. I apologise; I seem to only be doing wrong by you today,” he confesses, unwilling to look in Dior’s eyes.
Cas sprints up without as much as a grimace after sitting on the floor, Grabbing a mug from the nightstand and offering it gingerly to Dior.
The prince takes his hand away from the man’s face, leaving behind warmth and a small grumble of dissatisfaction from the omega which ties the alpha’s stomach in adoring knots. He gathers both of Dior’s lithe hands in his.
“That’s where you’re very wrong, Cas. I am feeling thoroughly entertained,” Dior replies, accentuating his last sentence with a gentle, long tug on the prince’s arm, slowly swaying them to the side and back.
Dior takes one final, long pull of his drink and places the empty mug on the nightstand before steeling his expression and directing it at the other man, “And to answer your other questions: no, I am not allowed to be doing this and no, Crowley isn’t aware.”
Everything should be torment. Why isn’t it? Why is he still not able to feel anything but this deep, insufferable
Cas is merely a meter away from him, the darkness enveloping him almost fully. He’s panting just as hard as Dior but the omega has a feeling it’s because he’s coming down from the hormone surge rather than fatigue.
There is a striking man holding onto him like every other source of warmth has disappeared and he is the only one able to produce any. The smells of happiness and excitement coming off of Dior make his innards flutter so violently in pleasure that he thinks he might be sick - at this point he starts to wonder who came up with the saying “butterflies in the stomach” when it feels like a whole pack of elephants have taken up residence in his.
, but this is one of those times. The box is full to the brim with trinkets, toiletries, and accessories he’s gotten over the years from his clients. They’re not all expensive or luxury items but they’re all untouched, due to varying reasons, and thus could fetch a pretty price to the right buyer.
. A groan almost escaped between his lips but he stopped it with a bite to the inside of his cheek. The alpha was looking up at Dior through his eyelashes, a motion so fucking adorable that should not have been possible with those masculine features. The coiling heat in his loins started travelling upwards towards his chest, causing him to feel strangely light and euphoric, as if anything he did would not matter. It was a giddy feeling, much like Dior felt after a good amount of liquor, but without the consequences.
Cas watches bemused as Dior groans before he catches sight of his hands in Cas’ and the new scent in the carriage. The prince has the good manners to look abashed when the other man asks, “Did you - Castiel did you
By the time eleven strikes, he feels rattled from his depths, limbs useless, pain excruciating, sense still dulled. His fever has not broken, adding another layer of red to his skin - red that has barely settled down since this morning. There’s tingling all over his body, in small areas, where liquid-filled blisters have formed.
They arrived at the palace shortly after midday struck. This time, there was a grand reception, many people gathering before the gates, colourful paper confetti thrown around, cheers being heard from every angle, French royal guards riding in a march in front and behind their carriage (an ostentatious thing that bore his family’s insignia but so very French in its design). He and Balthazar waved to the masses, making sure they didn't lean out the windows too much. Castiel might have been able to prevent a commotion with their arrival at the port, but he knew this display was necessary for their arrival at the capital. It was there for the people’s benefit. They needed to see, to have visual evidence, that the relationship between their countries is good, solid,
There is a buzz thrumming under the alpha’s skin, restlessness taking over his entire body, fueled by the excitement of knowing he is mere hours away from spending the evening in Dior’s presence. He smiles at his friend, unable to stop his mouth from doing so even if he wanted - an impossible feat when he thinks of the omega’s quick wit, kind, verdant eyes and the lilt of his voice.
“Yes,” Cas replies, unsure what exactly Dior is referring to, but knowing he has meant every single thing that he has let out into the world today.
The omega looks amused at his antics and Castiel is relieved his honesty was not distasteful. “I would have liked to see the coach master's face when he realised what you were up to,” he teases.
This is a lot of information to take in and absorb at once. Castiel had expected difficult situations that would have led Dior to start working at the
It’s a completely valid concern and rule, but when he thinks of Castiel’s honest gaze and trembling hands... He finds that he appears to have suddenly grown reckless.
. He tip-toes the building bent in half, pressure the only thing keeping the monster living in his guts at bay.
He takes out his small linen pouch from the breast pocket of his thin indoor coat and jiggles it in front of Lisa, dismayed, “I’m not. I was barely able to get
When they make their way outside - Dior still with the blanket around his shoulders - they walk the steps up to the five-story building in front of them. Even with the many lamp posts down the street, it is hard to make out any details except for the shiny plaque that holds information about the building’s inhabitants.
The beta keeps writing, her fountain pen making scratching sounds on the thin paper, and doesn’t look at him when she replies, “At least until I get back the blood samples and swabs looked at. Until then you’re in perfect health. A prized, perfect
He takes another deep breath for good measure, “I only have nine francs and forty-five centimes,” he murmurs, head bowed and palm messing up his hair and the other scrunching up the bottom of his coat. He paints the perfect picture of a small, distressed child in the form of a grown man.
Dior whips his head back up, eyes wide in disbelief. The alpha’s face is dripping with hurt, betrayal. The scent of soggy paper screaming sadness. Dior’s heart quivers -
He sobs and then he keeps doing it until it’s all he can hear and he keeps wailing and uses the last pea of strength he’s got to try and
“I am sure that is not true - I already know you have weird tastes in architecture,” the alpha replies.
“That’s fine. Thank you,” he takes a tentative sniff of the plate and makes a sound of contentment “Mmm, smells good.”
adorable - but rather at the fact that he’s actually considering saying yes. Okay, so fine - he might be overprotective of the boy but nobody can hold that against him.
“Come in - I’ve looked forward to our appointment,” Dior tells him, moving to the side so Castiel can enter, and promptly closing the door once he has.
Once he sees a pup, he’s almost winded with the reminder of why he’s here in the first place. Fingers curling around the box and bag strings, Dior takes a fortifying breath and starts walking again, this time slower and with a bit more trepidation.
He was just about finished when another knock on his door came. “It’s Alfie, Your Highness. I bid you a good morning. May I come in?”
Taking off her gloves and disposing of them, she starts writing her results in her big diary, the one that she keeps specifically for this
Dior watched the alpha straighten himself up, retouching his cravat and pulling on his waistcoat. He allowed his gaze to trail down the man’s body, covered in a wonderful blue suit that did nothing but make him glow, as if he was the one radiating light. If anyone were to ask, Dior did
He gulps. Maybe he’s developed some fucked-up sense of self-worth because he suddenly feels like all eyes are on him, stealing glances with the minutest of movement of eyeballs. The smells are muted here - nowhere near as encompassing as they were in the market square - but he’s pretty sure he can still distinguish at least a couple of alphas.
. The sound of the suitcase opening. Dior closes his eyes and tries to morph his face with his blanket, hands fisting in the bedding.
“I was a beggar for a couple of months before Crowley found me, right before my first heat outside of the monastery hit - incredible luck, if you ask me.”
“Here we are, my Lord,” Dior said as he placed one of his hands on Castiel’s shoulder, yet to let go of his arm. He leaned in closer, and for a second Castiel thought he might keel over. “If you require me, all you need to do is wave me down and I shall come,” the omega whispered, only for his ears.
Castiel is forced to bear witness to absurd amounts of distressing opinions and arguments - how such people should be dragged naked through the streets with their hands and legs bound, how they should be left to rot in Church dungeons for rats to feast on the sinner’s flesh.
Dr. Sunders doesn’t go straight to his dick this time, opting to check his ears and nostrils instead. He exhales a small, relieved breath.
“You’re very charming this morning, ain’t you?” he asks her, rolling his eyes. He makes for his laundry basket but is too slow and she easily swipes it out of his grasp.
The ragged rhythm now stopped, he’s able to vaguely concentrate on her breathing. They breathe in and exhale together, clumsily at first and then steadily.
“His Majesty has been incredibly accommodating in regards to France’s impressive resources,” Balt says, joining the conversation. “I will say that I am eager to see the franc increase in value - hopefully it will enable higher import of non-native goods and produce.”
“Your Majesty, King Azazel of France and your Highnesses, Crown Princess Abbadon, Princess Lilith and Princess Margot. Prince Castiel James the First and His Grace Lord Balthazar of the Roché Duchy greet you. We thank you for your benevolent welcome to your country and home. God bless the Royal Family.” Castiel greeted, his head bowed low, one hand gently touching the floor, one touching his chest. Formal greetings to the Royals in their own countries were always complicated and had to be tip-toed around. A small price to pay for peace, really.
Castiel takes his hand off the back of the sofa, “Forgive me. I do not mean to be such a bad guest.”
The man comes closer and it only gets worse from here, his dark blonde hair glowing orange in the sunlight and his voice deep and smooth - completely different than what it sounded through the radio.
He excused himself from the couple with half a word, knowing full well he must have appeared a lunatic. Castiel couldn’t find it in himself to care. His legs lead him around the waves of people, going faster and faster until he was practically skipping across the building. Every time he thought he was getting closer to the source of this smell, it seemed to disappear between the vast amount of other smells. Everything else smelled so wrong. Had the world always smelled so… awful?!
“Oh.” was all the alpha had said, followed by several long seconds of silence. Well, he’s gone and done it now, kicked himself in the face and ate the damn foot as well.
,” he starts, hand freeing the bag strings slightly, “I’m here for a friend. Do you have any rooms available?”
“It seems your prostitute knows quality when he sees it. I thought for a second he was blind to have not thrown up on your shoes the moment your grotesque visage appeared.” One of the other men - a short and stocky alpha - at the table said, getting up.
“The honour would be ours, Your Highness, the Crown Princess.” Balthazar replied, giving her what Castiel would class as his ‘killer smile’. It seemed to work as the Princess gave him a small smirk.
. Instead, he settled for something less disturbing, “I bid you a good night, Your Highness. It was delightful to meet you.”
“If it will stop them from spouting anymore nonsense and giving me headaches every day, I am willing to try almost anything.”
“If I did not know any better, I would have claimed we have stepped inside the Garden of Eden, Balthazar. These gardens are astonishing,” Castiel whispered to his friend, awe slipping between his words. “I can’t smell anything except God’s perfect creations. It’s brilliant.”
, he was planning on finishing his bath, then talking to Crowley about Lisa, and now it’s looking like he’ll have to delay that to deal with this shit.
Paris was a burst of activity, sounds and smells. People either walked with a purpose or lagged behind, enjoying their surroundings. Castiel was part of that second group. He stood in front of the impressive stone building ahead of him, his heart’s pulse resonating loudly in his ears. He could also feel it travel through his skin, on every centimeter of his body. He had been feeling like he was vibrating from the moment he escaped the palace, through the servant’s door, and the feeling continued to become more and more distinct, to the point that he thought it had become visible.
The omega wants to laugh. Of course he’s forgetting a shit tonne of stuff. He can’t remember anything beyond wet steps, hurried French and black robes.
professional. Nobody likes an expressionless omega prostitute. He always made sure to be just the right amount of sheepish, seductive but still assertive when needed. He prided himself in being bought for other uses except being a hole to fuck.
His thumb never stops stroking. The purring never ceases. A cold hand finds its home atop Castiel’s, its pressure an embrace. Fingers do not intertwine, simply cradle, never slipping away from each other even as Dior’s head finds its way to the alpha’s shoulder - smoothly, like the path was predetermined. Like this was always the only thing that could have ever happened.
The prince allows himself a tiny laugh as his best friend throws his arm around his shoulders, dragging him down to his height to have his forehead flicked.
The staring goes on long enough that the adrenaline fades completely, along with the warmth it lets flow in his veins. His hands go automatically around himself, to hold onto his upper arms in an attempt to shield himself from the cold. He flinches a bit when his left hand curls around the spot where Castiel’s gotten hold of him earlier. The flinch turns into a shiver when he allows himself a second to savour the shallow ache - proof that Castiel had touched him.
Before Castiel could register any one thing, the omega was at his side, gingerly sliding his arm through his and started leading the way in the opposite direction of the ballroom. The world around him became a lie and the only truth he had ever known was this apparition that took the form of a man and whisked his wits away. There was nothing else but green, skin, and snow weaving into his consciousness.
Everyone else decided to place down their cards, nobody going all in. Dior looked at the presenting hands and excitedly announced the winner of this round, “Ah. It appears the winner is, once again,
“Would you like to join me on this side of the carriage?” Dior asks again, and slides to one side in one fluid movement. Castiel would be admiring his poise if only his brain was in working order and not flooded with images of shared body heat and brief touches. The
“It’s only fair; If you laugh at my expense, doesn’t it seem only right I get something in return? I was thinking a slice of pie would be a good payment,” the omega says.
“If you want to help, we’ll do it this way,” he says, finishing with a small flick of his tongue where Cas’ earlobe meets his neck.
No, what hits him is a horrifying, agonizing headache. It hits Dior so suddenly and out of nowhere, like lightning struck straight in his skull, through his brain, and zipped to the base of his spine. He staggers and hears a dreadful shriek in his ears which he belatedly realises was him.
Cain takes him to a nice but not luxurious restaurant and he appreciates it. He wouldn't have been comfortable in a more upscale place. His etiquette wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t that exercised, either. They were sat at a more private table and the alpha told him to get whatever he wanted, paying no mind to the prices.
“I have many visits to make today. It will have to be plain soap. Please do make Alfie aware I am awake and will require his assistance after I have bathed.”
“My family, country and I welcome you. You can raise yourselves.” and so Castiel and Balt did, meeting the King’s eyes. “And thank you. For being here and solidifying our budding friendship. We hope you enjoy your stay.”
At Lisa’s weak nod, Dior resumes getting her cleaned, still as carefully as earlier but hastier. He makes sure he rubs his scent and the lavender into all of her vital scent points, disregarding Lisa’s toiletries (the generic ones Crowley provides all of his omegas) and using his ones instead (the ones Crowley buys only him and Ruby).
Balt shrugs, expression cavalier, “It could very well be our darling Queen and King, Cassie! You might have another sibling come summer.”
Missouri, as he’d come to know the matron as, is sitting at the front desk, arms crossed over the desk, smiling wide and inviting. Sometimes, Dior feels like she knows he’s coming before he’s even made it down the road.
There lays Cas, still fully clothed in his expensive outfit - which makes the omega suddenly very aware that he, too, is still in last night’s assemble of stockings, short petticoat and corset (although that one seems to be a lot looser than he’d done it up).
This particular ball is supposed to be a grand one. It had been the talk of the week amongst the foreign representatives during dinner. One of the Dukes had stepped back from high society for a while, very close to disappearing, and everyone was intrigued to see his return. Rather, everyone was eager to see this man fail and shame himself by proving he was no longer adequate enough for the high society.
The Russian stops eating and places his cutlery neatly back on the table, “Perhaps the numbers have not been colossal, but they are relevant enough,” he links his fingers together over his almost finished plate and tries to lock eyes with a still-eating Castiel. “Betas have always been regarded as alphas’ right hands, having proven themselves to be useful in all manner of jobs and positions - their value undeniable, despite their inferiority to alpha prowess.”
“Here’s your money. Now get out, you stink,” the alpha tells him with disdain, dropping the few livres down on the counter unceremoniously.
Cain looked straight at Dior with an unwavering, yet oddly vexed gaze. It didn’t need a genius to figure out what the alpha was alluding to.
Castiel looked up at Balthazar and locked eyes for a while. He hoped his eyes could tell his friend what his mouth wouldn’t. As always, Balt did not disappoint. “My apologies, Castiel. I do hope you know I only have your best interest at heart. I was not insinuating anything more except that a perfectly lovely person finds you comely and it may not be such a bad thing to have a bit of fun.”
In his panic to find an appropriate and definitely not unintelligent reply, he realises that he is unequipped to reply accordingly and decides to change the subject.
He brings the piece he picked up to his mouth and bites into it, flabbergasted to find that the inside is soft and creamy and - is that
The carriage has been parked in front of the building for twenty minutes and Castiel is both drunk on honeyed pecans and despairing over the passing of time.
.” the exquisite baritone voice replied, impassive. The alpha did not sound impressed with this pissing contest. “I could not help but overhear you are planning on engaging in poker. Balthazar has abandoned me and I find myself in need of some…gaiety.”
“First, I have to deal with entitled officials back home - officials who do not know the difference between their scent and mating gland - and now I have to listen to such outdated, oppressive and virulent spiels?” Castiel huffs, scent still rotted to the core.
He had also learned that if Prince Castiel was confused or uncertain, he tilted his head to the side in what must have been the most endearing motion mankind has to offer. He squinted his eyes slightly, a small frown on his lips and slight line between his brows. Dior’s fingers twitched, wanting to smooth out the crease every time it appeared.
It was at that moment when another figure appeared at the top of the stairs, very obviously the Grand Duke. He spoke with a clear voice, his posture straight and proper, the perfect image of proud, dignified Alpha. “Welcome. You have all made me very happy by attending tonight.” he started. “I would like to take this moment to apologise for my absence this past year. I know I have worried friends and associates and for that, I am regretful. Tonight is to honour my late wife and mate, Colette.”
Castiel never takes his eyes off the other people, although it means having to lean over Dior’s shoulder.
But he had a job to do. So when Alastair commanded he get on his knees and suck his cock, he did. When he was roughly thrown in his bed back at the
“Yes - just the once. A reply to my second letter pertaining to a detailed recounting of the meetings and mingling we have partaken in,” he says, tone flat.
Dior nods, “Yes. Most are treatable if you’ve got access to a doctor. But what would a penniless nightwalker have? Nothing, Cas. If you’re out there on your own, you’ve got two options: die from some horrible, shitty disease or die at the hands of someone with more power than you.”
There was a moment of hesitation from his maid before she decided against reminding him that a man of his position should let his maids assist him. Hannah knew him better than that. “As you wish, Your Highness. I will let Alfie know to join you soon.”
“It does sound like a very unique way to perish, though,” the prince quips. “I imagine tales of it would become local myths.”
They walk in relative silence for a minute or so, Castiel racking his brain for something to say but being unable to take his eyes off the man walking in front of him. He’s so busy staring at the way Dean’s hair comes out from under his beanie and curls around it that he almost doesn’t notice the man falling in step with him.
“You flatter us with such companionship, Meg. Please do address us as Castiel and Balthazar. A courtesy of this magnitude must be offered back,” Balthazar said.
Suddenly, there is a thumb on each of his wrists, leaving footprints of a waltz into his skin. Dior starts leaning forward, his eyelids drooping and breath slowing, whereas Cas feels like his own has stopped altogether.
falls quiet, even to his dulled ears, Dior dresses in light clothes, hoping the biting temperatures outside will bring forth
His friend has always been quiet, in a mature and collected sort of way. She loves a good laugh and playing around with the other omegas at the
“Since the question needs to be asked, we suppose the answer is no, Sergei,” Princess Margot replies - using his first name as a subtle power move - still taking dainty bites of her dwindling meal.
on all fronts. That belief continued until his eighteenth birthday. He had sneaked off to take a break from the stuffy celebration his family had organised, when the daughter of a noble had followed him. They were exchanging what Castiel had thought was polite conversation until she grabbed his jacket and tugged him down for an unexpected kiss.
Castiel was stunned to see how easily they talked about the King’s late wives, three of them in total. They had each borne him a daughter only to either die in childbirth or from complications. The King itself had joked about
needs to take you a peg or two - or four - down, no?” Castiel replies, stopping in front of a tree when movement catches his eye.
They sit in comfortable silence, their breaths and water lapping softly the only sounds in the room. It’s when he takes her other arm that Lisa speaks again, “I’m in a lot of trouble,” she says, voice wavering slightly but not taking on that distinct wetness.
He takes a few seconds to regulate his breathing once he’s outside, heart thrumming through his veins, blood pumping into his eardrum - he’s actually done it!
From little things like preferring raspberries over strawberries, to personality altering traits. The latter has become painfully obvious only in the last month when he had to start leaving his nephew at the nursery during work hours.
He doesn’t look at her but can feel her head turning, gaze focused on his face, “Aren’t you going to ask?” she says.
With that, the group left the parlour that was designated for poker and pool and headed back into the main ballroom. Dior headed to the cloak room and waited for the servant to bring back his outerwear. He couldn’t smell anything on the teenager, which indicated he was a Beta. And yet, Dior could see his cheeks reddening at the sight of him, quickly scurrying to the closet. If even a beta’s very limiting scenting abilities were able to start such a reaction, Dior suspected the new enhancing bath salts Crowley purchased were doing their job. Jesus, he could even smell himself which never happened outside of his heats and he was most definitely not due for another month or so.
“I’m sure he will appreciate hearing that. I feel like he’s not happy with my independence when it comes to dressing.” Castiel sighs, genuinely affected. “Since when did you care about propriety and palace rules?”
since he’s literally shaved a couple of days ago. Even so, there is, undoubtedly, a good layer of hair across his shins and calves. Dark blonde and thicker than he’s ever seen any of his body hair appear, it still glints in the sunlight, as if it had any business being there - on his freaking skin.
. Even with this new information, he refuses to open his eyes and destroy the peaceful moment he finds himself in. He pays close attention to his hearing and picks up on a second person’s quiet inhales and exhales.
She disappears through the kitchen door and Dior wastes no time in leaning against the wall, his ragged breathing coming through. Fuck, this is getting impossible. He needs to go before he collapses.
The subtle vibration of agitation that was under his skin turns hostile and he can feel a low growl ready to take form at the back of his throat - except the person it wants to be directed at is not in the room and it would only cause distress. And so he swallows, puts his gloves in his pocket and closes the distance between the two of them.
During breakfast, though, he seems to take a turn for the worse. His appetite has taken a vacation, apparently, and every bite of buttered bread only seems to make his nausea worse. He excuses himself after eating half of his food to start heating the water. The boiler room is barely twenty steps away but his feet are lead and it takes an incredible amount of effort to get there. Sweat forms on his forehead and once he’s behind the door, he leans back on it to catch his breath.
He leaves feather-like traces of his lips over Cas’ earlobe and purrs louder when the alpha’s breath stutters, big hands flying over the omega’s ribs, digging the bones of his corset further into his ribs. God, he’s so close to his scent gland he could swear it’s
Castiel was going to contend such a fallacy but the words died in his mouth. Instead, all he could achieve was to try his name on his tongue. “Dior,” he repeated, heart flogging in his chest. What a fitting name for a deity with locks made of gold that had been worn and treasured until it took on a darkened tinge as a result. No other shade of gold will ever do again, they were ruined, never to be glanced at again.
Finally, after what had seemed like decades, guests started arriving, some slowly trickling into the parlour. Everyone appeared to be in a jolly mood and he prayed a silent ‘
“Forgive me, master. This unworthy pest has managed to catch a cold on the day of your beloved visit,” he laments, voice croaky, arms rickety as he lowers himself fully to the ground, bringing his mouth close to the pointed ends of her shoes but not touching.
Dior searches his eyes, piercing Castiel in a way he has started finding comfort. When he finds what he is looking for he replies, “Alright.”
“It thrills me to be able to share this with you, Dior,” he comforts the omega, pulling him closer to him ever so slightly, an action which the other man notices, if the spike in cinnamon is to be trusted.
“How are you, Dr. Sunders?” he asks, starting to undo his dressing-gown, “You look as lovely as always,” he winks, still finding it harder to breathe than normal.
He doesn’t bother covering himself and makes a bee-line for the woman, wrapping his arms around her shoulders and cradling her head in his neck, aiming for his scent gland. He doesn’t ask anything and Lisa doesn’t offer him any words, just soft shaking of her shoulders and small, sharp intakes of breath as she takes in his scent, attempting to calm down.
Foil -  a sword with a light, flexible blade of rectangular cross-section tapering to a blunt point.
!” one of the girls chipped in, coming quickly to rest her elbows on the edge next to him. She was a wispy thing with a mop of brown hair. “Adrien had a client today that -” before she could finish the sentence the rest of them erupted in giggles again and one of the boys submerged himself completely under the water, groaning.
“As you’ve probably noticed, seeing as you’re in the damn greenhouse, Samuel,” he replies, grumpy edge to his tone but eye lighting up as soon as he sees Castiel - or wait, no, he’s looking at Jack. Not Castiel - stop. “Aw, hey there, lil’ guy! You brought daddy over for some fun?”
The prince does not take the man’s hand as he had done earlier - he no longer feels he has the right. Instead, he hopes his gaze is honest enough to make the omega aware he means the next words from the bottom of his heart.
“You must be famished. The journey from Calais to Versailles isn’t an agreeable one at this time of the year. We have prepared for lunch. Please allow us the honour and dine with us.” one of the princesses said. It was the first-born, Crown Princess Abbadon. Her portrait did not do her justice. Her long, bright red tresses were cascading down to the small of her back in soft curls, very much against what he knew to be in trend amongst French nobility. Her face, although exquisite with sharp features, was cold and calculating. If Castiel had not been used to such frosty looks from the British court, he might have physically shivered.
Fists tighten on his lap, unworthy thoughts floating at the back of his throat, fighting for a chance to be conveyed into reality: that he would very much like to see him every day, to not need to travel an hour to be graced by his light but instead waking up with it by his side. That if he was ever given a choice, he would have liked to be born on this Earth as a person deserving of such an honour, such a miracle.
The last part of the Russian’s speech is shouted with so much contempt it easily rolls into the sap of his smell and into the room, changing the atmosphere immediately. There’s silence at first but then the room erupts in different ranges of affront, smells quickly becoming overwhelmingly sharp and tart.
Dior leaves the room and breaks into a half-run down the stairs to the second floor, heading straight to Lisa’s room, grabbing a change of clothes and her toiletries. It’s barely two minutes he’s been gone but he’s still expecting to find her crying again or, worse, gone.
“It is settled, then. Three-piece suit with accessories,” Castiel addresses the beta who stops whispering in his husband’s ear.
“If I have slighted you, I suppose it is only right for me to repay you,” he says and Dior nods very seriously, his mouth turning up even more. “But, alas, I believe there is nowhere to purchase such an item at this hour. There is no time, either.”
Listening to the low growl in his mind and letting the wisps of worry flow in his veins - he is grateful. He and his counterpart have always been at odds, not a lot of that harmonious coexistence books speak about - but this is one thing they are in unanimous agreement.
’. Lorette sits on the floor at his legs, head in his lap, and starts humming a song he once said he likes ‘
“You smell… like someone’s poured tar on a heap of rotting flowers and left it out in the blistering summer sun,” Aiden tells him, reluctant. And this? This tells Dior all he needs to know. Aiden has never been anything but courteous when it comes to someone’s personal scent. The fact that he’s so blunt in regards to how crummy he must smell…
The beta’s gaze unwavering, she appears to take everything he’s saying with the type of seriousness Dior hasn’t had directed at him outside of the
Dior’s demeanor changes in an instant, shoulders and smile dropping, eyes drooping to the ground. At that moment, the coat seems to engulf him, looking the perfect picture of a pouting, incredibly adorable pup. When a small, aggravated huff escapes the omega, Cas cannot hold back any longer and lets out an unintentional small puff of laughter.
front doors, and he has been relentlessly tugging on them intermittently in an attempt to calm himself.
Relief washes through him when the crowd starts getting thicker, scents upon scents becoming indistinguishable between each other. The next corner he takes, the bustle seems to explode, people no longer walking in lines to get to a destination, but going around in circles, shoulder bumping into shoulder, voices raising on top of each other in order to be heard over the general frenzy.
him. He arched his back in languid movements, bent over shoulders, the pool table, anything at his waist, anything that would stretch the fabric of his suit and give bawdy peeks of his bosom. He caressed the patrons softly, the same way he’d like to touch the blue-eyed wonder of a man, with gentleness and not so subtle hunger.
It was very unbecoming, he knew, but he felt the need to feel the stretch of his limbs in a way that wasn’t straight and stiff.
Standing in the doorway was the most stunning man Castiel has ever seen - or could have possibly imagined. He watched as the man cursed under his breath and shook a light layer of snow off of his shoulders and hair, the drowning sun right behind him, engulfing his whole body and accentuating a perfect silhouette and - and Castiel suddenly forgot how to breathe.
Typically, this is when Jack started fussing. “Oh no, buddy.” Castiel said, stopping and going around to the front of the stroller. He quickly checked his nappy - clean - then checked his temperature - seemed normal. “He must be hungry. I’m so sorry about this - he usually goes longer without a bottle-” he starts explaining but Jack’s muffled sniffs have evolved into crying.
“I still do not know what you mean,” he replies, their bodies unconsciously leaning marginally toward each other.
With everything laid out and ready to be cooked, he checks to see if the water is done boiling. He fills the communal tub first, making sure there is enough water for everyone to soak at a comfortable level. Dior knows how important a good bath is at the start of the day and he’s going to make sure they never lack for that.
“I will, I will, I just need to take this off. Will you let me, Dior?” his alpha asks, as if Dior’s body hasn’t belonged to him since the night they met.
How disgusting, isn’t it? That he finds pleasure even in the pain if it means it was left behind in anything else but mindless lust.
He turns away once figures pass the threshold, intentions of all shades of mud following close behind. There’s no need to watch what his body remembers, what he can feel dragging painfully over every corner. Curious - he’d have thought there’d be no feeling as a shadow.
Then again, he’d read that book a while ago - maybe the market had changed in the meantime. The French currency is known to be fickle and change constantly. Dior could simply be out of the loop. It wouldn’t be the first time his knowledge would prove lacking.
Castiel feels goosebumps scatter along his back and arms, “I am not - There has been no courting, Balthazar. We simply spent one evening together.”
“You have my word,” he says. “I simply wanted to repay you for earlier - for when you did the same to me. I- are you mad?”
The radio was silent for a bit longer than what Castiel assumed was normal before it crackled back to life and a muffled voice came through.
“I must confess, that was not the impression I got from you, Castiel. You keep on surprising me. I like it, please continue to do so,” Meg laughed together with Balthazar and they both looked at him cordially.
“Phenomenal!” the alpha beamed, looking close to ecstatic. “Tell me how this works, I have never called upon such an institution. Would an appointment be appropriate?”
It takes about fifteen minutes to decide on a tree. When Castiel tells Dean he wants it potted, Dean beams again, very pleased to hear that, and makes a passing comment about how
“Your Highness, you must not! I will be severely berated if the head maid ever found out I let you light the fire with your precious hands.” the maid frantically said, hurrying to Castiel’s side.
He wanted to ask Dior whatever he had meant, he wanted to grab his shoulder, to yell after him, to sweep him off his feet. Anything to stop him from putting such a heartbreaking distance between them. Instead, Castiel watched him go, back dignified and bowed legs sauntering alluringly away.
He made his way back up, spread lavender bath salts at the bottom of his tub and filled it with the hot water. He set his shampoo, conditioner, and scent neutralizing soap on the floor before sinking into the water, giving a contented sigh. This was the best part of his day. Dior leaned his head back and put his arms along the edge of the tub, staring at the ceiling.
She caught Castiel’s eye with a playful glint in her own, mouth quirked in a mischievous smile. He suddenly felt his shirt a lot tighter around his neck. He reckoned those two sisters would be giving him a lot of trouble during their stay. Princess Lilith on the other hand, seemed to want to be anywhere but here. Not necessarily displeased, just… bored.
“How the tables have turned. It is usually me calling you that,” the Prince says, bumping his shoulder against Balt’s. It has the desired effect and his friend grants him a small smile - it’s a shadow of his usual dazzling ones, but Castiel will take what is given to him.
“Would you please have a drink? The doctor said it is essential you stay hydrated,” the prince says, concern vivid in his scent.
It’s midnight when he slips through the same ground-floor window, long legs revealed to the world and corset heavy with covered latex.
his sense of smell. He can’t go around like this - it’s almost as bad as suddenly losing his eyesight.
Dior throws him what can only be an exasperated look, “I can see what you are trying to do here, Castiel.”
They’re led through a short hallway and into a sitting room. Half of the room is full to the brim with bolts upon bolts of fabric, rolls of delicate lace and satin ribbons scattered everywhere in a multitude of colours and patterns. There are high bookcases against the walls - some of the shelves are filled with books, some with sewing patterns either neatly folded up or dangling down from under makeshift weights keeping them in place.
It doesn’t take long for the burning to mold into a stale, wet smell, resignation filling his entire body. This isn’t the time or the place - not that it ever is. Omegas aren’t meant to talk back - they’re meant to listen and agree prettily. Meant to have their lights dimmed and dreams shattered before they even learn what they are.
“Now you're being obnoxious just for the sake of being difficult,” Balt chuckles. “Come. I will call for our coats and we can take a stroll through the back gardens.”
But the pecan has turned slightly roasted and it floats underneath the sunrays. It feels heavy, reluctant - on guard.
He tried his best to straighten himself and to reign in his craving to reach out and embrace the man in front of him. After taking a deep breath, he brought his attention back to the verdant eyes. “
Once he’s all dressed, cloth bag in his hand, and Lisa cuddled up in his bed, he kisses her head once more before exiting the room. He sticks the note he wrote in between the door moulding, in easy sight.
Dior arches an eyebrow at him but goes inside the building all the same. The steps are steep and numerous as they make their way to the third floor. There are two doors on this floor and they head for the one at the other end.
“Ruby was on a warpath again this morning,” Aiden moans, slumping down in his chair and leaning his head against the backrest. “She started pacing aggressively before the sun rose. I’ve told her it makes it sound like the walls are falling apart when she does that. Did she care, though? Of course not,” he gripes with a dramatic rise of both his arms, then letting them flop lifelessly on his lap. “I’m so tired.”
. They don’t have any housekeepers to help out so they have to do everything themselves. He isn't particularly bothered about it since he likes keeping busy and feeling useful. His body has developed its own routine so he is up before the sun has even started its ascent.
Has the prince been selfish all this time? He has not stopped to think whether the omega would be happy to accept what Castiel wishes to give. Not stopped to wonder whether it is simply just his delusional fancy that Dior would be
It was another thing that caused him and his family great anguish. Castiel felt his mood drop further at the reminder of his inadequacy.
Picking up his pace, he makes his way back. It’s almost midday now. There’s not much time left for Dior to go to the last two places he needs and then head back to the
Dior finishes and stuffs his hands in the sleeves of his coat, never stopping the stroll - maybe not a stroll since their pace was rather hasty - or removing his arms from around Castiel’s.
The Crown Princess loved being reminded of how above everyone else she was. She liked to dominate, to belittle, to subjugate, to
Another quick glance at his pocket watch informs the prince that they only have fifty minutes left until it strikes eleven. It is about a twenty-five minute carriage ride to the
“Please, Dior,” the alpha pleads, resuming his ministrations through Dior’s hair. “We need to divest you of this in order to assess the damage-”
“Please pardon me-” Castiel says, face straight, as he reaches out to one of Dior’s ears and applies light pressure to the red-white top.
He breaks it, the pressure behind his throat breaking alongside it, like the skies cracking and finally flooding rain, “You feel
The younger man brings his nose to graze along the alpha’s jaw, a purr breathing life into his chest. He lets it sing up his throat and into Castiel’s ear. Dior feels his face catch fire - the purring still surreal to him, a phenomenon he thought he was incapable of until Castiel barged into his life and seemed to demand everything of him without needing to ask.
A flash of hurt seemed to pass over the Prince’s features for a second. “You were kind enough to show me the way earlier this evening and I did not even have the courtesy of telling you my own name.” the alpha clarified, his expression bright again, a shy smile spreading on his face, white teeth peeking beneath. Dior felt his knees quiver.
The opening reveals a tall, muscular, beta man in a half-undone linen shirt and loose linen trousers. The lights scattered behind him drench his front in harsh, dark shadows, making him look slightly menacing.
Cain came to see him shortly before the first guests were due to arrive. He had thanked Dior again for his help and promised to pay him handsomely.
Dior’s eyes widen further, the weak tremor that was going through him earlier now distinguishable in every part of his body. “No, Castiel. I am but another product of today’s society. You- you could find a few dozens like me i-if you only walked twenty spaces out of this boulevard,” his voice trembles now, too.
After she looks satisfied that he hasn’t caught dog mange or anything as morbid, she pulls on gloves and drags his knees up and apart, exposing him in a very similar - yet awfully different - way to the position he takes on for his clients.
He’d totally lost his shit with Cas. The omega didn’t mean to be so angry. He tries so fucking hard to never lose his temper, no matter how low the feeling simmers in his soul every moment of every day. It’s terrifying, that he feels safe enough to lose himself with Castiel, at the same time as feeling petrified of pushing too far and having his nightmare materialised.
“Lucius, please do not tantalize your brother. He works very hard for you to inherit a great kingdom.” Their mother berated, throwing a stern glance at her son, annoyance slipping in her scent.
Dior felt bile rising, half wishing he’d empty his guts on the alpha’s shoes. Thankfully, that’s when the servant returned with their drinks, and without letting go of his waist, Alastair dragged him back to where Uriel was standing. A third person had joined him and Dior had to swallow his apprehension. It was no other than the Crown Princess Abbadon.
“You would like me to lead the entertainment in the private parlours,” Dior stated simply, not breaking eye contact.
Castiel delivers his speech with dedication he reserves for the official political meetings back home, voice loud enough to be confident but not overwhelming, conviction dripping from his every word and Dior-
He tries smelling himself, concentrating on encouraging his scent gland to exude extra pheromones. Both of his younger protegees sneeze at the sudden assault and immediately go to cover their noses, a sign that Dior has overdone it and released way too much.
Once Dior is well and truly gone, only then does Castiel allow himself to tell the carriage driver to make his way back to the palace. He then settles back onto the seat, in the space the omega had occupied only a few minutes past, but which feels like an eternity already.
The carriage pulled up in front of the palace’s entrance but neither he nor Balt got out yet. They first needed to be announced, which happened very shortly after.
Cas scrunches his eyes closed in consternation, “I am ashamed and mortified of my actions. If you decide you never wish to see me again, then it is simply what I deserve.”
“Open about their sexualities? Needs? Animal nature?” Balthazar offered and Castiel shrugged. “It’s very different for escorts and prostitutes here, my friend. Completely legal, tolerated and more than encouraged. It is seen as a way of life, some might even call it a necessity for societal entertainment. Those two…” he nods his head in the direction of the courtesans “...are some of the most expensive and reputable escorts Paris has to offer.”
Missouri said the cook might need an errand-runner. His old one broke their leg yesterday. Isn’t that wonderful news?”
The omega submerges completely, up to under his chin, making sure his scent gland is covered and remains in the tub until it has started going cold. He is still without his sense of smell, can only hope that the obscene amount of the neutralisers have done what he needed them to do.
The leaf between his fingers is slightly scratchy on his skin as he plays with it. There are no buds to be seen on this one -
In the confines of the carriage, Castiel allowed himself to roll his eyes at his friend. All in good nature, of course. He appreciated Balt's easy way of conversation, and the charm he exuded along with his clean Alpha scent provided the companionable effect Castiel needed to feel at ease. "You have always been so outspoken. Let us not allow anyone to overhear your talk of sticks and posteriors in my presence. Lest you'd love a good whip?" Castiel grinned at his friend, resting his head on top of his hand.
The prince’s head is resting on his crossed arms at the edge of the mattress, from this angle looking like he is sitting directly on the floor. His dark eyelashes flutter ever so slightly under Dior’s scrutiny, a slight tremble that is in sync with the movement under his lids. He looks more at ease than Dior has ever seen him; the straight, composed back and attitude he’s gotten used to - gotten to think of as stupidly nice - nowhere to be seen.
His face must be showing his confusion because Dior explains to him that couturiers have a very competitive market so they need the contracts to ensure their designs are protected from being poached.
She gives his hair a sniff then parts their bodies in order to throw him a slightly amused look, “Difficult clients today? I haven’t smelled you this neutral in a very long time.”
Everyone looks around, mirroring him and they all seem surprised to not find the doe-eyed omega amongst them.
The omegas exchange unsure glances, nobody answering him. Before Dior can say something else to ease their worry, the door opens again and Crowley walks right out, past him - not without throwing him a disapproving glower - and straight back to his desk.
With palms braced at the edge of the mattress, Cas’ upper body is dangerously close to his, their faces mere centimeters apart. The omega’s thumb grazes his neck, close to his scent gland and the prince freezes, eyes wide and lips falling open on a breath. Dior’s eyes travel down to the wide, pink lips that have haunted his days and nights and he swallows.
Dior did not leave the Prince’s side until the end of the game, which they had indeed won. The other three alphas laughed.
“That’s right,” Caesar answers and takes a sip of his drink. “I still sew it all myself, of course. The machine is simply able to provide speed along with the quality of my work.”
He thought about the way his retreating form had looked like something out of a painting in the Louvre, all straight lines, bright and full of promise. How his black hair shined blue in the soft light of the candles and seemed to be home to a pair of hands that never ceased their caresses.
“Monsieur Cain- “ Dior started but felt the alpha suddenly bristle next to him, his honeyed scent turning slightly lemon-y. When he turned his head towards him, he was surprised to find him tense and breathing heavily. Afraid he had somehow offended him, he let go of his elbow and was about to apologise but Cain beat him to it.
When he opens the door again, he is hit with the smell of silent contentment rolled inside a layer of sunlight. All he wants to do is inhale breath after breath of this intoxicating aroma and let himself simply
. I'm afraid I'm still very much a bull in a China shop with you sometimes," he laughed, obviously not at all deterred from being jolly. Castiel thanked the heavens for his friend's unending understanding. "We rest today and party like the French tomorrow!"
Dior collected all of the money and jewelry pooled in the middle of the poker table and deposited them in front of Alastair, before dropping himself slowly in his lap, snaking one hand around his shoulder and stroking his jaw whilst looking at the rest of the table. “What do we all say,
The beta nods, taking his leave after, and they remain behind, with only each other and the sound of crackling wood for company.
The young servant gave a bow and a short ‘of course’ before heading off for their drinks. Alastair gave him what was supposed to be a gratified look, maybe, but looked near grotesque on his face. “And they say all prostitutes are stupid. It is good to know you can remember the simplest of things, such as your client’s preferred drink.”
“She’s just ticked off that Dior’s highest-earning again this month. Sore loser, is what she is,” one of the girls comments, not without vitriol. Dior coughs and continues eating.
That raindrops resemble flaming pieces of wood falling off a burning house when the light is shaded warm?
Dumbfounded, Dior places both of his palms on her soft, blonde curls and caresses her softly, “Hey, now. None of that. I’m fine,” he reassures her, placing a kiss at the top of her head and then looks at everyone else. “A migraine. Nothing a lavender bath won’t be able to fix, yeah?”
“I haven’t had the pleasure of seeing it with my own eyes, but from the pictures I’ve been privy to, it looks very impressive,” Dior says, brows furrowed adorably. “I quite liked it.”
“No more than is usual, when in front of a lit fireplace,” Dior says, turning his head towards the fire. “It’s... nice to see someone actually keeping their fireplace in proper use.”
He looks at the omega and knows his expression must be passive, scent guarded - so he is unsure why Dior suddenly looks panicked and shame slips into his scent.
“France and its Royal Family are honoured to welcome Castiel James the First, third Prince of England and His Grace Balthazar Sebastian of the Roché Duchy, arriving as foreign dignitaries, a sign of goodwill between two great Kingdoms.” they heard a servant announce, moments before their door was opened.
to. He needed to feel this - this divinity - or he would most definitely perish, never to be consoled again.
Dean gets behind the stroller without question and the sight of him warms Castiel almost as much as the cuddly baby in his arms.
They turn their gazes onto each other, both sporting what can only be described as stupid grins. The coachman tells them he will be waiting in the designated area for carriages, and the prince is just barely able to acknowledge that piece of information.
The last wisps of pain make themselves unknown quickly after that and another, a final sob escapes Dior’s throat. He wipes at his face quickly with his nightshirt’s sleeves, hoping it does something to clean the mess that his face has most probably become.
His earlier worry and anxiety rear their ugly heads again once he’s been reminded of Lisa’s absence. Where could she have gone? This never happened before - it makes him squirm unpleasantly.
, and had his hands tied behind his back whilst presenting, he let it happen. He also made damn sure to convince the client there was nothing else he’d rather do than take his lacking knot and that he was the next best thing since the invention of the coffee pot.
“I’m going to leave a note on my door, telling anyone who comes knocking to not disturb me until my next appointment,” he tells her. Thankfully, he knows for sure nobody will go against his wishes due to the incident earlier. Silver lining and all that.
The patrons’ attention wasn’t the only one the rickety hinges attracted - the matron at the front looking at him expectantly. The omega makes his way to her quickly, belatedly realising he’s been standing in the door frame for an uncomfortable amount of time.
He listens intently for sounds and keeps his nose in the air to try and form a mental map of where everyone is. He can clearly smell Ruby in her room, and accompanied by the complete silence, he’s almost sure she’s asleep. Once that’s out of the way, he goes down the steps carefully, making sure to avoid the creaky bits of wood, still listening for any of the omegas appearing out of nowhere.
“I used to sneak into my mother’s sleeping chamber and wake her up at dawn,” he says and they stop in front of a statue depicting a sitting adult with three children around him, focused on the book he is holding. Castiel brings his hand to the nearest shrub and starts rubbing one of its leaves free of snow, then continues his way to the nearest one and repeats the process.
Satisfied with his progress, he turned his search to local businesses that they could visit tomorrow and purchase some decorations. It turned out Sioux Falls had quite a few family-owned shops, most of them offering handmade decorations of some sort. He bookmarked a particular one that advertised itself as 100% waste-free.
Lisa covers her still-flat belly protectively, a loving embrace for a human that is yet to come into existence. It tugs at Dior’s whole being, unable to help himself from imagining if
“Because of Crowley?” he asks, remembering their earlier conversation. Irritation takes hold again, his inner wolf growling alongside it.
Both Cas and Jesse turn to look at Dior expectantly, but Dior only appears confused and throws a meaningful glance to Castiel. Understanding dawns on both the alpha and the beta. Jesse looks at Cas and Cas simply shakes his head once.
He took in the house in front of him. It was bigger than the photo made it seem, two stories high and painted olive with off white shutters around the windows. The front yard was colourful even in winter, flower beds planted all around the driveway, and pots lined up on the porch. Christmas lights flickered in warm white and a beautifully decorated tree on the side of the front steps.
Dior bows his head, looking down and away. His hands come undone from where they kept the blanket closed under his chin. Castiel can now see Dior twiddling them nervously in his lap.
At this, Dior shrugs, slightly jostling the alpha’s own shoulder a bit, scent spiking with mild panic, “I could not give you an exact age, I’m afraid. I was left on the steps of the monastery, not as a babe but neither old enough to remember anything. So the nuns erred on the lower side, although I suspect I am eighteen, rather than seventeen.”
He watches himself bring his fist close to his face. He sees fingers open, gooey strands of brown spreading like fish webs between them, lumpy and deformed pieces sitting in the middle of his palm. He regards himself as he brings shaky fingers to the disgusting mess, dragging them, bit by bit, first over his skin and then through the goop.
They spent the rest of the hour chatting about the welcome ball held tomorrow for all the foreigners and other miniscule topics. After Balthazar left and the servants arrived, he allowed them to bathe and clothe him in nightwear whilst his mind wandered over as many possible outcomes for the ball. He needed to be as perfect as possible, even if it meant he had to abandon some of his personality back in his room.
. For you to teach me some more of the games. I am sure my friend would be thrilled to see I am taking initiative to be less of ‘a stick in the mud’”.
It was damn near impossible. He was able to control his scent enough that nobody was able to discern anything different, whilst he still reeled from a deep feeling of rejection. Dior pushed forward, entertained, made some of the guests aware which
. Castiel clutched at his heart willing it to slow down, to give him a reprieve. His knees felt weak, making standing up painful and his balance was off, staggering when he turned around toward exit.
Sam chuckled. “Well, I guess that’s true. So, I’ll take a leap and say you’ve never been here before. Would you like me to give you the rundown of the nursery?”
happen, Dior,” Castiel tells him, slowly, cautiously, brows furrowed with the force of his conviction.
Not having been in this estate before, he had a little trouble navigating it and finding his destination. After what had seemed like the fifth turn, he had finally found a quiet balcony. He let out a relieved sigh and promptly sat down on the bench overviewing the garden. He rubbed tiredly at his eyes. He cannot wait for this to be over so tomorrow he can smuggle himself out again and visit the Notre Dame.
Before he could open his mouth and cause a scene, Balt started talking again. “Well, I am glad to see he is ready to return to his friends. He has done fantastic work with this soirée,” he said. Castiel thanked his friend with a discreet nod for taking control of the situation.
Dior is thankful at that moment that she is a beta because if this is her reaction just seeing Dior, he doesn’t want to know what she’d look like if she could smell him.
His hands tremble where they’re tight around the Prince’s bicep and forearm. His fingers turn pale with the force he presses into hard, straining muscle and thick cashmere.
He stops at the first floor to work through the exhaustion when his arms are unburdened of his load. Chrissie stands next to him, eyebrows furrowed, her beauty mark accentuated.
Dior can only slightly recall the dream he’d had when he passed out from the pain of his migraine. Was it even a dream? A nightmare? He can now recognise the fact that he did have another such thing when this first happened last week in the doctor’s makeshift consultation room.
By the time they’re back at the greenhouse, the night was truly ruling over Sioux Falls. There wasn’t anyone left in the shop and Sam was just turning around the sign that said ‘Closed’.
Castiel didn’t reply, just patted Balt’s shoulder in a friendly gesture. They were getting closer now. He could finally distinguish buildings and other ships in the low lighting and it’d be a lie to say his heart did not start to tremble in anticipation.
He brings his knees up to his chest, the rug coarse on his exposed skin. Dior stretches his arm slowly, fingers caressing the bow’s outward curve, head lowering on his upper arm, eyes not leaving his gift.
TW: Description of radical behaviour/thoughts/opinions in regards to non-normative societal expectations re: sexual attraction/orientation, mentions of underage sex/sex work
If he had been disappointed about anything in regards to his lackluster presentation, it was the fact that his wolf counterpart did not make any sort of appearance during puberty.
The golden-haired man turns his head to look out of the window, contemplating in silence. When he makes up his mind, he turns back to Castiel and says, “The Arc de Triomphe.”
“Your Highness, Prince Castiel, Lord Balthazar has arrived,” their butler announced as he was finishing his tea.
“How are the preparations for your departure to Paris going, Castiel? Is everything in place?” Michael asked him, cutting into a sausage but not looking at him.
When trying to get up, pain blooms in his lower abdomen and travels all the way to his chest. It’s bad enough that he needs to take a second to breathe through it. Just his luck that he would catch a cold right now.
The young man doesn’t turn back, so he’s not aware of the eyes fixed on his back, a head shaking in disbelief whilst a small fistful of coins is stored in a skirt pocket. No - he doesn’t see the warmth he leaves behind.
Coming back to himself feels like slowly breaking the water surface. At first, everything is muffled, but then it all comes back to him quickly. The sweet tang of honey dances with the pleasant aroma of lavender when it hits his nose, allowing him to exhale a relieved sigh.
It smelled of the first snow, of cinnamon confectionaries, and fine aged whiskey. It felt like each scent hit him separately and took the wind out of his lungs, only to return and morph together, wrapping around his skin like the softest blanket. It smelled of
Castiel smiled and cleaned him up with a wet wipe. “How is even your drool cute? It should be disgusting.” he mused, stroking Jack’s cheek minutely.
“Been at it for the better part of a decade. ‘M pretty proud.” He says, raising one shoulder in a noncommittal shrug but appearing pleased with the compliment. “So, any idea what we’re looking for? We’ve got spruce, pine, yew, cedar, and fir.”
“Hey, hey, buddy. What the fuck do you think you’re-” Dior says, face twisted in a disgusted scowl, emerald turning into grey pools of contempt, eye bags accentuated by the harsh light.
Castiel exhales a shuddering breath and has to look ahead - anywhere but his baby and the gentleman at his side. He wills his eyes to stop burning. “Yes,” he says, simply.
Thankfully, his paranoia is wrong and Lisa is still in the bath, skin closer to her normal olive rather than purple. Standing in the doorway, he sniffs the room and hallway, pleased to find that he can only smell himself and the lavender. This should allow them to talk without Crowley sniffing her out and coming to find her.
Jesse, places his half-eaten biscuit harshly on the platter and it clatters between the saucers before finally settling, “
As far as I could find, hematology in our world only started to be a thing in the mid 19th century but I think in a world where blood bonds/mating, rejection/pining sickness etc. existed because of those bonds, they’d start taking an interest in it a bit earlier. I also have close to no knowledge about blood so I’m basically making it up as I go. If you were hoping for scientific accuracy… You’re not going to find it here, lol.
it? Why does he insist on entangling himself with a prostitute like him when they’re a dime a dozen throughout Paris? Dior’s trying so fucking hard to keep him whole and he’s just-
With another curtsey, Hannah left Castiel on his own so she could make way to his private bathroom and start whatever concoction she did that procured the most amazing of baths. He lit his fireplace quickly and with ease, having done this many a time before, to his family’s chagrin. He did not allow himself a lot of freedom, but he craved not feeling like a glass bird in one of his mother’s greenhouses. Castiel watched the flames get substantially bigger for a minute before heading to his desk and sitting down. He had been up late last night wrapping up any of his outstanding responsibilities before his leave in a week. Thankfully, not a lot remained to be done, yet he wished to have them all filed and ready to go either tonight or tomorrow.
When his door opens without a single knock, he’s half laying on his sofa, body sinking into the cushions after a seemingly never-ending stream of clients. A tall, cloaked figure steps in, heels clicking loudly.
“I’m not a kid,” he replies reflexively. It’s been a while since he’s stopped thinking of himself as one. “But, thank you. I’m glad I was able to sell everything.”
“No - nothing of the sort. Jack’s getting into the phase of putting everything in his mouth and he’s going to start crawling soon,” he says, this time confident in his answer.
The alpha knows he must be staring. But it is barely a whisper at the back of his head, a ghost of a thought when all he can hear, all he can
Castiel gave his footman a smile in approval and asked for his help in getting dressed. He knew the poor man would appreciate it, not having his Prince turn his help away.
“My name is Jesse. I’m Caesar’s husband,” The beta says, leading them to the other side of the room where a fire roars brightly and invitingly in the fireplace, right across a lovely sofa set. The closer they get, the warmer it feels.
He slips impossibly close to the omega, thigh to thigh, shoulder to shoulder, soul to soul - and he reaches out to cup Dior’s face and gently raises it so he is, once again, looking the prince levelly.
The pleasant burn that ignites in his chest barely has time to take a single breath before it is snuffed out by Dior. “I’m not - we’re not-” he tries, prying his finger away from Cas’ quick enough to leave an unpleasant friction behind. “I am unspoken for.”
,” he says, voice raised and sharp, canines close to peeking through his downturned lips. “I will be retiring - I seem to have become unwell. It smells quite terrible in here.”
Courtesan - a prostitute with a courtly, wealthy, or upper-class clientele. Could also be 'kept women/men' away from the main household
“After we are finished in the library, I thought we might enjoy today by visiting the Louvre. It has been a while since I have been,” the alpha said.
sent out to do chores like this - especially grocery shopping. His inner wolf is already pacing, the chant of
Dior looks away, “They’re also highly useful medicinal plants… I-I liked that. Beautiful but also… not just for watch or show.”
He watches a full month’s supply of herbs disperse in the bath, some sinking to the bottom, some floating on the surface, mind going blank when he can no longer feel his toes curling on the wooden floors. He stands up on shaky legs, opening his robe and letting it fall to the floor before he lowers himself in the sizzling water.
Castiel had whispered in the heady comfort of the carriage. His eyes shimmered, cutting through everything Dior had ever built up around himself to keep people out. The prince had spoken beautiful words upon beautiful words and what was Dior to do except
There is nothing wrong with his scent; it smells as clean and wonderful as it usually is, yet Castiel cannot help but feel like there is something inherently
Castiel quickly finished off the sentence he was writing and rose from his chair. He disposed of his nightshirt quickly, letting it fall next to his bath, and lowered himself slowly in the hot and misty water. When finally submerged up to his neck, a sigh escaped his lips. He felt most human in the bath. He allowed his mind to slow down and focus on the way the warmth enclosed him, the way the water rippled when he moved and watched the steam rise unperturbed from the water’s top. After what he considered an appropriate amount of time of soaking, Castiel picked up the soap and cloth that was left for him. He lathered it up, only slightly bothered that no fragrance accompanied the suds.
. He can feel it in the tightness of the ropes, in the slow movements of her silver butterfly knife, in the way there is no longer any reprieve from the whip on his soles. In the way the sweetness of liquorice gets disgusting in her arousal.
His fingers stop their attentions, only to continue their explorations, this time retracting their steps upward, over and around his thighs, slowing over the crevice of his groin and jut of his hip. His alpha’s pulse quickens, scent swirling and swirling until it’s a mess of sweet, sweet honey. The digits dip carefully, almost - respectfully, in the crevice between his legs and upper body created by Dior's position. They caress back and forth, each brush as electric as lighting.
. Castiel fiercely wished that his French would sound exactly like that by the time they had to go home.
Castiel unwinds the omega’s arms from around him only to immediately take hold of his hand - not wishing to break contact for too long - and helps him climb inside. The bench bounces slightly when Dior sits on it and the man shoots Castiel a slightly bewildered look.
refused Royalty unless they had a death wish. That night - and every night she had come since then - he had wondered whether death would be so bad, worse than the burning pains and humiliation.
Castiel feels like grinning and laughing at the sheer delightfulness of the interaction. However, he feels the other man might not be appreciative of such a display. “Yes, being a - a single dad is hard. But very rewarding.” he settles on, looking down at Jack, whose eyes are now closed but still suckling gently on the bottle. “He makes it easy.”
“O-oh, oh fuck,” he hears himself gasp. Pain starts pinging on every centimeter of him - so many different types of misery. It burns and it stabs and it clenches and it grinds.
Dior wants to go over as soon as he hears the whine but he can’t. He’s got to figure out what to do. He can’t let her do this to herself.
“Maybe they’ve retired for the night -” Dior says but is interrupted by the brusque opening of the wooden door.
The carriage is turned toward a road that is much less illuminated and uneven, immediately feeling the difference in movement, despite the carriage’s bountiful padding. Weirdly fascinated with what appears to be more activity than even the main road, Castiel does not tear his eyes away from the window, palm still mindlessly patting the blanket.
“Balthazar! Goodness, reign in your cheekiness, please,” Castiel groaned, heading to sit in one of the armchairs near the fireplace. “You cannot speak such thoughts out loud. What if anybody hears you?”
Castiel can agree with that as simple fact, however he is quick to fill in the man’s incomplete statistics, “The increase has not been drastic enough to demand much attention from authorities. The numbers are also unreliable since they are compared to alpha-omega matings and alpha-beta marriages which have, of course, decreased with the alpha population,” he offers.
What was far from being acceptable, however, was how Dior was adamant about refusing any and all compliments, regardless of which part of himself they were about. Castiel prided himself on being a man of great patience - but, apparently, not when it came to Dior being intent on criticising himself with no basis.
But now? He hadn’t thought he’d ever be out, except under a piece of white cloth. He wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but anxiety and fear were an unexpected outcome.
“I-I don’t suppose I can counteract that but - but I am, at the very least, n-not hypothermic,” Dior attempts to convince the alpha once again.
“Charlie, good morning. How are you this morning?” He asked, both of them continuing their way to the elevator.
,” Caesar confirms before he has a chance to finish his sentence and Castiel squints his eyes before continuing.
This is fucking ridiculous. He hasn’t had such a severe cold in his life, not even in the months he was begging on the streets and living in the alleyways. It feels like a punishment from God if the asshole even existed. The clench in his stomach is getting bad enough he’s seriously considering asking Crowley for some digestive tablets when he arrives this morning.
His fingers twitch. Making up his mind, he sits up straight, puts the box back on the table and carefully undoes the bow. It comes apart smoothly, like water flowing from a jug and pooling elegantly around the box. Dior opens the lid before he can change his mind.
The alpha is left in the room on his own, the crowded space suddenly seeming so much bigger, the quiet much heavier. He moves to the side of the sofa where he is in easy reach of the scarf he took off Dior. His fingers start caressing the material, with each passing brush the urge to lift it and keep it close to his chest growing stronger.
“As fun as that was, I’m afraid I must return to the main ballroom now.” the Crown Princess said, getting up and nodding briefly in their direction.
His musings are cut short by Jesse straightening and grabbing his own, refilled cup and encouraging Cas to do the same.
“I still do. We were true mates. This type of loss never leaves you and it doesn’t get better with time, either. Most of the time I feel like I’m just wasting away more and more each day I am without her.” Cain said.
Dior maps out the bottom floor’s outline in his mind, being able to clearly imagine the sash window. Opening it from the outside shouldn’t be possible- unless, of course, you unlock it from the inside first. A small surge of pride at his friend’s sneakiness makes its way into his heart and he gives Lisa a shit-eating grin. She smiles back bashfully.
“Oh, nothing to worry about. I’ve had a couple this week and the physician thought the lavender baths might help.”
“Goodness me, Your Highness! I came as soon as the servants left me. I was worried about your virtue!” he exclaimed.
feels the small breaths on his skin and how they travel halfway down the side of his jaw, only to retract back under his ear and start the slowest descent known to man toward-
Castiel knows the real reason he was sent on this voyage that was due to last from the first signs of winter until the very beginning of spring. Of course, being part of the diplomatic representatives sent as a sign of continued peace and goodwill between the countries of The Great Powers was a grand honour. Castiel, however, knew it could've been very well done by Balthazar on his own since in the eyes of the world, he was a close protégé of the Royals, highly valued in court and personal affinities. It had been his father's idea for Castiel to accompany him, and no matter that he had never voiced concerns in regards to his son's shortcomings, Castiel knew it was an attempt to fix a problem in a new way. Castiel just wasn't sure in what way, exactly. Regardless, he was elated to be included, his heart leaping at the opportunities for cultural assimilation. He might be a good little soldier for his family in a way, but he held art, religion, and many other subdued interests dear to his heart. Hobbies and interests that he had not been able to nurture to the extent of his wishes.
It doesn’t feel like a dream. They feel as real as the warmth under the blanket, as real as the alpha sitting on the floor of what has to be an inn or hotel, like he’s not a prince that could probably buy at least fifty of these establishments.
The world dissolves from a blurry mess, becoming a swirl of colours and nothing more. No shapes, no lights, no structure.
Castiel pulled at his collar, uncomfortable. “Must I have worn this colour, Balt? I fear it might be too cheery for the Parisian trend right now. Everyone else appears to have donned dark colours.” He looked down at himself again, hoping to see the cornflower blue suit having changed into something more inconspicuous.
“What do you think, Cas?” the omega asks, a tentative curve to his lips, slightly slanted on the side as if a smirk would like to take form.
It’s subtle. So subtle that unless you’d know exactly what the omega smells like, you wouldn’t be able to catch it. But Dior
He gets dressed in some of his house clothing, not wanting his better clothes to smell of food when he does start work, and heads back down to the kitchen. There he finds Lisa, one of the women on the second floor - a pretty thing with soft brown hair and doe eyes - finishing up the egg and milk mixture.
“Thank you,” he whispers instead, their gazes caught in each other, bodies close enough that he will soon be able to feel the other man’s heat, once it gets warm enough. It pains him to remind himself the wonderful person in front of him is not
It did not take long for Meg to find her way to Castiel’s side, much too close for his comfort. He could smell an almost overbearing aroma of jasmine. He grabbed another drink off a waiter’s tray and drank half of the amount in one go.
He chooses an attractive burgundy attire that is comfortable to move around in and won’t stand out too much. Cain didn’t like being the center of attention and that was fine by him. He preferred blending in. He put the small knife that the alpha gifted him on a thin fabric strap around his ankle, under his trousers.
“I know you’re only doing your job, of course, but it is highly unpleasant,” he says, going for a light tone but falling short.
Those absolutely heavenly, vibrating notes start for the second time tonight. Only this time he is feeling it directly against the sensitive skin of his neck. Feeling every single purr start and stop seamlessly into the next one.
“His Highness, Third Alpha Prince of England, Castiel James the First and His Grace, Alpha Lord Balthazar of the Roché Duchy,” the butler nearly yelled.
It was hard to enjoy one’s self when the company was nothing short of mortifying. Their speech was polite and formal, and yet their ideals and opinions were nothing if not ancient and repulsive. He had been under the impression the Great Powers had been united in a joint effort to evolve into more progressive societies, try to be more understanding towards the less fortunate and anything in between that was supposed to be
? The chocolate is sweeter than any he’s ever tasted, possibly related to the lighter colour. Closing his eyes is automatic and he moans softly around the treat in his mouth. He lets it melt on his tongue instead of chewing on it, the flavour only intensifying with each passing moment.
At this Castiel can feel his eyes widen slightly. That seems like an awfully long time and neither of the men looks over thirty. He tells the beta as much.
pooling into his blood, pulsing with every heartbeat. The touches were innocent enough - Dior being used to a lot more - but he was still surprised to feel his arousal build up, aware he should be afraid of what could happen if slick started slipping in his undergarments and yet not finding it in himself to care.
What he does not expect is the way Dior takes a quick step toward him, only to abruptly stop himself, an almost imperceptible shake to his whole body. The grip around the scarf is now white, cinnamon and pecan turns so sugary Castiel is reminded of pastries.
Castiel’s muscles decompress, his heartbeat renews - but slower, so much slower. It feels as though his body is getting ready for sleep. It does not take him long to realise it is because Dior is, quite literally, manipulating his own scent to calm him down, soothe him.
“I-I did not realise the French were so open about…” Castiel tried talking again but found he could not finish his sentence.
Dior clasps his hands together tightly and heaves a heavy sigh, still looking away, “Not in my experience.”
He should not be feeling so anxious - Dior is merely a few meters away and Cas can hear his and Caesar’s voices coming faintly through the closed door. And yet…  his heart is still beating irregularly, fingers fidgeting on the fabric.
“Whenever you call for me, I will come,” Castiel replies, conviction and reverence woven in each letter.
’ by bringing his cup to his lips and avoiding everyone’s eyes. Cas returns his attention back to the couturier and resumes their conversation, not wanting to make him uncomfortable.
Raindrops are fleeting, quick to disappear once you’ve caught sight of them. But they sparkle like translucent gems when light hits them right.
as a source of comfort and safety filled his body with warmth, and chest swell with pride.  Parenthood wasn’t easy and it was definitely something he thought he didn’t want. Yet here he was, an armful of dozing baby and thinking there’s nowhere he’d rather be.
Every time the alpha growls, his body moves forward, pushing his shoulder further between Dior’s ribcage, against his sternum. It feels as if Castiel is trying to climb inside, despite his focus being on the alpha-beta pair in front of them.
Please, take a seat. Have you eaten yet?” Cain greeted and Dior took the chair at his right, as close as possible to the man. He took a subtle sniff of the alpha’s faint honeyed scent.
They stare at each other, unmoving, unrelenting, both of them stubborn. Dior’s eye catches her other hand moving underwater, upwards from her thighs to her stomach where she stops.
Castiel had wanted to wince at the attention but waited for the guests to dip in short bows and curtsies before making their way down the stairs and into the main room.
It’s been years since he’s been to a market of any sort, but he passes them by regularly whilst in clients’ carriages. With a vague idea of where he needs to go, Dior keeps a steady pace and burrows his face into his coat lapels, the wind chipping at his face, turning his skin pink. He jostles the bag higher up on his shoulder and shoves his hands inside his pockets in an attempt to keep his fingers from locking up.
“Thank you, and - I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt,” the omega says, freckles back on display, curtain of pink behind them.
“There has been a recent increase in beta marriages following the war - an unfortunate side-effect to the decrease in alpha-population,” he starts, “which has, in turn, multiplied primary-gender incidents among the masses.”
“Brilliant. We are looking for a full winter outfit,” the prince says and he can see Dior turning his head sharply in his periphery. “A three-piece suit, coat and winter accessories - to take away right now.”
He turned his head to the flower shop. The light of dusk was hitting the pane glass of the greenhouse, warm shades of yellow, orange, and red dancing around in the reflection. Castiel could see the plants inside standing proudly behind the windows, all sort of signs scattered at the front, promoting other businesses or informing people of deals. He could faintly hear chatter coming from inside but not much else. It was all very quaint.
Dior chuckles whilst making his way into the prince’s personal space only to start undoing his buttons as if it’s the most natural thing, and not currently causing his brain to stutter. His scent must be doing something because Dior’s cheeks tint pink and throws him a playful glance. “Is this permitted?” he asks, “Undoing your coat - I mean.”
"Ah, yes. You know just what to say to get me going, dearest." Balthazar laughed, throwing his head back. "I might have to abandon you once in a while whilst I… Ah,
He leaves the building, strides long. There’s intense staring following, boring into him like arrows in an unmoving target. He clenches one fist around the handful of sweets and one fist around the key. There’s no more dangerous drumming in his ears and there are no more roots winding around his bones, but there’s shadows swimming in his bloodstream and new cracks on top of old ones.
“I have only seen it in bloom once - I had not realised it flowered, until then. The owner told me they rarely ever bloom i-inside - that they need special care and conditions to b-bloom,” he stops for a second before he adds, “He also said they’re worth it.”
Once Castiel was sure Jack was deep in slumber, he turned his laptop on and opened the email he had sent earlier. He booked a Santa visit here - a petting zoo slot there - along with a couple of other outdoor activities that seemed infant appropriate.
“I can’t deny that. But I am still fine. Besides…” he trails off, taking his other hand out of the muff and cradles it loosely in front of him.
The shadow flickers once he’s alone. It gets bigger, imposing. Or that might be himself, he’s still not sure.
He chuckles feebly, his own hand clutching to his belly this time, fingers a relieving pressure on his innards, “I don’t think someone breaking their legs is wonderful.”
Dean is looking at him now, a pleased expression on his face. “You’ve come to the right place, then. Let’s show you two around and I’ll see if I can help.”
Later that afternoon, he had arrived back at the palace via a private carriage, since he had missed the servants’ one on its way back. He had sat down on a public bench, lost to the world. By the time he truly came to, the sun had started its descent and he knew he had to go back before Balthazar split open from worry and confessed everything to the King, demanding a search party.
on his arms. Dior stares at his upper limbs a bit longer before he continues his bath. Maybe he’s just getting to an age where his omega biology isn’t strong enough to keep body hair at bay anymore. He doesn’t mind - sure, he’ll have to spend more time shaving but what can he do?
Sorry for the delay - I meant to upload this last week but my beta has been going through some stuff irl so I had to find someone else to do this ch so as to give her a breather! All my gratitude and appreciation to JayRae1996 for coming through for me!!
. It is a struggle to not bodily react to this jarring change - from spring sunshine and baked confectionaries to - to muddy, stale water and rancid nuts. Castiel wants to gather him up in his arms and blanket him in his own scent - anything to make him stop smelling like
“Have faith, Lucius. I am certain Gabriel will settle down as soon as he mates and marries.” Michael added.
“No need to be worried - Caesar doesn’t bite, I promise,” Jesse says, returning through the door he left.
Castiel could feel himself bristling at the words, anger trickling up his neck. The impertinence and coarseness of the older alpha were unbelievable. Insulting not only their host in his own home but also attacking his late mate, whom he seemed to have loved immensely. Alastair was the type of alpha the Prince hated most and he has had just about enough of letting them get away with their attitude.
“Uh, no - no! It wasn’t. I’m sorry, I’m a big flirt, everyone keeps telling me. These things just come out of my big mouth. You’ve got a kid and I definitely did not mean to offend. I’m sorry -” Dean rambles, his palm at the back of his neck and his face definitely rosier in colour than it should be.
. I give you my word that I will bring you back to finish touring the Louvre, but I am afraid we must go now. It is getting late and I need to have you back to the
He feels his robe slip free off his shoulders, a loud litany of whimpers falling from between his lips at the cold air licking his wounds.
“How are you feeling today, my dearest Anna?” King Charles, their father, asked his youngest. Affection and love practically rolled off his father’s scent at the moment, looking at Anna with an expression to match his scent.
Dior chances a peek from the corner of his eye and is intrigued to find the alpha’s face bordering on red.
Dior looks affronted, “They are a sign of bad luck. They only grow in cemeteries during winter, for God’s sake!”
Castiel is focused on the way his fork pierces the piece of pork and how smoothly the gleamingly sharp knife slides through it. His attention is not fully on the conversations going on around him - it feels as if they have been running around in circles. It is not news that these are to be the topics today; they had been the same yesterday, the day before yesterday
“You’ve heard him - stop your blubbering. He’ll be fine,” the alpha says convincingly and flippantly enough that some of the tension in the room eases, “Aiden, go. Dr. Sunders is waiting.”
“And why not?” The prince asks, bringing blue back to green, brows furrowed and tone petulant. Why can he not express devotion to he who deserves it?
Ah. He knew this as fact so he deserves this humiliation. The slick that started forming between his cheeks is no longer a pleasant rub, but a grating reminder that even after all this time, he still has not learned his damn place.
The beta and alpha look at each other and release him at the same time, not appearing happy at all with the situation. Dior can’t blame them - he’s unsure how long he’s spent on the floor but the doctor must be frustrated to be kept back by a troublesome whore, as probably is Crowley, seeing as he’s paying her a small fortune already.
Castiel takes both of the omega’s slender wrists in one hand - horrified to see that his index and thumb are close to making a neat, uninterrupted circle around them. Had Dior always been so thin? Keeping hold of them gently in one palm, he uses his front teeth to bite down on the end of a gloved finger, swiftly taking it off and promptly sliding it on one beautiful hand. Again - the glove is big and loose around it.
Castiel looked around the lavishly decorated hall. It was a magnificent room, flower arrangements exuding luxury without being tasteless, soft runners in seasonal colours, candles and lamps assorted throughout, creating an inviting hue. He took a perfunctory sniff and was impressed to find that the whole area smelled deliciously of cinnamon.
He sniffs only to realise - to his horror - that there’s mucus dripping from his nose down his lips all the way to his chin. He catches a whiff of alpha musk and whips his head around to his other side, surprised to be met with the
“No, It’s very pleasant in here,” Dior replies, demeanor softening, turning slightly to face Cas better.
As if he’s never been home. As if he suddenly knew what a true home feels like and his heart threatens to barrage out of his ribcage in revenge for denying it this feeling for the last twenty-four years of his life.
“I’m afraid a prostitute’s time is not filled with much else except - well, my job,” the omega says. Castiel would be a liar to say the wording does not take him aback - but he would be a completely special sort of fool if he tried to deny it to Dior.
“Yes,” he replies, not telling Dior that his mother no longer calls him ‘Cassie’, stopped inviting him to share an afternoon tea or that he never sees her hair down anymore.
They all turned their gaze to the side - except Dior, as the Princess still had him in a death hold - when someone cleared their throat loudly, obviously meant to attract their attention. He didn’t need to see who it was, for the scent was enough to make him want to whine out loud. His relief was tangible as the smell of honey washed over his whole being, coating his dread and smoothing it over in absolute sanctuary. There was a twang to the musky, old book smell now, a deep layer of mold entwining with it. It should’ve made Dior afraid since such a scent change meant the alpha was annoyed at best and angry at worst. Instead, he felt overjoyed that the alpha cared enough to exhibit this behaviour for his sake.
Cain is our business partner. We have worked together for many years,” Uriel says. While his tone might indicate that they are quite close to the host, Castiel had a feeling it was very much one-sided.
To stay and never leave. To drown himself in gold and bronze and come up weightless. He wants to bury himself in-between bones, carve himself like a seal, grow roots and become a dandelion and a bee both - to heal, to balm, to give and give
“You may all stand,” Crown Princess Abbadon demanded, and so they all did. “Do not let our presence keep you from enjoying the festivities. My sisters and I are here to show our support in our father - your King’s - stead to Grand Duke Cain.”
The prince thinks of all the conversations they have had today and the other times they have met - he thinks of how everything Dior does sets him apart is as sure as a rule of the universe. Everything he does is unique, solely because it is done by him. He is desperate to prove it to him, and asks the first thing that comes to mind - the one his instincts are shouting at him as the right one:
? Castiel could barely talk about undoing his corset, of course he wouldn’t want to fuck him. What is
“Really? I have never been, but I have wanted to for as long as I can remember!” he replied, elated. He has seen the building from the outside plenty of times, and every time he was taken aback by its aesthetic. He had envied the people who were able to go inside and enjoy their time admiring the art. Dior didn’t know a whole lot about art but he was very interested in learning more about it. He craved knowledge, which was silly, really. An escort doesn’t need to be smart, they just need to be entertaining.
Castiel rolls his eyes and resumes walking, leaving Balt to sprint after him. “That would be close to a miracle. It is much more probable for Gabe to have finally let his antics reach a new level of recklessness,” he says.
Oddly enough - or, not really - thinking about the devotion in the alpha’s voice when whispering sweet nothings (not nothings, Cas is always so serious), his stomach unclenches from its death grip. Dior could weep in relief.
- was settled and happy as anything. He probably would’ve let Castiel put him to bed in his nursery and not kick a fuss up.
He’s never had hair grow on his arms. There’s been very light fluff growing on his legs which he gets rid of as soon as it starts reappearing - but
“It’s proper nippy out here!” Balthazar exclaims, rubbing his arms in an exaggerated gesture. “Your face is incredibly red already!”
“Liar!” Dior whisper-yells, tugging on his arm more forcefully than earlier, both of their bodies swaying perilously to the side. “What was that, then? Sounded like a laugh a
He thought about him as the night went on. He imagined his beautiful smile and kind eyes as patrons continued to poke and prod him. He recounted the way he smelled, the way it took a moldy tinge when distressed.
weird. Light fluff on his arms he can understand, but just what the fuck is going on with his legs? The situation that he’s got going on over here is nothing he’s ever dealt with himself
. Neither Caesar nor I wanted to live with those regrets,” he says, his smile slipping into a relaxed line, not quite frowning. “Our marriage is something we fought for. Something I would lay my life down for.”
“However, it appears being awarded these countless privileges has made them reckless and, dare I say…
One of the brown-haired alphas from Austria speaks next, “And what would that be? I thought the list was quite exhaustive, which will most certainly prolong the initial time estimates,” he says, tone leveled. Castiel likes this particular lad - he is not as conservative as most of the people in the room and more prone to intelligent conversation than, as Balt so eloquently puts it, to "piss fights".
Dior felt smothered between the two alphas and Uriel’s gaze - which looked ready to take a red tinge at this display. He wanted to say something, anything, but the pheromones the three of them were throwing around made him stay quiet, the inner wolf instructing him this was a power display and he needed to
Yet, he can’t find it in himself to care. He turns on his heel and makes his way out of the room as Princess Margot yells after him “Castiel!”, but he does not turn around.
The prince looks over everyone at the table and they’re staring right back at him, some are annoyed, but most seem surprised - as if Castiel is in the wrong here for becoming disquieted.
“Castiel. Nice to meet you, Dean.” Castiel replies. Once his brain catches up with the information given to him and he adds, “Winchester? Are you and Sam the owners?”
After all four cups are poured and served, they all sit back down. Castiel is quick to cover Dior’s legs with the discarded blanket and is rewarded with a grateful smile that warms him all over.
Dior couldn’t hide his excitement. He could never afford books and there was never any time to visit a library. A book would be a fucking awesome thing to have and he wasn’t about to say no. “You are too kind, Monsieur Cain. It would make me very happy to accept any you would like to give me. Maybe just… nothing too complicated to start with,” Dior meekly replied. He knew how to read, sure. But he wasn’t about to start with a philosophical book, the likes of which he knew Cain enjoyed. He did not have a very big vocabulary and he’d hate to embarrass himself by biting off more than he could chew. Sure, he had picked up lots of fancy words from his noble clients, but not nearly enough for heavy reading.
“For nothing - I barely needed to alter it,” Caesar replies and snakes an arm around his husband’s waist when he moves closer, as natural as the air they breathe. “I’m happy you like it. Will you be taking it, then?”
Disturbed at Dior being referred to as some sort of object to be ‘kept’, Castiel is curt, bordering on rude when replying, “Of course.”
Dior wanted to scream. He did not want any of them anywhere near his scent gland, lest they mark him and he ends up with their vile scents lingering for days.
With a nod, his hand is enclasped into the omega’s and brought to the fabric across his chest. He sinks his fingers in, admiring the softness and plushness of the fur - it really is so much more supple than the rabbit one.
“Yes, she’s finishing up the dishes,” she tells him, arms crossed over her bosom with a motherly ire.
When Castiel returns inside the carriage, Dior is still shivering, but has, at the very least, found his voice again.
Castiel takes his pocket watch out and feels his heart squeeze when he realises Dior needs to be back at the
It’s only a second before he realises who this person is, why they smell like heaven and why the ache in his soul was swapped for physical agony.
Castiel turns to him almost sharply, eyebrows slanted in disapproval, “Absolutely not.”. And just to prove how serious he is to the omega he- “We’re taking this. I trust you have his measurements now?”
They were halfway through their mains when Cain opened a surprising topic. “Next week, I will be holding a soirée at my estate.”
When it does, he feels his breath catch, his muscles going tight and heart picking up speed at the image in front of him.
“Let me help,” he whispers low, affectionately. “Tell me what you need - be it money or something else. Please, let me help, Dior.”
Balthazar kicks a little mound of snow, making Castiel chuckle, “You would reckon you have learned your lesson by now. Remember when you broke three of your toes?” he asks.
seeing as each of his daughters had a different primary gender. Abbadon was an alpha, Lilith a beta and Margot an omega. Castiel knew that just like England, the only people allowed to inherit the throne were alphas. So, Abbadon was the only Crown Princess. For now.
Castiel kept chanting to himself whilst holding a conversation with other foreign dignitaries. Right now, he found himself alone in a group consisting of the Russian and Prussian representatives, Balthazar having disappeared a while ago.
Dior gulped. That was indeed a lot of the French nobility. He was nervous and felt compelled to share this with Cain. “I am afraid my etiquette might be inappropriate. I don't have any formal training for either social etiquette or dancing. I would loathe to embarrass you in your own home.”
It takes an almost embarrassingly long time for Dior to eat another piece, barely convincing himself that he can’t, in fact, keep the chocolates much longer. They are perishable after all. Technically, he’s breaking rules by eating them and hiding their existence from Crowley. The bawd strictly forbade any consumption of gifted liquid and food, a precautionary action to make sure none of the omegas gets poisoned.
A smirk fights its way onto the doc’s usually-stoic face. “Are you, perhaps, glad I didn’t assault your genitals first this time?”
Castiel thinks of the early morning meeting they had decided on this afternoon. He cannot deny sleep much longer if he wishes to be functional and prepared.
Lisa is back quickly and places a small book in his palms. He blinks the haziness away and reads the English title.
It wasn’t long before the parlour was brimming with alphas, their scents potent under a ridiculous amount of perfume. Dior had to stop himself from coughing in their faces, the smell so strong it made his nose itch and his throat constrict in an attempt to protect his lungs from the horrible stench. It had gotten to the point where he could taste them on the back of his tongue. He had almost gagged whilst hosting a game of poker - his speciality - and decided it was time for a fucking break.
Castiel said his goodbye to Sam and followed Dean to the backdoor. They exited the greenhouse after Dean put on a beanie and scarf and Castiel made sure Jack is bundled up properly and his rain cover is on.
If innards could relocate, Dior would swears his just did, finding a new home in his feet. Dread surges and freezes him to the spot. The bag is weightless, all of his possessions now gone, yet its burden is great on his shoulder. In comparison, the new, barely there load in his pocket seems insignificant now when earlier it felt like it could lead and fly him over shattered expectations.
The throbbing in his abdomen mellows out slightly, a smile creeping on his face. These are good kids. And so, seeing them try in their own way to take care of him fills his heart with pride.
He had woken up, taken care of breakfast and the communal bath, then washed himself with plain soap. He’d put on his best suit, made sure his hair was perfect and then anxiously waited for
At the end, as they all exchanged goodbyes, Castiel noticed Princess Margot’s gaze lingered on him longer than necessary, a smile permanently on her lips. He wished they hadn’t worn so many perfumes. Being unable to scent the mood in the room was majorly inconveniencing.
The prince flushes even deeper and the other alpha frowns at him suspiciously. “Yes - quite cold,” Castiel coughs and does not face his friend.
Dior does not reply, seemingly concentrated on becoming aware of his breathing and state of wakefulness. The moment he comes to the conclusion that Castiel is not wrong, he shuts his eyes and groans.
There is a pitiful whine echoing in his ears when he pulls their bodies apart. Dior thinks it’s him at first, because he somehow always ends up being pathetic in the devastating man’s presence. However, he is both horrified and weirdly pleased - which, in turn, makes him horrified at himself - to find out it’s actually the alpha, who does it once more.
. Tears pool in his eyes and start running down his face without preamble, big drops falling onto the wooden floors. He gasps and gasps trying to oxygenate - he can’t take it.
His room was nice and toasty on his return. He gets his bath ready - foregoing the scent enhancing herbs today - and lays everything out neatly next to the tub. When he lowers himself in the water he winces. One of his regulars came yesterday and she ended up being more aggressive than usual. He could refuse her, of course, but a few cuts and grazes are worth it since she always pays more than his rate and hell will freeze over before he goes back to the second floor. So today he scrubs gentler than he has in a long time, making sure to clean the wounds carefully, an infection being the last thing he needs.
He knots his belt with more force than strictly necessary, walking towards the door. With his hand on the knob, he turns towards the other two and throws them his perfected smile, the one that never fails to relax even the more aggravated alphas.
The other man threads his hands reverently through the fur, marvelling at its thickness. He tugs the fabric over his waist and halfway up his abdomen, holding it close to his body from underneath.
Castiel has to think about it for a second before he replies. He wonders how much of his family’s details he ought to share with outsiders. It is a thought that saddens him because, reckless as it might be, he trusts this man blindly and faithfully. The last thing he wants is for anyone to find out Castiel has shared confidential details with him and get him accused of espionage.
The woman makes some short calculations on the border of her page and taps the graphite of the pencil once before she says “That’ll be a total of ten francs, sweetheart. Seven for the board and three for food.”
“Please, do follow us Your Highness, Your Grace.” the youngest princess, Margot, said. She was the petite one amongst the sisters, her face the homeliest of the three. She had chocolate brown hair that was fashionably up in tight curls around the base of her neck, framing her features in such a way that she appeared the perfect image of the cherub angel French artists seemed so fond of.
“Being cute gets you asshole privileges,” Dean replies, still very much beet red but at least in better faculty of his words.
As Cas manages to pry his legs open from his waist, unwind his arms from around his neck and settles him on his chest, no pressure on Dior’s back, he thinks-
Suddenly, sunshine blooms in the carriage, the force of it big enough to carve a hole the size of the Notre Dame in Cas’ chest and fill it with greenery.
“You will come visit me again?” Dior clarifies, turning away from the building and fixing the prince with unwavering pools of molten hope.
“We were just happy to hear she gets to go to the market. W-we made her promise to come back with interesting stories,” one of the younger girls says, Marjorie, voice meek as if she was in the wrong to be excited about being told a story of the outside world.
The prince starts to feel out of his depth - he had never flirted with anyone before. What is the proper step to take next? Does he flirt back?
“I would like to give you some books, then. As you know, I prefer the company of words more than people and I would quite like to have someone to talk to about them that isn’t myself,” the alpha continued.
He’s never been to the ocean, although he’s been told stories and read stories himself. He’s imagined it as steady, calm, always poised - because that’s what he’s been conditioned to.
His eyes are wide open, flicking around his room from where he’s settling for whatever is planned for him. There’s a twitch he thinks might be the tip of his fingers over his knee but Dior doesn’t know where his knee is anymore. Was it connected to his thigh or to his tibia? Both?
“Of course. We will go to my library and you can have a look around and choose a few you like the look of,” Cain said.
doctor prescribed them to me because of my migraines,” Dior rants, seemingly going through a mental checklist.
Where should he start? The accessories would be better off being pawned, but it’s better to leave that last. It’s the other items he needs to get rid of quickly. He scans the crowd for an empty spot where he can lay out his wares, head bobbing each and every way, trying to scan the crowd whilst keeping out of anyone’s way. The last thing he needs is an alpha to accost him in the middle of the day.
Dior excused himself and hurried out of the room, asking one of the servants to keep an eye on the table for him. The fresh air out in the hallway was a damn blessing. He could finally breathe again. He dared a look at his pocket watch and realised he’d already been at it for a few hours. No wonder he was getting grumpy. He took the opportunity to use the lavatory and then made his way further away from the private chamber.
Only five minutes into their drive back, the driver stops and knocks twice before opening the little door connecting his seat and the inside of the carriage.
He also thinks that this debilitating, wretched, extraordinary feeling he has been carrying around must be love.
There are also lone figures standing under the sparsely spaced lampposts. Some have small floating embers from cigarettes accompanying them, others are inspecting their fingernails. One is even rotating around one of the poles suggestively.
. Entertaining patrons at private gatherings was the best way of attracting good paying customers and Crowley always encouraged them to do so.
call me that!” Ruby flares, anger flying off her almost palpably, “How is he still at the top? I’ve counted the amount of nobility he brings in - it’s less than what I do. Crowley, if you’re being generous with his numbers I swear I-”
Cas nods eagerly - wanting to assure him that inconveniencing Dior in any way was not his intention.
It is quiet for a minute, snow still falling around them, still gathering on both of their shoulders.
. I have to say, I did not expect you would need it. You are very well spoken, but if you will find it helpful, I am more than happy to provide one for you,” Cain said, simply sipping his coffee.
, she had written. A sentence Castiel had started hearing early into puberty and has come to haunt every conversation he holds with his mother. Her Majesty has the best intentions, of course, but it only brings disquiet to the prince’s heart. The overwhelming fact that he turned out to be a disappointment does push him to do his best, although it pricks at his pride and heart every time he is reminded of it.
Alphas never hold onto omegas. Wrapping both arms around a single one of your partner’s is seen as submission - as trust to be kept safe from any and all dangers. It is seen as a show of weakness, of physical inferiority - something an
There were a couple of lords and ladies that were smoking on the adjacent balcony, a few people were hovering around the pool table, holding glasses that appeared to contain hard spirits, and others were playing darts. Something - or rather someones - that stood out to him, were a very handsome pair of omegas dressed in matching, stark white and feathered outfits moving amongst the patrons fluidly. Amongst the black and dark coloured outfits, Castiel dared to say they were quite blinding. His gaze followed them moving around the room, inhaling a sharp breath when the woman leaned on one of the sitting patron’s back, her deeply exposed bosom evidently pushing against the man’s neck and shoulder. He realised he must have been staring for far longer than he thought since he felt Balthazar’s hand clasp on one of his shoulders.
The prince’s lifted mood diminishes when he recalls his mother's ever so eloquent words, her underhanded comments and passive-aggressive way of reminding him to
Berating himself for forgetting to leave such an important document with the man at the desk today, he looks out of the window to discern where he is. But it is too dark and the prince does not know the area well enough, and so he asks his driver.
Castiel knew his eyes must be bulging out of his sockets. Back home, such a display of affection was not commonly used even between married or mated partners in a public setting. And yet, here he was, bearing witness to France’s Crown Princess placing an almost animal-like claim on a paid escort.
“Michael and Lucius have a complicated relationship, I believe - both being alphas and born mere minutes apart does put a strain on them,” he explains. “Michael is the Crown Prince and I believe Lucius finds it highly unfair - he is by no means far behind Michael in any aspect. They do care about each other - it is just difficult to tend to that care when you are constantly pitted against each other.”
,” Cas rolls his eyes and picks up the pace just a smidge. “I will do us both a favour and retreat from your presence.”
Castiel’s palms rub against the inside of his elbows, now, fingers caressing the flesh right above it.
Castiel is all of those things. This is how God has created him, and they are his sins to bear. But he shall bear them forthrightly.
“Oh, Dior,” she murmurs softly and rinsing her hands out with clean water. She doesn’t dry them, but walks back over to him instead and places her cold palms over his boiling skin, “Good?”
His alpha wanted to see him again. He wanted to seek him out and spend time with him. He looked at the man in front of him and wondered how one person could have so much control over him. His wolf whined and scratched on the inside, intoxicated with devotion and wanting to show it.
Dior’s mind was running ten thousand kilometers per hour. His brain barely took in that absolutely precious gesture, where the Prince had used actual air quotes, as if it was the most natural thing to do.
Castiel feels a sudden rush of warmth for this man - grateful he hasn’t insisted on holding Jack. He resented it when people couldn’t take a hint. “Okay, open that thermal bag and grab one of those bottles - yeah that one. The white machine is the warmer - push that button to turn it on - yep. You’ll need to put it here because it gets hot - great - now just place the bottle inside, the light will go off when it’s the right temperature.”
At this Dior looks up, food now finished. “Wait, he still hasn’t sent someone on the errand?” he asks, voice taking on a tone of urgency. “Shit - Millie’s almost out of neutralising herbs and Chrissie needs a new nightshirt - not to mention both the rubber and skin condoms are running out,” he curses.
Dior stares at the alpha in front of him - stares at the submissive way he hangs his head, putting his long neck on display, the way he averts his eyes. Dior starts shaking, unsure why he feels like he wants to rip his skin off his own flesh.
“Could I ask a favour of you, if it’s not too much?” Dior asked, continuing after the alpha had nodded. “Is it possible to also have a dictionary? Just so I have something to check if I find a word I am not accustomed to.”
“Not a lot,” Dior replies and his face starts flushing when he continues, “I was, uh, taught by a - a
Dior’s head starts throbbing, reminding him he is, in fact, feeling like shit. God, he just wants a break.
“Seeing a magpie. It is a nice reminder that we are not that far from England, I suppose,” Castiel supplies, only mildly amused that he would feel reassured in any capacity about being close to the palace.
“Thank you, Hannah. You may leave me to bathe on my own today as well.” he told her, not looking up from his work.
He wants to ask - wants to ask what he smells like to Dior. He wants to know if he likes it, if he thinks he would be amenable to being around it for a long time. He longs to know if he can also tell that Castiel is enamoured and whether he thinks he ought to see a physician because who in their right mind forms such an attachment after just a handful of meetings?
“No, I don’t think so. I’d need to find a babysitter and I don’t feel comfortable doing that.” Castiel shook his head. They reached the elevator and he pushed the buttons for both of their floors. “Jack and I will stay home and watch cartoons.”.
Dior and everyone else waits in the foyer for their check-up. One of the waiting rooms is prepared, as usual, for the physician. Any other Monday, Dior would be dreading sitting on the cold and portable table the doctor brings with her, waiting to be poked and prodded at with devices that make even the Princess’ ropes and leather whips seem preferable.
Both Dior and Cas sit up to introduce themselves. Cas shares a handshake with him and the beta accepts Dior’s offered hand, bringing it close to his mouth without actually placing a peck on it. This sends a ripple of delight through the alpha; not kissing an omega’s hand in greeting means the other party is accepting their escort as their potential - or actual - partner.
,” Caesar says - switching to what must be his mother tongue - interrupting his husband by placing his hand on top of the fist closest to him. “
Castiel’s chest stings. The pounding behind his ribs resonating a choir of unsung prayers. He moves his digits minutely, an involuntary movement which causes them to slip palm to palm, the back of his hand hot against warmed fabric and palm scorching with the heat of a thousand suns.
short of presenting himself. All for one incredibly mouth-watering alpha, with eyes blue enough that made Dior wonder if he’d ever even known the colour before, black hair so wild it looked like he’d just come back from a tryst - a thought which filled him with senseless jealousy.
“You do not seem to care a great deal about decorum and propriety when amongst friends, Meg,” Castiel said.
His friend laughs prettily, joyfully - such a contrast to the way she had wept in his bath merely six days ago. Lisa lets go of him completely, one of her hands flying to her belly unconsciously, “Well, I’m almost done here. Wait for me and then we can go upstairs and catch up?”
Without his permission, Dior's chest warms from where it's still sitting at the bottom of his stomach. To many, he's sure Castiel’s lack of knowledge of this would be weird, even annoying. To him, it steadies his resolve to keep him away from all this shit and ensure he doesn’t lose his idealistic views. The world needs good people to remain untainted.
Dior smirks at that. He knows Crowley only acts like he perpetually has a lemon in both his mouth and ass, but that he has a very soft spot for Dior. The older alpha has spent a few nights with him along the years, but only when he gets off his suppressants every six months as per his doctor’s instructions, and his rut hits.
“Anything our clients give us that isn’t on the list of permitted items, we need to give them to Crowley. He sells them and uses the money for essentials such as scent amplifiers or blockers,” Dior tells him, looking straight at him but body taut with nerves. If the alpha had to guess, the
“I would not know. You are aware my fashion sense is as good as a pup’s.” Castiel replies, quite seriously but with an affectionate undertone.
. He had not expected it to run quite so deep, jaw clenching throughout the whole retelling of Dior’s life in a compartmentalized version.
Jack was suckling on his dummy, soft baby noises filling the bedroom. Castiel’s heart soared. He couldn’t help but close his eyes and take a calming breath of his nephew’s scent. He smelled like baby shampoo and that adorable scent of
“We’re not far off, just another turn. I like keeping them in sections.” Dean says, starting up the conversation again.
“We’re going out today, Jack. Are you excited? Uncle Castiel sure is.” he’d coo at the six-month-old. In return, his nephew babbled happily, swinging his little, chubby hands around and spraying small bits of food in the air.
He got back to his car and dropped in the driver’s seat with an exhausted huff. He looked at the clock - at least he’ll be on time to work today. He pulled out of the car park, his mind wandering to the piece of paper inside his messenger bag.
He makes his way over, crouching next to the tub and grabbing a clean cloth, using Lisa’s own soap to create suds. He scoops one of her arms out of the water and starts cleaning her tenderly.
The slope of his shoulders is sharp underneath the fur of the blanket, his snow-wet hair covering half of his face in the man’s attempt to make himself small - a pursuit that should have been futile at his impressively tall frame, and yet heartbreakingly managing to do just so. Perhaps the most upsetting thing is how there is no trace of sunlight in his scent now - having been replaced with the strong smell of stale water and rancid nuts. It is so very similar to how he had smelled earlier in their outing but also… also much more muted, flat, quiet.
“Good morning, mother and father, brothers. I hope you have all rested well.” Castiel greeted, taking his seat next to Michael, who was sitting to the right of their mother. They all greeted him back and settled into casual conversation, his younger sister following him very shortly after and taking a seat next to him.
The longer they walked arm in arm, the stronger the scent of delight became. Castiel thought it was him being so elated he had started smelling himself, but soon realised it was coming from the omega at his side.
It had taken considerable planning on both his and Balthazar’s part and a lot of exploring of the Palace of Versaille. First, he made sure to bathe in neutralising herbs, not wanting his scent to cause any trouble. Then, they had procured some plain civilian clothing - an entirely brown and beige ensemble - and managed to slip him out with one of the servant’s carriages that went into town on a daily basis. Castiel was very proud of their cleverness. He had only half expected this to work, preparing himself to be discovered and disappointed.
