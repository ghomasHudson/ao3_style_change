He followed the girl's directions, passing through some hallways and arrived in front of a closed door with a simple and elegant sign on it.
“... yes”
“So it’s about me?!” he yelled, glad there was no one near enough to hear them.
In the span of five seconds, Castiel was already opening the door and sliding into the passenger seat.
And if Castiel had punched him right in the face, he would have survived.
“Don't call me that.”
“I went there with my parents when I was a kid, so I don't remember much. But I do remember the endless walking. I wish I had the time to visit it again, though, now that I know more of what I'm seeing.”
The should have done this, like, an hour ago. But now was okay too, and Castiel's hand was good to touch. Without exchanging any other word, they both set out to where Castiel had parked his car.
Castiel smiled: Dean wasn't mad at him for how he acted.
Castiel crossed his arms. “Does it bother you not being in control?”
This season had been rough, though, finishing off the podium at both Grand Prix events and once again not qualifying for the final. Jo had been the most upset about it, crying the whole trip back home. “
other people to overcome their suffering. I think the free healtcare helps, putting doctors in this perspective, but I assure you that good doctors do exist.”
and then turned left to go to
So, today was their chance for a breakthrough: Worlds in the pre-olympics season, one of the last chances to make an impression on the judges and make the figure skating world keep their name in mind.
“It’s about everything! You’re always… fucking
Dean got dressed. He was about to write his number on a post it, but what good could that do?
Actually, before it happened it made perfectly sense in his mind: he genuinely wanted to help the man, it didn't matter if he was the most beautiful man he'd ever seen. He was acting purely out of kindness, so he didn't think it was strange to leave him his number.

and crossed a bridge, taking then a left arriving at a small lake. It was 3:50 and only few people were there.
“I just want... to heal people. I know it sounds pretentious, but when I see someone in pain, I just wish to see them better. And by being a doctor I could actually help.”
Dean nodded, and asked
“Yeah, sure. Give me a minute to clean up here.”
Castiel was now breathing heavily and he knew he wasn’t going to last much longer, and Dean seemed to realize that too, because he stopped kissing his skin and just intensively stared at him, as he worked faster with his hand, watching as Castiel was losing any remote piece of control he still had.  “Dean” he said, his accent stronger than usual, and Dean immediately kissed him, as Cas’s orgasm hit him so hard, he had to grab Dean’s shoulder. After that, Dean kissed him once more, and then moved off from him, leaving him a few seconds to recover. Castiel completely zoned out and didn’t even notice Dean was gone, until he felt something gently brushing his stomach.
“Of course.” Amatrice was the nearest small town that had more to offer than some houses and a farm, like the village where his family stayed every summer. He used to go with them when he was younger: his parents would drive to Amatrice every time they needed to buy something, and he and Anna would play in the central square, then get some ice cream while waiting for them. Gabriele used to go with them too, sometimes. It was a nice memory.
He ordered the biggest cone and even if it was hard to eat it before it melt completely, it was still worth it. The ice cream was good, but the cone was orgasmic. He took a mental note to thank Castiel later for the tip.
He closed his mail, and opened his texting apps. He texted Sam a few photos from the day, he answered to Benny's questions about the trip, and Jo asked some pictures as well so he sent them.
He probably didn't feel comfortable enough, and Dean was 100% okay with waiting for a second, third, fourth date, if Castiel decided he wanted to.
He woke up when Castiel stopped at a red light.
“You already have.”
Dean's expression softened at that, leading Cas to do the same with his panicked one.
“Well, you better keep your promise. It's not fair you and Gabriele don't have to come with us anymore.”
“And what’s that?” Dean asked.
“Not exactly?” Castiel questioned, making quick work of tying the towel around his waist before he gave Dean another uncertain smile.
“Dean,” Castiel snapped, his eyes tearing from Amara long enough to skewer Dean into the ground. “There’s no point in sweet-talking and negotiating here, either she wants to help or—”
Castiel nudged him to let him know that class had begun. Dean was glad to have him back.
“Hey, Dean.”
Sam was gone; Michael must have grabbed whomever was closest and flown the moment the fight started.
Nothing.
The quad was busy. A bunch of people seemed to have the same idea as Dean, spread out on the generous swaths of grass that took up the space between the biggest group of college buildings. Dean wandered on through, looking around for an unoccupied bench or low wall, not quite feeling like sitting his ass on cold dirt...these college kids could do what they wanted, but Dean was speeding toward thirty faster than he’d like, and occasionally woke up having thrown something out by extreme sleeping. No grass sitting for him.
“Beer,” Dean rasped vaguely to the barman. His thighs ached—dammit, this hotel had more stairs than he’d thought.
But then, what did he really have to go back for, other than to search for another opportunity to do this all again?
up one side of the curve, splashing a stream of the ruby red liquid over the edge. “What on Earth do you mean, Cassie?”
“This is Doctor Berry. She is going to go through your paperwork with you quickly, then assess your vision and balance. As you’ve already been experiencing obvious concussion symptoms, she would like to send you for a CT scan to make sure there’s no internal bleeding or swelling.”
“Can I take a look?” Castiel asked quietly.
It was unsettling.
“You aren’t making any sense.” Castiel took a slow step toward him, his hands held up like he was approaching a spooked horse. “You seemed on board until I sat down.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Guess that’s back on the research list, then,” Sam muttered.
Castiel’s nemesis, the wood-burner, was sequestered in a red brick alcove in the middle of the back wall of the kitchen. In it’s hay day, it was probably a very pretty focal point for the room—Castiel could just picture it surrounded by hanging copper pans and bunches of drying herbs from the gardens outside. Now it was a giant hunk of rust that smelled like something had died inside.
Dean had been about to dart inside and rush off to get ready, but Benny’s words snatched his attention immediately. “A new guy? Since the last munch?”
Fuck, Dean was hot. Even if the room hadn’t been packed with people, his checked shirt was thick and Castiel was
“Very well. I’ll send them to your university email.” Hannah was all business, standing up and sliding her laptop back into her bag before she turned to Dean once more to sign, “The schedule I was provided with for you shows that you don’t have any other lecture-based classes today?”
Castiel’s suspicious squint was
no problem, wasn’t asleep
At that, Castiel finally gave out a low chuckle, something akin to a smile pulling at his mouth. They were spared from further awkward conversation by the elevator gliding smoothly to a halt, and the doors silently sliding open. The pair managed to exit without crashing into each other, yelling, or pissing each other off, so all-in-all, their relationship was improving.
Yes, Dean floated, and no he did not give two flying shits what the people giving his joyful expression strange side-eyes were thinking.
Castiel’s lips were large and pillowy, wholly commanding in their softness. He wasn’t shy with his tongue; his kisses were
“Actually,” Castiel said, taking a moment to pick up his cloth napkin and dab his mouth clean, before placing it at the side of his plate. “I have another idea.”
Castiel knew that wasn’t quite the truth; that if he’d heard what Dean had heard, in that context, coupled with all the things Castiel
—Dean struggled to reconcile, sometimes. He had always been the one to provide, to work, to look after people. He looked after everyone he knew, in his way.
Castiel shook his head once, then again, his eyes squeezing shut tight. “No, Dean. There aren’t rules, not like you’re thinking. You can’t really do any of it wrong, it’s only the intent that matters.”
“I found it—the place Castiel’s brother told us about. Broward County Mystery Spot. Turns out it’s in Florida—should’ve guessed.”
Dean nodded.
“Before you go, can we take a few minutes to review what worked and what didn’t?” Castiel asked.
“You okay?” Dean asked.
Holding his breath, Dean raised both his eyebrows in question.
feeling within him grew, so did the glow of the amulet.
Cracking open one eye provided a view of Castiel stood in a puddle of tequila.
Castiel didn’t respond with anything more than another low cough. They were spacing out, Dean registered with relief. Less coughing had to be good.
“Perfect,” Castiel said.
Until next week, take care!
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean could feel Castiel’s eyes on him, watching curiously as he worked. He kneeled down before the door, flicking the last few droplets of soda out of the bottom of the plastic bottle. Easing open the Swiss-army knife, he began to cut.
They stayed like that for several minutes, surrounded by salty air, being lightly sprayed by the rocking of the wave tips around them, before Dean cleared his throat.
The fact that there were plenty of perfectly serviceable drive-thrus on the way to Little Rock was
“Nah,” Dean said, shaking his head as his hands were too occupied to wave dismissively. “It’s fine, Cas, I’ve got you.”
or check out my
“‘I’m sorry’ seems like such a dumb thing to keep saying.”
That would work better. Where would be best for you?
“And you…you don’t mind being bound to me? What if you decide that…” Castiel didn’t finish his sentence, trailing off, the sound of the waves
“Sam, you are insane?” Dean could read Sams lips better than anyone in the world and unfortunately, he didn’t think there was any chance he’d mis-read what he’d just suggested.
Buried in Castiel’s abdomen, Dean let out a breathless grunt, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes as Castiel’s cock desperately twitched inside his mouth.
Gabriel shrugged, turning more fully. “Sure, what?”
“Shut up, you judgmental asshole!” Castiel yelled. “Unless you can tell me where the stop tap is, get out of here!”
“Alright, MEG. Gimme everything you’ve got on Third Mate Gabriel Odinson.”
“Oh, fresh meat!”
“You were so good for me,” Castiel said as he lavished more oil up over Dean’s cheeks and onto the base of his back, leaving his skin thick and glossy with it. “Which I’m very happily surprised at, as we already established that you can be a bit of a brat sometimes.”
She raised a finger before quickly taking her jug of coffee to top up the other two patrons, exchanging quick words with them before she came back to the counter. Dusting off her hands with a cloth, she then made her way over to Castiel, plopping herself down in the booth opposite him.
It’s a gamble, being here—he could be wrong, totally off base.
“What brings you here, then?” Dean asked, pulling the white towel down from his shoulder just so that he had something to do with his hands other than grabbing Castiel’s lapels and dragging him across the counter.
“I’m always late,” Dean replied, smirking as he slipped his apron over his head. “Mr. Harrington is too polite to say anything—that, and he knows the local ladies love to get an eyeful of me over the counter. Keeps their lives exciting.”
Flicking open the cap, Dean took only a second to pour water over his hand and rinse off the ring.
“Yes.”
It seemed that Dean hadn’t kept his meddling just to the door, but Castiel couldn’t be mad about it. In the midst of the hastily wiped-down old wooden table that took up one half of the kitchen, there was an old crystal vase, likely taken from one of the glass-fronted kitchen cabinets. It was filled with blue wildflowers.
“Yes. I have to go pick up my phone, but then I’ll be forced to face it again, or it’ll never be the thriving inn I was hoping for.”
Immediately, Dean excused himself from dinner with the officers and headed back to the small privacy of his tent, chased only by a knowing look from Alfie, his devoted orderly.
“I’ll help,” Dean reassured him, before jerking his thumb over his shoulder and beginning to head toward the showers. “I’m just gonna go check on Cas first.”
The makeshift waiting room was damp and drippy, a whiff of mold and mildew marinating with something purely rotten hung low in the dark space. It was a good thing that Dean had come here and not Sam. Sam was back at the motel, preparing the rest of the spell that would break the curse on the kid they’d found while hunting a rogue shaman. A good thing, in Dean’s opinion—he was pretty sure the smell would have clung to all that hair.
Dean raised his hips at the movement of Castiel’s hands, and it only took another minute for them both to discard their remaining clothes over the sides of the bed. Castiel was already hard, just the feeling of Dean’s body above him sending shocks of want through him the likes of which he couldn’t recall feeling for a very long time.
When Dean finally looked up from the bag, Castiel was staring right at him. They looked at each other in silence until one of Castiel’s eyebrows rose, quirking commandingly.
Instead, he gave the ladder another testing-shake, and once convinced that they were built to hold grown men—because he hadn’t slept in a bunk bed since he was ten, so excuse him for being suspicious—he carefully hauled himself up top to check it out. Lying on his back, staring at the white tiles, Dean decided that it was claustrophobic and weird having the ceiling so close to his face… but he’d be damned if he was telling Castiel he wanted to switch. He wasn’t even sure why he’d wanted it, other than something about Castiel made him prickly and combative, so he’d wanted to claim some territory. He didn’t even
Next week we are heading into some fast paced plotty action, but also a little something else you might enjoy... I won't say more, but I hope to see you there! :D
They both stood, glaring at each other, breathing heavily.
When the rumbling voice came up to Dean’s ear again, he was ready.
“We’ll work something out, Cas,” Dean promised. “You and me, we got this, okay? And Sam, and even Michael and Adam—you’re not on your own with this. I understand how you feel right now. And I’m gonna do everything I can to stop this getting worse.”
“And of course, Dr. Sexy himself,” Dean tried, smirking slightly, but having a feeling he was wading in the right direction. “The hottest one of them all.”
Kissing Castiel was still new—a few hours old, at most—but Dean had wanted to do it for so long that it already felt totally natural. Castiel’s plump lips were coaxing small pants from him like they were the key to unlocking Dean’s body, as well as his heart.
Flailing upwards—
“Love you, Cas,” Dean whispered suddenly, warm and fuzzy and overwhelmed.
If any more warmth filled Dean’s chest, it was going to start pouring out of his ears. “No worries, Cas. Her work on your Lincoln was good, and if you’re willing to put your word behind her...that’s good enough for me. I trust you.”
Dean’s fingers moved more confidently across Castiel’s skin, soothing and gently running his nails through the gathering oil, massaging with the tips of his fingers. “Pretty sure we can, Cas,” he said, smiling against Castiel’s warm, tan neck.
His cock was trapped between them, rubbing against his stomach with every thrust, leaving a leaking trail of precome across his toned abs.
Castiel trailed off. He stopped and pulled back from what he was doing, turning away.
“Like a rat or something,” Dean grimaced pointing at the screen, over Castiel’s shoulder. “Behind you.”
For a brief moment, Dean forgot that he was on camera and let his mouth hang open. Hot damn… He’d thought Castiel was attractive in his suits. But now his face filled the screen, slightly flushed and sweating around his hairline. His cheeks were pink and heated, and as he moved back from the camera slightly, Dean caught sight of a tight black t-shirt stretching across his defined biceps. Wow.
Licking at his lips, Castiel trailed his hand purposefully down Dean’s front. Their eyes were locked as he took Dean in hand, enjoying the silken firmness and weight of him in his palm. He pumped slowly, watching Dean’s mouth fall slightly open, his breath shaking, and his eyes blinking closed on a long moan as Castiel thumbed firmly across his slit.
Puffing out an anxious final breath, Dean closed his eyes and started to tap out the guitar-filled intro to Cheap Trick’s
“Alright,” Bobby began, turning to face Dean and Jo. “Here’s the deal. Somebody from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Wichita came down here this morning—”
Dean shakes his head, mouth open. “Seriously? This is
to bruise, wanted to feel it the next day (or for days to come, if he was lucky), Castiel concentrated his hits in similar areas, repeatedly striking the flesh as it began to heat and tingle.
. You're also welcome to follow me on
’” Dean interjected, nodding slowly as he let his eyes drift back to space. “Yeah, I saw it too. I think I’ve read it before, but I didn’t stop to think about it at the time.”
I’m really sorry to do this, but I’m not going to make it to class today
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “I definitely couldn’t care less about that one. Your flasher coat has grown on me over the months, and I like your hair exactly like this”—He reached up, dragging his fingers through Castiel’s thick, voluminous strands,—“all just-got-fucked and sexy. I’m sure I’d have liked it like that on a date, too.”
“Thanks, boss,” Claire said coolly.
“Brother,” Castiel said, low and quiet. “I had to—”
Dean gave the Lincoln a good look over and jotted down various extra jobs he wanted to do, just to make sure Castiel got the car back in the best condition he could. As he crept under the car on a board, he could see several spots where a lot of work had already been done on her. That must have been Anna, he supposed, keeping her brother’s disaster of a car running as best she could without a shop. It was good work, he noted, fixes he’d have been proud of himself.
Before we dive into the chapter this week, I thought we’d have a little vocab lesson! While it’s not necessary to understand these terms to enjoy the fic, I think some background knowledge might be interesting for some people.
Gabriel laughed, nodding his agreement. “Sure would. Well, if you want to know any
For a moment everything seemed silent, the white-fronted parrots and the red-eyed frogs in the trees going quiet as the whole Yucatan jungle seemed to pause, leaning in to listen.
Dean’s head slumped into his hand and he chuckled. “She’ll never be a rockstar but she’s got spirit.”
“It’s been too long,” she agreed. “But hey, your signing is getting better!”
I’m going to come, Dean, I—”
The chairs around Dean all shuddered as they were hurriedly pushed back, movement everywhere sending vibrations through the floor. Dean’s eyes flicked back to the clock—class was over. Adler must have dismissed them.
On more than one occasion, he’d also seen tears, and misplaced anger, and panic attacks caused by something as basic as an unexpected loud noise, or a phrase Dean had used, or the smell of some new soap Sam had tried.
“You’re giving them to me?”
“Castiel.”
Castiel’s hand slipped into Dean’s, squeezing reassuringly, and a single tear slid down his cheek.
The weather felt like it had been cooperating, up until that point—the wind quieting, the moon doing its best to beat the clouds and illuminate their faces, close together on the beach. But as a warm, building sensation filled Dean’s chest, the air began to whip around him ferociously, and the clouds rolled across the sky, leaving them only with leaping candlelight on the sand.
Castiel looked down and reached out, his hand heading for the waist of Dean’s jeans, even though his expression was still hazy.
Holding the two open beers, Castiel stepped out of the kitchen and found himself in a cozy living room. The bulk of it was taken up by a huge open fireplace, made of red bricks and dominating one whole wall. There were no overhead lights, just a couple of warm, glowing lamps here and there, illuminating soft brown leather couches and exposed brick walls. The walls were laden with art of almost every kind Castiel could think of; oil-painted landscapes, funny mid-century prints, newspaper cartoons, movie posters. There were knick-knacks and sculptures nestled against old books in low bookcases, and a heavy, dark-stained table constructed of reclaimed wooden beams.
True to his word, it only took five minutes before Castiel was parallel parking just down the street from
“Do you like them?” Castiel asked quietly, his eyes only flicking over to check on Dean before they turned back toward the road.
But the things he’d done while bearing it, the grief he’d caused while wearing it on his skin, the feeling of rage and hatred, the broiling need to do
“Here’s your coffee!” Claire announced, spinning around to see Castiel’s fingers still on the edge of the plate. “Oh! Were you going to try one of my new cookies? Kaia’s the cook around here, she makes the best burgers in town, but I like to try sometimes.”
“Food?” Castiel hazarded a guess.
Castiel’s shoulders slumped again, more glumly this time. “I enjoy teaching you. I do it because I want to, it’s very rewarding for me, and I don’t like keeping you waiting.”
going to go with Jo’s dumb suggestion, but…baby steps. Spending more time together away from school was a good start.
“You’re the best brother in the world, Sammy.”
He shouldn’t have been surprised—this was her job, after all—but it made Dean relax a little.
“I assumed that you wouldn’t want anything to do with
and it had Dean melting into the bench, eyes squeezed shut in pleasure.
Castiel raised a sardonic eyebrow, but Dean could still detect a tiny smile. He held back from explaining how otters were playful, cuddly, super family-focused, and held hands when they were sleeping. If Dean wished he could be an otter on occasion, that was no one’s business.
Hello, friends! Happy Holidays, whatever you may celebrate!
The response to this fic has made my heart grow several sizes, but I thought it actually might burst when I just looked at this chapter all ready to go with Liz's amazing art in place. I hope you love it as much as I do!
“I think so,” Castiel answers roughly, his voice full of disbelief. “I’m—you—how? What happened?”
“So, is this just what we’re gonna do now?” Dean asked quietly, his eyes scanning forlornly up and down the bar, searching for peanuts that would never come. “Drink until everyone is dead? Together? Here?”
Sam’s list turned out to be fairly short, even if it was full of hippy-dippy shit. He’d called Castiel, it seemed, to explain to him which types of tea he wanted, as it appeared that Sam thought Castiel could do a better job of picking them out than Dean could. Dean wasn’t even going to fight that one, and simply pointed the angel toward the tea section at the grocery store.
“You’re late, bitch.”
Dean could barely bring himself to react; Castiel’s lips were dry and textured, but pillowy and huge and soft, and every movement of them against his own felt like he was falling into a dream of something too miraculous to be real. But when he pulled back, and their eyes opened, Castiel was still there.
“Oh, this is lovely,” Castiel said, blinking as he looked around. “I had no idea this was here.”
Castiel!” Crowley crowed temptingly. “You see, I managed to roll right into bed with one of our competitors, and they are going to take the spa project I’d purchased for
Castiel finally raised his head. “I believe your concern is misplaced. I can feel the Mark, yes.” His fist flexed subtly in the corner of Dean’s eye, and he could picture the scarred muscles of Castiel’s forearm shifting beneath the trench coat. “It’s not pleasant, I will admit. Its poison clings to my grace, and it is burned into my true form just as it is onto my skin. But I am aware of it. I control it.”
Castiel blinked in surprise—and Dean tried his best not to feel some kind of way about that, he really did. “Okay?” Castiel echoed. “You aren’t mad?”
Castiel bit into his Caesar salad (no croutons, dressing on the side) and tried to pretend it tasted like alfredo sauce clinging to fresh tagliatelle.
The thought brought him a small smile, at least. Yeah, maybe he was an idiot, maybe Castiel was way out of his league. But at least he was self-aware enough to know he was totally gone on the guy.
From his online research, Castiel had learned… Well, nothing really, about Bellbird Valley. It didn’t seem to be the most cosmopolitan of places, very rural and fairly cute from the few pictures he’d found. That was fine by Castiel, though. He’d always loved the countryside. He liked to go away for the weekend and visit pretty guesthouses and shop in tiny little boutiques, or rough it for a night or two at a camping resort and really relax. Get a hot stone massage, something like that.
“Just one,” Dean confirmed. “Sun up until sun down—one day and I’ll make you fall in love.”
“Uh, I think it is, actually, we never—”
“Will Mr. Shurley be joining us tonight?” Dean asked Jess as they led Dean to what had once been his father’s rooms.
“It was a mistake,” Dean settled on saying.
Oh. Oh, good God.
“One day?” Castiel said skeptically, raising his beer bottle slowly.
is now only two days from closing. If you'd like me to write a fic for you, here is a rare chance! I usually only have time to take prompts from my Patreon family, but this auction is open to anyone and all proceeds go to Random Acts. There are lot of brilliant authors and artists to bid on at all kinds of budgets, so there's really something for everyone.
Sam looked uncomfortable, sharing a look with Dean that clearly spelled out
“Yup.”
“You mistake my concern for judgement,” Dean said quietly, nudging Baby to step up to Connie’s side so that he could reach across to press a hand lightly to Castiel’s elbow. “I assure you; I would not think poorly of you for that kind of company. I understand it.”
Dean is so tense he might snap, his bones pressing together and grinding under the pressure of his skin. Minutes tick on, and he can hear Michael’s somber tones in the back of his head cautioning him that timing is everything here…
When Dean licked his lips before responding, Castiel’s eyes followed involuntarily, helplessly, like a child chasing a kite string, even knowing that the toy they wanted belonged to the wind.
Dean couldn’t even complain at the title, his chest too full and his lips committed elsewhere. Besides, it was true.
Meg’s expression was sour, but she nodded.
It was Claire, one of the new generation of hunters—kids, Dean couldn’t help but think of them—that he and Sam had been training up for months. “Alright, put him on,” Dean said, slinging the kitchen towel over his shoulder.
“What are we going to do with her when we’ve unwrapped her and got the amulet free?” Sam asked quietly as they shuffled back along the corridor, trying not to jostle the corpse too much.
And then Castiel’s eyes squeezed shut, and his shoulders tensed, and his hands whipped up suddenly to say, “Is this a date? No—shit, of course it’s not, I just…I wasn’t sure and I thought I should probably clear it up, in case—just in case it was?”
Slowly, Castiel settled once more, almost melting down into the mattress, his eyes trained half-heartedly on the continuing documentary as sea birds and whales flew and swam their way across the screen.
Panic gripped Dean’s formerly hopeful chest, turning his ribs into a true cage for his heart. But he took a big breath, expanded his lungs, and broke through the bars. “Yeah. Let’s try that, Cas. I’ve got one quick question first, though.”
“Oh,” said Castiel, around his mouthful of rubbery cement. “It’s lovely. Is that, uh…cinnamon?”
Castiel nodded. “Several of my siblings have plans this afternoon, and they’ll expect me to go with them. So, I should probably head home in a little while.”
Dean was still squinting out across a pretty little courtyard for clues when a tall, skinny man in way-too-tight bicycle shorts strolled past the window, blocking his view. Dean recoiled quickly, hiding himself out of sight. What kinda bizarre place was he in?
Swinging hard at Chuck’s jaw, Dean couldn’t deny the sense of satisfaction that it brought, even if it really did little more than make Chuck roll his eyes a bit.
“I thought this couch was a bit ‘nineties Pottery Barn’ for your tastes. Who are you planning on having over, though? You know we don’t care.”
Rattling around in the locker, Dean picked through the remnants of the belongings of whichever poor, sleeping sap had occupied the dorm before them. They looked like a right dull bastard, Dean decided, but there was a red plaid shirt that was better than his baggy white scrub top, at least.
” Castiel snapped again, looking more furious than Dean could understand. “We are not friends, Dean.”
I told some of you in the comments that Gabriel would be coming up again... and this is far from the last time ;)
Holding a finger up to Sam to pause him for a moment, Dean leaned forward across his knees so that he could reach down and tie his boots. Worn jeans, his boots, and a soft plaid shirt—that was fine, right? It’d better be, Dean thought grumpily. His layers were more than a fashion choice, they were a self-defense mechanism, so hipster fashion could suck it. Though…he did see a lot of hipsters in plaid. Maybe they had issues, too.
Dean coiled his tongue around Castiel’s thumb within his mouth, showing off a little, sucking on it with a happy hum. At Castiel’s resulting smile, Dean smirked coyly around him and pressed his taste buds into the ridges of Castiel’s fingerprint. His skin tasted salty and warm.
“Wouldn’t be my first,” she snorted flippantly. “You remember that douche in that bar back in Illinois, before we moved? What the hell was his name…”
that sent water all over the grimy floor, a huge tail rose from the water and flopped over the rim of the bathtub.
“If you’re all good,” Dean said, “I’ll take my lunch hour now. Let me know if you need anything, though.”
“I am well aware of how to open a drawer, thank you,” Castiel found himself snipping short-temperedly. “We have those in the city too, y’know.”
“Will you stop trying to leave and let me
Sam shook his head as he hefted the duffle to his shoulder. “I still can’t believe you had us rescue a mermaid. Of all the crazy shit you’ve done—”
“Hey,” Rufus said pointedly, narrowing his eyes. “Cool your jets.”
The mermaid—assuming that was
Schlepping his way into the kitchen slowly, Castiel made his way over to the sink in the thick socks he’d slept in, doing his best to avoid anything on the floor that would be
“I think it's time I head back, then. Goodnight, Castiel, I hope I'll see you soon?”
Any feedback is appreciated and loved,
Dean wanted to kiss him out of gratitude.
He sat on the couch and turned on the TV. He felt somehow relaxed to hear people speaking italian: after being in England with Baldassarre and his friends for two weeks, it was nice to understand everything so easily. He loved speaking English and he wished he could speak it better, but he had to admit that it put him in a constant alert state of mind.
“Bye, Dean. I hope you have fun and relax.”
“Got it. So what are you studying, then?”
He remembered their first time (which wasn't Dean's first per se, but first time with a guy) and the many after that. He wished he hadn't wasted so much time trying to deny his feelings, sleeping around with other girls and hurting both of their hearts.
Thank you so much for reading, I hope you liked it!
“Exactly.”
“Yes. Where?”
That Thursday, though, his goal wasn't getting stress out of his system: he just wanted to let himself think about Dean. Dean's warm embrace, Dean's breath on his neck, Dean's hands on his thigh and waist.
“Of course, you aren’t,” Dean agreed amiably.
A loud
“Yes, m’lord,” Castiel agreed, rolling above Dean and capturing his lips.
Simple problems had simple solutions. And maybe, he thought, there was a simple solution to his ongoing torment over Castiel, too. He knew that most of the reason he struggled to communicate with Cas was because he was always choking out words around the Thing He Couldn’t Say…so what if he just said it?
Before Dean could protest, he was left alone in the oddly quiet diner.
“I’ll wean you off them over the next twenty-four hours or so, see how you do.”
Dean’s brain had to try the boot command over again because that
Dean paused, reaching to rub the back of his neck self-consciously, before sighing and deciding to continue. He was going to have to come clean at some point, he figured.
hilariously, named Dick—hadn’t dangled a promotion to Director of Sales at Dean so many times. Currently, that was Adler’s job.
Next time: A little hurt/comfort, Dean talks about his feelings (but not to Cas), and someone...makes a move.
“First of all, I’m sorry,” Castiel signed, his eyes big and wide as they moved up and down Dean, taking him in. “I rushed over here to wait for you because I was concerned you might worry or come to the wrong conclusion. None of this went how I intended, so if you’re angry— ”
By the time Castiel had turned the last corner as per Kaia’s instructions, he was getting tired. It turned out that a mile on a treadmill or city streets was significantly different to a mile of rutted tarmac while dragging a battered, massive suitcase along behind you.
Dean nodded, flicking his eyes back to the professor for a moment—a lost cause, but he was trying—and folded his arms across his chest. Just his damn luck, today.
“Dean. And it’s okay, I was on the floor.”
Fuck Garrison. Fuck Garrison, and fuck Naomi, and fuck Zachariah. Castiel didn’t usually cuss much, a holdover of his conservative home, and his f-bombs tended to be very special occasions, even mentally. But right then...fuck everything.
Dean obediently drank down half of the water bottle before putting the cap back on. Once he was done, Castiel was waiting, a square of chocolate poised between his first finger and thumb, ready to slip between Dean’s lips. Smiling against it, let out a little huff of amusement before sliding out his tongue to catch the treat.
“Don’t you dry out?” Dean found himself asking instead, pointing vaguely at the bed.
“Can I hug you?” Dean asked after another awkward second, his arm hovering around Castiel’s shoulders.
“Yes?”
Dean must have been staring again. He wasn’t sure he even cared, anymore. “I’m just having a good time, is all.”
They worked side by side, gently dragging their tools at right angles over the dirt, sifting off layer after layer of compact jungle substrate. The site was divided up into squares, so that finds could be labeled and the palace mapped out and recorded accurately. They’d worked patiently through grid after grid over the past two weeks, and were now pushing to get the last of this room—a residential room, they believed—cleared before they had to catch their flight that night.
And what did it matter, really, if Dean was crushing on Castiel? It wouldn’t amount to anything. Castiel was hyper-professional, for all that he was warm and attentive with Dean. He was also a few years older, Dean thought, and probably straight, and most likely thought Dean was a bit of a jerk by now.
“Uh—Fuck, yes,” Dean mumbled around the intrusion, jutting his jaw forward to open up his throat and take as much of Castiel as he could. It had been a long, long time since he’d done this, but it wasn’t something he’d forgotten.
The pet names were a thing Balthazar had always done, but it had never occurred to Castiel quite how much he hated them until that moment.
“There are advantages to having a moose for a brother.” Charlie grinned as she showed him the screen.
…who knew what a mermaid was packing? “Why don’t we find out?”
The sharp click of the door opening had Castiel swiftly spinning back to the desk, scattering notecards everywhere in his attempt to scramble into a professional-looking position. He dropped his donut on the glass tabletop and was vaguely aware of some honey glaze sliding from the corner of his mouth as Naomi cleared her throat.
He could have got off just like that, just with Castiel pressed up to him, praising Dean’s mouth with his tongue, moving against him.
Castiel didn’t miss the tiny, preening smile that Dean gave at the compliment, before shrugging and reaching across to grab his grout bucket again. “It’s grouting tiles, Cas…even you can manage that, surely.”
more than just his little half-twitch of lips, and something warmed and wormed a little deeper into Dean’s chest at the sight. He smiled back, proud. “You’re welcome. It’s all in the pastry temperature, that buttery flakiness.”
“Castiel! I’ve been calling you for two days, you giraffe.”
Normal posting will continue on Tuesday with
Castiel squinted for a second, then grinned. “Oh—that’s my name sign. Or the one my family uses for me, anyway. The letter ‘C’ and then—remember we talked about iconic signs, where the sign resembles the meaning of the word?” Castiel fluttered his hand, fingers together. “‘Wing’—see, the motion. ‘Wings’.”
“You wanna spend the evening hanging out with me?” Dean asked, delighting at the pink color he spotted at Castiel’s neck.
Castiel grinned and circled his fingers forward in front of his coffee cup, indicating Dean should go on.
P.P.S. Due to a spate of nasty comments of late, I have enabled comment moderation. I hope that this can be temporary, but for now, I'm sorry if you have to wait a little to see your comment added. <3
Dean stiffened, disgruntled. “Of course I wouldn’t—”
Dean turned back to the perfect chalk circle, taking one last look at all its wave-like lines and delicate shading, before he sucked in a deep breath and whipped his arm forward.
Castiel let out a shocked noise and for a moment he was stiff in Dean’s arms. Then he exhaled sharply, dropping his chin to Dean’s shoulder. After another couple of seconds, he raised one hand and rested it on Dean’s shoulder blade, pulling at the fabric of Dean’s ship-issue white t-shirt.
“Come on,” Castiel signed, smiling indulgently as he sat up. “Let’s shower, and I can quiz you on your Engineering Core stuff for half an hour before you have to be at Cardwell Hall.”
Dean’s Russian was coming along nicely. But then, Castiel’s methods of teaching were...creative.
With that, Dean shoved his phone back into his pocket, defeated. His chances of improving his day had just dropped dramatically. Nonetheless, he straightened his shoulders and grabbed his notebook, turning his attention to the huge whiteboard at the front of the class that Professor Adler always covered in numbers and ramblings. It was clear, waiting for him to start.
“Welcome to Harrington’s!” Dean’s deep voice met Castiel at the door.
Jack barely opens his mouth before Dean butts back in.
Castiel stood and moved over to the reception desk. There was a swift discussion, some hand waving, and then the woman nodded. She called back to someone in the room behind her seat, and a nurse appeared a moment later with a frosty, blue ice pack. Castiel returned with it wrapped in a neat cloth sleeve, and with a clipboard of his own.
Dean tried to shove the
In the sink, a droplet of water from the dripping faucet journeyed miserably down the slope of the porcelain and into the drain. Dean stared at it, letting out a long, slow sigh.
“Hey,” Dean said simply, clearing his rough throat and giving Castiel a small smile before he swished the cloth in the water, rinsing it, and returned to his task.
The noise came back again—
“Then you should take us straight home, Dean,” Castiel said patiently, grinning.
“Sorry,” Dean started to say, “that seat is actually taken, my—”
“Good morning, Winchester,” Zachariah’s offensively polite voice slithered through Dean’s laptop speakers. “Glad you decided to finally join us.”
Next to him, Jo thumped her thigh into his, and when he looked over, her eyes were resting pointedly on Cole.
“How about we finish this up
“Dean? Dean! Can you hear me?”
They both fell quiet for a moment, eyes on the road, until Dean let a small sigh, squared his shoulders, and said, “Well, that Gabriel guy seemed to think I ‘have it in me,’ whatever that means. So, I’m telling myself that we’ve got this. We’ll hunker down, do the research—if I really have to, I’ll tell Cas and ask him about it. But that’s a last resort.”
Dean ducked his head, looking about as uncomfortable as Castiel felt. He let go of the casserole serving spoon and raised his hand to rub self-consciously at his mouth. “It’s, uh, it’s Dean, actually. Here. I mean, everywhere, but I mean I don’t—”
, Castiel considered dryly.
Okay. Lunch. Keep it G-rated.
(See the end of the chapter for
When they were only a few steps away, Castiel looked over from his conversation and spotted them approaching. It’d be impossible to miss Charlie’s neon yellow jumpsuit even in a crowd, Dean reasoned; she looked like a walking highlighter. Or perhaps she’d just shouted ahead. Castiel raised his hand in a little wave.
When Castiel fell quiet, Dean ducked down to press his lips to Castiel’s temple. Straightening up, Castiel wiped under his eyes, a little flushed, but with a small smile tugging at his lips.
“Sorry,” Dean snapped grumpily. “I drove as fast as I could, okay? Barely got my four hours.”
Okay. He’d change before Adler.
“Lucky guess, which you just confirmed. I’m not stupid, Dean.”
“Oh,” Castiel said. Was that a tiny flush on his cheeks? Through the camera, it was hard to be sure. “I apologize for my presumption.”
“Oh, come on.” Sam shook his head. Dean realized he had that same stubborn, determined look he used to get when he was a kid and wanted Dean to let him do something their father had said no to. “I can see your crush all the way from California. The only thing I don’t understand is why you, the Lothario of the Winchester family, haven’t asked him out yet.”

Dean carried on wickedly working his tongue, gazing up at Castiel, sliding one hand across to squeeze his hip in acknowledgement of his words.
Next to Dean, Sam made his way around the edge of the counter and stuck his hand out eagerly toward Castiel. Dean could see the mischievous expression on Sam’s face even if anyone else might have missed it; the way he grinned at Castiel was just a little too welcoming.

“Will you?” Dean asked, checking.
Immediately the speaker up on the dormitory wall crackled.
Dean sighed, defeated. “I see you can lipread, too.”
Dean raised an eyebrow, recalling their conversation on the quad. “They’ll expect you to? Are these things you want to do, or things you do just because you feel like you have to?”
His tone was flat and emotionless. Something inside of Dean broke a little to hear it.
and check her out on
Dean raised an eyebrow in amusement but refrained from commenting on that part. “What is it you’re studying, anyway?” he asked instead.
Finally giving in and holding his hand out for the slice, Castiel squinted across the space between them. “The juxtaposition of your cocksure confidence with your self-deprecation never ceases to be jarring.”
Walking back to the table with the paper bag of sandwiches under his arm, Dean offered a reassuring smile. “Come on,” he said, popping the lids on their cups. “We don’t have to do this today.”
“Is that so?” Castiel asked, grinning despite itself.
Gabriel’s eyes flicked away guiltily, taking in the war room with a detached curiosity instead of answering.
“There’s a light switch to your left,” a deep voice rumbled. It sounded…sleepy. Drugged. “Sorry. I try to rest between visits.”
“Thank you,” he signed, his smile lingering as he looked back up and jerked his head to indicate the road they needed to cross. “Ready?”
- Mal <3
Dean looked away, letting go of Castiel and pulling his feet back up onto the bed as he moved to the side of the mattress, ostensibly searching for the TV remote. “‘Relationship’ is really kind of a strong word for what I’ve had with anyone for most of my life, Cas. And, well, I mean…you never asked. It’s not something I advertise, particularly. Just not anyone’s business.”
“I am all-in for a good pile of bacon and pancakes this morning,” Dean said, clapping and rubbing his hands together once he’d cut the engine. He’d circled the lot three times to pick a space to park Baby in, and Castiel hadn’t said a word about it, both used to and entirely accepting of Dean’s automotive idiosyncrasies. (Not too far from the door, visible from the window, but shaded enough to keep Baby out of the morning sun.) “You want some more coffee?”
With a
There's nothing better for showing an artist how much they enrich our fic worlds.
Castiel nodded. “In general,” he signed, “though more specifically with men. I’ve been on a handful of dates with women, though obviously they didn’t work out for very long. But with men…”
“Hey, whatever happened to us going on that date, huh?” Dean said around a mouthful of pizza, knocking his foot into Castiel’s on the coffee table where they both sprawled in front of the TV, watching an old spaghetti western. Dean had been at work for twelve hours and Castiel had started the first scene of his new novel, hated it, scrapped it, and rewritten it several more times—they’d needed some TV that was easy on the mind. Plus, cowboys were hot.
. He wanted to know everything—wanted to know how Castiel tasted.
Spreading one hand across his chest in abject horror, Dean staggered dramatically. “You wound me!”
Dean grunted as he rolled onto his side, but he reached out and took the bottle. While he drank a few deep gulps, Castiel reached under the bed and pulled out the duffle bag that he’d stashed there when he’d first checked in and paid to rent the room.
Silence built again until Dean let out a long sigh, and slithered his way to the edge of the bunk. He slid down the ladder, giving Castiel’s mattress a solid kick on the way.
Snow began to fall, beyond the window.
“But why?” Dean wiped his hands on a crumpled towel, left on the counter from the night’s attempt at dinner, before straightening it out and hanging it on the front of the tiny oven. He pursed his lips thoughtfully before turning back to Castiel, grinning as he pointed at him with both forefingers. “Unless—there’s something you want me to see.”
“Morning, Cas,” Dean said around his toast remains.
Castiel mewled with delighted frustration, lifting his face from Dean’s neck to press their foreheads together.
It was a heady feeling, but he wanted to see Dean’s face make other expressions, too; he wanted to see him fall apart and gasp Castiel’s name as he came, he wanted to see how Dean looked when Castiel took his thick, curved cock all the way for the first time.
Castiel angled himself just a little so that he was facing Dean more fully and picked up his coffee with a small smile. “Go ahead.”
They waited a few steps from the entrance to the diner, standing under an awning, the door clicking audibly in the still air as it was locked from within. It was late and they were the only people in sight.
Jesus…), “I think we’ll begin with a little spanking, just my hand, and see how much you can take.”
“Thank you for cooking,” Dean said. “No one’s cooked breakfast for me since my dad died. And he wasn’t the best cook, let me tell you. I used to feed Sammy so that Dad wouldn’t send him to school on carbonized toast.”
, and Instagram
“Three,” Castiel said from next to Dean, stepping up closer as Dean removed his hands from inside MEG’s barely corporeal body. “You’re helping too.”
A hand presses to Dean’s shoulder and his whole body jerks, collapsing inward, crushed under his own weight. He is a black hole. “Sam,” he mutters, shaking his head as he looks up—
“Hey,” Dean said, chuckling and leaning back in his seat. “Don’t mind Adler, he’s always like that. I’m Dean.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean let out softly, his voice cracking with soot and emotion.
Huffing out a grumpy sigh, Dean turned his attention back to Jo.
“April used to say that too.” Castiel set the empty glass down on top of the bar, between Dean’s boots.
Castiel came and stood next to him once she’d gone, the paper cover on the examination table wrinkling up as he rested his hip on the padded edge.
Charlie looked like she wanted the carpet to swallow her. “I didn’t mean—holy shit, I really am bad at this. Can we just start again, dude? Fuck. I’m sorry.”

Castiel groaned out loud, letting the filthy, delighted sound linger. No reason to hide it; Kaia looked incredibly pleased by the outcome.
Tongue darting out to moisten his bottom lip, Castiel slid his attention wholly to Dean, all of the other brothers forgotten. “Dean,” he said quietly, searching his face. “Please, trust me. If there had been a better way to do this in the time we had, I would have done it.”
Dean tried to suppress a shudder.
Feeling his neck heat, Dean blinked and sat up before responding. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Dean boosted himself up to sit on the examination table, then signed “okay” back.
behind him.
For a long moment, Castiel’s arms remained twined around Dean’s neck.
Dean blinked. “Oh,” he said, genuinely surprised. “Not—not at all? Even in college, or—”
Castiel slowly released Dean’s wrist until both of his arms hung limply by his sides. He answered, looking down at the floor. “I did think that you wouldn’t understand, and wouldn’t care. I misjudged you and I’m sorry, but it doesn’t matter that you aren’t an angel, Dean. There’s no rule that says that humans can’t know about angel things, and even if there was, I would ignore it.”
He groaned.
Then he quietly grabbed his jeans from the floor and slipped them into his back pocket.
Dean only managed a slow blink. For a moment he didn’t trust his eyes, but—with flaming pink cheeks—Castiel repeated himself, more slowly.
Dean blinks. Something in his chest is cracking—can anyone hear that but him? It’s like ice thawing. “Yeah, yeah,” Dean agrees hurriedly, nodding a little too fast as he shoves his hands across his cheeks, furiously pushing back the tears. “I’ll do it. Whatever you need.”
Dean sighed as his dick immediately woke up and reminded him exactly what kind of man he was dating. “I hate you,” he said, soft and unconvincing.
the dirt of a pig assault—Castiel pushed himself back up to standing.
“When we had a run-in with Chuck and Amara before, Amara injured Chuck,” Sam began. “He was dying, actually.”
He picked out his current favorite old band tee—an awesome Led Zeppelin tour shirt from Madison Square Garden in ’73 that he’d found at a haunted thrift store in Milwaukee. He slipped on his softest jeans, then laced up his boots, and headed off to the kitchen. The first stop for any good, quiet day was always coffee.
“Me too,” Castiel agreed warmly, turning into the small parking lot beside Sam’s office. Free parking won out over being slightly closer to the restaurant.
. You're also welcome to follow me on
“Yeah. I get that you need to work through your emotions or whatever, but the transmission alone could take you six hours or more. You need hands.”
“I love you,” Castiel rumbled happily, pressing his forehead into Deans. “Thank you, for...well, for asking, I guess.”
“So, how does that help us?”
Dean’s preferences, but he didn’t exactly sit around and chat about them with a guy he thought of like an uncle or a surrogate father.
So the question is, folks...is this a date? Does Cas know that it's a date? For that matter...does Dean?! Either way, they're going to a party together and I feel like it counts.
“Sorry,” Dean whispered. His eyes dropped down to his hands, where he held the strap of his backpack and turned the woven end over and over in his fingers, the fabric twisting and curling just like the sour feeling in his stomach. “I shouldn’t have—I’ve had a long day. I’m just gonna go. I’ll pick you up tomorrow, just text me where to go.”
Dean blew warm air onto his fingers as they waited to be seated. It was definitely too cold to be walking around just in a t-shirt—barely above freezing—but seeing Castiel wearing his shirt had pleased something deep in his chest that he kinda liked, so he hadn’t bothered to ask for it back. If that was a little caveman of him, well…sue him, he didn’t care. Cas looked hot and his amazing shoulders were testing the fabric of
Castiel rocked his hips up to meet Dean’s thrusts. Every push brought Dean’s hips flush against Castiel’s cheeks, every slow slide back out rubbed over Castiel’s prostate with exquisite precision, every ragged pant made Castiel feel more wanted
Castiel’s voice, dopey and lazy and post-orgasmic—rumbling directly in Dean’s ears—whispered low, “I wanna kiss you, Dean.”
“Approaching Bellbird Valley Station.”
“I don’t need to look down at you.” Castiel tucked the joint between his plush lips, lighting the tip with a heavy Zippo that bore the name
“Good afternoon, Dean,” Castiel greeted again as Dean picked his headset back up. “Don’t worry about Bobbi. If you have to take pauses to check on her, I don’t mind. I wasn’t aware you had children.”
“So…” Castiel whispered into the tiny space between them, and the
to feel some kind of way about Dean’s simple assessment of his efforts, Castiel found himself staring at it.
“I’ll always worry,” Castiel murmured honestly into his ribs. “Thank you for singing this morning, though. I like hearing you, getting a sense that you’re okay.”
“I know your labs today are cancelled, so you’re free,” he signed, “but unfortunately I still have some paperwork to finish up before the day is out.”
Dean held his breath as Castiel’s hand came forward. He had strong, elegant fingers that Dean had definitely had some really inappropriate fantasies about…but this wasn’t the time to dwell on what he wished those hands would do. With his first finger and thumb pinched together, Castiel lightly tapped the top of Dean’s cheekbone, looking nervous, before withdrawing his hand to demonstrate on himself.
He’s not actually aware he’s still sobbing until he hears a voice beyond the door.
Dean laughed, glad that it seemed his approach would be welcome. He dropped the microphone on the floor, far from the kind of sobriety that was involved with slotting it back into the little holder-thingy. He jumped down from the tiny stage—
“Fine, uncultured swine,” Dean mumbled. “MEG, privacy off.”
“You’ll miss me, roomie,” Charlie said, grinning.
Watching Dean shudder above him was addictive, but Castiel wanted more.
“Cocksure?” Dean teased with a wink, “I am pretty sure of that, you’re right.”
Dean said nothing, though, nodding as the emergency room receptionist pushed a clipboard toward him. He grabbed the pen—secured to the board by a little chain, of course—and sat down in a wobbly plastic chair while Bobby conversed with the older woman behind the desk, occasionally pointing at Dean and gesturing.
“Oh, don’t worry, gramps,” Claire said, grinning as she reached across to ruffle Castiel’s hair. “I never mind babysitting the old folk. And anyway, gossiping about Dean is always fun.” She turned to Sam, nodding her head toward the register before she said, “Usual?”
“An artist, is she?” called Laffitte from his spot across the breakfast table.
Alright, Dean could shift the conversation back to where Castiel was comfortable. He could take a hint. For now, at least.
He wondered idly if Castiel was interested in uniforms, before backing up a few feet and realizing he should probably find out if he was interested in men, first.
Castiel nodded eagerly, turning his attention to Charlie. “Yes! They show all the big Marvel movies and have special days for older franchises, too. This time of year, near Christmas, they even have Harry Potter marathons.”
It was a fast, rhythmic
In return, Dean got a raised eyebrow and a puzzled frown before the mer replied, “There’s only one thing people come here for.”
“Dork,” Dean muttered fondly before nodding. “Of course. I would love to go on a date with you, Cas. Pull out all the stops, romance me. If it goes really, really well”—Dean walked his fingers up the side of Castiel’s face, before turning his jaw gently so that he could grin at him and press a kiss to his lips—“you might even get lucky at the end.”
Finally, outside door number thirteen, Earl stopped. The corridor was especially damp here, a puddle beneath the door frame splashing gently against the bare concrete as Earl stepped through it. He slipped a heavy, old-fashioned key into the door. The key was engraved with a symbol that Dean had thought was just a fancier, tilted number thirteen—but the more he looked at it, the more he realized it wasn’t. It was a letter in some unknown language, Dean was sure.
Sam had developed a horrible habit of not tolerating Dean’s shit ever since he went to Stanford, Dean noted sourly. He threw a scathing look at the open Zoom window.
It’s Michael.
“Yeah. Sure is,” Dean quipped. “Madison Square Garden, ’73. Best that Zepp ever was.”
For a long moment, Castiel regarded Dean before picking his sandwich back up and taking a small, thoughtful bite. He chewed, swallowed, and then looked back at Dean almost sheepishly as he put his lunch back down.
“I gotta get back and deal with Cole, that’s for sure.” Bobby’s face was dark and hard.
“I’m going to get the tripod set up with the Nikon, then I’ll take my smaller camera and get some handheld shots of the courtyard side of the building,” Sam was saying, his thoughts clearly in a very different place than Dean’s.
, or check out my
One hand on the wheel, Sam quickly held up his phone. The lock screen featured a beautiful zoom-in of Dean’s open mouth, hanging slack above the shoulder seam of Castiel’s t-shirt. “Beautiful photography,” Sam said, “I should’ve recruited Cas for my side of the camera instead.”
“Are you crying?” Dean whispered into Castiel’s ear, grinning.
Claire grinned, her blonde waves bouncing as she shook her head. “No, no. Dean is our local builder. We’re hardly big enough for him to make a whole living, so he picks up hours at his uncle Bobby’s store when he’s not on sites. But, on top of that, he’s also a volunteer firefighter.”
There—suspended in his own pink gunk—rested Dean’s brother.
Dean’s mouth snapped shut. Hell, he couldn’t say anything to that. Though if Castiel thought that he was the only messed up person here, he was totally wrong.
Castiel didn’t do much better; Dean felt a soft puff of air between them as Castiel’s lips moved, too fractional for Dean to make out a word, but then he felt the pad of Castiel’s forefinger tracing the outline of his lower lip languidly, sweeping across sensitive, kiss-swollen skin and settling into the little dip above his chin.
“Hey,” Dean said, awkwardly stepping forward. “I’m Dean, Dean Winchester.”
from being a leather-clothing type of person, but these events lent themselves to the extra drama. Plus, he knew he looked good; Balthazar was always a reliable critic on that front. Placing his hands on the table, Castiel folded them, waiting for the sub to be done with his perusal of the waiver. “Do you have a name you would prefer me to use while we talk? I’m happy to answer to ‘Sir’ during scenes, but Castiel is fine for negotiation and aftercare.”
Dean heard in the back of his head, a distant echo.
Castiel smiled, turning to grasp the spatula and poke at the bacon while Dean stepped up behind him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. Once the bacon was flipped, Castiel turned in his arms to sign.
“To us,” Castiel echoed softly before turning to press his lips to Dean’s cheek.
“Thank you,” he panted, his voice rasping. “Thank you, Sir.”
He checked on the phone.
And they began to kiss again. Castiel felt like the teenager he never got the chance to be, and he couldn't believe Dean wasn't tired of him yet.
need to know if...”
Then he remembered the guy was probably talking to him, because now he was staring at him as well, so he roughly said.
He was also glad he could sometimes stare at him without him noticing.
“I believe I have reservation for two for tonight?”
He had to talk to Sam; tell him everything. He'd promised Castiel he would. But maybe he had to talk to Lisa first? Was he going to tell her any of this?
For a second, he just whished he could meet his past self and punch him right in the gut.
Still, it was Dean asking. He couldn't say no, he'd never do that.
As the last lyrics were sung, he inched closer until there was barely any space left between his and Castiel’s mouth. He looked into his eyes, searching for any sign that this was okay, but Castiel was simply still, the only thing moving visibly was his chest as if he also had lost control on his lungs.
He saw him scanning through the pages, quickly reading everything he was going to do as a tourist. He seemed actually interested.
“I... I know I'm a total stranger, and so you are to me, but you seem very tired so I thought I could give you a ride to the hotel. I have parked my car here.”
“Hello”
“I was just wondering if you could point me to professor Novak office direction:”
“Heya, Cas.”
“I kept procrastinating it.”
“Shit, sorry.”
There were two students that looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there.
“I think you’re okay with being
“Dean! You okay there?”
He tried not to show his feelings, and apparently he was a great actor because Sam didn't stop talking.
Castiel kissed Dean's back one last time, and rolled off him. They were both on their sides, facing each other. Both in the post orgasm, breathing softly, none of them daring to ruin the moment with words.
“Right now?” He asked, his tone both hopeful and playful, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh as he pulled him in for another kiss.
“Well, peperoni in italian means, like, peppers, the vegetable, so not really...”
If Castiel had caught him staring, he didn’t show it and, to be honest, Dean didn’t really care. This, right there, was the very fantasy that had kept him company every night before falling asleep. It took everything in him not to snap a picture. Or reach out his hand and run it through Castiel’s hair. Or rest it on his thigh.
“Do you want me to take a picture with yours?”
there were some rowing boats.
“Sì, grazie”
He checked his phone for the millionth time: it was 7:54 pm. He wanted to text Dean, because what if he was waiting for him to text him to get down? But at the same time, what if he never actually planned on going out, and thought Castiel was kidding? Then it would be awkward.
“Got some news to celebrate, can't wait to see you! Love you.”
Caught in his memories, he almost lost his stop. He got off the train and walked a little until he was in front of the main entrance of the university. Surrounded by much younger people, he went straight to the first info point he found.
As he poured some lube on his hand, he kept asking.
“Cassie!” He smiled hearing his sister's voice. She was the one he had missed the most.
“That's a very agreeable decision. Will it work for me too?”
“Dean, what the hell?”
He was now moving his hand between his buttcheeks, teasing the hole.
“I don’t know Jo, I just want to lay here for the next month.”
Dean laughed and Castiel was glad he was responsible for that wonderful scene.
His face wasn't going to be the young one he remembered, yet his eyes couldn't have changed. He really hoped they didn't; and not just their color, but their sparkle, their intensity, their ability to see through lies and fake. He wasn't sure he was prepared to face all of that: he should have spent more time to consider what he was getting into.
as a compliment.”
“Sure, put that in your vows for the wedding you’re already planning”
He’d originally decided to wait and do what he needed to do after they’d spent some time together, but now that they were here he couldn’t focus on anything else and his anxiety was already trying to get him to abort the mission.
“You sure?”

Completely baffled by the interaction, Dean only knew one thing for sure. What he was feeling now? Totally
“What do you say about a walk in a park?”
“Isn't that a Pepperoni?”
This fic won't be very long, as the story takes place in about 10 days. But it will be part of a series, if I manage to find enough time to write it.
As he was about to open his laptop to watch something,
Castiel felt immediately angry with her, even though he had no right: the poor girl just found Dean attractive, he couldn't blame her for that and she didn't deserve him staring at her like that.
Once again, his body decided how to move before his mind.
He smiled at Dean, but started to panic. He didn't know what to say. Was he boring him?
Jo turned around, figuring what had caught Dean’s attention.
No, his texts were more innocent than a virgin teenage girl's, so much that he was almost ashamed. He's used to being more forward, but here it looked like Castiel was his only chance to know someone and he didn't want to screw it up.
“Come on, you know we gotta do this stuff together. And you know a lot of fans in the audience would love to get a closer look at this handsome face.”
“So, uhm, you were planning on going somewhere?”
Damn it, he felt like he had completely forgotten every single English word he knew.
Dean nodded and finally turned to sit facing the steering wheel again.
“New York? Can I come too?” had begged Lisa, but he made up a lie about how he had looked forward to spend some alone time with his brother. It wasn't really a lie, but they both knew that excuse didn't stand and no one tried to discuss it again.
Still, once he got out of his skates and changed to summer appropriate clothes, he waited for Jo outside the girls’ room.
The walk was nice and he took his time to appreciate it: the streets were characteristic and bright, the people were from all around the world, and hearing bits of so many different languages somehow helped him to spend time with himself. It was a strange feeling, of alienation and meditation at the same time. He hadn't felt carefree in so long, he had forgotten how it felt like. Some girls would sometimes smile at him, and he would smile back, enjoying these little pleasures.
It was very rare to have the house all by himself and the absolute peace he needed, so he knew it was wise of him to make the most of it. He knew he should have studied so he wouldn't end up behind on the schedule once the exams were due.
His attention was only captured by a couple of guys sitting next to each other, discussing summer plans and talking about each others families' possible reaction to their proposal of spending the whole month together. They weren't worried, just being realistic about their parents apprehension. They were pretty young to travel by themselves.
It had been almost two months: not wanting to ruin anyone's Thanksgiving or Christmas, the last time they had met in person had been on Halloween, when they spent the entire evening at the park (masks on) with the rest of their friends. Before that, he and Cas had managed to meet each other at least once a month, month and a half, depending on the number of cases in their area. It had happened much more frequently to meet him and the rest of their friends in the summer, as it was easier to find something to do safely outside. Still, he missed Castiel every single day, he missed him even,
“I would love to go out again with you, but I
“He always tells his students or colleague he doesn't know well, to make appointments at least three hours earlier. He's very strict about that.”
“Have you told your wife?” And God, if it cut like a blade the way he said wife.
"I, mh... it's complicated, being a christian. But I'm not in the closet."
Castiel arrived at 3:20 because he didn't want to make Dean wait, but he found him already sitting on the stairs under the
“I am doing well, very well, thank you. I'm a literature professor, but you evidently already knew that.”
The dinner was lovely. They shared the appetizer, sometimes reaching the plate at the same time and touching the other's hand. Dean was delighted to find out the pizza he was going to eat all by himself wasn't small, but normal size. Also, as soon as he took the first bite, he moaned in a way that completely crashed Castiel's system, starting every single alarm in his mind and his body. As if that wasn't enough, their legs were practically touching by then and Dean didn't seem to mind. Castiel eventually relaxed on the language issue and started talking more directly and instinctively, even if that meant some grammar mistakes. Dean didn't seem to mind that either. Actually, he seemed to be enjoying himself and what he was eating. He told Castiel he'd been at the Vatican Museum that day, so he could already check it on the list.
“It was perfect.”
“Shut up.”
Cas's hand was cold, as usual, while Dean's whole body was boiling.
He would have loved to text back, but he knew they were both spending more than necessary to communicate.
He hadn't done this in ages: he had hooked up with a few guys after Cas before dating Lisa, but it was so down in the past, that now he was afraid he'd made a complete fool of himself.
Looking down at him, Castiel’s brain short-circuited.
Dean grimaced at his reflection in the mercurial mirror above the washstand across the room. He was rather wont to think that the title of “Earl” didn’t suit him well. He’d been more comfortable as “Colonel,” if he was really honest about it.
The electronic jukebox over near the tiny karaoke stage was easy to operate, and with every popular offering for the last three hundred and fifty years loaded onto it, there was something for everyone. Dean had no idea what kind of music Castiel liked—culture of any kind seemed entirely lost on him—so he scrolled through and queued up a selection of classics.
“You can’t tell Cas. Not yet.”
Do you think Dean's plan to help Cas is going to go how he hopes?
There was something happening here, some kind of
, and I'd urge you to give it a try even if you think that fics from that era aren't your thing, because I'm hoping the supernatural adventure and enemies-to-friends-to-lovers soft boys will keep you interested ;) After that, next week, I have my fic for SPN MBB coming up, which is a Destiel fic based on the cheesy Netflix movie "Falling Inn Love".
“So?” Dean said, feeling like he was missing something. “It’ll just be a few minutes in the elevator, no big deal.”
Luckily, Dean had one friend.
Castiel got up and moved to Dean’s other side, beginning to trowel away the top layer of dirt into a bucket near Dean’s feet. “Something’s disturbed the ground here,” he said mildly, dropping another trowel full of sand and roots down.
“Pain passes,” Dean pointed out.
It’s still
“Did you want something, Winchester?” MEG asked testily.
Dean complained.
Castiel stood in front of Dean, to the doctor’s left, and signed along as she spoke.
Dean squinted up through the severe illumination to see Castiel’s concerned face peering down at him. He looked different than he had a minute ago, somehow. His hair looked more uncombed and just-fucked than usual, there were dark bags beneath his eyes, a darker swathe of stubble, and he was wearing…
Castiel drew his eyebrows together in annoyance, turning to take in the sight of the man whose car he’d assaulted. He gulped. Oh…damn.
Dean reached down into the hot, tight space between them, wrapping his hand around Castiel’s cock. His palm was slick with sweat and lube, and Castiel let out an open-mouthed whimper at the feeling of Dean’s thick fingers circling beneath his cock head, squeezing and pulling in time with his thrusts.
“But you still love me anyway, yeah?” Dean teased, before squinting at Castiel through the darkness and checking, “Right?”
Dean couldn’t even remember what it was—he thought he’d clicked on
Flirting with Castiel was fun, and new, and
Dean drove, of course. His knee was still jiggling, just as it had on the journey up to The Lucky Elephant, though he couldn’t quite as easily work out the source of his unease.
“Well, there is one thing,” Anna admitted with a grin. “I walk into a lot of light poles when I’m signing instead of watching where I’m going.”
Frustrated, Dean stuck his hands forward deep into the projection of the ship, and then drew his hands apart, stretching the image out, trying to blow it up in size but instead succeeding in nothing more than making it ping around the table like a rubber ball before it settled back to center.
Once Dean was finally alone, his trunks and lunch brought up to him and the door shut against the party preparations beyond, he sank down into his mattress with a sigh. He’d rest until he had to dress for the party. Dean had never been one to employ a valet, preferring to dress himself—but he supposed that would be expected of him now, as an Earl.
Dean’s eyes jerked up sharply from his letter, to see the burly Duke’s son gesturing to the pages in Dean’s hand with a warm smile.
The way that Castiel could be a little possessive in the bedroom, while being the furthest thing from it outside of the sheets, only added to how incredibly, scorchingly hot their sex life was fast becoming.
Dean threw his backpack down onto the old, battered couch in the break room, rolling his shoulders. He felt his bones creaking; did school textbooks really have to weigh so much? Never mind cost so much—why wasn’t everything just online already, anyway?
When Dean guided Baby into the sitka spruce forest, he felt like he’d only been on the road for seven or eight hours…but the sun was rising, making a liar of his own perception.
Dean’s small gulp was audible, and his voice rough when he came back with a question of his own. “Say that you mean that, that you were interested in the diner—what about now? What if I didn’t want to leave?”
“Really?” Castiel asked skeptically.
A tingle of pleasure and relief ran up Castiel’s spine.
Something tightened in Dean’s chest, and when his lips parted, no words came out. How did Michael know about the strange connection that he and Castiel had always had? The one that Dean had labelled, years ago, and hid from, and that Castiel had… Well, Dean feared that Castiel had simply never felt or seen it in the same way that Dean did.
Hello, friends!
“Oh for fuck’s sake.” Dean leaned his palms down onto the desk closest for him, letting his head sag forward between his arms for a moment—at least until his hip-towel slipped and he had to scramble to preserve his modesty.
He caught his shoulder on the doorframe. A small, sharp pain bloomed through his bicep, but he ignored it, and shoved his way into the crowded hall.
Twisting his head just a fraction upward, so that he could look back at Dean from the side of his eye, Castiel gave a tiny nod.
Resting his gaze on Dean for much longer than felt quite polite—though Dean certainly wasn’t about to complain—Castiel’s tongue flicked out to collect a gleaming streak of cinnamony sugar from his lower lip. “You’re a surprising man, Dean.”
They both tried to step out of the double door at the same time, and somehow managed to knock their towel-clad hips and bare shoulders together in the middle, both letting out huffs of annoyance.
Gabriel smiled like it was a compliment, beginning to swish the brush around. “First date, though?” he asked. “How’s that work?”
“What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? I wasn’t expecting you for several more days—not that I’m complaining.”
The cheer that went up as the ribbon fell only increased when Fatback dove forward, grabbing the end of the silky material with surprising agility, and trotted off down the aisle between the seats with it, like an incredibly pleased flower girl at a wedding.
Charlie didn’t try to follow.
In the bathtub was a man.
When the sun had finally fully risen after that long night and early morning, Dean had extracted himself from Castiel’s heavy limbs—quite octopus-like, when he slept as a human—and called Sam, let him know that the spell had been a success. Then he’d made coffee, crawled back under the sheets, and told Castiel everything.
Charlie walked in only a few minutes later, after dropping Dorothy off over at the theater department. She idly kicked Dean’s foot and threw him a wink on the way past. “Don’t fall asleep,” she said, glaring teasingly. “Adler will be pissed if I have to come wake you up.”
They'd get to the point where Cas's thrusts were strong and fast, and Dean would arch and push his hips toward Cas, making room for the guy's hand to go under and touch him, with strokes coordinated with his thrusts. Dean moans were louder, and Cas kept kissing his back and his neck, whispering sometimes sweet and sometimes filthy things in his ear.
But that particular day, both of them seemed to have forgotten how to land a jump
Before going out, he had thought there were only two ways the evening could go: either Castiel was a lonely guy who just wanted to befriend him, or he intended it to be a date as well and they would end up in his hotel room.
“Come on, one last twist and then we go put our skates on”
“How… why the tik tok?”
He’d been thinking, lately, about how unfair it all was: this wasn’t supposed to be a one time, special occasion type of thing thing. They were supposed to ride to school together, this being the first year Dean had his driving license. They were supposed to have a playlist Dean would make a mixtape out of, Castiel was supposed to steal as many minutes of sleep as possible in the morning, they were supposed to wait for each other at school and then ride back home, complaining about their homework and…
Are you interested on the tourist part of the fic, with photos and description? (the photos are taken from internet)
. I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry. For what is worth, if I could, I'd never do the same mistakes. I seriously regret them. I-”
Rome, 20
Also, please, any kind of feedback is pure gold to me.
Castiel finally smiled at that, and oh,
He wasn't going to be the only one so painfully horny, he decided.
“San Francisco? That's so cool. I've always wanted to go there. Or any other place in America in general.”
Deciding to fly in wasn't easy, but he couldn't take more days off work only to avoid his silly fear.
“Or I could give you a ride.”
Memories mixing with the ones from the past. Castiel's hands on his body.
He eventually got to Times Square and decided that would be it for the day. He didn't like it. Too many people, everyone minding their own buissness. And he was on his own too, but that didn't stop him from looking where he was going and avoiding to run into strangers.
“Wait, let me pay at least my ticket back, if not the ride. I mean, that too.”
Well, Castiel didn't expect
How could he blame him?
It's not like his life stopped after Castiel, it's not like he couldn't function without that overrated closure. Yes, he sometimes dreamed what their life would have been if he made different choices, but his mind was very capable to send all of that in the denial part of his conscience, and he could have gotten by just like that.
This was not a new fight, this was a continuation of a silent argument that had been going on for the past three years, when they realized they had a different perspective on the concept of success.
“What is that?”
Dean didn't move either, and they stared at each other for a few, endless seconds, when suddenly Castiel realized Dean was probably waiting for an answer and he felt like a complete idiot.
“Hello, were you looking for me? I don't believe we've met.”
The idea of not having to face the consequences of his actions calmed him a little, and he managed to drive safely, without running his car into someone else's.
And well, that was a fair question. Dean should have expected that, or better, he should have managed to explain himself before getting to that question.
“Hello, Dean. How are you?”
“What, a 45 old man can't have a career?”
Castiel slowly entered the first finger. Dean held his breath, trying not to think about the slight burn he was feeling. Suddenly, memories from their first time crashed his mind once more; they were in the same exact position, but with the roles reversed. He used to be very careful on making it as pleasurable as possible for Cas, and the nostalgia made him almost sick.
His brain was in total confusion and he didn't know how to act and in what order.
As always, any type of feedback is much appreciated ❤︎
They started slowly and Castiel took his time to enjoy Dean's sweet touch, brushing their lips together. Then Dean gently pushed with his tongue Castiel's lips, and he open his mouth, allowing him in.
Castiel laughed “Oh, I won't. But thanks anyway.”
The girls kept talking, and he saw them passing each other what looked like printed photos, and they were probably commenting them, almost screaming.
“Are you in the closet?”
“Cas, I'm... I...”
“I'm going to tell Sam about us. I don't know if about today too, but surely about our relationship.”
Maybe he just needed these few days alone to set his mind straight and once he'd come back, he'd be ready to make things right. He felt a rush of positive energy and mentally blessed Lisa for being so patient with him. He was going to be husband of the year from now on.
Castiel tugged Dean in further and further, until he had to stand up from his knees and wade right in. Only then did Castiel let Dean’s hand go, diving under the water ahead of him and resurfacing a few feet later. He beckoned; his motion outlined in blue.
Dean blinked, staring at Castiel’s tail. Along his dorsal line, from his butt down to his silky tail fin, dots of beautiful blue glowed in the moonlight, rippling down his body in enchanting patterns. Other dots spread around his hips, yet more across the front of him, near his tail.
“Cas, you bring a PB&J to school for lunch every damn day. I think I can work it out. Besides,” Dean paused and nudged his knee against Castiel’s as he let his temple flop onto the wall, supporting his head. “I want to know real things about you, Cas—I want to get to know you, the you inside, not the superficial parts.”
“So,” the man forged on, unaware of Castiel’s floundering, it seemed, “Ash is who you’re gonna need. He knows his stuff. He lives in an RV on the other side of the field behind the Roadhouse Café, I know you know where that is. Don’t mind how trashed the place looks, I promise you he’s sober enough to get it done.”
“Dean?”
“No, just a pig,” Castiel grumbled.
Dean didn’t
There was a smile in Castiel’s voice as he said, “Well, now, that is lovely news. I’m going to leave these sweet little panties on, too…Maybe if you can take it hard enough, I can see the imprint of the lace on your skin when I’m done.”
At least it was a pretty kind of nowhere, he decided.
Castiel’s lips formed, “Oh,” but his hands were frozen.
,” Castiel breathed out, pressing his lips to Dean’s forehead, “you could never do that.”
“Alright,” he said, voice shaky. “How much are we talking?”
deserve was to have your magic taken from you in the first place.”
From a neat, black laptop bag that was hung over her shoulder, Hannah pulled out a slim laptop just like the one Castiel used. She settled it on the tiny arm desk and fired it up, calm and efficient, as if nothing was wrong.
What it might make him worry had happened.
Castel’s brain unhelpfully provided.
“Current medications?”
,” Dean said pointedly, “and then head out to go get my tools for measuring the length of pipe we’ll need for the graywater recycling?”
Out of the window, behind Castiel, Dean could see that the storm had gotten even worse. Great. He was supposed to head to Charlie’s place to help her with her new LARPing costume—he was going to look like a wet poodle by the time he got there. Fuck that and fuck this day. He’d text and cancel.
When a single tear gleaned in the yellowy, dim light, Castiel couldn’t help but reach out. He was cautious, wrapping his arms around Dean carefully, giving Dean space to refuse. He pulled Dean into his chest where he sat on the arm of the chair before him. Dean let him, though, and for a brief moment, he buried his face in Castiel’s shirt.
“Is there a place close by where I could get a sandwich to go, and maybe some coffee?” Castiel asked, finally breaking their stare and standing up from his seat. “I came with Anna partly for moral support, but also because I had some errands to run—one of which should probably be getting some lunch.”
Castiel frowned, his hand stilling as he moved to break the last of the chocolate in half for Dean. “That isn’t right at all.”
Thank you, as always, for reading.
“Thank you,” Dean said quietly.
Watching as the sun gave its last for the day, turning the whole cove golden, Dean resumed his humming, picking back up an old love song, just for Castiel.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean wanted to lean forward and trail his lips up the long line of Castiel’s neck, let them catch on his skin so that he could feel the vibration of the groan he knew Castiel must be letting out against his own mouth.
Bodies moved around Dean—some sinuously, some purely drunkenly—and for a moment, Dean worried. He liked music, sure, but unless he had a pretty good idea of the beat it was hard for him to pull off anything truly resembling rhythm.
He was a tall man given that he looked so weaselly—probably a couple of inches taller than Dean, even. Not that Dean wasted much time standing close to the guy. He tried to stay out of his bug-eyed gaze as much as possible, not wanting to tempt fate. Overinflated, middle-aged asshat Zachariah Adler had taken a distinct dislike to Dean since the very first day of class, when Castiel had stood up for Dean over the first minor seating issue.
offered his hand, and Dean immediately shook it.
That's why when Dean called on Christmas day in junior year, Castiel didn't expect anything besides a courtesy call.
For the day, his brother had planned a long walk, with no particular task. Only a first look at the city. The exit led him in a very short street that ended in a big square, the famous
“Pronto?”
, your English's more than fine.”
“You watched us skate?” Dean asked back, too much in disbelief of what was happening to simply say ‘
He smirked at the judges, knowing Jo was smiling seductively at them as well, and the first note of their music hit.
He was now moving his fingers enough, but a little teasing couldn't hurt.
He finished at 8:15 pm, and went back in his room. Now that he had nothing to do, he could take a look at his mail, right?
He could physically feel the wet air choking him.
He made his way back to Sam's place, took a shower and turned on the tv, waiting for his brother to come back home.
He went back to the hotel around 6 pm, took a shower and lay on his bed. He was going to have dinner at the hotel restaurant, but he needed to rest a little. As soon as he turned on the wi fi on his phone, the thoughts of his life caught up and he wasn't sure he was prepared for that. There were tons of unread mails, all from work, and he felt the urge to open them. But he decided not to; he was on vacation, his boss had told him that he deserved it, and he didn't have to answer to work mails right away. It could wait.
August, 2016
“So I should pay attention to the lyrics?”
He was still surprised by Dean's beauty, like whenever he saw him for the first time after awhile: not that he could forget it, but it was always new and fresh. He smelled heavenly, like the day before.
He didn't underline the stress part too much, even though it was the reason he was in Italy in the first place.
“Ready?”
“Hi Cas.”
He cleaned himself, enjoying the fact he could walk around naked, and checked his phone, still in his good mood.
That’s also why when he went back to the hotel after Castiel’s performance and immediately re-watched it on youtube, he didn’t think too much of it.
“Thank you so much, Cas, I owe you one”
“Fine, mum, I told you. Buon Ferragosto to you too”
“I'm 31.”
“Siete pronti per ordinare?”
Now they were standing in close, with Dean's bag between them, and they were trying not to look at each other. Dean tried really hard not to look at Castiel's eyes, but it was the last time he was going to see them, so he might as well take the risk.
Castiel.
He hoped watching low quality shows would stop him from thinking about what he'd done, but he had no such luck.
“I know that.” She said looking down, too proud to offer more than that.
He saw Cas closing his eyes and biting his lip, and he hadn't even started yet.
“Let’s do the lift from before, come on.”
Dean smiled back, took the ticket and made a mental note to pay the guy as soon as they were on the tube. They passed through the turnstiles, and took the tube. The guy must have noticed how tired he was, because he had an almost sympathetic look on his face. Dean wasn't offended, though. Had there been Sam with him, he would have reacted better to the travel, but being all by himself on the plane, he had to hold on to every inch of his own strenght.
“We still need to fuck.”
“So, how are you doing?”
“Thank you. I also saw your free skate, you were incredible.”
Castiel shrugged. “I didn't know if you felt like doing it.”
He was about to reach Jo, who was already chatting with one of the Canadian ladies, when he heard a deep, unfamiliar voice calling “Hello”.
Something that had come up a couple of times, something they had quickly swept under the rug, too afraid of the consequences it could have on their partnership.
“Of course I feel the same. Dean, I...”
* * *
He decided he was going to try text him, but not right away. He needed topics for conversation, so he grabbed his backpack and left the hotel.
“Hey, Cas”
Okay so almost a year passed since I started this fic and I'm so sorry, senior year of high school happened (which in Italy is the fifth because of course four weren't enough for us) and I got super busy. I can finally relax now and I hope I'll finish writing this pretty quickly: here's an easy chapter to get back to the story, expect smut.
Right after that, Dean thought Castiel’s eyes had spotted him in the crowd. Whether he was imagining things or not (
It was one of those ‘bad days’, where nothing seemed to go right: Jo had been working on her triple lutz to add as a throw jump, while Dean had been working on his triple flip so that they could upgrade their side by side sequence.
“Excuse me, Lord Armstrong, ladies,” Dean bowed apologetically to the group Castiel was standing with. “I simply must steal my steward away from you for a moment.”
A horrific thunderstorm cracked open the sky above the casino, and a deep rumble ran through the ground under their feet that took Dean straight back to several years past, when curling bursts of Darkness had begun to invade the world.
“No!” The words burst out of Castiel a little too fast, leaving him wide eyed, his gaze fixed on Dean. After a fat second, he took a breath and added, “No, not at all. That’s not—Not even a little bit.”
brother.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighed heavily.
Castiel gave Dean a small smile, stepping up to the couch to stand in front of him. “It’s fine, Dean. And you’re right, maybe it was. Sam, he told me that—well, he mentioned you’d been alone for a long time. It makes sense now.”
, Castiel’s fingers like brands—the amulet they held felt like ice, it’s metal clinging to Dean’s skin like frost on a winter’s morning.
Dean blinked.
Sam gave Castiel an odd little smile, regarding him for a long minute. His fingers played almost nervously with the edges of his teacup, and he looked thoughtful, as if trying to decide whether to say anything else or leave the revelations as they were. It took a long moment, but eventually he spoke up, soft and sad.
“Hello, Dean,” he murmured, suddenly looking nervous again.
Dean took some deep breaths, trying to tamp down the panic that still swirled in his stomach.
sideline Cas, but he wasn’t going to; this was Cas’s fight, too.
“Cas had a lot of good things to say about you, and I saw your work on his car; that’s why I recommended you. I don’t think you have anything to worry about.”
He was directly opposite the door. Instead of leaning casually against the wall or something, like a normal person, Castiel stood stiffly with his hands in his coat pockets, totally immobile, with the wrinkled sleeves of his trench coat bunching around his wrists. As soon as Dean spotted him, he raised one hand in an awkward wave and stepped forward, cutting the space between them in a couple of steps.
“Hello, Dean,” came Castiel’s deep rumble. “I hope you don’t mind me contacting you outside of work. I realize it's a little untoward. I just wanted to see how you were doing.”
“Good luck with finals,” she signed before walking out of the room, ramrod straight.
As for Dean himself, he didn’t fit quite as well. His clunky boots and plaid stood out a little in this cutesy town where most of the men wore suits and the ladies somehow always looked like they were going to church, even at the grocery store. But Dean was fine. He hadn’t moved here to make friends.
There was a tiny, white fleck of grout tangled in Dean’s four-day stubble at the bolt of his jaw. Castiel desperately fought down the urge to reach up and dust it from his skin and press his lips to the place it had been.
Deep breaths.
“I, uh,” Dean said eloquently. He was sure he could tell Sam what had happened, and he was fairly sure that Sam wouldn’t judge him. Moderately sure that Sam would sympathize, would probably even say he saw it coming. But damn, talking was hard.
“So, you’re hiding it from him just to avoid the argument.”
He didn’t have time to get out anything else before Sam smashed the sphere at his feet.
“Yeah, I’ll get it,” Dean said, sidestepping to pull the beans from the cupboard to Castiel’s left.
the ultimate predator. Unless he got into a personal dispute with a  bull shark, he didn’t have many issues down here. To lure in food? Castiel hunted by stealth, from what Dean knew. So maybe it was—
A pair of dirty work boots like Castiel had only ever seen in porn led up to a pair of beaten wrangler jeans, which showed off two adorably bowed legs. Above that, an army green t-shirt smudged with paint and salted sweat stains bore a logo that read
Castiel looked so fantastically disheveled, Dean had to look away rather than make a fool of himself. Nodding his agreement, Dean hauled himself back up into Baby’s saddle. “A good idea. I hope you don’t mind my visiting so unexpectedly.”
The proprietor of Singer’s Hardware store (Oh, sure,
But the phone rang again.
A new fic is rolling out right after this one:
Black, burnt out eyes took up the faces of the four men. Their expressions were oddly peaceful, no pain, no torture; accepting of whatever had happened to them. Beyond the black, pieces of blown-out wiring and metal were visible beneath their skin. Smoke stains streaked their faces, sooting their hair. They were all dressed in officer’s uniforms, the white a stark contrast to the horrific sight of their faces.
“You knew I was going to sell the inn, Dean,” Castiel threw back, confused by Dean's wild mood change and suddenly angry too—at Dean, at Balthazar, at everyone who kept insisting he go there, do this, stay here, don’t do that. “Is that what you’re so mad about?”
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” the older man said amiably, offering his hand. “We just don’t get a lot of new people, is all. I’m Bobby, Bobby Singer. This is mine and Rufus’ store.”
“Yeah.” Dean’s eyes blinked heavily. “Most people don’t want to live with ghosts. I can’t blame them.”
They moved steadily on through hand jobs, anal sex, rimming, vibrators used on a partner, and butt plugs. Double penetration (oral and anal) and Double penetration (both anal) were instant yeses for Dean—nothing to be embarrassed about there, Castiel was well aware of how much Dean loved to be stretched out. Fisting was a slightly shyer yes on Dean’s part, but Castiel simply squeezed his knee under the table and told him to go ahead and check it off.
The reminder of how hard this was without Castiel, of exactly why he’d dropped out last time, only made Dean’s mood worse. He liked working with Cas. He was awesome. But he hated feeling like he
Take care of yourselves, and each other, folks.

with it, after all.
It was Castiel’s way or the highway, now.
“I felt that,” Amara said, her voice low and dangerous as her eyes flicked down to Castiel’s arm. “I felt my brother be ripped away, felt the familiar stain of that ancient magic on the world…some of the first magic, you know. Tapping into forces that even now, humans don’t have names for, so powerful and primal you’ve yet to conceive of them at all…and yet, you people think that you can play with them, control them.”
Sir,” he responded gratefully.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean murmured, reaching back automatically to grab a handful of his ass.
Dean sped past the dumb, vintage-looking, ridiculously chirpy sign with its perfect family and mid-century lettering, stomping his foot down on Baby’s accelerator so that she let out a spiteful growl. He pulled his hand back in through the window; flipping off the sign was petty but, in his defense, he’d only had one coffee so far that morning.
“And you knew where I’d be, because…”
Luckily, with all the help he had from the local community of Bellbird Valley, Castiel’s list was short. He and Dean had everything mapped out already, they had done for weeks, and he had Meg here to stand around and look threatening if things went off the rails.
“I’m sorry.”
“Just amused by how well prepared you are,” Dean admitted.
Dr. Shurley and his colleagues had all started talking amongst themselves again—after all, Castiel’s awkward, embarrassing behavior was nothing new to them, so they let him get on with it. Castiel wasn’t sure if that was humiliating in its own right, or if he was just glad not to have an audience.
Pursing his lips quietly, the guy nodded and took a slow step back. “Yep, yeah, got it. You, uh, relax on your own schedule.”
“Okay?” Castiel held Dean’s gaze. Electricity crackled between them and Castiel couldn’t tell how much of it was challenge and how much of it was lust.
Dean dropped down to one knee silently, the ring perched on his damp palm. He saw the moment when Castiel
“Fuck?” said Dean hopefully.
“You like this show?” Dean asked, opening the pizza boxes on the coffee table. (One meat and one four cheese—because he hadn’t known if Castiel had a preference, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to order a vegetable pizza.)
“Well,” Dean said with a wry laugh, “there really ain’t that many options, not in Charming Acres. And like hell am I going for a date at the diner where I work. So, how’d you feel about coming over to my place? I cook. Don’t get a chance to, not much, but”—a little of the confidence ebbed out of Dean’s voice and his tone became a hopeful whisper—“I’d like to cook for you, Cas.”
“This can’t be good.”
“Makes sense.”
in the city with Castiel, but Cas would never torture his oldest acquaintance like that.
“Oh, fuck off,” he grumbled.
“And?”
“A very odd term. Luckily, one that’s exclusive to only a few species—not my own, though structurally, our genitals are very similar.” Castiel wiggled onto his side, looking down at Dean as he lay on his back, and began idly trailing his fingers across the three-day stubble under Dean’s jaw.
be the dildo guy again.
Amara gave Michael a little shrug. “Who knows. It’s irrelevant, now. I’m free, and I’ve changed. What question do you have for me?”
He ran his hands down his face, rolling his eyes up to the gathering clouds above. “This is dumb,” he announced to himself. “But here I am anyway.”
“He’ll be out on his ass before the day is over.” Bobby’s chest puffed out, and Dean could see him working up into a rant. “There’s a reason we have a flawless safety ~~ at my shop, and that’s because everybody does their part. We have hazard lights! It ain’t hard! Everybody knows. There’s a hazard, hit the button. A preschooler could handle it. And Cole is no rookie—he should have ~~ that button the moment he spilled that oil, and he knows that. The only reason he didn’t is because he’s lazy and he just don’t care.”
“Dean,” Castiel echoed similarly, a smile breaking out across his face which Dean only saw for an instant but felt for a little longer, as Castiel shyly pressed his mouth to Dean’s own.
Huffing air out angrily, Dean dismissed them and shoved his phone back into his jeans. He rubbed his jaw roughly and refocused on Adler.
When they both fell asleep, clean and warm and tangled into each other, Castiel’s heart still felt like it was beating a little too fast.
Yes, I am. I’m just working on material for my classes next week.
Dean held up his hands placatingly, though he couldn’t control the small eyeroll and disbelieving huff that escaped him. “And we sure won’t be, with that attitude. Has it occurred to you,
“Dean!” Castiel reached out to touch Dean’s elbow, grabbing a handful of soft, thin plaid. “Instagram is not a good reason to be late for a flight.”
“I am not giving up on Cas!” Dean shouted, getting up in Michael’s face without a second thought. His fist clenched—but then loosened, the fight flowing out of his tired body almost instantly. “I—I can’t. I can’t give up on Cas.”
“Yes,” Gabriel said after a moment, a small, smirking smile curling up one corner of his lip into a crooked, amused expression once more. “You can try. I think… I think you might even have it in you.”
There's a lot of them to work through, but I think I sense the beginnings of trust and fluff, folks...
“I’m sorry,” Castiel interrupted, his eyes open again, a little too wide. He signed much faster than Dean was used to, something frantic and embarrassed about it, and Dean had to take a step back to focus on his movements. “This is—I’m so bad at this, I have no idea what I’m doing and I just wanted to know—”
The pool had a permanent spot next to Dean’s recliner, and from his watery seat, Castiel got the beginnings of a pop culture education.
Gabriel waved, before turning his attention back to Castiel. “Remember,” he signed, tapping his thumb up to his forehead.
Dean ducks down the last inch, pressing their foreheads together again, bumping his nose along the side of Castiel’s, following his tear tracks down until he finds his lips. They press together shakily, just once, crossing the line with the softest brush. Dean pulls back, his eyes searching Castiel’s, checking.
“Well, no one else can fix it. You’re the only Engineer I have to work with.”
“Fuck, Sir…” Dean mumbled down into the end of the bench, his eyes squeezed tightly shut with tears pricking at them after a particularly sharp smack. “Feels so good, Sir.”
Slowly, Dean reached down to grab his old, army surplus backpack from the floor and robotically packed up his stuff.
Once he straightened back up he smoothed his tie—it was still wonky, but he tried—and turned back to Dean, returning to his tiny, professional half-smile. “So,” he asked, “what made you choose Engineering for your degree? You’ve never said.”
Warm and content, Dean peered down at him for a few moments, letting his chest swell and buzz as much as it wanted. And it wanted, a lot. Maybe it was too soon to feel as intensely about Castiel as Dean did, but it had taken them so long to get here that he couldn’t care.
“Negotiation first,” Castiel agreed, pulling back the opposite chair. He reached down to pinch at the leather of his pants, helping them stretch over his rather ample thighs as he sat down. Day-to-day, Castiel was
, of all things.
Dean was incredibly proud and more than a little excited that, at least during school vacations, he could have his cameraman back.
“You’re beautiful,” Dean breathed out, kneeling onto the edge of the bed.
Dean tried to keep his eyes on the road, but they kept slipping up to the mirror, resting on Castiel. One of his hands hung out beneath the blanket, dangling next to his leg. Dean could barely tear his eyes from it—sometimes, it would twitch, and Castiel’s fist would clench, like he was in pain.
He should go. What he wanted, of course, was to talk to Dean again—have some kind of excuse to approach him and apologize for his awkwardness, see if maybe they could start afresh. But he had no good reason to interrupt Dean when he was having a good time with the adoring ladies of the staff.
Dean pulled his feet in toward the couch so that Garth could move past him as everyone filed out. Cole slammed the door behind himself dramatically; Dean felt the wall shake behind the couch.
But, he supposed, anything was possible when you were unquestionably, ridiculously in love.
“Cas! Right there—”
“Black tar.”
A straightforward one. People who can hear and their culture.
No, he couldn’t. “Accidentally” taking Dean’s Tupperware home so that he’d have an opportunity to stop by his room on Monday to return it was utterly insane.
Reinvigorated, Castiel fought with the plasticky handle of his cheap suitcase—purchased more for couples’ weekends than hauling his favorite books, bathroom items, and all of his clothes—and picked his way very carefully across the train tracks. He moved as fast as he could, just in case, though he had a strange feeling that there wouldn’t be any more trains coming for quite some time.

While Castiel talked about percentages for different cards, Dean subtly eased his chair back away from the camera. Reaching up, he shrugged his suit jacket from his shoulders. When his fingers moved up to his tie, Castiel paused.
“It’s just board game night, Dean,” Sam said for the third time.
dating advice?”
Holy shit.
The rest could come later.
Castiel wasn’t seated at the heavy wooden table that they used for research, but the thumping noise of a book dropping to the floor, as if Dean had startled him, revealed the angel’s presence in the stacks.
“Of course.” Castiel nodded as he spoke, even though Dean wasn’t looking up. Some submissives preferred to keep using “
“Yup, uh,” Dean cleared his throat swiftly. “Yeah. Definitely.”
“What?” came Dean’s muffled reply. “Can’t hear you—‘round here, living room window!”
Gathering up his dishes and the many coffee cups from his day of studying, Dean quickly stacked them in the dishwasher. Charlie’s place—now their place—had a really nice, open kitchen, with an amazing steel range and more storage than Dean knew what to do with. And it would certainly be Dean who did something with it, as Charlie had lived here since the summer and had yet to turn on the stove.
After a long, tense moment, Michael’s posture slumped just a fraction and his eyes widened. “Wow,” Adam said to Castiel, loosening up and grabbing a chunk of fried hush puppy dough from his plate. “You really pissed him off, huh?”
And he’d seen how furious it made Castiel that he reacted that way. How frustrated he was to be afraid.
Castiel shook his head. “Virgin,” he finger-spelled back, smirking. “Your choice.”
Castiel had this expression he made when Dean managed to surprise a laugh out of him. His eyes crinkled at the sides, making them hooded as they sparkled, and his startlingly white teeth were revealed behind his full, pillowy-looking lips. It was a look that always made Dean’s breath catch.
“I said what I said.”
The sound of a shotgun cocking cut off Sam’s reply.
He was still pondering when he stepped inside the cool, spacious store. It was surprisingly well stocked for a small town. The air within smelled of fresh-sawn wood and motor oil, and there was a quiet radio somewhere playing Elvis Presley songs.
“OINK!”
Once Castiel had filled his plate, he loitered awkwardly near the table, chewing his way through the exact same offerings they always had at these things: lukewarm green bean casserole, pineapple and cheese on sticks, burnt weenies, and pasta salad from a box. Around him, conversation buzzed—most of the Humanities folk were social butterflies, or at least better at all this than Castiel was.
“Dean, glad you could make it,” Ed greeted, remembering to turn toward Dean without any prompting. He reached out and shook Dean’s hand briefly before offering him a beer.
Dean answered Castiel, breathless and beaming.
Something wasn’t sitting right about Castiel’s lack of enthusiasm, but Dean focused in on the more important part. “Dude, you can’t decline
in between cheesin’ at the camera, Chief.”
“Oh, me neither, but my friends Ed and Harry are pledging this year. It’s a family thing for them, so a whole bunch of us are going. I can introduce you to people and it’ll be low-pressure.”
“I GOT IT!” Castiel suddenly bellowed from behind him.
With his tongue poked out, focusing on not slicing his fingers, it took Dean a second to answer. “Gonna open the door.”
If you feel so inclined, you can follow me on
What if.
Michael shrugged, a grin pulling his cheeks lopsided as he raised his palms innocently. “Bible quotes are my specialty, Dean. I’m the archangel Michael.”
Too-bright lights, beeping, a nose-tingling scent of disinfectant.
“So you were an engineer!” Castiel sounded so very relieved, Dean couldn’t help but take offense.
“’Sup, Sammy?” Dean responded, stretching out his chilled legs in the sand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Always have done, always will. Your videos have done more for funding in this region than any carefully written grant application I could make.”
It had cost Castiel just over two-thirds of his savings to purchase the farm. When Crowley had said he would sell it for a steal, he’d meant it. Meg had been mightily pissed when she’d awoken the next morning with a ringing hangover and discovered that Castiel had changed his whole life in a single phone call, all while she’d been sleeping off a tequila and sugar coma. Castiel had explained over breakfast at the twenty-four-hour taco shack, and Meg had told him he was utterly crazy. Well, actually, she’d told him he was nutty as a squirrel turd, but she’d supported him anyway.
“Oh, it probably does,” Castiel interjected with a shrug, “but it sure makes me care less.”
Turning his head immediately in the other direction, Dean caught Castiel red-handed. Spotted staring, Castiel blinked owlishly. Dean held his gaze this time, trying to get the measure of the man from a distance; a distance too far for communication, but close enough that the soft blush behind Castiel’s ears didn’t escape Dean’s notice. Slowly, maintaining their look, Dean offered Castiel a little smile—one that he hoped could speak to a variety of things, depending who viewed it.
Castiel turned his head, nuzzling his face into Dean’s and pressing his gummy, sharp grin into Dean’s cheek. “I love you, too. I love you, I love you.”
Secondly: Where was I?! This is a reasonable question, and I can really only apologize for the delay. I had some medical issues these last couple of weeks in the shape of a handful of very painful kidney stones. If the pain of the stones themselves wasn't bad enough, the four different kinds of medicine I was given didn't treat me especially well and I was nauseous and woozy for much of it. I feel terrible for all the fandom things (and friends, and work) that I neglected, but my focus was utterly shot to pieces. Thank you so much for understanding!
Also, any theories on what happened to Dean and Cas in the corridor, there? ;)
Dean could feel the hard length of Castiel’s cock riding against him, even warmer than the rest of Castiel’s skin as it settled in the crevice of Dean’s cheeks.
Dean and Castiel continue following Gabriel's trail to learn more about what happened to the
A loud, irritating clacking noise burst out of Dean’s speakers as Adler’s fingers thumped across his keyboard. “Better than that, I’ll get him in on the call so you can get started.”
Dean couldn’t help but grin across the table. “How very mature of us.”
Dean’s flashlight shook a little; he readjusted his grip, dismissing his nerves.  He didn’t want to go ass-over-teakettle down the remaining fourteen feet, or so, of the carved cliff steps.
an engineer, right? You know how to fix this—”
The smell of the Leviathan Blossom clung to them all as they rode back across the Nebraska state line, heading for home. Dean was glad to leave the chichi pink elephants behind; he’d be having nightmares about those things, he knew it.
Dean found himself suddenly warm, unsure what to say. He pursed his lips and looked awkwardly down at his steel-toed boots for a moment before saying, “I don’t know about that. I’m far from fluent, he’s probably just being nice so that I don’t give up and drop out.”
Michael nodded slowly. “I followed orders. I am Heaven’s sword, as you well know. When we last fought, I was young. A new creation made only to serve my father’s will. I knew nothing of the precious world he claimed we were protecting from you; it was younger even than I was, in the ultimate scale of time. I wasn’t told more than my orders.”
It wasn’t much, their strange, epistolary friendship, perhaps. But increasingly, it was all Dean had.
Castiel followed on behind Dean, up onto the covered porch. Dean unlocked the door and pushed it open, before pocketing his keys again and saying, “Go on in and make yourself at home. Beer’s in the fridge. I’m just going to go find my laser measuring tool before we look at the pipes I have, and you can tell me if they meet your hippy standards.”
Well, for the most part. Gazing down into the dark sludge of caffeinated water that filled his paper cup, Dean was swept up in a memory.
But of course he didn’t; this was about making his best friend relax and feel better, not about freaking him out with unwanted feelings.
“Dean!” Sam nagged. “Pay attention. Look to the left…”
Dean studied Castiel for a moment, taking in the permanent bags beneath his eyes, the dark shadowing under them especially purple today and causing him to look even more tired than usual. His cut jaw was sprinkled with stubble, and the edges of his eyes drooped.
“Hands,” Castiel said quietly, realizing how silly he sounded as he lifted the tray in explanation.
“You’re good at that,” Castiel said, still not answering Dean’s question, but at least talking. “The massaging. It felt very nice. My back has been sore, and the itch carries through even into my human vessel.”
“That’s a good thought. Here—” Kaia leaned across the counter, looking through the little spinner of local business cards before she picked one out. “—this is who you need. I’m sure he’ll at least know what your chances are, and you should meet him anyway. He’s got a small local office that he opens one day a week, when he’s not working in the city.”
“You on speaker?” Dean said wincing and lowering the volume just a bit. “Cas says hi, by the way.”
“Thanks,” Dean said once he’d settled into the right lane, pulling them ahead of a cruising Ford Escape to his left. He was going to push the speed limit the whole way to Fort Lauderdale, then spin off through the Everglades and take the long, quiet way home. “You alright?”
Not that he was
Whatever Earl gave Castiel to make him quiet and compliant was strong; as Dean adjusted his grip and made for the corridor once more, the sputtering, filthy strip lights reflected erratically back on eyes so dilated that the fantastic, ocean blue was only a thin ring.
Dean reached out one finger, tracing it across the direction he’d scrawled while far, far from here. His heart felt full, pushing demandingly against his ribs.
“Alright,” Dean interrupted sharply, shoving his hands forward and under MEGS ribs. “That was rhetorical, and you know it.”
He didn’t stay like that for long though, bringing his gaze back down after mere seconds so that he could watch while Dean swallowed him down.
When Dean dared to look up, there was so much
Dean felt a tiny rush of air into his mouth as his lips fell open into an ‘O’. Not one ever got that he was here just for Sammy. They told him to live his own life; they didn’t get it. This guy got it.
Castiel’s cheeks flushed a little. It was enchanting.
“Of course, Cas,” Sam said, his voice a gentle tiptoe. “I’ve got another few hours of driving to do before I grab a motel, so I’m gonna go, but you guys have a good night, yeah?”
“The final year of the medical robotics course at Stanford Intergalactic had a lot of hands-on internship work,” Castiel continued right over the top of him. “The whole program was pretty intense. Exhausting, actually. I was…I’d done pretty well, I guess, up until that point. I was one of those ‘gifted’ kids, y’know?”
But he didn’t want to look old. Did Dean think he looked old?
He’d wait around a few minutes. Usually, Adler would send copies of his slides or his own lecture notes, if Castiel requested them. Maybe if Dean hung around and asked—
“With what?” Dean said, his eyes firmly locked on the rows of bottles behind the bar, resting his beer at the corner of his lip for easy, swift access.
“Jack,” Dean chokes out, broken all over again as Castiel’s words come flooding back to him. “I—I’m so sorry, I just—”
Anna waved back, her eyes flicking around to take in the setup before she went any farther.
Warmed by much more than the hot soup, Dean took himself back to bed with his surprise dinner.
“Throw it?”
“Oh, fuck you, Dean,” Sam snaps viciously. His face, Dean realizes, is red and vivid. “Cas made his own choices. Even Chuck couldn’t control him. Have you learned
“Yeah, it’s also really hot,” Dean pointed out bluntly. He sat up and swung his bare legs over the side of the mattress, throwing a wink over his shoulder at Castiel. “Or at least you seemed to think so when it was in me, hmm? We’ll be revisiting that…I want to see your expression when I swallow it all, for one thing.”
Maybe this wouldn’t be as awful as he’d feared.
Dean was pleased to see that wasn’t the case. (Not that he had anything against blonde hair…or boobs.)
The low chuckle that Castiel let out was as warm as the evening breeze. “Agreeing to look into some hooks so we can suspend you, and to focus on some more intense anal training aren’t enough for you?”
This was a fun chapter to write, working in some of the stuff we saw in canon into this "AU but canon similar" world, but in different ways. If there was a real "Mystery Spot" near me, I would 100% want to visit it. Just imagine all the fics it would inspire!
P.S. As always, if you want updates when I post, please do
. We just released a special Pride episode!
“Out of the water I’ll need some—some kind of—”
Thank you so much for reading this week's chapter!
“Me too, Cas.”
“Yes,” said Sam. “Look, I know you don’t have any reason to help us. But he was your brother once—”
“Not too busy, huh? What about in the evenings, doing anything fun?”
When he arrived at the train station (how crazy is that to find in an airport, anyway), he looked at the timetable and saw the train he needed to take was about to take off in 4 minutes, and for the next one he'd have to wait half an hour. He managed to buy the ticket at the machine, and a lady told him how to obliterate it. Now he had only a minute left, but at least the train was the one on the platform right in front of him. With a nervous pace he got on the train, and very very gladly discovered that the seats on the ground floor were all taken, so he moved everything upstairs, where instead there was almost no one. The seats were organized in groups of four, two in front of other two, so there wasn't much space where to put the the the suitcase. Instead, right near the stairs and next to the wall there were three seats aligned in front of the other two, so the one next to the stairs had free space in front of it.
“I’m not mad about that.”
So of course, spending time with Dean would mean spending time with another way of living, another universe. It would mean spending time with a person who had different priorities and who appreciated different things. It didn't use to be a problem when they were younger, but now that they were building their lives and their future, maybe it could become one.
“Not yet.” he just said, hoping it would be enough explanation for now.
He sat on the stairs for a while and decided it was time to drink some water. As he took the bottle from the backpack, he noticed an old man giving his back to the fountain, and throwing a coin in.
Had it been anybody saying this, Dean would have told the person to mind their own business.
One of the girls had Jo’s phone in hand and they all walked to the shore.
“Enjoying the view?”
“Oh, then I guess you have nothing to lose. Go on and try. You should find him”
Jo shouted in his ear
“Medicine? That's... cool. Why'd you choose that?”
They arrived at the drive through and there were only a couple of cars in front of them. The parking lot was mostly empty and there didn’t seem to be anyone walking around.
“Yes.”
“Sure, yeah.”
When the door shut close, he turned to him and they stared at each other for God knows how long, until Cas eventually broke the silence.
Great.
“Cas!”
He stopped and Dean was either projecting, or Castiel was feeling too overwhelmed to speak. So Dean kissed him again on the corner of his mouth, and Castiel laughed, visibly more relaxed.
“Gabriel did too.”
look at the other skaters in their off ice warm up.
After they had finished dinner and drank more wine, Castiel proposed to watch a movie and they moved to the couch. They scrolled down Netflix library for a while, arguing on almost everything since they didn't seem to like the same things. Like, at all. Until they both agreed on watching a tv show called 'Hunting the supernatural', choosing their favorite episode from season five.
The guy seemed genuinely interested, even though he probably lived in freaking Rome.
“Hi!”
Well, of course he was seeking help with his homework. Why did Castiel think he just wanted to see him? He sighed. That would mean working for free for the next month at least; if Dean was really failing all of his classes, a few days together wouldn't make much difference. And that would eat a lot of his own time, which was carefully organized and divided in activities.
Needless to say, both of their drinks got cold and Castiel’s parents scolded him about being late for dinner.
“Yes.”
The conversation went on, which meal was better, whose traditions were more fun, until they had nothing else to say and an awkward silence fell on the line. Castiel didn't want to hang up, but he honestly didn't know what to tell anymore: any fun story he heard from school wouldn't have the same effect on Dean, who would probably find it boring. It's like they didn't know how to talk anymore. Which was sad, and almost depressing if you thought about it too much, which Castiel was trying not to.
After a while a second finger joined the first, and Dean grunted and moaned a little.
The hand made its way back to his shoulder, and this time it gripped it and turned Dean around, maybe a little too fast, a little too strong.
Castiel didn't say anything else, and Dean didn't ask.
“Thank you for the best orgasm I’ve had in ages” he murmured on his lips.
“Thank you” He blurted out at some point, and he felt Dean’s arm tighten more around him. They stayed like that a few more minutes, trying to hold on to the moment as long as possible, but then Dean stood up, got dressed and kissed him goodnight before leaving. Castiel was still speechless, and he wished with all his heart Dean would want to see him again in the next few days.
“Yes.”
The song started with the instrumental and Dean tried to relax his posture, feigning nonchalance as he put his right arm on the backrest, right behind Castiel’s shoulders. In for a penny, in for a pound, right?
“Just admit you did it to show off your muscles and get my attention.”
He also found out that the bus driver didn't sell the tickets, but he stayed on the bus anyway. No one knew he didn't have the ticket, and he could look like anyone with a card. He sure wasn't gonna wait for another bus to come by.
He put a hand in his boxers and masturbated, slowly and quietly: he had no rush of falling asleep, and nothing to worry about the day after. That's why that night he slept better than he had in ages.
He turned around to skate after her and there she was, landing the jump without any effort. She smiled at him, breaking character for a second, and they went into their last element, the step sequence.
They made their way back to the car and silence fell on them for a while.
It was Cas. He felt incredibly happy at the prospect of texting him, and he closed his laptop to focus on his phone.
He realized he had been staring too long when Jo walked into his chest, as he was supposed to step back.
He was now moving up and down, unable to reach the base, but still making a pretty decent job, and Dean seemed to agree, because his hand never left as he made multiple appreciations. Castiel never thought he would have enjoyed that position that much, but as he heard Dean saying “Fuck Cas, just like that” he understood that the memory of the moment was going to get him off for years in the future. The magic ended when Dean finally said “Cas, I’m…” and Castiel quickly pulled off.
It took them another second of charged silence before they both reached for a hug at the same time. There were about a million layers between them, with it being the middle of winter and all, but as soon as Dean felt Cas’ arms holding him tight, his eyes instantly stinged. They hadn’t touched each other at all since everything started. He looked up and sent the tears back just in time for when they pulled back.
He read it a few times, and then pressed sent.
Mathematically speaking, he shouldn't be having this problem. Time was supposed to heal everything, right?
Dean smiled at the picture, zooming in on Castiel’s bed hair, barely distinguishable from the dark background.
Dean didn't know why he was so scared; he trusted his family, he knew they'd love him anyway. He just couldn't share it, it felt like revealing he was a completely different person.
Castiel's smile grew wider while he kept his eyes on the road, and Dean was glad he achieved that.
“Hello sir, how can I help you?”
“You mentioned it while bragging about the whole school following you, if I’m correct.”
“Okay, let's be cheesy.”
So hot.
Jo had tears in her eyes, but Dean could see it was purely out of frustration.
“Yes. I wouldn’t have found the courage to do this otherwise, so don’t get mad at her.”
Castiel didn't need to be told twice, but he was still concerned about Dean.
Without even realizing it, he had his phone in his hands and was searching how to get to NYU.
She was silent for a few seconds.
“Wow, Castiel, Baldassarre... is it me or your family has some weird name choices?”
They got off the tube at the same stop, and exit the station. The bus stop was on the same pavement, and the guy pointed it to Dean. He was about to head there, when he caught the guy whispering
As much as Dean did not like Los Angeles, there were two perks in training there: he could live in the same state as his brother, Sam, who was studying law at Stanford, and he could drive to the beach whenever he liked.Especially before the summer really hit and it got too crowded, it was nice to jog on the shore on his off-training days.
He hoped things wouldn't get weird with Dean.
“It took you 14 years to cool down.”
“Is everything okay?”
“Well. I think we should be glad we both confided in Charlie.”
A hand gripped his shoulder, and he jumped in his seat. Then he realized it was the guy jerking him awake. He glared at the watch: he had fallen asleep for almost 15 minutes.
“Yes?”
It was like receiving constant punches in his stomach and the lungs too didn't want to work anymore.
The guy smiled and returned his attention to the phone in his hands. Dean still wanted to know what he had said, but it evidently wasn't that important if he didn't translate it. And it didn't take a language genius to understand it was a bland comment about the girls, who were now talking more normally.
He could still get a grip of himself.
Dean's kisses started to follow a line down Cas's chest, and stayed one step behind the hands that were working on the shirt.
Time made its course differently, as if it slowed down a little just for them.
Especially not Jo.
He whispered on Dean's lips “Yes you can.”
But he honestly couldn't answer, because he didn't know.
Then he remembered that he had Castiel's number. Or was it just a dream?
“Me too. Actually, I was wondering...” He wanted to ask him out again, he did. But should he? Whenever he fell for someone like he was falling for Dean, he always fell hard. And then it would take a lot of effort to get back on his feet when things didn't work out. With Dean he already knew he shouldn't expect a normal relationship: he was going to be there for some days, and then he'd fly away. If he wanted to meet him again, he had to make sure his feelings for him were 100% casual and laid back, or he wouldn't recover easily from his departure. Maybe he should stop before things got out of hand.
“Well, I'm failing some classes. Most of them. Let's say I'm okay only with maths and physics. And I personally don't care very much, but I don't want to upset my mother, so I was wandering if we could... if you could help me out a little? In these last few days before Christmas break ends. I'm so sorry to ask you this, but you're the only one good at school that I know, so...”
For the first time he wondered if he had been too confident with his English: what if they started talking about a topic he didn't know the vocabulary of?
It wasn't the first time Dean was attracted to a man: he'd had his fair share of one night stands with both men and women, and even had a boyfriend once.
She was in his hotel room, sitting on his bed eating chips. It was two days after the best day of their career, and it was also the last day of competition: ice dance’s free dance was happening as they were resting after their breakfast, and in the afternoon there was going to be the men’s free skating.
He had to decide what to do with Sam's information, before he got on the verge of a panic attack.
Dean cut himself another slice and smiled.
Dean never liked big cities. He learned to appreciate San Francisco, sunny and fun like California, but not as crazy as Los Angeles, for Sam's sake during his years staying at Stanford. New York, instead, felt just like chaos and he couldn't believe people actually enjoyed living there. If it was up to him, he'd never gone there in the first place, but Sam asked him to and he couldn't really say no.
Dean seemed to think about it, but then he handed his phone and turned completely, posing for a standard picture.
Castiel – no doubts it was him – was still behind him, and Dean knew he had to turn around. Turn around and face him.
“Dean, if you're having second thoughts just say it. I don't want to cause problems.”
“What is it, Dean?”
“Dean, can we… uhm...”
“Dean, that was the most… I…”  he realized his brain didn’t have any english word available at the moment, so he just looked up at Dean, who was standing right in front of him, and found out he was looking down at him as well, with that same look that was a mixture of lust and… affection? He wasn’t sure.
“Okay”
But having the house all for himself also meant he could spend some alone time in a totally different way. Sharing his bedroom with his brother and living with other four people had taught him all there was to know about not being caught masturbating. His skills were speed and quietness, very useful during his teenage years.
“Yes. Yes, in the shower.”
By then, they were waiting for a taxi outside the airport.
After drinking his water, which was somehow still fresh, he decided it was time to have lunch. He didn't want to sit at a restaurant by himself, but he didn't want to go to Mc Donalds either.
Dean kept to himself, watching them talking in italian and he noticed the lady looking at him with curiosity, then saying goodbye to Castiel and walking away.
He wasn't mad, though, not when he was in one of the few places he knew of Rome. He also noticed a carriage and two horses among the people.
Cas heard the door closing, and looked at the dirty sheets and the used condom. He was glad this happened. One last time. He couldn't fall in the past trap, though, he couldn't start thinking all of the 'what if's. He decided shutting his mind was more effective instead, and so he fell asleep, hugging Dean's pillow.
It wasn't relevant, but he wanted to know. He wanted to know what Dean's life had been like.
“Hell yeah, it's been ages since I ate something fried. Even though I don't live with Sam anymore, I still hear his voice ordering me what's healthy and what's not.”
“Yes, sure.”
In the back, instead, there were two girls, probably in their twenties, who decided it was okay to just take their shoes off and get in the water. They were immediately shout at by a guard nearby, though.
He tried to push the thought aside, not wanting to let it ruin the mood.
“Buonanotte, Dean.”
”, but he already knew he was going to go with her anyway.
“I'd really appreciate that, Dean. Thank you.”
Around noon, he decided he could take a break, even though he had only started at 10:30. He went to his bedroom and sat on his bed, pulling down his boxers. It didn't take long before he got completely hard. He started stroking his cock, enjoying the fact he didn't need to hide or close the door. He still made almost no sound, but he allowed himself not to control his breaths and let go a little more as he reached the orgasm.
Castiel's smile was now impossible to contain. He said to himself it was only because of the novelty of the whole situation, but deep down he knew it was something more. He just decided not to think about it, or he would have to admit something rather inconvenient.
And so Castiel bowed toward Dean and took his hand. They look into each others eyes for a while, holding their hands.
“And are you sure... I don't want to mess up your life”
Maybe.
“Don't worry.”
He tried to catch Dean's reaction, but found him already looking at him, with a strange smile on his face.
And as he was thinking about the scene again, his phone rang.
“Well, yeah. So I was wondering if you wanted to make one with me.”
. I'm guessing that's what you've been thinking about while fingering yourself, hiding from your wife, mh? Wishing to have my dick inside your ass, filling you whole.”
“I'll translate it, if you want. But I would suggest to start with these appetizers: it's basically fried pizza strings. They're called
“Shut up, I was thinking”
“Enough Cas, I want you now.”
“So after 'cooling', you needed Sam to remind you of me. No thought about us before.”
Dean nodded, and took the folder back. He really wanted to keep talking, but his head was hurting too much and even speaking was an effort. He adjusted himself to a more comfortable-
