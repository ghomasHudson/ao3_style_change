Star, as usual, appeared on Steve’s balcony. He smiled at her and instinctively reached for the treats he was now keeping in his bedside table as she hopped onto his bed. She let him give her a few belly rubs before she settled down next to his leg as he attempted to read a book, as her tail swept over the pages.
Steve grinned as innocently as he could. He’d had to bite his tongue before replying that he’d be required to do the same back in Triskelion. He’d picked up that he was being weighed and evaluated by a number of people in the palace, Sam and Natasha were just the frontline spies.
“Clint is fine,” Steve said, his voice chilly. Clearly, Clint was not in for a good time later during mission debrief. “Why don’t you join us down on the dance floor?”
Someone had dressed up Mr. Steve in a suit coat and light blue shirt, open at the collar. Peter kept losing sight of him in the gathering crowd. He was hiding behind the open bar and could only sneak peaks at times. The bartender, Clint, was a friend of Natasha’s and let Peter crouch at his feet. “I hope this is worth it, kid,” he said.
“I thought Prom would be better than the charity galas my parents dragged me to when I was growing up,” Tony confessed.
“You’re from New York City, no one else says ‘Jersey’ with such contempt.” Tony felt the tug and pull of sleep. Damn, Cap was the best blanket, pillow and bed all-in-one. Except for the wet leather smell.
Steve concluded, “If we’re already married, then all Zemo or Kang or Ultron would be breaking up would be a party.”
Would they live in the sheriff’s office? Because he wasn’t going to move into the bare cave-like room in which Tony kept a cot for when he couldn’t stand up. Could he afford to buy them a house in town? Steve frowned as he considered the significant lack of funds in his bank account. The salary of a frontier town sheriff did not stretch far. He was a poor choice of husband if he couldn’t keep Tony in the life he had been used to.
“Tony needs to be married, your highness, and a perceived alliance with Triskelion is more beneficial than a true alliance. Who the Triskelion prince is does not matter, if I can be plain.”
“Or the Controller or whoever is in charge of AIM these days or – let’s be real, there’s at least fifty guys and gals that would go a long long way to bust up our big day.” Tony drummed his fingers on the bed. “Wait – why did they jump straight to us getting engaged? Why not moving in together? I could have given you a box with a key to my suite.”
As far as Tony could tell, Captain America sprung fully formed from one of the nation’s top labs, like Athena from Zeus’ head. He was enthusiastically optimistic, brash as his costume, and naive. Oh dear god, he was babe-in-the-woods naive.
What would he say to Steve about the last five years if they met again? He snorted. Like he’d ever sit next to Steve again to talk mission details over cups of coffee.
Star put her paw down on one drawing, the one in red and gold. “Those are Tony’s favorite colors, aren’t they?” Steve mused. “Good choice.”
“Hey, guys! We’ve been trying to reach you!” said Jan cheerfully. “We found you through thermal imaging.”
“Indeed, it was, Ma’am,” Steve replied. Thank god they were serving finger foods, cookies and sweets because he was not ready to face the daunting prospect of a full-service royal dinner. The meal laid out in front of him was still the fanciest he’d ever eaten.
.” She put a possessive hand on Steve’s arm as she smiled at Sara. Steve looked at Tony as Tony swallowed a big gulp of water.
“Want to dance?” Steve asked and Tony nearly dropped his jaw. Steve had taken off his jacket and bowtie, leaving the collar open. His hair was mussed up, in just the right way.
That’s what Steve faintly heard Peter say as Steve woke from his impromptu nap on the couch. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but the team had fought AIM all evening and into the early hours of the morning. They’d returned back to the Tower a few hours ago and gone their separate ways.
Seriously, Steve asked him out on a date at least thirty times. Tony had to muster up some semblance of being shocked
Tony looked at Steve, who looked at the suddenly very fascinating floor. “So none of us could be affected by anything?”
The calibration machine beeped once, twice, repeatedly. Tony groaned. “Look, I gotta to finish up here.”
Tony learned a lot over the next few days about art, artists and art historians. For one thing, he wasn’t expecting to find out that Steve viewed art historians with a deep, ingrained distrust that impressed even the cynical Logan. The other thing was the film production company was very persistent in wanting to talk to Steve, so the PR people were begging Tony to get Steve to talk to them. The third thing was that the art expert turned out to be not a particularly bad guy, just firmly convinced that his opinion was the right one.
Clint Barton owned a dog. Peter had never met Clint or knew that Clint existed. Natasha didn’t explain. But Peter picked up that Clint asked a Sam Wilson to dogsit when he was on vacation. If Sam was watching the dog, then Mr. Steve was taking care of the dog too.
Three days ago, Jan cornered him in his Stark Industries office where he couldn’t escape. “Look, Hank and I are trying to make this work,” she said as she handed Tony a bribe of his favorite coffee drink. “Just find someone and we can get dinner and go to a concert.”
“For the record, I want you to know that this is a stupid idea,” MJ said. She and Peter were waiting outside Mr. Rogers’ classroom.
Mr. Rogers said nothing to anyone, especially Peter. He was still kind, patient and thoughtful in Peter’s art class. Though once Peter had caught a slight clenching of his jaw when Peter mentioned his dad.
Peter couldn’t follow any of it. Except that he pieced together that Tony had said something very, very mean to Mr. Steve on their date and Mr. Steve hadn’t reacted at all nicely to what was said. Peter was very, very confused.
Through a pure miracle, Tony had located the cabin and if it didn’t turn out to be a mirage, then he’d be forced to wait out the storm with his least favorite person in the world.
Tony wheeled a chair over to the wall and stepped on the seat to peer into the uncovered vent. “The scrubbers aren’t working.”
“Oh, okay,” Steve said. His whole body collapsed in on itself, like a building imploding. He gave a tight nod. “Maybe this wasn’t --”
After a testy and exhausting morning with SHIELD, Steve had a free afternoon. Early afternoon shadows gathered in the living room as Steve put a freshly-made hot cup of coffee on the end table. He’d claimed this corner nook in the Avengers living room when they’d restarted the team a couple of years ago. Brown leather chair in a mission style, with a end table just the right size for all of Steve’s papers and a bright light with a mica shade. A magazine rack had shown up shortly after Steve started sitting there.
When Tony and Pepper had ended things, Steve had felt like the worst kind of person for being happy. Tony had been devastated, and Steve wasn’t sure he deserved him, for finding some sort of glee and hope in the pain of Tony and Pepper’s ended relationship.
Although, the grief of losing his entire ship and crew made it so he didn’t have much motivation to seek those answers. He fell back asleep for a little while, a couple hours probably. When he woke back up, Howard was there again, checking some notes over on an electronic personal device of some kind. Again, not Federation issue.
“Hang them!” Came a grieved cry from the crowd. Tony turned to Steve and they both nodded at each other. The council agreed, then the religious leaders. Finally, a unanimous decision from the poll of people agreed as well.
Things only got better when his heat hit. Normally, his heat infuriated Tony. He was reduced to everything he hated about his subgender. He became everything Alphas said Omegas were. Desperate, incapable of caring for themselves, hosts for making children.
“Okay, let’s see what we have here. It will all be fine, my Lord. You just have to remain relaxed,” the midwife said in a calm, Beta tone. It immediately brought his tensions down. Steve was a ball of nervous Alpha anxiety beside him, so the calming voices and scents of the two Betas helped quite a bit.
He tinkered with a few things as the morning stretched on, but he couldn’t take his mind off of the ex-assassin living in his tower. The man had killed his parents…but had he really? Tony kept thinking about the files that were out there on the web, encrypted and waiting to be opened. He set his tools down and waited a long moment.
Preparation started right away. All of Steve’s, and now Tony’s, people did all they could to help the beginning of the war efforts. Those who were not trained to fight did other tasks. Wove blankets for the soon-to-be soldiers, gathered extra canned foods to be packed for the battles.
No. No, no, no. Steve let out a pained noise and he tried not to cry, but he couldn’t help it. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he sobbed. His heart turned to ice, cold like he’d remembered feeling before he woke up.
Tony had been right about the trail being easier this time around. They had plenty to eat, plenty to drink. The warm weather was helpful as well. They hadn’t needed to pack as many heavy furs with them since the June air was so agreeable. And it seemed every day they traveled, it only got nicer, warmer, and even a little hot sometimes in the midday sun.
“This entire war, the whole point of it! It’s all based on Omegas being inferior. They think I’m not fit! They think I can’t fight because I can carry children! I’d be proving their point!” Tony finished with an angry shout. Steve stared at him a moment before sighing heavily.
He knew that the traditionalists had to be glaring daggers at them, but Tony didn’t care. He was too caught up in how happy he felt in the moment. There was cheering from a large majority of the people, and when they turned to face their clans, now destined to be one, Tony couldn’t hide the smile on his face. He was surprised to see his father again looking proud, his mother sniffling a little bit at her place beside him.
His breeches came off and he let the trained eyes of the midwife and doctor survey the situation. They talked in quiet tones to themselves, and Tony reached over to grab Steve’s hand. He gave his Alpha a reassuring smile. At least he hoped that how it came across, he wasn’t sure.
He quickly thought about the best plan if someone came into his tent. He’d leave Peter on the bed and stand. There was a dagger on the table near him.
Bucky laughed, a low, soft sound that he was still getting used to himself. “Yeah. You are, but it’s adorable,” He placated. Tony lit up at that, delighting in the compliment and Bucky secretly vowed he’d compliment this man every single fucking day.
“It wasn’t you. I can see that now. You don’t have anything to worry about. You can stay here to recover,” Tony said, trying desperately to keep his voice even. Bucky let his boots make heavy noise as he moved even closer to the genius, not wanting to startle him. He paused near the table, still staring at the other man.
In total, there were ten left after the bloody battle in the courtyard, including Rumlow. They’d captured them all, dragging them up to the podium. The trial was short and sweet. Everyone had seen the acts, of course.
Tony, of course, had to leave the clan with one final statement. He’d been cautious at first when Steve had asked him to ride one of their horses with him, at the front of the party. Omegas didn’t ride. If they needed to, they rode sidesaddle or they rode in wooden carts in the back. It was considered highly improper for them to ride like Betas and Alphas did, though Tony had never grasped why.
He could barely think as Pepper fretted over him, trying to get him clean and dressed and looking good for the new arrival. Tony knew she didn’t approve of this either, but she was on the chopping block from Howard if Tony didn’t look good. It was because of this fact that Tony let the other Omega do what she could.
Bucky didn’t think too heavily on that particular line of thought. He couldn’t stay long. He shouldn’t. The guilt was ever-present, weighing on his shoulders so much; it was impossible to think of much else. And Steve wanted his Bucky back. He wasn’t certain that he had the heart to tell Steve that the man he had known was dead. The man he’d fought with seventy years ago was gone. In his place, a monster, a shell of a man.
“I…I’ve been feeling guilty,” Steve admitted, voice soft. Someone without their level of hearing probably wouldn’t have even caught it. Bucky could hear it loud and clear, though, so the confusion on his face wasn’t from that.
The morning came, sun peaking over the horizon. Tony and Steve got dressed, and wordlessly went about their morning before heading out to the main communal podium. It’s where trials were held. The Lords, council, religious figures, and a random poll of citizens would make the judgment.
The two weeks came and went, and Tony grew even heavier with child. He tried his very best not to pout about his newly acquired waddle. He was six months along now, and it showed. But he didn’t stop the training. He could feel that his son was strong, that his son wanted to fight along with him. The person his son was going to be would want to fight as well.
Steve spent as long as he could by Tony’s side, but he eventually had to leave. He gave Tony one last soft kiss before slipping out of the tent and going to meet his team. He sent a prayer to the gods to protect his omega and his child.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky said shortly, before letting go stiffly, and darting to the bedroom. Tony would be concerned that Bucky seemed to know the layout of the tower apartments, but he was still reeling from the hug. Then, he registered what Bucky had said. Sorry? What was he sorry for? Tony frowned and turned to Steve, who suddenly looked very haunted, his usual bright blue eyes hooded by a darkness that Tony couldn’t explain.
Steve nodded, clearing his throat and he looked so damn nervous, that Tony couldn’t help but smile softly. It really was adorable that Steve was so terrible at this sort of thing. “It’s okay. Come on, Steve. We’ve been friends for years. I’m banging your best friend slash possible current boyfriend. You can tell me anything,” Tony offered; his smile widened a bit to show that he was sincere.
“Just about.” Not all were so bad, of course, but it was ingrained in them that Omegas weren’t worthy of the same things as Alphas. They had no other viewpoints to base off of.
It still hadn't set in yet that he had to refer to Tony as his ex. Also he probably couldn't call him Tony anymore, could he? That was a nickname and nicknames are reserved for friends. But the thought of calling Tony Stark or Anthony sent a bad feeling through him. Stark was the owner of a company, Anthony was a troubled teen with shit parents, but Tony, Tony was his.
"Tony?" the line was silent. Steve couldn't even hear anyone breathing. Had Tony pocket dialed him somehow?
"Ya. Pretty shitty. I can't even begin to apologize enough for what happened in the Hydra base. I blacked out, just one minute we were fighting and the next I'm bringing my shield down on your reactor. Fuck, I could have killed you. And there isn't enough apologizes I could give for that" Steve bit his lip to try and distract him for the painful memories that overtook him. He really didn't remember much from the bunker. It was all blank, his anger overtaking him. He only woke up when Tony started crying.
"Language. Now I know this isn't the way you wanted to start a family, but this could be a chance for you to be happy. As much as we all agree with what side we took, no one is happy that we have to hide. But this, this could be something to make you smile every day of your life" Nat rubbed his shoulder gently as Steve let the tears fall. He knew he would love this baby. Steve Rogers loved almost everyone. But that was the problem. If he loved this baby he would never move on from Tony. Not that he probably ever could, but he needed to try because Tony no longer loved him.
"The girls name" Steve blurt out before Tony could say whether he missed the sound or not, not wanting to hear the answer, "is Maria" Tony was silent, but Steve knew he was still on the line. Steve was willing to sit in silence with Tony until he was ready.
"He's already here" Sam interrupted, and Steve froze. No, that wasn't right. He wasn't supposed to be here until later, when Steve was more prepared. Not now, not when he would have to do a dramatic entrance where everyone would be starring. Tony ran by his own clock, which meant everything at least three hours late, and yet he's here on time the one day he shouldn't be.
They still had a lot to deal with; figuring out a way for Tony to be active in the kids lives, figuring out how much of the serums capabilities they would posses, and H.Y.D.R.A being on the lookout for Steve. But for the first time in a long time Steve would go to bed feeling completely happy.
"Half hour ago maybe. We were going to send you a message, but figured we may as well just wait and not make your walk anxious. He brought Colonel Rhodes, Vision, Pepper, and Happy. Shit Steve, he brought the whole crew, the only one he forgot was that spider thing" it didn't surprise Steve that Tony had brought everyone; they were his support people. Wanda was looking at Steve worriedly, for both herself and Steve, and Steve nodded assuredly at her.
"Why does everyone keep asking me if I'm doing ok? I am literally holding up a ceiling right now, so no I am not doing so great" if he wasn't a superhero he should have become an actor. He was selling his role very well. "Sorry, but can we please move past checking up on me, and instead work on getting me out of here?"
"Get out of there!" it was Thor this time, and god damn it he was trying. Kicking open the closest door he ran in and slammed it shut behind them, figuring if they couldn't get out they may as well try and get somewhere for cover. He wished he had the shield, this wouldn't have been so stressful if they could have all hidden behind it. Practically throwing Clint into the corner (he'd apologize for the bruises it would probably leave later) he dropped Nat on top of him and then shielded them both with his own body. He would be the shield.
“All done” Steve blew a raspberry onto his stomach. He could never get enough of the sound of his kids laughter. Picking James back up, he turned to face Maria and Tony. The little girl had calmed down as Tony started to rock her, but she was still staring at Steve intently, as if saying
"Ya, I am" Wanda suddenly sprung up from the couch, and Steve worriedly looked at her, noticing the way her eyes were starting to well up with tears.
"Steve" Wanda cut him off, looking over his shoulder at something with her mouth agape. Furrowing his eyebrows he turned to see what could be bothering the girl, and gasped. James was standing, and taking slow steps in the direction of Tony, who look horrified but also in awe of the child nearing him. It was like James knew who Tony was, and instantly felt a connection to him. James fell down, but pushed himself back up, to stubborn to quit just like both his parents. Steve along with everyone else waited to see if James would reach Tony by walking. He took a step, before another one, only falling down once more before he was holding on to Tony's knee a wide goofy smile on his face. The room erupted into cheers, and Steve to proud to think about what he was doing was approaching the table.
The toilet seat was cold against his forehead, but Steve Rogers couldn’t find it in himself to move. He had been puking on and off again for the past two weeks, and it was the first time since the serum had been injected into him that it was happening. And even though he was bigger now it still took everything out of him. Literally. He remembered growing up, how he would puke every other week from whatever illness he had managed to pick up, and he had hoped he would never have to experience it again.
"Always straight to the point. But you're right, that's not what I wanted to say. You still treat her like a kid"
"Steve?" Wanda snapped him out his head by gently placing a hand on his shoulder, frowning when he flinched under her touch.
"James. His name is James" at Bucky's look of shock Steve kept talking. "Both Tony and I had a James always by our side. As a best friend, a ride or die, someone who always had our backs no matter how stupid we were being. Maria will have that to" as Steve spoke he let his mind wander to Tony, wondering what he was doing.
not about to shoot you, or to make sure I haven’t called Ross’s men in? Because you still don’t trust me? Is that why you were going to hide this? Because if that is what you think of me, then let me tell you-”
"I'm not taking either side. I'm taking the side that will make you both realize you're morons in love"
“So, any plans for the day?” Tony asked, trying to sound casual, but really, he was hoping that if Steve did have plans, Tony would be included.
He wondered what they looked like. Did any of them look like him? What were their names? Boys or girls or both? But did he really want to know? Would it only cause more hurt if he became apart of their lives?
"Sorry, sorry got lost in my head for a few seconds. Sure, we have plenty of room. The others will also be staying here because they live here as well. But if that's going to be a problem I suggest staying in the palace" ignoring everyone's looks of worry, seriously could everyone stop looking at him like that it's been a day and those are the only looks he's bee receiving, he put Maria and James on the floor. James was instantly drawn back to his building blocks, and Maria crawled over to Wanda who sat down on the floor to play with her.
It didn’t make any sense; he couldn’t get sick, and he hadn’t been hit in the stomach during training so why was he puking?
"That's what makes it so sweet" Tony joked, wincing as James woke up and gripped his finger before he could move his hand away. "Holy shit" he whispered, starring in awe at the scene. Steve looked over startled, before realizing what was happening. It seemed that all of his wishes and prayers that they would not have any of the serum in them had gone ignored.
“Hey Steve, you alright?” Bucky called quietly from the hallway. Bucky still didn’t have all his memories and could still be triggered at times, but he knew Steve was important in his old life and this one. He'd considered going into a cyro chamber until he was healed, but decided against it in the end after Steve had begged him not to. He’d do anything for Steve with memories, or without. Steve offered back a pitiful moan, and Bucky took that as an invitation to come in.
"Bucky and I were talking" Wanda wiped her eyes as she sat up to face him. "We were thinking that after the babies are born, we would keep our distance" Steve furrowed his eyebrows at her. Keep their distance? Why would they do that? His confusion must have shown on his face, because Wanda answered his unasked question. "Steve, Bucky and I have done a lot of bad things. We've killed people. We shouldn't risk the babies well being with us here"
"I didn't tell him about his parents, I could have killed him in Siberia, and I didn't tell him about his kids. All Tony did was react to everything I did"
Steve's eyes widened as he read the text. This was a H.Y.D.R.A base, and his team had just walked into their trap. He couldn't tell them to leave without blowing his cover, but he also couldn't allow them to walk into their deaths. Hurriedly he walked into the room at the end of his hallway. It looked like a normal room, except for the old computers and desk covered in filth. Seriously, H.Y.D.R.A did not know how to clean.
"Sorry princess, dads over rule you" and oh boy, the phone did his voice no justice. Hearing his voice in person after such a long time sounded like a beautiful song. It was a bit scratchy and wasn't as upbeat, but it still sounded amazing. And he didn't correct what Steve had said, so Steve knew he must still prefer chocolate. Tony shot him a shy smile when he caught him looking, and Steve returned it.
"Tell you about it later" she continued to stare at him, before nodding and walking back over to Vision.
It had been a few minutes. Shakily he grabbed the stick from the counter and brought it down to his face.
“So you’ll be safe here?” Tony knew instantly from the way that Steve looked away that he wouldn’t like what Steve was about to respond with.
"What do I do?" Steve turned to the original four who had accompanied him, and not one of them looked like they had a helpful answer.
Also, I did update a few chapters so if something doesn't make sense (Nomad) that's because I just added that in a few chapters back.
Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my newest story. I have another story called Finding our Happy Ending and if you're a fan of that story I just want to say that even though I'm starting this story that one isn't abandoned.
Guess who's back? Sorry this took so long, I lost my inspiration for a while, but I've found it again and I am ready to keep going with this story. And thank you to everyone who commented and urged me to keep going.
"Happy birthday to you" everyone had joined in singing now, and the cake rolled closer to the group. Someone, he guessed it was Bucky, squeezed his shoulder from behind.
Rogers" Tony purposely spit out the word Rogers. What was once Rogers-Stark was now just Rogers, and even though he's known for two years that his last name was what it once was, hearing Tony say it hurt so much worse. This was a mistake, he never should have called. This would only make things worse for himself. He can't, he can't, he-
Everyone had gathered in a semi circle, Nat at the front holding Maria still. Would that woman ever put her down Steve did not know. He walked up to stand beside her, and she studied him as he stopped. He tried to give her a genuine smile, but who was he kidding? Nat seemed to be struggling with a decision, before turning to shout behind her.
"The person who found Mr. Carron described the assailants to the police. There were three. Not many details to go by because it was so dark, but they did see one thing very clearly; a skull surrounded by what they called octopus legs" Steve shut his eyes and took a deep breath to remain calm. So H.Y.D.R.A had been interested in this man for some reason. That means he must have been important. But if he was that important then why kill him?
"What if this baby looks like him? What if it's a genius and talks to me about things only their father would understand? Or worse, what if it's like me?" he whispered the last part, dropping his eyes from Nat's not wanting to see the pity he knew he would see. He didn't just mean what if the baby had gotten the serum, he meant what if it possessed traits like him? The baby was already doomed.
"What are their names?" this is the part Steve knew would get emotional, because the names had meaning to Tony, and he hoped he could control himself enough to keep a level and steady voice, without starting to get choked up.
"But Nat, I almost killed him" he protested, because he would never forgive himself for that. Tony crying out in pain, the shield raised over his head, the anger in his veins. It was sickening, and Steve realized he was scared of himself. Nat cupped his cheek, and forced him to meet her eyes. If anyone were to walk by it would look like they were about to kiss. How off scale that guess would be.
"Don't forget to make a wish. It is a tradition" Vision told them from where he stood beside Wanda, and Steve wondered if he knew that genuinely or if it was something he knew from downloading it. Steve turned to finally look at Tony, who was already starring at him. This was the first time they had made direct eye contact in two years for more then three seconds. And in two years his eyes had changed dramatically. They were empty, dull, and held no Tony Stark spark. But there was a tiny bit of something in them now, hidden behind the sadness, and Steve dared to believe it was hope.
“And what happens if something goes wrong? What if you don’t come home?” and when Tony said home, he wasn’t referring to this place. He was referring to the tower, their actual home. The one filled with all of their memories, good and bad, that he wouldn’t trade for the world. If Steve was captured, or worse, what if he never came home? What if they never fixed themselves? No, Tony couldn’t let that happen.
"Hello Maria" he murmured, and a stray tear rolled down Steve's cheek at the beautiful scene before him. For a little while he could pretend they were as perfect as this picture. Maria clapped her hands against Tony's cheeks and giggled as she repeatedly did it.
“Go help Rhodey” Steve walked past, finally reaching his bedroom, slamming the door behind him. Was he over reacting? Maybe, but he was tired and stressed, and he exploded. Everyone was allowed to explode, right?
Steve sat down beside her giving her space but still in a comforting zone. He didn't speak, waiting for Wanda to start.
"Nomad is holding up the ceiling" Clint re answered. There was a roar outside, and as terrifying as it usually was, to Steve it sounded like a beautiful melody. Hulk was here and ready to smash. While he wasn't straining himself, he also didn't want to be here any longer.
"You don't have to talk. But give him small things. Baby steps" Steve didn't turn around to see if Tony had listened, but when the Black Widow told you to do something, you did it or feared pain. No time away from one another would allow you to forget that. Slowly, Tony moved up to stand beside him facing Nat with a worried expression. She just rolled her eyes at him.
The thing that sucked about missions now was that he wasn't Captain America. He didn't have his blonde hair, clean face, and blue, red, and white costume. He wasn't the perfect American apple pie dream anymore. No, now he was Nomad and Nomad had dirty blonde almost brown hair, and a beard like Thor's. He wore dark grey's and had no shield. That's who he was now. When he wasn't with his kids. With them he was still Steve Rogers, and that's who he would always be.
“Sure. Grab Maria, if she sees me grab James without grabbing her she’ll throw a fit” Steve bent down to pick up James, who’s whimpers had risen in volume.
"Right. So don't you think that if you were really trying to kill Tony you would have gone for the head? If you brought you're shield down on his head it would have been over for him, but you didn't. You hit his reactor. And you know that he didn't need his reactor anymore, not after Malibu" there was another memory he wanted to forget. Extremis, Justin Hammer, reports of Tony dying, Pepper being kidnapped. Would they ever have a normal life? But then the last sentence of what she said kicked in. That was right, Tony didn't need the reactor anymore. It was no longer keeping him alive. Had he always known that he wouldn't actually kill Tony? So lost in his head he wasn't thinking straight anymore, and he doesn't think he has been for the past two years. He was so used to people targeting the reactor, that when he did it he put himself in the same category as them. Seeing the realization sweep across his face Nat knew she had gotten through to him. "You've been so caught up in your grief, you've failed to see the facts. If you wanted Tony dead you wouldn't have gone after the reactor. All you did was power it down so Bucky could get away"
“He would have made an incredible avenger” Tony told him, standing up fully at the same time Steve did.
“Ya I’m good” Sam lowered his gaze to his plate, picking up his hotdog to give him something to do. He could feel everyone’s gaze still on him, but it was Bucky’s that was the most intense. He was saved from the situation when Maria threw her ketchup covered grilled cheese across the table, drawing everyone's attention.
"Why wouldn't you" he shrugged. And really why wouldn't Tony. If Tony took them they wouldn't be secrets anymore. They could actually grow up like normal children, well as normal as one could with Tony Stark as a father, and not be worried about being tracked down one day.
"As much as I love listening to us breath, what the hell do you want?" what did Steve want? The answer was pretty obvious but he couldn't say it. That would only make the situation worse.
“I figured” Bucky crouched down behind Steve and rubbed his back in what he hoped was a comforting gesture. He was still getting used to comfort and how to express it.
“Swap kids?” Steve asked approaching, Maria’s hands already outstretched, making grabbing motions. James, sensing what was about to happen, curled into Steve’s neck, not wanting to go.
"Barnes killed my mother, you hid that from me. You took your shield and brought it down on my chest, you could have killed me. What am I supposed to feel sorry for?" Tony growled, his anger flaring, but he kept his voice low so not to disturb the twins or the company downstairs.
I love our three new characters, and yes they will play a major role in this story. Not only does Steve see his family in them, but they will also be important on getting Steve back to his family. Especially our resident Daredevil
“What the hell is going on out here?” Rhodey exclaimed, walking into the kitchen to see the twins crying, Steve looking ready to cry, Tony starring in shock, the counter broken, and the frying pan starting to release black smoke as whatever was cooking was starting to burn.
"Come on Nomad, it's about time you saw the tower" He couldn't help the grin that spread across his face, because Tony was allowing him to finally come to the tower. He could finally go home for a short while.
"Hey" Tony grabbed his chin and forced him to look at him. His eyes were filled with determination, so brave and strong. "Nothing, and I mean nothing is going to happen to them. Only a fool would try and steal our babies. Not only would the two strongest superheroes, don't tell the others I said that they might hurt me, be out for their blood, but they'd have every other hero following right behind them. We may have all broken up and we don't agree on things, but if there is one thing I'm certain we could all agree on it's them" Steve had never felt more in love with the man then he did in this moment, when he was talking about protecting their kids.
Steve looked up and his breath halted a little as he caught sight of the other man. Bright, unsure brown eyes looked back and forth between him and Howard.
Peter was two months old before they returned to their lands in the north. The people cheered as they returned safely, and rejoiced further when they saw that the heir had been safely born.
Tony gave a cry of his own as he saw Natasha and Sam helping Steve into the tent. There’s a horrible wound on his husband’s side, blood pooling. The Lord is unconscious and deathly pale, but Tony can see a slight rise and fall of Steve’s chest.
There was an eerie silence in the cold dark of the room. Water dripped from a leak in the ceiling, and it created the only sound, a persistent drip, drip, drip on the cold stone floor.
Steve gasped as he woke, blue eyes wide as he tried to put together his surroundings. There were white, bright lights burning his vision. He definitely detected the distinct smell of a medical-type facility. Maybe he was down in medical? Had they survived the crash and gotten their systems functioning again while he was unconscious?
The morning eventually did come, and just as promised, Steve was there in the bed beside Tony when he woke. He had obviously been up for a little while. He held a leather-bound book in his hands, eyes quickly roaming the pages. Tony watched him for a moment before a yawn betrayed that he was awake. Steve looked over at him and smiled, threading a small strap of leather that was sewn into the spine between the pages to keep his place as he closed the book.
Tony put his cup down carefully on the table. “No…they don’t,” he said honestly. “I hope I didn’t offend, I am just shocked that you’d be given such a responsibility.” He did look at Steve then, curious instead of mad. “You appointed her to her status?” He asked, almost hopefully.
He’d buried Bucky. In so many ways. He’d been the love Steve could never have. The time they grew up in making it damn near impossible, then the war. He’d met Peggy and thought that was his answer. Finally, he’d met a girl he could be happy with. He could get over Bucky, be the brother that the other man needed. Then he’d lost him, watched him fall, and he’d known he couldn’t. As much as he loved Peggy, he couldn’t go on. It had been so easy to let himself sink that ship. He’d had Peggy’s picture out, and he’d imagined Bucky’s next to it as the ship crashed, and he let the cold dark overtake him.
“Well…” Tony said as the silence stretched on for a moment. That got a beautiful laugh from Steve, one that was very similar to the first Tony had heard, when he’d first met and honestly, first fallen for this amazing man. Tony smiled and ducked his head a bit to hide the blush that was no doubt on his cheeks.
Though, he supposed few more hours couldn’t hurt. He walked into the en suite bathroom, taking his time for once as he showered the grime, blood and God knows what else off of him. He let himself enjoy the water, not knowing if he’d get a moment like this for a while after he left today. He really should leave soon, before anyone notices or tries to come up to see him. Namely, Steve.
Tony felt a light flush heat up his cheeks. He hoped it didn’t show, with it being dark out. “Thank you,” he said again. What was with this Alpha and making him wordless? Tony Stark was never at a loss for something to say, ask anyone.
“Thank you,” Steve said quietly. Tony tensed a little and then nodded sharply. He stepped back, making Steve’s hand fall away, and then he turned, not looking back at Steve as he left.
“We’re definitely going to need to carry this around for you! I didn’t catch a word of that.” Tony set it on Steve’s bedside table.
After another moment of silence passed between them, Tony looked Steve in the eye again. “You’re forgiven. I understand now that you didn’t mean it how it sounded.” It was the least he could offer. By the gods, maybe this was the best-case scenario. He got an understanding and liberal Alpha, and pleased his father at the same time.
The announcement was made public first thing, sounds of horns and declarations of the trial time was announced. Riders went to tell the farmers who lived on the outskirts. It was set for early afternoon, after everyone’s midday meals.
It wasn’t anything like a normal suit. It had working cogs and gears that made it automatic. He had blades that came out of the arms, which he could activate with a press of a button. This would keep him and his child safe. It was sleek, with a surprising amount of mobility. Tony knew his genius; he knew the suit was beyond what had been invented in the past.
Pepper had been a slave, sold into the trafficking that was prevalent in the West. When the caravan had come through, Tony had seen her. A small, scared child, covered in dirt. He’d asked his father for her, to be a handmaiden, and surprisingly Howard had agreed and bought her. The first thing Tony did when they’d taken her back to the clan was tear that collar off her neck.
It was something he needed now, though, he thought. He needed to center himself, to put himself back in that place all those years ago. It was something that he and Bucky disagreed on, he knew. Sometimes thinking of the past helped Steve, whereas Bucky would rather move on. Steve understood, of course.
“It’s done. They could not overcome our numbers, with all the loss they had suffered. I…I killed Obadiah by my own hand,” Tony admitted softly. It had to be done; he knew that. And he was glad he’d been the last thing that snake had seen, but it wasn’t exactly easy on the psyche.
“My mind’s eye saw our son in one of those small graves today. I couldn’t help it. I’m terrified of that coming to pass,” Tony admitted. Steve’s hand stilled for a moment, and he could tell what he’d said had hit hard. The Alpha was letting it sink in, wondering what was best to say in response.
He stumbled back to his room, found his bed and willed himself to sleep, ignoring the tears on his lashes and the cuts and bruises on his knuckles.
“Like I’m letting you get stuck with some bigot here. There must be an Alpha that thinks just as Steve does in his clan. That is if you want an Alpha at all,” he said as he waggled his eyebrows at her. Pepper blushed brightly and swatted at him lightly.
Damn, Bucky Barnes cleaned up nice. He’d trimmed his scruff, and pulled his hair back out of his eyes with just a little bit of product, and if Tony hadn’t been sure this was a date before, he definitely knew it was one now.
Peter didn’t wait. He was born that night, just five hours later. Tony’s screams were more than likely heard through the whole camp. He hated the fact that the prisoner probably heard him too. But he quickly put that out of his mind.
Tony let out a shaky sigh and tried to calm down. He was comforted by the other Omegas’ logic. He actually managed to get his nervous shaking down enough that the crowd probably wouldn’t notice. Steve might, but he had a feeling the Alpha would not hold it against him. Weddings did tend to cause nerves.
“I will never surrender to an Omega. You shouldn’t even be on this battlefield. Where is your dear husband? I do hope my blade struck true. Is that why he’s not here? Did he perish?” Obadiah sneered at him.
Bucky’s eyes had gone wide, a little curious, and maybe a little hopeful? But that didn’t make sense. Bucky didn’t want him like that, and now he had Tony. “Holy shit, we’re idiots,” Bucky breathed out, and that was definitely not the reaction Steve was expecting.
Steve choked a little at Tony’s words, his blush rising to the tips of his ears. Tony’s terrible brain had to wonder just how much of Steve’s skin could get all rosy pink like that…he’d log that experiment idea for later use.
Tony fixed his eyes on Obadiah’s, not shying away, not breaking eye contact. “Oh, I’m sure the children Steve and I raise will be more than ready to bring both our clans into a new era,” he replied stonily. Obadiah sneered a bit but quickly erased the look on his face so he didn’t give himself away. Though, he’d already said enough to make himself obvious about where he stood on things.
Once he parted the tent door’s rich red fabric, the voices stopped, and eyes were turned towards him. Steve and Howard were sat at the round meeting table, parchment spread around them. Steve smiled softly as he saw the Omega, and his eyes definitely dipped for an appreciative glance as well. Not that Tony particularly minded the wandering gaze.
“Marry me. Please. I want to leave this place,” Tony found himself saying in a breathless whisper. His eyes turned from joking to a little desperate, and Steve seemed to sense it immediately. His own features went from joyful to somber as he sensed the shift in Tony’s scent. Fear, anxiousness.
Howard seemed to think this over for a moment before nodding. “Yes, of course. Rhodes will be a loss in our ranks, but I know you are good friends. He will be assigned as your personal guard,” Howard agreed easily enough and Tony felt relief wash over him. He even offered his father a slight smile.
“You will be married in two days time,” Howard decided with an authoritative air. “After that, you will leave with him, and further discussions of sending populations to the North will occur afterward.”
“Yeah, it’s been a long time coming, but it seems to finally be perfected. Just in time too,” Tony sighed as he reached back and grabbed it. He turned it off and then said something Steve couldn’t understand.
“Yeah, it’s unconventional. But who gives a shit? If we make each other happy, that’s all that matters. Everything and everybody else can go shove it. We deserve it, especially you and Bucky. After all the hell you two have been through, all that you do to keep people safe,” Tony argued, looking like he’d fight anyone on this. Steve did notice a slight theme in there though. Tony didn’t think he deserved happiness as much as Steve and Bucky did.
He swallowed and stepped forward as soft beating drums sounded. Those who hadn’t noticed that he had stepped out turned then, watching as he stepped forward with Pepper and Natasha in front of him, Rhodes behind him as a protective barrier.
“You got it,” Tony answered, watching as Bucky left. He let out a delighted laugh as the super soldier gave him a wink. Honestly, his heart was hammering in his chest, butterflies fluttering in his stomach, and damn how long had it been since he felt like a high schooler?
Tony saw Clint and Rhodes take up their bows and Steve pulled his shield from his back. It was an idle thought, but Tony decided that he needed a preferred weapon of his own. A staple. For now, he dealt with the sword that was in his hand.
Steve was, of course, oblivious to Tony’s inner thoughts about how wonderful he smelled, which the Omega was infinitely glad for. “No, it needed to be discussed. Though, I do wish he’d let you stay. You need to know the information as well. I’ll pass it along to you,” Steve said as he took an offered cup of wine from Sam with a smile. Tony was still in awe that Steve wanted him to know the details of the alliance. He tried to take it in stride, though. It seemed as though he should quickly get used to having more rights than he’d grown up with.
“You’re at least a few hours from being ready for birth,” Bruce told him as he checked between his legs again. Tony willed the pup to wait until his father came home.
“You’re right, we should. I’ll start on it,” Steve answered, his large palm splayed over Tony’s still-flat stomach. Tony relaxed back into the Alpha’s hold, full of happiness.
Bucky kissed him yet again, wanting more. It was a little slower this time, as they memorized each other's lips, how the other felt and tasted. He heard a soft little sigh come from Tony that made his blood rush straight down. Wasn’t there supposed to be a rule about not doing this on the first date? Bucky decided he didn’t really care all that much, honestly.
“Good morning,” Pepper greeted as Tony slid the silk over his head. It was a rather warm day, like most days in the south. The nights got cold here, but the days were usually warm enough that most people wore thin, draping fabrics. Especially omegas, whose usual dress consisted of things like Tony was wearing now.
The meeting went on, talk of how to ration out the food, what buildings needed repairs since they’d been abandoned but now they were lived in again. In the cold of winter, these types of things needed to be decided on and fixed quickly.
He let his eyes close and listened to Pepper’s soft breathing beside him. Tomorrow, they’d make the announcement to both the Stark clan, and those visiting from Rogers’ clan. Lord Steven and the heir to Stark clan would be mated. Tony would be leaving this place for good, hopefully to a better life, with a new family.
Tony felt resolute as they marched on down the path, day after day. He did not give up his determination in the slightest. It did admittedly get harder for him to move around, though. A month into the journey, he was seven months pregnant and getting bigger still. He worked on his suit almost daily, making adjustments for his growing size.
The more he read, the more his stomach dropped, the sicker he felt. There were instructions, words on how to get the Asset to comply. That’s what the Soviet notes called Bucky. The Asset. He wasn’t even human to them.
There was a beat of silence, a resistance. Then, a crack of a sharp hand over the Asset’s face. “Who. Do. You. Work. For?” Pierce hissed lowly.
That made Tony pause, even more, surprise surely evident in his facial expression. Bucky let out a laugh, obviously sensing Tony’s disbelief. “Yeah, I like the fellas just as much as the dames. Of course, couldn’t admit it back in the day. Would’ve been locked up at best, dead at worst,” He explained with a frown and a shake of his head.
There was a knock at the door and Steve sighed. He had been in Malibu only a handful of days, but it felt like he had to put on a costume every time he had to be Prince Brock. This time it was harder to fake it.
“Technical drawing is a good skill to have and art appreciation broadens the educational experience,” Mr. Rogers said, as neutrally as possible.
Tony locked his eyes on Steve then cleverly loosened up his tie so that the knot fell apart and stepped away from Steve, leaving the tie in Steve’s hand. “We need to check the other rooms.”
“I’m going to be 18, I’m going to college, and my dad needs to get out there and date someone. I don’t want him visiting me every weekend in college. I love him but --”
He cared about Steve way too much to try to rush through the whole scene. Steve had obviously planned it out, having even written a script so he wouldn’t lose his way when talking to Tony. So Tony had to let Steve play it out from beginning to end.
He had so many emotions. He loved this child, was so glad he was here. He was devastated that Steve wasn’t here to see his first-born come into the world. He was relieved that the worst of the pain was over.
Steve groaned above him and started a slow pace, but eventually got quicker with it once he noticed that Tony was more than relaxed. Tony let himself melt, legs open and back arched for his mate. It was so incredible, nothing at all like some of the horror stories from other Omegas he’d heard about.
“Of course, love. You can go there anytime you wish. I can clear out one of the rooms here. You can have a study for all your inventions and books of your own.” And those were the magic words. Tony grinned and immediately went to close the door, pushing Steve back toward the bed.
Their plan on catching Obadiah and his army off guard seemed to be working. They got ever closer to Tony’s childhood lands, their march on the paths quiet. They got so close that they decided to set up a camp and a perimeter. It was something far more permanent that they had set up on nights previous. This took about a week to do, as they got prepared to make a possible stand if their night raid didn’t work.
The battle only raged a half-hour more. Soon, what was left of Obadiah’s followers surrendered rather than get slaughtered. They’d take them as prisoners and no doubt decide to hang them once a trial was had.
“Alexander, that rat bastard,” Nick cursed. Alexander Pierce was one of the council members from the Stark clan. He and Nick had been good friends when they were young, although no official alliance had even been written between their respective clans. Nick had been sorely disappointed when he hadn’t seen Pierce among Tony’s supporters.
No one mentioned it, though. They were all too consumed with getting back to Rogers-controlled land. Tony pushed the thought of children aside whenever he thought of it. He couldn’t afford to worry about it yet. He needed to focus on surviving the dropping temperatures as they trekked further and further north.
Steve nodded as he let that sink in. Okay. He could work with this. A human colony that was just starting to learn of the Federation. At least they were allies, in a sense.
“Good, you’re in working condition. Who do you work for, Soldier?” Came the cold voice of Alexander Pierce again, echoing against the stones.
Steve stood there, looking every bit leader and Alpha. He was gorgeous, wearing the formal furs of his people. The coat he wore was white, the fur lining his shoulders in such a stunning way. He barely cared or noticed as Howard let him go. He stepped up to his intended, brown eyes connecting with blue.
"Romanov, no" he shoved it back. It was childish, but he didn't care. So what if he didn't eat? He's been through much worse. So what if he has the fastest metabolism and needs to eat at least six meals a day, and so what if it could hurt the
Perhaps god was punishing him for what he did. Steve didn’t regret what side he took and if he knew the outcome before the ‘war’ he’d still stand on the side he did. But he did regret dragging his friends into his mess and ruining their lives. Clint and Scott were lucky to take a plea deal and be with their families, but Nat, Wanda, and Sam were wanted and had to hide with him. Deep down he knew it wasn’t his fault, they were adults and could make their own choices, but that’s who Steve was. He takes all the blame and guilt and puts it on his shoulders. He’s Captain America, that’s what he does.
Rushing, seriously he was doing too much rushing today, he picked up the phone praying Tony hadn't hung up.
"Of course" Steve jumped a little at how cold the gel was, eyes flashing for a split second to the ice, before composing himself and relaxing. He had really been trying to get better at how he reacted to the cold, but living in an African country there wasn't much to practice with.
"Your kids will be lucky Steve. A twin bond is a special bond" Steve took a chance and rested a hand on her shoulder and that's all it took for her to slump into his side and sob. He stroked her hair hoping he was being comforting. Tony liked to be held after he woke from a nightmare and had calmed down a bit. He didn't like to be touched right away, needing the space to work out his thoughts, but when he was ready he was a teddy bear.
"And have you? Processed?" Steve picked at a loose thread from his t-shirt that was becoming longer the more Steve pulled but it offered a pleasant distraction.
"The pink side is vanilla, and the blue side is chocolate" one of the waiters told them as he started to cut it, and went wide eyed as people started shouting what they wanted.
“I’d love to” they grinned at each other, only looking away when Maria threw a cheerio at James, who copied her.
"Twins. You'll have to start eating even more, and make sure to stick to healthy foods, remember the list of no no foods I gave you, but don't forget to eat a snack every once in a while. Having chips or pizza will not hurt the baby, and it will help your mood. Nobody could eat only vegetables for a week and be happy. No pushing yourself in the gym, and in a few weeks no gym all together. It is unfortunate that vitamins will not work on you, so we have to do everything as natural as we possibly can" Adia wiped off his stomach and helped him stand up while giving him a picture of his peanut babies and he thanked her for her time before making his way out of the medical ward. They weren't the size of peanuts anymore, but that was the nickname around the palace when everyone found out, so that's what they would be called until they were born.
"Shut up Wilson. You dip your french fry in the ketchup, you don't cover them" Bucky argued back and Steve smiled fondly at the scene in front of him as he looked at everyone. Sam and Bucky were sitting at the table arguing about french fries, Natasha was reading a book in the adjoining living room, and Wanda was watching tv.
"That's enough Tony!" Pepper finally snapped, and it shocked Tony enough to listen. "Should Steve have told you? Yes. But see things from his perspective; he's a wanted criminal. The kids could be taken from him. If he had called you you could have turned him in, and taken the kids. Now before you say you would never" she cut off Tony who was about to say exactly that "he doesn't know that. He was on a different side then you, and he almost killed you in a fit of rage. He probably wouldn't blame you if you took them" why did she always have to be right?
Natasha was confident that the rest of the team, combat trained by Steve, would be fine. She wasn’t as sure about Steve. She gently worked the cowl off Steve’s face and loosened the neck guard. “The EMTs are going to be here any minute. The team can beat up the Masters of Evil without us.”
“As far as I know, the calendar is clear. The team is going to see a movie or something like that? Please, no robot movies -- I can’t keep writing Hollywood producers about making better robots -- that last one --”
So maybe Tony occasionally being a cat wasn’t the worse thing Steve was facing. He liked cats and he liked Tony.
. I thought about doing one of those promposal things and knowing my luck, I’d have to go fight aliens or AIM or HYDRA. And what if you said no?”
Tony rested a hand on his face, breaking him from his thoughts. “Steve, all will be well.” Then he leaned forward to kiss Steve, a sweet first kiss full of wonder and joy.
He shrugged. “You’re Tony Stark, genius, millionaire, Iron Man. I’m just Steve. I had to work up the courage to ask you to the prom for weeks. I didn’t think you’d agree to it.”
The motion of Tony’s arm caused the chair to spin around. Tony flailed on the moving chair and Steve hurried to grab the chair. One of Tony’s cufflinks caught on the buckle of Steve’s gas mask and ripped it open. Steve’s mask fell to the floor, but he’d managed to stabilize the chair. Only for Tony to fall off the chair and smash face-first into the wall.
