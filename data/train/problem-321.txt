John started jogging back to his teammates, giving his newly appointed good luck charm a final look over his shoulder. Was that a wink? Sherlock was losing his mind, and what worried him most was that he didn’t care.
Sherlock tried to lend his drawings some of the determination John displayed on the field. Even when John was facing away in a sketch, he used the tense nature of his shoulders or the quick backpedal of his spikes in the earth to immortalize that moment on paper. The most amazing thing was that even if the team replayed the maneuver a hundred times, John would execute his role with precision that struck a chord with Sherlock that resounded in every corner of his mind. On the field, John was a small part of something larger, perfectly in sync to the workings of his teammates.
"There's someone at the door, John," Sherlock said. Jawn could already picture his fingers steepled like we're when he came across something perplexing.
“Wow, really?” the boy clapped John on the back. Sherlock tensed at the stranger being able to touch and converse with John so easily. He wanted that too. He wanted to be closer to the one who now filled his thoughts and the pages of his sketchbook.
"Go on and do another," Mary encouraged him. Sherlock swallowed hard and leaned across John to kiss at the hollow of his collar bone, resting a hand on John’s thigh to balance himself, though he could have just as easily put it on the sheets to the side of him.
A hesitant touch settled on Sherlock’s side just above his hip and he realized with a jolt that it was John’s hand. John liked what he was doing, he thought with a thrill. It was enough to summon the bravery to skim his teeth along the spot at the base of John’s neck before pulling away.
John keep the pace, thrusting the toy with unforgiving accuracy and lingering over just the right spots to make Sherlock's knees weak. It was so much better than his fantasy or anything he'd done to himself. This way Sherlock could let go of the concentration it took to maintain the image of John and instead focus on the reality of John. He was nearly enjoying himself too much to catch John's next words.
"That's up to you," Sherlock said in his deep baritone. It might be the most considerate thing his flatmate had ever said to him.
Sherlock untucked the tighter shirt from John's jeans and pulled that up over his head too. He put an effort into touching John as little as possible, even if it seemed backwards in this context. As a result, John shivered when he did feel Sherlock's fingertips on his skin.
John reached behind Sherlock for two packages of condoms on the nightstand. He handed one off to his wife.
Three days was far too long to stew about the possibilities of their next encounter. Sherlock tried to make a lengthy list of limits to show he had put thought into it, but ended up crossing out most of them after realizing that he was completely comfortable with the acts if John was the one doing them. In fact, thinking over the sheer potential was getting him ruffled, more so than he’d planned. He stared at the list and scanned down the items he had crossed off.
Vibrator/Dildo. Sherlock did, in fact, own a dildo. He hadn’t put it to use in quite some time, but remembered vividly how satisfying penetration could be. Working both his cock and the dildo simultaneously became too much to concentrate on near the end, but if someone else was in charge- John, for example, it would be completely doable.
John withdrew completely. Sherlock nearly sobbed at the absence. He felt empty except for the memory of lightning in his veins. It was strangely… good. A harsh kind of good. Whether Mary had planned it this way or not, his arousal had doubled when she denied him his request and his felt a renewed need to be filled, stronger than before.
It didn’t take Sherlock’s level of observation to count that there was one more warm body in the classroom than there should have been. Third hour life drawing was usually filled with a dull mix of arrogant prodigies and bumbling slackers. Today, there was one new exception.
The sensation pulsed through his whole being, leaving him tingly and raw. He felt the rush of air on his lips that must have been his own loud, gasping breaths. Everything was happening in calm clarity as John slowed his movements. It was strangely peacefully, shattering apart and watching the pieces fall around him. He hoped that if he were to be gradually reassembled, John would be the one to do it.
“Why do you keep starting over?” the girl that sat next to him asked. They’d been in the same seating arrangement all semester and he still didn't know her name.
Sherlock sighed and dropped the book on his lap. He couldn’t go through with it. Even if John Watson hurt him, he couldn’t go back to the way things were. Now that he knew the excitement of another person looking at him with an earth-shattering grin, the feeling of his knees going weak from a quick exchange of words, he could never go back to being the cold, unconcerned, bored Sherlock from a month ago.
Sherlock was suddenly acutely aware of how spread out he was, kneeling over John’s legs. He tightened his hold on John’s shoulders and looked down into his lap. He had not expected John to be fully erect. That was… wow. If he hadn’t been flushed before he certainly was now.
“One more, darlings, then it’s John’s turn,” Mary said. She was resting her head on one hand and looked quite content.
Laughing with John was like slipping into something more comfortable. He felt some of the nervousness and tension between them slip away, enough to go on to the next matter of importance.
“Hello boys!” she said cheerfully. “Sorry I’m late, got held up in transit. Awfully long wait when you’ve something to look forward to.”
"Sorry," Jawn answered, hand already on the door nob. "I've caused enough paradoxes for one visit. I don't think we'll meet again. Ta!" He left with a quick backwards wave.
“My, not even a rebuttal?” Mycroft crossed his arms and leaned into the doorframe, making Sherlock painfully aware of his amusement. The image of a cat toying with his food came to mind. “You really do have it bad.”
Her thrusts were shallow at first. Sherlock did his best not to compare the feeling to any of the times he'd been in this position before. He wanted this to be separate and special. Shortly after having the thought he mentally kicked himself for being so sentimental.
“...I had a lot of ideas on how we would start and I decided the best way would be a game of sorts. Both of you sit on the edge of the bed and face the camera," Mary directed. "Good. Nice work with the angle, John. I can see both of you just fine."
“Ta, what would they do without me?” John flashed a smile instantly dropped Sherlock’s mental efficiency by twenty-five percent.
Cockring/Orgasm denial. This one mostly sounded painful, but he really didn’t have a problem with it. From his research, this was a common power play and he fully expected Mary would use it. It would be an interesting challenge if he were tasked with stimulating John while he staved off completion. Sherlock would calculate how much he could take and skirt the edges of his self control, giving John just enough to flush and writhe. He wondered if John would look at him with pleading eyes and beg for more. He wondered what he would look like when he finally gave it to him…
Bondage. He seriously doubted John could restrain him with anything that he couldn’t find a way out of in a few minutes. The idea of staying immobilized willingly, however, was something much more realistic. Sherlock was confident that John could spin words more binding than iron and more compelling than lace. He swallowed a lump in his throat and read the next item.
He could imagine the awkwardness of the locker room. It would be filled with boys he was supposed to trust in various states of undress, hitting each on the shoulder and generally making fools of themselves. Sherlock knew he would hang back from the ruckus, waiting to get a chance at privacy, all the while hating whatever twisted state of mind that had got him into this mess.
John waited for an explanation. "So? What's the hypothesis? Variables? Any information I'm allowed to know?"
Recognition by other students meant a varsity match. What sporting event happened last night? Of course. Rugby.
“I asked you to drive me to a school function, not delve into my psyche,” Sherlock protested. He was growing exceptionally weary of his brother’s bullshit. How could one check their face for blemishes with a law student over-analyzing their every move?
No, stay strong, Sherlock. “That was before I found out how many #1 fans you had. Captain.” He walked around a dumb-struck John and practically sprinted to class.
Sherlock pretended to be invested in the conversation about how the home team would have to make up the twelve point difference in the next half, but his attention kept drifting back to the field, hoping to catch a glimpse of a certain blonde captain. To his surprise, one of the players, the only one he cared about, waved in his direction. Sherlock gave a tiny wave back, small enough that no one would notice if he was mistaken and John was actually waving at someone else. To his alarm and delight, John started jogging toward him. Sherlock excused himself from the conversation with Molly’s friends and approached the chainlink fence that divided the throng of students from the field.
Try as he might, Sherlock couldn't look away. Some sane corner of his mind hoped that John didn't notice, but an alarmingly large, reckless part of him wanted the exact opposite.
"Danger," Sherlock answered for him. "You were being slow," he said in response to John's peeved expression.
Any of these things alone would have put Sherlock in some compromised state of mind, but what dealt the final blow was John’s expression. Collected without being passive. Focused without being intrusive. Worst of all was his line of sight pinpointed on Sherlock.
John cleared his throat before explaining. “She wants you there with me when she calls, and, uh, she wants to tell us what to do. Together.”
Sherlock never jumped to conclusions without facts, but the observations cropping up around John Watson were all pointing to hopeful, and not just for the sake of his wife. It was a tempting verdict, and Sherlock concentrated very intently on stowing it somewhere he could quickly forget. It would do him no good to assume John returned feelings that he actually did not.
Sherlock got to the floor perhaps a tad too quickly, his shins hit the hardwood with a smart thump. John winced sympathetically, a detail which Sherlock chose to ignore.
"Sit up and spread your legs, darling. That's it," Mary encouraged her husband. "How does he look, Sherlock?"
Sherlock wished he believed in sorcery and enchantments. Maybe then he would have an explanation for being powerless to resist John’s request. He nodded, and the miracle of John’s smile spread across his face.
The instant Mycroft’s car pulled away, Sherlock had many regrets. He hadn’t been to a sporting event since primary school and whatever ruckus he had just walked into was not that. Students pushed past him on all sides, streaks of their school colors under their eyes like warpaint. Everywhere he looked, clusters of teenagers and families were grinning and laughing, excited for a night out after a long week. The bleachers bordering the field were so full that people had taken to spreading blankets on the ground. Sherlock had neither a blanket, a place to sit, or friends to sit with. Maybe it wasn’t too late to ask Mycroft to come back? He might still be in the parking lot with the way traffic had been.
He was clearly skilled at what he was doing and he... enjoyed it. Sherlock had eaten out a man before and was not fond of the memory. John, however, was almost smiling as he licked and exhaled hot breath on his wife's skin.
"Don't be ridiculous, John," Sherlock was sitting up now, his sound had changed angles. "Everyone else rings the bell. Except Mycroft. The cake-munching sod simply walks in."
The announcer, who was most likely the phys ed teacher, listed off the names of the starting line up. Sherlock thought the ceremony of it all was a waste of time until-
"Oh, that was fantastic," Mary sighed. John pulled out and rolled to the side. Mary followed and flopped on top of him. The two began to kiss, sweet and satisfied. Sherlock tried not to feel so cold in the absence of their touch.
Sherlock licked John’s cock from base to tip, swirled his tongue around the head, effectively cutting off the sound of John’s voice. Sherlock repeated the movements, lingering where he felt John needed it. If his stifled groans were any indication, his intuition was sound.
Sherlock tried with little success to ignore the digit making steadily wider circles just inside his sensitive ring of muscle. “I-” he started shakily. “I thought… if the humidity increased, then the flesh would decompose at a faster rate than the drier climate chambers, because bodies found in the des- ah…!”
John placed a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “You alright?” he asked. Sherlock nodded, the tenderness in his voice had sent him reeling. John was aroused and holding him, kissing him, caring for him. It was so right that it hurt. John kissed him more, along his jaw and down his neck. He licked his pulse and Sherlock could swear from the shape of his lips that he was smiling when he kissed the shell of his ear.
There was a suckling sound and then a pop from the laptop speakers. Sherlock tried to imitate whatever Mary was doing with his own tongue. She must have given John some sort of signal, because he started to move. Sherlock stilled his tongue and relaxed his muscles, letting John set his own pace.
The good news was that they’d be getting their figure unit work back the following Monday. Sherlock could finally collect the product of his shame and put this whole thing behind him.
“Not good at chemistry?” Samira said, incredulous. “Um. He has very good chemistry with about half the school.” It must have been some kind of inside joke, because Sherlock was the only one who was not amused.
“No, and that’s why it’s tough,” the girl said with a small smile. “I’m drawing my dad. He died, a while back, and the thing I remember most about him was how he always tried to make others happy. He did this thing with his eyes that’s hard to describe,” she gestured to the beginning lines of it on her paper. “It was how he looked when he was waiting for the other person to laugh first. It doesn't make sense, I know-”
“I know,” John said. He did? Did everyone know him before he knew them? “Hey, are you going to the game tonight?”
“John,” Mary was back to calm with an undercurrent of command. “Have a go, see what Sherlock likes.”
John’s laughs immediately became coughs. “Actually,” he said when he recovered, “we don’t have much in terms of… supplies. Only these.” He pulled a plain box from under his side of the sofa and showed Sherlock its contents: two wide, soft navy ribbons, a few small bottles of lubricant and, as Sherlock had predicted, a cockring.
Once the knowledge set in that he could feel that way, it wasn’t long before a tidal wave of understanding nearly drowned him. He was in love with John Watson and had been for some time. It all made so much sense in retrospect. Boring, everyday happenings went from taxing to comfortable with John. He could be himself without fear. Life was no longer a frantic search for the next high, be it by brainwork or another means. Being with John made him feel… content. At ease.
Sherlock drew back immediately. John whimpered, actually whimpered, and let his fingers slide out of Sherlock’s hair and fall back to his sides. Sherlock was at eye level with his flushed, twitching member. His mouth watered and he longed to wrap his lips around its solid weight again.
John did as he was told, tugging Sherlock closer to hoist one leg over his shoulder and stretch the other down the expanse of the bed, pivoting his whole body toward the camera. Sherlock felt a pressure at his wrists and remembered the restraints. Without realizing it, he’d stayed exactly where John had put him earlier, rendering the ribbons a mere formality.
It was too early to know anything for certain, Sherlock decided. He didn't know which was the scarier outcome, John rejecting him or John seeking friendship. Or, Sherlock blushed at the possibility, John wanting him past the point of friendship.
John was suddenly having a difficult time forming words. “Alright. Um, would you mind if we… uh. If you want to, we could.” He coughed and floundered his hands.
John gave him a calculating look before turning his attention to the photo. It was in sepia, and not the edited in kind. The paper it was printed on was modern, though, so it must be a scan of an old photo.
“Heads up!” the boy named Michael called out a little belatedly. Sherlock had just enough of his wits about him to cover his neck and duck before the rugby ball bounced on the seat behind him and harmlessly rolled to his feet.
"There's not much to know," Sherlock spoke. "Just one trial." He started making calculations in his head. Height difference, trajectory...
There was barely an inch of space between their bare thighs. John was lightly tapping his foot, making their legs almost brush several times. Sherlock was painfully aware that he was sweating and hoped John wouldn't notice.
At least this one wasn't with himself. Sherlock's lips moved faintly, brushing against John's unbelievably soft and cautious. It lasted a matter of seconds. Sherlock pulled away, leaving John slightly miffed because he should have been the first to break the contact, dammit.
“You’re looking for a perfect answer where there is none,” she explained. “With portraits, you are trying to portray a person, to show the viewers who they are. It’s not a test on how accurately you can draw a nose or an ear, because even pictures don’t really show a whole person, and that’s as realistic as it gets.
"You'd best listen to him, John," Sherlock suggested. He had a faint smile, but the lines by his eyes were tight. He positioned himself between Jawn and John when he returned the camera, feeling a little protective of his present-day blogger.
Asking how John could possibly not know his wife’s porn preferences was out of the question. Sherlock settled for looking appropriately cautious and helping John with his coat. Why had he taken it off in the first place if he was only staying a matter of minutes?
Mary sighed happily. "That should do it." She handed the bottle of lube back to her husband. John leaned away from her smooth arse and slicked up his fingers, which he then swirled around her entrance. Sherlock noticed a shiny trail that dribbled down her leg.
John must have finished just after Sherlock because the three of them were collapsed in a pile when Sherlock came back to a state of rational thought.
The first of his action sketches had focused on John’s arm. The arc of his hand was seamless with the trajectory of the ball. There was a certain curve to his fingers that both made the movement appear effortless and indicate the highest level of dexterity. It was a dangerous combination that kept Sherlock focused on that toned skin and commonplace grace.
John opened his mouth, closed it, and pondered. "Most of them get interrupted," he said slowly. Sherlock looked a little smug.
Jawn beamed. "Now that that's settled," he handed a camera to Sherlock, "I'd like to get a picture with myself. For the husband, if you don't mind."
“My hypothesis was correct,” he said. John’s fingers settled into a rhythm, in and out with the occasional flex. “The least humidity rendered the slowest decomposition, but…!” He had to bite his lip to keep from groaning; John had three fingers in him now.
John didn't finish his thought, it died in his throat when he saw... himself on the other side of the door.
Sherlock took a deep breath. His arousal was gone and he felt in control again. The Watsons were enjoying this game and he had to admit that he was too. For however long they chose to share that part of themselves with Sherlock, he would take it, and that was that.
When Molly bid him goodbye at the door, Sherlock turned in the direction of his next class and nearly had a heart attack.
One of John’s hands traced up Sherlock’s spine to tangle in his hair. There was a shift in the air, so quick that Sherlock’s mind didn’t register it until John had already parted his lips and was kissing him deeply. Sherlock was dizzy with the proximity of it. John kissed with the same thoroughness he applied to sex, but with no destination. They both existed in this moment, unhurried, with just the languid heat of their mouths and the soft press of their skin.
“Until next time, John,” Sherlock returned. They exchanged closed-mouth smiles and went their separate ways.
“What?” Sherlock asked. He scrunched his eyebrows together trying to think if there was some sort of safeword etiquette he’d overlooked. Or maybe his choice wasn’t serious enough? Should he have gone with ‘Mycroft’ after all?
"Alright, Sherlock," Mary continued. "I already know the places where John likes to be kissed, I want you to find them as well. I'll give you three tries, keep it above the waist and off the lips for now."
"Pants too, boys," Mary directed. Her tone was gaining authority as the night unfolded. A control kink, perhaps? Or simple impatience?
“Not if it makes you uncomfortable,” John said quickly. “Maybe you only like it as foreplay, a means to an end, you know? And that’s fine. It doesn’t bother me.”
Mary looked amused. "That's fine, I'll get them." She got to her knees to be at eye level with the last remaining piece of clothing and glanced up at her husband with another one of those sneaky smiles. John gulped again, apparently knowing the outcome of that particular position.
John, not noticing the abrasive tone, obediently pivoted them so Mary had a side view of them both; he used his hands on Sherlock’s sides to coax him to follow when he remained unresponsive. Sherlock recovered quickly and moved to the new position.
"Right," said Jawn. "How to put this delicately? Don't knock it till you try it. Yeah, that's about good."
This new side view opened up so many opportunities, Sherlock was nearly overwhelmed deciding what to draw first. He settled on the legs. John was clad in jeans that were not form-fitting, but were tight enough in some places that Sherlock was able to make an artist’s rendition of the form underneath.
“Yes,” Sherlock continued, putting all his effort into keeping his voice steady. “The preserved state of Egyptian mummies is commonly attributed to the parched climate of the Eastern Desert. I wanted to make a more precise study with a basis on the frequent weather patterns of London.” He allowed himself a ragged inhale after that lengthy string of articulate syllables.
"For one thing," John continued, wetting his lips. "I don't think you accurately represent the male population."
"Right. Now Sherlock, I might ask for either you or John to do something while you can't speak. If you have a problem with anything, raise your hand and we'll stop. If you want to slow down but not stop, raise one finger. Show me."
"You came back for me?" Sherlock replied equally quietly, the awe clear in his voice even through the pain he couldn't disguise.
'I did nothing! She, how do you say? took her own life? I was trying...' Sherlock scrunched his face up in frustration as he tried to find the words. He swam over to John's boat and placed two fingers on his mouth before repeating the gesture on his own mouth.
Mycroft cast a concerned eye on his pod, barely keeping in a sigh. His peoples days were numbered, they were running out of places to hide. The world was shrinking and so was his pod.
Sherlock frowned, unsure of what to do now. He had never hunted by himself before and he hadn't expected anyone to come to the song.
'I'm not going to hurt you; I went out to do some fishing and I saw you..I'm a doctor but I didn't know what to do with you so I brought you here,to my house' John explained calmly. 'Can you even understand what I'm saying?' he added doubtfully, relieved when the merman nodded.
"Back to my bath then? It'll almost be like old times..." John offered before gently helping him on board.
For that was what was in front of him. No freaky but natural phenomenon like snakes with two heads, this was an actual live scientific anomaly! Something that by all means should not exist but clearly did...and mer maid was the name the myths had taught us.
"Is it supposed to look like that? Are they all that size?" Sherlock quizzed as he leaned forward to look closer, one hand coming out.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock's sweaty waist, enough to hurt and leave a mark, but strangely Sherlock didn't feel inclined to care. Silence was dragging though so he did think he should break it. "I should probably take a shower"
John felt a stone drop in the pit of his stomach. No matter what he had done, John knew that he had to at least warn Sherlock.
"Perhaps we passed each other on the street sometime or you were in earshot when I made some caustic remark? Living with me might jog your memory I suppose"
John let it go,  he had more important issues. "Mycroft is going to kill me" came out without his consent.
"I don't think there is anything to explain! It's quite clear what just happened, what does happen...that girl you said you were trying to save-you're a liar and a murder!" John spat.
Over the next few days John wondered over the sudden silence, until one late afternoon he grasped his cane and set off for the place that always had all the answers.
"You don't know how it gladdens my heart to see you alive and well brother, and how much I regret our actions that day" Mycroft intoned gravely. "The pod needs your help Sherlock; as I'm sure you must realise our species is dwindling...you must do your duty and take a mate" he added, getting straight to the point.
It was slightly better than this but my phone caused trouble and I lost it all and couldn't recall everything I wrote before.
"Umm,  no. Not without good reason anyway" Sherlock twanged a couple of strings, just in case John didn't realise how annoying he was being.
Sherlock huffed out a chuckle and pulled away. 'You look tired John, sit on the rock' Sated he could afford to be compassionate.  'You aren't from around here are you?' he asked curiously He had never had chance to speak to a human before and Mycroft constantly warned of how dangerous they were.
"I'd really like that Bill" John smiled "So anyway,  remember that place we went to before we shipped out to Afghan?"
He shivered slightly and hoisted himself onto the sun-warmed rock. They would be moving on soon, the waters of Scotland too cold in winter. But for now it was still late summer and a handful of tourist still came and went.
'Oh Jesus Christ!' John swore. 'You must have had more to drink then you thought, either that or the locals are laughing behind your back!' But as he felt the heartbeat with a shaking hand he concluded there was no way they could make anything so real.
(And tasteful fade to black lol. I'm not very good at sex scenes, I don't think cross species is good place to start! Use your imagination about whether John rubbed himself against Sherlock's tail, or maybe just the delicate caudal fin lmao ;-) :-) )
"Don't be rude John; I'm not everyone! I want to know what every bit of you looks like, I want to understand how all the pieces of you fit together"
Sherlock smiled softly at John who grinned back, already half way in love with the strange creature who defied all logic and science.
'Mycroft please, I'm sorry, I won't do it again! I can't survive without the pod, I'm not even fully grown yet!' Sherlock begged his brother.
John held back a curse but couldn't contain the gasp "Sherlock I can't accept this!" For he had unwrapped a perfect pearl.
John froze and Sherlock looked put out. He flicked his tail like an angry cat then smiled as he remembered what to do. He swam slow circles around the human singing and humming all the while until this time when he repeated the question John answered yes.
Day had turned into night into day fifteen times since Sherlock had last seen John. He was hungry and afraid; what if John had taken the money from the pearl and moved to the city? Perhaps he never wanted to see Sherlock again.
John shivered at the cold wet touch, primal instincts screaming danger fighting a soldiers training. 'Mouth to mouth resuscitation, right.' He steered the boat closer to her and took her pulse. 'She's dead. I'm going to have to call the police'
"You have to put me back John, I can't stay here forever" Sherlock murmured as he carded his fingers through John's short silvery blond strands. "And I need to...to feed, and frankly you need a bath" he added crinkling up his nose.
John had a good look at the creature while he could, examining his ears and lifting up his hand made top: everything was completely ordinary and human, except the gills either side of the rib cage and the elephant in the room that was the, actually rather beautiful, ombre tail going from midnight blue to sky. He, for it was definitely male, didn't even have webbed fingers; just bitten nails and John chuckled-he always thought mer folk sat on rocks combing their hair, not biting their nails.
Thanks to those who have taken the time to leave kudos and please feel free to leave quick comment if you can-I really would be pathetically grateful lol, and it would kick my ass to make me update quicker.
John tossed and turned in his bed as the sound of Sherlock's plaintive whale like cries echoed from the loch.
The older boy shrugged 'If you say so. You're right I suppose; I wasn't swimming here but I heard singing and before I knew it I was here..was it you singing?'
"True Bill very true. You always give the best advice you know that? I appreciate that, I really do, and listen,  no listen, serious face now, I'm gonna make sure you don't die. I am, because that's how much I love you Bill" John declared before becoming distracted by a scene at the door. A tall young man with wild dark curls was gesturing madly at a stocky skinhead who shook his head and shoved him away.  The tall one looked desperately around the bar before locking eyes with John and threading his way through the crowd toward him.
"Yeah. Yeah you're right. You can take the lot, I won't need it where I'm going. I want the whole thing though, I mean if that's ok?"
The mer smirked and sang while he watched : 'On an island I long to be, far beneath the shining surface of the sea. I hear the sound of the ocean wave on wave calling you who have turned away from home'
Thanks for reading, please comment and say hello, I love hearing from you all and knowing what you think.
Things went back to normal, or what passed for normal for them, Sherlock solved impossible cases and John broke up with Vanessa when he found out just how wild she was-breath play in a coffin? No thank you! He still felt like he was missing something where Sherlock was concerned, like having a word on the tip of your tongue that your brain has no command over. Mostly he ignored it, however he couldn't when he came home one evening after a day at work to find the heating full blast and all the windows closed.
'Oh good, that's much easier' John smiled. 'I can take that out for you if that's ok?' he pointed at the fish hook and the mer nodded again, faster.
"Real funny, here was I thinking you didn't even know what a joke was!  It's like when you wake up some mornings and you can't remember what you dreamt about, you just have some vague idea that Barbara Windsor was pulling you a pint in the Queen Vic. You know?"
"You should get that gay curiosity out of your system before we go John" Bill Murray hicuped in his ear "You know in case you die or get your balls shot off. Plus it would suck to have a dishonorable discharge cause you couldn't say no to temptation when you asked some bloke to 'cough please'"
"You're worth a hundred times what I paid" John replied without thinking causing Sherlock to stop and stare as though seeing John for the first time.
Thank you all for the kudos, I didn't expect so many! And big thanks to the two people who left a comment :-) x
Looking meant touching meant Sherlock asking dozens of questions and John lost any embarrassment as he fell into doctor mode as he explained things like why humans needed toes.
"Sherlock, even if it takes ten years off my life, I couldn't imagine going a day without a kiss from you. Starting from today"
John's grin was like the sun emerging from clouds and Sherlock couldn't help but answer it with one of his own.
Sherlock frowned.  John shouldn't sound like that, John was strong and certain of himself. He was compass and anchor.
"I've survived this long John, the skin keeps out the worst of the cold. I have to be here in case the pod comes back...besides, you're here now"
John made his way out to the loch early, not so much to catch anything (though that would be nice) but more because his curiosity was roused by his pub companions talk. It reminded him of the stories his grandmother used to tell and he wondered what it was about the landscape that made the people believe such things.
In John's b and b he suddenly felt unsure. "I've never done anything like this before" he confessed.
The men used to say; never tell your biggest secrets to Bill Murray, not even when drunk because the man had a mind like an elephant. For once John was hoping that the rumours were true.
As he saw the unruly dark curls and pale skin, half in the water, half on the small island like inlet, he couldn't stop the grin that broke out. He raised his voice in a salutation but then he saw the girls body that was lying under the mer's and he remembered the words from his pub companion: they don't all drown themselves.
John's pupils did a strange dance in his head. He closed his eyes, gave his head a shake, and, when he saw that the oddity before had not vanished like it was supposed to, turned to his favorite chair and proceeded to curl up in it.
Both men began unbuttoning shirts and stepping out of trousers. Mary kept talking, it seemed she intended to stay fully dressed.
Molly looked doubtful. Sherlock belatedly remembered she’d seen him turn in his full body in action assignment last week. Whatever judgement she passed, however, she thankfully kept to herself. “Would you like to sit with me?” she asked instead. “I mean, not just me, I’m meeting a few people from my biology study group, but I’m sure they wouldn’t mind.”
There was no telling what kind of noises he made after that. John worked him open and Sherlock was more pliant to his touch than he’d ever been with anyone, he couldn’t get enough of it. John stroked and stretched and it was so intense that Sherlock could hardly breathe.
The first try went by fairly quickly. Sherlock, having already forgotten most of what George had told him before the match, took cues from the crowd on how to react to any given play. He wished several times that he were closer to the field. When he sat in on practices, Sherlock could easily see the player’s (John’s) expressions and actions from the front row. From this distance it was more like watching two colonies of ants fight over a crumb.
A pleasant rain pattered on the roof of the cottage. It was an excellent accompaniment to Sharlock's at-home violin concert of the day. Gladstone was enjoying it, anyway. It was apparent by the tempo of his bobbing tail matching the rhythm of the piece.
“Nn, the rate… was, ah, not linear,” Sherlock struggled through the simple words. “I formulated. An. Equation.”
“Sherlock,” John answered. Hearing his name in that strained, breathy voice was too much. Sherlock groaned around John’s cock.
He closed the lid of his laptop and scrubbed his face with his hands. He couldn’t lie to himself about what he already knew. The facts were these: He loved John and wanted the best for him. He would do anything for John, their current arrangement included. John said it was for Mary and that was fine. If Mary made John happy, then he would play his part quietly and leave them to their married bliss. He could do this. He wanted to do this.
“I,” John started. He closed his eyes for a moment, steeling himself for what he would say next. The pause was an eternity and a second all at once. “Sherlock, I-”
Jawn shooed the idea anyway with a wave of his hand, gold band glinting. "Reawakened an old habit," he explained.
A deep breath from John and words were no longer necessary. He placed his hands flat on Sherlock's chest and dragged them down over his ribs, then the muscles of his stomach. Every inch felt like fire. He wondered through his haze of arousal if he was allowed to kiss and touch John like Mary had to him.
That was it. If Sherlock was going to get through this assignment with any grace he was going to have to do the drawings his own way. He got a new paper from the stack at the center of his table and scarcely had it pinned to his drawing board before lines that made up John began to appear. Deltoid smoothes out into bicep. Tricep less pronounced from this angle. Capture the light on his collar bone. Tuft of hair at the nape of the neck.
It was a firm touch, an assurance and a caress trailing from every point of contact. Sherlock basked in it. He rested his arms on John’s shoulders and let his whole body relax into the embrace. John’s hands settled on his hips, at first lightly, then pulled him closer. Sherlock pressed back, starving to memorize the imprint of John’s lips.
A gasp from above and the feeling of John tightening his grip on Sherlock’s hair was all the incentive he needed to go on. He bobbed his head, keeping everything wet and his movements smooth. Sherlock enjoyed the methodical nature of it. The unwinding of John Watson was almost… relaxing.
“See you around then,” John said. He waved and disappeared into the crowd. Sherlock didn’t get much done but doodles of the same subject for the rest of the day.
Sherlock knew his throwing skills were lacking compared to anyone on the field, so he tucked his sketchbook under his arm and walked the ball down instead. To his surprise and excited embarrassment, John ran up to join Michael at the first row of bleachers.
"The vast majority of them are idiots, so obviously," Sherlock noted as if it were a logical progression of thoughts. It probably was, actually.
“So it seems,” Sherlock replied. Molly turned left and disappeared into the crowd, Sherlock turned right only to collide with someone coming from the other direction.
The rest of class was no more productive than the first portion, but, thanks to Molly, the feeling of imminent combustion had receded somewhat. Since it was clear he wouldn’t get any actual drawing done, Sherlock flipped back to a failed sketch and started listing words.
“I’ve got to turn in, it’s even later where I am and you know how traveling can be,” Mary said. “Good night, boys! I’ll call in the morning for a chat, John. Text me when you’re up.”
“Yeah, you show up to more practices than some of our members,” John said with a pointed look at one such slacker by the water cooler. “You could be a mascot of sorts.”
"Hm," Sherlock mumbled as a response, attention fixed on the kitchen entrance. There was a moment of comfortable silence as Mary finished her tea, followed by a clink when she set her empty cup next the Sherlock's full one on the coffee table.
Sherlock wondered at his own chances of being part of something like that. He could probably pull his weight on the field, given that he was put in a position that was more running than slamming into other, more built players. Picking up on the jargon would hardly be a challenge either, the key to slang was mostly context anyway. It was the social aspect that would pose the greatest challenge, he thought without surprise.
Sherlock bit back a moan and pressed a hand to his crotch as if that would cause his growing erection to subside. He willed himself to stay focused, there were still several limits he had to think about, but all of them looked so appealing thrown into a sentence with John.
The corners of Sherlock’s mouth spread into a smile. “I’d very much like you to kiss me right now,” he said.
“Ha, I suppose it is.” John did that thing, the smiling thing, the thing that made Sherlock’s knees weak. “I’ll see you tonight then.”
It was the most exquisite orgasm Sherlock ever had. Their mouths were still close but no longer connected. They breathed in each other's air and the slightest touch of their gaping lips only added to the fire Sherlock was feeling. He was light-headed and couldn't think and he loved it. His mind was empty except for the knowledge that John could see him. He had come undone and John was watching every moment if it.
Sherlock lay boneless as John mopped up the ejaculate from stomachs and hands. His muscles twitched with over sensitivity at the dildo being removed, though John was especially careful pulling it out.
Sherlock held the page tightly, ready to tear it out. His face felt hot. He willed himself to just do it already. The page perforation strained, but didn’t tear. Idiot! What could he possibly gain from harboring all these childish feelings for someone who would never be as invested in him? If he could just destroy this marker of shame, maybe he could move on. He could go back to the way things were. When things were safer, more concrete. More predictable.
Maybe it would be easier if he wasn’t looking. “You were defending someone,” he said. Yes, this was a much more successful method.
Blindfolds/Gags. Speaking hadn’t been a problem last time, so he doubted the use of a gag would be pleasurable for more than the visual appeal. It did prevent kissing and oral, so the likelihood of Mary choosing that route was small. The blindfold, however, was a more worthy option, for the experimental draw of sensory deprivation if nothing else.
“Celery?” John asked with a pause. “Well. It’s not something that would normally come up doing something like this.” Another pause, followed by a giggle. Faint, but definitely a giggle.
The laptop was situated so Mary had a view of John’s front and Sherlock’s back. Sherlock dutifully clasped his hands behind his back and leaned forward, supporting most of his weight on the bed frame. With his height, he had no trouble finding a comfortable position hovering over John’s cock. His lips were nearly in contact when he made the mistake of looking up.
But John would be there. Maybe he’d notice Sherlock’s discomfort and ruffle his hair, ask him what was wrong. Sherlock would mutter something about being fine, that nothing was wrong, and John would see right through that and pursue the matter. Sherlock would ask him why he cared so much, and John would pin him with that steady look, the one that made him feel trapped and safe at the same time.
“We,” Sherlock struggled to keep his heart from beating so forcefully, “We don’t hang out. I can’t be avoiding you if we don’t have an established pattern of contact.”
Jawn laughed. "Not really. The point is that there are so many other factors besides gender. Would you care for an experiment?" Sherlock's eyes brightened instantly.
Sherlock held his sketchbook tighter and willed himself not to blush. “Sherlock,” he blurted out for lack of anything else to say. What was the use of having a genius mind if it shorted out on him when he most needed it?
“Right,” John nodded. He was fighting back a smile and doing quite poorly. “Not a problem. Perfect, in fact.”
The conversation seemed to be over, but neither of them made a move to step away. Just as Sherlock had gotten up the courage to ask who they were playing, John did yet another thing that erased any chance for coherent thought: he wet his lips.
"The experiment, Dr. Watson," Sherlock reminded Jawn. If it was out of impatience or worry over the sudden flash-forward, it was difficult to say.
John pressed the tip of his cock to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock had the urge to do something rash. He placed a light, closed mouth kiss to John’s heated flesh. A drop of precum fell to his chin. John groaned and pushed past his lips, not stopping until he hit the back of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock inhaled deeply, loving how the smell of John’s musk matched the taste permeating his mouth. John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders in what was must have been an attempt to stop himself from thrusting without Mary’s permission.
"Dare from my other half," Jawn shrugged, his wedding band glinting in the light of the flat. "Hope it wasn't too bad for you." He winked.
John grinned. “You’re not on your way out, are you? I promise we won’t be such rubbish in the next half.” His smile was infectious.
Molly shuffled all her loose papers into a neat pile and stowed them in her art folder, which featured a glossy print of three kittens in a basket on the front. “What class do you have next?” she asked conversationally.
"Good," Mary smiled. She situated herself with a hand on the mattress to either side of Sherlock's head. A look of confirmation from Sherlock and she sank down on his cock. Every inch was hot and slow. Sherlock had never though he could be with a women in this way before. The breasts settling on his chest were uncomfortable and distracting, but he couldn't argue with the arousal that came with the heat and pressure of being inside Mary Watson.
“Stand up, John,” she replied. “Hands on his shoulders. Sherlock, keep your hands where they are, remember the signals.”
Sherlock's half-lidded eyes snapped open. He was right, John was visible now, and his expression caused a wave of desire within Sherlock that was infinitely greater than he had expected. With every slick snap of his hips John let out a shallow breath and occasionally a raspy moan of pleasure. The open gape of his lips begged to be kissed and Sherlock was all too willing to be the one to do it.
Both of them stood, hovering in the silence. John wanted to move, to do something, but he felt as if there were road blocks on all sides of him. Sherlock looked equally antsy, as antsy as he could be while maintaining a neutral expression and not fidgeting whatsoever. Only John could pick out the slight darting movement of his eyes, searching out traces of information before the real event took place.
Sherlock knew he’d done nothing wrong sitting in on practices, but his face heated with guilt all the same. “Biggest fan?” he asked with hesitation.
The connection devolved into a series of kisses. A mere moment after each one John was back, embracing Sherlock with touches that grew fainter and more brief, like he was weaning himself off a bad habit. The hand in Sherlock’s hair loosened and dropped to John’s side with finality and Sherlock took pity on them both and stepped away. For a long time, neither said anything.
Relief swept over Sherlock. Molly would be his guide in this absurd, sporty hellscape. “That would be lovely, thank you.”
“No, Sherlock brought it,” said John. “It’s clean, so either of us could use it, I suppose.” Sherlock detected some squeamishness at the idea. Penetration must be an unexplored or possibly uncomfortable thought for John when he wasn’t the one doing the penetrating.
The chainlink fence made a sound like a rusty bell when John leaned on it, the fingers of his dominant hand wrapped around the interlocking diamonds. “Seeing as we’re doing so poorly,” John continued, his voice almost imperceptibly lower than before, “would you mind putting aside your role as biggest fan and be my good luck charm instead?”
An extra percussion part made an entrance when Jawn fumbled with and dropped his keys outside, cursing as he stooped to pluck them from a puddle on the front step. Sharlock sighed and made his way to the door, not missing a note. Gladstone's droopy eyebrows wrinkled up when Sharlock nudged the door open with his foot, an impressive kick for his age. The wood of the door connecting with the railing outside marked the end to the movement, perfectly coinciding with a triumphant final chord on Sharlock's part.
John’s eyes lit with a hint of amusement. “Yes, and she had another request, if you’re up for it. Skype sex.”
“Chemistry,” Sherlock responded. He usually despised small talk, but somehow Molly did it without making him cringe. He clutched his sketchbook to his chest and followed her out the door.
Mary hummed with satisfaction. “That was excellent. Oh, I can still feel it. Give John a good snog for me, will you Sherlock? He likes that sort of thing after he comes.”
The official excuse was that he needed three sketches of a human body in action. The actual reason for Sherlock repeatedly attending rugby practice involved a more personal interest.
“Don’t make any promises, Mike,” John cut in. “With your aim, it’s only a matter of time before you do some serious damage to our biggest fan.”
John nodded and offered a terse hello. Sherlock drank in the sight of him, always up for a new puzzle. Short with a practical, athletic hair cut. Established tan lines this early in spring definitely pointed to sports. Where had he heard that name before?
Sherlock couldn’t help but compare him to the Greco-Roman statues they’d gone over in preparation for this unit. He looked like a lounging god.
John slid the toy a couple inches out, watching Sherlock for any signs of discomfort. When he found none, he continued at a steady pace, much less than before. Sherlock squirmed impatiently. John used his free hand to press Sherlock's hips down to keep him still. The heat of John's touch stopped him immediately. John looked pleased at his compliance and shifted the angle of the dildo to connect with that spot that sent quakes of pleasure all over. Sherlock arched his head back and gave a shaky exhale.
John picked up the laptop and carried it to to the bedroom with Sherlock close behind with the props. Inside there was a small table, one that wouldn’t have room for more than a reading lamp; it hadn’t been there the last time. John set the laptop on it and adjusted the screen to have a good view of the bed.
"God, that's hot," John said, vocal at last. "Is that really what it looks like?" He walked to the other side of the bed for a better viewing angle.
“Good luck,” he managed to say despite having the mental capacity of a landed fish. He might as well be, with all the staring he was doing.
Sherlock stood, adjusted his collar of his shirt, and laid out his logic. It was rather nostalgic for Jawn. "You are wearing a wedding band. There are no traces of lipstick or perfume about your person, but you have a quarter-shaped bruise at the base of your neck. You have seen your lover recently, but that person does not wear cosmetics. Your clothes are fairly new and your watch is not cheap. The lack of cosmetics is not from necessity, suggesting a male companion. Did you take his name when you married, or keep your own?"
“Sherlock,” John said in his ‘you’d better have a good explanation for this’ voice. “Is that a dildo?”
"How- never mind." Somewhere under John's embarrassment was the hint of a laugh. "This Saturday at nine?"
Sherlock had already filled a page with John’s basic form. He knew he should ignore the details in the interest of time, but there were so many aspects of John he wanted to document. The curve of his shoulder blades and the sinews of his neck were begging for Sherlock to give them justice on the paper. He worked his way down to the lower back and cursed the interruption of John’s trousers on the smooth lines of his skin. He had the sudden and surprisingly strong inclination to draw John without the clothing regardless of reality. He allowed himself a moment to imagine John’s arse and promptly dropped his pencil with a loud clatter.
“I know it’s fine,” John clapped him on the shoulder. “We’d better get back, thanks for stopping by.”
“No, not bad at all,” John replied. His eyes drifted to Sherlock again and caught him staring. John did that thing, the secret smile that made his stomach do certain, very potently pleasant maneuvers. In his effort to look like he hadn’t been ogling him like he was still on the table, Sherlock almost missed John’s wink. John didn’t miss when Sherlock’s complexion suddenly deepened in color.
"No! ...No," Sherlock assured him. "It was perfect, really." He felt himself blush at how much he meant it. John looked relieved.
“I’ll be fine without, thanks,” Sherlock said. He gave his appearance a final once-over and tried out a tiny, closed-mouth grin. It wasn’t half bad.
“Yes, I understand the ideology,” said Sherlock, annoyed. He turned his pencil in the tiny pink sharpener with unnecessary aggression. The girl eyed his overzealous sharpening with caution. “I've adopted my own ideology,” Sherlock continued, “and that is to deny the existence of perfection is to give up on reaching it.”
He got off the bed and retrieved his clothes. He removed his condom and tied it off before dropping it into the basket beside the married couple's bed. They were still snogging, relaxed and content. Sherlock felt a surge of something unpleasant in his belly. He redressed quickly and had his hand on the doorknob before John's voice stopped him cold.
Back at his seat, Sherlock added a sketch of Mike for variety. It was easier to do than he’d thought. Mike was taller than John and had a bit more muscle; his movements were more straightforward, which had a lot to do with his position on the field. It wasn't as thrilling as drawing John, but there was a simpleness to it that was a pleasant break from all the excitement.
“I made them,” Sherlock explained. The corner of John’s mouth quirked up in an ‘of course you did’ expression that Sherlock liked to think of as affectionate. The tip of one of John’s fingers, the middle one on his left hand, most likely- nudged its way inside and Sherlock turned away from John’s eyes, afraid of what his own features were revealing.
The players on the field divided into partners to do passing drills. Sherlock was familiar with their warm-up routine by now. John usually paired off with a boy whose name was Michael; if that was his first or last name Sherlock neither knew nor cared to. He had little interest in details about anyone who was not John or a to-be criminal these days.
"As long as it doesn't rip a hole in time and space," John muttered, shuffling to stand next to his counterpart.
Sherlock had to casually steal his neighbor’s pencil sharpener several times in the next twenty minutes. He had so much data on John stored up from the moment he walked in to now and all of it went to generating untried poses for John. Action shots, stills, close ups, it didn’t matter; Sherlock craved the texture of his skin and the light on his hair. How could he catch the thrill he felt glimpsing John’s impulsive tongue wet his lips or the way his chest fractionally rose and fell with every breath? The more Sherlock committed to unfeeling paper the more he consciously recognized John as a fellow living, breathing, blood-pumping creature.
“I've got maths on the other side of the building, so I guess we go our separate ways until tomorrow.” She gave a little wave.
“No, I see it,” Sherlock said. And he did. Or at least he thought he did. If this girl had anything in common with her father, he definitely did. “What’s your name?”
Sherlock sighed. "To save you the trouble of saying it aloud, I would indeed consent to a threeway with you an your wife."
"Hah," Mary exhaled once she was fully seated. "Now you, John." She lifted her hips to accommodate John's height from being on his knees. The sensation the motion caused, the pleasant slide of warm tissue against Sherlock's length, gave a hint of what pleasure was in store once they started moving in earnest. The anticipation was delicious.
If Sherlock's pants weren't already in pile with his other clothes, he wouldn't have minded the same treatment. What a lucky couple they were, the Watsons.
“You’ll have the hour to draw at least three detailed sketches of our model,” the teacher began. “John will change poses every twenty minutes, so make sure you get all the lines that you need to finish the drawing down before he does. Don’t worry about shading, the name of the game is light contour lines. Any questions? No? Get to work!”
“Terrible,” Samira agreed, “I won’t name names, but he’s been leaving a string of broken hearts with the boys too.”
Sherlock felt guilt, hot and fluid, slosh about in his stomach. He should say no, if not for John then for himself. Nothing good would emerge from a continuation of this arrangement. Especially when he enjoyed it far too much.
Sherlock shrugged. He hoped his smile wasn’t too toothy and ridiculous, because he couldn’t stop if he wanted to.
“This is John Watson,” the teacher announced once the start of class bustle had calmed down. “He will be our first model for the human figure unit.”
In his mind, Sherlock could pretend that he wasn't shy. He’d have something witty to say, something to drive John wild. He’d hear John’s breathing quicken and intermingle with his own. He’d feel the material of John’s uniform and know the exact texture of John’s hair, how it changed if it was wet with perspiration. He was overcome with wanting to know if John’s lips were capped or soft, or the angle that he’d tilt his head, if he’d ease into a kiss or surge up and take it from Sherlock’s eager mouth.
Jawn gave him a squeeze on the shoulder. He hadn't realized how tense he had gotten. He set down the half-eaten biscuit to place a hand on top of Jawn's, identical rings clinking softly.
"Mary," he nodded in return. A quick glance over her person told him what would have taken the average person minutes of nervous dancing around the subject to discover. "This isn't a surprise. John told you ahead of time."
When John wasn’t there, or more accurately, when Sherlock had left, he’d felt it: the grating absence of something very dear. Sherlock wanted to find it again, he wanted to catch it and hold it close for as long as he could. With John no longer in the flat, it was more elusive, but he was catching glimpses of it more and more frequently. Enough for him to hope.
John breathed deeply. It was so good to be in London again. He hadn't had the chance to return as often as he liked now that he was retired. Well, in the future when he was retired. John Watson was not only traveling back to the place where his life began, but the time as well.
"Because... of today," John said lamely, averting his eyes from his flatmate. Sherlock nodded. Outside the flat, a set of feet descended the remainder of the stairs. The door to 221B opened and closed, removing the barriers so the two residents could resume their previous lives. In a sense, nothing had changed
“You’re bloody gorgeous, both of you,” Mary said, a little breathy. “I think we’re ready to move on. John, be a dear and get the restraints.”
"Help me with the zipper, John?" she said casually once the door was closed. John visibly relaxed, the hand he placed on her shoulder seemed to be her steadying him more than the other way around.
“Remember Cosette?” the boy who was not George added. Sherlock vaguely remembered the graduating senior from last year. She was tall, pretty, and had been accepted to study in the States.
"Say," Jawn continued, his casual tone as fake and strained as Sherlock smiling for ordinary people. "Have you met The Woman yet?" Judging by their blank stares, they hadn't. "I see," he said. "Farther back than I thought." His fingers toyed fitfully with the hem of his jumper.
Connection to a group of people on any level was a foreign concept to Sherlock. More and more he envied John and his ability to coexist and rely on something with so many uncontrollable variables involved. He had sat in on enough practices to know that every member of the team was interconnected with trust and sportsmanship and an array of other idealistic values Sherlock would have rolled his eyes at a week ago. Now he saw how important such things were to John; they consistently drove the team to do the physically stunning things that had found their way into the pages of his sketchbook.
The group fell into speculation about various members of the rugby team and what qualified as ‘bad boy’ behavior. By the time they got into the details of a certain 50s musical, Sherlock was too sick to listen. John wasn’t paying him any special attention. He was just another in a long line of flirtations. Sherlock wondered how many other wide-eyed fans had fallen for the ‘good luck charm’ line. God, he was stupid.
Sherlock flipped through his sketchbook in search of a blank page. Nearly all of them featured John Watson exclusively. Some of the other members of his team had made an appearance, but only when strictly necessary to complete a scene. Compared to drawing John, which came so naturally to Sherlock, drawing others was tedious.
Sherlock set the mug in front of him, untouched. Mary sat next to him while John made an excuse to visit the kitchen again. Sherlock watched him leave, weighing the possibility of him backing out of his own offer.
Say it. There wouldn’t be a better time. Sherlock kicked himself for every second that he didn’t spit his words out. If was barely a sentence, he could do it. He turned slightly, drew breath, and-
“Do you think you can do as well taking care of John, Sherlock?” Mary asked, a gentle reminder that the night was not over yet. John cleared his throat awkwardly. Sherlock couldn't help but notice that he had maintained an impressive erection through the aftercare.
Mycroft sighed, already bored with the game. “You’ve changed shirts five times and you’ve been at your hair for the better part of an hour. Mummy told you to wear a hat anyway, what does it matter?”
Sherlock cupped her face for a real kiss. It was minimal, a simple slide of lips. After a few seconds they separated. Mary got up from the couch and held out a hand for Sherlock to do the same. She didn't let go as she led him to the kitchen. John was fumbling with a coffee maker. It didn't take much to deduce that his guilty look stemmed from the image of the sitting room reflected on the glass of the china cabinet.
It didn't take very long for her to be ready. "Sherlock," Mary said. He tore his eyes from John's movements to give her his attention. "I'm going to be on top of you and John is going to take me from behind. Are you alright with that?"
"I would ask for details, but I recall I was present the first time around," Sharlock set his violin on the coffee table. Not the same table as the flat, they had gone through two or three due to the stress of being walked on by detectives in bathrobes.
Kind. Social. Athletic. It was a start, but it didn't go deep enough. Everyone knew that side of John, he wanted to bring out something more complex. Sherlock thought back to the modeling day and kept listing. Confident. Joking. Inviting. Relaxed. Focused.
The art room tables were arranged in a square around a central platform that was really just another table with a cloth draped over it. The teacher instructed John to take off his outer layers (“You want me shirtless?” “Whatever you’re comfortable with, John.”) and pose on the platform. Instead of some sort of ridiculous magazine pose, John had started with a simple cross-legged sit. It gave Sherlock a good view of his back and shoulders, which were indeed bare.
“You ask so nicely when you’re being fucked,” Mary said at last, making Sherlock shiver. “However, asking nicely isn’t going to get you anything, sweetheart. John? He’s ready for the dildo.”
"Yes," Mary said. Her voice was husky and Sherlock could see her arm move faintly at the edge of the frame. She must be rubbing circles on her sex through her clothes. She wouldn't break control to pleasure herself quite yet, but her arousal had grown too large to ignore.
“Oh?” Mary said with interest, though it wasn’t for the cataloguing of rotting flesh. “John, you can give him a bit more, I know you’ve been holding back.”
It was a strange feeling, but not unpleasant. John never went further than his first entry and breathing wasn’t a problem with his slow movements. However, he didn’t want John to compromise his experience thinking he was fragile. Sherlock leaned forward, daring John to go further. After a bitten off moan, he complied.
Sherlock's throat went dry and he had to swallow several times before he could answer. "Amazing. I- ah, it's- I never-" He stopped himself from finishing that embarrassing truth. I never thought it could feel this good.
"Ah... Ah, ah!" Mary was coming. Her shoulders tensed and she clenched around Sherlock, laying flat and going still over the whole of his body. She was soundless for a few seconds before her ragged intakes of breath cut the air at Sherlock's left ear. A majority of him felt her tremble though the sensation, but the minority of him that was now free to feel the dull friction of John's cock was what he cared the most about.
The mattress dipped with John's weight. He crawled over, stopping to sit back on his heels beside Sherlock's torso. Sherlock thought he should say something, but Mary's tongue had resumed its work on his cock and he didn't think controlled speech was within his capabilities anymore.
This pose featured John a little more reclined, more relaxed. Both his hands were placed palm-down on the platform’s surface; he leaned back onto them. One leg he stretched out and the other he bent up so his knee was at the level of his chest.
"She sends her love," Jawn pulled the photo from his pocket. Scrawled neatly in the margin was a note from the woman herself. Sharlock examined it while nibbling the bready treat. It read-
“Time!” The teacher called. “Please throw away any pencil shavings and stack your drawing boards neatly where you found them. Great work today, everyone!”
"Mid twentieth century," Sherlock deduced, looking on over John's shoulder. John jumped a bit at his flatmate's voice so close to his ear, but continued examining the picture.
John stopped mid-thrust. His shoulders hunched, his jaw dropped, and he came hot and thick in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock was enraptured by everything from the crease in John’s brow to the quivering of his thighs. All too soon, John was pulling away and a garbage bin was placed in front of Sherlock so he could spit.
“Sorry about that!” Michael shouted, running up to where the bleachers started. “Mind giving it a toss over here?”
Mary stepped out of her dress, not nervous at all to be the least dressed in the room. Sherlock found that he wasn't uncomfortable in the slightest as Mary unbuttoned the front of his suit and slid it off his shoulders. His shirt followed in much the same way.
He would be undone so quickly by John. Sherlock was struck by the force of how much he wanted John to do that to him, to open him up and fill him, even if it was only a toy that he was filling him with. He could only imagine those calloused hands on his prick, stroking in time with the thrusts of the silicone. John would stay cool and collected as Sherlock became more and more derailed by sensation. Somehow the John in this fantasy looked at Sherlock with something softer than arousal; it was something akin to affection.
Sherlock could feel his resolve crumbling. Why did John have to have puppy eyes, on top of everything else?
“I accept,” Sherlock said with as neutral a tone as he could muster. “Although I would prefer to keep any bedroom activities confined to your flat.” He didn’t need images of a debauched John haunting him whenever he looked at the couch or bedroom door.
Jawn still had his keys to the flat, so he let himself in to 221B. The decency to knock at the top of the stairs did not escape him, though.
"Stop...!" he rasped. Both Watsons looked up at him in slightly comical unison. Sherlock sat up and shifted closer to Mary. He placed his hands on her hips and ran them lightly to her waist and back. "What would you like?"
John continued without missing a beat. “I’ll text you the details, let me know if you’ve got any limits that didn’t come up last time. Mary’s normally pretty tame when it comes to doing, but who knows what she likes to watch, eh?”
"I suppose," John sighed. He looked pointedly at where Sherlock was still holding his arm. It was dropped immediately.
It had been about a minute since Mary had stopped giving him head and Sherlock hadn't noticed, he was so wrapped up in his own thoughts. He sat up and opened his eyes to the most wonderful sight. Mary had moved to be on her hands and knees beside Sherlock; John was smoothing his hands down her thighs and dipping his tongue into her arse. Mary had a content expression on her face and John- Sherlock nearly came right there to see what John looked like doing that.
John looked hurt. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I guess so, but. I thought we were about to? Y’know. ‘Establish a pattern of contact’.” He gave a weak smile.
The beginning of his life was ironically around the time when he was fresh from the greatest threat of death he had experienced. He still had the scar in his old age, but the ridges of raised skin on his shoulder were not as prevalent anymore. The start of his life had nothing to do with his physical being. It had everything to do with Sherlock Holmes.
The air that would have forged the words to break his heart left John’s lungs as a harmless sigh. At a loss, John looked at their clothes, rumpled on the ground. Hands on his hips, he said, “Things between us have changed, haven’t they?”
She straightened up and kissed his cheek. It was light, meant to break the tension. Sherlock could see why John liked her so much. She was as considerate as John was loyal.
The laptop on the table beeped with a notification of Mary’s call. They hurriedly put their toys aside and shifted closer together to be in the frame of the shot. John fiddled around with the settings until Mary appeared on the screen.
As soon as he could speak again, John was apologizing. “I meant to pull out before...” he coughed awkwardly, “that happened. Should have been using a condom. I’m a goddamn doctor and I-”
Mary took hold of the waistband in her teeth and tugged the material down to mid thigh. Her hands brought the pants down the rest of the way for John to step out of them.
At halftime, Molly and George offered to hold their spots while Sherlock and the other two went down to the concession stand. Sherlock couldn’t care less about popcorn or hot chocolate, but it was an excuse to get closer to the field.
Class was agony today. Sherlock ruffled his hair in frustration and flipped to yet another page of his sketchbook to start over. The assignments of the last month had been effortless, the ideas spouting from Sherlock’s mind to the paper as fast as he could put them there. Today was the end of that, it seemed. Sherlock had met yet another nemesis.
"Ready?" Mary whispered. Sherlock nodded and there was a soft grunt of agreement from above. "Alright," she said and began to move.
Also, the reason I'm revisiting this story is completely based on my contempt with season 4. I'm a petty bitch okay
“It was worse than that, mate,” said Will. “John chatted her up for weeks before Prom. She was certain he was going to ask her, right, so she turns down all these other blokes. At the last minute, he ends up asking her sister!”
“I was testing the rate of human decomposition in different humidities,” said Sherlock. Like a cue in a play, John rubbed gingerly around his entrance with slick fingers and Mary grinned with excitement.
Sherlock quickly busied himself with retrieving his pencil. When he deemed it acceptable to return his gaze to John, the model had resumed to his original position. Sherlock thought he was safe until John stretched his arms above his head, his skin moving easily under the drawing light. Homeostasis was suddenly much too hot.
Sherlock pushed his chair back from the table where he had been pouring over the list and opened his trousers. He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. It wasn’t right to get off to thoughts of his best friend’s fingers or wondering what noises he’d make when being sucked off. Sherlock bit his lip and palmed himself through his pants.
Before he could process the change, Mary was on her feet again, confident and determined, kissing Sherlock within an inch of his life. It had been some time since anyone had done that, and Sherlock was in such a stupor that it was easy to tip him backwards onto the bed. The rush of arousal was not unwelcome.
The focus of the photo was a girl; short hair, nice clothes. She leaned on the rail of a bridge overlooking a shallow stream. John recognized it from a park not far outside of London. It was much cleaner in the picture than it was now, all made more picturesque by the girl's genuine smile.
"Don't be shy, dear," Mary pulled off, the increased motions of her hand making up for the loss of contact with her mouth. "Play with him a little. The way I like."
"Yes," Sherlock said quickly. That meant they would be facing each other. With any luck he would be able to see John's face when he came.
John pushed the dildo in and out while fisting Sherlock at a startling rate. Sherlock was overcome with shocks of pleasure that mounted faster than he could process. He was vaguely aware of a low moan being coaxed out of him, the sound choppy from the rhythm being pumped through him. John was murmuring little encouragements to him and all at once, everything burst with vivid color.
"Were you saying something, Sherlock?" John from the present tense entered the sitting room. There was a pause as Sherlock processed the dual source of John's voice.
Sherlock turned to John and tilted his neck up slightly. John took a quick breath but otherwise remained still. The first kiss was a light pressure to where is jaw met his neck just below his ear. Sherlock made sure to inhale and exhale deeply before he drew away. He knew his assumptions were correct when he felt John shiver and sigh.
90% of this was written in 2014. Since then, my attitude about sex has changed and so has my writing. Hopefully the transition across time wasn't too jarring.
Sherlock scrubbed his hands over his face and stared up at his bedroom ceiling. He was better than this, wasn’t he? Focusing on school, on facts, had always been easy. Not always entertaining, but never as frustrating and confusing as whatever was taking up all his brain space now.
"Ah." John's voice registered in Sherlock's mind, heated and strained. "Do what you normally do, when it's me."
“For this arrangement to continue, we have to,” Sherlock insisted. He would not be responsible for the devolution of the Watson marriage. He would not let the whims of his heart get the better of him. He knew better.
Hope you the best in the future, dearie. John wouldn't tell me much, but as I understand it, you don't visit much anymore. You'd be as old as me by then, and I can put two and two together.
“It’ll be Wednesday or Thursday,” John continued. “We can do it at my flat or yours, whatever you’re comfortable with. If you’re interested, that is.”
Sensation was building too quickly. Sherlock knew their evening would be short lived if the focus remained on himself. This was suppose to be about Mary.
“It’s like trying to make a flat map of a spherical Earth. You have to cheat a little, pick and choose, however you want to say it. The point is, you have to find a quality in that person that make them who they are. Once you find it, you find a way to draw it.”
“John, I’m going to let you fuck his mouth,” Mary said, then paused and waited for John to stop his whispered swearing. “You will look at me the whole time. With any luck we’ll come together. Now, I want you to push into him slowly.”
To further distract himself Sherlock typed out any changes he’d made to the list of limits. He put on a mindset that broke the words down into letters instead of meaning or images. With this method he could complete his task without further incident. With a satisfying tap of the enter key he sent the final version to Mary.
"John," Sherlock said again. "He's just gone to Mrs. Hudson's flat. It's fine." He gave John an incredulous look, like he should at least be able to count the footsteps on the stairs to see if their time traveling guest really was gone.
“Then it’d be a shame not to,” Mary decided. “Sherlock, lay down on your back with your hands above your head, that’s it. John, tie his wrists and use the headboard if you need to.”
"There's something I'd like to give her," John explained. "It's very specific and you're the only one I'd trust enough to even consider-"
"It's open," Sharlock stated. "And you were attempting to use the wrong set of keys anyway. Those are for the flat. Are you sure you aren't going senile?"
Seeing John in the flat again had two warring effects on Sherlock. The first was a pleasant hum in the back of his skull; every color was brighter and every line crisper when John entered. The second was a twinge of bitter reminiscence that he sought to squelch immediately. With both feelings held a comfortable distance at bay, he stood and waited for John to finish his pleasantries and address the subject he had made the journey for.
Jawn chuckled and waited until Sherlock was ready. At the last moment, he reached for John's chin and pulled him into a kiss. A choking sound came from Sherlock's direction, followed by many shutter clicks. John blanched and struggled, but Jawn kept him in place with a hand on the back of his neck. When the aura of Sherlock's amusement faded into annoyance, Jawn gave a final nip to his lower lip, just the way his husband often kissed him, and drew back. John looked absolutely horrified.
“John, look at me,” Mary said, her tone leaving no room to question. “You’re being ravished. Who’s doing that? Tell me, John.”
John did as she asked. Sherlock straightened his posture and felt a thrill somewhere in his ribcage. He had an idea of where this was going.
“Thank you dear,” Mary said to John. “Let’s not waste much time with the clothes today, I’m already knackered from traveling. I’d be asleep if I wasn’t so excited!”
Sherlock tongued at the slit and varied the amount of suction by hollowing his cheeks. He bent to take more of John in. It was at first startling and later amazing to feel him grow firmer in his mouth. Sherlock felt a rush of pride; John was at full hardness again.
“See you ‘round, biggest fan,” Michael added. The two jogged back to join the huddle that was forming.
“Oh,” John chuckled. “A pun.” They both managed to bite back their laughter for an impressive six seconds.
The call came on an ordinary Thursday evening. If it was anyone else, Sherlock wouldn't have answered.
Mary was speaking, but Sherlock didn’t register more than that she was breathing audibly. John’s noises broke through more clearly. Stifled grunts made way for louder groans. Mary urged him on until they were both panting. One of John’s hands drifted up Sherlock’s neck and twined once again in his hair. The fingers tugged lightly, giving Sherlock chills. He moaned around John’s length, loving how the vibrations made him swear and dig his nails into Sherlock’s shoulder.
John slowed his movements, seemingly in shock. Mary was silent. The whole room was frozen on the edge of a knife and Sherlock was too wrecked to know or care if he’d ruined everything.
I've fallen out of love with BBC Sherlock. The reason this chapter exists (after forgetting about the story for three years) is that a handful of people left really kind comments. Thank you!
"Exactly," Jawn continued. "Knowing you, and I know you quite well, the best girlfriends were the ones that didn't insist on dragging the night on. Concise. Lounging around in mutual company is more of your style, isn't it?"
"I," Sherlock started by looking at John, but corrected his posture to address Mary. "He's set the bar rather high, but I intend to."
The tension left John’s body. He looked up at the ceiling and exhaled a long breath. “Good,” he said. “That’s good.”
The clack of the lube being opening was obscenely loud in the breath of silence that followed. John covered his fingers but didn’t touch him. Sherlock gulped down air, realizing that both John and Mary were waiting for him to begin.
