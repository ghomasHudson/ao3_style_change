Tony sighs, bringing Steve a little closer to his face. “What are we going to do with you, huh?”
Natasha did it so swiftly and silently that it took Tony a second to figure out what was going on. She held him very lightly, yet not in such a way that gave the impression she was shying away from contact him.
“I’ve had enough. My bodyguard has already called the cops, I suggest you get out of here before they show.”
Tony already knew who he wanted. Plenty of people were looking at Tony, but none of them were quite as eye catching as this man. In the dim light, his hair was spun gold. He hunched over his drink, as if to draw attention away from his tall, muscular frame and watched Tony. It was too dark to tell exactly what color his eyes were, Tony thought maybe green or blue, but they shone with interest. He smiled when Tony met his gaze – a little sheepish, a little flirtatious.

Tony glanced up from his phone at the man beside him, it was that weird one that could grow and shrink. Ant buddy? Giant dude? Giant ant pal? He was still hanging around with Steve? Tony thought he’d crawled back to where ever he came from. What was he even talking about?
Steve blushed fiercely. "Tony!"
Tony’s grip on Steve’s hand was tight, a lesser man might have found it painful. This was serious, whatever Tony’s issues with water were and Steve was probably making it worse by getting Tony wet. He scooched away, so he wouldn’t drip on Tony anymore.
“Who’s on watering duty?” Steve looked around the common room from where he was crouched next to the planter. Col. Rhodes chose a nice sunny spot for it, close to where everyone gathered to watch movies.
"This was supposed to be a quick reconnaissance mission! It shouldn't have taken more than three--oh no!"
"Because in bed, I'm a sexy beast and you're as sweet as apple pie?"
Tony swallows the last of his food and says, “Looks like we’ve got trouble. I guess we’ll have to find some other time for our little chat.”
Bruce frowned and fiddled with his glasses. “Imagine if it was something that no one had ever seen before, we’d have no idea if he was even a real creature, not to mention what kind of diet and behavior to expect. As it is, we are only running on the theories of paleobiologists.”
“Okay,” Tony replied dazedly and he was rewarded with another one of those smiles.
Tony laughed. “Is that supposed to be a deterrent?”
“You should have called someone if it was this bad.”
“The Captain has my full attention,” Thor objected, midway through a yawn.
"Would I get you anything else?"
“I’m cutting you off after this one, Tony. You know it isn’t good for you.”
I wrote this one for
“To make sure someone is with me.” Tony whined, “But you were busy! And Dad will be home tomorrow!”

“I’m afraid not, Captain. Though mayhap I know a way to find out.”
"But, not now?"
“There was something Witchfire said before we handed her over,” Steve said, ripping off his glove and reaching over to where Tony was sitting. “I have an idea of what might help.”
"Friday, any updates on the outlaw formerly known as Captain America?" Tony said, replacing the bottle cap.
#9 Nick Fury
“Steve?”
#4 Thor
“The Cloak is a priceless artifact and a valuable ally. I refuse to harm it.”
“Who knew the good doctor was such a slippery bastard?” Tony grumbled as he stepped out of the armor. He looked exhausted, slumping over.
Tony looked up and down Steve's body. The tight white shirt wasn't an uncommon sight on Steve, but the blue suspenders and red flame-retardant pants were. The matching red jacket with white and blue stripes slung over Steve's shoulder completed the patriotic firefighter look.
"What's up honey muffin? Feeling the love today or something?"
“Do you have any idea how to fix it?” Steve asked, tearing his eyes from the plant to look over at Thor. “Loki’s your brother; you must know something about magic.”
“So you don’t know.”
"Or maybe they want to see you with a super rich and handsome sugar daddy," Tony purred.
Tony knew what happened to kids that weren’t normal. So, he put it aside, made sure to only look at mirrors straight on, and didn’t think about it (mostly) for about thirty years.
Steve let go of the car door.
“I haven’t seen him either, but that’s not a surprise.” Bruce said as he investigated the remaining mug of coffee with dull eyes. Steve wondered if he’d gotten any sleep. “He’s been really busy with his latest projects. The R&D have been sending him a ton of projects for review.”
Hug #12
Execrating himself from his teammates’ warm greetings as politely as he could, Bruce strode over to Tony and got a brittle smile in return. Tony’s sunglasses prevented Bruce from seeing the hurt in his eyes, but the fact he was wearing them was more than evidence enough it was there.
He stared at it, like he was looking at the barrel of a gun, but didn't take a drink. A rush of air escaped from his lips.
Suddenly a woman shouted, “Mr. Stark!”
"Can I at least put the jacket on? I feel silly just holding it."
Tony balked a little when Pepper started marching toward him, her mouth forming a frown and her hands clenching into fists. That was never an expression he wanted to see on her face.
“When we met, this is the last place I expected we would end up,” Steve murmured.
No one honestly seemed to notice was the thing that really threw Steve for a loop. A generic tablet computer suddenly weighing three times lighter and spitting out holograms was disconcerting enough, but the person next to you not even seeing a difference was worrying. Steve’s careful questions about the matter never seemed to result in any answers and since he was rarely around any tech old enough to receive instantaneous and unexplained upgrades, he was content to let it remain a mystery for a while longer.
“Oh, well, you have very nice biceps, very manly and good …for hugs.”
Hug #2
“We know why it crashed, the Hammer drone that snuck on board exploded. We should definitely look into how it got there later, but right now you should stop avoiding the question.”
“Please, don’t be mad at her!” Tony rushes to placate her by covering her hands with his. “I asked her not to write to you about it. I thought...Well. An assault was enough of bad news, if I said I welcomed a stranger to heal his wounds even for a short time, you and father would be so angry. You would have cancelled your trip...”
Right now, he rarely had the spare time to spend an entire afternoon on drawing. Even when the yellow-green spring grass and early flowers beckoned to him as he sat working on his accounts for his small estate. Even in retirement, Steve had paperwork to do and business to conduct and soon he would have visitors to his estate now that the renovations were complete.
“Sam and Bucky have an errand to the capital --”
His mother’s joyful voice coming from the house breaks Tony’s reverie. The weather is warm, the sun high in the sky, so the three Starks have decided to eat their breakfast and enjoy it under the refreshing shadows of trees in the garden. Teacups filled with hot teas and coffees stand in front of each one of them. If Tony’s eyes bulge at the news, his father doesn’t look stunned by them. He eats in short mouthfuls the rolls served by Ana while reading some new book about research in naval engineering Tony would try to take later from his library.
“Eh, I can live with that. Being human isn’t the worst thing. Besides, this is a much better way to touch your chest, instead of flying into it.”
Bucky and Sam had returned from their business in the capital with the jewelry Steve had ordered. Whatever business they had was resolved well and completely, leaving them free to stay until mid-fall. Steve was glad of the news, but wished he knew if Tony would be staying longer too.
"Well, yes. We must. It displeases me as much as you, but we cannot avoid to speak about that subject any longer." He lowers his newspapers to pointedly stare at his son. "He heard you haven't married yet and sent me a letter complimenting our house, and how much he would
"What? Your nieces in Milan?" He laughs unkindly. "They're children! They may love him now, but believe me, once they get married, it will change. Their future husbands may not like him nor want to be charitable towards him."
He’d been hard at work sabotaging the mill works. A determined fairy could make a lot of mischief and do a lot of damage. He’d needed more supplies and that’s how he ran into Steve.
When the car did pull up at 4:07pm - seven minutes before Stark predicted, Steve noted grumpily - the man called out to his son the moment he got out of the car. “Petey pie! I’m so sorry, DUM-E didn’t want to get back on the plane, but then I told him it was for you and he moved a little faster.”
“Captain -- I did not realize the Navy accepted omegas these days. A shame, really -- but maybe that’s the only option for an omega of your size? I have something on offer that might interest you more than a mill.”
Tony’s eyes slid back to his pile of paper. Steve packed up his pencils. He learned to not ask questions he didn’t want the answers to. Tony was passionate about saving his forest and with his wings noticeably better, it wouldn’t be long before he left.
“Really? I would have thought you would have been in competition with the mill owner to the south.”
A big thank you to all the people who leave comments, kudos and bookmarks <3 It really touches me <3
“I would need to insist on planning how to power the mill if I were to invest, Mr. Rumlow,” Steve said.
Steve was willing to put up with the inconvenience of not using his dressing room for a short time. Tony would be protected in the room from stray animals and he asked the maids to leave the room alone for a while.
“Oh, yes! He had no sense of propriety. What was his name?”
Steve has a painful expression on his face and Tony resents himself for having made him feel that way. Something in him, raw and powerful, compels him to finally be clearer with Steve, more honest, to reach him. The rational part of Tony's brain knows it’s the neuronal and hormonal imprint of his soulmark which gives him this urge to communicate to the small blond. He feels it’s the right time to listen to it, after months of frustration and useless pining. His sincerity has allowed him to have this special moment with Steve, and Tony wants to experience more beautiful occasions like these in the future. Of course, the blond may not share his mark, perhaps this sudden inspiration is misleading him completely, and his deep attraction is one-sided. But right now, Tony is not scared of being ashamed or rejected. He’s tired of fighting against his feelings. He closes his eyes to channel more energy for the perilous dive he's about to make.
“I know, I know. This wasn’t how I wanted things to go.”
“You’re the one chasing after another man”
“I’m so sorry” I said
I threw a pillow at her and she caught it before she sat down in the saucer chair.
At the end of the day there had been no sign of him or Thor. When our group got together outside of the school I asked if anyone had seen them. MJ was as lost and disappointed as I was. Peter shook his head.
“We love you both very much. Peter, I don’t consider you anything other than my son, you know that” Dad continued, kneeling down and placing a hand on Peter’s knee
“I hope we don’t take the subway. Not in this dress”
“No” he said
“You must be Eleanor”  He grinned
MJ had insisted on coming over after school so she could watch the Dads versus Boyfriend showdown and I obligied in hopes that her being there wouldn’t cause Dad to be over the top with Loki. Peter came through the door moments later and didn’t speak to us as he pushed by and made his way up the stairs, the hood of his jacket pulled over his head.
“Go away Peter” I grumbled, turning over and pulling the blanket over my head
“Yes, I am” I said as my shoulders stiffened
Pepper and I talked a while longer and I eventually decided that I was going to try to talk to the guy. What would it hurt?
“Do you love him?” I asked curiously
“I’m sorry things are the way they are, kids” Tony said as we sat at the table, digging into our food
Steve topped it off with more coffee. “How is your head? Wing? You took a big blow.”
As a result, Tony feels restless, and shameful too.
He tucked a lock of hair behind his ear. He’d also indulged in an exceedingly fine muslin dress,  embroidered all over with small silver flowers and sparkling spangles, and a light blue shawl. Tony might not be able to keep his hands off Steve when they were alone.
“You could always buy the mill if the sabotage doesn’t work,” Steve suggested.
“Yeah, Peter. Your dad said something funny.”
Steve blinked a few times and tried to marry that comment to the public portfolio of Stark Industries and found it… difficult.
Natasha and Bucky had no trouble telling Tony lots of embarrassing stories about Steve growing up and in the Navy to much laughter all around. Tony had his share of stories about his friends, particularly Rhodey.
“Sorry, Mr. Rogers,” Tony emphasized. “I have the school email, do you have a personal one?”
Steve did feel a lot of guilt that Tony was in the predicament he was in. His good manners, his sincere desire to see a fellow creature thrive, and his general excellent temper prompted Steve to keep checking in on Tony and to make sure that he was comfortable and healing.
“Steve, you haven’t worn pants since you moved here.”
make a strong impression during the Van Dyne’s ball. I think we didn’t receive that many letters two years ago when he came out for his first dinner party in London!”
“That was reckless of you, Antonio, very reckless. Why did you take that risk?” His mother stares at him judgmentally. Her tone is calmer than before but still icy.
Steve had given up on that idea years ago when he set out to sea and had to suppress any sign of being an omega. The option of family and children had evaporated back then. He’d met his neighbors and hope remained dead.
"I know Brock is the worst choice, he can be a real asshole sometimes. Having sex with him is not something I'm proud of," he mumbles.
Five-year-old logic really was a thing of beauty.
~~~~~
“You said the same thing two weeks ago, sir.” Jarvis interrupts gently. “The poor Lady must think you're indifferent towards her. It is not a good thing for your feelings to be misunderstood by someone you wish to marry. Another Omega may come into the picture.”
“And now you’re playing,” Steve said and Peter gave out a ‘whoop’ before jumping back into the pool
Stark was the son of the son of the son of who founded the town and he carried himself like that mattered more than anything else. He owned the land the academy sat on, and a whole heap of other things, so the minute it was announced that Peter was born, the entire staff knew they’d be teaching him some day. They all assumed, however, that they’d be getting a spoiled brat - since Tony’s reputation at Allensville when he was a child still endured.
“I could wear the uniform --” His formal, more formal, and seriously formal naval uniforms were packed away in storage. “Or have a formal coat and pants made.”
And, he realized, thinking about him as Tony for the first time as well. He’d had Peter in his class for eight months and had always thought of his father as ‘Stark’.
~~~~~
Natasha snickered. “And leave Steve and me all alone?”
“Steve --” Tony said, then stopped.
“It’s craft time,” he called and was answered by sounds of celebration. “Can everyone go get their smocks from their cubbies, please?”
“Whoever that berk who will wear this is, they’re very lucky.” An Omega says in the back of the room, breaking that floating moment they were all absorbed in.
Making plans
“Me too, ‘mega. Me too.”
“Injured fairy,” Steve replied. He’d found linen napkins in the sideboard in the dining room. He hoped that they were soft enough -- he’d bought them new a few months ago.
Steve shot Sam a look. Sam could hold his own in any fight, and he was already maneuvering his way between Steve and Rumlow.
“He’s part spider, I swear,” Steve muttered to his boyfriend of two years, who was completely engrossed in his phone. “Tony?”
The tiny man looked incredibly indignant and glared at Steve. He tried to flap his wings, but one wing didn’t work as well as its partner.
Tony opened the door to the carriage. “How bad is it?”
To what extent does he crave it, how deeply this need is rooted: Tony is not sure. It’s one thing to recognize you want to be closer to another Omega. It’s another to live with this new information and to decide what to do with it. That’s why he needs to define, as clearly as possible, what happened in the library so he could plan what’s ahead of him. First, he has to run through the many potential answers this problematic situation entails, whether he likes them or not. Tony channels his energy inwards, his thoughts like roads displayed on an imaginary map.
The prospect of inviting his friend lifts his spirits, a new surge of energy ripples inside his body. Tony puts his feet on the floor, moving his covers aside, ready to finally stand up off his bed. He stops when he takes a look at his bedside table. His mother’s favourite tea service is standing proudly on it, with its striking painted roses arranged in small bouquets, intertwined with golden leaves. A full teacup has been waiting patiently for him this whole time. He contemplates it with curiosity. Tony is not as interested in art as his mother. Far from it. He fails to understand exactly how the rules work when it comes to style, pleasing aesthetics, tasteful decorations or what is the best way to match plates and cutlery together in the dining room, though he tries to fake it as best as he can during social gatherings because that’s what was expected of him. Yet, even though he can’t relate deeply to his mother’s preferences, he always pays attention to what she enjoys the most, and he noticed she had used this service when she was alone or when she received close friends at home. It means she must be the one who prepared this.
Never in his life has Tony felt a single misplaced word could sentence him so badly his mother would have a completely different opinion of him. He massages his breastbone in the hope to appease his breathing; his ribs constricting under the pressure of two imaginary strong hands compressing them on each side.
“I can get him back home if you don’t mind going back alone in the carriage.”
“I think he’ll love it, Peter,” Steve said with confidence and Peter beamed.
“Hey. I wonder - Do, do you-” Steve’s deep voice stammers, matching the storm in his blue eyes. Tony is stunned by how bright they are.
Even though he had been there to hear what Steve was planning, Tony had not anticipated how resplendently beautiful Steve would be in the candlelight of the ball.
He hated all this right down to every particle of his body. But he owed something to Tony, even if Tony didn’t love him enough to stay.
Jarvis sighs sadly.
“You’re unbelievable. I told you to come clean right after work, but you came to her first!” Steve throws a pillow at his friend’s face, meeting its target squarely on the nose.
And they could rest after this passionate mating UwU they deserve a good night and the softest dreams <3
“Yes, of course,” Bucky squints his eyes at him. “But, who knows?” He shrugs with a large teasing smile. “Someone could die, it would be very convenient. Be a replacement and all. Their manor is the perfect place to live in.”
“Peter?” Tony called, his voice clogged with tears. “Can you come here, quick, please? We have some important news.”
“He must have done quite an impression on you if the memory of this Omega is stronger than what this Alpha did to you,” she murmurs. “Don’t you think?”
, he claimed,
“My baby graduated from kindergarten, Steven. I’m allowed to be emotional.”
“It’s nothing very conclusive, however, I’m afraid,” Tony says, his hands ruffling through his hair. He sighs dramatically. “Most of them are unfinished works. Dealing with ships is a much more complicated affair than designing rifles.”
“Bye, Peter!” Steve called back. He reached for his phone as soon as the pair were in Stark’s car.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve felt the blush creeping up his face. He knew he was a good teacher, but it was always special to hear it from others. “Thanks, Matt. I do my best.”
But there was the… weirdness of asking out his son’s teacher. Peter’s last day of kindergarten was June 11. Tony checked his phone - May 15. Surely he could make it another month?
-Two men having sex together <3
He frowns.
“You got the votes?”
Steve walked through the nearly empty drawing and parlor rooms with Sam and Natasha. The furniture had been carefully stored away and servants were hanging decorations and arranging the borrowed chairs strategically around the room. Food destined for the refreshment tables was stowed away in the kitchen and pantries along with more candles than Steve had ever seen in his life. His housekeeper was very proud of her preparations and Steve had already set aside significant bonuses for his staff after the ball.
“Well, in that case-”
“And still, your father has taken your schematics from last week with him and presented it to Lord Stane. I’d say he hadn’t seen such an amazing idea coming from someone so young for a long time, sir!” Jarvis adds, his eyes twinkling with joy. “Rumours are spreading about the king himself. He had shown interest in meeting you and your father.”
“I don’t know about fairies,” Natasha said.
“Won’t be as fancy as the parties in the capitol,” Bucky added.
Matt inhaled deeply and Steve felt like he could hear the grimace.
And finally, there is a time when Mr Rogers doesn’t come anymore. Someone new replaced him, more efficient, with no ailments to slow him down. Mr Barnes follows him a few days later. Jarvis cannot tell if it’s a good thing or not, but he notices his master has been much more proactive in his hobbies since the news reached him.
"Even if Tony finds no husband or spouse, my family will always welcome him." She twists her hands on her lap, dignified and resolute.
At least the constant planning for the ball reminded Tony to not become too comfortable here. Besides, he was essentially living in Steve’s closet. It was a nice sized room with chairs, a table, a small bookshelf, a dressing table, and Steve’s current wardrobe. So a closet in effect.
Steve felt his face blush. “Well, that’s wonderful, Peter. Who’s your first favorite?”
Then Rumlow hissed low and dangerous at Sam. In a handful of minutes, Steve was not going to be at his best, and they were not going to be in a good position to defend against an alpha going into rut.
Tony was suddenly anxious that Steve’s dance card would be filled already for the evening. He was the host, the most gorgeous omega in the room; all eyes had to be drawn to Steve, who was all smiles, glowing and sweet scenting.
“I’m attracted to you even if you look like you always want to punch me-”
I thought the package looked nice UwU <3
The human set down a plate with two pastries cut into pieces and a thimble filled with coffee. “My name is Steve,” he offered.
Confession in the garden
“Is that your way of asking Bucky and me to take a trip into town?”
“And are you still thinking about him?” His mother’s voice tremors at the end of her sentence.
Steve had begun to take tea with Tony in addition to their daily breakfasts. After pressing Tony to take another bit of cookie -- he noticed that Tony never ate nearly enough -- Steve suggested, “You could join us for dinner.”
Peter’s call broke their bubble of joy.
The brunet Alpha slowly turns around to face him, a serious expression on his face. He’s not smiling at all. Steve wets his lips, he stammers.
“Hold on, I’ll get you out,” Steve said as he tried to rescue what had to be a small bird from his clothes.
-Naked people caressing each other
Steve put down his phone and ran his hand over his face. “And so would I.”
Steve had left all the glad-handing and fussy events behind when he retired from the navy. But as much as he loved his home and his freedom, he was lonely. Having dinner with the neighbors would be a good thing. And he needed to do some of the social niceties to have that option.
Tony realizes he should have tried to show his intimate side to Steve from the beginning because he’s more sensitive to that. He remembers Bucky had warned him a few times that the blond disliked showoffs and superficial people. Well, Steve manages just fine to sleep with some specimens like Rumlow, but it's true he hardly paid attention to him, and he never said he liked him as a friend either. If Tony had listened to Bucky, Steve would have been much nicer.
“Hmmm,” Sam said. “Where’s Bucky?”
“Steve, you’re not good at bluffing.”
“Steve, about what happened with Rumlow-”
He could imagine himself in a gown fashioned from the delicate sparkling fabric, shining in the candlelight of the ballroom. He might even be tempted to dance if he was in such finery. The blue satin with gold threads tempted him more. A desire to look the prettiest he’d ever looked hit Steve hard.
“I know,” Steve massages both sides of his face. “I know it’s very hard but-”
His father is always silent when he takes a look at Tony’s sketches. His eyes jump from a drawing to another so fast Tony can almost see the cogs in his mind turning.  His father is not a man of words, but his proud smile and the way he claps one of Tony’s shoulder before returning to his projects are more than enough. Letting Tony rummage in his workshop, turning a blind eye to all the books he takes and reads, tell a lot of how much he wants his Omega son to devour all the knowledge he needs. It's his way to help him in his research, and creation because they both know it’s for a short term. As long as Tony is under his Alpha father’s rule, he's only tolerated to help him and work for him. Yes, it’s unusual for a noble Omega to have these interests. But, as long as he marries and fulfils his role to another Alpha, where’s the harm to let him entertain himself? The young ones need to have their share of fun! Tony heard this from his mother’s friends many times in the past. It amused him, but it irks him now for he’s painfully aware of how his freedom is limited, how no one aside of his close family and a very few business partners takes him seriously.
~~~~~
A tentative knock interrupts his thoughts. Jarvis’ sheepish expression peeks from behind the door.
“Oh, no, we’re married,” Peter said matter-of-factly. “She’s just in charge. Like in Engaland.”
“Yes, please.”
“The crowd needs to be protected from you and Steve seems to have attracted his own company. We’ll be back for refreshments, assuming that Bucky has not spent our house funds.”
The idea that maybe he was dressing the prettiest he could and not for himself alone ran through Steve’s mind. A silly idea really.
“You’ve got a glow,” Natasha said to Steve.
“So, the plan endures for first grade?”
Tony planted himself right next to Steve, briefly touching his arm in a possessive manner. His nostrils flared a bit as he caught Steve’s scent, now stronger than before. “I’ve been securing the deed to this property and the forest beyond -- have you not received the mail from your investors?”
Steve went back to the dining room sideboard and found teapot cozy, near the perfect size to cover over the drawer. When he returned Sam, Bucky and Natasha were gathered around the table looking down at the fairy. “He’s asleep now,” Sam said.
This comic belongs to me, don't repost it elsewhere without my authorization. If you want to check my other works, go check it on @kappamairi on Twitter.
If he didn’t have work, Tony might have been tempted to linger. Steve had a calming presence, not entirely because of his omega nature. He was extraordinarily competent at running his estate. The blossoming gardens were enticing, the food tasty and plentiful, and the company fascinating and intelligent. Steve and his friends had traveled far and wide across the globe and Tony couldn’t get enough of Steve’s stories. Though he did wish at times that Steve and his friends had noted more about the engineering and inventions they had encountered.
Bucky grimaces, he encircles one of his strong arms around Steve’s shoulders.
Steve was pretty alright for a human, Tony had decided after the first day of being grounded at Steve’s estate. It was easy also to forget at times that Steve was an omega, given his size and bearing.
He sighs in capitulation and waits for the final root to be snipped as he looks at the sky. Once he hears the sound of his mother putting her pruner back on the table, she kisses his cheek tenderly.
“Hi, Mr. Murdock, this is Steve Rogers? Peter’s teacher?”
“It’s the word for a helper who isn’t married to the queen,” Steve explained.
Even better, Steve saw Tony staring open-mouthed as he walked down the grand staircase. Tony’s friend, Rhodey, nudged Tony. “Don’t.”
He turned to Rumlow, whose appearance now turned learing and predatory. The breeze off the river had picked up Steve’s scent that was blooming sweeter.
They would need to leave the nest soon, to get cleaned up and re-enter life as bonded mates. But first, Steve needed to clear something up. “I’m human,” Steve pointed out. “Is that a problem?”
Same warning as previous chapter UwU/ NSFW happens there people!
His biggest problem relies on its velocity; the ship is too heavy and the cost of fabrication too high. Against a lighter and cheaper Dutch fluyt, his ship would fail against its competitors, even if it could bring a bigger cargo and has stronger protection from any enemy. He bites his nails, lost in thought. He could try to mix the two designs, finding an in-between, but that’s the safest and less interesting road, and Tony hates the safest roads for they bring nothing revolutionary on the table. It still unnerves him that no one has still taken any interest to bring these fascinating pumping and steam engines on the table. He found out about them when he had read some letters between Thomas Newcomen and his father, the latter wanting to improve the design of Mr Newcomen's engine, turning it into something less-wasting in energy with a brand new condenser.
“I will not leave this room until you read her letter and answer her. Any choice you make in what you’ll write to her Ladyship is yours and yours only, sir.”
“Hmmm,” Steve said as he put the cozy over the drawer. “I’m going to take him upstairs. It’s too drafty down here.”
“I've never seen you so besotted before, Stevie,” Bucky smirks, throwing a sly glance at the blonde Omega resting on his shoulder.
Clint chuckled. “Hindsight is a bitch. You should have listened to Nat. She usually knows what she’s talking about.”
The spicy scent of Caron's Poivre always reminded Tony of his mother’s hugs. It wasn’t as well-known as Chanel No. 5, another of his mother’s favorites, but it was a common enough in the circles he moved in. He just hadn’t realized how common it was until after she was gone. Men and women alike donned the scent, stirring up vivid memories, so Tony learned to ignore it.
Just as surprised, Steve attempts a turtle shrug and waves his flippers around to express his confusion. He doesn’t want Tony to think he’s doing this on purpose.
“Thanks for visiting,” Clint said, pulling Tony into a hug. “It really meant a lot to us and the kids loved having someone new to play with.”
“Next time then,” Tony said. “You can put on a show for me.”
“Tony, there is something we need to talk about.”
Somehow Tony was turned into a Velociraptor
“Well I need to call you something. How about Fluffy, no, Hazel?”
“I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen,” Tony says with a frown. “Now, let’s see if we can’t make this place a bit more turtle friendly.”
Steve felt the biting cold even through his uniform. He shivered and tried to hold on to Tony despite how the cold seemed to radiate off the armor. Untethered from reality, Steve found it hard to remember why he clung to something so cold while chills wracked his body and his breath came in heavy pants. He was burning from the inside out and so, so cold.
“You owed me a birthday hug,” Bucky said, as he caught Tony’s stunned look and disappeared into the darkness once more.
Tony built a life out on this lake that Steve never had a chance to touch. Or, thinking of that invitation to lunch, maybe Steve did have the chance, he was just too—something to take it. All those years, spent thinking both of them had moved on, when it couldn’t be further from the truth.
“Tony, I’m not – I know you – You used to be afraid of Howard’s flamingo,” Steve babbled, throwing out the first thing that came to mind. Seeing that he was getting a reaction out of Tony, he continued, “You love reading about King Arthur, you hate olives, but love cheese, you sometimes threaten to get rid of Dum-E, but you’d never –”
Steve quickly says, “You don’t need to say anything yet, I just need you to know-”
"Someone will come by to get us soon enough," Steve claimed. "We can just take it easy in the meantime."
Tony lowered his most scathing look at him over the top of his sunglasses. “Look, I don’t know if you’ve realized this, but I—“
After judging that the burn had been under the cold water long enough, Jarvis let Tony remove his hand from the sink and started applying medicine. It undoubtedly stung, but Tony put on his brave face and bore it without complaint, something Jarvis saw more and more as the boy grew.
Nat and Clint nodded to each other, and Clint replied, “You got it, Boss.”
Steve peeked through the door to see if Tony was awake yet, and if he was, whether he was behaving himself. By some miracle, Tony was both awake and staying in bed like he was supposed to. He opened the door the rest of the way and walked through.
"Are you just here to give me an earful? Because if you are, you can go!"
“It’s kind of a relief that he was turned into something that has such a large presence on the fossil record,” Bruce interjected into Clint and Natasha’s unflattering opinions about Tony’s new form.
Steve, as it turns out, doesn’t even wait for that. He dives right out of the quinjet’s open hatch to engage with the enemy. Leaping over giant mushrooms and other pieces of magically altered landscape, Steve begins to draw the magician’s attention. The beams of light start to gain focus, getting too close to Steve as he turtles behind his shield for Tony’s comfort.
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. “You should get some rest.”
“Something on your mind?” Nat asked, swiping one of the coffee mugs from the counter.
Tony considered it. Were they friends? He didn’t think they were before, but he supposed that after the past few days of playing with the kids, eating dinner with the family, and setting up an advanced security system around the farm, things might have changed.
Tony immediately pivots, throwing everything he has at the magician before the worst can happen, but it’s a miscalculation. As soon as the magician goes down, the light balloons outwards in slow motion, engulfing Steve and then collapsing in on itself.
Tony sauntered over, leaving his empty glass behind him. “
Tony yawned and headbutted Steve affectionately. “Are you going to catch it?”
He wandered back to the common room, wondering what it all meant, if anything. He left the coffee on the counter and sunk into the couch.

Tony tried to breathe, he could let the kid see him fall apart because of one little hug. He wanted to brush the whole thing off, like the last time Peter hugged him, but he just couldn't.
Sam crossed his arms. “Always wanted to fight a mad scientist with freaky vampire powers. Where the hell do they find these guys? Is there a convention?”
"I am always better when I'm with you." Tony pressed a soft kiss to Steve's lips.
Steve cleared his throat. “Would you like to –”
The bookstore overflowed with books, with the tall shelves stacked high above even Steve’s head. He roamed the aisles looking for the correct section and found it fairly quickly. He paged through several books with big glossy pictures before settling on a colorful tome titled:
“You’re incorrigible.” Steve shook his head and jogged off to the locker room.
Steve’s heart jumped at the press of Tony’s lips against his. Smiling, he whispered, “You don’t like sappy?”
The cover is brightly colored: the red bit of Chinese architecture, the blue sky peeking out from behind billowing orange clouds, and the green dragon looming large. Steve runs his fingers over the hero and turns the page. Immediately he’s swept up in Tony Stark and the Terror of Fin Fang Foom. The story is too fantastic to be real, but Steve can’t find it in himself to doubt a word of it. Years pass, and the pages get wrinkled and worn, but Steve holds on to Tony Stark and his adventures, remembering the first time he opened that magazine.
"That's what collections do Steve, hang around because I can't get rid of them for some damn reason!" Tony growled. "And I can't stop adding to it because it'd break the old man's heart to see something of yours in someone else's hands, so it just sits there, probably creating a fire hazard in the dusty manor I called a childhood home."
"You were showing off and didn't pay attention to what was behind you."
Steve laid back on the bed and pulled Tony closer so that his head was resting against Steve’s chest. “One good thing about not getting sick is that I can do this.”
“You got a name?” Tony said, smiling back despite himself.

Bandages applied and treatment finished, Jarvis once more scooped Tony up into a hug. He hoped Tony would always remember that Jarvis was there for him.
Lightning fast, two arms, one metal, one flesh, wrapped around Tony, pulling him into a broad chest. Long brown hair smelling of gun oil tickled Tony’s nose and neck, but only for an instant. Bucky let go before Tony could react.
Tony nodded. “Think you can keep up with me, Goldilocks?”
Tony sneezed.
"A thousand people want to see us kiss?"
Clint snorted and started ruffling the feathers on Tony’s tail. “Oh yeah? What theories are out there about veloci-chickens? Is there anything about the evolutionary purpose of gaudy feathers?”

It was hard enough smuggling the battered and soggy box into the car without anyone seeing it, if any of the Avengers, especially Thor, saw he’d rescued some kittens, it’d be all over social media. Maybe when it became time to find them new homes…
"Here's an idea, they see how much I care about you," Steve whispered, wrapping his arms around Tony's waist. "They know I'll take good care of you."
Data on the alarm streams across the HUD and Tony curses. It turns out to be a young man with untrained magical abilities, meaning Sam won the bet about which of THE BIG THREE - aliens, androids or wizards they are facing today. Tony doesn’t mind shelling out the money so much as taking a third consecutive loss.
“Many human beings say that they enjoy the winter, but what they really enjoy is feeling proof against it. For them there is no winter food problem. They have fires and warm clothes. The winter cannot hurt them and therefore increases their sense of cleverness and security. For birds and animals, as for poor men, winter is another matter. Rabbits, like most wild animals, suffer hardship.”
Steve crossed his arms and resisted the urge to push the man, who wore what looked like pajamas and a cape, carefully examining the plant away. Despite the sunlight and the bit of water Steve gave it, the plant looked worryingly droopy.
"They started it." Tony crossed his arms imperiously, though the effect was ruined when he sneezed once more. "Who's buying them again?"
“Excuse me, Mr. Stark!” The woman shouted again, just as she was stopped by a bodyguard. “Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair Magazine. Can I –”
Stark was tired and thin, not to mention reluctant to lean into Fury’s arms, but Fury could understand that. He knew what kind of life Stark had led and it wasn’t one that lent itself to this kind of affection, but that didn’t mean he didn’t need it. Someone besides Fury might have been a better choice to provide it, but these were hard times and Fury could damn well man up and give the boy a hug, as awkward as it was.
Steve paused. “What do you mean, weird?”
“Can’t say I expected you either,” Steve responds, though something about his voice makes Tony’s eyes snap open. Tony searches Steve’s face for some sign of the emotion straining his voice. It almost looked like hope. “But I’m glad. I missed you.”
“I’m naked?” Steve tried, suddenly feeling a little embarrassed about it.
“You got it, Cap,” Clint said. His eyes hadn’t left the TV once.

Looking away from Steve, at the bright orange of the raft, Tony remained silent for a moment.
All that remains is a large crater and a plume of dust covering the field. Steve is gone. All his tracking and biometric data has been cut off--like he’d been wiped from the face of the earth. With a burst of his repulsors, Tony rushes over, looking for some sign that Steve was still there, that he was
Swallowing nervously and probably blushing from head to toe, Steve settled on the couch next to Tony. It was only the unhealthy pallor of Tony’s skin that gave Steve the courage to slide closer so that their skin was touching, which was when Steve noticed the slight logistical problem to his plan. He’d been so flustered that he completely forgot that Tony’s clothes would need to come off too.
“I’ve got a few ideas myself,” Natasha said. “I’m gonna make some calls.”
"I guess I just don't understand why."
“What’s the status on the vet I ordered?”
Hey look, a drabble that is actually exactly 100 words! This one is Marvel Noir!
On Steve’s third lap around the compound, a sleek car pulled up to the main building. Steve kept running as Tony emerged from the car, wearing an equally sleek three-piece suit. Tony whistled at him and Steve he tried to ignore the heat that rose to his cheeks.
The first sign was the way Tony hovered off to the side, while Natasha, Steve, and Clint welcomed Bruce back. He was clearly trying not to seem too invested in the proceedings, but Bruce could tell Tony wanted nothing more than to jump into it with Bruce, whether it was about science or the way Bruce left. Only Tony could wear a mask so well and still be so transparent.

“You won’t learn anything from me, no matter how I suffer.”
After a few minutes and some computer wizardry, Tony said, “Okay, I’ve gotta take this data to the lab and start cracking that encryption.”
It only took until the second test run for Tony to notice the problem.
"You might. You seem to have this preoccupation with eating healthy."
Powdered sugar flew everywhere and chocolate was dripping down Tony's chin. Steve was a little worried he'd choke, at least there were plenty of nurses around. More distracting were the moaning sounds Tony was making. Did he really have to do that?
[There is a disturbance downtown. AIM and Dr. Morbius appear to be in conflict.]
The whine of Tony’s repulsors made Steve look up from the battle. Steve grinned at the sight of that red and gold armor, but his expression slowly morphed into a frown. Steve was far from an expert, but after years of fighting alongside Tony, he liked to think he has developed a good sense for how Tony moved – and something was off.
"I could have maybe planned this better..."
Another one for Lights on Park Ave
"What's up, kid?"
"Hey, how are you doing?"
“No, no suffering on the agenda here.” Tony’s skin crawled at the mere thought. “In case you haven’t noticed, we’re the good guys. We’re not in the business of torturing people.”

That night, after Thor returned with slumped shoulders and a look of defeat, Steve had Col. Rhodes help him transfer the plant to the new pot. Steve could have done it by himself, but he thought it might help.

“That’d be me,” Clint said, raising one hand lazily. “I took care of it.”
eyes, so dark with passion, his firm, yet pliant body, his small gasps whenever Tony did something that pleased him – it all left Tony dizzy.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, kissing him.
“You run out of steam?” Sam panted as he jogged up from behind Steve.
Tony’s grip around Steve’s shell nearly slips as a look of shock forms on his face. “What the hell, Steve?”
While it was true Tony could see someone with him in the mirror, he could never get a good look, the image always slipped away when he focused on it, leaving behind a slight chill to the air. Everything he ever heard about soulmates told him that wasn’t normal. He was pretty sure his soulmate wasn’t supposed to be that big either, Tony was only eight after all. His soulmate should be a kid like him.

Hug #10
“I wouldn't doubt it for a second.”
The streets were slick with ice and slush. Steve walked carefully through them, his hands tucked in his coat pockets, remembering. It was cold in a half-baked way, like winter’s fingers had come to grasp the city, but were held at bay by the billowing clouds of steam rising off of it. Steve wasn’t sure if it had been colder back in his day, or if his body had been less resistant to it, too thin to maintain a warm core with only a shabby coat. Or maybe he knew real cold now, bone-deep and all consuming. He wasn’t sure.
“I look forward to it.”
Tony flew in and landed on the tower platform where Pepper was waiting for him. He kept his pace steady as he walked over, though he wasn’t sure if he wanted to run to meet her or avoid her altogether. How could things ever be the same between them?
“No, you’re not. The spell is killing you.” Steve clenched his fists. The spell had been meant for him, not Tony.
Another Lights on Park Ave submission
“Ugggh,” Tony groaned as he dragged himself from the couch he fell asleep on to the coffee machine.
Fun Fact: What Tony actually said when his mouth was full was "I love you."
"I could be buying them for someone else," Tony lied. He'd been at this insanity for a week now and he wasn't about to give it up.
“It’s a support group: ‘so you experimented on yourself and became a monster.’ We meet on Thursdays,” Bruce joked, not entirely managing to cover up his discomfort. Steve made a note to check in on him later. “I trust I’ll be on standby?”
Steve blinked and blinked again as his eyes were filled with a thousand glittering lights. He twisted around, taking in the fountain and cars, the gleaming white statues and building. This – was not where he had been a moment ago.
“Yeah,” Tony deadpanned with as much distain as he could manage. “Strange, why is your cape trying to turn us into a very large, red burrito?”
"That wasn't what I had in mind, but fine. It can go in the collection."
“It’ll be my honor to make sure you don’t starve to death while discovering previously unknown uses for driftwood and seaweed.”
Steve shakes his head to clear it of that dazzling image, before dashing out of the room to get ready himself.
Steve waited until the nurses had their way with Tony, checking him over and making sure he had something to eat and drink. “Why would you hide this from me? Are you trying to get yourself killed?”
He shook his head and turned into the garage where Tony was waiting. He couldn't deny that the building looked odd, but his new home was already growing on him.
"Just that this is the best crepe ever." Tony lifted up a piece. "Want a bite?"
"...So, remember: Fire Prevention Everyone, Everyday!"
They stumbled off in search of a bit of privacy, hardly able to keep their hands off each other. Steve was intoxicating. His
Thor waited patiently if somewhat bewilderedly for Tony to finish what he was saying.
Then there was the mission he didn’t come back from, not for 70 years at least. Stepping out into that strange and oversaturated future, he’d never been more glad he didn’t have a soulmate. Then he caught sight of it, as a SHIELD agent ushered him into one of their black cars. In the mirror on the car door, there was a glint of red and gold beside Steve.
“Yes,” Tony said, already too impatient to wait for him to finish the question.
Hug #3
Tony had found some food on his forage if his chipmunk cheeks are anything to go by. He looks up when Steve enters the room and visibly brightens, though he can’t smile due to how full his mouth is. He waves his fork in greeting.
JARVIS let him know when Tony had emerged from his workshop and he is currently heading to the common area kitchen to catch him there. Steve is finally, after months of mental avoidance, going to tell Tony how he feels about him. He braces himself before stepping into the kitchen—good or bad, he can’t spend another minute without Tony knowing.
#13 Bucky Barnes
Getting hugs from Thor might have been easy, but asking for them was a whole other bucket of bolts. Unfortunately for Tony he made that discovery a little late, as in right in the middle of talking to Thor.
Tony’s fingers brushed Hazel’s hair.
“What I want is to know what Hydra’s next move is. They wouldn’t have shown themselves if they didn’t have something big planned.” Tony searched Hazel’s impassive face for some sort of clue. “We have other sources we can tap, but I figure, someone like you, who’s been with Hydra for years and has been involved in so many of their plans? Well, you’ve got to know the juicy details.”
And a link to the art that inspired it:
Steve pulled himself over the side of the raft and settled next to Tony, getting him only a little wet. He grabbed Tony’s hand and held it close.
Sam shrugged. “You and Stark were always weird around each other, but I can’t say I saw it going in that direction.”
Kinda sorta related to
"You're still Captain America, you have to look the part."
#7 Scott Lang
#12 Clint Barton
A panicked look crossed the man’s face as he attempted to stutter a response.
Tony mentally stumbled over the reminder that the Cap in the old films he watched so many times in his youth was actually Steve. It was surreal, especially since they were a formative part of his masturbation habits. What Steve didn't know, couldn't ruin their awkwardly budding friendship. It was damn lucky that Steve was as dense as a handsome brick about these sorts of things. He didn't even question why Tony had the time to hang around and watch him pose in a sexy firefighter costume. Tony cleared a very busy schedule just for this PSA.
“Nice to see ya kid,” Tony said, pulling him in with one arm.
Steve fidgeted in his seat and tried not to think of other times Tony might moan like that. His movement must have caught Tony's eye, because the next moment Tony was looking up at him with his cheeks stuffed full.
"It's Gilligan's island."
Hug #8
“It’ll be fine. You’re constantly checking in, like you are
“Can you take this seriously?” Steve growled.
“Thank you,” Tony whispered, finally bringing his arms around to rest on Natasha’s back just as lightly as she had hers.
“You first!” Steve shouted as he charged out, lifting a heavy table and slamming it into two of Doom’s men with enough force to send them flying against the wall.
“I didn’t see this coming either,” Tony replied. “I’m not complaining though, even if we end up spending the rest of our lives on an uncharted island where I have to build everything out of coconuts and bamboo.”
“It will be my pleasure,” Thor declared with a wide grin.
Hug #1
“So you and Stark, huh? I thought Nat was messing with me,” Sam said after a few seconds.
Steve peeled off the top part of his uniform, then after some debate, shucked his pants too, leaving him in only his boxers.
Natasha entered the lounge and Tony looked up. She appeared ready for a mission, fitted into her catsuit. She was probably there to report in before heading out. Preemptively, Tony held a finger up to his lips to silence her; Steve could hear about it later. She took in the scene, her face a marble mask as her eyes flitted over the way Steve cuddled up to Tony, his hand clutching Tony's knee. A second later Natasha simply smiled and left the room with a knowing twinkle in her eye.
Steve wipes his hands against the leg of his pants, absently thinking that if he keeps nervously sweating like this, then he is going to have wet patches on his thighs. That is something he doesn’t want to have to explain.

Once more, Clint wrapped his arms around Tony and a touch hesitantly, Tony returned the gesture. “Come by anytime. We have plenty of chores to help out with,” Clint joked warmly.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Velociraptor_dinoguy2.jpg
When Steve had left, Tony had seemed just a little tired, tried to pass it off as nothing, but Steve knew something had happened in that last battle. Now he shivered limply on the couch with his eyes glazed over.
“Not that kind of moment! Just you know, a manly hug between friends.” Clint shrugged awkwardly.
“It doesn’t matter. You won’t get what you want,” Hazel replied in a rough voice.
“Tony?” Steve’s eyes widened as he turned to look and there Tony was. He smiled.
"I don't see why I have to wear this," Steve said, in a manner that might be considered grumbling if it weren't for the fact he's a national icon. "Wouldn't my regular uniform work?"
As the dust settles, Tony spots something at the bottom of the crater. If it wasn’t so small and misshapen, Tony would think it was Steve’s shield; it has the distinctive star in the center surrounded by concentric circles of red, white, and blue. Tony picks it up and realizes it looks awfully like the shell of a turtle.
Harley leaned in to meet him, bringing his arms around Tony’s shoulders. It was as awkward and tentative as Tony’s own hugs, but warm nonetheless. Tony was damn glad he had his sunglasses on, he shouldn’t embarrass himself in front of the kid like this.
#5 Harley Keener
For the one word prompt: Soldier
“Come on, you can’t tell me you haven’t noticed how he looks at you. You’re in the room and it’s like no one else is there. And don’t think I haven’t noticed you watching him right back. I thought it was a rivalry thing, but now...”
Steve placed his hand over Tony’s, spreading his palm over the clammy skin. “Is this okay?”
Seriously, that was another thing he wanted to complain about. He felt so lied to; the velociraptors in Jurassic Park looked nothing like this. He could kind of deal with the feathers, he felt silly, but at least they were red and goldish. No, the worst thing was the height. He was not even three feet tall and it made him feel like an overgrown chicken, the way the others kept teasing him didn’t help either.
Steve tried not to be self-conscious, Tony had seen him like this before, what with some of the quick changes he had to do before missions, but this felt too much like something else. No matter what he looked like now, Steve was still the skinny kid that one looked twice at unless it was to make fun of him.
“What the hell!?”
The next moment, he was pressed face down on the floor, finding out why touching international assassins without their permission was a really bad idea. Hazel let him up as soon as back up burst through the door, and Tony was hauled off with nothing more than a bruised ego.
“Damn right it is. I can’t let them get any ideas about bringing home strays; the tower will turn into a zoo.”
They stop beneath one of the trees shading the lake’s edge and listen to the birds trilling in the treetops, the wind dancing through the leaves, the water lapping softly at the tree’s roots. It’s peaceful there, idyllic.
“Oh.” Tony breathed, openly staring at Steve.
Tony was damn glad that Natasha had been the one to go up against the Soldier. Tony could admit that without the suit he’d have been toast. As it was Natasha barely subdued him.
Tony yawned. “Go ahead, rub it in.”
"You're the one that wanted to do it out here, Steve!"
(See the end of the chapter for
A nose appears slowly from beneath the carapace, followed by a head and a neck. Four limbs emerge from the sides and search for nonexistent footing. The turtle looks down at his front feet with a quizzical tilt to his head.
“A moment? You’re married!”
Nat gave Steve a good hard look. “Where’s Stark?”
"...and I fixed those problems you reported with the webshooters," Tony rambled. "Gave them increased functionality too. Now you can..."
Tony caught his sleeve and pulled him down for a kiss. “God, you’re so sappy. If we’re gonna do this, you might as well give me a real kiss.”
“He’s also had meetings for those new government contracts, prep work for that congressional hearing last week, and about twenty interviews. The PR department is running him hard,” Nat added. “You didn’t hear about it from him?”
“Steve? Are you with me again?” Steve relaxed, it was Tony. “I made us some shelter. It’s not the fine accommodations I usually provide, but it will have to do.”
for the one word prompt: warm
Tentatively Steve put his arm around Tony, ready to pull away if it didn’t help, but Tony actually relaxed into it and even went a step further by resting his head against Steve’s shoulder. Steve had an urge to see how far he could take this, how much would Tony let him have. He tangled his legs with Tony’s; the sight of his bare skin against Tony’s pants was a little odd, but not unpleasant.
Finally Tony blinked awake enough to realize it was Steve, beautiful Steve, who was making sure Tony was caffeinated for the day. Also he was saying something, in fact Tony had a faint suspicion that Steve had been talking to him this whole time.
How he had tilted his head back, trying to get a good view of where it rose up behind Grand Central. The way it stood out like a sore thumb in the semi-familiar skyline with its strange curves and jutting platform, perfectly exemplifying the future in his mind. Though it had been rather ugly to his eye, he hadn't been able to resist taking up his pen and sketching it.
"Tony, we have satellites that can find us and people who know approximately where we went. We’re not going to be stuck out here. You know this, so what’s really bothering you?”
Much later Tony watched the human go back into the house from in between the long stalks of grass.
It was only later that Tony realized that he kind of wanted another hug from Thor. With Thor’s hugs there was no pressure, sense of obligation, or doubt. He was just a guy that liked hugging his friends.
"Remember how you argued with the make up artist? And broke the armrests on your chair? You intimidate them."
#8 Pepper Potts
“Nice chat!” He said and left to do whatever the heck he was doing before.
“Never mind, buddy. I just remembered all I needed to know.”
He scampered out to grab one before running back to safety to eat it. He finished it and went back out for another, and another, until he decided it was safe enough to just stay there to eat them.
Tony huffed and took shelter in Steve’s lap; he was just the right size if he curled his tail around his feet. Steve picked up the stroking again, this time covering a lot more area. Relaxing into it, Tony started producing a soft chirring noise.
The firefighter costume clutched in his hands, Steve fell into step with Tony, or maybe it was the other way around. "Sounds great."
I wrote this a while back for the Cap-Iron Tiny Reverse Bang
“You didn’t want to,” Tony replied solemnly and shrugged again. “Anyway, I didn’t want to ruin your birthday.”
btw, if anyone wanted to something more with this or just use the concept, well let's just say I won't complain about it.

“We’ll call a Code Green if we need you. Any questions?” Steve looked around at the rest of the table, forcing himself not to linger on Tony. “Suit up!”
“Great!” Tony chirped. “It’s just like the one in the book! I hope it works okay.”
Tony shook his head. “You should go.”

Tony raised his eyebrows at Steve.
“No more coffee, Tony,” Steve repeated softly.
As soon as Tony’s eyes were open and he was lucid, the first words out of Steve’s mouth were, “Oh, thank god. I thought I lost you.”
“Their defenses are focused on the south side.” Steve gestured to the hologram projected over the mugs of lukewarm coffee and the napkins covered in crumbs scattered across the conference table. “So we come in here, just north of –”

But just as he settled in he heard a strange scritch-scratch and froze. Sitting on the steps leading up to the house was a human! His hair shone in the sun as he moved his pencil furiously, eyes dancing between his paper and Tony. As if some sort of spell were cast over him, Tony couldn’t move. His heart pounded.
Steve blushed. “I want it to.”
When Pepper hugged, she was a force of nature. She’d throw her arms around Tony’s shoulders and hold on to him with more strength than logically should be contained within her body. Tony could only conclude that the force of her personality made up the differential.
Tony’s hands froze on Steve’s belt buckle as he listened. Steve had gone tense beside him, not fearful, but alert. The music stopped and ripples of unease went through the club as everyone started looking for exits.
Feeling as if he was approaching the Cave of Caerbannog, Tony stepped inside the cell. The Soldier meekly stayed on the bed while Tony came through the door, only shifting once Tony took a seat. They faced each other, the Soldier twisting towards Tony and Tony leaning over the back of the chair. Silence hung heavy in the air between them as they assessed each other.
Clint’s hand drew back. “Sorry dude.”
Steve held Tony tight, as if bringing him close now could erase the previous distance between them. "Even Captain America can't protect everyone alone, Tony, but maybe we can do it together," Steve whispered. The two stayed like that for a long time, taking shelter from their mistakes in each other's arms.
"Trust me, keeping it off sends the message better."
“Nothing good,” Steve replied, visibly squaring up for a fight.
Tony felt like he was doused in cold water when the Soldier’s expression closed off again. “A weapon needs no name.”
“Your safety is more important than impressing your father.”
He did an excellent job of it. As it turns out, the alcohol can drown out many things, memories, feelings, and even scents. He eventually figured out that maybe that wasn’t the best way to deal with things.
The man nodded. A blush colored his cheeks.
“Perhaps later we shall test it. Though knowing you, it will work brilliantly.” Jarvis smiled down at Tony and ruffled his hair.
“No, say no more. I get it, you feel bad. Well, I forgive you,” Ant fellow interrupted, scooping Tony into a hug.
“The Cloak of Levitation has a mind of its own.”
“Don’t,” Tony pleaded. “Stay next to me.”

Bruce hadn’t quite realized how much Tony cared until he rejoined the team. Bruce had needed the space and didn’t regret doing what he had to to get it, but that didn’t mean he didn’t feel guilty for leaving people behind, especially faced with the evidence of how much they were hurt by it.

Experiencing the world as a turtle leaves Steve a little shell shocked, so to speak. While Tony focuses on getting them home, Steve withdraws back into his shell. Everything just feels a little safer tucked away from the world.
Written for the one word prompt: Protect
“Better. I haven’t really had a chance to practice my Hungarian,” the man replied with a relieved chuckle.
“I figured it’d stir up bad memories.” Tony shrugged and continued walking down the corridor. Surprisingly, or maybe not, Bucky came up and walked alongside Tony.
Tony snorted. He didn't believe that many people besides Steve cared about his welfare, if his personal experiences were anything to go by.
Hug #11
“You just …want to… see me… naked,” Steve managed to croak out.
“Well, they have quite a bit to say about their hunting habits, and judging by the way the retractable claws on his feet are twitching, Tony might just think of you as prey if you don’t stop poking at him.”
. Or not, but he couldn't stop now. "Some of it is on loan to various museums."
Sometimes Tony wondered how he could go so wrong while trying to protect people. First the weapons he made to protect American soldiers were used to harm them and innocent people, then his peacekeeping robot wanted to destroy humanity, and now this, all the compromises he made to protect his team, the people he cared about, Steve, all of it just drove them apart. It just goes to show that Tony was never meant to be a shield, no matter how much he wanted to be.
"Why aren't the stylists telling me this?"
Tony let out a soft grunt of surprise when Rhodey suddenly wrapped his arms around him. It wasn't the first time he'd been hugged, obviously, but the suddenness, how it came unprompted, surprised him. Tony wasn't sure whether to lean into it or pull away.
Before, Tony was happy to accept these hugs; he’d bury his face in her hair and hold her close like he never let himself do with anyone else. Now, he did the same, albeit with much more trepidation, and let the soft tears soak into his shirt.

As the team began to file out, Steve couldn’t resist leaning in to kiss Tony on the cheek. He could do that now. Tony actually liked him! It still felt unreal. Sometimes he had to pinch himself to prove he didn’t just dream up Tony asking him on a date.
Tony sniffled into Jarvis’ finely pressed suit and Jarvis gently rubbed his back, not minding the way the tears and snot soaked into the fabric. One of Tony’s hands was clutched to his chest, but the other was grasping Jarvis with all the strength those tiny fingers had.
“No – Tony! Tony!”
A bird, just discovering this catch of seeds, virtually untouched, came in for a landing beside Tony. Just like that, whatever was holding Tony there was broken and he fled into the tall grass.
"Then you'll do fine." Tony swatted Steve's bicep encouragingly.
[Indeed.]
“Please just let me save your life,” Steve mumbled into the back of Tony’s head, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony’s middle. “Just stay like this until the others get back and tell us the spell is broken.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony nodded, staring at where their skin made contact. Soon enough Tony’s labored breathing eased a bit and Steve’s suspicions were confirmed. He waited, holding Tony’s hand like that, but Tony didn’t get any better.
"mf mffh ffu" Tony said before swallowing.
“And I’m the one that killed your parents,” Bucky stated, his eyes never leaving Tony’s face.
“Hey, no one knew he could fly. The air team should have handled it. This is some crazy shit. All the mistakes of old extremis plus blood sucking. Were they trying to engineer a regenerative formula or just make exploding vampires?” Tony turned so that his head was resting on Steve’s shoulder.
Morbius rose above the crowd, his gaunt, bat-like face twisting into a snarl as he shouted, “I’ve had enough of you zealots! Your imbecilic leader, Tarleton, never really sought a cure, only to sell my mutation to the highest bidder.”
Tony pulled Steve into a hollow in the snow and rested him on some pine boughs, still wrapped in that silvery blanket. The armor popped open, letting Tony out to seal up the entrance around it. Steve thought it was probably warming up, but his confused body was still wracked with chills.
“I’m going to keep you safe,” Tony promised.
🌷🌷🍑🍆🌷🌷
"Who said I don't do hugs?" Tony croaked out, despite all his effort to keep it cool, and he held his arms out in invitation.
Happy didn’t like this, putting his hand on Steve’s arm to pull him away from the car, but Steve would not budge. “Tony, please, I don’t know what’s going on, but I need your help.”
"You're just going to turn around and give them back to me anyway."
“Nah. I’ve got all I could want here.”
Hug #14
“Of course.” Straightening up, Tony snapped his fingers and a thumb drive popped out of a compartment on the armor’s hip. He plugged it in to the computer bank. “What? You don’t think I can keep up?”
On his way back to the tower Steve stopped by the gardening supply store. He grabbed everything he thought he might need, a watering can, gloves, liquid fertilizer, and after a bit of deliberation he added a decent-sized planter and potting soil to his purchases. It was more expensive, but the red and gold glaze reminded him of Tony’s armor.
Steve accepted this, nodding. It must be true. No winter lasted forever, no matter how harsh. He took off running.
“What have I told you about using the soldering iron?”
Soon they’d need wrangling for feeding and bathing, which Tony hadn’t the least idea how to do. He should probably call for back up. “Nix that. I don’t need them knowing about this.”
Steve turned to look at him. “Too bad the one guy who knows is long gone. Sam’s completely lost sight of him. He’s on his way back to help here.”
[It appears to have ‘gotten’ you, Sir,] JARVIS replied. [Shall I call the other Avengers?]
“I’m fine, I just need a sec to recharge,” Tony mumbled into Steve’s uniform.
“Because I wasn’t any good to begin with,” Tony croaked.
Hug#13
"No, it's a sitcom from the sixties, these idiots went on a three-hour tour and were trapped on an uncharted island for years."
Once Bruce would have shook that hand and been happy to be on civil terms, but that wouldn’t be enough, not with Tony, the first person to be a true friend to him after—Anyway, Tony deserved more than a handshake and a hastily taped together friendship.
“I think you need more.”
"Tony, I don't know what that means."
“What’s your name?” he asked
“If you boys need anything please don’t hesitate to call.” Pepper said reassuringly
The next day  I tried to put all of my emotions aside and distract myself with school. I clearly wasn’t doing as good of a job as I thought because after History MJ cornered me.
“There’s a place closer to school, and you, that he likes. It’s a flat, but it’s a large one. Perfect for us.”
“What is going on with you?” she asked, her hands on her hips
Loki shook Dad’s hand
“I’ll be here for the whole thing. I won’t leave you.”
“I don’t want to lose my little girl.”
“He’s mourning, Dear. Give him time”
“What?” Dad asked, startled
“So why weren’t you there?” I asked “Why did you go on the mission?”
“Hello” Loki’s dull tone spoke
“I’ll see you at school tomorrow” I said
“No no no”
I looked at Loki who was just shaking his head.
Another man, another page.
“I wonder what kind of car he has...or are you taking the subway?”
“Nothing.” I shrugged as I stuck an earring through my ear lobe “I don’t know what to say to him”
“No, I’m Eleanor Rogers.” I said
“I’m not sure what started it” Pepper said as she pushed a plate of apple slices and cheese toward us “They’ve been like this nearly all day”
“No” Tony laughed and I smiled at him
“Jesus Christ, Pete” MJ said
I linked arms with MJ and we headed off, following the boys home. When we arrived, we went into the kitchen and Peter began searching the pantry for snacks. He threw a bag of chips and some fruit snacks on the counter and we dug in.
“Right?” I said
“Do you want me to drive you?”
Loki sighed
“Yeah.” Peter said quietly
“Where are you two heading?” Tony asked
“So?” she said as soon as the door was closed
“Thank you for last night.” I said when I pulled away
“You don’t have to worry, Ellie. The organization has been taken care of and I’ll be okay.”
“I know”
“I may not have given you life, but I raised you from the day you were born.” he said with hurt in his voice
“I sang you a song, actually. I Can’t Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli. I got two lines in when I heard Steve shut the water off. I gave you a kiss on your forehead and put you back in the bed and vanished.”
“Barnes?”
“That’s why Tony left, isn’t it?” I asked after putting all of the pieces together “Because you went after him”
My dads helped me look for my shoes and a few minutes later I was kissing them both on the cheek and running out the door.
“We had a nanny, you fired her” Tony finished off his whiskey in one gulp
“We will give you a moment to say your final respects” the nurse said “The doctor will be in soon”
“Why did he take the lake house? There’s plenty of nice places in the city.”
“Here” Dad grabbed my flip flops and handed them to me
“He was scared that things would be different if you know. That you wouldn’t love him and he’d lose you.” Tony put his hands in the pockets of his jeans “That’s why he doesn’t want you dating, he’s afraid to lose you.”
“I think I’m going to go read” I said before I gave him a hug “Thanks”
After dinner Loki offered to help Pepper clean up but she insisted that she was fine. MJ went to help her anyway and Loki joined Tony, Dad and I in the living room.
I nodded.
Frigga left Loki and I alone in the living room. His hands were shoved into the pockets of the black dress pants. There were a few moments of silence before he finally spoke.
I didn’t say anything or even look at my dad as I ate my cereal as quickly as I could. I could tell he was looking at me, wanting any sort of reaction.
“How do you know that?” I looked at him
“Here we go” Clint muttered and Dad shot him a glare
“I’m dead. I’m so dead. Oh my god” I panicked
I looked at Dad’s uniform
“You’re right..” I sighed “I know I’m not being reasonable, but it’s just so weird to believe one thing your whole life and then one day you find out that you were wrong”
“Go?”  I asked
Tony hated to drive anywhere unless he really wanted to, and didn’t really do much of the parenting if he could help it. He was a great dad, don’t get me wrong, but he was the fun dad. My dad, Steve, was always the one to attend the PTO meetings, chaperone field trips, take Peter and I to the doctor, anything that required an adult. Tony would leave the adulting up to his assistant, Pepper, or his driver, Happy. Happy wasn’t always “happy” to take care of us kids, but he did it because he got paid to. Pepper was always thrilled to spend time with us because Tony usually had her running all over the place doing ridiculous errands.
“Are you going to kiss him?”
“Loki, you will have to forgive Steve and Tony. They are just trying to be intimidating” Pepper shook her head “There’s really nothing to be afraid of.”
“Very well.” Loki looked at me “Goodnight, Eleanor. Thank you for inviting me to this...interesting evening.”
“Rain check then?” he asked hopefully
“Of course, Mother.” Loki said as he gave her a hug and kiss goodnight
“Are you alright?” he repeated
“So Loki” Dad said “I hear you are new to the city. How do you like New York?”
“As am I” Loki said softly as he looked into my eyes “I’ve missed you terribly”
“Believe me, I know” Loki rolled his eyes “I’ve been dealing with the same emotions with my own parents.”
I spun on my heel and walked as quickly as I could out the door and down the sidewalk. Loki had just stepped out of a black sedan and was making his way toward me with a smile.
“I don’t think you do.”
“She doesn’t hate me”
“Your dad”
“What do you mean?”
We discussed things more before finally starting on our math homework. Soon after Peter was summoning us for dinner, and after an awkwardly quiet meal, MJ went home.
“You must be Loki” he said
“It’ll work, trust me.”
“Eleanor!”
Dad paused for a moment and sighed, recalling the memory
“I’m fine”
The weekend came and went, and still no call from my dad. Tony and Peter could tell that I was upset so they both tried to cheer me up on Sunday. Tony tried to talk me into going out and doing something, but I didn’t want to. Peter convinced me to play video games with him, but that got old fast. I spent the rest of the day moping around our building until dinner time.
“I know, but it isn’t that far. You can still visit any time you want.”  Steve assured him
“Oh that. It was nothing, we were just talking” I defended myself
“I was going to let the date go. I know it’s time for her to start, but staying out all night? Do you know the possibilities that went through my head?”
Natasha stood up and left my room. I felt my phone buzz inside my clutch so I pulled it out.
“Tony, just listen to me and try to understand” Dad was pleading
“I’m sorry” he said, reaching for my hand again, the other gripping the steering wheel “I didn’t mean to make things difficult”
I knew Tony would be working late into the night like he always did, so after bringing him another glass of whiskey, I made my way back upstairs. I changed into my pajamas, brushed my teeth, and laid down in bed but I couldn’t sleep. Instead I stared at the ceiling and checked my phone every few minutes, hoping my dad would call.  He never did and I eventually drifted off to sleep.
