found the narcotics: a small paper packet of cocaine under the sink in the kitchen, stuck to the bottom of the sink with several pieces of cello tape of nearly the same colour as the sink itself. It would’ve been way too suspicious if they hadn’t found anything at all. When the second meticulous search by another team hadn’t revealed anything, Sherlock had finally been allowed to move back into his flat. Mycroft had been suspicious even then, but he hadn’t said anything, while Sherlock pretended he had in no way been affected by his brother’s disappointment.
Everything had changed, but he went on as before, waiting for John’s visits impatiently, every time. He was supposed to start preparing himself to letting John go, yet he was imbued with an acute fear of abandonment. When one night the Prince was about an hour late, Sherlock was beside himself, trying his best not to let it show and, likely, failing. He couldn’t put his mind to anything, even in the middle of his current experiment. John had promised to visit tonight, but it was an hour and a half after Sherlock’s transformation, and the much wanted guest still hadn’t appeared.
The rest of their hunting trip was moderately successful, but John doubted his contribution was in any way significant, as his thoughts kept coming back to that strange place in the forest, where people lived most of their lives as swans.
Oh, God, what had he done?..
With John, however, everything was better. One of the books the Prince had given him was on the recent history. It described many political events, which wasn’t something Sherlock usually found interesting, but he wanted to be informed, regardless. To his delight, the book described the ‘possible’ murder of a Spanish nobleman, which was something that had caused a lot of speculations, but, eventually, had been laid to rest, sometime after the man’s body had got the same treatment. Illness was proclaimed an official cause of death, but the described symptoms of the supposed illness and the way he had died, told Sherlock what poison had been used, and he had some ideas on where it could have been obtained by the man’s ‘loving and grieving’ son, returned from a journey a couple of months prior to his father’s death, according to the book that mentioned it briefly. There wasn’t enough data, but there were a few more small clues in the text that pointed in the direction of the murdered man’s son. He shared it with John, who lavishly praised him and, together, they wrote a letter with Sherlock’s detailed observations to a man, whom the book described as one of the investigators of that particular murder. From what little information Sherlock had, he’d come to a conclusion that that man was less stupid than his colleagues. Sherlock didn’t outright accuse the nobleman’s son, but he gave detailed instructions on what to look for to confirm his guilt (or disprove, which, in this case, was highly unlikely).
There was also Henry, who was just as terrified of the hounds as Sherlock was when they could just hear the beasts, especially at nights. Henry wasn't very sociable either.
Apparently, the man could see some of the questions on Sherlock’s face.
It was almost a relief when they finally mounted their horses to head back to the castle, where he allowed himself a few hours of sleep. Instead of flying arrows and dying men, he dreamt about the tranquillity of a forest lake.
Everything that happened next was like a hazy dream, and Sherlock was partially certain that it was. He was crawling on the ground, falling forward repeatedly, his own rapid heartbeat and breathing loud in his ears. Everything was different and strange, including the breathing. Moriarty was telling him something, once more joyful and derisive, but Sherlock could barely hear him. Getting away and hiding was all he wanted now. And he kept crawling, even as consciousness was abandoning him.
‘John, where have you been?’ Bill exclaimed upon seeing him.
‘What do you mean?’ Sherlock managed to get out of the water and move behind Mycroft, expecting him to turn around, but the older man didn’t. He kept facing the lake, his eyes distant. Despite the growing feeling of unease, Sherlock couldn't help scrutinising his brother via his swan vision, probably hoping that it would be a small distraction to hush the avalanche of chaotic thoughts and emotions he was failing to keep under control.
‘But why?’ John frowned a bit, genuinely surprised, as if Sherlock was made to be praised and admired and there was no other way. The dark-haired man felt his heart beating faster at that.
And now Mary felt like spending two weeks in Lancashire, where John had rented one of the St Anne’s cosy beach huts for the two of them on her request. Sherlock knew John wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but he couldn’t let Mary go alone now that she was so close to her due date. Mary believed they should have a nice time away before their child arrived, as it was inevitably going to bring more responsibilities and less free time to relax together in the near future. They wouldn’t be able to make at least some arrangements as a couple for a while, becoming a family with a child instead, with their plans or details of those plans changing accordingly. Sherlock would not be surprised if Mary gave birth shortly after their return or even sometime in the end of their trip. That fact hadn’t stopped the trip from happening, though.
Those were just empty, useless dreams, though.
His old stash was rather impressive, full of various drugs and safely hidden under one of the footsteps (the twelfth, to be precise) that led up to John and his.., no, just his now, flat. After what had happened on the plane, everything he’d had left on him had been confiscated. Next, before allowing him back, Mycroft’s men had searched the flat as thoroughly as was humanely possible. Sherlock’s wardrobe, for example, had been taken apart completely and put back together, as he had easily deduced upon coming back to the seemingly untouched place. His bed and many other items in the flat had gone through the same treatment. They must have found many questionable things in the process. And they
‘Your arm? The one that has been broken?’
The ground and the dog were getting farther and farther away, and Sherlock kept struggling and screaming blue murder. He could see Mycroft and Mummy running to him, but they, too, were being left far behind, as the bird was flying away. Very soon, Sherlock could barely see his devastated Mum, her arms outstretched to the sky, as if she was praying for her stolen child to be returned. His heart sank even deeper and he felt like he couldn’t breathe when he could no longer see her. Tears escaped his eyes as he sobbed quietly.
‘Unless your wife sleeps with some of your subordinates’, the redhead said jokingly, casting a glance at Lestrade.
‘Well’, Sherlock prompted the two flock members, once the greetings were over, as always not very good at common courtesy, which everyone in the flock was used to by now. He’d managed to mostly keep the irritation out of his voice, though.
The following evening he finally confessed to his friends that he was soon to get married and ascend the throne. The others could tell he wasn’t very happy about it.
‘Oh, no… ’ John sighed and shook his head half-heartedly. ‘He does that sometimes. And he's trying too hard’, he chuckled.
sorry, Sherlock. You always knew you were bound to lose. You always knew John had made his choice, the right choice. Why do you keep fighting it, even though you know it? Let him live his own life. You’re not even the white swan in this fairy tale. You do understand what it means, don’t you?’ she asked, as if talking to a slow-witted child, softly. Of course, he knew what she meant. It meant that
Other than that, they didn’t interact much. Sherlock could tell that Archie was seemingly coping better than he had been coping almost twenty-five years back. He still wasn’t sure he was good at it. It would've been unfair to think that the boy wasn’t severely affected by what had happened to him. He just suffered through it inside his own mind, in his own way, whilst, on the outside, he was simply trying to survive in these new, unfamiliar circumstances. Sherlock couldn’t deduce much from him, as he had first met him when Archie had already been turned into a cygnet, most evidence of his life before the abduction erased, but he could deduce that the boy was loved by his mother very much. He, obviously, didn’t want any other women to coddle him; he disliked it, and only his mother had been allowed to be motherly and openly show him love, affection and care. That had been hers and hers alone. What Sherlock could tell, without a doubt, was that there hadn’t been any sort of abuse that could’ve made Archie so taciturn. He was just different. And Sherlock knew and understood what it was like to be different. He couldn’t help feeling related.
‘Dealing with you as a child is just boring’, Moriarty finally scoffed. ‘By the way, did you like my present?’ he asked, looking excited now. He was waiting for an answer, but, even if Sherlock wasn’t dumbfounded now, he wouldn’t have known what his abductor was talking about, so he wouldn’t have been able to reply anyway. Moriarty made an impatient gesture with his hand, still expecting an answer, but none was given, so he rolled his eyes, sighed and slapped his hands against his thighs in a gesture of mock surrender. ‘I was generous enough to allow you to spend some time with your family’, the man answered for him, looking mockingly scandalised at the necessity of voicing it. ‘I’ve waited long enough, but it’s time for you to start a life of your own, away from the familial nest, and spread your wings’, the man drawled in a sing-song voice. ‘So… Without further ado…’ Moriarty abruptly lost his playful demeanour, his eyes looked like two abysses, his face cold and dangerous. Sherlock managed to get up and started backing away in panic, but his legs felt as if they were leaden, so it was absolutely pointless.
who was smaller, for some incomprehensible reason. He was very small, indeed, his movements unnatural, his senses all wrong. What was going on?
Sherlock could hear the hound’s frustrated roar and howls, and, judging by the other noises, there were more of them now, attracted by the loud noises and smells of prey and blood. They sounded maddened. Sherlock, however, wasn’t in any state to analyse the situation any further. He kept moving, even though others tried to convince him to stop and have some rest. He couldn’t stop. He knew, if he stopped, he’d not be able to get up any time soon. His broken wing, however, was dragging along the ground, which made things worse. He tried to fold it properly and keep it close to his body, but it hurt so much that he couldn’t. He lost consciousness somewhere on the way and fell.
John started visiting most nights and spent at least two hours out of four hours Sherlock had as a human, sometimes even longer than that. It was never enough. As always, the swan busied himself with conducting experiments, playing the violin and spending time with Archie. Those occupations by no means were tiresome or only resorted to to kill time. And, yet, he missed the Prince. What was more, when John was by his side, the genius, but, at times, chaotic mind seemed to start becoming more organised, his deductions were akin to a well-built carriage with wheels moving down the dry, even road with ease. Sometimes the Prince challenged him, offering to deduce this or that. Even the experiments seemed somewhat more successful in John’s presence. The man was a true inspiration. Sherlock made deductions and John praised and admired him. The younger man was getting used to the unexplainable, regular feeling of déjà vu. He was trying to solve the mystery of why he felt that way. He thought about it, observed, but nothing could explain it. If it was just a mental issue, there was nothing he could do, so it was probably best not to dwell on it too much. It just didn’t make sense that John, being a new person in his life, felt so familiar and special, felt both like the comfort and warmth of a home and the thrill of an adventure. He was like someone from a long-forgotten dream. Sherlock was drawn to him inexorably.
When it was getting dark, they decided to make a fire, to cook and eat some of their game, and rest. After that, they planned to have some sleep and move back to the castle early in the morning, using a different, longer way, so that they could hunt some more on their way back. The servant, who had been looking after their horses and all the things the horses were carrying, managed to find them, as he had been instructed beforehand, and the hunters made beds for themselves, using their belongings they’d taken off the horses’ backs. The grouse and the hare were delicious, Bill’s jokes funny, and, quite pleased with themselves, everyone fell asleep soon enough, including the servants.
‘What is it?’ John asked, looking at him with slight worry.
‘Don’t kill me’, he just said softly. It was likely going to be quite enough to at least reveal the stranger’s intentions. From what he had seen before, the man wasn’t evil, but he was a cold, unwavering killer, at the same time, and it, obviously, went far beyond killing a monstrous attacker. It was intriguing.
everything. With that realisation, another one came like a bolt from the blue: Sherlock’s situation had changed with the appearance of John in his life more than he’d expected, more than he would’ve ever imagined. It just came to him, akin to an instinct, a sudden, secret knowledge, connected to the spell he was under. He was doomed if somebody he fell in love with didn’t feel the same and swore his or her love to someone else. He’d received the secret knowledge of how the spell worked and what was going to happen to him now. He couldn’t believe it wasn’t some sort of a cruel joke. If a person, who had his love, chose him, Sherlock, and swore to love him and share his or her life with him, the spell would be broken and Sherlock would be free to go with that person and would never turn into a swan again, entirely free of the curse. They’d be bound together by that sacred vow and there was no way around it. But, if he or she promised someone else to share their life with, instead, Sherlock would spend the rest of his days in the body of a swan, unable to turn into a human ever again, not even for a few hours. He would soon go feral, gradually, yet rapidly, losing his human intelligence and personality. That was how it worked.
But, all of a sudden, after midnight, they started to change. Just as the night before, the process was really unpleasant, and judging by the pained moans and laboured breathing of the members of the flock nearby, it wasn’t unpleasant for him alone. And, just like the night before, there were soon men and women in fine clothes at the lake. Sherlock sighed in relief, because, him being a human again, meant that no opportunities had been lost, contrary to his previous fears.
The flock now occupied the half-ruined building close by every time they turned into humans, that very building Sherlock, just like some other swans, had explored years back. Sometimes their laughter or someone’s singing reached his ears in the chapel. He also knew that, every now and then, they danced there with some of them clapping their hands to create rhythm, which often went with singing as well. It meant that sometimes they could hear him playing the violin, even though he liked to think he was the only one there, playing solely for his own ears.
His thoughts on the subject of his body were interrupted when, unexpectedly, he saw a massive chest to the right of the altar, something that he hadn’t had a chance to discover earlier. He knew, however, that it wasn’t something that had been there until recently. It was relatively new and clear of dust. It had an ornate lock, but there was a key sticking out of the keyhole. Sherlock approached it tentatively, still struggling with his body. His fingers didn’t cooperate at first, so it took time to turn the key and open the chest. It was full of books and various ornate boxes. What he saw inside the one on the top made his breath hitch in his chest and, for a moment, he was afraid he wouldn’t be able to breathe properly again. He made himself calm down and just looked at the violin inside the box. He had to touch it to make sure it weren’t his eyes deceiving him in this barely-illuminated darkness. But, no, it was real; a violin, not that fucking vielle he’d secretly hated, because it had screamed: ‘Wrong!’, but a very real violin… It felt so right in his hands that he wanted to cry. Could he still play? He wasn’t sure. He’d have to wait till his hands felt like his own again. Sherlock put the instrument back into the box and put the box onto the altar to see what else he could find in the chest. There was a box full of candles and two candleholders. It also contained pieces of flint and steel to produce sparks and ignite fire. Sherlock quickly located a few dried leaves on the altar. He collected them to use them as a tinder. It took him about fifteen minutes to ignite the leaves and light a candle. He would really need time to get used to his hands again, even for the easiest of tasks.
‘Please, just leave’, was a pained whisper from behind the tree. It wasn’t hard to imagine that Sherlock was trying his best to sound firm, and, to a certain extent, he’d succeeded, failing to avoid sounding distraught, at the same time, nonetheless. There was nothing John could say at that. It seemed, he had ruined everything, but couldn’t believe things had deteriorated and gone downhill so suddenly.
Finally, he could see the man better, which had been the plan. Besides, Archie was going to come here soon and Sherlock didn’t want him to stumble upon a stranger in the dark. There were two large stones near the hearth, normally used for sitting, as they were flat at the top (not really comfortable, but beggars couldn’t be choosers). Sherlock invited the man to sit down onto one of them, whilst occupying the other one.
‘A good battle or a night out with friends would’ve been more preferable to you, wouldn’t it?’
Again, in case you are not very familiar with the whole thing, Dying Swan isn’t a part of the Swan Lake ballet. It’s more like a little four-minute ‘spin-off’, well, it’s more complicated than that, but, still, it is about the Swan Queen from Swan Lake, anyway. I’m in love with it as well, and I’ll try to at least partially include its spirit into this story, to the best of my ability.
I decided to make some visual aids. Everything grey or brown you see on the pictures is a cygnet or a juvenile swan. Sherlock is, obviously, an Australian black swan in this story.
He was too scared to come out of his hiding place just yet. He was hungry, but too frightened. His body was still very tired and achy and he still couldn’t think clearly, so he decided to give himself some time and just rest.
The next day, he found himself getting annoyed with one of the cases from one of the folders brought by Lestrade during his last visit. The case wasn’t particularly complicated. A relative had killed another one for a piece of a family heirloom, and Sherlock knew who the murderer was, even the police suspected that person more than others, but, in order to prove said person’s guilt and challenge her alibi, Sherlock needed more data. For that, he had to leave the flat, which, of course, he wasn’t really allowed to do, or ring Lestrade, which he didn’t feel like doing at the moment. He wasn’t impressed with the Work, he wasn’t impressed with himself doing the Work. His progress wasn’t even mediocre. John hadn’t rung yet, and Sherlock caught himself looking at his mobile every so often. Annoyed with himself, he stood up abruptly and grabbed his violin.
If he shared his observations and odd feelings, would people think he was insane? His family members probably wouldn’t think anything like that, but they’d always believed that he had a very vivid imagination, ‘shockingly vivid’ at times, and, otherwise, was a very unusual child with unusual interests and cast of mind, which, of course, they were right about. He didn’t agree about his imagination, though. He didn’t imagine anything, he explored and analysed! So what that he used to play pirates?
(See the end of the chapter for
There were several new swans in the flock, brought by Moriarty. One of them went by the name of Molly. She was probably of the same age as Sherlock and, therefore, had a body of an adult swan with white, adult plumage from the start. She tried to befriend him, but he wasn’t really interested in close friendships; he was particularly unimpressed when he learned that she had been seduced by Moriarty in his human form and easily lured here, rather than abducted. Moriarty wasn’t even that much into women; couldn’t she observe and, at least, suspect that she had been dealing with a maniac who, for example, abducted people for fun? She was embarrassed when he pointed it out.
Sherlock wasn’t free from depression, or moments when the unexplainable, bone-deep cold imbued him, or the strange feeling that he was running out of time, for some reason, which made him restless and anxious. There was also an acute awareness that he had lost plenty of time and he’d never have it back, nor would he ever get out of this cursed place; it made him feel almost claustrophobic, which didn’t make sense, as there was plenty of space. And yet, Sherlock wasn’t as deeply depressed and suicidal as before, now that, just for a few hours per night, he could have his body back, his ‘transport’. When the word first surfaced in his thoughts, Sherlock froze for a few moments, not knowing where it had come from and why it sounded so meaningful.
The flock members were curious and had questions; they, however, were aware by now when it was best to leave him alone. Archie was never far away from him, but he kept quiet as well, even though he was curious, too. Sherlock was grateful for his silent presence.
It was hard to believe, but he was getting married and crowned soon. He was going to have to try to be a responsible King and husband, even if not everything about it sat well with him.
John could see now why Queen Martha had chosen to come here. Not only it was easier and faster for the foreign royalty and nobility to travel here rather than to the British Isles, since Bavaria was practically at the centre of Europe, but, perhaps, she was also hoping that he’d feel more relaxed here, away from his duties and politics for the time being.
He’d given Mary every excuse his deductive skills could provide. He hadn’t been lying, he’d just been voicing the truths selectively. He intentionally shut his eyes to certain things, such as some of Mary’s remarks that were, not quite openly, cruel and insensitive, whilst looking like innocent jokes to laugh off and dismiss. He couldn’t tell if her occasional passive-aggressive behaviour was deliberate or natural, and thus, wasn’t supposed to be taken personally, but rather had to be treated as her individual peculiarity instead. Some people would’ve seen those things as so-called red flags, but that just didn’t matter. Sherlock was hardly the nicest, most thoughtful person either; he could be cruel and brutally sarcastic, deliberately or otherwise, so he couldn’t blame her for the attitude she displayed now and then. She was capable of rousing interest in someone attracted to danger, but did not pose a threat to John, personally. And she was making John happy most of the time. John deserved to be happy. The complete absence of romantic relationships and interest in creating a family were in Sherlock’s nature, not John’s. If the doctor was no longer capable of fully trusting Mary (the main reason was her shooting Sherlock, rather than her past), it didn’t mean he didn’t want a family and a daughter, who was soon to be born.
guest, not theirs. He desperately hoped it wouldn’t change. He didn’t want to share…
‘Their loss’, John said sincerely and Sherlock felt his face warming. He was blushing… It was ridiculous. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Thankfully, Archie chose this moment to enter. He froze, surprised to find a stranger in the chapel.
‘You’re perfectly aware that I don’t have many reasons to be happy’. It was barely audible and Sherlock still avoided looking him in the eye.
, his mind prompted quietly, but he could never really hold on to the thought. And yet, he knew it was his home, where he had been born, had grown up (was still growing up, in fact) and where he belonged.
Sherlock tried to escape him in the forest, but John kept following, until the younger man hid behind a large oak tree, finally stopping. John allowed him some space, not walking round the tree to face him.
And, of course, there had been the relief of finally letting familiar substances into his greedily pulsing veins, one last time before everything was over, once and for all. His two years away had been an ordeal, and he’d known he would’ve never been able to do it again, so it was best to choose the familiar way of letting his own life go, on his own terms. But he hadn’t seen it though, due to the unexpected interruption. He’d survived, solved his inner mystery, just to solve the real one after the message of Moriarty’s return had been broadcasted. Thankfully, Sherlock hadn’t gone too far yet, in any sense, so he’d been able to both see that message and comprehend that it had
the ball, which was a necessary politeness for a host. She wanted to be addressed to simply as 'Mary', and he liked it as well.
It didn’t last, as there was some noise outside his shelter. He nearly screamed when something invaded it. At first, he thought it was a snake, but no, it was a bird with a long, flexible neck. A swan. A giant one. Sherlock lashed out at it in both anger and fear. Taken aback, it retreated and left him alone. He didn’t want any more of giant birds anywhere near him.
When everything was over, he opened his eyes and realised that he was lying on his side. John’s concerned face was above him, and Sherlock was a tiny bit startled at first, but it didn’t last. He allowed John’s experienced fingers to find the pulse point on his neck. After measuring his pulse, the man took a look at his pupils.
‘Getting married isn’t that bad’, Mike attempted as well.
‘Hello, brother dearest’, Mycroft greeted, somewhat smugly, as always, but there was an undertone of sadness and weariness in his voice. The black swan’s body stopped on its own at the water’s edge. ‘Of course, you would be unlike any of them’, the older man nodded at the other swans indifferently and briefly. ‘You’re never like anyone else’. Sherlock was still looking at him in disbelief. Mycroft hadn’t really changed. He looked weary, but he wasn’t any older than the last time Sherlock had seen him, except, now his age actually felt right, unlike back then.
‘The things I do for you!’ Moriarty chided, getting up. ‘I wasn’t even supposed to interfere. But it’s not yet time for your swan song, or, rather, your dying swan dance. Oh, how I love to see you dance! Alas, it’s not yet time for your entrance’, he smiled, seemingly both a bit frustrated and a bit excited. Sherlock couldn’t even bother trying to understand what he meant by that. The sorcerer then left, humming under his nose again. The injured swan closed his eyes in relief, not quite believing that he’d got off so lightly. He felt Archie pressing himself into his good wing, obviously relieved as well.
‘Oh, my beautiful swans!’ he crooned, looking them over. They barely moved, as always, not daring to look him in the eye. He marvelled at their looks and even flirted with some of them, regardless of their sex, aggravating their uneasiness even more, before he stopped near Sherlock and looked him all over as well. Sherlock had plenty of questions about their new situation, but he knew he wouldn’t get any answers from the sorcerer, who hadn’t changed at all from the day he’d brought him to this lake as a young boy. His posh attires changed, but he hadn’t become any older.
‘Yes’.
is incomplete’, Mycroft said pointedly, looking John in the eye for the first time since the beginning of their talk. And he was looking intensely, expectantly, as if these words were the key to everything. John had no time for puzzles and vague explanations, so he ran down the stairs, accidentally stumbling onto Mike, who probably wanted to talk to him in person and congratulate him on his betrothal.
‘Hounds then…’ The silence that followed was awkward and the stranger was the first one to break it. ‘Do you live somewhere nearby?’
Easily, as if Sherlock weighed very little, John lifted him off the sofa and carefully, yet quickly, put him on the floor on his back. Thirty steady and rhythmical chest compressions later, the doctor tilted Sherlock’s head back, pinched his nose and gave two deep and steady rescue breaths after sealing his mouth over his friend’s parted, cold and bluish, lips. The air went in freely and lifted the ribcage from the inside. Good. The action was followed by thirty more chest compressions.
‘Don’t…’ he whispered to the swanling, not wanting the boy to get himself hurt on his behalf.
What was he even thinking? Even though they were just friends, John did like Sherlock and even found him good-looking and aesthetically pleasing, that much was clear, but he was into women and liking Sherlock didn’t change that fact. Even if he chose Sherlock and gave him his heart, metaphorically speaking, what would he have even done with him? John preferred women and Sherlock had no preferences at all, not to mention carnal things weren’t normally interesting to him, weren’t his forte, most definitely. He would’ve willingly surrendered himself to John, though. He imagined John taking him the way he took women, penetrating him, perhaps even spilling his seed into him, because there was no risk of an unwanted pregnancy; he wouldn’t have had to be careful. Maybe, from behind, John would’ve been able to pretend he was taking a woman.
* * *
‘Uh-huh. There’s been an arrow stuck deep inside. I thought my arm would have to be amputated, due to infection, but I was lucky to both survive and keep my arm’, the Prince explained. Of course, he’d been shot…
‘Hello, boys and girls! I see you’ve had an interesting day today’, Moriarty mocked in his usual sing-song voice. The dead silence was the only answer and he sighed. And then, of course, he turned his attention to Sherlock. ‘Sherly, Sherly, Sherly…’ the sorcerer shook his head with another sigh of disappointment, looming over the injured swan, as he knelt in front of him. ‘As always, you’re absolutely terrible at taking care of yourself’. He reached out to touch the swan’s injured wing, but, suddenly, there was Archie in front of Sherlock after getting out from under his uninjured wing. The cygnet bit Moriarty’s hand, fast and hard, making him yelp. The attack looked more like the one of a venomous snake, rather than of a swan. Archie was good at biting, as some other swans had learned the hard way when they’d first met him.
‘Well, that’s too bad then for those who have planned it that way, because I’m allowed to choose you. If this is what you want as well, of course’, he quickly added.
On the one hand, the hunter hadn’t seemed evil, but, from the look of his face and steadiness of his hands, Sherlock, despite being in a state of panic back then, could deduce that the man was truly accustomed to violence and murder, and, no, it wasn’t about him hunting animals. Did Sherlock truly want to go and talk to someone like that? He was going to have to go and meet Archie on the way, to make sure the boy got here safely. And, if he moved quietly… He was changing now, so his thoughts were no longer clear for the time being. The transformation was something he hadn’t really got used to, even after all of those years, but he knew how to move and breathe to make the recovering process faster than during that choking, panicked nightmare his first several transformations had been.
‘You weren’t expecting a good ending anyway, were you?’ the sorcerer scoffed, ignoring the futile outburst. He pressed himself against a tree, folding his arms on his chest. ‘Do you not know that the original version ends with the Prince and the Swan Queen committing suicide together, because the vow binds the Prince to the liar he promised his heart to? Their suicide causes the power of the spell to backfire and it kills the evil sorcerer himself; his own power. There’s another version, where the sorcerer kills the Prince, and the Swan Queen never turns into a human again, left to mourn her lover, as a swan. Oh, there was another one, where the Prince drags the sorcerer into the lake, where they both die. Too bad the sacrifice doesn’t help the swan one bit. But I think we know how this fairy tale ends for
Did any of it even matter now that John had left? And, for the umpteenth time, there was an intense episode of déjà vu, as if the loss of John had already happened before. Perhaps, it wasn’t that bad to just stop existing as a person if he had mental problems that were getting worse, at any rate? His own resignation was frightening.
That was it. He was going to take a brief look at that chapel and see what Mycroft wanted him to see, even though he was completely uninterested. And then he’d finally end this pointless existence. He was long overdue. He wouldn’t experiment with any plants, he wouldn’t risk getting himself severely injured, but not killed, by throwing himself down from the height. Hounds were the guaranteed way to die. It would be painful and terrifying, but he no longer cared. They would tear at his body, shaking and tousling it. That was how they killed. He had deduced it from the minuscule remains of the killed swan, – a
His friends were suspicious of his recent behaviour, because he was often pensive and distracted. Bill believed that John had decided to enjoy some freedom with a woman, whom he kept secret and visited at nights, which was the reason he slept until afternoons. Bill was totally supportive of it, of course, even though he didn’t have any of his questions answered about the ‘mysterious woman’. John would’ve been happy to share the truth, but a promise was a promise, and he was a man of his word. His heart made him want to spend more time with his new secret friend, but, when he looked at Queen Martha, he saw how unfair it was towards her to keep evading his responsibilities. He had to accept his duties for her sake and for the sake of the country; it was long overdue, in fact.
Now that he’d met and befriended Sherlock, which was an adventure on its own, he was even less thrilled about the ball than he had been the day he’d learned about it. It just seemed particularly ill-timed at the moment.

‘But they are royals. I thought the other women, including myself, were mostly just for show, but had no real chances’.
He could tell that the swanling was at first very uncomfortable with the idea of dipping his head below the surface. Seeing him struggling with it one day, Sherlock sighed and paddled towards him to explain that they could swallow underwater and that their eyes were not like the eyes of humans. They had a special membrane that allowed them to see very well underwater to locate food without getting their eyes irritated or their vision blurred. It was quite different to what a human would experience and Sherlock recommended Archie to try until he got used to the thought that he could keep his eyes open without trouble. While he was a cygnet and his neck wasn’t that long yet, it was long enough to start feeding underwater. But, even though he was still learning how to do it, he could stick to the plant matter on the surface. Sherlock thought that, as a cygnet, he had been of the same size back when he had become a swan, so he could speak from experience. The only difference between them was that Archie was, more likely than not, a mute swan.
Sherlock couldn’t help remembering John’s lips and hands on him often enough. Way too often. He both dreaded those thoughts and felt agonisingly nostalgic and needy, recalling every single detail and sensation and how amazing they had felt. ‘The forbidden kiss’, he secretly referred to it, rolling his eyes at his own dramatics. Still, he decided to add the memory to his other best memories of John. He was going to need them, so he collected them and sorted them out by categories. John was going to leave soon, in any case, and, after that, it would be just a matter of time before the spell turned Sherlock into a swan for the rest of his life and took those precious memories away; that is if Sherlock didn’t take his own life before it happened. He wasn’t sure yet how exactly those things were going to happen.
‘P-pierre?’ Sherlock breathed out.
He was getting too thirsty to keep up like this. Even though they brought him plant matter that was soaked and wet, it was still too dry for a swan. He moved slightly away from the place where the flock resided (he didn’t want to consume their floating feathers together with water) and close to the water’s line to always have access to the fresh, clean water. Soon, he started going to the chapel again. Archie made fire, read aloud for him or helped him with experiments when Sherlock started conducting them again. It was much better than nothing. From what he could gather, while both radius and ulna had been broken, it was a relatively clean fracture. Those bones were likely cracked in some other places as well, but he was lucky that there were no other breaks. For an arm it would’ve been bad, but wouldn’t have rendered it completely useless in the future, unless there were some severe complications, whereas for a wing it would’ve been an absolute disaster.
‘See you, John’, Sherlock said. But he knew John could only hear a soft, melodious sound of a black swan. John nodded, nonetheless, and headed in nearly the same direction he had come from. Hopefully, he’d be able to avoid the hounds and quickly find his way back to his companions. Sherlock himself took off from his usual spot that had enough room for a swan’s take-off run. In passing, he saw John turning and looking at him, obviously attracted by the flapping of wings.
The feeling of despair and helplessness drove Sherlock back into his hiding place under the roots.
‘I’m sorry’, John replied sincerely. He wanted to say something else, but refrained.
And it was then when something odd started happening. Sherlock became dizzy, his eyes unfocussed, and his body seemed to have started losing its strength. His muscles started stretching on their own, aching badly; his bones felt on the verge of shattering into pieces. He couldn’t hold back a scream. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but his body was changing its shape, that much was clear. Moaning, he collapsed on the floor. But the noise wasn’t the one of a swan; it was the one of a human! Before Sherlock managed to start analysing the situation, he realised that he couldn’t breathe normally and was choking and wheezing. It made him feel scared and helpless. But then, despite the even stronger rush of light-headedness, he chose to listen to his mind that told him that he had to calm down. Swans had a significantly different, more complex, respiratory system, designed to make them get much more oxygen, primarily needed for their flights. Humans and other mammals had nothing like that. It was anatomically different and it felt different, too. He had to remember how to breathe as a human, had to let this body do what was natural to it, after all, he had been born with this body.
‘Well, you knew it was going to happen, sooner or later. At least, you’ve got two months of absolute freedom, so let’s take the best out of it, shall we?!’ Bill tried to cheer him up.
, his frightened mind prompted. He remembered hearing an outlandish rumour about a dark sorcerer with this name, but he couldn’t recall any details, since he had probably dismissed them as something stupid and definitely not real.
‘John’, he replied jokingly and they smiled at each other. ‘May I interest you in a dance, Mary?’ he asked without preamble or thinking twice. It was expected of him to spend time with the guests and he’d rather do it with someone of his choice, before people started whispering that the Prince didn’t like anybody and the ball was a waste of everyone’s time. It would've been a bit not good for him, as well as for Queen Martha and their kingdom.
‘What?’ Sherlock demanded curiously.
At first, he was quite enthusiastic about exploring the place. But, more often than not, when he thought he’d found something interesting, he realised that he’d already seen it before. When he thought he’d found an interesting book in the library, it didn’t take long for him to recognise it as something he’d read before and probably even argued with something that the author of said book tried to pass for a fact. Sherlock had always enjoyed disproving ‘facts’.
Very pretty and, in many regards, rather interesting, in his opinion, Jeanette, from a ducal family of Spain, turned out to be a bit of a drama queen when she threw a small tantrum to her small retinue, for some reason. John’s Spanish wasn’t very good, but, from what he understood, nobody had told her there were going to be so many people to ‘compete’ with, including the royals, and for this, she’d made such a long way! Well, it looked like they had something in common, because he hadn’t imagined a crowd like this, either (though he would’ve probably known if he had enquired about the ball during the preparations, just once). Jeanette was also indignant, because someone who had packed her luggage had forgotten something she’d planned to take with her. Oh… She’d wanted to be wearing another dress tonight, tailored specifically for this event, but she had to wear ‘rags’, instead. He considered approaching and assuring her that she looked stunning in her beautiful sapphire-coloured gown. Some people nearby were a bit scandalised by her display of moodiness, whereas John found himself secretly enjoying the show. He wasn’t sure if it was making her notable and made it clear that she was just as unenthusiastic about the ball as he was, or if he shouldn’t even consider the possibility of marrying her, and, therefore, shouldn’t give her any special attention, tempting as it was. He had to admit that melodramatic people did have their charm. Sherlock, for example, could be quite melodramatic and outright sulky at times (no, John didn’t mean his sadness lately, that was different), but it had never made the Prince regret their friendship. The thought made his secret smile even wider and not so secret any longer.
‘I’ve already made some arrangements for the ball in two months. It’ll be a beautiful feast with a lot of foreign guests and dancing’, she said, sounding excited and definitely looking forward to it.
‘Oh, Sherley… I’m just playing my role. As are they…’ he nodded towards the flock of swans Sherlock hadn’t noticed before. It was probably one of them who had bothered him earlier. They were not giant, as he’d thought, but rather normal-sized for adult or almost adult swans. They were clearly trying to stay away from Moriarty. Motionless and silent, they were cuddled together, never looking at the sorcerer, obviously unwilling to attract his attention with a movement, a noise or anything else at all. Sherlock, too, wanted to run and hide, but he felt too clumsy and unwilling to turn his back on the sorcerer.
‘That’s unlikely. Again, if it was that simple, Mycroft would’ve done it. He’s got very capable people at his disposal’, Sherlock sighed. John’s eagerness to 'deal with the baddie' and 'free the innocent captives', however, was heart-warming. He suddenly found it thrilling and breathtaking to imagine somebody finding quick, cold, merciless execution from this man’s hand on Sherlock’s behalf. Heroic, with strong moral principles… his hand would have been completely steady if he ever got a chance to eliminate the sorcerer. Alas, no one knew (except for Mycroft, perhaps) what would happen if Moriarty died. Was it even possible, considering the fact he wasn’t ageing? And if he died, would it bring any positive difference? Or would his creations, which the swans were, die with him? There was no point in daydreaming or allowing himself to become a hostage of vain hopes. ‘There’s nothing you can do’, he shook his head.
Even if John was interested in anything like that, he had life and duties he could not and would not abandon. Starting a new royal dynasty, having a normal royal family with heirs, ruling a country, fulfilling people’s hopes, especially the hopes of his entourage, people he cared about… There was a lot of work ahead of him. Choosing Sherlock, whom he hadn’t really known that long, would’ve meant leaving
The desire to spend more time with this Mind Palace friend was making Sherlock almost unconsciously increase his doses of drugs. John (the real one) kept calling every day, and it was taking more and more from Sherlock to act as if nothing was the matter, while, on the inside, he was begging:
‘I’m so sorry that I cannot be more helpful. I wish I could do more for you than just bring you all those useless things’. He knew he sounded a little frustrated now.
“Of course.”
“Sherlock! You know what they do to Omegas here!”
He dropped his overnight bag on the floor and took off his coat, and then his shirt – he was getting better at doing the buttons one handed, but it still took a frustratingly long amount of time and concentration. When it was finally off, he threw it on the floor in disgust. Then he unstrapped the prosthesis and rolled the sock off of his arm. It felt WONDERFUL to have that thing off.
Harry laughed, not entirely kindly. “So what does he need YOU for?”
“Yeah.” Lestrade admitted. He winced. “You’ve got quite a bruise there, John, you OK?” He pointed at his own forehead to indicate mine.
“And you.” Sherlock murmured. John’s fingers stroked his bond bite and Sherlock felt calm and loved. The turmoil he felt from his Alpha stilled for a moment.
"For this? Yes!"
“Yeah. Yes. I’m good.”
"You ate?" Shane asked from the kitchen.
It was wrong! Victor was shadowed... he was the bad thing! He was infecting Sherlock! He didn't have to throw him over the edge, his menace was growing within Sherlock, taking him over.
"Oh! Who? How?"
John grabbed more water and another energy bar and rejoined Sherlock on the mattress. He stretched his legs out, pressing his thigh against Sherlock’s back, and arranged Sherlock’s blanket so it covered them both, pulling another blanket over his shoulders. He drank deeply from his bottle of water.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No. Irene is fascinating, but she has a... chromosomal disadvantage."
“We do.” Sherlock said. His breathing was shallow and his heart beat too rapidly, but his hands were steady in mine.
“Are they together? Seb and Cam?” I asked Mary  whilst the former checked on dinner and the latter was engaged with other guests.
This was the deal he'd made. He would live with it.
"I've missed the big guy." Shane said and took the head in his mouth, sliding his hand down the shaft to the bollocks. John knew he still looked like hell – dark purple from groin to knee. But Shane didn't hesitate, he quickly had John moaning and gripping the couch cushion.
The woman shrugged. “Brown coat. Rubber wellies. Tucked ‘is trousers in ‘is wellies – didn’t wanna get dirty. Gold ‘air. Not like ‘is.” She pointed at John’s hair. “Yellow.”
"Angus." John said, picking up the chair with deliberate care. "Cheers, mate." He said wryly. "Did you even go home?" The nurse's expression was intense – that predatory hunger John had glimpsed earlier, mingled with outrage. He was thinking about how his boyfriend had left him, not John and Shane.
Mycroft laughed bitterly. “Yes. Sherlock used cocaine now and again – when he wanted someone to think he was anything other than a strung-out junkie.”
“I don’t care.” John said, exhaustion overcoming him.
I could see that one pensioner was eyeing me speculatively. She wanted to pump me for information about what the police where doing here. I closed my eyes and waited for the interminable ride to end.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was out of the flat right now, at physical therapy. As a bonded Omega, Sherlock was no longer dangerous – his heat would make Alphas uncomfortable, but he would never again inspire a violent riot with his pheromones. He had stayed home all the same, lounging on the sofa in languid comfort. Sherlock could feel his hormones curling through his groin, exciting his erectile tissues. After today, no one expected to see or hear from them for a week.
… suddenly Sherlock couldn’t breathe! He cried out, staggered back into the wall and fell, excruciating pain radiating from his shoulder. He saw the boss's angry eyes staring down at him right before he passed out.
Equally as obvious, to Mycroft’s mind, there was only one suspect: the man he had insisted his brother take as protector and mate.
"It hasn't happened before?"
"You kissed him. I've never seen you kiss anyone. Not even Irene."
In the common room I was enviously watching a toothless prisoner score oxy when I was approached by one of Vinokourov’s lieutenants. I was delighted – I needed a way into the gang and hadn’t expected an opportunity to begin insinuating myself so soon. I had to force myself not to grin.
"Too much." John grumbled. He kept his left arm down, as if his hand were in his lap.
"John, we had a whole conversation about it." Angus protested. "You said you wanted to accept Sherlock's proposal but you were afraid to give up Shane – you thought Shane was more trustworthy than Sherlock. You said you were quite torn about it, but you couldn't keep them both."
has a soul.”
After that, John didn't hug his sister no matter if Dad were around not. He didn't snuggle up when they read books or watched telly. And if she had a nightmare, John would walk her to the kitchen and give her a glass of water. After she'd calmed down, she went back to her own bed.
“I only wish it were under better circumstances.”
John examined his face for another moment. Then he nodded once, his jaw tensing, and pulled his shirt and hoodie together off over his head – with only a slight awkwardness. Sherlock spared a hand to range over John's chest, carding through the patch of coarse red hair he found there. The bruises on his wrist and neck were still prominent, but his chest looked almost untouched now. It was fascinating to see the twitch of John's muscles under his skin without the soft pad of fat hiding them. They were bulky, manly, and they made Sherlock's mouth water with want.
Because it was John, it was working. I felt myself calming, the panic and fear receding.
He returned Simon Fraser to his original position and zipped the body bag. No one paid him any attention as he left the morgue.
God! We’ve known each other for eight years! And we never once… only to find out
“Several ideas.” Sherlock replied. “I have to run some tests.” Then he was sweeping away, startling John, who jumped up and trailed after him.
Moran’s appetite for sadism was obvious, even without knowing all the things he’d done to John.
“Lock it!” The Alpha said through the door. “Bolt it and push anything heavy you have in there against it. I’m not going to last much longer, you have to bar the door.”
John examined Shane for a moment. He wasn't handsome but he was VITAL. That was what John liked about him most – he recognized that it was a quality Shane shared with Sherlock. They looked nothing alike, Shane had olive skin and wavy brown hair worn long and floppy – it was his one beauty and his one vanity. He wasn't quite as tall as Sherlock; he was lean, almost too thin as Sherlock was, but he lacked the elegance. Shane wore jeans or khakis, rumpled shirts and slim-cut jumpers under a tan trench coat that had seen better days. He was just an average guy except for the gleam of intelligence in his expression and the incredible vitality that emanated from him. John wondered briefly if he needed that vitality in an unhealthy way – like a vampire needs blood. He dismissed that thought and returned to the question at hand – to go to Shane's flat or not.
“He’s not an Alpha.” Mycroft said – unnecessarily, Sherlock thought with impatience, until he felt John’s release of tension.
"If you choose Shane instead of him."
Clay.
"Yeah, I want to monitor his fever, make sure it doesn't get dangerously high. Thank you."
“My hand.” I told her, lifting my left arm. “Broken fingers.” She examined it carefully and dictated some notes.
“John, Moriarty is dangerous. I couldn’t bear it if anything happened to you. I would do anything to keep you safe.”
John stripped off quickly and started experimenting with the knobs and levers for the right balance of heat and spray. I joined him, enjoying his pleasure as he immersed himself in the hot water. I loved how he looked, wet and gleaming, the small muscles of his abdomen flexing and shifting as he wiped water out of his eyes.
“You what!?”
John got out of bed, wrapped himself in his dressing gown and padded into the kitchen. He put the kettle on. He made tea, letting the ritual calm him. Then he carried his steaming mug into the living room. Shane had left the letter on the mantle. John picked it up. It was a cheap drugstore envelope with a page or two folded, inside. Nothing special.
Mrs. Hudson intervened, both with Sherlock and with the nurse who appeared. They would have to change the sheets, maybe even the bed.
Whatever happens, these three months, two weeks and four days with John Watson have been the best of my life. I will cherish every moment we have left.
"Great. Enjoy." John's sarcasm was bitter.
“You’re special, John.” In my peripheral vision I saw his eyes, soft and reassuring. He had his hands splayed, palms outward in offering. He had stepped closer to her.
"So, Sherlock, I haven't seen you in years. What has brought you back?"
The waiter came by and John ordered a double scotch. He avoided looking at Shane's worried expression.
“A friend of mine is having a dinner party next Saturday and he wants to invite you – all my friends want to meet the person who rescued me... and he needs you to make an even number...”
"I don't want off the hook." John snapped. "If you'd rather have Grindr, just say so!"
The smuggler gave me a pointed look. “Better to sell than have it taken. And it will be taken.”
“Sherrinford.” Mycroft said. “Most of the house was empty, there’s plenty of room.”
"I'm off." The nurse said. "How's he doing?"
“Oi!” Lestrade called. “We need to bag her hands.”
"You didn't want your father to remarry?"
Instead, John picked up Shane’s hand and caressed it. “I think I’m too drunk.” He said. “But maybe next time?”
“It’s a competitive school.” Molly said, girding herself for eventual disappointment. “You must be very good to have been accepted here, Mr. Watson.”
I bit his jaw – less gently than I’d intended – and Sherlock’s arms pinioned me like iron bars. I could escape if I wanted to, I knew several very effective techniques, but I DIDN’T want to. I was high on him, euphoric in our intense embrace. He kissed my neck, my collarbone, my chin, my mouth. Our kisses were kinetic, tongues warring, teeth clashing, his stubble scraping my face raw.
“Mm. Yeah, healing well.” I said awkwardly.
“Can you stand?” John asked. “I’m right here, I won’t let you fall.”
It was a short trip. The car stopped in an alley that I recognised – it was only a few blocks away from Baker Street, less than half a kilometer from 221. Sherlock opened the alley door with a key and led me in. “Mycroft has had every building with a sightline to our flat under surveillance.” Sherlock told me as we waited for the antiquated lift. “Mary Morstan has been spotted entering this building.”
But not stupid. I see how she grits her teeth, clenches her jaw. I see the slight tremor of her trigger finger. I hear Moriarty’s words in her mouth.
But John wasn’t there when Harry presented.
The therapist had Sherlock write a letter to John, telling him all the things he never had, all the things he felt. She stressed that this was an exercise, the letter would never be mailed. It was just a way for Sherlock to order his thoughts, work out what he wanted to say to John.
“The service is tomorrow.” She said.
Shane frowned. But he carefully – keeping a wary eye on Angus – stepped around the wheelchair and pulled it from the lift.
“Sit.” I said and he relinquished my hand. “What can I get for you?”
“A futon?” I felt dismayed – I hadn’t slept on a futon since Uni, but I remembered how uncomfortable I had found it.
John climbed on top of Sherlock where he lay on the couch, still favouring his injured shoulder, and lined up their erections. Then he leaned over and blew a raspberry in the open ‘V’of his shirt.
John grabbed fistfuls of my hair and pulled my head in. I felt his thick cock pressing against the back of my throat and I worked to relax it. He pulled out and thrust with his hips and forced his cock down my throat. I hummed in appreciation. I pressed my face into his abdomen, my chin resting on his pelvic bone. Then John began fucking my mouth.
"You left him thinking you dead for two years, why would you care WHO John befriended?! Because I might be like the bloke outside - interested in John because of you?! Sorry to disappoint, but I didn't even know he knew you for months. Not until you got sloppy and let someone see you at that poncey rehab clinic. That set him back, you know. He tried to hide it, but he was depressed for weeks after that, you selfish prick." Shane stood abruptly and paced the kitchen floor. "Why am I bothering to tell you - you don't care what you did to him. You're back and it's convenient to have him around again - or convenient to move back into this flat, so you make him believe it's all about him. But it's all about YOU, isn't it. Everything is all about you."
Time to get creative.
John nodded. "Have you been thinking about this long?" He asked.
He turned away. He wished he could roll onto his side and curl up in the fetal position, but he didn’t want to move the limb. He didn’t want to know what it would feel like to clutch it to his chest. Not yet.
Then his fingers were flying over the keyboard (which prompted a fond thought of John hunting and pecking) and he was searching through menus, compressing folders and uploading them to his Dropbox.
"Good! That's good."
"I know." Sherlock said. "But you need to. He needs you to."
) But his joy was short-lived. The stocky woman slammed into him and John found himself fighting her. John had had training in close-quarters fighting at boot camp and his semi-annual sojourns with the RAMC (he had to pay for medical school somehow and the army had offered in return for his service) and it served him now just as much as his inborn Alpha aggression. He fought off the woman but was immediately attacked by two more Alphas. For a minute it was glorious, pure Alpha adrenaline channeled through his fists…
“Not yet arrived, I’m afraid.” Mycroft said, looking ever so slightly alarmed at his brother’s vehemence. He glanced at Anthea who showed him the screen of her smartphone. “My team is still at the clinic. You’ll just have to wait, brother-mine.”
He'd had sex with Shane.
“It’s common for orphaned Omegas.”
"Back already?" John jumped – he'd been so wrapped up in his thoughts, he hadn't seen Angus Church approach.
Sherlock had been ushered into the room and left alone. He was no longer bound. Shane had been drugged immediately and spent the hour plus journey in the uncomfortable lorry passed out on the metal floor. But other than duct taping his wrists and ankles together, Sherlock hadn’t been touched. After ten minutes jouncing through traffic he’d envied Shane.
John took a better look at the guns laying on the bar. "They're fake." He said.
“He’ll be watching.” Sherlock told John.
"Procedure." She said.
Mycroft heaved a sigh. “I went to Tallinn, following a lead from the brothel. I took apart a drugs smuggling scheme he had there, but Moriarty slipped the net.”
But he didn't want to! He LOVED John!
Lestrade pushed Mrs Hudson behind him and extended his baton with a flick of his wrist. “Shut the bloody door!” He cried, smashing the foremost infected in the face.
WTF Mary Morstan!? Are you an innocent pawn in all this or are you a bad actor? Does Moran KNOW that John KNOWS? Or does he want to get closer to John simply to find out what, if anything, he knows?
“Erm...hey, Angus...” Shane started.
As I lay there, tense and terrified, I became aware of several things at once: I could smell biscuits baking; a light was on in the next room; I wasn’t alone.
“I c-couldn’t remember which w-way was back. I k-kept getting turned around.”
Bit of BAMF John for your entertainment. Everybody loves sexy BAMF John.
“OK. What then?” I asked, fingers in his hair, caressing, petting, trying to calm him.
“Whatever happens, I’m here.” He whispered. “They can’t separate us without hurting you. And they won’t scare me away.” John pressed a kiss to the bond bite on Sherlock’s neck, tracing the familiar pattern of his teeth with his lips – his gran had told him that you could always tell that an Omega had been bred against his or her will if the bond bite was ragged. The bite he’d given Sherlock was perfect. The wound was deep, but it was healing quickly – the scar would be flawless. “I feel how much you want to believe in me and how much you don’t – how you don’t dare let yourself. But you’ll see. You can trust me, Sherlock. I won’t let you down.”
“John, get your coat!” Sherlock had cried. “We have a case!”
Lestrade’s DI was at the scene, an Alpha male with an aura of calm, giving orders to his team, forensic techs weaving around them.
“You’ll be wanting something to eat first.” She said.
“You were right to worry, I guess.” John said, relieved that her eyes didn’t wander to the space where his left hand should be.
“This is goodbye.” She said when the ambulance stopped. Good luck, Mr. Holmes.”
"No, Sherlock! You aren't leaving this room."
“Generally better than he gets on with someone you’re seeing.”
“Ugh... I really am... enough about me. I’m sick of me. How are you, Mary? Tell me something interesting.”
“It wasn’t JUST acid, John, it was Bascal-S, a deliming agent and pickle acid used in taxidermy.  It looks like he was trying to separate the compounds found on these fingertips and stumbled onto it.”
Sherlock had been without a case for over 24 hours, and hated the world and everything in it, particularly a smug John.
“John…”
They managed to get Sherlock into the shower without meeting each other’s eyes.  John stood outside the enclosure, there was no way he could go through with his original plan of getting in now, and Sherlock did his best to remain upright inside.  While Sherlock held John’s shoulders, the doctor grabbed the flannel and the soap and made efficient work of his back and legs, with a cursory brush over his arse.  John moved and Sherlock shifted his grip, turning to face his flat mate.  John ran the flannel over the bruised ribs and gently past the incision.  When there was nothing left to do but Sherlock’s crotch, he said “Let’s wash your hair now.”
“Yeah.  It does.”
***********************************
John worked at the clinic on Sunday, went to the pub with Lestrade Sunday night, and worked again on Monday.
John knew on Christmas, when Mycroft told him Sherlock smoked the single cigarette.  He’d imagined Sherlock’s head tipping back, his eyes closed, lips pursed to blow out the smoke.  John imagined that’s what Sherlock would look like on the edge of pleasure, and wondered if he’d ever shown that look to another person.
Sherlock continued.  “I sent Rhys away.  He’s a fine man, and deserves the best.  He deserves someone who can love him wholeheartedly, and that’s not me.”
As quickly as he could, he disentangled himself from the still-sleeping detective and slid from the bed.
“And that’s it really.  The song is about my sister, and how she was treated, and how even with all that shite she had to go through, I’m still a little envious.  She found someone worth fighting everything for, someone that brought passion to her life.  She and Clara, they’re still together, even though Harry’s such a hot mess.  They both work so hard to make their relationship work, like they’d die without it.”
Seconds before he expected to be tossed out on his ear, a throaty laugh floated across the foyer, followed by a cultured admonition.  “Jensen, I appreciate your attention to protocol, but this is Doctor John Watson.”  John’s name was enunciated clearly, a full stop between each word.  The butler (Jensen, John assumed) paled slightly and bowed his head.  “Of course, mum, I don’t know what I was thinking.  Please, Dr. Watson, accept my apologies, and enjoy your evening.”
“NO.  I’m going to the sofa.  If you are all to be believed, I’ve been in bed for days already.  I do not wish to spend any more time there.”  Sherlock knew the hospital staff was right, logically, but he couldn’t trust it yet.  His brain was still fuzzy around the edges, and he couldn’t trust it either.  Until he could, he had to treat everything with skepticism.
My church offers no absolutes
Once on the bed, the last vestiges of hesitancy fell away.  Their hands were starting to explore, finally able to get better experienced with each other.  There wasn’t any sense of urgency though, they seemed a bit more at ease than just even a few minutes before.
John nodded, then shook his head, then looked at Sherlock.
So.  Not Greg.  Interesting.  He’d have to ponder that more later, when his brain functioned.  Right now he had to get up and try not to explode.
"We were born sick"
The water cleared away some of the fluff, and Sherlock began to take stock.  Body? Numb, but he could move.  Brain?  Fuzzy, but clearing.
“I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to know.  Sort of.  No- don’t talk.”  He cut Sherlock off.  “I’m always tagging along, always two steps behind and to the side.  You’re so brilliant and so fast, I can barely keep up.  This sort of thing?  Planning an incursion, using brawn instead of brain?  That’s what I can do.  So I did it, and I was kind of… I don‘t know.  Proud.  I planned it, I did it, I got you out.”
The trivial round, the common task,
Gradually he spread her cheeks and she gasped.  He began running his tongue up and down her cleft, making her moan softly and writhe.  Still licking, his fingers found her clit, stroking gently, getting her more and more into it.  Finally, he began fucking her with the same fingers as he licked further and further down her skin.
“Shuddup.  Sleep.  Here.  Talk later.”
Greg sighed again, then Rhys stood to help.
The packet was larger than a regular envelope, thick cream paper and navy calligraphy matched that of the invite to Rhys’ recital.  John was curious…
John gulped and wondered which way was east.  Before Mycroft turned the corner he stopped and pointed.  “East is that way.”
*************************************
In the “excitement” of the prior evening, John’s photos were left in the cab.  Greg brought them back on his way to the Yard….
Back at 221B, Lestrade told the cabbie to wait and propelled John up the stairs.  It was rough going, and by the time they’d reached the landing, Greg wasn’t sure he could get John up to his room.  He pushed the door open, thankful for small favors that it was unlocked. With John’s arm around his neck, he staggered into the parlor.
“That’s wonderful, Sherlock!  Mycroft should be so pleased!”
“I got stabbed with a knife.”
“It isn’t the same.  Your life isn’t in danger, you’re not missing.  You’re not possibly…”  John couldn’t finish.
She pulled off his jacket and shirt, and undid his belt and trousers.  He was stunned at the sudden heat in her eyes, and was broken from his reverie by her sharp request “Up!”  He lifted his hips, toed off his shoes and socks, and just like that, he was naked.
The third photo made Sherlock understand Lestrade’s compliment.  He and John did look quite good.  John, over his initial discomfort was smiling his real smile, full of genuine emotion.  John smiled a lot, but this particular KIND of smile didn’t come out very often.  But it did that night, and it was aimed full force at Sherlock.  Interesting.
“Mike? You’re not going to believe this.  Sherlock LIKES John!”
Time to push forward.
Sherlock staying at Mummy’s?  VOLUNTARILY?
He gently rolled John's balls in his right hand, and snaked his left up to John's nipple, rubbing it, and tweaking it just as gently.  John began to moan in earnest, and thrust his hips, trying to get more friction.  "Ohhhh Sherlock.  That's so sweet.  God your hands..."  His hands gripped Sherlock's thighs tightly and bucked harder.
“Mike, I’m desperate.  I need another dancer.”
Sherlock took John’s mug and put it on the table, then leaned in and kissed John gently on the lips.
After dinner, they stood on the balcony of their room and looked out over the Channel.  Sarah’s summer dress floated in the breeze, and John got a wicked gleam in his eye.  He moved back, then knelt behind her.  She started to turn, but he wouldn’t let her.  She laughed and kept looking out over the water.  Slowly, he began running his hands under her skirt, up and down her legs, just skimming over her skin.  She shivered at his touch.  After a few minutes, he reached up and pulled off her panties, and she protested.
****************************************
Sherlock complied eagerly.  He could feel John straining to stay still, his muscles quivering as he tried to keep from bucking his hips.  Sherlock continued to lick, nibble and scratch until John lost control and Sherlock could no longer keep his mouth touching skin.
Sherlock rolled John onto his back and began touching him.  First fingers up and down John’s legs, gently feeling the muscles, the skin, the hair.  But it wasn’t enough.  He leaned down and began licking.  He started with John’s ankles, exploring the thin skin there, feeling the sharp bones, feeling the Achilles tendon flex.  Up to his calves, biting the strong muscle there gently, tasting, licking…  the backs of John’s knees tasted of sweat, and Sherlock feasted until John begged him to stop.  The insides of John’s thighs showed pale scratches, and Sherlock nipped them gently.  At that, John nearly rocketed off the bed.  “Ohhhh God, Sherlock.  Do that again.  Use your nails.”
They got out of the car, and walked into the building.  A young woman greeted them with a smile.
“I had two bodies come in, both with very strange fingertips- they looked… dissolved.  But not like from strong acid like sulfuric, and not like you’d see from hard work.  These were recently damaged, and not very thorough.  It seemed… deliberate, so I asked Sherlock what would have done it.  He was helping me.   I also found traces of methamphetamine on the bodies, but not as though they’d been taking it.  More like they were making it.”
They paused and John raised up a bit to look at Sarah’s face.  Their eyes met, and there was a spark there, a mutual understanding.  They could both certainly see themselves ravishing each other- hot fast hard fucking.  Maybe that would happen later, but right now felt a little more passionate than that.  John had waited so long, he wanted to fuck her slowly, thoroughly, as if they were the only people left on earth, and the look on Sarah’s face told him she was thinking the same thing.
John stopped talking and his eyes grew large.
Lather.  Think of Margaret Thatcher.  Rinse.  Think of cricket.  Repeat.  Think of maths.  Anything to keep his mind off his wet, lanky flat mate under his hands.
“Right then.  Assuming he’s lucid when he awakes, we’ll be releasing him at about 3pm.  We’d have released him yesterday, but the anesthesia didn’t wear off as quickly as we’d hoped.  He woke a few times, and spoke, but didn’t remember anything afterwards.  It isn’t a worry, just a bit of an anomaly on his chart.”
“Really?  How do you feel about that?”
to bring us daily nearer God.
Holmes Manor? Semi-Formal? Black Lounge? John blinked slowly. He was sure these were all proper English words, but he was having a difficult time assigning meaning to them.
He stopped.  Red in the face with what he just let slip.
“What?  John?  John-in-jumpers, John with sick on him from the clinic, would-you-like-some-tea John?  Drunken, shouting John?”  Rhys’ green eyes flashed as he worked himself up.  “But what about… this?”  He waved his arms around.  “We haven’t even started yet.  We’re two of a kind, Sherlock.  We FIT.  We could play duets together forever.  Go on tour, see the world.  Together.  You can’t have that sort of extraordinary life with John.  What would you have?”
Tuesday came much too early, by John’s reckoning.  Yawning and stretching, he shambled downstairs to fix a cuppa, and noticed a large case on the floor in the parlor, and even more surprising- a lanky ginger asleep on the couch.  Rhys had come to visit.
“Belay that.  Operation Synchronous is now a go. Make the proper arrangements. That is all.”
The violin stopped, and a movement in the parlor caught John’s eye before he could open his letter.  Sherlock stepped up behind Rhys as he sat in a chair, and hooked his chin over the cellist’s shoulder.  He pointed out something on the sheet music with his bow, and both men laughed.  Rhys brought his hand up around the side of Sherlock’s head and patted him there, briefly.  Then Sherlock stepped back and both began to play again.
“You, yes, let me feel, ungh, harder…”
“Speaking of Sherlock, think he’s there yet?  It’s been over an hour.”
“Oi.  No.  I need to buy a song.”
Mike’s smile dimmed just a bit, but he recovered.
“You daft git.  I don’t need you to change.  I like you the way you are, though if you wanted to, you could wash the dishes more often.”  John smiled.  “My relationships haven’t been all that stellar either.  I’d hoped to fix that with Sarah, and if you hadn’t gone and gotten yourself kidnapped, I might have made a good show of it.”
“Molly.  Please.  We both know I was right about that.  Your work needs, DEMANDS a better song.  It will be the final piece.  The hypotenuse that completes the triangle of the performance.  My dancing, and, well, your architecture, require a song that will hold its own, or why bother at all?  You need something to withstand the passion.”
Sherlock looked down, and carefully touched the bruises, as if he couldn’t quite decide if they were real.  “I don’t remember.  I don’t know how this happened.”  His eyes met John’s in the mirror.  “John.  I DON’T REMEMBER.”  There was panic in his voice and lightning in his eyes.  He began to tremble.
John practically skipped down the stairs from his room that Wednesday evening.  He was grinning to himself and looking incredibly smug.
You heard them say it…
. I’ll do it. Call off your hounds and stop trying to ruin my reputation.”
Mycroft.  Mycroft is coming to take the drugs away.  No more clouds, no more rabbit fur.  Just umbrellas and spies and Mycroft.
John’s hands ran up to Sherlock’s hair, and his knees moved to bracket Sherlock’s slim hips.  He kissed like he was drowning and Sherlock’s breath was the only thing to save him.  His hips moved of their own accord, slowly back and forth across Sherlock’s lap.
Mmm.  Nope.  Not awake.  Talk to me some more, John.
“Take off your clothes, and get in the tub.”
Sherlock snorted.  “He’s had hangovers before, and if anything, he should be embarrassed about his behavior.  Honestly, he YELLED and recited bad movie poetry.”
He slowly ran his hands under the elastic of her hips, keeping his mouth on her stomach.  Might as well go all out, he tugged a little and she lifted her ass to make it easier.  Now she was completely naked, and he sat for a moment admiring her.  She was gorgeous.  His glance was interrupted by an outstretched arm tugging on him.
“It isn’t the religion.  It’s the building.”
Lestrade thought for a moment.  “Were these the bodies we brought in on Tuesday?  They were found dumped near Regent’s Park.  Didn’t seem to be much beyond a couple of OD’s.”
“Mols, call me back.  I think we’ve got the song you need.”
“You two had best stay in the car.  Mycroft- you’re too posh to be seen down here, and Greg- well, you’re too copper.  I’ve been down here before with Sherlock, so I should be ok.  If I’m not back in 20 minutes, come in after me.”  John stepped briskly from the car, hoping he would be recognized, hoping he could find someone to help.  “Oh- Mycroft.  Do you have a few fivers?  I’m nearly out, and will need to grease the skids.”
******************************
“Cor, Sherlock.  You gave me a fright.  Almost made me spill.  Now sit down since you’re in here, and eat up.”
“Greg?  What’s…”
After one swig, Sherlock grimaced.
John sighed, partly relieved that the stroppy part of Sherlock was feeling fine, but mostly saddened that he had been so abused.  He was also relieved to know that Sherlock obviously didn’t remember John’s… indiscretion from last night.  Only Mycroft and the staff did, and John could handle that.
“Ah Doctor Watson.  I’d hoped I’d see you here today.  We’d thought we’d send Mr. Holmes home tomorrow morning,  but ummm… Mr. M. Holmes reminded us that you’re a physician in your own right, as well as Mr. Holmes’ flat mate.  At this point, he really doesn’t need advanced medical care, but more monitoring and rest.  Would you be able to provide that?”
John groaned and fantasy took over…
John was suddenly shy.  He didn’t want to share his thoughts just yet, but he knew he had to, just to get some feedback.
“No you’re not.  He’s talked about you.  Here’s your change.”  The girl had been writing while John struggled with his introduction, and handed him the tattered paper.  He pressed the whole bundle of Mycroft’s money into her hand.  “Thank you” he whispered, and jogged back to the car, wondering about what she’d said.
“Greg.  Thanks for coming, Mate.  I need to get to the clinic and have a talk with Sarah.  This week has been right bollocks all the way around with her.  God knows if I even still have a job, I‘m pretty sure I don‘t still have a girlfriend.  You’ll be ok staying with Sherlock for a while?”
“Oh, all
***********************************
“Of course, it was. It was extraordinary. It was quite extraordinary.”
John sighed, and gathered his thoughts.  “Sherlock, I am happy.  YOU make me happy.  I’m just still… still trying to wrap my head around this.  I’ve never been with a man before, you know that.  And I want to be with you for as long as you’ll have me.  I’m just anxious about the physical part.  I don’t know that I want to… DO… all that.”  It seemed that stammering was contagious.  He couldn’t look at his partner.  He loved Sherlock, he knew that, but whenever he pictured more than kissing, he froze up.
“Hmmm?”  John was still too blissed out for a proper response.
By then, Sherlock couldn’t wait any longer.  He launched up the bed to cover John’s body with his own.  He angled his hips together with John’s so their cocks could touch.  “Oh Jesus, John.”  He pulled John’s hands out and away from his body, stretching them up so the two of them laid skin to skin from fingertips to toes.  They writhed against each other, no rhythm, no design, just feeling skin to skin, rubbing and feeling EVERYTHING.
“mmmm…fine. This is lovely.”
“I don’t really want water.”
Is when I'm alone with you
******************************
“No, I don’t need to.  It’s written all over you.  You hold your left shoulder and arm more stiffly than your right, you have marks on your fingers from guitar strings, but they’re too fresh to be there if you played often, but you’re here, so you’re the mysterious song writer.  Since the recording is rough, it’s you playing guitar in it, you’ve obviously played a lot in the past, but your fingers tell a different story.  So, former musician, you hold your arm awkwardly and have tender fingers- you had to stop playing because of something- probably an injury.  Something that would have stopped someone as passionate about music as you would have been traumatic, hence the therapist.  Now, passion.  This song is full of it, but it wasn’t about music it was about something deeply emotional, there is a lot of anger there.  It wells up and spills out, like you want to scream it, but you don’t want to share it.  Speaking about it with a therapist would have diluted the feelings, and they’re obviously still strong, so there you have it.  You’ve had a traumatic experience, stopped playing music, your therapist couldn’t get you to open up, but you’ve spilled your passion into a song.”
.”  John ground the words out through clenched teeth.  “The one that just left? He’s the good cop.”
When the nurse checked in hours later, she found the doctor and the detective curled together in the narrow bed.  She turned out the light, backed out, and called Mycroft.
As John heaved and moaned in the loo, Sherlock sat quietly, thinking back to his conversation with Lestrade earlier that morning.
Mummy watched John’s eyes widen, and smiled.  “Yes.  Now you see.  Sherlock had a difficult adolescence.  So eager to be loved, so ready to BE with someone.  I’m afraid he was often too eager and was terribly hurt and disappointed in the process.  It’s never easy, young love, and made even more difficult by being young ‘forbidden’ love.”  The phrase dripped off her tongue like poison.  “As if any love should be forbidden.”  She shook her head.  “But that’s an entirely different discussion, isn’t it?  One perhaps best left for Sherlock and Rhys.”
“Well that’s where you’re shit out of luck,
He sighed, and looked out the window.  Oh, Sherlock.  What did you do?
What the hell was that about?
*******************************************
"Piss off.”
“John, I am perfectly capable of bathing myself.”
She's the giggle at a funeral
They pulled back and looked at each other.  John was completely frozen, his eyes wide open, his jaw dropped.  Sherlock frowned and leaned in again, putting his hand gently on the back of John’s head.
Then there was Misha.  Baryshnikov was Sherlock’s first crush.   When he’d found a copy of “White Nights” in a store’s VCR bargain bin, he’d bought it and watched it so many times the tape finally snapped.  It was the first movie he bought when he got a DVD player.  He practiced ballet and told himself that someday, he’d meet Baryshnikov and they would be glorious together.  When they did meet, it was good, a mutual admiration, but Misha had retired by then, so dancing together was limited to a few steps and some hearty pats on the back.  It was… it was fine.
John quickly put down his tea and toast and made a dash for the bathroom.
“No idea whatsoever.  But I can’t stop.”
Mummy stopped and turned.  “Really, Dr. Watson?  Think…”
“If you don’t change your attitude, no ballerina in the world is going to want to dance with you.”
John grinned, knowing that once again, Sherlock had missed one key point with his initial deduction.
John giggled, a little drunk.
John shrugged and went down the stairs.
through sleep and darkness safely brought,
Sherlock started to speak but Lestrade waved him off, and then ran his hands through his silver hair, trying to find the right words.
As Rihanna sang, the rig over Sherlock’s head opened and water rained down, drenching him and the backup dancers.  He stood with his arms open and fists clenched, face to the rain and thighs quivering.
Sherlock’s sweaty head lifted, and he looked up.  His eyes were unfocused, he spoke slowly.
“Sherlock? The post is here.” (Bills, bills, advert, I may have won a cruise, Mr. Dean Smith? Who’s that? Oh- actual mail. One for me and one for Sherlock. Hmmm… nice envelopes. Hand calligraphy, wax seal. Very posh. Must be invitations.)
John snorted.
She crossed to him and smiled back, and they leaned gently in for a kiss.  A first, gentle, mouths closed, just testing.  John wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer, the second kiss was much different.
Eternal thanks to Ash_ for helping me with this one.
He took another drag on his half-smoked cigarette.  If the ballet director could see him smoking…  he grinned to himself.  Lestrade’s spiky silver hair would practically be vibrating with rage, his dark eyes flashing.  “Every time you smoke you take inches off your leaps.  The nicotine weighs you down!”
Sherlock's head bumped back against the headboard while John's lolled on the detective's shoulder.
Sherlock’s hospital room was surprisingly noisy for a quiet one.  The ding of the heart monitor, the hiss of the respirator, the hum of the IV pump.
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
***************************************************************
Mycroft sighed at hearing Sherlock’s gibberish.  He hoped John would stay asleep for a little while longer, it was imperative that he speak to Sherlock before the doctor got back.
******************************
“Oh that’s not all you do, John.  You ground him and you buoy him.  You’re good for him.  He’s such a delicate, romantic soul.  It’s good for him to have someone steady around.”
Mycroft finally broke the silence. “You owe me.  You placed a wager, lost, and I am here to collect.”
If the heavens ever did speak
He closed his door and sat on his bed.  His head ached with thinking.  He drank his tea and thought some more, then remembered his letter.
In the kitchen he put the kettle on and got out a clean mug.  He knew there was at least one mug of cold tea somewhere in the parlor, but he couldn’t be arsed to go get it.  As he waited for the kettle to boil, he looked around.  He spotted the big cream envelope on the sideboard, and saw that it had another photo in it.  Interesting.  Why was that one separate from the others?  He opened it and spilled out the photo, and the note.
“I’d like to…  John?  Are you happy?”
*************************************************
Mike pondered.
“I have to.”
At the theatre, John was pleased to see that Molly, Lestrade, and Angelo had also received tickets, and that their seats were excellent, front and center.  Catching a glimpse of Mycroft in one of the side boxes, he nodded and tipped his imaginary hat.  He received a smug grin in return.
And then Jones began to play…
Once the shirt was history, John pulled the dressing back from the surgical incision.  It looked like a stitch had popped, fortunately nothing serious.  He washed the area, and pulled out his stitch kit.  “This is going to hurt a bit, since I don’t have anything to numb the area.  I’m sorry to have to do this.”  He’d stitched Sherlock before without anesthesia, because Sherlock always refused it.  But this time was different.  John bit his lip and went to it, adding an extra stitch, just in case.
He could see her hands in his mind.  Long white fingers wrapped around him, strong palms, fingertips roughened by years against the violin strings.  Before he could register what he was seeing he came with a strangled cry and fell back against the pillows.
“Let’s put it on again, there are a few moves I’d like to try.”

“I know he’s a right arse.  But he knows what he’s talkin’ about.  If you want your show to be good, you’d best listen to him.”
“Give it a shot, think about it for a few days, for old times’ sake?”
Sherlock huffed from the sofa.
His voice trailed off, and he bit down on John's shoulder, not painfully, but enough to make John jump again.  "Sherlock... do that... harder oh God HARDER."
Get something shiny
He began to move his hand slowly up and down John's hard shaft.  John gasped and let his knees fall wider.  "Ohhh Sherlock.  That's good."  He rolled his hips in response.
**********************************************************
He moaned and rocked his hips slightly, enjoying the pressure on his rapidly stiffening cock.  Some days, if he awoke in this condition, he could doze off again with no problem.  Today was not one of those days, and he was actually ok with that.  He suspected he’d had torrid dreams about Mummy, even the thought of her this morning was enough to provoke another thrust into the mattress.
By 8:00, John was wondering if the concert was going to happen at all, and he was getting bored.  He’d tried everything on the buffet at least once, (Sherlock was right- he did like the caviar), he’d had a couple more flutes of champagne, and he’d chatted with half a dozen beautiful women.  Sadly, the only one who looked like a sure thing was Mummy, and he didn’t dare go near her alone again.  He didn’t trust himself, nor did he really trust her.  He hadn’t seen Sherlock in ages, and the only other people he knew here were Mycroft and Anthea.  The former was surrounded by young government types, the latter had erected her virtual walls and was seated on a divan near the front door.  John had no plans on interacting with either of them if he could avoid it.
John awoke, a little disoriented at first- strange bed, strange room.  Sarah was cuddled up behind him and he sighed, remembering.  The mini-break.  The Isle of Wight.  He snuggled back into the embrace and closed his eyes again.
John handed him a water bottle.
*******************************
Sherlock winced a little as the needle pierced the skin of his side.  It wasn’t so bad, getting another tattoo, but every once in a while, the needle glanced off a rib.  Eventually the pain would roll into a dull ache, and he could go back to his Mind Palace, but not yet.
The dancers gyrated while the lights flashed, and the crowd gasped.  John glanced up toward Mycroft’s box seat and was pleased to see a look of sour confusion on the Government’s face.
Sherlock put the photos down and listened for any movement in the flat.  Nothing from upstairs, nothing from his room.  He needed… he really needed John to make some tea.  He sighed.  He supposed he could make his own tea.
The two men bucked together, moaning and panting, gradually relaxing and slumping against one another.
On a side note, how are you guys feeling about a little Mystrade?  SarJohnLock?
Shit.  Was that last one out loud?  Did he care?  Not really, but he needed the job, so he hoped it wasn’t out loud.  The lady didn’t seem offended, so maybe it was just in his head.
Stunned, Sherlock jerked back.
new treasures still, of countless price,
“Wot?”  The single syllable sounded gruff, and Rhys cleared his throat and tried again.  “What’s going on, Sherlock?  Is something wrong?”
There was a Tesco bag on the uncomfortable chair, a note taped to it.  John picked it up and read.  “John- For when you awaken.  -MH”
“Mycroft tells me you were injured abroad.”  It was a question in the form of a statement.  Like the Holmes brothers, Mummy expected people to answer even the unasked.
“Ballet is… everything.  It’s all I’ve worked for my entire life, and it keeps missing my expectations.  I quit, you know.  I just couldn’t find the passion any more.  It became purely mechanical.  Was my foot arched just so?  Did my extension hold tightly enough?  Did my relevez have enough tension?  It became about checking off the boxes and going through the motions.  I was so bored.  Nothing ever excited me anymore.  Now I’m not dancing, and I’m still bored.”
“I don’t write songs anymore, Mike.  You know that.”
“Then it appears we are at an impasse.  Good day, Miss Hooper.  Call me if you find another song.”
John sat that night, and thought.  What would make him feel that way?  What made him feel the strongest emotions?  Harry, of course.  She was so happy, then so scared, and now so lost.  His heart broke for his sister, and how she was treated.
John was right there with him, and then some.
“No you don’t.  He’s a big boy, and he’s got Scotland Yard AND big brother British Government looking for him.  What are you going to do that they can’t?”
Now toast.  No butter, no jam, just toast.  And tea.  Very, very weak tea and dry toast.
The second must have been taken right after Sherlock pulled him away.  They were standing together, but John was turned away.  Sherlock was looking at him intently, and John remembered that brief flash of…  of what exactly?  Because from the photo it looked remarkably open, affectionate even.
Jaysus what did he drink?
restored to life and power and thought.
He raised his head and winked, at the same time pressing his hips against John’s legs.
John’s mouth moved to her nipple, his tongue slipping out to run a tight circle around it.  It was so stiff and inviting that he closed his mouth around it, sucking and pulling on it a bit as his hand found the other and began to rub and squeeze.  Sarah moaned and arched against him, her hands running through his hair as she rolled her head back and forth.
The only heaven I'll be sent to
John grinned out of one side of his mouth.
“How do you know that?  How do you know about my ‘thing’ and all that?  Have you been talking to Mike?”
Greg looked at Rhys with surprise.  “Fine.  I’ll drag him up myself.”
They found Molly in her office at St. Bart’s.  She nodded when they asked her about the fingertips.
John turned the phrases over in his head as he went up the staircase.  First step- left foot- I think Sherlock is right up Rhys’ alley.  Second step- right foot- Fair fucks to him.  Thirds step- left foot- I think Sherlock is right up Rhys’ alley.  Fourth step- right foot- fair fucks to him.  All the way up to his room.
Rhys stood, confused and ruffled, and uncharacteristically adorable.  “Sherlock, are you ok?  What’s going on?”  He tried to grasp Sherlock’s arm, but the detective twisted away.
Then, he was all the way inside.  He stopped and lowered himself down and wrapped his arms around her, pulling them together tightly.  Her arms and legs encircled him and they began to rock together, moving and swaying together slowly, pressing and grinding.  A slow dance, getting to know the feel of one another.
“That... was amazing.”
“And why did you sleep with me?”
“John?”  His eyes beseeched Mycroft, panic welling.
“You’re right, and you’re wrong.  Rhys was something  new and exciting, and it was exhilarating to play duets with him.  Yes, I touched him, yes I allowed him to touch me.  The music was our conduit.  But I did not sleep with him.  I wanted none of that.  Unfortunately, I found out this morning that he did, so I’m hoping that sending him away now was the kind thing to do.  It’s what you would have done, isn’t it?”
If he didn’t know any better, he’d have said he looked lustful.
He began to write.
He poured John into bed and went back to the parlor.  “Keep an eye on him if you remember.  He’s going to feel this tomorrow.”
He finished unzipping the dress and let it fall to the floor.  Mummy stepped delicately out of it, and turned to face him.  Instead of a bra, she wore a basque, that gorgeous long corset that displayed her breasts and whittled her waist.  Matching panties peeked out from behind garter straps, and nearly invisible stockings embraced her thighs.
Sherlock’s dancing became more sensual, more acrobatic as he undulated and snapped his hips. He knelt and splashed water, a few drops even reaching the front row where his friends sat, agog.  As the music ended, he flipped and landed on his back, sopping wet, chest heaving.
Mycroft pulled out his mobile and dialed.
“Fine.  Sofa it is then.”  John wrangled his gangly patient onto the sofa, and helped him remove his coat.  The original Belstaff had been ruined, but another had appeared in the hospital room.  Mycroft.
“This song.  It’s good.  That felt good, dancing like that.”
“Sherlock.  Open your eyes now.”
“It’s not just the hangover.  The man is heartbroken.  This
“Alright.  Fine.  I’ll call him.”
John nodded, steeling himself.  He was a doctor.  He was a doctor and he’d be providing care to a patient.  Nothing more.  He went to his room and got out of his clothes and into his dressing gown.  He kept his pants on.  By the time he made it back downstairs, he heard the shower running and heard Sherlock call.
John frowned at Sherlock’s back and beckoned to Mycroft. “The kettle’s just boiled, would you like a cuppa?”
John’s hand ran along Sarah’s side as they continued to kiss.  He was able to pay attention to everything- the touch and feel of her mouth, her scent, the feel of her body under his hand as it ran along her side.  He was pleased to find out his guess was correct- she had wonderful curves and he was enchanted.  He hoped she was feeling the same about him, but he was far too interested in HER to worry.  So long as he was allowed to explore and experience her, he was happy.
Mike pointed at what looked like a small wooden church, sitting in a field just outside town.  John couldn’t tell if it was being built or being torn down.  He liked it.  It looked comfortable, like it needed a little help, but could be (could have been?) beautiful.
She screwed her eyes shut and hissed her breath and inhaled, and he felt her brace her thigh muscles.  For a moment, there was nothing, then there was everything.  She released her breath with a cry and nearly bucked him off with the strength of her orgasm.  She continued to rub her pussy as she shattered against him, and he was still restrained from pounding as he wanted.  But she quickly moved her hand and grabbed at his hips.  “Harder, John.  Fuck me harder. Ungh…harder!”
“Right then.  Greg- the cold cases are on the desk by the window, Mycroft- check the kitchen for any experiments.  Last I knew it was something with acid and fingertips.  I’ll look in his room to start.”
This was all wrong.  It threw off his equilibrium and jumbled the discussion he’d already had with Sherlock in his head.  “Sherlock.  Did you make tea?”  It wasn’t the best opening for a conversation of this magnitude, but it was all he could think of to say.
“Not food shopping, you idiot. Clothes shopping. There is no way I’m letting you wear that dreadful brown suit to dear Mummy’s party.”
John’s eyebrow raised again, and Sherlock could see him swallow nervously.  “Trust me, John.  Please.”
John nodded and crawled to sit in between Sherlock’s legs.  He was painfully aware of his nudity compared to Sherlock and he swallowed again.
“What you need, Molly, is a song that tears you open.  That lets everything out, empties you, so that whatever is waiting to come in, can.  You’ve built this chapel, a symbol of hope, but it’s not finished.  It’s not complete.  You need a song that says that- and not in a ‘Woe is me’ kind of way, but in a ‘I am missing a vital part of myself and if I don’t find out what it is I’m going to die’ kind of way.  Your church is missing vital parts, and I can dance them, but you need to find the right song.”
Burp.  “Err-hiss.”
*****************************************************
“How did you know…?”  John shook his head.  “Nevermind.  I don’t want to know.”
Mycroft held the cup again as Sherlock drank.
“Hmmm?”
“Fine.
“John?”
“You think so?“
John was a little taken aback, but shook it off. Just one more oddity when associating with the Holmes brothers.
John gasped and closed his eyes.  When he opened them, he caught his tongue between his lips and looked at Sherlock, who smiled with wonder.  “There it is.  Oh God John.  I want to see that look all the time.  Every day.  I want you to look at me and melt me, and then build me up again.”  He punctuated his words with his hips, getting rougher and more erratic with each syllable.
John stopped laughing.
As they continued to kiss, their feet were moving, shifting them towards the bed as if a gravitational pull was exerting itself on their bodies.  Not really a fluid motion, though.  Their eagerness to reach the bed was equal to their reluctance to let go of one another and let the kiss end.  They kind of shuffled and spun their way the short distance across the floor until John felt his legs hit the side of the bed.  As soon as he did, he was able to break the kiss, and collapsed down onto it without letting Sarah go, pulling her with him.
. I’ll need an umbrella, I’m sure one of your “regular” ones will suffice.  I’ll take the
Molly and John stood in stunned silence outside.  They’d seen Sherlock dancing as they pulled up, and rather than interrupt him, they watched.
Sherlock put his head back down on John’s stomach.  “I think you’re going to have to close out Operation Bad Cop” he murmured.
“Do you trust me?”
Finally Sherlock stopped, his lungs burning with exertion, making his chest heave.
“Maybe, REALLY deep down.”
He looked at her laptop, the music program was up.  “Take Me to Church.”
Toothbrush and paste, a comb, a clean shirt, a magazine, and a gift card for the closest coffee shop.
He felt her hands scrabbling at his hips, pushing him away and he stopped.  She gasped “No- just… move!”  He backed up enough to let her slip a hand in between them.  She flattened her palm against her mound and slipped one finger down to touch herself.  Rolling her head back she let out a moan that shot straight to his cock.
Just as he was dropping off, his phone chimed.  “Goodnight. -SH”  John smiled.  This family.
“Oh!  Sorry, yes.  I actually have a recording of it- nothing fancy, but I could play it for you.”
“Greg.  Pub? –JW”
John got her point immediately, and shucked his pajama bottoms and pants, then laid down next to her again.  His hand was drawn back down her stomach to her pussy, and he began to slowly and softly rub along the outside, taking his time to get the feel of her.  At the same moment, her hand traveled in a similar direction, and he felt her fingers wrapping around his cock.
And now his therapist knew about it.
His kiss was light on John’s lips.  Soft and dry, just a press of warmth without heat.  Both kept their eyes open- John’s wide with surprise, Sherlock’s soft, like his kiss.
Molly began to sing:
“Sure.  Where/when?”
John nodded and sat in the chair next to the bed.  He told Sherlock about the bears, and the taxidermy revelation.  He filled in what he knew about Sherlock’s beatings from what Lestrade had told him.  He talked about how they’d gone to the taxidermy shop, then the boathouse, deliberately leaving out the ‘John-centric’ parts, even against Sherlock‘s wishes.  He told him about how they’d gotten him to the hospital.
John stood and grabbed his bath accoutrements, and when he turned, his eyes fell once again to the envelope.  In addition to the photos, there was a note:  “I had no idea.  I’m sorry.  –Vienne Holmes”
********************************************
“Terrible.  I can’t write anymore.  I don’t have anything to say anymore.  I especially don’t have anything to say that would let everything out, empty you, so that whatever is waiting to come in, can come in.”
“Sherlock!  You’re awake.  I can’t…”
John nodded.  “Tell the driver to go faster, Mycroft.  Get me home.”
Her hands dropped down John’s neck to his back.  She ran them up and down, and he could feel her pulling at the fabric of his shirt.  No matter what Sherlock said, he WAS a bright man, and could take a hint.  He raised a little, and allowed her to pull his shirt up as far as she could, then sat to remove it completely.  If she was going to start removing clothing though, so was he.  He pulled on her nightgown, and she immediately arched her back to allow him to pull it off.
John walked out of the clinic, shaking his head, trying to digest the conversation he’d just had.  He still had a job, thankfully, and still had a girlfriend, sort of.  He thought.  He wasn’t quite sure what Sarah was getting at, but she’d agreed to see him again, after Sherlock had healed.  There was a gleam in her eye as she smiled at him and shooed him out the door.
John dozed in yet another horrible chair, lulled by the sounds of the machines.  Greg and Mycroft found him there at dawn.
He heard Sherlock call, and went in to see him.
He got into the ambulance and it roared off.
After a moment of stroking, he moved his hand down to John's balls and coated them with lube as well.  He wanted desperately to explore further back, to feel John from the inside as well as the outside, but he couldn't reach without disturbing the position, and he didn't want to break the spell.  There would be time, he hoped.  But for now...
All in all, though, Operation Bad Cop was a qualified success.  It had been months since John saw the desperation in Sherlock’s eyes, the shake in his hands.  He wasn’t sunshine and lollipops, although John did keep the flat stocked with snacks, including pretzel sticks and lollipops, to assuage Sherlock’s oral fixation, but he wasn’t crazed, and John began to breathe a little easier.
Sherlock continued to writhe as he came completely silently, his eyes wide open and trained on John’s face.
John knew exactly how he liked to be touched, and very much liked touching himself.  He was his own private playground, and he was never bored.  His hands stroked gently down his sides, then back up the opposite arms, he especially liked to feel fingernails scrape gently up the insides of his forearms.  Then across his chest, carefully avoiding his already erect nipples.  His right hand snaked up to his throat, his left trailed down his abs to his navel, following the dark blond trail of hair until his fingers reached the base of his cock, but he didn’t touch.
Only then I am human
Turns out Mike had moved up in the business.
Wait.
When he was done, Sherlock was sweating and panting again.  It took all John’s willpower not to take the detective in his arms and rock him to sleep.  Instead he pressed his hand to the dark curls and said very softly “I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”  He inhaled deeply and bit off what he almost said.  I’m sorry I wasn’t there with you.  I’m sorry I didn’t stay.  I’m sorry I let you down.
John groaned and Sherlock pulled him closer and they toppled backwards along the length of the couch.  “I sent him away because he ISN’T you.  I sent him away because I don’t want him like that.  I want YOU like that, if you’ll have me,” he mouthed into John’s hair and stroked John’s back.
Once Sherlock was fully ensconced in his bed, stuffed with more soup and painkillers, John felt he could breathe again.  He felt as though he’d dodged a bullet in the shower, he was able to get himself under control before Sherlock SAW.  He shook his head.  WHAT THE HELL.
Awkward.  This was… awkward.  John steeled himself.  He could do this.  He liked Sarah, he really did.  She was smart and funny, and he suspected that she had a smoking hot body hidden behind the matronly blouses and long skirts.  His initial attempts to feel her up had gone badly, but he had gotten a cursory touch.
“Anthea dear, Operation Welcher is a go. Repeat....”
“I don’t want to see my flat mate become another one of my mother’s conquests.”  Sherlock hissed.  “It’s bad enough we’re going to have to endure this recital by her latest peccadillo, I couldn’t bear the thought of you two…”  He didn’t finish his sentence, but John’s eyes widened anyway.
“Rhys, I…”  he gulped.  He hated this part.  Rhys was a good man, and he was so much like Sherlock.  They were comfortable together, and in another time or place, they’d have been comfortable together for a very long time.  But now… now Sherlock had the chance of John, and even a chance was worth the attempt.
Sherlock groaned and nodded.  Days of torture, plus days of hospitalization had left him fairly rank, even though the nurses had cleaned him up some.  He could barely stand himself.
“Sherlock- you are a grown man, genius and innovative.  If there’s not a case, you can call Lestrade and ask for a cold case.  You can call Molly and ask for a corpse.  You can lay about and think about the universe, I don’t know.  But I am positive that you can survive on your own for 48 hours.  You did it the entire time before I showed up, I know you can do it now.  I am going to Wight with Sarah and I am going to GET BLOODY LAID.  Now.  Do you want curry?”
******************************
When those avenues ran dry, John resorted to contingency plans.  Museums, art galleries, concerts.  These were trickier, he had to approach Sherlock in just the right manner or the detective would get suspicious.
While she dozed, he washed his face and grinned at himself in the mirror.  Cocky, yes, but it ain’t boasting if you can back it up.  God he loved sex and pleasuring people.  Almost as much as he liked getting off himself.  He was fine with her sleeping.  For now.  Tomorrow morning though….  He grinned again, went back into the room and crawled into bed.
“John?  John Watson?”
Especially if it meant getting Sherlock OUT.
Free time.  Indeed- he hadn’t had much free time at all since moving into 221B.  Sherlock kept him running ragged with cases and random texts at all times of the day or night.
He was on his mobile before the door even closed behind him.  “Greg?  Yeah mate.  I’ll be on the next ferry and then the next train after that.   Should be back in London in 2 hours- have someone pick me up at the station?  Ta.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and grabbed the towel.  He got onto the bed, still in his pants, and sat against the headboard, his legs spread wide.
John pushed backwards, and pulled down his jeans, taking his pants down as well.  He grabbed the thin material of Sherlock’s tights and pulled.
“Jesus Sherlock!  You can’t just…”
Offer me that deathless death
“So these bodies were made to look like OD’s, but weren’t.  They were also stripped of their fingerprints, so chances are the Yard has them in their database somewhere.  The damage was done with acid usually used in taxidermy, and they appear to have been manufacturing meth.  Sounds interesting to me… I bet it was even more interesting to Sherlock.”  John scratched his head.  “Why Vauxhall Arches?  What would his homeless network know?”
“John, you know that people- “
When Molly left, the two men sat in silence for a bit.
“You should care, Sherlock.  No partners means no career.”
This was different.  Usually he was just a cashier, nobody read his nametag, and nobody for sure ever called him by his full name.
“I didn’t know you were religious.”
************************************
“Good afternoon, John. Sherlock.” Mycroft Holmes waited at the threshold for someone to invite him in. “Ah,” thought John, “a social visit.” If it had been business, Mycroft would have abandoned all niceties and made himself quite comfortable in Sherlock’s armchair without wasting a moment.
“It’s been two weeks.  I think I’m healed up by now.”  He reached down and stroked John’s hair.
John had to shake himself back to reality.  He was a doctor.  He was helping a patient, nothing more.  He poured shampoo into his palm and reached up to wash the sopping curls.
“Ballet?  Mate, you’ve gone off.  You don’t seem the type to go in for all that.”
As he pondered his options over a fresh cup of tea, he heard steps on the stairs, and a knock at the open parlor door.
Molly blushed and looked at John through her lashes, clearly pleased with his praise, but shy.
Dinner was simple, some cheeses, crackers, wine and fruit they’d picked up at the market.  Neither of them was eager to interact with a whole lot of people, and both were eager to get back to the room.
He leaped and ran, flying to each corner of the church like he was trying to escape, only to be held back by some unseen force.
“Think about what you’ll be presenting, Sherlock, and remember that I have final approval.”
Sherlock felt John relax more, and spread his fingers out through John’s short hair.  John made a happy noise in the back of his throat, but suddenly tensed and pulled back.
“It’s bad, Doctor.  He’s lost a lot of blood, it appears he has at least one broken rib on each side.  Contusions everywhere.  With the knot on his head I’d say he has a concussion, his eye response bears that out.  He has a possible broken ankle, and by the swelling in his abdomen, there’s possible internal bleeding as well.  He’s surely taken a beating.”
John ventured out of the kitchen. “Operation Synchronous? What has Mycroft gotten us into now?”
Sherlock acquiesced to allowing Mycroft send a car for them on the day of the recital. Neither he nor John had a vehicle, and he refused to take public transportation from London to Sussex. Since the alternative was renting a car, and Mycroft had cancelled his credit card after receiving word of the duo’s shopping spree, the black limousine was the most logical option. The only drawback was that they had to share the space with Anthea, who, after giving them both uncharacteristic appraising looks, immediately went back to tapping at her mobile. Even though she was quiet, her very presence rankled him, and Sherlock tapped angrily at his own phone.
The team was wrapping up at the boathouse, and Sherlock was in the ambulance.
“Molly mentioned earlier that there’s beer in the mini fridge, let’s have those instead.”
He staggered upright and ran the flannel over his face a few times.  He swished some water in his mouth and spit, then drank the rest slowly.  Anything to put off facing Sherlock, and having to leave his home.  He sighed.
John felt… bad.  He felt so bad he couldn’t even come up with a word bad enough to describe how bad he felt.  He lay on his bed and very carefully catalogued himself.  Muscles, sore.  Stomach, queasy.  Head, POUNDING.  Mouth… something died in his mouth.  When he felt alive again he’d kill Sherlock for experimenting on him.  That had to be the reason for feeling this monumentally shitty.  Oh!  He came up with a better word.
‘Must I remind you that our Prince here, as well as yourself, have had more women than you could fit into this castle?’ Mike smiled, raising an eyebrow.
The trail brought Sherlock to the barrier. They were joined by three other swans, including Pierre and Friedrich (‘The Dancer’), by then. What they found was blood and bloodied feathers on the ground with some pieces of bone and other few remains. Sherlock approached them to at least try to find out if both sisters had fallen prey to the hounds or there was a chance that one of them had survived. Others were too shocked to move, someone cried out in terror. There were hushed, shocked murmurs behind him, but Sherlock ignored them, until someone called. ‘I’ve found her!’. Sherlock turned to see what was going on. Even from his position he could see a juvenile swan sitting on the ground near a tree, alive, but seemingly unresponsive, like a statue. He couldn’t tell if she was injured or not, but she was alive and, very likely, in a safe zone that hounds couldn’t enter. He was too far away to tell which one of the twins it was. He turned to what was left of another one. There was nothing for him to do here now, since it was perfectly clear what had happened and he didn’t think others needed any gruesome details he could provide now that they had all the answers they needed.
Mycroft took off his embroidered velvet beret and held it close to his chest, still facing the lake. Sherlock was suddenly chilled to the bone by the gesture. What was that?! Was Mycroft mourning him? But he was alive! Sherlock slightly raised his wings helplessly. He then bit Mycroft’s calf, which earned him a glare, as Mycroft finally turned his face to him. The older man’s expression softened, though.
Sherlock also told the boy that swans required a lot of food. Despite being herbivores, the real swans often ended up eating mussels, water beetles, small fish, as well as fish eggs, usually by mistake, from Sherlock’s observations. But some of those were more nutritious than just eating a lot of plant matter, so he, personally, sought out the aforementioned, more nutritious, food on purpose to avoid spending so much time eating (he’d never been a fan of wasting time like that, even though he didn’t have many other things to do as a swan), but, of course, those things had to be consumed without forgetting to eat things that were more habitual for a swan’s digestion. Eating was boring, but, with the metabolism of fowl, it was something that had to be done quite a lot, together with drinking fresh water in abundance. Archie listened to him carefully and Sherlock had no doubt that the boy memorised everything he was being told.
"Did you have any contact with him after ten?"
"When not working, Taz played rugby with local team The Half-Wednesday. He was passionate about sport and helped to found the Rainbow League, an LGBT, coed rugby league consisting of five teams in Sheffield, York and Manchester counties. Taz also volunteered with at-risk gay youth at the Sheffield Pride Center, helping teens estranged from their families. "I've been lucky," Taz said. "My family stuck by me, loved me even when the neighbors told them they'd be better off shot of me. Because that's what families are made to do – to love their children. Unconditionally. I want these boys and girls to know that even though their parents have failed them, they're still worthy of love."
“Then we have to act! Where is he!?” I’d get on a plane tonight – go get him myself!
“Dr. John Watson... aren’t you....” Vic was interrupted by Sherlock’s entrance.
"Yes, it's time to visit Mr. Bruno." Moran smirked at John then turned and left the room.
“I’m just saying, don’t judge them.”
Sherlock looked at his hand almost surprised to see the cigarette there. “I don’t know. Here.” He gestured at the room.
"Yes."
“It’s a lot, I know.” Anwen said to me with a rueful smile. “I have a pied-à-terre in London that’s so much more practical. The upkeep on this place is insane.”
John walked, the chill air a welcome distraction from his shame.
“Don’t you dare!”
"You must have some feelings..."
"You already know – you read it."
"Diabolical."
I ran after him, Mary falling from my mind entirely, supplanted by panic. “What’s happened?!” I cried. “Mycroft!” I followed him out of the pub and into the black car that idled at the curb. It started to move before I’d got the door shut. “Is Sherlock ok?! Mycroft! Tell me!”
It was frustrating.
I’m thirty-five years old and I finally hit puberty in all its hormonal agony. I couldn’t bear it and I couldn’t bear for YOU to see it. I wasted a few months on heroin. I’m not proud of it, but there’s nothing better for running away from problems – or perceived problems. Heroin led eventually to rehab where I was finally forced to confront the fact that I love you, John, and I desire you.
It was time. I swung around into the doorway, kicking the door all the way open (to be certain no one lurked behind it), my gun raised. I stood in a small front hall opening into a sunwashed lounge. Dust motes danced in the bright air. If a gun was pointed at me, I couldn’t see it. I cleared the front hall in two steps and again flashed my gun – if he was around the corner, I hoped it would draw his fire. It didn’t. I swung myself around the corner, gun first and found myself in the lounge facing an open kitchen with an island separating the rooms. I carefully surveyed the room. The lounge had been divided into a study area and a sitting room with an enormous (and singularly hideous) black leather couch. A large black desk cluttered with mail, magazines, charging cords and other ephemera dominated the side of the room behind it. A coffee table had been shoved against the couch, the detritus on it spilling onto the floor. A low console holding an overly large television and set of speakers sat against the near wall, positioned so that one could lie on the couch and watch. I silently walked backwards, checking that no one was hiding behind the couch, under the desk or by the single upholstered chair. It was deserted but for the stale smell of cigarettes.
Sherlock had not been in this room – formerly his own bedroom – with John since the night they'd spent together, since they'd woken together in the morning sunlight and fucked... their sweaty skin pressed together... John's hands gripping his hips, his big cock stretching him... it had been painful at first but Sherlock had tried to hide the pain... then suddenly it felt amazing, better than he'd imagined, and he couldn't hide that. It turned him into an animal, cursing and begging John for more. It transported him to a place he'd never been – that he desperately wanted to revisit. Being there now, almost naked, with John, was making him feel giddy.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You should go home." Sherlock told him blandly. "Get some sleep."
-----
John saw them out. He could hear Sherlock on the phone upstairs. Had he rung Lestrade? John ran up the stairs two at a time.
“I know.” I said. “Tomorrow.”
, a life past their early twenties, a family of their own… was staggering.
Sherlock heard voices in the hallway. He closed the cabinets and chose a chair close to the fireplace.
"You won't leave him?"
A cool breeze. That was wrong, we were deep in the prison, in the warmest part. It blew again, moving the fringe on my forehead. There was a lot of motion around me.
"Who are you?" The nurse's accent was northern.
John surfed channels while I drank the soup, finally settling on a nature documentary about dung beetles that was mildly interesting.
Another chapter is in the works! I’ll post as soon as it’s finished.
She nodded. He listed off the numbers from memory and she held the phone to his ear. Shane felt ill – the seriousness of John's injuries hitting him in the gut. He fought down the panic again as John spoke tersely into Dusette's phone.
"Hrmph." John didn't like that. He stood up abruptly and picked up his plate. He reached for the empty wine glass with his left and knocked it over with the hook. It rolled off the table and smashed on the floor. "Goddammit!" He'd forgotten he didn't have a left hand, he'd just reached out for the glass.
I doubted that.
John grabbed a fistful of damp, wavy hair and pulled Shane closer. “You do have something you could hold against me.” He murmured, pressing his thigh against Shane’s crotch. He smiled into the kiss as he felt Shane harden.
“Well....” I said slowly, draining my glass and signaling for another. “After I was shot, I got sick. I was pretty out of it for a long time. I ended up discharged – invalided. I was still weak, still recovering... it was a shock, going from a war zone where I was needed, where I was a surgeon... to London where I had nothing. I sustained some nerve damage from the injury that meant I couldn’t perform surgery any more. I wasn’t a doctor. I wasn’t a soldier. I wasn’t needed. I’m not complaining, I’m just trying to explain how it was.” Mary put a sympathetic hand on my arm. “I was trying to reconcile myself to this new life in which nothing ever happened. I was depressed. Obviously.”
Shane leaned down and kissed John. "Because I love you, John. And you love him." Shane smiled wearily. "And he saved my life and I REALLY don't want to owe that prick anything."
Easy for him to say, John thought. He had two hands.
“Girls...” John chided. “Go on, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock... don’t be daft, of course I love you. Weren’t you listening before?”
Nazer turned to Hulk’s table and with three quiet words, shut them up. Muttering, they turned their backs on me.
"No, sir. Only that Sherlock Holmes had done it. No use going after him for it since he killed himself right after."
“What could I possibly do?”
“Either way, John fits the profile.” Shane said. “Young, physically fit, recovering well.”
"You've spent a lot of time in this hospital." Sherlock observed as they ate.
“Bruises. This girl had bruises on her shoulders… but if they’ve been in heat, shouldn’t they have bruises on their hips? You
I wanted him! I unfastened his jeans and pushed them down his hips. His cock sprang free – it was gorgeous! Thick and pink and already emerging from its foreskin, the glans wet and weeping with lust. John's bollocks hung low, but they were tightening up under his shaft in his nest of neatly trimmed curls. Like many gingers, his body hair was even redder than the hair on his head, and it glinted brightly in the light.
Shane laughed at Sherlock's fussing. "Are you saying I need a psychiatrist more than you? No, I'm joking. You'll have to ask Bob why he wants you at John's session – maybe he's a fan. Maybe he wants to see for himself that you're alive."
"I have to go... somewhere else."
"Then I'LL do it!"
The Omegas loved Virginia. Most of them had never seen an Omega older than 22 – their families weren't affluent and they had all been born to Beta dams – so the mid-thirties Omega was a revelation.
“Leave him alone.” Sherlock. John hadn’t heard him come in. He imagined the resentful looks they would be exchanging and felt exhausted by it.
And Shane had known. Shane knew him – knew that John was drawn to Sherlock, that John wanted him. And despite their short acquaintance, Shane could see Sherlock clearly as well. He could see that Sherlock would take whatever John gave and want more. He could see Sherlock's restless insatiability, his desire to consume everything that was John. And he could see that John wanted it as much as he feared it.
Angus' wolfish smile made John uncomfortable. "Now and again." He said. "I'm curious – I haven't seen anything official about Sherlock 'rising from the dead' or anything. I'm surprised the papers aren't interested."
“It sucks here!” Harry moaned.
He shoved that thought away hard — it was inappropriate at the best of times and it was downright criminal now.
“You don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to tell me that you love me. You don’t have to be nice and polite and accommodating. You don’t have to choose between Sherlock and me. All you have to do is heal.”
“I have lice.” I told him.
I glanced at Sherlock. “What’s the plan? We knock on the door and see who answers?”
“We all have to eat. Sit.”
**I’m so fucking turned on right now. Had to button my lab coat to avoid offending the patients**
"I just meant... I've never done this before."
When he felt Mycroft relax, he pressed in farther frigging back and forth. Mycroft’s approval was vocal, and he rocked against Lestrade’s hand. He jacked Mycroft’s cock rhythmically, and slowly introduced a second finger. Mycroft opened for him, digging his heels into the bed and fucking himself greedily. Lestrade bent his fingers and ghosted them over the sensitive, walnut-shaped bundle and Mycroft, taut with pleasure, sang out.
“You’re eating.” John said. “You didn’t eat your banana this morning.” He started toast in the toaster and opened a can of beans to heat. He put the kettle on for tea and by the time it was ready, his Omega was in the kitchen poking at the beans.
Instead I made small talk, answered questions about Afghanistan, attempted to interpret Seb’s rapid-fire rhyming slang, and endured Cam giving a toast. “To Mary’s hero, we cannot express how grateful we are to you, John.”
“John…”  Mycroft’s voice was uncharacteristically soft.  “Do you know what you’re getting into?”
My lover's got humour
“Oi.  ‘ere to get the bloody great Sherlock Holmes are you?”
Sherlock continued his gentle explorations of John’s torso.  He’d seen it before, but never in this manner, and he’d never touched it.  So different than his own slender, pale frame, John’s chest was still stocky from enlistment, skin still golden from exposure to the Afghan sun.  The scar stood out angrily, and Sherlock ghosted his fingers over it, curious to know more, but aware that this wasn’t the time to probe.  “Exquisite.  No, that sounds fragile.  You’re striking, you’re fascinating, you’re wonderful and so sexy.  I can’t find the right words…”
“Oh, I think this one is right up your alley.  Remember that performance art ballet gig I told you about?  They’re lookin’ for a song that, get this, lets everythin’ out, empties you, so that whatever is waitin’ to come in, can.  You’ve been through some right shite, I figure you’ve got some stuff that needs emptyin’.  What do you say?”
Sarah came back into the room, backlit from the bathroom light, head down, almost bashful.  She looked… she took John’s breath away.  White cotton nightgown, nothing overtly sexy, nothing alluring, but at that moment she was the most sexy, most alluring woman John had ever seen and he beamed.
“Shhh!  People will hear you!”
John nodded, nearly asleep.  He felt Sherlock’s lips on his forehead and smiled.
His phone dinged.  “Both Lestrade AND Mycroft? Haven’t I been tortured enough this week? -SH”
There was one place left.  John sighed and handed Sherlock the flannel.  “I’ll hold you under your arms, you get… yourself.”
The mousy girl cocked her head and looked at him.  “Who wants to give him change?”
As they approached the ballroom, John managed to plant his feet and pull them to a stop.  “Sherlock!  What is going on with you?  It was harmless.  Certainly- your mother is a stunning woman, but I would never…”
He paused, looking at her marvelous tits.  His mouth watered a bit as he lowered it to her and began lavishing attention- kissing and licking his way around, intentionally bypassing her nipples for now.  He raised one hand and began squeezing and rubbing the breast not covered with his kisses, but ignoring the nipple there as well.  After a moment, he switched, moving his lips across her, slowly and deliberately.
“I’m going to make you some soup, and you’re going to eat it.  Soon it’ll be time for your next round of meds, so you’ll need something in your stomach.”  John hung the coat on the hook and made his way into the kitchen.
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Lestrade nodded and gave John a sympathetic look.  “Sorry, good luck with your talk.”
John gasped and moved his hips, his cock now almost fully hard.  Sherlock leaned into his neck and tasted… tasted the skin behind John’s ear, down his neck, across his shoulder.  Just tasting.  John writhed some more and Sherlock breathed into his ear again.  “Mmmm… you.  You taste good.  Like tea and gunpowder and salt.  I want to taste you everywhere.”
Sherlock glanced at the drunken duo and shook his head.  Evidently he was in one of his silent modes tonight.
He got out his phone.  “Where are you?  I’d like to go home.”
Another flash and bang of lightning, and that seemed to signal the right moment as she put him into position and let go.  God how he wanted to just slam inside her, but he held back, moving slowly, allowing each of them to feel every inch as he slipped inside.  He pushed in, momentarily overwhelmed by the sensation, but still able to control himself and the pace.
Mummy pushed him back on the bed, toward the lavish headboard.  Reality of the morning and dreams of the previous night were merging.
The music faded, and Sherlock dropped his forehead to John’s, their chests touching.  Before he could lose his nerve, John cupped Sherlock’s cheek and kissed him gently.
Dinner at the Fisherman’s Cottage was exactly the right way to start the weekend, as far as John was concerned.  Small and rustic, just romantic enough to hint, but not too much.  He hadn’t gotten very far with Sarah, and didn’t want to scare her off.  He grinned at the thought though- she’d proven to be much tougher than most, on their disastrous first date to the Chinese circus.  Kidnapping, attempted murder, police involvement.  Sometimes John wondered why she agreed to see him again and again.
John laughed.
He turned and put on the music again.
Somedays John wished he hadn’t.  The physical therapy drained him, the mental therapy drained him, he couldn’t play his guitar for months because he couldn’t move right, the band replaced him.   He took a job at a pharmacy to pay the bills, stocking shelves and ringing up customers.
She reached for him, pulling off his tie and unbuttoning his shirt.  When it was open, she ran her hands over his chest and pulled at his nipples.  When she was sure she had his attention, she leaned in for a kiss, and John was lost.  He loved to kiss, and was told he was good at it, but he had nothing on Mummy.  She teased his lips open with her dainty tongue, and instead of diving in and jousting with his, she began to slowly kitten lick the inside of his lips, never stopping, never avoiding his tongue, but never engaging it either.  It was delirious.  He held her by her shoulders, afraid to do much else, while she drove him mad.  He felt her push gently on his chest, not separating the two of them, but guiding him back toward the bed.  He sat down on it with a whimper, having lost the connection.
John knew that first night, when Sherlock’s hand shook as he held the cabbie’s pill to the light.  He couldn’t see the detective’s face, but he imagined it countless times since.  Pupils wide, lips parted, tongue just tipping his teeth.  John imagined that’s what Sherlock would look like on the edge of lust, and wondered if he’d ever shown that look to another person.
John was never one to disobey an order, and lost himself between her thighs.  He moved his hands to the front of her shoulders and pushed her torso against the bed, even as her legs wrapped around his hips.   It didn’t take long and he was stuttering against her, coming deep inside as he grunted and moaned.  The flashes of lightning illuminated them both- open mouthed, eyes screwed shut, lost in their own private storm as Mother Nature’s raged outside.
He felt her start to jerk and began to push a little harder, feeling his balls slap against her even as they tightened with impending orgasm.  Her breath came faster and oh the noises!  He heard her moan, and whine, and gasp as she thrust against him, and he heard the wet slide of cock against pussy.  Skin against skin, hot and sweaty and perfect.
John clenched his left hand briefly.
She moved one finger down, behind his scrotum and teased the flesh there, drawing a sharp exhale from him.  With a wink, she put that finger in her mouth to wet it, and returned it to his crotch, this time lower, deeper, dirtier.  John’s head rolled back with the thought of oh so proper Mummy Holmes fingering his ass and his hips pushed against the air.  He mimicked Fantasy-Mummy’s actions, running his own wet finger against his hole.  When she pressed into him, so did he.  When she fucked his ass, so did he.  When she moved her other hand from his balls to grasp his shaft, so did he.
“Let’s put the song on the good speakers- we can hook it up, and then go get a cuppa.  Sherlock will be a while, he takes forever to get ready, such a Prima Donna.”
The shower was good.  It took a few minutes to get there, and a few more minutes standing in front of the toilet while he debated having his own sick-up, but the shower was good.  When John emerged, he felt almost human.
Ella smiled and nodded.
After a brief moment’s silence, the auditorium erupted in a roar.  The emcee tried to corral the proceedings, but the hooting, screaming, clapping, and whistling went on for several minutes as Sherlock and the dancers stood smiling and dripping onstage.  The noise drove the meter off the charts, with nobody sure of exactly how much money was raised from Sherlock’s blockbuster performance.
His face turned pale and Sarah looked on anxiously.
He could see John flush at his praise, and more interestingly- could see John’s cock twitch.
“You sent him away because of me?  Because of what I did last night?  I’m so sorry, Sherlock, I don’t know what I said or…”
As they drove toward New Scotland Yard, the pair filled John in on what they knew.
Sherlock turned away and washed.
John rolled his eyes so hard he may have actually seen his own brain stem.  “Great.  Just bloody great.”
“OK?”  “Ok.”
Sherlock raised his head and licked John’s lips.  John thought of his Mummy fantasy briefly, and wondered if he was prescient.  Sherlock was licking him exactly the way he’d imagined Mummy would, exactly the way John needed.  Then the thought faded away and John fell into the kiss.
A fresh poison each week
But that all came crashing down one night after a show.  Out in the alley behind the bar, stopping a guy from beating his girlfriend, how was he to know the guy had a knife?  He was lucky, “only” stabbed in his shoulder.  Extensive blood loss, severe muscle damage, even a chipped collarbone, but he lived.
“Sherlock!  This is nice… romantic.  I didn’t know you had it in you.”
Most of the guests had left, the ones who remained already retired to their rooms in various wings of the Manor.  Only John, Sherlock, Mummy and Rhys remained in the library.  Jensen had banked the fire, and the quartet lounged in leather wing chairs in front of it.  A decanter of brandy sat on a tray, ready to refill any empty snifters.  The conversation wound around, where did you attend school?  How long have you been playing?  What’s your favorite piece?  John listened but did not contribute, content to bask in the glow of the three glorious creatures in front of him.  He could get used to this, he thought.  Surrounded by beauty for all the senses- beautiful music for his ears, beautiful brandy to taste, beautiful clothing to touch, beautiful people to watch.  But beautiful scent?  What was that?
Both men stood, wide eyed and stunned at the revelation.
“Sarah.  I have to go back to London.  Now. Sherlock’s disappeared.”
“And Mycroft.  Don’t forget Mycroft.  Sodding Mycroft Sodding I Run The British Empire And Look In Your Sock Drawer Holmes.”
Mycroft stopped in and tried to get John to go home.  “There’s nothing you can do here, he’ll be unconscious when he gets out of surgery, and the medical team here can take care of him.  If you wanted, we could helicopter you back to Wight and you could finish your mini-break with Dr. Sawyer.”
Molly nodded, then put her head in her hands with a sigh.
.  John, not really a fan of musical theatre, was nevertheless impressed with the dancing and costuming, and applauded enthusiastically.  Parts of the audience hooted and stood, driving LAMDA’s donation up to £13,400.  When the noise died down, the emcee informed the crowd that one of LAMDA’s illustrious alumni was not only donating the entire amount the team raised but was also making a matching donation to the school. “Not a
They never spoke about it, and some days were better than others, but John knew.
“Alright.  You’ve opened up your incision.  I’ll see if I can patch it up, if not, we’re back to the hospital.  Stay here and be quiet.”  He went into the bathroom, washed his hands, and brought out his med kit.  On his return to the sitting room, he knelt by the sofa.  “I’m going to have to take your shirt off, can you sit up a bit?”
He held out a hand, and John took it, but not before grabbing the water and the meds.  He wasn’t going to let Sherlock weasel out of taking them.
John gave up trying to wrest more information out of Sherlock, the detective had dived dramatically into a sulk and refused to acknowledge the doctor’s questions.
has thrown him for a loop!  I don’t know how else to put it, because I don’t know how much of it he actually sees it himself.  But Sherlock, if you two don’t pull your heads out of your own arses and realize that you’re mad for each other, you’ll both lose it all.  And then what will you do?”
After several minutes, they pulled apart, gasping.  “I take that as a yes?” Sherlock grinned.
**********************************
He gripped John's cock a little tighter, and reached for the lube with his free hand.  He popped it open and spread some on his hand and John's shaft, smiling at the gasp John let out.
“Ahem, well, I’ve gotta dash, Mols- can you get John back to town?”
“You.  You wrote this.  You had some personal…” He waved his hand weakly “…thing happen, and your therapist couldn’t get you to discuss it, but you could write about it in a song.  Interesting.”
John fished his laptop out of his bag, set it up, and hit PLAY.
He laughed.  The text told him two things- first- that Sherlock was feeling better, and second- that there was NO way he was going back to the flat just yet.   Pub first.
Sherlock got up and pulled John up after him.  Once they were both standing, he walked John to the center of the room.
John raised an eyebrow at the familiar phrasing.  Did all Holmes family members have that weird telepathy thing going on?
Wait.  Dressing gown.  Sherlock’s arse.
John’s smile faded and he sighed again.  He clenched his jaw and swallowed again.  Instead of looking at the ceiling, he looked at his hands as he spoke quietly.  “I was holding your hands, talking to you.  Telling you how confused I was, and how tired, and how I didn’t know what to do.  You woke up and told me to get in bed and sleep, that we’d talk later.”  He looked up at Sherlock.  “Guess we finally got to that part, eh?”
*****************************************
He grinned.
“When do you get through?  Let’s go have a pint.”
Lestrade was feeling his pints by now.
John’s head lolled back against Sherlock’s shoulder, and he squirmed gently, his cock at full attention.
John didn’t let him finish.
Once down in the reeking arches, John looked for anyone familiar.  A tall, pale, dark haired detective would be the best, but he’d settle for the mousy woman in the dingy parka they’d once talked to.  It took about 10 minutes, but he found her, back against the wall as she sat warming her hands by a fire kindled in a can.
And with that, Mycroft swept down the stairs so quickly, so quietly, John was left to wonder if he’d actually even been there.
He hobbled off on his crutches toward the bathroom.  “I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
That must have been what Sherlock was waiting for, because he began to run his hands over John’s arms and chest.  Gently, not much more than brushing his fingertips over John’s skin.  John’s eyes opened and his breathing quickened.  Sherlock continued the gentle touches until John relaxed again.
Ohhhh.  Drugs.  Someone’s given him drugs.  Didn’t they know?  They must have known.  Lovely people.  They knew just what he craved and gave it to him.  Was it Christmas?  His birthday?  It must be.  It must have been John.  John knows.  John knows without asking and they never talk about it.  Lovely John.  John knows.
