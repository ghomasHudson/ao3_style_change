"In the name of Hecate, that wasn't Faerie light, that was the spectral light of the incorporeal Fianna," said John, "Anyway, Fionn is not one of the Fae."
"Ah'm not a flowa wilted or oth'awise," growled John.
"Hmmm," hummed the detective. "I think we have just enough time to have a quick round of shower sex..."
"Well, you best bring him back," said Mummy, ever the voice of practicality. "I'd like to serve tea now."
"Mm," hummed John, crossing his arms defensively across his chest.
to delete anything, especially not the bit when John said that he loved Sherlock.
Confused John looked just like a bemused little Shar-pei, thought the affectionate detective. Sherlock knew that he was a bit irrational just now, even, in fact, a bit sentimental. He knew that this was because he was still a bit high on endorphins and oxytocin and getting what he wanted (twice) (three times in John's case) (and Sherlock could die happy just recalling the visuals and sounds of John coming apart for him three times)...not to mention that Sherlock was so damned right, as usual.
John's face went from red to white; it twisted itself in confused consternation.
"S,sto...stop" gasped the doctor.
"No, it was not in fact the first time you had sex on a table, but it was the first time you had sex on a table with a man ravishing your beautiful arse, the first time you had three orgasms in less than two hours since you were in college… no, three orgasms in less than two hours is a first…Kudos to me!"
"...do I know them?" said Mycroft, annoyingly completing John's question. "I make it my business to keep track of all registered vampires, especially ones belonging to the diplomatic corps."
"Ah," said Mycroft politely.
"Shut up, Mycroft," snapped the angry detective. "So you didn't resist his summons?"
Upon his arrival home, it only took the good doctor twelve minutes to provide Sherlock with a perfect cup of tea. Say what you will about John Watson, at least the man made wonderful tea—just the way Sherlock liked it.
"… the infection is gone," muttered John, raising his 'got it in one' finger.
"How badly are you hurt?" demanded Sherlock, who didn't like John's strange, distant voice. "Did you hit your head?"
"Sorry, Ma'am," said John, once again standing at attention to receive his dressing down and the requisite drying off. Then he began to explain, "But I really had no choice. Fionn called me and…"
"Will you two please stop talking like Adrien and Jacinthe?" hissed Mycroft, "it's..."
"John, I know when you are feigning sleep, and you of all people should know by now, that ignoring me won't make me go away, at least not when I'm investigating…
"...we grew up in Lyon…"
Sherlock strode past the empty bathroom, into the dark vacant kitchen and peered into the John-less sitting room.
But if Elizabeth was awake and crying in the middle of the night, then something was wrong; she must be ill.
"Half a glass of water does note equate with copious amounts of fluid.
"I had to," said John simply.
He did find himself back in bed, covers drawn up and held close to his detective's side. Baby Elizabeth was content in her godfather's other arm, as he stretched his long legs under the blanket and slowly relaxed backwards into the headboard.
John shook his head no and accepted another piece of scone from the hand of his proudly smirking companion.
"That's brilliant!" announced the detective, who beamed beatifically.
"You...you've left her?" asked the detective, hardly daring to whisper his deduction.
"...you must settle down, mon ami," said her pallid twin, who also kissed John on the mouth. Sherlock was certain that the little Frenchman had used his tongue.
"John Watson?"
"...the first time you gave a blow job…well done, by the way. I nearly passed out," the arrogant git grinned happily. "The first time you had sex on a table...oh, wait. No..."
"I made him disappear!" exclaimed Phillip, waving a plastic, glitter-covered magician's wand from some toy shop.
"…love the nightlife…"
It was worth the bruise on his head to be out from under her talons once and for all. Now he and Lizzy could start their new lives together, without her.
John snatched the tea towel out of Talbot's hand and fruitlessly dabbed at his ruined jumper.
"And his mobile phone signal was poor," continued Sherlock, attempting to cover for his idiot partner, who had forgotten his promise to keep his magical nature a secret. "So obviously he had to go outside. Although next time he might remember to tell me first."
John blinked, clearly getting teary-eyed from exhaustion and his chronic, recurring sentimentality.
"Oh God, Sherlock!" cried John, who naturally thought the words were for him. The doctor turned deathly pale and stuttered, "I...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...well I meant it, of course. But never mind it. Can't you just delete what I said about loving you? Then we'll just go on as before, yeah?"
Sherlock stopped spinning his doctor.
"Yes and yes," said John wearily. "He's wanted me to join the Hunt for a long time now, ever since I healed one of his riders, Hippolyta...not the queen of legend, obviously, but her granddaughter. Ever since then, the Fianna have invited me to join the hunt—every few decades. Not only be a huntsman, you know, but to also be a sort of medical officer. Which is really very flattering." John gave the sky a suspicious sideways glance, then said confidentially "To be quite honest, I've never been all that fond of horses. That's why I originally joined the infantry instead of the cavalry."
"Oh really?" asked Sherlock, immediately suspicious. When he had first appeared John was bemused, one might say bewitched. Then John defends this supernatural but
"John, there's no point in showering right now, and I wish to smoke one of my few remaining cigarettes.'
"W,who did she...kill?" stuttered John finally.
Mummy gave Sherlock
"Are you on drugs or does it just hurt to talk?" asked the detective.
('Brother mine,') interrupted an imaginary Mycroft, who intruded his bulk even into Sherlock's mind palace, ('John Watson is becoming suspicious of your conspicuous pause without deducing him. If you don't wish your goldfish to discover the depth of your pedestrian sentiments, I suggest you say something rude and insensitive almost instantly.')
The doctor sighed deeply.
"Richard Talbot is a very influential individual. I've run into him at dinner parties and charity events...oh, and of course I see him at Ascot, every year without fail. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I saw him standing in Mummy's sitting room."
Elizabeth snuffled, and worked her dummy; John drew closer, rubbing his face into his lover's shoulder with a little snort. 'Like father, like daughter indeed.'
"Fine. You insisted, so do not complain to me. It is called Operation: John-Comes-To-His-Senses. And incidentally, Operation: John-Comes-To-His-Senses automatically triggered Operation: Goodbye Mary so that everything is being accomplished in one well-thought-out swoop," said Sherlock, reaching for his second-to-last cigarette after all. "As a part of the plan, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade have already secured Elizabeth, with the assistance of the British government. Molly is directing the minions in packing up enough necessities so that you and Elizabeth can spend a day or two here, without worrying about such tedious details as packing, and without having to worry about exposure to Angel or the Major. Oh! And Mrs. Turner is getting that dreadful house listed for sale so that you won't begin to worry about that too, which you surely would. Mrs. Turner has a certificate, you know."
John opened his eyes, and as expected, saw Sherlock, immaculately dressed in his bespoke black suit and sexy too-tight purple shirt.
The siblings still clutched one another like terrified children. Then they remembered that they were stoic British men and quickly pushed each other away. They stumbled to their feet and surveyed the wrack and ruin.
The Watsons were nothing if not resolute, that is to say, stubborn. Clearly, John was now overwhelmed by sentiment and required attention, which he would no doubt stubbornly refuse.
“…indicating Fionn’s claim…” said Jacinthe.
Judging from the look on his face, Richard
But this was
"Do stop bragging, Sherlock," said the British Government, "I wouldn't want to see the poor man go into apoplexy before the wedding. Now do try to get your doctor out of bed, if he can walk, and clean him up. And don't forget to scour that table. Scour it twice…in fact."
Relief flooded the detective, his John, his loving, smiling Leprechaun had was back and safe—and as loyal as ever.
"Well, I never agreed to bed him. Not once. I prefer not to be a one-night diversion. And tonight, as usual, I politely declined both the offer of joining the hunt and the offer of
"John."
Made of sterner stuff than consulting detectives and bureaucrats, the former army officer stoically stood to attention under her ministrations. He didn’t even spill his tea.
Avaril sulked at being ignored.
"Yes."
(And both of them like watching football.) sneered mental Mycroft. (See, caring is not an advantage. As soon as you care for someone, they run off with a beer drinking, football-watching fool of a doctor.)
"You left the party to meet with someone named Finn?" demanded Sherlock jealously.
Mummy tsk'ed and turned to scold and fuss over John instead.
did he call you?" demanded both the Holmes brothers.
Sherlock almost choked when John nodded and smiled back at Mycroft. The younger Holmes would have gladly knocked Mycroft over with his fist.
"You'll catch your death if you don't dry off, Sherlock," she tutted.
"Yes, you did. I recorded it on my phone," said Sherlock, holding his mobile well out of the reach of the shorter-armed man. "Frankly, John, it was adorable."
" ...and now, London…"
'Now what's wrong?' wondered Sherlock.
? We were
Then the ever-observant detective noticed John's helpless goldfish-out-of-water face. It was endearing, of course, but a subtle sign, that perhaps John had not been aware of his wife's second, rather more lucrative, job. Perhaps this was upsetting for his blogger.
"He did it by making me fall in love with him and so growing a new heart," replied the leprechaun.
John tugged the genius, who was still talking a mile-a-minute, pulled him down into heartfelt yet very chaste kiss.
"You mean you didn't leave her because she's returned to her job as an assassin?"
The leprechaun blinked and then smiled at his lover. "Of course I'm staying with you. Always."
John stepped back, putting his hand up to his swollen jaw.
"JESUS!" shrieked John, trying to drag the soiled bedclothes over his bits, and then over Sherlock's bits and then over his bits again, because the bedclothes were very tangled and uncooperative. Sherlock was unmoved, and he enjoyed one of the last cigarettes that he would smoke at 221b. He did not offer a cigarette to Mycroft.
"You returned to me dazed…"
"We can't just hide out here behind the hedge," protested Sherlock.
The former army doctor reached one hand around the talkative genius's neck. Sherlock was still going on about John's inhibitions, 'probably projecting,' thought the doctor with a fond smile. 'I'll give him a safe little kiss, to let him know how I feel.'
"Well, perhaps I was a
"It was a summonsing enchantment," replied John sharply, "which one cannot refuse. But the call to arms and the invitation to warm his bed is still a matter of choice. Choice is important to the Fianna. Although admittedly Fionn does stack the deck by using his glamour to look irresistibly masculine.”
"Sherlock, it's all been quite fantastic...the um...sex, I mean. But, if you must know, I'm a bit sore, so…um, maybe you could hold that thought for awhile?"
Which was fine.
"Oh God, Sherlock!" cried John who'd gone deathly pale. "I...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...well I meant it, of course. But never mind it. Can't you just delete what I said about loving you? Then we'll just go on as before, yeah?"
John bit his lip. "Well...it might be a friend...then again it might not be a friend. I can't say that I recognize her voice."
"Why you left Mary!" Sherlock almost shouted.
Richard looked down disdainfully at John, the tea tray and Mummy. "I don't do tea, nor do I do
"Ahm not cute," said John, hugging his chest and looking fiercely adorable.
"...had a taste of it before..." suggested Sherlock, his eyes lighting up with another successful deduction.
John had managed to unbutton several of those stupid, fiddly little buttons on Sherlock's fitted shirt, exposing the base of that long, pale neck and what seemed to be acres of smooth, white chest.
responds instantly, running off into a storm without a word to me and disappears into the woods alone with this magical hunter, then...
"Sorry."
"No, I didn't know."
"Ah know that, She'wock," said John flinging an arm over his eyes. The blond could be such a drama queen.
This was clearly an urgent matter- no time for modesty. John stumbled out of bed. Those vigorous, repeated sessions of sex did make walking a challenge for the doctor...
"I don't wish to hear any more of this," said Mycroft primly. He was ignored.
Then John made his own observation, 'Good God, does Sherlock have an erection too?'
'Perhaps...perhaps we could schedule sex on a predictable basis, planning around cases. The very predictability of it would lead to less mental degredation. And if we avoid sex during cases, then a tiny, temporary loss of perfect mental functioning during sex would be tolerable.'
It was now 20:03.
"Very good, John!" the detective congratulated John and beaming proudly. "I didn't think you'd notice that she was working again. No one could blame you for leaving her under those circumstances, although why you care what people think is beyond even my comprehension."
This had been their first night together as a couple, as a family. Sherlock had never thought that he'd be part of a couple…let alone a family. He'd never even thought that he'd be happy.
"Everyone who?" asked John, now wearing his endearing soldier's belligerent face.
"Jeezhus!" John cried out, pushing Sherlock sharply away. The blond sat up, breathing heavily and looking wildly around the room in obvious confusion.
The younger man helped lift his blogger by one elbow, earning himself the patented I-can-do-it-myself John Watson glare. Nothing daunted, Sherlock released John's arm, only to gently extract the sleeping infant from her father's arms.
The World's Only Consulting Detective eyed his best friend (who should be more than his best friend), who for once seemed happy, albeit exhausted. Which was…unexpected, because lately John was always miserable and exhausted, not happy and exhausted.
Not even a, 'Why are you in my flat, unannounced, at 0830 in the morning, wearing my dressing gown, while Mrs. Hudson apparently has had to wash your clothes. Oh, and by the way, did you know your mobile is broken, John?'
"No!" shouted Sherlock. Although he really couldn't say for sure, because he and John had only been together for about a month.
John started and looked around the room, his eyes wide with alarm, before staring questioningly at the tall, handsome but rather anemic gentleman.
Elizabeth had been fed immediately prior to the last round of sex, in which John demonstrated that even a natural bottom could top, and do it really well...but that was not important, well, it wasn't important now. It would obviously be useful during their upcoming sex holiday.
"John hasn't answered my question," said the British government.
"Why what?" asked the doctor, who now remembered that he frequently got confused when staying at 221B.
The doctor could feel the smile waver on his face while he waited, worrying about THAT.
"Does she do this...often?"
Sherlock retook his seat, plucking his violin discordantly, as he watched his occasionally idiotic conductor of light (who should be MY husband) smile stupidly, for no good reason, especially considering that he was married to an international assassin, who had attacked him with a mobile phone and who could be plotting against John even now...
John’s frown lines deepened, warning of rough seas ahead. Sherlock decided to try a new tack.
John was the doctor. John was supposed to take care of Sherlock; he wasn’t supposed to get sick himself. Frankly, the consulting detective found it difficult to deal with an under-the-weather John.
John successfully darkened his glower—a fairly significant achievement for a blue-eyed blond. "I ought to sharpen up some wooden stakes,” hissed the sprite lunging at Richard Talbot.
So in this chapter John and Sherlock do somethings for the first time. A lot of it is implied. This is the chapter where I think it earns an M rating. I really don't think it's an E, but since I haven't found a 'How to Rate Your FanFic for DUMMIES' page, I'll just have to guess. As with tags, I really don't know what I'm doing. Anyway, it's all for fun and yes, the characters are OOC.
John nodded. It was a very good solution. Tied up lots of loose ends. And he really didn't want to see either of them anymore.
Perhaps...perhaps the violin was not conducive to sleep when John was ill? No, that couldn’t be correct. Sherlock had played for hours when John had the flu specifically because it seemed to sooth the doctor.
"You went into your bloody mind palace again, didn't you?" accused John, his Shar-Pei forehead wrinkling in righteous indignation. "I know you think sentiments are stupid."
"Of course. Of course that would be bothering you."
It was not that Sherlock was actually concerned. It wasn't as though they had a case on, so there was no reason for John to be kidnapped by unknown assailants. And Mycroft was out of town. Besides, John had promised not to get into anymore mysterious, black sedans, no matter how much he craved excitement.
"No," said John shaking his head.
John tried to pretend that he was suddenly comatose—a futile endeavor.
"Sherlock! You're getting crumbs all over the carpet," complained Mummy. "You always were the messy one."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the stubbornness of Watsons, and went to lay Elizabeth in her cot. Naturally, she stubbornly opened her eyes before her back touched the cot. She then perfectly mimicked her father's tear-filled look.
"Time?" muttered John, blinking as rain pelted his face.
John scratched his head and blinked, "
"Oh, who cares! John? John!" shouted Sherlock.
"Good God! Have you been fighting," demanded the consulting detective.
"John, let me remind you to use short words without liquid consonants,” Sherlock advised.
"Can we not talk about this?" complained Sherlock.
"Wait," said John, glaring up from under deeply, disapproving brows. "What are you implying?"
"Mummy and Father only wished to meet your young man…"
The taller man sagged with relief. John didn't want to leave. The doctor was just confused, which was not unusual for John, especially in the middle of the night.
"Yes, it is." insisted the consulting detective. "You're going to get nervous about two men kissing, because you're 'not gay'." He added irritating finger quotes.
The doctor turned to pour the water, while Sherlock deciphered this gibberish.
honk for no good reason. Beatrice said that she wouldn't miss meeting anyone who'd take up with Sherlock, come hell or high water. Come to think of it, I don't know what she meant by that. Anyone would be lucky to take up with Sherlock." The Holmes matriarch pushed her son temporarily out of the way, lifting the ruffled curtain to peer out into the murk. "Well, don't see Beatrice's car, but it’s very hard to see anything. That sky is black as night, and the rain's coming down in buckets! I cannot think
'Dammit, soldier,' thought the former Captain Watson, 'don't just stand there like a virgin sacrifice, get some for yourself.' The former soldier shuddered (and possibly moaned) and tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Then gave up thinking as a lost cause; he abandoned reasoning, after all, 'Sherlock's here, and he's way better at thinking and reasoning anyway. Let him do it."
"Summoned you? How?" asked Mycroft.
Mostly they were old scars. Sherlock knew about the old shoulder wound, of course. But there were others, about which he knew nothing (yet) and a few newer scars-not even really scars yet. These were softer, still tender, probably pink or red-if he'd been able to see them. These were recent injuries.
The huskiness of John's voice indicated possible arousal.
Sherlock was concerned, and his fingers drummed a nervous cadence on the desk. Upon reflection, he didn't think that John's dentist was treating this infection even a little aggressively. He wished that he knew the name of John's dentist, so that he could research him or her. He considered contacting Mycroft, who would certainly know the name of the dentist and who would of course have a complete dossier on said dentist. But then, John's dentist couldn't be completely incompetent, or Mycroft would have replaced the dentist long before now.
Secondly,the silk robe had slipped off his shoulder; he was all but naked in front of Sherlock Holmes and, as noted previously, hard as a rock and wanton as a whore. And while this made him blush, he decided that he liked it, A lot. It was daring, dangerous and it led to the next realization...
And the doctor's funny speech was really cute. It was so cute that Sherlock decided to switch off the light and risk climbing into bed to sit next to John. It helped to know that abscesses were not contagious, which he had known all along, but the online confirmation didn't hurt.
"What?" asked John, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "I thought we were talking about the Fianna?"
"Really, I thought you boys would have enough sense not to venture out into such a terrible storm!" scolded the matriarch.
'Too bloody right.'
"Why are you spinning me and more importantly, why do you hate me?" asked the doctor.
worried!"
The detective was used to John's confusing explanations and decided to table the discussion until they were alone. Just now he wanted to prevent John from lighting Richard up like a Roman candle. "Calm down, John," murmured Sherlock. "I won't let him kiss you again." He tried to distract the leprechaun with another bit of scone.
"After I got you off for the third time, and you all but passed out after screaming so loud that one of the married ones next door banged on the wall. I think it was Reggie pounding on the wall and telling you to shut up. He's the one who works from home and he hasn't been getting any recently due to the stress that Arnold is undergoing at work," mused Sherlock. "And it was after you thanked God, and thanked me and thanked the academy..."
Now John looked gross and possibly contagious.
"Not so fast!" said Mycroft. "We are not bringing a fairy of unknown provenance to roost in our family's abode."
Fionn mac Cumhaill, if you know what I mean," said John, with raised eyebrows. John was much more like himself now, but Sherlock was too worried about this Finn fellow to appreciate that John had recovered from whatever caused his earlier mental confusion.
"Does this mean that we might kiss...um, eventually?" asked John, with an uncertain smile.
"Because...because...your trousers," said John, who suddenly found complete sentences beyond his grasp. "Get them dirty. Dry clean only."
"And secondly,” continued Sherlock. “You know that my aversion to your sweat is non-existent during intercourse. Indeed, I find it attractive and arousing, perhaps because of the pheromones.”
Unless he'd passed out already. Unless he was already dying from asphyxiation...
"No, of course not; they don't concern you at all," said the brunet, carefully modulating the volume of his voice as he was taught by John, Mrs. Hudson, Mary, Gavin, Molly...well, everyone really. "Actually, they concern you...a little... but your input is not required. Now, what's wrong? Is Elizabeth ill?"
"Oh God, yes!" exclaimed John. "I don't think she'll fight it though. Once she realized that I meant to leave her, she seemed only too eager to ditch little Lizzy too...unless she's plotting something. But I don't think she is-plotting that is. After she broke m'phone, and I won the knife from her, she just stormed out of the kitchen and started packing… You know, I think she may be having an affair. Not with David, he hasn't gotten over his disappointment that Lizzy is mine. No, I think she's found someone new..."
"But I won't actually point at him—or her."
"But fussing could be the first sign of infection or..."
"You shouldn't go out there, Sherlock; that storm is getting worse," protested Mummy. "And the scones…"
John sighed, but his rigid tension began to melt, which was always a good sign.
"Damn," muttered Sherlock. There was the proof; someone or something was wielding magic in those woods. It was risky to go on—if that light wasn’t emanating from John and if the source was hostile, Sherlock would be helpless against it.
It was unlike John to be so inconsiderate. Sherlock furled his brow briefly, had he forgotten that John had to run to the shops today? No, of course not. Sherlock would never make that kind of mistake. He always remembered to give John a list entitled 'REQUIRED ITEMS' on shopping days.
Sherlock could only hope that John wasn't suffering from some supernatural injury or a curse or a spell or something.
Then the doctor couldn't babble because he was sucking on one of the delectable little buds on Sherlock's chest. And he, John Hamish Watson, was making William Sherlock Scott Holmes groan and arch his back into John's mouth.
John did not have the faintest idea of whether he spoke out loud or not. He didn't mind.
But the violin: now that sounded almost not-dull. He'd been learning a new piece, and he'd been having a spot of trouble with the adagio. Now would be the perfect time to play, since it wouldn't have to compete with the telly.
"John, answer me!" shouted Sherlock, whirling around in the early dusk.
"Don't be foolish," hissed Mycroft at everyone, most especially at his furious sibling. "I'm sure John is playing a childish prank. He must have snuck off...perhaps he's skulking upstairs."
"I was talking to Mycroft, but never mind him," the detective said to a very confused ex-army doctor. "Now, John, you stated, and I quote 'You are a git, and I also love you'. John, do love me as a potential romantic partner?"
"Oh God!" cried John, bending down and holding the back of his head, making it impossible for Sherlock to see John's face, let alone his physique. "Oh God!" repeated the doctor.
And Sherlock had let his beloved wander off into their dark and probably cold bedroom (That stupid room was always too cold. Sherlock would be sure to complain to the landlady first thing in the morning.) What if John was suffering from chills? What if he was having a serious complication from his abscess right now?
"Whoever," corrected Sherlock and Richard in unison, which irritated Sherlock, because now Richard was making Sherlock seem pedantic.
"Besides," added the tall detective, cuddling his blogger close. "It will be easier to keep undesirables away from you, if you live here, (everyone meaning everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty). And, as a bonus, as long as we live here, Mrs. Hudson can babysit Elizabeth."
"Why should I?" demanded the arrogant detective.
“Don’t use words that require the use of the letter’s R and L,” said the genius of Baker Street, enunciating slowly to enable his non-genius companion to comprehend every word.
On the other hand, it would be a bit not good for John to stab Richard in the heart and set him on fire with Sherlock's lighter. At the very least, this should not be done in Mummy's sitting room and in front of witnesses. He pulled the furious ex-soldier further into the corner and held his hands, simultaneously dimming the nascent glow and calming the infuriated sprite.
'sucking his lips and OH! Sucking on his tongue!' John moaned again, and arched toward the fire of Sherlock Holmes, because that man's truly enormous hands were caressing him underneath the silk dressing gown, which had magically lost its belt. And John was just a poor moth who could never resist circling closer and closer to Sherlock's flame. 'A really, really bad romance novel...' thought John again. "A really bad, really sexy romance novel.'
Mummy tutted, then followed Mycroft—probably to give him advice.
One finger again.
But it was Mummy. The genius tried rather desperately to think of a way to make her stop.
"Papers which I forged for him as a favor to you," said Mycroft. "And his false identity could be destroyed as easily as it was created."
"No, you never said you were sick. You claimed that you had an abscessed mandibular molar requiring antibiotic therapy..."
"First of all," said Sherlock. "I thought we agreed to keep your leprechaun side a secret."
"James?"
Root canal would make John cranky; Sherlock would have to try to find a cold case to avoid John post operatively.
He had tested Elizabeth's color preferences rigorously, and she was most assuredly happiest around the color blue, and miserable around pink. So he added, "But I cannot recommend pink. Elizabeth likes blue and hates pink. Which was probably one of the reasons that she was unhappy at Mary's house. Mary insisted on painting Elizabeth's room that frankly alarming shade of pink. Soooo, I painted her room blue, knowing that you would not be a slave to gender stereotyping. Still, if you don't like blue, which is Elizabeth's favorite color, I suppose Elizabeth and I might go in for turquoise or green. Perhaps a nice pale green with hints of blue…"
"Dear little Sherly," she gushed. "You look so much better than the last time that I saw you."
The brilliant scientist examined seven slides and was adjusting the eyepiece on his microscope, when he was forced to clear his dry throat. He really was very thirsty, and hoped John would return soon with the sugar for his currently unpalatable tea. Since speech was evidently painful, the doctor certainly wouldn't want to chat with Mrs. Hudson for very long, which should speed things along nicely.
“Nite."
But what if John was in trouble? Sherlock was determined to carry on, but there was no reason to put Mycroft at risk too. Anyway, Sherlock didn't want his brother to learn of John's abilities. So he yelled over the storm, "Mycroft! Go back, back to the house."
This was all true. John sometimes had violent nightmares. And on rare occasions, John had problems with unexpected explosions or even…
Sherlock briefly entertained the notion of pushing John to the floor as payback, but thought better of it (thanks to his angelic, John-shaped conscience). In the end, he did love John and was even a little bit glad to see that his partner seemed to be feeling better. Instead of pushing John away, he allowed his doctor to rest, using Sherlock’s arm as a pillow.
(Clearly NOT angry. Excellent! Shower sex may be back on the menu. Although John's arse and his mouth might need some time to recover fully. No matter, there are plenty of other things we can do, especially in the shower."
"…such crowds…"
would John go out in the rain?" demanded Mummy, with a hint of iron in her voice. Her ire fell upon her youngest son. "Tell me why. And just as the scones were finishing, too."
"Stay!" Mummy commanded John. The blond froze, and stood to attention. "Your two friends, John—they're twins, obviously—I mean to say, that they're lovely, just delightful. But...I'm not quite so sure about that Richard...I just wondered, if you two don't get on, then why invite him?"
Another disturbing aspect of the man was that Sherlock wasn’t able to deduce him properly.
(John's always licking his lip, biting his lip. He worries at it just to tease me,) thought the detective, as he devoured John's mouth. (And now it's MY lip. Now I can lick it. I can bite it. It's mine. Mine. All mine.)
"See, even now the thought of a homosexual tryst puts you off, making you blush," said the detective. "Nonetheless, you are adorable when you blush, John."
"The first time you had any sex in eight months," continued the detective. "The first time I had sex in..."
"...and he's Adrien," said the short blonde.
Suddenly an unearthly howl rent the stormy night.
"It was luck, not a miracle," said John absently, narrowing his eyes at the clouds.
"Just a minor official, I assure you. Well, brother mine, while you were staking your claim, everything thing else has been taken care of," said Mycroft standing in the doorway, completely unaffected by the sight of the debauched, naked men in front of him. "I took the liberty of stopping by in person because neither of you is answering your phones."
"And I was a woof,” whispered John.
"Sherlock, Sherlock," hissed John, tugging on Sherlock's damp, coat sleeve. "Sherlock! I won't actually be able to tell you when Fionn summons me again."
"Um-hm," John nodded.
"Mary has not proven to be a very nurturing mother," said Sherlock studiously studying John's previously uncharted territory. "Nevertheless, I seriously doubt that she would harm her own child."
"Wait, where did he get dry clothes?" asked John, looking down at his own sodden, muddy and blood stained clothing. Then the blond shivered—right on cue.
"And how do you know Richard, Mycroft?" asked John, as he fed Sherlock yet another piece of sandwich—chicken salad this time.
"…but our favorite city is of course…"
"Richard, this is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Richard. He's a bloodsucker, and he's in publishing, which makes him doubly a monster to be avoided," said John. Before Sherlock could shake Richard's extended hand, John knocked the stranger’s hand aside, leaning forward to whisper loud enough for all the eavesdropping relatives to hear, "and if you so much as
"Oh no," said John, "The cuts are from Fionn. He whipped me when he rode off. They all did—more or less. They always go a bit mad when their invitation is rejected—violent tempers, the lot of them. One of them got my shoulder pretty good, too. It's always my shoulder…" John's grumbling trailed off, as he twisted his neck, trying look at the back of his left shoulder.
"You're right about one thing," said Sherlock with a smirk. "John is hiding. He's hiding from someone who wishes him ill."
“But…Ah was hoping that ‘one day at a time’ could start tomorro’?" said John. "It's been a wong day and I'm weawy and tiwed.”
"Except Lizzy. "
"Sherlock," hissed the small tousle-haired doctor, simultaneously embarrassed and concerned for his infant. Clearly, last was the more important of the two. "What if the daycare tried to get a hold of you? You are the alternate emergency contact."
"Stop. Please stop..." said John weakly.
"Sholto, of course," replied Sherlock, answering pensively.
"You expect me to believe that Sherlock Holmes was so lovable that you..."
"He invited himself," grumbled John. "And at one time he was my friend, a good friend...before we had a bit of a falling out. It began with a business deal gone sour and then…then there was trouble...over…over some dinner arrangements, I guess you could say."
John was drowning in those glacially blue eyes and in the sinfully rich voice of the god of sex.
"Sherlock!" hissed Mycroft, who had come to a stop by a large yew. "There's something going on! Up by the front door. People...you don't think it's Cousin Prudence and her obnoxious brood? I cannot abide any of them. Mummy said that she'd invited Prudence. Can you make out who..."
"Never mind the scones!" snapped Sherlock, restraining his full fury only because it was Mummy. "And never mind the storm. I have to find John."
you hear any horns?" Mycroft asked his brother.
'Oh what's wrong now?' thought John, eyeing the detectives frown with deep concern, 'I don't understand...I thought he wanted...He said he was going to kiss me. Did I do something wrong? Was I supposed to wait? It was probably too much. Maybe he really does hate to be touched...Oh God! I don't understand!'
"We?" asked John weakly, feeling a tiny bit less humiliated as the detective's words sank in.
John saw his best friend leaning closer to him, while wearing a predatory grin.
"Summoned you? Why?" shouted Sherlock, assuming that if he talked louder then John would ignore Mycroft and finish answering Sherlock's questions first.
The consulting detective raised his brow, acknowledging his former flat mate's unexpected appearance in 221B on a rainy Wednesday morning. The lanky brunet leaned forward, elbows balanced on his bony knees, fingers steepled together, glacial blue eyes scanning John Watson, boring into him, deducing him.
"What?" exclaimed Sherlock, instantly furious on John's behalf.
Sherlock had hoped that his fierce glare would keep his relatives at bay, but no. He'd been spotted by his Aunt Penelope, who sported five chins, all of which jiggled ominously over her lacy schoolgirl collar as she hobbled over.
"And everyone knew but me...again."
"You could..." John leaned forward more and nodded his head for emphasis, "...have wooked..." His head nodded again and his brows began climbing up his forehead, "for me in the bedwoom. I toad you. I'm sick." Head nod." He reminded Sherlock of an angry little chicken or possibly a cockatiel?
Sherlock frowned at his failed mission and stormed up the stairs, yelling  "John! John! Where are you! I need you, now!"
John raised an eyebrow, as if surprised by this comment.
"I'm looking for John. I sent him down for sugar..."
Sherlock resurfaced slowly, gently, taking a deep breath of cool evening air, noting that he'd left the window cracked open. Then he snuggled deeper under the warm covers. He buried his face into the soft pillow that smelled of John.
His heart twisted uncomfortably in his chest. He wanted to believe that John had been driven into the storm due to the hellish inanity of the tea party; after all, Sherlock could fully sympathize with that. But there was that bit about a horn. And John had obviously risked using his ability to 'go unseen', despite the presence of all those party guests.
"Sherlock, please don't go into your mind palace just yet," asked John sadly. "Look, just hear me out, and if you hate what I'm saying, you can delete it, yeah?"
Instead, the detective asked, “Mandibular or maxillary molar?"
John risked a small smile, "Um...if it's so brilliant, does that mean...um..."
"Mmmm," said John, humming with post-ecstatic joy. "That! That cigarette is your last cigarette," added the doctor, 'because even if Sherlock did short out my brain with the World's Best Sex...and dear God, he's right, I am a natural bottom...Still, it's not as though I can't smell his bloody cancer sticks, stinking up the room.'
Two fingers. Now that was rude. And confusing. Normally, John did enjoy Sherlock's performances, especially in the middle of the night. John said that the music helped him to sleep.
The leprechaun barely managed to whisper, "No." Then the former soldier and medical officer furrowed his brows and shook his head as if to clear it, saying firmly, "No. This is Richard Talbot." The leprechaun made Richard's name sound like a vile expletive.
The deflecting doctor placed a whisper of a kiss on the baby's head, and started to rise awkwardly, clearly stiff.
dazed," said John. "And if I was, dazed that is, it's because I was concentrating on  his lusty advances, and because I had to spread luck to you and your family. Plus, he keeps blowing that bloody horn of his, and it's distracting." John looked off toward an impressive display of cloud-to-cloud lightning and got that far-away look in his eyes again.
The pale man sneered at Sherlock and gave his head an affected shake, whipping his long, dark hair over his shoulder.
"This is hateful," shouted Mycroft, trying not to cower as thunder cracked overhead. "Is John prone to wandering about in storms?"
"Wait, where're we going?" asked John, inevitably following Sherlock Holmes, even as he stubbornly questioned everything. "Shouldn't we get that empty bottle and wash it? And what d'you mean like father, like daughter?" John was forced to talk to the silent detective's back. "No, really, what does that even mean..."
"Nooo," said John pursing his lips. "I mean yes, I mean...she wakes up every night to feed."
"I didn't hear you properly," said the detective slowly spinning the doctor around, " Tell me again about your feelings."
"Look out!"
'Oh God, he doesn't want to even listen; he certainly won't welcome my inappropriate affections,' thought John. 'I've misread the whole thing...'
Really, the whole Mary debacle, on top of caring for a new baby, on top of extra hours at the clinic had been too much for John Watson. The Magnussen and Moriarty cases which barely predated Elizabeth's exciting arrival on the world stage probably hadn't helped John's peace of mind. Definitely didn't help.
John blinked, a scruffy, blond owl in a faded blue, too-long dressing gown.
"I can't answer it," said John. "Portents and omens are nearly impossible to understand unless you're a seer. I am a leprechaun, not a seer. All I know is that Death is coming to tea."
He heard a noise...a soft whimper and some whispers...John. But John sounded distant and hoarse, upset. The sounds came... from a device somewhere in the room…Why would someone place a radio in the room broadcasting John and Elizabeth?
Captain Watson was on auto-pilot and just kept kissing HIS lips, HIS jaw, under HIS jaw and...
“John?"
Sherlock's lips turned down in displeasure, while he chewed.
"But you like when I play the violin."
"Pawacetamol?" John mumbled.
"Oh, my golly," cried the stupidest Holmes relation, "I really made him disappear. I really am magic!"
"Not his summons, no. But I would have gone anyway to see what he wanted…"
"What was that?"
"How about trying to avoid multisyllabic words until your abscess has resolved," snarked Sherlock, allowing John squirm off the detective, although his head still rested on the detective's chest.
'Isn't that cute?'... ... ...'Wait, I'll smell like sex? That's hot!'... ... ...'Wait, we're going to shower...together? Oh God! Yes!'
"If you're quite finished behaving like children," began Mycroft.
Sherlock ran up the steps to John's old room, now Elizabeth's room, her newly painted blue room, (not pink like Mary had demanded.)
"What color? What?" asked John, who was quite unable to keep up.
The scruffy-looking blond dithered, shifting from one foot to another.
The genius grinned proudly.
"Hm, perhaps you're right. You'd end up being the one to fix the radiator anyway," said Sherlock. "Perhaps I'll try to obtain an electric space heater tomorrow."
"Oh for God's sake, forget about John!" Mycroft shouted back. "What about Mummy?"
Sherlock must have done something wrong?  But what?
The detective slid his tongue inside John's unresisting mouth, claiming it too, and finally tasting the doctor (HIS DOCTOR) (Ohhh! Yes. Yes. YES! Now this is kissing,) thought the smug consulting detective. (If I keep him busy enough, John won't be able to have a sexual identity crisis. If he's full of endorphins, he'll be too happy to worry about being gay. I'll make him so happy that he'll want to be gay.)
"Well, she's a rogue, former CIA hit-woman, of course she's dangerous!" said Sherlock in a loud, annoying, half-whine.
Gah!!! No. Not that! John’s tears were intolerable. Especially if Sherlock had been the one who caused John to cry—but then again, the two other times that John had cried had been Sherlock's fault too. Well, there wasn't going to be a third time. Not on Sherlock's watch.
"I assume the violin was too loud?"
However, Sherlock did not consider himself a gentleman. So he did peek, which suddenly made it imperative that he find a way to take advantage of John, even if he 'wasn't gay'. There had to be a way. Sherlock Holmes was a genius, so obviously he should be able to conceive of a way to not only seduce John Watson, but also to secure the affections of the former army doctor, before the hapless man fell into the clutches of yet another ruthless female predator.
Besides, Mary was female and Sherlock was male. Even though John was a natural bottom, who seemed to relish the various forms of homosexual intercourse which they had sampled in the past eighteen hours, John would be more comfortable maintaining his heterosexual stereotype. Apparently John was even willing to suffer Mary's abuse.
'Thank God I joined that gym!' thought John, who like the fact that Sherlock Holmes found him stimulating. John bit and sucked a bruise just above his lover's collarbone.
The consulting detective somehow heard his partner's eyes rolling in his head.
"This is fascinating, but not to the point," interrupted Mycroft.
"And you want me to move in here, with Lizzy?" muttered John. He smiled dreamily, his fingers making lazy trails up and down Sherlock's jaw and across his cheekbones. Suddenly, John tensed, "I suppose I'll have to talk it all over with, her. At least until everything is settled legally. And I'll have to go home to pack, and talk and argue and... unless she really did go to Belarus…"
finally creeps out of the woods he's dazed, cut and bleeding—and
"It's not the kissing I'm worried about," said John, turning his face away from the pastry. "It's the sucking my blood out that worries me. That bloody vampire has a fetish for non-humans; he's been after a taste of my blood for years. I bet he'd just love to have a leprechaun for a thrall. I really wish he'd...Sherlock, are you all right?"
John’s pronunciation was extremely funny, but Sherlock managed to keep a straight face—better a straight face than a bruised face.
'Amazing!' thought the doctor, trying not to stare longingly at his best friend's lap.
"No, that will not be necessary," said Sherlock quickly.
"...that the portents are seldom…"
"Will you sue for custody..."?
"That's all right, you can run down now, and ask Mrs. Hudson for some sugar," said Sherlock, graciously making an allowance since John was not feeling well. The detective sat back down to examine the liver samples, which he'd bathed in solutions of water with varying amounts of sucrose in order to examine the effects of increasing osmotic pressure on hepatocytes. It was an old experiment, but a classic one. It was a way to pass the time when John was out gallivanting around, and it sharpened the genius’s already finely honed mind.
Then John gave him that sad, almost-but-not-quite tremulous smile that fooled precisely no one.
'Damn!'
"Oh, I hope it doesn't scar your handsome face," continued Mummy. "And Good Lord, just look at your shoulder! It's bleeding, too. You could have been killed by flying debris, John. I recently read an account of a poor woman who was impaled and killed by flying debris in a terrible cyclone in Oklahoma."
Where was John? What could he have been thinking? Another bolt of lightning struck nearby and the thunder crashed again. Sherlock bit his lip, looking in vain for clues. He despaired of finding anything in the gathering dark and heavy downpour.
"Well, would you prefer paracetamol or ibuprofen?"
"Yes. No..."
"Oh God, the issues that will be fatal in six months or less?"
"...the Yanks are always so generous."
(Embarrassing) thought Sherlock as he observed his friend's observation. (yet intriguing,)
"...so we'll have to pass on the scones."
'Which is probably a bit not good,' thought John, as he blew gently and skillfully on the pebbled bud, before he nuzzled it, rubbing his face against Sherlock's sculpted chest and gaining Sherlock's stuttering approval.
"You mean the gas? It happens, but not every night."
"Sorry, I know," agreed the genius. "I think too fast for you to keep up."
"What? What? " repeated the detective. "What did you say? I believe that I may have missed something."
'Lullabies are idiotic,' thought Sherlock with a sneer. 'What on earth would Elizabeth do with a mockingbird or a mirror?'
'Oh GOD! Maybe it's me.' thought John, loosening his hold on Sherlock's neck. 'Maybe I can't even kiss right anymore. I should say something-anything. What, what the hell should I say?'
'Apparently, even natural bottoms do become sore after all,' thought the resident genius. 'And even former army doctors can become over-worked, over-tired and over-wrought.'
John blinked, smiling, no John was grinning.
"You two are French?" asked Mummy, who didn't mind being nosy.
"John, are you having difficulty breathing?" asked Sherlock, timing the respirations.
Heavy breathing could be a sign of pneumonia. Mental confusion could be a sign of a brain abscess. Add in John's fever and this did not bode well.
(Oh, I WAS RIGHT.) thought Sherlock again. He did not notice that he was repeating himself, probably because he was high on John. (I was soooo right. John is most definitely a natural bottom. And such a good, tight bottom. And just as responsive and just as receptive as I'd imagined…actually, John is much more responsive and receptive than I imagined. And I was definitely right. Right about John-my John. John. John John,) repeated the detective who for once did not find reiteration dull, but after all, how could anything be dull when it concerned John.
"Never mind," said Sherlock, awkwardly patting his leprechaun's back. "Mummy likes you, so I can use her against him, if my fat brother tries to cause trouble."
John, despite being a natural bottom with submissive tendencies, was also decidedly stubborn once his mind was made up. The former captain lowered his brows, flexed his muscles and pulled his lanky lover into the bathroom.
'I'm an idiot,' he thought to himself in humiliation. 'I'll have to take Lizzy and move out of London. We'll have to move to the ends of the earth-to someplace where no one reads British gossip rags. We'll have to move to America-to some place like Cleveland...or Duluth...or, God forbid, New Jersey.'
John raised a finger, probably intending to convery 'got it in one’. But in the dark, it was hard to make out John’s primitive attempts at sign language, and it seemed as though John had used his middle finger and not his index finger, which would obviously change the entire meaning of the sign, Sherlock was well aware that John had picked up several unsavory Americanisms while serving along side U. S. soldiers in Afghanistan, including the single digit version of the two-fingered salute.
Sherlock frowned, "For how long?"
"He has papers, Mycroft," said Sherlock mildly, while showing his teeth like a barracuda.
Then John smiled, unaware of how terribly Avaril brewed coffee. The blond sprite, whose gorgeous blue eyes were glued to Avaril's ugly green eyes, was just lifting the mug to his lips when a deep, velvety voice interrupted.
"Fionn? Do you expect me to believe that you met Fionn mac Cumahill and somehow managed to escape—and then live to tell about it?" Mycroft demanded in disbelief.
As it happened, John wasn't about to be violently ill; however, the short blond did look as if he might behave violently.
"Sherlock! It…he…is glowing!" snapped Mycroft. His hands opened and shut aimlessly, no doubt missing the reassurance of his faithful umbrella.
John recalled the last time he had dealt with a troublesome cabbie and felt more than a bit empowered.
"Don't attempt to distract me, Sherlock," snarled Mycroft. "I don't know a thing about this man. I doubt you know the truth about him. He's hiding his past for a reason."
'How? How could he possibly have...'
"Yes, I was thinking about that, while watching the videos on tooth extractions and root canal procedures. Anyway, I think my discomfort is caused by my resentment that you are sick and unable to provide me with your usual supports such as tea and biscuits."
Then John said, "But Fionn's legendary unsavory habits aren't important right now."
"Sherlock?" asked John, raising his brows hopefully.
John held up one finger, 'got it in one' again.
Of course, that just made the doctor think about sex all the more. He thought about sex with a man. About sex with a man who was tall, and strong and amazingly intelligent and virile and so damn close that John could have reached out his hand and touched HIS knee, and then HIS thigh, and then...
"I wouldn't be here at all, except that you manipulated, lied and finally kidnapped us…"
Somewhat to Sherlock's surprise, John's frown faded quickly and he snuggled in closer.
"Ah pwomise to dwink some mo' in a bit," said John. "And She'wock... thank you."
'I must have been an idiot to think that Sherlock was a virgin or that he was really married to his work. I am an idiot to have wasted all this time not kissing every inch of Sherlock Holmes," thought John.
Having bestowed a kiss on the smaller man’s forehead, Sherlock subsided. He felt justifiably smug over his progress in overcoming his irrational aversion to John’s indispostion. He was confident that John would be properly impressed and grateful when he was a little less cranky.
'No. No, no, no, cases under five-unlimited sex. Fives and sixes-limited sex on an as need basis. Cases seven and above-no sex, except in a dire emergency or during one of those long drawn out cases, when John forces me to slow down my brain by eating anyway. After the mind-numbing effects following the consumption of a sandwich, sex will hardly have any additional adverse effect on my genius.'
He looked for clothes. He would talk with Mary, in no uncertain terms, but not in a sheet...well, why not in a sheet? What did clothing matter, in comparison to John and Elizabeth's safety.
"Really? And just who is this
'The man might look like six-feet of unbridled sex but what if The World's Only Consulting Detective is inexperienced or actually a virgin or asexual or afraid of sex or just afraid to be touched,' thought John. 'It's fine. I'll go slow. I'll be patient, go only as far as Sherlock wants. I don't mind.'
"No," muttered Sherlock, who feared that his leprechaun had forgotten himself and was performing magic. John was supposed to keep his magical abilities secret for fear that someone (i.e. Mycoft) would discover it and then seek to exploit it. Sherlock lurched up and then raced to the kitchen, nearly knocking his brother over.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed, he wanted much more than an affectionate peck. He could get an affectionate peck from Molly any day. From John, he wanted more. He wanted everything.
In case you haven't noticed:this story is not series compliant nor are the characters 'in character". But since John is a leprechaun, you should have deduced that already.
He held his blogger close, yet he couldn't help but notice that John was abnormally warm. This was only to be expected, given that John was running a low-grade fever. However, John was also a bit sweaty. This might have been expected, yet it was a bit repugnant too.
John bestowed a watery smile on the younger man, before shuffling back to the bedroom.
Whatever his brother had been about to say was lost as the storm unleashed its full fury on the two siblings. Bolts of lightning burst around them; the wind and thunder roared, sounding like a cavalcade of riders pounding towards them.
Besides, even Sherlock thought it would be rude to set a guest on fire at Mummy's tea party. He placed a restraining hand on the leprechaun's shoulder, while suggesting that they change out of their wet clothes.
"...on fire? No, not really," said John, grumbling around another Jammy Dodger. "Not easily. But I can give him a dose of vitality, which will leave a nasty taste in his mouth. You saw how he backed down. He's..."
Sherlock could care less.
"It's the first time we had sex together, the first time you bottomed with anyone...you are a natural at it, too..."
"Second to the last one...ever," murmured John, tilting his head so that he could receive more kisses, while threading his fingers through Sherlock's disastrously tousled curls. The curls felt like silk, wet and sexy.
"Bah, you've spent too long playing spy games, Mycroft," sneered the younger brother. "Through no fault of his own, he is wanted by someone…"
"Ah'll just lie back on my own piwwows," offered John, guessing the problem in one. The blond tried to roll away but was stopped when Sherlock's strong arms tightened around him.
have you
"Which is why you were one hour and fifty-eight minutes late," said Sherlock.
"While the scones smell..." said twin number one (the female).
know the twins and especially, Richard Talbot?" asked Mycroft, smiling appreciatively at Sherlock's lover.
Sherlock paled, "What do you know of it?"
"No, it's all right," said Sherlock reaching out for one more smoke.
"I think with time, I could get used to tending to you when you're sick. It reminds me…"
"...and frequent…"
"...for you."
"Bloody hell, Sherlock!" said John in a loud whisper, "You startled me!"
John still hadn't brought up the sugar, let alone refreshed Sherlock's now cold tea. And where was dinner? It was nearly half nine.
The World's Only Consulting Detective patiently adjusted the cover slip on top of the slide. He carefully slid the preparation under the microscope. He studied the stained hepatocytes, and then scribbled his findings in the notebook. He was focused, his mind like a machine.
The doctor was very quiet.
This thought made Sherlock nervous. What if John was choking? Oh, surely not. John wasn't incapacitated enough to choke on his own vomit. Unless...unless his fever had reached dangerous levels, but this was unlikely with a simple abscessed tooth. Was it unlikely? Maybe he should research it on line.
xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo
John sighed, resigned to following Sherlock, despite his misgivings.
… And Sherlock commented on John's new shampoo, which Mary had purchased and which John was NEVER to use again, because it made John smell like a fruit salad. And Sherlock had a much better hair product in mind, one which would make John smell like sex, and which he'd use on John's hair when they showered before picking up Elizabeth...
"Not that."
"As usual, John, you look awful," said Sherlock instantly and insensitively.
"It isn't your Cousin Prudence," said John, leaning tiredly against Sherlock. "You know, you could both see much better if you actually used your Faery-sight properly."
'I'll never be able to show my face again in London,' thought the humiliated doctor, 'because even the cabbies and newsboys are laughing at me behind my back. Stupid, how could I have been so stupid? I should have dropped Mary the day HE came back. I should never have married her when I loved HIM. I should have let Magnusson have her...no, wait I'm forgetting about Lizzy. It was all worth it for Lizzy, even having to live in New Jersey is worth it.'
At first, the condition didn't seem very serious, and Sherlock wondered why John was behaving like such a baby. Common infection…Blah, blah, blah… Could be a sign of poor oral hygiene—not bloody likely in John's case. The man was a clean freak. The infection could be very painful (well, maybe that explained some of John's irritability). The condition was usually treated with antibiotics (hardly surprising) and root canal (Ouch!)
There had to be some other solution.
"John," said Sherlock. "No one is getting into my pants."
"First of all, stick to small words, John,” said Sherlock. “Preferably, words without liquid consonants.”
"John, he's just trying to get a rise out of you. Mycroft said the vampires won't bite without written consent," reassured Sherlock, feeling fairly certain that Mycroft was right, because Mycroft was almost always right.
"John, stay with me," demanded Sherlock.
Instead, his blogger sat, smiled and looked…different. It was puzzling. Sherlock had an irrational urge to go to John and hold him, except Sherlock never cuddled anyone…except of course Elizabeth, who looked like a miniature John Watson, but who wouldn't squeal about not being gay. The puzzled detective stood up abruptly saying, "I shall get you the ice bag for the contusion on your head."
"...just before coming here…"
(Aside from your head wound, John, for which she WILL PAY…somehow), thought the younger man.
John smiled again as the words echoed throughout his head, 'I've left her; it's done with…I've left her; it's done with. I left..."
The twins too, worriedly eyed John's hands as they hissed at Richard to "come away" and "stop making trouble" and "this is a tea party…" "…where are your manners?" Each of them tugged on Richard's absurdly melodramatic black cape.
'Was it three times? Really. Damn, I wouldn't have thought Little John had it in him,' thought the doctor proudly.
"Perhaps…” Mycroft murmured.
"How's this?" asked John.
(No, he doesn't seem hurt, or upset. And he's kissing me again; using his lips, tongue, teeth...John (MY John) doesn't really want to stop-so not a sexual identity crisis then. My John probably thinks he's being a gentleman, when really he's just being an idiot (MY idiot. My idiot forever.)
"Don't be an idiot, John," said the detective. "Elizabeth is with Mrs. Hudson. Besides, Mycroft is always monitoring..."
"Oh, yes…"
An eldritch, pale blue light flickered from inside the copse.
'God, this…this is heaven,' thought the doctor closing his eyes and sighing in a sort of wistful contentment, and pulling the borrowed dressing gown shut. The robe kept slipping open without warning; silk was such tricky, slippery stuff. But it was soft and smelled of his best friend, so John secretly reveled in it, while making sure that it stayed tied shut.
(Not to mention, if you hurt Lestrade. I would be forced to retaliate.) said Mycroft, with a significant look at the short blond, who'd just finished his prepared speech.
"She'wock. Ah was twying to sweep," croaked the miserable, angry, flushed specimen of humanity, who clenched his fists in a most telling manner. "Pwease, pwease just let me sweep."
First, he was moaning a lot. He'd never been this vocal before. He'd never been this hard before either.
"Seriously, John?" spat Sherlock, who felt as if his bond with John were under attack from all angles tonight. "Is he more important to you than I am?"
"I can see him glow when he's using magic. And apparently so can you," explained Sherlock. "John thinks it's
battered within an inch of my life," complained Mycroft. "And Sherlock is probably hurt too; he fell."
The doctor's hand began to caress Sherlock's leg in clear violation of the minimal touching rule. The detective magnanimously decided to overlook the indiscretion, hoping to be violated further.
"Ta, fo' that," muttered John, as his arms automatically re-assumed their defensive position across his chest.
"See, even you can't come up with a good reason, John."
"...because Mortimer is coming," said his alluring blond twin.
He glanced casually at the clock, noting that his doctor was now one hour and thirty-seven minutes late, not that it mattered much. Sherlock enjoyed having John around but would never admit this, besides it wasn’t as if Sherlock couldn’t fend for himself.
Sherlock reared back as if stung. (Always in love with someone else. Always? That implies a romance of longstanding duration,) thought Sherlock. (Has my John been pining for that Sarah all these years...No, that's just stupid...Maybe, maybe he loves Sholto. Mary implied that John and Sholto...)
Sherlock shook John's arm, just in case the mysterious stranger was magical. He feared that the handsome stranger might be compelling Sherlock's leprechaun with some sort of spell. Hopefully, John wasn’t simply overcome by the man’s masculine beauty. In the process, John spilled more of his coffee, making Avaril cry out in disappointment.
Sherlock's mind palace went dark and utterly silent, as his neurons ceased to function.
I still don't own the rights to Sherlock.
At least John would hate the coffee as much as Sherlock did; that was some consolation, thought the detective, as the hot piss burned his mouth.
The point being, John did not have that crazed, rabid my-daughter-is-sick and somebody-better-fix-it-now look on his face. So probably not sick then.
...Then the genius started deducing into John's over-sensitized ear again. He deduced John's appendectomy scar.
'Well a mirror of course has its uses, but that's a moot point; John would never let the baby hold a mirror, due to safety concerns. But a mockingbird? An infant had no use at all for a songbird. It would be dangerous for both the baby and the bird and highly unsanitary. It was doubly ridiculous, because mockingbirds were not even indigenous to Britain. Oh, wait. It was hard to determine with John's hoarse voice, but this seemed to be a new melody. Well, when I say melody...what the devil is a baby bunting? Are we back to birds? How predictable. How dull.'
"Yes," said John hesitantly. "Yes, of course, you can handle it. Of course you can..." His voice trailed off and he dry scrubbed his face with both hands. "I'm just...I guess I'm just tired. Really tired and..."
"Yeah, Ah do. How about my PTSD, like when Ah ova-weact to ce’tain noises and ce’tain news stowies? Mm? How about my nightma’es?"
Overhead, Elizabeth grizzled half-heartedly. The creaking sound indicated that John was utilizing the rocking chair, which Mycroft had delivered, after making sneering comments about Sherlock's goldfish. Surprisingly, John had almost immediately understood that he was the goldfish in question. Not surprisingly, he had wanted to punch Mycroft, and for some bizarre reason, Sherlock as well. Then, suppressing his violent tendencies, John had resolved to 'get some air'. Fortuitously, Mrs. Hudson's well-timed arrival with Miss Elizabeth Shirley Watson had prevented John's furious departure.
"Well, I think it is," Mycroft and Sherlock responded in tandem.
"What did you do?" growled Sherlock, looking for his missing partner. "And where is John Watson?"
"John," Sherlock breathed into the leprechaun's ear, "is this Mr. Death?"
Oh No, Not Another Sic Fic
No, if the stoic ex-soldier admitted that his jaw hurt, then he must be in a great deal of pain.
Of course, the first two questions were the product of wishful thinking (meaning delusional thinking) on John's part. The final two questions were unnecessary. The doctor assumed that his dearest friend had already deduced all the salient points and was waiting to spring it all on John, whenever it would be the most dramatic. And this made John very happy indeed.
It was quiet. Ominously quiet. Too quiet. There wasn't even any snoring...wait, wrong. John was snoring softly, just like always, which was good. Breathing wasn't dull when it was John doing the breathing.
"…and then Cleveland…"
The World's Only Consulting Detective sat in a defensive, rather unattractive ball on the spindly and amazingly uncomfortable chair. It was surely the only uncomfortable chair in his parents' sitting room. He was quite certain that Mycroft had deliberately maneuvered him into said chair to see him suffer more than he normally would have, during this tea party from hell (more commonly known a 'little gathering to introduce John to the family)'.
“A woof?” asked Sherlock, momentarily confused. “Oh! You mean a wolf…Surely not a werewolf?”
"Ah'm wawm enough," said John, who was being stubbornly stoic again.
He gave Sherlock a slightly watery smile, then looked at the downy-headed, rosy-cheeked baby in his arms. "See, she's already fallen back to sleep," said John, apropos of nothing.
Without further commentary, John filled the kettle with water and switched it on. He silently washed out two mugs because the sink was filled with dirty dishes. Why hadn't John done the washing up this morning? It would have saved him time later.
"Aunt Penelope!" interrupted Mycroft, gliding over to Sherlock and his aunt like a vampire from a cheap horror flick. "Have you met Sherlock's young man? He's in the kitchen, I believe, demonstrating his uncanny ability to make tea." Mycroft tugged at his Aunt's large, flabby arm and sent her off toward the kitchen, where most of the party had gathered, apparently to watch John Watson make cup after cup of perfect tea.
"...tonight..."
'God I LOVE this shirt,' thought John, gently sliding the shirt apart.
"Many firsts?" asked John recklessly.
"Their trysts made it into the gossip columns, John," explained the detective. "It will be simpler to list the people who didn't know: such as people currently in a coma, or people living Tibet and who also do not have access to the Internet, or you, or..."
I don't own the rights to BBC Sherlock or any of their characters.
Only moments ago, John had been right next to him. Actually, John had been draped over the World's Only Consulting Detective in boneless, semiconscious post-coital bliss.
"You and Mary argued, again," said the younger man, beginning the deductions. "A bad argument, again. Your mobile phone was killed when it deflected the bullet...no...the knife...no..."
"Yes, yes, yes, John," interrupted the now eager detective, "I understand that you are uncomfortable expressing your emotions, yet you feel the need to emote, so please just spit it out."
Richard's smirk faded into a frown of concern. Most of the guests were already stepping back to give the belligerent blond room to fight the cool brunet. Sherlock just hoped his relatives didn't see that John's hands were filling with light instead of preparing for fisticuffs.
"You are haggard," countered Sherlock.
The detective's fingers drummed on the arm of the chair, trying to decide how soon to schedule the first sex holiday, then a horrible thought occurred.
… Little John was rutting to be honest against a lean, firm, smartly dressed thigh, which had driven itself in between John's legs, presumably for just that purpose. And there was more.
"Tea, anyone? Or scones? I managed to save a few," offered Mummy, pushing between John and his visitors with a tea tray and wagging her brows significantly at her younger son.
"That's not what you said last week when I stopped the wrong bellboy in the Falstaff case."
There were no kidnappers. Obvious.
Well, of course he cared about John.
"Shite," muttered Sherlock. So much for keeping his brother ignorant of John's otherworldliness.
"It seems like you have my life all planned out," John murmured into his lover's pale, nearly hairless broad chest.
"Well, yes it does, actually," said John sounding like the voice of reason as he explained the unreasonable.
"He looks ridiculous flitting around in that cape," said the detective, leaning down to mutter into his shorter partner's ear. "No doubt he thinks he looks all dramatic and mysterious when it swirls around him."
He'd only been practicing the adagio for about thirty-nine minutes, when the bedroom door banged open. Sherlock hoped that John wasn't about to be violently ill again, because that was gross.
Sherlock vastly prefered grumpy over that eerie monotone voice that John had approached them with. He drew John close to shelter him from the cold rain and from Mycroft.
Sherlock frowned as his brother shook his head. (Damn Mycroft for out deducing me again!).
?” Sherlock demanded. He felt that he was remaining surprisingly calm, all things considered.
Someone moaned.
"No, she was surprised that the baby was actually mine. Even she was sure it was David's."
"Why me? Why do I have to get cleaned up and he doesn't?" said the doctor, clutching the twisted sheets in front of himself and missing all the significant data-as usual.
Finally he managed to take a breath and whisper a very hoarse, "What?"
"More like a wolf," said John. "We better get back to the house."
Both Watsons are now over tired and teary-eyed, noted Sherlock. He felt a bit overwhelmed at the thought of two people depending on him, even though he was a high-functioning sociopath, known far and wide for his lack of empathy and caring.
Sherlock was able to deduce that John and
Sherlock wanted John to bite him. He wanted them to be biting each other, among other things.
“No?"
"Mary, lied a lot, remember? Besides," grumbled John. "M'not even sure she heard Lizzy cry at night. Mary was always real tired, I guess that's to be expected what with her lovers and moonlighting as an assassin and all."
"I find it repugnant that my younger sibling should be partnering with a man who has no past, no records, no papers of any kind," snapped Mycroft, who had spent countless hours trying to discover John Watson's true identity, all in vain.
"...when he tried to drink my blood," nodded John.
"No, not bothering me...but..."
Sherlock's scowl deepened as his boyfriend practically
, John," said the unctuous baritone. His voice was as slippery as Mycroft’s albeit deeper. "They just don't understand the most basic concepts—like when one is compelled to follow one's fate."
Baby monitor.
Wait...had something happened this morning? Perhaps Sherlock had accidentally deleted an argument, but that was unlikely. Sherlock had been at pains not to delete any interactions with John, since that only resulted in more arguments. No...Sherlock was pretty sure that there hadn't been any disagreements. Perhaps Sherlock, through no fault of his own, had offended his partner?
"we've just returned…"
He grinned sweetly at the taller man who had stopped talking and who now frowned. John's smile faded.
"I will not wake her," whispered Sherlock, holding the bundle of blankets close to his chest. "and if I do, I will deal with it."
"Yeah. Ah am docta'," said John.
"My bweathing? It's fine," said John, leaning back with a sigh.
Father stuck a faded canvas Tilley hat on his son's head. Sherlock turned toward the door but was blocked by Mummy.
"Yes, of course, that would be James," said the consulting detective offhandedly, because he was still trying to deduce the 'Why?'
John frowned, clenching his injured hands; a tiny bit of light leaked out from his fists. "Yes, I did meet Fionn. I've met him many times, and obviously I lived to tell about it." The 'so there' remained in subtext.
"Just for the record, John," said Sherlock, "There'll be no kissing until the infection is completely gone, because the infection is in your mouth and kissing would be gross.”
"Shouldn't we return to the house?" asked John.
John nodded helplessly, or maybe his head was jerked up and down as she scrubbed his short blond hair dry.
"Ha, everyone knows Phillip can't perform magic," piped in young Leonora, turning against her cousin with true Holmesian disdain. Anything to gain attention, it was a familial fault. "It's not as though everyone didn't know that I was making the lights blink."
Actually, the experiment with the liver samples wasn't as interesting as he'd hoped. In fact, he decided to table the mess until later. Unless John got to it first and chose to clean it himself. It certainly wouldn't be Sherlock's fault if John chose to clean up the mess before Sherlock had a chance to do so.
"And can you really set him…"
John groaned, adorably.
He also hoped that his brother, the British government, didn't notice John's golden aura. Mycroft would be first in line to abduct and then 'study' a magical leprechaun like John. Then the poncy bureaucrat would probably want to weaponize Sherlock's boyfriend—or worse.
"Sherlock," Mycroft shouted into his ear, pointing to the wood lot behind the Holmes family home.
"John broke his phone with his head. I turned my phone off because I do not want to be disturbed when I'm having sex with John," said Sherlock.
Sherlock had gotten almost as wet as John, but John seemed to tolerate the cold poorly. He was always wearing multiple layers of clothing—favoring heavy, shapeless jumpers. The sprite had once mentioned that the weather in Faerie was always warm and temperate, except for the two obligatory months of winter when the snow fell in perfect drifts like one might see on a Christmas card.
that lovable," John stoutly asserted. "He's very lovable, and I love him, and that for you and your insults towards the finest man that I have ever met." John snapped his fingers under Mycroft's nose before turning his back on the British government.
"John, you and Mrs. Hudson have given me numerous lessons on the care and feeding of human infants. I believe I can handle it."
"The night one of us dies!"
"No! That is NOT why i'm blushing. And I'm certainly not adorable," said the doctor adorably.
'Dear Lord, the cabbies will have a field day if they find out about 'Little John', thought the doctor. 'Then again, if someone as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes is interested in me, then why the hell should I care about what cabbies or newsboys think. Bloody hell, I KNOW how to deal with troublesome cabbies, don't I? Well, don't I?'
'Captain! We are now running on auto-pilot!'
...Sherlock deduced that John went to the bank yesterday.
"Oh, well, now that she's gone back to work..."
John smiled, because it was true, he was an idiot.
“What do you mean?"
'Mycroft warned me that this would happen,' thought the detective with a sour, almost Mycroft-ish look, 'He warned me that sentiment is detrimental to logical thinking. The recent and repeated sexual intercourse between me and my blogger must have addled my brain. We shall have to forego all further intimacy if I am to retain my unparalleled mental acuity .'
Sherlock assumed his thinking pose while John croaked out some tuneless prattle, no doubt a mind-numbing lullaby. The detective resolved to stop that nonsense as soon as possible, before it permanently damaged Elizabeth's developing nervous system.
'Sherlock's plan may be bad news for Mary,' considered the doctor, as he ministered to the other side of his detective's chest. "But what's that to me? After all, she isn't very nice. She's not any nicer than that cabbie. Of course I could handle her myself. I really don't need Sherlock to protect me...although it's kind of hot when he does get all alpha male protective on me. Yeah...hot.'
"Well..." prompted John.
John nodded respectfully at the representative of Her Majesty's government. Sherlock frowned harder; John was not supposed to gaze at his brother with respect. He also accepted half of another finger sandwich from John.
"Yes, and no. Same issues. However, we are 70% certain that she'll not only succeed but even survive," said the detective. "And if she does survive. Mycroft will probably be able to keep her and Sholto busy overseas for several years..."
"Oh, She'wock," said John. Clearly, Sherlock had managed to say something right because the doctor was thawing rapidly. He started to roll over to hug the younger man, then pulled back. "Oh, sowwy. I forgot the ‘no touching when I'm sick’ wule."
God, 'I've missed this' thought John feeling irrationally pleased. 'Sherlock will deduce everything.' (Well, hopefully, not THAT. Everything except THAT. Except THAT is what I came here to tell him. Still, I'm sure he won't deduce THAT, and when I do tell him THAT, he'll be shocked. Then he'll say he's flattered (but not really mean it), and he'll say he's married to his work, which is fine. I don't mind, really. Then we'll get back to normal-almost. But he'll know the truth. I won't have to live in fear that he's going to deduce my stupid feelings for him at the absolute worst possible time. And there's always the possibility that he'll want me too...or not. Which is fine...just fine...)
Father sympathetically patted Mycroft's shoulder before handing his son a hideous green rain slicker and stuffing a matching hat on top of the British Government's head. Once he was appropriately attired, Father opened the door, which flew out of his hand from the wind, nearly slamming into Avaril. The two brothers stumbled out, to be swallowed up by the gale.
The detective's aversion now mixed with guilt. After all, he loved the man in his arms. Nevertheless, it was impossible to ignore the sweat seeping into Sherlock’s shirt.
The Holmes brothers overlooked his protest "Mm, I wonder then...why is that vampire looking over here and licking his lips?" asked Sherlock.
"But you're sure about us moving in someday soon?"
Sherlock automatically found this a tiny bit arousing too.
'Coward,' thought Sherlock, as Mycroft abandoned his brother to face the repugnant fussing alone—as usual. He didn't count John, because John seemed to like the fussing.
The leprechaun stared at Mycroft as if only now recognizing him. The blond blinked rapidly, his eyes glittering as the sky lit up again.
The doctor squirmed, complained that he was fine, and then allowed Sherlock to place the bag of frozen peas on his head, after first ensuring that it was indeed only a sealed bag of legumes and not a bag of frozen body parts like last time.
"Can you?" Sherlock snapped back.
“No, you git," said John, jabbing his elbow into Sherlock's side, but without much force. "Ah meant…"
"I knew it," said Sherlock scowling furiously.
"Now what's wrong?" he asked.
"Oh. That. Well, Fionn is a lusty man and wants to have his way with practically everyone. It's common knowledge."
"I was looking for you. I need fresh tea; my cup is cold, and we're still out of sugar." Sherlock couldn't ask about dinner because of his well-known negative stance on food.
"Mmmm," agreed Sherlock ambiguously. Then, just to make sure that John didn't trick him into any promises about quitting smoking altogether, Sherlock changed the subject. "What color do you want Elizabeth's room to be?"
Hope to see you all next week with chapter 3.
John sat in the old armchair (his old armchair), sipping his tea, which had been steeped the right way (not her way).
"Yes, yes, yes..." soothed the pretty young man, pursing his lips.
That was less than helpful, thought Sherlock, as he tried to sneak his boyfriend away.
John's blue eyes seemed to grow cold, which was physically impossible, and yet the younger man felt distinctly chilled.
"She was surprised that you doubted her, after her blatant affair with David?"
"She'wock! Ah wuv you vewy much, and Ah appweciate yo’ effowts, but would you pwease shut up now!”
"The storm pushed you," claimed the waterlogged British government. "I'm fairly certain that your head struck the ground. You probably have a concussion."
The Holmes matriarch held out her hand, and Leonora slapped another towel into it. John's hair was roughly tousled by Mummy's efficient toweling off. Like his older brother, Sherlock was not above throwing John under the bus—when said bus was Mummy.
"No, John," said the detective. "We are not moving to New Jersey... Not unless there is a case that's a ten-an absolute ten, not an almost ten. And even then, even with a ten, we could only reside in New Jersey temporarily."
...and for the first time John realized that Sherlock always called Lizzy, Elizabeth.
"Yet when I do manage to overcome my pathological aversions, you respond to comfort like a wilted flower,” said the genius.
Mummy tutted some more and patted John's face dry. Sherlock was truly uncomfortable with Mummy touching his leprechaun and making John look so shaggable. It wasn't right. It was Oedipal or something, and it had to stop.
Neither of the boys could get a word in edgewise, nor could they enter the house with Mummy planted squarely in the doorway.
Sherlock heard the apology and saw John stiffen his already stiff back. (Clearly,) thought the detective, (John is finding it hard to say goodbye to me. At least his friendship towards me remains undiminished... The question remains, who? Who does John love?...Probably Lestrade. He's always admired Lestrade. And the man is moderately fit.)
John glared and imagined all the cabbies laughing at him behind his back...with the newspaper boys no less.
"I thought you knew. Everyone knows,' Sherlock announced with militant nonchalance, because everyone did know, well almost everyone...
"What, so you can mock me?" said John, torn between anger and sadness and frustration and the fear that he'd have to really move to the U.S.A. without Sherlock. However, John Watson could refuse Sherlock nothing, and he sighed in defeat. "Fine. You are a git, and I also love you...and not like a brother, as I was trying to tell you."
"You're soaked to the bone. Give me some towels!" she ordered.
"What about Cleveland?" asked John, after a short pause.
Recovering from his initial shock, John rose up on his toes, and attacked Sherlock's soft, pink, pouty lips, which had figured so prominently in the doctor's fantasies. Now John could lick and taste the real thing. Now he finally, finally could suck on that delectable Cupid's bow. And now those large, talented hands were running up and down his sides, which was distracting-but in a good way. John didn't mind. He liked it. He relished Sherlock's touch.
Then he angrily brushed that thought aside, because it didn't matter. John required protection. Even if John chose Mary over Sherlock, Sherlock would ensure that the abuse would stop. Now.
"Just so, John," agreed the detective, missing the patient’s dry tone. "It is preferable to have some sense of constancy and routine. You know…I have to admit, that so long as we are not too close together, spending time with you while you’re sick is tolerable. Possibly even pleasant.”
The sickly doctor smiled crookedly and gazed up at Sherlock in adoration. Sherlock felt a frisson of warmth from the heat in John’s eyes.
"To join him on his murderous rampages?" sneered the British government.
"But surely John wouldn't go outside now, not when it's about to storm. See, it's already raining," said Mummy. "Besides, the scones are done."
"Behave yourself, brother!" hissed Mycroft without moving his smiling lips.
"Mmmm?" Responded the smug detective.
Sherlock hadn't felt any weird attraction for the vampire, so he wondered if the vampire really was casting a glamour as John asserted. However, the detective did feel a twinge of conceited pleasure when John became jealous on his account, so he let the matter be. He was also proud of John for discovering that Sherlock had hidden cigarettes in his coat.
"I thought you probably already knew—after all, you have the Faerie-sight, as does your brother,” said John. "Nevertheless, the next time I see one, I'll point him out to you—or her."
"No! God, no. She's never, ever hurt Lizzy, you know that! And I've been very careful when I'm alone with Mary, since… Well, as I said, I got the knife away from her and as you can see, there's no damage done," said John, dropping the frozen peas and holding open his hands as if to display his supposedly un-damaged condition.
"I only wanted to kiss you and make the hurt all better," taunted the tall, pale man whose dramatic cheekbones looked artificial to Sherlock. He suspected that the man must have had cosmetic surgery to augment his zygomatic arches. He was ready to announce this to everyone, but stopped because John was snarling like the fierce little bull pup that the leprechaun had wanted to borrow from the pet store last week.
"And so can you. Fine. We'll discuss it later. John is injured and needs…"
"You are not moving to New Jersey," said the consulting detective decisively.
The doctor's capable fingers circled a nipple, then rubbed gently, then rubbed harder, eliciting a deep, dark groan from his lover, followed by sub-sonic words of encouragement.
"I...I...I mean, I assume you can't talk properly because your jaw hurts?" said Sherlock, hoping to forestall any violence or tears—especially the tears.
Of course it was impossible to see in the dark, but Sherlock assumed that his doctor must have begun scowling, because Sherlock easily detected a drop in room temperature.
"Easily solved," said the determined detective, who unbuckled his belt to remove said trousers.
Sherlock fell back into his chair, deeply disappointed. He didn't want to give up further sexual relations with John. He liked having sexual relations with John. He really, liked having his blogger stretched out underneath him writhing with pleasure and passion. He particularly liked burying himself deep inside the man he loved.
'God, I love his voice,' thought John. 'I love being brilliant too."
"Noooo, but if John really is Fae—of which I have yet to be convinced—then he can probably defend himself from a single vampire," said the bureaucrat superciliously.
"...that we find in the cities…" added Adrien.
…Sherlock had boldly grabbed his arse, and was squeezing it. And John rather liked this too. He liked this very much, which was why...
"A day of many firsts, John," said Sherlock kissing his soon-to-be husband, but wisely refraining from any mention of Operation: Two-Men-a-Baby-and-a-Wedding, the name having been selected by Mrs. Hudson and Mummy, after Sherlock rejected Operation: Reluctant-Bridegrooms (a stupid name because one of the bridegrooms, Sherlock Holmes to be precise, was anything but reluctant.)
Mummy looked at Father, who nodded.
Perhaps, if he knew more about the infection, he'd feel better about the whole thing. He decided to Google tooth abscesses. At the very least, it would pass time, and he might learn some helpful tips to pass on to John later.
"What?" asked Sherlock.
"I don't need any more warnings or portents," said John ungraciously, "unless you plan to give me something specific to go on."
"Good, you're awake," said Sherlock. "I just wanted to know, why did you think I was a vampire?”
"Three. They're all three vampires," said John. "And I just told you; I didn't invite them; they invited themselves. The twins are Death's acolytes, so I suppose that explains why they're here. But I have no idea why Richard's here." John pursed his lips as he thought about it. "Nope. Nothing. I really have no idea why he showed up tonight, except to make my life miserable and upset the balance, which he did somehow. Twice, which is really bad. Bloody bloodsucking bastard."
"Hmm?" asked John, wrinkling his forehead in confusion.
Faery-sight," insisted John.
"No, ma'am, a hatchet wouldn't work," said John. "Maybe a wooden stake…"
. Then she commanded silence, which Mycroft ignored saying, "It was John's fault! We were only looking for him after he got lost in the woods like a witless cretin, leaving us to get caught in the downburst. The winds were dreadful: I think it may have been a derecho. It was a miracle that we weren’t hurt.” He scowled at John, ready to throw the leprechaun under the bus, like any good politician would.
(No. John is too quiet, besides John doesn't know his to delete his hard drive, because he's an idiot (my idiot).)
"But Mummy, you forced me to go," Mycroft complained, as she grasped her eldest child by the elbow, dragging him into the candlelit kitchen.
…And Sherlock murmured about how stimulating he found John's firm biceps, not to mention John's firm gluteus.
"Don't be a fool! You can't..."
"I am providing you moral support in your time of need. I will also provide you with warmth via shared body heat."
Holmes the Eldest stuck his head in the pantry, shifting the contents around, as though he expected to find John hiding behind the tins of soup.
"No," said the detective.
"Yes," whispered Sherlock, dragging his fingers through John's hair in anticipation of…
"Oh?" murmured John, "Did you need my help?"
"Oh, God. What's wong now,” said John, sounding annoyed and ever-so-slightly hurt.
"That's because you're an idiot."
The tempest seemed to last forever, but he knew it was only several minutes before the inchoate shrieks died down. The fierce wind began to slow and the thunder and lightning began to head eastward. The worst was past; the rain still came down but in decent, more normal, properly
"As you no doubt…"
"Hmmm," hummed Sherlock.
"It must have been a tornado!” Mycroft yelled.
"Say it again."
"Again, rather a long list..."
Naturally, there was no, 'Good morning, John!'
"Or it could just be gas," said John casting a doctor-knows-best look at Sherlock.
And what about the tea? And the sugar?
At this point, the water would be hot. Then the tea would be steeping, milk and sugar was added and voilà, Sherlock's tea would be served at 18:07 plus or minus five minutes.
(Well, of course John (my John) is always miserable and exhausted. Between caring for a young infant, working in a dull (deadly dull) clinic, and avoiding the attention of that harridan witch, which the doctor (my doctor) stubbornly calls his wife, it's a wonder that John (my John) was able to crawl here at all."
Sherlock Holmes was also content, possibly for the first time in his adult life. He smiled benignly at John's dirty blond head and Elizabeth's white-blond fuzz, each one nestled on one of his shoulders.
The detective was still exploring John's body and still muttering into John's hair, but he stuttered briefly when John discovered Sherlock's rosy-brown nipples, which had been hiding under the silky smooth, purple shirt-of-sex.
"Good."
"You do
, when my
Sherlock could only think of one thing that might make John relax and smile again.
know it, whatever it was. Not to mention, Sherlock had a feeling that this Finn should be placed on the list of Beings Who Wanted John (the original title had been Beings Who Had Shagged John or Who Wanted to Shag John, but that file name was a bit too unwieldy).
Richard, Jacinthe and Adrien, looking deeply offended, stared at Sherlock. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and tilted his head. Perhaps the word bloodsucker might be a pejorative term amongst their kind.
John leaned forward, wearing his rather cute, dropped-jaw, gob-smacked look, while allowing his robe to gape open invitingly. Sherlock hastily reminded himself that John was 'not gay'. Besides a gentleman would never take advantage a man who had just left his assassin wife, not to mention, it was bit not good to peek at the goods of another man who wasn't interested because he 'wasn't gay'.
Someone moaned; John was pretty damned sure that the moan came from his own mouth. His hands had found Sherlock and he clung helplessly to the strong, sinewy arms. Of their own volition, his fingers kneaded firm muscle while Sherlock Holmes ravished him with his lips and tongue, his teeth and...and...and that voice, which simply oozed with chocolate-coated lust.
(See the end of the chapter for
Which returned Sherlock back to the original problem. How to have sex, while not interfering with the genius of the World's Only Consulting Detective?
The elder Holmes grabbed Sherlock's neck and dragged him close, trying to shelter him from the end of the world. The storm howled and shrieked, sucking the air out of Sherlock's lungs as he tried to shout to his brother over the tidal wave of sound.
John blushed and tried to scurry away while combing his hair down with his fingers.
After convincing Mrs. Hudson to make him fresh tea with sugar and a couple of bacon and cheese sandwiches (and after he promised not to pound on her door any more for the rest of the night), Sherlock returned to 221B. He was bored. Normally, he'd be watching one of those tedious reality shows, which were still consistently better than whatever ridiculous shows John wanted to watch—especially football. Occasionally, Sherlock found the reality shows mildly distracting when he could share his observations with an appreciative audience (as long as it was John). Perhaps, Sherlock would go so far as to say it was pleasant to watch the crap telly with a pliant, warm body snuggled up against him (as long as the warm body belonged to John). The detective felt odd, almost sad and practically lonely, but of course he had no reason to be sad or lonely. In all honesty, television was the new opiate for the masses and Sherlock didn't miss cuddling in the slightest. He was relieved, because now didn't have to watch the telly at all. He could do what ever he wanted. He could...finish his experiment...or play the violin!
He looked into the blue room, which was illuminated by a glowing rabbit light fixture. John held the small infant close over his heart, as he rocked in the large wooden rocker. He looked tired, but not overly concerned. Unlike the time when Elizabeth was throwing up all her formula, and Doctor Watson had terrorized the other doctors in the A and E, until Sherlock arrived to terrorize the other doctors for John. Luckily, the problem had been solved by a switch to another formula...
"No, it's not," said John, his mouth twisting for emphasis. "What's important is that Fionn was carrying a message for me, which he delivered right before whipping me."
"Fionn mac Cumhaill, the leader of the Wild Hunt," said John to his lover. "He summoned me."
"Mycroft travels with a full wardrobe of suits," said the younger Holmes, putting an arm around his shivering leprechaun.
"She's Elizabeth's godmother. Mrs. Hudson wants to babysit. She's looking forward to it...and when she's not available, I suppose I could always call on my parents," said Sherlock with a moue of distaste. "They'd be over the moon to babysit Elizabeth, you know."
He placed his hand on John's back, and escorted his boyfriend up the stairs, eager to both strip John out of his wet clothes and to get some answers about Death who was coming to Mummy's tea.
"Since you are not contagious, and I did confirm this online, and since you are looking rather cute, I would like to hold you. It will help warm you up and might even help you sleep."
It was Sherlock's turn to say, “What?"
John pushed his soaking wet sleeves over his nicely muscled forearms and rubbed his still bloodstained hands together, apparently in preparation for the flambé. Indeed, Sherlock could already see a hint of light dancing in John's hands. So...the bonfire might not be an empty threat. Fascinating.
Sadly, HE probably wouldn't want a boring old, single parent like John hanging around, but maybe, once in a while, perhaps, just occasionally, HE'D allow John to help on an occasional case?
(That's it?) thought Sherlock. (After waiting for years, all I get is a stupid little peck on the mouth from John 'Three Continents' Watson, the Casanova of Qandahar?)
*****(Not to mention, if you hurt Lestrade. I would be forced to retaliate.) said mind palace Mycroft, with a significant look at the short blond, who'd just finished his prepared speech.
'But how? How had the kidnappers reached John and the baby without waking me?' he wondered, while looking for clues.
little slip-up is going to haunt us," muttered Sherlock darkly. "He's bound to try to take you away to have you tested in a secret laboratory or something."
(No doubt John is now in the full throes of his 'but I'm not gay' identity crisis. Just listen to those inane apologies,) thought Sherlock. (The little idiot (my idiot) is going to burst into tears any second...He's backing away! NO! NO! NO! I'm losing him! This is intolerable!)
(Don't you mean fool of a detective?) Sherlock asked himself, or rather Mycroft.
"Besides, John, I don't think we have time for our first round of shower sex..." said Sherlock, before the bathroom door slammed shut, muffling the whining voice of Mycroft's little brother.
"I know what I see," said the elder brother. "I see a man besotted, who is being played for a fool by a common con man."
"You pushed me down!" Sherlock protested.
"You would scandalize her for no reason, ruining the party for our parents—again! This is the first family event that you have attended in four years…"
"Wait. I'm what?" said the blond, looking down at his compact hands, which, in addition to glowing, were cut and bleeding. Sherlock grabbed one of John's hands to examine it more closely, "I don't see any glow," muttered John sounding grumpy now.
," he sneered. He whirled around, and his cape followed like a dark cloud of outrage, before he stalked off to lurk in a corner of the sitting room like a large bat.
The tall detective left his bemused friend in the sitting room as he strode into the kitchen to retrieve the bag of frozen peas, which was used as an ice bag. He carefully checked to ensure that it was the frozen peas and not the bag of frozen bile stones. He did not want a repeat of last month's debacle, when a similar bag containing frozen, sectioned toes defrosted and leaked all over John's trousers. John had been quite displeased at the mess, (Sherlock had expected that John would try to punch him again.) And Mary…Mary had looked so smug and superior, taunting Sherlock with her smirk, as if to say 'You don't deserve him; you could never take care of John properly, you FREAK.'
"Your head isn't even very sweaty and it’s no more heavy than usual.”
Sherlock flinched like a cat at her touch and pulled the towel away from Mummy, muttering that he wasn't a child, and death would be preferable to all this annoying hubbub.
Sherlock sighed, "Good night, John.”
Sherlock ignored his father's questions and shook free of his father's hand. Obviously, he couldn't reveal that John was in fact a magical being, who was more than capable of disappearing in front of everyone. Sherlock didn't give a damn what his father was saying now; the detective was too busy trying not to panic. He had deduced that John was in some sort of magical danger (why else disappear without telling Sherlock), and Sherlock had to find his leprechaun
Chapter 2
"Come along, John," said Sherlock, ignoring his exasperated sibling. "Let's find some dry clothes; I'm sure there's plenty of my old things upstairs. Mummy never wants to toss anything."
"We're out of sugar," said the resident genius, suddenly recalling the experiment, which he’d started that morning. Then he added, "You should have stopped for sugar on the way home from the dentist."
The detective frowned momentarily, but decided overlook John’s possibly unintentional rudeness to discover more about this interesting dream. After all, the dream was about Sherlock.
"It's infected! It huwts. Ah hab a feber! And…and…Oh, God! Ah’m gonna be sick."
Impossible. How could it be 03:12...now 03:13. Sherlock Holmes did not drift off to sleep for nearly four hours when he had slept for nearly six hours the night before.
"Never mind, John," said Sherlock, nobly sacrificing his music to prevent the waterworks. "I shall forgo the violin for the rest of the night."
"She'wock? What the hell? Ah thought you were a wampire!" exclaimed John.
Meanwhile, the two brothers now glared suspiciously at one another. Mycroft spoke first. "Sherlock, can you see that he's glowing?" queried the older sibling.
"I wanted you to bite me," whispered John, who was clearly turned on by the idea.
"John," sighed the detective, enfolding his leprechaun in his arms again. This time, John leaned into Sherlock; this time John brought his arms around his lover's waist. John was John again, pliant and affectionate…
Sherlock frowned; the flu was a very disgusting illness, what with all the coughing and excessive mucous production. At least during the flu, John had retreated to his old third floor bedroom, because he didn't want Sherlock to catch the virus too, which was quite thoughtful of John. Pity John was less thoughtful tonight...
"AND, this Finn wants to have his way with you!" shouted Sherlock.
John was frankly astonished when Mister I'm-Married-To-My-Work, began to ravage his mouth. It was hard to think while his mouth was under such an amazing, glorious assault, but John still wondered why he had labored under the misapprehension that Sherlock might be a bit shy when it came to sexuality.
"Operation: John-Comes-To-His-Senses?" asked John with asperity.
"Oh for God's sake. She broke it when she lobbed it at me," said John, smiling as the familiar flow of deductions began.
“Fantastic."
"Because Sherlock doesn't care who sees the semen drying in his hair," said the practical bureaucrat.
Somehow John's face fell even further. He now had more wrinkles than a Shar-pei.
"...and Ah just saw the dentist. I'm on a auntibiotic now," said John.
"John!"
"No, but there are werewolves," said John. "I crossed paths with several in London. In fact, there's at least two working at the Met."
And she had looked so smug about the incident too, 'As if to say, 'Look how badly Sherlock treats you, my dear, stupid, trusting John.' John had been most displeased.
The blonds paused expectantly.
He returned to John's laptop. He preferred to use John's laptop even though his own was far superior. There was a very small probability that sentiment was involved with this preference. For some time, colorful photos of tooth disease distracted the Sherlock’s inquiring mind. The pictures of actual abscesses were rather pedestrian, but the pictures of root canal procedures were gruesome and quite fascinating. He particularly enjoyed the videos.
"Wrong!" protested John sharply. "I am not a sodding blue-blooded fairy; I am a leprechaun."
"What is he going on about?" Mycroft asked.
"Well maybe you should expect my help," whispered Sherlock sharply. "Maybe it's about time that you realized that I would do literally anything for you."
On top of everything else, Sherlock felt a tiny stab of guilt since he was actively avoiding his partner over a tiny blob of endodontic pustulence, which his partner couldn't have prevented. Or could John have prevented the infection? Sherlock was unsure.
He could faintly hear John bravely reassuring his daughter, even though the doctor was undoubtedly terrified by the kidnappers. The sounds of his dear doctor emanated from the nefarious device, which sat on the nightstand. He bent to examine it. There was no note. The radio was blue and white. It had a rabbit decal on it. It was a baby monitor.
Looking in from the outside, his life was a shambles, a debacle, a catastrophe...
“Besides, John, you don’t do anything that I have to ‘put up with’. You don't have any…"
'Changing the subject. Classic John Watson deflecting maneuver.'
"What! What the hell!" said John, stumbling out of their bedroom with his gun drawn, no less. At least John was still of a mind to provide protection. That was reassuring.
"And yet I'm sure she'd disapprove of New Jersey or Cleveland," said Sherlock. "Which brings us back to the question, why?'
"Voice? That sounded like a dog howling," said Sherlock.
When he heard the shower finally come on, Mycroft laughed out loud for the first time since he could remember, because Operation: Sherlock's Goldfish was an unqualified success.
John felt like an idiot.
Sherlock sneered back, unimpressed with the man's ludicrous melodramatics and no longer envious of the cape.
