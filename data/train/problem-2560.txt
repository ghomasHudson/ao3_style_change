The heart monitor showed rising heartbeats. John took Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it gently, assuring him to calm down.
Sherlock looked at Willoughby’s neck and stilled. He narrowed his eyes, and shifted his head slightly as if to look at John, but made up his mind and stared at it. “A…stethoscope?”
And then, he remembered. His eyes widened as the nightmare and all its details flooded John’s memory with distorted scenes and paralyzing pain. He gasped and hurried out the room, already shouting as loud as he could.
“Ready?” the nurse asked gently.
“I won’t ever leave you, John. Not like that again,” Sherlock said, as if he had heard John’s inner thoughts.
He was wearing the purple shirt—the one John was always so mesmerized by. It was blood stained now—spoiled, useless. The suit jacket lay heavily from being dampened by the continuing rainfall. Shivering for the first time, John kneeled by his lover and gently laid his hand over the man’s still shoulder. His eyes remained dry; a sob threatened to erupt in his chest but he refused to let it.
Sherlock turned around abruptly and stared at him. “He chose me,” Sherlock said, and then clenched his mouth closed, his face flickering with sudden uncertainty.
There was a knock on the door, and then John’s voice greeting the visitor. The tap of the umbrella provoked a groan from Sherlock’s throat, and he didn’t bother turning his head to greet his brother.
“You’re home, now. You’re here,” Sherlock whispered, as if even he couldn’t believe it.
John shot upwards as he screamed. He was back in their bedroom, and Sherlock was by his side, tense and at the ready to comfort John. John’s eyes flickered across the room and over Sherlock’s body, forcing himself to point out the evidence that Sherlock was alive, and focused on it. He noticed a washcloth by Sherlock’s hand, and then he faintly heard noises from down the hall.
“That’s it—oh!” Sherlock gasped as John found the pleasurable bundle of nerves deep within him.
Sherlock turned around and glared at him. “And you are?”
Dmitri helped Sherlock sit up against the pillow that was resting on the armrest, and then gathered his things. He quickly left, and then started talking to John. Sherlock overheard various exercises and poses, and then a shuffle of papers clearly diagrams of such things. John’s voice rose slightly, sending an odd shiver down Sherlock’s spine.
John squirmed weakly against the cot. “Hmm…doctor…
“I promise.” Sherlock assured her and then hung up. Mycroft eyed his brother suspiciously. In his whole life growing up with his younger brother, he had never heard him promise something so…unselfishly.
John slumped against the wall, fighting off a whimper. He couldn’t take it any longer and allowed the tears to fall down his cheeks. He stayed slumped against the wall for a while, while a man in a trench coat watched him from across the street.
Victor reached to the wall and pressed the call button. “I need help in here!”
He only waited for thirty minutes, before numbers on the monitor began flashing red.
“Just a cold, brother mine,” Mycroft replied.
“John?” Sherlock paused in his pacing and stepped toward his blogger.
“You know what’s real. Just look, you’ll see.” Another voice answered but it sounded millenniums away.
A sudden cough started John, and he craned his neck to the right. Sherlock squeezed himself through the dented crack in the side of the boat and crawled to John, breathing hard and with blood trickling down his temple.
“No, Sherlock, wait!”
The ambulance shook on the way to the hospital; the sirens were loud in John’s ears, and lights kept flickering from red to yellow to white. He was in and out of consciousness, one minute looking at Sherlock, who was sitting beside him in the truck, and the next, in the Afghan sun, desert sand surrounding him.
Sherlock to leave.
Jack shrugged. “He never said, though I suspect it’s for the boss he keeps mentioning.”
“Take it off,” he ordered lightly. Sherlock paused for a moment and then crawled backwards until he was on the floor kneeling in front of John. John sat up with his legs over the edge of the bed. Sherlock quickly found the button on the ankle and pressed it. The prosthetic slid off, and all remained were the socks and liner with the pin. John looked at Sherlock and nodded, allowing him to go on. Sherlock slowly continued, first by pulling the two pairs of socks off, and then the liner. John’s residual limb was a little red and cool at the touch. Sherlock leaned forward and pressed his lips to John’s knee. John reached forward and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. He pulled him closer and met him halfway, before pressing his lips softly against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock straightened up and looked at John. He pressed his hand against the top, and closed his eyes for a brief moment. As satisfied as he could get, he turned back to Lestrade and walked towards him.
Sherlock walked passed John and headed up the stairs to the other room.
“Sherlock—God, are you ok?” John demanded roughly.
“Oh John must you need an explanation for everything? A children’s dictionary?”
“Do you love me John?” Sherlock asked bluntly.
John shifted his hands until they were around Sherlock’s back, and held onto him. “Stay with me. Just stay.”
John breathed a sigh of relief, but much to his annoyance, couldn’t help but feel even lonelier than ever in the remaining silence.
John slowly nodded. “I didn’t answer before, but…I would take what I have at the moment, and hold onto it for dear life.” John’s voice hitched, and he inhaled slowly, attempting to calm himself down.
But by the evening, John was caught off guard by stomach cramps and a rising fever. He was lying in his bed, curling in on himself, unaware of people talking around him, trying to move him.
John gasped and continued to squirm upwards. He shifted his left arm to push Sherlock away, but grimaced in pain and cried out. Sherlock stilled and looked at John’s arm. The bandage over his wound had come apart, and the wound was slightly bleeding.
John sniffled and climbed back into bed. He lied against the pillow and clenched his eyes shut. He inhaled deeply, but then fell into a coughing fit.
“If it doesn’t go well, worst case scenario he dies.”
“Um, sure.” Lucy looked at her mother, who was looking around the room. Satisfied she wasn’t going anywhere, she followed John into the kitchen; John kept the sliding doors open, just in case.
“Grimms Kartell, in German.”
“It’d be nice if this was more decorated for Christmas…I don’t know if it’s allowed but I’ve always loved Christmas decorations…”
“John?”
“John?”
“What is it?” he slurred.
It seemed trivial; of course his leg wouldn’t grow back and he would have to adapt and change his lifestyle. John
“You’re not going alone—.”
Later that night, seated in their armchairs with the fireplace glowing beside them, John thought they should get on with it.
The man holding John proceeded to lead him outside. John twisted out of his grasp and climbed into the car, feeling everything was out of his control now.
Sherlock continued to sob, but they were muffled as he hand covered his mouth. Fresh tears leaked their way down and fell into his lap. He didn’t respond, just kept crying.
John reached under the sink and pulled out a first aid kit. He silently wrapped Sherlock’s wrist with elastic bandages.
Sleepless - Kate Havnevik
“We’re at a small, private hospital, in Sussex.”
Sherlock shifted slightly so he could lower his head and look down to met John’s eye. “Nothing in particular. I find myself…” he paused, which suggested he was about to get emotional, which John knew was rare in moments yet he relished in the sparse times Sherlock chose to confide with him.
John faltered. “Am I not allowed to leave?”
“What?”
John grinned weakly and nodded.
Sherlock straightened up, his back tensing. “I’ve been tired before—.”
Sherlock breathed deeply and tightened the embrace even further. “I’ve missed you too John.” His baritone voice rumbled against John’s ear, who smiled. He had missed that voice.
“It makes you queasy,” Sherlock said gently.
John’s stomach dropped with guilt as he realized Sherlock was silently crying, wiping his eyes and muttering to himself.
Sherlock bolted upright and hurried to John. He hesitated in touching him, but knelt down on his knees and cautiously inched forward. John was crying now, almost wailing in pain.
“Oh, John—oh!”
Sherlock looked at him for a brief moment. “We—you passed out. You were pinned, John—I had to, I—.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Or a few years,” John added. He inhaled deeply and pinched his nose.
“You shouldn’t,” Sherlock snapped.
They made it to New Scotland Yard, and headed to a conference room where Lestrade was there with the daughter of the victim and her mother. Lestrade and the daughter—Lucy—were talking while her mother was looking between the two with a slight quizzical look.
He heard Sherlock sigh—he sounded disappointed.
“Sherlock—wait, just wait—,” John took a step back and held up a hand, holding Sherlock back. Sherlock’s eyes flickered with worry, but then he relaxed his face and looked at John.
“I’ll be fine without you for a couple of hours or however long this takes. Don’t worry, go and identity him and I’ll meet you back the flat.”
The doctor removed his hands from Sherlock’s back and began unbuttoning his own cardigan. Pushing it aside, he began with his shirt. Once the buttons were taken care of, he pushed the sides away, baring as much torso as possible for Sherlock to caress. The detective wrapped his arms around John’s waist, caressing the bare skin beneath his fingers as his lips trailed the other side of the blogger’s neck.
“We’ll see what they scans show, but I don’t think you fractured them. Just be careful next time, all right? And—.”
“Apologies,” he said lightly.
“Just an idiot,” Sherlock finally spoke aloud. “Seems we’ve gotten used to the criminal mastermind class.” Sherlock’s eyes glistened with a hint of nostalgia, causing John to flinch with a pang of worry. Meeting John’s gaze and reading his expression in an instant, Sherlock softened his expression.
“That’s fine, it could help though. It’s just—a personal matter.”
“Sherlock!”
“Do you bathe me, John?”
John clenched his fists and opened his eyes, glaring at the newspaper that blocked Sherlock’s face. He reached for the cup, tried peeling the lid off, but it wouldn’t budge. He set it down, and reached for the plate. It was a cheese sandwich. Beside it, there was a juice carton and crackers. John reached for the carton and tried to pull it open, but he couldn’t hold it steady enough. John became more frustrated, and slammed the carton the table out of anger. He reached for the crackers and managed to pull the wrapper open with his teeth. However, the crackers crumbled in his tight grasp, sending crumbs everywhere.
Sherlock smiled and looked back up. “It can worn for dancing,” Sherlock explained softly. John swallowed tightly.
“How has she been, since the drugs left her system?” John asked.
Why had John kept this a secret? It wasn’t as if they were divorced. They were still married, according to Mary’s ring,
words. He became frustrated quickly, in which John took his hand until he relaxed, and then he’d fall back sleep soon after.
Ever since they arrived at the safe house, John was acting strange. For one thing, he was on a continuous cycle of having Sherlock be active, and it was obviously getting to him. Sherlock knew he wasn’t sleeping enough, and most likely was having trouble to do so in the first place. But Sherlock couldn’t bring it up, and hoped John would deal with it on his own. He usually did, didn’t he?
“The doctor is running some tests, and is keeping an eye on it. Do you need anything?”
Sherlock looked up to find John staring at him, a very faint grin forming around the tube.
He wished he hadn’t.
“Was Stan rescued as well?” Sherlock asked.
John chuckled, though the laugh didn’t reach his eyes. “Not quite. She was in her robe and he was in the shower. He came out just after we finalized everything, including emotions and whatnot.
By evening, Sherlock had racked the entire flat looking for his secret stash of cigarettes, but John must have discarded them, for they weren’t in any of his hiding spots, not even under the skull.
Sherlock met his gaze. “What about him?”
“I don’t doubt it.”
John shot his head up, bewildered. ‘I’m fine. I wasn’t the one who got shot—.”
“Don’t be so childish Sherlock—.”
“Can I have Lucy’s number? I have a question for her. It’s probably nothing but I just thought to ask.”
“The whole compartment is the bomb,” he declared. He stood up and took a step forward, only to have his attention brought to the ground. He knelt down and lifted the center tile open.
"Why would he do that? Isn't it simple brain surgery, surely his chances aren’t considered to be low enough to convince him to sign
“I thought this tumor was going to drown me again, and succeed. But you came back and…it was like coming up for fresh air. You saved me.” John said as he stared into Sherlock’s deep eyes.
“I want to.”
Another trembling voice whispered in the distance.
“Are-Are you sure? Why now?” John asked, keeping his rising desire grounded as much as possible.
Mandy’s face faltered. “It’s best if you’ve had something to eat. We don’t want you fainting now, do we?” She smiled sincerely, and squeezed John’s shoulder. “I’ll come by later.”
“John, get up with me and then run! Do not look back!”
“Do you know what the drug was for?”
“Really? So once I get to know you, you won’t be boring like everyone else?” Sherlock challenged.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, suddenly frustrated at his uselessness, and then stretched his legs outward with his hands. He applied the brakes of the chair to keep it from moving, and then scooted to the edge of the seat. He lowered himself to the floor, and using his hands, dragged himself to John’s side to gently shake John’s back.
Sherlock huffed with annoyance but nodded reluctantly. “Why on earth are you carrying a suture kit around?”
“Choo choo.”
“No, no I’m fine. Could you make me some tea?”
Through the window, John was lying still on the bed, alone. Sherlock slowly entered the room and went up to his bedside.
The hallucination sighed. “
But John always kept his emotions stable, and to himself. When he was mad, he’d express it in a controlled way, but when he was upset, he’d keep it to himself until he repressed enough to go on with the day. Breaking down in a hospital wasn’t unheard of, but to have it happen to John was unsettling. No—it was worse. It was unacceptable. No one should upset John this much to have him cry in the washroom, trying so hard to muffle it, which meant it was most likely to hide it from someone in the room. The only person capable of doing such a thing was Sherlock.
“No,” Sherlock said with defeat. “As you know today’s been on my mind.”
“Yeah, go ahead. And this case, it could wait. Just make sure he’s all right.”
John nodded, and then slid off. He felt the floor against his feet, and leaned against Sherlock. Sherlock held onto the belt around John’s waist, and slowly led him to take a step. John fidgeted with the elbow crutches, finding them awkward. But if he wanted to walk around his room, he would have to wear them.
“It’s Christmas Eve tomorrow…” John remarked. “Any news from Mycroft?”
*            *            *
He gently untwined himself from John’s embrace and drew his dressing gown over his nude body before heading out to the sitting room. He didn’t care if he was stark naked under the blue silk; people were in his flat, without his permission, so he’d dress as he damn well pleased.
“Sometimes, I hate it when you’re right.”
“Yes, you do.” John’s tone wasn’t of impatience, but blunt yet still trying to be comforting. He lifted Sherlock onto the shower chair, and then brought the wheelchair closer. He helped him in and then wheeled him back into the room.
“Yeah. Go ahead.”
“How, er, how long?” Sherlock whispered.
“The game is on!” he exclaimed with excitement. John laughed and composed himself, and then stood up and followed after him.
A sensation tingled below Sherlock’s waist, startling him. He sat still and focused on the feeling. It was still there, and he started to feel the warm mist from the shower spray onto his legs.
A loud clatter snapped Sherlock awake; his eyes squinted against the morning sun streaming onto his face. A mutter of cursing followed the crash. Sherlock glanced at the empty spot next to him and instantly knew it was John making the commotion.
Mycroft sighed. “I’ve always said not to get involved.”
“He had a seizure…” Sherlock quietly said as the shock started to take effect.
Here's a short chapter : )
Alone, John placed his hands on the edges of the sink and breathed deeply, slowly through the nose and then out the mouth. He wanted to get out of this place badly, but couldn’t do it by himself. He wondered if Mycroft would do something, but he hadn’t heard of him since he was first committed. The days were blending in and whatever anger management medication they were giving him was not helping. He was sleep deprived, yet didn’t even have hallucinations or nightmares when he did sleep. He only heard Sherlock right after his therapy session, or in the morning the next day.
Sherlock’s lips twitched a promising grin, and leaned into his chair with a sigh.
“Damn. Charge the paddles!”
He took a breath and lowered his head into the water just as it rose completely over his face. He held his breath as he tried to free his stump. He scooted closer and pressed his left foot against the debris, and then pushed hard. Some of the debris shifted, and then his stump was released.
“You think you’re going to die?” Sherlock pointed out.
John focused on his strained breathing and ignored him.
They slowly walked down the hall and then paused. Sherlock peeked around the corner and found it empty also. He and John made their way down, their senses on alert for any sudden noise.
The detective rolled his eyes. “I’m not tired John. Don’t worry I’ll be fine.”
John stared at his right leg—or what was left of it—for several seconds before lying back down against the pillow. Sherlock hastily pulled the blanket back in the place and then sat in his chair, avoiding John’s tired stare.
Sherlock’s heart sped up, and a sudden swell of emotion fell over him.
“Charlie Pinkman.”
John thought.
Besides the scar on his left shoulder, there was a surgical one near the center of his abdomen below his left pectoral and it trailed down just before his naval. There were smaller scars, likely from the glass, which scattered across his chest. Most were pink and fairly healed, others slightly darker. John trailed his fingers across one that traveled from below his right pectoral to the middle of his abdomen. It was the longest one, and the thinnest. Others were short yet thicker, and most were clearly thick enough for stitches.
John froze and gaped at the detective. After a moment of silence, he laughed.
John shook his head abruptly and inhaled deeply. Sherlock fell silent for a moment.
“Hold still,” Sherlock told John gently. “I need to—,”
Mycroft stepped into the living room, and it took him longer than usual to meet his brother’s eye—just a second of hesitation. Something was wrong.
“Do you need any help, John?”
) in order.
Sherlock paused for a split second. “I’m not sure. Whatever he was drugging Ellis with wasn’t in her medication or food. Besides, George would have had symptoms too, if they were eating the same things.”
“Of course I am. Why do you ask?”
Sherlock observed the area. The air smelled musky, no doubt from the various businessmen and pollution but another scent was fresher. There was a mix with something familiar…
Sherlock peered up with an innocent look in his eyes. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He said with a straight tone, yet his lips twitched with a promising grin.
Sherlock looked at the woman, instantly seeing the resemblance. She was short, just at five feet, with blonde hair—
Sherlock stared at him; John was still at first, then an affectionate smile crossed his face.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and John held onto him around his neck, holding his leg up slightly as he hobbled by his side. Sherlock cautiously looked out the door, and seeing the hallway was empty, he and John slowly walked out of the room, heading towards where Jack had left.
John did his morning routine alone, with Sherlock nowhere in sight. He wasn’t surprised; Sherlock hadn’t slept in their bed all week, and he was gone from the flat most of the time. After he was done, John went into the kitchen for tea. His prosthetic leg was ready today, so he was going to the hospital after he ate, but he hoped he’d see Sherlock before he left. He hadn’t told him yet, and John wanted Sherlock to go with him.
“John?”
John furrowed his brows in pure confusion but simply hummed for Sherlock to continue at his own pace.
As the women left, Sherlock stepped to the bed and placed a bag on the table. John could hear him taking something out, and then he felt something soft being placed over his body and by his arms. He looked up and saw Sherlock grinning softly as he arranged the blanket and the union jack pillow. John recognized the blanket; it was his from the flat, a pine-coloredknitted blanket his grandmother had made years ago. He gave Sherlock a strained but genuine smile, and nodded his thanks. Sherlock nodded, and then tilted his head towards the bag.
“Sher—.”
“Tea, John. I need tea.” Sherlock mumbled.
John kissed him again, and pulled back before Sherlock could part his lips. “I know you wouldn’t. I trust you with my life, Sherlock. Which is why I plan to spend the rest of it with you. All of it.”
With everything close by, John walked into the sitting room to find Sherlock asleep, curled into a ball, on the sofa, twitching and moaning softly. John walked closer and knelt down; it seemed like Sherlock was having a nightmare.
A sound echoed from behind the detective; Sherlock scurried away and knelt behind a discarded hospital bed. The footsteps drew closer, the person’s pace going at a steady speed. Sherlock remained kneeling in his hiding spot, and peeked closely at the metal part of a wheelchair in front of him. The person’s figure, no matter how distorted, was recognizable.
The heart monitor beeped a steady rhythm, echoing against the off-white walls. That was the first sound to enter John’s mind, slowly bringing him back to the conscious world. He felt heavy and tired—too tired to open his eyes right away—but he wanted to stay awake for a little while. His head and chest ached, and his side. He could smell the antiseptic, and could feel the bandage around his head. He secretly hoped they didn’t shave off all of his hair.
“You’re joking. Are—are you still mad at me?”
Sherlock stood up with him. “Leaving already? You barely touched your tea.”
“You didn’t need to!”
“John.”
There were only ten steps, and Sherlock’s bedroom was the room closest to the stairs, the door already opened. John walked in and gently placed him down until he was sitting on the bed. He went back to retrieve the second chair, which was the same type as the one downstairs, with handles for pushing and large wheels. The two they had weren’t ideal for Sherlock in his state, but they hadn’t been able to purchase a specific one just yet, so they used the ones from the hospital. He placed the chair in close reach from Sherlock’s bed, and then stepped back.
Sherlock pressed his hands against the plastic, hating it with all his might. He tapped his fingers gently against it, thinking, when John went rigid.
John shook his head again and squeezed his eyes shut, but Sherlock already saw some tears leaking out of the corners and running down his cheeks.
“Have you contacted John?” Mycroft asked in a concerned whisper.
doing?” Mycroft cut him off. “Whatever confirmation you have for drug torture has been falsified.”
“Positive this time. He’s going to Sumatra Road.”
of plan.”
Sherlock grabbed John by the shoulders and pushed him towards the bathroom. John gasped and tried to squirm, but Sherlock was nearly dragging him, and John’s foot barely grazed the ground while his crutches fell to the floor. He couldn’t run off now.
didn’t I say it? Why didn’t I—?”
Four hours later, they had not yet had an update. This could be either good or bad the detective thought. It would be good if the surgeons were focused and too busy to send someone with news. But if it were a bad sign, then perhaps the surgeons were hurriedly trying to control the problem, again too busy to notify him. Nevertheless, Sherlock was starting to fidget. He had the sudden urge to vomit and was sweating profusely underneath his heavy trench coat, despite being quite cool in the hospital. Suddenly, a wave of emotion washed over him; anxiety, worry, dread, excitement, and longing washed over him and it became overwhelming in a panic. He needed to get out. He needed a stimulant. Sherlock ran his hand into his pockets and only felt one last syringe—no cigarettes or patches—just that one vice of his resting against his fingertips. He was going into withdrawal; he knew it would happen sooner or later. The symptoms would only continue and he was in a hospital for God’s sake. Someone with a decent medical knowledge would notice once they got an accurate glimpse of him. He needed it. He needed it now! John still had four hours to go, if not more. He had time. Without a look at Harry, Sherlock sprang out of his seat and nearly galloped out through the hospital doors and out of sight. He barely caught a glimpse of Harry’s reaction, but recognized her expression instantly as disappointment.
“I thought you said you had people keeping an eye on him.” Sherlock hissed to his brother as they hurriedly walked past emergency vehicles a couple of streets away from Doctor Shepherd’s office.
John gave him a lightly stern look, but he didn’t stop grinning.
John weakly lifted himself back onto his knees so he could fully look at Sherlock. Sherlock was slouching forward, nearly curling in on himself, and breathing heavily.
Sherlock looked back up and nodded once. The paramedics surrounded them and placed John into the ambulance. Sherlock followed them in, and together they headed to the hospital.
; he assured himself,
The man thrusted his hips, and as he picked up his pace, his name was appearing on Sherlock’s lips before the detective could stop himself. He couldn’t recall when they had introduced themselves, but couldn’t care less now. He lost control of his moans and was actually starting to enjoy this release. The man’s hold on Sherlock’s hips tightened and with his other one reached down between Sherlock’s body and couch to reach Sherlock’s cock. He stroked it in sync with his thrusts. Pretty soon, the man was coming, Sherlock close behind.
“I wasn’t, I was just…waiting until you got up. Breakfast?”
John gapped at him. “You don’t have to order it! I’ve scheduled it for next week—.”
“No!” John snapped. He flinched and clutched at his bandaged shoulder again, and let out a whimper. “No…” he muttered again. “I—I don’t want to—lose weeks again. Or months. I’ll be fine,” he insisted.
It only took forty minutes for John to be checked up on and cleared from any surgery, no doubt due to Mycroft’s aid. John shifted his legs over the side of the bed and reached for the crutches. He was going to have to take antibiotics for a few weeks, but the doctors were optimistic he hadn’t developed any infection. They had issued him an undershirt and fresh pajamas, and bandaged half his thigh. He hobbled towards Sherlock at the front desk, who turned to him and kissed him.
“No it’s not that, exactly. Just, let me get you’re shoes on. It’s quite a ways a way.”
After the beginning introductions, John was first to read his vow. He looked into Sherlock’s eyes, and took his hand.
“Alright, fine. C’mon.” He led the way back into the hospital, with Sherlock close behind him. He wasn’t sure exactly why Sherlock wanted him back inside so much, but he was feeling the exhausting starting to kick in, and he knew he would be less grouchy and moody if he went now.
“When this is over, I…I might not come back,” he whispered.
He didn’t return until three days later, alone. He entered Sherlock’s room and hovered around the bed, not looking at Sherlock, but highly aware of the hissing and beeping of the machines, the ventilator and heart monitor, and such. He clenched his fists, unsure what to say. The doctors had told him the diagnosis, but it didn’t feel real. How could Sherlock Holmes have fallen into a coma this fast, with no warning, no suspenseful event making it inevitable? He hadn’t fallen or hit his head, and yet here he was, silent, still…not
“In a moment, Sherlock.”
“No!” John stepped right up to Sherlock, in which his nose was just barely grazing Sherlock’s. “It’s not your fault,” he said sternly. “But you need to tell yourself that, not me. You want to kiss me, so kiss me. If I flinch, ignore it. You flinch too—we both do, and we need to ignore it. It doesn’t mean I don’t want this, Sherlock. I’m ready. I need you now, more than ever. I. Want. You.”
As he prepared the kettle again, Sherlock silently discarded his coat and jacket, and walked up behind John.
“I’m not contagious—,” John whispered.
“No!”
*            *            *
“Good,” he said softly. “That’s good.”
“Continuing compressions,” Victor said firmly, ignoring the doctor who had just walked in. Sherlock focused on John as Victor continued to beat his heart. He was trembling under his coat, and couldn’t find the strength to think or focus on anything else.
“I can wait until Alex is here,” Sherlock pointed out.
Sherlock froze and looked up at John, who was oblivious and looking at another packet of seeds. He shook himself out of surprise, and reminded himself the obvious.
“That’s fine, Mr. Holmes. What did you do last Christmas?”
“Well, well, well, we finally meet.” Moran had said.
“John,” Sherlock said sternly. “I don’t quite understand your involvement, but you are involved, so tell me!”
John tried to focus on the tea making, but the other two men’s voices became louder, and then stopped altogether. John turned around to see Sherlock and Lestrade standing in the entryway, between the kitchen and sitting room. Sherlock was looking at him closely, not even bothering in hiding his deducing stare. John squirmed and lowered his gaze.
“Stay awake! Keep your eyes open—Watson! —”
“Like you’re…keen…do you—do you want to wash me—.”
“Yes, I know, you love me.”
“He needed you months ago but you were dead!”
“What are my chances? Of living with it versus having surgery?”
Mary's character here is only to set her character for the second part. If you have concerns/questions, feel free to ask me.
“Are you ready to tell—.”
He grimaced and ran into the street just as a motorcyclist stopped in front him. He stopped in his tracks and held his hand out just as it stopped.
Sherlock walked around to his chair and sat down. “I can tell you later. You should rest.”
Sherlock looked at him and nodded. He leaned down and pressed their lips together briefly before leaning back and helping John stand up. He wrapped an arm around his waist and John wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock took hold of his hand there to keep him upright.
John looked at Sherlock and real grin tugged at his lips. “Neither actually. It is sad, divorce typically is. But I’m glad that it is over; no more having to wait around for it to be so.”
John inhaled sharply and clenched his eyes tight. He opened them, and blinked rapidly, and Sherlock realized with a pang in his chest that they were already glistening.
“Thank you,” he murmured. Sherlock nodded once, and then started to get into his chair. He showered first, and then let John quickly wash up, before going downstairs for lunch.
John shook his head, and then spoke. “No, I’m—I’m thirsty.”
. The day must be important enough—so easily to remember that it’s your password code.”
Nothing. But John could hear settle gasps and muttering, but it was too incoherent to analyze.
“John and I met up for a pint after they’re fight, before he collected an overnight back I presume. It wasn’t pretty.” Lestrade reported.
John flinched awake and immediately set his eyes on Sherlock’s sleeping form beside him. He scooted closer and rested against him, applying his cheek between Sherlock’s shoulder blades. Sherlock, still asleep, shifted around and pulled John closer. The pain in John’s leg was nearly gone now; it was only a faint sore than anything else.
Sherlock nodded anyway. He was pushed gently and then he felt an uncomfortably padded seat underneath him. The man walked away after squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock was alone, but then he finally noticed that his hands weren’t shaking at all. He was utterly still in the middle of chaos.
“What happened him?”
“You’re ignoring me. Quite rudely mind you. You weren’t this cold before.”
“Boring,” Sherlock said and flopped down on to the soft. He placed his arm over his eyes and sighed dramatically.
Lestrade furrowed his eyebrows. “Snow White…lives in the forest, meets seven dwarves, and is hiding from an evil queen…”
“It was an accident, John. It’s okay,” Sherlock said calmly, but slurred.
But then Sherlock cleared his throat, getting John’s attention.
John told himself.
John clenched his mouth shut; Sherlock stared at him, repeating what he had just said.
“Lee Van Der Ross.”
“Where’s your scarf?” John noticed.
Sherlock glanced at her, as did John. “Good. All right then.”
“Can I borrow your phone Mike?” Sherlock asked without taking his eyes off of the slide.
“Good. That’s good.” She turned to Sherlock. “I just came by to see how you two were. Oh, and I did the autopsies on the victims, and I think you should take a look, Sherlock.”
“It’s hard to say because of the drug. We’re only doing what we’re doing based off of protocol. Most of it are just precautions.”
Sherlock laughed lightly and fell silent.
Upon reaching the grass, he tumbled forward until he was well away from the burning house, and then fell onto his knees. He dragged Sherlock forward, and examined his head.
Sherlock turned to the side and pulled the shower curtain opened. He turned the shower on, and then adjusted the temperature. After a few moments, he held the curtain to the side, giving space for John to enter. John looked at him with a curious look, but stepped into the shower anyway. He held onto the plastic railing that was by his hip, and he stabilized his balance. He was facing the shower spray, where Sherlock stepped underneath as he followed John in.
Sherlock nodded, his curls bouncing up and down. John bit his lip and looked around.
Lestrade shuffled his feet but didn’t protest. He nodded his head to the evidence Sherlock had, and raised an eyebrow, but before he could speak, Sherlock cut him to it.
“I don’t believe him because it’s not true. I may not know his intentions but I
John took a step but stopped when a figure peered through the door. The man pushed it opened and walked in. John’s shoulders relaxed with defeat and huffed out in annoyance.
Sherlock took the cup, drank most of it, and then lied down fully onto the pillows.
“Ah, Mycroft, perfect timing.” Sherlock stood up and went up to his brother.
The woman tapped her foot impatiently, and looked towards the others. John glanced at Billy and saw him on the phone as another nurse came up to him. The larger nurse forced John’s neck back by placing his forearm against the upper part of his chest. John squirmed and cried out. The other patients ignored him.
“Shouldn’t we go in? If Mrs. Hudson comes up she might see us.”
“Ok. Good. Look at your hands.”
“Hold him still,” Moran demanded. He walked around and stood in front of the man. He pulled out a knife and swiftly plunged it through the man’s injured thigh. The man yelped and contorted his face in agonizing pain. Sherlock clenched his jaw and glared at Moran.
John nodded. Sherlock looked at his arm, which was covered in a sleeve, but John didn’t doubt he hadn’t seen the words that morning.
“Well Kingston had the evil queen’s name, so you’re not the antagonist of the story are you?”
John stared back at him, giving him a chance to explain.
John laughed in the back. “Seriously? This guy, a junkie?”
“I can help you,” Sherlock offered after a moment.
Another voice spoke in Sherlock’s head, challenging with himself.
“Sherlock, I know it hasn’t been long, but I wanted to tell you…”
Sherlock stared at him, and then it slowly dawned on him. He moved his hand higher until it rested just below John’s hip, and he slowly started to caress the area, moving a little closer to John’s groin. John started to feel a mix of arousal and panic, so he quickly leaned in and captured Sherlock’s lips in a desperate kiss. Sherlock kissed him back and started to slow the pace down as he lowered his hand over John’s hardening cock. He palmed the area and moved his hand; John’s eyes fluttered closed and he moaned against Sherlock’s lips.
“Do you still think this is Alzheimer’s, John?” John didn’t respond, and his eyes flickered, undoubtedly with confirmation.
“It won’t right away. But it’ll help; in some small way it will help. Besides,” John leaned back against the pillow, trailing his hand into Sherlock’s curls. “How can anyone resist my face, apart from my shaved head.” John said proudly, only finishing slightly ashamed for the latter.
The flat was empty. John’s breathing—the only sound—slowly started to quicken, and his chest was tightening. He turned the kettle on to make tea, forcing himself to fall into a familiar habit and to ignore the flashing images of the nightmare, but then the front door opened. Sherlock was talking aloud, and then John caught Lestrade’s voice. But, he couldn’t comprehend what the two were saying.
“Why did you do it?!”
“Molly, with the blood result.”
“Oh, well, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly. It’ll be nice.”
“Why? What for?”
“Looks like the poisonous apple…” John muttered to himself. Sherlock straightened up and looked at him, furrowing his brow. John looked at him, waiting for him to say something. He didn’t.
*            *            *
Sherlock started to slow down, but John didn’t want to just yet. He continued to deepen the kiss, and ran his hands down Sherlock’s back, trailing them down to his backside and holding him steadily against him. Sherlock laced his fingers with John’s and held one of his arms above John’s head, and then slid his other one in between their bodies, resting just over John’s belt buckle.
The next few days were excruciatingly awkward, at least in Sherlock’s mind. The idea that John might move out despite his pending divorce circled endlessly in his mind and Sherlock blamed it on his irrational fear of losing John.
“Look John, whatever it is let me help—.”
John shook his head. “We don’t have to—.”
“Fine. I’ll have some necessities arranged. I’ll be in touch in a few days.”
John held his head as still as possible as Sherlock applied the cream. His touch was gentle, and as he started using the razor, his eyes were focused and he was careful. For a moment he wondered, why this was Sherlock’s first time, and since it seemed like it was, who had shaved him before?
Sherlock met his gaze, and nodded slightly, allowing him to continue.
John nodded. “Lestrade will get back to us about Ellis’ coworkers. For now, we have these. Back to the flat?”
“Oh, Sherlock,” John sighed sadly. “I’m fine—I—,” he stuttered.
“Actually, let him watch.” He said, his eyes burning with a murderous glare.
“Have someone…with me…at all times,” John filled in for her with a tired sigh.
“For me,” Sherlock said. “Please—,”
“I’ll be fine!”
John narrowed his eyes at him. “Well, can I help—,”
John grinned reassuring. “No you don’t have to. Go and bother Greg for a case, I’m sure he would love you’re help now that you’re back.”
“I need to…” he whispered. “Go. Home.”
“You have to come with me, darling, only for a second. I don’t want you to fall. And no, Sherlock can’t watch you, as badly he may want to, ha—” John almost laughed, but no comeback from Sherlock deteriorated his attempt at a joke.
The hallucination eyed him for a moment in silence before responding. “You still don’t get it, do you?” John’s eyebrows rose slightly, expecting a further response. The delusion obliged.
~~~~~~~~~~~
John inhaled deeply. “All right, we’ll take the case. Text the address, I think Sherlock would want to look at the crime scene.”
John flinched. His eyes started to sting and his throat tightened with emotion. He bowed his head further, attempting to hide his glistening eyes and quivering lip.
John breathed deeply as his orgasm subsided, and Sherlock’s hold around him slackened enough for him to place his feet firmly back onto the floor.
“Mhm, yes?” John encouraged gently, though his brows began to crease with concern.
“I’m—I’m dying aren’t I?” He didn’t expect an answer. “I’m dying and all he could do—all you could do, was deny it all…deny us. Why?” His voice broke, tears leaking out the corners of his eyes. John tried to sit up, but winced from the pain and a whimper escaped his lips. He slouched further against the wall, head lolling to the side. He tried fighting the black wave of unconsciousness, but he was in too much pain; the darkness seemed so welcoming.
“No, no I’m not doing this with you. You’ll just confuse me—manipulate me. It was just my imagination; I’ve kissed people before. I can kiss you now and it feels just like it does, warm and genuine, like it is with him. Before it was just cold and longing. Christ…” John inhaled sharply. “That’s all this is, just the tumor, bargaining with my sanity. So why don’t you just leave? I’m done with all of this, I am
Sherlock shrugged. “Why were you making an omelet?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock kept his face stern, but slowly relaxed his gaze, and nodded for John to continue.
“No, I mean it. Moran wouldn’t let you in to question Stan, so you’d have to do it while he’s away.”
“Like you pity me and I’m doomed. I’m going to survive, Sherlock.” John said defiantly.
Lestrade shrugged. “I trust you.”
John shook his head, but kept his aim steady at Moran. “No. You may have lied about many other things but you don’t lie about how you feel Sherlock. You never have. You always have to say how you feel so why are you taking it all back now?” John paused. “You don’t get to leave me, Sherlock, not again. I swear I’ll shoot Moran right now and it’ll all be over.”
He walked into the kitchen and found it empty. He could hear John just starting to come down the stairs, so he turned the kettle on and began rummaging through the morning post Mrs. Hudson had kindly dropped off.
John looked up and locked his gaze with the other man. He looked worried, but his eyes were dry, so he hadn’t been crying—he hadn’t been crying at all.
*            *            *
One week later, John sat on the edge of the bed, dressed in his oatmeal jumper and jeans, but in desperate need of a proper shower. He had called Harry and reassured her there was no need for her help but he appreciated it greatly and would be keeping in touch with her. Sherlock had stopped at Baker Street and retrieved clean clothes for him after almost giving Mrs. Hudson a heart attack. After a sobbing reunion, he fetched the clothes and made it back to the hospital. John was utterly surprised of how caring Sherlock was. It made him wonder, but thought best to breech the subject later.
“We’re, uh, getting a divorce. She only came here to confront me, after all this time. She had found my blog, which has our address. But anyway, we both agreed that it’s best to just finalize everything; she suggested a second chance but…” John shrugged. “It just seems like a lost cause anyway,” he stated, looking down.
“If this means I can dance with for the rest of my life, I will,” John said.
John paused as another tear escaped his eyes without warning and slid down his cheek then falling lonely to the cold ground.
John swirled his tongue against Sherlock’s, both of them moaning and fully awake. John reached for the hem of Sherlock’s nightshirt and pulled it over his head. Sherlock did the same to John, and then laid against him, their bare chests pressed against each other. Sherlock rested one of his hands over John’s hip, and John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled one of his legs over Sherlock’s, tangling themselves up in warmth.
“I just did.”
John sighed with annoyance, and then fell asleep, feeling the slight presence of a hand lying beside his, lacking contact.
John glanced out the window, and noticed the sun was just starting to set.
Sherlock listened carefully, and heard the faucet turn on. The person was washing their face, and then they entered the room, their steps stiff. They exhaled heavily and sat down in John’s chair—
THANK YOU to everyone who has left comments! They mean the world to me, and made this fic so much fun to publish! I hope you had a great time reading this! I can't believe I started this back in April, and thought I had finished in just a few weeks, but then my sister and wonderful editor asked for more. So a big thanks to her, greenjello94 on ao3 - check out her fics!
John scoffed weakly and turned his head away. His body continued to tremble and his skin was itchy with sweat against the cheap, polyester sheets. He fell back asleep, grateful for the oblivion.
John inhaled sharply, realizing with disappointment that was the most he had said without stuttering.
“Hm?” John breathed out softly.
Sherlock moaned with pleasure and attempted to lift his hips to meet John’s hand. His hips only shifted slightly, but he didn’t let that stop him. He moaned John’s name, desperate to express just how felt he was making him feel.
The scream halted abruptly; John had awoken himself up. Sherlock thought it sounded like a name, but couldn’t be sure. He was sure that it was about the pool. Being strapped to a bomb would have affected anyone, but John had PTSD, and so he was much more vulnerable. Sherlock knew not to mention his occasional night terrors, but this one struck him oddly. He felt he should offer some kind of condolence, since he had been at the pool as well. Maybe the dream involved him.
“It’s here!”
“We need bomb disposal.” Mary stated.
Sherlock sniffled stiffly; John felt a stab of guilty and reached over. He grazed Sherlock’s shoulder, and was relieved he didn’t flinch.
“I have a warrant for your arrest by the U.S. Government—.”
“I’m afraid it’s not up for negotiation. I have to arrest Watson now, and interrogate him for a confession—.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and the outside noise began a mere murmur. He blocked the rest out and focused.
Relief flooded his mind, blurring his vision. He barely saw John move, but the next thing Sherlock processed were arms wrapping around his back and holding him tightly. Sherlock swayed and blinked rapidly, trying to clear his sight. He felt John’s breath against his neck, and inhaled deeply, breathing in his scent, the scent of home.
Sherlock bit his lip. “I can’t stay here John. But I—look at me John.” Sherlock insisted desperately. John looked up; he was utterly lost now. Tears were spilling out and falling down his face like rain—he didn’t even bother wiping them away.
“When it would have been too late?” Harry interrupted. John pursed his lips and clenched his fists. He let out a breath in an attempt to relax himself and then unraveled his fists.
Sherlock hummed beside him, waking up. “No for two more days,” he mumbled. John smiled softy.
It was just as quiet as ever. Slowly, he began a steady pace, keeping an ear out for any sound of another living being, particularly John—
Mike Stamford was really just a boring person to even lay eyes on, however he was a teacher with association to St. Bart’s, and had access to experimental subjects for his classes, which he often allowed Sherlock access to, as did Molly. It was therefore important to at least try to talk to Mike, tedious though it was.
“Does that help?”
John’s eyes widened. “You—how? When?”
“You did the surgery before for yourself, so you would have a chance of living and moving on from me. Now that I’m back, I need you to do this for me. I’m getting better now and I did that for you because I knew you’d be here for me so I can get through it and I did. So can you do this for me? Please…”
“Stop squirming and wash yourself.” Sherlock pushed him until he was sitting on the edge of the tub. Sherlock reached for the shower and turned it on; John took his chance.
“He did last night—. Wait, how did you know already? We haven’t seen you since before it was decided?”
“Of course there’s time. It’ll be faster if you do rather than ask me, I haven’t read them or seen the movies in a long time—.”
He entered the sitting room and came to a halt. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. His coat was missing from the coat hanger.
John leaned back slightly and waited patiently for Sherlock to find the words.
“You think this is easier for me? That it’s harder on you because you have to watch with no control over the situation? You pity me even though
“It’s you who will develop something if we were to continue this. You’re a normal person, a romantic so far from what I’ve seen. It’s not me I’m concerned about— it’s you. I’m a high functioning sociopath; a sentimental relationship just won’t work,” Sherlock stated, his voice impassive.
“I’ll take John home.” Sherlock swiftly stood up, and John followed out of the room. They nearly made it to the entrance, when Moran stepped in front of them.
Sherlock kissed him back, lifting his legs up and crossing them behind John’s hips. He held onto John tightly, one hand above John’s backside, bringing him as close as possible, rubbing their clothed erections against each other, and his other hand on the back of John’s neck, keeping him in place.
Two days later, and it seemed John was acting normal. He didn’t mention the kiss, however Sherlock couldn’t tell if that bothered him. It was just a kiss—nothing serious. John had been in a vulnerable and emotional state, and if the contact offered him comfort, than Sherlock was happy to give it to him.
“N-no—,” he replied.
“Have you moved in all your things?” Sherlock asked.
“I don’t know…if it’s really me, or just your tumor talking.”
His eyes remained closed, but he could tell Sven’s footsteps were shuffling away, heavy on the toes suggesting he was dragging John with him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“John.”
The second thing was that he was alone. Irrational fear ached in his chest as he stood up and looked around the room.
“Of course.” Willoughby handed him a card with a set of three numbers. “Any one of those should work. I’m available anytime.”
John wanted to move closer and doze against his lover, but his skin was starting to feel sticky against Sherlock and the sheet. He shifted slightly and leaned up onto his elbows. Sherlock shifted to the side and onto his back, directing his gaze to John’s eyes.
“Don’t move,” Sherlock snapped impassively, ignoring the emotional storm going on his head.
“No, no—you were…dead for…I don’t even know how long, I lost track because I was too busy breathing for you, pumping the blood in your veins to keep your heart from stopping, so you get back into the damn bed, Sherlock!”
In slow motion, Sherlock deduced her. Her stilettos harshly clicked on the floor; she was confident in them, had money from family. She hadn’t taken off her faux-fur coat, so she wasn’t planning on staying long. In fact, Sherlock couldn’t deduce why she was here in the first place, which irked him. A wedding ring glistened against the morning rays on her ring finger: married for three to five years, happily as it clearly has been cleaned on a regular bases so no (obvious) marriage problems. No money problems, no kids, a successful career as a nurse—no, doctor, in her residency at a close by hospital. Maybe John knows her.
“Say my name.”
In a dingy abandoned flat located on the outskirts of London, the consulting detective twitched on a worn out mattress, his eyes glazed over—distant—while his face peeked with such a sickly paleness, it would almost appear that he should be the one in the hospital. Sherlock tightened a tourniquet above his elbow and with only a second of hesitation, he placed the cool tip of the syringe on his skin and injected the cocaine into his craving veins.
Sherlock looked at him, realization dawning. “What are you implying?”
*            *            *
John shuddered and moaned, his orgasm shaking through his body as Sherlock stroked him through it. As the pleasure subsided, he slouched forward, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s temple.
John sat on the edge of the bed, sounding out words in his head before speaking as Sherlock placed the socks back on his feet.
John’s face immediately fell and looked at Mike, who just kept grinning, although he did start to look apologetic.
John nodded with thanks. “At least I’m not claustrophobic,” he said with a small laugh.
Before they could apprehend David, Sherlock pulled back his fist and slammed into David’s jaw. The man crawled away only to be pulled up roughly by Mycroft’s men. He glared at Sherlock, then at John murderously, bloody dripping down his from his nose. “I would have gotten away with it—.”
“The Christmas Star, or scientifically the
“I—I feel…” John was at a loss once he found his voice. “I don’t understand, is this just a dream?”
“You’re bleeding.” John stated dumbly.
Willoughby cleared his throat. “When is your anniversary?”
“You should sit down.”
Sherlock leaned forward and pressed his forehead against John’s hand. He sniffed again, but a few tears leaked out and trailed down his cheek, pooling onto the alabaster blanket. His shoulders shuddered and he let out a choked sob.
“I know. But it just seemed like he knew me, from a distance.”
“It’s just temporary. I’ll get Dr. Robbins here to explain.” She quickly left before John could say another word. His temper was rising, and the air seemed suddenly too thick to breathe.
“I led you there!” Sherlock snapped. “It was all on me—”
“Go ahead,” Lucy responded kindly.
“I’m not having surgery. For now at least. I want to wait and see if I can cope with the symptoms…who knows, maybe they’ll die down or not happen as much…but Sherlock, I need you.” He began slowly but blunt. “I know you have difficulty understanding whatever emotions that run at high speed in your head but…I need you to at least stay with me—” John’s voice trembled and he took a breath of pause.
2:00:00 AM
“Sherlock!”
“How often did you visit your friend’s grave?”
“Then what is it?”
“Yes, my love.”
They sat in silence for several minutes. Sherlock’s face became still, and John knew he was slowly going into his mind palace. He waited a few minutes, and once he was sure Sherlock was deep enough, he stiffly sat up and reached for his crutches. He placed them under his arm and then walked towards the bathroom.
“It’s DOCTOR Watson!” John bellowed. He turned on his feet, ignored the looks from other patients and staff, and reached the receptionist desk by the front. He stalked past her and tried to open the doors, but they wouldn’t budge. They had kept them locked ever since the rain incident.
John bit his lip to hid a smirk, but failing, as he handed Sherlock a pot and a packet of seeds.
“It’s not,” he said slowly. “I’d know if it were. Just…calm down, John.”
The Holmes brothers looked at each other as John fidgeted on his feet.
John closed his eyes for a moment and clenched his jaw. “I don’t need a reminder,” he said in a low, scratchy voice. He removed his hand from Sherlock and took the controller back. Sherlock didn’t protest. John looked up for a second, catching a glimpse of pity on Sherlock’s face. He quickly looked away, and then slowly began to relax as the morphine numbed the pain.
John’s eyes were closed as he lay lifelessly in Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock laid him gently down as he yelled for help.
Lestrade shook his head sadly. “She didn’t understand what was going on; she kept asking for him, but when her daughter tried explaining it, she just didn’t get it. She kept claiming he was probably busy at work.”
“You know Mary blames me.” John said, bringing Sherlock back to the present. “Says I’m a doctor, I should have seen the signs.”
John was unconscious. But his subconscious wasn’t. It was like he was stuck between living and drowning, visioning something like a dream. He couldn’t move or swim away; he was hovering in the middle of the “in between”: above him he could sense the surface, and below him was darkness. Dark blue and grey surrounded him, and that was it. Well, apart from the hallucination hovering in front of him.
John tensed and then brought his arm back around Sherlock’s front, and kept his other hand firmly over his waist.
“Happy birthday,” John said, his voice firm, until the last syllable threatened his composure. He scoffed again, and shook his head.
John stared at him. “Sherlock—.”
Not a big deal, having to put you in cold water, hoping your temperature goes down, and that you wouldn’t seize and die while I slept. But as you said. It’s just ‘all this’.”
John creased his eyebrows. “For what—?” He exhaled against Sherlock’s lips, but was interrupted by a click and then felt his wrist tightened to—.
John made a noise in the back of his throat, and opened his eyes briefly, before closing them again.
John furrowed his brows and breathed heavily, his chest pain increasing. “What are you saying?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I think I have an idea of who the rat is?”
“He’s really warm…” Sherlock pointed out.
After a few moments, the shuddering suppressed and John shifted his head away just enough so Sherlock could hear him.
The car sped off, leaving John on the ground, unmoving. Sherlock rushed forward, but the man—presumably Jack Bauer—reached him first. Moran and his men pushed past Sherlock and one of them held him back. The men were yelling, at each other, at Jack, at Sherlock, but to the detective everything was muffled, the car tires’ screeching echoing in his ears.
even doing here?” John asked. He looked at Mary again, and noticed she looked a bit sad, or bothered about something. She glanced at him, and didn’t look away.
John nodded.
“John—!”
“How can you be so sure?”
They walked in, and the lights automatically switched on. John pulled his gun out and kept it lowered but at the ready. He kept the door open and stepped in. Sherlock had wandered the furthest in, looking around the room in a flourish.
“Of course I noticed. Quite hard not too, as it wasn’t nearly as good as these.” Sherlock ripped open a package of a teabag and poured the all ready boiling water into his mug. He prepared his tea and then sauntered to his chair, sitting down, placing his tea by his arm, and placing his fingers under his chin.
“B-ye,” Sherlock sighed from behind them.
Sherlock called over his shoulder. “John knows!”
“No not yet! He’s been contacting someone in CTU, someone else must be involved.”
John met his eyes and licked his lips. Sherlock flinched inwardly at the mistake to lock eyes. This man was intriguing—ordinary yet something about him was just… Sherlock looked down and avoided the man’s eye.
“We’ll go to Baker Street. That way you can eat and then rest.”
“Six months at the least. The network appears to think you died from your fall, but they may try to locate John—.”
“Not hungry still?”
John stilled and then let out a genuine laugh. He met Sherlock’s gaze, and felt lighter at the sight of amusement on his lover’s face. He leaned forward and captured Sherlock’s lips smoothly with his, kissing him gently and chaste, and ignoring himself flinching. Sherlock picked up the pace, and then parted his mouth to let John’s tongue in as he hummed deeply in his throat and caressed John’s sides. John leaned forward until his chest was against Sherlock’s. He slowed down his lips, and kissed Sherlock with lingering kisses as he started to trail off his mouth and to his cheek. John grazed Sherlock’s skin with his lips before kissing the spot, and then moving on to the other side. Sherlock’s breathing hitched as John sucked at the corner of his lips for a moment, and their hot breaths mixed together as John moved along Sherlock’s face.
John reached for his jacket. “Where are we going?”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John watched him go, and didn’t call after him, or even follow him. He physically couldn’t, even if he wanted to, which he didn’t really. There wasn’t a point. He stiffly entered their bedroom and sat on the bed.
John looked into Sherlock’s eyes, begging for this to all be just a dream. He felt a loss of sensation in his ability to pull away and with one final weak tug John fell into Sherlock’s arms, pressing his lips unto Sherlock’s, gently at first then passionately.
Sherlock wheeled himself as fast as possible, and he ignored how the path was becoming uneven, the sudden tightness in his throat and the annoying stinging in his eyes. He heard John’s steps falter behind him, and as he risked a glance behind him, his view turned to its side.
But then his leg trembled severely and while leaning sideways to the right, his leg buckled and he slipped. As Sherlock tried to stop him from falling, John hit his head against the facet and blacked out before he could fully register Sherlock’s panicked cry.
“I thought…it was a dream.” John whispered so quietly, Sherlock barely caught any of the words.
“Pressure…” he muttered. He lifted a hand and indicated to the wound, hoping Sherlock would understand. Sherlock unwrapped his scarf with one hand and pressed it to the wound.
Warning: Graphic details are in this chapter and the next.
Sherlock tensed beside him and reached for his hand. John squeezed it and basked in the rare moment of intimacy they have had. It was comforting to hold his hand, and overwhelming enough that his eyes started to fill. John wiped his face like he was wiping away the sleep, and looked at Sherlock once his eyes were clear.
“You’re not leaving,” Sherlock said firmly. “It was an accident.”
“It wouldn’t have done anything. I tested it earlier, at the lab. You can only inject it or ingest it, maybe snort it, but breathing it in from a distance wouldn’t do any harm,” Sherlock said in a rapid whisper.
Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s for a moment, and then he leaned back. “I remember bits and pieces. Next thing I knew, I woke up on the sofa even though I knew I went to bed with you. I must have been drugged, but it’s nothing, alright?”
Sherlock nodded as he put his coat on.
was a first.
“What?” John stared at him. “It matters to me,” he mumbled.
John noticeable relaxed, and walked closer. He rubbed the back of his neck and glanced at the floor. “I’m fine—.”
“Let’s not get into a battle of deductions now, Sherlock. I’ll look into her past, and let you know if I get anything. Moran is about to question Anthea, so I need to watch that, make sure he plays fairly.”
“Do you want to sleep in here?” John asked. He was already in his pajamas and on his bed, reading.
Lestrade muttered thanks and hurried off. John remained standing, a grin forming on his face. Sherlock tied his scarf and peered at his lover. “Would you be coming with me? You should rest, but…” He asked, concern honestly in his voice.
Sherlock swallowed tightly. “What do you think of the decorations?” he asked softly.
John scrunched his face and looked away, his cheeks reddening. He started to tremble, and then Sherlock’s arms were around him and pulling him against his chest.
“We can put him in a smaller bubble, almost like a coffin. It’s like an adult incubator; it’ll have two holes for arms to go in so it’ll be easier to administer drugs to the IV tube in his hand, and to check his wound. The ventilator tubes can go through another hole, and that way, the seal won’t be such a hassle. It’ll be best if we put him to sleep—.”
“I’ll just check on the progress with the rest of the investigation. I’ll be back soon.”
“I have an idea…” John said. He removed his shirt and shoes and kneeled beside Sherlock. Sherlock eyed the scar on John’s shoulder. It was slightly raised skin, stretching outwards like a small flower over the span of his shoulder. It was pale but not sickly so, simply it was just a scar—a mark from the past.
Sherlock gulped and took a step closer. “I realize that now.”
A couple of days passed before John was nearly fully conscious, and able enough to open his eyes without flinching. His skin felt dry and unwashed; his face was unshaved and quite despicable if he were honest to himself. He was cold yet knew he’d get overheated easily, so he remained shirtless with the blanket just up to his waist. The thick bandage over his left shoulder wrapped around his chest diagonally; it went under his right arm and around his back. His left arm was in a sling held stable against his chest and lifted slightly by a pillow. The sling itched around his neck, making matters irritatingly worse.
“You’ll eat too.” Sherlock nodded, even though he knew it wasn’t a question. John squeezed his hand and grinned.
John looked at the box curiously, and then at Sherlock. Sherlock stood in front of him, still, with his hands placed in front of him, and very nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet with nerves.
Sherlock smirked that she got caught, then realized something and his eyes widened. Quickly he stared down at her murderously, and said, “You kept giving John the drug.”
*            *            *
They arrived home by the time it was past noon, and John slowly led Sherlock into his chair. He hung up their coats, turned the kettle on, and then gave Sherlock his tea. Sherlock seemed to relax significantly more whenever he had tea. It seemed to comfort him, which John would accept no matter what it was that was doing the comfort; seeing Sherlock relax was in itself a miracle.
This time Sherlock scoffed and went back to reading, however he didn’t fail to notice John’s smirk. Fifteen minutes later, John cleaned his dishes when Sherlock’s phone rang.
Yay! The final 8 hours!!
“Hungry, John?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft, who shook his head. Bauer hadn’t spoken yet, his expression said.
, 2014? He was with me, in London. You Americans may not know this, but I spent some time away, and came back in March. We spent nearly all of spring together, like a pre-honeymoon, without the sex. Until summer of course.”
Sherlock took a step back and looked around the room. There was tinsel framing the sliding glass door and along the outer rim of the plastic wall. There was a reef on the door, on the part where it wouldn’t fall off if it were opened, and another on the wall, diagonally from John’s bed but not inside his room. There were lights hung along the wall and parallel with the tinsel on the plastic. Sherlock had taped holly over the both walls, and even managed to place a small plastic Christmas tree in the corner, decorated with red and gold ornaments, lights, and a star on top. Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back, proud of his work, and slid his chair to the plastic barrier as close as he could get it, before sitting down.
“Er, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Hansel and Gretel…”
“Take this. You’ll feel better.”
“Anthea Smith, you are under arrest. We’re taking you to interrogation where you’ll be questioned.” They’re speech drifted off as they left the room. Mary stayed behind, and looked at Sherlock.
John lied against the pillow and shrugged, uncertain about everything, it seemed. Sherlock seemed unsure too, but he continued anyway.
“Well, then how was she drugged at home?”

“You did research as did I. He began emerging in medical journals around the time of Moriarty’s return. He’d spent time in the army too, which fits Moran’s supposed background: military experience and such forth.” Sherlock explained quickly.
“Good. Maybe I can take a look later and see when you can get the stitches taken out,” John said kindly. Sherlock nodded in response.
“Ah, it’ll be lovely. I’ll make you two a cuppa, just this once.”
Sherlock had flinched, or because of where Sherlock’s hand was going.
“Were you ever going to tell me?” John asked, stroking Sherlock’s hair back and reapplying the damp cloth to his forehead.
Lestrade nodded, but before he could respond, or even stand up, Sherlock stood up fiercely and rounded at Sally.
Sherlock didn’t speak for another hour, as he waited for the tests to return and was going through the computer for whatever information he could find that John couldn’t. With a quick “John, come look at this” John was behind Sherlock, looking over his shoulder at a news article dating back two years ago.
Sherlock looked at him, suddenly in wonder. Now that he thought about it, he couldn’t remember the past few days.
“So, what, the shooter was a woman?” Lestrade offered skeptically.
“John!”
“Jesus what the hell happened?” Lestrade asked as he ran towards them.
“What it is?”
He inhaled and eyed his brother, lowering his voice. “If I were to…not come back from this,” he said with hesitation, “don’t tell him that I had survived the fall. Dying once in front of him was enough, hearing about my actual death would break him, that I’m sure of.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John slowly managed to focus more, and noticed he was still in the straight jacket. He tried to toss and turn, but the jacket didn’t budge.
“…Mycroft’s having it tested, so we have to wait and see.”
Sighing, John nodded in response and turned to Sherlock. Sherlock looked at him with a raised brow.
Sherlock sighed heavily. “I am clean.”
“…No—no! I-I wish it had happened when you were alive but now…it’s too late.”
“What about?”
“Fine then,” Sherlock leaned forward and placed his hands on the table, lacing them together. “I’ll tell you what I know and we’ll go from there.”
Sherlock wanted to know what he was going to say, so he gave a curt nod, encouraging John to continue.
“Sentiment.”
John was the first to exit the hospital, enter the cab, and leave the cab as they pulled up to Baker Street. Sherlock followed him closely, wary that he might pass out at any moment. John was clearly in a lot of pain, now that the last dose of morphine from that morning had run its course.
John inhaled and looked up. “Are you alright?” he asked barely above a whisper.
“At first no. For a while, sure, but I had my doubts. Still do.”
“Hm?”
“You forgot dinner.”
Sherlock stared at him, his face reddening with hurt or anger—John couldn’t tell, and didn’t know which he’d prefer. “Of course not! If it weren’t for cases in the first place—” Sherlock cut himself off and closed his mouth shut.

“Killed himself.”
11:59:58 PM
The man took his shirt off and revealed a spider web-like scar over his left shoulder. There was a flicker of self-consciousness in the man’s eyes as he tensed, so Sherlock looked away. The man above him smiled shyly and relaxed; he leaned in closer to catch Sherlock’s lips, but the detective turned his head away. He never kissed anyone during sex; maybe a quick one in the end but he never initiated it. The man chuckled.
John looked at him with longing, tears rolling down his cheeks. He was sadly disappointed.
So only one option remained: sex. He could have a wank, but sex was honestly quicker. For him to get himself off, he’d have to think on something specifically and he really wasn’t in the mood to do that. He could think about John, but that was dangerously crossing the imaginary (and almost completely pointless) line. Might as well have someone else do it for him. He won’t even remember their name.
Victor broke the silence. “Sherlock and I met in university,” he said. John looked up at him, his curiosity rising and his need for a distraction. Victor met his eyes and continued. “I was the one who got him into drugs.”
Mycroft smirked and then replied in a slow but empty threat. “Are you admitting that you the high-functioning sociopathic Sherlock Holmes has found a way to feel?”
John picked at his lunch, ignoring Sherlock’s concern stare. Sherlock was in his chair, lacking his coat even, indicating he wasn’t going to leave anytime soon.
*            *            *
John figured. Sherlock could get so wrapped up in a case he’d neglect to answer his phone whenever it rang with a call. Hopefully he was getting somewhere with the case though.
A few seconds passed in silence. Ten exactly. Finally, a heartbeat appeared on the monitor. Then another one followed. Then another. John’s heart rate rose after a few moments to a steady rhythm, his chest moving in sync with slow short breaths being exhaled out of his mouth. A nurse placed an oxygen mask over his mouth and settled him in the bed. The medical faculty eased their way out of the room with murmurs to each other regarding hourly check ups and other various medical needs.
John let out a choked sigh and looked up at Sherlock, his eyes heavy with exhaustion.
“Get off of me! Please—” John’s voice trembled, and he tried to move away, but he was aware of the wet floor and really didn’t want to slip.
sentiment.” John lightly told the detective. “As your arch enemy told me.”
thanks for reading and stay tuned next week for chapter 7 and PLEASE comment, they really make my day :)
“Moran is coming for you John.” Mycroft exclaimed, straining his neck to look behind the seat. “My men were tailing him; he was spotted nearby where you were attacked and had been chasing him for the past couple of hours. He was last seen getting into a truck—no doubt he has help now. We need to get you two somewhere—.”
He looked up at John, focusing on his face.
John stared at him, and then sighed with defeat.
“Kingston’s been spotted.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was hesitant, and clearly surprised by Sherlock sudden movement.
It took them nearly twenty minutes to get back to the MI6 building. First responders were being escorted out by private investigations, who were under orders to initiate a private investigation and keep it out of the public media as much as possible. It was already proving difficulty, as there were several news vans stationed just across the street, with reporters already reporting to cameras.
“No it’s NOT the only way!” John’s hand trembled but he composed himself and continued aiming the gun at Moran, who’s own gun hadn’t moved from Sherlock’s head. He inhaled deeply and continued. “You gave me the key to the handcuffs—obviously you wanted me to escape, and I know you did it so I could follow you, not to prove that you don’t care about me. I believe we can be extraordinary together—we can make us work, I know we can, but you have to live.”
There was a sound of footsteps behind him. He turned around and saw Sherlock entering the flat. Sherlock hovered by the door, dressed in his coat and a suit.
“Help him!” Sherlock demanded. Something in his eyes must have been fierce, because Margaret stopped in her attempt to take him away, and proceeded in gathering whatever John needed.
“Excuse me—”
He left, parting the door again, and turning off the hall lights. Sherlock dressed for bed and lay down and stared at the ceiling. He stayed awake for sometime, thinking, until he glanced at the clock and realized it was well past midnight.
“Nothing—.”
Sherlock glared at him. “You are not fine.” He snapped. “When we get back to shore, I am taking you to the hospital and you are having the surgery.” Sherlock ordered sternly.
Abruptly, John inhaled sharply, and clenched the sheets with his fist. Sherlock stilled in his movements, and then placed the cloth over John’s forehead. He leaned closer, placing his hand over John’s shoulder and shaking him slightly.
John smirked at the hint of Sherlock’s familiar tone, and continued.
John’s heart throbbed hard in his chest. “I-I thought—.”
John nodded, and watched her leave. She reappeared after a few minutes, and handed him what he needed.
Please enjoy this last short chapter! Entirely fluff... well for the most part :)
John’s face paled.
John exhaled. His head hurt and something felt tacky on his forehead. He furrowed his brows, but that only made it worse. He must have shown in on his face because Sherlock bit his lip and looked even more concerned than he had a second ago, however possible.
Before Sherlock could answer, Mycroft slipped into the room and stood behind the detective. “Doctor…” He raised an eyebrow expectantly.
“John?”
John nodded and leaned forward. He pressed a quick kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s lower back, basking in the warm water raining onto them.
John giggled beside him. “It’s sound like you’re just happy. An orgasm will do that to you, in case you haven’t noticed.”
“Please, don’t apologize again. This has just been…I mean, it’s shown the worst of us, and the best. You’ve been brilliant, Sherlock, and I…I love you,” John said quickly, inhaling deeply afterwards. Sherlock relaxed and nodded as he returned the hug.
Involved, yes. But the killer, no.
“It’s my decision. Besides it’s not as if I can wear it in bed anyway—”
This time, Mycroft scoffed. “About him still being married yet having an affair with one of his interns.”
Sherlock stroked his hair with his gloved hand, and held John’s hand with his other. Regina and Margaret tidied the room up, and then resealed the barrier as they left.
John looked at him. He could feel his eyes well up with tears, so he blinked a few times and reached for Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it.
Sherlock ignored him and pulled his shirt apart, revealing a damaged bulletproof vest.
John just nodded.
He wheeled himself across the room and into a larger one. There were stairs to his left, and a small desk in the corner near the backdoor, which led to a porch. A small gap between the trees lined perfectly with the outside pathway, and Sherlock caught a glimpse of the glittering cold water swaying in the distance.
warning: angst a bit... and mild graphic violence
He took a step closer to John’s legs, removed the blanket, and then held John’s knee with his hands. Sherlock held it still, and then tried to massage the thigh, going upwards in firm rotations. John relaxed for a moment, and his brows furrowed in confusion. Suddenly, he bolted upright and glared at Sherlock.
John tightened his embrace and rested his cheek against the man’s head of curls. His eyes prickled with tears but he blinked them away. “Did you seriously just quote Wordsworth?”
*            *            *
Sherlock peered at her, narrowing his eyes. “How’s your mother?”
John absentmindedly nodded. Alex had showed him with the practice ones, but none of those were
Glass shards splattered across the floor, his precious liver slopping down with it, the fluids surrounding it spilling over the shard-covered floor. Annoyed, Sherlock turned abruptly to face the cause of the crash, only to collide with the person again and slip on the fluids. The pair tumbled down with muffles of apologies, all coming from the other man.
“Will you help me?”
“Like what?”
Sherlock furrowed his brows. This woman—Mary—turned to the detective and smiled. Sherlock didn’t like her smile—it was cheeky, triumphant, and cold.
Sherlock was silent for a moment. “Ms. Ellis, we’ll look into it. We’ll start with the nursing home, and would like to take a look at your mother’s place—unless she lives with you?”
Three months. That was how long it’s been since his fall. Six weeks spent in the hospital before being rushed to the safe house. Sherlock had never been this bored and useless in his entire life, which John dismissed as him being overly dramatic. John tried to keep him busy, helping him with his exercises and even playing board games with him. It had worked, but only for a short while. He was on the sofa, his usual spot during the day, with his head closest to the fireplace and his feet on the other end, where the door was.
John blushed deeper and looked away nodding. “Alright sure. Let me help you up…”
“We don’t have lube, or condoms.” John stated.
He vowed to himself this would his last one and then John won’t have to know and he could overcome it on his own. However, deep in his mind he knew he was kidding himself. But whatever doubt he had left in his mind had drowned by the overwhelming crave to escape the sentiment. It was tragic, that Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective, had finally felt something, something greater the simple word it takes as its name and chose to disregard it; chose to consider it unrequited and a waste of time to feel it. Anxiously and quickly Sherlock removed his coat and jacket, rolled up his sleeve, tied his belt above his elbow, and injected the drug.
“Good afternoon, John. I understand you had a partial seizure yesterday.”
Nearly twenty minutes later, he heard a loud thud coming from the bathroom. He knew it was going to happen, and instantly wished he had confronted John about it beforehand. He raised his head and shouted John’s name, but not expecting an answer, and didn’t receive one.
John took deep breaths, closing his eyes in heavy blinks. Swallowing thickly, he spoke.
Sherlock tightened underneath him. “It’s not okay, I need to keep looking. You go and—.”
“I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
“The surgeon got the tumor out, John.” Sherlock said calmly. “There was a little bit of bleeding but they fixed it. Erm, your kidneys are a bit slow but you’re should be fine. You’ll be okay."
Shillcott did so, and Sherlock observed the figure’s gait. It wasn’t like John’s at all. The doppelganger wasn’t even trying to fool anyone, just taking the face for granted.
Sherlock creased his brows. “I’m not. I’m trying to figure out how to get you free. Again,” he added lightly, but his tone didn’t match his eyes. John grinned anyway.
Sherlock ignored the voice and continued to think.
Sherlock remotely tensed but John caught it.
“Then why—.”
“Then you tell me what you dreamt of. What about your case earlier, you haven’t told me—”
“I’m not sure what you’re asking, John,” Sherlock said slowly. John was momentarily surprised, and then swallowed tightly and focused on his tongue. He pressed his lips together and then released them.
“Just some poppies,” he stated with a warm tone. “There’s not much of a selection here.”
Sherlock turned to John, a question on his face. John nodded.
Sherlock tried to keep his hold around John steady, but he was straining himself as he leaned over the tub. Sherlock quickly stood on his knees and pulled John upwards into a sitting position, harsher than before. John yelped and tried to move away.
John shook his head.
John uncrossed his arms and clenched his fists. He took a step back and paced slightly in the spot, his head down and his brows furrowed. After about a minute, he looked at Sherlock, and then decreased the space between them. He stopped right by his bedside, and leaned forward slightly. His arms were halfway raised, his hands nearly reaching out to him.
John swallowed tightly, and glanced at Sherlock, but was taken aback. Sherlock was staring at him like he did when he was put out—like his usual self. John instantly relaxed with the familiar expression, but wasn’t expecting the tone that followed.
“I can keep my bag here. There’s no point in putting it up there.”
“Hm?” Sherlock seemed distracted for a moment, but then nodded with realization. “Oh, the case. It was clever, oh, John, you would have loved it!”
Sherlock sighed.
Dr. Smith fidgeted slightly. “Not for at least four more weeks.”
don’t blame you.”
“Oh, well when I first saw this car, I saw this guy inside, and then I heard voices coming closer, so I hid. I then hovered by the door, and waited. I decided not to come inside until you saw me.”
“When is your anniversary?”
“Now you’re touching me!? You flinch every other time. We barely kiss anymore without a flinch—”
“Not hungry,” John replied. “The medication doesn’t go well with an appetite.”
John squeezed his eyes shut and inhaled through his nose. “Months ago—it wasn’t on the scans—.”
~~~~~~~
would have been a (disappointing) surprise.
“I’m not sure. It all seems to be happening so fast. You were dead to me this morning.”
It wasn’t until after he took aware of his surroundings when Sherlock realized he had moaned the man’s name during his orgasm.
“Well at least we’re together,” John offered lightly, despite the situation.
He didn’t hear anyone in the room, so he slowly opened his eyes. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted. The room was windowless apart from a circular one on one wall, half covered by the sea level. He sat up stiffly, and looked around. There was an empty desk and chair, and then the bed he was on. Apart from that, the room was empty. The white door on the other side was closed; John didn’t bother checking it just yet; it would probably be locked anyway.
“Do you have any idea of this story Silken wants to complete?”
All promising amusement vanished, and his face fell. Sherlock stilled, and looked from John’s hand to his face. He put down the fruit cup, and took a spoon. He prepared a small serving, and then held it up to John’s mouth, his expression serious and straight-faced.
Willoughby cleared his throat.
“What happens now?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded, and slowly started to relax.
Vanessa nodded sympathetically. “We had reduced the preventive medication, but we may have to go back to giving him some.”
Sherlock sighed dramatically, as if he was on the verge of rolling his eyes. He shed his coat off and flung it out of reach. “I’m unarmed, not wired, and now cold. You have the upper hand here.”
John nodded and stood up. “Thanks, Molly.”
, John. It’s disappointing and utterly dull.”
CHAPTER 9
I apologize, I'm not familiar with London or how harbors work/look like there, so keep in mind that this is fiction.
John took his offered hand and stood up stiffly, but then his foot slipped again, and he fell forward into Sherlock’s arms. He glanced around and realized people were staring. John’s face reddened. He stabled his feet on the wet ground, and pulled away.
Sherlock hit the plastic again, and turned to Margaret. “Can someone go in there? Sedate him—.”
John scoffed and glared at Sherlock. “First you pretend to be a ghost. Then you try to hide a drug relapse. And then you assure me that we’re safe and this Moran guy is as good as dead, well guess what Sherlock? This whole thing of keeping
John scoffed. “Of course I feel guilty, but that’s not why I’m staying. For years you said you were a sociopath but then you jump of a roof for people. For me! And I want to make your life as easier as possible—.”
“Moran’s through with him. And Mary. He’s in it for something else.”
, 2010.”
John parted his mouth and formed a word, but couldn’t seem to voice it. Instead, he managed a raspy sigh. His cheeks burning, he shut his mouth closed and looked away.
The two had barely spoken a word to each other, apart from “pass the milk”, or any other variation of that. Sometimes they had informed the other of their daily plan and where they were going, but it didn’t last. All John knew was that Sherlock had a case. Lestrade had called him two days after their “break” had started. John had asked Sherlock if he wanted him to tag along, but Sherlock had seemed reluctant, so John dropped it. He had his appointments anyway.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows. “You think so?”
Moran stepped behind the man and pulled the ski mask over his face. Sherlock remained impassive to the sight of Bauer.
John looked at Sherlock and shrugged. “Hadn’t thought about it.”
“Molly examined the body. He only has one injury.”
John situated himself back into bed, grinning slightly from the successful walk. He managed to walk down the hall and back to his room—with Sherlock and Mandy by his side of course—but he did manage quite a few steps without their constant aid. It was truly uplifting, and he found he couldn’t stop smiling.
“No matter what, I still would have been,” Sherlock quietly said. “It was…traumatizing.” John furrowed his eyebrows and remained serious.
Sherlock sighed. “Fine. Give me a pot.”
“P-please…” John shuddered, his eyes glazed over and unfocused. “He’s down there, I want Sh-lock, I want—.” Tears slipped from his closed eyelids, falling down his cheekbones. He wasn’t looking at Sherlock, but up at the sky, the rainclouds thundering in the distance as the rain began to pick up again.
“Get to the point Mycroft.” Sherlock snapped.
“I do.” Sherlock kissed him deeply. He trailed his hand from John’s back to his chest and grazed the metal plate hanging over his breastplate. “Very much,” he whispered.
“No, it’ll be boring,” Sherlock said dismissively.
“Mrs. Hudson had washed them already. She cleaned the flat too.”
“So it was someone else. It’s someone who has a vendetta against her. Magnussen said he knew people who wanted her dead.”
“It may be too late.” The hallucination’s face reformed to the look of sympathy.
Sherlock hummed in agreement. “Let’s go home now.”
John stilled at the sound of his voice. He carefully stood up and closed the blinds, then turned on the bedside table lamp and looked at Sherlock.
John stood up roughly, and noted with satisfaction that Willoughby was nearly unconscious. Greg stepped forward finally and held out a hand to keep John away, but they both knew it was for show.
“Sherlock.” John whispered.
John only became angrier, and managed to keep his gaze on the ceiling. “You couldn’t,” he said tightly.
“I-I don’t know, after I gave him some pain meds, he was fine for a bit,” Regina stuttered. “But then he started to have chills. I turned up the heat just slightly, but then he started to sweat, so I turned it down. He then began to mutter—it seemed he was talking to you, but then he mentioned someone named Sholto, and then a James, and then you again. I tried to talk him through it, but then he panicked and ripped his IV out. We haven’t been able to sedate him.”
“I did. It’s in safekeeping. If John is right, then I don’t want to take any risks.”
“Right. Um, well, I just thought it was strange; the lungs on both of them are damaged quite severely, almost as if they were smokers or in a fire of some sort, but their histories say they weren’t. And their kidneys, it’s as if they had shut down on the spot. Um, well you can take a look, see if you see anything…” she trailed off bashfully, and took a step back. Sherlock placed some gloves on and examined the male victim’s chest cavity and organs.
“Good.” Mycroft pulled the photos to the bigger screen. The photos showed Bauer and John, and to an ordinary person it would appear to be the same men being held in this very building.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “But what about…that?” He pointed again, with his eyes.
Sherlock was still running after the man, and was catching up to him quickly. John ran after them, and nearly caught up with them. Suddenly, Sherlock lost his footing and slipped on a black patch of ice. He fell with his feet in the air and landed hard on his back. John hurried towards him, paused, and looked down at his husband as the other man ran off.
“We just…need to be straight with each other from now on.”
Robbins entered and went around to John’s other side.
The nurse proceeded with care and soon enough, his shoulder was bandaged and placed in a sling. She began to clean the neck wound, but was interrupted.
John’s eyes widened slightly, a bit disappointed in what Sherlock was doing. However, he thought Victor sounded almost like he was tattling on Sherlock, rather than informing where he was. John softened his expression and shrugged.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, his voice pained. He bowed his head but didn’t loosen his hold. John leaned heavily into it and continued to shift in pain, clutching at his shoulder and keeping his eyes tightly closed.
“Fine.” Kim responded without a question as to how he knew.
Moran challenged him. “Get on your knees.”
“Gee, I don’t know. What do you think?” Sherlock’s innocent tone was clearly faked. John rolled his eyes, his patience running low.
Sherlock sighed as if he was bored. “100, 93, 86, 79, 73, 66, 60, 54—I mean,” Sherlock paused, furrowed his brows, and was silent for a few seconds. “100…93… 86, 79…72… 65…58, 51, 44, 37, 30, 23, 16, 9…2…”
He quickened his pace and stopped in front of them, quickly glancing at John, who appeared as normal as he could be.
John sounded out the word, and slowly produced it, starting out as a sigh and ending with a vibrated m.
Moran stared at him. “Very well…” He said and remained silent. A muffled voice broke the silence, appearing to be coming from Moran’s earpiece. It went quiet as Moran raised an eyebrow, his eyes peering just slightly behind the detective, looking into the glass door.
“Good.” He grinned at his lover, but hesitated before continuing. He could sense something was still tense, but couldn’t think of what without asking. “Um, Sherlock?”
He sat stiffly in his chair and pinched his nose. Sherlock stepped in front of him.
“So which was it?” Sherlock asked absently.
thank you for reading this! and for being patient!
Sherlock pushed aside the paramedic and rushed forward. The man turned the laptop to the Holmes brothers and they viewed security footage with a clear view of the SUV that took John. It appeared they were heading towards a deserted harbor.
The nurse nodded in response and bagged the clothes.
“Exactly! They’ll expect us to make a move.” Lee sighed. “But, I am here as being asked to by your brother, so I’ll follow his orders.” He looked at Mycroft, and then Sherlock did. Mycroft looked at the both of them, and then sighed.
“So I was right about everything.”
“Was that the first time she joined you?”
“What? Pleasure?” Sherlock snapped.
The hospital staff checked for any serious injuries, and then observed his back. After a while of waiting, an orthopedic doctor entered the room.
“So you’re avoiding me,” the man stated.
Jack nodded knowingly and gave them a final nod before turning around and heading to a waiting car. Mycroft stepped away to Anthea, and John turned to Sherlock, his eyes softening with fondness.
“Positive. None of them are.”
“Let’s get back to bed.”
Sherlock prepared to focus on his own release, when the man spoke from behind him.
“It’s something I can do for you. Last year, at the hospital, I was told I was gaining back some sensory, and with practice, could walk a little bit. Molly helped.”
Before Sherlock could do anything, John scurried away as much as he could. He mumbled incoherently and stumbled away, reaching the edge of the docks.
John looked at him for a moment and then slowly relaxed and let go of his hold. “Good,” he whispered. Sherlock headed back out the door, and quickly motioned Mary for her attention. He spoke to her briefly, and then she left.
“How did you do that, by the way?
Upon reaching their bed, Willoughby stepped closer. “How is he, John?”
“We’ll still be keeping an eye out for some time, but yes, it’s over now. After John recovers, you can return back to Baker Street.”
John swallowed his bite of toast and uncertainly nodded, pushing the table away. Sherlock sat in his chair, keeping his coat on and his back straight. He looked at the paper and then at John.
[2 weeks later]
“Yes,” Sherlock replied hungrily. John grinned and placed his legs over Sherlock’s shoulders. He leaned forward and began pressing faint kisses on the inside of John’s thigh. John was already wiggling beneath him, his fists loosely clenching the duvet.
“I don’t see the point if we’ll be having a second round.”
“I know, I just—.”
“Hey…what, er, happened?” he asked hoarsely.
“January 29
John sighed. “He was wearing a kind of ski mask.” He looked at the ground, the icy stare turning into plain hurt and disappointment.
Relief flooded John, quickly followed by a gasp and a sore throat. The word felt odd in his mouth—it was elongated and a little high—and it sounded off. John exhaled slowly and refused to look at Sherlock.
“Yes, it’s fine. I’ll let you know once I find him.”
Mary had only visited three times in the past two weeks. They were long visits, but spread out. They felt more like odd dates and updates about John’s current condition. She didn’t talk about trying to get him out sooner except for assuring him that she was trying. It almost seemed like she avoided that topic all together, yet she always brought it up the minute she arrived.
Mary looked down and headed to the door. “I’m sorry, John.”
John’s eyes widened, and his stunt on the window momentarily vanished from his mind. “For what?” he managed in a hoarse whisper.
The man in question hesitantly raised his head from his palms and found himself looking up to a freshly dressed Sherlock—unlike the disheveled self he had seen minutes after a restless sleep.
“If this fades or washes away, will you keep writing it?”
“John?” Sherlock pried.
“I-I don’t think I’m going to last long—.” John declared.
please comment! I might update again tomorrow, we'll see (it's getting close to the angst-to-the-nth-degree). My shift is very early in the morning, and then I work the next morning. Just stay tuned, or subscribe for updates. You can also check my tumblr and ask if you have concerns/questions. :)
But then Sherlock spun on his heel and stormed down the hallway, and then slammed the door. John swayed by the silent outburst, and then hoped forward. His crutches were still upstairs though, so he hopped down the hall as carefully as he could, holding onto passing furniture and the wall to keep his balance and catch his breath.
“It’s…lovely,” he stated awkward. John smiled anyway and looked back at the ocean in front of them, unaware of Sherlock’s eyes glistening against the light.
“I don’t remember—.” Sherlock’s breathing hitched, and John leaned forward, gathering Sherlock into his arms again.
“Why were you sleeping on the floor?”
“Can you try to speak, John?” Mandy asked. “Normally, you’d talk to a speech therapist, but let’s just see for now.”
John opened eyes slightly and met Sherlock’s gaze. He took hold of his hand and squeezed.
Sherlock sighed heavily and looked at John, his eyes flickering as he contemplated. John waited patiently, holding his breath.
Sherlock sighed and stood back up, looking at the evidence pinned to the board.
“Why don’t you finish your experiments,” John offered, but all he got was another scowl.
“Apparently, one of his networks, or actually, one person in particular got under our radar and reorganized a group, the Grimms Kartell.”
“Lean on me, can you—.”
“I’m going to the garden shed, if you need anything.”
“Large motor vehicle, small house made out of logs, and feeding utensil with a small oval-like bowl.”
“No it’s not. You’re too young,” John said reassuringly.
“What do they usually say?” the man continued.
“Mhm, yes.”
“I thought—,” John started.
Sherlock sauntered into the main room, eying the group of people with a look of indifference. Two men in black suits stood behind Sebastian Moran, and Kim stood beside him, however she was looking unconformable with the situation. Mycroft stood to Moran’s right, his face matching his brother’s. He glanced down at Sherlock’s left hand, raised his eyebrows, and yet kept his reaction to himself.
“Shepherd?”
Sherlock was now frustrated as he headed back to the hospital late Christmas morning. It had been too simple—he could have solved it sooner. There wasn’t much to solve, but as he headed back to John, he recalled on the story of Rumpelstiltskin and Snow White, and from now on didn’t really like fairytales.
inspired too based off this ask I got :)  http://fortheloveofjawn.tumblr.com/post/141151486127/i-have-a-sad-headcanon-that-long-after-the-three
John stared at him. He felt a familiar twinge of anger rising up in his chest—an anger he hadn’t felt in months—the anger that would come about whenever he came across a body part in the fridge or something like that.
Sherlock’s brows creased and he remained silent, his eyes focusing on John’s face as if he was processing something. Suddenly, his eyes widened and before John could ask what was wrong, Sherlock sat straight up and vomited over John’s knees.
The room sighed with relief. They sufficiently cleaned things up and left accordingly. The doctor checked John’s breathing and found he was trying to breath on his own.
*            *            *
The car came to an abrupt halt; Sherlock looked towards the front and saw a black van blocking their way. John tensed beside him, and started reaching for his gun from Sherlock’s pocket. The driver honked the horn, but instead of moving, the van’s doors opened, and a group of five masked men exited it, some holding large guns and pointing it at the car.
A blurry figure faced John, but he could still tell who it was. The unruly hair was more matted down as his vision cleared, and the ocean eyes were the first to come into focus. He felt a wave of warmth down his body—it was truly heart-warming.
Sherlock glanced at him then looked away. “No.”
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped at the sensation of John’s hand and thrusted up against him. John’s dog tag rubbed against Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock shivered beneath him, the cool metal no doubt being the reason. John increased his pace at the sight of it, watching his tag graze Sherlock’s spine with every thrust.
Mycroft nodded. “I’m afraid Sherlock should be the one to explain everything else. I’m only here for a short time.”
“Ah, yes, you’re with Sherlock. What is he up to?”
“Sherlock,” he said more sternly.
“Your partner left a couple of hours ago, we haven’t been able to reach him.”
John grinned. “I would have, yeah. Afterwards, they took me to a basement but I escaped. I’ll explain everything when we’re…”
“So…” John looked back to Moran, gun pointed at his chest. “Moran is it? Where’s your sniper?”
The blogger blinked and stiffly nodded.
“Is this some kind of popular trivia I have the fortune of not knowing?” Sherlock asked mockingly as he turned around back towards the room.
“That’s one way of seeing it. It is a high likelihood that Moran will kidnap John. You can tell John that Moran is alive, but I recommend not telling him that he will be kidnapped in few days time.”
John cleared his throat. “What?”
“Should I—.”
“I don’t know!” John snapped. He appeared to be bothered by it too, but he definitely knew more than Sherlock.
“Mycroft, what happened?” Sherlock walked towards his brother, his voice firm and his posture tense with a hidden sense of worry.
“I’m sorry.” John muttered under his breath.
Sherlock slowly smiled. “All right, John. As long as we are together, we can wait.”
He left with a cheerful smile, and then Sherlock was provided with a clean set of scrubs and a temporary chair before being left alone with Mycroft.
“Only if you don’t,” Sherlock murmured back, with a slight laugh escaping his lips. John laughed softly, and recaptured his lips. Sherlock trailed a finger along John’s cheek sending a shiver through his body. He felt Sherlock’s finger graze the scars, but this time he didn’t cringe. For a split moment, he basked in this new attention, but John’s thoughts quickly trailed away as Sherlock kissed him harder and more desperately. John kissed him back, allowing his mind to simply wander with the feel of Sherlock against his body. This wasn’t the end, John knew, it was only the beginning. And, neither of them could wait anymore. This was their future. Together, the wait was over.
John gritted his teeth and pointed to the shower. “Just go and shower, now,” he said firmly.
John looked towards the detective and took in his careless position. His brow furrowed in concern. “You okay?” He asked as he walked towards Sherlock.
Sherlock stared at his brother, narrowing his eyes. He stared at his brother for several minutes, participating in silent deductions and an arguing conversation. With finality, it was Mycroft who broke the silence, seriousness and warning leaking profusely in his tone.
“Not now I’m working.”
He cleaned John’s face, and caressed his cheek before putting the supplies away. The ventilator hissed with each breath it gave John, and it sent a shiver down Sherlock’s spine. It was just like before, months ago, before John was declared comatose. He was attached to one of those for days, and then he was able to breath on his own, giving Sherlock hope. But he hadn’t woken up then.
John grunted with pain and nearly lost his footing. Sherlock stood straight yet tense, glaring at Moran.
“Let’s try and sit him up,” she said.
“I’m here by your own doing. Whenever you question your actions or recall my own—doubt, anger and desire for answers would portray me. I am not real. You know that. You also know how I—how Sherlock, truly feels for you. I am not him. I’m just here for you. You don’t want me to be here and yet you always feel a wave of tranquility whenever I appear, so that’s what you need to ask yourself. Do you ever want to see me again or not?”
“I think so too. I’m sorry, I didn’t know—.” He huffed with frustration.
Sherlock was staring at him, his eyes clear and his face calm.
Sherlock stared at him. It was nearly a full two minutes before he responded.
John heard him, but it took him a few seconds to understand. He continued to furrow his eyebrows, in which Sherlock took as a sign to continue to speak.
Sherlock looked at him, his brows furrowing.
Sherlock froze in shock, his eyes widening at his sudden outburst. John kept his face in place from the blow, and slowly after a few deep breathes, he turned to look at the detective. His eyes were fuming—roaring with an ocean of emotions—as he held a hard stare.
Without turning around, Sherlock held John and leapt off the boat. They fell into the cold depths feet first, concurrently as a gunshot rang in the night sky.
John offered him a hand, but Sherlock ignored it and stood up. Smirking, John eyed the man’s hand, observing the stitches.
Enjoy.
“John, breathe,” Sherlock demanded, but it wasn’t out of sternness. He was concerned; his eyes glistened against the moonlight, and he was paler than usual. John could feel Sherlock trembling, but then thought maybe it was just him.
John gasped and looked up at Victor, who was looking at him closely and then at the alarms.
At home, John prepared himself some lunch whilst Sherlock looked over the journals. Most of the notes were about medical ideas and procedures, but based off the entries from four months ago, Ellis’ started recording his wife’s symptoms.
They rode the elevator in silence, and then they made it to John’s room. He placed the walkers against the wall, and then climbed into bed. Sherlock sat in his chair, and then let out a slow sigh. John stared at him, and then he realized.
“Well, Mr. Holmes, I have some good news.”
“Breath, Sherlock,”
“Fuck!” He inhaled sharply, then reached for his phone, and called again, but once again ending up with voicemail.
She fell silent for a minute, before speaking softly. “How’d he do it?”
“I’m sorry, John, I didn’t mean to snap. And, I didn’t mean to hurt you—”
Sherlock glanced at him for split second and then looked down at John’s stump. Sherlock knelt down onto his knees and very slowly raised his hand to John’s stump. John fought hard not to flinch, but his thigh did, and he held his breath, afraid Sherlock was going to walk away. Sherlock swallowed tightly and held his hand in place for a few seconds before continuing. He placed his hand gently on the end, and held it there. John slowly relaxed, suddenly wanting to bask in the warmth of Sherlock’s touch, but was unsure how long this was going to last. It felt like forever since he felt a simple touch like this, although John remembered the attempt at a massage several days ago. But after so much tension, this tingled John’s senses in a different way—a good way.
“Everything all right?”
“Is that a problem?” The detective asked lightly.
“Oh,” John replied and paused. “Do you work here or something?”
“Shower first. You smell like day old sex.”
“Sherlock.” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “It’ll make everything easier. You won’t have to sit behind that plastic wall, and it’ll only be—.” He took a breath, and winced. “It’ll only be until the antibiotic is ready. Only a couple of days, right?”
He opened the room and found Dr. Willoughby disposing gloves into the bin in the far corner, and the CAT scans were placed on the light screen, but it wasn’t on. He spotted Sherlock starring at the door, and slowly lifted his gaze at John.
“I…hadn’t taken them off yet.”
John scoffed. “Tell that to my face, and then I’ll believe you.”
*            *            *

John nodded. Sherlock pulled the shirt over John’s head, and helped get it in place. He grabbed some socks and placed them on John’s feet. He then stood up and sighed.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize…” John shrugged. “I just thought we would take it slow. Try at things and get used to everything slowly before jumping into…this.”
Lucy stood up, her face beaming despite her eyes still saddened. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes!”
“John?” Sherlock prompted.
After several minutes, Sherlock leaned back slightly and gazed up at John. “I need to be with you—we need, can we—”
“Go ahead and practice some more,” the prosthetist said. “Alex will be here shortly, and then you’ll be done for the day.”
Sherlock rushed forward to his friend’s side. He twisted him around and cradled him in his arms to study the wound. The cut from the accident had clotted, but another cut had been afflicted above it, bleeding just slightly. Sherlock felt for a pulse on John’s neck and found one steady.
“John.”
Sherlock glanced around and spotted his chair, which was on its side, once of the handles missing and a wheel bent. John followed his gaze and noticing the chair, and rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly.
“Nothing? You’d be brilliant…”
Sherlock shook his head but relaxed. “No, they’re from MI6 and CTU. Mary must have informed Mycroft.”
“Hush, love. Go to sleep,” John murmured gently. The last thing Sherlock felt as he fell into a blissful sleep was a light kiss pressed against his cheekbone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The man raised his hands up, and looked intently at John who was running towards him, silently urging him to stop. But John was still far away, and was crossing the street, when a screeching car emerged from the corner and speed in the direction to where John was. Sherlock halted in his tracks, his eyes widening as John suddenly realized himself what was happening.
The man’s face was covered with soot and blood, but he was alive and aware, and unmistakably John.
By the time he woke up from his doze, it was dark outside, and the sound of dishes echoed from the kitchen.
“Like I said, he’s barely involved. Whenever the government has been on their tracks, it appears they would place Kingston in their sight, have time to cover up their tracks and manage to reel him in before he gets caught. Talk to him, take the deal.”
Willoughby indicated the chair and John sat down, his initial impression confirmed.
Sherlock coughed and blinked up to see John staring down at him.
John gaped at him. “It’s my decision, Sherlock. I want to go with you.”
Harry pointedly looked at Sherlock on the other side of the bed and opened her mouth to speak. Before she could form a word, John followed her gaze to the consulting detective and let out a shaky gasp, his eyes widening with shock. He looked back to Harry then back to Sherlock, then back to Harry.
“It is important. But being with you is more important. In a few days, it’ll be our third—.”
Preparing himself, John lifted himself out of the water by arching his back and pushing up with his palms. His ribs hurt like hell and he could only take in small breaths, but his face was out of the water. The water level was near his mouth, and would cover his ears if he tilted his head backwards.
The nurse looked at him with a slight flicker of suspicion before following with: “Is he a patient—.”
“I knew I was forgetting something.”
Silence engulfed the pair for a few minutes.
Sherlock nodded in response. “Should I order dinner?”
“Sherlock—.” John interrupted with a warning in his tone, but Sherlock continued.
John cringed at Sherlock’s sudden urgent tone, and bit his lip. He felt Sherlock touch his shoulders and could feel him peering at his face.
*            *            *
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, deep in thought. “Hamish?”
“We may have to go down there. But first, we need to see the footage.”
“It’d show that quickly?”
Greg left, and John stayed standing. He hung his head and inhaled deeply, suddenly tired all over again. Now all he needed to know was if there would be any brain damage or not. It didn’t seem likely—the benzos may have been manipulated, but they could have just paralyzed or blocked the brain cells from functioning rather than killing them off. Narcan should do the trick, and a lot of rest for a few days. But John also wanted Sherlock to wake up. He needed to see his eyes were clear and alive, and hear his voice, his laugh…
“That could be a likely motive. I need to find how she was ingesting the drug first, and which one it is.”
“You’re not dead though. You’re just sleeping. In a coma though, medically speaking. Sometimes I wish it were me. Maybe it wouldn’t be so difficult for you…”
A month later, John was painfully, obviously jealous. Captain John Watson, army doctor and blogger, was jealous of Irene Adler. What irked Sherlock was that the reason for John’s jealousy was unknown, and proved tricky in figuring out. For once, though, Sherlock pretended John wanted him in the way Irene asserted: on the table—or any table—right here and now and with him begging for mercy, twice. Whether it’d be
Sherlock smirked and leaned back, continuing. “The money makes you feel guilty. So answer me this, what kind of drugs are you selling that does horrible things that it’ll make a crack dealer feel guilty, hm?”
“You’ll need a shave soon. I’ll probably do it again; it seems the nurses are allowing it—a lot actually, for me. They even offered me a cot.” John laughed, though it was short and quickly became humorless. “I can’t bring Rosie though, there’s not enough room. And I have work, and…people are constantly coming and going, you know, they’re being very helpful with Rosie, but, god, Sherlock, they keep asking me if I’m alright, you know, how I’m dealing with all this. First Mary, then you…”
Sherlock glared at Mary and stepped closer, his anger betraying him. “All the evidence points to you.”
Trying not the panic, Sherlock looked around for anything he could throw against the window. There was nothing, and the smoke was already stinging his throat and his eyes. He coughed roughly, and leaned forward against the wall. He stood up, leaned his weight against the window, and reached up for the lock. His hand throbbed, and attempted to shift his body to use his other hand, but lost contact with the wall, and fell onto his side, hitting his head against the chair, succumbing to darkness.
Sherlock furrowed his brow. “You don’t want me here…”
“We’re not a couple…”
And then suddenly he was awake. The memory dissipated before he could fully remember it, and he sat up gasping. John pulled the covers off his sweaty body and clutched his right knee. He fumbled forward, searching blindly in the dark, but realization hit him like a wave of ice-cold water—it hit him hard—and he inhaled sharply and held it in for several seconds.
John shifted again and muttered incoherently. Sherlock repeated his name twice before John finally blinked at him. He focused on him for a moment, and then looked around.
“I was outside when you and your brother came out. It’s a pretty good spot for a smoke.”
“Lestrade should be hear any minute. He should have heard the shot—.”
Dammit, Sherlock, leave!
Sherlock’s grin widened into a smile, and John giggled for the first time in more than a year. “Why don’t you sleep while I do too, mhm? I doubt you’ve slept in weeks.”
“I’m here, John. I’m here.”
“What…?”
Sherlock’s eyes flickered on the roof, and it seemed he didn’t see what he thought he would, for his brows furrowed deeper. “Where’s his body?”
do this, sentiment will get in the way eventually.”
John laughed softly and stepped forward, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “You don’t have to. That won’t make it less true though.”
Sherlock smirked, and wheeled to the stairs. He froze. He hadn’t even thought about it, and realizing it now felt like a slap in the face.
Sherlock stared at her expressionless as he stepped back without another word and seated himself in an uncomfortable chair in the waiting room. For a moment he would have appeared defeated, but the moment passed as quickly as it happened, and the consulting detective straightened back to his usual façade.
“Oh well I’ll keep a look out,” Mike said cheerfully. “I’m off to lunch. See you around.”
They kissed for several heartbeats, and came to an abrupt stop just as the elevator dinged open. Sherlock rushed out, without even looking back to see John completely disheveled and thoroughly kissed.
“I just thought I’d see you here. I can take Rosie off your hands for you. You seeme like you need some sleep.”
“John made me leave, and well, that was almost five minutes ago.”
“John?”
John shrugged. “It’s just a little hard to breathe, that’s all.”
“Then why—.” Sherlock’s voice shook. He pressed his lips tightly together and cocked an eyebrow up slightly, but still looked helpless and confused.
Suddenly John seized.
John cupped the other side of his cheek and ran his thumbs along both sides.
“Yes, love?”
“John—.”
John disappeared from sight, and he made an appearance nearly every twenty minutes. He pretended to get a glass of water, and then a snack, but Sherlock knew he was checking on him, making sure he was all right, even though he was literally next-door.
His voice sounded pained. John relaxed and leaned down. He kissed Sherlock’s lips chastely, and then leaned away just a little so that he could still graze Sherlock’s nose with his. He took a step forward and turned his body, and then sat in Sherlock’s lap, draping his legs to the side. He wrapped his right arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and held him close to his chest. Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and rested the other in his lap, and intertwined their hands. John rested his cheek on top of Sherlock’s curls, and held him for several minutes in silence.
“Restarting compressions.” The doctor continued them as a nurse took over John’s breathing. Sherlock stayed in the corner, fidgeting, his eyes glazed over and focused on John’s limp body.
“Don’t lie to me.” John said sternly before Sherlock could open his mouth.
John sighed and ran his hand over his face. Willoughby looked at Sherlock and raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock held the spoon in front of John, who opened his mouth and took the bite. It was just a small amount, but John coughed as it entered his mouth, dribbling a little bit on his lips. Sherlock straightened up and started to reach forward, but John managed to shake his head. Sherlock remained still as John thought hard about swallowing. It took him a couple of seconds, and then he managed to swallow smoothly.
Inhaling deeply, John loosened his grip off the railing and slid his foot over the edge. Air began to rush around him when suddenly it came to an abrupt halt. A tight grasped held him in the air by his good shoulder, and subconsciously John gripped the side, suddenly desperate for a hold. Looking up, he saw Sherlock looking down upon him; eyes shockingly wide.
“What did John have to say?” He asked calmly, eyeing Sherlock’s cut with unusual worry.
“She was in on it too, sir.”
“You sure about this, John?” Sherlock asked as he prepared a tiny bite.
It must have been before that…before everything…
He inhaled shakily, ashamed that sudden tears were leaking out the corner of his eyes. He let out a choked gasp, and then lost control completely.
John bit his lip, lowered his gaze, and then raised it. “I’m too—I mean…” John paused. He was having trouble with remembering words, and sometimes his thoughts would trail off before he fully grasped them. He cleared his throat as he flickered his gaze to his arms, unsure exactly what he was going to mean. “It hurts…”
Sherlock tilted his head.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John furrowed his brows and looked at Victor.
“It’s not broken,” John mumbled.
Sherlock’s gaze shot up to his. John chuckled.
Sherlock shifted and turned towards him. His eyes were still closed and he was reaching out to John. John tried to focus on Sherlock’s sleeping movements, but then Sherlock trailed his hand down John’s abdomen to his hipbone, then to his right thigh. John squirmed underneath him as panic constricted his chest.
Sherlock nodded to her as he rushed in. The first room was empty, but Moran was in the interrogation room, his back to the window, and John in front of him, however he was blocked from view. A small camera was on a rod, facing John, and a red light flashing. There was another man against the wall, with a metal suitcase of several different needles and vials, and a mini heart monitor. The heart line was beeping rapidly, clearly not normal.
“I don’t need to talk to
Sherlock tried to sit back up but John kept him still. “You don’t have anything to be sorry for.”
“I’m perfectly capable, Sherlock. Besides, Alex said I should start practicing keeping my balance without an aid or a prosthetic.”
Anthea’s phone beeped, and she read it swiftly, reading it aloud as she did so. “Mary has managed to reboot part of the system. It’ll take another half hour or so to get the other systems back on, but she’ll continue working on sourcing the IP address to the correct monitor and user.”
“This wasn’t supposed to—.”
Moran cut in. “Only one of you gets to live, otherwise I’ll just kill you both…” He sighed. “Now wouldn’t that be romantic?”
“He’s burning up,” he said to the nurse who just walked in.
“If there’s a bomb down here, shouldn’t we call the police?”
Sherlock took the useless vest off and began re-buttoning his shirt. “We need to get off this ship. And if we kill Moran in order to do so, then we will. But…right now, you need medical attention—.”
John cleared his throat and furrowed his eyebrows.
John looked out the corner of his eye and then fidgeted away on the bed, scooting away from Sherlock. Sherlock stopped in his tracks, and then slowly turned around. He decided to remain quiet, but kept the door ajar.
Kim nodded. “He said his name, and was honest. So far he’s recalled the past twelve hours, the first seven a near perfect match to the recording from earlier. He said when he woke up later this evening, Bauer had been in the window, and quietly ushered him outside at gunpoint. He didn’t know who he was or what he wanted until Bauer drove away. He didn’t mention the manila folder.”
John quickly left, and came back with water, a cup of Sherlock’s tea, and two pills. He handed each other to Sherlock, who took the pills with water, and then took his tea.
“Keep going,” Sherlock said, his voice rough.
Sherlock woke up with a start, and realized the man in the bed was fidgeting. A doctor entered just as Sherlock realized something could be wrong.
“Do we have a picture of him, see if Lucy would recognize him?” John asked.
It was several minutes later when John was back in the kitchen, and Sherlock was in his dressing gown and applying a temporary brace over John’s wrist.
The man sounded pained, startling John, and distracting him from his own pain for a moment.
“The antibiotic, of course.”
Moran laughed. “It’s a great invention, can cause confusion and conflicted feelings. Something my boss was looking forward to using, sadly through, he never got the chance.”
Enjoy and please comment!         ~ Erin
“No, he’s…”
Silence fell for a minute. Bauer and Mycroft remained silent.
“I’m not wearing some stranger’s clothes.”
Enjoy this short epilogue :)
John was thrashing on the bed, saliva dripping from his chin. Sherlock kept him on his side and held his gently just as Margaret entered the room.
“You took to long.”
“Begin what? John’s not here.”
John remained quiet for a moment, glaring up at Sherlock. He took the moment to compose himself and then released his hold and went to the door, opening it to see Sarah.
“SHERLOCK!”
“They won’t kill you. I’ll be doing that, before the hour’s up. So you have,” Moran looked at his watch. “Half an hour.”
“Yes!”
“Everything all right, John?” he asked casually. John nodded silently. He sensed Victor was suspecting something, so he offered a small grin and forced himself to hold eye contact.
John recalled the case, and then with realization, gasped.
John comprehended this and sighed. “That’s not good is it…”
“Nope,” Sherlock replied. He stood up swiftly and headed into the sitting room, reaching for his coat. “I should be back by dinner. Don’t wait up.” He started to head to the door, when John stopped him.
Sherlock gave her an approving grin. “Perfect. The point of all this ladies and gentlemen is to be careful who you trust. Information is so easy to fix, once it’s planted in your head, it’ll be harder to contradict it. John was framed. Further investigation will just prove it. Lee Van der Ross is involved as well. He was the director of your mission, Moran, in Kandahar. This was an elaborate but messy attempt for revenge. O’Brian’s death was a tragic accident, but not at all at the hands of John Watson. You’ll probably be investigated, since it seems like O’Brian’s death was caused by friendly fire, but that’s a different jurisdiction and not of my interest, not to mention your position proves difficulty. If there’s any evidence against you, you have my word that MI6 won’t stop until they take you down. It’s just a matter of time.” Sherlock smirked and looked around, noticing a group of men through the glass door, heading to the conference room—clearly to arrest the new suspects—, Moran’s conflicted and confused look, Kim’s fail at hiding her triumph, and Mary—was gone.
“I won’t Sherlock. But you have to promise me you’ll try. You have to meet me half way—you need to—to make an effort all right? John whispered firmly. “You need to survive this, for me, because I—” John’s voice broke. “I—.”
John hovered around the flat, mentally checking of the list of things to do. They had had their tea and breakfast, he wasn’t working today—he had memorized his schedule for the month, and hadn’t been taking many shifts since—well,
Adrenaline kicked in suddenly, and the world spun around as John sat up onto his side. The world grew grey around him, but he couldn’t stop. He felt a need to find something, but he didn’t know what. He looked over the railing and saw a glimmer of Sherlock’s face in the water.
“He’s um, out of surgery, but not out of the woods just yet.” Sherlock whispered, keeping his eyes on her. He remained standing as Mary sat on the sofa.
Despite the circumstances, John’s blood boiled.
John nodded and raised his chin up very slightly. Sherlock took the hint and kissed him, leaning into the touch for several seconds before leaning back. John placed his hand on the base of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him back in, deepening the kiss by parting his mouth and allowing Sherlock in.
“You have to do this John!”
“And that means…”
“Oh…okay, good,” He breathed. “C-can I go now?”
*            *            *
John sighed and reached over with his eyes closed, picked up the phone from the bedside table, and then lazily tossed it by Sherlock’s resting head. Sherlock peaked at the screen with a blurry gaze. Barely a breath later, Sherlock was out of bed, the sheets discarded to the side as he already started pacing out of the room.
“To what?” John’s brows furrowed. “I—I love you too.”
“It’s-nothing…” John slurred. He ran a hand over his face, and ignored the trembling in his hand. He clenched his fist and tried to turn away from Vanessa, but his vision was blurring even more, and he thought he would pass out soon.
“Holmes?”
It took a John a moment to voice the beginning part, and when he voiced the ‘sss’ part, it was elongated.
“So…” John cleared his throat in attempt to hold back rising tide of a cry. “It’s been…about eight months since you…”
“I need you—want you to fuck me,” John gasped.
“What about Moran?” Mycroft asked simply, disregarding the obvious attempts his brother was making in trying to compose himself. But he knew better than to comment on them at a time like this.
“But what about you? What will you do when your withdrawal symptoms become too severe to ignore. And when John notices? He
John’s arms fell limp in the embrace; his whole body felt light in Sherlock’s hold. “John…?” Sherlock gently leaned out of the embrace just as the heart monitor beeped into sudden alarms. “John! John wake up!”
“Sherlock?”
“I’m sorry John I don’t know why—.” Sherlock murmured.
“Right, of course. Come in.”
Sherlock continued plucking at the strings, deep in thought, when an hour later, the familiar tap of an umbrella was heard against the stairs, and soon after, Mycroft appeared in the doorway.
“Seven refers to the number in the slang term,” Sherlock offered.
John walked past the door before he could eavesdrop further, ashamed at himself for feeling put out when Sherlock didn’t include his last name.
Sherlock shook his head dismissively. “No, I’m—.”
“Exactly.”
“You say that now, but over time you’ll resent me.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I took a couple, near the end. But usually, I was here. And I took one last week.”
Sherlock looked at Mike expectantly
“How the hell did that happen?” Mycroft demanded.
“All right, then… page anyone from neuro, and get me his scans.” Hunt said.
He limped out, practically dragging his blogger beside him. Realizing the slow pace, Sherlock paused and lifted John off his feet and into a cradle. With a stable hold, Sherlock hurried out the room, water splashing around his steps.
John noticeably relaxed and looked at the ground. His breathing had deepened. Sherlock remained still, unsure what John was going to do or say.
“I’ll have someone look into it.”
“There’s nothing in there that has to do with the number—.”
Sherlock finished without another flinch, and cleaned John’s face thoroughly and applied the lotion afterwards. He put the supplies away, and then started to shuffle his feet again, unsure what to do.
“It’s not important,” Sherlock said as he started pressing kisses down John’s neck. He lazily started trailing his lips down his jaw and heading towards his chest, when his phone rang again, and then John pushed him away slightly, grinning.
Sherlock bit his lip.
John kept his face calm and answered him. “He’s your husband.”
John started to feel light headed again, and swayed slightly as he took a step forward before stopping. This night had become very emotional without planning any of it, and dammit he would have preferred plans. But what was said was said, and he wouldn’t dream of taking it back.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, unsure how anything could be good news.
Sherlock’s grin faltered, and John bit back a laugh.
“Oh do shut up Mycroft!” Sherlock snapped as he brushed past Donovan. Looking over his shoulder, he called back, "Double check on Derek Shepherd." He demanded without any explanation and Mycroft nodded and then left; Lestrade finally caught up with them and followed after Sherlock.
John offered a small smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. He shifted his posture, and then cleared his throat.
as well,
Sherlock licked his dry lips. “Fine,” he rasped. He was still in pain, and looked over at the morphine drip.
He made his way down the hallway, avoiding the other patients and staff with ease, and reached his room. Fortunately, despite everything else, John didn’t have to share a room, and as he closed the door behind him, he exhaled slowly, urging himself to relax.
John came back to the flat around noon, only to find it empty. He checked every room and looked around, but there was no sign of Sherlock. He checked his phone, but didn’t even have a missed call or text.
Sherlock breathed out slowly. “No.”
“What does the list say?” John asked.
John retrieved their bags as Sherlock watched from the window. From what he could tell, the bedrooms were upstairs, and realized with an unsettling stomach flip that this house must have been chosen last minute.
“Alright, clear!”
“Are there security cameras?”
Sherlock and John turned around tensely to see Moran standing at the far end of the hallway. Two men stood on either side of him, both wearing ski masks.
She took him by the belt and started leading him back to his room. “You’ve been gone for a while. Don’t overwork yourself. And don’t go by yourself again. Between you and me,” she dropped to a whisper as she led him to his bed. “That’s a lawsuit waiting to happen.”
“Stop saying you’re fine. You. Are not. Fine. You got shot—.” John’s voice trembled, but he sucked in a deep breath and continued, his voice resembling his captain character.
Sherlock remained silent and didn’t move. John didn’t either. Several moments passed before a sniffle interrupted it, followed but a suck of air and then another sniffle.
“Don’t worry, I won’t scar you skin. It’ll still be like marble when you wake up. And you better do that, git, or otherwise…I’ll never forgive you…”
John let out a shaky breath and rubbed Sherlock’s hand soothingly. It actually felt nice, and Sherlock decided to pretend to be asleep for little while longer. He wanted to know why John was upset. Did he do something wrong? John never cries, at least in public, although they weren’t exactly
John sighed, and even though he was tired, he thought of a way to convince Sherlock, at least tonight, that he didn’t blame him, no matter what his dreams were about. Alex had done this to his leg already, but there might be a way for Sherlock to do it.
“You should keep it wrapped up for a bit. I don’t think it’s broken, but no any hard movements. And don’t get it wet.”
“She didn’t take it well.” He stated.
John recalled that morning, and then shook his head. Sherlock thought for a second, and then leaned forward and kissed John’s forehead, his face beaming. “This is why I married you.”
“Turn it off or answer it,” John mumbled. Sherlock shuffled closer and huffed something incoherently. The phone rang again.
Sherlock awoke groggily, and slowly opened his eyes. A sudden sob penetrated the silence, and he closed his eyes to focus on the sound. It was coming from the lavatory, and the person was trying to muffle the sounds.
“Sherlock, what the hell happened?” Harry screeched over the phone.
Before being able to take in his surroundings, he was greeted by a rough push to the jaw and stumbled back down the stairs, clumsily rolled down to the bottom, landing on his side. He groaned and glanced up to find a figure towering over him from the top of the stairs. In between them was John’s gun, lying on one of the steps.
“You did a background check on him.” Sherlock stated.
“If you continue at that I’ll never get me tea.” John murmured, but turned around anyway and met his lips with the detective’s. They kissed for several moments before the kettle whistled and they reluctantly broke apart, or rather John did, leaving Sherlock bemused and flushed. John giggled softly and continued making his tea.
“Where have you been?” she asked.
“Sh?”
“What?” A voice from behind them snapped. Sherlock ignored him.
“Stan?”
Sherlock pointed at a small box that was lying on its side, its contents spilling out. “The drugs, only a few but must be the ones he was going to give to his partner. It’s in a shoebox, so clearly not a shipping package.” Sherlock rounded onto Canterbury. “Who’s your partner? Is it Dashwood?
“Repeat these words back to me and remember them: truck, cabin, spoon.”
“We’ll get a cab—.”
“I could just be you. You’re fears and doubts talking to yourself. All I know is that I’m here for you.”
Sherlock looked put out for a split second, and then tossed the pillow and blanket onto the table and then sat down in his own sitting chair.
“Yes, yes, Sherlock, come on,” John said, speeding up his thrusts.
“She called your phone. I don’t know why, mine’s working perfectly fine. The tests results are done, and clean. There’s nothing in Ellis’ food or medication that Florence would have consumed to explain her symptoms.

a (recovered) drug addict. He turned on his heal and stared at John. “John…”
Before he could get lost into whatever thoughts that would invade his mind, John’s hand stirred once then stilled, and then again.
“Um, September 28th.”
John nodded stiffly. “I know that. He’s dead.”
Sherlock looked at John with such admiration and pity all at once, John cursed in his mind. The detective was showing too much emotion, even John’s memory couldn’t make that up.
“You have to be careful Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “John could be—.”
“Mycroft had some clothes brought here, so you don’t have to wear just the hospital gown. I can help you into some pajamas, but you can’t wear any pants yet—it’s just easier to—.”
John leaned in his chair and ran a hand over his face. Canterbury was only five and a half feet. Sherlock had said the murderer was well over six, and that he was taller than Ellis, because he struck down. Which meant…they got the wrong guy. Canterbury wasn’t the murderer.
