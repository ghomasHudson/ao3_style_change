“I’m not sure. I’m playing it by ear. I need to heal, and there’s no sense in leaving before an interesting case comes along. It’s far more interesting here at the moment.”
“I can stay a few more minutes,” John said.
Sherlock nodded, eager to dispel John’s worry. He blinked, looking away. John might misinterpret that. He met his eyes again.
“I don’t.”
John rubbed the back of his head. His left hand remained on Sherlock’s foot, but so stiffly, as if he were afraid to move it.
“Thank you,” he murmured.
“Sure, why not?”
“That’s in and out. Three weeks for this last stretch. Your little revelation almost made me fall off the wagon.”
“Was that alright?” Mycroft asked, suddenly terrified that he had pushed too much too soon.
“Dinner it is.”
“How about I tell you more about werewolves?” Greg asked, smiling with desperate cheer.
“So there’s an object there that’s part of the secret.”
“Why aren’t you with your people?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m afraid that I’m not accustomed to conversing about personal matters such as this, not even with Sherlock in most cases.”
Sherlock scoffed.
Greg stepped forward and rubbed his face against Mycroft’s hand. His fur was stiff and thick, yet soft. Mycroft slowly moved his fingers to stroke his muzzle. It was less threatening to go underneath a dog’s face and not above. Greg wasn’t a dog, but Mycroft had nothing else to go on. Greg leaned into his touch, so it was acceptable.
“I do want your relationship to continue.”
, Mycroft had texted.
Mycroft had suffered a frisson of melancholy and fear when John had admitted why he was so recalcitrant to speak about his clan. Such complete banishment was why Mycroft was hesitant to press the issue of his sexuality with his parents. While he may not enjoy as close a relationship with them as he used to, he still wanted them in his life, even if in a limited capacity. Sherlock didn’t understand that, but there was little wonder about that. He had always been the disappointment. Mycroft had lost count of how many times he had to defend Sherlock’s choices even while feeling as frustrated as they did.
“That’s an animal hide,” Mycroft said, pointing at the skin as John unfurled it.
“Greg? What is it? Is something wrong?”
Greg stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets, shoulders hunched.
Sherlock stared ahead as he spoke, unable to meet Greg’s eyes until he was done. When he did, it took a distressing amount of energy not to look away again, for Greg was gaping at him with such a surprised, touched expression that Sherlock almost bolted from the sofa to the opposite side of the room to get away from the cloying, honey feeling in his stomach.
“I do. Several. They’re great for costumes. Do let yourself in next time. Why should I or Mrs. Hudson have to open the door for you when you have your own key?”
“He’s getting a divorce. What’s the problem?”
It wasn’t fine. Sherlock couldn’t even fake being fine, not with the way his voice trembled and came out too breathless and high-pitched. But John looked ashamed of himself. He had never been anything but respectful. He shouldn’t feel shame. It had been an accident. A reflex. It hadn’t been on purpose. Not his John. Not with the guilt searing his eyes. Yet Sherlock still fled, turning away, towel clutched to his chest.
Sherlock inhaled sharply in excitement.
Maybe he’d be lucky and a crisis would require his attention before then. Greg sighed on the line. Mycroft braced himself. If Greg insisted, he wouldn’t be able to find it in himself to say no.
Was his divorce the reason why Greg had told Sherlock about their previous connection? No, that didn’t vibe with Sherlock’s amused comment about the conversation being “fun”. If Greg was considering trying to get back together with Mycroft in a romantic or sexual sense, he wasn’t likely to have told Sherlock before Mycroft himself, would he? To commiserate with a friend, perhaps? But he had other friends. Greg had known that Sherlock would react exactly as he had. Hurt and petulant, even though he had backed off a bit at the end. But there would be further repercussions. Sherlock’s grievances hadn’t been unwarranted. Mycroft would have to issue a better apology later. In person, if Sherlock would suffer his presence.
A smile of delighted surprise jerked onto John’s face.
“But you didn’t. This isn’t the sort of stuff people shop for on their phones. It’s gift shop memorabilia. You also have a picture taken from a bridge in Prague as the lock screen of your mobile. And you have a US plug adapter and voltage converter in your laptop bag, which you left open in the sitting room. That was your last trip. To Universal Studios. This figurine is brand new. No dust on it. And you have a tan. You were recently somewhere with plenty of sunshine, sometimes wearing a t-shirt and shorts, and sometimes a bathing suit. Florida fits the bill. You likely went to Disney World, too. Not Sea World, though. I can’t imagine that would be a pleasant experience for you.
“Yes. Why would you want to stay in a beach town unless you wanted to go to the beach? And you sound like you’re in a good mood.”
“You’re down to one crutch,” John said. “That’s good. As long as you’re not overworking your ankle.”
Mycroft wondered if Sherlock knew that John was criticizing his living habits like this with him. The poor man felt awful about talking behind his back and cut himself off before going much further, but how could anyone fault him for being upset by Sherlock’s utter lack of hygiene? Mycroft certainly wouldn’t consume anything made in that kitchen. When he was there, he only ever had tea prepared by Mrs. Hudson in her own kitchen. Mycroft hoped that John would change his mind about letting Sherlock risk his health like this, and insist that he adopt a proper system for keeping his specimens. Lord knew that he’d never listen to Mycroft, but he might to his partner. Sherlock had always had a better track record of heeding his friends over his family. Although, in the case of their parents, that wasn’t a bad thing to do.
“You’re quite observant when you put your mind to it.”
“I know. I recognized you, too. So you were so enraptured by my playing that you felt compelled to save me? The piece wasn’t even that good.”
“This isn’t my first sprained ankle,” Sherlock grumbled, refusing to hand over his keycard to swipe at the room door. “I can handle myself.”
“It’s all true!” Sherlock shouted from the kitchen.
“John, I’m not about to police your thoughts. I can’t give you everything you want. Imagine away. As long as I don’t hear about it, I don’t care.”
Sherlock couldn’t get himself to sleep until 3am, having to satisfy himself with tapping on the bed with his hands instead of pacing around the room as he watched Blue Planet on his laptop. He’d seen it before, but as an inspiring distraction, so he hadn’t catalogued most of the details in his mind palace. Now the dramatic images developed a new significance. This was John’s native world. Like John had pointed out, the documentarians could only catch the merest glimpse of it, but this was the closest that Sherlock would ever get to visualizing the wondrous seascapes and animals that John had described to him in such fond detail. That is, except for the selkies and merpeople. Magical jellyfish also existed, for some reason, although they at least looked the part, but none of them appeared in any of the documentaries John had seen, including this one, nor were the seals featured selkies. They stayed well away from any nosy humans with cameras. Likewise, selkies and seals stayed away from each other.
“Yeah, that’s good. Good.”
“How did that happen exactly?”
Sherlock had some phone calls to make.
They hugged. John had tried to be formal in his goodbye last time by awkwardly offering a hand to shake, but Mrs. Hudson had brushed it off and pulled him into a hug.
He hung up and pulled up the newspaper articles of his last case. Lestrade’s name had been mentioned in them.
“Oh, shut up.”
“Yeah, what is going on?” Greg asked, stepping up beside them, eyes flinty with anger and disappointment. “Tell me that you weren’t going to get in that cab with him.”
“Right.” John rubbed his eyes. “I’m sorry. I really am. I didn’t think. It’s been a long time. I just… I wanted… I don’t know.”
“Yes, it is.”
Heat colored Sherlock’s cheeks at John’s praise. He smiled.
They settled, Sherlock’s left cheek to John’s right, breathing in unison. Sherlock’s heart still thundered in his chest, overwhelmed and amazed at what was happening.
Sherlock sank forward, a relieved breath bursting out of him.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes, but didn’t object.
The mobile finally rang. Sherlock jumped, startled despite his desperate anticipation. Unknown caller. Local number. Sherlock picked up the phone, staring blearily at the screen, thumb hovering over the green Accept key as Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata played on.
No. It couldn’t be. If Sherlock had full use of his feet, he would be rushing across the room and pulling John into the kitchen to confirm that the insane thing that he seemed to be proposing wasn’t actually what he was proposing, not when he’d just escaped it by the skin of his teeth. But John was sitting beside Sherlock, his back to Mycroft, who had released his hold on the doorknob and was regarding them with an intense curiosity that Sherlock had been so looking forward to having go away.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. If Greg really was okay with it… And Sherlock did want to see his wolf form.
“Greg told me they made an arrest a few minutes ago. A cab driver.”
“A man with no record who just happens to find you at the beach at an opportune moment and has become friendly with you is my business.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, trepidation clutching his gut.
“You haven’t had friends since Victor moved away. That was years ago. You haven’t seemed interested.”
“It’s okay,” Greg said. His jumpiness seemed to be going down. He finally tugged off his coat and hung it on the coat rack, limbs only slightly hesitant and shaky. “I am glad that you’re not freaking out,” he continued. “I hadn’t planned on ever telling you. I counted on your skepticism of anything remotely supernatural keeping you from suspecting it.”
“Now that I think about it,” Sherlock continued, “it’s quite handy being in a relationship with a doctor. Medical advice only a text message away. House calls whenever I want them.”
There was a nervous tremor in his voice. He had gone a little pale, too. What could Greg possibly have to be nervous about? The only thing that John had told him that required any secrecy was about his family and being a selkie, but how could either of these things have any bearing on their reaction to each other?
“I’ll tell you what I can. It’s the least I can do.”
They began making their way to the kitchen.
“That sounds nice. Maybe. I have missed spending the day with someone I care about. But it’s not… I’m probably still going to be sad. Just a bit. I love being here with you. I really do. I’m sorry if I’ve given the impression that I don’t with the way my mood’s been.”
John smiled tightly. Sherlock lowered his gaze. Now that they’d cleared the air, it might be the right time to make the request that he had been mulling over the whole day. That is, if it was appropriate to make it all, which he had no idea about, so might as well give it a go.
“Did it sound right to you? I mean, for the theme. I tried to give the strongest impression I could of what I feel when I listen to your stories and how I view the ocean now through your eyes, but I have no idea if I managed it.”
Dinner was unusually subdued. Not that they had a lack of conversation, for John wished to know what each portion of the song represented and exactly what had inspired Sherlock in its composition. Yet John’s embarrassment at his earlier outburst made him a tad more awkward and less open than usual, which was matched by Sherlock’s own flustered preoccupation. He decided to keep his worries to himself, only to recapitulate the next instant and yearn to ask John what was on his mind to settle this once and for all. But even if he spoke now, there might be no settling anything. John’s feelings, even Sherlock’s own, might change in the future. But they would have cleared the air for now. When had Sherlock ever been content to live in doubt?
“Are you okay?” John asked, sounding more worried now.
“Mm. There’s a picture. Sherlock might even be gracious enough to let me put it up on the wall. “
“Oh. Okay.”
Seven years wasn’t enough to wipe that shame clean.
Mycroft smiled, pleasantly surprised.
“Only if it’s alright with you.”
“Yes.” Greg looked sadly at him. “I need to get Susan out of my head first. I don’t want her in there when I’m with you. If I’m with you. I don’t… I shouldn’t promise you anything. I want to. I really do, but—”
“I’m sorry,” John said. He started coming up the stairs. “I should have been more specific.”
“That’s none of your business,” he said. His sharp terseness vanished a moment later, eyes softening again. “Well, I’m glad to see that you’re calmer now.” He offered his right hand. “If you’ll please let me help you to the chair?”
“No. Only words and looks.”
“You don’t have to tell me what they are,” John added quickly. “Unless it’s a problem, that is. Is it something that’s a problem?”
“What about my head? Can you treat that yourself?”
Greg startled as Mycroft spoke.
John’s frown intensified in confusion, growing even more adorable, then a grin grew on his face.
“I would hope so. Will he be needing the upstairs bedroom when he comes? You’ll need to clear out your mess if you do.”
“You didn’t know what to look for,” Mrs. Hudson said, laying her hand on Sherlock’s other arm. “You used to be so convinced that all this was impossible. You’re always going on about needing to eliminate the impossible first when making deductions, so how were you supposed to get at it when you had already discounted it to begin with?”
“You think he would have gotten into that cab if John weren’t around,” she said.
“I can sympathize.”
Sherlock spat out the word as if it tasted acrid.
Sherlock never seemed terribly pleased to see him at first, but he stopped complaining after a minute. Sometimes, he even drew Mycroft into a deduction game, which Mycroft always resisted, as it made Sherlock so cross when he lost. When Mycroft asked his question, a non sequitur after commenting on the appalling mess that was Sherlock’s tiny kitchen, Sherlock turned to him with a startled frown and piercing eyes that made Mycroft shudder inside, regretting speaking at all.
“Hello, Mrs. Hudson,” he said. “My injuries are better. I’m eating and drinking enough water. No, I still don’t know when I’m getting back. How are you on this fine day?”
“I get it. I would have been suspicious, too. So did Sherlock convince you to let him go?”
“That’s a rather creative way of saying you kidnapped him,” Mrs. Hudson said, shooting him a scolding look. “And after he helped your brother, too.”
“Susan is cheating on me,” Greg said.
“They mentioned that you kidnapped him, too. You really have to stop doing that.”
John put a couple of heated plates down on his desk.
Finally, John returned to Sherlock, who hugged him tightly, nuzzling his face, never mind that everyone else was standing right there.
Sherlock kissed above his belly button and grabbed one of John’s hands to kiss it, too, sinking his face into his palm. John smiled past his sorrow. No, the siblings that hadn’t spoken for years weren’t the best example. The most that Sherlock had ever gone without communicating with Mycroft was five months, and despite it being his choice, he had still felt unsettled about it. Mycroft was like a rash that wouldn’t go away. Irritating, yet dependable.
“Do you think it likely that you’ll start hallucinating any moment now?”
“It’s still nice to hear you say it.”
John took a moment to absorb this information.
“I know you love looming over people like a vampire,” Sherlock said when he was halfway up, “but would you quit staring at me?”
“Well, no. Why? What’s wrong with your flat?”
Greg looked away again and rubbed his nape with an embarrassed air.
“No.”
“You mean patients in need of medical attention?”
“Mm. Me, too. Not having you physically present has been agonizing. I propose that we not leave this room until tomorrow.”
“But you want me to.”
“No. I’m just getting my car.” He frowned over his shoulder. “Although, we should call the police about him.”
“I had just been hit on the head. You would have thought the same.”
“No, I want to now. I do.” John pressed his lips together in a strained grimace as he sucked in a deep breath, gaining strength from it. “I didn’t really lose touch with them. My people, we have a clan structure. It’s not terribly rigid. You can switch clans pretty easily if you want and it’s rare to be banished from one, but it still happens. It happened to me. If I had decided to live on land for only a year or two, they would have let me be. But med school? Wanting a career as a doctor? A human doctor?”
Sherlock sighed.
“Oh, I do intend to do plenty of this,” he said. “For as long as you let me.”
Sherlock buried his face in his knees, groaning deep in his throat.
“Good luck,” John said. “Though I’m sure you won’t need it.”
“As you wish, doctor.”
Greg hesitated again. Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“You’re upset now.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone again.
“We do appreciate that you didn’t get in the cab,” Mrs. Hudson said, leaning forward, so understanding. Always so understanding. Sherlock needed to get her a grand present for her birthday. Make up at least a little for the annoyance he put her through. Maybe she’d like a composition of her own. “It was very responsible of you.”
John stood up, masking his fear before opening the door. Not well enough for Mycroft not to notice his distress, but best spare him that detail. Mycroft entered the room almost instantly, closing the door behind him. John stood beside Sherlock, leaving the empty chair for Mycroft, if he wanted it, but Mycroft didn’t sit.
John smiled softly.
, Sherlock texted and put down the phone.
“I’ll be going, then,” Greg said. “Mycroft is probably pacing a hole in his floorboards by now. It was really nice meeting you, John. It was a pleasant surprise.”
John’s smile widened in amusement.
Mycroft paused, letting the sudden jolt of Greg’s heated words pass. Greg dropped his head into his hands, sighing.
“It’s not the same.”
John frowned, crestfallen by the sudden news, which was exactly what Sherlock didn’t want. He turned around to face Sherlock, but kept his right hand twinned in his.
Mycroft shrugged.
“How he finds anything is beyond me.”
Mrs. Hudson’s face softened. If she were physically here, she’d be touching Sherlock’s shoulders right now to physically reassure him. She didn’t try to deny that most people just saw him as a tool to be used or a pesky annoyance, for how could anyone deny that? Those who actually liked him and weren’t just grateful to him because they owed him a favor were very few. He could count them all in one hand. Once, long ago, he had feared that Mrs. Hudson might be amongst the latter, but she had stuck by him, calling him regularly, calls that Sherlock would answer despite preferring to text, inviting him over for tea and dinner, putting up with his infodumping and rants of whatever was annoying him that day, and offering him a place to live when she bought the building at 221 Baker Street. A much nicer place than the tiny, cramped one bedroom that Sherlock had been stuck in before in a much less central part of the city. And, to ensure that he could manage it, she insisted on giving him a discount on his rent so deep that Sherlock was sure that he wasn’t paying her even half of what the space was worth.
Sherlock sat up in excitement.
“Why shouldn’t I stay in contact with him? He’s been treating my wounds. Aren’t you always on my case about not getting proper medical attention? You should be happy.”
Sherlock blinked. When had Greg come to stand over him?
“Are you going to be doing this every night?” John asked.
“For example,” Sherlock said. “Those are the papers that most need my attention at the moment.”
“Um, yeah. It’s been a crappy month.”
“Oh, please. Sarcasm just makes it worse. There’s no need for you to tell him anything at all.”
“Oh, I would. Also, since I am going to be living here now, there’s a little something we need to change.”
“You can’t control me with my skin,” he said in a stern warning. “If you took it, you would regret it, so don’t even consider it. And no, you don’t owe me a life debt or anything like that. I saved you because I wanted to, that’s all.”
“That one was obvious, not some display of your amazing powers of observation.”
John chuckled softly. Sherlock’s frown intensified, but he couldn’t bring himself to be truly peeved at John, who came over to him and took his right hand, dropping a kiss on his knuckles.
“That wasn’t my intention. I just… Never mind. Do you want to go? See the outside world for a bit?”
“Why not?”
“Me, too.”
Mycroft narrowed his eyes at him. It was hardly the first time that Greg graced him with a smart remark. He made rather a habit of it, which only increased once he caught wind that Mycroft secretly enjoyed them. Not that Mycroft had ever intended to pursue a close association with the good detective. He had him returned to his flat, planning nothing more than to check on him from a distance. Perhaps to communicate with him on occasion over Sherlock’s wellbeing.
“You know what, I’m tired of waiting around. The divorce is done. Susan is out of my life. I do need to take things slow. I’m not ready to jump into bed yet full stop, but since we kissed I haven’t wavered about wanting more of that. Not for a moment. If you’ll have me.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” John asked, uncertain.
“I can hold John indefinitely until either he or you caves.”
“It’s good to see you, too,” John said, smiling back and shaking her hand. “I’ve been looking forward to speaking with you some more. Sherlock promised not to cut us off this time.”
“Tell me that, then.” John raised his right hand to Sherlock’s cheek. “I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
“Are you sure? Won’t you miss the ocean?”
Sherlock raised a skeptical brow.
“I’m not. I’ve been here all day except for grabbing some chips around the corner.”
“I’m glad you told me,” John said. He smiled in reassurance, a tense, wan thing. “And I’m very glad that you’re better now. And that you have a brother that’s there for you. I know that you two rub each other the wrong way and that he oversteps a lot. I probably shouldn’t be commenting on it.”
Inhaling deeply, Sherlock turned toward John and examined every detail of that face that had brought him so much surprising joy these last weeks. Just looking at him brought him comfort even now that his captivating eyes were shadowed with regret over Sherlock’s imminent departure. Three weeks they had shared together. Was it really too soon for this depth of feeling, like Mycroft had said? It did seem such a small number now. But Sherlock had never needed much time to determine when he’d met someone worthy of his attention. And John commanded far more than his attention.
“I had little warning save for Sherlock implying that John and the seal that saved him were the same being mere moments before John transformed in front of me. I was hardly prepared for it. Although, to be fair, I wouldn’t have believed it otherwise. But it wasn’t under duress, in case there’s any doubt in your mind. I had agreed to let the matter go. He chose to show me. He had every right not to after the way I had treated him until that point.”
“What are you laughing at?” Mycroft said. “Like you accepted the existence of fairies with calm composure.”
But not the segment of great white sharks hunting seals. John flinched when they were mentioned, his shoulders hunching and distressed gaze falling to the ground as he scrambled for the remote at his side, handing it to Sherlock.
“I knew you weren’t going to be a typical tenant when I asked you to move here,” Mrs. Hudson said. “You weren’t any different in Florida. I can’t say I like you snapping or having human body parts in the flat. I really wish you wouldn’t have those. The smell… But you’re not a burden, Sherlock. You’re a lovely, kind person. You’re just different. That’s not a bad thing. Don’t think for a moment that I don’t want you here.”
“He did. As I said, he’s very attached to you.”
Sherlock snickered, earning himself a sour glare.
“There’s no guarantee of anything, but that man loves you, so please stop fretting.”
“Yeah, you two have a lot in common.”
“I only find him a fraction less irritating. And I’ll believe it when I see it about him backing off. I wouldn’t put it past him to lie to me about it.”
“Yes, I did. I checked.”
Although… Did asking how someone’s trip went count as small talk if they were more than a passing acquaintance? If the person asking genuinely cared about the answer, that must fall outside the parameters of small talk, since that was empty filler. Then again, friends often engaged in small talk, so was Les—Greg’s question still small talk? Either way, the intention was still the most important thing, and Sherlock hadn’t asked about him. But he never did. Greg wouldn’t find anything amiss in it. And so much of it was obvious just from looking at him. He and his spouse were still separated and he wasn’t having a good time of it.
“Just thought it’d be nice.”
That wasn’t clear enough. There lied the possibility that Greg might interpret it as some sort of euphemism, but he felt strangely vulnerable revealing the particular way that he experienced human emotion over text with a man who he’d only spoken to in person once. He would rather wait.
“Really? You were very upset about this yesterday, yet now you don’t care?”
“Our senses lie to us all the time. Mine were compromised, hence the hallucination. It’s the only possible explanation.”
He placed his own hand over Sherlock’s heart, which was beating far too rapidly right now with all the mixed emotions careening through his system. John’s own heart was beating a little strongly, now that he thought of it. Beating in excitement. Excitement over being with Sherlock.
Sherlock sat up straighter, looking Mycroft firmly in the eye.
Relief lightened John’s face, but only until they reached Sherlock’s train. They looked at the time on the digital display above the platform. Seven minutes left.
“It’s tempting, believe me.”
“Yet I do exist, despite your pig-headed insistence that I’m some hallucination. Your brilliant deductive skills were hardly in top form yesterday, were they? You ignored your observations in favor of the less likely conclusion.”
He walked up to Mrs. Hudson and pressed his cheek to hers, then moved onto Mycroft.
“Among other things, yes. I’m sorry. I don’t see any other way out of this.”
Greg paused another second, glancing at Sherlock’s face.
“Sherlock?” he asked once everyone except Greg and Mrs. Hudson had gone, voice soft. “What’s going on?”
“No, I’m already home. What’s up? You sound worried.”
“Oh, you most definitely kidnapped me. It’s just that reprimanding you would kind of go against the purpose of this call, so I’m being nice. But seriously, cut that out. It’s not okay.”
Well, wasn’t John’s sputtering the sweetest thing? Sherlock’s apprehension melted away at John’s charming desire to keep Sherlock close.
“Hi,” he said, patting Mycroft’s arm. “Sorry again for the short notice. I was close by and… Well, I wanted to see you. Sorry for interrupting your exercise routine.”
The bow tilted gracefully in his hand as he stroked it along his violin strings, tender and quick at the required intervals, beguiling solemn music from its depths. The landscape had put him in a melancholy mood, the cold wind cutting past his coat down his collar, icing his neck and hands, but he paid it little heed as he played on. The cliffs of Dover plummeted at his feet, inches from his toes, blinding white in the gloom of a sky as bright as slate, clouds dimming the sun’s rays to a murky hue. Grass slapped his ankles, shivering in the breeze, a counterpoint to Sherlock’s languid tune.
Mycroft’s heart seized at the insecure sadness in Greg’s voice.
“Ready?” Sherlock asked.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock asked him, sparing him none of his usual acerbity.
“Only because you keep hovering over me. I’m not a child anymore. I don’t need you watching over every step I take.”
Yet he still reached for his violin case and put it on the table, taking out the bow and tightening the horse hair. Hang on. This was a good chance to broach the subject of supernatural creatures.
John let go of Sherlock’s hand to drop his head into his own, He gasped, breath ragged, unable to hold his tears back anymore. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and hugged him to him as far as the armrests would let him. John pressed his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, breath hitching in intermittent sobs until he was spent and had no more tears left to give. His shallow breath gusted on Sherlock’s collarbone. Sherlock rubbed his head, massaging his scalp and pressing his lips to his hair, giving him as much comfort as he could. He didn’t speak, not knowing what the hell to say, but John didn’t mind.
“Have a good evening, John. And… Thank you.”
“It’s alright, Mycroft,” Mrs. Hudson said. “You don’t have to be coy around me. I’ve been around the block quite a few more times than you, I’d wager.”
“It’s alright. No explanation necessary.”
“Will you let me know how it goes with Lestrade?” Mycroft asked, turning back to him. Did he expect Sherlock not to?
Shifting down a bit on the bed, Sherlock tucked his head on John’s upper chest, letting his eyes drift shut as he inhaled a welcome gust of John’s unique scent. If they lied here for long enough, soon his bed would smell of John. What a marvelous thought. John cradled his head, rubbing soft circles onto his scalp. Silence drifted atop them once again. Sherlock’s heart still beat too wildly, but with the gentle rhythm of John’s breath pressing against his cheek, and the soothing touch of his hands, he soon calmed, allowing himself to enjoy the moment without freaking out about it.
“Are you okay?” he asked. “Your heart’s beating a little fast there.”
“Is that too much?”
John came down the stairs, clad in a dressing gown, his skin bundled in his arms, bare feet padding softly on the steps. Mycroft’s eyes widened, taking in every detail of the scene, already putting the pieces together even if he was too skeptical to believe them. He turned to Sherlock, but Sherlock looked straight ahead, all his reassurance for John, who was nervous again, hands gripping his skin a little too tightly. He met Sherlock’s eyes and smiled briefly, letting him know that he was okay. Sherlock relaxed a fraction.
“I’m just being stupid. Ignore me.”
“I enjoyed our outing. Greg referred to it as a date and I didn’t mind the appellation. He is a remarkably easy person to be with, more observant than most. I attribute this to basic skills necessary for detective work, but he had a hidden card up his sleeve, after all. He pointed out to me that his powers of observation are much more acute than my own in certain areas.”
Sherlock grinned.
He escaped to Barts to continue his experiments, unable to concentrate in his own kitchen. Greg saved him for a couple of days with a robbery and homicide on Wednesday. Only a six, but it scratched the itch. The man himself also provided a much more fascinating study than he ever had before, although there was no new information to be gained. His divorce was proceeding with all the sluggishness that these legal matters took, and he was in no less of a depressed slump over it. He hadn’t spoken to Mycroft, but Sherlock lacked the experience to tell if that was bad or simply part of the process. Mrs. Hudson told him that it was the latter.
“Hey. I’m glad you finally came around. I had to flee upstairs because Sherlock wouldn’t let me sleep with all his hyperfocus.”
A harsh exhale huffed from Sherlock’s nose. He shoved his hands in his pockets, trapping his fingers so they wouldn’t flail around everywhere as he paced around the room.
Sherlock shrank back, gasping, heart hammering in his throat. The skin was rippling, grafting onto John’s body, his limbs shrinking and transforming into flippers and a tail, a seal head appearing where the human one had just been. A seal slid onto the floor. John was gone, a seal in his place. A seal that looked identical to the one that had saved Sherlock’s life. A seal that was peering at Sherlock as if daring him to deny the truth now.
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock said. “Is this about Victor? I didn’t feel that for him.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed further as he scanned Mycroft’s person, not that there were any relevant clues for him to find. “No, this is about you.” Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Are you… Are you in love with someone?”
Sherlock sucked in a breath, shocked. He rarely heard Mycroft use that tone. Quiet, firm, and devastating. He was bloody furious. Of course he’d figured out what Sherlock almost said. This wasn’t just an idle connection between him and Greg. He cared about him. Truly. Could he love Greg? But Mycroft didn’t feel love like that. He wasn’t interested.
“Since you’re injured,” Gregson said with that obnoxious hangdog expression he’d had since he found Sherlock hurt at John’s house. “I can probably convince the department to pay for an extra night.”
Mycroft’s smirk withered into a scowl.
Mycroft pressed his lips in a tight line. Gradually, he loosened his hold on his umbrella until he wasn’t clutching it for dear life.
“You keep eyes in the microwave?”
Mycroft’s shock couldn’t have been greater if a UFO had appeared at his front door.
It hadn’t been Mycroft’s original intention to deceive Sherlock for so long. Only for as long as it took Sherlock to trust Greg and continue working with him. Working on the police cases stabilized him more than anything ever had after Victor’s unfortunate departure. Although their relationship had been fracturing before then. Mycroft had been bracing himself for a definite end for some time before Victor decided to make the decisive break to leave the country.
“It was so nice to meet you, too,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I’m so glad that Sherlock has someone like you in his life now.”
“So are you,” Sherlock yelled.
Once he was back in London, Sherlock would do his best to delete this whole incident and be free from this madness.
Everything inside Sherlock froze, his mind going blank.
“John, I—”
“Please do come in,” Mycroft said, breathless, rushing forward even as he encouraged Greg to enter the room like the welcome guest he was and not an intruder who needed to hide.
Ordinarily, Sherlock preferred to get acquainted with his sleeping quarters before doing anything else, but as soon as they arrived at the house, he sat at the desk and prepared his bow and violin for playing. Once he was ready, he instructed John to position the chair in the center of the room to give himself space and sat down, placing his violin on his shoulder. He began with a Mozart piece, fingers gliding easily over the familiar notes. He usually kept his eyes closed to absorb the sounds with the least distraction, but now he opened them every so often to glance at John, who sat on the sofa in front of him, leaning forward, elbows on his thighs, gazing at him with utter fascination, a small, pleased smile on his lips. Sherlock had to stamp down his own smile else he become too obvious. He rarely had an audience other than Mrs. Hudson. Once, Lestrade had shown up in the middle of Sherlock composing, and Sherlock had delayed the thrill of a new case for a minute as he ironed out a few more notes before they fled this mind and left him groaning in frustration. He had surfaced to find Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson regarding him with admiration, Mrs. Hudson’s gaze filled with the usual pride. Sherlock wasn’t immune to such praise. Much the opposite, not that he would admit it in words, although it was obvious enough in the pleased smiles and light blushes he never managed to hide in time.
Yes, it was. At least John sounded suitably chastised about foisting this horrible truth on him, not that Sherlock would be letting him off the hook so easily.
Sherlock sputtered.
A smile glimmered on Mycroft’s lips.
“Of course they are.”
He still didn’t dare broach the subject. She didn’t mention the mysterious “dog” hairs again, which was just as well. John could deal with it when he was here. Provide material proof. Maybe it would be better if Greg did it first. Mrs. Hudson had known him longer, so she had more trust in him. But would he do it? Sherlock needed to stop thinking about this. It was driving him mad. Even Mrs. Hudson noticed, which made everything worse.
“Yes, we do,” Sherlock said, grabbing John’s hand and tugging him out of the sitting room. “Bye now.”
“I’ve had sex and cuddled some people, but it’s been a while. But this. Face nuzzling. I’ve never done it with a human before. It’s like getting part of myself back.”
“Your fear was entirely justified,” Mycroft said. “John was afraid of the same. But I would never do anything to hurt you.”
“I didn’t expect to hear from you on John’s first weekend here.”
Mycroft smirked.
“Please hold on a moment, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said, halting John mid-step. He turned to Sherlock. “You can assure me that Dr. Watson is trustworthy?”
“Hm. Am I special, then?”
“So you think you were hallucinating? Possible, but completely incorrect in this case. Your head injury isn’t even severe enough to make that the likely case.”
? A fuck up. That’s what he was. Never mind his intellect or his knowledge or his bloody research into 243 types of tobacco powder. He would always fuck up. Always disappoint people. Always.
“Hello, John,” Mycroft answered the phone, putting down his fork.
“Of course,” John said, tone saddened but also slightly self-recriminating. He hadn’t thought of this himself. At least Sherlock wasn’t the only one to miss the obvious. “She misses you. She’s all alone over there right now.”
“Likewise. I’ve been climbing on the walls.”
“Only for you to return with yet another copy. You have an entire drawer full at your house, don’t you?”
Damned if he did. Damned if he didn’t. Sherlock opened the fridge door and stepped back so that John could see the bag of thumbs in the vegetable tray.
“Don’t feel any rush to come back in a hurry. Take all the time you need to get acquainted with John. Oh, this is so exciting. I had hoped that he’d become a good friend when you said that you were staying with him, but I never thought this might happen.”
“John is coming back,” he gasped, clutching the phone to his chest. “He’s coming back.”
“I haven’t. But I’m afraid that I don’t have enough ingredients for you to prepare something worth your time.”
“I’m not going to run this time,” he said.
“Oh, no. Far from it. He’s not like me at all. He’s average. Well, a bit above average or he wouldn’t be interesting to me, but not unlike you. He also misses incredibly obvious details. Honestly, I have no idea how the rest of you get on.”
“It didn’t mean… anything. Shit, that sounds like a lie.”
“My intellect is superior to most people’s. That’s a fact.”
Mycroft released a low breath at the sound of his voice. Such a soothing balm to his perturbed nerves.
“I’m looking forward to that. Can you spoon me this time? I wanted to last night but we didn’t get around to it.”
Sherlock regretted saying that as soon as he heard Mycroft’s distressed sigh on the line. He didn’t actually want to hurt Mycroft. But it was true, damn it al.
Sherlock huffed out a sigh and tapped restlessly on the table.
“Yes.”
“No. But sometimes I want to burst and scream for them to get over themselves. It's all on the tip of my tongue, but I keep my mouth shut. I don’t…” Sherlock groaned. Would Mycroft stop being right for two seconds? It was so tiresome. “I may hardly talk to them, but I don’t want to be completely cut off from them, either.”
“No, we cannot. I appreciate that you didn’t try to change me and convince me to have children.”
Sherlock’s eyes slid shut. Contentment washed over him, led by John’s warmth pressed along his body. This was even more enjoyable than he could possibly have imagined. He felt safe and peaceful in a way that he couldn’t describe, yet also overwhelmed by a heady sensation, almost as if he were high. But this was much better than any effect a narcotic could achieve. He was happy. Yes, that’s what this feeling was. Happiness. Solving a difficult case made him happy. Mrs. Hudson effusively complimenting his violin playing made him happy. Yet this was happiness of a different sort, a kind that he had never experienced before, and didn’t know how to quantify or analyze.
“Sherlock?” John asked. “What’s this about?”
“Who was this friend?”
Greg dropped his head on the table, his groan reverberating across the surface. Mycroft moved in closer, spreading his arm across Greg’s shoulders, then stopped himself. How much closeness was too much? They didn’t touch apart from hugs and hands on arms these days. Even this much might be overstepping. He began retracting his arm.
“My hands. My wrists. Most places, really.”
John dropped his head into his hands, groaning. Sherlock pressed his lips together and closed the fridge door. Stupid of him not to believe that this would be a problem. Now John wouldn’t be comfortable being here.
“We’re friendly,” John had said. “I trust him, obviously, at least with my safety. But I don’t know what I’d call him.”
“It goes without saying that I’m infuriated on your behalf,” he said.
John’s sigh hissed like a gasp as he finally looked up at Sherlock. He nodded, murmuring, “Yeah.” Sherlock rested his crutch against the counter behind him and pulled John close. John wrapped himself around him with a halting breath, tentative at first, but as soon as Sherlock began to rub his back, he clutched Sherlock like a lifeline in a drowning ocean, burying his face in his shoulder. His breath hitched, gasping, and moisture soaked through Sherlock’s shirt to his skin. Sherlock frowned at the unpleasant sensation of wet, but he didn’t mind like he thought he would. He didn’t want to let go, to let John face this sorrow alone. One hand strayed up John’s hair, stroking his scalp in those soothing, circular motions that he’d relished before when all had been calm and happy at the beach. A beach that John had only been able to enjoy alone for twelve years before he had let Sherlock in on his secret in an act of agonizing desperation.
Mycroft didn’t speak, but he nodded curtly. John moved forward. Mycroft flinched, taking a step back. Sherlock winced as the motion dragged him sideways. Mycroft finally looked at him, startled, and plopped down on the sofa.
Uncertainty sparked in Sherlock’s gut.
“I just wanted to ask you how your trip went. I know I already asked you in my text, but it is the sort of thing friends do.”
He hurried off down the beach. Sherlock followed him with his gaze until he was out of sight, then turned to the corpse, crawling towards it. The proof of the animal attack was even more conclusive up close. Sherlock couldn’t see evidence of the animal’s return to the sea, but it was difficult to determine its movements at all on the pebbled ground. The entire thing was decidedly suspicious. A seal arriving precisely when the thief had been about to plunge a knife into Sherlock, killing his attacker, then disappearing, replaced by this mysterious doctor. A most unlikely sequence of events, yet he was certainly not about to explain it away by succumbing to the man’s idiotic insistence that he was a selkie as if Sherlock were some fool.
Sherlock dropped his head back on John’s chest.
“I’m very glad to see you, too. Thank you for giving my brother an earful, even if I missed the show. Do you have anything made? I’m starving.”
Greg left for the bedroom. Sherlock wiggled on the sofa, shaking his legs in anticipation. John chuckled beside him.
He left for the kitchen, which was just across the sitting room, visible through an open doorway, so Sherlock could see him moving about. While he waited, Sherlock took another look around the sitting room, but the only change from yesterday was a discarded teacup on the side table next to an open box of biscuits. Chocolate chip. A control remote lied atop it. John had indulged in comfort food and telly last night. It might be a habitual activity, but given his desperation to make Sherlock’s acquaintance it hardly seemed coincidental. There had been no disregarded biscuits there yesterday. And he’d slept badly. Sherlock’s rejection had been a rude shock. He had stayed up late zoning out on telly and biscuits before falling asleep on the sofa, probably grabbing the afghan draped over the back at some point in the night, too tired or depressed to go upstairs to bed. The cushion that now propped up Sherlock’s back had been wedged against the opposite end when he sat down, bearing a distinct head print.
“Are you really or are you just saying that?” Greg asked, his shamed grimace indicating that he believed it to be the latter.
“I’m sure,” Greg said into his mouth as he pulled back a couple of inches. “So please don’t ask if I am, because I’ve thought about this so many times that I’m tired of my own thoughts. And you clearly want this, too, so…” Greg flashed a hopeful grin. “Are we good?”
“No, not that. Well, yes that. You should have. But how? Literally how? How could I not notice that? I don’t see Mycroft often enough. Maybe that’s why on that end. But you. How did I miss this from you?”
“I accept,” John said, his grin even brighter now.
“I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t think I would.”
Mycroft’s uneasy shock said it all.
Mycroft’s reply wasn’t long in coming.
“How could you keep this from me?”
More than willingness. Joy. Happiness glimmered in John’s eyes as he listened to Sherlock explain the tortuously long tribulations of the carpet killer case from last year, which he’d almost been forced to give up on. It purred when Sherlock pet him in his seal form, leaning into his touch, coaxing deeper massages out of him. It emanated from him as they watched telly together, John laughing at Sherlock’s mockery of the insipid storylines and myriad inaccuracies of the genre series that John watched.
“No, no,” Sherlock spoke quickly to reassure him. “Don’t feel bad about that. I’m fine.”
“I will try. I will do my best to follow your example.”
Greg stepped back.
“It is true,” Sherlock said. “Will you run if I let you go?”
“I’m staying at the Loddington House hotel. Can you pick me up?”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“Who are you calling?” John asked, apprehensive voice indicating that he knew exactly whose number Sherlock was dialing.
“I know what you’re doing.”
John’s chuckle was too desperate for Sherlock’s comfort.
Sherlock reached the top of the stairs.
“Your first meal in London isn’t going to be a sandwich,” he said. “I’m taking you out to a proper restaurant.”
“You weren’t.”
“I changed my mind. Am I to be lectured about that now? John is a doctor. He treated me right after I was almost murdered. We got to talking and found that we enjoy each other’s company. That is all.”
They sat down on the table, cups in front of them on saucers. Mrs. Hudson took a sip from her cup.
The next morning, Sherlock crept out of his room and padded softly into the sitting room. John lied on his back, one flipper on his chest while the other hung off the side, snoring softly through his nose. The sight looked so human that Sherlock grinned while he slipped onto the floor and crossed his legs to watch John sleep. The magic of John’s nature hadn’t ceased to amaze him in the past weeks. His curiosity about how such things could be possible continued to burn within him, but he had grudgingly accepted that he might never know, even if he were allowed to examine non-human DNA. He had even come to accept the usage of the word “magic” after reminding John of the old quote, “Magic is just science we don’t understand yet.” Sherlock had merely been working with an incomplete method of scientific study, an erroneous construction of the makeup of the world.
A sigh escaped Mycroft’s throat as he lowered the mobile. He really had wished to say yes. But it was better this way. He couldn’t err again, not with Greg.
“Would I lie to you about this, doctor?”
John flashed him a brilliant smile.
How was Mycroft supposed to not despair around these people? If they possessed even half the observational ability that he did, they would be able to perceive that his lack of immediate feeling was his mind’s defensive mechanism against the paralyzing onslaught of emotion that would ensue should he allow himself to feel. Such intense emotion would bring them to their knees.
“Nothing.”
“This brave front you’re putting on is embarrassing,” Sherlock said. “Weren’t you terrified only a moment ago?”
“Neither do I.”
“There is nothing nefarious about him. Nothing for you to worry about.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“What, are you going to snitch on me? You had a smoke this morning. Don’t deny it. I can smell it on your breath.”
“I will not promise that. If my research calls for a head, then I’m getting a head.”
“I’m aromantic asexual.”
“What do you need?”
Drat. Too late.
“And you’ll always have me,” John said, holding Sherlock’s hand.
“It is his case,” John whispered into Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock pressed his lips together in a poor approximation of a smile, which was meant to relieve the tension, but probably did the opposite. He gripped John’s hand.
John shrugged.
“Not the rabid, killing kind,” Greg said quickly. “That’s all a load of bollocks.”
John shook his head, shoulders tensing further.
Greg smiled fondly.
“Uh, here,” he said, grabbing a file at the upper, right corner of his desk. “Since when do you call me Gregory?”
On the inside, Sherlock grinned at John’s fortitude. On the outside, he scowled at said brother.
````````````````````
“Yes.”
Greg gaped in horrified shock.
“I’ll never tell you what I said,” the man promised.
Even if it would make for a desperately long day. That was six hours from now. He’d be climbing up the walls before then. Or he would if this blasted ankle didn’t keep him trapped to the chair.
Greg’s concern and kind treatment toward Sherlock only increased Mycroft’s appreciation. Far from growing tired of Sherlock’s demands and meltdowns, Greg engaged him with patience and a gentle, yet firm hand, establishing boundaries that their own parents had failed to do when he was little. Mycroft had worried at first that Sherlock would chafe under Greg’s refusal to let him walk all over him, like he did with Mycroft, but Sherlock actually backed down. Grumpily and with all the petty sulkiness that he could muster, but he did. He respected Greg, even when he complained about not getting his way.
“Yes. Although the in-law part feels a little weird to me. We don’t really think of it that way. But it’s the same basic principle otherwise. Are you comfortable with that? Is it too soon?”
“I don’t hate you, for the record,” he said. “I just find you immensely irritating.”
A sudden frown came over his face, the smile fading into surprise and curious anticipation.
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“Well, you’ve never met an Englishman like me, have you?”
“Okay, now I’m really worried,” John said, looking over his shoulder.
Mycroft’s stiff, upper lip curled upstairs in fond amusement.
That was the only appropriate thing to say under these circumstances, wasn’t it? John nodded, lips tight.
“Anderson is human. But I’m not telling you who isn’t.”
Sherlock and Mycroft frowned at him.
“Oi! That’s not what I said. Do not tell him that.”
“If you must,” he said, but couldn’t muster bitterness in his tone.
“You hardly tell me anything out of your own volition, so what else am I supposed to do? I was surprised when you told me that you had become partners with John.”
Sherlock’s smile withered and John tensed again in his seat. Back to business, then.
John turned off the stove and looked at him, mindful of Sherlock’s expression.
Mycroft turned to Sherlock again, this time getting in his line of sight and demanding to be acknowledged.
“No. They’re simply activities that can be interpreted however the participants want. I must say, I’m relieved that you haven’t protested that it’s not possible not to feel romantic feelings or called me cold for it.”
“Did you like the site?” he asked, staying on a sensible subject for as long as he could.
“You’re worried about it, aren’t you?”
“Is that yours?” Mycroft asked.
“It’s frowned upon to be here for so long. One is supposed to spend most of one’s time in the sea, not on land. This form,” John looked down at his arm, “isn’t supposed to be the primary one.”
John gaped at him.
“Of course you are.”
“I hadn’t really thought about it. I guess so. I certainly don’t cover myself up as much as everyone else does.”
“It’s a committed, platonic relationship. More intimate than friendship. It can be monogamous or not. In many ways, it can seem like a romantic relationship to an outsider, only it’s not. I’ve only read about them, though, not been in one, obviously. But for my part, when I think of what I want with you, I think along those lines. I would also like something monogamous, unless the lack of sex is going to be a problem.”
“Impose away,” Sherlock said, stepping around them into the flat. “It’s what you’re best at.”
“Security guards don’t pop their collars, Sherlock.”
“I told him that I’m messy. He doesn’t mind.”
“More than okay. Is this how you’ve held friends before?”
“He’s willing to move in with someone who keeps dead body parts next to the food. He’s not going to be chased away so easily. Your partner is made of hardier stuff than that.”
“Don’t you threaten me with that. You’re not John. You have no idea what he would say.”
“I did tell you not to change anything in the flat for me.”
“You like it, though.”
The next morning, Sherlock dove straight from the bathroom to his violin, ignoring his stomach’s pesky demand for food in favor of his favorite Mozart concerto. He released the joy thrumming in his blood in the form of a melodious harmony that vibrated in the air and his body as surely as if the violin were a part of himself. John descended the staircase halfway through, eyes soft with latent sleepiness and hair ruffled from the pillow, a warm smile on his face. Sherlock grinned and glanced at him now and again, happiness swelling to a fever pitch at the fond fascination in John’s eyes. When Sherlock lowered his bow, his skill was rewarded with an enthusiastic hug and face nuzzle. John even pressed little kisses on his jaw.
Sherlock shut his eyes in exasperation, a disgruntled sigh dragging out of his throat.
“John transformed in front of me,” Sherlock said. “I admit that I was surprised by it.”
“I’m sorry,” John said, resting his forehead on the side of Sherlock’s neck. “I can’t imagine how horrible that must have been.”
“I’ve been wondering,” Sherlock said, licking his bottom lip. “If you don’t mind, would you transform in front of me again?”
“It’s not a problem. I wasn’t planning on leaving here that late, anyway. Unless… You think it’s too early for you.”
“May I?”
“I’m glad. To finally answer your question, I do feel a bit on uncharted waters here. Like I said, I greatly enjoy your company and I would love to continue seeing you. I’m not looking to sleep with you and then disappear, unless that’s what you would like. But I’m not sure that I want a fully committed, romantic type relationship. Apart from not being inclined in that direction, I work very long hours, as you know, and wouldn’t be able to put in the time commitment that such a relationship requires.”
Mycroft’s smile turned bittersweet. He had been the apple of his parents’ eye back then, a position that he had never realized how much he cherished until they had gaped at him in appalled disapproval when he had come out to them six years ago. They had made sure to erase the conversation from their minds since then, pretending that it had never happened, and increasing their maddening attempts at matchmaking. He must have been introduced to every “acceptable” upper class, single woman by now, none of which had been remotely compatible past a night or two in some cases. At least most of them were as annoyed by their own parents’ meddling as he was, so they could commiserate. Said intrusion in his private life had yet to taper off, even after dodging these dates for the last five months via the excuse of being busy with more important work matters. As much as it would ease his relationship with his parents if he actually became interested in one of these women, having his company procured for him stung. They still wouldn’t accept who he really was, in any case.
Sherlock rubbed his hands together, distracting himself with the light sound.
“Yes, please,” John said.
“I don’t know that I would mind you thinking of this like that.”
Mycroft sounded exhausted. Sherlock jerked up on the sofa, frowning and hugging his right leg to his chest.
Sherlock grimaced in sympathy. Sherlock had suffered through some mediocre spots, as he was now with his current composition, but to not be able to play at all, to yearn to produce music yet completely lack the ability to do so must be the most wretched feeling.
He resumed his reading, skipping ahead to the parts covering seals and the animals that they ate and encountered. His breath shuddered as he saw a picture of a killer whale, which ate seals. He frowned at the horizon, scrutinizing the water, imagining a killer whale or a great white shark breaking through the surface with a selkie caught in its jaws.
“Sherlock?”
They sat in Mrs. Hudson’s little-used dining room. Even when she had overnight guests, they tended to eat breakfast at the kitchen table. But this was a proper dinner, so they would eat it at a proper table. Mycroft better appreciate the effort they were making on his behalf.
“My life.”
“That still doesn’t answer my question about what you want from me,” Greg said. “Us, I mean. We went for ice cream and now we’re having dinner at a posh restaurant. I thought that was romantic, but that’s not for you, then?”
“I don’t need to say it to prove that I know it.”
“And miss breakfast with you on this morning of all mornings? Nonsense.”
“He’s a friend. I’m allowed to have friends.”
“Well, yeah. I don’t want you to feel like you’re in the middle here.”
Oh, for God’s sake.
A few moments after Mycroft left, John came in, looking no less agitated than when Sherlock had arrived. His tense jaw and guarded eyes softened as he closed the door and turned to Sherlock, but he didn’t sit, too restless to do so. If it weren’t for this damn ankle, Sherlock would be pacing right alongside him.
Mycroft dropped his hands before he did something that he would regret. Now was not the time. It would never be the time, not again. Greg’s revealing the truth of their relationship to Sherlock had nothing to do with him. He looked down at the hair that still clung to Greg’s jeans. Not dog hair, after all. Mycroft’s breath shivered at the realization.
“I warn you,” Sherlock said. “I sleep at odd hours, play the violin when I’m thinking, and I’m prone to
“You have a book on playing guitar. You would have at least one on singing, but you don’t. Your bookcase is arranged by subject. It’s unlikely that you have one elsewhere.”
Never mind all that. For the first time in three weeks, he had a case to solve, and he was going to do it, no matter how annoying Lestrade proved to be.
“Pub quiz? But you hate trivia. You called it asinine.”
“I’m human. I tie you to the land.”
John lopped in front of him to the bedroom and hopped atop the bed, barking softly at Sherlock to hurry in an amusing reversal of yesterday. Sherlock stretched out beside him, draping a leg over John, who continued nuzzling his neck and chest. This playful cuddling continued until one of them had to go to the loo. Then they might as well eat breakfast.
During a period of seven, hellish weeks, they couldn’t find any way to meet each other for more than a handful of hours and some scattered phone calls. Mycroft always wondered if it was the distance that persuaded Greg to seek the romance that he wanted elsewhere, or if it was a welcome reprieve back to reality. Either way, Mycroft should have been relieved that he was no longer stringing Greg along. But that wasn’t the emotion that he felt when Greg called him to announce, hesitant and apologetic, that he’d met someone else, someone who did want the same things that he did, and that he’d like to give it a shot.
“You’re discovered my dastardly ploy.”
“I thought about asking you,” he said, “but I wasn’t sure if you’d like that. I didn’t want to crowd you or take over your personal space.”
“And yet he insisted. Why is that?”
“I know. I think I knew then, but I just reacted. And I feared that I might have missed some unspoken sign from you.” Sherlock twisted his fingers in his lap. “I’m not adept at these things. Your admission that day is all I’ve had to go on. So I wanted to clear the air. I don’t mind you being attracted to me the way you are, which I assume are in the ways that I cannot feel. At least, I’m sure I don’t understand sexual attraction. I’m less certain about romantic attraction as I can’t find a good definition for what it is, but romantic things don’t interest me. I never think of someone in a romantic sense. I’m not interested in being anyone’s boyfriend. I want a friend. A close friend. You’ve become a close friend. But I’m not sure if I want to stick with the definition of “friend” that my culture uses. I was so glad when you said that your own encourages friends to be physically affectionate, because I want that. I like touching you, and I can tell that you like touching me.”
“How is he?” Greg asked, looking as if he would be heartbroken if Sherlock said that he was doing poorly. Christ, maybe Greg had been right in leaving him out. If Sherlock had to act as mediator, he would run away to Dover again and not come back until Mycroft and Greg were sharing a bed again.
“Oh, they don’t like being called leprechauns. It’s a bit of a slur.”
“By all means,” he said. “Be my guest. At least I don’t have to worry about you pulling out an album of my baby pictures, Mrs. Hudson. I need some tea.”
Mycroft’s smile widened. Mrs. Hudson looked at Sherlock, laying a hand on his right wrist.
Feet came down the stairs. Sherlock hadn’t shut the door properly. Heavy tread, hurried. It was too distant and muffled for precise identification, but it sounded like Greg. Breath frozen in his throat, Sherlock took a step back, feeling like he’d just retreated from a precipice.
“Okay enough. He made a fuss about how quickly we got together, but I got him to shut up about it. What exactly did he say to you?”
Greg sighed and lifted his head, rubbing his face with an expression of such beaten despair that Mycroft’s heart ached.
“I’ll believe it when I see it. I don’t need to be mollycoddled, Mycroft.”
“How do you know I can’t sing?” John asked, sounding cowed by Sherlock’s observations.
No, that still wasn’t right.
“Are you waiting for your ankle to be fully healed?”
Sherlock nodded shakily, keeping a watchful eye on John, who took another look at Sherlock’s bandages to make sure nothing was amiss.
The quality of conversation didn’t get any better through the rest of the night, but at least Mrs. Hudson was enjoying herself. Apparently, Sherlock and Mycroft were very entertaining when they weren’t actually trying to hurt each other’s feelings. Mycroft cut out the weird smiling after a while and gave as much as he got, which was fun. Despite his petty comments, Sherlock did enjoy himself, which was odd. Enjoying Mycroft’s company was a thing of the past, like playing hide and seek and learning to read. Not that there hadn’t been times after that. And it wasn’t terrible. He may have missed this a little. He wouldn’t be making all this effort if he hadn’t. Still, it was a relief when Mycroft left and Sherlock was able to retreat upstairs to the comfort of his violin. God, he was drained.
Patient? Why did Sherlock always have to be patient? Why couldn’t things just go faster? He sighed, sinking back in his canvas seat. John smiled, amused by the display. Sherlock had been confused by this reaction at first, but had grown to understand that John wasn’t having a laugh at his expense. Apparently, the look on Sherlock’s face when he was annoyed at the world was “cute”. Cute was the last thing that Sherlock felt like, but he wasn’t going to say no to John admiring his face. John’s cheerful acrobatics in the water helped, too. John always knew how to make him smile. How had Sherlock managed without him for so long? After John swam off into deeper water, Sherlock alternated between reading a book on a 19th-century poisoner and walking along the shoreline until he got tired of the uneven footing. Once John returned, they cuddled on the sand, Sherlock spooning John, forehead pressed against the top of John’s head. Seals couldn’t smile, not technically, but he swore that the upturned curve of John’s mouth was curled into a happy grin.
“I would love to. And presume away.”
Fair point. Sherlock would love to remain in John’s home rather than have to return to his dull hotel every night with its generic artwork and dull, single colored walls and uncomfortable chair. The thought of staying in his bed sent a thrill of warmth and discovery through him that he wasn’t sure how to interpret, but was too excited by the prospect to care. Due to his ankle, he had yet to see the upstairs of the house, much less John’s bedroom. What new data would he glean there? Favorite books? More clues on John’s selkie nature? Not that Sherlock would go sniffing around without John’s permission, but superficial details gave him plenty to continue studying this fascinating man. His friend.
“Thank you for that.”
Sherlock’s gut pinched.
“And your reasons were so much purer. You probably—”
Sherlock looked up, taking a good look at Greg for the first time since he’d come in. He was tired from his workday. The stain in his shirt cuff was almost gone. He must have noticed it and washed it off. And he looked decidedly annoyed and disappointed by Sherlock’s last comment. Why was everyone disappointed with him today? Granted, it had only been Mycroft and Greg just now, but it was very off-putting. Although what Sherlock had said had been a bit rude, now that he thought about it. But nothing that Greg wasn’t used to. Sherlock pursed his lips. Today was hard enough. Why did people have to keep making it even harder?
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, bristling at the accusation. John rolled his eyes.
Sherlock texted him exactly that.
“I’m going to have to get naked for a second,” John said. “I hope you don’t mind.”
“Nonsense. You’re my doctor and I will accept no less than excellence, so you must be the best.”
“I’m working past it, alright? John said he’s fine without sex. I trust him. So I’m not going to worry about that, so stop looking at me like that.”
John frowned, confused. Sherlock huffed out a relieved laugh even as John’s eyes widened in horrified surprise.
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed further.
“You’re fine,” Greg said, starting to walk toward the sitting room. “I’m not offended or anything. And it’s too late to feel weird about me being able to smell you. That has been the case since day one.”
Sherlock shuffled his feet, digging his hands into his coat pockets.
“I’m glad you abstained from such an offer today. I can make my way perfectly well on my own, as you can see.”
“Of course it is.
“Of course I did. I wasn’t going to endanger him.”
“I was being sarcastic and you know it. But… I do have to concede that they are pretty amazing, if everything you claim in your website is true.”
Sherlock spent more time than ever at the lab at Barts until he got sick of the place, something which he hadn’t thought was possible. When was chemical research not joyful and stimulating? The criminals of London continued to be boring, so no help there. Maybe another fascinating crime would arise in Dover, but what were the chances of that happening any time soon? Infodumping to Mrs. Hudson about the latest thing he had read got boring after a while, as did watching telly. He tried to read, but only managed it in fits and starts. He sent Mycroft pictures of ugly outfits to annoy him, but it backfired, as Sherlock was also horrified by the visual travesty. Walking helped. The fresh air. Exercise. The soothing balm of pleasing architecture and the rumble of city life. Yet as soon as he returned home and the walls shut themselves up around him, he wanted to curl up into a ball.
John nudged Sherlock’s arm with his flipper. When Sherlock removed it, John sank to the floor, transforming back into human form. Mycroft startled again, eyes widening, although not as much as the previous time.
If Sherlock kept rubbing his sheet this much, he was going to wear a hole into it.
, Lestrade replied.
John rewarded him by skipping up to him and sitting up on his front flippers, raising his altered face to Sherlock’s, its long snout making him look like a friendly dog, but Sherlock wasn’t about to tell him that. Instead, he held his hand above John’s head and asked,
John had ducked his head, cheeks flushing, but he smiled, squeezing Sherlock’s hand under the table. Thankfully, Mrs. Hudson kept the more salacious details to herself, but the way that she weaved in and out of non-human communities despite these not being overly friendly towards humans was fascinating. Instructive, too. Sherlock was technically doing the same even though John had no connection to his own. How had she kept all this to herself for all these years? Sherlock had asked about her past before, but she had pretended that it was all ordinary and boring. Childhood outside London. Uni. Exotic dancing. Having a row with Marge once a year. Marrying a drug dealer. Absolutely nothing suggesting such an interesting array of connections enmeshed in the midst of all that.
“I’m not,” Sherlock said, voice tight and subdued. “I wouldn’t. But my point still stands. Don’t try to deny how grossly unfair this situation is.”
John’s disapproval vanished with a fond smile.
“But I’m not the romantic sort. Either in behavior or actual experience. I’m aromantic. Do you know what that means?”
“Yeah, sounds good to me, too. You are liking this so far?”
“Time, little brother. People require time after ending a long-term relationship. Would you have jumped into bed with John only four months after Victor left?”
Greg somehow looked crestfallen “You did? Shit, I should have come down earlier. I’m sorry.”
“Oh. Right. I haven’t forgotten that. Slip of the tongue. Well, if you want to know my opinion, I think you’re doing a great job at this.”
“It doesn’t matter,” he said, ignoring the prick of guilt in his gut. “He’s moved on. He wants all the trappings of a nuclear family, which I can’t give him, so it matters little what I feel for him, really. I don’t know why I even brought it up.”
“It would be illegal for them to contact you,” Sherlock said, already knowing that wouldn’t be a comfort.
Sherlock shrugged.
“No, that’s not what I said. I did not say that. Just…” John rubbed Sherlock’s shins. “Stay there. I was just asking, that’s all. Since you did this yesterday. Just for future reference.”
With a tight smile, Mycroft stepped out, shutting the door softly behind him. Sherlock rushed to the window, listening intently to every step that Mycroft took down the stairs, and watched him exit the building and get into the black car waiting for him by the pavement. The distance wasn’t that great, yet it was far enough, and, combined with the angle, it would be easy to confuse one emotion with another. A friendly smile could look like a sneer, for example. Or tiredness could look like sadness.
John stiffened. Shit. Oh shit, shit, shit. Sherlock raised his head. John had dropped his own and stared sorrowfully at the table, lips pressed together so tightly that they were white. He clung to Sherlock’s hand, thumb moving restlessly over his skin.
Greg went home. He returned some hours later with a suitcase and a stuffed duffel bag.
Did John mind not sleeping in the same bed with him? If he did, not enough to say, so Sherlock should take that as a “no” and quit fussing about it like Mrs. Hudson had told him to. He could hear her kindly, yet firm, voice now.
“You’re very pensive,” John said, raising his head and frowning at him. “It’s starting to worry me.”
“You couldn’t fool me with a lie even if you were really trying, and now you’re not even doing that. You are a little nervous. The only person you’ve come out to has been Mrs. Hudson. It will be fine.”
“Do we really?”
“Since it doesn’t bother you for me to say it, I do have romantic feelings for you. If you also felt them for me—it’s totally okay that you don’t—but if you did, then my answer would be simple. I’d want to be with you as a couple. Monogamous. But you don’t want to be a couple, which is fine. I don’t want to impose anything on you.”
“Not so much relationships as relationship.” Sherlock tapped his right thumb against his left. “This is my first. And not the sort that you’re thinking of.”
“Well, yeah. Sherlock didn’t tell me anything. Don’t worry. Greg did tell me other stuff, though. I just wanted to know how you’re doing with all that.”
Greg’s smile softened.
“Hey, uh. It’s probably too early for this, but it’s getting chilly and I’m having a good time with you. Do you want to, maybe, come back to my flat?” Embarrassed uncertainty entered Greg’s eyes. “Just to keep talking if you want. I don’t want to presume—”
The descent to the beach was a bit tricky due to Sherlock’s ankle, but John stayed close by his side, ready to catch him if he stumbled on the pebbles. John carried a canvas folding chair for Sherlock to sit on and a backpack filled with his seal skin, Sherlock’s book, a towel, and a woolen blanket in case Sherlock got cold.. A breeze blew across the water, but it wasn’t so chilly as to be uncomfortable. Fluffy clouds dotted a blue sky, the bright sun helping warm the ground below.
“I don’t believe you.”
Sherlock switched to his Gallery and pulled up a picture that John had taken on his phone. Sherlock was not one for selfies, but John could be so persuasive sometimes, and he was mightily glad to have it now. They stood at the beach, the ocean behind them, lopsided and not looking particularly interesting in this quick shot, but that didn’t matter. The two of them were pressed side by side, arms around each other’s shoulders, smiling. Warmth filled Sherlock’s chest, a grin swelling on his face. Five more days. Only five more days and he’d be with John again. John in his flat sitting on his sofa. Lying on his bed. Eating chips with him at the place that always gave him an extra portion. Walking in the city that filled Sherlock’s veins as if it were his own blood.
Sherlock’s annoyance retreated. He shifted in his seat, also looking out the window at the passing cars.
He sounded happy, too. Relaxed. Glad to have Sherlock with him. How often had that ever happened?
“Wait.”
“Oh, not you, too. I liked it better when you were freaking out. I will not apologize for viewing the world according to logical, scientific principles. Which you could help me with by donating a small sample of blood.”
“Stupid,” he berated himself under his breath. “So stupid.”
“I wasn’t…” Sherlock cut himself off, grasping at the floorboards with his toes. Why did he always have to be so damn transparent? “You’re welcome.”
Mycroft leaned back, the ideas percolating in his mind.
Well, he wasn’t Mrs. Hudson.
“Yes. Exchanging weekends.” Mycroft cast a dubious glance around the flat. “You might want to clean up a bit. John likes things neat.”
Biological experimentation wasn’t the sort of thing Mycroft was into. Besides, there was no chance of him entombing John in Baskerville.
“Yes, you’re a genius. Your mind operates at a level that fills me with awe.” John leaned forward, adopting a sly expression that Sherlock didn’t like one bit. “But do you know how to perform an emergency airway puncture?”
“Even I can’t manage that so easily, brother mine.”
Mycroft gazed across the room, soothing himself with the verdant landscape of the painting he had placed there.
“Some might. You don’t know what every single guard in the world does.”
Sherlock’s worry intensified. Why was Mycroft being so weird? He sounded vulnerable. Ragged. Most of the times when he allowed himself to lower his filters like this, he was upset with Sherlock.
John’s dismissive tone irked Sherlock.
“You collect souvenirs from your trips. Posters. Knickknacks. Books. This figure of Daffy Duck.”
“You’re not leaving me,” Sherlock said.
“I don’t have to tell you about every little nick and cut I get. And no thanks.”
“Thank you. No, there are no magical islands. Your ancestors just didn’t know how to navigate.”
John snorted.
“Now you’re doing it on purpose. It’s so much worse.”
He opened the door, calling Mycroft back inside.
“Not too messy?” Sherlock asked.
“You heard me. I’m not going to repeat it.”
Sherlock thought back to his discussion with John. His eager smiles. His earnest gaze, firmly reassuring Sherlock that he cared about Sherlock more than that one activity. The warmth in Sherlock’s own belly at the lack of subterfuge in his caring eyes.
“I can hear your heart beating faster,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. “Just like I could hear it when I cried on you. And every time we meet. In that first moment, your heart rate always goes up. You sound, you smell, you look, exactly like you did back then. You keep your distance. Don’t touch me as much. Respect that I don’t have that place in your life anymore. But I’ve always known that you wish I did. Maybe it’s my fault for asking to remain friends. It was selfish to not let you move on. I hoped after things got serious with Susan that your feelings toward me would change, but they haven’t, have they?”
“You know,” Greg said, his amused smile softening. “I think this is the first real conversation that we’ve ever had. We always stick to work. Maybe a little small talk that you get out of as quick as you can.”
Disappointment crossed his face. Why disappointment? Was he embarrassed that the case had been so easy, after all?
“It is a bit, yeah.”
Mycroft did reach for him this time, touching his arms, wishing that he could cradle his face instead and kiss Greg’s guilt and nerves away.
“How about my venting the other day?”
“I know,” he said. “I trust you. I’ve just never told a human before, and you have so much disdain for anything supernatural.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, fearing for a second that John might be offended, but the lightness in his eyes and voice indicated that he only spoke in jest.
“It must have been something stressful for your heartrate to shoot up like that.”
“I don’t. What I mean is, if what you feel for me is romantic, I don’t mind. I can’t ask you to stop feeling something. You could hardly oblige. As long as you respect my boundaries and don’t force me to go on a horse carriage ride or buy me flowers and chocolates or any of that nonsense, I don’t see that it need affect much.”
“Traditions,” Sherlock scoffed. “Boring.”
“My head’s pounding. I twisted my ankle. It feels like a sprain, not a break. It hurts on my torso, but I don’t think…”
“I appreciate that,” he said after a moment. “Well, once again, I have to apologize. You really are very observant.”
“That he will. Sherlock is incapable of restraining himself. Hopefully, John will give him some perspective.”
“Very smart? Should I expect another you, then?”
“I think so, too. Finally someone is getting through to him. Every time I try telling him that he shouldn’t say nasty things, he insults me.”
Sherlock huffed, but he couldn’t argue.
“Would you read to me?”
“Sorry,” Greg said. “You drifted off there. Are you okay?”
“Hm,” Sherlock hummed. “Invigorating yet sleep-inducing at once, yes. It was nice. Unexpected.”
“Are you sure that his tenancy won’t be too onerous for you? He can be quite a handful.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said. “I didn’t think.”
“Looks like the one I gave you.”
Mycroft let himself in with his key, not even pretending that he didn’t have one. Sherlock jerked upright when he heard his footsteps on the stairs, tugging the blanket he’d wrapped himself in closer around his shoulders. Mycroft opened the door. He was pristinely dressed, as always, umbrella gripped in his right hand. There were no signs of distress on his clothes or his hair. There never were. But his half-hearted smile didn’t reach his eyes, which had prominent bags under them. Nothing unusual in that. Mycroft’s sleep schedule was even worse than Sherlock’s own, but, combined with his slightly sagging posture and sluggish pace as he entered the room, it rang like an alarm bell. And he stank of cigarette smoke. Mycroft only indulged when he was upset. On top of this, he had been gaining weight for the last few months. Had it been four? Sherlock should have been paying more attention, but Mycroft’s weight oscillated so often that it didn’t bear noticing much. Yet he did have a tendency to eat his feelings even more when something was bothering him. He was already wearing a size up from his usual suits. Mycroft kept a wardrobe of larger suits tucked away from his normal wardrobe for the times when his self-discipline vanished. Sherlock hadn’t seen this particular grey pin-stripe in over a year. He had probably started overeating as soon as Greg left his wife, seeking to dampen his emotions with pies and custard.
Only when John turned to him did Sherlock dare meet his eyes. It wasn’t an empty gesture. Genuine gratitude softened John’s upset features.
No! What was he doing? He closed the tab of the Wikipedia entry on selkies, stabbing at the touchpad. He had to forget all this. Reading about it would only make it worse. He had to forget.
“No, but he better. He has no hope of solving this on his own.”
“Well, it certainly is interesting.”
“You don’t? You said you don’t want to be anyone’s boyfriend.”
“May I hug you?” he asked.
Sherlock leaned back so that he could meet John’s eyes.
“Thank you for being civil and keeping your word.”
Sherlock dipped his head in a small bow.
A look of understanding came over John’s face and he huffed with a surprised laugh. Well, Sherlock wasn’t bloody laughing.
Which lasted all of six minutes, because this case really was absurdly basic. Honestly, how did the UK keep from descending into chaos with such a mediocre police force guarding it?
They settled into a comfortable embrace, foreheads touching, eyes closed, chests pressed together in a gentle rise and fall as their breaths synced up. Sherlock brushed his fingers through John’s hair, delighting at its softness, massaging his scalp in small circles. John hummed in appreciation. Sherlock smiled at the lovely sound. John returned the favor in kind by stroking Sherlock’s hair, his fingers carefully tracing the folds of his curls.
“Which is tainted by you lying to him about this in the past.”
“What are you leading towards, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, forcing his mind to shift gears back into the present moment. Mycroft continued to scrutinize him with surprise and close interest. Too close. Sherlock chaffed at the feel of it.
“Yeah. Okay. Sorry again.”
“I know. I don’t doubt you, Mycroft. I…” Greg sighed, crossing his arms and rubbing his face. “I feel like I shouldn’t have brought it up. I’ve been ignoring it for so long and you’ve been ignoring it, but in all this ignoring, I think… Fuck, I don’t know what I’m saying. Look.”
“Oh, alright. I already intended on eating dinner with you. It’s not like you have to force me.”
Sherlock leaned forward, eyes narrowing as irritation swept through his body.
Sherlock didn’t like the direction this was taking. Pressing his head against John’s, he extended his arm out further so that the camera would encompass both of them.
Due to John working the next day, they delayed Sherlock’s move until the day after that, which was Saturday. John picked him up at 9:30, this time going up to his room to help him with his luggage. His eyes lit up with excitement upon seeing Sherlock’s violin case in his hand.
He didn’t wait for John’s reply. His bedroom door shut behind him, handle clasped in shaky fingers. He rushed to the opposite wall and leaned his forehead against it, muffling a groan of infuriated despair into the towel. He was being so bloody ridiculous. Of course John hadn’t meant to do that. Of course not. And now he thought that Sherlock blamed him. Was probably afraid of him. But he’d had to get away. He couldn’t be there in the room with him until he calmed down and banished these thoughts, this old insecurity, this instinctual fear and need to escape whenever someone looked like him like that. Why did he have to react like that with John? He had no need to fear John. He knew that. His mind knew that. Why couldn’t he have control over his own mind?
Lestrade stared at him, amazed that Sherlock was actually indulging him, which felt wrong. There was something wrong about all this, but Sherlock couldn’t… He couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
“Oh, shut it,” he said, taking out his own mobile to text Mycroft, no doubt.
“Is it the fellow who found you after you were attacked?”
“It cuts holes through the paper.”
“I wouldn’t have,” John said, horrified at the idea. “Not without knowing if you would have welcomed it. I wasn’t even thinking of that.”
“Oh, what does it matter? I’m not going to be calling him by it, anyway.”
“What happened?” Mycroft asked.
Lestrade glanced between Sherlock’s face and his jerking fingers. His suspicion faded into alert curiosity and mild sympathy.
Sherlock laughed.
Yes, they would. Sherlock turned to John, who was looking at Sherlock with acute apprehension, his impassive mask completely eroded by now. He pulled out his mobile and typed a message, which he showed to Sherlock.
“Okay. Right. Obviously.” Why the hell did he have to get flustered now? “I just wanted to be sure, just in case. You didn’t exactly choose to be my friend. You were stuck with me after the beach.”
“A relief?”
Mrs. Hudson’s long suffering silence said it all.
“That’s not what I’m saying. But perhaps it might be wise that his first impression of your flat not include running into a jar of eyes while he’s looking for the milk.”
`````````````````
Yet they grew even more delighted when he described his awe upon standing in the tower of a bridge in Prague and gazing at the medieval city spread out below, painted in reds and golds from the sunset. Or being thrilled by the simple taste of chocolate ice cream. Or exploding in laughter when watching the slapstick antics of Monty Python.
“Unusually cheerful? I’m cheerful quite often.”
John’s eyes narrowed again, now more perplexed than concerned.
“Am I?” she asked, smiling with forced innocence that made Sherlock’s eyes narrow. “Does that mean that certain tenants will listen when I tell them not to play the violin at three in the morning?”
John stared at him. Sherlock clenched his teeth, swallowing a groan of frustration.
“I didn’t think you were. That’s not why I… It was a stupid, instinctual reaction. I’m not used to people diving for my face like that. You were so upset and the thought entered my mind that you might kiss me.”
“Hey,” Greg said weakly, lips that should have smiled grimacing instead. “I wasn’t expecting you until later.”
“If it were, I would have made it clear before now. I like sex, but I don’t need it. As long as I get plenty of this,” John rubbed Sherlock’s back smiling, “I’ll be more than okay, trust me.”
“It’s fine. Greg is well aware. Do you mind? It looks like you mind.”
“I’m going to get dressed,” he mumbled.
“I think you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen, too. You already were one of them when I first met you, to be honest, but you’re definitely it now. I stare at the pictures of you on my mobile all the time.”
“If this works out, you won’t be for long.”
“It’s alright,” John said. “There’s no need to explain. I get it. Don’t worry. I’m not going to be offended or hurt or anything if you’re never comfortable being naked with me.”
Sherlock rubbed his face in John’s hair, making him chuckle.
“I’d still like to remain friends,” he said. “I know everyone says that just to be polite, but I mean it. We were always kind of a friends with benefits situation, so why not keep the friends part? I don’t want to completely lose you. Would that work for you or would it be too much?”
“I’m not looming. I’m just waiting for you. The door is locked, you know.”
“I’d love that,” he said, quickening his motions as he grabbed Sherlock’s laptop bag and suitcase.
Mycroft’s never-ending travail.
John returned soon. While he was gone, Sherlock had debated whether to ask how John interpreted Sherlock touching him, but decided not to ask.
````````````````
“I think so. You’re the better judge of what you’re feeling, not me, but I’d say yes. It was beautiful. If that’s how you feel when you listen to me, I’m humbled.” John’s voice wavered around sudden emotion. He glanced away, his smile turning bittersweet, grief shinning in his moistening eyes. “It makes me a bit homesick, actually.”
“I thought you might be asexual.”
He kept his hand poised over John’s chest, not pressing too hard, just enough to feel his heart beating so close to his own skin.
“It’s a game, Sherlock,” John had protested, interrupting Sherlock’s rant about the game’s numerous deficiencies. “It’s supposed to be light and fun, not an accurate depiction of crime solving.”
“So,” John said. “They harassed you? Nothing physical happened.”
“We tried hard not to advertise it,” Greg said. “But you didn’t completely miss it. You caught on that I was seeing someone before Susan. You commented on it.”
“That’s not how things work.”
“It can,” John said gently. “It’s alright, Sherlock. I’m not going to hurt you. You’re safe. I just wanted you to stop saying I wasn’t real. Let’s get you back on the sofa.”
“I’m not going to chat you up or anything. Don’t worry. You’re right. I’m tired of keeping it to myself. I really didn’t think of all those things, though. My medical instincts really did kick in when I saw you injured. But… I suppose that must have been in the back of my mind somewhere. Um… Look, you don’t have to speak to me again after this. You don’t owe me anything for saving your life. That’s not why I did it. We’ll just go our separate ways and never see each other again.”
“I think you and John are in a relationship.”
Since his ankle was recovered enough that he could lean on only one crutch, Sherlock finally left the stifling confines of his hotel and took a cab to the local Waterstones. He buried himself in the nature section, grabbing every book on seals and marine life that he could find. He also stopped by the folklore section, but he already knew enough to determine that a good portion of them were outright fabrications. Still, in the interests of being thorough, he bought a scholarly work on ocean folklore. He sat in an armchair in the most deserted spot of the shop and read through lunch, only stopping once his stomach’s nagging couldn’t be ignored anymore. He went around the corner, downed an order of chips, then went right back into the shop to keep reading. A couple of the shopkeepers looked at him funny, but he’d paid for the books and there was hardly a high demand for the chairs on a weekday at 2pm, so they let him be.
“Oh, stop fretting,” Sherlock said. “I’ve forgiven you for your fib. Although what you see in my brother is beyond me. Then again, you do seem to go for the vainglorious types, don’t you?”
“You’re his brother, aren’t you?” Greg had said, no trace of uncertainty in his voice.
Sherlock frowned at her in silent protest.
“It didn’t seem right to.”
“Do you want me to come over?”
“I’m alright,” she said, amusement in her tone, yet there was a hint of chiding when she added, “Thank you for asking. Although you still need to work on how you answer the phone.”
John’s jaw tightened.
“I’ll make you some tea,” Mrs. Hudson said, moving to the kitchen.
Good bedside manner. The man… seal…
John’s brow would wrinkle sometimes when he noticed Sherlock’s momentary lapse, and he’d ask if Sherlock was okay, all the reassurance that Sherlock needed.
“Yeah. A bit. I’m going on holiday in a couple of weeks. Just to the south of Spain to clear my head. And have the locals laugh at my extremely rusty Spanish.”
“Okay, not that one. So it’s settled, then?”
A fond smile grew on John’s face.
A moment later, a large wolf emerged from the corridor and strolled up to them. Sherlock jumped up and met him halfway, sitting down on the floor with a wide grin, hands instantly rising just like they had with John that first time.
“And you stop worrying, too. You’re wearing down my floorboards with all your pacing. If John wants to move in despite you keeping human body parts in the flat, nothing is going to drive him off.”
Understanding dawned in John’s eyes.
“You’re welcome. And thank you in turn for being worried about me.”
“Oh, no. Not at all. I just don’t like that word. Frigid.”
Why would no one let him think?!
“Sherlock is your middle name.”
He stepped forward and bowed a few inches down before straightening again. Mycroft raised an amused brow but didn’t comment on the bow.
“Sherlock has always been willful beyond a fault. He’s not likely to change, not even for John. Although his presence does seem to be having some effect, at least.”
“What is it?” Sherlock asked.
Mycroft’s frown darkened, always so put out by Sherlock’s refusal to give into his whims. The frustrated expression would have normally filled Sherlock with delighted glee, but not today. This was too important.
“Of course he is. On the first train. He’s well. Very much looking forward to talking to you without me vetoing your conversation topics. Don’t worry. I promise to stay out of it this time.”
Mycroft had been doing so for years since Sherlock forgot one time in a drug-induced haze. Neither of his parents had been on his list of favorite people after they had shot down Mycroft for coming out to them as bi. Mycroft had always been their golden boy, their ambitious and well-mannered favorite, yet they had as much as thrown him to the curb because of who he liked spending his time with.
“It’s likely to be a mix of both,” Mycroft admitted. “I dread to think what he’s told you.”
Sherlock put the folklore book in the bag and started picking it up when took John it from his hands.
Sherlock could see how that might be comforting.
“I know it’s hard for you,” she said, “but you need to be patient. These things don’t resolve themselves overnight.”
“God, you have no idea. His picture is by the entry in the dictionary. I’m Greg, by the way.”
John’s lips jerked with a grin.
“No. I’m a consulting detective working with the police. My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile. He had known that John loved him, but hearing it confirmed lightened the load in his chest so much that he could fly. John sighed.
“That’s the closest I can get the car,” John said when he reached Sherlock. “I can carry you, if you don’t mind.”
“Susan is also a werewolf.”
Why did he look familiar? And why was he naked? What had just happened? Sherlock was hallucinating. He had to be. Seals didn’t just turn into men. That didn’t happen outside of silly fairy tales.
“We’re willing to give you what you want. The truth. You have no reason to refuse, but I’ll give you another one. You owe him.”
Sherlock sat down in his desk chair.
“Give me a second,” Sherlock said, clicking on the notification.
“Did he phrase it like that?” he asked, hope in his voice.
“You already did when you kidnapped him. Just don’t do it again.”
“Of course it is.”
“Hello, Gregory,” Sherlock said with a wide grin, a feeling of well-being radiating through him. “Where’s my case?”
“No,” he said, too quickly. “Well, a bit. You weren’t exaggerating when you said that your organizational skills are the opposite of mine.”
“Hm, I suppose. But you put me at a disadvantage. I can’t come up with something so pretty to describe your eyes, as astonishing as they are to look at.”
“I’m not familiar with that term.”
“But that’s half the fun. You enjoyed it last time, didn’t you? God, I wish I’d skipped going to Greg’s office and come straight here. Greg’s case was rubbish, anyway. You enjoyed it, didn’t you? It’s so much fun to upbraid him. He gets all skittish and doesn’t know what to do with himself. You should have seen him on Monday. Gaping at me like a fish. I haven’t seen Mycroft speechless in ages. I should have taken a picture. Damn it, there’s a missed opportunity. I could have had it framed over the mantelpiece for him to look at every time that he stopped by.”
The next afternoon, John returned home to find Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson sitting on the armchairs, while Mycroft and Greg sat together on the sofa, pressed snugly together. John paused by the door, smiling at the assembled group in surprise.
“It still annoys people.”
It was the misery in Greg’s voice that cooled Sherlock’s anger.
Oh, no, that wasn’t a good idea. It might suck him under the water and trap him in a another world, a world of magical nonsense where a single day was centuries on the Earth. Or something like that. How did that story go again? He really shouldn’t have deleted so much from his mind palace. Who knew the treasure trove of riches that lay in fairy tales, the knowledge to be gained, the truth staring him right in the face?
“Like everything I know is a lie and I’m a bloody idiot. How should I be feeling?”
“Why was he attacking you, anyway?” John asked.
Or he wished to backtrack on certain previous statements of intent regarding the future of their relationship.
“We haven’t in years,” Greg protested.
“Bullshit. You being human had nothing to do with anything.”
“But I need to consider all the possibilities. That’s my job, one of the foundations of my entire methodology. How can I work properly f I’m missing such obvious clues in my own life? Mycroft would have noticed. He always notices everything.”
And so they did, for a grand total of eight months. Whenever they had a chance, they dined and went back to Mycroft’s house, for Greg refused to “make you suffer my crappy flat” after seeing the comfortable surroundings Mycroft had built for himself. And the king size bed, which was very helpful to their nighttime activities. Sometimes they skipped dinner and went straight home to enjoy it. Mycroft had worried that Greg would tire of their casual situation quickly, but his enthusiasm, both in bed and out of it, confirmed quite the opposite. Mycroft had rarely been so enthralled by a lover before. Greg was generous, energetic, and imaginative, and was quite the enthusiastic cuddler, too. Mycroft didn’t often linger with his bedmates after the deed was done, but he found himself enjoying Greg’s gentle caresses and murmured sweet nothings as the thrill of his climax eased into a pleasant haze of contentment.
He considered canceling the outing. It wasn’t appropriate. Sherlock would throw a tantrum if he found out and consider Greg suspect for consorting with Mycroft, probably refusing to work with him again. Then who else in Scotland Yard would take him on? Despite Greg’s best efforts, none of the other officers were very keen on Sherlock’s involvement. And Sherlock liked Greg. He had admitted as much to Mycroft. Sherlock was in too fragile a state, barely getting back on his feet after…
Sherlock grinned. John shifted up on the bed and nuzzled Sherlock’s face. Sherlock still thought of a cat every time that they did this, but that was hardly a bad thing. He grasped John’s nape, weaving his fingers through his hair as he brushed his cheek and nose against John’s face in long, languid motions. John pressed a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock hitched his left leg higher atop John’s, rubbing his calf with his toes. John stroked up his back in response, fingertips grazing atop his skin. Sherlock hummed, leaning into the touch, breath growing short at the delightful sensation. It danced through his body, bursts of dopamine vanishing the loneliness of this week, casting a feeling of contentment over his being. Sherlock’s right hand strayed over John’s chest.
“Never mind that. He still failed to see the obvious right in front of his nose.”
A wrinkle crossed John’s brow.
“John’s not going to care if I’m smoking or not.”
“Sure you did. Whatever. At least you finally know it, William Sherlock Scott.”
Sherlock paused. Damn it.
Sherlock smiled. John’s pleading face was too sweet for words.
“Not really, no.”
John gaped at Sherlock’s fingers and grabbed them, a pretty, awed smile lighting his face.
“There’s no need to push yourself. Your happy reaction is good enough for me.”
“That he has. Shall I get the teacups?”
“I know what you meant. I’m not afraid you’re dehumanizing me or anything. I’m not human to begin with. I really don’t mind the touches. I like them, actually, which you’ve probably noticed. We’re friends. Your culture isn’t very touchy-feely, as they say, but mine is. Petting. Cuddling. They’re standard displays of affection between friends and family, not just romantic gestures.”
John peered at Sherlock.
“Great. That’s great. I’m glad I told you, too. Very glad.”
“Are you sulking?” Mycroft asked.
“I can’t just do things because you want something.”
Sherlock was clinging too tightly to John’s hand, palms sweating. But John didn’t protest. He squeezed back, stroking his hair, his breath a soothing balm on Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, scarcely able to breathe.
“John is a selkie and Greg is a werewolf, aren’t they?”
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed.
“He matters to you. You always did get attached so quickly. So if I imprison him, you will cut off all ties with me. Is that it? I can’t imagine how you’d manage bailing yourself out of your own problems.”
Sudden exhaustion swept over him. Why did his parents always have to ruin everything? It was 2019, for fuck’s sake. Who cared about respectability anymore except for old bigots who refused to accept that the world had moved on without them? John squeezed his hand and kissed his knuckles. Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulder, tucking in as close as he could. Damn these armrests. He really needed to get that bench.
He glanced around. Right, his mobile was in the sitting room with his coat.
Mrs. Hudson waved a hand.
“You like my puppy eyes, do you?” he said.
“I’m not… You can’t compare me to…” Sherlock curled up further on the sofa. “Oh, shut up, both of you.”
The next Saturday, Sherlock bounced on the balls of his feet on platform 12 at St Pancras Station, waiting for the 8:54 train to come in from Dover. He had arrived fifteen minutes early in his eagerness and kept checking the clock on the announcement board, willing time to go faster. John had tried to dissuade him from picking him up, stating that he could navigate the Tube perfectly well by himself (“I have been to London before, you know”), but Sherlock wouldn’t have it. He wasn’t going to waste precious moments with John just because he was too lazy to go to the station. And he wouldn’t be able to get anything done there, anyway. He’d be as restless and impatient there as he was here, unable to do a damn thing until John knocked on the door and graced him with his beautiful face, so why shouldn’t he be here?
Sherlock dropped his head back, which annoyed him further, as the backrest was so low that it only reached up to his shoulders.
“It doesn’t seem worth it to tell her, then,” John said.
“Of course you do,” Mrs. Hudson said, smiling fondly. See? Not offended at all. “I didn’t mean to keep you two for so long.”
He stood up and buttoned his jacket.
“You heard him.”
Sherlock resented the triumphant smile in his tone most heartedly.
His words were slow, deliberate, begging for confirmation that he hadn’t just heard wrong. Did he want to have heard wrong? That would be easier. It would be a lot easier if Greg wasn’t a supernatural creature whose existence still didn’t make any logical sense according to every scientific scenario that Mycroft had devised.
“And not just random enjoyment of a random thought,” Greg continued. “I liked thinking about touching you like that. About holding you. Kissing you. Waking up in that luxurious bed of yours and making you breakfast. Seeing the way your nose wrinkles right as you wake up and open your eyes. But then it all got mixed up with Susan and seeing her wake up and making her breakfast and going on our weekend trips and running in the woods.”
“It can’t be,” Sherlock moaned, pushing at the flipper, but it wouldn’t budge. “It can’t be.”
“Put it out of your mind. It was too late for regrets three days ago, and it’s certainly too late now. You trusted me and I’m not going to back down from that. I promise you, it will be alright. So. Are we in agreement?”
Sherlock’s grip tightened on the crutches.
“Why? Because you spent the second night barely saying a word, while the next you subjected me to an epic rant about the idiocy of the police department for being such thickheaded berks?”
“Yes.” The sound quality of the call had declined. Mycroft had shifted to speaker phone. “He’s coming over to my house later. He says that this is best said in person and not over the phone.”
Mycroft looked up sharply.
“You’re not just offering because you feel guilty, are you?”
Greg narrowed his eyes. In confusion, not hostility, yet Mycroft didn’t allow himself to relax. Greg might still decide to cut the evening short.
“She kept dropping little comments, trying to fish out of me whether I would one day bring a girlfriend or boyfriend home.”
“It’s okay,” he said. “It will be okay. I promise.”
“How was that?” John asked.
“I can carry that.”
“He’s unharmed,” Mycroft said, as infuriatingly nonplussed as ever.
“I guess it has its uses. Are you alright with this?”
“You think they’re amazing?”
What Mycroft was actually asking was “why”, for the “what” was obvious. Greg had some altercation with his wife and either had felt compelled to sleep elsewhere for the night or she had kicked him out, but the particular angry tone in his voice suggested that it was the former.
, as Mycroft calls them.”
“Of course.” He turned toward the rest of the room. “As the elder one, Mycroft should be the one to offer it. Although Mrs. Hudson is obviously the head of the clan.”
Mycroft made it only as far as the next evening before calling Greg about Sherlock’s visit. It had left him in a rather pitiable state of emotional exhaustion and tentative relief over the status of their fraternal relationship. Mycroft found himself unable to focus as keenly on his work as he would like. Even his assistant noticed, which was a truly deplorable state for him to be in. Yet, unlike his previous Sherlock-induced distracted states, he wasn’t mired in anxiety over his brother. On the contrary. He was happy. Ecstatic. But also stuck in deep shame that he couldn’t drag himself out of no matter how many times he remembered Sherlock’s order that he cease feeling culpable for having any part in his drug addiction. Easier said than done when that filthy habit had almost killed him. Yet Sherlock, who was always so eager to dig in the thorns of Mycroft’s mistakes, had been alarmed at the prospect of Mycroft feeling guilty for this misdeed. That had to count for something.
“While listening to gorgeous renditions of Beethoven and Sibelius. Yes, it’s going to be so awful.”
“Okay, then,” John said, not sounding fully convinced, but he was extending the skin. Sherlock clasped his hands, hardly daring to breathe as John sat on the floor and pulled his skin over his head. The effect was as shocking and fascinating as before. In a quick, few seconds, the man disappeared and a seal emerged in his place. Sherlock’s eyes widened as he gasped. An icy tremor ran down his back and arms, but it wasn’t fear. He wasn’t cowering this time, not moaning in distress as his world view imploded around him and a primordial terror screamed through him. The hours spent with John telling him stories and soothing his injuries had done the trick. An awed smile bloomed on Sherlock’s face as John edged forward, slowly at first, large, black eyes watching Sherlock so carefully, so concerned with not spooking him this time. Sherlock’s smile widened and he reached out with his right hand, palm up.
“Are you kidding me? Have you seen you? I can’t imagine anyone finding you boring. I’m a big fan of this form of yours, if I may say so. Perfectly cuddly, too.”
“Who almost got stabbed to death two weeks ago because you’re still playing cops and robbers.”
“After I get dressed, not before,” he said in a firm command and turned back to the eggs, which he transferred onto two plates. “Hang on,” he said, frowning over his shoulder. “You said she’s a mother figure to you. Is this going to be like meeting your mum? Do I need to make a good impression? I mean, I don’t intend on making a bad impression.”
“Can you please fast-forward past that?” he asked, voice small and aggrieved. Sherlock acquiesced, skipping ahead to a nonviolent segment on otters while John kept his gaze firmly on the floor, hands curled into fists on his lap, his left trembling until the danger was past. Concern pooled in Sherlock’s belly, but he didn’t comment on it. This was the one segment that he had not inquired about. The answer was obvious enough. Why wouldn’t selkies have natural predators? John had clearly had a run in with a shark. Or someone he knew. Or both. Yes, both evidence of a personal trauma and grief appeared in the desolate wrinkling of his brow and the tormented gasping of his breath.
“Come in,” Lestrade called out.
“Mrs. Hudson knows something,” Sherlock told John.
“Of course I am. People’s insistence on shoving behaviors into strict categories is narrow-minded and exhausting.”
Sherlock groaned.
“No, you don’t.” Perhaps a little. “I’m the one who pushed you to consider other options, to find a relationship that can provide you with everything that you want. I want you to be happy. Are you happy?”
“I think I better tell Greg that I know,” Mrs. Hudson said, shaking her head, but never mind her disapproval. “Now where did I leave my phone?”
John’s eyes widened. He gaped around the room, eyes wide in shocked bewilderment.
They fell into an easy silence, marked only by the sound of their breaths and the pleasant lullaby of the waves beating against the shore near the house. After a while, Sherlock’s motions died down and he took to studying John’s hand. John’s fingers were smaller than his own. Short nails, neatly cut, receiving no special maintenance. The skin of his knuckles was a bit dry and cracked from the lowered humidity of March, but not badly so. He applied lotion. Cocoa butter, from the scent clinging to his skin. The top portion of his middle finger tilted slightly to the right, while the rest of his fingers ran straight. An old injury? Something had exerted pressure against that part of his finger. Oh, of course. John was right handed.
Wait. This wasn’t all that he could do. There was no fixing John’s relationship with his family, not unless they themselves decided to stop being such selfish pricks, but they weren’t the only family that John could ever have.
“Your turn now. Do you want anything?”
“Okay. Um, what about me going on holiday?”
“Five days isn’t that long,” John said when they resigned themselves to pulling away. “I already have my ticket.”
“Oh, who cares about a sodding middle name?”
A fond, little smile glimmered on Mycroft’s lips. It was weird seeing that look on his face. He looked so happy, like when Sherlock had reminded him to bring the rosé before he left Mycroft’s house last week. Had Mycroft really not looked happy in so long, or did he reserve this expression for when Sherlock wasn’t around? Sherlock hoped it was the latter. Greg probably saw this face, although likely not as much these days. Sherlock should have paid more attention earlier.
Yet it still wasn’t fair for Sherlock to ask John to move in. John needed the ocean. The Thames was a poor substitute, even if John could swim in it, which he couldn’t, so what was the point in dwelling on it? John’s weekend swims were the last bit of his home that he had left, and Sherlock had already taken half of those away with their arrangement. Maybe Sherlock should go to Dover every weekend. Why should John have to miss out on that? But John liked seeing Mrs. Hudson, especially now, and he’d bonded with Greg. Sherlock hadn’t considered how necessary bonding with a fellow shapeshifter was until he saw John and Greg together. They were always more relaxed after a snuggle. John claimed that he preferred Sherlock’s cuddles, that it was different, that one type wasn’t a replacement for the other. So John did need to come to London regularly. But he couldn’t be here all the time. So what then? They were doomed to be miserable five days out of the week? For John was just as dejected by the separation as Sherlock was. Their nightly video calls were filled with the usual “I miss you”s, although Sherlock never admitted exactly how beaten down he had felt that day so John wouldn’t feel bad and worry. John never said as much, either, but Sherlock knew there was more than the exhaustion of dealing with patients in his eyes and his slumped posture. But what else could they do? Sherlock couldn’t think of a damn thing.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock, at least, continued to improve. One of his past clients had invited him to rent a flat at a building that she had just purchased. The location was ideal. Baker Street, right in the heart of central London. An old Victorian home had been divided into three flats. The client, Martha Hudson, would take the one on the ground floor, while Sherlock had his pick of the other two. Mycroft had done a thorough search into her background as soon as he was informed that his little brother had high tailed it to Florida to recover sufficient evidence to condemn Mrs. Hudson’s husband to be executed. She was around their mother’s age and was a cheerful, kindly sort. Her past was checkered, to say the least, but evidence suggested that she had been as ignorant of the true extent of her husband’s business as she claimed. This, however, didn’t keep her from pocketing a substantial portion of his illegal gains after the trial was over, which was how she was able to afford central London property, a tasteful Aston Martin, and to charge Sherlock a pittance to rent a flat from her.
“Just tell me what you think. I promise I won’t be cross.”
There was logic to what Greg was saying. Practicality dictated that one should not be too old when having children to have the stamina and time to raise them properly. Greg was 41 by now, which didn’t give him much time for maximum potential.
Yipping playfully, Greg sank to the ground beside them, wagging his tail, and placed his head on what free space was left on Sherlock’s chest, puppy eyes demanding cuddles. Sherlock readily obliged, petting his head and scratching behind his ears. The gooey feeling in his chest grew, endorphins shooting through his system, better than any rush that he’d ever had. The feeling of lightness and happiness was intoxicating. Freeing. He never wanted this to end.
Sherlock looked down and rubbed his sheet between his fingers, awkwardness crawling under his skin. No, he would not let Mycroft guilt him and make this about him not being grateful enough or some such bollocks. No way.
Monday morning, Sherlock awoke to the mattress dipping as John climbed into bed with him. Outside, dawn barely began coloring the sky a deep blue. Sherlock’s train didn’t leave for another two hours. No need to get up yet. That’s why John came now.
Sherlock went inside and shut the door behind him. Lestrade sat at his desk behind his usual stack of papers. He hadn’t had a great night’s sleep. There were bags under his eyes, which were a tad glazed, and there was an ink stain on his right shirt cuff. Lestrade was usually careful not to stain his clothing with fresh ink.
“And Victor wouldn’t have clouded your thoughts?”
John met his eyes, quietly begging for Sherlock to rescue him from his spooky brother. Sherlock tapped the crutch, stalling.
Had it? Would diving deeper into this dizzying rabbit hole work in Sherlock’s favor after all?
Sherlock clamped his mouth shut. He shouldn’t continue that thought. Shouldn’t have even begun it. John frowned at him, uncertain and shaky and a little scared. Sherlock’s whole body froze as he found himself captured by John’s inquiring eyes, shining with emotion and so very blue, the hue of the ocean deep that Sherlock had sought to convey in his song.
Greg reached out and squeezed Mycroft’s upper arm. Mycroft’s heart leaped at the touch and his breath caught in his throat. It took all his effort to not to show an external reaction.
“Hello,” John answered, tone firm and unwavering, yet he couldn’t disguise a trace of disquiet.
“The rest of the tour can wait,” Sherlock said, unbuttoning his shirt. “The only room in this flat that should concern you for the moment, doctor, is my bedroom.”
“I shall endeavor to resist the instinct.”
“Mycroft says you need time,” he said, not looking up from the floor. “So take time. If Mycroft is still being stupid, send him to me. I’ll knock some sense into him, as little as he’s capable of.”
“You can tell me,” he said softly. “Whatever it is. Please.”
John’s question was so soft, so careful, as if he might spook Sherlock by speaking too loudly.
“Of course I do, dear. You don’t even have to ask.”
John sucked in a deep, aching breath.
“Of course he did, the sodding busybody.”
Sherlock rubbed his crutch with his thumb, lowering his eyes.
Sherlock hugged himself. No, that looked bad. John mustn’t think that he was scared of him.
“I doubt that my questions will all be answered in that short amount of time.”
“Right,” Mrs. Hudson said, turning back to John, who was watching her so intently that Sherlock could almost feel him vibrating. “John, I offer you a place in our clan. Do you accept?”
“Yes. Fine. He’s smarter than me. It doesn’t matter. He’s never going to consider it.”
“More difficult than carrying you. There’s no one around. There’s no need to be embarrassed.”
“Huh. That’s a first. You’ve never cared about making your flat comfortable for guests.”
“He did have to go to work soon. I wasn’t making that up. It’s fine. If he really didn’t have to leave, he would have stayed.”
“You’re making it very hard to side with you, dear,” Mrs. Hudson said, peering at Sherlock with an exhausted look as she sat back and sipped on her wine glass.
Sherlock grinned in reply, lifting the violin to his shoulder.
“Apologies,” Mycroft said, extending a hand towards her, tilting his head. “You should go first.”
“Yes. Now.” Sherlock placed his right hand on John’s shoulder. “If you’ll just help me upright, I—”
“No, it’s not. As your friend, I’m also obligated. Selkies don’t abandon their friends so easily. I know I gave that impression after what I just told you, but I’ll never be so callous with people’s expectations of me again.” John squeezed Sherlock’s shoulders. “I want to share a selkie gesture of friendship with you, if you don’t mind. Only true friends engage in it, never acquaintances.”
“You’re worried I’m going to scare him off,” Sherlock said.
“Yes. It is.”
Mycroft fixed him with his “are you really this thick?” stare. Sherlock glared at him.
Greg whined and prodded Mycroft with a foreleg. Mycroft had unconsciously stopped stroking him. Interesting. This version of Greg welcomed touches even more than the human one did. At least, for the last few years.
“I apologize to the entire household, okay?” he said, sounding more tired by the minute. “You’re coming, yeah? You’ll like this one. She left a note.”
Sherlock had long ago finished his dinner, having scarfed it down as quickly as possible to get it out of the way. Now he cradled his tea cup on the cushion in his lap, the familiarity of the object grounding him as he listened to tales about the act of transforming one’s entire body being as commonplace as changing one’s shoes. He gripped the cup more tightly than normal, but his eyes were fixed on John’s face, captivated by every word, every gesture. John had a habit of rubbing right beside his right eye whenever he struggled to phrase an explanation in a way that Sherlock could understand. His eyes lit up when speaking of playing with his fellow selkies like children at the beach, and the terrifying wonder of watching an octopus change its skin into a whirlwind of different colors and textures within seconds.
“John,” Mycroft interrupted before John could finish his fumbling towards hanging up the phone.
“I’ll tell Mycroft later. My parents can also wait. Much, much later.”
“But someone needs to die for you to have that case, though,” John said.
“That’s not the point,” he muttered.
“Was that an apology?” he asked, as if the thought of Sherlock doing so was inconceivable.
Sherlock shrugged.
“By the way,” Sherlock said, smiling, eager to shift the subject in a less sorrowful direction. “Mrs. Hudson called you handsome.”
“Right,” John said, rolling his shoulders to ease the tense muscles. “Yeah. Anything’s a walk in the park after Mycroft.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him.
“Listen to your doctor, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, which curdled Sherlock’s mood even further. He slowed down only for John’s sake, not Mycroft’s. The same car that had brought Sherlock sat waiting at the curb. Sherlock and John got into the backseat, John helping him in like usual.
Something like relief sounded in John’s voice as he looked back down at his shoes. Frowning with uncertainty, Sherlock sat up on the bed, scooching closer to him.
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock pushed past him and opened the door with his own, bloody key. He grabbed the suitcase from Mycroft and rolled it into his room. Mycroft stayed out in the sitting room, which was freshly cleaned, as expected. As much as Mrs. Hudson pretended to dig in her heels about not being Sherlock’s housekeeper, she just couldn’t help herself.
The remaining days rushed by much too quickly for Sherlock’s liking. Rather, the nights did. The days crawled by in an agony of restless boredom as Sherlock did everything except literally climb the walls to distract himself from constantly checking the clock to know how soon John would be coming home. He read, wrote, composed, played the violin, limped around town, loitered by the sea shore, bought more books, stared at the celling, resisted the urge to smoke, and answered all of Mycroft’s annoying messages checking on the status of his relationship with, “Fine”.
“Hey,” Greg said, pulling him into a hug. “Come here.”
“I know. It’s fine. It just surprised me, that’s all.”
John turned him and shook his head.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. His instinct was to dismiss Mycroft’s apology out of hand as disingenuous or self-serving, but he was being so earnest and weird. Sherlock shifted in his seat, not knowing what to do with himself.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said the instant that he heard them start going down the stairs. “I’m really sorry. I didn’t know you would get so angry. I was just trying to keep you safe.”
Sherlock’s skin crawled as he recalled their leering faces, the alcohol stinking their breath and loosening their tongues as they ogled him as if he were a toy for them to play with. They assumed that he must want it with the way he dressed, the way he acted. Victor kept them at bay once he entered the picture. They assumed that he was Sherlock’s boyfriend. Sherlock let them assume that to keep himself safe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John returned his smile, excitement lighting up his eyes.
“Yeah, I’ve noticed. While we’re at it, I don’t appreciate the nature of my existence being categorized as irrational.”
“I’m not going to tell you to straighten out your flat. It’s your flat.”
“Does that complete the formalities?” Mrs. Hudson asked.
John stepped between them, looking reassuringly at Greg.
He signed. Why was this so hard? Why did he always have to be
“So how are you guys going to handle the long distance bit? Dover isn’t too far for visits.”
John peered at him closely, suspecting that Sherlock was hiding something. Sherlock could see it in his eyes, and he begged mentally for John to let it go, to not go there tonight. When John nodded, smiling as he turned to sit back on the sofa, Sherlock exhaled in glad relief.
Mycroft breathed in slowly. He still needed time to recover. Sherlock’s words must have cut in deep. The truth always did.
“No need to fret. You have quite the fun conversation ahead of you.”
He went over to the sofa and sat next to Sherlock, who squeezed his hand.
Leaving his suitcase and violin case by the door, Sherlock dove for the file and opened it, visually inhaling the specifics as quickly as he could.
“That’s what people say when they hate something but don’t want to be rude about it. You’re a medical man. Surely, you can appreciate the scientific rigor of my work, if nothing else.”
“Yes, I know. But it’s hard not to worry when you look like that.”
“Of course I did. I just didn’t use it.”
“The very notion of a mythological creature being real defies all laws of logic and reason. It isn’t scientifically possible for selkies to exist.”
