He shifts his eyes to Sherlock, who cuts a dash in black trousers and a salmon-pink button-down clinging to his lean chest. Rhapsodic with the music, he’s moving his body in alarmingly lithe ways that has John transfixed. It’s fascinating to witness Sherlock like this, so untethered and loose, nothing like the buttoned-up, imperious character Sherlock assumes in day-to-day. For a man who purports to use his body for transport only, he seems fluent in the artistry of movement. John has never, not once, seen him ooze this kind of confident sensuality. It's not new, however, that Sherlock is entirely unselfconscious as the last man standing, quite literally, amidst a sea of women on a hen do bender, being watched by an audience of judgmental eyes, dancing suggestively to
“Hypothetically, if we were to say that it’s obvious you and Molly would both be receptive to professions of romantic interest, it would not be analogous to me and a certain man of our mutual acquaintance who is inordinately not attracted to men.”
Later, when the woman finally leaves them be, they settle back onto the bench, John propping Rosie onto his lap.
Sherlock has to look away to cover his own smile.
John holds Sherlock like he will lose him if he lets go.
“Do you really want to disappoint your mother at a time like this?”
,” Mummy gushes pointedly.
Sherlock’s heart thuds in his ribcage. It wants to burst through.
What if the love of Greg’s ex-wife’s life is the “nobody PE teacher?” And not Greg? Hadn't she deserved to follow her bliss? Undoubtedly, the way in which she’d gone about it had been indelicate, but she had followed it. That's more than John can say about himself. Even when he'd thought Sherlock was dead, he never thought he'd be truly happy, because Mary would never be Sherlock. But he'd found some happiness with Mary and had moved on, to a degree, as one does. And now Sherlock is alive, and John is, once again, squandering the opportunity to be with him.
Mycroft has his hand splayed across his heart, offended by the expectation of him to perform a menial task. “Why me? Sherlock’s right there.”
John gives Sherlock a bruising kiss, and Sherlock wraps his arms more tightly around John.
John turns around, robbing Sherlock of his presence.
has broken from its chains and scarpered to this very dancefloor. Because John is not acting like someone disinterested in what Sherlock is offering. And maybe it’s partly the alcohol streaming through his veins, but it’s not the whole of it. It’s what he wants, has wanted for a long time.
“You want to live with me...there.” Sherlock’s eyes dart to the deed and back to John’s face. “In Norfolk. ‘Down the line.’”
“No. You’re right.
John chuffs a laugh out of his nose and takes a long pull of his beer, keeping his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s as he does, and Sherlock tries not to look at the stretch of his neck. It’s difficult not to, in this kind of proximity. This kind of
“Not hiding, love,” John says in a startled kind of way. “Sorry we weren't--did you win the race?”
Holmes flexed his thin, bare feet against the fire. “I can’t say that I do.”
And while Sherlock enjoys the cuddling (a distinctly puerile word that he would never have used in reference to himself until this very moment), he is losing the battle with his patience, and his libido.
Holmes let out a loud sigh. "Watson, Watson, Watson," he began softly, shaking his head dismally. "I am but a shell of a man since I can no longer lose myself in Paganini and Sarasate!”
She hesitates, but takes the leap, gets on her toes to press a kiss to Lestrade’s lips. When they part, they’re grinning stupidly at each other.
“Are you okay, dear?”
And so, the floodgates open.
Sherlock looks down to find that his dressing gown belt has come loose in the collision, John having tugged it out of its knot, giving everyone an eyeful of the bulge in his pants (made even more obvious by an off-centre dampened spot). His face flaring with heat, he makes a quick work of re-tying the belt, pulling it so taut that the band digs into his stomach.
“John,” Sherlock says, low and steady, hoping to convey
Sherlock sighs a great, big sigh of relief. “Oh, thank god. Yes.”
John takes this in blankly for a moment, and Sherlock thinks he’s got him, hook, line, and sinker, but then John huffs out a laugh and says, “God, you really are a master bullshitter.”
My thoughts stormy, I stopped before a shop’s window to distract myself and was taken by attractive enamelled gold bracelets advertised as engagement items, as in the fashion of some years standing. It was a piece of jewelry that would look most becoming on a pale, slender wrist.
Holmes’s hand left my prick and he climbed off me with great alacrity. I was so attracted and enraptured by the shift of his buttocks as he retreated to his bedroom, and then by his engorged member slapping obscenely against his stomach as he made a hasty return to me. He had acquired pomade, which he slathered generously onto my prick, then applied some inside himself. I opened my legs wide as he turned around and positioned himself betwixt my thighs, lined my cockhead with his opening. I placed my hands on each protruding hip bone to help guide him as he very slowly sank down onto me.
have a choice and you must take the chance. Fight for what you love. There is no time to waste.”
John blinks through a blur, his eyes watery with tears, and he wipes the back of his hand over them roughly, angrily. While, earlier, the alcohol had cocooned him like a plush blanket, he’s now tumbled from the rose-coloured high into a black nothingness.
“I can’t imagine her constitution being so fragile that she would not be able to handle the news that we are not, in fact, lovers.”
Her abrasive personality and cold demeanour had left much to be desired. But Sherlock had loved her, and she had loved him, in her own way. Or, at the very least, she’d been tickled by him: constantly amused, always encouraging of his scientific (and morbid) pursuits. She had understood him, and he had understood her. And while she’d been an artist, and he a scientist, there had been a symbiosis of minds.
of a baffling scenario. It’s not the kind of thing that happens in the everyday, to the everyman. John’s reaction had been odd, most definitely, a bit embarrassing, certainly, but then again he
“The finest being you,” John says without missing a beat, causing Sherlock to shutter-blink at the steering wheel. “Sherlock. Look at me.”
“And what did they all make of you?”
,” Sherlock says in genuine surprise, hips bucking involuntarily.
“Yeah. Seriously. I couldn’t wait to get the hell out of there.”
the officiant is reciting over Mummy’s hysterical sobs, Dad’s calming murmurs of placation, “
"As thoughtful as that sentiment is, some things are best left unreciprocated," Holmes murmured under his breath.
John looks attractively rumpled and soft beneath him, his eyes glimmering with meaning and truth unquelled, and it is a marvel that Sherlock could be loved this way, by this man. That Sherlock could be loved at all.
Holmes was marching proudly into retirement, starting a new life that did not require our companionship, and abandoning me, taking no second thought. I was to be left to wilt away under the unsmiling gray of the London skies.
He’s quite right; that’d been an unfortunate oversight.
a couple (and don’t intend to until John is mentally prepared for the reveal—and for all the fussing and tiresome conversations).
“John,” she interjects, tone clipped. “You keep telling me the same thing; I know you want to believe it, but we both know it’s not the truth. You don’t want this,” she gestures at the ring-box, indirectly indicating the life they’d built together; the life that had rebuilt John from the shattered remains of the man he’d been. “You don’t want
“It is, indeed."
“I know,” Greg says mournfully. “It’s pissing bleak. I'm never going to find anyone else like her. Just--never."
And then it hits him again: that familiar pang of regret. Mémé had given him so much. Had taught him not only French and the violin, but so much about himself and the world.
“But it really is not a matter of belief. It’s a matter of the preservation of tradition.”
Staying tucked behind Sherlock--with renewed urgency--John squeezes lube onto his fingers and slickens the rim of Sherlock’s arsehole, which flutters at that first touch, then sinks one, two fingers, pumping them in and out, separating his fingers inside, scissoring, and Sherlock is strung out on the languorous, unrushed nature of John’s movements, lets out indulgent
Holmes said nothing for a moment then, in a whirlwind of annoyance, turned sharply, bounded past me and flopped dramatically into his armchair.
John lets out a gust of breath once Hafiz is out of sight. “You have questions,” he says flatly, not meeting Sherlock’s eye.
Constance has stopped her leisurely stroll to get a good look at Rosie, tongue lolling and tail wagging.
Sherlock is beyond relieved to have a proper excuse. “Regrettably, John and I have already purchased tickets for the return train.”
Mummy leans over to give Mrs Hudson a peck on the lips, John and Lestrade’s wolf-whistles as a backing track.
John is quiet for a stretch. Then: “Actually, to be honest, I may have thought about it."
But the way he feels about Sherlock--it’s unmatched.
The receptionist has her head bowed over a filing cabinet drawer, finger skimming the tops of folders, tongue between her teeth in concentration, when Sherlock glides up to the front desk.
“No, it’s fine, of course, it's fine--and sorry to hear about...that,” John says awkwardly. Then he shifts gears, bumbles out, “You know I still see Mike Stamford?”
“You want to dance,” John repeats slowly, “
“Well, not at the moment,” Sherlock says, unable to help himself. “Thanks to
“Good thing it isn’t pornographic.”
Lestrade doesn’t budge, frustratingly enough, looks at Sherlock like he’s grown several heads and crosses his arms over his chest. “You know, I don’t get involved with your relationships or lack thereof because, well, frankly I don’t completely
, yes.”
“What life is there to throw away?” I cried out in utter frustration.
Mycroft stands tall and austere, expression vacant, eyes bone-dry.
For our ceremony, Holmes secured the matching gold bracelet I had bought around my wrist, and we shared gentle, solemn words and kissed, languorous, in our garden, amongst our bee kin--on English soil, beneath the heavens.
“Come, now, lads,” Dad says, sounding tired.
Mary snickers at that.
John scrambles to stand up, knocking over his beer. “Brilliant idea, that.”
He allowed me to remain holding his hand, which was undoubtedly a perk of the sparsely populated countryside, where few unfriendly eyes could fall upon us.
John looks oddly unsettled, empty mug in hand.
“Relationships take hard work,” Mummy belabours.
They’d hardly
John hurries over to join the scrum, adrenalin pumping in a way that has nothing to do with the game.
“Thanks for leaving me to
with his eyes, but somehow John has already been bewitched by Mummy, has his chin resting on his fist and a dreamy smile on his face.
, you feel so good,” John says rapturously, and Sherlock rolls half onto his back and twists around to kiss him sloppily, panting into John’s mouth as John fucks him with slow, undulating thrusts.
The waves are powerful.
I observed him sceptically. Perhaps he sensed my scrutiny, for he said without turning to look at me, “It is nothing. I have bumped my hands against the table and it is swollen and mottled. An ugly sight. That is all.”
“I insist,” John says, focussed resolutely on the task. “Least I can do.”
“Um,” Molly ventures after a few moments of tense silence. “Should we go?”
“You didn't play nice, so I don’t think I will either.”
John needn’t say a word. Words aren’t necessary.
Rosie is looking at Sherlock with saucer-eyed, beseeching need. “Sherlah? Please?”
If John had already been attracted to Sherlock, which he most certainly had, then this has brought that attraction to a fever pitch. Just watching Sherlock has made John’s cock swell in the confines of his trousers, and
“Oh, please.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John jerks a nod to his left. Sherlock takes the seat, crosses one leg over the other, and casually drapes his arm along the back of the sofa. Much to Sherlock’s satisfaction, John leans back into his arm. They almost never exist in close proximity like this, they’ve never allowed themselves to, but being here now feels like home. It feels right--at least for Sherlock.
“You want anything?”
Sherlock is electrified with want and need, but also something new:
“There’ve been men in my life who I’ve felt--who I’ve connected with. On another level, I guess. I knew it was different. But we never dated because I didn’t want other people to know that I was bisexual. Took me awhile to even admit it to myself. Bit weird saying it aloud now, to be honest. And after that night with Greg and up until I met Mary--I, yeah, I just wanted to be with men. And I was, I did, I mean. It was just--just sex. There have always been times in my life when I just wanted to be with men. It’s how I’ve always felt." John hasn't looked Sherlock in the eye once, had told all of this to the floor. "Sorry, that all came out a bit. Muddled." John pinches his eyes with a thumb and index finger and presses down. “God, I’ve never told that to anyone.”
“Watson,” said Holmes softly, “you are one of the most brave, wise, kind, and charming men I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. These qualities would be exceedingly favourable for your chosen life partner.”
“Come on, mate. We both know what I’m talking about. You and—“
They meet in the middle of the room and reach for each other.
“Because the ancient Romans would have objected to it,” Mycroft says snootily. “In fact, it would have been punishable by death. The Greeks on the other hand--”
“Hey.”
Holmes sat down on my groin and experimentally rocked against me. I groaned in desperation. “Evidence suggests that you aren’t either.”
This litany of superlatives caused the back of my eyes to prickle with tears. Holmes rarely spoke so freely or with such approbation. “Do you really think that?”
He stacks the empty plates in record time and flees to the kitchen.
Sherlock is mid eye-roll when John looks back at him, now flush with anger.
“Have you and John had a domestic?”
The woman takes a moment to register this. “Father, father--yes, I see," she says solemnly under her breath before perking up with, "But isn't that just the oldest excuse in the book! A moment is never a moment, is it? My late husband took a lot of
“Oi, Doc, can I get some more of this?” Wiggins asks, raising his empty wineglass.
“You were thinking. It was loud.” A last ditch effort, he adds, “And you’re wrong.”
Mummy would be disappointed, yes, but she’d get over it. And Sherlock wouldn’t have to suffer through an entire weekend of innuendo and fussing and over-sentimental declarations.
“I want everything you are willing to offer me.”
“It will be exponentially more insufferable with Mummy acting like a mourner from Greek myth,” Sherlock says in an undignified tone of desperation, hoping for John to take pity on him. “Also, Mycroft will be there.”
Rosie, unsatisfied by this, grinds the handful of cake into Jennifer’s? lap. She stands up with alarm while Rosie pitches into giggles.
They tell Sherlock that he’s always been John’s first choice.
Sherlock flips the mobile around and reads the opened article’s headline.
Holmes looked relieved. “Thank goodness.”
“I don’t want her,” John says with conviction. He licks his lips, wants Sherlock to touch him. “I don’t want her.”
It’s not just a physical attraction. It's the haunting regrets and earth-shattering grief he’d felt when Sherlock died, how his thoughts and dreams always manifest a Sherlock-shaped phantasm, the rare feeling of being
did indeed also define Mémé and Mummy’s relationship.
Sherlock fumbles for the car keys and opens the door, throws his coat onto the seat, flicks the dial on the heater, and unlocks the rest of the car so he can climb into the backseat. He’s just unlaced his shoes and thrown them aside when John flings open the door and clambers onto the seat beside him, snarling like a feral dog.
“An understatement,” Sherlock says, clenching his arsehole around John’s cock experimentally, causing both of them to moan.
Sherlock doesn’t want to think that John’s sudden saturnine state has to do with their conversation earlier.
“Um," John is saying, sounding a touch poleaxed. "That’s—well. Thank you.”
, Mrs Holmes.”
“Wish you hadn’t acted like you wanted nothing to do with me sometimes.”
John wordlessly hands over the bucket and spade, and Rosie happily gets down to business.
John waits until Mycroft’s out of sight to turn to Sherlock and say, “Probably a long shot, but is anything open at this hour? Anything you want to do, it’ll be my treat.”
“If you are a reflection of your family, then I’d imagine that they’re quite impressive.”
“I suppose the papers haven’t been far from the mark, then?”
“Damn.”
“The embroidery on his shirt. He was a bouncer; he’s in on the scheme.”
sound.
“Yeah, all right, sorry I haven’t the particular sort of
“No need to thank me; in fact, I should thank you. While, nominally, this is my home, it’s been less of one while you’ve been gone.”
Holmes reached for the kettle that sat on the uppermost cupboard and picked it up with a soft grunt, bringing my attention upon him fully. My eyes fell to Holmes’s hands, which were covered with black, leather gloves, rather incongruous to his indoor, relaxed attire.
“Have to say,” John says, voice all gravel, voraciously watching his thumb trace the rim of Sherlock’s fluttering arsehole, “it feels a bit like my birthday too.”
“--a photo?” is what Sherlock tunes back into. The woman brandishes her mobile, giddy. “Just a quick one, if you wouldn’t mind?”
got?” Sherlock says with disdain.
John barks out a laugh. “Greg, he's great, but he's not you. You were never an alternative, Sherlock. The connection thing I mentioned--I’ve always felt that with you. Since the day we met. I really,
Sherlock remains as still as a stone.
“Not yet,” Mary says, a glimmer in her eye.
“She’s an angel, isn’t she?”
John can feel the rise and fall of Sherlock’s damp chest against his own. Can feel the steady drumbeat of Sherlock’s heart, louder than the battering waves. Can smell the salty sea, floral notes of sun cream, and Sherlock’s breath, fragrant with vanilla, lemon, and tea--their breakfast.
It’s ridiculous that Sherlock can do this to him by just--
“Forgive me, John,” Sherlock eventually says, voice sounding overloud, “but I cannot come up with one single thing I’ve done that would lead you to think I would not want you.”
“Dinner!” Sherlock shouts, throwing his hands in the air.
be useful information? Thought you didn’t like to clutter your mind with useless rubbish.”
Sherlock tries his damndest to remain calm; to not to show frustration when a group of children nearly bowl him over not once, but twice--Rosie is enjoying herself, and Sherlock won't put a damper on her day. And John seems to be of a similar mind, keeps throwing Sherlock commiserative looks. There is some satisfaction in knowing John is as tortured as he is.
As expected, John looks at the landing door. Contemplates it.
” Sherlock protests around a mouthful of delicious, tender beef. (It had been every month.)
“That’s right. Daddy is old and susceptible to a lot more," John cringes internally, a bit, "
Sherlock glances over his shoulder then looks back to his mobile. “Understandably, your fall upset her.”
Finally, a sign of life; John quirks his lips in amusement. “Funny that she assumed you were the one--”
A hand is placed on Sherlock's shoulder, and he stiffens, startled out of his mournful quietude.
John runs a finger over Sherlock’s bottom lip with great self-satisfaction; thanks to their enthusiastic activities, the lipstick had rubbed off almost entirely.
Sherlock’s expression must betray him, because John leans over to kiss him with confidence, lifts his face, their noses a hair's-breadth apart, and looks directly into Sherlock’s eyes. “Her parents.”
What, indeed, should stop me from proposing marriage for a third--and final--time?
John’s eyes wander, looking for an escape. “Hmm?”
He’s not thought of Victor in ages. And for good reason.
Or, terrifyingly, he may spend time considering Sherlock's attachment to him in a new light.
People are speaking, but he hasn’t the faintest idea of or concern with what they’re saying, because what Sherlock had learned in the past twenty minutes is gobsmacking information to take in and digest; it rather requires his full attention.
“Is this about the Dating Killer case?” John asks.
And Sherlock may even believe it.
Sherlock agrees, but has learned not to say everything he thinks. “Quite all right.”
Sherlock snaps out of it, recalling the unfortunate reality that people other than John exist, and finds a thirtysomething Korean woman (
” Sherlock says, equally nonplussed.
I grinned.
“Guess I’m never leaving this bed,” John murmurs, amused, voice husky with morning.
“Come on,” John grits out. "Touch me."
“...Is there any particular reason you’ve just screamed ‘dinner’ at me?”
“Ooh yeah. Loads more, mate. Did he not tell you? Figured you just couldn’t make it, what with the little one and all.”
with a wink.
At some juncture, Sherlock shoots up onto his feet. “Perhaps a kiss before the new year?”
When Mrs Hudson announced me and I stepped into the old sitting room, I understood her implication immediately.
“Yeah. Because that’d just be greedy, wouldn’t it? Both men in the room?” Janine says, pinching his cheek lovingly. “Right, Sherly?”
“Yes, it’s very similar to the Scandinavian tradition,” Dad pipes up excitedly. “For them, standing under mistletoe was the place for a truce--whether you were a soldier or a spouse. Kissing was, of course, the spouse’s means of reconciliation.”
“It’s literally the only rule. You go under it, you swap spit. So. Go on.” Wiggins sniffs. “But before you make your decision you should have all the facts.” Sherlock is just on the verge of throttling him when he finishes with a dead-eyed, “I’ve always thought you were a dishy geezer.”
be caught with my trousers down, you absolute—“
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Sherlock says, lips curling. He stands up and holds out his hand.
?” As John’s about to turn his head and look, Rosie begins trampling over a perfectly manicured flower bed, making Godzilla-like noises to create a fully immersive experience. “Oi! Off the flowers, miss!” Rosie doesn’t listen, mutinously continues to destroy the flower-town. “
look like some kind of glorious sea creature. John smiles. “Daddy’s already kissed all his frogs.”
“I hadn’t spoken to Mémé in years,” Sherlock says, more to himself, lifting his head and looking unseeingly at Mycroft. “Why would she give this to me?”
“Ribbet!”
“And to you,” Holmes said, nuzzling into my neck. “I do hope one of Scots traditions is true.”
In spite of himself, Sherlock is curious. He snatches up the folder, unties the string, and unsheaths a paper--
Sherlock feels as if this budding thing between him and John is too precious to be shown to the world.
“My apologies,” I murmured as I continued into the sitting room and sat in Holmes’s armchair. Holmes opened his eyes, and placed the pipe aside, flinching nearly imperceptibly. This little display was but one instance in a deluge of instances where Holmes appeared to be in pain (evidenced that day when he picked up the kettle, prodded at the fire with a poker, removed a book from a bookshelf). No matter how many times I had insisted to aid Holmes in these tasks, Holmes had rejected my offers. I could not allow Holmes to deteriorate.
“Why didn’t you say? Jesus. Don’t people have sodding
And this time, it will be permanent.
. I kissed you because I thought, maybe, that you might want me too. But I know it’s not--it may not be what you want, it may not be what you really do, relationships, and I respect that. I can learn to live with you being Rosie’s parent and us--remaining as is. But I need you to know that, this?” He waves a hand between them. “It’s all I need. You. Rosie. I’m here for good. And if you don’t want--”
Sherlock will never tire of John’s smile, a rare and perfect gem.
. No more cake for you after that.”
“...When he was home for summer one year, I found him shirtless on the roof. Said it was for an experiment, isn’t it
It hadn’t been asked with a tone of judgment; it’d been one of sincere curiosity. The question had surprised Sherlock, but perhaps that’s because no one had ever got close enough to ask it, and he’d been even more surprised by how naturally he’d come to an answer. Systematic study was absolutely crucial, he’d told John, but it wasn’t only what madeth the man; genetics came into play, particularly from his matrilineal line. There is no question that the art that runs through Sherlock’s veins has contributed to his creativity of reasoning and thought.
With an irritated flourish, Sherlock snatches up the coat, dons it without bothering to button up, and storms outside.
Wiggins eyes Sherlock critically. “Sorry, boss, but I see us as father-son--”
“What it is, Sherlock," John intones without looking away from the telly.
“Don’t get sand in the tent, miss,” John tells Rosie.
? They’d probably call in the village vicar and exorcise the place.”
Sherlock once again decides he will avoid John for the rest of the evening until he cannot anymore. Their charade will end when they take leave of his parents’ house tomorrow (Sherlock will sleep on the sofa tonight), and life will go on as usual. The kiss (good lord, the kiss) can be explained away; it’d been a part of their act, nothing more.
and John can’t help himself, his reputation as a stoic, masculine manly-man’s man who thrives on violence, sport, and red meat be damned.
“It is very painful,” I observed.
Over the years, I better understood that I held and had held since the beginning of our association affections beyond the fraternal variety for Holmes. Often, when those feelings became too insistent, I attempted to tamp them down in various ways, whether it be busying myself with trifling pursuits, throwing myself into my career, or, most crucially, barring myself from seeing him too often. The latter tactic, however, only proved time and again to make matters worse.
“Spoiled brat,” John says fondly, his hands sliding up Sherlock’s back and over the dip of his trapezius, squeezing the taut, knotted muscles there.
“Cheers,” John tells the bartender as he pulls out his wallet and counts a few banknotes. “Maybe grab that booth over there?” he says to Sherlock in an aside, jerking his chin at an empty booth tucked away in a corner of the room.
Sherlock is arrested by the words; by the implication.
“There has been very little written on the subject of lip pattern use in forensics, though the few existing studies have shown that sex can be determined from patterns with a near 70% accuracy…”
“Sod,” Rosie mimics distractedly, plumbing the depths of the cake.
“That was merely a consequence of ‘keeping you around;’ a consequence I never anticipated, I’ll admit.” John looks stricken, and Sherlock blathers (unhelpfully) on, “And my self-restraint has weakened over the years; I suppose I am susceptible to human urges on occasion. I can assure you it won’t happen again.”
. And in the past couple of hours, John and Dad have established a rapport--at present, Sherlock is staring glazedly into the fire, half-aware of the two of them playing Top Trumps, startled into full-cognizance by their occasional triumphant shout of competitive bluster.
“How’s your--,” John bites off as Sherlock encircles his cock and slides his fist over his length, “--thigh?”
Inspired, I stepped forward and took Holmes in an embrace, Holmes going stiff, and words came stumbling out of my mouth gushingly. “Holmes, I hope you know I am overjoyed to be living with you again. I have felt so very alone these past dreadful months and could think of nothing but my poor wife—but then I thought of you, always lighting up the room with your intelligence, intrigue, talents. It was like going home to a safe, comfortable place when I thought of you. It seems you are now the one fixed point in my changing world, and it is a privilege to have you there. You have brightened my life!”
Later, they repair to the den and engage in assorted conversation that mercifully does not pertain to Sherlock, his childhood, or the type of men for which he has a predilection.
For these reasons, on that especial Hogmanay, Holmes and I tried our best not to reflect upon the past year.
Sherlock scoffs, because if that isn’t the most misguided supposition on the damn
Sherlock drags his chair around the table and places it down next to John, plops into it, and leans into John’s personal space. “Interesting.”
And, once again, Sherlock had saved John's life.
They tuck themselves back into their pants, pull up their trousers, and collapse onto the grimy ground, legs outstretched, John’s left pressed against Sherlock’s right. John takes Sherlock’s hand and holds it tight.
More to the point:
Sherlock looks down his nose at him. “How would
“Don’t oversell it, now,” John says, amused, placing the pint gently back onto the tabletop and sliding his hand out from beneath Sherlock’s. “So. Was this your spot then, back in the day? Down the pub with the lads? Bit of football hooliganism?”
John gives him a withering look. “Okay. Earlier: when we had our tongues down each other’s throats. In public.”
"Perhaps."
As he’s pouring steeped tea out of the kettle, Sherlock hears someone (John, by the sound of the tread) approach, feels fingers dragging lazily across his back.
Sherlock half-heartedly smudges the window-come, wipes it on his already soiled shirt, his movements languid. “I can help.”
He will not go down without a fight.
Love had once been a laughable concept to Sherlock.
John can’t help staring.
“I’ll tell you later, all right?”
“What
But then he’d met John, and John had challenged that man Sherlock had known so well, because there Sherlock was, affixed to someone again, and it wasn’t a detriment. It was distracting, at times, but it wasn’t destructive.
attractive people grinding up on me tonight."
“Would I be an amenable alternative to Lestrade?”
“So that’s what it’s like, then,” John says, his voice steady.
“Holmes, I am—I am rather worried if the RA worsens that you will be unable to perform any tasks at all.” Holmes was shaking his head, scoffing, dismissive of my statement, but I soldiered on, sat up straight and rounded my shoulders. “I propose to become your personal physician."
Sherlock sits on his haunches by the coffee table, takes some of Rosie’s dilapidated cake slice’s frosting and paints it across the bridge of his nose.
The end that has them exposed.
And so, if Sherlock wants to keep John, all he can do is say nothing.
He blows her a kiss back.
“Fuck it,” John says against Sherlock’s mouth. “We’ve the rest of our lives to make up for it.”
Under the weight of John’s attention, Sherlock turns it up a notch, cocks his leg out to the side, rolls his body like liquid, one hand resting on the cocked leg’s upper thigh, spindly fingers brushing upward toward his hip bone in a teasing trail.
“I rather hope what I was doing at midnight reflects what I’ll be doing for the rest of the year.”
“No--actually, yes. A raspberry scone, please.”
“You gonna make me scream it or what?” he asks pointedly, and Sherlock makes a huffy to-do of getting up and heading over. “Do me a--”
His lips were chapped and whiskey-sweet. He kissed back without hesitation and his lack of technique was made up for in fervour; he kissed like a man parched, my lips, the fountain.
He returns to the surface with a gasping breath, mouth flooded with brackish water, which he wells up with saliva and spits out. Waves sweep him up, and he rides them back to shore.
“Ah. So
Sherlock snaps his eyes up. “Why what?”
,” John barks, “Are you serious?”
This gives John pause. He and Sherlock had only gone on 2 cases within the past 6 months, and he’d been gasping for more because life in suburbia is utter hell, and while he loves Rosie to bits, the tedium of parenthood is driving him round the twist. In desperation to be unstuck from the stultifying inertia, he's been texting Sherlock once a week, like clockwork, to see if there were cases on (which, frankly, also doubled as an excuse to check in on the man), no matter how uninspired they were, but 8 times out of 10 John had either been ignored or brushed off.
Rosie looks at him. Her cries start to dwindle.
he tells her.
This, the joining of their hands, is far less invasive than a hug. Sherlock is surprised by how much it’d affected him earlier, graveside. He’s never given the act much thought before, except for thinking it a bit twee, but perhaps that’d been reductive. It can both stake a claim and/or offer quiet support. And John offers him so little in the way of physical affection, so it is a gift.
Sherlock freezes, hand poised mid-air.
John seems lost now, perhaps in a distant memory. Trying to recall a name or the sound of a laugh or the shape of a certain woman’s breasts--or something like that, maybe. For once, Sherlock resents his impeccable memory and attention to detail.
Sherlock watches Janine take Lestrade’s mobile and punch in what is obviously her number with a self-satisfied flourish. Lestrade rubs the back of his neck and looks at the floor. He finds Janine attractive, Sherlock hadn’t lied about that, but he doesn’t see it going any further than a fling. Perhaps that would satisfy Janine. But it wouldn’t satisfy Lestrade--the man’s yet to recover from his divorce awhile back; his various girlfriends since had never been enough. He is looking for stability.
It’s a weak defence and they both know it.
It had lived in John’s gestures, his looks, his comments, these past few months.
“Sure,” Wiggins says. “And get me a couple of those bacon-wrapped whatsits.” With spectacular restraint, John wordlessly snatches up Wiggins’s glass and heads back toward the kitchen, but he doesn’t make it there, stopped in his tracks by a hollered, “One more thing, Doc!”
"Yeah, maybe one. That was a little inspiring."
“I don’t wear linen,” Sherlock says, tossing his head. “I needed to test it. It was a horrendous shirt, anyway.”
“I will always be your stalwart friend, but I would whole-heartedly embrace any enhancement to that friendship, however unspeakable, that you should accept.”
Sherlock freezes mid-tea-stir. “Why wouldn’t everything be all right?” he says, robotically continuing to stir his tea.
. Put you out of a fucking job.”
And so, Sherlock tells John of his Yorkshire haunts.
Sherlock's finger comes to rest on John's jaw, applies light pressure, and John obliges, turning his head so Sherlock can brush lips against the shell of John's ear and say, “Certainly
They are going to continue on like this, it seems. As if it is of no consequence that they are pressed up against each other.
They laugh and laugh into the night.
John listens avidly as Sherlock holds court, and when Sherlock finally stops speaking, John says, “Everything you do is just--fucking amazing.”
"We were talking about the, uh, dinner. You want to. You find me.…”
more substantial than the ones Sherlock has on, a tight black number that cuts off just above the widest part of his muscular thighs.
And so Sherlock goes for a (very long) walk, takes a (very long) shower, even voluntarily helps his father reorganise the shed.
“And one more thing,” Mummy says in
John has his ankle propped on a pillow, pressing a bag of ice to the swollen mass. He hasn’t moved a muscle in hours, and yet he’s sweating like a bloody pig. He feels…slippery. And unwashed. Even though he’d taken a shower this morning. It's been a muggy day.
Mummy ignores his attempt at deflection. “Your science experiments and puzzles, they made you very happy, indeed--but this was a different happy. It seemed almost, perhaps, like love.”
None of what had happened with Greg and his ex-wife had been fair to Greg, or to Greg’s children. It’d been exceptionally cruel. Unjust. There had been too much collateral damage. John would rather die than willingly allow someone he loved to get hurt. Especially if he were the cause of that hurt. Rosie needn’t have a troubled home life; she should have the best life John can give her. And that would be the one in which he stays with Mary and they remain a happy family. It’s the life in which he is faithful to Mary, the woman he does, in fact, love. It’s not a herculean effort to stay. They’re happy together. They're making it work. Head down, carry on.
But Sherlock doesn’t move a muscle of his face, lest he give away how very much he wishes it were them.
“Sherlock, it’s okay, I’m f--”
John runs an exploratory hand up Sherlock’s body, tracing over the hill of his arse, the dip of his back, raking fingers through Sherlock’s mussed hair.
“It’ll be less time spent with your parents.”
John reaches out, traces the lip-lined dip of Sherlock’s cupid’s bow with his finger. “Femininity, for me, is attractive on anyone. And you’re already gorgeous, so this--it may be driving me a little mad.”
“Just this once. Just today,” Sherlock says, pouting his lips in an overexaggerated moue. “Please, John.”
While it isn’t a question Sherlock hasn’t seen floated before, had seen it several times, in fact, on forums and celebrity gossip blogs when he’d been bored enough to trawl the internet for pablum of the sort (a pastime he will never reveal to John), to ask it in person--to ask John--is another level of idiotic valour. This man does not know the hellfire in which John Watson can reign down upon those who slight him. But Sherlock knows;
has been to have John in his life.
to Sherlock.
“We’ve not spoken to each other for the past hour and a half. It’s not an unreasonable assumption.”
However.
John laughs into Sherlock’s lips, which part as heat pools in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach; John is doing something genius with his thumb over Sherlock’s glans, then over his frenulum, and it takes all Sherlock can to find the cogency to undo John’s buttons, shoving the shirt off John’s shoulders and pressing both of his hands into John’s bare skin, hot as a furnace. Again, he coasts his hands over John’s arms and down his firm chest and stomach before sliding a hand beneath John’s shorts and pants to run his palm over John’s hardened cock.
Sherlock will never breathe a word of this to John, of course.
Rosie clasps her hand in his. “Sherlah and Daddy will take me home now?”
lyrics. John has always admired Sherlock’s confidence in every aspect of life, but also envies him for it--the freedom of being himself, no holds barred.
Sherlock zeroes in on the ongoing situation across the room. Jamila is holding John’s hand in her lap. John seems to be engrossed in one of Mrs Hudson’s yarns about Frank Hudson and their time in Colombia, is a passive participant in Jamila’s manhandling, doesn’t react when Jamila drapes her other hand over their clasped ones in her lap.
The sketches that lie within are still in pristine condition, and he thumbs through them: a stray dog nosing around rubbish near a busy Parisian cafe, a street performer and his cello near the banks of the Seine, a self-portrait of an unsmiling Mémé (which makes Sherlock smile), pipe drooping out of the corner of her mouth. He pauses on the last sketch of a well-muscled young man (a day laborer with a penchant for ballet, Sherlock had deduced, due to his various scars and his specific musculature), draped in nothing more than a sheer shawl, the fabric wrapped like liquid around the distinctive planes and angles of his body. One of the few men who’d run in Mémé’s ragtag circles, no doubt. Sherlock had looked at this piece often to challenge himself to deduce a subject seen through another’s eyes. Mémé was perceptive, and she’d captured the man well. Sherlock had even told her as much.
Jamila recovers easily, places a kiss to John’s pressed-tight lips. “Give Rosie another birthday hug for me.”
She sweeps out of the room.
“Sherlock, you with me?”
could have missed such a crucial piece of information."
Sherlock cottons on to her meaning, a lump in his throat. “You are mistaken about the nature of my relationship with Dr Watson. We are colleagues and friends; nothing more.”
John unhooks the neckpillow from the driver’s seat headrest and shoves it under Sherlock’s hips, and Sherlock lifts his left leg in the air, folds his knee close into his chest.
On coltish legs, Sherlock manages to stand up and take a few steps forward, but another wave was hot on the heels of the previous one--it shoves Sherlock forward with brute force and he bowls headfirst into John.
Sherlock sits upright. “Oh.”
Later in the day, Sherlock plays "Happy Birthday" on the violin (lyrical accompaniment of the drunken-sailor-on-shore-leave-at-a-pub variety courtesy of everyone else) for Rosie, who is beside herself as she claps along and giggles.
“My grandmother’s.”
The thought took hold and did not relent its grip.
Sherlock continues to not move, the pinioned rather than the pinionee for a change, uncertain of how to act or what to say. Or, in all honesty, uncertain of how to breathe. He is not a stranger to attention nor does he cower from it, but John’s is a foreign breed.
“Say please,” John says.
“Nah. I’ve given him a good amount of belters.”
Lestrade swaggers out, grinning cheekily. “Am I in trouble?”
His heart stutters.
“Good god,” I blustered. “This--well, this is very astonishing.”
more creative than this if I were to play a practical joke on you. Give me some credit.”
And that had explained everything.
While the tub fills, John disrobes, and when the water’s high enough, he leans his knee on the edge of the tub and presses down his weight so he can haul his good foot over the edge. He anchors his hands down on the side of the tub and lowers himself onto his arse.
Sherlock is shocked into silence.
Though...he's not so sure about Sherlock, at the moment, who is kissing him with gulping need, like he needs
Sherlock’s eyes flit around the room, catching on their toothbrushes scattered across the floor, then on the soap, all of which he bends to collect.
“But you haven’t tried.”
Frustrated, he throws the bag of ice to the floor and announces, “I’m having a bath.”
After spending an additional hour at the museum, they commute home, give Rosie a bath, set her up in John’s bedroom with her toys, and settle into their respective armchairs in the sitting room.
Sherlock and Lestrade exchange a startled look.
I sputtered. "I am a fool! I’m so very sorry Holmes. That was—I do not even know why—I cannot—" Holmes raised a cool, placating hand. My mouth snapped shut.
“Can’t say for certain; I wasn’t paying attention,” Sherlock deadpans as he lowers his eyes to John’s lips, which flood into a smile. “I think we’ll need to try again.”
“I don’t know.” John raises his eyes to Sherlock’s again, and they are sparkling with promise--and maybe, just
It doesn’t take much, because John is already so keyed up.
. G-R-E-G, for all the bloody geniuses out there.” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I’ll be your hostess--
“...Right.”
“Mmmm, god, that’s good.”
“Ah, well--thank you,” John says, a bit fidgety. His eyes flicker from Hafiz’s chest to his eyes, lightning fast. “As do you.” John glances down at the frightened little boy hiding behind his father’s leg, and his lips quirk up. “I see you’ve been busy.”
"Looks like the tiny man outran and outsmarted you," John mutters under his breath. "Fucking cockwomble."
Sherlock blinks. “He...does?”
Sherlock bristles. “Why should
Oddly, John had said a lot without saying much at all.
“There is?” Molly says.
Sherlock pulls his and John’s hands into his lap, and they spend the rest of the ride in silence.
“You wouldn’t, would you?” Sherlock says more snappishly than intended.
But then John says it again, running a hand down Sherlock’s chest with reverence: “You don’t even
Looking up at John from beneath his lashes, he finds John gawping at him, his saliva-sheened fingers still pinched and poised ridiculously in the air. He hadn’t expected it.
Sherlock would much rather slip into a bath of hydrofluoric acid than endure this.
“What is that, Watson?” Holmes called back.
Then the laughter starts, low and appropriate-sounding, quickly spiraling into something hysterical.
Rosie slides over until she is pressed up against Sherlock’s side, grabs Sherlock’s hand. Attuned to John’s body language, she can tell that something is not right with her father.
“Hm?” Sherlock says airily, floating his eyes away past John’s head, toward the bustle of the restaurant.
--and the matching, but less wordy, headstone at the adjoining plot--
, Sherlock. We’ll talk later.”
“Not a chance,” Mrs Hudson says with good cheer. Then, with gravitas, “You boys deserve happiness, you know. After everything. What a horrible, horrible few years. And Rosie, sweet thing: she’s gained something in this, hasn’t she?”
Rosie takes a handful of her cake and shoves it under Not Mary’s nose. “Cake?”
“Okay?” John asks.
When they pull apart, John melts back into his seat, a wisp of a smile on his face. Sherlock has rarely seen him like this, without any trace of his usual sharp edges. It makes him look younger.
“Someone swap with the boss so we can do this proper,” Wiggins says, looking directly at Molly, who blinks back, oblivious.
John closes his eyes, squeezing them tight.
“What d’you mean?”
Triumphantly, Sherlock spins back around and holds up a complicated-looking, strappy, bow-dotted bra-and-thong set.
“Right, sure,” John says, nodding sagely. “Edmond Locard.”
“Yes. Tactless in the extreme. To say nothing of it being so very far from reality.”
to John.
tiny man can (and will) punch him so hard that he'll be shitting teeth for weeks.
“Sherlock Holmes!” she chides. “What on earth’s going on here?”
“Yeah, sorry. Sherlock and I were just, ah, having a chat.”
Sherlock’s mouth is suddenly very dry.
John passes a slice of buchujeon over to Rosie’s plate. “There was a look about you.”
“We meet again, Watson-Holmes table.”
John’s been speaking. Sherlock’s not heard a single word that came before, but what he’s heard is not a question, at least.
Alarmed, he pops up his head and digs his fingers into John’s left hip. “Mrs Hudson. Twelve seconds.”
“John.”
John must be given the benefit of the doubt.
“Do you hear that, mother?” Mummy calls out to her very dead mother, casting a deeply fond look at John. “I may soon very well have three sons!”
there be potential for physical intimacy, even if just for show? It’s quite sad, really, that Sherlock still thinks about last week. The damnably quaint hand-holding. Its sole purpose may have been to offer a kindness in grief. Tangible affection. But had it set a precedent?
Sherlock undoes the latch and opens the lid. Placed in the centre velvet compartment is a postcard, and it becomes clear that John had deliberately chosen a jewelry box as the vessel for the true gift to throw off Sherlock’s deductions.
Rating: T
father; he cannot possibly fulfill the emotional needs of a child, what with having the emotional bandwidth of a child himself. And, surely, John agrees.
I noticed Holmes’s erection had flagged slightly, so I reached around and coaxed it back to full hardness, employing techniques that I often used onanistically. As his prick grew hotter and heavier in my hand, he was emboldened to lift himself up and descend back to the root. Then again, and once more. It was so very deliberate and slow; my patience was tried until I could not stand it anymore.
“I do not seek crime, Watson. Somehow, it finds me. Even in the remotest of places…” Holmes noted wistfully.
“I am actually present, hello, if anyone would care to speak to me directly,” Sherlock complains.
“Almost got it,” John says abruptly, embroiled in a one-man brawl with his pants. “Bloody buggering bollocksing
Sherlock snaps his head up. “No.” He pockets his mobile. “Don’t move.”

between them) as John sucks on his neck, and once the last button is undone, he hooks a leg around the back of John’s thigh to pull him in, grabs handfuls of John’s arse, and pushes his hips up.
It’s the go-ahead.
“Yes, and I have an important call to make in fifteen minutes,” Mycroft says, hiking his laptop bag over his shoulder and gliding into the kitchen. “Do try to avoid making a ruckus.”
Greg's form of dance expression involves shadowboxing and bobbing his head like a chicken, so John has to press a fist to his mouth and look away to hide his grin. He catches Mary’s eye as he does, and she has her teeth digging into her lower lip, also practicing restraint. But Greg is going full steam ahead, looks a bit like a malfunctioning robot, now, so John loses it and bursts out laughing.
Wiggins arches a sardonic eyebrow. “But how can I be wrong if I learned from the best.”
A warm glow suffuses within Sherlock’s chest.
“Eh?” Lestrade says, wrenching his gaze away from Molly to look at Sherlock.
“Now, stop it with that face like a wet weekend and apologise to John,” Mummy is saying. “In a blink of an eye, you’ll be my age and regret ruining precious time with petty little rows.”
It’s only Greg, he’d slid his way into the booth beside John, but John hadn’t even noticed.
Mary stares at him like he has certifiably gone off his rocker.
In that moment, it all seemed so foolish to have fretted over marriage and Mary. Simply, neither had been for me. Marriage was for many a man and the man--or woman--who took Mary’s heart was a lucky one. I was to take another path. Not a typical one in the least, but one that was my own. And one that I’d started out on all those years before that night, when I met Holmes.
“Don’t be absurd; I won’t give them the satisfaction.”
Sherlock turns his head.
John slides a hand leisurely over Sherlock's hip and down the cleft of his arse to sink a finger inside him, draw out, and paint a streak of come across the swell of his arsecheek.
John wants him to know.
to be kept away--not from any bit of Sherlock--and the hand on Sherlock’s arse slides around and over Sherlock’s clothed erection. Even then, Sherlock manages not to make a peep, committed to his role as--whatever her name is. John can't be arsed to care at the moment.
His thoughts once again gravitate to his grandmother.
As if of its own volition, his hand cups the back of John’s head, presses John closer and--
“It is painful, but all right.”
Re: Sherlock’s monologue about men losing “an average of 3 kilos” to impress their paramours when in the midst of an affair: they mentioned this fact in the true crime documentary,
Lestrade rubs at the back of his neck, then waves in the direction of the kitchen. “You first.”
Mummy steps outside, hugging herself, and looks between Sherlock and John accusingly. “Everything okay out here? I heard shouting.”
“I wouldn’t want to.”
John tuts. “Would you shut up.”
“Duly noted,” Sherlock says drowsily, eyes on John’s lips, closing the distance.
It’s quite tender, feels very much like a sprain.
Like a mathematician agonising over a heretofore unsolved, but potentially paradigm-shifting equation, Sherlock shuts himself in his mind and peers at John’s words from every possible angle.
“I’m sorry?”
“Look, don’t think about all that now, yeah?" John hastens to say. "It is what it is. You'll make it work. You can make it work. But right now, you've more dancing and drinking to do.” Greg swims in front of his eyes. The tequila shots are kicking in. “So sod off and enjoy your night.”

Dad beams.
“Because I want you to be," John adds, because Sherlock may have gone quiet for too long.
John is being pushed and pulled by the tide like a ragdoll, but he likes the fight. He always likes a fight.
After laying out his and Rosie’s towels in the shade of the tent, John stands to the side to apply sun cream, eyes slipping sideways and catching on the generous curve of Sherlock’s arse as he bends to spread out his towel. It’s not often he gets to see Sherlock wearing so little clothing (for obvious reasons), so he’ll be damned if he’s not going to take advantage of the sights. He’s enshrouded by the secrecy of his sunglasses, anyway, so it’s the perfect opportunity to ogle without Sherlock twigging anything.
Starr O’Harra, former escort, has been targeting wealthy, lonely men no younger than 50, plying them with alcohol and rohypnol and robbing them blind. The chemical cocktail is concocted with such scientific precision that Starr’s victims remember nothing come morning; their only souvenir is an eye-poppingly high credit card bill that includes purchases of top-shelf liquor (purchased from, what Sherlock had discovered, restaurants that don’t exist) and designer clothes.
Sherlock sighs, pressing his forehead to the ice-cold glass of the window. “It was performative. There was no love lost between Mummy and Mémé.”
“Mr Big Mouth’s been oddly quiet today.” Sherlock’s not on his game. He’d only
“What is it?” John says, military instinct kicking in, already on edge.
“What’re you having?” John asks.
For the Man Who Knows Everything, Sherlock hasn’t a clue about John’s feelings.
These days, he and John are closer than they have ever been, their friendship fortified by years of tragedy and strife. Bloodied, but unbowed. Sherlock will take what they have, cherish it, and never let it go, no matter if it never becomes
My eyes opened. We had lost track of time, so absorbed in each other were we. I kissed the top of Holmes’s sweaty head. “Happy New Year, my dearest.”
There’s a knock at the door.
John slides out his fingers, looks up at Sherlock apologetically. “Sorry, I shouldn’t--”
“I can’t breathe,” Sherlock mutters into her armpit.
He wants to tell John how he’s made Sherlock a better man; how he would be led astray without John; how he’s never enjoyed the company of someone even as iota as much as he has John’s; how a great deal of his waking moments are occupied with thoughts of John; how Sherlock is in
“--I will be devastated. You will not find someone like him again.”
“Sure, dear,” Mrs Hudson says and Sherlock can sense the implication in her tone--
“Jesus, John, you must’ve spent a bomb on that,” Lestrade says. “Last I remember is Catherine Eddowes’s shawl going for 3 million quid a few years back. I mean, maybe this isn’t on the same level. But, still.”
John’s eyes lock onto Sherlock’s chest, and he sits on his haunches to have a wider view in which to sup him up. “God, you’re stunning.”
. It would fill me so
Sherlock looks desperately at John, telegraphing
“No. Listen to me.” John’s voice is all military steel, and it commands Sherlock’s attention. “I know this one wasn’t bad. I know it’s basically a nick. But things--they’re different now.” John drops his eyes and stares, hard, at his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “When Rosie was born, I realised that I couldn’t just live--or not live--for myself anymore. I had someone to live for. Before her, I didn’t care. I’d throw myself in front of a bus or a bullet if you asked me to. I mean, Christ: I have done. And that was obviously reckless. But I
There is also indignance.
Before I could even think to restrain myself, the elation spurred by that joyous moment overcame me. I surged forward and planted an impassioned kiss upon Holmes's lips.
Holmes narrowed his eyes. “Is that so?”
Holmes’s jaw was tight. “Will you, in fact?”
Why does everything with him
A gobsmacked man with a child in tow are making their ways through the crowd toward John, and as they get closer, a few essential facts about the man jump out:
Everyone murmurs similar sentiments and goodbyes. She then looks at Sherlock. “And so lovely seeing you again, Sherlock.”
The soap falls out of John’s hand and plops into the water. “On the pitch?” John says, feigning ignorance. “I didn't hit my head too hard; think I would’ve remembered that.”
That’s...new.
Finally, John looks at him. “It’s the kind of thing mates tell each other. And you’re my best mate.”
They sit side by side on the loveseat as Mummy and Dad go back and forth about some inanity or other; Sherlock can’t be bothered to listen because he can feel John’s eyes on him, and it is distracting. Nor can he look at John because, if he does, he will want to (now now
I laughed nervously. “I couldn’t possibly be more certain, Holmes. I have had ample time to think about it: nearly 8 years, in fact.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. You know me, John. I’d hardly waste my time if I didn’t find you an enjoyable companion.” John snorts, shakes his head ruefully. “What?”
Thus, it was due to that freed beast of desire (and partly because of my state of inebriation) that I boldly bridged the tenuous gap between us to place a kiss on Holmes’s lips.
And then Sherlock steps back, his eyes sweeping up John’s shirtfront to his eyes, and starts rotating his hips and shoulders.
John squirms in his seat, caught off guard by how
“I love you.”
idiot."
“You’re so fucking sexy like this,” John says in Sherlock’s ear, low and guttural, moving Sherlock’s arm out of the way to hook his own underneath Sherlock’s knee.
Holmes pulled his hand out of mine and unclamped one of my braces and unbuttoned my shirt with the other hand, employing a level of dexterity that was so typically Holmesian. In no time, he was onto the last button, which he undid with a flourish.
“I like it when you speak French. Say something else.”
Mary ends up buying 4 tequila shots, per Greg’s request.
It’s the deed to Mémé’s sprawling, beloved cottage in Norfolk.
“Not one word,” John agrees with a deadly look.
Molly sighs. “Helps me to talk.”
“Holmes. Please," I said sternly. "It is the least I can do.”
But they’d at least shared a quiet, mutual love all these years. That still counted. It was still love.
“Wasn’t so bad. Our friends are pretty fastidious.”
Holmes wrinkled his nose like his smelled something afoul. “Tradition?”
John removes his finger and opens his mouth, begins to kiss and suck at Sherlock’s arsehole with obscene slurping sounds, wringing a chant of “Oh, god, oh, oh, god,” from Sherlock’s throat.
As Sherlock settles into the driver’s seat, he becomes aware that his father’s Peugeot has seen better days.

“Hey, now--we had fun. For a hot minute. Or, really, a hot second.”

“What?” Sherlock tries to school his expression back into one of impassivity. “What about my face?”
“Please, don’t give
But then something shifts in him, and he looks at Sherlock, breaking into a brilliant smile that makes Sherlock's heart sing. “Tea?” he says.
“‘Enjoyable companion’ makes me sound like a fucking dog.”
“Greg?” Molly says, apprehensive.
It is so simple, yet so monumental, allowing Sherlock to see, with crystalline clarity, what he’d missed.
John had also felt stirrings of that
In an attempt to put Holmes in a better mood, I crossed the room and dug through the pile of books, salvaged the violin case, brushed off dust, sat down in Holmes's armchair and lay it across my lap. "Do you remember when you taught me the first measure of that Caprice? Number three, if I'm not mistaken?”
“Did Sherlock say something?”
“John,” Mrs Hudson chides.
John darts his eyes over the room, then slides his hand down Sherlock’s thigh to rest in the juncture where thigh meets groin. Telegraphing:
John proceeds to eat in philosophic silence, watching Rosie watch the boys. The tension and anger he’d carried on their walk from the Pergola has dissipated, but he’s not yet fully recovered, hasn't said much to Sherlock or to Rosie since the incident.
Once outside in the sharp winter air, they take one look at each other and double over with laughter.
“Fuck, yeah, god, that’s--Jesus--fuck,” John babbles.
Sherlock smiles.
He can only hope that Mary would forgive him.
“Holmes, are you cold?” I asked curiously.
Perhaps some of Sherlock’s methods need fine-tuning, after all.
Hadn't they?
If Lestrade is looking for stability, perhaps he needn’t look very far. Because Molly’s always been there, a ballast. Not just any ballast: one that would without a doubt keep him afloat.
Sherlock’s grounding shifts beneath his feet. He has to sit down. He does, on the edge of his bed, and stares at the wall across, mind whirring in attempt to process this new information. How could he have missed it? It'd been the final piece of the puzzle that is John Watson.
He then drops low to the seat, and Sherlock feels a probing wetness at his entrance.
What qualities had attracted John to this man?
He’s breathing hard, and he feels very far away, hanging in the ether, amongst the stars, far from any grounding.
“I’m Greg Lestrade.” He looks pointedly at Sherlock. “That’s right.
John leans down in increments, angles his head.
gesture, but they ignore him and are quickly lost amongst the mass of people bellied up to the bar.
“Be quick, my man. I can’t stand it,” Holmes said, breathless, turning around and climbing needily atop me, all limbs, kissing me sloppily.
Rosie looks up at John inquisitively. “Daddy?”
“Hey, Doc.”
And then Sherlock is, unmistakably, pressing his arse into John’s groin.
After catching their breaths, unsticking themselves from a messy tangle of limbs and effluvia, John gives them both a perfunctory wipe-down with a flannel, saying, in wonder, "That was somehow even better than last night, and last night was incredible. Wasn’t sure it could be topped.”
Rosie seems outraged. “But—but I’m not going to
“Hm?”
Silence.
throughout England.
Sherlock mimics in a nasally tone. “Dreadful. How can you stand to watch them ad infinitum?”
. Is that really—“
“You’re one to talk,” Sherlock says, running a hand up the musculature of John’s arm.
It is agonisingly slow, and something breaks in Sherlock as he is overcome with the base need to be fucked into oblivion.
Sherlock dips his head to whisper something into Rosie’s ear, and she beams, kissing the palm of her hand and flinging her arm out. Her tiny, high voice drifts over to him on the pitch: “Kissy, Daddy!”
With their hands already clasped, John helps hoist Sherlock to his feet, eyes falling to the bandage on Sherlock’s thigh. “All right?”
. An act of kindness, a softening of a blow. At least, if this is the case, John doesn’t seem to mind. At least it will not be cause for the destruction of their friendship. Sherlock is marginally heartened that his own foolish transparency hasn’t been repellent.
from the truth.”
since I had not had the opportunity to see the popular play on stage in London, and I was momentarily lost in the swashbuckling protagonist’s world of adventure until I became aware of Holmes in my peripheral vision. He was, glaringly, standing stock-still. There was scant lighting save for the gas lamp beside me, so I did not know if Holmes could even see himself. (Holmes had a macabre preference for funereally dark environs in those days. I wondered if it was Holmes’s way of obscuring the sight of his hand, which I suspected he deemed unpleasant-looking since he wore gloves nearly all the time. He usually acted cavalier about the affliction, but I knew sometimes it was merely bravado).
“Surprise,” John says, low, into his ear, holding a rectangle-shaped gift aloft at Sherlock’s eye-level. Numbly, Sherlock takes the gift, wanting very much to take John with it, to pull him down into his lap and kiss him. “But probably not really.”
With a sharp intake of breath, John’s hands gravitate to Sherlock’s bony hips, his fingernails digging into cloth. John’s cock has swollen to full hardness, is painfully stiff, and he pushes his hips forward as Sherlock grinds back into him in a delicious figure-eight.
He strides over to the coat rack, swipes up his and John’s coats and scarves, and twirls back around to meet John’s fixed gaze. “I know a place.”
“Yes.”
That evening, John books a stay at a hotel.
And he would refute it, on John’s behalf, if he’d had the cognitive ability to do so.
Holmes flitted his eyes over my face, as if searching for some kind of physical marking there that belied my statement.
John visibly relaxes, gives an awkward salute. “Hello.”
“Not even one little question?” the man needles.
“Aw, hell," Matterson says. "I’m sorry, mate."
Sherlock stares at them.
“Is this it, then?” she asks, voice quivering.
?’” John’s eye twitches and he jerks a nod in confirmation. “I was being facetious, obviously.”
Sherlock crawls over John’s body like a sinuous cat and presses a kiss to John’s neck, then dots measured, delicate kisses down John’s body--on his right pectoral, on the paunch of his stomach, right above his hip bone, stamping perfect lip prints in his wake. John feels delightfully branded:
John is staring into the face of a dead man.
Sherlock blinks. And blinks again. “The...point?”
They settle in a spot as far away as possible from the couples and families speckling the hill, spreading a blanket over the grass. Sherlock sprawls out on top of it, the sun smoothing a layer of warmth across his exposed skin.
Sherlock's eyes drop to John's lips.
Sherlock sits beside John.
Sherlock straightens up and without much thought at all opens his mouth to take John’s pinched fingers into his mouth, drags down until his lips are puckered and the olive is cradled on his tongue, bursting with brine, before swallowing it.
And so I took him in my arms and we kissed.
It will, without question, never get old.
John blanches.
John tends to be unknowable, to Sherlock, which had delighted Sherlock in the past; he’d loved the challenge. But it had taken Sherlock an embarrassing amount of time to realise that John is unknowable because of
“Has no one ever told you before?” John is saying.
One of which, John would surmise, is
Greg is zigzagging toward him, unsteady on his feet.
Holmes was watching me with anewed intensity, in the way he oft looked at a corpse that begot a conundrum.
“‘Course. ‘Course,” Lestrade says, flashing a winsome smile and thumping John on the shoulder as he passes him into the hall.
“You know.”
“Excuse me?”
Or perhaps it is.
John’s eyes go dark and hungry, and then he’s withdrawing his cock and shoving back in roughly, jerking Sherlock backwards. “That what you wanted?”
Rather anticlimactic, really.
“Yeah.”
Sherlock says, “I would very much like to kiss you.”
John stops listening entirely.
John nods curtly and throws back his drink, sucking it down to the last drop.
the one who’d articulated his desire take things slowly. Regardless, resistance is futile, and Sherlock melts into John’s sturdy embrace, drapes his arm across John’s where it is slung protectively over Sherlock’s torso.
“It isn’t in my nature to play it safe. My ego has often got the better of me, has made me do unspeakable things. Stupid things; dangerous things. I was almost certain I would be dead by the age of thirty.” John furrows his brows, pained and bemused, so Sherlock quickly continues, “For many years, all I had for company was my intellect, and I can’t imagine living without it, obviously, but I’d have never been able to live on it, alone. It would have destroyed me. I would not have stepped out of my provincial self-obsession if I hadn’t met you. I wouldn’t have realised that there are so many rich layers to this existence; that the concrete, the logical, can coexist with the abstract, the emotional, and create something larger than life. Since I met you and came to know you, I was determined to live to the greatest limitations of biology, to its farthest stretches, if it meant I could spend more time with you. And, now that you’ve given me Rosie, I wish to transcend biology.”
for many years.  Holmes and I had been in an unconsummated marriage of sorts, for all that time. Very happily, the marriage was finally consummated, though not solemnised, and it was unjust that I could not solemnise a marriage borne of a purer love than any other I had experienced.
Sherlock jumps on the chance to bring the state of affairs to an equilibrium. “Do you really want to ruin that £300 belt by having to drill in another notch?”
“It is Rheumatoid Arthritis, Holmes,” I announced with a heavy heart.
“No,” John agrees, holding back laughter. He looks up at Sherlock, who is panting above him. The man's hair is in chaos from the sea, seaweed and sand lodged and caked in his curls, water clinging to his torso, dripping droplets onto John's chest and face.
this, and Sherlock’s never not known the parameters, when it comes to them. What does John like? How much does he want? Sherlock should know the answers. He’s observed John in relationships before. (Are they in a relationship? They’ve not classified it. Shouldn’t they be talking about it? Isn’t that what people do?) But he is having a difficult time coalescing historical data into something he can use to his advantage; he feels unsettled and unsure and he can’t
,” Mary whinges.
John pulls off, his lips sheeny with saliva, and says with pleased-as-punch self-satisfaction, “Didn’t I already say that?”
“What?” John snaps, stabbing at his laptop keys with an angry flourish and finally looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and shoves past John with a single-minded focus.
“No. I don’t know,” Sherlock says as impassively as he can.
be better, John,” Sherlock says, trying for haughty and failing, voice a bit too coarse, but he recovers quickly, wraps his hand around the base of John’s cock and sucks him down.
“Yeah, I do,” John admits.
“Sherlock, please,” Sherlock says as smoothly as he can.
“I’m doing you a favour. As you said: less of my parents.”
John says, sliding purposefully out of the booth and throwing on his coat and scarf. Sherlock glares at him, obstinate and unmoving, until John slides his knee back onto the seat so he can lean over to growl in Sherlock’s ear, “And I want to be really,
Grief, that old tireless sadist that he was, revisited me like a well-acquainted foe, antagonising me endlessly, hoping I would succumb to his ugly machinations and become so heavily laden with sadness I could not function (one is reminded of our departed venerable Queen Victoria, mourning for decades, thinking of nothing but the loss of her loved one and shirking duties). I simply would not let the fiend win.
A woman opens the door to the playroom, leading Rosie by hand.
. You are not.”
I moved toward Holmes and slowly lowered myself so I was seated on the edge of the table just directly in front of him. I reached out and grasped Holmes’s swollen wrist, cradling the back of the hand and fingers in my upturned palm, then leaned down to inspect it closely.
“Fucking rude,” Starr huffs, clutching her nose, which had just become well-acquainted with John's chest at a particularly painful angle.
Once they’re out of an earshot, John glances at his mobile and purses his lips in disappointment. “It’s only half 9.”
The party, as it were, is in full swing.
, since he’d rather learned his lesson) as he peers in the fridge.
” someone sputters out, sounding frantic, and John halts. “I will not tolerate--”
“My time on this earth is almost at its end--”
“You know, that’s really starting to get old.”
John sighs hugely. “Guess I’ll need to write up a blog post, an official statement or whatever, so people’ll shut up.”
“Now that I have you here, there’s...something I wanted to talk to you about.”
Mycroft can’t meet Mummy’s eyes. “I...apologise, Mummy.”

he looked tired. John still hasn't stopped thinking about it. Yes, he hasn’t slept very much in the past 6 months, but it’s to be expected. He has a bloody 6-month-old.
“We’re never going to live this down, are we?” John says fatalistically.
Flora’s great-nieces huddle closer together, taking refuge against the howling wind.
“You mean other than the one with the monkeys and the one with the harpoon?” John asks.
“Why have various cultures over millenia taken a toxic plant and placed such incongruous meanings upon it? What’s the damn
Perched on him is Rosie, a lopsided, impish grin on her face.
“Yes.
Once things ratchet back up to hot and heavy status with Sherlock happily sucking on John’s lovely tongue, John quite rudely pushes him away, his hand braced on Sherlock’s chest to keep him at a distance.
“--as mentor-mentee. Professional, like. You want posterity to know you as someone who made moves on his most gifted acolyte?”
Soldiering through, pretending this is not at all out of character for them, John leans over to peer down at the sketch, making an impressed noise and saying, “That’s quite nice.”
,” he waves a hand between the two of them, “has been.”
Holmes sighed in a pained way that suggested obliging me was the most difficult thing he would ever have to endure. He pulled off the gloves, flinging them aside carelessly, and held his hands out, head turned resolutely away from me.
John sits on this for a while. Then, he audibly swallows and says, “‘Married to my work?’”
“How about you, Gregory?” Mummy suggests, a touch cutting in tone.
Rosie, clad in a frilly one-piece swimming costume, swings her legs on his bed and crows, “Ya!”
Sherlock closes his eyes, gnashes his teeth. They are absolutely not going to talk about Victor. Mummy isn’t even supposed to
Holmes smiled and stroked my face with delicate care, his thumb brushing over my bottom lip. “Then we shall, without question, be married.”
“Yep, definitely a good morning.”
“Dr Watson, I am sorry,” Hee-Eun gushes. “I didn’t recognise you.”
Mummy steps into the kitchen, closing the door to the den behind her, and joins Sherlock at the counter. “Is everything all right?”
Rosie spots Sherlock instantly, her face lighting up.
“Oh, relax. You’ve nothing to worry about because you’re so fit—you’re my
When I arrived, it was late evening. The stars were more vibrant than those in London, unimpeded by polluted skies, and the air much colder due to its proximity to the Channel. I knocked on Holmes’s ivy-laced door, and Holmes answered after only a few moments.
“Sorry,” John says, sounding distant. “My two…?”
“Oh, for the love of--I didn’t see you’d used this one, I loved this shirt!”
Sherlock is primed to strike. He leans in, testing the waters. John doesn’t recoil.
John sighs and grunts miserably as he pushes himself back up onto his good foot. He stretches out for the soap but misses, smacking it and the toothbrushes off the ledge.
. Why would I kiss them?”
Mrs Hudson claps her hands like a seal. “I can’t believe it! I was certain I’d be dead before you boys figured things out.”
John brings their joined hands to rest atop the cushiony paunch of his stomach.
“And--and to John,” Molly continues, “who’s a great dad.”
John can feel arousal nipping at his heels.
“I know you think little of such things,” I said without pause, having anticipated Holmes’s dismissal, “but it would mean the world to me for you to be my spouse, in that way."
together,” John tells Sherlock without preamble, easily picking up the thread started at the museum. “I also wanted him to think I wasn’t the coward I was all those years ago. That I could be out.”
Rosie is starry-eyed by the newness of it all, her mouth agape as she gazes up at the dizzying chalk cliffs that loom over the shore.
To his credit, Sherlock does not react outwardly to the comment.
“Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says, scandalised by the notion of Mrs Hudson not being around.
John slaps the table. “My god, how could I forget. Should publish that one in the blog; it’s incredibly thought-provoking.”
Sherlock sneers, "a kiss. Which seems to have become
In the final days of my residency in London, that liminal period between my old and new life, I endeavoured to visit landmarks and districts of which I was fond. Although I could, of course, return to the sombre metropolis whenever I so chose, I did not foresee making the effort all too often. Holmes’s sudden move could not have been more opportune; I was getting long in the tooth, had grown weary of crowds and noise, and found I was very amenable to the pastoral solitude of the South Downs.
“Correct.”
To Holmes, it was the year that birthed the mother of all failures: the Irene Adler affair. Holmes wasn’t accustomed to being bested, proud man that he is, and it smarted. Not long thereafter were the grotesque Whitechapel murders, still very fresh in our minds that day, the fifth victim murdered a month prior and a sixth possible victim killed just a week before. The killer, until this day, remains unknown. Holmes claims Scotland Yard bungled the evidence to the point of no return, called him in too late for a consultation, but was self-abasing for many years for his inability to track down the deranged “Jack the Ripper.” (I never put the case to paper for the sake of Holmes’s ego [it was also unsatisfying for everyone involved to leave readers with an unfinished case]. In any event, my account would have been but a mere drop in the bucket, since nearly every paper and rag chronicled the case in prodigious detail.)
“You’re such a prick,” John says affectionately.
on Sherlock Holmes.
“Yes, yes,
difficult ploy since it is
“Gone,” John says, taking a seat beside Sherlock. He places a gentle hand on Sherlock’s forearm. “What’s wrong?”
currently poking holes in John's eardrums has a woman murmuring in sultry tones over a bubblegum pop beat, very possibly catering to the hen do women, who are screaming lyrics at each other in delight. It’s not exactly John's style, but that doesn’t stop Mary from running her hand up his thigh and yelling into his ear, “Dance with me.”
“Slow,” Sherlock repeats, dripping with derision. “Yes, perhaps we should wait another year, just to round off the decade?”
Sherlock withdraws the pack of cigarettes from his coat’s breast pocket.
“Hey!” rings out a booming man’s voice at the end of the alleyway. It’s the opposite end of the alleyway, this time.
John lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, “Who?”
With a hint of amusement and perhaps even a smidgen of admiration, Sherlock watches her over the rim of his glass as she seamlessly inserts herself between Molly and Lestrade and takes command of the conversation. Molly looks out of sorts by the intrusion and immediately excuses herself, ignoring Lestrade's protests, and flees to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s heart is a steady drumbeat. “And you don’t.”
“I will need you to tell my parents that I died. Or that I was murdered, if you'd prefer to add a bit of spice.”
“Yes; I would die a happy man if you were to again be at my side.”
With his arms wound protectively around himself, Sherlock digs fingernails into his back, applying pressure. Presses hard enough for the half-moons of his nails to indent flesh through his shirt.
It’s a gentle kiss, lasting no more than a few seconds, but it effectively erases all of Sherlock’s doubts and regrets and self-flagellations.
Sherlock snaps his mouth shut and shifts his eyes over to John, who is looking back at him with a disarming smile.
I took his spindly hand in mine, and pressed a kiss to a knuckle. “You are far more of a wonder.”
At once, I took a hansom to Baker Street and, even though I hadn't seen her in some time, was greeted by Mrs Hudson in her typically brisk manner.
"Undoubtedly."
He can see Mary and Sherlock in a perfect, unobstructed view.
“Hot toddy, anyone? Made extra,” John says as he swaggers into the sitting room, holding up two steaming mugs of the stuff, and Sherlock forgoes thoughts of slick organs (for the most part) to turn his full attention to John.
“The last of the Canonical Five killings,” Sherlock and Molly finish in unison.
Sherlock sniffs. Sickly sweet melange of jasmine and orange. Baccarat Rouge cologne.
John squeezes a dollop of sun cream into his hand. “What d’you think, genius? Put your head back down.”
“You too.” She turns to Greg, Molly, and Janine. “Really so lovely meeting you all.”
Or, a novel idea: they could tell the truth.
When he looks back at Sherlock, he finds the man well-kissed and debauched, his pupils blown wide. “I could pretend to be her, if you’d like.”
John had rattled his painstakingly-built foundations, and he's not been able to revert back to that hardened version of himself he’d once been. And even when John had left him, had gone off and married Mary, he’d vowed to try and keep as much of John as he could.
“He’s still raw from the divorce, so he’s not going to make any overtures.”
Hurt flares within Sherlock’s chest at the intrusive thought, and he is overcome with the clawing need to be alone.
Sherlock decides to make the experience a bit easier, pulling his t-shirt over his head and flinging it aside.
Sherlock lets out a surprised little noise at the contact, remains limp with shock, but doesn’t back away. He allows himself to be kissed.
I closed a shaky hand around the jewelry in my pocket and withdrew it, holding it aloft to glitter underneath the slivers of sunlight that filtered through the tall trees.
“If you know me, you may know Dr John Watson,” Sherlock trips over himself to say, reverting back to English, swishing a hand in John’s direction.

Holmes suddenly pushed himself upright and faced me, mirroring my Indian-style sitting position. “Do you believe in any of this hoary balderdash?” he asked, sharp and vexed.
is marvelous.
. It’s not what they do.
John looks at the stretch of her bare back, a thin string doing its best to keep her top on and in place, sucks air between his teeth, and blows out a fortifying breath.
It’s a fair question.
John follows his train of thought without fault. “Yeah. I do.”
(Sherlock is astounded that they now have time.)
I ignored his sardonicism yet again. With confidence, I dragged the bow down the string, emitting a strident sound. My shoulders slumped, dejected. “It would appear I remember absolutely nothing.”
Together, they bring the pint away from Sherlock’s mouth.
“But the road is boring; this entire town is

, John.”
Sherlock cannot be alone any longer knowing that John exists.
“All things considered,” John says, “that wasn’t so bad, yeah? I’d say we’ve weathered the worst of it.” Sherlock can’t be so sure that’s true, but he allows John the comfort of foolish optimism. “Though. Uh. I see we’re both meant to sleep...there.”
smile
“You went under the mistletoe and someone’s gotta get kissed. According to the rules.”
Sherlock takes John’s hand and drags him behind the pub, shoving him against the wall and kissing him roughly before John reverses their positions, grabbing Sherlock by the lapels and spinning them around. John tugs at an end of Sherlock’s scarf to get it loose, unwrapping Sherlock until he has the freedom to nose and kiss Sherlock’s neck.
“Yes. Just beyond the gate behind you to your left. He’s been there for the better part of a half hour.”
John’s hand slides up Sherlock’s sternum until it’s resting between Sherlock’s collarbones.
Janine leans in, all conspiratorial tones. Her breath reeks of alcohol. “Am I stepping on any toes, then?”
They’re in a very good place, currently. How could they possibly revert back to the here and now if Sherlock doesn’t want him
“It was thought that the first person to cross the threshold of your home after midnight carrying gifts to represent prosperity, good health, warmth, and cheer would bring good fortune for the year. A handsome, tall, dark-haired man was favoured as the fortune-bringer, while fair-haired men--who evoked the image of Viking invaders--were thought to bring bad luck.”
John stares at it. Thinks of Sherlock in it. "Fuck it; I can think of far worse ways to die. Put it on."
“S’all good. I’m good,” John says a bit more brusquely than merited.
Sherlock darts his eyes to the right, to the left. “Not quite.” He swiftly removes his ID from his wallet, slides it across the counter. “Sherlock Holmes. I should be on the approved guardian list for Rosamund Watson.”
“I must say, Dr Watson,” Mrs Hudson said as she slowly ascended the seventeen steps to 221b. “I cannot imagine any prospective lodger being as interesting and queer as Mr Holmes. I will be bereft when he is gone.”
“Precisely,” Sherlock says, voice hardened to steel.
Greg appears with sniffling Rosie enfolded in his arms.
“Sure,” John scathes, pushing himself up to his feet. “But I was just reminded of how many times I’ve nearly lost you. Bit of a mood killer, that.”
Sherlock’s heart is pounding like thunder under John’s hand.
A minute passes in this manner, John displaying a frankly impressive slideshow of emotions on his face, and the mystery of it is too intriguing for Sherlock to resist. “What is it?”
“Oh, right, yeah. ‘Course. And thanks for the jumpers; none too subtle, that.”
His disguise screams money from his blue satin shirt to his tailored, crisp, white Savile Row trousers to his handmade oxfords--and even from his cologne to the product used to slick back his hair. Every item had been meticulously chosen by Sherlock; John would’ve been hopeless on his own. And he can't say he'd minded Sherlock's hovering--in the dressing room, when trying on clothes, Sherlock had rather liked smoothing his hands over the slippery luxury of John’s shirt, over the length and breadth of John’s chest. John had rather liked it too, so much so that he’d asked Sherlock to do it again back home at 221b,

“If I were someone who had grand ideas about fate, I would say that perhaps all of it was ‘meant to lead us here.’”
“Actually, I want to talk about something else first.” John tips his head at the bandage. “That? It should be a wake-up call. You need to be more careful.”
“Love you like this, after a case.” John turns to step in front of Sherlock, cups Sherlock’s cheek, runs his thumb over his jaw. “All--glowing.”
Sherlock hugs himself tightly.
“Daddy, who that?” Rosie asks, pointing unselfconsciously at Hafiz.
“Ah.”
"All right." Greg looks between the two of them. "Right-o. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. I’ll just…” He does a little wavering movement on his feet before turning around and walking off.
“Mate?” says the bartender.
Sherlock swipes a hand to indicate the drawing of the naked man. “I couldn’t create this.”
“Nauseating,” Sherlock murmurs.
John can’t fathom what he’ll do if he loses this.
The probability of crossing paths with another man like John--or even a man who is interested in Sherlock, by all meanings of the word
John catches Sherlock’s eye every so often. Other times, when Sherlock risks a glimpse, John has his eyes fixed on the road ahead, but he is smiling, an eye-crinkling affair. He knows Sherlock is looking.
(See the end of the chapter for
And John--he is a silent but sure presence at Sherlock’s side.

“We were discussing you and Molly.”
Sherlock has his back to Mary, now, and she places a hand on his undulating hip and fits behind him, pretends to grind up against him. Sherlock looks over his shoulder at her and smirks, and she throws back her head and laughs.
I could see that Holmes was no longer captivated by the beauty of the natural world, instead watching and waiting for my next move.
"I am trying to understand something," he said placidly. I pressed the palm of my hand to forehead and looked away, embarrassed to face Holmes dead on. He was going to tell me he could not fathom my actions, was going to ask me leave in the instant and return to London, I was certain of it, until he spoke again. "I am trying to understand why, precisely, you stopped."
“This is going to be your most cracking birthday to date,” Mummy says, practically euphoric. “Siger’s just put a kettle on. Come on, come in.”
John stops in his tracks and whirls around, more than a little offended. An unamused, hulking man is bounding in his direction. John wants to show the fucker that
Then, amidst laughter and buzzing chatter, comes a disembodied voice: “John Watson?”
Sherlock watches the next moment in slowed-down, dreamy time: John lowering his eyes to Sherlock's lips, turning his head, leaning in. The gentle press of John's lips against his. Sherlock's heart is pounding with mad abandon, surely John can hear it--it’s what John does to him; makes him feel too alive.
Sherlock’s heart squeezes tight.
Sherlock pulls her in toward his chest, resituates his hands so they’re tabletop-flat, bolstering her chest and stomach, and lifts her into the air.
“I do hope everything is to your tastes?”
“Yes, well,” Mycroft says, conceding it.
Sherlock cranes his neck and pinpoints the source immediately.
John kisses back with verve, meeting the sloppy and heady movements of Sherlock’s lips, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's back and pulling him close, their bodies pressed against each other in a flush line.
, but easier from a social perspective, I guess. Just like men are easier for a quick shag than women are.
Lestrade’s expression falls as he leans back jerkily, like Sherlock’s dealt him a blow. “
But John, as ever, bulldozes over the message. “Let me rephrase what I just said in a way you can understand: Can you piss off and let me enjoy this lovely day with my family in peace?”
“For the, um, gift.”
“Maybe you should pay attention to the road,” John says in a teasing tone.
“‘And you as well.’ It’s Latin.”
I will never know the apex of Sufi ecstasy, the devoted training, chanting and dervish whirls that culminate in a sensational feeling of
"Well, then. Are you ready to be amazed?"
“Hey, guv?” Wiggins yell-whispers at Sherlock. Sherlock pretends not to hear him, desultorily reaches over his shoulder and unshelves a book. “Guv!” Sherlock begins to read about the history of the Old Bailey. “
“Possibly...no."
“You need to tell her because she certainly won’t tell you. You’ve been miserable since November and have been dreadfully tiresome to be around sometimes, always
He’s not a good husband. He’s not a good father.
That was the first time I felt the love so viscerally that it threatened to claw its way out of the recesses of my body and make itself known to all.
Sherlock notices Wiggins lurking under the mistletoe, leering at Molly. He couldn’t possibly be more obvious unless he stamped his affections across his forehead.
Right. Greg.
John’s doing the fish out of water thing again with his mouth.
“Actually,” Sherlock says, holding up the opener and giving it a wave. “Mémé was Mummy’s mother. Not a Holmes.”
,” punches out of Sherlock, the register of his voice gone uncommonly high. “Oh, god.”
The back of his eyes prickling with welled emotion, Sherlock kisses John, speaks his heart against John’s lips, “You made me realise I was capable of falling in love.”
John sits up ramrod straight, on alert. “A pap?”
The cool water on his clammy skin is glorious, and he lets out a grateful sigh, his eyes lazily traveling across the room and hitting on a bar of soap on the sink. He glances at the bathtub’s soap holder. It’s empty.
“John, are you familiar with nerve agents?” Mycroft asks, apropos of nothing.
John barks out a laugh. “You’re really giving me mixed signals, here.”
“Hello.”
“No, we were well beyond reconciliation. I’d’ve never forgiven her for--Ro, leave Sherlock alone.”
When Mummy and Mrs Hudson run into each other on their ways to and from the kitchen, Sherlock winces preemptively.
"Welcome home, Watson,” said he.
“No worries,” Jamila says too-cheerily. “I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”
“...He got so very excited when Mycroft would come home for the hols; the day of, he’d be poised at the window beside himself with excitement. Like a puppy….”
I puzzled over her wistful--or perhaps morbid--statement as I replied, “There is no one quite like Mr Holmes, that’s for certain. But I suspect there are many years left in the old man just yet.”
It’d been fifteen years since Sherlock had last seen Mémé in person, and they’d spoken on the phone just eight times since, which is a shameful reality. If he’d
By virtue of Sherlock even considering making a romantic overture, it’s apparent that something in his perception of John has shifted. The probability of John’s receptivity may have increased, though Sherlock’s not sure when it had, exactly. It may have been increasing over the past two years, and may have catapulted to great heights this past week.
My breath caught at the declaration. “I would like nothing more than to be with you, Holmes,” I said impassionedly.
“Or…,” John says distractedly, watching Sherlock examine himself in the full-length mirror. “Or your princess.”
John huffs out an uncomfortable laugh, but feels a surge of affection for the man. “Christ, well, what the hell can I say to that?”
Sherlock has the crazed thought to jump into the hole with his grandmother.
Sherlock is waiting for him on the pitch just in front of the bleachers. He looks like he wants to reach out for John, his arm stuttering forward, but decides against it. “Hospital?”
Sherlock has an arch smile ghosting his lips as he turns his head. John doesn't budge, and they end up face to face, a hair's breadth apart, for a heart-hammering moment--suspended in time.
“Doesn’t mean your Mum isn’t genuinely grieving. I was devastated when Mary was--,” Sherlock flinches, “when she died.” Mary is always an awkward topic of conversation, so they don’t often invoke her name. Nor do they speak of everything that came shortly After. “But my feelings for her in life were complicated, to say the least.”
It’s quiet for a moment, the two of them watching each other blankly.
“Helped a bit.”
“How incisive of you, Mummy,” Sherlock says. “I can’t think of anything I’d like to know
John raises his mug, locking eyes with Sherlock and giving him a wink.
do it. So he does it, lightning quick: he presses his index and middle fingers to his lips, makes an idiotic kissing sound only he can hear, and sends it off Sherlock’s way.
I had not wanted to dredge up matrimonial thoughts, but it had been weighing so heavily on my mind that evening that it was only a matter of time until I could no longer carry it.
and says, “Yeah, of course. Of course I do. I’d live with you anywhere.”
“‘Most gifted’ is exceedingly generous.”
It passes the time, for a short while.
“Yeah, come on, Sherlock,” John says huskily, muffled, the vibrations of his deepened voice reverberating through Sherlock’s body. “Ride my face.”
Half-sedate with the euphoria engendered by his ministrations, I slurred a, “Please, yes, my god, yes. Have you an aid?”
at all. He doesn’t know if Sherlock will turn him down or embrace him--well, embrace quite a lot more of him. Embrace
Sherlock unearths the book he’d tucked away in the sofa cushion for exactly this kind of mind-numbingly dull occasion, flicks on a lamp, and attempts to read about Cornish folklore.
“Yeah,” John says, watching Sherlock’s arse move on him in a kind of drunken stupor, “give it to me.”
Sherlock stares down at it, in awe.
Sherlock sidesteps and sprints down the hall to his bedroom, shutting the door. He sits on his bed and buries his face in his hands, letting out a loud growl of frustration.
He had done everything wrong with Victor, had wanted too much too fast, was much too self-focussed and needy. He cannot do everything wrong with John.
“Yes, thank you. We’re pleased. As well. About the--us.”
“Can I talk to you outside?” John says, voice taut.
“Maybe you did, when he was dead. But not anymore.”
“You are a fine specimen of man, John,” Holmes said wonderingly as he looked at the hand that remained on my hip, then shifted his line of sight slightly eastward and decidedly centre from my hip, which made my body hot with desire.
He’d dismissed it as treacly nonsense, as humankind's death knell for rationality.
“Nope,” John cuts in, hauling himself to his foot. “I’m good.”
John looks up at Sherlock and flashes a smile that doesn’t quite meet his eyes.
There is anger, of course, but there is something else, something equally painful but invisible, like embers from a roaring beach bonfire that'd been carelessly shoved under cool sand. Not doused, as in proper form. Something John prefers to keep buried.
Turning his head, he finds John looking in his direction, but his eyes are enshrouded in mystery behind his sunglasses. He moves closer to Sherlock, props up on his side, leaning on an elbow. He’s unhurried and deliberate as he takes off his sunglasses, places them onto the blanket beneath them.
It’s another oppressively hot day, and 221 is a building of Georgian times, ill-equipped for staple modern fixtures like air cons, so all Sherlock can do for relief is lie partly clothed on the sofa in the near-dark of their sitting room, his stringy hair pushed back off his forehead by a stretchy headband sprouting three tiny roses (pilfered from Rosie’s headwear collection), and bask in the weak breeze of an old fan stacked atop a tower of books on the coffee table.
“Fuck no. Just off me at 85. Good age to go, that.”
Lestrade makes a grand show of looking around. “Am I on another planet? Is Sherlock bloody Holmes giving me relationship advice?”
The cartoonish moustache, the laughable French accent, and now look at him--so fucking
Their chests rise and fall against each other in one entwined breath, and Sherlock wishes it were possible to burrow into John’s skin, his bones, his cells.
Sherlock’s shirt. (And trousers and pants.)
“Just like that?”
John takes the sketches and gives them all a cursory glance before placing them aside. “She seemed like an incredible woman. So much talent.”
John’s hand drapes over Sherlock’s where it lies flat on the railing.
Sherlock slams the book closed and sighs hugely. “What is it, Wiggins?”
He bobs his head fast, licks and lavishes, imprinting the particular and musky taste of John to the annals of his memory--then swaps his mouth for his hand so they can kiss. From John’s lips, Sherlock can taste earthiness (himself) and the bitterness of John’s pre-come, and they kiss and kiss, sloppy and undignified and frenetic, until John is panting and moaning into Sherlock’s mouth, canting his hips up into Sherlock’s tight fist, and Sherlock thinks he’ll never tire of taking John apart like this.
John’s hand rips out of Sherlock’s, and the two of them whirl around toward the wibbly voice.
He must pace himself, let John lead. He will not be presumptuous. He’d done that in the past, and it had been a mistake.
. Alcoholic; I could see it in her eyes, her fingernails, her skin.”
Sherlock hooks an arm around John’s leg, holding onto it for dear life as he’s pulled backwards by the tide. “John,” he croaks theatrically. “Don’t let it get me.”
“I am relaxed,” Sherlock says, though not as haughtily as he would’ve liked.
Molly’s face flushes beet red, and she looks over at Sherlock again, the words
Sherlock grabs John’s hand, squeezes. “You won’t ever lose me. I can promise you that.”
Holmes was still vibrating with intensity. “Do elaborate.”
“Hot,” Dad says, unfortunately, aloud.
“Nerve agents,” Mycroft says with cutting impatience. “Chemical weapons.”
Rosie plops onto her knees and softly places a hand to fur. Constance tumbles inelegantly onto her back, and Rosie gives the dog what she wants, strokes her stomach.
Apparently, Sherlock had not clarified to this woman that he isn’t, in fact, Rosie’s parent. She had gone on to assume that he is not only Rosie’s father, but that John is also Rosie’s father. Hence Rosie and Sherlock having an attachment to John that could merit them being considered, Sherlock cringes internally at the word,
Every time Sherlock glances across the cab, he finds John still and remote, eyes unseeingly glued to the window, hands folded in his lap.
The room has fallen silent.
Last year, there hadn’t been a party; they’d opted to have the celebration at Sherlock’s parents’s house on Christmas Day. That Christmas Eve had been very sombre at 221b, as it had been the first Christmas Eve that Sherlock had spent without John since they’d shared the flat (not counting the years he was quite literally dead to the world). It’s embarrassing, how miserable Sherlock had been. Christmas Eve is just another day, no different than any other day of the year, or at least it should’ve felt that way. Yet he’d never felt so alone.
John flickers his eyes from side to side. “Uh...yes? Bit soon to add a third, no?”
At least, if anything, it can be misconstrued for a kiss to a god; a plea to win the game. A call for divine intervention.
“We’ve got fans,” John says tightly, staring darkly ahead.
Sherlock thinks bitterly.

John clasps the offered hand and allows himself to be hoisted up onto his good foot with a grunt. “Fine.” He tests his weight on the sprained ankle and hisses through his teeth. It's definitely a sprain, probably a partly ruptured ligament. “It’s just a sprain.”
Holmes shrugged. “Life goes on.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, because the answer will always be yes.
Mary hadn’t flinched.
“Your grandmum?”
“Yes. I know.”
Much to Sherlock’s horror, the twinkle in Mummy’s eye has become a constellation of
Earlier this week, John, Rosie, and Mrs Hudson had stopped by to help decorate the tree and, since then, Mrs Hudson has been a fixture of the sitting room, turning up like clockwork to add more tinsel, fairy lights, ribbons, twee figurines, etcetera.
,” Holmes said into my jaw, where he had been dotting kisses.
And with that look, if John hadn't know any better, if he'd been a third-party watching their little scene play out from afar, he'd say that Sherlock's target, the heinous criminal he was after, was
meant to do?”
“Keep that in mind when you’re out there kissing them. It’ll do wonders for your psyche.”
“A kiss,” John repeats flatly.
John sighs raggedly and hangs his head. “Here we go.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, sitting down beside John and leaning back on his hands, the stone railing hot to the touch. “Fishing for compliments? How unlike you.”
,” Sherlock says in Korean, the woman's eyes widening. “
Ground control to Major Tom?”
That self-imposed, self-involved isolation had made him forget about the very few people who’d actually
And when he musters the courage to turn his head, John isn’t even looking at him, is boring a stare into Mémé’s headstone with his jaw set tight. It strikes a perplexing note of discord, John’s tense comportment against their gently clasped hands but, then again, John is naturally, exceptionally perplexing.
“Like I said,” John says, leaning back into Sherlock’s chest, a hand coming to rest atop Sherlock’s interlocked arms around his waist. “I’m not going anywhere.”
,” Sherlock talks over her. “Lestrade, a word?”
“Quite. Business is booming,” Sherlock says.
John relents without a fight (Sherlock notes smugly) and sets to pushing the passenger seat forward while Sherlock shucks off his trousers and pants, hitting his elbow hard on the door handle in the process, and crowds back against the door, spreading his legs, right foot planted on the seat and left foot on the floor.
The Dating Killer case had involved a man who murdered closeted gay and bisexual men, setting up the murders to look like they’d been commited by a woman’s hand. Lip prints had been found at each victim’s flats, deliberately placed to mislead the Yard as to the sex of the killer.
John slides both hands up the sides of Sherlock’s thighs, fingers combing through dark strands of hair, until the tips of his fingers meet the leg hem of Sherlock’s boxer-briefs. Sherlock watches raptly as John slips his index and middle-fingers beneath the elastic, and when John’s fingers tangle in coarse hair and nudge at Sherlock’s cock, Sherlock’s cock twitches enthusiastically, and his legs clamp tight on John, locking him in.
Feeling awkward, Sherlock begins to backpedal, “That is, I mean--”
“Oi!” Janine protests, but Sherlock shuts and locks the door on her.
“Is that okay? Do you not want me to talk to you like that?”
Rosie whimpers.
under Mrs Hudson’s tutelage.”
“Sell it, then.”
“We left you alone with him, did he say something? It’s his MO, after all, to be a prick. I’ll knock his bloody block off if he did.”
. Their proximity had been...new. They’d never, in the many years they’ve been friends, been so intimately close, and all at once it’d become clear John had been starving for it. That day at 221b, he had felt a powerful pull for them to be even closer yet, dangerous, stray thoughts threatening to become action, but had reasoned and decided, quite judiciously, that the point had been to learn how to ballroom dance for his damn wedding to Mary, and unequivocally
“John,” Lestrade placates grimly.
And there it is. The truth, laid out bare.
Sherlock watches a button pop open on the man’s wrinkled button-down, exposing a triangle of undershirt. The woman pats the man’s potbelly, laughing.
When we at last parted to breathe, Holmes got to his knees and swept aside his dressing-gown to throw a leg over my lap and sit astride me. I fell to my back and brought him down with me and we continued to kiss--open-mouthed and hungry. For a moment, he hovered above me on all fours, and I reached up to frame his angular, intelligent face as he looked down at me with shining eyes and kiss-swollen lips.
“Don’t nauseate me with your fresh affections,” Mycroft spits out, reaching behind the chair to extract a manila envelope. He holds it out at arm’s length and does not bother to stand. “Happy Birthday.”
He should tell Mary.
“I am aware,” Sherlock says haltingly.
“Today,” she begins with booming gravitas, as if delivering a speech to a full amphitheatre, “we celebrate you, my darling.” She indicates Sherlock with her drink. “I can’t think of anyone more deserving of praise. Your father and I are so proud of all you’ve done for the world.”
Wiggins. Creatively, too.
This is the very last thing Sherlock expects to hear--now, or at all. “Oh.”
Sherlock wonders with creeping unease if what he’s said has gone too far. They are not demonstrative with each other, as a rule, but there’s just something about this damn day that’s made Sherlock disturbingly
“Sorry, am I that bad of a kisser? Because I’ve never had any complaints.”
"Pain level?" Sherlock asks, trailing his fingers up and down John's ribs in a steady caress.
Until he hears the faint creak of the stairs.
They stare at each other for a heartbeat before John reaches out for Sherlock’s sunglasses. Stops. “Um. Mind if I...?”
John’s hand slides up Sherlock’s neck this time, cups Sherlock’s cheek as they kiss, small movements of lips that rapidly become wide-mouthed and desperate. John flings a part of the blanket over their heads, which isn’t quite putting them under the cover of privacy, makes what they’re doing even more obvious (and hotter, in the literal sense [and perhaps the metaphorical sense]), even if the particulars are obscured. Soon, there are tiny whining noises, tongues against tongues, and Sherlock is sucking John’s bottom lip into his mouth--
“Now, hang on a second,” John says.
“Sherlock,” John says, and it is a poor excuse for a reproach, so Sherlock frees the belt fully from its loops, slides down the zip after a couple of failed attempts, and shoves his hand into John’s pants to wrap around his cock: hard as a rod, silky, and hot.
Sherlock nudges his face into John’s neck, and John runs a hand up to rake through Sherlock’s hair. “Shocking news, to be sure.”
“Tradition,” I affirmed.
“Not absurd. Practical; preemptive. Because if we don’t leave now, someone will make us leave for
been tetchy with Jamila since day one.”
I hesitated perhaps a moment too long, because Holmes said pawkily, "Please, do tone down your enthusiasm."
“Maybe it's about time we get you something new," John says.
Sherlock shoves the deed back into its folder and holds it under Mycroft’s nose. “I don’t want this,” he says, all bravado. “You take it.”
