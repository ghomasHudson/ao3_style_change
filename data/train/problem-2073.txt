John’s text does take a bit longer to come, and by the time it does, Sherlock is nearly coiled like a spring in anxiety.
John instantly felt Sherlock tense under his hand, actually felt his pulse speed up. Saw his pupils contract.
“Sherlock!” he’d exclaim. “Is that you?! Is that really you?” He might give Sherlock a light shove, but part of Sherlock expected to feel John’s strong hands clamp down on his shoulders, squeezing briefly before maybe being pulled into a hug. “Where have you been, you mad bastard?” he’d demand, thumping his back with his fist, like he’d done that one time they’d encountered the American soldier he’d served with and greeted as an old friend.
“You wanker,” John laughed, delighted, kissing him again and pulling him into a hug. He felt Sherlock’s fingers digging into his own back and shoulders, felt that curly-haired head plant itself on his shoulder, felt Sherlock’s back expand in an enormous sigh.
Sherlock freezes, mouth open, ready to retort. After a moment, John looks up from his laptop and smiles at him.
“I loved her,” he said quietly. “I did. But I shouldn’t have been married to her. But then I wouldn’t have Rosie. So it couldn’t have been a mistake. It just…”
Letting go of the wineglass and crossing his arms in what he knew was a defensive posture, but he simply couldn’t help it, John took a deep breath. “Did you tell her?”
John opens the door and stares. His eyes take in Sherlock’s clothes to his face. His lips part in sympathy, but he says: “Didn’t realize you swam to the island.”
“I will never lie to you again, John,” Sherlock cut in, sitting up straight, his eyes burning into John’s across from him. “Never. I had no choice, then. I had to…” John saw Sherlock’s throat bob as he paused. He lifted his glass and took a large drink from his glass, his throat bobbing again. He lowered the glass, cradling it in his lap again. “There were three snipers. Moriarty had three snipers. Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, you.”
He’s soaking wet before he feels his phone vibrating continuously in his pocket. When he pulls it out, he sees a series of texts he just now receives, as his phone gains reception again.
And Sherlock would admit (with the help of the brandy) that he did not enjoy most of his time away. That often, he had been…
“Will take a while to dry those clothes,” John murmurs. “Best stay here for the night. This is the most content Rosie has been all day, so you’re not allowed to leave.”
“Why… I’ve got all night!” John would declare, tossing his napkin onto the table and gesturing to the restaurant’s exit. They’d stroll right past the faceless figure of John’s “date”, but John wouldn’t notice because he’d be gazing at Sherlock, eyes sparkling, smile wide with delight, and Sherlock would stop outside the restaurant, John by his side, his arm brushing Sherlock’s.
When John’s eyes finally found Sherlock and locked on him, Sherlock felt like his joints had frozen. He couldn’t move. It was unlike anything he’d ever experienced. Leave it to John Watson to immobilize Sherlock Holmes.
“I was so glad to have you back, and thought maybe I could have a semblance of our life together, because living with you here was… they were some of the best years of my life. But it also felt unfair to Mary. We’d been forming our own lives together. And so… I grew to resent her. Because I felt like I
When they land in London and Mycroft drives his parents home, Sherlock stands in the rain for several more minutes, staring after the car, yet not seeing anything.
Sherlock watched him silently, half his face in darkness, the other cast in the golden glow of the fire, impassive and expressionless. Just watching. Listening.
Until two days ago, when he’d stayed sober with Sherlock, rather than flee back to his house to drown his grief. Instead, he’d lit himself on fire by baring his soul, and Sherlock had slowly doused the flames with his acceptance and love.
“Oh John, I couldn’t possibly explain it all now,” Sherlock would feign indifference and nonchalance. He’d heave a great sigh and adopt a tired, faraway look. “So many cities, so many idiots all over the world. Really, it would take hours and hours to explain.” And he’d wink.
“Chinese?” Sherlock would suggest. John would certainly appreciate that. He had appreciated that before.
John also seemed frozen as he stared at Sherlock. He seemed to just stop. He wasn’t breathing. It felt like ten seconds passed where John stared at Sherlock, and Sherlock stared back, neither of them moving.
“Thank you,” John said, touched. He glanced at Sherlock, who watched John with a piercing gaze. “A good meal sounds fantastic right about now.”
The rest of the evening flew by in a haze of wine and laughter, and after so many months of crushing grief and pain and loneliness and hopelessness, he felt ten years younger, more relaxed and contented than he could remember being in a long time. Sherlock regaled him of stories when he had rubbed catnip all over Mycroft’s new shoes and bag so that when he turned up at Parliament on his first day as an intern, he had been followed by half of the city’s stray cats. John’s eyes were watering with mirth, as were Sherlock’s as he went on to tell about the day Lestrade had been kidnapped by Mycroft, back when Sherlock started working for the Met, and Lestrade was twitchy, jumpy, and snapped at everyone for the rest of the day.
After a while, when their laughs were muffled and exhaled through their noses and around their grinning kisses, John pulled back a bit, his hand on Sherlock’s neck, foreheads pressed together again. “You know, that first night at Angelo’s, I really was trying to figure you out. See whether you might be interested.”
“I wouldn’t call myself married to my work these days.” Sherlock frowned at his wine glass as he slowly turned it. John stared, hypnotized, at the gently swaying liquid in the glass barely slosh at Sherlock’s gentle movements. “That would make me a rubbish godfather, wouldn’t it?”
Sherlock stares and stares. Obviously, this has taken John some liquid courage. But… he hopes Sherlock hasn’t been scared off, which means he doesn’t want Sherlock to leave! Sherlock doesn’t hesitate to reply.
The warmth of John’s hand lays on Sherlock’s forehead, smoothing the hair back in soft, small, repetitive motions that make Sherlock swallow hard and keep his eyes closed, breathing through the burning in his nose.
John wasn’t sure where his train of thought was taking him. Once Angelo left, he pressed on, “She likes you. She’s still texting you, after all these years. Why not give it a go with her?”
And on and on it went. By the time John arrives home with two bags of takeaway, he’s laughing at the text Sherlock had just sent about Mycroft’s sleeping habits, and when they sit down in their respective chairs, eating Pad Thai out of the box and arguing over the benefits of sleeping on the back versus on the side, John’s laugh-crinkled eyes remain firmly locked with Sherlock’s.
“Christ, I hadn’t realized the time,” John said, checking his watch. “I told the sitter I’d be out till midnight.”
But then John ducked his head, and to Sherlock’s horror it sounded like he was sobbing, and when John lifted his head tears were indeed streaming down his red face, but he was grinning and it didn’t sound like sobs, it sounded like his laughter, his wonderful bubble of laughter. Sherlock was so relieved, he felt his face split into a grin, and he joined in, his chest releasing a tension he never realized he had, and he bowed his head, laughing along with John, who leaned forward wearily and rested his forehead on Sherlock’s collarbone. Without realizing it or meaning to, Sherlock found himself ducking his head down and brushing his lips over John’s soft, clean hair. John didn’t pull away, and Sherlock closed his eyes, shoulders sagging in relief. They stayed there, entwined and leaning together, for a long, long time.
John’s smile faded. He turned his head slightly to look at the fire burning, soft and warm and glowing. He took another sip of the whiskey, relishing in the burn as it made its way through his body.
"Cuddling," John informs him, typing away on his laptop, one painful key at a time. "The colloquial term is cuddling."
John turned to kiss Sherlock’s ear, and Sherlock’s arms tightened around him. After several moments, he pulled back, leaning down to plant a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s parted lips. Knees hurting from so much kneeling, John sat back on his heels while Sherlock straightened up in his chair. Both of John’s hands were grasped in each of Sherlock’s, resting on his knees.
Although… that wasn’t quite true anymore, for Sherlock. John was nearly certain of that. Sherlock was strong, physically. He could take care of himself. John had seen him nearly snap Mycroft’s arm off when high as a kite. And yet… John’s still-bruised knuckles and Sherlock’s stitched face were proof that Sherlock had chosen not to fight back at the morgue. He’d accepted John’s anger. Welcomed it.
“It was good to see her,” Sherlock murmured, turn his wine glass slowly on the tablecloth, his long, pale fingers twisting the stem.
Sherlock made an aborted movement, as if to take a sip of his whiskey, but couldn’t quite find the strength to bring the glass to his lips, so instead cradled it on his lap. He seemed unable to look at John.
Sherlock doesn’t realize he’s grinning until it starts to make his cheeks ache. He slumps down on the sofa, gazing at the soft glow of his phone before it beeps again.
Sherlock was quiet while John watched him, waiting. After a long moment, Sherlock finally said, “I am glad that you are okay right now.”
Visiting his sister in Sherrinford is never easy. The first time, with his parents in tow, is nearly unbearable.
“Sherlock, Doctor Watson,” Angelo greeted, barely containing his glee. “So wonderful to have you back, it’s been far too long.” His grin sobered, and he bowed his head slightly toward John. “I did hear about Mrs. Watson, Doctor, and let me say that I am so…
He would whip off the glasses and “Surprise!” and John would do a double take. His mouth would drop open in shock, Sherlock would barely be able to contain his grin, and John would leap to his feet in delight.
Then John’s chest and shoulders deflated, his jaw dropping as the air rushed from his lungs, then was immediately sucked back in. His hand… the one with the tremor… came up to his mouth briefly, then dropped back to his side in a fist. And his eyes, still locked on Sherlock, went wide then slack then tense, and even Sherlock, sociopath that he tried to be, could read the shock, disbelief, relief, joy, confusion, anger, hurt, and pride in them.
Why would John be avoiding Sherlock, if not in reaction to having wrapped himself around his flatmate in his sleep?
“I suppose I do,” Sherlock said, taking another sip of wine. John noticed it was a rather long sip. “She’s interesting. Clever. One of the few not-boring people on the planet. And I feel sorry for her. She’s… solitary. In a way I… used to want to be. At one time
“Lovers,” Sherlock scoffs. After a moment, his eyes fly open. “Is that what you’re afraid of? That we would now be classified as lovers?”
Sherlock’s eyes closed, leaning into both the hand and the kiss. “Good night, John,” he breathed when the kiss ended.
He watched John’s head lift, look straight ahead of him. His head turned slowly… slowly to the right, over his shoulder, and good heavens, he must be doing this on purpose, being so unbearably slow so as to drive Sherlock insane, to force Sherlock to stride up to the man and grab him by the shoulders and scream in his face “Look at me, John, I’m not dead!”
John pulled on his coat, and when he turned to exchange a small smile with Sherlock. As he was leaving, he turned briefly to see Sherlock running slightly shaking fingers over his own lips, staring at John’s chair.
“Let me guess,” John said, pulling his jacket off and hanging it on the back of his chair. “Lestrade hasn’t caved.”
“Right,” John agreed. “Also… our table doesn’t have a candle.” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock look up from the menu.
to be with her, when really…” John paused, and shook his head, looking down at his glass. “Mary helped me with my grief after you left. Made me feel I could be happy again. And then you came back, and I wasn’t happy with just Mary, and then I couldn’t trust her. And for some reason… some godforsaken, nonsense,
And John would have had enough brandy that his delight at having Sherlock back again would turn into that same attraction he’d felt and tried to hide since that first day.
“Going for a pint with Greg,” he called over his shoulder while practically fleeing down the steps, and Sherlock had to suppress the urge to launch off the couch after him. Where had that urge come from? Sherlock settles back on the couch, fingertips together against his lips, and thinks.
was fun. It was a would-be serial killer, and Angelo was the wrong suspect. That part’s all boring. No no, the actual case itself was wonderful!” And Sherlock regaled the tale to John while the candle glowed lower, through one more glass of wine each while Angelo boxed up their leftover food, and the outside grew dark and one by one the restaurant patrons all started leaving, until a particularly loud laughing fit made John realize that they were one of the few people left dining.
“Yes, but I’d got snot and tears all over your dressing gown, and the next day Rosie vomited all over you. So I’m celebrating until one day goes by where your dressing gown isn’t ruined by a Watson.”
And Sherlock would say that the Work was not all that mattered anymore. That there were other things… a person… that turned out to be quite as important…
Mummy cries when she sees her little girl, no longer little, yet just as fragile. True to Mycroft’s words, Eurus is unresponsive. Unreachable. A body with no soul. No eye contact, no movements, no signs of life.
“Because I don’t want to, John,” Sherlock sighed. “There are other people I’d prefer to spend my time with. More to the point, I doubt we’d make it a week in each other’s company before one of us attempted to murder the other.” He picked up a fork, and prodded at his risotto half-heartedly. “I think she’s clever.”
“She thought we were dating!” Sherlock finally snaps. “She thought we were in love, otherwise she’d never have let me into Magnussem’s office! My… cuddling with her furthered her romantic feelings. But not mine!” Sherlock continues, furiously. “It didn’t work on me! I don’t work that way, John!”
And then John was walking over to him. Slow at first, then long, purposeful strides, and Sherlock could not walk away, nor could he think of anything clever or disdainful to say, and John’s fists were clenched at his sides, his jaw clenched, eyes hard and focused, and he was right in front of Sherlock, drawing his left fist back, and Sherlock, unblinking and unwavering, still looking into John’s blazing eyes, prepared for the punch…
Sherlock’s nose healed and the bitterness that John held within himself towards his best friend faded. Eventually, as it drew closer to John’s wedding, the retired army doctor decided that it was best to ask Sherlock to be his best man when the other wasn’t distracted by a case, or fiddling with something.
“I want you to be my best man, Sherlock. I would rather spend my wedding day, the happiest day of my life-- and don’t say it, because, yes, it is. I would rather spend that day with the two people I love and care about most in the entire world. So, Mary Morstan…. And….”
Just before their lips met, Sherlock woke up in his bed, alone, and staring at the ceiling. It was always this dream, in the countdown to John’s wedding. It was always John reciprocating Sherlock’s heavily buried feelings for his friend. Something Sherlock wanted, but could never admit to either of them that they did, not to mention John made it blatantly clear that he wasn’t gay. The detective had no reason to think otherwise, besides how he kept his appearance. He could argue a point of feeling some form of… tension between them from time to time when they locked eyes for long periods of time, or came home from a successful case, but nothing ever came of those moments. It burned Sherlock inside to look at so many wasted opportunities, but he would rather repress himself until the day he died rather than ruin his friendship with John Watson. His only proper friend, the only one who, despite it all, understood Sherlock on a level he felt no one else was capable.
“Sink it is!” He growled, moving into the kitchen and putting what was left of Sherlock’s stash into the sink, turning on the tap and washing most of it down. He put the cigarettes in his own pocket and turned to face Sherlock. “You are an idiot, Sherlock Holmes. A bloody idiot and selfish man. You can’t let me be happy for a second if you aren’t part of the reason I am, can you? You can’t be happy for Mary and I.”
“John, what are you doing here? It’s very late and Mary is very pregnant… I don’t believe you should take chances in not being there for her when sh--”
This one got a bit more into the angst realm. I figured the longing of Sherlock Holmes would be a somewhat interesting concept to play off of while the detective tries to come to terms with his jealousy of Mary.
“Do you think this is a bloody game?! Do you?! I drove her in the middle. Of. The. Night!” He snarled, each word punctuated by a hit to a now slumped Sherlock. “I care about you, but you can’t keep doing this to me! You can’t keep treating me like rubbish and expect me to want to stick around!”
Sherlock stared blankly at John for a long while, eyes unblinking and head inclined the slightest bit down to meet John’s gaze entirely. “.. Yes…” He nodded some, averting his eyes for a moment before capturing the other man’s gaze again.  The other man sighed and withdrew his hands into his lap, leaning back in the kitchen chair and refocusing his gaze.
Sherlock managed to get to his feet, tending to his now busted lip with the corner of a nearby napkin. He had thought, in his clever little brain, that John would be simply ecstatic to see him, but he supposed he couldn’t be right about absolutely everything. Wasn’t that what normal people did? Jump for joy at the reveal of some fascinating miracle? He wasn’t certain, but he hadn’t exactly imagined his shorter friend would try to strangle him in the middle of a restaurant.
It always had been, and always would be until the day John Watson was put in the ground. Two years of thinking that his best friend had killed himself, and it was finally revealed to him that Sherlock, had in fact, not died. He hadn’t hit the ground at all. Two whole years of feeling lost and feeling utterly inadequate as friend, and the cheeky bastard had the audacity to show himself to John in the middle of a date -- No, his goddamn proposal to Mary.
Since it's a holiday, I've been cranking out chapters pretty quickly with the free time I have. This one is going to ease the angst a bit towards the end, but only briefly. This chapter is going to be a rough ride to the end of it so buckle up D:
That night had given him a busted lip and a bloody nose, but as the night wound down, he knew that John was slowly forgiving him. Focusing more on the relief of knowing that Sherlock was alive rather than being angry for not knowing for so long. Though, John wasn’t entirely certain how keen he would be on romping around London with Sherlock again on cases. He had a future to think about, a future with Mary. The opportunity for a normal life and he would not let Sherlock Holmes take that from him, not this time.
His speech dragged on for a ridiculously long amount of time, most of it being interluded by some ‘clever’ remark about his views on something. “Regardless, I must say in the position of my best friend, John is the wisest and most courageous man that I have ever known. He has saved my life on several occasions, and while I may solve the cases, he always remembers to save the lives involved. He is a kind and selfless man, though I may not openly admit that often, and he is not entirely an idiot.” He paused for the chuckle from the crowd. “He is a man of a much higher resolve than I myself can say. For what he lacks in deductive ability, he makes up for in his ever present need to take care of those around him and he has earned my highest respect in doing just that.”
Sherlock managed to double over as John released his arm, vomiting onto the floor beneath him on all fours. John cursed rather loudly and the last thing that Sherlock heard was an echoing call of his name as he slowly sank into the blackness pulling at the edges of his vision.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, opening his mouth and closing it again, pressing his lips into a thin line before he answered John, listing off what all he had taken and how much. He also produced a handwritten list, the one Mycroft had always asked him to write when he used.
Sherlock flinched and hung his head again. John threw open the door to Sherlock’s room so hard that the handle slammed into the wall behind it and bounced back forward again. John started ripping through Sherlock’s things to find any of the drugs left in the flat, anything Sherlock could use to get high. He even took the pack of cigarettes he had been hiding under his mattress. When John moved to the bathroom, Sherlock stood in front of the door.
“John, don’t. Stop! Stop.” He managed, spreading his arms out over the wall and John let out a grunt of frustration.
After two weeks, Sherlock walked out of the hospital with a bandage over the bridge of his nose and stitches in a few parts of his face. John had given him a decently dark shiner and Sherlock knew full-heartedly he deserved what he got. He had been hateful, and irritable thanks to all of the drugs in his system, but now he had time to clear his head, without the influence of drugs.
Sherlock watched John walk into the sitting room and lost the shred of consciousness he had been holding onto so desperately for the last few moments.
Sherlock felt absolutely pathetic as he hailed a cab back to the flat on Baker Street. He felt like he had reached a new low in his life that he had never even been capable of, especially since he didn’t even know the man’s name that he just allowed himself to be fucked into a mattress by.
When John learns of Mary's true identity, and what it is that she used to do for a living, he's conflicted with how that will effect his life long term.
With a few more exchanges of jokes and conversation, Sherlock left the venue, pulling his coat collar up around his face and neck as he walked towards the street to hail a cab. On the cab ride home, his mind raced with angry thoughts towards Mary, angry thoughts towards the fact he seemed to be slowly losing the relationship he had established with John. Though it may not have been as intimate as Sherlock wanted it to be, he still hated how much John’s actions towards Sherlock had changed when Mary came into the picture.
John looked at Sherlock, then to Mary, then back to Sherlock, looking a bit awestruck by Sherlock misspeaking. “What in the hell do you mean, Sherlock?”
Sherlock ground his teeth together. It was his turn to be pissed off. “You’re the one who abandoned me for her!”
He sat his phone on his desk and sat down in his armchair, crossing his legs and lifted his arms, placing his palms and outstretched fingers together. He tilted his head back and closed his eyes, pressing the tips of his middle fingers just against the soft flesh of his chin. It didn’t take long for him to sink into his mind palace and continue his dream from earlier, imaging his rosy cheeked John Watson mere inches from his lips.
“I’m… Sorry, John. I-I don’t want… I don’t want to die.” He said softly, tears starting to form in his eyes.
At that, John froze and stared at Sherlock for a long time. The tensing of John’s muscles made Sherlock stop in his tracks with his snarky comment. He moved across the room faster than the detective had thought, his drug fogged brain having a difficult time keeping up. That’s when John Watson hit him. He hit him once and grabbed the front of his shirt again, knuckles connecting to his jaw, then the second hit connected to his check.
“Look, Sherlock, I know that I’m asking a lot of you, but I… It means a lot to me that you’re still going to be there. I don’t make many friends easily, you knew that from the day I walked into that lab, and having you back is…” He puffed his cheeks out a bit as he blew a deep breath from his lungs. “It’s a relief to have my best friend back. You gave me a miracle, like I asked for.”
When Sherlock moved to go sit beside of John again, the shorter man stood up and pulled him into a tight hug, giving him a few pats on the back.
Sherlock woke under the bright lights of a hospital room, squinting against the pain that stung in his eyes. His eyes adjusted to the assaulting brightness and his first instinct was to look towards the chair by his bedside. It was empty, save for an old aluminum walking cane leaned against the chair back. He sighed softly and adjusted his head to stare at the ceiling and think.
“John Hamish Watson…” Sherlock began, standing in his best suit in the center of circular tables that held each of John and Mary’s wedding guests. Faces he knew, those he considered friends, or at least acquaintances, or strangers Sherlock had never seen before. He turned slowly to look back towards the table at the head of the hall and raise his glass a bit, inclining his head towards the doctor. “John Watson has been my best friend for many years, though I was never exactly accustomed to the idea of being ‘best friends’ with someone. I do not have many friends, as most of the people sitting in this room can attest to. I never have. I find human interaction generally exhausting and pointless if unnecessary. Or I used to, rather, but John has taught me the importance of having friends and connections. Today, you are marrying the woman that means the most to you, and I am honoured to be considered the secondary in your life to your beautiful wife.”
They were kicked out of two other restaurants in Sherlock’s attempt to explain how and why he disappeared for so long. John was his closest friend, and he had to, in his own way, make sure that the other was unaware of his living situation. He had managed to go deep undercover and expose quite a few underground crime rings, not to mention track down most of Moriarty’s crime syndicate. He had been a busy man over those two years, and didn’t exactly have a chance to communicate with John that he had lived and apologize for lying to him.
Sherlock has taken interest in a case that could quite possibly kill him to keep his mind distracted from his newfound feelings of jealousy and his hateful dreams that he believes could never be reality. He also takes to making his longings a bit more realistic.
“Ah, yes. Yes, John. Of course I’ll be your best man.” He nodded, picking up his cup from the table top and taking a sip from it. He saw John make a face and squint up at the other a bit in concern. Sherlock looked down just as an eyeball floated to the surface of the caramel colored liquid in his cup. He apparently had been more distracted than he originally thought, though, it was not as awful as his mind had imagined.
“Are you trying to kill yourself, Sherlock? Is that what this is about? Throwing a fit because I have a life and a family to worry about?”
I'm not going entirely cannon, just to focus more on Sherlock's inner thoughts. The dialogue has obviously been changed to something more relevant to the situation that the characters are in. Some quotes are indeed from episodes and I do not own them. I've decided to turn this into a slow burn (For the Johnlock, that is), so be warned the first few chapters are going to contain quite a bit of angst with minimal relief except for in dream sequence and in a drug fueled sex haze. So, just be warned that user Sherlock is ahead for this chapter.
“Since you decided to drag me to this insufferable event, I do believe I deserve to be the one to lead.” The detective stated with a small smirk as he shifted his grip on the doctor’s hand, his other hand moving to rest on John’s shoulder blade. The army doctor sputtered as he tried to argue that he could lead but was swiftly shut down as the hands rested on him. The song was slowly becoming hushed, a silence following before a new song started, this time much more slow. John swallowed heavily as the detective began to move, the shorter stumbling as he tried to follow. He squeaked out an apology as he stepped on the man’s foot, Sherlock physically wincing.
“Irrelevant.” Sherlock huffed, with a slight curve to his lip he glanced at his friend as he put the chicken in the microwave.
“John?” Sherlock asked once more, head tilting slightly. With that, John had finally reached his limit. With a piercing glare directed at the consulting detective, John dropped the Tesco bags on the floor, most likely breaking the eggs he had bought. As the doctor’s hand began to shake, He glared even harder at the man who had caused the chaos of their flat. With a shaking finger, John pointed at Sherlock, thoroughly prepared to give him a mouthful.
“John, I am— what I mean to say is— well… I am sorry” Sherlock stumbled over his words. Pausing Sherlock looked at John before continuing.
close to having a mental break down. It had been a stressful day at the the clinic, patient after patient complaining of the same thing, runny nose, sore throat, and coughing — the common cold. Most of the patients had been kind and understanding as he diagnosed them, but others had been completely petulant and down right rude. Listening to the whines and moans of ill people all day had made it hard enough for him to keep composed, but to add on top were the patients, who with scratchy voices, asked of his credentials, glowering at him all the while. John’s breath could be seen as he let out a weary sigh into the cold air as he continued his way down the leaf-strewn streets of London.
As John opened the front door of 221B and climbed the stairs, he thought about just going straight upstairs but was interrupted by the door to the flat opening.
“Oh Sherlock, you look as if John threw away one of your experiments, like the one with the mold in the jam.” Mrs. Hudson grinned at the detective who in return just raised an eyebrow.
“He has no one to dance with… Such a sad sight.” She frowned slightly as he approached, glancing to the detective to see if he acted. Sherlock continued to stare at the downcast male, tapping his fingers against the tablecloth before he jumped up and careened towards the army doctor, flattening his suit as he neared the man. John stopped as he nearly ran into the detective, looking up at the expressionless man. Sherlock stood silent before clearing his throat and holding his hand out to the shorter male, John’s eyes widening a fraction.
“It’s not a big deal John.” The detective answered, shifting his weight before continuing. “You are overreacting.”
“You git!” John tried to look angry but, the smile on his face said otherwise. The detective chuckled as he lead the man through the dance, the duo unaware of the eyes of their friends. Their movements slowly lead them closer together, a small space between the two as they continued to dance through the songs, not paying them any attention. Sherlock’s hand slowly slipped to the middle of the doctor’s back, pulling them closer as they swept across floor, eyes locking as the room seemed to go silent.
The frozen Autumn wind cut through John’s thin jacket, causing a series of goosebumps to prickle on his skin. Pulling his jacket tighter around his frame, the doctor continued walking the streets of London. He was the only one on the street, most likely due to the drop in temperature. It was incredibly silent, other than the occasional cab that passed by. Checking his watch, John checked the time — 7:24. It had been about three and a half hours since he had left the flat. Blowing into his freezing hands, John looked through the window of a cafe. Pulling out his wallet, he realized he had used all his money, surely not wanting to use his card and have a row with the chip and pin machine, on the groceries he had dropped. John let out a choked sigh before shoving his wallet back in his pocket and turning around to walk back the other way.
“Of course I’m bloody angry, nice deduction there!” John stomped up to Sherlock, putting his shaking finger in his face and opening his mouth to pour out more of his anger.
“That’s ridiculous! No such thing exists.” Sherlock replied, face scrunching up in confusion and distaste. John huffed before leaning over to grab a fortune cookie. Removing the wrapper, he cracked the cookie in half and pulled out the slip of paper. Sherlock looked out of the corner of his eye before fully turning to his grinning flatmate.
“I’m sure they wouldn’t mind it happening again, it seems they have been waiting for this…” The detective stated, pulling back just far enough to get the words out before crashing his lips back to the doctor’s. John sighed against the man’s lips before he returned with the soft press of his own lips. When they broke apart once more, needing air, Sherlock gently took the army doctor’s hand before he pressed a chaste kiss to his knuckles, the charming gesture causing John’s heart to skip a beat.
“Would you like to dance?” Sherlock kept his hand outreached as he waited for John’s answer, already having thought of around 12 responses to being rejected. The doctor looked between the hand and the detective’s face before opening his mouth, deciding on whether to accept as he found it suddenly harder to create words. Instead he snapped his mouth shut and slowly placed his hand into Sherlock’s, a sudden electric current shooting down his spine. He wondered if it was just him or if the rest of the room felt it but, his thoughts were soon shut off as he was pulled towards the rest of the dancers. Behind the two, their landlady beamed as they strode away.
Sherlock is in the hospital, and John is pissed off. Sherlock doesn't want to reveal to John what he found out about Mary during his most recent case, but he feels like he's betraying his friend all over again if he continues to keep it a secret.
Again, Sherlock’s eyes blinked quite a bit rapidly before settling on John, unblinking and staring right through the other. He was holding an entirely conversation with John in his head, all while he stood extremely still, one arm half extended to his coffee cup and the other resting in the air a bit in the center of his chest as if he was making a hand motion.
“I found out that you had went out thanks to Mycroft. He had told me you went to a gay bar, for what he thought was a case, and left with a stranger in stupor.” There was a venom in his words that made Sherlock feel a budding ache of guilt somewhere deep in his gut. “Are you going to tell me why you went home with someone? Because if not you’re telling me what drugs you’re on.”
The night continued after finishing a case and making an arrest of the Mayfly Man, the wedding photographer who Sherlock found to be the one committing one of his favorite unsolved cases. It gave Sherlock enough of a distraction to not force himself to leave during the dance reception, though he desperately wanted to. The hole that was forming inside of him was slowly growing deeper the more he saw the connection between John and Mary. Of course, Mary was witty and observant, much like himself, but she seemed to have some sway over John that Sherlock never imagined he could give to the retired army Captain.
John looked a bit surprised, seeing how tender Sherlock was with the child and how calm his daughter was.
“I’m afraid I must be leaving, John, but let me first say this. My first and last vow is whatever it takes, whatever happens from now on, I will always be there for the three of you... I mean two of you.”
“She never sleeps in someone’s arms like that..” He said softly. “They always have to be sitting down… She’s normally so fussy…”
John smiled some, watching Sherlock hold his daughter and something in his chest tightened. He stood straighter at the feeling and seemed to struggle with himself for a moment.
*DRUG USE IS IN THIS CHAPTER (not graphically depicted)/ AS WELL AS SEX UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SAID DRUGS (not hatefully explicit)*
“Are you acting like a child because you can’t drag me along to make you feel clever? That you don’t have someone to make look daft while you finish a case?”
John had tended to Sherlock after he had gotten sick in the sitting room. When the other came to, he seemed panicked, lashing out at John and shouting nonsense before he realised that it was John who was sitting in front of him. John had gripped him by the front of his dressing gown, pulling his old tee shirt into his fists with the fabric, and setting his jaw. Sherlock could see the vein in the center of his forehead becoming visible, John’s usually cheerful face turning red with anger.
“One of those things will be about Mary. The first… Is I would like to say I’m sorry, John. For how I acted. I reacted poorly and should have been more appreciative of you being there to help me.”
“Stop lying to me Sherlock, it’s starting to make me fucking angry.” He said lowly. Sherlock sighed and sat in his armchair, and to the detective’s surprise, John grabbed his chin, then checked Sherlock’s eyes with a penlight from his breast pocket. “Jesus Sherlock, how long have you been doing this? Weeks?”
The stranger was gentle with him, taking time to prepare him and give attention his cock before he rolled on a condom and had his way with Sherlock. The whole time, resting on his stomach and keeping his eyes closed, he imagined John as the one touching him, sucking dark bruises along his neck and shoulder. He imagined blunt fingernails digging into his hips, and rough calloused hands kneading flesh anywhere there was a good enough grip. He imagined John as the one fucking him, groaning and whispering little curses under his breath.
Mary smiled lovingly at her husband, gently touching his arm. “Because it’s your wedding day, your day off. You shouldn’t have to think like a doctor, we’ve just married!”
Though Sherlock was not necessarily a creature of affection or longing, something about John Watson made his heart jump to a gallop and sent a bit of a fog into his mind palace, wafting over his well constructed courtyard and making its presence ever known by the continued clouding of vision, even if ever so slightly, it was not ideal to be working with an inhibited mind. Sherlock had a decision to make, and the two possible paths were continued indifference and selfish sabotage. He cared too much for John to hurt him at any capacity again such as he had when he fell, so he knew his selfish option would be pushed to the back recesses of his mind. That left one final decision for Sherlock Holmes, and that was to bury himself so deep in his work that he wouldn’t have the time to think of John Watson anymore.
“Wait! There are other people here!” The shorter male said as he remembered they were in public, putting his fingertips up to the detective’s lips that had been closing in on him moments before. Glancing around, Sherlock wouldn’t pay much attention to the wide, knowing grins on their friends faces and instead swiftly moved the doctor’s hand away before pushing his lips to the man’s once more, this time almost with urgency.
“I’M OVERREACTING?!” John’s face had become a bright red and steam could almost be seen coming out of his ears. “I have had a
“Ah, Hello John. How was the clinic?” Sherlock asked, the corners of his mouth lifting into a barely there smile. John felt a spike of anger run through him. Just as fast as fast as it came Sherlock’s lips dipped into a frown as his faced creased in confusion.
“John?” Freezing, John slowly turned around to face the voice. Sherlock stood in the doorway, with a spark of relief in his eyes. Before the doctor could ascend the stairs, the detective turned, leaving the door open, as if to say ‘follow me’. Sighing, John walked into the flat, jaw dropping for the second time that day. The flat was spotlessly clean, no chemicals or wooden debris littering the floor, counters, or walls. Looking in the kitchen, there was a new table in a rich, dark umber that stood with no scientific tools or chemicals on it. John’s thoughts were interrupted by the deep baritone of his friends voice.
“His name is Greg, by the way.” The doctor corrected, Sherlock waving his hand as he dismissed the correction.
“Nothing.” John smiled, before placing the fortune on the table, and watching the British man with a fez dance around the television.
Opening the ebony door, John rubbed his sore shoulder, which had acted up from the chilly breeze. Anxiously, he bound up the stairs, excited to sit in front of the warm, crackling fire. As thrilled as he was, it soon diminished when he heard a loud /thump/ and the sound of glass breaking followed by a quiet curse and footsteps running about the room directly in front of him. Taking a deep breath and counting to ten in his head, John opened the door, ready to confront the mess that was evidently going to make itself present. Surely counting to the small number ten had been enough to calm his temper… definitely not. John’s mouth hung open as he stared at his flatmate somehow scurrying around the kitchen. Shards of broken glass and wood from their table covered the ground as well as a mysterious, green substance, that was most likely chemicals, that clung to every surface. Clenching his hand into a fist, John closed his eyes and tried to control his breathing. Opening his eyes only made his aggravation grow when his eyes met the now still, Consulting Detective, Sherlock Holmes.
“You’re angry.” Sherlock quipped, raising a single eyebrow as he continued watching the smaller man burst at the seams.
“I am glad you made me come here.” The detective turned his head to the side to press a kiss to the doctor’s palm as if to thank him. John smiled sheepishly up at the man before he gently pulled him down and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, to which the detective happily returned.
Columns of smoke filled the skies of London as fireplace in each home were lit. The chilled breeze of Autumn blew through the streets as children giggled, splashing through the puddles created from the drizzle that followed the downpour of rain earlier that morning. Crisp leaves crunched under the foot of a short, stocky man who was quickly making his way to the nearest Tesco. Anyone who took one look at him could easily tell he was
“You see the man in the purple suit to my left? Balding slightly, his right ear is about a forth of an inch higher than his left.” The detective leaned closer to whisper to John.
seen anyone dance in. He had a grin plastered on his face as he twirled and swayed among the other guests, most likely spouting nonsense and discussing the repulsive sentimental values of a wedding. The man had decided to drag him along to Molly and… what was his name? Graham? Gavin? Geoff? Oh whatever! It was irritating and grating on his last nerve as he was forced to watch the newlyweds parade around in happiness.
“Unimportant.” The detective answered before returning his hand to the male’s shoulder. He slowly smiled down at the army doctor.
“It’s fine. Relax, there is no need to be nervous.” The detective tried calming the man who was slowly going pink in the face from stepping on his partner’s foot. John nodded as he focused on his steps, a small smile growing on Sherlock’s face as he watched his flatmate concentrate on his feet.
“Poor John.” Mrs. Hudson stated with nonchalant sigh. Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed before looking towards the woman.
The detective groaned loudly as he listened to the music change to something just a annoying, the chatter of the dancing crowd only growing louder. Most of the guests were dancing, the few reclusive or tired were located amongst the tables, flickering candles creating a dim lighting which hid them in the shadows. Lost in his own thoughts, Sherlock had forgotten he wasn’t alone at the table and it would take the light laughter of his landlady to stir him from his mind.
“Geoff’s brother, he works for a bakery. Dry hands from the flour, burns from the ovens. He has a happy lifestyle and enjoys his job. Baked bread today, dough is caked under his fingernails and there is a spot of flour on the side of his neck… He also has a strange obsession with felt hats, possibly due to his balding head.” Sherlock made a smug face as he finished his deductions before looking down at the doctor who was currently snorting as he tried to stifle his laughter.
The detective wanted to draw back, but there was nothing he could do to stop John. John yanked Sherlock up fully to his feet despite their height difference and pushed Sherlock back until he had slammed him against a nearby bookcase, rocking it and causing a few books to fall to the floor with loud thumps. Sherlock had bowed his head, focusing on the white knuckles of John’s fists that were coiled tightly around the fabric of his clothes. In this context, Sherlock should have been aroused, but he felt shame burning at the back of his throat and clawing its way into his brain, whispering insults.
Sherlock closed his eyes, sniffing a bit and clearing his throat to hold back the wave of emotion crashing to the front of his mind. He sank back into the seat of the car and watched the sky, wasting no time to find his way into his apartment when the cab stopped outside of 221B Baker Street. He moved into the sitting room and stared at where John used to sit for hours on end, mind wandering to different places and different scenarios for what the future held for the duo.
“John, no… I’m fine, I feel fine. I just need to relax. Work out of this high and I will be perfectly fine, I promi--”
The man he was now watching across the bar was a retired military man, hair cropped short and cleaning around the neckline. A visible tan just below the collar of his shirt and under the cuffs of his sleeves. He figured of a younger age than John, but his clouded mind somehow managed to see a silver haired John Watson in one of his hideous jumpers and a jacket. He moved closer down the bar, sipping his water and casting occasional glances at the man there. He knew he wouldn’t be able to flirt, let alone take this man home, if it were not for the fact it was a gay bar. The man turned a bit when he noticed Sherlock sit close to him and smiled.
When Sherlock managed to meet his climax, he buried his face in the blankets under him, letting out a choked sob of a name as all of his nerve endings were set ablaze and fizzled out to raw short circuit points. He had sobbed John’s name into those sheets, and wanted nothing more than the sobs to fall on the ears of his best friend.
“And you are a selfish man who would rather abandon his supposed best friend for a woman than help him. Not caring enough to notice when your best friend has reached a new level of low. I may be suicidal--”
Inside of the house, John led Sherlock to the nursery. Rosie was sleeping in her crib with her arms stretched out and head tilted off to one side. Sherlock knew he was in trouble when he saw the child. He knew that seeing this child and being a part of her life, even if it could not be at John’s side the way he wished, was something he had to do. When Sherlock leaned a bit over the crib, Rosie blinked her eyes open and looked at Sherlock, yawning widely and shifting her arms and legs. Sherlock looked to John, arms up a bit as if ready to scoop the child out of her crib.
“Well, don’t you look a bit interestin’.” He drawled, moving his eyes up Sherlock’s torso to his face. “Got a nice chiseled face and pretty eyes. Fancy a drink?” He asked, scooting closer towards Sherlock’s stool and waving the bartender down.
“As you know, I am not good with emotions and sentiment, but I can see I obviously caused you unhappiness. I am sorry.” Walking back into the kitchen, Sherlock grabbed a mug— John’s mug. “I made tea.” Sherlock began, handing the piping mug to the doctor. “I also ordered Chinese, its in the fridge… I didn’t know if you would come back.” John looked into the swirling brown drink in his hands, it was earl grey, his favorite. John glanced up at Sherlock then back at his mug of tea. John felt tears prickle in his eyes, all the stress finally catching up.
“May I have this dance?” Sherlock smirked, holding his hand out once more to the doctor who this time eagerly took it before being swept away, laughing as the detective matched his dancing with John’s own moves, which still hadn’t improved over the course of the night.
“I haven’t the slightest idea as to what you mean.” He huffed before looking back to the dance floor, absentmindedly focusing on the army doctor. The woman followed the male’s eyes, grin widening as she found who he was so intently watching. She would remain silent, the song eventually changed and the group began to pair off, the shorter of ‘her boys’ scanning the crowd as he was left between the dancing bodies of couples, long-term and those who had just met. His face fell slightly as he glanced once more before slowly walking back towards the tables, melting into the darkness to join those cloistered and alone.
Sherlock slowly pulled the male closer, heart staggering as he heard the latter let out a quiet puff of air that almost sounded like a gasp. The doctor slowly rested his head against the detective’s chest, breathing out short puffs of air into the man’s dark coat and crisp, white shirt. Sherlock slowly moved his hand from the doctor’s hand to his cheek, cupping it as he slowly lifted John’s head to gaze into his ocean orbs. The detective swallowed thickly, cheekbones tinted a light rose pink as he looked down at the doctor’s face, which was glowing a soft red. Foreheads touched as Sherlock slowly leaned his head down, John meeting him halfway. The detective’s eyes slipped shut as he inhaled, their tea from the morning mixed with the sweet biscuits from Mrs. Hudson, a hint of cinnamon sneaking in, flooding his senses. He slowly opened his eyes to be met with John’s once more before he pushed down, mind turning to static as his fingertips sparked. The doctor’s lips were slightly chapped from the cold, London air but were soft in a way that made him never want to part from them and warm like the tea he would find sitting next to him when he left his mind palace. Sherlock tilted his head as he tried moving closer, seeking more of this feeling. Somewhere, his mind was cataloguing every sense, feel, and emotion that rushed through him. John’s arms found their way around the man’s neck as he leaned up, trying to keep their connection.
Nothing about today has been predictable. Sherlock remained in the living room all day, lying on the sofa, creating nasty smells and annoying noises with his experiments in the kitchen, going through emails and pronouncing them all “boring!”. That was normal.
sorry for your loss. Truly. If there’s anything you need, anything at all… a good meal delivered to your place… you be sure to let me know.”
Sherlock was texting furiously, frowning at his phone. He looked up as John approached and put his phone away.
And they’d stroll home… to 221b Baker Street… and Sherlock would time it so that they’d arrive when Mrs. Hudson was normally out visiting Mrs. Turner, and they’d go to the sitting room and they’d sit in their chairs across from each other, and Sherlock would pour them glasses of the leftover brandy hidden in the back of the corner cabinet, and he’d finish his tale (leaving out Mycroft’s involvement in that disastrous Serbian fiasco). Then he’d heave a great sigh, turn up his hands, and finish with “And here we are.”
Sherlock’s smile faded slightly. “He might have… arrested me a little for public intoxication. I was a bit high. But while he was driving me to the Met, I solved a case he’d been stumped on for weeks. As usual.”
Sherlock sat in his chair, tense, chest high as if holding his breath, mouth slightly open, eyes glassy.
But when John’s tremors stopped and his body lost most of its rock-hard tension, he pulled back. Sherlock nearly protested, but then a strong, calloused hand gripped Sherlock’s neck and he got a nose-full of John’s scent of tea and leather and aftershave and John when warm lips were pressed against his cheekbone in a fierce kiss.
“She’s sleeping better,” John said, leaning his head back against his seat and sighing. “Rosie. Got my first full-night’s sleep last night. Didn’t have to get up once.”
He had absolutely no doubt that he’d be warmly welcomed back, that John would be delighted to see him.
And maybe John would rise from his chair, stand before Sherlock, reach out a hand that Sherlock would take, pull Sherlock to his feet, reach up on his adorable tiptoes, cup Sherlock’s flushed face with his calloused, strong hands, run his thumbs over Sherlock’s too-prominent cheekbones, and press his warm, brandy-wet lips against Sherlock’s cool, waiting ones.
“It is what it is,” Sherlock murmured again, his voice so low and soft that John could pretend he’d imagined it.
When they came up for air, Sherlock was leaning heavily forward on John, foreheads pressed together, John’s knees aching something fierce where they rested on the hard floor. For several long minutes, they didn’t speak… they simply breathed together, looking at each other’s faces from this new angle, seeing their faces like one might see a life-long friend after years away, occasionally exchanging touches on their necks and hair and faces while they tried to breathe and understand this universal shift that had just occurred and with which their lives would now follow.
Without realizing it, he took a step forward, out from the trees. Then another. Another. Twigs cracked beneath his shoes. Part of him was doing it on purpose. He was always good at sneaking up on suspects. But the voice in his head, the one that had changed without him realizing, no longer cold and clipped and scornful, but instead gentle yet firm, kind yet unwavering, teasing yet affectionate, told him sneaking up on a grieving John Watson would be more than a Bit Not Good.
“You saved her from execution. From Moriarty. You grieved when you thought she’d died. You must feel
John snorted loudly enough that a few patrons looked in their direction. Sherlock joined in the laughter as John covered his mouth with a napkin. He felt his face go red with mirth, and the tension and slight churn of unhappiness inside him vanished.
“The circles under your eyes are vanishing. And you haven’t touched your shoulder yet this evening.”
The sitter was late, the tube was delayed, it started pouring the minute he stepped outside, and by the time he reached Angelo’s, his shoes and jacket were soaked. Yet as soon as the restaurant door closed behind him, silencing the rain and engulfing him in a soft golden glow of candles and dimmed lighting, John felt himself relax. And when he spotted Sherlock sitting at the table by the window where they’d sat the night they first met, John smiled.
“I have withstood many trials in my life, but your death would be the one I could not pass. I cannot bear losing you.” Sherlock huffed and glanced down at his pockmarked arm. “I do not think I would survive that.”
“Not quite. Very straightforward. Run until you’ve outrun them. No rooftop leaps or cabbie chases. Dull.”
“With Mary,” John clarified, looking at his glass, twinkling with each flicker of the flames. “The guilt of cheating, even if it was just texting. What kind of man cheats when he’s just become a father? But then I’d rationalize with ‘What kind of person lies about her entire life to her husband’? I’d tell myself my lies were minor, compared to hers.”
Unsure how to react, Sherlock brought his arms up to rest around John’s waist, then back. That felt… Good. Right. Sherlock tightened his own grip.
Feeling himself go cross-eyed, John laughed and pulled back. “What are we doing?” he asked, still running his hands over Sherlock’s cheeks and hair, his neck and shoulders. “What the bloody hell are we doing.”
He sits on the couch, and Rosie, delighted, crawls over to him and grips his leg to pull herself up. He lifts her onto the couch, and she settles next to him, showing him her new book, which mainly consists of colorful barn animals with their names written below them.
“Not bloody likely.” John gave his hands a squeeze, prompting an involuntary smile from Sherlock. “Just… slow, yeah? I want… I want to do this. God, I want it.”
Sherlock’s head ducked as he grinned hard enough to make his eyes crinkle. John felt the expression forming on his own face. He pulled Sherlock’s right hand to his own lips, planting a kiss on it. “I do have Rosie to consider, and you… well, you need to recover. There’s just… Jesus, there’s so much baggage… let’s just go slow so we can do it right.”
When they leave, many hours later, it is cold and raining, and Mummy and Daddy are both weeping, and Mummy says it’s like she’s lost her little girl all over again.
And John would marvel and shake his head slowly, awed and amazed and so happy to be back, and ready to begin their work again.
“How long ago was that?” John asked, when he could finally catch his breath enough to take a cleansing sip of water.
The wind was knocked out of him, but it wasn’t a punch; it was a full-body attack. No, not an attack, a…
“I knew it, I knew it.” Sherlock said it like it was something that has been in the back of his head for years that he’d forgotten about. He took John’s hands, holding them in both his own, and kissing them with what John felt was unbelievable tenderness. He looked up at John, through open, soft eyes. “Good shot.”
“More like an eternity,” muttered Sherlock as Angelo bustled over. The proprietor's face broke into an enormous grin when he saw them.
“And what lovers do with each other to express affection and physical closeness,” John continues, no interruption to his God-awful slow typing.
I had this idea while rewatching The Empty Hearse: How did Sherlock imagine his reunion with John would go? He seemed naively excited, so I wanted to explore what he may have been expecting.
This case in particular required him to go undercover, and to do so, Sherlock always believed it was entirely best to completely immerse himself in what he was facading to be. This case involved him facading as a drug addict and staying in one of his usual drug dens.
Sherlock suddenly felt even worse for his outburst. John looked up and sighed. “Do you… want to meet her?”
When inside the apartment, he found John sitting at one of the kitchen chairs, arms crossed over his chest and a somewhat hateful expression on his face. Sherlock looked quickly over John, focusing on his hands to see if the other was still wearing his wedding ring. Disappointment rushed over him when he saw John indeed was, and he perked up to his normal straight posture.
“She left me a note, explaining most everything. Someone had found her and she had to… Disappear for a while. I thought it was going to be longer than a week, but… She’s supposed to be coming home today.” The hope didn’t reach John’s voice, or his eyes.
Sherlock looked a bit shocked and avoided John’s eyes. “Nothing I haven’t taken before John, I know what I’m doing.”
His heart twisted in his chest and a lump formed in his throat. “Well, yes, don’t panic. You’ve had plenty of practice being parents. You’ll hardly need me around now that you’re having a real baby.”
Sherlock didn’t flinch, he felt like he had a justified right to be upset, and he could continue to argue now. “Oh shut up! It was for your own safety. You would have gotten yourself killed if it weren’t for me. I came back, John, I gave you your miracle. Now give me my bloody cigarettes.”
He managed to force himself to interact for a few hours before he made his way to John and Mary, smiling just a bit at the happy couple.
“A case?! What case would require you to take this combination of drugs, and that many? None, exactly. Now get up, I’m taking you to the hospital.” John said, grabbing Sherlock’s arm.
And that is exactly what he managed to do, or so he thought. He had solved more cases than he had in ages by himself, some of them he solved with John, or Mary, thankful to have the help when he needed to verbalize his ideas.
The man’s eyes lit up and he ordered another round of whatever he had been drinking, handing one of the drinks to Sherlock, who took his time sipping it. He was already high, he didn’t need the added inhibition of alcohol as well. Hours passed and the man was guiding Sherlock down the sidewalk, laughing about some Joke Sherlock wasn’t listening to. He only saw John telling some story about work, laughing and waving his arms for emphasis.
The cab ride to John’s home was a stressful one. When he rang the doorbell, he was convinced John was going to knock his lights out again, but he let out a deep breath, clenching his fist on his hand that wasn’t on the door.
John took it and looked up at Sherlock in awe. “There is no possible way you’ve taken all of this.” He said in a small, wavering voice. “Sherlock what the hell do you think you’re doing to yourself?!”
John felt regret wash over him, but his pride and anger were far too great for him to act gentle now.
When Sherlock asked about his moustache, he couldn’t help but tackle the man out of anger and try to wrap his hands around the other man’s neck to squeeze the life out of that clever throat of Sherlock’s. Most of what he had been yelling at the curly haired detective was drowned out by the commotion he had created, but a few phrases rang out clear as a bell.
John chuckles, not looking up from his laptop screen. “Classified? Really, Sherlock. You can’t possibly be as ignorant as you’re pretending to be about cuddling.”
John’s fists on Sherlock’s collar clenched so his knuckles were white, and this would be it, this would be when John punched him…
John gave a curt nod, then went back to his food. He could feel Sherlock watching him. “My father was appalled when Harry came out,” he told his plate. “Thought he’d break her nose. She was barely home after that.”
Twenty minutes later, they were lazing in their respective chairs across from each other, a fire crackling in the grate, wine simmering warmly in their bellies. Each held a small measure of whiskey in their glasses, relaxed in their seats, enjoying the warmth and the quiet and the company.
“Mm.” John took another, longer sip of his wine. He nearly finished the glass before putting it down. The familiar burn threatened in his stomach, and he felt his mood take a precarious yet small drop. A whisper of the feelings that had overwhelmed him every night for the past several weeks tickled the back of his mind. The burn of whiskey in his esophagus, the numbing of all senses except pain, the feeling of sinking in quicksand with nothing to grab onto… all were held back by the tiniest string.
A steaming bowl is set on the coffee table before Sherlock, and John sits beside him, a mug in his hands.
Sherlock thought John was wondering if they were making a mistake. He’d thought John was pulling away.
Sherlock gaped at John’s wicked smile. “Wait… you just…” His face, which had been flushed before, turned scarlet at John’s giggle. Then his lips turned up, and a deep laughter spilled out of his chest. John surged forward, capturing Sherlock’s laughs with his lips.
Time seemed to stop or skip for Sherlock (not unlike the time he’d received an electric shock from loose wires in a puddle and came to on his back, gasping for breath, and unsure of how much time had passed). And John was pulling back, not letting go as his hands still gripped Sherlock’s collar and the front of his coat as if unwilling to separate from him.
Something painfully soft presses against Sherlock’s forehead for a moment, and he tightens his own lips, afraid their trembling will give him away.
Trying not to utter an indecent moan with Rosie sitting right beside him, Sherlock closes his eyes and tips his head back into John’s hands, unraveling under his ministrations.
“Your hair is dripping.” John sets his mug down and gets up. He returns a moment later and stands behind the couch where Sherlock is sitting, a towel in his hands, and begins drying Sherlock’s hair. Only he doesn’t just dry it; he slowly, carefully, and methodically massages the towel around Sherlock’s head, pressing over the ears, running the towel over Sherlock’s scalp with his fingers spread, rubbing circles around either side of the top of his neck.
He stood far enough that a normal person might look right past him if they were too lost in their own thoughts and feelings. But John Watson was not a normal person. An idiot, to be sure, but an idiot who was always aware of his surroundings, knew when he was being watched, and who would never not see Sherlock. He saw things in Sherlock that even Sherlock didn’t see in himself. That’s what made John so….
This was… not good. Not even Mummy had shown such pure, honest, exposed grief or emotion on his behalf, ever. She’d always been kept from the worst of it by Mycroft. But this… this was the first time he’d ever hurt someone and had their pain thrown in his face, unable to hide from it, unable to ignore it or wish it away.
“Cuddling,” John informs him, typing away on his laptop, one painful key at a time. “The colloquial term is cuddling.”
