John choked down the impulse to snap at the implication that he cared only for frippery. As he ran his hands over the tin of tea, he remembered the warmth of his Papa cuddled together when John was a child. Papa always smelled of tea.  With the war on and the French blockades, tea like this was almost impossible to obtain.
Nodding, he obeyed. His aunt patted his knee, out of sight of the others, in a motion so kind that John feared the gathering tears would not stay in his eyes.
And Greg! How could he have suggested it would be an excellent idea if John were to marry Sebastian? His cousin and Sebastian Moran had been enemies since birth, being born within months of each other.
“After a fortnight at Watson Hall, I have heard many things, including the fact that Sir Albert was most anxious to marry you himself before your father told him that would never come to pass.”
“I know.” Mr. Holmes looked up at him, his face almost as close as it had been when he’d shoved John to the ground to save him from the wagon. “I’m not myself, Mr. Watson. Forgive my lack of manners.”
The hoot of an owl sounded near him. Had it been confused by the dark clouds into thinking night was coming? He’d never heard of such a thing. A burst of fear threatened to smother him. Could it be a signal? From whom? To whom?
Sherlock smiled as Sir Albert came at him. At the last second he stepped aside and put his foot out to trip Sir Albert, who fell against the table with a crash. The wedding cake teetered. The top two layers tumbled to the floor, one striking Sir Albert on the head. With a laugh, Sherlock took the cider and poured it over his head.
He whirled from the window and stared at Greg who stood in the doorway. Even though the day’s heat was close and stifling, he wore a dark brown coat and a correctly tied cravat.
John answered when required as Reverend Hooper read the marriage rite. He kept his gaze in the center of his surplice until he asked, “Who gives this Omega in marriage.”
“Father would have to speak from himself.” John cleared his throat to hide his uneasiness. He wished he could take his words back. Too late, Mr. Holmes gaze drilled through him, as if he intended to cut a hole straight through him.
?” Molly laughed. “Are you about to journey to London for a Season, Sebastian? Mayhap you can find a destitute duke's Omega who is desperate to marry you.”
“If not aloud, at least in your mind.” Sherlock’s arm around John’s waist kept him from pulling away. “Listen to me!”
John looked away from his beguiling smile. Mayhap Aunt Hudson had sent him out here so that he had to face his own unthinking choices. Once again, he had not considered the consequences of listening to his heart instead of common sense. He had been a widgeon to let Sherlock steal a few kisses, but John feared he could easily steal more than that. He could steal John’s heart as well.
“Are only two of your enemies.” Sherlock took a deep breath and released it through tight lips. “You need to realize, John, that the night I arrived here, the smugglers came here to teach your father a lesson about interfering with their work.”
Father glanced at them as he lifted his cup of coffee. “Sit down, Sherlock. As Auntie said, you are now a part of this family. You need not wait for an invitation to partake of a meal.”
“Your company for tea.” Sherlock gestured to where a maid was placing a tray with all the makings for a pleasant tea on a table by near the bay window.
Perhaps he should go tell Greg. Their cousin in name only, the three of them had grown up as siblings after Greg’s parents died of influenza during his early childhood. Father had been devastated at the death of his only sister so soon after the loss of his mate. Harry looked up to Greg and perhaps his methodical analysis would help temper Harry’s enthusiasm. However, he was rarely at Watson Hall anymore, preferring to spend his days and evenings paying court on Miss Sally Donovan. It would be an excellent match, a Watson Alpha wedding the Omega daughter of a neighboring squire. Father had expressed his curiosity as to why no announcement had been made, but Greg would not be hurried. His choice in a mate would be as deliberate and well thought out a decision as all other decisions he made were.
“Sorry?” With a laugh, Sherlock tugged John into his arms. He brushed aside John’s fringe. His lips stilled John’s answer as he teased John to remember the rapture of stolen kisses. When Sherlock’s tongue surreptitiously teased the corners of John’s lips, his breath swirled through John’s mouth.
Instead of answering his question, his brother asked, “Do you expect Sherlock to return to Watson Hall tonight?”
I am right.” She rose, putting a hand on her right hip. When John stepped forward to help her, Auntie waved him away. “It’s just the weather, child. The dampness gnaws at my old bones just as curiosity gnaws at my mind. As it does yours.”
His head jerked up at John’s voice. Sherlock’s smile became ironic when he saw the glass John held out. If he were to drink, he would prefer it be of John’s lips, not this overly sweet lemonade.
“I’ve told you over and over, you ask too many questions, Sherlock.” His voice softened as Sherlock’s hand drifted along his neck to linger on his shoulder.
Sherlock shrugged.  “If he is out and about at night, is he ministering to the townsfolk or doing the devil’s own duties? I don’t know.  It’s not my task to uncover all the smugglers, just to arrange a meeting with their leader.”
He flung his arms around Sherlock, knowing how lonely it would be.  John could not betray Sherlock. No matter what, he would keep his secret hidden in his heart next to his unending love for him. When Sherlock slanted his mouth across his, John tried not to think what that vow might cost him.
“Mrs. James!” He did not wait for an invitation to climb into the vehicle. Even Mrs. James’ endless litany of ailments seemed welcome today.
“Would you do me the honor, my lady?” he asked, resisting his inclination to look over at John to discover if
“What are you talking about?” Greg pushed himself to his feet, his arms still wrapped around his middle.
Although John wanted to fight him, he told himself to be calm. Sebastian was furious, and John must take care that he did not rouse his temper, for it was clearly as vicious as his father’s. “Sebastian, you are mistaken. Think what you are doing. Let me up.”
He put a hand on the side of the seat to climb back aboard. “Thank you, Mr. Watson. If you could step back, I would hate for you to chance getting hurt.”
Oh, hell, Sherlock had noticed John staring when he first opened the door.  John felt his face flush.
the address nor the phone directories were likely to be up to date, John became completely disheartened.
Ivan dismounted and went to stroke his old friend’s nose.  As he was doing so, the house door flew open and Marfa Hudovna came running out.  She embraced Ivan as if he were her son, and he hugged her in return.
“I think we’ve established that Victor was an arse sufficiently that we don’t need to discuss him again.”
Or, no, not flame, Ivan realized when he started breathing again.  But the growing sunlight displayed all the colours of flame – crimson and scarlet, gold and citrine, even the pale purplish-blue of the hottest flames – on its wings and tail.  The feathers shaded to a rich purple on its upper body, which had two very human arms, and then to black on its head and lower body.  A crest of black feathers grew from its head.  Its black-feathered legs looked almost human, except that they ended in the clawed feet of a bird.
“I’ve got photos of him doping her wine, and Sherlock’s got samples of the doped wine itself. Anything on the wire?”
The forest stretched beneath them like vast green sea whose waves were the tossing of branches in the wind.  At the height at which they flew, the wind was cold and cutting, but Ivan felt warm enough in his surcoat and safe with Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him.  Indeed, there was something familiar about the strange situation, although he could not quite place it.  It was difficult to think, between the excitement of the flight itself and the sensation of being held close and tight against Sherlock’s body, feeling the taut muscles move beneath the feathers.
Miranda opened her mouth, but Lestrade was already speaking. “Easy now.  We’re here to find out what happened, not assign blame.  Right?”  He caught Miranda’s eye, and she subsided.  “So you and your granduncle watched telly, went for walks and shared the occasional pint.  Anything else happen?”
“Who had not been instructed to guard against my best friend’s wife and would not have thought it suspicious if they spotted the doctor’s wife, the trained nurse, doing something with my IV. Janine fiddled with it for nothing more than a bit of malice. Mary had more urgent reasons.”
Bright hair, flame hair, hair feathers, flame feathers...  The words spun around and around in Ivan’s mind, weaving a circle with him in the middle.  The words were dancers and the dancers circled endlessly around him, but one was missing, the others leaving a space in the pattern where he would have been.  Someone or something shrieked and Ivan heard the sounds of battle nearby, but as long as he stayed within the circle of dancing flames they would protect him.  The flames, flickering as dark wings swept overhead, would dance until death.  He wished he could remember
“After the Revolution, the Church of England was outlawed due to its close ties to the British monarchy.  The practice of other sects and religions is technically not illegal, but it’s heavily discouraged.  According to the Committee, ‘religion is the opium of the masses.’  Of course they’ve outlawed opium as well.”
“Not that sort.  Finding stolen objects or missing persons.  Getting people off criminal convictions.  There’s a tavern keeper in Arkhangelsk who’ll provide a free meal for me and anyone I bring with me at any time.  He stood accused of murder.”
“I can speak for myself, Sherlock,” growled Lestrade. “John, if you’ll allow me to take custody of Mr Caustlin?”
.  Mycroft occupied a minor government position as a sort of apprentice to our uncle, Rudolph Vernet. Uncle Rudy occupied a rather more important position.  They were both captured when Revolutionary troops overran the government offices.  Rudy was ordered to divulge sensitive information under threat of torture.  When he refused, Mycroft stepped forward, denounced both Rudy and the royal family and then provided the information himself.  When the first fledging revolutionary government formed, he managed to be part of it.  He’s survived both competition and coups because he’s cold-blooded, heartless and supremely intelligent.  He now sits on the Committee.”
“We were both in our final year. Victor’s birthday fell 34 days before mine.  I’d been researching the synthesis for some time, but it took me longer than I’d planned to complete it.  Part of the problem, of course, was that my work was completely unauthorized, so that I could only use the university labs when no one else was around.”
“After you left your walking stick behind,” Marfa Hudovna explained, “I thrust it into the ground to see what would happen.  When it began to set roots and send out new branches, I knew that as long as the tree throve, so would you.”
“I have no idea.” Sherlock walked further into the flat and looked towards the partly open bedroom door. “We’ve certainly made enough noise to wake you by now,” he announced.
Sherlock, still staring at the tower, shrugged.  “A few times.  And we’re not infiltrating the keep together.  I told you, I can’t fly over the walls.  To breach the protective spells, visitors need to be invited to enter through the gates.  That’s why I need you.”
Angelo’s had been a safe choice for the venue of their first date. For their second, John wanted to try something different. Something on the borders of his own comfort zone that he hoped would lie solidly within Sherlock’s. All right, that applied to most of the crime scenes they visited together, but John was hoping for something more, well, date-like.
As predicted, the crossing was stormy.  Almost all of the company were ill at one time or another, and poor Andreyev never did gain his sea legs.  The exceptions were Nadya and Rada, who could be found on deck in all but the stormiest weather, watching the sailors go about the work of the ship with great interest.  Ivan observed that the second mate seemed to take special care of them, often bringing them mugs of hot tea and stopping to talk awhile with Nadya.
Finally at about eight in the evening, Mrs Holmes announced, “Mary should be clear by now. John, Sherlock, it was lovely to see you again.”
John moved to the sofa and sat down, straddling Sherlock’s hips as he got hold of the other man’s mug and set it on the coffee table. The sofa wasn’t
John stroked the dark curls. “I don’t dare try to imagine that, love. And if I could trust you to stop there, I might take you up on it. But I know you too well.”
“Anything else?” And then, in response to Tyler’s blank stare, “Anything about the people who work in labs?”
“Transport,” replied John, discomfited. In light of Sherlock’s recent revelations, Donovan’s remarks were a bit too close to the bone.  Why was he listening to them, anyway?  He should shake Donovan off and get Sherlock out of there.  But she was still talking.
It was after another, less odoriferous case that Sherlock and John stopped for lunch at a cafe. John ordered tea, a toastie and a packet of crisps. Sherlock ordered coffee and badgered John into ordering cheddar-and-chives crisps instead of salt-and-vinegar. The day was sunny and unusually warm for early November, so they took their meal outdoors. Two boys went running by outside, one of them carrying a Guy Fawkes mannequin.
Sherlock finished his speech and more or less ordered everyone to dance. As the guests happily moved off in threes and twos to comply, John placed one arm around Mary’s shoulders and held the other out to Sherlock. “Come dance with us,” he invited, looking into Sherlock’s eyes and smiling.
“I married a professional assassin,” John heard himself say. He sounded amazingly calm about it.  “She shot Sherlock.”  After all this time, it was a relief to be able to speak of it so conversationally.  Perhaps he could do so now because it might help Campbell-Williams to hear it.
John had listened, serious, and then said, “You wouldn’t even be asking me this if you thought there was any significant possibility of harm to Rosie that we couldn’t protect her against.”
Ivan hesitated, then said, “I don’t mean to pry, but if we’re to infiltrate the keep together, I need to know what you know.  You wouldn’t know about the windows unless you’d been here before.”
He got the duffle zipped, got the car loaded, drove back to Baker Street very carefully because a car wasn’t a weapon, no matter how much he wanted a weapon right now. Anderson & Co helped him unload. Sherlock ignored them, busy at work on his laptop instead. There was bloody fluid all over the kitchen table, left behind by something which had once been alive.
Equally, neither Campbell-Williams nor Wentworth appeared to notice the short blond man who sat alone at a nearby table, nursing a glass of house red and occasionally glaring at his mobile as he waited for a dinner companion who was running late.
John tried phoning Greg to see if he might be interested in going out to a pub, but Greg was working, so John figured he’d get take-away and watch some crap telly. How long had it been since he’d had take-away? Mary was always going on about “eating healthy” and apparently there was no such thing as healthy take-away. As a doctor, John was theoretically in favour of health. In practice, he was looking forward to a bit of a take-away splurge. So what if he’d gained four pounds? (
“Yes, but...” Sherlock swallowed and looked away. “It would be easier if we were close. And if we fall asleep on the sofa, your shoulder will be painful in the morning.”
It was only when the paramedics lifted Sherlock’s stretcher and John prepared to follow them that he realized that at some point, Mary had left.
Privately, John found that the longer the negotiations continued, the more desire eroded any resistance he might have to idea of putting another man’s cock in his mouth. He’d already tasted Sherlock’s mouth, his neck, almost every inch of that long, lean body, and each taste left him wanting more.  He’d even tasted Sherlock’s semen after a particularly successful hand job.  John hadn’t thought about what he was doing at the time.  Surrounded by the heady scent of their shared arousal, it had seemed completely natural to touch his tongue to the tip of his finger.  Only when Sherlock hoarsely murmured his name did John look up, so that the bitter-salt taste in his mouth would be forever associated with the heat in those verdigris eyes and the answering heat in his own groin.
“No, a thief.  I was able to prove that at the time a particularly vicious triple murder had been committed in Maymaksanskiy okrug, he’d been burgling a house in Novadvinsk.  Instead of being executed, he got off with branding.”
Ivan felt his feet shuffling beneath him as his body turned around without his volition.  Having Muircheartaigh at his back made his flesh crawl.  Sherlock looked less pristine than he had this morning, his feathers dusted with ashes and in some disarray, but he stood tall, holding his glorious wings slightly outspread.  Between Sherlock and Ivan lay a pool of liquid set into the stone floor.  Water, Ivan thought at first glance, but the liquid had a curious sheen to it and rippled in a way that was oddly disturbing.  Ivan was fairly sure he did not want to go swimming.
From the sudden silence among the others, Ivan knew they had overheard him.  Then he heard Tyuleneva curse on the other side of the fire and looked up in time to see her spit into the flames.  Ivan, furious, clapped the case shut and leapt to his feet, his hand on his sword hilt.  Tyuleneva did the same, followed by Svinarnikov and then, unexpectedly, Sara.
“But you made sure he was taking them all, right?” Caustlin asked her son, breaking the focus between him and Sherlock.
“Good. Ms Hawkins didn’t say anything about Sherlock in her statement. She said she was working late, someone hit her from behind and the next thing she knew she was waking up in the hospital.
observed was that your Hampshire accent is overlaid with more recent North American influence.  You have a soldier’s posture, and you’re of an age to have joined the King’s army before the Revolution.  You use your cane when you walk, but when you stand you place your weight evenly on both legs and not on the cane at all.  In fact when you lost your temper, you raised the cane off the ground as if you were about to hit me with it.  Wouldn’t be the first time that’s happened.”
Mindful of past errors, he’d checked with John before setting forth.  Eurus already knew of Rosamund’s existence but even hearing, let alone playing, this music would give her more information about Rosamund as a person.  What she might do with this information was anyone’s guess.  What she
Sherlock perked up noticeably, but Lestrade shook his head. “Amputated decades ago, from the look of it.  Nothing to do with the death.”
John smiled ruefully. “I thought I’d be married to the beautiful omega I’d been dating. Maybe we’d be courting a beta by now.”
John was wool-gathering as he waited for Sherlock to return when he heard the pub’s main door open and shut again.  He glanced in that direction – and froze.  For a horrible moment, he thought he was looking at his uncle Andrew.  But no, Andrew would be older now than the man who stared back at him, red-faced, sweating, a good three stone overweight and apparently just as shocked as John was.
I was using Google Street View to scope out the area around the Prospect of Whitby and discovered the Pelican Stairs.  Check out the photo at
Harry’s mouth started to tremble again, but she got control of it, sniffed, waved her wad of napkins in the general direction of her face. “Thanks.  Thanks for...”  She waved the wad over her plate and in the general direction of John’s.  He’d finished his sandwich.  She’d torn hers to pieces.  It reminded John of Sherlock.
Trigger warning: This chapter contains discussion about a past incident in which a 14-year-old and a 20-year-old were placed in a potentially sexual situation.  Neither of them wanted to be there, and no sex
After examining the corpse for a moment, John shook his head.  “No obvious signs of foul play.  If it were medically possible to die of fright, I would say that this woman has done so.”
When he descended the stairs, Sherlock was waiting for him with a cup of tea and a banana. “Breakfast.  Now come on.”
But Dexter had one more thing to say. “John? I wouldn’t be going on a date tonight if I hadn’t got up the courage to ask.”
“Which she’s never really gotten over, hence Tom. Let’s see, whom do I know who’s as little like Sherlock as possible? Short, blond...”

wasn’t your idea anymore than it was mine.  I was trying to buy us some time, maybe find a way out, and that meant convincing the doctor we’d done... what was expected.”
But Ivan was already heading down the stairs.  The door that had stood open before was now locked, and Ivan swore.  “I saw Muircheartaigh in this room.  I think he was hiding something behind the hangings.”
“The Committee...  Do its members wear posh suits and carry umbrellas and control security cameras and have people pulled off the street to be interrogated in empty warehouses?”
Sherlock lowered his voice and leaned in a bit towards Stevens.  “These are difficult times for those raised in the true faith.”
“Dr Robert Foucault,” said Sherlock, pronouncing the French r’s in “Ro-bear” faultlessly, at least to John’s ear. “Studied with Edward Blessington, who in turn was one of Dobrieuzi’s students.”
As John walked away from the scene with Sherlock and Madeleine, he remembered walking away from another crime scene. Seemed like a long time ago now.
Sherlock shifted, turning to face John more directly, pressed against him from chest to crotch now and there was no mistaking what John had done to Sherlock. And vice versa.
the best tracker, one of the toughest for withstanding any kind of physical hardship.  Our harvests failed two years in a row.  Our pregnant animals miscarried or gave birth to freaks.  Pregnant women,” she drew in a breath, let it out, “My sister died trying to birth a monster.  It died too, thank the gods.”
John hardly had time to blink before it was opened again, this time by an older woman in a purple housedress.  “I apologize for Toby’s manners, dear.  Are you here to see Sherlock?”
It was at this point that John decided that a day spent away from Sherlock would be an excellent idea.  After finishing his tea and toast, he headed over to the Cromwell to add his new phone number to his job application.  The cheerful female clerk who assisted him commented that there’d been “a lot of activity” concerning the application and then gave him a wink.
Later on, John would remember how he’d felt, running up the staircase with Sherlock and Mary. Underneath the doctor’s drive to avoid a preventable death and John’s personal horror that by inviting James to his wedding, he had delivered his commander into the murderer’s hands, the strongest emotion he felt was... joy. A bit not good, but there it was. This was what they
“All right, then, thanks.”  John turned to go – and then turned back.  “Look, Dr Hooper, I’d like to apologize for Sherlock’s behaviour earlier.  No one should be treated like that.”
, bowing, and there was this moment...  I thought he looked at me.  I thought he saw me, looking at him.  I was frozen until he left the stage.  And then I ran like hell for the loo.  Harry ragged me about it the whole way home, said I must have been desperate.”
She stepped back slightly but then snuggled in against Sherlock’s side. Dexter, on Sherlock’s other side, wrapped a proprietary arm around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock nipped Dexter’s earlobe, nuzzled Janine’s hair and smiled happily. It was... bizarre. Hot. Bizarrely hot.
.”  Sherlock smiled slowly.  “But you and I don’t need annoying distractions while we deal with the unfinished business between us.  Let him run away – or not, as you please.  And
John went to the door.  “Ladies, it’s under control.  I’ll make sure Billy’s not hurt.”  Then he shut the door and gave Lestrade a meaningful look.  Somewhat reluctantly, Lestrade released Billy.
Leaving her buckets behind, she showed Ivan to her house, small but neatly kept.  In the yard behind, a large pot of water bubbled over a fire and piles of clothes lay about, apparently waiting to be washed.  A shed to one side, and it was here that Ivan tied Bezimyan.  He unsaddled the horse and, taking up his walking stick, returned to the well.
He tasted just as good as he smelled. John was already trying to lick that taste out of Sherlock’s mouth when it occurred to him that they’d gone far past the chaste kiss that Sherlock had initiated. Reluctantly, he pulled away.
John heard the driver clear his throat behind him.  When he turned, the man was holding the rear door of the car open.
“My spouses. She’s an investment banker, he’s a PE instructor. Look, John, I’ve got people out looking. There’s nothing else you can do tonight, so go home and get some sleep. I’ll call you the moment anything turns up.”
“Sherlock, please, yes!” And then as Sherlock sank down on him, John threw back his head and yelled, “Sherlock!”
Sherlock bristled, but John said firmly, “Change starts with us. It starts with Sherlock and I sharing our daughter’s care, and there’s no limit to where it ends up. Now who’s for breakfast?”
But Mary kept talking. “I did some digging around while I was away. Sherlock may not have known what his absence would do to you – but you don’t know what he did
“I was staring at his arse.  I was staring at his front, too.  And beginning to, er, get excited.  The ballerinas were nice to look at, but this man...  He lifted the... lead ballerina?”
During intermission, John spotted a pile of brochures with the LSO’s schedule for the rest of the season. He pocketed one. If this might be something that Sherlock would like to do again, John was all for it.
Of course, Sherlock had also made John’s life hell because he trusted Mycroft and Molly and twenty-five or so tramps but not, apparently, John. Or rather, John’s acting skills. He’d needed to ensure that John would give a convincing performance of grief. John wondered if Sherlock had ever realized just how convincing that performance might have become, had it not been for Mary.
“You mean when you got me in that hold and kept me from getting away? “ Tyler put in. “Can you teach me to do that?”
It was only when Sherlock slipped his hand down the front of John’s jeans that John realized that he was achingly hard. Once they’d got the jeans and John’s pants out of the way, it hardly took two strokes of Sherlock’s large, long-fingered hand before John came as well, all over Sherlock’s stomach.
But the creature stared at Ivan with narrowed eyes, its human hands pressed together with the fingertips held to its human, lushly curved lips.  It knows I’m leaving something out, thought Ivan, and it probably knows what as well.
John surveyed the state of his miniscule wardrobe. He’d been living out of the duffle bag Mary had sent for almost two weeks, rinsing out pants and socks in the shower as needed. It was getting to the point where he either needed to buy new things or make a trip to the suburbs.
Sherlock arrived at St Bart’s morgue shortly after John, pristine, with slightly damp curls, looking... very nice. Lestrade was waiting for both of them while Molly hovered nervously in the background.
Because the toast landed on the keyboard, Sherlock noticed. He wiped crumbs out of his curls and stared at John.
“Only if you know what to steal and to whom to sell it, and only if the buyers know you well enough to trust you. Tyler,” Sherlock waited until the teen was looking at him, “You never want people in the illicit drug trade to know you that well.  Also, you should be aware that payment is often made not in cash but in kind.”
“But we should have you two over for dinner really soon!” Sherlock and Dexter nodded in support of this idea. “My place, though – no scuzz-dumps!
Sherlock didn’t wait to be asked. Greg showed up again a week later, took one look at John and swore.  “Sherlock’s right – you look like hell.”
Sherlock spoke almost as softly.  “Relationship advice, sister?”  Eurus shrugged, laid her violin and bow down, turned away.  Their conversation was over.  The matter was in his hands now.
“And then it would be good if you could distract the guards while I let myself into the keep,” said Sherlock seriously.
“Yeah, Sherlock and I have already had that talk. Once she starts crawling, walking’s not too far off. We may remodel 221C and relocate his lab there.”
The car pulled over to the kerb.  Sherlock got out and began to stride away.  The driver looked at John meaningfully and cleared his throat.  He brightened considerably when John handed him a Canadian ten.  “Thanks, mate.”
Sherlock smirked, gave a second, more exaggerated shrug and then before John could say anything, added, “Thai is fine.”
Mr Holmes helped her into her jacket. To John’s embarrassed surprise, she gave her husband a friendly pat on the backside before adding, “And I daresay so will you.”
Mary sniffed once and then put her shoulders back. “Right,” she repeated, and walked out the door, followed by Mr Holmes with the suitcase.
Smiling just a bit, looking almost embarrassed to be caught in an act of sentiment, Sherlock returned to his microscope.
They broke apart when John tried and failed to stifle a yawn. “Time to take you home,” said Sherlock lightly. And then as they walked, “Mycroft told me where to find you that evening. Blame him if you need someone to blame. He bought me the clothes I was wearing. I binned the shirt as soon as I got home.”
Dexter flushed. “Yeah, I was talking to Janine. I guess you’d deduce that. But it wasn’t... Look, Sherlock, I was pretty upset when those articles came out, and I just kind of... backed away. From everything. But I didn’t have anything to do with them, and when I thought about it, I realized I’d never heard your side of the story. Everything that was published about you using, well, us – those were just Janine’s allegations. You never responded.”
“You two are supposedly grown men and what you get up to is your own business, but I’ll thank you not to drag Billy and Archie into it!”
“That’s correct.  What we have instead is UBRnet, colloquially referred to as Uber.  It requires special hardware to access, which a foreign-made laptop wouldn’t have.  It’s of limited use in any case, as all content must be approved by the Committee.   There are at least more scientific papers posted than there used to be.”
Sherlock stole more crisps and shrugged. “This time last year you almost got burnt alive. Where did you expect to be except in ashes?”
“Thank you for waiting for us, doctor,” replied Sherlock smoothly. “I’ll get straight to the point.  The university requires all human experimental subjects to sign consent forms, am I correct?”
And if that didn’t sound maudlin and self-pitying, John didn’t know what did. Christ, he should know better than to get into this sort of conversation this late at night.  A couple of drinks, a run through the streets, a little physical danger and the next thing you know, you’re sitting in a cab pouring your heart out to Sherlock Holmes.
As a former soldier, John could recognize a losing battle. He settled in himself with the newspaper he hadn’t had a chance to read that morning.  More rhetoric – although little actual news – about the divorce laws.  South Africa and Australia were reported to be on the verge of changing their laws as well.  Canada already had.  An op-ed piece declared it highly unlikely that the States would follow suit any time soon due to the number of American politicians who drew their support from right-wing religious groups.  John thought of Campbell-Williams and set the piece aside for Sherlock.
The tower collapsed, stones sprayed across the spot where Ivan and the other two had been standing moments before.  When the ruins finally settled, everything was silent except for the snapping and popping of the remaining fires.
John’s face heated with the memory. It had seemed plausible and even admirable to him then that someone who’d found, loved and lost their soulmate would devote themselves to their work.  That Sherlock was relatively young and undeniably attractive made John’s blunder even more embarrassing.  He
Watching them through the car’s window, John asked, “Why is London like this?  It’s always been a large city, but now it feels packed to the gills.  Mrs Hudson’s got five people crammed into a space that might comfortably hold two or three.”
“Sherlock,” Dexter started off eagerly. Then he noticed John and his face fell slightly. “Uh, Dr Watson.”
have somewhere else to be, Mycroft,” said Sherlock. “Making plans for your next meal or your next war. Possibly both simultaneously.”
Mary shrugged, unruffled, and took another sip of tea. “Yes, that time. I’d estimate that the scars were less than a year old.”
she’d allowed Sherlock to check her suitcase and coat for weapons and bugs. He checked both bedrooms as well, since Mary had spent time in each, but everything came up clear.
Hours later, after John had promised Lestrade that they’d be in to give their statements the next morning and Sherlock had vehemently denied that his slashed arm required the A&E, John found himself ensconced with Sherlock in a cab, returning to Baker Street. Once upon a time he would already have been thinking ahead to how he would write this adventure up in his blog, reviewing the evening’s events, making sure he had the details correct...
“It isn’t his usual habit, but he’s allowed to come and go as he pleases. He tends to stay close to home in any case, and he’s been doing so well on the new medications, his doctor said...  Oh.”  McCaustlin stopped, looking stricken.  “It doesn’t matter now, does it?  How well he’s, he
It was already late in the afternoon by the time Ivan rode out again along the northern branch of the road.  The road carried him over rolling hills, past meadows and through woods.  The sun began to set and there was still no village in sight.
On the other side of the capital, a lone man slipped quietly out the eastern gate.  His clothes were such as a gentleman of modest means might wear, of decent enough quality but not at all striking in appearance.  His sword bore a plain hilt and a sharp edge.  He carried a pair of battered saddle bags and a walking stick of carved apple wood.
An hour later, John was on his way back to Baker Street. Seething. Dr Dixon had arrived, taken charge of the situation and got Sherlock stabilized. Then – in front of the two police constables who’d arrived to guard Sherlock’s room – she’d given John a thorough telling-off and more or less ordered him out of the hospital.
“No, of course you wouldn’t,” said John fondly, feeling the burn of the scotch in his stomach. He was far from being even tipsy.  He just felt... pleasant.  The music was pleasant, the club’s atmosphere was pleasant, even Sherlock’s disregard of personal space was pleasant.  It had been a while since he’d felt this sort of uncomplicated happiness.
The guards at least sharpened up a bit when they finally noticed Ivan, although he wasn’t sure whether they considered him a potential intruder or a welcome distraction.  There was something odd about the way they moved, as if they all suffered from slightly stiff joints.
“Not very informative, that.”  No answer.  “All right, then, you said they dance until they die.  Where does he get new ones?  Does he buy them?”
Neither of them appeared to pay much attention to their waiter, who was in any case professionally unobtrusive.
“Not quite as clear cut as that.  I did a fair bit of doctoring in the army.  Sometimes I was all we had.”
But Marfa Hudovna smiled and shook her head.  “It was his house first, dear.  I had some trouble where I was living, and...  Well, it’s a long story.  I don’t know if you care to hear it?”
The guards’ sloppy behaviour continued.  Ivan should have been disarmed but instead his sword drew only a couple of glances.  He touched the hilt and explained briefly, “Ceremonial,” then leaned more heavily on his stick.  The guards who’d bothered to look shrugged and joined their fellows in arguing over the signet ring.  Each one had to take Ivan’s hand and examine the ring closely for himself.  It was quite obvious that none of them had the vaguest idea what the tsar’s seal actually looked like, and equally obvious that none of them wanted to admit this.
Gaunt and hardened, the woman’s face still held traces of exotic beauty.  “Sarya Tyuleneva.  That’s Msti Andreyev.
There was John’s answer then.  Sherlock had a girlfriend.  You’d think he would have mentioned her before.
“Primiparas tend to be late,” John added, trying to sound reassuring. “And they also have longer labours. You’ve got a burner phone. If anything starts to happen, call either one of us and we’ll both return immediately.”
freak.  He said I was amazing and brilliant. He said it especially when my deductions drove other students to rage – or tears.  We’d go ‘round campus and find targets for me to deduce.  Then we’d go back to his room or mine, shoot up and have sex.  He wasn’t like you, John.”
Finally Ivan made a suggestion.  “Look, friends, I’ve had a long journey, and it’s getting hot standing here in the sun.  If you would let me in, you’ll be able to examine the tsar’s ring more closely and to ask me as many questions about the tsar and his court as you need to satisfy yourselves as to my authenticity.  There are seven of you, and I am but one man – and crippled at that.”
“Sterndale,” Sherlock replied.  Then he blinked.  “Oh, John, you’re here.  Why would you follow a stranger into an isolated room that could be sealed off?”
John had shot a man for Sherlock once, out of friendship and admiration and loyalty. He’d do it again. That bit was the same. But he was beginning to think his reasons have changed – or not so much changed, as grown deeper roots and more tangled branches. He had been surprised and pleased by Miranda’s attention in the pub – and then he’d almost immediately forgot about her. He’d enjoyed the assurance that he could still catch an attractive woman’s eye, but he’d been far less interested in the woman herself. What that said about him was... something he didn’t want to think about too deeply.
“You’ve heard the rest. Victor’s family wanted me arrested for murder.  The university just wanted me
When John woke up again, there was daylight outside and Sherlock was still in his bed, deep in a post-case coma. John tucked him in and went to make tea.
“The man in the grey-checked shirt towards the end of the bar has been staring at you the entire evening. He’s not drunk or unintelligent, just very awkward with women he finds attractive.  Also, he’s unbonded.  You’ll have to start the conversation, but you’ve already demonstrated that’s not a problem for you.  John?”
didn’t mention her either. He talked a lot about a meeting, but he was pretty well drugged up. You told me he had a meeting that morning as well and that was almost certainly with Magnussen. When I replayed the recording of Sherlock’s statement, it wasn’t clear whether he was talking about one meeting or two, let alone which one he was talking about at any given moment.”
“Nothing interesting,” said the technician with the headphones. “She’s lamenting that it was a waste to spill such nice wine.  He’s being a gentleman.  He’s offering her his own glass, seeing as how the waiter hasn’t come back yet.”
This time it was Ivan who started to draw back and Sherlock who would not allow it, so Ivan deepened the kiss, licking along the seam of Sherlock’s full lips until they parted.  He felt rather than heard Sherlock’s gasp as their tongues touched and stroked, as Ivan’s hands followed the rhythm of their tongues in stroking the knobs of Sherlock’s spine, as Sherlock’s hips rocked in that same rhythm against Ivan’s belly.
“Unless Wilson was willing to sell his own work at far less than its value, he wouldn’t have been doing so in his pawnshop,” Sherlock continued.  He picked up a notebook that sat at one side of the workbench and began to leaf through it.  More notebooks and equipment were stacked on the shelves that stood behind the bench.
And there was another image John’s mind didn’t need. Him and Sherlock, tangled together amidst the ruins. In his mind’s eye, they were wearing nothing but icing and crumbs.
“You say you want to marry and to settle down.  If you had to choose only one of those things, which would it be?”
It suited his purposes that his parents hadn’t accompanied him this time.  He wanted to try something new, and there was a better chance of it working without an audience.  Well, without an audience physically present.  Eurus would always be the girl who couldn’t tell which one was pain, who couldn’t tell laughing from screaming.  She might wish him no harm, she might even wish him well, but she had no intuitive way to tell the difference and might never learn to do so intellectually.
The darkness and chill of the winter evening outside were just what John needed. He walked fast but aimlessly, taking turnings at random until he found himself at the Thames. He walked halfway out on the downstream Golden Jubilee Bridge and stood for a while, watching the dark waters flow below him.
He started to walk past John, paused, and then turned and embraced him, tall and warm and indeed, quite amazing.
to be sleeping in the same room as Manya Bocharova.  He’d placed a pair of heavy buckets against the shed door on the off chance that she might come out to check on him and risked leaving his trousers outside of his bedroll along with his sword.  Now he was glad of his foresight.  When his heart slowed, he wiped himself off with a rag, lay back down and willed himself to sleep.  He had no idea what the morning might bring, but a soldier learns to sleep when he can.
By now Ivan was sure his face was scarlet, but he mustered what dignity he could.  “I’ve got a spare shirt and trousers in my saddlebags.  They’ll be too short in the sleeves and legs for Sherlock, but they might do for now?”
“There was a brawl in the local tavern.  Boris was involved.  Afterwards, one of the other men who’d been there turned up dead.  The circumstances weren’t clear and all sorts of rumours were flying about.  One of them was that Boris had killed the other man.  I couldn’t help thinking that if this were proved true, Boris might be executed for murder.”  She looked at Ivan defiantly.  “I’m not ashamed of thinking that.”
The battle that day went badly from the first.  A fierce, hot wind that filled the air with sand and dust, so that the sun looked pale and sickly.  The regiment of which Ivan and his men were part was to attack from the east, eventually meeting another regiment attacking from the west, but their maps were inaccurate and they encountered the enemy before they looked to do so.  Still they pushed onward, not wanting to fail their fellow soldiers.  Too late their scouts brought the news that the other regiment had already fallen and that the entire main force of the enemy would soon be upon them.  The commanders order that the retreat be sounded.
Outside in the foyer, a man with an Estuary accent could be heard greeting Mrs Hudson and asking if “Himself” was upstairs.  He was climbing the stairs as Mrs Hudson came back into the kitchen.
John gave an experimental wriggle towards the edge of the bed.  No luck.  He wriggled a bit harder.  Sherlock grunted, and John looked at him.  Sherlock’s open eyes were silver in the dim light.  His face was soft with sleep.
“Water, a bit of lemon. She’d already had a few drinks before she approached you.”  Sherlock hesitated ever so slightly before adding, “You were discomfited by her statement.”
“This year. Besides, I already gave Wiggins an outworn parka of Mycroft’s and a selection of Costa gift cards.”
Mary was grinning. “Let me guess. The megs said they were oppressed too and claimed that the female betaists were guilty of discrimination against their meg sisters.”
“...and I ended up back at the castle gates.  The guards spotted me and gave cry and then – something happened.  Something...”  Andreyev looked vaguely distressed.  Tyuleneva, sitting at his side, put her arm around his shoulders.  “I don’t remember.  It was a long time ago.”
Caustlin broke off as Tyler shoved his chair back, jumped to his feet and made a break for the door. Sherlock, already standing, managed to get to the door in front of him while John and Lestrade were still getting up.  The teen threw a punch at Sherlock’s face.  Untrained and sloppy, it would have done little damage on its own, but there was enough force behind it to knock Sherlock’s head against the door frame with an audible
The adults around the table frowned. “I would think,” said Sherlock, “the subject would have exacerbated his emotional state.”
Mary chuckled and drew him back to her. “I’m having you on. But really, why are you bringing up Sherlock in this particular setting?”
When John returned from his errands, Sherlock was still on the sofa but now sound asleep, curled up snuffling into the sofa cushions with his back to the room.  John couldn’t help noticing the way his dressing gown pulled taut over his nicely rounded rump.
Somehow, though, the Chinese he’d ordered with such anticipation didn’t taste the same as he remembered it. This had nothing to do with the fact that no one was trying to steal all the cashews in his cashew chicken and everything to do with... With something. He wasn’t sure what. Both the food and the telly seemed equally flat. He finally gave up on them, packing the leftovers away in the refrigerator. Let Mary see them and scold him. It was her fault for not being here. Or, no, not her
“No... Yes, actually.  Black, no sugar.”  Without further invitation, she seated herself on the sofa.  She was dressed much as she had been the day that they visited the lab, except without a lab coat over her sensible blouse and trousers.  Also, she seemed to be wearing more make-up.
Sherlock, it turned out, had travelled in Tibet. He regaled John with his detailed observations of local customs, his encounters with local cuisine...
Sherlock frowned.  “You’ve handled a gun more recently than I expected, probably the same make and model...  Oh!  Canadian Forces Reserve.”
There was a slight squeak from the whiteboard. Sherlock had scribbled a couple of characters in red marker.  They looked slightly familiar, but John couldn’t place them.  Lestrade and Caustlin looked similarly blank.  But Tyler...  Tyler had finally looked up from the floor, and his eyes were wide.
“The right partner,” replied Sherlock softly, “would indeed help me expand my repertoire. I’ll let you in on something, John.”
“That’s fine, dear, but if you’re not eating, will you at least come in and check whatever you’ve got going on in your laboratory?  There’s a very odd smell coming out of it.”
“I’ve researched dating protocols on the Internet,” Sherlock said. “This is normally the point at which we would tell each more about ourselves. Hobbies, interests, that sort of thing.”
“I’m not really, you know.” Tears were running down Mary’s face. John wondered if she realized. “Neither is he. But which one of us are you talking to, John Watson?”
What?  John stepped out of the lab into the corridor, but instead he found himself on the stoop of the house he’d shared with Mary.  Two men in black suits awaited him.
“After,” replied Sherlock, “But not for the reason you’re thinking, especially given John’s societally-endorsed obsession with colour change. I interrupted her at work when we unintentionally went after the same target.”
She stared at him and then shrugged, obviously having reached her weirdness quota for the day. “He’s the recovery area for monitoring, then he’ll be moved to a private room. You can see him –
“Mrs Antonelli,” Sherlock began, “We can’t find the murderer without sufficient information.”  His patience, never plentiful, was obviously beginning to fray.  “If you would just...”
“Set the feather down, for you’re going to need both hands.  Good.  Now place one hand on either side of the line, and pull the two sides gently apart.”
And then they all looked at each other. Such an important event, so long-awaited, and now over, thought John. The birth’s over, a new life begins. But he didn’t say so, not with Mary lying there.
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve seen others going through withdrawal before. And my own withdrawal experiences took place in quite different settings from the one shown in the film.” He continued to scrutinize John. “Did you find the love interest triggering?”
After that he was more cautious, ignoring the voices that rose and fell around him, the flickers of motion he saw in the trees.  His leg and shoulder began to pain him, the pain growing the farther he rode, but he did not stop, not even to take a moment to stretch them.
John sighed. “That’s not a reason. And if you actually hate Mycroft as much as you claim, why are you using him as an example?”
Sherlock looked aggrieved.  “I spent some time pursuing that possibility.  But no, they appear to be mobile numbers for disposable phones.  Do you notice anything else?”
Obviously taking his responsibilities seriously, Bill put down his tea and toast to hand the duffle off to John. It was heavier than he’d expected.
Closer inspection revealed that the first Mrs Holmes was Mary, now wearing a wig, suitable make-up, the clothes Mrs Holmes had worn previously and some strategic padding. She was also carrying Mrs Holmes’ suitcase.
“And I promised I’d get you there on time,” sighed Dexter, detaching himself from Sherlock with obvious reluctance and holding the door for Janine.
mind when tenants shoot the walls. Two, if you shoot Sherlock again, no place on earth will be too far away for me to hunt you down.”
, back when he’d played the clarinet in his school band. But he’d learned how to listen for the way the clarinet part fit in with the other instruments’ parts and how all the parts fit together. Living with Sherlock, he’d learned something a bit different: how to listen to solo violin.
She smiled gently, unshed tears in her eyes. “Sherlock’s right, isn’t he? This all would have turned out very differently if I’d been able to trust you.”
John had been drifting off. He was wide awake now. “We’ve already discussed this, Sherlock. No. There is not going to be a knot.”
John grinned.  “That would be hard to do.  You’re rather unique.  But...  ‘Quite an improvement’ – come on, was it really all that bad?”
Mary grimaced, but Sherlock carried on. “Once an amarsupial infant is born, the mother has to care for it entirely on her own.”
Right, trust Sherlock to be stubborn even while falling asleep sitting up.  “I’m 34, Sherlock, not 64.”
For supper that evening there was shchi and fresh rye bread.  Afterwards, they sat together, Ivan polishing his sword and Marfa Hudovna knitting.  The silence lengthened between them, but Ivan sensed that it was not his place to break it.  Finally, Marfa Hudovna sighed.
to be empty after all, hadn’t it?  Shaking his head, Ivan levered himself to his feet with his improvised walking stick and scuffed out the remains of their fire.  Then he took the small bundle of Harrieta’s jewels out from his shirt and considered the trees around him, finally hiding the bundle in the hollow of an old oak.  With this, his preparations were done.
hard, what with my hip and all.  While you’re here, do you think you might do something about the firewood?”
The ride to the university was short. When they arrived, Sherlock led the way to Dr Foucault’s office.
When they arrived at the docks, Ivan was glad not to have spent gold on wagon rides.  It was late in the shipping season, and the captains were reluctant to set forth.  It took almost all the gold and jewels Ivan carried to convince one of them to provide the company with passage home.
But he saw Sherlock freeze, just for a moment, and underneath his arm Mary stiffened ever so slightly.
They stared at each other until it finally occurred to Ivan to pull his shirt down.  He pulled his surcoat back into place, got to his feet and helped Sara to hers.  Then he paused, torn.  He didn’t like to abandon Sara and the other slaves, but Sherlock...
Police cars and yellow tape half a block on marked their destination, an alley between two buildings.  To John’s shocked surprise, the pretty, dark-skinned woman who stood guard at the tape greeted Sherlock with, “Hello, Freak.”
Marfa Hudovna smiled.  “He sees more than he says, Misha does.  He’d heard stories of you from men returned from fighting in the southern mountains, so he took it on himself to test you.  You passed, so he sent you on to Manya Bocharova, and when you passed her test as well, she sent you to me.”  She got up again and began to tend to the wood stove.
Sherlock stared a moment, then quirked a humourless smile. “Very good, John.  Yes.  Working in and selling supplies to illegal drug labs was, for some years, my favourite means of support.  I had no objection to being paid in kind, and the work was far more lucrative that picking pockets or other sorts of petty theft, although I did resort to those as well on occasion.”
Sherlock put the notebook down and ran his torch along the shelves.  He frowned at one shelf placed at waist height but hardly a hand’s breadth above the shelf beneath it.  “There was something Wilson wanted convenient to hand but not in plain sight.”  He passed the torch to John, reached into the narrow gap with his gloved hands and withdrew a large flat box of finely worked wood, which he opened.  The box proved to contain yet more precision jeweller’s tools.
“All right,” said Lestrade, “this is what we’ve got. Miranda Caustlin goes on holidays for a couple of weeks.  She returns to find a series of message on her house phone from her uncle’s caregiver.  The caregiver hadn’t seen any sign of him for a few days and was getting concerned.”
The restaurant’s delivery door opened. An elderly man, well-dressed but obviously not sober, staggered out into the alley.  John and the Yarders followed him discreetly as he moved up towards the mouth of the alley.
“Yeah, really. Because a divorce decree isn’t going to do anything about...” Harry raised her gold-banded wrist briefly.  “Turns out he can’t tattoo over it, though.  Says the ink won’t take.”
“We’re going about this the wrong way,” John declared. “We’re trying to figure out where Sherlock ran to, but the real question is, why did he run?”
“Come off it, Sherlock,” Mary told him. “He’s been spending most of his time researching, John. Started with human reproduction and branched out from there. It’s like the wedding preparations all over, except this time without serviettes.”
“Trust me, mate, I’d give anything if to see him get up and walk away from this. He could even keep the bloody... the damn evidence.”
“All the better – my reason was worth something!  Only one of those deaths was wasted, Sherlock, and that was the one
John got into the car, handed over the phone on request and sat back as the driver turned off down a side street.  John attempted to keep track of their route, but he quickly became lost in the maze.  He wasn’t even sure how long they’d been travelling when the car pulled into an almost-empty warehouse.
,” Sherlock snapped.  “Victor and I had already come close to defeating him, and I’d gained additional knowledge of the sorcerer in my travels.  I had every reason to believe that with a competent assistant, I could defeat him.  But... they kept getting captured.”
“I don’t see any need to include that statement in my report,” Sherlock assured him.  And then with a hint of a smile, “I’d assume that at least the floors were of high enough quality to be
Oddly enough, Sherlock turned slightly pink before turning away and continuing his previous one-sided conversation. “Helen Campbell-Williams specialized in the study of quantum entanglement.”
The silver-blue eyes snapped open again. “That’s not... oh.” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as John stroked the bite marks on Sherlock’s neck.
“So soon?” whined George, “Thought we might get out of here and hit a few pubs, for old times’ sake like.”
“Well, this is all wonderful, but I have a flight to catch,” said Mrs Holmes, standing up and retrieving her suitcase. “Mary?”
This detail attended to, John went to bed and slept until just past noon.  He would have slept longer except that Sherlock decided to express his frustrated impatience by torturing his violin.  John retaliated by dragging Sherlock out to go book shopping.  This worked out unexpectedly well.  Sherlock disdained any store featuring flashy displays of the latest best sellers.  Instead he took John on a tour of small used bookshops, often tucked away down alleys and in basements.  The result was a treasure trove for John, who hadn’t had access to anything published in the UBR during the past 11 years.  Even Sherlock found a volume that interested him in the third shop they visited.  Better yet, when Sherlock introduced John as his husband, the shop owners gave John discounts or waved away his money altogether.
If Ivan had any dreams at all, he did not remember them.  But he woke suddenly in the dark room.  It took him a moment to realize that what had awakened him was the sound of a door opening and closing.  He got out of bed and went to the window, discovering that it faced east and looked out upon the yard behind the house.  The eastern sky was beginning to turn from black to purple.  The first hesitant strains of birdsong were rising from the dark forest beyond the yard.  And Ivan could just barely make out the shape of Marfa Hudovna, carrying what appeared to be a small jug and a cloth bundle, making her way across the yard.  She vanished into the trees.
John hesitated, but he was curious.  He handed over a blue five-dollar bill.  The bus driver passed it on to a man with a pushcart standing just outside the door, who took it with a grin and passed back a brown paper package.  Then he pushed his cart along past the bus, moving down the road to the next stalled vehicle and the next set of captive customers.
Sherlock exited his bedroom, carrying his overnight bag. “Case.  Lancashire.  I’ll be gone three days, perhaps four.”
“Sit,” he told Mary. And when she asked why, “Because that’s where they sit. The people who come in here with their stories. The clients – that’s all
Still, John put on a brave smile as the credits rolled and Sherlock announced that he’d like to see the film again “in case I missed anything even though of course I didn’t.”
, I was able to find four posts.  One was targeted at Joe Antonelli and one at Angie Stevens.  Each of these appeared within a 24-hour period before the victim’s death.  The remaining two posts were targeted at Jabez Wilson.  The later one appeared within a 24-hour period before his death.  The earlier one appeared the previous day.”
actually occurred.  If you want to skip this chapter, all you need to know going forward is that it starts with John waking up in bed with Sherlock and ends with Sherlock asking what John was thinking about as he dealt with the afore-mentioned situation.
“And you decided it would be a good idea to confront him alone, in his own flat.” John’s voice was tense with rising anger.
“Are you sure it wasn’t someone all three of them knew?”  John found a pair of reasonably clean-looking mugs, then rinsed them out for good measure.
“Oh, yes. Worked for years with... well, I suppose that’s still classified. At least she’s never told me it’s not anymore. At any rate, she worked, I carried and raised the children she bore. She still does some consulting.”
But as Marfa Hudovna had kept watch on the tree to learn how things went with Ivan, so Ivan had kept watch on Sherlock’s heart.  He knew it beat as strongly and regularly as ever, but as to where he might find Sherlock himself, Ivan could only hope that Marfa Hudovna might be able to offer advice.
John made a show of looking at his watch, openly this time.  “It’s been an interesting evening, but I have to go now.”
“Less than half a centimetre off in any direction and he would have been dead. Even so, he’s only alive because he happened to fall backwards instead of forwards and because he didn’t go into shock. I have no idea why he didn’t. We thought... I’ll be honest.”
“I’d also advise against trying to bleach it, burn it or cut it out. Or scrape or sand it off.  Stop looking at me like that.  Doctors see a lot of things.”
It all made a horrible kind of sense, absolutely useless for pushing back the tide of anger that threatened to swamp John, to suffocate his reason. “Just as well” John had left his gun at home, Sherlock had said.
Sherlock had stopped writing and was addressing Caustlin. “Ms Caustlin, I’m implying nothing at all.  I’m merely asking questions, and I have only one left.  What colour was the new windcheater you bought Tyler recently?”
Shrugging, John put the kettle on and dug about in the cupboards, which turned out to contain a great deal of glassware and notably little in the way of food.  He did, however, find some bagged tea and what looked to be a clean mug.
“...but I appreciate the consideration. I know it was your idea, of course. Sherlock is a dear but this isn’t the kind of thing he’d think of.”
Now Sherlock looked puzzled. “John heard it when he took me to hear Vadim Repin perform with the LSO two days ago. Your forensics team failed to note that the victim has had his left little toe amputated.”
Ivan blinked.  How could the creature know so much and yet apparently fail to recognize the tsarevich’s name?  It appeared to be waiting expectantly.  “Well,” said Ivan, “I can see there’s no fooling you!”  The creature preened.  “Uh, care for some breakfast?”
“You do realize that anyone else who happens across your markings will be able to follow them back to your hiding place?” Sherlock commented.
“Perhaps that Inspector Lestrade could assign some constables as guards? Where Sherlock’s a witness in a murder case and all?”
“Sherlock, wait.” When Sherlock made to continue, Ivan grabbed him by one wing.  “Wait just a minute!  What Muircheartaigh said, about you and Victor...”
“The king and the Duke of Norfolk were already dead when Revolutionary troops captured the Duke of Clarence and hauled him to the Tower in chains.  Under threat of torture, he opened the lock to reveal – an empty vault.  An angry and impetuous soldier shot him on the spot.”
card. It would register as corrupted. But if it was corrupted, how would the security guards know it’s not Magnussen? Would they risk dragging
“It’s the fifth of November, isn’t it?” mused John as he watched them. “This isn’t where I thought I’d be this time last year.”
He had more to say on the subject, but just then the door opened slowly and a hesitant female voice asked, “DI Lestrade?” The woman who followed the voice was about John’s own age, handsome despite her reddened eyes, with straight, dark hair that fell to her shoulders.  She was wearing different clothes, a white top and dark blue slacks, but John recognized her immediately: the woman from the pub.
“Learning to dance for social purposes was encouraged – required, actually – but to perform on stage...  It’s perhaps just as well that my interests changed direction yet again.  I think, however, I can still do a pirouette.”
John took a sip from his own mug. “Does taking me to a club and buying me a drink constitute a date?”
buying synthetic hormones on the black market and dosing yourself! It’s bad enough that we have to improvise without proper medical care for Mary...”
“I haven’t bothered turning either of them back on again.” Sherlock’s smile held of touch of wickedness. “My work and I have the night off. We’re on a date.”
“So what’s the point of all this?” demanded Mary. “Is this your way of telling me you’re not going to carry my child after all? Bit late for that.”
He left the library and decided to revive himself by walking the long way back to Baker Street.  The ability to walk without pain was a treasure all on its own, not even counting the opportunity to explore and relearn the city.  He picked up milk and a few other things, including a nice piece of fish.  He was glad he hadn’t opted for liver when he arrived at 221B to find Sherlock absorbed in an experiment involving the diseased livers Molly had sent.  After some discussion, John was able to prevail on Sherlock to allow a minimal amount of space in the kitchen for John to prepare supper.
Sherlock stepped up close to John then and looked down his patrician nose, emphasizing their height difference in a way he rarely did. He aimed his words as carefully as John would aim a gun.  “My dealer was my soulmate.  Everything I wanted.”
“I don’t know how long and I don’t know whether Mr McKinsey was following chromochemical research in general or your research in particular. What I
“Some.  I’ve got a laptop around here somewhere.”  Sherlock waved a hand to indicate the sitting room generally.  “You’re welcome to have a look yourself.”
The man chuckled.  “Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?”  He looked at John sternly.  “What are your intentions regarding Sherlock Holmes?”
“He’d been doing so well on his new meds,” said Miranda sadly, so softly she was almost speaking to herself.
“Yoo-hoo! Boys?  You’ve got a visitor.  Are you dec – oh, dear.”  Mrs Hudson, already opening the door, turned to address someone standing behind her on the landing.  “Perhaps you should wait out here a moment, dear.”  A feminine voice murmured a response they couldn’t make out.
“For one thing, that would technically have been bigamy.  Easy enough to get away with given the tenuous diplomatic relations between Canada and the UBR but not an option for you, you had
A search of the Soldiers’ headquarters and bank accounts revealed a newly-constructed cell in the basement and several unusual financial transactions. Members of the group who hadn’t been in on the kidnapping plan professed themselves to be shocked and were eager to prove their innocence by providing further information.
“What did you mean by that?” demanded John, using his cane to stand up as well.  “Sherlock, what’s he on about?”
John thought about that statement. Then he thought about rescinding his previous statement that they didn’t need to discuss Victor, because he had a few things he really,
A tall, slim man in a three-piece suit stood in the centre of the area, leaning nonchalantly on an umbrella as he watched John get out of the car.  As John limped towards him, leaning on his cane, the man used his umbrella to point towards a straight-backed armless chair facing him.  “Have a seat, John.”
, as brilliant and infuriating as ever, but where once John’s silver band and Sherlock’s black one had created a convenient, reliable boundary between them, now there was... open ground.  Unmarked, virgin, waiting for its first footprint – if any ever came.
Sherlock froze, then spun around to face John. “Aren’t you done eating breakfast yet? We have beds to swap!”
“My idea, Tyuleneva, is that we’re going to be on this road together a long time.  The more we know about each other’s skills and experience, the better off we’ll be as a group.”
“I need to speak with Billy a moment,” Sherlock announced.  He let himself into 221A, leaving John to climb the stairs on his own.  He hadn’t known Sherlock was in London when he made the decision to return to the UBR.  He hadn’t thought of Sherlock at all.  In only two days, his life had reoriented itself around Sherlock Holmes so completely that it was as if things had always been this way.
“Go!” yelled Sherlock, and ran for the door himself.  The two of them pounded up the staircase, pausing for breath only when they reached the topmost landing.
She took a breath. “Mr Holmes is most definitely alive. He’s not out of the woods yet, but there’s no reason he shouldn’t pull through. I just wish I knew how he did it. He suffered a gunshot wound to the chest in precisely the right spot.”
Sherlock sniffed again, this time at nothing in particular.  “The Committee decided that too much money was leaving the country in exchange for imported tobacco.  They’ve banned tobacco products until domestic tobacco cultivation can be established.  The Semois lines are showing some promise.  In the meantime we’re expected to make do with synthetic nicotine patches.”
John, on the verge of opening his mouth with the admonishment, “Bit not good,” realized just in time that he wasn’t addressing Sherlock and kept quiet.
know, Tyler, in your own words,” Lestrade said firmly.  “You and your granduncle left his flat Tuesday evening.  Do you remember the approximate time?”
“At least not by her,” Sherlock continued.  “You were, after all, heading off to war.  None of us knew if you’d return.”  A pause.  “What were you thinking of?”
“Hell hath no fury...” murmured Mary as she flipped through a newspaper someone had left at the clinic.
Clomping footsteps sounded on the stairs, heralding the arrival of two boys, a teenager with John’s suitcase and a younger boy struggling with the duffel.
There was a brief stand-off in the office as Lestrade, John and Miranda’s son all tried to pull out a chair for her simultaneously. The son won, glaring at the two older men as if instinctively protecting his mother from their attentions. But by the time Molly returned with a round of coffees, they’d all got more or less settled.  Sherlock had chosen not to sit but rather to lean against the wall next to the whiteboard.  John figured that maybe he thought the angle was better for observation.
“Fine, spasibo – Mrs. Hudson, we’re returning to London!  But not court, it’s boring and neither of us likes it.  Will you rent us rooms at Baker Street?”
“I see,” said Campbell-Williams, looking from one to the other of the two men. She rose from her seat.  “I should be going.  Thank you both for being so candid.  Now I feel like less of an idiot, at least relatively speaking.”  She headed for the door, back straight, shoulders square.
“There’s a reason the process is called ‘labour,’” John teased. “Sherlock, you should eat something.”
“She never understood you at all, in any case,” said John, chuckling at the memory. “After we were married, I asked her what she thought about asking you to join us. She said you were only interested in being my friend and that you’d never want children. Omega intuition, my arse. She must have been quite surprised when she came back.”
But he was not a peddler. He was a French captain, sworn to conquer England for that dirty Corsican and to destroy everyone who tried to stop him, including John’s family and friends… and his very own husband.
Just when I think things are stabilizing, RL bites me in the ass. Hard. So, after yet another interminable wait, I have finally brought you another chapter. For having the patience of a saint, the award once again goes to
“Very lucky, indeed.” Sherlock relaxed his taut shoulders, then realized John’s fingers were digging into his arm. He might be able to hoax the others, but not John.
“I believe I have mistaken yours.” He walked to the door and opened it. Looking over his shoulder, he saw Greg’s face harden as John said, “I thought you cared more about your cousin than ingratiating yourself with that disgusting slug and his father.”
“Be silent, cousin.”  He motioned with his head toward Sir Albert. “Bring him along.  He apparently has information we can use.”
“Be that as it may, I will not bargain with you, Mr. Watson.” He pushed the case beneath the seat of the wagon. “Is there something else that I might interest you in buying?”
Sherlock carried the basket John had packed out of the minister’s house.  This day was turning out better than he had any right to expect.  Good!  Mayhap this ridiculous assignment was finally coming to an end. Although he did not have the answers he had been sent here to find, he made some steps toward gaining them amid this convivial atmosphere.  Lord Watson might not drink smuggled wine, but the villagers did not share his patriotic fervor.  Tow casks had been stored in the shadows of the warehouses farther along the strand, and many elbows had tilted back again and again. Mouths that had opened for wine also opened with information, and he had been happy to listen to all the men had to say amid their boasting.
John shivered, although the day was warm. Two nights ago, Frenchmen may have come to their coast. Then, last night, the smugglers had dared to bring their heinous business right to Watson Hall. This did not bode well.
“He is a man of strong loyalty and honor.  He reminds me of your uncle.”  Her smile wavered.  “I trust you will have more time together than we were given, but no matter how much you are granted, you must not let a single day pass without telling each other what your love means to you. If Greg can see his way to share that joy with Molly, I would not stand in their way.”
“Tis a fine day for such a pleasant sight. Might I show you something that could interest you?”  The alpha’s voice was smooth and rich. His verdigris eyes pinned John to the spot. John blinked slowly as he took in the alpha’s appearance.  The simple shirt, worn trousers, and scuffed boots all wore signs of his peddling life.
As he entered the small room that was so well lit the gold stripes threatened to leap off the wall covering, he listened to his father give quiet orders. He clasped his hands behind him as he heard him send several men to make sure the smugglers had left the lands of Watson Hall.
“There’s a difference.” Molly smiled. “I am happy for you and Sherlock. I could see at the wedding celebration that you have much affection for each other.”
“And how you treated him, we would both be hailed.” John smiled sadly. “You are a hero, Harry, and I appreciate it more than you can know, but I do not want Sherlock hurt in avenging me.”
He silenced his groan as John stepped toward him. Moving back to keep the distance between them the same, he heard laughter. Not from John, but from his own thoughts when he considered how his tie-mates would be amused by his resistance to this sweet pleasure. He was acting like a young omega just out of the schoolroom, afraid of the very idea of the devastating power of the desire in John’s breathless words.
Now it just made him shudder and he wished he'd taken her up on her offer. He felt detached from the person he'd been growing up, as if the memories he had of his childhood actually belonged to a stranger. There were times when he felt he could barely recall who he'd been when he'd actually been Gabriel. It had been a lifetime ago.
But there had to be times, didn't there? There had to be moments when Sam's past was taken into consideration. And then there had to be moments when people made mistakes.
Morgan returned to Ireland sooner than John expected, leaving shortly before New Year's with the two captured RIRA members who'd assaulted both him and Riley in tow. After a frank discussion with Lestrade – during which Sherlock had glowered at the DI the entire time – John had agreed not to press charges. Neither man was talking and the chances of conviction based solely on John's voice ID were slim. He'd also waited to report the attack, which would cast even more doubt on his story.
Sherlock picked up the note and took the mug into the living room. He set the mug on the coffee table but kept the note with him as he went into the bathroom and fished out a package of nicotine patches. He didn't want to use them because it seemed somehow like cheating, like he was trying to prove to John he was quitting again. But he was going to need them.
A pause so he could think made him aware of the settled silence in the house – the sounds of the street outside filtered in through the closed windows, but there was nothing else beyond that pattern of his own breathing and the faint tick of the clock on the mantle. Sherlock's eyes darted to it, trying to work out how long it had been since he'd come down here, how long since John had left.
"What evidence?" John snapped. "She faked the body the first time, and she faked the DNA the second time!"
"Sam, do you know where you are?" John repeated. Sam's eyes flickered to John and he looked confused. He let his gaze dart to Sherlock, searching the detective's face, then he refocused on John.
"Well enough for someone who survived a bomb blast, I'm sure," he replied. "In your experience, John, how do I look?"
"You're welcome," Katherine replied, rising when Irene did, leaning over to brush a kiss against her cheek. "Do come back soon."
he snapped at himself, sudden anger burning brightly again before flaring out, leaving resigned exhaustion in its wake. John slumped a bit in his chair, still staring at the clear liquid in his glass. Why should he be fair? He could hardly ask that question without also feeling guilt buried beneath it.
A thumb skimmed beneath his shirt, brushing bare skin, the faint scrape of teeth caught his lower lip – and Sherlock gave a harsh, irritated sigh when the buzzer broke through the sound of warm breathing.
The weight of John's gaze finally dragged Sherlock's attention to the doctor; John was clearly livid, chafing under the growing sense of being manipulated yet again.
"Only if he were an exceptionally capable actor able to use his skills following a severe assault. He was waiting for us to give him clues as to how to react because he does not
"Ah, the right question!" Sherlock said, and Lestrade glared at the exultation in his voice. "No idea." At this, Hassard raised an eyebrow.
"I know, I know!" Sherlock hissed. "She's not involved in this! But she told us in the hotel that she recognized the Crooked Man rhyme because she had children and the stories had stayed with her!"
"Oh, well," Sherlock replied, a smile playing on his lips, lighting his grey eyes. "Not possessive in the least, then."
, he thought vaguely, still watching Sandra, listening to her deep breathing. He remembered suddenly, a jumble of images, sounds, impressions. He'd had a flashback to the Waterloo Bridge the previous day at the Yard. Sam closed his eyes and the memories came back, but everything was confused, muddled. The order of the events made no sense and there were still blank spots so that the memories were jumpy and half formed. He did not remember actually falling and hoped he never would. He thought about the Welsh MP who had died falling from the Westminster Bridge in August and knew that recalling that would be intolerable.
he demanded, holding the phone between his taut fingers, waiting for a reply that did not come. He exhaled in a hiss and was crossing the flat before he knew it, pushing open the bedroom door, letting in a shaft of light that followed him from the living room.
She rose took a step toward the kitchen, then turned back, crouching down in front of the couch again, meeting his eyes with her even gaze.
"You get fidgety when you don't eat," Sherlock murmured vaguely, attention absorbed in emptying the bag, piling the equipment – if it could be called that – on the desk, except for the biscuits, which he stacked on one another with worrying precision.
Irene nodded, glancing at the photograph again. She'd known Jim Moriarty a long time, long enough that, without having seen him in over a year and without ever having known him as a child, she could recognize the man he would grow into in those childhood features.
It certainly would for how Sherlock felt him about him – and his things, and his time, and his personal space. The smile was back on the detective's lips; John traced it with a thumb, watching a shadow of desire flicker for a moment. Amazed that it was his, telling himself not to be so stupid about it ever again.
He couldn’t believe this was entirely coincidence. Richard Mitchell had worked for Jim, at least for a short time.
McKinney looked up at him quickly, stunned into immobility for a moment, then dropped his phone without question, breaking into a run as soon as he'd cleared the doors. Mycroft heard shouts and panic behind him but ignored them, racing through the doors and out onto the pavement, slowing for a precious moment and squinting into the dull sunlight that filtered through the blanket of clouds.
They were greeted cheerily by a constable who recognized John and checked the gifts before he went in. Sherlock gave his husband a quick kiss before settling into one of the chairs in the corridor, phone already in hand, eyes intent on the small screen.
"Is it?" she asked, turning her suddenly sharp, dark-eyed gaze to him. "A mystery novelist compared to a London Met DI, a genius detective, and a military doctor? One person compared to three?"
, John," Sherlock muttered. John tilted his head back and met Sherlock's eyes. The doctor nodded; there hadn't been a case since late November and that had been a fairly simple one tracking down a man trying to steal his soon-to-be-ex-wife's jewellery.
The command rooted Sherlock, his body obeying without any input from his mind. Part of him was alarmed at how well it worked, how readily he responded to John's military voice, the tiny piece of resentment swallowed by the ability to refocus, and by the fact that he knew John would never do this to him in public, never let his weaknesses show.
"I'm here to see Alexandre Georges," Sherlock snapped, and John knew full well the English was for his benefit. His partner's aptitude for languages had ceased to surprise him, but the protective – almost proprietary – reaction did.
I didn't tell John because John was away! The last time John was away without me was three weeks and two days ago – he and Harry took their mother for a weekend holiday in Scotland. The time before that, four months, one week, and one day ago, for four days for some ridiculous conference in Coventry. The time before that–"
John glanced through the window on the landing, but could not see the stableyard from where he was.  He needed to go into one of the rooms on the east side of the house if he wanted to check on whether Sherlock’s wagon had returned to Watson Hall.
He saw something flicker in Mr. Holmes eyes. Impossible! It could not be amusement when he must be suffering so much pain. Or was this injured arm just another of his half-truths? Shame flooded him when another groan slipped past his rigid lips.
John glanced at Sherlock, knowing he must have heard the cart approaching while John had been lost in his spellbinding touch. He wanted to say something, anything, to keep this moment from ending, but as Sherlock turned to speak with Harry who bounced up the steps, John knew the magic had already ended.
She shrugged. “No one seems to know. Mr. Jensen was guarding him today, and he said nothing seemed amiss. The prisoner apparently made no sound all afternoon, but he rarely said much in English.”
Her nose wrinkled as she stared at his rumpled shirt and waistcoat and breeches, all of which showed the wear from his journey about the bounds. “We must rectify that with all due haste.”
Putting a finger to her lips, Molly slipped her arm through John’s. She led the way back down the hill as she spoke softly. “I know that, but I did not want everyone to know what we spoke of.”
John sank onto a stone bench, only to immediately come back to his feet. His disquiet would not let him sit and think. He wandered off the terrace and into the gardens. When he saw the carriages awaiting Father’s guests, he turned and walked in the other direction. Hopefully by the time he lapped the house they would be gone. If he walked three times around the house, would the fairies come and spirit them away?
Sherlock sighed when John suddenly pushed himself out of his arms. An expression stole the last glitter of delight from his eyes, which closed again when Sherlock bent to kiss his cheek. John’s fingers clenched at his sides, warning Sherlock of how hard he was fighting his craving –
“You are most welcome,” John said, although he truly wished to ask what was in the packet. He hadn’t been inquisitive about it until he saw Mr. Jensen’s odd behavior. Although he wanted to wait and see what was within it, he said only, “Good afternoon, Mr. Jensen.”
“It does make sense. The Moran’s would provide well and you would be close to Watson Hall.  If Uncle accepted Doctor Sawyer’s offer you’d be halfway across the shire!”
“Greg, I think it would be best if we were to discuss this another time.” He glanced past him, and Greg looked over his shoulder.
Going down to the breakfast room, he hoped to be late, so he could avoid his family. Instead, when he paused in the doorway, he found them waiting for him, as unspeaking as Elsa had been. Was this his punishment for hypocritical vows? To lose the closeness of his family?
“Your father is most interested in the pistol.” He chuckled. “And he is an exceedingly kind host, offering his wine to a stranger.”
Sherlock was not surprised when he did not return the offer to use his given name. “Do you need to be somewhere just now, Mr. Watson?”
John wanted to agree with him fervently, but Greg gave him no chance as he slapped the side of the carriage to let the coachman know they were ready to go.  As the carriage bounced out onto the road in front of the manor house, John clenched his hands in his lap. So many questions he wanted to ask. Some Greg could answer. Even more, he could not.
As John’s fingers combed through Sherlock’s dark curls, he knew he was silly to become part of this madness. He did not care, for he was lost in the enchantment Sherlock spun with his touch which lured John to make his fantasy of being in Sherlock’s arms, savoring his kiss, come true. Sherlock’s fingers played along John’s cheek, creating a melody he heard in his heart. As Sherlock’s mouth lowered toward his, John’s eyes closed in sweet surrender.
He held his arms close to keep them from being snatched by the briars growing under the trees. This must be Mr. Wilson’s copse. He did little to maintain his land, preferring to spend his time at the inn near Mr. Jensen’s warehouse. His heart slowed its frantic pounding as he rushed through the wood. The shadows were like furtive breaths of cold are, but he shrugged them off. Nothing could be icier than his heart at the thought of mating Sebastian Moran. Suddenly, John’s hand was grasped. With a cry, he tried to pull away. He could not let Sebastian find him here alone. John was not sure what Sebastian would do in his determination to force him to be his mate.
“No.” He looked back to see Sherlock in the doorway. His face held a smile appropriate for an Alpha who had made a good marriage that day. “There he is.”
Auntie chuckled. “I have to say I would have made much the same choice myself, although Mrs. James should recall her manners.” Without a pause, she added. “When do you anticipate Sherlock returning here?”
“I have no idea what a peddler should know. To be honest, Mr. Holmes, I doubt if you have any idea what a peddler should know.”
John exchanged another glance with his friend. Molly's eyes were wide with a dismay that echoed the feeling that raced through John. “Why?” He asked again.
Sherlock edged back into the shadows. He had thought Lord Watson was not considering Sebastian Moran’s suit, but it appeared that he was. Perhaps the baron had not noticed how his son cringed when Moran was present.
John’s fake smile made his face ache as he thanked him. He was glad for anything that gave him an excuse not to look at Sherlock. At
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he walked over to John.  Because John stood on the steps, he had to look down to meet Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock’s attempt to smile froze into an uncomfortable grimace when he answered, “It is clear that you have never had to endure a single hour in a cell, eager to taste the sweet flavors of freedom again.”
“All we need now is Harriet.” Aunt Hudson continued, setting herself on her feet and walking spryly to the door.
John glanced, astonished, at Mr. Holmes, who was sitting, his face as gray as the stone walls of Watson Hall, with his right arm cradled in his left hand. Pouring a glass of wine from the decanter his father always had waiting for unexpected guests, John held it out to him.
His heart skipped a beat, sending pain throbbing through him. “Heard?” he whispered. Maybe he was not the only one to stumble upon the French patrol in Mr. Anderson’s barn.
“You are welcome to enjoy the gardens during your stay here tonight,” he said to Mr. Holmes as he walked past.
Greg spun John toward him. When he was about to protest, Greg’s fierce expression silenced him. With an intense tone he had never heard in Greg’s voice, he snarled, “This is no lark, John! Reverend Hooper’s waiting downstairs for you and Sherlock to stand before him and take vows of fidelity for the rest of your lives. The rest of your lives! You have been rash before, cousin, but think before you agree to something as want-witted as this.”
Although he wanted to tell Greg how desperately he hoped he could be right, he said, “I had no idea you were an expert on marital matters.”
He swept John up against him as he captured his lips. All John’s fantasies of this moment vanished, weak shadows compared to this glory. The tip of Sherlock’s tongue brushed his lips, sending quivers of sensation to the very tips of his toes.
“Is that where you are hying to like a frightened rabbit seeking its hole in a hedgerow? When I saw you at a near run across the field – “
Sherlock’s fingers brushed John’s cheek, and he looked up to see sympathy in his eyes. “I thought you knew,” he whispered.
“Well, that ruined a perfectly good Vivienne Westwood.” He pushed his finger through the hole in his jacket and laughed. “Running out of options, Sherlock? Now that John’s dead, you could always just kill yourself. Why don’t you jump? It’d be just like old times; you and me, coming full circle. So romantic, don’t you think?”
“Even when both your aunt and your father let that fact slip into conversation?” He shook his head. “No, your father may have let it slip. Your aunt, I believe, intended for me to know that.”
“No?” Sherlock repeated with an arching of his eyebrows? His expression bespoke his disbelief louder than a single word.
He realized how much he had hoped Auntie had misunderstood as he rushed across the garden and then slowed to stare at Sherlock, who was testing the brake on his wagon, looking under it to be certain it was now working. How skimble-skamble could he be? Auntie was never confused about anything. She always saw everything with a clarity that John envied.
“As do I.”  Sherlock drew a piece of cake out of the basket.  “I wasted that evening I could have spent with you, being miserable because I didn’t want to be falling in love with you.”
John was pulled away, and he raised his fist to make sure Sebastian did not hurt him – or Sherlock – again. His eyes widened as he discovered that it was his father who held him. Slowly he lowered his hand to his side.
In disbelief, he stared at Mr. Cole.  He knew all of the dozen or so men standing on the road.  They were all from the village. More than half of them were men his father had identified as possible smugglers.
“You are in excellent spirits,” John said, startled by how easily Sherlock accepted that he no longer wished to speak about the previous subject.
John smiled back. It was easier than he had guessed. He was tempted to throw his arms around Father and spill he truth – all of it. He had not been Sherlock’s lover, not before the wedding, not after, but he feared he was falling in love with a man who had already told him he was going to leave him.
“Cheeky. You are better on the eyes than the usual hawkers who wander through the shire.” Appraising him without apology, she smiled. “I can see why John is all atwitter today.”
Something warned John that he was no longer alone.  More than once, he suffered uneasiness while walking in the garden this afternoon as he waited for the time to meet Aunt Hudson in town. He suspected it to be no more than his imagination being fired by the smugglers’ attack last night. John hadn’t expected them to be so brazen. If he had not chanced by, Mr. Holmes’ wagon would be stripped clean… and Mr. Holmes would be gone.
He had his host’s complete attention now. As the tall baron came to his feet, Lord Watson asked, “Any news of an invasion?”
“One does not need to be involved in espionage to hear such rumors.”  He gave John a wry smile. “I can now tell you  on my first night here I thought my men had come to speak with me, and you interrupted them by my wagon.”
“Father said this must be done right from this point forward.” Harry colored nearly to the shade of her scarlet waistcoat. Offering her arm, she asked, “Will you let me escort you to Father?”
John hoped he had washed away all the dredges of tears from his face. As he came down the stairs, he was glad that the house seemed empty. He didn’t even meet a servant as the distant rumble of thunder heralded another storm about to descend upon Watson Hall.
John shuddered as Sherlock said the words he’d not dared to even think. “You do not know what you are talking about. You are a stranger here at Watson Hall.”
“You’re right about that,” Sherlock murmured, “but I was speaking of the lack of choice I have in keeping you out of my thoughts, John.”
“He does.” John was relieved to speak the truth. Even though he was unsure about loving Sherlock, he was certain that his life would be empty without him in it. He flinched and glanced back at the altar. Sherlock had said his life would be here now, but for how long? So many times, he had spoken of his love for his free life upon the country lanes.
John ran his hand along the uneven stones of the wall. Glad that most of those beating the bounds were either far ahead or far behind them, he tried to think of something to say to refute Molly’s words. Three was nothing, and, if a minister’s daughter and baron’s nephew were not an acceptable match, how much worse was it that John thought constantly about Sherlock?
“She hasn’t done anything to stop her yet.” Sherlock smiled and reached for the plate of cakes. “Would you like one, John?”
“Yes, you can.” John flung his hand out. “Just walk out the door and never come back. That will end this.”
“But if your father chooses not to buy, then I’ll owe your family for my stay. I agree with Polonius when he said, ‘neither a borrower nor a lender be.’”
He stared, as he backed away in one slow step, at the green and black pantaloons visible beneath the heavy greatcoats. When one man pulled a pistol from beneath his coat, John saw the flash of chevrons on the green sleeve of his uniform.
“And she hasn’t stopped her?” John had expected Aunt Hudson to speak her mind on this as on everything else. Mayhap Harry would heed their great-aunt.
John asked himself what he had expected. Sherlock had told him that he was not going to explain why he had come in this way. His shoes were covered with sand, so maybe he had wandered far and gotten lost. That did not seem right. He was a peddler. He should know how to find his way.
“Not exactly, for the prison hulks float offshore.” His gaze turned inward. “You cannot guess what a man will do for a chance to see the sun upon his face again. When I managed to get free, I took to this life upon the road, wanting to get my surfeit of sunshine. In the year since, I have struggled to get the odors of death and sickness out of my senses. I want to be able to close my eyes and not see the ragged remains of men who are only half alive, for they have lost all hope of escape from that torture.” His hand cupped John’s cheek. “I pray you will never understand what it is like, my heart.”
John wanted to answer, but sighed as the tip of Sherlock’s tongue outlined his mouth which hungered for his kisses. He wove his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, drawing his mouth over his. Their breaths mingled as Sherlock’s tongue sought to explore every luscious secret in John’s mouth.
Sherlock took John’s hand as they reached his bedroom door. “I know it’s tradition to carry an Omega over the threshold but I hope you’ll understand why that would not be a good idea.” He rubbed his shoulder.
“His comrades?” Sherlock lost his nonchalance. “What makes you think his comrades are still nearby?”
John did not answer his question. To speak of how he was hurt by Sherlock sending him away when they had such a short time to spend together would make the situation worse. Sebastian did not want to hear how he was weeping inside at the idea of Sherlock’s leaving. So instead of the truth, he spoke of the weather, of the search for the escaped French prisoner, of the recent bountiful catch brought in by the village fisherman.
John stared down at the knife, but could not lift his hand to cut the cake. When Sherlock’s fingers covered his once again, he looked up at him. He owed him more than his sanity, which would have been in jeopardy at the Morans’ house. He owed Sherlock his life.
Harry bounced to her feet. “We cannot cancel the beating of the bounds this year. I promised Hugh Thomas that I would remember him at each of the boundary markers this year.”
Greg shuffled his feet as if he were the guilty one. When he raised his eyes, John saw he was uncomfortable with him as Greg had never been. Tears pricked John’s eyes. The most horrible legacy of these lies might be that he was ripped away from his beloved family.
The sergeant hesitated. When Sherlock repeated the order in a sharper voice, the man stomped over to the others. They bent their heads together, staring at the map before them, but John knew the topic of conversation was their captain’s unexpected Omega.
The musicians, two fiddlers and a drummer from the village, called for a break.  Auntie smiled as John sat on the ground beside her chair.
Again the day was gray and damp and clammy. Pulling his coat more tightly around him, he walked down the steps. John realized that more than a dozen of the usual leaders were missing. They must be inside with Father in his office on the ground floor of the Hall, discussing why the authorities had not come to get the prisoner.
“Of an invasion force from France floating just out of sight in the Channel?” When John turned to Sherlock, his eyes wide, Sherlock laughed. “Don’t look at me as if I read your thoughts. I know what is on every mind along this shore, for I have heard uneasy conversations over and over as I have traveled. There is nary a soul here who does not fear that Napoleon will throw his army upon these strands.”
Also, thank you to those who were so patient through the wait between chapters. Life got real and motivation was sorely lacking.
A familiar laugh halted his panic. John looked up into Sherlock’s sparkling eyes. When Sherlock motioned for John to continue among the trees with him, he smiled.
He did not speak the thought aloud, for he suspected that the light in Mr. Holmes eyes would vanish again and he would be facing that uncompromising stare once more.
He relaxed back against the seat and shut his eyes. He wished he knew what would happen now. How could he explain Sherlock’s absence to his father and family when Sherlock did not return to Watson Hall? Unlike his husband, John was not skilled at lying, but he guessed he soon would be unless he wanted to watch him hanged as a spy.
"Sherlock,  I need you to calm down love. Look at me." John's face appears in the space above Sherlock's head.
He was surprised, now that he thought of something beyond his despair, that Sir Albert had not called already. Or had he, and he had not taken note? Impossible! No one could fail to take note of Sir Albert Moran. He would not allow that.
“Yes, and, as you could tell that I longed to be with him, I could see that you did not want to be with Miss Donovan.  You kept her distant.  You did not look at her more than propriety required, and you heeded not a word she spoke.”
For a long moment, he held his breath, he feared Mr. Holmes would not accept his falsehood. He should have kept his mouth in check, instead of blurting out his misgivings. Then Mr. Holmes hold on his arm loosened to a gentle caress, sending a thrill of delight through him. John moved away, for that was more frightening than his anger.
“You are wasting your time in trying to sell something to me today,” he said as he stepped down onto the road. “I have no- Oh! Mon Dieu!”  He gasped as he realized the drop to the road was greater than he’d anticipated.
He must get rid of the horrible habit that had been such a joke just a few months ago when there had been no threat of invasion. “Release me, and I shall answer your questions!”
is my beacon of guiding light. She's always amazing about getting my chapters back and being an outlet for drama and giggles.
With a sigh, John knew he would not have done that, even if he were not obligated to Sherlock. Father insisted on treating everyone under the roof of Watson Hall with respect.
“Your errand must be one of great urgency if you are even considering going through that.” He fingered the fabric of John’s sleeve.  “You shall quite ruin your handsome jacket.”
Leaning across his bed, he stretched a trembling hand out to Sherlock. When his hands found nothing on the chaise longue, his fear deepened. Where was he? From the lack of light, he knew the moon must have set. Sherlock should have been back hours ago.
John shuddered. “Neither father nor son, but Sherlock, your determination to protect me has led you to do another very foolish thing.”
“I stand corrected.” She linked her arm through John's. “Perhaps you and I should go to London next Season.”
John shook of his hand. Maybe he had taken a knock in the cradle, but he did not care a rap what Sebastian Moran thought. He was about to say that, then saw a shadowed form in the doorway to the ballroom. Sally Donovan! The young woman had earned a reputation as the worst prattle-box in the shire.
Not wanting Sherlock to guess his thoughts, although John was sure he knew exactly why his smile refused to be hidden, he said, “I see Harry convinced you to shoot with him.”
Coming to his feet, John said, “ You must leave, Sherlock, before you play a part in destroying my family.”
He feared Sebastian would not release him, but slowly his fingers unwound from John’s wrist. He strode to the door and, not even waiting for the footman, opened it and then slammed it behind him.
Sandwiching John’s hands between his, Sherlock asked, “I trust I did not disturb you when I left the room this morning. You were asleep, and I did not wish to wake you
“If you are right, John,” Greg said, “nothing will happen, and we will return to Watson Hall on the morrow.”
When he offered his arm to Molly, John smiled at his friend before glancing at Sherlock.  John thought he would follow them, but Sherlock held back.
A clock rang from somewhere in the house. “I fear I shall be late, because I must give my friend Molly a look-in before I meet the mail coach at the inn, so I must ask you to excuse me.”
He flung his arms around his father as he stared at the Alphas gathering around the wagon. Some from the stables and those from the village; Harry and Greg were there too. They all stared at Mr. Holmes who didn’t move. Was he dead? Had he died saving John?
would be interested in partnering with him on the dance floor. With him, Sherlock would not be interesting in dancing a country reel, but a waltz, which he knew would be considered scandalous here in daisyville.
“Nothing makes sense any longer. Nothing has made any sense since you came into my life.” John’s voice softened to a husky whisper. “Nothing but being in love with you. Sherlock, I have tried to turn aside this longing in my heart, but it will not heed me. My heart is yours. Mayhap it is senseless, but I do love you.”
"That's good to hear but I'm sure you won't mind if I double check that diagnosis with my medical degree, now will you?"
Taking John’s arm, Sebastian shoved him ahead of him toward the garden. He grumbled, “You let him give you orders as if you are the peddler and he is of the ton?”
“John,” Lady Hudson crowed, “you didn’t tell me he was this pleasant on the eyes. My boy, no wonder you are as skittish as a man hiding under his mistress’s bed when her Alpha is at the door.”
“That is Father’s concern, not yours.” John smiled at him. “You would be better concerned for what Father thinks of all your recent calls to Miss Donovan.”
“I must be ready to defend what I believe is right.” Sherlock brushed his fingers against John’s cheek in the way he loved. “However, I do not see it as the path to glory.  I have been trying to persuade Harry of that, too.”
“You wish me to believe you just happened to be walking through the rain?” the man continued. With a laugh, he switched to French, “Bring him to the captain.”
His simple question drove a shaft into Sherlock’s heart, and he fought to pay no attention to the pain. He must not heed that organ which could betray him far too easily when he gazed into John’s colorless face. It would beseech him to ease his fears by telling him the truth… all of it. The truth of how, each night, he had leaned back on that chaise longue, which was a foot too short for him, and listened to John try to sleep. Even when John had found escape from the need tangling them together in a snare neither could flee, Sherlock had not been so fortunate. Then he had been taunted by the soft sounds of John’s breathing while Sherlock imagined his breath coming quick and uneven as he swept him into his arms and held him in bed.
As soon as Sherlock closed the bedroom door behind them, John said, “You should not have come back here.”
John could not help but return the smile. Sherlock Holmes was certainly unlike any peddler he’d ever met before.  He was as eager to sell as any who’d come before, yet he spoke like an educated man. He glanced at the many books strewn about the wagon. Perhaps between the books and conversations with his customers he had managed to gain somewhat of an education.
“Of course.” Mrs. Carson smiled a greeting as she passed the cousins coming in the door. “Hush now, you two. You know his lordship likes the house quiet in the hour after tea.”
John smiled, though it took all his strength. It had been almost a month since Sherlock had saved him from the smugglers. In that time, the smugglers had remained out of sight, sneaking about to do their dirty tasks, and Sherlock had sneaked into his thoughts. John was no more successful in banishing Sherlock from his mind than Father had been at stopping the owls.
“He never mentioned anything about not coming.” John kicked a pebble ahead of him. “I am sure he will be at the ball tonight.”
“Yes. It shocked me when I confronted my men about their stupidity in coming here and I learned they had obeyed orders to stay away from any of the houses along the shore. I guess you were quite the hero in keeping the smugglers from their mischief.”
“No wonder everyone expects an announcement.” Sherlock’s voice was laced with laughter as he walked with John along the hall toward the rear of the house. “He acts like the bridegroom who is eager to get through the ceremony to have his wedding night with his mate.”
Sherlock put his arm around John. When John stepped farther within that haven, Sherlock smiled. “Our wedding. John is now my mate.”
Sherlock smiled. He understood the question for what it was. A query less about a weary traveler and more about what news might be had and from where.
Edging away a step before he gave in to the temptation to move closer to Sherlock, John walked toward an abandoned stone wall that was nearly as tall as his shoulder. It was pitted from rain and wind.
Until John looked into his eyes. Even though so much of what he saw there was baffling, as always, the twinkle that brightened them when Sherlock looked at him was irresistible, tempting him to forget all the reasons this ceremony was wrong and consider all the ways it could be so very right.
“So you’ve said over and over.” John frowned at him. He was talking in circles, which was even more irritating than Sherlock’s habit of doing so when he first arrived at Watson Hall. Sherlock had been hiding something then.  Was Greg hiding something now? “It might be that simple if you would explain what you mean.”
Sherlock turned his head and pressed John’s palm to his lips. The motion was not inappropriate, but the fire burning in his eyes was intensely intimate. John could not doubt what he was thinking. Sherlock regretted, as John did when he touched him so sweetly, that their marriage was one of appearance only.
“I have found that is the way to learn things.”  Sherlock picked up his cup again and took a sip. The blend was not strong, the leaves likely reused to save Watson Hall’s precious stores. “Harry calls me Sherlock. Will you, too?”
“I had guessed they would be here as soon as word reached them.” John frowned. “How long can it take for a message to reach Dover and a detachment to arrive in the village?”
“Sherlock, no!” John cried as his words cut through the haze of his distress. A flush climbed his ashen cheeks. Was Sherlock out of his mind? To give the lie even the least credence would destroy Sherlock.
John started to tell him that was ridiculous, then realized Sebastian might take his answer as a vow that he had a
“He does not want me to make the same mistake you and Sherlock have.” Her brows lowered, giving her the appearance of their father, a resemblance he had never seen till now. “But I am not sure he believes your story, John. I’m not sure I do either.”
“Sherlock stood and, placing a finger beneath John’s chin, brought his face up to meet Sherlock’s furious eyes. “He shall never threaten you again, or I shall have the pleasure of taking him apart piece by piece. Not even this blasted shoulder shall halt me.”
A few hours later saw John still pacing through the house. Father had guests that evening, a few men from the village seeking guidance on issues of property lines and ancient water rights. Because he took his obligations so seriously, John could not imagine intruding on such a meeting, although they seldom lasted this long.
He smiled as he stood. “That smuggler treated me with the lack of manners I would expect of his ilk.”
“And John tells me, that you have a pistol in your cart of rare quality that he believes would make the perfect gift for my alpha child.”
The man boldly swung through his window, landing with cat-like quiet on the floor. When he started to walk past him, John pulled the poker back, aiming for the center of his back.
He stared at John in disbelief. His hands slipped up from his shoulders to cup his face. If Sherlock had chanced upon him even a year ago, he would not have hesitated to accept this invitation, but he was not the same man he had been a year ago. Too much had happened to change him.
“You were not supposed to fall in love with me, John.” Sherlock sighed. “Nor I with you. When that happened, I knew I was caught in my own trap. The charade was becoming real. Since our marriage, I woke every night I was in this room and watched you sleeping all alone in your bed.”
“Don’t, Sebastian.” John stepped away. When he saw Sebastian’s face grow taut with fury, he backed even farther away.
“I am not holding him, sir.” LaVelle gave him a sharp shove forward. “Go, Omega! Captain Huillet wants to talk to you. Find your tongue, for he shall have no patience with your muteness.”
Lifting John’s hand to his lips, Sherlock kissed each finger.  John leaned his head on Sherlock’s chest as he had longed to do and listened to the uneven beat of his heart. This was not easy for either of them. He’d wanted Sherlock to be honest with him, but John could not be completely honest with Sherlock now. He did not want him to go.
Although almost a week had passed since the capture of the French soldier, a sensation of disbelief still gripped the village. Rumors had skulked around the village for months about the possibility of an invasion, but this reality sent waves of fear, as savage as a winter storm tossing the ocean upon the strand, through every resident.
John shook off that nagging thought.  Today might be his last day of happiness for a long time, and he wanted to enjoy it.  “Greg asked me to smooth your meeting.” He chuckled. “I believe he wants to make this day special for both of you.”
The sun began to pierce the mist, jeweling the landscape as if dozens of fairies had sprinkled their dust upon the grass and the stone walls. The markers themselves became dull as the dampness was rubbed away when the children beating the bounds for the first time tried to read the inscriptions. The lettering had almost disappeared beneath the assault of the sea wind and rain through the years. Laughter marked each time a child was remembered at the markers with a swat on the backside or by being held upside down while reciting the landmarks that lead to this stone.
Faster than he had guessed Sir Albert could move, he had leaped forward and grabbed John’s arm. Before Sir Albert could tug John toward him, Sherlock’s fist struck his wrist with a sharp whack. Sir Albert screeched, but released John.
“I…” John trailed off as his gaze rose over the fine line of the peddler’s high cheekbones. Lord, but he was tall.  Taller than he’d realized from the berm next to the road. Certainly taller than his father and taller even than Sir Albert Moran, Sebastian’s father.
When Sherlock whispered his name, John opened his eyes to find that Sherlock had climbed the narrow steps to the one just below him. Again he had to look up into Sherlock’s eyes. As Sherlock’s fingers curved down over John’s shoulder to inch closer, the day’s mist vanished and he was caught up in the golden light sparkling in his eyes.
John realized he had spoken the last word aloud when Sir Albert smiled and said, “Because you were supposed to be mine.”
“If that is what you want.” John was not sure what else to say. Maybe he had done something wrong, but how could there be anything wrong about something which was so glorious?
“The only invasion that matters to me right now is how you invaded my heart.”  Sherlock leaned him back against his arm.
His hand upon John’s arm halted him from walking away. He turned him to face him. In the dim light from the stable lantern, Mr. Holmes eyes sliced into him like silver daggers. “What in blazes is that supposed to mean?”
He slipped his fingers through John’s, and he glanced up at him with a smile that was more intoxicating than any wine.  If things had been different… How many times had he thought those words? If things had been different, Sherlock might never have chanced to meet John. If things had been different, he would not have to see the fear dimming John’s luminous eyes.  If things had been different, he would not be sleeping each night on the chaise longue.  Instead, he would be sleeping beside John in his bed.
If they even considered coming here, they must be met with every possible resistance. The Frogs could not win as much as a grain of English sand.
peddler, but John only nodded as he went back out into the sunshine. Steering the cart he had driven from Watson Hall along the cobbled street that led up from the harbor, he was glad to reach the neat stone house where his best friend lived.
“People will choose to believe what they wish, no matter what any of us do. I truly think Sebastian has come to believe his absurd assumptions.”
Sherlock glanced along the road, and his stance abruptly resembled that of a stag pausing to listen for the hunter. Then he smiled. “You chose the very best time to visit your friend. Sir Albert just left. You must have passed him along the road.”
“I shall endeavor never to forget what I should do.” His strained voice startled him as much as it must have his father whose eyes grew round in surprise. John wanted to retract his cold words, but it was too late.
Mr. Donovan did not allow him to turn back to his carriage. When he tugged John toward the other carriage that was a gray shadow in the dim afternoon light, he looked over his shoulder. “Greg!” he cried.
John had been about to ask his father about the patrols, but Sherlock’s answer silenced him. He was enjoying this hoax far too much. Yet, if he denounced Sherlock, he would have to own that Sherlock intended to annul their marriage. John was not sure what his father might insist upon them. He could not believe that Father might wed him to Sebastian, but everything seemed so peculiar.
John frowned and motioned the plate away.  “You seem to have acquired Auntie’s unfortunate habit of enjoying gossip.”
Seizing John’s elbows, Sherlock tugged him down next to him. He pinned John’s left hand against the blanket as he lifted the other against his chest. An involuntary gasp of pleasure burst from John’s lips as the unyielding muscles moved beneath his touch.
Giving Mrs. Carson’s list to Harry, he said, “Tell Father we must prepare to send an order to London for these items.”
“For me?”  A childish delight brightened her eyes. She bent to read the list, giving John a chance to leave with Greg.
Sherlock smiled, but it was the coldest smile John had ever seen. “Oh that, you’re right. Mayhap someday I will be able to claim that title.”
He grasped the handhold in the carriage as the road dipped sharply toward the sea.  Glancing out, he saw the gentle rain tapping the leaves of the trees. He hoped this shower would blow past quickly.  He did not like to think of Sherlock out in a storm, although John guessed he had weathered many before he came into his life.
Something must have alerted John to his stare. Could it be that he was no more unaware of him than Sherlock was of John? What should have been a stolen kiss to ease their curiosity had instead drawn them even closer together.
This time, he could not conceal his reaction.  When he drew in a frantic breath, he knew Greg had seen the truth on his face as well.  He never had learned to think before he acted. He should have been prepared for this question, instead of lamenting how far Sherlock was from his arms.
That was the wrong thing to say, he realized when her eyes narrowed. “I thought you vowed not to speak to Mrs. James after she aimed her demure hits at you whenever she had the chance at the Donovan’s musicale.”
“You do not love me, either.” He sat on the chaise longue and tugged off his left boot. Again he tugged off massaged his shoulder. “Dash it! I am beginning to believe this will never be the same.”
“But I have done nothing to ruin my reputation.” John gripped Sherlock’s arms and wished he could shake some sense into him. He always had been so reasonable, logical. This was the wrong time to change. “Why won’t you tell father the truth?”
He was somewhat surprised to find that the man working at the desk looked little like John Watson. The father was tall, thin boned, and pale while Mr. Watson had been small and golden as a ray of sunshine. What remained of Lord Watson's hair was a dark gray, where Mr. Watson's had been blonde. Only their storm blue eyes were similar.
They neared the morning room. From it came joyous voices. When Reverend Hooper and Molly continued into the room, Sherlock slowed.
“I have learned with experience that the best negotiations are those done with at least an appearance of camaraderie.” Watson filled his own glass and sat again. “I would like to see this pistol that my son has praised so highly, Holmes.”
He had not gone to look Sherlock in the card room off a back passage, away from where the more sedate entertainments were being held. The Alphas played for high stakes, and he had not suspected that Sherlock would be able to afford to play in such company.
“Yes, very.” He traced John’s lips with his tongue. When he sighed with eager surrender, Sherlock added, “Much better than arguing over why you don’t want to tell about that madman’s attack on you.”
Aunt Hudson wagged a finger in John’s face. “Do not try to twist my words, child. Your father has given this matter much thought, and he has not changed his mind.”
John struggled not to smile as his heart leapt with joy. If Sir Albert was disgruntled, it might mean that Father had told him that a betrothal between Sebastian and his son was out of the question.
John looked at the peddler again.  He was still smiling.  The man must think him completely daft, as he had yet to utter a sensible word in his hearing.
Lord Watson arched his gray brows and smiled. “I should have known that it would be something magnificent. John is not prone to exaggeration.” He ran a finger along the etching on the barrel. “It is well made and not new.” With a squint, he peered at the butt. “There appears to be a crest of some sort here.”
“No more than one should expect,” he answered. That, at least, was the truth, although he wondered why he had experienced this need to be honest with John now.
John wanted to pour out the truth to him, but he was afraid of what else might flow from his heart when he opened it to reveal his terror at the idea of mating a man he knew he could never love. “Sherlock, you still ask far too many questions.”
John frowned – there was some distant memory but he couldn't put his finger on it so he shook his head gingerly. Surprise flickered over Morgan's features and she cocked an eyebrow at him coolly.
He could try again another day. Something smaller, maybe. More frivolous. Another repressed sigh at that – those cases brought in money, but they did little to challenge Sherlock's intellect, to make him feel like he was clever and outpacing everyone, like he was
"No," Sherlock agreed. "But someone does. And I suggest we start by finding out if anyone even tangentially connected to either of them hired Karam Sarraf to courier any messages."
