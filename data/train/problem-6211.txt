Wanda is powerful but green, too; they need to find an experienced magic user to train Steve and her properly. Tony might even do an effort to get along with Stephen if he's the best person for the job.
"Sure," Tony says, still grinning. "Can't wait! We can talk about my list of names. I have opinions."
"Build it and they will come," Tony mutters a few days later, flicking a switch. He smiles when the core starts humming. It's far from finished, but it's going well.
The offer manages to make Tony soften. True, not everything in these cursed eleven years has been bad. "That... that would be nice. Please."
"Alright," he concedes with a chuckle. "She's just that awesome, then. Which makes me wonder… what are you waiting for?" he challenges the other one.
Steve almost confesses that he has no desire to go, that he wants to stay with Tony, but he can't. Tony had his heart broken just a few months ago; he doesn't need Steve being Too Much™.
"I thought you'd never ask," Steve quips, circling Tony's waist with his free arm to pull him flush to his chest.
Tony freezes, slowly leaning up to look at Steve as he’s certain a smile takes over his entire face. "Yes, just like Spock! I can't believe I didn't realize it until you said it. How cool is that?"
He reflexively touches the arc reactor in his chest, seeking the comfort it has become… and it's like the bottom of Tony's stomach drops to the floor. He can't feel it. What the fuck happened?
Tony would ask for an explanation, but he requested the CliffsNotes version and isn’t sure he can handle too much information right now.
Yes, trust was definitely a factor, but it's not like Tony had a lot of options. Stephen and he are not on speaking terms at the moment, though push comes to shove he would probably have helped, anyway. Tony won't tell Steve, though, he loves that smile.
"I could do it? Yeah, I can do it," Tony says. Of course he'd want to take care of the babies; it's clear he's already attached.
"Yeah, I think so," Steve says and passes the bag to Tony, who's wordlessly asking for it. Steve jumps out of the garbage and Tony crouches on the pavement, ripping the bag open.
As there was so much to see on the ship and then preparation for meeting the Sovereign kept them busy, Tony didn't even think to search his room for personal effects. Maybe he would have wondered earlier about it if one of the others used their own phones, but Steve's is the first he's seen since regaining consciousness in the hospital.
Steve grabs clothes from a duffle bag and eyes the size of the pants critically before abandoning them to check in the next tent over. Tony wishes he'd drop the woolen blanket to see what seems to be a perfect ass; clearly giving it to Steve was a tactical mistake.
Steve notices that there's another box on Tony's workspace, with plexiglass walls and what he supposes are sensors.
The memory cuts and Anthony shakes his head as if more will fall out. This feels monumental, like one of the most important moments of his life, and he can only remember it through a machine made by the Skrulls. It's so frustrating.
"It's true, they grow like weeds," Steve says. He's vindicated when Callie looks up at his voice and makes a beeline towards him.  Heck, his cheeks might crack, he's smiling so widely. "Hey there, baby girl."
"Tony Stark," Tony answers, at the same time that Steve says "Iron Man." Tony smiles and winks at Steve, before adding, "And Captain America."
The doors of the elevators leading to the Avengers’ floors open in front of Steve when he shows up with several paper bags full of fast food.
"I can see that, love, and believe me, it's a fantastic offer," Tony says with a reassuring squeeze. "But we shouldn't rush into this. We need to talk first, about what we both like and want out of this, boundaries, a safe word-"
Steve’s eyes linger a second on Tony's hair. Tony pats it down and realizes it's all over the place.
They enter the cranium by flying through what used to be an eye socket. It reveals settlements stacked all over, clinging to the bone in some places or to industrial structures that have sprouted in the skull with no visible organization. In between the turrets, landing strips, and buildings, little spaceships criss-cross the empty space while doing their business, adding to the chaos. They'd heard Thanos had badly damaged Exitar when he collected the Reality Stone five years ago, but clearly it's been patched up. The sight is extraordinary, enough to render Tony speechless.
"Reed was conducting his research when Electro bursted in the lab. I made a force field bubble to protect us from his lightning bolts, but it unfortunately touched the portal window, and it sucked all of us right in."
Both Steve and Cora turned their heads to look at Tony, which was confusing until he realized Lilly was curled in a ball against his shoulder, sound asleep.
"Speaking of nice tiddies, the fight with Steve really fucked me up. My second option was to get blackout drunk, which seemed appealing, but I had no liquor in the lab and didn't want to go on the common floor. My third was talking to Steve about feelings, so I think it won't surprise you that I took the fourth choice and went flying instead."
"Tony, please calm down," Steve says slowly but firmly. He scoots his chair closer to the bed and his hand hovers close to Tony, as if he wants to reach and touch but doesn't dare. "You had the arc reactor removed years ago, remember?"
It's easy and comfortable to fall back into a routine with Tony and the kittens. The feedings are further apart, but the girls are so much more responsive now that they spend a lot of time with them, anyway. One of Steve's favorite new tasks is gently brushing them with a soft toothbrush to simulate grooming.
It takes a ton of weight off Steve's shoulders. At twelve weeks old, they could have found forever homes for the kittens already. But Steve couldn't imagine letting go of the kittens, even to a nice family. And frankly? He's suspected for months that Tony would prefer to keep them; he's way too attached.
"Oh God," Steve says, leaning forward so he rests his forehead on Tony's shoulder as he catches his breath.
Once they determine exactly where they want to set the trap in the facility's heart, Tony gets to work assembling the light-speed engine.
He looks warily at the boar, hoping he’s not insulting it. The beast grunts but doesn’t seem too offended.
Carol starts, which makes sense chronologically. "When I was on the P.E.G.A.S.U.S. project, I tested the core of a new light-speed engine, developed in secret by Doctor Wendy Lawson while she worked with the military. She was not human, but a Kree. She was building the engine to help the Skrulls, another alien race."
"They deserved it." Not realizing Hydra was still active for seventy years is outrageous. "Did you save Bucky?"
"It hurt like hell, but no, we weren't injured. You took most of the hit for us." Steve shakes his head. "It was incredibly bold and dangerous but also entirely selfless. You were ready to die to save the universe from a second Decimation. We're just glad we linked with you because it's the only reason you survived."
This cannot happen. Captain America doesn't die from a B-rated villain's lucky shot, nor from kissing the pavement at 205 miles per hour. Tony cannot and will not lose Steve, and he realizes with a jolt that he wants a second chance. He wants for them to be a team more than just on the field. It can’t be too late.
Tony hums in consideration, appreciating the possibility of an out. But memories aside, he feels great. He can do a little PR without a problem. Plus, if Tony has a script and lets the others do most of the talking, they could finish the tour with no one being the wiser.
Heck, Steve is fifteen minutes early, since he woke before the alarm. There is a familiar head of dark hair on the cot in the corner, which makes him smile. Tony listened and went to sleep before Steve took the 7 AM shift, but not in his bedroom. It figures that he wouldn't be able to go far.
Steve's voice is a threatening rumble, which is pretty sexy. But the posturing is also unnecessary as Tony can take care of himself. He sharply pushes back so Steve gives him space and raises his hands up placatingly.
They all chuckle and Steve reaches for her in comfort. "Just a second, don't worry." Tony and the doctor focus on feeding the black kitten
"I don't know about you," Tony says, "but I'm not sure I should bring it home. I like it a little too much."
"Fuck!" Tony swears, turning the shield to catch the blasts. He's torn between staying on the ground to protect Steve and Nebula and taking flight to attack the ship.
He has a complex relationship with regular alcohol on Earth, and the lure of this juice would be hard to resist if it continues to deliver the happy chemicals.
It's a surprise when Steve sits on the sofa. The other Avengers never want to re-watch movies they've seen before. After a second of hesitation—he has the perfect amount of butter this time, he skipped lunch, and he'd planned on eating the entire bag—Tony extends his bowl to Steve.
"How are you doing, Sheriff?" Tony asks, now watching him with open curiosity. He's not sober, but plenty alert. Then again, Stark is able to drink like a fish and still walk and snark with ease.
He guides them to his bed by walking backwards to it and pulling Tony along. When Steve reaches his destination and sits down on the cot, Tony continues with his forward movement to crawl right onto his lap. He doesn't stop until he's plastered to Steve's chest with both arms looped around his neck, which is a marvelous place to be. Especially with Steve's head tilted back to look up at him, adoration written all over his face. Tony must look just as sappy; he certainly feels like it.
Tony looks up to see Steve holding the ring up with a small smile and understanding eyes. It's a reminder of everything happy and good that is to come, and how the past is just that, the past, and it can't hurt Tony anymore that it already did. God, Tony loves Steve so much.
"Let me guess." Yon-Rogg crosses his arms over his chest. "You lost track of time while playing with some gimmick."
He decided on the drive over that it would be his mantra for the visit. Just act normal. No need to spill feelings everywhere, not yet. Tony is less than five months out of his divorce, he needs time to himself before dating again. Steve can wait for his chance until it's the right moment, if there ever will be such a thing.
"Yeah?" The words suffuse a soft glow in Steve's chest. "I'll do whatever you want," he promises. He trusts Tony to make it good.
With their momentum, Peter and Morgan's tube stops a lot further on the lake than Tony's. They high five as they disembark.
"I'd counter with me still being in the ice and my mind coming up with weird scenarios. But let's face it, I couldn't have thought of
What the ever loving fuck? This guy is creepy, plus he's full of shit. The green in Steve's eyes is beautiful.
The sentiment is sweet, and the praise warms Tony right up. Since when did Steve look at him with such fondness? From Tony's outdated perspective they’re friendly, teammates, but that's about it. It's a pleasant surprise to know that spending another eleven years together as Avengers leads to this much affection.
"I don't doubt it," he says when he tears his gaze away to look at Tony's eyes again. "But you can't be at full strength with what just happened. I can help."
"Yeah, very Wizard of Oz of him. A funnel on the top of the armor's head, too." Steve has to give Loki points for style, at the very least.
"I do. Nothing about it respects the laws of physics, so thank God for small favors." Tony grins and winks. "Sorry to disappoint."
Somehow he manages an extra fraction of an inch, prodding the remote with the tip of his fingers in a way that makes it start to fall to the ground. Steve desperately lunges for it, but also loses his footing. What follows takes seconds: with no force pulling Tony back, he's sucked right into the portal. Unfortunately, since Steve didn't let go, he follows. They end up on their asses in the middle of a dusty road, the portal blinking out of existence as soon as they are through.
"We have!" Steve says excitedly, reaching for the little face and scratching under her chin. Her eyes are blue, as expected, and still hazy, but definitely opened. "Hey there, beautiful!"
The first coherent thought Tony forms when he opens his eyes and glances around is that there sure is a lot of white. Ceiling, walls, floor, furniture, the bed he's lying in, the sheets, and his own shirt… all of it is white as snow. The only color at all, except for Tony's own skin, is Steve sitting in the chair beside the bed in jeans and a black T-shirt, his whole person popping out in the otherwise monochrome room. Cap is fast asleep, head bowed with his chin resting against his chest, massive arms crossed, and Tony takes a moment to observe him. He looks good, even had his hair cut. Steve should dress casually more often instead of wearing his old man clothes; it suits him.
Instead of grabbing a water bottle and slipping out, Steve strides into the kitchen as if he's not been eavesdropping for the last five minutes. Tony now has Jim's black swim trunks on with no shirt, and he looks downright fantastic. Steve longs to one day be allowed to reach and touch him, and not just steal a few glances.
Speaking of Steve, to Tony's deep relief things haven’t become weird or stilted or changed overmuch since the mistletoe incident. They remain the dream team when on missions, complementing each other perfectly, and their banter is healthy and as present as always. Steve is still looking, though, unashamed to let his crush show now, but it's not too much. Tony would be uncomfortable with soulful or sad looks—again he never meant to hurt the guy—but that's not how Steve is acting at all. If anything, he seems happier. Liberated to have spoken his truth, or something like that.
"Yeah, through a series of events. When I got too close to the truth, Hydra sent an assassin after me: the Winter Soldier. James Barnes."
"Of course. We had a skirmish with a group of Krees, another race of aliens. Let's just say our friends Carol and Nebula, the ones we're traveling with, aren’t fans and the feeling is mutual. During the fight, you received an energy blast to the head while protecting Nebula. You're lucky the armor took the hit and that it didn't kill you on the spot."
Tony sighs. "I know. I had a drink with Colonel Phillips, and he was grumbling about how the men from the Army Post Office hadn't reached them for a few weeks. When I told him we were going back to London, he gave me the mail so that it would travel faster."
"That's mine. Iron Man. War Machine is back to gunmetal gray after a stint in red, white, and blue a few years back as the Iron Patriot. What a stupid name. Speaking of... Before that embarrassing stroll down memory lane, you talked about Fury. Nick Fury?"
He raises high a mug full of mead, and Tony hurries—like Steve and everyone in the room—to grab their own to prepare for a toast.
It is, in fact, a suitable moment to pause, and Tony hadn't realized it was two in the morning already.
There's a sour taste in Tony's mouth. Everyone leaves him in the end. Family, lovers, spouse, friends, coworkers, they never stay. Except Rhodey. More than ever, he misses Rhodey fiercely and wishes he were here.
He's had a feeling in the last two days that his time at the Tower is reaching its end. There's an assignment imminent; they've been chasing leads on a potential home-grown biological weapon for months now. Steve is now ninety percent sure that Natasha has found the people responsible and that they must strike soon. Organizing exercises from a distance has been fine, but this is a mission, and a crucial one at that.
"We'll make it work, Tony," Steve says with conviction. He can be certain enough for two until Tony accepts it as well.
"Yeah, okay." Carol elbows his side playfully. "Sorry about grabbing you like that and forcing all of that stuff out in the open. You almost took me out on Xoria."
They are still plastered together in the tube, and for a second, the adrenaline and elation almost makes Steve lean down and kiss Tony. Steve catches himself in time, though he's pretty sure that Tony noticed him stare at his mouth. Shit, this is not acting normal! Tony doesn't seem bothered, thank God, looking up at him fondly.
"Oh Tony, no!" Steve says before kissing him again. On the lips, but then his cheeks, his nose, his forehead. It's tender and reverent. "Getting out of your bed, leaving you to go back to my apartment... It was so hard. I wanted to hold you close all night. I almost faked falling asleep several times, but I chickened out. Since you never asked me to stay, I just thought that's how it was. Until we were married, I figured—"
"Whoa, alright," Tony says when they have to break the kiss in need of oxygen. Desire has blown his pupils wide open, making his eyes darker than usual and even more mesmerizing. "I would have moved back months ago if I'd known this was on offer!"
He looks good, although when does he not? But Steve had almost expected to see an unkept Tony, as anyone cut away from the world might be. Steve also realizes that Tony doesn't have the luxury to let himself go completely, with the facade he needs to keep with the press and his investors.
"It's so great to see you, Pep." Tony breathes in her vanilla scented shampoo, so familiar and comforting.
He's about to slip down the rabbit hole again when there's brief contact on his face, a hand cupping his cheek. It's comforting, nothing violent, and the voice is calm and soft, very soothing.
But no, it's Yon-Rogg who steps out of the shadow, surrounded by Att-Lass, Van-Igha, Kelleri, Mi-Verse, and another guy he's never seen on the Starforce team. Anthony relaxes, wondering where this memory is going, but his past self reacts completely differently.
That surprises Tal, who blinks, then gives Nebula a closer look. He only just realized who she is, and he's suddenly less languid and even more curious.
For a moment, you could have heard a pin drop, but then Tony straightened up and opened the armor to step out, and the reporters went berserk. Similarly to the Stark Expo inauguration, Tony was dressed in a three piece suit and sporting his very best press smile.
"Thank you. Thank you. I was so afraid to lose you if I talked, and then I did—" His voice breaks as he whispers against Tony's hand. "I thought you died hating me and it killed me, Tony."
"Nebula is a skilled Luphomoïd warrior. Superhuman strength, durability, and agility. She can fire concussive electroshock charges."
"You're stuck with me now, honey." Tony raises his left hand to show off his ring. That's still quite a thrill, and Steve's smile is beautiful.
"I think they've got this, and anyway there's nothing we can do for them," Tony says. He hits the left-pointing arrow again, just to change it up.
He'd left explicit instructions in his will… which yeah, Tony must be legally dead now, that will be a hassle.
"I can't believe you guys," Rhodes says. "I have the perfect solution for you. Tony, you come back here, with both cats. We all get to play with the kittens, and as a bonus, Steve gets to see you, and you him. Win-win!"
"Cap found these baby kittens in a dumpster. I just want someone to look them over, you know?" Tony says, Bambi eyes at maximum power.
"Meraviglia, my reputation as one of the most skilled ass worshippers in the Western world is verified and plenty earned," he says with a playful eyebrow waggle. Granted, those skills were used in a very different context, but still. "I've never had any complaints."
"The Summer Pavilion should have everything you need," she says, unlocking the door and giving Tony the keycard. "You are welcome to join us for breakfast tomorrow, in the room we just left."
Steve doesn't know if he'd like that. It unsettles him a bit. Surely it's not normal to want someone you love to hurt you?
Tony woke up feeling rested and not hungover, which he appreciates a lot. It's very early still, but he never sleeps much, especially when he's been drinking. He could close his eyes and try to go back to sleep, but he doesn't feel like it. This is nice, relaxing even. He can indulge in appreciating a gorgeous young man a little more. As he thought, the bed is large enough that they kept separate and probably didn't even touch each other, but Steve seems to have migrated closer to the center of the mattress during the night. He's curled towards Tony, a hand extended as if unconsciously reaching out for him.
Steve's heart is racing as he goes for it; his hands are so sweaty he wipes them on his thighs. After a fortifying breath, he takes the plunge.
"Sounds great." It's a tad breathless as Tony reaches for him and puts a tentative hand on Steve's shoulder. In return, Steve places his hands on Tony's side, which helps cement that this is happening.
"I'm a lot stronger than he is," Carol says, and Tony shrugs at the accuracy of it. "My Skrull partner and I went through his memories to find out how come the Krees had someone else with my powers, and we found out the truth."
The croupier puts the last six tiles of the game on the table, and for now there's nothing good for Tony. There's a high chance that one of the hidden tiles is a red "ten," and Tony really hopes someone chooses it. Kol starts the round, but the hidden tile he uncovers is a green "seven," therefore useless. But then Disorganized Guy turns over the red "ten," and Tony needs to distract the other players so they hopefully forget about it before Tony's turn.
"You flatterer," Tony purrs with his most flirtatious smile, and thrills when Steve's blush darkens.
Deliberately, Tony waits for everyone to have their tiles face up before he uncovers his own. Kol is smirking, sure of his win by having an all-blue series of four numbers. Clearly, he doesn't care one bit about Thanos's death right now. It's with gleeful amusement that Tony reveals a series from the equivalent of the numbers five to ten, using the six colors. He hadn't placed them in order, and it takes a second for it to register with the others.
During the conversation – that Tony tried and failed to look uninterested in – Snowball has joined her sister in the incubator, now full and cleaned up. "I'm sorry—" Steve starts.
"Yeah." Steve admits. What is making Steve's heart beat faster is how good Tony is with the boy. He did not know that seeing Tony with kids would make him all flustered. To be fair, Tony does that to him with almost anything. "Adorable."
"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated," Tony quips. He thinks he might use that line several times in the next few weeks. It is a classic after all.
comes to Tony's mind before he shakes the thought away. No, they're not in Siberia; they’re in space, and there's a fight going on. Tony just got knocked around.
It pleases the lady greatly. "As I told Mister Stark, I am very glad to hear it. And you are welcome to dance until morning if you wish to do so!"
She nods and gestures, shutting the vault's door without touching it. Next, she makes a red mist morph into a surface that perfectly mimics the back wall, and the door to the vault disappears. He tested the barrier in the last few days, and it's astounding how real it appears. It also hides the core's energy signature thoroughly. If the Krees ever make their way back here, it should fool them into thinking they have the wrong room.
"Okay. I trust you," he says, which is huge. Maybe even more important than another four-letter word. Steve's in love and he knows it, and hopefully Tony will get there too.
It's exhilarating, being wanted by Captain America. A huge ego boost, for sure. He might be old, but he's still got it, a thought which lifts Tony’s already high spirits as he continues to dance with even more fervor. Yeah, the orange fruit juice is still having an effect, but now that they've been exercising so to speak, his head is getting clearer.
Tony's studying the engine schematics on the ship's computer and it's fascinating stuff. But he's curious about this woman, who keeps throwing him sideways glances only to look away when she's caught.
It's true that he's not sober, but it just gave him the courage to act on his desires. "I know what I want, Tony. Trust me."
"Different reality, Steve," Tony says. "There's nothing useful for us here, ready to go?" Heck, there's not even a Steve, at least right there with them, which feels unsettling.
This is getting complicated. Tony rubs his forehead, hoping to hell that he doesn’t get a headache, but he wants to hear more. "But we got the Tesseract back." He understands it holds one of the stones.
WIM-Tony raises his voice, displeased. "He survived. Thanks to you, apparently." He slides under Steve's arm again to help him walk some more. "And Monica, if you believe the news stories."
He immediately perks up, but Tony sighs heavily. "He means well, Steve, he always does, but I can't risk him coming too close."
He's not sure he'd be able to trust Steve with his heart, after learning all of this. He should take comfort in knowing they made up, but emotions don't listen to logic. He really needs to process it all.
"That's cute, I like it," Tony says. "She could have a longer title, too. Princess Bella Calliope, first of her name."
As infuriating as it is—because he's not a child—the nap helps. The downside is that Tony is groggy upon waking up and starts a quest for coffee. Surely they didn't leave Earth without some. The ship isn't big, which makes it easy to find the dining area. There's a counter slash table next to a set of cupboards and what Tony supposes are appliances. Heck, one looks a lot like a microwave. Steve is there too, occupying a stool bolted to the ground and eating a power bar. He glances up from a tablet as soon as Tony shuffles in.
"Me, Nat, and Sam, a friend I met in D.C. who's in the Avengers now, we brought Hydra down," Steve continues. "We kind of destroyed SHIELD in the process."
To his surprise, Steve turns his hand up so their fingers intertwine, squeezing back. It does all sorts of things to Tony's insides to be holding hands with Captain America, especially when he's being looked at with so much affection.
"There is a veterinarian clinic two blocks south of your position," she says. Meanwhile, Will has returned with a beige tea towel that he hands to Steve.
"We were wondering," Rhodes says, already sipping at his drink. He's sitting on a stool near the island, and the innocent look on his face is such a lie. Rhodes is just as much a little shit as every other Avenger. "Would you like to have one of the cats, when they're big enough?"
What is certain is that he's completely lost now. Tony doesn't know how long he's been walking when he spots the light of a small fire in the distance and hope surges in his chest. Oh, thank God, he found them again. Unfortunately, there's also a low growl—close, way too close—that makes the hair rise all over Tony's body.
That would just let them slide for a few more meters, but Steve does as asked and squeezes beside Tony.
"There are ups and downs, but yes." Steve's lucky, they could have killed him that day. He almost bled to death, not counting the scare with the hogs. Thank God Scott helped him get away.
"Exactly," Tony says, pleased by the non-judgment he detects in Barnes’ tone. Not everyone is a fan of his like Steve. Tony's been told by many soldiers and officers that civilians should stay away from military business. That he should relinquish his armors, have them mass produced and manned by professional pilots instead. The perceived openness gives Tony hope that they can collaborate. "Steve was kindly bringing me back to the main camp, where I plan to have a chat with Colonel Phillips. I'll suggest returning with my buddy Rhodes and the armors, and with your help we could hunt for those assholes and hopefully find and exterminate the nest. How does that sound?"
Anthony doesn't remember his mother, although he sometimes gets flashes of a kind, blond woman in his dreams that
"We scheduled three weeks, not to be away from Earth for too long. Week One is done, with two stops, Xantar and Banturia. There are three more stops left—Sovereign, Iantus, and Knowhere—before we head back to Earth."
He'll take care of it. In fact, Tony should hurry to gather a few friends and strike back at Victor as soon as possible. If he has even a lick of sense left, the sorcerer has already left the country.
"Iron Man and the Captain are authentic heroes and have shown extraordinary courage, cunning, and skills during the various battles we have fought together on Midgard. I have already regaled you with many anecdotes of the fight where we stopped a Chitauri invasion led by my brother—" There is a mix of cheers and jeers, either because Thor told those stories too often, or because he mentioned Loki (apparently imprisoned somewhere close). Thor doesn't pay them any mind. "And I am certain that my friends were just as impressive, if not more, in the battles where I was absent," Thor adds with a playful wink.
Steve keeps Tony cradled in a hand to his chest, and, as expected, he smells wonderful. Once sat at the table, which is covered with books, he seems flummoxed, looking from the glass he just filled with water to Tony.
He doesn't have to ask twice, the two men happily comply. There isn't a lot of grip on the icy surface, but Steve brings the tube with Rhodey and Tony back up the slope without problems.
On the screen, Tony is not revolutionizing the industry of incubators for small animal fostering, but has resumed working on War Machine's boot. Steve smiles, irrationally happy that it has nothing to do with the kittens. By Tony's elbow, DUM-E keeps turning his camera towards the incubator, though he doesn't roll closer. It's not subtle at all, and Tony eventually relents.
When Kol reaches as if to take the glasses, Tony steps back, which has him smack into someone. The unmoving wall of muscles turns out to be Steve.
Okay is relative, but he supposes it’s also appropriate. "Of course. I hope you can finally be happy together."
“Yes.” Thor points at an ornate grandfather clock that currently shows five o’clock. “I will be here at eight. Be dressed and ready.”
"Hey, big guy! Friend of Tony!" It's Tal, a few feet away, helping Jarons limp to safety. He tosses a ray gun to Steve, who catches it with his free hand. "You guys do Knowhere a favor and kick the Krees' asses, okay?"
Tony rolls his eyes. "Oh, come on." He turns to Steve, exasperated. "I ran away instead of talking things out like an adult. I'd say that's not on you, Steve."
"I agree with you there," Tony says, checking the remote in his hand. He doesn't know what happened in this world, and why this Cap is here. This WIM-Tony clearly presumed him dead. But he's pretty sure that they won't find a way home from here. The scene continues to unfurl before them nonetheless.
It's a good thing that Tony's body is a lot more resistant now, because he's pretty sure that regular-Tony's ribs would be all cracked by this point.
Unless it did? Maybe that's the big fallout. They may have tried for more than friendship, and it blew up in their faces. Right here and right now on the dance floor, Steve looks away when caught. It breaks the immediate tension, but a buzz remains under Tony's skin. He knows how to decode desire, and that was so obvious. And if Tony is completely wrong and they've never been more than friends, Steve has a hell of a crush now. It fits with the little remarks here and there, the compliments that made Tony fidget in the ship's kitchen that first day, and what Chancellor Almar said about Steve's fondness too.
"When you asked…" Tony pauses, considers him and then raises his chin, as if he's resolved to face the music no matter what. "You seemed to know the answer to your question, and many would not be happy about it."
"Cora, come back!" Lilly cries out, before running to Tony. She puts her paws on his thumb, claws gripping him. "It's okay, Tony!"
"We're simply passing through," Tony says, gesturing towards the alcove behind him where he supposes Carol and Steve still are.
"Okay, agreed," Jim admits a few seconds later. "Good kinetic energy and well-aimed water direction."
Tony wants Steve. Badly. And not just to finally resolve their almost-at-first-sight unresolved sexual tension (or because he's drop-dead gorgeous). No, he's liked Steve for a long time, before the drama, which made their falling-out even more painful. Tony would have never cheated on Pepper, but when they broke up he'd asked himself... What if Steve wasn't straight? What if Steve liked him back? Could they risk a relationship without destroying the Avengers if it didn't work out? And then everything went to shit, and the fantasy of building something with Steve wasn't an option anymore.
"Hey," Steve says, cursing himself for going through the communal rooms instead of taking a detour and by walking outside. It's not that he wants for his trip to be a secret, but he'd planned to email in the afternoon. On his terms, and out of direct teasing range.
"A year ago, in a Hydra base of operations in Sokovia, we got mind whammied by a young woman with powers. Wanda Maximov. She showed us our worst fear, and it led to a lot of destruction. A big part of it was my fault, as I insisted the Iron Legion enforce a police state for a while. Wanda also released a raving mad Hulk through Johannesburg—"
He's trying to pull off Tony's clothes too, which is frankly unnecessary. Because it's not clothes Tony is wearing; it's his armor. He'd been so overwhelmed by the memories coming back when lying in his room that he completely forgot to change. A mental command is all that’s needed for the nanites to return to the reactor affixed to his chest.
Years of unease, and now, suddenly, something just feels right. He knows, deep in his gut, that this is his actual name. She's telling the truth.
"I think he got it," Steve says, seeing how DUM-E is all but vibrating in place, more restrained than he's ever seen him when he’s doing something. "What about having FRIDAY project images of the kittens on a screen he can watch?"
"If her majesty demands, I'll prepare the feast," Tony says. He extends the black kitten to Steve, who takes her from his hand, and places the two on the couch cushion beside him. The one with open eyes is not tracking yet, but she's valiantly trying to look around. Her sister is frustrated that food has not instantly appeared. Steve grabs his phone and records the moment for posterity.
Baylee grabs the card and uses it to salute Carol. "Got it, Captain. Holler if you want me to come back."
The statistics of the World Health Organization report that less than one person in ten is a Shifter, but Steve believes it must be at least twice that in reality. Until thirty years ago, being identified as a Shifter meant a life either in the armed forces, in a lab, or as a freak in a circus. Shifter rights have evolved a lot since then, but many cultures still keep their Shifter children unreported to the authorities. Heck, most churches still demand that their parishioners repress their "inner demons" at all costs.
As far as Tony can remember, there should be. He hasn't opened up his own old books in decades. Steve has his serious face on as he goes through the yellowed pages. Tony, exhausted and drowsy now that he's warm, nestles against Steve's free hand in a not-subtle at all request for pets. He gets them, too, and he's drifting in a comfortable daze when Steve lets out a victorious cry.
Which is a problem because Tony has none. He makes a pleading face at Nebula, who rolls her eyes but reaches for her pocket.
That's it. Tony is doomed. He rolls on his back, crosses his wings over his belly and closes his eyes. He'll await death here, misunderstood by the world to the bitter end.
A blur of a beast with golden fur and feathers leaps at Thor, bringing him to the ground. It's a big cat, similar to a lion but with wings, and Tony doesn't understand what is going on. The animal has immense paws and scary teeth, and Tony instinctively charges his repulsors. The only reason he doesn't fire is the winged lion is licking instead of biting. And, he realizes a second later, Thor is laughing.
By his side Steve’s blasting his fair share of Krees with the gun Tal gave him; he might not like that type of weapon, but he's a fantastic shot. FRIDAY is keeping count of the active Krees, and there are only two left in the casino. Six are still giving them grief outside, but that should go down to four momentarily, courtesy of Nebula. She is a ferocious and highly skilled fighter and found an electrified baton, of all things, to beat her Krees soundly with. They'll be an even darker blue in the morning.
"You think I'll go after him." It was so obvious, and Steve all but confirmed it by breaking eye contact and looking at the floor.
"I'd love to drink your blood." Tony searches Steve's face. "Are you aware of what you're asking? It's very intimate."
"Don't be fooled by their manners," Nebula said before they arrived. "They would pulverize this ship and everyone in it if they felt that we were a threat. Not even Thanos dared to bring his armies here."
Nat speaks up next. "Steve... you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?"
That's a good sign, isn't it? It means that his memories are just locked somewhere inside his head, ready to come out. He turns to Steve, hopeful, but finds him looking sad again. There’s a story there, surely, but it’ll need more investigating another time.
Too many zealots who wouldn't bat an eyelash to bomb Earth even with more than a hundred captive Krees on it. Of course, there's a risk that the prisoner's pride makes them want to come back for seconds, but hopefully not.
"I don't need to think about it," Tony hurries to say. Maybe he was too brusque. Or it's because Tony's been prickly since the rogues returned—it suggested harder feelings on Tony's part, not simply a mess of emotions because he cared so much. But Steve's face minutely falls.
Tony is on his side on the ground, still reeling from what is certainly a severe concussion. He watches in dismay as the wolf—massive and with golden fur—leaves one Hydra soldier to jump towards a second, and then a third. The men are shooting the wolf with darts, not bullets. Whatever sedative they contain is not working at all, as the wolf continues to attack, incapacitating the soldiers. It's not paying Tony any mind, for which he's eternally grateful. In fact… it has firmly planted itself between the remaining Hydra men and Tony, and is baring extra long teeth as if daring them to approach.
Steve gets pink right away. "You know how it is; they’re everywhere. But not once did a picture of Morgan make it to the media. No special number in a magazine for your convenience, nothing."
"Yeah. Just finished. It's crude, but has way more effective thermoregulation," Tony says. "I didn't want to wake them up in the transfer, but we can put them in after the next feeding."
"Oh, no!" Tony laughs, always a pleasant sight. "I'm looking into an engine for transportation. Nothing as massive as a train, something smaller, for trails and roads."
The only reassurance that he takes from the news is that Steve went from Nat to JARVIS, so he presumes that everyone else is fine. Steve would have said something happened to Rhodey, Pepper, or Happy, so Tony doesn't ask.
Rhodey throws an arm over Tony's shoulders and rubs his knuckles hard on the top of Tony's head. "It will do. I love it. But seriously, I have questions. One being why you haven't changed a bit since the late 80s, Carol."
So Tony paces alongside the now opened window, which is clumsy at best. He's gracious in the air when he's turned, but looks downright silly when he crawls. Tony wishes to explain, but he has no voice, and it's frustrating as hell.
He stays in Tony's personal space after his comment, their arms brushing in a way that doesn't feel accidental. It makes Tony realize the guy is also flirting with him. Huh.
Steve's lips rise in a smirk. "And I thought I was getting better at my craft. But that sounds like a believable alternate explanation."
"All right." Tony reaches for the back of Steve's neck, petting gently. "If we're talking power dynamics, I prefer a dominant role. Taking control."
"I'll go help those two," Steve says, inclining his head towards the bottom of the slope where Tony and Rhodes have started the ascent, pushing their tube.
This time Steve spots him, but his frown doesn't abate. If anything, it furrows deeper. He looks at Tony, right against the glass, and sighs. Then he turns around and starts walking towards his bed again.
"Not with everyone," he quips and rises on his elbows in order to scan the camp. If Tony isn't mistaken, he also subtly sniffs the air and then makes a displeased grimace. He can probably smell the corpses of the Hydra soldiers.
"Wait, you mean not everyone gets to be Captain America? Are you sure? We've had a least six of them…" Mechanic-Tony replies.
"Thank God." It's like a thousand tons have left Tony's shoulders. "I just want you to be happy, even if it's not with me. Because I love you too. And I should have said it, because it would have cleared up a few things."
"Ah!" Tony exclaims, but then has to smile at how proud of itself the wolf is looking, eyes bright and tail still thumping on the ground. Gingerly, Tony sits up, annoyed at his head that is throbbing and the nausea that immediately hits. "I hope that was not just to sample how I taste."
Tony is too banged up to start a long trek in the woods where he's still lost. He should rest too, as it should be easier to find his way back in the light of day. Eventually, Tony gets up and drags the bodies of the soldiers away from the campfire, adds wood to the latter, then installs a bedroll by the sleeping wolf. It's too big to drag into a tent, and who knows how disoriented it will be when it wakes up. Tony wouldn't want for it to feel trapped and lash out at the closest perceived enemy. An appropriated blanket around his shoulders, Tony tries to keep watch, wary of Hydra returning and the fact that he shouldn't sleep after such a hard blow to the head. The regular sounds of a forest are back, which is slightly comforting, but also acts as a lull. Tony starts nodding off as the night stretches on.
Steve is in full uniform, and with his shield on his arm now. Tony helps him put on his cowl, and he rubs down his arms.
"Don't worry, I've got you," Tony says. He's gathered the rest of his come from Steve's face, but instead of bringing it to Steve's mouth, he reaches down to his dick.
Unfortunately, reality rudely intrudes by a voice speaking up, closer than Tony expected someone to be. "Steve? Where the hell are you?"
"Can you blame me? You're sin on legs, Steve. My mind is in the gutter as soon as I have eyes on you. And often even when you're out of sight."
He puts the end of the small nipple in the kitten's mouth, and immediately the white kitten reacts by stretching her front paws with kneading motions, swallowing eagerly.
Curious, Tony seeks out texts with the other Avengers. His last exchange with Bruce is close to the top and has notes about tissue regeneration. He swallows with difficulty when he opens Natasha's conversation and sees that her second-to-last bubble says, "It's going to work, Shellhead" to which he replied, "Of course, what do you take me for?". She then ended the conversation and the thread itself with an emoji blowing a kiss. It's from nine weeks ago. He scrolls back to see they've had sporadic contact in the last five years, polite but with barely any banter. At least it got better in the last few weeks before her death. Something about that makes Tony uneasy, but then again he had retired and was busy raising a kid, so that might be it.
"Hello, strangers," she says, in complete seduction mode. Her outfit barely covers her four breasts and full ass, complete with a perky, little tail. "I'm Baylee. Can I interest you in a show?"
? With Pepper? What the hell was she thinking? He's not father material. Heck, he was sure he and Pepper were finished, though he had hoped for a reconciliation.
"Sure," Tony says, transferring the cat and towel bundle to Thor’s arms. Snowball looks even tinier in the huge arms of a clearly smitten Thor. "You watch the hooligans for me, alright?" Tony tells Steve.
Did Earth boost its defenses against threats from space, as Tony advocated? Were they hit with another invasion while he was gone? He thinks that a bit of caution is warranted.
That's it, the last push, and Tony tumbles over the edge and embraces the freefall. The rush of pleasure causes time to pause and stretch for a moment before it washes over him, leaving him to shudder in Steve's hold. He has enough presence of mind to reopen his eyes in time to see Steve come too, ecstasy making his jaw go slack and his gaze lose focus.
Steve rummages through a small bag at his feet and takes out… an arc reactor. Or something very similar, glowing a reassuring blue.
He's nervous, Tony realizes. Ah, shit, did he notice that every version of Tony Stark out there was gone on his Steve? It was glaringly obvious, after all. He crosses his arms over his chest, bracing for a probable soft rejection (he's sorry he's a dude right now, too).
"Congratulations," he mumbles before continuing towards the Fantastic Four. He can't dwell on Steve and Barnes' romantic relationship right now.
"Hey guys," Tony says with a wave. "It's more like I ran straight into their camp because I thought your friend here was out to get me. It turns out he ate them instead. Well most of them."
"No need," Steve protests, as bullheaded as ever. Tony isn't surprised, but it's exasperating. The Krees inside will be out in a few seconds; they were close behind them. And more are to arrive too.
He didn't even try to say that he understood why Tony was angry. Not a peep about how he might care for Tony and not just for Barnes (did he, really?). No offer to send someone so Tony wouldn’t be alone. Steve just stood there, doing and saying nothing, and Tony might have hated that more than anything else.
"Sorry," Tony apologizes. "I know things have been a mess. We'll take care of the super soldiers, and
He eventually enrolled in SHIELD University, one of the most progressive colleges in Shifter acceptance and representation. The classes are mixed, but still separates the sports teams: it's accepted that Shifters have an unfair advantage over Regulars, because of their anima's abilities. And, well, it's true. So the Shifters compete among themselves in scaled-up facilities that are often twice as big as the ones for Regulars, from pools to baseball fields.
It's said casually enough, but it takes Tony aback. What was that? Bucky and Sharon also share a look that contains a whole conversation. Sharon has her arms crossed as she raises an eyebrow at Bucky while Mechanic-Tony works on the arm, oblivious.
"I know. Also Midgard is not ready for a creature as majestic as you," Thor adds with a little shake.
"We found them in a dumpster," Tony says. The doctor pulls on his gloves and examines the two babies with practiced gestures.
"Oh, Steve knows," Rhodes says. "If he ever plans to do anything about it is something else entirely."
. Those wrinkles and gray hair don't lie; they’re concrete proof that Tony lost an entire decade. He must have made a sound of distress because Steve knocks on the door.
Ward is getting back in position at home plate, after getting a new bat, but Steve's attention is drawn to Bucky. His best friend is visibly pissed off, wolf ears almost plastered on his head and fangs glinting in the sun as he guards his first base. It's unsurprising, when he's so close to Full Shift hyena-Rumlow, who has a back paw on the bag, and is waiting for his chance to round the bases and tie the score. Bucky and Rumlow despise each other, always have, and Steve worries that it's distracting his friend from the game. It's the ninth inning, and there is only one out. If Ward, who's a powerful hitter, has a good enough hit they are in trouble.
Tony sighs; he should have called, if only to explain what was happening. Rhodey has always been great at distracting him from heartbreak until it's manageable. "I know, honey bear."
It makes Steve light up. "You sure call me a bullheaded idiot anyway and told me how you wanted to punch me in the teeth before. That you spoke well of me to Morgan means a lot."
"Why did Hydra kill Howard, do you know?" Tony uses Hydra deliberately, to show Steve that he can separate things. Steve said that he had tried to kill Bucky, and maybe that’s why he didn’t trust Tony enough to tell him the truth, but he wants to prove to Steve, and to himself, that if he had just been given the space to process this information, he could have been rational despite his grief and fury.
"Yeah?" Steve asks, hands on Tony's shoulders as if he doesn't dare do more at the moment. His eyes are intently scanning Tony's face.
"It was more complicated than that. But it's also a big part of it." Steve passes a hand over his mouth, then crosses his arms over his chest. It's not defensiveness, though, not really. More like a sign of stubbornness. "The Avengers split up over a disagreement about whether there was a necessity for oversight by the UN."
Pain explodes in his skull as Tony falls to the ground, bowled over by the blow. He's disoriented, but it's impossible to miss how a moment later all hell breaks loose. The monster that had been following Tony jumps into the camp with a vicious snarl, attacking the man who just hurt Tony by biting him in the neck. The soldier yells in terror, or at least he tries to before it cuts short and the others start shooting at the beast.
Tony's heart falls too, and there's no need for FRIDAY's red alarm, he's already firing his jet boots at full power to dive after Steve. Calculations and probabilities flash before his eyes, but all that he can hear is the rush of blood in his ears.
First thing first, he hopes that he has the energy to reach Steve's small townhome. Tony's been flying for hours, and he's so tired he could cry. Just another effort: he's passed JFK Airport, there are about five miles to go.
. Now that he breathes in slowly, Tony realizes that he can distinguish that memory from the present.
The skin-on-skin contact is divine and Steve leans down until their lips meet in a soft kiss. Tony buries his fingers in Steve's hair in return, which causes a cascade of shivers down his spine and raises goosebumps all over. It is, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to Steve. He is so full of happiness, he might spontaneously combust. Judging by the expression on Tony's face when they separate, the exhilaration is mutual.
This time when Steve kisses him, Tony melts into the embrace. Steve undoes the first buttons on Tony's shirt with shaking hands. Finally he has permission to touch, not just steal glances, and he can't wait.
Steve is about to ask what for when Tony winks and raises his right hand, now configured with a repulsor. Once it's lit up and used to propel them, it's not long that they are flying on the snow and rapidly gaining terrain on Peter and Morgan. When they double them, going incredibly fast, Steve sees Peter's jaw drop.
"Yeah?" he stupidly asks when Tony pulls away. It's nonetheless the most important question in the world.
It reeks of magic and fairy tales. Tony doesn't say it out loud—there are massive animals present that could certainly kill him—but he hates this. Cora has stopped snuggling with Steve's daemon and hops until she's near the armor's boots, looking up at Tony.
"If you insist. Then let me rephrase, Steve." And yes, that works: Steve likes Tony saying his name a lot. "Healing well, I hope?"
There's a fleeting look of shock that passes over Steve's face, but it soon morphs to pure joy. "Me too. I love you so much, Tony."
To be honest, Tony doesn't want to go either. Not when there's a kindle between them that is so close to catching fire.
"No, but I can assist with whom names which kitten. I will generate a random number between one and ten, associated with a kitten. You and Captain Rogers may then choose a number at your turn, and the closest to my pick has to name that cat."
"A lot, but they have a contentious history with Earth and with Carol in particular. Well, to be fair, with Nebula too as she used to be the second-in-command to a bigwig, but mainly they’re after Carol. Long story, but when they ambushed us two days ago, we were just in the way."
"I haven't thought about it," Tony says, leaning in to watch the kittens in the box. "Not really. Do you have any suggestions?"
Steve is pretty sure that was the moment he'd fallen head over heels for the man. But Tony was taken... until he wasn't anymore. The break up with Pepper had hit Tony hard, too, and it would have been tacky for Steve to make his interest known then. As if that wasn't enough, then came the murderous robot and JARVIS' destruction - even as it birthed Vision - which had complicated things even more, enough for Tony to quit. Steve worried that by isolating himself in the Tower, Tony was staying stuck in his head and perceiving everyone’s moves too much. Maybe, just maybe, Steve could help a little. He opens his phone and taps on the "F" app before placing it at his ear.
"It was complicated, but we did it. But all our messing about accidentally alerted past Thanos who managed to get to our time. We fought him again, and he almost got the stones, but you took them away from him and snapped Thanos and his army to dust to end it all."
"We'll be fine," Tony repeats. At this point, he's trying to convince himself as much as he wants to soothe Steve.
"Nice to see you too, Danvers." Carol links their arms together as they walk closer. Tony was aware that they knew each other, but they're friendlier than he'd thought. "Same for you, Tony," Fury adds as they reach him. He really looks happy about it, which is unexpected but welcome. "Glad to know that your death was as much a front as mine."
"Thank you," Tony adds, genuinely. "Miss Viv, don't charge this good man, and I'll leave some cash when we go, alright?"
Leading the Avengers doesn't allow Steve to spend all of his time at the Tower. He tries to get back into a regular groove, the one he'd carved for himself at the Compound once Tony had left, but his heart isn't in it. He seeks to sublimate his boredom with training, asking more from himself and the team, pushing harder and stronger. When the others start grumbling about it being too extreme, Steve relents and takes to running several times a day. The rhythm of it clears his head a bit, though never for long. Spending so much time with Tony has been like a drug; he's in withdrawal and has to shake it to be functional.
He goes to his room, sits on his bed, but knows that even if he lay down, he wouldn’t get any sleep. Not keyed up like this. Tony reasons that he'll take a walk, and god willing, drain the energy and frustration out of his system.
Tony remembers that well. It's everything before two days ago that’s blank. "Yeah, but we got a second chance and won."
"Well done, everyone!" Steve shouts. He's damn proud to be the captain of this exceptional group of players he's lucky to call friends. Family, even. "Good game!"
"I’m okay," Tony reassures him, willing the helmet away. Having less visual stimulus helps lessen the throbbing in his head, and Tony takes a deep breath. Maybe a bit shaky.
"Boss, there are ten more on foot outside too and rapidly incoming," FRIDAY says, tagging them on a map on the HUD. They'll join them in the back lot in a few seconds.
"No, no, I'll order take-out and bring it over. Did he eat?" Steve is ninety percent sure that Tony will refuse to meet him, anyway. Showing up with food is his best option.
He manages to open his eyes and blinks rapidly when he remembers where he is. Right, the Skrull ship, Vers… no Carol Danvers. He's Tony Stark, and he's from Earth. He's lived through shit, but came out stronger. Hell, he's Iron Man. Oh, that's the red and gold suit, of course. The thought is a real comfort, and Tony takes a long, hard—if a bit shaky—breath.
Steve looks devastated, face ashen and blue eyes shiny with tears. "Tony, no, I wasn’t hiding it from you. I didn't want to upset—"
"Thank God. You have- Thank God. Steve—" Tony's voice cracks. There's anguish in his tone and Steve's heart squeezes to hear it.
"I know." Too many people, Steve's afraid. Or they’d throw them in the river, but he doesn't say that out loud.
"Oh, great, I feel you two will love ganging up on me," Tony protests, but he doesn't mind. "Whatever I looked like, Fury took it seriously, because he showed me a journal. Dr. Lawson's notes, on the light-speed engine."
There's a defiant light in Steve's eyes, as if he's daring Tony to acknowledge why they both stayed silent.
Yes, there was bad blood between them and loads of hurt. But he remembers processing that hurt over time, moving past it, forgiving. And now there’s so much good. Limitless potential for more.
She peers into his eyes again, frowning, and her worry is still there when she leans back. "The readings are normal."
The hurt of his parent's death had never healed; something so big can only be managed, but to learn that it was a murder? Tony had rubbed at his sternum in self comfort and couldn't help but flinch when Steve tried to touch him.
Curious, Tony opens the various doors in the room. He finds two linen cabinets, one luxurious bathroom, a separate toilet, and the last door is locked. It must lead to the adjoining bedroom, but the people who prepared their quarters forgot to unlock it. It's not a problem; they'll ask at dinner, so it's opened before coming to bed. Tony isn't sure that he could find Thor, and he doesn't want to get lost. As he's actually tired, Tony elects to go stretch out on the bed. He toes off his shoes as he reaches its edge.
"Oh, you're strong too!" Morgan says, looking impressed. It's probably ridiculous how much it pleases Steve.
Tony pulls back with a smile. "Of course not. And I'll have you know that I'm even harder to kill now!"
"We'll need to discuss it with Fury, but I think it's for the best. Holding them as prisoners of war wouldn't be a deterrent for the Krees, anyway."
But right now? Tony is his, and his alone. They've talked about exclusivity and commitment, and it's something they both want. Steve is in love, sees this as a forever bond, and hopes that Tony gets there too. And he is determined to make them work.
"Please please please," Tony cries out, scratching some more. He doesn't have the energy to take flight again, or even find another way to catch Steve's attention.
Att-Lass and the other scouts are shifting slowly towards a fighting position, and Tony knows the foreplay is almost over.
"Give her a minute," Steve said. If he wasn't about ten feet away because of the ridiculously large bed, he would probably have scooped up his daemon protectively.
Tony's a little dazed from the post battle exhaustion—going binary is hell on his blood sugar—and the kiss, so he doesn't get it. "What?"
"Harder," Tony demands after a few minutes of slow and deep thrusts. Steve is steady as a metronome, and Tony's desperate.
"It's true that portals can open at various moments. But I built in a safeguard in the remote so that it returns to its reality at the moment it left it."
She does a small salute with her fingers to her eyebrow, but seems oddly nervous (as far as Tony can tell, he's known her for five days).
It blows that Tony has so little information himself, but at least he has pictures. He almost laughs. He's already one of those people who want to show off photos of their kid to everyone, and he hasn't even met the little tyke yet. Since Chancellor Almar explicitly asked, he figures it's not cruel to offer to show them.
The first and only other time Steve came here, anxiety was knotting his stomach. He was about to see Tony for the first time after five years and no contact at all, which had felt like an eternity. He's nervous now too, but for entirely different reasons. Reconciling with Tony during the Time Heist is the best thing that happened to Steve in… well, since the Avengers broke up, at least. Maybe the most fulfilling event of Steve's whole personal life, if he's honest.
Tony doesn't get it because his own skin is the right hue. Hell, Steve looks fine too, from the blue of his irises to the gold of his hair. Whatever the problem with Tony's vision is, it's selective.
Steve gets lost in the kisses, chasing Tony's agile tongue and marveling at how well they fit together. It's only when Tony squirms, pushing his hard cock against Steve's belly, that he pulls back.
"How are you feeling?" Tony asks, cupping Steve's cheek and peering into his eyes. "Are you hungry? Thirsty? Do you want to lie down?"
Steve really, really does. Eventually. Meanwhile he shakes his head, heart full of love and fondness for this ridiculous guy.
"Let's go set up our miscreants." Tony grabs Steve's hand and pulls him towards the bathroom. "And we'll get right on that."
"Worth a try." Att-Lass shrugs and drops the smile. He looks over Tony's shoulder, towards the light-speed engine's core. "Got right back to work, did you?"
The beast doesn't immediately come over to rip up Tony's throat. Hell, it shows no signs of aggression right now. After it breaks the prolonged eye contact, the wolf instead starts pulling out the darts jabbed into its body, dropping them on the ground. It blows Tony's mind. The animal knows what it's doing and why, a clear sign of intelligence.
"I was never dead. I was kidnapped, but I do tend to get out of those situations. This time with some help," he says, pointing to Carol. "Steve, please, listen to Rhodey. Stand down for five minutes so we can untangle this mess."
Tony wonders if it's because Steve became a werewolf that he can compare to his past basic human self. Or it's just that he knows his abilities are so much better than regular people. The affirmation is nonetheless the perfect set up for a joke. Tony, taking advantage of the fact that they've been walking way closer together than practical, nudges his elbow into Steve's side.
The Bolivian government asked the Avengers’ help when a part of their military went rogue. They debated on the legitimacy of helping, since it felt a lot like intruding in an internal struggle. Rhodes was very vocal on how it wasn't their place, which Natasha countered saying it was hypocritical to pretend the United States didn't do it all the time. But then the rebels started bombing crowded places, with powerful weapons reminiscent of the Chitauri tech, and it was an easy decision after that.
In a ploy to assuage his own nerves, Tony climbs on Steve's lap. If Steve's hands immediately hold Tony's hips to steady him, his brows stay knitted as he looks at him in puzzlement.
"Better, I'd say. Colonel Rhodes' visit helped." Jim spent a long weekend at the tower two weeks ago, but understandably didn't tell the team a lot about Tony's state of mind. "Boss is working a lot and not sleeping enough."
"Love?" he finally says when Steve pulls away, still grinning from ear to ear. It might come out as a squeak, which is frankly embarrassing.
"Answers, please!" Rhodey insists. He doesn't seem to mind Tony encroaching on his personal space though, even resettles so they're more comfortable. They've watched lots of movies like this over the years, and it's easy to slot back together.
"Sure, okay," Doctor Martin says with a shrug. "We have instructions and charts for the temperatures and feeding they need as they grow up. I'll get a copy."
"No, it's fine. I'd love to," he hurries to add when Steve looks disappointed. "But it's better that I don't, if I'm to fight. I need to keep the energy."
Speaking of plans, Tony hates to break the moment, but there's an ongoing situation, and the cargo bay of the Quinjet isn't the best place to plot their future. It will have to wait, unfortunately.
The kiss works wonders to unwind Tony. He experimentally starts moving his hips, and yeah, that's it. Less gripping, more sliding, and it goes from almost too much to really fucking good in no time.
"Excellent," Steve says as he starts kissing down Tony's chest. Tony mentioned wanting Steve's mouth earlier, which he can do (with great pleasure and enthusiasm, even if he's not as skilled as Tony).
Steve feels an instant wave of relief – which he sees echoed on Tony's face – and smiles widely. "Excellent, thank you, FRIDAY."
"Oh thank God, you made up," Rhodey exclaims while Pepper's own smile widens and she leans in to kiss both his and Steve's cheeks in congratulation.
Unable to talk because of the cock in his mouth, Steve hums in agreement. Tony always knows how to make him feel wonderful. He's so lucky.
“Enchanted.” Tony bows. “You are even more beautiful than the old Norse tales prepared us for.” Admittedly cheesy, but it’s the truth.
Steve gets lost in the rhythm of sucking Tony, his own need put aside for the moment. All of his focus is on making the blowjob good to keep earning Tony's praise. He's almost floating in it until Tony cups his jaw, forcing his head up so their eyes meet.
"You want a family, then?" Steve wouldn't have thought that of Tony before today. On the contrary, Tony plays the playboy card as if he'd gladly cruise through life splitting his time between seducing girls, working on his tech and being a superhero.
"It's okay," Steve interrupts. If he's hurt, he hides his disappointment well. "I just thought I'd make it clear. If you ever feel like taking me up on the offer…"
Tony laughs – the most wonderful sound in the universe, for sure – as they go check on their brood; human and feline alike.
Steve takes a pause, sucking in a shaky breath. The bad news is coming. Tony feels it, and goosebumps of unease erupt on his arms and neck. He stays silent, waiting.
But Tony knew she wouldn't harm him. Play bite, maybe, but never too hard. To prove it he suddenly let Cora go, who made another offended caw and landed tail over head in the middle of the bed. Tony then swiftly caught the stoat and tickled her instead. Lilly shrieked, twisting in his hold.
"See? You should have let me hit you on the head the moment you stepped foot into the Blaze." Carol grabs Tony by his armored shoulder and shakes him a little. "Good for you."
"We'd all love to have a little chat with that asshole," Nat says, standing at his elbow. Tony hadn't even noticed her approaching. "But it's best I don't, because mine would involve knives."
"Talos is close to a solution to completely disable the controller in your spine. Mine was less sophisticated. I guess they learned something there."
Tony gets ready for bed and ends up looking at pictures and videos of his little girl until his eyelids grow heavy. She’s perfect, and he loves her so much.
At this point, Tony's torturing himself too, and he's ravenous. He licks at Steve's skin again, making sure that it numbs the spot he chose. When he's certain that he's done all he can to make it less painful for Steve, he bites down hard, and sucks as his sharp teeth perforate the carotid.
Of course he noticed Tony's nerves. Over the last two years, they've learned how to read each other's moods. To be fair, they could only improve after the clusterfuck of their first interactions.
Thor joins them, still supercharged in a way that makes the hair stand up on Tony's body. His usual smile is absent, and his eyes are an eerie electric blue. Most of the time it's easy to forget that many people revere Thor as a God, he's such an amiable guy. At this moment, he's every inch the figure from the legends.
"So that wasn't planned," Tony remarks as he watches how Thor takes his passenger to a quiet corner, up on the cliff.
And that's a relief. He’s determined to get his memories back, but it would be terrible to have forgotten a significant other (though mainly for that person). Tony is glad he won't hurt someone like that.
"Really?" Steve's not trying to be dismissive here, but it doesn't seem to fit. He's opinionated and bullheaded, but also...  "But I've been the one, you know,—"
As Steve thought, it's not even close. He pushes and runs as fast as he can, which is difficult on the mix of snow and ice covering the lake, but Peter and Morgan soon take the lead. And keep increasing it. Tony eventually twists and gestures for Steve to join him in the tube.
It's easy, this new thing between them. They still argue sometimes, but it's mostly comfortable banter, and—if Steve isn't projecting—he'd swear there's flirting thrown in some days. Steve's only fear is having completely misread the situation, and to make things weird. He doesn't want to lose what they have.
Well, he'd seen that face in his near past, but as the Kree Supreme Intelligence. Tony can't even say he's surprised, since it's meant to be in the image of the person you respect the most. Hell, Tony has had a severe case of hero worship for Captain America for most of his life. It makes perfect sense.
They really do, and it fills Steve's chest with warmth. In fact, they make a very good team in so many situations, on and off the battlefield. He'd bet everything he has they'd be great together in other ways, but that's just a dream.
Tony's not sure if it's sarcasm or honest admiration—maybe a little of both—and he finds he likes it.
"Steve told me what you did." Not the ideal opening; it's a tad too aggressive, but it's to the point and without ambiguity.
Steve wishes his own Starkphone was close by, but it's near his abandoned chair on the other side of the pool. After idly swimming for a few seconds, not very graceful, but determined, Snowball goes to a nearby pool noodle. Sam holds it steady and she grabs at it, maybe to rest. She still seems calm and collected, so there's no urgency to get her out, or even help.
While Steve tried to be insistent but gentle, Tony just… drags her on the floor. Callie goes totally limp and lets it happen, as if it's the most terrible indignity she ever had to endure. Steve guffaws at the show and Tony grins at him.
"That's it. You've been so good, baby," Tony says, jerking him as Steve goes through a series of delightful aftershocks, and possibly a second orgasm, it's strong enough for it.
"Dear people of Asgard, please join me in giving a warm welcome to the leaders of the Avengers, from Midgard." Frigga's voice carries, strong and sure. Tony wonders if it's magically enhanced, or if it's because of exceptional acoustics from the room. "It is my pleasure to introduce Mister Steve Rogers, or Captain America, and Mister Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man."
After they'd set course for Earth, Tony had wondered if they should have gone to Asgard first, to make sure that the core's explosion hadn't caused too much damage. But, as Carol had argued, if the Krees want to get Tony back, or kill him too now, who knows, they'll probably go to Earth themselves. They
Tony can read through how his blacksmith self now has an arm thrown across the sheriff's wide shoulders, but the only stumbling he does is towards his companion. And, truth be told, Cowboy-Steve is not discouraging his behavior at all. Maybe they have something going on already. The act could be just to have plausible deniability for the sheriff to take a drunkard home.
"Did they ever," Bucky grumbles. Tony suspects Barnes had an involuntary earful in the Quinjet, but can't muster any shame about it.
"At the right time?" Tony insists. Better be safe than sorry. "Because we saw 616 twice in succession, and it was clearly not simultaneous events, since I was there in both."
Steve braces himself when he reaches the right floor. After a deep breath, he walks into Tony's workshop once FRIDAY opens the door for him. The music immediately falls from being cacophonic to just barely tolerable. It makes Tony react, even though he doesn't stop whatever he's working on, curled over his desk.
"They usually don't like it here either," Tony says, hands on his hips as he looks down at his girl in surprise.
Tony, who had access to a camera filming the stage, had almost melted at the smile that bloomed on Steve's face.
The raccoon, the infamous Rocket he supposes, is waving a wrench around and insulting Tony's intelligence. Of course Tony's giving back as good as he gets, in what looks like practiced banter. If he wasn't in the footage, Tony wouldn’t even believe this is real and would call out Steve for trying to punk him with a children's movie or something. Well, maybe not for kids, because the raccoon sure has a foul mouth. Tony's about to ask questions when he notices a walking tree. What in the fresh hell is that? Unfortunately, the camera focuses more on Tony than on the aliens, and he can hear Steve chuckling.
“Chaotic?” Steve is keeping a hand perched on his thigh, the little stoat huddled under his palm and peeking out from between his fingers. “Thor said that everyone in the universe has a daemon?”
"I was thinking of parking behind the moon and doing recon at Avengers tower. Who knows what happened in the last two years."
Tony and Rhodes are further down the hill pushing a big rubber inner tube up the slope. Meanwhile, Peter is effortlessly holding another under an arm, his second hand clasped in one of Morgan's as they climb to the start of the slide. Peter helps her sit in the tube as they wait for their next descent.
"How old are they?" Sam asks. He's still in the water, forearms crossed on the cement ledge as he examines the babies.
Corroborating Bucky's statement, a couple of old folks on the sidewalk in front of the house wave in their direction with big smiles and a cheerful "Hey Buck!"
The first to holler and clap is Thor, and the crowd follows with enthusiastic applause. Thor then makes his own speech.
"You're sure that's the good one?" he asks as the window appears. It looks like Reed's lab, but Tony can't see anyone on the other side. Shouldn't Wilson, Rhodey or someone else be there right now, looking for them? Steve called to explain they were being sucked into the first portal, after all.
Steve feels like he watched the scene long enough, and that it's time to let his presence known. Once he's at the top of the slide, he cries out.
"Got it. I'll sterilize and fill the syringes when it's ready," Tony says. He's already unpacked all the supplies on one of his lab benches. After they both caress the black kitten's head – Steve can't help himself either – they get to work.
Steve reluctantly untangles himself from Tony and gets up. A good look at the distance and terrain is enough to know it's a challenge he cannot win, no formal physics knowledge needed. But Morgan looks elated, clapping her red mittens in anticipation, and Peter seems so excited too that Steve can't refuse.
"I'm glad," Tony says. Embarrassingly enough, he then yawns so widely even as he tries to hide it with his elbow that it leaves him with tears in his eyes. "Sorry about that."
From what he sees on the display, this is the Mark XIX, down to the last inch. But it's impossible that in eleven years Iron Man's design hasn't changed. What formed is the last armor that Tony remembers, though, so there is logic to it. It also means that the nanites follow his actual thoughts.
It makes Tony throw back his head and laugh. He loves how Steve looks so proud of his joke. People don't realize how much of a dork Steve Rogers is, and Tony adores that side of him. He leaves Steve's belt, who takes over, and starts unzipping his undersuit instead.
feel right. He might be too gullible, but she makes more sense than Yon-Rogg and the Supreme Intelligence did for the last two years.
One second he was looking up from the floor, the next he's almost of a height with Steve, back on his feet. He wavers for a second, the shock and relief potent, but covers it by straightening his jacket's sleeves. It's one of his best three pieces; Tony likes to dress up for official meetings.
"I can back you up too," Carol says. "It's stupid to divide forces. Especially with the Krees possibly incoming."
Tony grew up on stories about the Howling Commandos and Steve. He knows that name. "Like your friend Bucky?"
It would be for Steve, but not just that. Maybe for himself, too, and in a small way for Bucky, who didn't ask for any of this. Tony doesn't want to think about Bucky Barnes and anything that has to do with the hard times of the last months, though.
Steve grimaces. "Exploded the planet. Part of the population fled, but they lost a lot of people. The refugees relocated to Earth."
Tony pauses, looking at the boot on his desk, then to a hologram screen that has a long list with empty checkboxes. He is, no doubt, very busy. Steve keeps his body language open and his face as hopeful as can be, and smiles when Tony nods.
"Who's this?" Tony gets up to have a better look. Also, how did he get to this floor in the first place, and even more so without them being alerted by JARVIS?
"This is very impressive," Tony says after the high priestess lists their superiority in this galaxy and how they rebuilt their world to be stronger after the fight with Ego, whoever that is. "I hope we can learn from you."
Casino patrons are coming out of hiding, now that the fight is over. It's interesting to see that it's not the fittest and scariest people who stayed, though there are several imposing beings around, but those who seem the cunning and curious type. Surely the perfect lot to spread word of the crazy Terrans.
"Hey, hey! Guys, I'm coming over!" Tony shouts as he runs towards the encampment. "Please don't shoot me! I need help!"
A bruised ego, but thankfully that's about it. It takes a back seat compared to the comfort of Steve's big hands which are so hot, it's absolutely wonderful. Tony nods to reassure Steve, and then goes limp, basking in the glorious warmth.
"There's that vibe, you know? The Bolivian president has clashed with the current administration, and elections are coming up. Equally plausible is that they have a shady dealer of Chitauri tech based here in America. As you know, I took over the Department of Damage Control with the federal government, but we couldn't round up
"You're the best," Steve exclaims. He lets go of Tony's wrist at last, but it's to cup his cheeks and lean in to press their mouths together, in a move incredibly similar to their first kiss. "I love you so, so much," he adds as Tony's head spins with the shock and awe of it, before kissing him again.
The light tendrils are not quite aligned, which means the drive won't function to full capacity; it's totally unacceptable and unprofessional. Who put this together?
"That never gets old," Steve says, looking suitably reverent. He looks awed by the armor, which is enough to make a man gloat (even if Tony doesn't remember how he managed this miracle).
Hushed conversations and concerned glances welcome them back in the main dining room, and Tony makes sure to look as composed and unperturbed as possible. Cora is now firmly planted on his shoulder and certainly won't stray to play with Lilly anymore, at least not for a little while. Thor, instead of sitting down, starts telling the guests about a recent skirmish with an interdimensional ice dragon that froze Central Park's reservoir in the middle of July. He's laying it on thick, and Tony jumps right into the storytelling, describing how Thor wrestled with the beast. Steve soon adds dry remarks about the comedy of errors the mission became, and in minutes they have the crowd roaring with laughter.
"I had an interview with TIME Magazine," Steve says. "A piece on remembering the Howling Commandos."
"We almost died together the first time we met," Nebula tells Tony, her tone a little clipped. She's tilting her head to the side as she observes him, and she reminds Tony of a bird.
"No, thank you," the doctor says, still starry eyed at the amount of money Tony gave the clinic. Steve didn't see the figure, but there were, at minimum, four zeros.
"Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell," Zemo says. "No. I'm here because I made a promise."
Tony's had sex with many people, and this kind of chemistry and instinctive understanding of a new partner is rare. But then again, he's not surprised—they've always moved well together on the battlefield. It's difficult to say how long Steve keeps Tony on the razor edge of coming; time is relative when so much is going on. But what’s certain is that Tony wants more. Now.
So it's not only Carol and Nebula's reputations that have reached this place. It's surprising, but Tony can roll with it. People have recognized him all his life; he knows the dance.
That makes Tony laugh. "Not exactly. But he arranged it so we'd feature on the front page of Popular Mechanics for the V8 engine I built at six. If I remember right, it gave the stocks quite a boost."
"Then I hope the Supreme Intelligence spills the beans soon," Anthony says. "Can I go binary now? I want to fly."
There won't be a welcome committee, but Carol says she knows a hot spot that will suit their needs and help to generate a good rumor.
Tony is ready for the attempted punch when Kol throws it. He catches it before it touches his face with a newly formed gauntlet and holds it there, stopped cold. With an opening like that, Tony can't resist his next line.
"Fucking you it is, then," Steve says, voice pitched lower than usual by desire. His pupils are blown wide, and Tony revels in knowing that he's able to turn Steve on that much. Not bad for an old man.
"What the hell, Steve? Why didn't you tell me? I would have helped even more, made it a priority! How come Hydra has him? Do you know if he's okay? Shit, of course he's not. Are
Yeah, no kidding. As if, among a long list of other things, taking down a jet with a motorcycle and then dunking three whole Helicarriers in the Potomac isn't grandstanding too. Tony's seen the footage. And huh, that's another memory back. He prefers it to the Siberia flashbacks, that's for sure.
"We're gathering it, but it was more important to stop the other super soldiers first. If the Doctor gets his hands on them…" He lets the threat of it hang in the air before he continues. "But I swear it is the truth."
"There we go!" he needles, grinning. "Almost a smile. I thought you'd be happier to see me, honestly."
He hasn't danced in years, at least not in a group like this. Before Afghanistan, probably. Carol shrugs and starts walking towards the dance area. When it seems as if Steve wants to stay behind, Tony grabs his hand and pulls.
"Come on, guys!" Cora says, startling them both. Their daemons are side by side on a dresser, watching them as if at a live play.
Tony cannot promise that, because it's prime teasing material. On the other hand, there's also a familiar grimoire and he taps on it.
At last, Tony puts his precious cargo on the table. The black kitten immediately starts meowing again.
They are not friends, not really. Acquaintances at best. Since Tony arrived in Timely, he mostly kept to himself. There's his business, and Tony is (or was) a fixture at the bar, but he rarely does social visits. Steve never tried to know Tony either, apart from keeping him out of trouble. To be honest, Steve used to be half-convinced Tony was heading towards an early grave, too pulled down by his past to wade forward. He's been a fascination for Steve from day one, though, hard worker by day and drunk by night. Definitely not the only Timely citizen with an alcohol problem, but the self-destructive degree was striking.
"Because it's Bucky!" Steve had cried out. He seemed to have surprised himself with that, and then had immediately lowered his tone as he repeated himself. "It's Bucky, Tony."
Tony has traveled all over the globe, from deserts to jungles and forests just like this one. He's been in multiple strange situations, and learned to trust his gut instinct. Which is why he's confident that this place feels off. For a moment he considers going back towards the encampment, but then chides himself. He doesn't need to run for protection like a frightened little boy. He picks up the pace and continues in the direction of the village.
"I never could have done it alone," Tony says while pulling on his sleeve so it covers the burns. "My team helped share the load."
Kol, on the other hand, is enraged. His face has turned brick red, and he stands up abruptly, pointing at Tony in anger.
"They tell the Krees that the Skrulls are terrorists and coming for everything the Empire stands for, when in fact they just want to be left alone and live in peace. It's the Krees that persecute them."
"Of course you'd want to help. You always want to help. But there's something more you need to know. Hydra made Bucky kill your parents."
That's sweet, but something Tony can't guarantee. Heck, it's the whole reason he broke up with Pepper after the Battle of New York.
"Hey, hey, no, it's all right," Tony says, catching one of Steve's wrists. He's petting Steve's nape again, soothing the earlier sting.
to be her. Also, Anthony can't seem to muster nearly as much vindictive energy for his father, which clearly makes him a terrible son.
Tony realizes with a jolt that he hasn’t seen any kids since they arrived. They've been on official visits and then a diplomatic banquet and party, but there weren’t any children in the streets either. Not even teenagers. Suddenly Tony feels a lot more sober. Maybe Almar reads the discomfort on his face because her expression turns wry.
Steve has enthusiastically tried many new things since they started sleeping together, only a week ago. He had little experience before Tony, only exchanged a few rushed handjobs and blowjobs, and Betty who rode him that one time while on the USO tour. Sex with Tony has been a great learning curve, and he's curious to know where it could go next. If it will involve ginger or not has to be determined.
Meanwhile, Jarons projects the amount of credits Tony won which attracts even more attention. Orange Lady is shaking her head in dismay, and most of the other players congratulate him on a game well played.
"I love you, yes." Steve looks utterly convinced of it, too. "I know it's been difficult between us, here, but I really do."
As a first significant difference, Thor is a woman. A reduced Ant-Man is sitting astride a huge flying ant, and Tony can't decide if it's cool or just too weird. Spider-Man is in a black and red suit, and even if lean and boyish-looking, Tony is certain it's not Peter. He doesn't move the same way. For whatever reason, there are two other kids on the team. A young girl with long brown hair, in a blue and red costume with a yellow bolt on the front; she currently has disproportionately large fists, at least twice as big as her head. There's also what looks like a boy with yellow and black armor with a sort of big red star protruding over the nose and eyes of his helmet. He's flying and shooting energy beams from his fists. The last Avenger is Falcon, but Tony can't stop staring.
Also, not only has half of the Stark legal team arrived to offer representation and build up their arguments about how arrests and incarcerations aren't justified in the name of urgency, but Pepper is there too. Tony has barely walked into the room before she beams and hurries over. He steps out of the armor for a hug and they hold each other tightly. They might not have succeeded very long as romantic partners, but she's one of the most important people in his life and he'll always love her.
He was talking faster and faster, color high on his cheeks and blue eyes a little wild. Tony had no idea what was going on.
Steve's quite a catch, for sure, and Tony's attracted to him. But then again, interest is only part of the equation. Tony's pretty certain that at this very moment, he and Steve would have vastly different expectations if they got together. If Steve's been interested for an entire year, he doesn't just hope to scratch an itch.
Zemo is watching him with eyes widened in shock as Tony steps into the room, then reins in his power.
"I am delighted you came to visit tonight," Steve murmurs as his gaze falls to Tony's lips. God, he wants, so fiercely. He better not have misjudged this; it would kill him to be denied.
"He looks healthy. Maybe his parents were in danger and sent him here to protect him." Steve is grasping at straws. He has no idea what happened either.
Steve smiles as they start walking. And proof that Tony is completely turned around is that Steve leads them in the opposite direction that Tony would have taken if by himself.
"Thank you." Somehow, Tony interrupting him seems to have made Steve relax a bit. "It struck me that in four of the five different realities, if we don't count the Old West, I made it to the future. Even the one universe where we didn't see me, Reed said that I was there at one point."
"Yes," Tony says, caressing his face and marveling that he can have this. Heck, a love declaration is the first thing Steve says in the morning. "I love you too."
It makes Tony smile, as if he’s surprised. Steve doesn't know what he did wrong that Tony doesn't realize or believe he'd be welcomed back enthusiastically.
When the Accuser Warships are nothing but rubble, Carol gestures to the surface and they go back to the battle around the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility. It's mostly over there by now, the bulk of the Kree force either dead, out of commission, or face down on the ground with their hands crossed over their nape. There are a few ongoing skirmishes, but when Tony and Carol fly over, the last Kree soldiers standing surrender. Good. Spider-Man is already busy going through the battlefield, webbing the prisoners' wrists and ankles.
"He didn't convince me at first either, but they're okay. Wanda is crazy powerful, but she still has to fully master her powers. Which led to an incident in Lagos, two months ago. She deviated a bomb aimed at Cap in the air, but it blew up parts of a building. 26 collateral victims, including 11 relief aid workers from Wakanda."
"You know you want it," Steve says, dragging a second stool towards the workbench and flopping down.
He’s being weird, borderline cheeky, but it’s Thor. He’s often strange. He waves them goodbye and leaves, presumably for his own quarters.
Steve's eyes widen, and he flushes bright red while Tony hides a smile behind his hand. His heart has sped up: he understands exactly what Steve is trying to say.
"Isn't he the cutest?" Tony takes the boy into his arms, gently supporting his head as if he's done this a million times.
"Hydra probably gave him the serum when he was tortured in Azzano. We figure it's the only reason he survived the fall from the train." Steve pauses, looking down at his lap. "I should have looked for him."
"Yes, Chancellor, we sure did. Everything was great. Thank you again for the honor of designating Earth a sister planet to Iantus. We're very grateful."
Steve's phone is a surprisingly large Stark Industries smartphone. It's a beauty. After poking at the thing for a minute, Steve selects whatever he wants to show and passes it over, still looking gleeful.
He's so startled that his heart almost leaps out of his chest. By reflex, Tony swipes at the black bird
"It's the name of the planet and its people. They're a highly advanced civilization and respected as such. They also take themselves very seriously," Carol says. "As an advance notice, every one of them is the color gold. Maybe they let that get to their heads."
"It's a lot of work, Mr. Stark," the doctor says gently. "Newborns need to be fed every two hours, day and night. They need to be kept at the right temperature, because they can't regulate their own. I don't recommend it for a first foster experience."
It makes Tony laugh. "I don’t think he’s that young, but yeah, still a baby. I was never interested. He hit on
That's a good point. "I'd agree with you if the guy and his family hadn't disappeared. Maybe they're stuck in one of these realities, but with no remote."
to walk with the harness on," Tony says. "I tried, but your princess is simply too good for that. She turns into a fluffy mop."
The smile that blooms on Tony's face is gorgeous. "Oh, good, fantastic. Me too. I mean, yeah, that works for me."
"Oh, I'd dance," Tal says while shoving away a burly man with green skin who decided he wanted to punch the stranger in the shiny robot suit too.
The numbers change, this time saying '3490', and the alternate reality in view is at least not in the middle of a battle. In fact, it looks like a lawn party with a mix of people either well dressed or in superhero costumes, mingling in little groups. Tony is searching for himself—he's been the only constant from the start, maybe because he's the one opening each reality—but can't see his counterpart. Since there are many heroes he doesn't know at all on the portal window, this is definitely not their universe.
. The deep, wet kisses are making Tony's head spin and he doesn't want to stop. They've had so many problems talking to each other over the years, but there’s no ambiguity here. They both need more, hands roaming over each other, trying to claim and give at the same time.
"Like the Muses or the Graces?" Tony cocks his head, considering. Steve doesn't know why he's constantly surprised when Tony shows him that he's knowledgeable in subjects other than science and pop culture.
"Oh shit, I am so sorry!" Steve apologizes, guilt twisting his stomach as he thumbs away a tear that leaked from Tony's eyes.
"Boss has been eating snacks all morning, but he has not had a proper meal. Do I understand right that you don't want me to tell him you are coming over?"
"Seeing them without background info might jog your memories," Steve says with a shrug. "And if not, I still think it's pretty cool that you get to experience having a first impression all over again."
"Good," Tony says, touched by how determined Steve sounds and looks. "For that we all need to be together, yeah? No going rogue bullshit."
Cora turning into a crow during Tony’s own adolescence, when he was admittedly quite a handful, gives weight to the trickster interpretation.
"Mmm." Tony makes a face, as if he's considering it. "On one hand, that's terrible. But I really, really want you to shake my glow stick, so I'll allow it. Don't break it though."
"Take your shirt off," Tony demands after letting him go (which is almost disappointing, Steve really enjoys the hair-pulling). "I want to see those lovely shoulders."
"Oh," Tal says after looking over. His smile actually widens, so he's not intimidated by Captain Marvel. Good for him. "Welcome to Knowhere then."
"And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Rhodes. I can't."
"Of course." Tony cannot resist bending down to peck at Steve's lips one last time, who cups his cheek with his strong hands again and deepens the kiss. It's a struggle to pull away. "I'll be fine, love. I've fought him seventeen times, and I've always won." The affirmation doesn't seem to be the reassurance Tony hoped it would be as Steve's brow furrows. "Over two hundred and twenty years?"
"Yeah, it's okay. I'm good. Let's do this." He even shrugs a shoulder, like a boxer getting ready to fight again.
"So, did you give the vet another absurd amount of money?" Steve asks with an eyebrow raise. He knows Tony, and he's convinced of it.
After a small woofing noise, the wolf starts to approach, which makes Tony instinctively recoil in fear. It stops the wolf, who looks… hurt at the reaction, clear as day. His big head droops and he lies on the ground, looking at Tony with widened eyes. He shuffles forward a bit, slowly and with a whine, then once more when Tony stays immobile.
"You knew someone killed my mom, both my parents—" Tony says, tone rising. He suddenly pauses as a few details click together. It unfortunately makes a perverse sort of sense. "It was Barnes, wasn't it? Who murdered them."
"He convinced the girl and her brother Pietro, a speedster, that Hydra had lied to them. That the Avengers really meant to do good in the world. Speaking of Clint, we learned he has a wife and three kids on a farm in Missouri."
"This is interesting. Not the armor I was expecting, I must admit. Unless you transitioned to the red and gold, Colonel Rhodes?"
Tony winks at her as she waggles her eyebrows playfully. "We get that a lot. But no, he lacks the refined taste that would allow him to like me that way."
Her protectiveness makes Tony's heart sing. They forged a bond when stranded in space and in the years since once Nebula got integrated into the Avengers. She's almost his second daughter, and Tony is so glad he remembers their relationship again and hopes more memories return to him soon.
"I gotcha buddy," WIM-Tony says, as he holds Other-Steve up, still covered in electrodes and other bits of machinery, including a metallic collar.
"I know, I know," Steve admits. When the team began living together, Steve thought Tony couldn't take care of himself. He eventually realized that Tony skipped organized meals, but he did eat. Sleep is another matter, though, but not one Steve wants to argue about today.
Yes, okay, that's Sharon Carter, but she's a good fifteen years older than the one in their reality.
"No dog and pony show for her." Tony is pleased about his, and most likely Pepper's, life choices. "So you met her not that long ago then."
Tony grins. That's when he knows he's made an actual friend: when they’re not just tolerating his shit but also actively enjoying the ride and everything that he is.
Rhodey sighs. "He changed, after you died. Or we thought you died. Retracted into his shell, is all about the job. He doesn't tolerate any slip ups, especially if he himself makes an error."
"The Supreme Intelligence is full of bullshit, even though it had this handsome face." Tony points at Steve, knowingly breaking a Kree taboo by voicing that information. "That's quite the army you brought with you. What are you planning to do if I don't join you?" He had asked Att-Lass the same thing, but he wonders if he'll get the same answer now.
"Come on!" Carol yells to the four men and three women walking toward them, taking cover behind booths and abandoned playing tables along the way. "You want me? Then come and get me!"
Tony is curious about how everyone took his death, especially Steve, but he doesn't know how to ask. It's probably a very crass question, anyway.
Tony gets back on his feet with Steve’s aid—he's a little shaken but alright—and with Nebula, they walk to Carol.
"Unfortunately, yes," Rhodey says, dragging his palms on his face. Now that Tony examines him closer, he looks exhausted. "I only have Nat and T'Challa to help me, and I'm in way over my head."
have fantasized about Tony being as affectionate with him as Gomez is with Morticia. Their fictional girl is pretty awesome too, and it would suit a black kitten.
"Cap. He doesn't trust anyone anymore, especially not agencies and the like, and says that our hands would be the safest. Sam's with him, also Clint, Wanda, and Pietro. That I know of. And then there was the mess with Barnes in Vienna—"
"Awesome," Tony says. "Let's get this show on the road, boys. And when we're done, the party's on me!"
"We learned that Hydra made strategic, targeted assassinations to further their cause all this time." Steve stops again and turns his head to look straight at Tony, his expression sorrowful. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Tony, but Zola clearly hinted that Howard was one of their hits."
Tony is no doubt about to argue when a man with a lab coat joins them from a second door that leads to the interior of the clinic. His nametag confirms that this is indeed Doctor Martin.
"I'm fine, Lilly," the crow replies, allowing the inspection. It looks up at Tony with clear affront. "Rude, by the way."
These are not the men he was expecting to see at all. The all black uniforms and ugly octopus patches are clear; they are Hydra. Fuck. Seven of them, so too many to fight, even if he tried.
Is it because he knows Steve is about to do the "I'm glad you are alive, but I need to make our break-up official" speech? Tony would run away from that one too, if he could. Hell, he's tempted to do just that himself. But Steve doesn't even spare a look at Bucky as JARVIS pipes up.
"Just so you know? If you ever get another ring, I'd consider it." Which is a bald-faced lie. He'd say yes in a heartbeat. "If that's what it takes to make you stay over. I love morning sex," he adds with a wink.
He doesn't miss how that ratchets up the desire in Tony's eyes. Steve almost breaks his act to smile: it's great to know that they both can play this game. Give the other what they want.
Cora and Lilly stayed with them for several minutes but are currently exploring the space behind their chairs. There are a few plants and the ledge of an opened window decorated with golden baubles that Cora is poking at. By her side, Lilly is keeping a vigilant eye on the room and personnel serving food and walking close by, as if the crow isn't fifteen times bigger than her. Something is churning in Tony's chest, and he can't help but check what they're doing every few seconds. Steve seems to feel the same insecurity when their daemons are out of sight, because he constantly turns his head, too, brow furrowed.
"Look, we don't have time for this shit. Things just changed, and we can't afford a split team. Even the damn Accords will have to be put on the back burner. But I still have to bring you in so Ross doesn't send a J-SOC unit to shoot you in the head on sight."
He focuses and hears it again, and he can tell by how high pitched it is that it must be a kitten. Maybe it got trapped?
Then he'll go back home, before the sun rises, leaving them both with the memory of an enjoyable moment. Simple, easy, and clean.
"Wow, it's not like me to be the first to leave a party, but I'm beat," he says. "I think I'm going to use one of these rooms you just offered."
"Okay, okay," Sam says, raising his hands up in surrender. Clearly he thinks Steve is overreacting at the tease. "Nice of you to go help."
Want is coursing through Steve's veins, and he’s longing to hold Tony's hand, at the very least. To take him in his arms and kiss him if he's lucky.
Tony understands why the prospect of him and Barnes getting along would make Steve happy. And who knows, with time it could happen. But he's not ready for that yet.
It doesn't sound right. The Skrull memory-machine pops up with a new souvenir. Memory-him is on the edge of a stage, facing many journalists also sitting on the floor, and is giving a speech.
"If I were you, Tal, I'd worry more about blond-and-buff over there," Jarons the croupier says, entertained. "He's plotting your demise as we speak."
"Yes, Sam went to get your suit and shield. We'll pick you up on the tower's helipad, ETA 20 minutes," Natasha says.
"Wow." Tony reaches towards the wolf again, who once more licks his fingers. "Hey, stop that! So you're telling me you're a friend." The wolf nods yes, tail swishing vigorously. "And I'm guessing Hydra is not your friend." This time the wolf looks back towards the destroyed campsite, baring his terrifying teeth in a snarl. It's clear enough. "Good wolf."
"That's horrible." Tony can't help the shudder that goes through him and rubs at his sternum. That amount of torture for so long... He can't even imagine.
It's hard to resist making the picture of Tony and the babies the background of his phone. The only thing that stops him is knowing that anyone seeing it would tease him mercilessly. No one needs to know that Steve gazes at it every night when he goes to bed (and hopes and hopes and hopes).
The smile soon morphs into a frown, though. Rhodey doesn't let go of Tony's upper arms as he asks questions.
"Come on, come on!" Morgan urges, holding tacked-on safety handles, and has flattened on her tube to be as aerodynamic as possible.
"Kinky sex, yeah," Tony says. "Which is why I was so surprised? Especially since I thought you said you'd done it before."
"Hydra found Bucky after he fell from the train in the Austrian alps. They wiped his memories, brainwashed him, and made him an assassin for their cause."
"We've heard of you," the high priestess says, giving Carol a considering once-over. She's probably the only human who registered as a threat, pre-Thanos.
There just isn’t enough air, and his heart is racing so much. Soon the missing arc reactor won't matter anymore because his ticker will fail anyway. Oh, God, this is a nightmare. Tony sits up in bed, which makes his head turn, but then curls forward, forehead on his knees and hands on his own neck.
Steve parks behind a SUV with a rental license plate, and takes a moment to breathe, rubbing his suddenly clammy hands on his thighs. Everything will be fine, Tony invited him to visit, even insisted he come over.
Steve blushes again but doesn't evade the question. His pulse has sped up under Tony's fingers, and he wonders if he should let go of Steve's wrist.
Maybe it's different with Earth daemons, who are so rarely corporeal that they just don't care about those rules once they have a body.
He learns later that Chancellor Almar had been late for a vote to decide if Earth merited the title of "sister planet" and therefore the Iantusians' protection. A vote that went in their favor, which is even better news than he’d thought. Nebula explains that it’s very rare and extremely valuable. Just that, she declares, makes the entire trip a success.
"Excellent." Steve gives them a brief wave – he wants to go now – and starts moving towards the exit. "I'll email later, I don't know how long I'll be at the tower for, yet."
The letter Tony is holding up for Rhodes to look at is from Dugan to Dernier, who is convalescing in London. Tony points to a passage near the end.
"They did," Steve says, and that's an additional worry. "But they were eventually all executed, before we even reached them. As far as we know."
Tony whistles out slowly. Wow, it's been years since he's been so productive. And it's not because he has less work, though he's getting better at laughing in Fury's face when he asks for the impossible. He still has Stark Industries and the Avengers, as always, so the only difference is certainly the time freed up by not having a personal relationship. Which also comes with, amongst other perks, the freedom to sleep only four hours a night if he wants to, with no consequences other than his own exhaustion.
It's a relief. There was always a chance that Tony's true identity and his long and tumultuous life would prove too weird for Steve. But this is good, very good.
"Where am I?" trapped Steve asks as WIM-Tony unhooks or even breaks the gear tying Other-Steve to the contraption. Once free, he slumps forward into WIM-Tony's arms, dead-limbed.
A week in, they're eating in the little dining room from their current safe house in Santa Cruz when Rhodes snort-laughs while looking at his phone.
Thor throws back his head and laughs, and Tony relaxes; he might tease, but Thor wouldn't put them in danger.
"It's a girl?" Tony asks, reaching to touch its small folded ears. She bumps into his fingers and meows again.
"Oh my God!" Tony exclaims, nose to nose with his own. He sounds excited though, a smile splitting his face, and not alarmed at all. How can he be so cute?
Ah, so they didn't stop butting heads then. That’s to be expected; they’re both very opinionated people.
"She hates it. But if I put a leash on her and take her out, at least she explores," Tony says, clipping a gold lead to a hoop on her back.
"You've got me. You've had me for a long time. But tell me." Steve looks so earnest, so willing to please. "I want to give you everything you want. Make you happy too if you'll let me."
"I'd prefer bashing his head in, but yeah." He takes a fistful of the sleeve of Zemo's coat with his metal hand and tugs hard to rip the fabric, before pulling until he has torn off a part of it. "Open your mouth or I shove it in regardless," he tells Zemo.
White Iron Man Tony walks into the room only to raise his hands, repulsors ready, when the gyrosphere drops to the floor with a resonant metallic clunk.
Tony can't believe he missed it. Steve Rogers attracted to men? And interested in him? He didn't get that memo.
"Thank you. But my question is, do you understand this message?" Tony asks, with a large gesture meant to encompass the battle around them and above. "Earth is off limits, is that clear? All we want is for you to leave us alone."
Tony is so tired that his eyes are burning, and now that he has shut down for the night he realizes how late—or, actually, how early—it is. Six-thirty in the morning, to be exact.
to show me the pictures again," Wanda says, teasing; Steve has shown them so many times. "No, really," she adds. "I'll have a better appreciation for them now."
Tony is parched. He nods once more and Steve smiles, happy that they can communicate. Of course, Steve is talking about water, which is fine, but what Tony would need right now to regain energy is blood. He's dreamed about feeding on Steve for months, but not as a helpless bat. When he finally sinks his teeth in the man, he'll make sure it's as enjoyable as possible for all parties involved. And it will be with enthusiastic consent or not at all; Steve deserves a clear-headed choice.
"Come back here." Steve hooks his hand around Tony's neck, who very willingly goes back to making out. If they start sweet and heartfelt, the kisses rapidly turn deep and wet. God, Tony missed this always electric connection with Steve. He is starved for it, hands grappling with the buckles and zips of the Captain America uniform in his quest for skin.
He's about to reach for her when she stands up on slightly shaky legs and stumbles towards his outstretched hand with determination. Steve's jaw drops.
Tony frowns, confused, just as the band plays Wagner's "Here Comes the Bride". He twists to see Iron Man walking down the aisle, holding Rhodey's arm. He's in full armor, though the visor is opened… and that's when Tony spots the glaring difference between him and this Tony. It's him, but also not at all since the person being given away by Rhodey as Steve's bride is a woman. She put a little veil on the helmet which looks slightly silly, but also cheeky and like something he'd do as a joke too.
"Frigging Electro," Johnny says, pointing over his shoulder. Strips of his own uniform binds and gags Dillon. He looks disgruntled, but who knows how long ago they have tied him up.
"It's going to take a minute," Steve says as Tony stares at the whirring machine. There are promising liquid sounds.
"I tried to grab the remote before we were totally through," Reed says, eying the device in Tony's hand. "But Electro got in the way."
But Steve is so much more than that. After clashing hard at first, they had learned each other's language. And once they stopped perceiving attacks in the way the other talked, they got along great. They'd even started seeking each other's presence more and more. If Iron Man and Captain America were a formidable duo on the field from the get go, eventually Steve and Tony grew to be close friends. And then more.
“Yes, as far as we know.” Frigga touches the shoulder of the massive boar sitting next to her chair. “An intrinsic part of all of us, whether or not they manifest.”
Only a fool would refuse such an offer. And Tony might have moments of stupidity—like convincing himself they were just fuckbuddies, or that Steve wanted to be with Bucky—but he's still in the top three most intelligent people in the world.
"I said I'm fine, guys," Tony insists. He checks the HUD… and the fight looks like it’s over. At least on the ground, since FRIDAY displays zero Kree threats at the moment. "Looks like you got them all."
"Someone will be here soon," Steve says, keeping his voice low. It hurts to see how Tony slumps, mouth down-turned.
"It was horrible. I'll leave it at that. You were furious, and you tried to kill Bucky. We fought, us two against you. I couldn't let you kill him." Steve looks distraught once more, but it doesn't do much to soften the blow of hearing that. "So I left you behind with a broken suit. Another mistake."
Tony is about to vibrate out of his skin with nerves now that he's alone with Steve, who has kept a gentle but firm hold on his hand.
Tony's smile turns mischievous. "It's the baby, right? That made you ask? Thanks for the assist, bumblebee," he says before kissing the boy's cheek.
"Don't drop us," Nebula says, climbing onto his right boot and hugging the armor's torso as Tony locks his arm around her.
Tony then scoops the cat out and puts her on the workshop floor, out of the kitten's enclosure. Snowball then proceeds to crawl towards DUM-E, who is hovering close by. The robot looks thrilled, lowering its head closer to the floor so the kitten can investigate.
And the battle before them is a total mess, too. Some of those weird beings that look like the Avengers assist them, and fight the robot and more villain beans. Plus the kids from the beginning, some dressed up as wannabe superheroes, who just jump in the fray. Tony sees one of them whack a Red Skull bean over the head! And not only do the Avengers have mini-them, they seem to have their powers. Bean Iron Man has clear repulsors, and after Lady Thor throws her hammer, the Thor bean catches Mjolnir and uses it at its turn on the main robot.
The good news is that something happens: a portal window appears, just as before, which means they have a way to travel between realities.
They’re being fired at, and the nanites shape into a blue energy shield that Tony uses to protect Steve and himself at the same time. That's new and came instinctively, but he's glad for it. Steve doesn't have his own shield, so he's practically defenseless (if that can ever be said of Captain America). Nebula is right behind them, so she’s out of harm's way too for the moment.
"That's it," Tony murmurs. He's looking at Steve as if he'd eat him up, not that the reverse is going to happen. "Undo your pants, show me your cock, too."
"You were amazing," Tony raves, and it's cute how she ducks her chin a little, bashful and clearly pleased with herself. "I'm going to find something to drink."
Now that he's not flying anymore and the adrenaline is crashing, Tony is freezing out on the window sill. Thankfully, a bit of warmth from Steve's bedroom wafts outside, but the unattainable soft glow a few inches away is torture. If he could enter, Tony would fly to the bed and bury under what looks like soft blankets. It would smell like heaven, he's certain of it.
Tony tilts his daughter's face up and kisses her forehead. He's such a loving father, it makes Steve melt every time he witnesses it.
Since the early 1800s, every ten or twenty years Victor leaves the Old Countries for a gander at taking control of the Eastern Seaboard's magic users and supernatural creatures. Until now his efforts were systematically crushed by Tony and his allies, and he'd retreated to Latveria. After twenty-five years without a peep, he'd written to Tony to formally request a treaty. But you can't teach an old dog new tricks: it wasn't a peaceful overture at all.
There's a wet bar just inside the patio doors, but Steve stops short as he hears voices. Once again, his sensitive hearing makes him privy to a conversation he was certainly not supposed to overhear. Tony and Rhodes are in the common kitchen, and haven't noticed Steve come in at all.
"Yeah, yeah, sure," Tony says, cupping his two hands together. Steve puts the white kitten with the black one, which seems to settle the latter. "Oh God. They're so small!"
He's coming and coming, making a mess, and Steve revels in it. Tony almost snarls in his ecstasy and tightens his grip on Steve's hair some more. It hurts, but also reverberates Steve's pleasure higher.
Steve has finished emptying his syringe and the white kitten is like putty in his hand, drunk on milk.
"Wow." Of course Tony would have loved to have answers. And he might not have been Bucky Barnes' biggest fan at that moment. But Steve had assumed... what? That Tony would hunt Barnes, Steve's best friend who was tortured into becoming a killer, until he could bring him to justice? Or even worse, kill him? He thought Steve knew him better than that. Maybe he hadn't known Tony at all, after all. "Okay then."
Tony shuts him up with another kiss. He knows the Starforce's tactics; they'll observe for a while before jetting to the surface. With all of his protests, Steve almost immediately yields and responds. They trade soft and unhurried kisses for long minutes, and it's fantastic. Tony wonders if he should push his luck for more until Wanda clears her throat when he grabs Steve's ass. Steve tries to pull away, but Tony shushes him. He pulls his hands up as if he got caught at a middle school dance though, and nuzzles Steve's neck.
Steve's determined expression confirms the hopelessness of any escape attempts as he all but snarls and grabs Tony's forearm too in order to pull back harder. "No."
It makes Tony pause. He pulls back, frowning, as he sits up on Steve's thighs. His hands are indeed faintly luminous, and by the way Steve cups his cheek, eyes wide, Tony's face must be doing the same. Uh, so that's new. Probably all the excitement, but he's convinced it's not dangerous. He reins it in, just to be safe.
, I get that. But I like you a whole lot, and now you know. I swear I won't make it weird." His mouth contorts in a self-depreciating grimace, the first sign of embarrassment. "Weirder, anyway."
Steve scrunches his nose adorably before he answers. “There’s a lot I don’t understand either, Your Majesty. Starting with daemons. It was quite a surprise for us.”
And wow, that's so huge that Tony is immediately flustered. He untangles his hand, even as Steve seems reluctant to let go, to put it over his heart.
"Oh." Very true. He loves having tangible proof that Tony wants him, touches him, claims him. It's frustrating that the serum takes the marks away so fast. And there's no denying that the hair-pulling worked for him.
"Yeah." Steve tilts his head as he examines Tony in a move that echoes how he acted as his furry self a few hours ago. "You're taking this extremely well."
"A baby?" It stumps Steve totally. A boy, he assumes, dressed in blue with a yellow beehive on the front of his shirt.
"Good evening, Stark." It's the full moon, which bathes Tony in its soft glow, making him look younger than usual. He's gorgeous like this, especially when he smiles at Steve.
"Sam! Baxter Building, 33rd floor, a portal is pulling Tony in, he's stuck. It's probably what took the Fantastic Four!"
"I can't believe you didn't tell me," Tony says, more an affirmation than an accusation this time. "To spare me? Of course it hurts. And I'm angry. Fucking Hydra, Steve, and you didn’t tell me."
He looks just about ready to cry and that's unacceptable, even if it would be from happiness. Tony leans down to kiss his fiancé—he's engaged!—and it's soon not enough. He needs to be closer, he's missed Steve so much. Tony slides down to straddle Steve's thighs, then doesn't stop there. He puts a hand behind Steve's head and uses the other to gently but firmly push Steve down until he's lying on his back. Tony's using some of his Kree-acquired super strength and Steve visibly notices, as his eyes widen.
There's a nice little coffee shop, three blocks away, that they found a few years back and prefer over the big chains. They don't even need to talk about it, falling in step in the direction of the shop. Halfway there, they stop to let a young man push a full trash bin on wheels closer to the end of an alley for pick-up. Tony has his phone out, distracted by emails, and it's probably because they're not talking that Steve hears a faint sound that catches his attention. Was that a mewl? He normally wouldn't bother, thinking it's a stray cat, but it seems to come from
"It's fine," Tony reassures Steve, squeezing his hand on the mattress. "Huge, but I like a challenge."
Tony huffs, amused, and takes a second to lean in for a peck on the lips, battle be damned. Steve raises the shield instinctively to cover their heads as they kiss. Someone does fire on it, so good reflex.
Without waiting for an official countdown, Tony pushes on the tube so it engages on the slope. He takes quick steps until he's running, and jumps onto Rhodes’ back who whoops in delight. They managed a good acceleration, in Steve's opinion. Meanwhile, Peter began counting out loud.
"Purpose, I know," he interrupts. Yon-Rogg's frown intensifies and he gets in a combat position, which Anthony is quick to mimic. "Will you tell me my ultimate purpose today, Roggy?"
That's when the shooting starts. Yon-Rogg and the rest of the Starforce team are trying to take him down. Or more precisely, to grab the core of the light-speed engine. Memory-Anthony fights back even though his armor isn't complete, the Kree fighters having intercepted or shot down many parts. Anthony stands defiantly between the Krees and his work table that has the core and his notes, one palm raised showing a blue energy source.
"True," Steve says, then goes stock still while his eyes widen slightly. Tony is about to ask what is wrong as Steve looks up. When Tony does too, he sees the cause: they're under a strand of mistletoe.
"You did, and again, it was the least I could do," Steve says, earnestly. "Thank you, Tony. You're the reason we won."
"She would." Natasha excels with those tasks. "Do you think it could wait a few days? Or it will be too late to find evidence?"
"No, that would be cheating," Rhodes says. They finally reach the top of the slide, and Jim climbs in the tube. "You need the exercise, and you know it."
Steve huffs in amusement. "Pretty cool, but I'd prefer seeing as little as possible of this new green blood."
"Oh, even better." Zemo smiles and doesn't look half as shocked as he should be at Tony's appearance. "I'm sure you could get to me, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why I made you come here."
"Why did you not tell me immediately that I have a daughter?" Tony says, hurt. He can't believe Steve hid something this big from him.
Laughing, Tony nods. "Right, right. What about the Maldives? I have a private island. No distraction, just us."
Steve perks up. "Yeah, they are." He points behind his shoulder towards the Hydra camp. "I'll have a trail to follow now with the two who got away."
The last two hundred feet of the private road, after a final bend, reveal Tony's house framed with snow-heavy trees. It's beautiful and picturesque, and Steve understands why Tony sought this refuge during his recovery post Thanos. The place is untouched by the turmoil that followed half of living things suddenly coming back and trying to fit in their broken world.
But they're here for a reason. Rhodey needs to bring in at a minimum Steve, Sam, and Barnes. And the latter two are currently out of sight. Tony, who couldn't resist suiting up with Iron Man—he might have had amnesia, but he definitely missed being armored up—asks JARVIS to find them using the security cameras. They shouldn't be far.
The exterior resembles a rundown hangar, fitting the rough industrial neighborhood. The interior isn't magically more classy, which was to be expected. There's a counter to the right that at first glance looks like every coat check in a club ever, save for a wall covered with a series of lock boxes. Tony supposes it’s for weapons. Big Purple gestures to the man and woman working the desk who nod and then go back to their conversation, barely sparing them a look. Deemed unarmed and vetted, they then proceed to the main part of the establishment. It's a mix between a casino and a stripper joint, where small, dimly lit alcoves curling around mini-stages alternate with tables with croupiers and their players. Since the mostly naked performers in the booths use their preferred music at the same time, it causes a chaotic wall of noise that’s hard to describe. It isn't helped by the loud conversations and occasional cheering from the gambling spots. Tony catches Steve wincing at the cacophony of it all and commiserates.
"I sure did. They told me you were a traitor, and I believed it. Why the hell did you join the Skrulls, anyway?"
"Your lab, and the bots, and JARVIS, they're amazing—" Peter continues. "I developed an extra-resistant fabric, and it's pretty cool, I could show you—"
Steve lowers himself and tentatively touches the unmoving cat, with hair so pale it's mostly pink, and he's relieved when it squirms. Not dead then, that's good.
"Yes. Start a heating pad, and bring me warm formula and two syringes with feeding nipples, please. Thank you."
"Dearest Anthony," Thor says as he finally lets go. Suddenly, why the Kree called him Anthony instead of Tony makes a lot more sense. Thor only pushes Tony far enough away to examine him, enormous hands still holding his shoulder. "I am so pleased to see you again. I thought it would only be in Valhalla."
"Wow, you're just putting that out there, huh?" Tony says. It is admittedly brave as fuck. And pretty thrilling, even though Tony's heart is too bruised for him to think about romance or sex at the moment.
He's immediately charmed. It seems that Tony's incapable of coding an AI without an attitude, and he wouldn't want it any other way.
Steve clearly interprets his reply as Tony saying he'd not miss him, with the way his smile drops. It makes Tony realize that their falling out must still feel raw to Steve, too. Maybe Tony wasn't the only one hurt by the whole mess, which makes him pause.
"He followed you to Titan but was in the fifty percent culled. I think that was the hardest for you to deal with out of everything that happened. It's the first thing you said to me, after not seeing each other for two years. That you lost the kid."
"Of course not," Steve says, going to the playpen to grab the kittens. "Come on children, chow time!"
He has a small New Age boutique in Greenwich Village, close to the Sanctum Sanctorum. It's full of mixed-herbs pouches, tea blends, trinkets and crystals meant for tourists—and to pay the lease Tony would bet—but every magic user in the area knows that Steve keeps the genuine stuff in the back. Natasha, a cunning werefox and dear ally, keeps a constant watch on the supernatural world; she'd warned Tony of the new player in town the moment Steve set up shop eight months ago. She'd also said his stuff was the best quality she'd seen in decades.
When Steve shuts the door behind them and stays with his back against it, the moment is charged. Tony immediately addresses the elephant—metaphorical and not a daemon this time—in the room.
"Not just for Iron Man?" Tony asks, as if to make sure he hasn't misread the situation. Steve shakes his head. He's wanted Iron Man back and been vocal about it, but this is so much more.
The first thing that Tony does when he gets up is seek out Steve. He finds him exercising in the cargo section. Normally he would take a second to admire the flawless push-ups, but he's not in that kind of mood. Anyhow, Steve hears him enter the room, and he jumps to his feet and stands almost at parade rest, looking at Tony with concern. He looks so genuinely guilty that Tony's anger abates a little. When Tony speaks, it's a lot softer than he thought he'd be.
"I recorded it for posterity, alongside your choreography. Should I contact Spike for a spot on Lip Sync Battle?"
Natasha, who has been having a hushed conversation with Barnes—what is that even about?—comes over and hugs Tony, kissing his cheek, then does the same for Steve.
But it's not only the kittens. Steve spends the weekend hanging out with Tony, and they have a fantastic time. Before Steve is entirely ready for it, three days have passed and work calls. It's with a heavy heart that he packs his bag and goes for a last visit to the workshop.
"He's good with tech, like you," Nebula says. Even she looks amused. "Smartass. Loud. You two keep butting heads."
Memory-Anthony is defiant, but he knows he's outgunned. Instead of surrendering or trying to take down as many opponents as he can, he turns to the core of the light-speed engine and opens fire on it.
"What just happened?" Steve mumbles, his four legs almost as jelly-like as the first time he turned into a frail-at-the-time centaur.
"They're stupid," Tony says with a head shake. "We'd only have to dye you gold, and you'd fit right in. Carol, you said they'd all shine, but not that everyone was also tall and beautiful. I can't believe I'm saying this, but so much physical beauty made everything borderline creepy."
Patently untrue, but Tony understands where the man is coming from. The glasses are wonderful, and though they can't see through metal, they could have helped keep track of who had what tiles. Not that Tony needed it.
They've planned this for weeks, and everyone knows their role. Tony's waiting for the Krees inside the facility, carved in the ground. They set up in the war room, which is the only way to reach the passage leading to a secure vault holding the now functioning core for the engine. The Krees have to be tracking its energy signature; they attacked both the plane flown by Carol and the lab in Asgard only when the core was powered on, and never the Tesseract directly. Steve is with him, of course. So is Wanda, who will cloak the core when the Kree scouts have confirmed its existence and position and start to engage, calling for reinforcement. Hopefully the vault and the cloaking will be enough to secure the core. If not, Tony installed a self destruct that will go off as soon as it's high enough in orbit. It would be a shame to have to build it again though.
"Perfectly fine," Tony says, kissing the side of Steve's head. "As I said, I'm a Dom. And my thing, what makes me hot, is giving my Sub what they need. If it's pain, I can make it hurt just right, I promise. It doesn't have to be a lot, but if you're into harder stuff, I can provide, too."
"Please," Tony says on a high wine. Seeing him so keyed up makes a shiver of pleasure go through Steve. He did this.
"Sounds great, but not right now," Carol says. She pushes a little plastic card towards Baylee. "Flag the table as yours, though."
Tony's certain that’s what happened. There are clear signs of fighting in the room, including the busted window they used to enter Reed's lab. There must have been some kind of attack, then the F4 went through a portal (willingly or not).
Yon-Rogg's expression and posture are full of defiance, even when kneeling, but there's a flash of fear in his eyes at Steve's threat.
Anthony doesn't even have time to turn around. There's a sharp blow to the back of his head and the world goes dark.
"I was stupid to go to the meeting alone, I won't make that mistake again." Tony smiles and for the first time, he lets Steve see his fangs and the power he typically covers up. "Believe me, Steve, if I catch them they'll be sorry."
"It's one thing to hear about parallel universes, even believing they exist, and another one entirely to see them with my own eyes," Steve starts.
"Neb, please. It's a sound investment, I'll pay him back," Tony says, beckoning the dealer to take Tal's card. "Thank you, Tal."
He's tired, his head is hurting, and he just went through several emotional whiplashes. There will be plenty of time to understand whatever the hell happened that cut him off from the other Avengers. He's also still angry with Steve and the others for not mentioning Morgan earlier, so he doesn’t want to socialize right now.
"Definitely," Tony says, taking a step forward so they're chest to chest. He wants to put his hands on Steve's hip, but the uniform's cumbersome belt with pouches is in the way, so Tony rests them on his sides instead.
Tony frowns. "Of course not. I wouldn't do that! And that's at a minimum twelve weeks from now. Are you going on a long mission?"
It's not that Tony wants to get sucked through the portal that opened in Reed's lab when, admittedly, Tony activated a machine he shouldn't have touched. At first the window had seemed to be a regular hologram, with a man that looked like Tony stumbling in the street of a cliché Wild West setting. It's only when Tony had touched it and realized he couldn't pull back that he knew it was definitely more than an image.
Tony squints, looking closer, and has to agree. It's not obvious, but there's something off with them, compared to everyone else. Could it be that they've found the universe where the F4 disappeared? That would be the best possible scenario.
Tony waves it off. "The least I could do. You keep doing good work. And thank the man with the bulldog; his visit is on me, with whatever he wants to buy for the pooch. I also owe him 500 bucks, and it’s best if I transfer it to him, since I don't have cash on me." He scribbles something on a card and gives it to Viv. "Ask him to email his name and address here. FRIDAY will take care of it."
"I know me, I know my tells," Steve says. "And even though he was the most obvious, because of the circumstances, that last Steve Rogers wasn't the only one in love with you. They all were. I'm certain that every version of me eventually falls for you."
"I'm sorry," Tony says. "Of course. I just feel like everyone keeps pushing the past in your face, as if the only thing interesting about you is your glory days in World War 2."
Tony has discovered the identity of the mysterious Captain America, at last, and now he plans to learn absolutely everything else about him. Hopefully in very intimate details.
"There was a vote at the UN to pass the Accords a few days ago, presented by T'Chaka, king of Wakanda. A bomb blew up as the session started, killing the king. All signs point to Barnes. Ross wanted to bring him down, so Steve went rogue to go protect him."
"Okay, and we're back at making things weird," Tony says, secretly delighted to hear Steve laugh. He salutes with his coffee and turns on his heels as he decides to explore the ship. Maybe Nebula will follow through and let him work on it too.
"I suppose Fury didn't want me to think too much about it, plus Thor was on his way back. It was the perfect opportunity for him to take me through the Bifrost to Asgard. Very cool ride, by the way. And Asgard is beautiful."
From what Steve can remember reading in his file, Tony left for college very young. "I guess you couldn't bring it to school," he says.
Steve explained that Hydra programmed Barnes, who didn't know what he was doing. It's horrific that he was used like that, of course it is. But the guy still
"They saw the vet?" Steve asks, scooping Callie up. It's crazy how much she's grown; she's approximately three times larger than the size they were when Steve and Tony first found them. She's still tiny, though, and thoroughly adorable.
Tony's always taken pride in his creations, and he feels like preening. The admiration is heady. In less than thirty seconds, Tony is as bare as the day he was born, save for the reactor.
"Same. I don't know what I'd do if you died, Tony. I'd miss you a lot." There’s a lot of sentiments on Steve's face that Tony can’t quite identify.
"I can do it," the young man says. He looks to be in his late teens, and mostly in a hurry to get on with his day. Maybe a little nervous.
"—I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability."
For now, he learns that he's on the planet Banturia, recuperating. It's huge and Tony wants to know everything that led him here. Steve relents quickly even when he reminds Tony he’s supposed to take it easy and says that they arrived by spaceship, as they're traveling with friends.
Steve envelops him in a hug. "I understand, and I'm so sorry about that. It was never my intention to choose, but I had to protect him. I love you so much, Tony. You don't have to try to know Bucky if you're not ready, not for me. But it means a lot that you'd be willing."
Probably for the best, considering how intoxicated they all are. They’re in the capital's center, a good hour's ride from their ship in the big spaceport near the coast. Also, now's not the time to fly a spaceship even if they wanted to leave the planet tonight.
The white kitten isn't happy about the pause in its feeding. As soon as Doctor Martin takes the nipple away to help Tony hold the other one properly, she starts screaming. It's the first time she's made any noise, and she's pissed.
The lovely Dina comes back with equipment that looks like it came right out of Star Trek for thankfully non-invasive tests. When Tony focuses on the shiny new tech, it helps him not spiral into panic again.
"Okay," Tony agrees, rubbing Steve's lower back. "You enjoy being marked, that's clear. With spunk, with bites, with bruises. Makes sense because you react beautifully to pain. How much of a masochist you are remains to be seen, though."
"That sounds really skeevy," Tony says, but the corner of his mouth raises up in a half smile and Steve wants to crow at his success.
"I love you," he confesses. He can't—no, that's not it. He doesn't want to keep that secret to himself for one more second.
"I'm sorry," he says, walking backward towards the door. He's smiling, but unfortunately it's awfully fake and Steve is at a loss at what to do. He just knows that he doesn't want Tony to leave like this.
In the box, the black kitten has started stirring, and soon starts meowing. It makes Tony smile. "She always has something to say."
"There are lots of reasons to refuse a pet to a four-year-old kid. But that it will distract him from his work isn't one of them," Steve argues. "Did he hire you at Stark Industries when you turned five?"
"Baby, but like permanently? No, too generic. Cee? For Carbon? Maybe. Raven? Nah, too predictable." He toys with a little paw for a moment. "Jellybean? Oh, I like that. Mmm." As if inspired by food, he then rapidly tries a series of other names in the same vein. "Godiva? Kona? Java?" A pause. "Wednesday would fit you."
"They forgot to unlock the other door." Tony knows that he's already slurring. Hell, he finds it difficult to keep his eyes open. He flops his hand towards the other side of the bed. "Plenty of space."
That's a good question, but yes, Tony feels fine. He'd love to grab several bottles of whatever they use as painkillers here on Banturia.
"With a ring and everything," Carol says, who's walking over to offer her congratulations too. "Very cute. So you're Captain America, huh?"
"It was, but it was also extremely dangerous. The power of the stones is so great, and it's not meant for humans. It burned both Thanos and the Hulk badly, and it should have killed you outright."
"Of course," Steve says. He gets up, stiff as a board. "If you have any questions, I'll try to answer. The best I can."
"Sorry," Tony apologizes again. He looks sheepish, and Steve is just starting to grasp how insecure Tony is with him. It's both endearing—in how it shows how much Tony cares—and a little sad. Only three weeks ago, before they started dating, Steve was convinced that Tony was made of pure confidence and every inch the playboy he claimed to be.
The evasion is an answer in and of itself — not about more werewolves or not, but about how he can't talk about it. Plus, if Steve wants to get dressed, it means that he can't turn back into a wolf, or at least doesn't want to.
Tony debates whether he should push on with the idea and maybe approach the camp to speak to these soldiers who have been on his mind for months. But he doesn't have a good excuse to be here apart from being nosy. It's one thing to invite yourself to a table in a bar and pay a round, but quite another to pop out of the woods at night. They're having fun, but these men are fighters and might not react well to an intruder. Speaking of, it surprises Tony that no one is keeping watch, not even a little. They haven't spotted him, and Tony didn't hide his approach at all. Maybe he should say something after all, as they're not exactly being careful. On the other hand, they're grown men and have been fighting as an elite combat unit for years. They know how to take care of themselves. After hesitating another minute, Tony decides to return to the village and go to bed.
"That you will," Tony says with a nod. He points at the flyer he got from Doctor Martin. "I set up the correct temperatures to keep as they grow up. But this is just temporary. I have some ideas to make the incubator better. The next one will have water circulation in the cushion, I think it will soothe them. Also, did you know that adult cats' hearts beat 140 times per minute when relaxed? I'll put in a little speaker. Hopefully it’ll feel like being close to their mama."
Out of the homophobic times of their youth, away from the war and torture, in a future brimming with possibilities… they deserve it.
"Sorry." It's Maria Hill. Steve debates sending her to voicemail, but eventually relents. "I've got to take this." Tony gestures for him to do so and Steve takes the call. "Rogers."
"Yes." He takes out a small ornate box from a bag on the floor and offers it. "My mother extracted some of the Tesseract's essence, as you had her do during your project on Asgard."
"It's complicated." Steve scrunches his nose. Before Tony can protest, he raises a hand. "I told you I'd explain, so I'll try to do so as simply as I can."
Tony's not even finished saying it when Steve hurtles over the edge, jolting in Tony's hold and coming all over his hand. It's as if it's been sucker-punched out of him, liberated by Tony's permission. He's had a fantastic week of sex with Tony and a lot of orgasms, but this one is particularly intense and satisfying.
"What you said before meeting the Sovereign about it being a dick-measuring contest? That's exactly what we're going to do here," Carol says.
They kiss some more, forceful and passionate, but Tony is too keyed-up to get to anything fancy. The feel of Steve's chest against his, being held close in his strong arms, it's making him frantic. They're rutting against each other, chasing the perfect friction, and it's just shy of enough. Steve's making delicious cut off groans, leaning into every touch, hands and mouth claiming as if he needs Tony more than he requires air.
"No party? How is that fair, when they're going to Asgard to do just that?" Clint crosses his arms over his chest, pouting.
"What the hell, Stevie?" Barnes adds, only a step behind. Tony notes how he's clutching his rifle, though he relaxes after assessing that Steve isn't in danger.
The effect is immediate. Everyone freezes and a hush falls over the table. Tony takes the red "ten" from Disorganized Guy, who is now looking at him with wide eyes, and puts it at the end of the row of his hidden tiles.
"I'm sure Tony will appreciate it," Rhodes adds with a half smile. He looks a lot more supportive, at least, and it's a confidence boost, just like the picture sharing had been.
He makes sure that Steve is holding the newborn, who's still screaming for food, correctly. It's scary how fragile the small cat feels, especially at the neck. Steve could hurt her so easily if he's not careful. As soon as the rubber nipple is near her mouth, the kitten sucks on it, and Steve gently presses on the plunger to feed her. He can feel the tiny gulps on the pad of his fingers and focuses on keeping the flow slow and steady.
"Did I say I have powers now? Because I do. It's fine, don't worry about it. We'll talk about it later."
"That's it," Steve encourages, mouthing at Tony's neck now. He sucks right over Tony's carotid, hard, and the idea of being marked by Steve makes Tony buck up.
"Get out!" Steve yells this time, throwing the shield that bounces off the three Kree, even disarming the third guy, before coming back to his arm.
Tony wants to say that the kiss was nice, because it's also the truth; but he feels it would be cruel to follow it by a somewhat-rejection. So he goes with the harder truth straight away.
The offer is tempting, but he feels it would send a terrible message, showing Midgardians weak and easily spooked.
A message, which clarifies why they are in full uniform. But it's obviously not just that. This reality's Steve is looking at his future wife with so much love that it makes Tony's heart squeeze again. Steve could be interested if Tony was a woman, which is even more heartbreaking than thinking he's never had a chance at all.
“Okay, okay,” Tony says, raising his hands in surrender. He wasn’t fishing for compliments; this is embarrassing. “Got it, they’re good birds.”
It's almost instantaneous. One second Tony is in plain clothes with a leather jacket, the next the nanites have reorganized and he's in his signature red and gold armor, without the helmet. Kol gapes at the transformation, just like everyone around them does.
"Then I must tell you that you're the most gorgeous werewolf I've ever met," Tony says, getting to his feet.
The panicked faces of his teammates, including the distress clear on Steve's, just after the snap spring to Tony's mind. The memory makes him recall the immense pain that coursed through his body. It felt like lava overtaking his right side, starting at the hand wearing the gauntlet. But there was also the vertigo of being all powerful, how Tony saw all the tempting possibilities to revolutionize the world laid before him. It's a challenge to keep a neutral expression with that onslaught of memories; the others would interpret his reaction wrongly if he let all that show in the current situation.
"I've got this," Tony tells Tal, nudging him out the way so he isn't hit by a right hook. The punch lands on Tony's shoulder, but the armor absorbs the shock of course, and he barely even budges. Kol, on the other hand, shouts in pain as he probably broke several fingers.
Steve is watching him closely while telling his story and if he wasn't so somber, Tony would think it's a prank. Six gems holding that much power...
Clearly Steve has come to the same conclusion, and after chewing on his bottom lip he speaks up. "We should get going?"
"What about?" Rhodey insists. "He never told me. Looked devastated about it, so I know it was serious, but it's been driving me nuts for two years. You two broke up?"
"Because." Steve takes a big breath, and finally goes on. "Because I'm meant to find you. May it be in the future or as a cowboy in the past, somehow it has to happen."
Tony doesn't have time to follow that conversation. Instead, he points at the shield still on the ground as he takes flight and hovers for a second.
"Ah, no, I'm sorry honey, I'll tell you. It's just embarrassing. I'm blaming the whole mix up on my post-nap daze, okay?"
“It’s hard to argue against something that is the foundation of my existence. But I also believe there’s no magic, just science that isn’t explained yet.”
The truth is that love has burned Tony one too many times. His new equilibrium came at a price, and he's not sure he wants to shatter this newfound comfort zone.
"Water?" he asks hopefully. He can't help but stare at Steve with his head thrown back as he drinks in long gulps.
"Twelve weeks old now," Steve says, having walked around the pool to join the others. Tony looks up and grins at him, which makes Steve's heart stutter. "Hi, Tony."
"What a relief, and of course not, I'll take good care of it," Steve says. Tony has taken his arm out of his undersuit and shrugged the top part off, leaving him bare to the hips. Steve reaches out to caress his shoulders, pecs, pausing to gently trace the scars of where the arc reactor used to be. He has always treated them as if he thought them beautiful instead of ugly. Steve seems entranced, and it's incredibly flattering. "You're so hot."
"I always wondered what your daemons would look like." Thor is grinning, sitting on the ground with a lapful of a massive lioness with wings. She's purring and rubbing on him, so clearly not a foe, there's that.
"Where were you? Thor said there was an explosion. Everyone thought you were dead! What's this uniform?" He then turns to Carol with narrowed eyes. "And who's that? JARVIS said you flew to the helipad—"
The way Tony perks up, including the smile that takes over his face, is beautiful. He wastes no time closing the distance between them, hugging Steve, who squeezes him back. He loves how perfectly Tony fits against him, and his heart is full to bursting.
"Anthony! This is an entrance worthy of my dear mother," Thor says. "You are only missing the chariot!"
Steve laughs outright this time; Tony would marvel about it, but he's caught up in a yawn instead. Between them, Cora and Lilly have stopped playing and are snuggling together. Steve's little stoat is partly under Cora's wing, and their heads are curled towards each other.
"Please," Tony interrupts. "I'm amazed that you stayed here a whole week. We'll be fine, I've got the hang of it."
That makes Steve bristle as he observes Zemo through the reinforced window. "You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?"
"See that you are," Steve says, amused. He's a lot more relaxed than he was earlier, for which Tony congratulates himself. "We should watch-"
"Thanks." Steve says, almost guiltily. Is he invading Tony's privacy? Surely FRIDAY would object if he was. Or tell Tony, which makes Steve squirm in embarrassment. But she stays quiet as Tony continues his work.
/? He killed my parents, Steve. I know, I know," he adds preemptively. "Not really him, Hydra. But still."
"Are you saying there's no coffee in space?" Tony puts a hand on his chest as if shocked and appalled (he is a little).
"Yeah. I didn't take it well, especially the part where he didn't tell me immediately. I note you're not surprised to know Bucky Barnes is alive. Did Steve find him?"
"Plus, I know you've been itching for a fight, just to have an excuse to punch the pretty boy in the face," Tony teases.
The mix of relief and exhilaration immediately goes to Steve's head. He hauls Tony close and delights when strong arms circle his shoulders in return. Yet, even with Steve's tongue in Tony's mouth and his hands clutching his shirt, the need to get closer is still there, urgent. He's clumsy both from desire and alcohol as they end up with Tony's back against the kitchen's wall, when Steve hadn't even realized they were moving at all.
"No worries, friends," Thor adds. "I only advise that you keep a hand on Mjolnir at all times, so I do not lose you along the way."
"Next time," Steve says with confidence. "I've hoped for this for a long time too, you know. I'm yours as long as you want me."
Most of the surrounding crowd ran for cover when the firing and explosions started, and some are going for the exits now. But the Krees are after the Avengers and Carol specifically, and there's no need to have anyone else caught in the crossfire.
Clearly, it makes Steve and company weary. Knowing it's not ideal as a reveal situation, but having nothing else to work with, Tony opens up Iron Man and steps out.
"Thor’s had a rough few years. He lost Asgard, his sister, both his parents, his friends, and Loki, sort of."
The protectiveness is very cute. He must have been a formidable soldier, but what is needed right now isn't pure brawn and healing spells, it's experience in combat magic.
"Miss Romanov is at the United Nations offices, she'll be back in a few hours. The others are currently in Europe." There's a slight change of tone in the last sentence, but Tony can't be bothered because a suit just came through the patio door to land a few feet away, and he can't stop smiling.
"That was Loki, all right." Carol is squinting at him now. "And what looked a lot like Captain America, however the hell that happened. But you..."
They join in, and at "go!" Peter and him start pushing their tube and partner while running down the slope. Steve keeps an eye on Peter and they jump in approximately at the same time, mid way down. He lands half on Tony's back, trying not to squish him too much, and it's a total delight to feel him whoop in joy as they careen down the hill. Tony and he win this round, which generates more cheers.
The list of compliments is flattering, but 'handsome' sticks out. Especially since that when Steve crawls out of the tent, now in Hydra pants and a tight black undershirt, his ears and the apple of his cheeks are flushed a pretty pink.
The high priestess throws him an annoyed look. She asks the follow-up questions to Tony again, deciding that he's the only interlocutor worthy of her attention.
Tony went to the parley in good faith, but also alone, a mistake born of overconfidence and pride. He was forcefully turned into his bat form as soon as he crossed the threshold of the rendezvous point. An excellent move that ensured that Tony couldn't use his super strength or his own magic against Victor in retaliation. A younger or inexperienced vampire might have been too disoriented by the change to react. Fortunately, Tony had immediately realized how screwed he was and escaped before the door closed and trapped him in.
"Speaking of your girls," Steve says, “I'll have to tap out after the next feeding, but I'll come back at five."
"What's your bad news," Steve asks. Tony must make a face because he clarifies. "Nat said it was a good news bad news situation."
"I hear you," Barnes says. "But I still did it, and I can never make it right. Also, I'm sorry about what it did to you two," he adds, glancing to Tony's left at Steve.
To his and Steve's bewilderment, Hildr is the one that grabs Mjolnir and leads the way. When they exit Himinbjorg, it's to step on a massive translucent rainbow-colored bridge that overlays an ocean that drops in space. Not only is Asgard full of magic, it's flat, too. Tony hates everything.
"You started the sleeping thing," she grumbled, yawned again, and tried to hide her face between Tony's shoulder and the pillow.
"I don't mind, no," Steve says. In fact, he likes that Tony is looking into their ops. Maybe he misses being part of the team and it could entice him back. "And yeah, it was tricky," he admits.
"Really? It's the finest goddamn jet floor I ever laid on," Steve says, catching Tony’s lips for a slow and thorough kiss. "But yeah, I know," he adds when they separate. "All I want is to keep you in my arms. It's hard to let you go."
"We met, once, in 1988. You were with James Rhodes, a common friend. I had the distinct impression you were an insufferable brat, but he liked you, and I trusted him."
"You've been fantastic." Tony grips his fingers and climbs on the bed, sliding his free hands up Steve's legs and torso. Over his clothes, but there indeed will be other times where he'll be able to unravel Steve. "You don't need to do this, Steve. Are you sure?"
Behind them, the guy who moved the bin starts throwing back in the bags Steve flung out, which makes him feel bad. He made the mess, he should pick it up.
"The what?" Tony exclaims. Is that why Wilson was Cap, and Steve wasn't in the Avengers' team when they were fighting flying beans and robots?
The warning makes Steve pause. He'd been against this part of the plan for a long time, hoping that Tony would stay by his side. Eventually though, Steve had listened to reason, but that doesn't mean he likes it.
Tony's eyes glint in the light of the oil lamp and his smile is wicked. "That's a broad question, handsome. I've hoped for this for a long time."
