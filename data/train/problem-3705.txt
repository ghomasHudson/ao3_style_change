, like-" he groans in frustration. "I'm gay for you, just you. Alright?"
Dean whimpers, struggling to get away and making several little grunts as he tries to free himself.
"Not if you're quiet." This time John doesn't flip him over onto his stomach when he's naked, he bends the younger man in half and slides into him roughly.
Dean mocks them, "Awwwwww-" the two men pull apart quickly. "You two goin' gay for each other now?"
Sam swallows already regretting this, "You're kinda morbid, you know."
"Yea." Dean says, like he might get spanked if he says anything else.
"Hmm-" Sam says, he was wiser than Dean had been and knew something weird was going on, it just didn't add up. Dean's phone begins to ring right then and he grabs it, "It's
Dean spoke, " I'm gonna need you to take these to my car for me, I can't wrinkle my suit. " placing two fingers on his green tie and tugged it once.
It's unclear how long he'd been calling out for his father but eventually it startles Castiel awake who then rushes over to the bedroom. "Dean-" he flips the light on to see the boy in bed with wide eyes, "What's going on?" but the boy doesn't respond, only shows him his hand from afar. "What's on-" it hits him, "Oh-" so he sits down on the edge of the bed with a sigh.
"Good." Bobby says, "Dean- he's a handsome boy but he's got soft features. Men notice that." he takes the bread out of one of the shopping bags and proceeds to make lunch, "All I'm saying is, it's good for him to be alert instead of naive."
"Wow." Was all Castiel could say when Dean led him through his large home, "Wowww." He repeated as they entered the bedroom.
Dean hugs himself, "I feel like shit, can I sleep here with you?"
Castiel swallows the food in his mouth and wishes he hadn't so he didn't have to respond to the question. "I-I love him too, he's a great kid." he deflects.
"Oh- shut up." Dean moans into the phone, "Shut up-Shut up- Shut up!" he screams before hanging up. Castiel calls again, "The fuck do you want?!"
"You're right-" Dean shakes his head, "Just freaking myself out."
Dean smiles, "Uh- yeaa." he was also a sucker for bonfires- fire in general was super cool in his book.
Dean huffs, hiding half of his face in his mug.
"I don't have parents!" he yells and it hurts Castiel's ears. "If I want ice cream you should get it for me, it's only a friggin' dollar!"
Dean nods. "Okay."
Dean reaches over for the cat and hugs it, giving it a kiss on the forehead. "Well, yea-" there's a blush on his face and some concern because his stepfather suddenly looks emotional. "Cas, you okay?"
"I see how much you love me-" he says softly, analyzing the poorly made meal. "You still love me don't you?" their eyes meet and the teen nods. "Then why didn't you give me any chips-" a smile forms on his lips.
The older man presses soft kisses up his neck and eventually whispers, "When you get out of here-" cups the teens face in his hands roughly. "Think you'll come visit me?"
"No baby, of course not-" Castiel cups the teens face in his hands, "I don't want that kind of relationship but I thought you might-"
"Not around, no. But I can still get some." his voice is smug.
needs to be careful. "Go to bed." he smiles, last thing he needs is to upset him and have him run off crying down the hallway.
"Where'd you go?" he scoots over to make room on the bench.
She blinks, "Like-"
nature.Â "Stop staring at me-" he says eventually.
Castiel opens one eye, "What?" he says groggily.
"I'm getting so old-"
"I think so, there's a few hospitals here I could work at-" his tone of voice shows that he's really considering uprooting their lives to move here for good, "I've got enough money to buy a house here-if Bobby didn't want us staying here." Castiel didn't want to go back- the thought of going back made him feel sick to his stomach. Here, he felt that same freedom Dean was feeling. He likes that things are calm out here.
Castiel simply watches him move around the room to put his new jacket away in the closet, "It looked nice on you-" and of course he's not expecting a gift in return. It's not like they talked about exchanging gifts or anything, yet he does receive one anyway. "John-" a smile spreads across his lips boyishly when he's handed a small gift. "You didn't have to-"
"Dean." Castiel stirs, eyes blinking awake. "What are you doing now."
"You're really testing my patience-"
of the night did. Dean kept an eye on it through the kitchen window- this time when he saw it. It looked real. It wasn't a shadow anymore. "The fuck-" Dean blinks his eyes, looking over Castiel's head- trying to make out what he's seeing through the window. He stands- eyes trying to focus on the shadow.
They both head inside and Castiel pulls out a bowl of candy, handing it to him. "Happy Halloween-"
He quickly wipes his eyes with dirty fingers, "Damn it-" and stands, making his way around the house to greet them both.
"We were going to get married-" her eyes widen in surprise because she hadn't known about this. "But he left me standing there like an idiot-" his eyes sting with tears at recent memory.
Suddenly fear sets in, this feels weird and It feels wrong. He thinks the guy is attractive sure, but he's scaring him right now. "Please let go." he says so softly he doesn't recognize his own voice. Benny stands up and he feels glued to his seat, "Please let go!" he yells, unaware of the tears that had started falling down his cheeks.
Bobby is red all over, "Ya mind?" he looks at Castiel, who shakes his head. "I'll be back soon-" he dips out quickly enough. As the bearded man leaves, he goes to check the fridge to see if they have enough food- they do, so he goes to sit on the couch next to the teenager.
Ash looks over at him for a second, "Oh-" then laughs. "Well, whatever I guess. Think you'll hook up with him when you're legal then?-" and his tone is casual, like he's making simple conversation about something totally hypothetical.
Castiel rolls down the window and shouts, "Hey!"
Dean quickly climbs up on the bed, getting on his hands and knees. He feels a big strong hand push down on his lower back, making his ass go up in the air. "Ugh-" big soft hands begin rubbing and squeezing his plump cheeks then comes a little smack on his ass. It's like a test. He does like it. There's another small smack on his reddening skin. Thoughts of John- his dad start swimming in his mind. He shakes his head roughly, he's desperate to stay in the moment.
Dean stars the car, "Listen to her purr." he smiles lovingly at Castiel, who gets into the passenger side.
Castiel's head pops in, "Can I talk to you?"
"Kinda want to fool around-" he shrugs, "-want you to treat me bad-like-" he can't explain what he wants.
The whole thing was just some stupid mistake, it's what he tells himself while looking in front of the mirror and sees the loose fitting clothing on his body. At least now he's got some color to his face and his hands aren't so cold, plus he's not as tired as he used to be. Things might be finally looking up for him and Castiel now that he's an adult.
"Cas-" he turns over in bed and squints in the darkness to see Dean, "Cas-I don't feel good."
The older man chuckled, "I'll be fine, I got Sammy." sucking in a shaky unsure breath now.
Dean suppresses a cough, eventually saying "I-I think wanna have sex-" after a few minutes of passing the cigarette in silence.
smells nice or that he's even smelled him at all because he
When the car is put into park the second they arrive at the house, Dean gives him pause. The boy tugs on the sleeve of the mans sweater to keep him from exiting the car and there's a certain look on his face. Something that looks a lot like
Castiel goes red, looking away. "Shut up."
Was he really just a
"Someday I will-" Dean states. "-I still want to marry you."
Castiel wraps his arms around the teens neck, "Better make you something to eat-" at that, his face falls a little bit so he reassures him. "I'm so proud of you, when the nurses told me you were eating everything I almost didn't believe it."
"Why would we watch them do that-" Dean's face is red and his boner is still in his shorts.
Dean starts panting, "Cas..." hes trying to object to having the man taste him, but he's already pushing his jeans and boxers down to his knees, Castiel helping pull them off the rest of the way.
"Spit it out-" John orders and his son shakes his head, "You want me reachin' inside your mouth for it?"
though. He really wishes he could...but
After a few moments of silence Bobby speaks up, "If ya wanna see him or talk, I ain't gonna be against that-" his nephew looks over at him. "But don't want no-"
He turns off the light and gets in bed, moving in close to snuggle with the teenager when suddenly he begins to kick him under the covers. "GET THE HELL OFF ME!" he screams.
Dean slides underneath the covers, closing his eyes with a long deep sigh. It doesn't take long before his brother is hooking a leg over him and using his chest as a pillow. It was purely a comfort thing, nothing weird or inappropriate was going on between them. They were just close since they were all the other has in this world, although Sam was more popular in school because he was pretty smart. Dean, not so much. Not only was he not smart, but he was the black sheep of his grade level because everyone knew he was bad news.
Castiel smiled, " Thank's...Dean. "
When they get there they sit in the waiting room until being called, Dean goes in alone as per his request. "Dean-" the therapist says warmly. "-finally."
"I've been feeling like-" Castiel sighs heavily, "Like I just want to sleep forever alright." The doctor nods again, they speak for another ten minutes before he's given a prescription. He leaves the doctors office with a prescription and a diagnosis of
stare at the stars for a while. He hoped he would see that man again. The boy thought he was lucky to have a nice view of a pretty big orchard right outside of his window.
"What did he tell you?" Castiel gets defensive and she doesn't answer. "For two hundred an hour, I think I have a right to know what he talks about in here-"
Dean starts giggling in spurts as they move around in the confined space and they were both just over the fucking moon to have each other.
Meg speaks up, "Dean, you are suffering from anxiety at least but these deficiencies and anemia are making you feel worse. Castiel and I want to start you on some prescription vitamins, high dose stuff. We also want you to see someone about your anxiety."
Dean blinks, eyes unfocused. He's panting and the tears come down.
It's early August. Two weeks after Dean's father died.
Castiel couldn't feel bad. He was about to put his phone on the nightstand so he could get some sleep until it started buzzing again.
himself.
Eventually saying, "Alright, Bobby-" and sits up. "I think we get the point-" but the bearded man makes no effort to turn off the movie and was quite into it. "Fine, Goodnight you two-" and the front door slams shut behind him.
When the operator answers he's still shaking, "I-I need help." she asks what his emergency is. "My boyfriend-" he's panting. "-he's trying to hurt us-" she asks who else is the home. "-his son, Dean. He's only eleven-" and that's all she needs to know before sending help.
That realization makes him sad, he's never had a boyfriend before.
"This is my room." Castiel opened the door, leading them both inside. Dean scanned the room. The bed was neatly made, he couldn't tell if he made it or his mom did. His eyes scanned the walls now,  snorted when he saw a poster of a kitten playing in a garden of flowers. He was stepping closer to the bed subconsciously.
Castiel hauls him up to his feet and shoves him against the wall, making the teen moan. "Why do you like it when I'm rough with you?" it's a genuine question.
"How would you feel if I hit you?" Castiel asks, his head is turned, now looking at Dean.
"Cause' it is-" he sighs, "Life's hard enough as a straight man, but-"
Castiel tosses his empty coffee cup into the trash and sits down again to watch Dean from afar. They must have been at the park for almost two hours before Dean runs up to him with something hiding behind his back. "What have you got back there?" his tone is playful, "Come on, show me-" then tickles the boy to get him to give in.
"John Winchester. Where is he?"
more than ya love
Castiel huffs, "There's nothing I don't know about you-"
"What brought you all the way out here?" he asks.
He knows Castiel works here and for some reason he prays that he doesn't see him like this. The last thing he needs is to stress him out even more. When he's asked questions, he answers- but never mentions his step father, only his uncle. He told the nurse his uncle would be picking him up when released- she smiles at him like he wouldn't be going anywhere for a while. Another tear rolls down his cheek. No one is telling him anything and that's freaking him out, his heart actually starts racing even faster and the EKG catches it this time so they give him something through his IV line to help him relax. Dean wills himself to calm down because a different nurse told him that they'd have to sedate him and restart his heart if it didn't return to normal rhythm.
After getting up out of bed and moving around the house, he comes to realize that John never came home last night. Guess the rumors around town were true and the mechanic had found himself a chick to fool around with.
When they arrive at O'Riley's Bobby orders him inside with a list of the things he needed- he stayed in the truck since his knee had been acting up again since waking up. Dean walks in, the door buzzes as it always had when someone entered.
Dean smiles softly before opening the door to his room and locking it behind him. His cold fingertips press against his lips and pictures how good it actually felt to kiss Robin, the taste of her lip balm lingered on him. An odd ache swells in his chest and it only confirms just how confused he really is on the inside. Dean loves Castiel, but there's a whole world out there that he hasn't seen yet. Does he even
One of his neighbors walks by with her dog, she sees him smoking and he can see her shaking her head ever so slightly.
Castiel sits up, hugging himself. "I don't know about that-"
Castiel sits up, "Because I'm leaving."
Johns hands grope his front over his pajamas and he feels something sticking up, "If ya don't like it, what's this-" he jiggles the little thing roughly over the fabric.
Dean's standing there with his boxers down just enough to expose himself - "Tryna put this shit on-" he hands Castiel the tube of the medicated cream. "The doctor gave me that for my rash."
John smiles drunkenly, "Feeling frisky huh-" and climbs over him, grinding into the younger mans slender but fit body. "You're so hard-" he groans before going for his own belt.
After tossing the many candy wrappers he found on the floor into the garbage, he flicks the light off on his way out of the boys bedroom for what he hopes is the final time tonight. He doesn't think he'll ever get used to this, waking up in the middle of the night because of a sick child- either way, he has to get used to it because the kids father doesn't seem to care.
John is roaming around the room shirtless while getting himself ready for work and Castiel does the same, he's looking through his packed suitcase for a fresh pair of scrubs. Before the man exits the bedroom after getting dressed, he says only one sentence.
"I'm not-"
While at work, Castiel almost forgets everything that happened at the club with
"We'll sage the house." Castiel clears his throat, "Just in case, not that I believe In witchcraft."
"And what-" he shivers. "You're gonna fall for me too?"
A twinge of jealousy bubbles up in his chest and hes seeing
His stomach growls and he keeps walking, wishing he had a big dinner the night before but he didn't because he hadn't planned on running away. The last thing he had to eat were those fries while he was talking to Benny. Shit, he forgot to tell his uncle and step dad about the photos, about Gordon getting arrested once again.
"What if-" Dean starts to bite on his nails.
He's tired of being on the toilet waiting for mother nature to come knocking but instead it's a nurse who does. Eating three times a day has his body entirely confused. The nurses praise him for eating but they won't tell him how much he weighs when he asks.
"Sorry, man. Having trouble picking out somethin'-"
. It had been one of the first few shops by the malls entrance, must have been a new store since he hadn't noticed it before. It was a lot like Hot Topic, but more new age. Dean had been extremely anxious to spend some of his diner money, after all he had three weeks of paychecks burning a hole in his pocket.
"I don't like whiskey." he says, hand over his mouth- "Ugh- fucking Bobby."
"It's fine Bobby, I'm safe now." he smiles at his uncle, "But yea- I wish I had told you what dad was really like. I would've loved to grow up here-" they share a sad but knowing smile and finish their breakfast in comfortable silence. When they're done Bobby asks him if he'd join him for a run into town to grab a few parts for a car he's working on and Dean agrees- he misses bonding with his dear uncle.
"Why doesn't it make you sick?" He asks, referring to the drugs.
Dean's voice cracks, legs trembling and Castiel knows he's close but he doesn't speed up. "
Dean quickly stomps it out and lies, "No."
Dean takes a chicken nugget and bites into it somberly- more so than usual. Castiel tries his best not to pry or push him for information, that is until he's done with his burger and notices that the boy has barely even touched his happy meal-only having had two chicken nuggets and a few fries.
"No!" Dean cries, "It's not the same-" and wipes his face on the sleeve of his shirt. "My happy meal didn't make me happy-"
Dean was looking down at an open car magazine and answers mindlessly. "Yea, guess so-" his eyes never leave the page.
Late that same night Dean is crying out
He's got a massive headache and the first thing he does is some coke and then he laced up his boots, "Later." He mumbles to his friend who had fallen back asleep.
Brady's eyes flicker down to the teens lips, then down his body as if checking him out. The gaze is seductive, like he wants him. "You look good, man-"
Clearly tonight all caution had been thrown to the wind and here they were, having a movie night on his bed. It doesn't matter, if he came home to find them there he would just cover for them both. If that didn't work, he would take all the blame.
the closer to climax he becomes. "Come for me baby-" he says tightly before groaning in his own pleasure.
They giggle and chat until the door to the fast food restaurant opens and Sam sees him first, "Dude, he's here."
The man grips the teen's wrist to catch his attention suddenly, "Dean-" looks up through dark wet lashes. "I'm fine, I just need help right
It's been a few years and now Dean was about to turn Seventeen, Castiel was more than happy for him- since John left them both Dean has been doing amazing at school. His friend Sam was over so much you'd think they were actually brothers. Sam being around did the teenager a lot of good, that girl Charlie came around sometimes as well but Dean kept his distance and it was only because of the warnings Castiel gave him. He did not want to get her pregnant by accident and risk ruining everything.
Dean grabbed one bar of chocolate and would have grabbed more, but he was feeling a strange sad feeling. He really didn't like that Castiel was admiring baby stuff, because he wanted to be the baby, even if he wasn't exactly Castiel's. The weird jealousy sits with him on the car ride home and his young mind couldn't comprehend such a feeling.
"Tell me what you want baby."
Dean shrugs, "Yea- I guess I do." and his step father looks visibly pained by the admission, "Not like that-"
While another one of them is single and collecting child support checks from three different men. If he's not careful with this one, Castiel could become her fourth baby daddy and that's only going to happen over his dead body.
Castiel groans, "Great, now two people know about us." he stands, pacing around the bedroom in worry. "I don't know what were going to do-" this is unlike him, he's so used to Castiel taking care of things and fixing all kinds of problems. It makes him uneasy.
Dean stops, opening his eyes - "Holy crap." he exhales. "Sammy."
Castiel nods his head slightly, "You want to explore being with someone your age, I understand."
"Nothing baby." he kisses the boys temple. "I'm so tired-" he yawns, resting his head on top of his. "I could sleep for a about a week."
"Oops, sorry about that hun-" she chuckles, removing her hand. "Dean, how do you know Castiel?"
Blue eyes occasionally look up at him, relishing the view before him- the prettiest boy in the whole prison, all his to play with. Dean's got his bottom lip sucked into his mouth and he's making the sweetest whimpers he's ever heard. The aroma of teen flesh is heavenly flooding the room as he starts to sweat- he can't help himself and begins to rub right underneath the boys appropriate sized balls.
"Listen, Cas. Know we haven't talked the last few days but- I'm beat." he lies, "Mind sendin' me those pics and we'll talk tomorrow?" Castiel agrees and they hang up, not long his phone keeps pinging with pictures of the improving home.
Dean packed up his bag that very same night and went back to staying under his uncles roof, leaving behind a teary eyed Castiel standing by the front door. He looked back and gave him the finger, then a flirty grin to let him know it was all okay. This boy was so up and down, you never really know what's going to happen but having it any other way would bore him to death.
"I don't either-" he sighs, "Girls want you to buy them stuff, spoil em and right now I just don't have the cash for it."
lady was his friend before going to open the door for her with Dean hiding behind him.
He regrets not getting the dancers number now because he's unable to ask him what happened or check in on him but there's nothing that can be done about that currently.
Dean looks at his uncle, his eyes are wild and filled with tears. "Bobby, for fucks sake. I saw him-wait, you don't believe me?" then he looks at his step father, "You believe me, don't you?"
Castiel encourages him sweetly, just how he likes it. "Be a good boy and lay back for me-" his voice is raspy and deep, "Open your legs and let me see-" the teen obeys yet again and lays back, spreading his thighs apart and his hands are unconsciously stroking the back of his thighs. "Good boy-"
"It's not enough." he says bluntly.
"He's still here. He's working right now-" he gulps, "He'll be home any minute."
"Anyone want icecream?" he says, already fishing out the brand new tub of the vanilla treat.
"I don't want you going back there- it's not good for you." Castiel crosses his arms at his chest, "Please. You know I need to go back and fix up the house before they move in and you didn't exactly leave it in the best condition. Your room is-" Dean's face goes red, "You punched holes in the wall and your carved- certain words that I don't want anyone to see. This couple has a child and they plan on turning your room into a nursery."
"Goodnight, Dean. Don't forget I'll be stopping by." He cannot believe he's going to do this. Dean hangs up and he's already wishing he hadn't agreed to this.
The very exaggerated groans of pain and the mixture of his puppy dog sky blue eyes seem to work because soon they are both slipping into their jackets and stepping into their shoes to head out.
Benny closed the gap between them and hugged him tight, âShhh.â he rubbed Deanâs back,âItâs okay kiddo.â
Dean nods, "Oh-"
Castiel looks at him, "If you're going to develop some weird car fetish I should probably take her away from you." He says it as a joke but he can't tell because the teen's got hearts in his green eyes.
"How do you know Jack?" Castiel asks and his tone is cautious.
"Mmmmughhh-" Dean moans, pre-cum and saliva dripping down his chin.
â Open. â Dean rasped right before his intense orgasm hit him. Harder than heâd like to admit. It had been a long while since he had come. Alone or during sex.
Dean looks over at his stepfather who was fighting hard not to cry in front of him. "Okay, Cas. It's okay-" he rolls onto his side now too, "You didn't kill him, Okay?" he agrees. "It's not your fault my dad did drugs. You didn't know what he was gonna do with the money-" his hand rests softly on the mans stubble covered cheek.
"Talk to me baby-" his voice is so caring, so soft. "Tell me what's bothering you-"
Castiel is going to kill him for not coming home-that's the first thought he has when he opens his eyes, his next thought is- "We didn't have sex did we?" He asks him.
"Think about what you'd like us to talk about, maybe write any ideas down on paper and bring it with you so you don't forget." she smiles, "I'll see you in two weeks, please show up."
"I'm getting to it, sweetheart-" the deep southern drawl has the doctor moaning a little too early. "This what you want?" lube is being drizzled generously onto his cock before he rubs the head against the virgin looking hole.
Castiel returns and enters his room with a plate for him after a few minutes, Dean sees a grilled cheese sandwich and some chips. "Thanks." he takes the plate, it's almost as if he suspects something because Castiel doesn't leave and just stands there, studying him. "What?" he says after he took a bite of the grilled cheese.
He opens the front door, "Dinner time!" he calls out to him. "Hey!"
"Cas-" he clears his throat.
Castiel nods, wiping his eyes. Dean walks in right then and steals a slice of pizza before going back to his room.
Dean nods and finally digs into his meal. They eat in silence for a while, the occasional comment about something that happened throughout the day is made. Eventually Bobby says, "If ya daddy was here, he would'a smacked the shit outta you for messin' around with Cas-"
"Dean," Castiel groans, "Come with me-" They both come at the same time, Dean accidentally bites down on Castiel's thumb. His orgasm punching through him, he begins to tremble and squirm under the man. He opens his eyes, resumes the eye contact he was told not to break. His mouth relaxes and he slowly releases Castiel's thumb. "God." Castiel sighs loudly, "Fuck."
"Jacks." Dean looks down at his slippers, "You gonna punish me?"
"Dean, I'm okay." Castiel moves over a little bit to make room for him to get in- "I need you."
The boys perfect back began to arch, his round ass rising and rising. Begging for something more.
"I'll figure out something we can do, maybe there's a haunted house in town we can all go to-" that makes the teenager smile. "Then again we can always have a-"
They follow their usual routine and stop by the diner, Dean seems more free after the final words he directed at his father. They both know John couldn't hear them, but it was purely symbolic. Pastor Jim had said they needed it and by the looks of it he had been right.
Lisa sees him, upside down between her legs before standing up and stretching her slender limbs. "Hi Dean-" and her tone was as
Unless his weekly injection counts as quality time spent together which they both decided that it wasn't. She mentioned that Castiel would be welcomed to any session, if Dean chose to allow it. He was very open with her, but anything having to do with his
Castiel closes his eyes momentarily in arousal, "I know baby, it's okay-" now he watches the teens fingers rub circles around his hole, like how a girl might pleasure herself. "You're hard-" the comment is made casually. "Good boy-" he swallows, "Stroke that pretty cock for me-"
Even if it meant sneaking around again, maybe even if it landed the guy in prison, he wanted him and he wanted him now. Dean wanted the man all the time, it's a fucking problem and he knows it.
Castiel sighs, "Of course." and walks up to the hospital bed where the boy had been sitting with his legs wide open. He stands between his open legs, briefly running his fingers through the light brown hair for the first time in hopes of comforting him. "Sorry-" he quickly stops and takes a seat on one of the chairs in the room.
Sam frowns, he actually did want some more food and was surprised that Dean didn't. Dean loves to eat.
"Mmmm-" The teen moans as he licks and sucks his way up until finally latching onto the man's sweet tasting neck. That's when Castiel loses his mind.
A bigger part of him just wants to continue being a kid and have his stepfather continue babying him.
"What's goin' on- there a fire?" Dean rubs his sleepy tired eyes. "Cas, I'm tired." he whines, "If the house isn't on fire, I'm going back to sleep-"
He grabs a pair of sweat pants to change into in the bathroom because taking his pants off in front of the boy is something he won't do.
"Night Dad." Dean says softly, "It's cold-" he complains. "-can't you fix the heat-"
John sits down again, "Can't you gimme a chance?" he begs his friend with hopeful eyes before reaching over the table to hold Castiel's hand. "I'll be good to you."
always earned him a spanking.
The man laughs and it takes a moment to regain his composure. "No-" a few seconds go by. "Guess everybody is a lil' gay, ain't they-"
"Alright then-" he says, in a tone that sounds sad but he's actually happy right now with the sound of many cash registers ringing loudly in his ears.
They resume their vampire movie marathon like nothing had ever happened and Dean seemed to forget about the last ten minutes a little too quickly which bruised his ego severely.
The smell of Dean's musk was enough for the boy to turn on his side, reach over to place his hand on the man's chest and feel his way down. He groaned.
Dean nods, his pretty green eyes looking up at him. "Give me that fucking milk daddy-" Castiel loses it, he comes all over Dean's open mouth- his face- and on his new dress. Dean gags a little bit before he sticks out his tongue out all the way to show him all the come he was about to swallow- he gulps it down.
"Hurry up-" John says impatiently, a large box in his hands. Castiel takes a final look at his empty apartment before following his lover down the few flights of stairs to the car. They had packed both their vehicles to capacity and the rest was on a u-haul that John had rented. He had to spend some cash eventually, or else Castiel would think he was just a deadbeat, which he was but he had to make some kind of effort.
The mans thumb pressed against his dry hole, teasing it, knowing it wouldnt pop in without lube.
"Nah-" Dean says, "But you can chill in here for a while-"Â Castiel nods and closes the door behind him, unsure of what to do now. "Sit over here you fuckin' nerd-" Castiel smiles before sitting down next to him on the bed.
the ceremony in between their busy week.
Castiel laughs then, "You know, there was a cult leader who brainwashed his entire following into committing suicide by drinking kool aid, he told them they were going to ascend to somewhere, I don't know-" Dean looks nervous. "-but that was a long time ago and the guy was insane. If it'll make you feel better, don't eat or drink anything they give you." Dean nods. He leans over to whisper, "I love you baby."
When it's time for pie though, Dean lights up like a Christmas tree. A small slices of cherry and apple pie are placed in front of him at the table along with a helping of vanilla ice cream. For the first time ever, the boy looks up and yells "Thank you, Jesus!" and it's spoken in such a funny tone that both men laugh for the first time that night. Now that
Dean trembled, "Hey-hey Cas. Go...I love you, Don't forget." he gave him one final kiss, putting his all into it because it was the last, and pushed him gently in the direction of the car.
Dean swallows, leaning away from the woman because she's just too damn fucking close. "He's my stepdad-" there she goes again, her land lands on his shoulder and begins to rub. Honestly, it didn't feel all that unpleasant but this woman is way beyond the age of being a cougar, much less a milf. "Y-your hand is on m-my-"
"What happened to you-" Dean says quietly and walks up to the hospital bed, holding onto the railing. "I was gonna tell you about my sleepover but you never came home-"
Dean shrugs and hops off the bed- what a shame, he actually wanted to continue kissing. "I'm kinda bored now-" he says.
"If I didn't, I wouldn't be risking everything for you-"
"Like, sexy-" Dean pulls off the floral dress and tosses it on the floor, he stands there naked. "I like black." he says before walking away from the scene. "Be creative! Maybe some stockings I don't fucking know-" he calls back, "Get me some friggin panties too-"
Castiel leans down to kiss his wet hair, "I'm coming right back, I haven't eaten yet-" Dean nods and waits for him to come back. When he does, he's got his sandwich and a soda, and a mug of Chamomile tea for Dean. "This might help you relax."
Sam punches him in the arm, "I can't kiss her without knowing how!"
"No Dean, I didn't-" his lips press onto the teens lips now, repeatedly. "That's just whiskey, makes you relax-"
Castiel smiles and kisses the top of his head quickly, "Of course-" then pulls away suddenly because Bobby was stomping around the kitchen to get lunch ready. "Anything else you want done to the house?-"
"Is that bad?" Jack's voice cracks before he takes the second drag of his life. Dean takes the cigarette back between his fingers, before he can respond he says "I bet you've been with lots of girls-"
"Well fuck." Dean pulls up a lawn chair so he can sit with his family. "I couldn't sleep last night."
by Aerosmith was playing softly on the radio. There were plenty of giggles shared in the front seat of the older teens car and you can blame the beer and their intolerance for it. The next song that comes on, makes them both laugh in awkwardness neither one of them changes the station to something more fitting for two guys to listen to while killing time.
Castiel hums, looking around "Stuff for your birthday."
âYeah...I pushed him pretty hard, and heâs old. Maybe I broke his back.â Castiel laughed, no humor to it. âIn all seriousness, I guess I broke his heart. Iâm a crap boyfriend.â
Castiel's nostrils flare up in a mixture of anger and jealousy, "He give those to you?"Â  eyes focused on the bruises on the teens neck.
What he doesn't know will certainly hurt him because as long as John Winchester is around, nothing will ever
"Ughhhh-" Dean's legs wraps around the mans neck now, keeping him there. "Ughhh-Daddy-" suddenly Castiel stops sucking him and he's positioning himself to fuck him once more. "Oh fuck-" he groans. "Again?"
"Dean's a good kid." he says casually.
"In case we wanna have sex?"
"Alright enough-" Castiel stops punching, closing his eyes and panting. John does the same, when they make eye contact- he thinks it means something it doesn't and Castiel grabs him by the collar, pulling him in for a kiss. It's short lived, no tongues involved. When John doesn't kiss him back he pulls away, releasing him. "Sorry-I-" his apology dies off in the cold air.
A few short spurts of pee shoot out of his little thing while he whimpers uncontrollably. When it's over, he looks up at his father who only stares him down in disgust for having
The boy shook his head " No you go! " He whispered loudly and embarrassed for his life right now. Dean simply relaxed against the wooden chair and made a hand gesture that made the boy furious.
"I'm smarter than everybody thinks, Cas-" his words sound almost saddened. "It's not like I could think about a future. You know? With dad bein' the way he was-"
Though he isn't quite sure why the film is called
The next morning is unfortunately his day off, it was only dreaded because he assumes Dean will tell his father about making him cry. Will today be the day he gets kicked out the house or worse, go to jail?
Castiel steps close enough to pull off the boys shirt, "Promise I'll be gentle baby-"
Eventually he turns his head to find Dean already looking at him intensely, "Guess you gotta leave already, huh-" and he nods in confirmation. "I hate this part, havin' to say goodbye-" as soon as his step fathers strong hand lands on the side of his face, his eyes shut automatically in submission. "I wish we weren't wrong-"
Castiel swallows, instantly hard in his pants. "Yeah, i guess-" he's pissed about the theft but it had been quite a while since he's gotten laid by the man. Whatever, he's craving some right about now and the mere mention of getting fucked turns him off.
Castiel looks over at the teen every few miles to see the all too familiar bitch face on him. "Are you mad because I-"
Dean gasps again when he's thrown on the bed on his stomach, Castiel starts to devour Dean's bubble butt with wet sloppy and loud kisses. Dean's mouth hangs open, making little hitched gasps.
"These accidents can't keep happening between us." Castiel says miserably, "If someone were to find out about us, you'll be taken away from me." he turns to face him, sitting up in bed. "Don't you get that?" His tone isn't gentle right now by any means. Dean doesn't like it. He looks like hes mad but also very hurt. "Forget it. Go do your homework if you have any, and go eat something."
"Why did you stop...do you not like it? is it ugly?" Castiel looked so worried. Eyes shooting from his own cock to the mans face.
"I promise, you'll be wherever I am."
"Oh my God you made pie." Dean licks his lips, he hurries to finish the burger because he knows he won't be allowed to have any unless he does so. They talk for a while, Dean makes jokes and Castiel laughs- it's weirdly romantic for a dinner that consists of burgers and fries. The teens bare foot gently touches his ankle underneath the table as if to tease him. By now the pie has cooled and the candles are almost out- "Can I?" he looks at the pie eagerly.
before closing the door behind him.
"I-" the urge to cry hits him again but he can't let the hot nurse see him cry. "It's awkward to talk about-"
Dean is still inconsolable, Castiel helps him onto the hospital bed and cradles him like a baby because- he's got no other choice.
Dean blushes. "Shut up, were only friends."
Castiel turns his side, facing away from him. "I'm not going anywhere."
who fucking smiles. "Mornin'-" he says casually, as if forgetting who the guy was. Brady rings the items up and tells them their total, which Dean pays for completely with the money he earns from being his stepfathers
Dean watches the man he loves walk away from his daughter and he can't help but feel sorry for them both. He hadn't gotten to know Claire at all through out his several weeks of Sunday school, but he could tell she was a good girl.Â Claire was nerdy, but had a flare to her personality. Kinda like
"Are ya sleepin' with him?-" his tone is neither angry nor happy, it's eerily calm, like the calm before a storm.
yea-" his eyes roll back. "I-I love you too-" and suddenly, emotions overwhelm him and tears sting his eyes. "
Castiel looks over at the teen, "Don't tell me you want a purse?"
Castiel groans, eyes watching the boys pink tongue and lips devouring his flesh hungrily. Every once in a while green eyes peek up to look at him as he moves up his body.
Eventually his eyes land on his cell mate with his scary group of friends and he was sad that the guy wasn't really hanging out with him. But of course, just because they're room mates, it doesn't mean they have to spend all this time together. After a while, his eyes land on a big guy who they call
"If he stays you're just gonna keep fightin' about- what were you fightin' about?" he asks again.
"Fluoride-" Derek mumbles as he now is polishing his teeth with some kind of electronic tooth brush. "Don't spit until I tell you-" he smiles, handing him a cup and some paper towels. Again Dean wants to make a joke, but doesn't.Â  "Go ahead and spit-" the order comes after a few minutes and Dean turns away a little bit because he's embarrassed to let this man see him spitting into a cup.
He's got to pee pretty fucking badly too but isn't willing to risk getting off the truck. The teen waits in the safety of the vehicle for a good thirty minutes before his step father finally arrives. Luckily he had that playboy to glance at so it's not like he had been bored the whole time. But now, he's hard in his jeans and he's got to pee. Not a good combination by any means.
"Maybe I am-" he gets down on both knees, looking up. "Will you marry-"
Dean rubbed his own tears away, feeling the moment passed. âIâll give you another orgasm.â
Dean almost forgot about his purchase until Robin comes running back to the truck once they get to her house. "You forget somethin-" he opens the drivers side window. Robin hands him a small gift bag from Victoria Secret. "Thanks-" surely he's blushing beet red from head to toe right now. "Bye, I'll call you-"
Dean smiles and that alone makes all the risks worth it. That night he fucks his beloved twink as hard and as rough as he can for hours. The bedroom they will now share together fills with Dean's crying moans and his own groans of pleasure. He doesn't stop fucking him until Dean falls asleep mid-fuck from exhaustion- who knows how many rounds they went, had to be a few.
Castiel smiles back at him, standing right in front of the boy on the steps. Dean's eyes wander down to his crotch, he's hard- they both are. "You gonna just stand there or-" and he's being lifted and thrown over the mans strong shoulder. "Cas!" he giggles as he's being taken to the bedroom, then thrown on the bed. "Fuck-" Dean pulls off his shirt, now working on his jeans while Castiel does the same.
"Mom-" Dean glares at her, then at their guest.
Dean laughs, "Fuck you too sweetheart." and continues eating. The car starts back up and they drive the rest of the way. Once they reach their destinations, it was too late to get anything done now so Castiel drives to a nearby hotel.
John's calls are coming in every few minutes and it's making him a nervous wreck because he's feeling like at any moment the door will be broken down by the cops. Surely they will put him away forever just for taking this boy and getting a motel room with him, regardless of the circumstances. He begins to pace around the room while biting his nails mindlessly, trying to think of what to do now.
Castiel lifts Dean up on the glass kitchen table, pushing his dress all the way up until his nipples are exposed- "Whose my pretty girl?" he asks, his hands now grabbing Dean's thick thighs.
"Cas- how you been doin?" Bobby smiles, "Dean said somethin' about you goin' to the doctor for depression." He nods. "Takin' the meds?"
John wills away the urge to smack his son for being so annoying and places the plate of eggs in front of him at the table. "Goin to go pick up Cas from the hospital right now-" just like that, he's stomping towards the front door to put on his jacket.
Bobby softly says, "I want ya to take care of yer heart and yer body-" they're making eye contact and it's not awkward, surprisingly. "Ya only get one of each, don't starve it. Feel yer pain, feel everything boy. Yer too young to be this broken." and because he knows his nephew is about to protest, "I know what's happened to ya, but it's apart of you now and ya can't do shit about it-"
Tears spill down Dean's cheeks, "He has a boyfriend, he- comes over sometimes." is all he can say before the front door slams and he knows he's safe now. "Cas!" Dean screams urgently. Relief floods him when he hears footsteps rushing over. "Cas!"
"Fine!" Castiel yells, he'll admit to it just so he doesn't go to Dean about this. "I cheated!"
He's officially jealous of this Pamela person, "How do you know she would be interested in you?" after a beat he says, "-or me."
Dean would never admit it but he enjoys being Robins
Castiel, open mouthed, nodded like it was his first time again. Cute, Dean thought.
with him in such a short amount of time is creeping him out but there's no where to run from the guy in here.
Dean moans, then looks over his shoulder and again reaches for a kiss. This time Castiel doesn't reject him, and they start up again. The teen tries to roll over but he's kept in place, so that he can give him a simple hand job. No more, no less- happy
Dean starts kissing and biting at his neck, nothing crazy, it was more of a gentle
"Oh-" Dean still chugs the soda and wipes his mouth off with the back of his hand when he's done. "Can you call dad to come home-"
Castiel leans forward to grab a folder that was on the coffee table and begins to look through it, one eyebrow raises. "I'm impressed-" because most of the work inside was graded with very high marks. "But then again, cars are your thing-"
He shakes his head, "No I just don't wanna kiss right now." he pulls the thin sheet up to his nose. "Please just go Cas- It wasn't a good night." The older man nods sadly and leaves the room feeling rejected. Dean grabs his phone, going to his recent calls. He blocks the number- John must have called him from his hospital room. All he can think about most of the night as he tosses and turns in bed is how is he going to face Castiel with the words his father spoke to him vibrating in his ear and he hopes he doesn't love Castiel only because he's got
After a while Castiel revisits the topic, "That guy is a perv Dean-" the teen looks over at him. "Probably wanted you to do some kiddie porn-" that makes him laugh. "I'm serious, you can't trust a random guy who walks up to you and asks you if you're a model-"
Castiel's heart melts, "Sure-uh-" he sits down at the kitchen table with his laptop and iced coffee. "-do you mind playing here while I do some research?" he asks and Dean agrees, before he sits next to the man he goes to grab his homework so he can do it at the table. "So, you chose homework over toys, I'm impressed." he comments. They work side by side in silence for about an hour when the boy asks him what he's doing on his computer.
It's like Castiel knew that Dean wasn't over needing a father just yet and came to this conclusion after thinking about it for a long time. It was impossible to feel ready for marriage when you haven't had a real childhood in the first place. If he had to to be one to give that to him, then so be it because he loves Dean Winchester that much.
"I'll call you again on my lunch break, tell you what happens." he sighs into the phone loudly again. "You're everything to me, you know that right-"
The doctor looks through his lab results, "Everything looks normal- your blood pressure is a little high, have you been stressed lately?" Castiel chuckles, nodding. "Mr. Novak, I believe you're dealing with mild depression-"
"Thanks." Dean's tying his boot laces.
Dean locked eyes with blue, âI canât count on that. Iâm not even sure I can change. My phones filled with dozens of numbers again.â He confessed, reaching over to the nightstand to grab his phone to show Castiel. âTake a look. Iâm still talking to guys and Iâm still having sex with men who arenât you.â
"That's none of your business."
"Stop that-" Dean comes closer to him, pulling his hand away from his mouth- he'd been biting his nails. "That's my habit-" he smiles warmly up at him and Castiel's overcome with the urge to kiss the hell out of the teen but he represses it. "Come on, you need to get out of the house. Bobby told me you haven't been to work either, I hope they don't fire your ass-"
Dean's class buddies all huddle around him at school that day as they sing happy birthday to him. His only female friend Charlie gives him a kiss on the lips when no one is looking and it feels beyond
Johns fucking his doctor boyfriend so aggressively that his balance is lost and has to help him onto the table so now he's bend over with his knees spread wide apart. He really is loving this, having that ass up high just for him to enjoy.
Before the bearded man disappears he says, "Stay for a while?" and he nods before going to make that soup in the kitchen. In no time at all he returns, most likely because all the soup he had in the house came in a can. "Thank you, Bobby-"
There he was. Dean, shirtless and sweaty even though it was chilly out.
"I'm hungry." Dean comes into the kitchen where they had been enjoying their beers. He looks through the fridge and pulls out some left over apple pie- he takes a seat next to his uncle. "Why are you staring at me?"
In less than a few minutes Dean grabs onto Castiel's hair and pulls on it- his body arches up- he tenses- "Shiiit-" and comes down his throat. He falls back against the bed and makes a crying sound- "Oh my-fuck-" he sighs loudly.
"Agh-" Dean groans, rubbing his head while Castiel hides his smile behind his napkin. "Shut up Cas, know you're laughing at me, you dick."
"My butt." Dean confessed, looking ashamed. "M-My thighs. My legs. Sometimes I tried to out run him. I'd run to my room and lock the door. I had to push against it with all I could so Dad wouldn't break in. I was so scared what would happen if he got in my room... " he trembles. "Dad likes to sit outside-" Castiel nods, letting him continue. "and sometimes if I'd go near him he would- he-"
"Oh shit, right-" Dean giggles, knocking over the rest of his beer and runs up to the house for the cake and hopes he won't drop the thing on the grass. He comes out a few minutes later with the large cake- "Cas, we got you this-" Bobby helps him carry it the rest of the way and they set it down on the table they had been sitting at all night.
Later on that week on Friday night, John called Castiel to come over for dinner. Though he's assuming he just needed a babysitter for the night so he could fuck another woman. When he parks his car next to the impala he has completely convinced himself that it was his entire motive for having him around, using him as a nanny for his boy.
The following day Dean takes the bus home and is surprised to that Castiel was already there. "You're home already-" he softy says, dropping his backpack by the front door.
"More or less, yea-"
âShh, Iâm sure he needs time. Maybe you hurt him?â
Dean was all too used to staying home alone and actually preferred it, unless he was home
Dean made love to Castiel for the first time at the orchard on an old blanket Dean used to keep in his car. It smelled like coffee and cigarettes even though he didn't smoke. After that first time, Dean couldn't stop thinking about the teenager. He had a smile on his face every single time he saw him and every single time he laughed at his stupid jokes that weren't really funny to begin with.
"Everything's okay." he leans in to kiss the boy's forehead but Dean reaches up and steals a second kiss, "Dean."
Alex almost wants to laugh, "You don't know me, why are you trying to save me?" there's some humor to his voice.
The three of them enjoyed a nice lunch together when Robin took her break, many laughs were shared and didn't even flinch when Castiel accidentally held onto Dean's hand on top of the table. When he notices what he's done, he removes his hand casually as he can. Eventually the girl gets back to work but not before bringing them an entire pie and coffees to go.
Dean painfully scoots over until his back is pressed against the concrete wall in order to make room, so that his bunk mate is laying next to him rather than on top of him. Clearly, he's not getting the memo and begins attacking him once more and again he's struggling against the man.
"Uh, I'm here to see Doctor Novak-" he mutters quickly at a random nurse who happens to walk by him.
"Such as?" Castiel asks.
On the way home he stops by Starbucks for his usual iced coffee and he was going to need it because he had to get Dean ready and take him out to get candy even though he was beyond exhausted. "Dean!" he shouts casually as he steps through the front door, "I'm home!"
Dean shakes his head, not wanting to take the medicine. Blue eyes glares at him dominantly, clearly losing his patience so he takes the cup and drinks it down. "Bleh-" he makes a dramatic choking sound.
"Thought everyone forgot my birthday." Dean licks frosting off his finger before grabbing a fork to dig into his big slice of cake. "Thanks." he says with a mouthful- Red and Pink frosting gather at the corners of his mouth as he eats.
Dean shakes his head, "Fuck him. I hate him."
They're about to leave the hospital when they run into Castiel, who had been working and had no idea of the days events. As soon as he saw Castiel, Dean ran towards him and tried to tell him what happened to his father but the tears wouldn't let him- his sobs broke him and he fell to his knees right in front of his step dad.
Dean smiles, shoving him against the wall a little too hard for it to be playful. "Yea and what are you gonna do about it-" and his friend shoves him against the opposite wall roughly before grabbing him and throwing him to the floor in a rough housing manner while laughing like psychopaths in the nearly deserted place.
Castiel rolls his eyes, kissing Dean quickly. "I'm fucking nervous." he bites his lip, "Who the hell let me become a doctor!"
Surprisingly Ash nods in understanding, "I don't eat much either-" and pats the pack of cigarettes in his jeans pocket. "These things kill my appetite like no other, but what're ya gonna do when you have anxiety."
Castiel in annoyance says, "He doesn't need medication. Let's go."
Sam shakes his head, "Are you on a diet?"
After all both of them are planning to only do this
Castiel took off early from work and drove to the store to get some much needed supplies for the big night. Though as the hours go on, his nerves are intensifying and no he is not going to fucking propose because he's already been there and done that. The reason for his anxiety was something else, a romantic getaway that was planned on a sudden whim.
When they get back to Bobby's, Castiel stays for dinner because Dean begged him too. Dean knew he was going to have an unpredictable day tomorrow, who knew if he was going to see Castiel again after that- they could find him guilty, arrest him. Who knows.
Bobby smiles, chuckling- "You want a girl? I can find you a girl-"
Dean looks up, not the slightest bit interested in breakfast. "Maybe just eggs." he swallows, setting his phone to the side. "And some coffee-"
Dean groaned, trying to put more of a show for the boy, making his biceps flex as he stroked long and slow, the muscles in his stomach contracting as he breathed.  After a minute he rasped heavily, " Come on Cas. I know you wanna touch it at least, It's not wrong to touch. "
had been so brief, it felt good in all the wrong ways. "I raped you, you told your parents-"
Castiel dismisses the boy, "Go ahead, I have chores to do." and gets to work on the dishes, laundry and everything else that needed to get done.
He looks at Dean with his almost blonde hair and freckles everywhere- looking nothing like him. "His mom was very... white."
Castiel comes outside, standing right beside him with his hands on his hips. "Think a dog got your cat?" there's a beat of silence, "A wild animal or something?"
"Don't worry about it-" Castiel kisses his forehead for the first time that night and he makes a mental note not to do it ever again since the boy wasn't actually his son. Yet he was already starting to care about the boy more than anything else, wanting only good things for him.
Anyway, the company is very much welcomed and it's so much fun having someone to goof off with in the car. Dean and Castiel sing horribly to random songs on the radio as the morning light bathes them in such a beautiful glow through the cars windows.
Dean looks up dumbly, his face is red and he's panting. From the looks of it he had just been kissing her neck - "I can explain-"
"Come here-" Castiel pulls him into bed and they share a good cry, together. They let it all out that night- they don't know if they're crying over John's passing, or if- they're just letting out all the pain they've felt the last few years.
The teen shuts his eyes in humiliation before turning around and walking away, wishing he could stay with the man for a while. All he wanted was to have someone to hang out with since he hadn't made any other friends here yet, and yes that was probably a good thing but he wanted friends. Castiel wasn't technically his friend, who knows what he was- his body guard maybe? But whose going to protect him from Castiel- the guy has made it more than clear that he wants inside his pants.
Castiel reaches into his pocket and hands him an extra house key. "I was planning on giving you a key to the house anyway." Dean takes the key and pockets it, blushing. "It'll give you an excuse to come over more often-"
instantly and relief floods his body. "Great-" he hands them the forms he had been holding onto while showing them around, "Sign here."
He pries again, "You didn't answer my question back there-"Â  and the teen looks over. "Why were you like that?"
"Like I said, I'll think about it." the dancer kisses Castiel a final time, "Thank you for the money." then leaves the room.
They hadn't heard John come in with all the laughing going on in the kitchen. Castiel doesn't stop what he's doing until his gruff voice says, "Quit it before he pees all over himself-"
"What's wrong-" Dean chokes up, he hadn't meant to but he can't help it if it hurts when he's spoken to like this by the man he loves.
The duo point to the half full coffee pot on the counter and watch him stumble to prepare himself a cup, surprisingly not spilling any considering that his eyes were somehow still closed.
Dean looks up at him sleepily, elbows on his thighs as he's hunched over. "A while-" he yawns, "I can't go-"
At the kitchen table, he makes his best effort to eat the eggs and waffles in front of him but he can't- he's losing his breath. Bobby doesn't mention it although he did notice, he'd have to call Castiel and mention it to him later. "Dean?" he asks the teen whose struggling to stand up from the table- he's got the strangest look on his face. His breathing is harsh like he'd just ran a marathon and he falls over onto the floor- "Dean!" Bobby goes to pull him up thinking he had passed out but he didn't, he just fell because he was so dizzy, "Boy, what's wrong?"
Blue eyes look away and Castiel takes a sip of his beer, Dean couldn't help but swallow his arousal because even though his step father scared the crap out of him when he pissed- the guy was pretty fucking sexy too, especially when pissed.
"Mmm-" he moans while they tongue kiss, it felt so good to be pressed up against another wet body. "You're right, it does feel good-" and he's referring to the water pressure, among other things.
"You can always talk to me-" Castiel starts, pouring Dean some coffee now.
Dean sighs, "Don't even have anything memorized-"
âCan you afford to live on your own?â Dean questioned. Looking straight ahead at the road.
" Not yet. " Castiel squirmed out of his grip but Dean was fast and pressed him to the wall closest to them, facing him.
Castiel exhales loudly, "Fuck-" and blinks the stars away that flood his vision. Once his eyes focus and he sees what he's done to his love, he laughs wholeheartedly. "Baby-" he laughs some more, the teen joins in too. "I'm so sorry-"
"I thought we could-"
"Castiel is the angel of Thursday." Dean nods. "My real name was James Novak-" he looks over at the teen once more. "-my family called me Jimmy."
"So good-" Castiel groans, the bottom of Dean's shirt is balled into his fist- using that as leverage as he pounds into him. "Mmm-"
He sighed, "It is. Isn't it." looking at the bed and got dizzy. He blinked several times.
"You look like you just had sex." Castiel states, watching him.
Dean wipes the sweat off his forehead with the end of his shirt, doing his best to act Casual because he knows blue eyes are watching them.Â  "You know I only suck your dick because I like what you give me-" Brady laughs, "I don't like you like that, I have a girlfriend." and it was true, he did. To the knowledge of the world, Robin was his girlfriend but only three people in the entire universe knew it was just a cover and those people were himself, Castiel and Robin.
He instantly feels sorry and knows anger isn't the way to approach the situation, "I'm sorry." he kisses Dean's wet hair, "I worry about you, you know that." he kisses the corner of his mouth now- the kiss isn't returned.
Right as he puts on a pot of water on the stove for the pasta he plans on making for dinner, his phone rings and he answers it.
Castiel blushes, he's holding the man's hand. "I'm still pre-med. It will be a long time before I'm a doctor."
"You have to kill her." Dean says between labored breaths and by the look on his face he's serious. "If you love me Cas, you'll fucking kill her."
"I have-" he hesitates before shaking his head.
Dean picks up a red one and takes a whiff. "This one smells like roses, get this one-" Castiel nods and grabs a few more of the same candle. They waste time looking around through all the aisles because they don't want to go home yet. Eventually they get bored so they pay for their things and make the drive back home. Bobby's truck still wasn't there so they go straight to Castiel's place, they wait outside on the porch a while.
Castiel made a crying sound. " You're making it worse- " He had no idea the heat in his belly was
Dean downright chugged an entire bottle of water in less than a minute, almost dropping the now empty bottle on the floor when something walks by. Something was caught in his peripheral vision, something tall and dark. It couldn't be Bobby walking by, he was in the hospital, to be released later that morning if everything goes as planned.
âIâm almost your dadâs age.â he paused,âOr was almost his age.â
Dean laughs, "I wish. Look at me-" he grips his stomach, a little bit of extra skin there which was completely normal.
out there. In the trees. Or by the wooden fence. His dreams were shadow free. No bumps or screams in the night.
They exchange several soft kisses, all the while Castiel's been squeezing and groping the teens ass. "Mmm-" he finally pulls away from the virgin mouth, green eyes look up at him innocently. "I'm gonna fuck you so good-" the teen sucks in a frightened breath. "Fuck you so hard-" he sucks on the boys bottom lip before biting it gently.
The boy nodded furiously , still so afraid he would get in trouble for being nosy. " Anything, Mr. Winchester. "
On his lunch break he sits down at his favorite booth with a cup of decaf and a slice of pie. While he's eating he looks out the window, it was raining now and he didn't mind that one bit either. Maybe that's why the diner had been so empty today. When his pie is polished off and his coffee is half way done Lisa comes over and sits across from him, studying him.
Pool hustling involved way too much talking and sometimes he didn't feel like talking to anybody. Besides, it took hours and a quick hand job was over before he could blink.
Back at Sam's place Dean is yelling, "Sam! It's my turn!" as they play their video game in the boys bedroom.
"Go ahead." Castiel says and finishes his toast alone. Afterwards he goes to sit on the couch and turns on the television, nothing but static so he shuts it off. He's biting his nails in boredom and looks over to the window- still coming down hard so he decides to bite the bullet and call the hospital to let them know he won't be in for another day or two. Hopefully the flooding lessens before then because really doesn't want to miss too many days at work.
Castiel glares at him and he instantly regrets making the joke, "I don't want you seeing Charlie in the house while I'm not around."
"What the fuck why are you bein' a dick?"
Dean sighed, " Well you have my phone, Delete it all. " he stood up now and wrapped an arm around the boy to pull him close to his chest. " Give me a real chance. "
"Leave me alone!" He ran off into the apple orchard, upset over his mother telling him that this stay could be final. He didn't want to stay here. California was a better place for him. There was more people like him there.
Dean nods before going to the kitchen, then coming right back. "What do I bring-"
Dean squints, scratching his head. "You know you're not supposed to be out of the house right? You could die."
"Uh-" the doctor looks at Castiel, who nods. "I can order some blood work to check for things of that nature, but the results will come back to me in a couple of days." they both nod, "If you don't hear from me in a week, it's safe to say I didn't find anything-"
Dean smiles and Castiel recognizes that smile- he's about to push his buttons. "So, Cas. Be honest, have you fucked anyone?"
"That was our tenant-" he glares at Dean, "-will you stop looking at me like that, God." Castiel peels out of the drive way and starts on the drive home.
"Cas-shh-" Dean holds the older man in his arms, rubbing up and down his back. "I'm here for you-I know I've been a nightmare this whole time. I'm so sorry-" the apology makes him cry harder but Dean doesn't say anything- he knows he's been holding it in for so long. After a few minutes Castiel peels himself away from the teen, "Better?"
Dean tries his best not to panic. "Yea- his room is cooler. That's why- you know- I go there- a lot." He forces a smile and it's painful. "Uh- well I'm gonna go-brush my teeth. Get ready for bed." he laughs nervously.
"Yea-" he swats at his arm, "Darn mosquitoes-" the pie is placed in front of him with a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream on top and the bearded man smiles before digging in. "This is good-"
"See what?" Dean's eyes gaze over his entire body until they land on his crotch. "No-that's-" Castiel grows flustered, his hand rubs at the back of his neck. "Why would you ask me such a thing?" he just shrugs and sits down on the edge of his little twin bed. "Can you keep a secret?" the truth is, he wants to show him and he doesn't know why. He sits on the edge of the bed next to the boy. Nervously Castiel pulls out his cock while refusing to meet his gaze.
Castiel could tell he was keeping it in his mouth so he could spit it out when he turned his back. "Swallow it."
"Are you sure baby?" the teen nods, biting his lip again. "We'll go slow-" he nods again. "Do you want to get in bed?" he agrees and so he guides the teen out of his clothes into the plain bed, helping him lay back against the pillow. "Can I kiss you?"
Dean places his hand on his stomach because suddenly his insides burn with the shock of such news. "What happened?" his voice is tight, upset that no one keeps him in the loop.
The kiss scares Dean and he quickly pushes the older man away. "What the fuck, I'm not into that gay shit-" and it was a lie, he'd been a little curious for a while now.
"Was that okay?" Derek asks softly, still peppering kisses on his neck as they come down from the natural high that had been achieved. The teens body underneath his is still giving a few involuntary twitches.
Castiel stands, "Say no more, I'll talk to Dean and We'll figure something out." he's anxious to get out of there all of a sudden. "Right, Dean?"
"Where's Dean?" he asks when he walks into the kitchen.
Castiel sighs and runs his fingers through his hair, "I understand your curiosity but you're too young to be trying to have sex with her."
they would have found something by now. He's had quite a few blood tests done, all normal. Everything's
That's when other prisoners start pointing at him as they whisper to each other which Castiel doesn't like, so he looks over his shoulder to see what everyone seems to be pointing at. That's when he sees it, blood on the back of the teens khaki pants. "Damn it-" he quickly stands up and follows him. A frightened Dean gets guided to the showers then, "You're bleeding-" Castiel mentions quietly as they make their way.
Jack nods, "Why how old are you? We look the same age."
When Dean enters the house, Bobby tells him to pack it in already and head to bed because he's got class tomorrow. But of course he doesn't go to bed right then, there's something in his jeans that needs to be taken care of first. Dean pulls off his shirt and kicks off his jeans before letting himself fall onto the bed. He takes his time with the task this time, his breaths coming in heavily and slow.
"Yea?" he may think she's pretty but doesn't like her attitude. "What-" he says, getting annoyed at the fact that she's just staring at him.
"I-I-
When he peeks through the screen door, his step father waves casually at him from behind his cars tinted windows so all he could see where the guys fingers wiggling over the steering wheel.
"Dean-" He whispers, not being able to resist. He lets his mouth open just a bit before the boy dives in. Shoving his sticky ice cold tongue in the man's mouth. "Mmm." Castiel loves the way he tastes right now. Like strawberry and innocence. "He tries to pull away but the kiss is too sweet. "Fuck-" managing to pull away.
Dean nods, "Hi." he walks over to her and extends his hand for her to shake. She takes it and shakes. "Nice to see you." he says out of simple human courtesy.
"You love it-" he murmurs against his soft milky white skin, now kissing near the boys pink asshole. "Want me to eat your ass baby?" he asks sweetly and Dean moans, nodding frantically. "Shh, baby. Relax-"
Dean clears his throat and lies again, calling Castiel his dad over the phone. "Dad, my stomach hurts. Can you come get me?"
"Ready?" Castiel comes in and puts a towel over around the teens neck. Dean nods and Castiel's got his fingers in his hair, measuring with them. "I'll use the scissors then that-" he gestures to the electric razor that was plugged in by the sink. Dean closes his eyes and relaxes as he gets his hair cut, almost falling asleep until he hears the electric razor come to life. "Almost done baby."
"Asshole." Dean spits, he gets up and runs out of the house.
He falls asleep afterwards, nude. When he awakens the next morning he feels relaxed- he stretches his limbs before he reaches for his dying cellphone- Robin texted him. He opened her message telling him to meet her at the diner for breakfast and that it was urgent. After pulling himself out of bed he dresses right away in a simple dark green shirt and jeans, his boots too of course and Castiel's ever present ring on his left middle finger. His hair- he didn't do anything to it, she said it was urgent and he had to go. Now.
Castiel thinks about it while sipping on his drink, "Alright-" then smiles. "You really love me huh?" the nurse nods with a sad smile.
When Dean blinks furiously and sighs heavily, he knows it did the trick. "Whas that?" he's sleepy, the kind of sleepy that feels really good.
"I was fine, then I felt like I was falling-" Dean closes his eyes, a tear rolls down the side of his face anyway. "I fell and I never got up."
Bobby shrugs, "He tried to go back to work after his leave- but the chief wasn't havin' it. He was too spooked by the whole thing- didn't like his new tattoos. The son of a bitch got a pentagram tattooed on his arm-he listened to that heavy metal nonsense in his patrol car. Not a big deal but the chief was a heavy duty christian, no way he was having any one like that working for him."
He hesitates before answering, "I do-" and takes another drag of his cigarette, blowing smoke into his friends face by accident. "We're getting married someday-" and the words also sound strange coming out of his mouth.
Ash scratches the back of his head, "I let them out on his front por-" and right then a woman's screams could be heard in the distance.
Castiel cleans him off with some tissues, "You did work up an appetite." he smiles before he leans in, then stops himself. "Go take a shower and brush your teeth. You have Charlie in your mouth."
âNo Cas. He was a lot older than me and I was a teenager. Thatâs why I didnât want to date you, I didnât wanna do the same thing to you that he did to me. I was very...hot and cold about getting involved with you.â
Castiel is almost out the door when that familiar voice says
"What?" Castiel squints at the man sitting by his bed. "I wasn't drinking-" and it was true, he wasn't, or at least he doesn't think so. The last time he checked, that bottle of whiskey was half full and it was a new bottle he'd gotten after the last and final time he'd gotten drunk after John died.
The kitten sniffs the box before climbing inside, sitting down on the dish towel bed and it squeaks again. Apparently the kitten doesn't know how to meow yet and it makes Dean laugh before he picks her up, "Are you a boy or girl, hmm-" he turns the kitten over, "You're a girl-" he assumes because he doesn't really see much
Dean grows shy again, "I gained like twenty pounds-" Castiel smacks his thigh under the water, making the funniest sound. "-the fuck was that for?"
Kelly sighs distantly while feeding her son at the table, "Isn't that sad?"
Castiel's heart jumps to his throat, this is all they needed right now. "Uh-Yea. I miss you too-" he hears Dean say. "M'fine- I just got out of the hospital. Jo-I'm friggin' fine, We're not together anymore so quit worrying about me-" and he hangs up. Dean plays it cool, "All the friggin girls want me-"
"It's Gucci-" Castiel says, embarrassed.
Castiel's heart feels like breaking while he drives, "I should've gotten you some tutoring-" he's shaking his head in regret, "If I just knew you wanted
Dean leans into his step father for comfort and they snuggle on Dean's bed for a while until he asks, "And Bobby, how is he?"
Castiel looks at him for a second, before pulling into the driveway of their house. "Why?"
"Why?" he asks.
"It's okay baby girl, you're my good girl-" Dean pushes back so that he's on his knees, he want's to see his dick inside of her. Well, the inch that fits in there. "It's so tight-" he spreads her lips open with his thumbs as if that would allow him to enter fully. "So wet-" Dean closes his eyes, he can't help but groan at the feeling. When he opens his eyes he looks down, pushing another half inch and when he pulls out a little he sees a bit of red dribbling down along her pale skin. "Fuck."
"Thanks, Bobby-" they eat their desserts in silence for a while.
He swallows again, "Yea, I know that but-"
that he calls dad.
Dean groans, pinching the bridge of his nose for a second as a migraine hits him all of a sudden, "Fuck-" and yet it still feels good because he's hard instantly.
The moment he exits his car, the mechanic slams the front door before walking down the street in a hurry. He doesn't even have to wonder where the man is going, the bar around the corner was the only place he goes to on foot.
"What's wrong?" Castiel asks, John hadn't noticed that his son wasn't eating.
" he says in reference to his child.
Castiel watches him, all he can see is Dean's pale face- the dark under eyes. How his green eyes aren't as bright as they used to be. How his finger nails are a slight blueish color. He could cry right now but he smiles and holds it together, "Okay."
"Didn't smell like this in here before-" Dean waves a hand in the air while they sit on the couch, half watching the television and half fooling around. Castiel agrees and soon enough they're back to making out like school kids. At some point their shirts come off, pants are next but Dean's phone rings.
While their video game loads up again, "You wanna practice?" his eyes are on the television screen.
Castiel shakes his head, "No." though there's a blush on his face- he does like those rare times when Dean can be there for him because sometimes he needs to let it go- he's been holding so much of his emotions inside in order to be strong for Dean. Because Dean was weak- Dean needed him more. He always had to be strong. "But I wasn't lying when I said I didn't feel well-"
They enjoy the golden orange glow in the horizon that bathes
"Would you feel better if you had sex with someone else-" now he's the one biting his nails nervously. The teen looks at him, confused. "Like an open relationship-"
Dean takes the cash and counts it, "Five hundred?" Castiel nods, saying that he earned it. "Thanks-" he pockets the cash and goes to the front door, "No no no!" he yells.
Castiel chuckles. "I worked all day." he takes another bite, "Why are you here?"
John runs a hand down his face, "I need to talk to you-" Castiel glares at him. "-In private." he follows the mechanic to the bedroom so they can
"Excuse me?" Castiel says firmly, sounding hurt.
âBabyâ¦â Dean whispered in his ear, âWake up.â
Dean pulled down Castiels zipper, fingers sliding in to feel the fabric of cotton briefs. "You're alright." Castiel closed his eyes for what seemed like a second, his jeans and briefs were pulled down to mid thigh. Cock freed. It lay there.
Castiel shakes his head, biting his lip. He doesn't want to answer the question.
"Ah- ah-" Dean whimpers, biting his lip. "Please don't touch-"
The teen laughs weakly before shoving his uncle playfully, "You always know how to make me laugh, thanks Bobby-" and he's about to walk off to his bedroom, but looks over his shoulder. "You
Dean looks over at the water faucet above the tub, "You do
He orders his son, "Go to your fuckin' room-"
"Sam, where's the fucking cat?" Dean asks his friend once they arrive at the clearing of trees near their school. "I don't see it-"
Dean's eating chips on the living room sofa when there's a knock at the door and instantly he thinks it's weird, it's around the time Castiel comes home from the hospital but why would he knock. He has a key. He sets the bag of chips on the coffee table and gets up to get the door.
"You see-" John huffs, exhaling the cigarette smoke from his mouth slowly. "-and comments like that are why I hit you."
Rather than apologizing and bringing attention to the slip of his hand, the attention is refocused on a shopping trip to get Dean some new clothes that were very much needed.
"You like the nerds huh-" he laughs softly. "-me too, friggin' wild." he shudders, thinking of Castiel. After class is over Dean passes on the cookies and kool-aid and takes off to meet his step father who as usual, was leaning against his car waiting for him. "Let's gooo-" he groans deeply, mostly to be funny.
Dean struggles, "Four, I think-" he isn't scared- he loves being man handled and dominated by Castiel. He hasn't been given anything he can't handle yet and he's grateful. "You're hurting me-" he plays along because his dick is hard once again.
"Bobby-" Castiel says sleepily and gets up, Dean arranges himself on the couch now that he's got it all to himself. He makes his way to the kitchen, "He was scared so I-we-"
"Ugh shit-" Dean cries, humping into Castiels strong abdomen as the cock in his ass pushes in and out of him at an unrelenting pace. "-ugh- ugh- ugh-" he begins to cry out softly like he always did when he was getting close.
A slight blush creeps up his body and it stops at his cheeks. "Good I guess, didn't really do much." His uncle nods and eats his food without asking any other questions. "Can I go to my room?" he asks, Castiel nods.
truth, the truth about his step father- that they have sex, that they are together.
"Oh, stop." The teen smiles, "You're still sexy." When the older man looks at him, he winks.
Late in the afternoon is when Castiel has had enough of the silence and asks the boy to go take a walk with him through the neighborhood.
"Asleep." Castiel murmurs and he turns the page of his book- his glasses were on the tip of his nose threatening to fall off his face. Dean grabs his book and sets it on the small table in front of the couch before laying against his chest. "What's going on in here-" Castiel rubs the teens forehead with his fingertips, he shrugs. "You know you can talk to me, don't you?"
"Goodnight baby-" he whispers into the teens hair and apologizes "So sorry-" once again before closing his eyes to fall asleep.
The figure turns around slowly, his hands raising once it's on it's back.
The neighbors that were out walking their dogs for the first time in weeks due to the weather probably had the impression by now that he was some kind of kept boy by the looks of him. Shirtless in his khaki shorts, tanned skin and drinking iced coffee on a Monday afternoon while his mechanic macho boyfriend was at work.
Dean shrugs, kissing back. "I-" the memories of last night come flooding back- Castiel wants to marry him one day and he wants to cry. "Cas-"
The older man dropped a wheelbarrow he was dragging around. "Excuse me?"
After a full day of working and not checking his phone, Bobby says it's enough for today and orders him inside. Dean stomps into the house and pulls out his phone, expecting a missed call from Castiel or a text.
Dean blushes, nodding and he bounces up and down on the thick cock that was in his ass for a while before leaning forward, over his step dad and he begins to hump him while Castiel's cock was buried deep in his ass.
Castiel's voice is firm, "I said, come to daddy didn't I?" The teen nods quickly, inching closer. "Then come sit sweetheart-"
Dean knocks on the front door because it was locked for once, "Cas!" he calls through the door. "Helloo-" he cups his hands over the window so he can get a better look inside. He knocks one final time before giving up. Dean reaches the fence when Castiel opens the door.
Ash asks, "Well?" the younger teen looks at him finally. "Should I try to get with her or not? She's got kids so she won't want nothin' serious from me-"
Though now that he's promised Dean a handful of times that he wasn't going to go anywhere, it would be a really shitty thing to break such a promise. The promise will be kept no matter how much it pains him to be with this man because he's worth it and so much more.
Castiel smiles down at him, trying not to laugh himself. The boy looked adorable. "Let's get going-" he looks at the watch on his wrist. "-gonna take you to my old neighborhood, the people there should be giving out some really good candy." Once they're in the car and Dean is buckled in he reaches into the back seat, pulling out a pumpkin shaped bucket for him to use. "Got you this today."
That made him smile and relax, grip on the steering wheel loosening as he drove home on Sunday evening. Of course he was going to give it his all in order to win over that little shit.
"Hurry it up in there!" Dean whines, "Gotta go." Castiel hides the bottle in his pajama pants and exits the bathroom, "Finally!" While he's alone- he decides to take one. What the hell- he swallows one pill and instantly regrets it. Surely he could beat this on his own.
The boys trauma over what's been going on with his father in the dead of night had caused him to make believe that his mother was there to offer him comfort. Dean was secretly thinking that maybe she was dead and that it was the reason she never came back. It was better to have her
Dean pulls the man down next to him and wraps his arms around his neck, "What's this music?"
Castiel looks away because seeing that precious face about to cry is something he doesn't like to see. "Your dad is so mean-" it's honest and it's said in a way so that the boy will understand. "He yells at me and I yell at him, I don't want to fight anymore." there's a pause. "I don't like that were scaring you-" he sounds so defeated regardless if attempting to leave is for his own good, there's Dean to worry about.
Castiel nibbles gently on the kids earlobe, tugging on it "You wanna put your dick in a pussy, don't you? Dean."
He changes the subject, "Ya mind rakin' the leaves and choppin' some wood back at the house?"
Castiel froze in their mid makeout session, "Nervous alert..."
"Dean!" He storms off, Dean took off running down the dirt road that leads to nowhere but trees on either side. "Come back!"
Dean falls to his knees with his hands clasped together, begging. "Please-" he sobs. "-don't leave me."
"Shit, Bobby-" he quickly digs it out from his jeans and answers the call
Castiel wasn't going to accept that, he needed answers. He loved Dean so much, he wasn't going to let him be upset over him.
After stumbling into the room and locking the door behind them, they part.
No one knows if it was heat stroke- dehydration- or
"He's my step dad-" he pants, getting up from the ground. "Cas-"
In the morning Castiel goes to pick up breakfast on his own- he couldn't manage to get the teen out of bed. When he comes back, Dean's sitting on the kitchen table with his phone in his hands- his fingers working away on the screen. "Why is Jack waiting for you outside?" he asks, looking puzzled but mostly annoyed.
Castiel begs shyly, "Don't stop-" swallows thickly, half groaning. "Keep going-"
"I can see that-" Meg smiles, "Your whole aura has changed."
Dean smiles sadly,Â  Cas, you're acting like you're my dad-"
The guy hadn't taken him out on a date yet and they haven't gone anywhere in public as a couple either so he confronted him about it the next time they saw each other.
Sam perks up on the sofa, "My mom's leaving out of town for a few days-" Castiel nods, looking at Dean now- his arms are crossed at his chest.
"Sure-" Dean doesn't like being fed with a spoon, but if it's Castiel- he'll endure it. He's so out of it that by the time he's done with the lukewarm soup that he starts mumbling about a trip he would like to take- "-a cabin in the woods-just us-doesn't that sound nice-"
"No, I didn't." Castiel goes to his room, slipping out of his scrubs.
Once he's dressed in sweatpants and a basic white tee he goes looking around for Castiel but doesn't find him. He goes to look by the front door and sure enough- his backpack and work shoes are gone. That lets him know he's already gone for work.
"No manners on that boy sometimes." Bobby continues, "He was a marine and a good friend of mine. He had a lovely wife and he went to church every Sunday- even convinced me to start goin'-" This time he's the one who gets up and begins to make a few sandwiches- "About five years ago, Gorgon became a cop- and a damn good one." Once again he resumes his place at the table with the sandwiches he just made.
"Then pull over and fuck me." Dean says, seriously.
Castiel smiles, "Maybe a little." after a minute, "You better say yes when I ask you." Dean nods. "I'm counting the days." he knows he means the days until his birthday, Dean guesses he's going to pop the question then, maybe after closing his eyes to blow out the candles on his birthday cake. He's often imagined that's how it would happen, he'd blow out the candles and when he'd open his eyes- there would be Castiel down on one knee holding up a ring to his face.
He seems to like that response because he nods and goes to his room. Castiel looks at Bobby, "Sorry about that-" and hides his face in his coffee mug.
"Close your mouth." He orders him, "Don't be disgusting-" Dean opens his mouth to show him the mashed up mix of food in his mouth. He doesn't get mad, he's beyond used to the weirdness that is Dean Winchester. "Is this what I'm going to be dealing with from now on?" Both boys look at each other for a few seconds and nod. Castiel groans at the thought of being annoyed to death for weeks by these two. They keep being brats until Dean's forced to take his vitamins-there's not a peep in the air after that.
Dean laughs, "Uh yeah. Now, kiss me." he closes his eyes. Castiel looks behind them, Sam is there and quickly motions that he's going to go outside for a bit. "Come on!"
"I didn't know you were here, didn't see your car parked out front-" her tone is one of distraction but curiosity as she looks through a patients chart.
The man leans over to plant a kiss on his forehead before they begin eating. They both eat like animals, like they hadn't eaten in days when in reality it had only been a few short hours since their last meal. Dean was trying to scarf down enough carbs and protein because he thinks that he'll need it, assuming they will be having tons of sex tonight as if somehow his uncles rules suddenly don't exist.
"Listen, sir-" Alex grows nervous, "I don't even know you."
"Cas I don't fit in anywhere-" he says in a way that sounds like he may just cry soon. "I don't know how to talk to anyone- how the hell am I gonna go to college." he shakes his head miserably." Castiel stays silent, listening. "I have no friends Cas-" he adds softly.
The next morning- when Dean wakes up he finds them in the living room drinking coffee. "Morning-" he mumbles before heading for the kitchen. There's a knock at the door and he answers it- "Pastor Jim, what are you doing here? he says, "Haven't seen you since-"
Castiel shrugs, packing up the hot dogs and burgers in foil for his friends - just as he's doing that the small gang of teenagers come outside and they're saying thank you and their goodbyes to both Castiel and the birthday boy. They take the left overs and wave one final time before they are picked up by their parents.
Dean's leaning back against the sofa with is legs spread open and his hands clasped between them with a blush on his cheeks. "No girlfriend-"
"He was in a car accident." John tells Dean, "Right Cas?" the man comes up behind his son and rests his large hands on his shoulders.
Dean starts to panic suddenly, he can tell this because he's pushing off and he's got that look of terror in his eyes. Castiel pulls him closer to his chest, "Baby, you're safe. I'm here."
"So then how the hell are they gonna know I haven't studied?"
Castiel looks up at him, before he can protest Dean is hooking his arm around his neck and lifting him up, all he can say is "When did you get so strong-"
A large hand begins groping his ass once again, rubbing roughly at the center. "
Castiel licks his lips and turns his head, thinking that the teen is poking fun at him. His upper lip has always been an insecurity, though he's never admitted to any such thing.
The teen blushes, biting his bottom lip nervously. "I guess-" his gaze follows the man as he stands up.
"What exactly are you begging for? You say
Dean pushes him away and thinks about it, "Hmm-" loving the look of impatience on the guys face. "Let me tie you up." he says eventually.
Dean steals the box of chocolates because they were for him anyway and indulges in a few of them with a sad far away look in his eyes. The question he's asked about their upcoming trip goes unanswered, eventually what was said is forgotten about and they have a wonderful and very romantic evening.
"Hey!" he huffs as the cashier rings it all up and Bobby pays for the gas separately. They fill up the truck before heading back home.
"What are you doing?"
Castiel opens his eyes slowly, "What-"
he's thinking.
"I know you don't wanna be strict with him but you can't go easy on him all the time- he's gotta shape up. That boy's gonna be a man real soon and he's gotta grow up." Castiel nods. "You too, head to bed- not good for anyone to be walkin' around the house late at night."
Dean leans against him even more, "I always miss you Cas."and that's how they fall asleep the rest of the night, what was left of it anyway. They stay like that until they smell something good in the air, Castiel opens his eyes first to see Bobby in the kitchen making breakfast who in that moment glances up to meet his gaze.
"Ten."
"Nice cat."
Castiel takes the wink too seriously- thinking maybe going for a run is code for outdoor sex. "No- let's go now." he smiles. "Let me just go put on my sneakers." He goes to his room and quickly changes into basketball shorts and slips on his running shoes.
Dean blinks away the tears because this is a fucking touchy subject. "I had a dream-" he somewhat feels very stupid saying it out loud. "About Cas-"
"No offence Cas but you got me a piece of crap-"
Dean sucks in an aroused breath, "Love it when you get rough with me-" and he's pressed against the door frame. "Just like that-" and they kiss sloppily for another few minutes before he's thrown out of the house before things have a chance to escalate further. "Bye!" he yells at the shut door, half laughing.
Castiel's eyes watered in seconds. "I just wanted-"
He did
"You sort of are a drug dealer-" his head rests against the pillow, "Don't your patients get fentanyl or some shit before surgery?" although he may have been wrong about it's use but the fact that he even knows about it at all catches his stepfathers attention.
Castiel smiles, nodding. "I'll say yes to the next guy-" and he said that a little too loud because there's another young guy asking if he wanted a dance. When he looks up at him, he gulps.
"Yea, I don't want dad yelling-" his tone does sound sad, but he knows it's the right thing to do and it's not like he'll never see the dog again. He looks up and hands the leash to the older man. "You can give him away now-"
"It's a good thing I came home when I did-" he gets into bed next to his love, Dean turns over- facing away from him. "Dean, please-"
Castiel broke down in tears. Hands trembling. He asked "This is it then..." but it didn't sound like a question since he already knew the answer.
and it was served in the bedroom. Castiel thought he was finally going to be able to sleep, he needed it badly but the guy had something else in mind. He knew this when he saw the man slipping out of his clothes and giving him that
The teenager buries his face into the older mans neck to cry. "Don't want you to go anywhere-" his plea is muffled.
"But-"
Castiel noticed that he had gotten another cold or maybe it was the same one. "Because I'm taking you home early-" he winks. Dean quickly goes to say bye to his friend before rejoining him by the library exit. They walk out together and Dean skips over the many puddles there was in the parking lot until they reach the car. "Put these in the back seat-"
"Hey Bobby-" he answers. "Yes, I'm here-No he's at work." after a few minutes of chatting about had happened at the hospital his uncle lets him know that he just made bacon, eggs and pancakes- his stomach growls in temptation so he says, "I'll be right there!" after hanging up he slowly makes his way out of the home, being mindful to lock up before going back next door.
He sighs, "Well, we better figure out a way to get some calories in you. I'm-I'm worried about you."
He must have been lost in his thoughts a little too long because when he snaps himself out of it, his uncle is staring at him.
Dean shrugs, "He's smart but he doesn't read as much as me-" he sips on his own caffeine free drink. "-he didn't get enough reading points to go to the party."
Dean reaches out to touch him, "Don't worry, I'll still let you fuck me. I know how much you like it." and kisses him softly.
"We can't be together, I have Cas. You know this." Dean says and it sounds like begging. "Are you going to tell on us?"
Castiel leaves the pie on the counter to let it cool off before cutting into it, he'd have to serve Kevin too, not that he minds- he just wishes tonight was family night. When he returns to his lawn chair outside, they end up forgetting the previous conversation and start talking about their childhoods.
Surprisingly in the morning, his keys are on the nightstand and it's the first thing he sees when he wakes up. Castiel quickly grabs them and goes out to his car after changing into scrubs. There's no time to check on Dean or to grab something to eat, all he really needed was someone to talk to so he drives to go visit Meg at her apartment and he shows up before eight in the morning with two coffees.
Castiel nods and eventually saying, "I'll come get you tomorrow." into the phone when he's heard everything the man had to say to him. He feels completely defeated because he gave in again.
"If he misses, that's fine- because next time there won't be an ambulance save you." Castiel walks out of the room and John just watches him walk away for what might be the last time. He hopes to God it's the final time they ever see him again. If they never do, it'll still be too soon. He goes to the waiting room and to his surprise- finds Dean and Bobby there. "What are you doing here?"
Dean smiled, getting back into bed with him. "Yes sir." Something was about to awaken in him. Who knew what it was but he hoped it was love, and that it would be returned.
"So-" he forces a smile, "How are things at the hospital?"while mentally praying that she forgot everything that happened, but he knows he's not
John Winchester was definitely afraid for his son, especially after serving time himself so he knew his boy was no match for life on the inside. His sentence was two years, so not technically life in prison but you get the picture. He'd tried to convince whoever would listen that the crime his son had committed was his fault, that he told the boy to rob the liquor store but no one would listen.
"Dean please stay in the bed-" A loud clap of thunder crashed nearby, making the boy jump into bed like lightning.
Castiel nods, understanding. "I won't pressure you to take me back. Anyway-" he sighs, "-we leave for our trip tomorrow morning, think you'll be up for it?"
hasn't been doing very well, he's been going through a lot the past few months and watching him go through that- It's painful to watch and not be able to do anything about it." he knows he's being vague- but how can he tell this doctor- this complete stranger about Dean's eating disorder. How seeing Dean in the condition he was in pained him more than he led on.
When Dean awakens the next morning in Castiel's hotel bed he feels... something
In the morning he makes an effort to get up extra early so he can help Dean get ready for school. Once the boy is showered, dressed and has his hair combed- he compliments him greatly. Dean Winchester was completely and utterly adorable with his neatly done hair and his outfit.
Castiel backs away, "I had to ask-" there's a moment of silence. "Go inside, I'll clean this up-" his eyes distastefully examine the mess on the porch.
Dean moans, his eyes fixed upon her. Their encounter was disrupted by a knock on the cars window and he pulls his hand away from between her legs on instinct. The passenger side door flies open and the next thing he knows is he's being yanked out of the car by his step dad. Dean falls onto the floor and Lisa pushes her skirt down, turning red all over from shame.
"Not officially, I guess things just ended when my dad left. Cas told me he'd gone fishin' or huntin' and he just never came back." he wipes under his eyes again. "I doubt he even went on any kind of trip." she asks him to elaborate. "Cause!" Dean whines, "My dad never loved me."
Dean yanks on the older mans dark hair and whispers in his ear, "You're getting fucked tonight, bitch." before letting go and pushing him down against the mattress. Castiel is angry, looking over his shoulder but it turns him on anyway. "What, you can dish it but you can't take it? Fuck you." Castiel closes his eyes in that moment, expecting to get spit on for some reason but it doesn't happen so he reopens his eyes.
Dean grins, showing off his pretty sharp incisors that kinda look like fangs. "later." Castiel sighs and is about to leave the table when the teen grabs onto his wrist, gripping it tightly. "You know, It's been a while..."
"I'll be okay." Jack hugs himself, "But I'm scared-"
"Yea-" a tear rolls down his cheek and Castiel brushes it away with his thumb. "I'll do my best to eat-" Dean stays at the table with Castiel and just enjoys his company until he's finished, then maybe they could watch a movie together.
"I love you too baby, shh-" they sway slightly on their feet, before pulling away from each other. "Tell me what happened-"
"Bobby, I-"
Dean closes his eyes as his step father kisses his neck softly, down to his chest. "Ugh-" he whines sweetly.
"Be careful, fooling around with a grown man is different than messin' round with a boy." Bobby goes to the kitchen, he follows- and his uncle starts making himself a snack.
Dean presses his hand onto his forehead- "You feel a little warm-are you feeling okay?" he studies the older man, "Be honest."
Dean nods, "Sure is." When he was with his dear uncle Bobby- that Texan accent seemed to pop up out of nowhere. He felt good today- he had been the past few days. He had even been eating more at meal times. Here he felt so
"Almost-" he continues pumping until he's completely emptied himself inside, before rolling off the younger man who was reduced to tears. "I needed that-"
The young man almost died, "What do you mean can you see it? Um...I think not?"
"Huh?" Dean glares at the man.
Dean looks down in humiliation, "Are you gonna be with him?" and the question sounds stupid coming from his mouth.
Castiel pulls a chair up to the table that was really only meant for two people and leans into his love, "He let you drink?"
Dean goes to the kitchen to grab a large glass of iced water which he places on his nightstand in case Castiel happens to get thirsty in the middle of the night. The teen climbs under the covers on his side of the bed after placing a throw blanket on top of the older man instead of waking him up and just admires him a while longer. He's never really done this before, taken the time to just
Dean is feeling a little gun shy right now and scoots over as far away as humanly possible or at least until his shoulder is pressing hard against the wall. He does enjoy his time with Castiel but sometimes wishes the guy would sleep in his own bunk.
truth.
and Lisa ignored him as usual. Maybe yesterday never happened. Maybe he dreamed it all.
"Did Castiel know about the abuse?"
"So-" Dean says casually when he returns to Jack, "What do you wanna do?" as expected, he shrugs. "Ever smoke?" Jack shakes his head but his expression looks intrigued so he pulls out the half empty pack of menthol cigarettes he's had hidden in his desk under old school papers. "It doesn't taste good but-"
to you, I wouldn't hit you-"
They get home and unload the groceries, Castiel does all the work himself. Dean is looking into space, his brows furrowed in a complex look. "Dean?" he asks, noticing he hasn't touched his drink. "I got you the chocolate one, you love this one."
"Sweetheart, listen to me-" he cups the teens face in his hands. "I love you and I'm willing to be with you through everything. I want us to be a team, I don't want to hurt you or control you-" there's a beat, "We won't have the same relationship as your parents. I'm not your father and you aren't your mother-"
But most of all, Dean's just happy to have his uncle and his stepfather all under one roof and have the situation be calm for once. There's no fighting, no violence whatsoever- only family and good times. He's got a feeling that everything might turn out just fine in the end-hell- he's got the rest of his life with this nerdy man to figure shit out and there's no one else he would rather do life with.
Once they get home, Castiel carries Dean's back pack for him and guides him to his bedroom. "Stay put-" he goes to the kitchen to grab some medicine. When he comes back he's got that little plastic cup in his hand with that orange liquid that all children seem to despise with passion.
Dean's smile falls instantly, looking extremely hurt and God forbid he start screaming like yesterday. "Okay-" he gives in, sitting on the edge of the bed. "We need to do this quick-"
I hate purgatory, the only way I made it through was because of Cas. Benny too. I didn't get a chance to feel sorry for the fact that Benny was killed, I had to worry about Cas first. To be honest, when I woke up- I thought Cas was dead. I prayed to him, I said I was sorry. I said I was sorry to make myself feel better, thinking that he would hear me. I couldn't live with the guilt, and I'm sure glad I don't have to. He was alive and when I saw
Deanâs eyes flew open, lips parted slightly open. No words were spoken.
"Yea, S'fun-" Dean sighs, now looking up at him.
"I knew you were watching me-" he breathes, "I wanted you to see-"
"Promise it!" he whines.
"You're too old-" Dean snaps at him and he knows its a low blow which is why he instantly wishes he could take it back. Castiel falls silent after he makes that comment and he takes his pillow with him to the living room for his night ahead of him on the couch. He's still angry with him, but Dean is sick right now and even though he yelled- he doesn't have the heart to kick him out of his bed in his condition. How awful he feels right now will be a lesson for him- don't do drugs. He just hopes he takes the lesson for what it is.
"Like what you see?" Castiel smiles when he sees the blush on the boys face and he looks away then, at his surroundings. "How're you doing-" the subject is quickly changes from his muscles to his well being.
Castiel's face is red when he turns around, stroking his cock quickly. "How was that?"
Dean rolled his eyes, typing out âYes assbutt.â
"M'done-" John huffs before getting up off the twin bed. "Tomorrow you're due for a shower-" and he's gone, closing the door behind himself.
Dean eventually ends up buying her a pink one since it seemed to be the most popular kind and they're off to her house but not before stopping on the way for some fast food. It's like a switch had flipped because as soon as Robin begins to chomp down on some fries on the ride home, she looks more lively and the color has returned to her face.
Meg ignores his statement and comes at him with something else, "You know it's my birthday today-"
Dean goes to Castiel's house, he starts to be come obsessed.
"Mmmmmm-" he moans, "-just like that baby-" he loves the feeling of Dean's cock rubbing up against his stomach, having his dick inside him right now was just a bonus, "-good fucking boy-" his hand finds it's way into the teens light brown hair and he pulls on it gently.
There's a stack of four waffles on a plate- the kind that go in the toaster of course because he can't cook. There's eggs too- they're scrambled and almost burnt but it smells amazing. He can't remember the last time he ate, probably the quick bite he had for lunch yesterday at the hospital.
Crazily enough, he ends up singing along to that girly rock song he'd heard on the radio when he was hanging out with his friend.
"At night-" Dean's still hugging his arm, "-you keep saying
"Nothing." Castiel sighs, "I have to go back to work." Before he can leave the crying teenager pulls on his arm to keep him in the room. "Dean, let go."
to be sleeping. Actually, his limited vocabulary has expanded tremendously since his fathers friend moved in.
"Do we have a winner?"
"I jacked off a lot-" he admits, arousal dripping from every breath he takes. "I wanted it so
âOkay...I just-â a tear rolled down Castielâs puffy cheeks, âI thought he would change for me.â
Dean looks up, "But then you'll leave-"
Dean finally lets go of the dogs leash for the first time since he fell in love with him, and wraps both of his arms around the older mans neck. "Please don't leave-" he begs between sobs, "You can't leave-"
He shrugged. âItâs fine baby. Iâm glad youâre here. I- I enjoyed last night.â
Dean only looked at him and it didn't hit until Cas was an inch from his face with his eyes closed. "Cas no." He held the boys shoulders to keep him for getting any closer.
"So, anything kinky you like doing with a girl?" Dean asks, "Come on...tell me."
The teen nods all too well, "Think me and Cas can work it out?-" and he's asking for his honest opinion.
is bringing a new type of spark to their relationship and a new understanding for each other.
Bobby shrugs, "She's been wantin' to tie me down for a long time-"
Did that surprise anyone? Not really but they hoped things could have worked out for today. They all hoped that Dean could get himself through this, especially Castiel.
Castiel nods knowingly, because even he doesn't like when his name is brought up too often. "I'll talk to him-" and he climbs into bed, handing him a plate with the sandwich. While the teen eats slowly at his side, nestled in against him, it raises a question. "Surprised he hasn't come over and dragged you back home-"
"Oh my-" her eyes roll back in her head before her head hits the couch pillow behind her. "Oh my God you do it so good-"
Dean swallows again, his lips feel all sticky and gross because his face always gets so damn red and puffy when he cries. "Because I'm always gonna need you to be my-" he blinks, tears fall. "I'm always gonna need you to be my friggin' dad-"
boy. "-so young."
"What-" he squints at the older man. "No-"
"What do you think." Dean says in a frozen tone, stepping into the shower- "Met a guy. He was really nice to me." he shampoos his short brown hair.
"Ughhh-" he whines loudly in frustration.
After a minute of ringing the doorbell he almost turned around to leave when the door suddenly flew open and a guy who wasnât Dean stood before him. â Can I help you? â
When they're sitting down at the diner for lunch as usual Castiel asks him, "Do you want to make some extra money?" in that moment their food arrives and they dig in, continuing the conversation. "Since I'm rarely home I was thinking about giving you a key to the house, you can come over and take out the trash for me, laundry, clean-" Castiel takes a bite of his sandwich, "-stuff like that."
He chuckles, "If I hadn't had you as a roommate I think I'd probably still be a virgin-"
When he wakes up he sees that Dean's already out of bed- he goes to the bathroom to splash some water on his face so he can fully wake up. When he opens the door- the sight before him does just that. "What are you doing?"
Dean bites his bottom lip, responding with a "Yes please-" in the softest voice.
"She's here. She's been in bed the last few days."
"Alright, Dean. Before you make love to her-" he pulls out the keys to the car out from his jeans pocket. He throws them at Dean.
Dean's biting his lip hard because he's horny now, it's overpowering his fear. "Ugh-" his hips start thrusting back and forth, humping the mattress. "Ugh-"
He shakes his head, "Hell no- think he was just usin' Cas. We didn't have a lot of money and Cas- well you know." She nods. "Think my dad saw him and dollar signs popped up in his eyes-" he smiles sadly, feeling sorry for Castiel at having being used by his father.
They both walk into their home and Dean groans in relief, "Home sweet home-" he kicks off his boots, "I'm never going outside again-"
"Did you do any schoolwork today?"
"Cas-" he says brokenly and his step dad automatically comes to his aid.
The principle sighs, "I don't care where he is. Honestly, Mr. Novak. I've called you in because of Dean's remarkable grades."
"Here you go-" he hands the teen a small goody bag.
Castiel puts the car in drive again and heads down the road to drop him off at his uncles. "I'll pick you up for church tomorrow, then we'll head out." Dean nods and grabs his stuff from the trunk before running up the porch steps. Castiel honks at him and Dean rolls his eyes before he heads in.
"You should go home, I don't want to do anything with that woman-" he crosses his arms at his chest and continues watching the show he doesn't really like, he'd change the channel but Dean's got the remote.
"Tell me about it." Dean eats his his meal without saying another word. Around seven, Castiel gets up from the sofa first- the movie they had been watching made him even more exhausted. Why would he choose
John shrugs, "Sure, give me some cash and I'll never bother you again. Either of you."
for sleeping with another man.
Castiel Novak has given Dean Winchester butterflies for the first time in his life and they both had mistaken the feeling for a stomach ache. They hold hands all the way to the car, which wasn't even parked that far to begin with but Dean had reached for Castiel's hand and he wasn't going to turn it down for anything.
"I can't look at you now?" Castiel smiles, reaching over for his hand but Dean pulls away.
Castiel's heart gives a hard thud, "She's lucky."
"Mornin'-" he smiles before clumsily making his way to the front seat and looking everything but graceful.
"This your room now?" he says casually, seeing clothes in the closet he knows aren't Castiel's. Then, he sees it- Castiel's winter coat in the midst of his son's clothing. "You're sharing the room?" his father actually looks confused, his jealous suspicious turned out to be true. "He's fucking you?" his voice angry enough to make his son flinch at the tone.
Dean drives the speed limit, when they get to the hospital he parks the car and he pokes Castiel. "We're here. Wake up."
Dean's looking up at him with worry in his eyes, "I got a boner when she was sitting on me, doesn't that piss you off?"
"I don't know why he does-" his tone was barely audible.
"Yes baby-" the sound of his balls slapping the teens plump ass was loud in the quiet room, "-what do you wanna tell daddy-"
âI wouldnât leave you. Not after a blowjob like that.â he whispered. Smirking.
Castiel not a bad man at all and wants to fulfill Bobby's wishes by not engaging in anything of
Castiel quickly comes close but not
Castie's eyes close- "Harder." he orders and he does. When his face starts to get a little flushed Dean lets go. Castiel moans softly.
Dinner went extremely well, Castiel let loose and was bickering away with Bobby over something stupid. The topic was cars and Bobby had been hounding Castiel to get something replaced and he disagreed with the need to do so. So there they were, arguing lightly over a topic that Castiel had no knowledge of but pretending like he somehow knew exactly what he was going on about.
"You happy here?"
he wipes at his eyes again as he walks home. Once he makes it through the screen door he's cursing up a storm, and in his room he begins to kick at everything in sight. "Fucking bitch!" he kicks at his trashcan. "It's all your fault-" he falls on his bed, crying angrily.
John walks in and grabs a slice of the pie before sitting down on the couch with his boyfriend on one side of him and his pretty boy on the other. The night had been a nice one up until he'd gotten home and now there was no laughter to speak of, only the sound of the mans loud chewing.
Dean's surprised by how insecure he sounds now. "I love you-" he whispers. "-I'm such a fuck up."
"He will-" Dean promises. "I'll tell him I need to get away from everything. I'll ask him to come with us but he won't be able to sice he's getting a lot of business lately-"
Once he's gotten to the high school he walks into the principles office and sees Dean there, waving his fingers at him as a hello. He has a smug look on his face. That smug look is wiped off his face when the principle asks, "So, John Winchester is not in the picture?"
Dean whines in his sleep, "Goodnight, Dean. I love you." he says to the sleeping boy and vows to never leave him alone again.
"Bobby saw me-" he looks down at his lips- "On the porch."
Castiel shakes him roughly, "No you won't."
"You gotta practice-" Sam's a horrible influence. "It'll come out some day." Dean nods, confused. "Should we sleep or-"
Castiel smiles again, "You're not going to hurt yourself- besides, your cherry's already popped."
The three Winchesters look up to see the guard, "That's for me-" Dean smiles, tears threatening to fall but holds them back for his brother. "Take care, yea?"
Castiel sighed, watching the guy walk off towards the exist. Imagining thing's in his head. No one was standing in line so he had some time to kill, He leaned against the register before noticing the Blackberry infront of him. " Shit. "
Bobby nods, taking a sip of his beer. "Now he's got me."
Castiel shakes his head, "I'm pissed but we're not over and you'll have to make it up to me, of course."
He soon hears Dean's basketball bouncing off the garage door and Castiel continues eating once he knows he ran outside to go play. After he has finished collecting the dishes and putting them in the sink to wash for later he goes to the front door, opening it. Dean's there, pajama bottoms and barefoot, playing with his basketball. It's only eleven in the morning and the kid is already sweating like you wouldn't believe.
"Can't you come in?" Dean peeks through the curtain of the dressing room. An employee comes by and lets them know the out dated rule of
Dean's just so used to his uncle being so strong and being the backbone of the whole family. Even if Bobby wasn't a
Dean shakes his head. "I'm gonna fall-"
Castiel mutters, "So fucking gorgeous-" while cupping the teens face in his hands and kissing him again.
It must have been the middle of the night when he's awoken by a sound, after opening his eyes to the darkness he can hear something kind of wet in the silence of the cell. Dean listens to it for a while, wondering what the sound was until a soft groan is heard above him and realizes that his cell mate was jacking off. He tries to stay quiet, even tries to fall back asleep since he's going to have to get used to this.
Dean sits up completely and places his hands on the mans hips to give him pause. "Cas, wait-" he struggles a little, his bunk mate is forcing him down onto the paper thin mattress. "Can we just-" his neck is being kissed roughly. "Can't we just talk a bit-"
Dean nods insecurely, inhaling the mans musky scent deeply into his lungs. "Yea-"
"Uh-"
"You actually came-" he's stunned when his eyes land on the dirty mechanic.
Meg agrees, "Thank you for dinner, looks good."
When Castiel gets home half an hour later, the boy had stopped crying and he was clueless about anything that had taken place.Â Regardless of how exhausted he is from the long week and the fun late night out with his coworkers, he still manages to peek into the boys room to check on him.
"You failed to mention that to me-"
"So what the fuck am I gonna do this year?"
The nurse leans back in her chair and looks up at him with a look she knows will get her truth, "Your car is brand new, and expensive-no way it's giving you trouble." her arms are crossed at her chest.
He's so preoccupied with the task at hand he doesn't realize when his uncle calls him in for lunch until he hears a whistle from afar and he cuts the lawn mower. "Yea!" he shouts at him, the sun high in the sky makes him squint as he looks over at the bearded man standing on the porch.
A thick long finger runs up the eleven year old's thighs to then begin rubbing between that special place that leads to his virgin hole. He whines constantly at the weird intrusion, although there's no pain it's still very strange to feel something
Working life at the diner had been uneventful aside from Lisa's yoga in the break room and his uncle coming to see him sometimes during lunch, he raved about the cheeseburgers. Though today, Castiel was here and he knew it was to pick him up to haul his white ass to therapy.
Castiel runs his hand through the hair on the back of the teens head, "I don't care what my coworkers think about us. Besides, I'm not the only doctor whose with someone younger than they are-"
"That's my nephew, Dean-" Bobby says before continuing their conversation and he's pissed that he isn't the center of attention.
Dean closes the only browser open to see that his wallpaper had been changed to a picture of them at the park. He smiles sadly because the picture was so old and he was merely twelve years old at that point. "Damn you, Cas-" his eyes sting with tears before closing the computer and it's obvious that the guy deserves a blowjob.
"Yea!" he nods frantically with excitement. "I wanna play!"
It's just so fucking insane how beautiful his own flesh and blood is, sometimes he thinks that maybe he should have given his boy a little
"Sorry-" he cleans himself up with a napkin, "-boy I've heard ya sing before and ya can't sing worth a damn." he doesn't mean to be insulting, from what he's heard he thinks he's in the right.
Both Castiel and Bobby heard the gun shot- it had been the loudest thing to come through the night. "Dean!" Castiel shouts, "What are you doing! Who is that-" he stops dead next to Dean. "What-" John laughs, he's pressing his hand onto his gunshot wound to try and stop the bleeding. He's looking more and more delirious with every passing second. "What are you doing here!" he screams at the man before his eyes roll back and he's out.
"Sure-" Castiel doesn't hug back, just pats him on the head before he goes to his room. Although he doesn't feel like cooking, he gets started on dinner- something easy. He ends up making chicken burgers for three, along with fries. "Dean, John-" he calls out, "-dinner's ready."
Dean smiles, "Nah-"
"Soup." he says coldly. "For Dean, he's been sick."
"I want my mom-" he complains.
Robin shivers, clearly scared too. "Dean-" and he's kissing her again, softly and so sweetly. "Hmmm-" she whines, pushing him off her. "Dean, what about Cas-"
Bobby shrugs before getting up from the couch, "It's a nice night to roast some dogs, ain't it?" Both his guests nod in agreement and they follow Bobby outside, they help him set up the old grill- the flames make the night seem warmer than it is. The hot dogs are on the grill, sizzling up a storm in the silence of the night.
"Like your presents?" the deep voice calls from behind him.
"Shhh-" the older man plants kisses and gentle kitten licks on the soft flesh of his thighs. "You don't have to say anything-"
Bobby couldn't believe this, sure he'd had his suspicions in the past but that's all they were and never expected that his nephew would be involved with an older man, and that wasn't even the worst part- the worst part was that he was involved with his step father. It wasn't official, he wasn't Dean's real step father- the guy wasn't married to one of his parents in order to earn that title but that's what he was. If he liked it or not, he was the teenagers step father because he took care of him since he had been just a boy.
Castiel walks around the truck once to make sure it's in tact, mostly focusing on checking the tires. "What were you doing here?" the question is asked mindlessly
"Cas-" Dean whines, biting his lip. "Stop-" he'd already been hard in his jeans from the dirty magazine. Although he was
Castiel and John don't see each other for a while and Castiel is more than fine with that- although he's been extremely lonely, he does not want to break up a family so he cuts his loses and doesn't go over on Sundays anymore. He'd missed about three games in a row.
"Oh please-" Bobby huffs, "I was only messin' with the boy."
about the birds and the bees.
"Really? Why aren't you bigger-" when he sees the look on Dean's face he knew he put his foot in his mouth. "I'm sorry. Mother's calling me-I'll see you tomorrow. Same time?" Dean hides his shame as they say their goodbyes and wish each other a good night.
"Why are you so emotional, baby?" he laughs and it earns him a soft punch to the arm. "I'm sorry baby- sorry-" he gets punched again. "So I can never call you-that?"
Castiel seems more lively again, telling jokes that aren't funny whatsoever and even holding his hand from across the kitchen table. They both would be lying if they weren't thinking about running down the hall to the bedroom in order to get something going in bed. Yet, sexual activities are probably not the best idea right about now.
Castiel laughs harshly, "Excuse me,Â we?"Â  They both nod in response and Dean quickly moves to pull off his shirt. "Hey! Keep your shirt on!" he hisses, Sam takes off his shirt too. "Both of you, stop it!" but it's too late, before his brain can process- they're fully undressed except for underwear.
"But Cas-"
âFuck you. I thought you wanted me and only me. Your words remember!â
The teen sighs longingly, "Does it make me bad if I say that I want Cas and a girlfriend?" silence. "I'm curious about girls, Bobby. But I love Cas-"
Dean watched the interaction between Castiel and the young cashier, smiling and lightly flirting with eachother. He rolled his eyes.
Dean turns to look at him, "I figured." is all he says. The sun lowers even more over the horizon, he takes out his phone and takes a few pictures of the beautiful fiery blood orange sky and then he takes a picture of his step father-he looks so handsome in his navy blue polo shirt and hair messy off to the side. "Can't believe this is our first trip together-"
Castiel seems to be in a bad mood as they have a conversation in hushed tones regardless if they are even aware that Dean is watching them. They talk among themselves like it's some big secret until John gets pissed and leaves the house because he's supposedly going to the shop to
Derek lightly punches him on the shoulder before getting into his car and driving off. His eyes look over but his step father was already inside the home and the porch light had been shut off.
"Sure baby-"
A few weeks later. Dean had been eating well and sleeping through the night without issue. Bobby didn't mind that he and Castiel shared the bed now - it seemed to help him.
Robin hugs him tightly from behind while pressing a bunch of kisses on his cheek, "I know but we couldn't all come over that day-" finally she releases her pink faced friend and sits on his lap just because.
Make no mistake, Dean Winchester is beyond gorgeous but there's days where Castiel misses that chubby face that was there years ago.
The boy quickly sits up because he just got busted, "What's happening?" he gulps, "I heard yelling-" a moment of silence, "Your door was locked-" their eyes meet. "Is dad get drunk again?"
"Well. Goodnight, then." Dean rolls to his side, facing away from the man.
"Ugh-" Dean moans softly, his eyes still shut tightly. "Daddy-"
"Where?"
"Ugh-" Dean moans softly, desperately. His legs are trembling and Castiel knows he's close so he stops and moves in between his legs, spreading them open. "Ughh shit-" he braces himself for what's to come, his mouth hanging open as the thick lubed cock presses against his hole, pushing inside all the way. "Ugh-" he chokes out.
"How did that go? Bobby told me he was meeting you tonight." he sounds disinterested.
"Are you mad at me?" Dean quickly asks, still panting. "I'm sorry-"
"I have to go-" his eyes are those of pure terror. "I can't hold it-" and right then he does, instead of having a full orgasm because he's just too young for that.
The only thing that keeps him going back to school is the fact that his stepfather and uncle believe in him so damn much, otherwise he probably would have quit and ended up working at some shady shop eventually.
"Keep this up and I'm gonna hate you too Cas." Dean yanks off the flannel he had over his shirt and goes to his room. Castiel sighs heavily.
These days it seems like every one is either pregnant or getting married and he's just
"Uber." Dean stumbles and falls to his knees, he looks up and starts pawing at Castiels belt. "Let me suck your dick-s-so you won't be mad anymore-"
"I'd spank you." Castiel kisses him again, "But I know you won't hurt me." Dean smiles and spends the whole ride back to the Bobby's looking at the ring on his left middle finger. It's their
"But how-" he holds up his bad arm, luckily his arm hadn't been broken just hurt.
Castiel smiles weakly, now running his fingers through the teens sweaty hair. "Guess I missed you-" Dean listens, tracing circles and pulling lightly on the mans chest hair. "Dean, those few years you rejected me- they weren't easy on me." Dean nods, still playing with Castiel's chest hair. "I was so lonely-" he adds, now he looks up into blue eyes. "I contemplated being with someone else-"
Castiel breathes in and out slowly, he's really trying not to do something he would regret- "Don't get me in trouble."
âCan I fuck you?â Castiel said bravely. He didnât even know if topping would be something he is interested in but this man was giving him all sorts of feelings.
"I'll pass, I like to eat dinner before midnight." he shrugs, "S'okay." swallowing another spoonful. "I'm almost done."
done much- his bucket list would probably run ten pages long of all the things he'd love to do before he died. "Love it-" he says, now helping with the final few grocery bags.
The guy shrugs, "Your loss."
, they both stumble up front towards the cash register and his spark plugs are ringed up. Brady hands him the receipt, "I'll just pretend you paid for these, alright?" Dean nods, box in hand. "Later, Winchester."
Sam nods, right then a big looking guard comes out from two double doors. "Dean Winchester-" he's holding up a clipboard.
me?" his voice is getting angry, "See if I lost weight again?" the man under him swallows, looking away. "You son of a bitch-" and he stands, pushing the man back which causes the chair to fall backwards.
"Bobby!" Dean whines in anger and quickly makes his way into the home, squatting down next to his
Castiel sighs heavily, guilty. "I'm so sorry baby, I'm- I'm so stupid."
Dean visibly relaxes, "Shit, You scared me." The rest of the drive is quiet, Dean kept turning on the radio to the classic rock station and Castiel kept changing the station to christian rock. "So, Castiel-" the older man looks over at him in wonder at the mention of his full name. "-is that your real name? I've never heard a name like that before. I always wanted to know about your name but I kept forgetting to ask-"
Meanwhile he's getting his hole rubbed, Castiel presses soft kisses to the side of his face. "You gonna let me fuck you?" Dean's shoulders shrug, "Well, I'm going to anyway. You owe me for the gifts-"
way. "Are you okay now?-" Dean nods, because he had been doing better with food. "And your step dad, you mean Cas?" he nods again. "Uh-"
"Dean-" the man looks like he might cry. "Why are you making fun of me-"
"I wish we could stay here forever-" he swallows the knot in his throat. "I'm so happy when we can be ourselves."
Castiel swallows, "Sure-" then he looks at Dean again. "Why can't we have sex?"
"Wow, all yours?" she asks as they walk up the porch steps, side by side.
"Stop it-" he tells himself and decides to focus his eyes on the beautiful full moon above him. All he can think about is how can't sit out here with Castiel, cuddled together under the moonlight. It'd be romantic- it's been a while since they've had sex and even longer since they did anything romantic for each other. He stays outside so long that Castiel comes looking for him- "Hey-" he hides the beer can between his legs.
to you?"
"Are you okay?" he looks closely into Dean's eyes, pupils are fine. "Why are you acting this way-"
going to talk to the therapist today." that's all he says before speeding away, off to
"You wouldn't marry me?" Castiel asks and the teen shrugs. "You don't love me enough to marry me?" he teases, kissing his wet hair.
Castiel walks in with a chart and he's pleased to see that he's finally awake. "Hey-" he comes close to the bed, stroking the boys cheek with the back of his fingers for a few seconds. "Feeling okay?"
"Mmm, what is it baby-" Castiel pulls Dean's shirt off, kissing down his bare freckled chest- going lower, he unbuttons his jeans- tugging them down.
Castiel watches him for a moment, feeling guilty himself for maybe being too harsh. "Get up-" he orders, Dean gets up. "Wipe your face." Dean wipes his face. "Now-" he smiles at the boy, who now smiles back thinking they're okay. "-now you can go home."
"What if I don't want to?" Castiel's voice is deep but relaxed.
John nods, running a hand down his face. "You fell asleep-" he opens the fridge and makes himself a sandwich. "Good for nothin', just like Mary-" after the comment is made, he leaves for the bedroom.
While they're in the shower, he stands behind Dean so he can wash his lengthy hair off with shampoo. It wasn't extremely long, but it was long enough to make Castiel want to cut it. "You like this, don't you?" he asks, being careful not to get shampoo in the teens eyes. Dean just lets him lather his hair, his head lolling back onto the strong chest behind him.
"But I'm not a baby-" Dean defends himself awkwardly, "-and I'm
Dean nods, breathing in and out of his mouth slowly. "Mmmm-" he hums, his eyes focused on the older man above him.
The moment the drivers side door opens, he says- "How come you're such a friggin' morning person?"
? "Ughh-" another moan escapes him, "Ughh-" then another. "Mmm-"
He caresses the boys face roughly, "Think about it-" before climbing up to the top bunk.
"Are you kidding me?" Dean whines in the most childish voice.
"You're so gay for me, dude-"
It's dark out- but the figure stands out anyway. Dean ignores it- he pushes the lawn mower and leaves it by the side of the porch. He looks around where he saw it- it's gone.
"Bobby." Dean smiles, "You spanked me once, and times were different then- and you never beat me."
Bobby nods, "I don't either-"
"What are ya two fightin' about now?" Bobby looks at them, keys in hand already.
Bobby runs a hand down his face, "The hospital called-" and his first reaction is that maybe something happened to Castiel. "-they think they found his body-" his face is pale and it's freaking him out.
Ash has met his friends stepfather before, maybe once or twice but the interactions were so brief he hadn't really noticed the blue eyes. Surely he would bring it up to Dean, if they got a moment alone without Bobby.
Eventually the day comes to lay John Winchester to rest. The three of them sat in the living room- wearing black, late one morning. Dean held the ashes on his lap.
His prayers were empty, with no faith. Maybe he took comfort that maybe someone would listen yet he doubted it.
Castiel nods, "You're pretty smart." he comments. "Not many eleven years old would show much interest in the water cycle." the comment makes the boy blush and he noticed it because his ears were red. "You just started middle school, sixth grade right?" the boy nods. "Any electives?"
Dean looks up at him, "Are you mad that I'm here-" his voice is soft and he takes the imaginary implied cue to dust the bedspread of all the crumbs he'd made while eating.
Castiel struggles underneath his body, tries closing his legs but their hooked between strong arms. "Ughhh-" he whimpers in agony. It doesn't hurt all that much, but he's pissed because he hadn't wanted to have sex in the first place. Especially not after what John did last time and yet here he was, doing it all over again.
"So what- you wanting to marry me was a friggin' lie?" Dean crosses his arms at his chest. "Answer me." Castiel hasn't opened his mouth before- "You're a coward."
Castiel looks at him, giving him an unintentional bitch face. Or at least that's how he took it. "Yea." he says.
It was completely dark now in the world and a little scary, so Dean holds onto Castiel's hand all the way back to the car. On the drive home, neither say a word about Mary Winchester or her
Sam elbows him, "Why are you so mean? He's cool."
The teen snorts, "Cas- I may like to get fucked but please don't insult me like that. I like dick but I'm not that gay." He laughs, "Fuckin' Bobby- think you know a guy. Never thought he'd be into getting his nails done."
Dean couldn't deal with him tonight, he had someone waiting on him so he just waved the boy off and walked away. Phone safe in his pocket this time.
Unfortunately Dean fell asleep again before he could respond to the question and Castiel can't seem to help himself and ends up kissing the boys forehead before leaving the room.
Castiel looks at him with a worried expression, "What wrong baby?"
Dean pushes the subject, "-you didn't like me at first, did you?"
Castiel licks his lips before blinking, snapping himself out of what he'd been thinking in his mind because it was totally and completely wrong. He should be ashamed of himself for thinking such a thing and there was no way his thoughts would become reality. Not with Dean Winchester who is just a child- no matter how cute or sweet he was, nothing could ever happen.
"That's a damn shame." Dean looks down at his fingernails casually, as if he was checking the manicure he never got- or never has gotten. "Brady-" he whispers, "I always hated that friggin' smile on your face-"
In no time at all the books on the desk are stacked in alphabetical order and loose papers are neatly put into a pile with a pen placed on top so that the ceiling fan doesn't blow any of them away.
"Well, I'm not-" Castiel smiles, "I got you out of it." it dawns on him that they aren't together right now. "Had you-"
"You're hilarious-" he reaches behind the teen and spanks his bottom. "-let's get going." as he walks down the hall he smiles to himself with Dean following close behind.
Castiel downs the rest of his beer before grabbing Dean's hand and making a run for it. Only until they're outside of the bar, do they realize that they didn't pay for their drinks but it didn't matter anymore. It's only half the reason why they were running down the street, looking like complete fools.
By Twelve, Dean really loved spending time with his step dad. Castiel was
After all Castiel
again, "- and your father- those lines tend to blur at times."
San purses his lips, trying not to laugh.
Dean gulps, "N-No."
"Dean...I've never sucked dic-" Castiel shut up as Dean was now slapping his cheek lightly with his cock.
The boy looks up at him once more and admits, "I like hanging out with you-"
"Cut the attitude-" he orders and her mouth falls open.
The boy pulled away and huffed. " You sound like a beast or something you should take something for your anger. " he shrugged, proceeding now to delete some of Dean's 'hookup' buddies from the contact list.
The revelation hits him instantly, "That's why you were getting into fights at school-" Dean nods again.
"All it takes is one time. I'm going to ask you again, did you have sex with her?"
Dean bit his neck softly, getting a quiet and unsure moan out of the boys throat. "You taste good." He grabbed the boys wrist and placed the trembling hand to his growing bulge, "That's what you do to me. Especially right now."
Dean's voice sounds all stuffy from crying, "Cas gets these wrinkles at the corners of his eyes when he smiles-" there's fondness in his words. "How am I gonna handle never seeing that again?"
Eventually Robin leads him to the employee bathroom where she runs his hands under cold water, he hisses at the burn. "Who'd you fight?" she asks, knowingly. "Was it that Brady guy?" he nods, "Dean!" she scolds him, it has no affect on him though, not right now. "You better stop getting into trouble, you've already been arrested once- next time you won't be so lucky."
"I don't want you to get bored of me." he admits, squeezing his hand. Dean almost laughs at his statement. "I'm serious, Dean." he looks at the teen in the eyes. "No one knows you like I do- you tend to get bored."
The mechanic huffs a soft laugh after he's already come and his movements slow down behind his younger lover. "So you uh, had a female orgasm?" it's a joke, or it's meant to be taken as such.
his dad does with him.
On his way to the house to check on Dean's well-being he stops by the grocery store to pick up some supplies and food for him. It has been a while since the last time he dropped off the essentials- he's come to know that Dean uses up a lot of toiler paper and paper towels for some reason. Tissues too. On a side note, It's remarkable how many bags of chips he can eat in a week.
The ladies are chatting among themselves and walking around the home like it's a damn hotel lobby while Castiel prepares the refreshments. Dean doesn't like it at all, every damn chick in here reeks of repressed sexual tension. Not to mention their heels clicking and clacking with every step they take. He came here thinking he'd become the center of attention, but he's not.
"Ughh, yea-" Dean bites his lip, eyes fixated above him on his step fathers. "So fucking good-" the pace is slow, agonizingly slow but it allows them to feel and discover new sensations they hadn't experienced before. His hands run up and down his back, lightly scratching the sweaty flesh of the older man above him as his nails drag down. "I love you-"
"I did say that, you're right." when the teen scoots over until their thighs touch he says, "I just want you all to myself baby-" he wraps an arm around him. "I don't like the idea of some woman all over you-" Dean looks up at him, Castiel presses kisses to the side of his neck. "I only want my lips on you-" he continues kissing, his lips making little noises with every kiss. "I love you baby-"
Only after getting consent does Castiel lean over and places the softest kiss on that flushed pink cheek, "Muah-" then another and another. When he pulls away, that's when he sees just how many freckles this boy has on his beautiful face. Literally, they were
"Castiel-" he says, full of confusion because
Dean talks to the manager and explained the situation, he didn't care and just wished him luck with everything.
Castiel could feel something really hard poking him in the side. " What the hell is that? "
"Live off your savings of course-" he leans up to kiss the man a few times on his dry lips. "You know I'm just messin' with you, Cas-" then sighs longingly because their kisses were always breathtaking.
"Mmm-" he hums. John grips his dark hair roughly between his fingers and forces him down on his cock. Castiel gags a bit but manages to pull through, swallowing it all down when he comes. When they movie is over, Castiel couldn't say what happened during since he had his face buried in his boyfriends lap.
"Ya messed it up huh-" Bobby laughs.
Dean nods, nibbling on his lip and the line is silent for a few dozen seconds. "Dad dropped me off at Sam's house-"
He blushes, "Fucking Bobby let me drink."
Castiel pulls away, "So fuckin' sweet and soft-" he comments because the teen is so gentle and shy, like a virgin girl. "I'd fuck you every night and morning-" and he's got to pull himself away completely in order to keep himself from just fucking this boy right then and there.
Castiel had explained the situation they found themselves in- some of it wasn't their fault but on the other end- even if school hadn't closed it's doors for the rest of the year, he might have not made it to class every single day. Dean's had a tough year, getting into fights- when it wasn't his behavior it was his health. Lucky for him, Dean's principle was understanding- more so now once she knew what he was going through privately at home.
Bobby rolls his eyes, "Boy just get the heck outta here- let me eat in peace."
"Cas-" he tries but he's cut off as he's walked to his classroom. "Cas please, talk to me." he holds onto the older mans arm.
"No!" Dean yells right in his ear, hugging his left arm to his body protectively and wincing at the sharp pain shooting up and down.
. Both boys come barging in loudly into the kitchen, "Sit down." he says, mostly to Dean because Sam doesn't need to be told to eat. During breakfast, Dean keeps whispering things into Sam's ear that he can't make out- it makes him laugh every time. "What's so funny?" Castiel asks the tan boy.
The pair hadn't seen each other in days, not until Monday night when Dean knew that it was his stepfathers book club night. It was beyond lame but it's always fun to torture him, maybe embarrass him a little bit or a lot, he hadn't quite decided just yet. He walks up the porch steps and knocks, just to be polite.
Dean thinks about it, images of Castiel fucking that chick on that couch come flooding in and it's weird because the lady is pretty hot. Against his better judgement, his teenage body full of hormones has him fattening up in his jeans. "Where are the roaches?" the question suddenly comes to him too, not seeing his friend with the box in his hands.
Dean nods sadly, "Yea- he tried it once but he couldn't-" he clears his throat. "-didn't fit." Castiel wipes a stray tear from Dean's face. "But you, he really-"
"Fair enough-" is all that's said before carrying the teen to his bedroom, dropping him onto the bed.
"That's all-" Dean says, "I'm done." he looks up at him.
"Nurse-" he looks at the door, "-says low potassium can k-" Castiel has to find that nurse and tear her a new one because why in the hell would she scare him like that.
Castiel backs off and resumes eating his own slice of pie, he's got his fork in his right hand as he eats and his cellphone is in his left hand- he's scrolling. "I make good pie." he says out of nowhere.
By then, the teen has dried off his tears and pulls on a fresh pair of khakis. "Am I okay?" he asks softly as they walk slowly back to their cell, a large arm wrapped around his neck possessively. He should be scared but he's actually feeling taken care of for once, protected even. "I hurt really bad inside-"
"Forgot." Castiel says, taking almost half the hot dog in his mouth as he takes a large bite.
Clearly he must have taken too long because Dean comes looking for him, Castiel turns around, "Dean?" he's got a lit candle in hand which he sets on the dresser. "I was coming back-"
There's a knock at the door which they both can clearly see that it's Castiel. Bobby opens the door in no time at all, "He really get lost or is he lyin'-"
Dean gulps, "Uh, no. Ash did-"
Castiel decided to be friendly no matter how jealous he was of this recent guy.  â You can tell me about him. Was he a good guy? â
Bobby simply takes over, finishing up the job for his nephew. "Almost done here, why don't ya go inside and eat-"
He takes another look at the teenager beside him, "Yes." and he didn't lie.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut to keep the tears from falling and tries his best to keep from shaking. It feels like hes saying goodbye. Hes afraid that hes dying despite his test results saying hes completely fine. After a few hours, he awoke and the lamp on the nightstand was on- he looks over and sees Castiel looking through his family photo album. It confused him, but the fact that he didn't remember falling asleep confused him more. "Cas?"
"You love me-" Dean says mindlessly and puts on his step fathers glasses before opening up the book he was reading to find out what it's about. When the plate of eggs is set in front of him he sets the book aside and digs in. "Mm-"
Dean must have drove for what felt like hours, the night grew darker than it had been. Lightning occasionally lighting up the sky in colors of blue and green. He looked over to see Castiel looking out of the passenger window, a hint of a smile on his lips. "I love storms." he whispered so quietly he didn't know if he imagined it or not.
Castiel hovers over Dean's back now, he laughs softly in his ear. "
Castiel nods, sitting down on the black leather couch. "How much?" he asks, wallet already in his hand.
Soon it turns into an all out war and pumpkin guts and seeds were being flung everywhere. They hadn't noticed the mess until the front door slams shut and it has Dean saying
Castiel blinks, "Okay." he pays for their items and they both walk to his car, Dean is so helpful and helps Castiel load everything into the car and bring everything into the house once they arrive. Dean was indeed a very good kid, the older he got the more aware he was of things that needed to be done around the house. He started mowing the lawn at Fourteen without being told to do so, he started taking out the trash on his own too at Fifteen. What really shocked him was when he woke up one Saturday morning to find Dean washing his car. The day he sees him changing his oil, he will lose it.
Castiel could see that Dean had started crying and just wanted to be left alone for a while so he lets him be. He keeps a close eye on the boy while he sits and drinks his coffee in peace. It was peaceful aside from the fact that his phone kept buzzing non stop in his pants. He'd checked his phone earlier and must have had over fifty missed calls from John and rightfully so, he did sort of kidnap his son.
"Whore-" Dean laughs before doing it yet again, closer to his dick and his step father moans every single time. "Ew you freak-" Castiel's nostrils flare up like he's both angry and turned on. "What would you do if you weren't tied up?" he wonders.
" I don't expect everyone to be like me, or everyone to have the same morals but- "
"I don't know why you can't take a shit in front of me-" there's no humor there, only annoyance because he's hungry and exhausted. "Everybody poops, Cas-" and he's already walking off, towards the exit doors with his stepfather rushing to catch up with their bags in tow.
"Shut up, Cas-" the teen grinds down against Castiel's crotch but his movements are messy and uncoordinated. He's nervous- Castiel picks up on his nerves, rolling them over so Dean's on his back. Castiel is grinding into him now. "Ugh-" Dean moans, "Yea, this is better-"
"Cause. You wouldn't go near me when Dad brought you over the first couple times."
They had spent everyday of winter and early spring together, taking long evening walks under starry nights and under moonlight along the apple orchard. In their time together they laughed, yelled, fought,rough housed, screamed at each other for no reason and even cried together. They annoyed each other yet they couldn't stay away from one another for very long.
Dean didn't like seeing the man laying there on the hospital bed with wires and fluids attached to his arms and chest. "S'all my fault-" he says eventually under his breath. Bobby was asleep after being given something to help him relax as per Castiel's request.
After a minute or two of contemplation between the two lovers, they settle on the name
Castiel is a little pensive when they pull away but they still manage to peacefully enjoy their drinks with some chips and guacamole. It's nice to see him get jealous but he should really put the man out of his misery so he decides to tell him the truth.
They walk into the mall, hand in hand and it's something Dean still wasn't used to but Castiel insisted it was alright since they were in a crowded place where no one knew them.
boyfriend.
"I trust you." Castiel mumbles over his coffee mug.
Once they settled inside, Dean carried his bags and placed them all on his bed. Pulling out jeans and shirts, socks, underwear and his new cologne. He smiled, thinking of how his dad never did this for him. His dad has never taken him on a shopping spree before. John usually bought him clothes without Dean choosing them, if they fit they fit, if they didn't then they didn't.
Castiel nods, "I understand- he gets up and gets dressed because he knows they won't be fucking. Dean gets up as well to pull on his jeans. "Anything I can do-" he's asking, but he knows there's nothing he can do to take his pain away.
He never gave a rats ass about anyone's story. It's a wonder why he was coming out of his recluse state for this guy.
It's like they can relax and breathe here with no risk of conflict. Besides, who the hell would want to argue in a place where you occasionally walk by someone wearing a
Dean whines, "I'm not-"
"Wait here-" he parks the car by the office so he can return the key as quickly as he can, basically tossing it on the managers desk who just winks at him. Told him to have a nice night with his girlfriend. Apparently Dean Winchester sounded a lot like a chick when getting his ass fucked.
Brady nods, looking like he had just rolled out of bed. He doesn't say anything just goes to his bedroom to grab what his guest came for and hands it to him when he comes back. He's never been given anything before, they usually just share what he's got. "Go on, take it." He holds up the small white bag that wasn't even half full.
A few teens invite him over,
After a few seconds the boy looked back again to see him already walking along the dirt road in the other direction. Every fiber of his being told him to jump out and run towards him and stay, consequences be damned.
"Forgot what an animal you were-" she moans right before Castiel pulls off her top and tears her bra in half to expose her breasts. "Oh my God-" her mouth gapes open, "You're so strong-" it turned her on more. Meg's fingers fumble to unbutton her jeans while Castiel works on his.
standing next door on his lawn with his parents. Castiel smiles at him because this wasn't his fault, but the boy was crying anyhow. "It's okay-" he mouths the words silently to the boy who quickly nods.
On Sunday, Dean finally calls him and he quickly picks up the phone while having breakfast. "Dean-" his tone of voice is overly loving because he's unable to keep it casual.
It's early December and Dean is helping his stepfather hang up a few Christmas lights on the front porch. It's not like anyone will really see them since they live all the way out in the middle of nowhere but Castiel insisted on it because it was about time Dean and his uncle get a
He manages to eat a little more than half the burger and all the tots, he sits back with his hand resting on his stomach. "I'm done."
Dean looks up to show off that beautiful face covered in freckles and the biggest smile ever. "Yea-" and scoots over to make some room on the bed so they can snuggle up together like a family.
"Candy-" Dean says with a smile until he looks inside and frowns. "Tooth paste and a tooth brush-" the disappointment is thick in his tone.
"Not that. I'm pissed at you because maybe- just maybe- when I had a crush on you-when I was little-" Castiel looks at him, "-you should've put me in my place. Told me it was wrong- somethin'-" he kicks up dirt and grass with his boots as they walk. It's done on purpose because he's angry. "But no, you just- damn it." he stops talking.
All he does is blink a few times because those blue eyes are interrogating him intensely. "Mhm-" whimpers, nodding quickly. "I'm okay Castiel-" though his own eyes are telling a completely different story.
When he lets himself inside, that smell is stronger that it had been. He's a rational guy, his first thought isn't to think ghost, or demon- blah blah blah, so he looks through the house, thinking maybe a rat had died somewhere- maybe he had mold. Maybe something was rotting somewhere. But where? he kept a clean home, it didn't even smell like this before he moved in. It had to be something
"I wanna get married-" he continues. "Think I'm ready-" the words sound as if he's trying to convince himself of it.
Castiel quickly sits down on the toilet seat and pushes down his pants so he can jack off as quick as possible just to make his erection go away. His large hand wraps around his cock and strokes slowly as to not make any noise but the occasional hitched breath or groan escape from his parted lips. After he's gotten that release, he feels no better and actually more guilty than before.
Castiel ignores the question, "Don't eat dinner-" that's all he says without giving an explanation.
"Okay well there's that-" his waffles pop up from the toaster. "I'm gonna eat-" he leaves the living room to go have his late breakfast.
"Cas." Dean hugged him, kissing his temple. "Be with me now, I just got a job here in California to work for a construction company. I have nothing else in Kansas, my heart is anywhere where you are."
"Am I sick? I always feel like shit-"
Dean's phone rings much later that night, startling him out of a deep sleep. After fumbling in the dark for his phone, he answers the call. "Yea?" his voice is raspy in the most adorable way.
"Not at all." Bobby smiles. "Glad you're goin-"
"I trust you." Castiel kisses him on the lips once they get inside his car, "I know you're not going to hurt me again."
Maybe the guy really did kill a whole bunch of people like he was warned about when he'd first gotten there. He's asked around for info but no one was willing to say anything- almost every inmate seemed to be afraid of Castiel. Everyone except his group of friends, but no way he was going near them to ask.
"How so?"
He nods, "Dean, I was alright. I was really stressed with work and you-you were difficult at the time."
Dean blushes, "Didn't even know there were rabbits in my yard-I don't really go exploring out here."
Castiel's chest is heaving, up and down. "You're a fucking animal-" he sighs breathlessly. "-you were amazing."
Dean bites his bottom lip, "Not gonna lie..." he sighs, his dick starting to fatten up in his jeans. "It's kinda hot..."
Dean feels weird sitting next to Castiel with come in his boxers, "I-I won't. I understand, okay?"
As all of this was taking place, Dean had missed all of five phone calls that came through, from Jack. Kelly had given birth to a beautiful baby girl. She was seven pounds, eight ounces and her name was
Castiel laughs once more, "Alright." he clears his throat once, "I wish I could fuck you and show you how strong I really am. I had to be so gentle before-"
"Yea-" and smiles, "I think so-"
"Ow-" he hisses, "Ow-ow-" the boy was laying on the grass, face first.
"Quit it, boy-before I smack you." Dean stops, "Go on to bed-ya darn fruitcake." Dean blushes, nodding as he heads down the hall to his room. He hadn't noticed Castiel laying on the couch in the living room- he over heard their conversation about
When there was nothing left to say about John Winchester they called it a night. Castiel slept on the couch, Bobby and Dean slept in their rooms.
