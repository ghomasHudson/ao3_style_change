“We need to find the taxi,” Sherlock said, nodding and John nodded, glad he was finally in sync with the detective.  It was the logical answer, finding the man who was not dead and apparently soul-less.
“Do I dare ask what this pressing project is?  Seems a weird time for assessments,” Sherlock asked, standing in the corridor as John scrambled onto a questionable counter to adjust the blinds.
Sherlock looked from John around the room once more, and then shrugged.  So much for ‘Sherlock Holmes: solvable of the unsolvable’ a nickname John had just come up with and which he would now never bestow upon Sherlock Holmes.  Satisfied with his scoping of the first floor, the detective moved towards the stairs.  “Well my brother’s goons would be annoyed having to navigate them every time they came to keep tabs on me.”
going,” Victor said, air-quoting the everyone, “You should come along, might be fun.”
“I have literally led you to every piece of evidence you have on this case,” Sherlock said, scandalised.
“As fun and weird as this is, I have to go cover a late shift.  But, I’ll do it you know.”  Sherlock tilted his head, an eye still on outside.  “I’ll be your bait I mean, for whatever it is your chasing.”  John couldn’t help but feel a little ridiculous as he said it but he did want to move out of his bed-sit and the idea of doing something productive, even if it was probably horrifically stupid, was alluring.
meaning caught up with his sleep-addled mind.  He balked at the idea, Lestrade’s teasing already ringing in his ears and so went with a simple
“People are strange beings John,” Sherlock muttered.  Molly appeared in the doorway with two mugs and handed one to John, sliding the other to the other side of Sherlock’s bench, away from the work.  If this also helped her peek over Sherlock’s shoulder, then that was a happy coincidence.
“What was that, yesterday?” John asked softly, feeling this might be his only chance.
care for it at all.
) and, while diving through the alleyways, he accidentally hurtled straight into someone else.  It was Victor.
Of course this was the moment he dropped his keys.
“John does,” Molly said, with conviction, clearly seeing Sherlock’s mood spiralling quickly south.  “And I do.  And Mrs Hudson, and Greg, and yes, even your brother.  People can be awful but you, Sherlock Holmes, are not one of them and I think John sees that.  And so what if he doesn’t like you?  He’s just one person out of seven billion.”
home.  The idea of returning empty handed was unbearable, to the point that it might be better not to try at all.
"I've got something I want to show you," Sherlock said and then pulled him by the shirt sleeve down the hall.  He unlocked the room at the end and then suddenly John was in a bedroom.  Sherlock's bedroom to be precise, if the periodic table of the wall was anything to go by.  Sherlock shut the door and hurried over to his desk to switch on a small lamp.
“Slowly then?” John said, turning to smudge a kiss on the knee he was holding.  Sherlock nodded, planting his feet more firmly on the ground.  John started by dragging his hands up his thighs, and then back down.  “Alright then.”  John pushed up to kiss him, teasingly running his tongue over his bottom lip.  When Sherlock had finally relaxed, sinking down into the kiss, he moved back.  He copied his earlier movements, kissing down Sherlock’s chest, but much slower this time, more deliberately, giving Sherlock time to adjust if he wanted.
It was actually quite simple, just a well placed blow to the abdomen to wind him and then an incapacitating blow to the head.  He should be fine.  Probably.  Maybe.  John didn’t really care.  There were other problems than an unconscious criminal.
?!  His mind cheerily supplied him with the information that he was a fucking idiot.  He knew from experience at crime scenes that lust could forgive a multitude of sins but as it cleared so clarity and comprehension came into focus.  Would John still like him?  He must do on some level right?  But what was he looking for exactly?  Sherlock certainly hadn’t expected this, had merely meant to get through the date without making a complete prat of himself so now he was floundering, unsure of the emotional and practical ways around this social convention.  He wished he could text Molly and ask her the etiquette but a) that would involve telling her he’d spent the night with John which would mean her response would either be a shrieky phone call of “I FUCKING TOLD YOU” or enough emojis to fry his phone completely and b) his phone was in his coat pocket which was strewn over the living room floor.  While his mind spiralled around possibilities and scenarios, he didn’t quite realise John was waking up.
“Hey, I don’t fucking snitch.”
“Checking she’s Molly,” he said.  Lestrade looked at him for a moment.  Sherlock sighed.  “Need I remind you that there are currently 11 Fallen’s pretending to be Council members.  I admit it’s a bit of a crude way of verifying but it’s all we have at the moment.”
“Cheating, lives in a bottom floor flat, owns two-no three cats,” was his reply, flicking his head around him at those on the ground.  It made his curls bounce across his forehead.
, Sally thought, smiling as she finally got his attention.
“Yeah, I think I’ve accepted that one.”  (
of paperwork.
“Hi,” John said.  He almost sounded cheeky.
“I love you.”
“Don’t ‘Ah’ me Mycroft,” he spat.
He was still awake, barely.  The long day was catching up with him, and the repetitive soothing motion of Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder was like a cocoon protecting him from the outside world.  Trying to keep his mind on the case, he thought it was oddly like this afternoon, staring at an Underground station, apart from this was a live-feed rather than a recording.  No rewind button or zoom function, although that was what Sherlock was for, the Fallen never missing anything.  He was great like that, really great, just-
“He thinks you might be mixed up in all this,” John carried on, conversationally, as if they were talking about the traffic or the weather.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock did hand it back, not letting his eyes drop.  John felt as if he was mesmerised as he reached up to grab it.   Then Sherlock spoke, head tilting slowly to one side.
Such a bad idea.
If they were still pretending their relationship was truly platonic, that meant they had to pretend to be
That left only two more to investigate.  He was supposed to be meeting Jack Darbyshire tomorrow which just left-
“Shush.”
Is this the best chapter ever? I don't think so.  Does it get us where we need to go? You're damn right.
“You chose this,” Sherlock felt compelled to point out.
And with that, Sherlock practically shoved them into the road.  It took all of John’s agility to remain upright without causing a scene and he swore profusely as he stumbled.  Sherlock, cat-like, had no such difficulty.
John startled a little and nearly looked around to see who he was talking to.  It took longer than it should have to work out that it was himself being addressed.
“In order to make this work, we’re going to need to be secretive.  It’s not going to take long before those on the ground realise something’s gone sideways which means we need to do this properly.  Molly’s already received orders to vet as many of her people as she can so we can start going through this-”
“John, kiss me,” he demanded and their mouths crashed together as John began rutted to match his thrusts up. Slowly at first but then faster, and faster, grunting in time to Sherlock’s gasps. Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth as he brought his legs and arms up to wrap around John’s back.  He was nearly there, fingers dragging down John’s back as he moved his head back to tuck it into John’s neck as he panted desperately.
“Look, honey, don’t over reach yourself.  Maybe he just went home.”
“Hello,” John replied, beaming.
It may not feel like it but we are so nearly there guys, and we are about two chapters away from the scene that propelled me to write this entire bloody thing in the first place!
“Why’s that a good thing?” Sally frowned at him, though she already felt that she knew.
The table had been decimated by this point, covered in a sticky residue caused by one too many spilt drinks and it’s difficult to find anything worth drinking.  It was while he was searching that he overheard a conversation held by two girls who were quite clearly tipsy if not fully drunk, each using the wall to support them and gossiping.  He wouldn’t have paid them any attention had they not mentioned Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded, having retreated into his mind.  When John wandered to the kitchen, Sherlock trailed him before moving over to his chair.
“Certain.  As I’ve said before you got to him before he could get anywhere close.”
, we can work forwards.”  He sighed at their blank faces.  They were nearly they, they just needed- “When a Fallen comes through a portal, what’s the one thing they need?  A
Sherlock looked at John.  “They’ll have stopped using the underground by now.  Could have chosen another location or shut the entire system down.   Our lead has gone AWOL.  Not exactly promising.”
“How do you know that wasn’t my plan all along?” Sherlock said, now lolling against the wall, not making a move to leave but not trying to help again either.
“Ah.” Sherlock sounded a little put out.  “Wait!” he shouted for no reason and then lent forward to scramble at his shoes.  He lifted something up in triumph.  “Don’t worry, found it.”
Then John looked at him and he honest-to-god felt his breath leave his body.  Dark blue ocean eyes had him pinned in place, rooted to the spot next to his mat.  If he had been paying attention to anything around him he would have heard Molly stifle a giggle but he could not think of a single other thing than the eyes he was currently trying not to drown in.
An embarrassed cough.  “Carbonara!”
good intentions.  Their intentions were stellar.  Immaculate.  Butter-wouldn’t-melt type of intentions.
“So like most people.”
do what you think is right.  Not necessarily what’s nicest or most appropriate, but you do what you think is for the best and I love you for it.  And you might not believe me right now.  But I’ll believe for the both of us.”
“John,” he whined, unsure what he was asking for but knowing he needed it now.
Molly squeaked and John realised she was still there, as wrapped up in Sherlock’s mutterings as he had been.  Her cheeks turned red and they looked at her, and her eyes skittered away, over to the clock on the wall.  She stood up.
“No.”
This kiss was harsh, striking, verging on brutal. This kiss was John pulling at the hair he’d caressed so reverently so that he could move Sherlock where he wanted; this kiss was him clutching at John’s hips as they both pushed impossibly closer; this kiss was John biting at his bottom lip and him gasping at the sensation. John licked his way into Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock could only moan and let go, allowing John to take, and take, and take.
He managed to choke out a small “John” before he came all over his stomach.  His vision blacks out as his eyes slam shut and he stops breathing as the sensation takes over, filling him from his hair to his toes.  He’s still shivering as he feels John tense, release above him and then collapse next to him. He pressed his arm over his eyes as if that will contain this feeling that threatens to overcome him, threatens to break him.
that?
They stared at each other for a moment, cold fury emanating from one, disdain from the other.
“Stop avoiding the question.  What’s wrong with you?”
“Yeah, yes, god yes,” John said, punctuating each with a nip at Sherlock’s bottom lip.  There was a small part of Sherlock’s brain that told him to sod the flat and just keep going in the alleyway because the idea of moving was
?” Lestrade said, rustling sounds signaling he was getting out of bed and changed.
“No.  My room, my rules, that’s what we agreed on.”
“You have my attention now,” he said primly, before pausing.  “Oh,” he breathed.  Moriarty’s smile twisted.
Sherlock stood shocked.  That was a ridiculous assumption, a complete misreading of the facts, totally and utterly incorrect and worst of all
And that’s the moment everything went black.
“We just need a little bit more,” Moriarty said.  He flicked his wrist and the platform in between Sherlock and John disappeared into a swirling mass, the same shade of purple at the bonds that kept both of them from throttling Moriarty where he stood.
“Can you actually get to Earth?  You know, with the wings?”
“You think it’s a magic trick?  Some psychic quirk I gave myself?”  Tone level.  Face blank.
He was not normally so naïve but love was causing him to swing more to unbridled optimism.
“Oh, yeah,” John said, shaking his head.  “It’s always like this after boxfit.  It’ll shake out in a bit.”
This did not ring true.  “So that’s it?  You’re just giving up on the case?”
“Come back to mine,” Sherlock whispered, hoping, oh hoping he would say yes.  His voice was ragged.
“Okay,” she said, jumping into her concerned, calm voice.  “What’s the problem?”
“What the bloody hell are you thinking, messing around with people like
“It’s important!  Okay, now I’m finished nagging,” Mike said, holding up his hands at John’s glare before changing the subject.  “So what you thinking about doing for your project?”
like he was going to be dismembered.  There were a few people meandering up and down the street, a few shops, a cafe next to the door with 221 in smudged, silver letters.  However, that didn’t mean anything.  Who knew what was actually hidden behind the door?
“Aha,” Sherlock said triumphantly, grinning proudly, as John’s hands were freed.  As soon as Sherlock appeared at his front again, the hands went immediately to Sherlock’s face, making sure that there was no obvious scarring, no bleeding, that his eyes were focused properly and he hadn’t sustained a concussion from the fall. Sherlock relaxed under his hands, leaning in to the gentle but insistent touch.
Sherlock shrugged and dismissed with a “Mrs Hudson did most of it.”  However, John caught the smile Sherlock tried to conceal by looking away and his chest tightened.  It was nice, having someone notice.
He really,
He grabbed his own stuff out of his bag and John relaxed a little more.  He hadn’t gone to the back page he had been working on before being startled and for once, just this once, Sherlock wished he didn’t notice small details.
Sherlock sighed.  “Well currently we are without evidence and apparently you are all very keen on that to convict people or whatever.  The symbols work was just us, but there are enough angels involved in the investigation to make it suspicious if the files go missing.”
In the present, Sherlock glanced over to John, who was staring at him with a look of quiet determination.  He nodded slightly and offered a small, sad smile.
Sherlock stood gaping for a minute. He was still struggling to comprehend the fact that John had kissed him, let alone the fact that he wanted more.
“Is it him?”
Victor didn’t quite know what to do at this point.  He hadn’t been expecting to actually find him so this was something of a surprise.  Luckily John spotted him while he had paused in his indecision and was making his way towards him.  Unluckily, John looked pissed off.  Like really pissed off.  Victor felt the urge to run even though he was fairly certain he’d done nothing wrong.  Oh God he was right in front of him.
John desperately wanted to talk (well yell) at him, to understand what the hell was going on before Lestrade had his chance to yell and question and completely
“What do I need to do?” he asked Lestrade.
“Sounds like we’ve had a very eventful evening.”
“Honestly,” John shook his head, fondly exasperated.
He sucked in a breath, counted to 4 and then let it back out again.  When he opened his eyes again, they immediately locked with Sherlock’s, who was staring at him from his chair, clearly concerned.  Sherlock appeared to be frozen, half hanging out of his chair, as if to come over and comfort, but he hadn’t made the journey across the room, as if he was afraid he would be unwelcome, as if John would push him away.
you doing?”
“Oh there’s no need to sound quite so scandalised,” Sherlock scoffed.  “Your billion-pound business was under threat from a teenager with nothing more than a computer and some dodgy looking friends, of course you needed to neutralise the threat.  That’s why you messed up his flat, to scare him off, easy, efficient, but it wasn’t enough for your dear secretary Matthew.  Matthew, who idolises you to the point that your picture is on his desk, had finally got his bright idea. The idea that would make you
John closed his laptop with a huff.  Oh, he was in trouble.
“It means I won the bet.  Money on the desk by next Friday please.”
“Yes?”
“Hmmm? Didn’t quite catch that?” Molly was trying not to smile.
“Don’t ‘what?’ me!  How can you know something like this and not tell us?” Victor said sounding personally offended.
He looked around the room.  Far too much dark oak wood for his taste and the large painting above the fireplace was overkill.  However, he would begrudgingly admit it was not entirely horrendous, for a temporary location.  The navy dressing gown hanging on the door was also appreciated.  Now all he had to do was reach it.
“So that means-” Lestrade sat up straighter and then pulled himself to his feet.
So here he was.  An over-tired and under-paid Junior Guard, with no real ambitions to rise higher in the ranks, walking a patrol he’d done practically every day since taking the job, bored out of his mind with nothing to fill his thoughts.
), now it was just them, together.  Sherlock would never admit it, to anyone,
.  He was dragged a few steps forward until they were next to the bed, before John began pulled at the long jumper.
It had started innocently enough.  Due to his work, Sherlock couldn’t always be in the flat to take care of Gladstone but he would be dammed if he gave him away.  Mrs Hudson could deal with feeding and so on but walking an Irish Setter was rather more work than he could ask of her, especially since she allowed Gladstone in the flat in the first place.  Therefore there was only one obvious solution.  A dog walker was necessary.
The familiar outline was silhouetted by the window, arms folded, face unreadable in the shadows. Suddenly Sherlock’s limbs seemed too much for him and he couldn’t work out how he should hold himself, feeling as gangly as a teenager with a growth spurt. He stared at his shuffling feet, glancing up occasionally at his silent companion. It became abundantly clear that John was willing to wait.
The doorbell rang.  “You going to be okay for a bit?” she asked, obviously trying to be caring and not condescending.  Maybe she did like him and he was being paranoid.  It wouldn’t be the first time.
Phone Call Number 1:
“Yeah.  Think we both need to clean up a bit before we do much else.”
already.  This meant he did not keep an eye on John.  He should have kept an eye on John.
Bit of a fast/ bitty edit on this one so let me know of any mistakes (edited part of it at work, then some at home, didn't realise the work stuff only saved onto the internet version etc etc, you get the drift)
at that.”  He waved the pen about for emphasis.
John looked down at him and sighed. “Oh, Sherlock,” he muttered, stroking a hand through Sherlock’s riotous hair and leaning down over him. Sherlock hadn’t realised there was tear tracks on his face until John kisses them away again. He allows himself to be manoeuvred under the duvet and onto his side so John can wrap him into a hug and mutter nonsense comfort until he’s calmed down.
John blushed.  “A while longer?  As soon as I’d figured out what had happened I knew you’d be livid so I thought I’d camp out up here until you’d calmed down a bit.  Thought you might assume I was out.”
It looked like a small crater, a dent in path with spidering cracks running across the floor and up the walls of the surrounding buildings.  The air crackled with energy, a current seeking an outlet.  The centre of the crater was a glittering light blue which was quickly fading to black at the edges, and he could see the darkness creeping across like lava across the ground.
“Titan Industries.  Building Developers.  But I’m not doing it for me, I swear,” Jake exclaimed.
“Sensible.  But, more importantly, I would rather be trapped down here with you than spend eternity up there without you.”
“I don’t-”
He was surprised to see Molly waiting outside for him.  She was not difficult to spot, her chunky, pink knit cardigan clashing with the sleek, white, Kensington town houses around her.
“No,” Sherlock shouted back but the panic in his eyes gave him away easily.
Greg caught the pen and started twirling it in his fingers.  “Look you could have said you wanted to move.  You could have had the spare room at mine or something.”
“They wiped the CCTV.  All they have is Jake’s word against theirs.  A teenager living in this area, the police aren’t likely to listen.  But even if they did, they must have something to use against Jake, something he’s done to provoke this.”  But what?  Or perhaps something
) and Sherlock insisted he learn some Chemistry as well.  His brain felt like it was 2 seconds away from exploding from the sheer volume of information stuck in there.
“-there to talk to, I know Greg, and as ever I can say I will keep it mind, thank you.”
“But you said-“
.  Fists clenching, arms flexing, a knot in his stomach twisting.
“Yeah, probably,” Raz agreed, his guilt short-lived.  “Look, it won’t bite you know.”  He nodded to the list.  “Just read it and get going earth-wise.”
“Three years,” and Sherlock can’t help but preen a little at the pleased look in John’s dark eyes.  Sherlock pulled his head down so he can kiss him quickly before moving just so he can press the word “sorry” over and over again onto John’s lips.
“Careful,” said the soft voice from above him.  “Remember, keep your breathing steady, it’ll help you balance.”  As if he could breathe normally in such a situation.  Ridiculous.  Stupid, lovely John.
Sherlock flicked the mouse and pulled up the plate.  John got out his phone and texted out an alert.  “I’ve alerted the Guard to look out for the car as well as the man.”  Sherlock did not look pleased about introducing other people but they couldn’t logically search the entirety of the afterlife by themselves.
After a few deep breaths, John managed to sit up properly.  He smiled up at Sherlock, who was gazing curiously at him.  Signalling, he held his hand out.  Sherlock blinked.  John raised his eyebrow and waved his hand a little, which seemed to trigger Sherlock into movement.  They locked fingers and Sherlock helped haul John up.
Lestrade started shaking his head.  “Sherlock are you-”
“They do little else,” Sherlock said and ended the conversation by kissing him again.  He was not in control for long however.  John’s thoughts had obviously been running in line with Sherlock’s as he found himself spun around and pushed up against the door.  The wooden frame bit into his back and his head thudded against the door.  John looked like he was going to say something along the lines of “you alright?” but Sherlock couldn’t be bothered explaining that the only way he would be alright would be if John didn’t stop kissing him ever for the rest of time, so he dragged John by his coat lapels against him and groaned into a filthy kiss.
“Fresh paint.  You were looking the other way, to where the offices are.”
“Yeah, yeah,” John said, bashfully smiling at his feet, before glancing up at Sherlock.  “You sure you can put up with me?”
“You look like a twat.” Raz helpfully informed him.  Lestrade thought John didn’t hear him cover a snort of laughter.  He was mistaken in this assumption.  At least he had scaled down from strangling Sherlock with his bare hands.
“Not staring,” he said, not moving his eyes from the rear-view mirror.
“Some would say that makes you a fool.”
,” John said with an affectionate eye-roll.  “You barrelled into my life and you changed everything, in one go.  No caution or hesitation or holding back.  And, I don’t know, I guess I’d been waiting for someone to take that leap with me.  For me.  I owe you everything Sherlock and I’ll never stop being grateful for that.”
Sherlock partially collapsed against the front desk, waiting an appropriate amount of time before following John out.
“I know there’s nothing wrong with it.  But it doesn’t matter.  Because I don’t.  So there,” Sherlock said sharply.  “You shouldn’t be
“Explain.”
But it would explain the blush and the shifting and the general air of
“So you just gave it to him?”  John felt he was missing something.  Why was Mike letting a Fallen do experiments in Barts?  And who had stolen the arm?
“John, just breathe for us okay?  Deep breaths.  It’s all going to be fine.  Now tell me, who is Victor and why haven’t I heard about him before?”
“Thanks by the way,” she said timidly.  He didn’t reply.
“So, what’s next?” he asked.
John told himself he shouldn’t laugh.  “I’m going to verify that you know, when we question them.”  The other angel just shrugged and turned once more.
“Yep.”
“Come on John!”
He attempted to look casual as he hung about the doorway.  Thought about wandering into the café for a coffee.  Also thought of walking around the block again.  Decided against both, the first because there were more people in the café than he was comfortable with, the second because he would feel like a right twat crossing past the same people again.
“I’m just thinking!  Have you rung him?”
“A what?” John asked.
It did not help that it was fucking freezing and all John had on was his flimsy jacket.  The steps went something like this: Hands in pockets, out of pockets, folded across chest, weight on one foot, weight on the other, lean against wall, no, legs crossed, no balance, feet apart, don’t look at anyone for too long but also don’t immediately glance away, that could be suspicious, did he look suspicious, surely someone must have clocked them by now...
days drilling holes into your flats walls, I figured you weren’t too busy to give us a hand.”
She considered this question.  John took the other seat on the sofa and swore the porcelain cats on the mantlepiece were staring at him.  He focussed on the woman instead.
It might not be.  People had coursework and John probably had other friends he needed to see and maybe he’d gone back home for a bit and there was a myriad of other things John could be doing besides seeing Sherlock that had nothing to do with John not
"Sherlock," John’s voice was low and steady and close. Sherlock opened his eyes and startled slightly at John’s sudden proximity. This close his features were finally distinguishable. Sherlock focused in on the subtle shifts, the darkness under his eyes, the slight stubble under his chin before drawing back, to look into his eyes. Not the blue of a perfect ocean but of the real one, the murky blue-green that promised a storm was coming, one in which Sherlock would happily drown.
“Used to be flats.  They knocked through to create some community space years ago but both the funding and enthusiasm dried up.  Now it’s abandoned.”
“Right, now how about opening your eyes?” Mycroft said patronisingly.
Things had changed after the hug.  Not hugely, not loudly, but the subtle brushing of shoulders and bumping of elbows had increased dramatically and it. Was. Driving. John.
It was this thought which made Sherlock laugh, difficult when one was kissing another person.  John leaned back, frowning.
“Can we not?  Later, but not right now.”  John looked ready to insist so Sherlock leaned down so they were forehead to forehead and whispered, “Please?”
.  He was.
opened it and she immediately beamed at Sherlock.
“I didn’t mean it like that.  You know I didn’t.”
“Love you too.”
on a date.  Pushing it aside and assigning it to the pile of social conventions he would never understand, he stood up, so he was fully under the shower spray, quickly cleaning himself and making sure to shampoo and condition his hair carefully.
Mycroft nodded.  “Luckily I am well versed in Sherlock and can translate easily.  As for not contacting you with news of John’s arrival, contact with the Above world became rather difficult.”
, Sherlock would later reason,
The morning was awkward.  There was no other word for it.
“That’s very…” John cast around for any word other than nice. “Sweet.  That’s very sweet of you Sherlock.  Now get off my head or I’m going to do serious damage to your kidneys.”
“I’m still going to confiscate Lestrade’s phone.”
“You can’t recreate this specific power register without F.A.  I think it said somewhere you could make a magnet levitate if you dropped it into the beaker,” he said.
“Or it was in the wrong place,” Lestrade said, pointing with his coffee cup to the opposite side.  Both of them jumped apart at the sudden intrusion and stared at Lestrade.  The only word to describe him was smug.  “Not the only detective here Watson,” he jibed, “Now untangle yourselves, we’ve got an investigation to do.”  With that, he wandered off across the road, whistling.
“Bit of a time pressure here Sherlock,” Lestrade nudged.
“You’re going to be fine you know.  Now don’t do that to your phone you’ll break it.”
“It is!” John said, determined to prove his point.  “Look, what if I said don’t picture a pink elephant.  Now you’re picturing a pink elephant.”
An ‘actual case’ as Victor put it.
“Sherlock,” he said, shocked still at the sight of the man he had been dodging all week.
The next day, a few lower profile news sites had christened the mysterious saviour the Victoria Vigilante after the close Tube line and because a good mystery always sells.  By the weekend major new sites had picked it up.
“Knew I kept you round for something,” John said with a wicked smile.  They both lent in and-
), they had set up a date for a week’s time.  Since then they’d managed to bump into each other more in one week than they had in 7 months living across the hall from each other.  Hallways, coffee shops, the campus library, shopping in Tesco: if two people could be in the same shared common space at the same time, they would both be there.  Once John’s crush had been shoved into a box in the back of his mind, he couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to Sherlock.  Sure, conversations about blood splatter patterns and a disappearing, gold-stealing cockatoo were not what most people would call ‘polite conversation’ but it was interesting and refreshing to not have an awkward ‘getting-to-know-you’ phase.
“I didn’t say it wasn’t good!  Just not all of us fully understand it.”
"Me? Yes, fine, never better, why wouldn't I be?" It hadn't escaped Johns notice that Sherlock a) hadn't moved from the space in the doorway but his hands kept twitching every few seconds, as if he was preventing himself bolting and b) hadn't looked at him yet.
“Alright so we’ve got most of the information but, as you can probably guess from the lack of actual arresting going on, we haven’t found the perpetrator yet.  Usually we wouldn’t look into this in depth but with the number of people who all linked and the fatalities we do actually need to intervene.  You read the full report after your breaking and entering yeah?”
Sherlock, being Sherlock, waited for half a minute.  It was a show of intense restraint on his part.  Then he leapt from the room and appeared on the other side before John could even say “Please don’t.”
“A murder.”
Then Thursday happened.  It was one of the few days he had made it out the house and had been aimlessly wandering the city, trying to find some reason to be excited about any of it.  As usual it hadn't worked but he still kept trying because what else could he do?  Trudging back to his bed sit was when things changed, if only slightly.  He'd taken to walking down the side-streets and alleyways that other people avoided because for one, he didn't want to be around other people and two, they were the only place he felt like he belonged.  This particular day he was taking a new short-cut when he heard a woman screaming.  Acting on instinct, he ran towards it.  As he turned the corner he took in the scene, his military training kicking in.  A young woman was pinned to a wall with a knife held extremely close to her throat by a scrawny twenty-something that John reckoned he could have taken pre-powers.  Post-powers?  The guy didn’t even stand a chance.
“Because you told me not to!”
“The man I’m named after John.  The one I don’t mention ever.  You noticed but you never pressed me on it.  Now, you have a choice.  You can either go in there with me and meet him or stay out here and remain blissfully unaware of the scum that he is.”  Sherlock’s lips curled as he spat out the words.
Lestrade looked like he wanted to berate Sherlock but instead simply said “Four.”  Maybe John would be able to talk him out of this madness.
staring, the figure bolted.
He hadn’t meant to say it.
“And you are insisting you’re a villain.  Have you been a dick recently?  Yes.  Is it worth being banished to the Other Place for?  No.  I mean you solve crimes for a living., that counts for something.  You look after Mrs Hudson.  You put up with me.  You’re not a bad angel Sherlock.  Even if you want to be.”
There were many questions John wanted to ask.   The one that he started with surprised even himself.
“Sherlock?”
“It’s all well and good that we are declaring our undying love but you’re still going to have to brush your teeth before kissing me.”
Sherlock made a muffled noise that sounded a lot like “I’m going to kill him for telling you that.”
It was true that people “woke up” in heaven but this was not instantaneous, as many people presume.  Therefore, in the period of time between dying on earth and waking up in heaven, it was the job of a team of angels to make sure they were set up for their time in heaven, including soul registration and identification checks.  It was not a highly sort after branch of Healing, despite being a lucrative one, as working with the recently deceased who could awake at any moment understandably unnerved many.  However, access to the databases and information that undercut the world around them would be a useful resource for someone unofficially fighting crime, and John could see why Sherlock would cultivate an association.  Molly however?  What was she getting out of the deal between them?  John thought of the voice on the phone but couldn’t see Molly as a spy.
“Yes.  Project.  We have a photography project due in a few weeks and I think you would be an excellent study but I didn’t want to just spring this on you so like, I don’t know.  You want to grab coffee?  Decide if it’s something you might be interested in?”
“Oh, it’s nothing.  Rugby stuff.  Boring.”  It was a lie but Sherlock didn’t know how to mention it so he didn’t.
As he drifted off, John’s hands stroking his back, he felt that there might be some advantages to accidental humanity.  After all, every demonic cloud has to have a beautiful, charming, blonde-haired silver lining.
“Tell me more,” John distracted him.  “Tell me what you thought of and I’ll tell you what I thought.”
“I’m going to pretend that was a compliment.”
“Ah, nothing much.  Just, you know, life stuff.  Work, shoulder, bedsit, next steps.”
“Yeah, that was amazing.  How do you do that?” John said, leaning forward, “Although you weren’t entirely right.”  His eyes sparkled.
The next morning he texted for John to pick up Gladstone.  He was unsure of actual timings and so tried to do some work while waiting.  This unfortunately proved impossible as the tension in his body caused him to break several microscope slides and a mug.  Gladstone lifted his head from his basket and had whined his disapproval at his nap being disrupted.  That’s when the pacing started and then the doorbell rang and now he was here and Sherlock realised had no idea what to do with himself and had no plan whatsoever for this encounter beyond ‘Meet John’.  When he heard Mrs Hudson open the door he flung himself into his chair, trying to project an air of nonchalance.  He glanced over at Gladstone who was sat on the sofa, head tilted in a ‘seriously?’ gesture.
They spent the rest of the day in companionable silence, Sherlock in his own head, and John trying to distract himself from thinking about last night and the night to come.  Once he’d sorted one problem, every small flaw in Baker Street made itself known, and he spent the day tightening screws, fixing the wobbly chair leg in the sitting room, washing the blankets that were shoved on the back of the sofa, cleaning the skull on the wall and adjusting its headphones, and a multitude of other “I’ll get round to it later” tasks.
Sherlock strode straight up to them and without any preamble demanded “I need to see all footage from last night, from this shop as well as the surrounding area.  Immediately I need to see the safe things were taken from.”
“Yes, and I’m sure the information from young George had very little to do with this.”
“You know him!”
“Who the fuck’s there?” the guy shouted.  The distant sound of sirens was the only response.  The guy huffed, as if this was simply a huge inconvenience to his
but they weren’t necessarily

?”  Not the thing to focus on but his mind couldn’t quite comprehend there being another Holmes wandering around the cosmos.
.  To be completely honest, John had forgotten about his actual job.  The one that paid him money in return for turning up, rather than running around London at all hours after his flatmate.

“From back there?”
John was screwed from the moment he saw him.  The worst thing was that he was fully aware of how screwed he was and did absolutely nothing to stop it.  Even more cliché was the fact he saw him in a damn coffee shop of all places.
“That’s sort of the problem.  We’ve got no fucking clue.”
casually, trying to eavesdrop, only to find that both were sat in silence, practically ignoring each other.
"Okay?" John asked again.  He wrapped one hand around the base of Sherlock's cock and the other pressed onto his hip, keeping him pinned to the mattress.
“Sherlock!”
,” he said pointing a finger at Sherlock, “Better call me later.  We have much to discuss.”  Victor winked at Sherlock as he left.  Well there was the answer about dating blondes at least.  Less good on the across the hall front.
Sherlock struggled for a moment, scrunching up his nose and mouth in a way John thought was pretty close to being adorable.  “My mind stagnates at boredom.  We finally have a case, a great one, the biggest case for-“ he gestured that it was impossible to describe the amount of time- “and to be stuck, trapped, waiting for the car to be found, and that
“I’m getting you a list,” he said.
“John, what the hell are you- oh god.” Sherlock slammed his head back against the bed and John laughed breathlessly in his ear as he lowered his hips. They were joined head to waist. Sherlock could feel John’s erection next to his and he experimentally shifted his hips up. John cursed and Sherlock would have laughed if he wasn’t busy chasing that sparking sensation in his gut.
John got in the back seat, expecting Sherlock would want the front for a better view.  Therefore it was a surprise when the other back door opened and Sherlock slid into the middle seat.  Lestrade’s car was not massive and Sherlock seemed determined to stare out through the gap in the front seats, so their sides were pressed against each other from foot to shoulder, their wings overlapping.  John couldn’t have moved away if he tried, there being no space to move
“Wanted this.  Wanted you so fucking bad Lock.”
“Do you want to tell him or should I?” Moriarty said.  Sherlock’s stomach clenched as he realised the true reason they had been gathered.
Sherlock tilted his head and asked the next question with as much innocence as he could muster.  “How do you feel about clubbing John?”
“Tell me why that one.”
“And did it not cross your mind that there could be another reason why I was not in bed?  Taking a shower, for example?  Making some breakfast for the both of us?”  John could swear he saw the exact moment when Sherlock’s brain cleared and the actual answer emerged.  He grinned as the detective’s cheeks flushed light pink

“One of them made it through,” Sherlock said, nodding.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “It’s not my fault you see-”
thoughts and focused.  Well, he tried at least.
“John, you’ve seen F.A. before correct?” he said, not looking up.
“Sort of.  He’s married to my cousin who lives near to us so I see him all the time.  He’s not too bad once you know him well enough but up until that point he’s kind of a dick.”
“Very much. Do you want me?” John’s question was tinged with a hint of uncertainty.
The lab was like any other he’d seen.  A row of desks, one of which was decked out with equipment Sherlock had pulled from around the room, and some computers dotted around, one of which was glowing with a start screen.  Sherlock was plugging in a vaulted camera over the microscope and connecting it to the computer.
“Yes, you are being both those things.” Molly smirked.
“I’m not certain it would be effective for you to come too,” Sherlock told John’s feet.
“Yes, well I’m special.”
“- You cannot seriously be considering doing this individually?”
He, equally as carefully, walked over and plucked the scrap out of his hands.  “I’ll see what I can do.  After all, they still need snitches.”
“It kept you busy,” Sherlock quipped, and John was about to start yelling when Sherlock raised a placating hand.  “It rules out people.  Plus, I am not convinced they know of us yet and so those people are still suspects.”  John thought about it and then nodded, mollified.
“You think it can’t work out?”
Negatives: the club manager was not happy to see him.  His bleary eyes had narrowed when Sherlock was shown into the room by an agitated Lestrade and if his hand weren’t in cuffs they would certainly be around Sherlock’s neck by now.
Both look shocked.  Molly recovered first, grinning.  “Our pleasure.”
The car settled into a tense silence as Lestrade parked the car and cut the lights on the quieter end of the street, in a gap between streetlights.  John tried his best to fold his arms but pain lanced through his shoulder.  The cold of the evening had seeped in without him realising, the excitement of the case taking precedence over mild-discomfort.  However, his shoulder was clearly fed up of being subtle and began protesting in earnest.  The prospect of sitting hunched for several hours was daunting.  Sherlock noticed him wincing (
“Yeah I’m pretty sure.  See you later.”  John didn’t wait to hear her reply.  He pushed his way through the crowd in both the living room and hallway.
Sherlock resisted the urge to lunge across the room and throttle him.  “I meant in the conservatory specifically.  Obviously.”
Instead he scanned over each of the files.  Nothing sprang up as unusual which only sank Sherlock further into his petulant state.  The least it could do was throw up

the figure was shadowy.  The guy had solid black wings.  John almost hadn’t noticed them as they blended into the grime of the street and walls but they were there, rippling across the alley.  This only meant one thing and it came with a

“But there’s a perfectly good seat
“So you’re coming then.”
“Oh I’m sure you’ll think of something.”  Sherlock finally reconnected their lips into another kiss.  They didn’t do much talking after that.
John cursed his busted wing a few times for good measure, despite the fact he wasn’t sure he could support both their weight in flight even when his wing worked properly.
“What are you blackmailing them with?” Sherlock asked, curious.  This case was certainly looking more interesting.
“An underground network Greg.  A literal underground network,” John said, shaking his head.  Subtly was not the art of the Fallen apparently.
Victor’s grin only grew wider.  “Oh, you know, just adventuring.  Care to join?”
“You implied it though.”
John felt slightly sick.
Something was bound to break.
“Sherlock?”

“Top drawer,” John managed to focus enough to string together two words.  However this also meant that the movements stopped and John groaned at the loss of contact.  He was so close, he just needed-
They didn’t realise their problem as went to go and get ready.  This took an half an hour longer than expected when Sherlock broke into John’s room for a surprise snogging session, and they only realised the time when John’s phone wouldn’t stop ringing.  (This turned out to be Mycroft who, although he would prefer not to know, knew this would happen).
“Shit.”

was here.
, then that's fine, we don't have to mention it, I,” Sherlock trailed off.  The wooden floor really needed cleaning.  Especially when he melted through it in a state of complete embarrassment.  Mrs Hudson would be so annoyed.
“But do not observe, yada yada,” Victor cut in. “I fully understood the first time, felt the second time was a little unnecessary, and by now I’ve lost count and feel like the words are forever ingrained into my mind.  I bet if you opened my head up those words would be patterned into my skull.”
“Come on. These clothes need to go,” he demanded.  Sherlock quickly halted his effort to press himself back along the line of John’s body to help eagerly get rid of the layers between them. Sherlock stood for a moment, his jaw falling open as he stared at John’s naked body as John shucked off his jeans and pants, kicking them out the way. Tanned skin faded into pale, dark blonde hair dusting his chest, trailing lower, and the small nicks and scars being dominated by the beautiful, terrible one in his left shoulder. John looked up and caught Sherlock’s stare. He grinned as Sherlock flushed at being caught out but was saved his embarrassment as John pulled him back in for a kiss. However, as his arms snaked around his back, John gasped and jerked back.
2) Sorry about the gap between posting- these last chapters weren't written before I started uploading and then I got carried away and uploaded the first 3 too quickly so there's going to be a bit of a wait (like a few days)
John wouldn’t look at him.
It wasn’t because of the wink.
There was a lot Sherlock could say to that.
“You were being a dick.  Come on, you’ve been distracted all week.  I even get you invited to a high-level crime scene and you can’t even be bothered to
Sherlock, in retaliation, didn’t stop looking out the window.  “What would you call this then?”
“Oh dear brother mine.  What a dilemma you are in.”
“Our friend Jake lives here.  Well used to anyway.  2 days ago he came home from work to find this, went straight over to stay at Oli’s.  There was no note, no message, nothing.  I told him you might be able to help us find out who did this and why,” Victor explained.
Sherlock who looked like he should be walking on a catwalk in Milan or Paris rather than standing in a crowded, chaotic flat.  Sherlock who was dressed in a flannel button down that looked tailored to fit his shape, accentuating a surprising amount of muscle in his arms and coasting his slim waist.  Sherlock with his curls and fringe artfully ruffled into a controlled purposefully-dishevelled style.  Sherlock who was wearing the tightest black jeans known to all humanity that could have been made especially because the universe hated John and wanted him to know exactly how shapely Sherlock's delicious arse could be.  Sherlock who was looking at them right now.  Sherlock who was headed over to them.
.  A plastic toy in the shape of a pig smacked him in the face.
“Boyfriend?” he questioned.
This is why he didn’t feel as bad that the first thing he did upon regaining consciousness was nudge his elbow backwards, jabbing it into Sherlock’s side.
“This could be the first time!”  Sherlock scoffed and returned to glaring at the screen.  “You don’t think they'll look like Faber anymore, do you.”
It was at this moment the particular part of the ceiling above Raz’s head caved in.  Dust and detritus flurried down, masking both Sherlock and Raz from view.  There was a flurry of activity, wings and screaming, mainly from Raz.  John beat Lestrade out the door, in time to catch Sherlock as he fell out the interrogation room, a gash streaming blood from his head.
The meagre information made him frown.  So much for most observational in the class.  Sherlock didn’t look thrilled either but even in his frustration John noticed his hands were gentle around his face.  If he moved his head slightly, tilted it to one angle, his lips would brush up against fingertips.
“What the fuck are you doing in here?”
“Why?”
Sherlock had to pull him back as John automatically went to open the door.  He should be more concerned by the fact that he would blindly follow Sherlock’s orders without pausing to think.
He should have laughed.  The last rash thing he did was sign up to be a war-healer.  What would become known as the biggest war to unfold in the afterlife since the Fall had broken out a week prior, and had developed from a mere skirmish to an out-and-out dogfight for people’s souls.  John knew he had to do
Sherlock said, slumping onto the sofa and resting his side to John’s.  He fought a smug smile when John ran a hand up his spine and rested it at the nape of his neck.  “Piss off Mycroft,” he huffed, for the second time that day.  His scowl turned into a glower when Mycroft, instead of taking the hint, came and sat in the adjacent chair.

problem.
John smiled but there was glint in his eyes. The dangerous passion had not passed and he was calculating something. Sherlock didn’t feel nervous however. John would look after him. He always did.
spies.  Cool and aloof persona, check.  Possibility of John liking him- check?
It was Sherlock’s turn to wait and watch as John weighed his words. He silently admitted to himself that he would stare all night if could. That way John wouldn't disappear, like he had in so many dreams.
But it was fine.
, something he had never done before and was reluctant to ever do again.  He flicked through to the photo spread and stopped dead.
), John felt he was something of an expert at compartmentalising his problems.  These symptoms, as John took to thinking of them, were nothing he hadn’t seen before.  After he had been discharged from his Defender team, he had spent most of his time in a state of constant hyper vigilance, even in sleep, no sound too small, no movement too insignificant.  It was exhausting and it wasn’t until he’d been forced by Molly to join the Healer community that he finally found some peace.  That was, until Sherlock came along with his own brand of observation and Mori-
“John!”
“Hello.  We need to speak to John Watson.  Very urgently.  Can you locate him for us?”
He then turned and bolted after his masked beloved.  Superpowers he may possess but his sense of direction was still absolutely shocking.
This somehow made the secret almost worse.  John could recognise a kindred spirit in Sherlock’s actions, although he always proclaimed it was for the puzzle over the people.  But what they both drove for was the chase and herein lay the problem.  How do you go about telling your flatmate/ colleague/ new best friend that you weren’t in on Wednesday to help go solve a murder case because you were jumping rooftops after a gang leader that aforementioned flatmate had been looking for, for four months?  It wasn’t something you could type into Google.
John expected that at some point he would jump up and begin to run off, bounding across the streets of London to the station.  However, it seemed that Sherlock was content to sit until he gained the ability to burn a whole through the screen that defied him and his crime solving ability which could last a while and John had not planned on spending eternity in the windowless basement of St Bartholemew’s Laboratory and Learning Centre.
“Also when you’ve finished drooling all over my sofa, you can help me clean up.”
“So until you get some sort of bat-signal telling you that it’s fine to investigate again, you’re just going to...sulk?”  He was trying not to be judgemental when he said that.  He did not entirely succeed.
But in the ways that truly mattered it was still the same.  The smiley face on the wall still beamed at him from the wall. Their chairs were still stationed by the fire. His old friend was still perched on the fireplace.  It felt like stepping back into a memory. He’d often frequented 221B, however indirectly, in his Mind Palace but it paled next to the real thing.
His wings were decimated.
Curiosity was one of Sherlock’s dominant personality traits.  Everyone in the greater London area knew this.  He tried convincing himself John really was scowling about rugby practice.  He really did. But he knew it wasn’t true so he couldn’t.  He tried working out the scowl from context but there were so few details apart from John a) was truly concentrating meaning it had special meaning for him and b) he definitely did not want Sherlock to see.  Useless theorising without all the facts.
It was worth it to solve a case he thought as he staggered zig-zag fashion upstairs.  A traitorous part of his mind added ‘
This was demonstrated by the fact Sherlock was nearly jumping up and down at the news, stopped only by the fact he did not want to do so in front of the Guards.
"Yes," Sherlock interrupted, pressing back into John's body. "Yes, yes, yes," he chanted as he nuzzled into John's neck, drawing in deep breaths.  That should not of been as erotic as it was.  John's head was spinning trying to keep up with what was happening.  15 minutes ago he'd been stood in the middle of a party in the living room and now Sherlock was wrapped around him,
Not-John, with his hands shoved in his pockets, turned to him with a curious look
Sherlock nodded.  “The dosage was too low to cause an overdose.  It was spiked with a catalyst making muscle-gain quicker but with the unfortunate side-effect of poisoning those using it.  How do you know it wasn’t the company directly?”
“Lock-pick.  Keep one in my shoes at all times.  Didn’t know if I could reach it or if it had been conf- confi- confsccc- taken.” Sherlock’s voice was muffled as he worked.
So was the portal.
“We could’ve handled this ourselves you know?  We’re not as bad as he makes out,” she said to Lestrade.
“What do you mean?”
Moriarty didn’t seem inclined to rush, instead running his arm across John’s shoulders before releasing him and looking around.  “One of the original platforms you know,” he said, nodding at the surroundings.  “1863 Metropolitan line.”
Fuck.
John led Sherlock back to the dance floor, hands intertwined.  There was a small space near the edge of the floor and the music was at a slow waltzing pace.  There wasn’t any space to move into so they simply turned on the spot.  John could feel a few people glancing their way but he only had eyes for Sherlock, who was thinking the exact same thing.  It turned out their bubble was still intact, just people could now see inside, could now see how happy they were.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lestrade was very,
Molly.”  It was supposed to be commanding, a rally against nonsense such as manners, but instead came out small and panicked.  His flight across London had not been calming, as the vastness of the place was laid bare.  Finding anyone seemed impossible in such ruckus.
“John says it’s polite to ask questions about people’s lives rather than just deducing them.”  Lestrade smiled at that, unable to ignore the image of
“You’re the reason the fucking police are after me!”
It had taken time but gradually he made progress towards stopping the spiralling thoughts.  He’d had to learn to ignore the slight disappointed vibes from his dad which made his heart clench every time he even thought about it but overall by mid-spring he was definitely better than he had been.  That’s when he found photography.  He’d been out for a walk because that’s what people had said might help and the thought of spending another moment in the house had gone from feeling like a sanctuary to feeling like he was being trapped in a huge box.  There were few green spaces in his area of London so it was quite a way to the nearest park but when he finally arrived it felt like a run-down, glass covered oasis.  He wandered until he was near the small pond on the far side.   Just by the water, he watched as a small train of ducks veer their way wildly to the pond, somehow managing to skate around it without actually ever getting into the water.  His lips twitched and stopped.  He actually felt something.  Nothing overpowering, nothing wild but...something.  He was struck with the need to remember this moment.  That’s when he took his first photo.   Nothing wild, just a small snap of the ducks on an overcast day in a city park.
“Not entirely sure.  Lestrade said he called in a favour and this is where they said to set up so, here we are.”
“I think I might be able to help with that.”  Sherlock raised an eyebrow.  “You need someone to gather a ton of disparate information, outside of their day job, with no tangible reward other than helping us out.”
“Err, a while.  It’s not as easy as you make it look,” was the reluctant reply, John giving a bashful smile.
“And yet it still hurts that you forgot.”
He was…not happy.
“Hey, you did good today.”
Sherlock shook his head, trying to remember what they were speaking about.  He wanted to say that he knew this and believed as much as John obviously did.  That this was a fact rather than an opinion.  And yet-
“What?” both asked at the same time.
“Is that allowed?”
.  Just for a bit.  Then you can run around in your fancy togs as much as you want.”
“Yeah, I guess I did.”  John was smiling again and to Sherlock, that was the most important thing in the world.  There was more to sort out, so much more, like a house and a job and a life to build, and it wouldn’t always be easy, and they would fight, and bicker and he’d say the wrong thing, and his brother would interfere, and it wouldn’t always be perfect.  But it didn’t matter.  Because in this moment, this particular moment, everything
and whatever it was John was fairly sure he wouldn’t have had it lying about on his old kitchen work surfaces.  Unless it was jam.  Perhaps it was jam.  But how was he supposed to know?  He had his hand halfway towards his mouth to solve his conundrum with a taste-test before realising just how stupid of an idea that was; especially as he had no idea what Sherlock had been working with the other day.
Sherlock collapsed back onto the bed, breathing harshly, limbs spread out.  John rose up onto his knees and was painfully aware of his own erection pressing into his stomach.  He licked a stripe over his hand and took hold of himself, balanced above Sherlock.  His pace was fast and he added a twist at the head that had his breath stuttering.  Sherlock's eyes fluttered open and landed on John.  The added of intensity of Sherlock's gaze pushed him over the edge and he came with Sherlock's name spilling out of his lips.
He smiled.  “Never better,” he said, lying down and sprawling across the bed.  John laughed and Sherlock closed his eyes to file away the sound, the nuances of it.  He loved him.  Really, truly loved him.  The weight of the bed shifted, and a hand ran across his chest as John snuggled in.  He twisted to tangle his legs with John’s and grabbed the blanket from the bottom of the bed.
“Um, yes well, I-“
“Wait, so I’ve spent all day sending you clips of suspects for no reason?”
While mid-argument about whether Stacey actually counted as a relationship or not (
John froze when he saw it, suddenly uncertain about what to do next.  His mind stuck on the fact he was holding coffee and was therefore defenceless.  What if the tagger was close by and saw him?  He couldn’t pass himself off as a graffiti connoisseur.  Sherlock would know, if only he was here.
Maybe there was something he could do.
John only turned when the door had slid shut behind him and had become invisible once again.
“I’ve done nothing.”
“I wish you luck finding him in this lot,” she gestured to the amount of people currently packed into the room, “As for me, I live across the hall so it was either stay up all night with the noise or join in creating it.”
“Sherlock,” John said, trying to be a warning but Sherlock could tell he was smiling.
“What?”
John rolled his eyes.  “This is why I don’t work with you.”
This worry also came from the fact that, after leaving Sherlock’s presence, the true ridiculousness of what he was about to do caught up with him. While talking to him, it had made perfect sense to move into a stranger’s house with an angel that couldn’t be traced and an apparent threat over his own head.  John toyed briefly with the idea that it was Sherlock who was the danger (he was following him around London, asked him to move in on no further information other than his name) before discounting it.  Why would anyone want to attack him?  It may be slightly sad, but living the solitary, regimented life he had been doing made him very low-risk for premeditated crime, there being very few people who knew he existed at all.  More telling about his concerns however was the fact he never thought about calling Sherlock and telling him he wasn’t moving in.
“This man drove the taxi that John and I took here,” he said, nearly stabbing the image on the tablet.
.  However, when his friend’s panicked voice spoke over the line, hurrying over a brief description which basically amounted to ‘John gone, need help’.  Then Sherlock had instructed him to look round Regent’s Park and promptly hung up with a quick thank you.  It was this thank you that had been the most worrying of all and was the thing that had Victor rolling out of bed and running over to the nearest bus stop.
He didn’t mean to do it.
) and, of course, things could be worse.  For example, at least he was no longer in danger of being abducted by Moriarty and made to do his bidding for the rest of his life.  At least things were better than that.  However, there were some things that made him feel...unsettled.
John tried not to look amused.  “Perfect gorgeous.  Just perfect.”  He returned the kiss on the forehead.  “Sleep now sweetheart.  I’ll be right here.”
However, as much as he wished to stay in bed and fall asleep again, he couldn't ignore the fact that he was really very uncomfortably sticky and really needed a shower.  So, as carefully as he could, he extracted himself from underneath Sherlock and crept out of the room.
“You shouldn’t be flying at a crime scene.”
He loped back up to the roof and took off towards Barts.
“Nothing!”
not a psychopath or serial killer?” John asked Mrs Hudson and she chuckled.
actually) which he only ended after he had reassurances that John would head-off any attempt by Mrs Hudson to move, dust, empty, bleach or in any way touch or change his experiments without Sherlock’s explicit consent.  John had done valiantly in this effort for several weeks now and a truce of sorts had seemed to be issued.  Until today.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, frowning.  He was probably upset that he had said goodbye to his- his
He stumbled out of the shower in much the same way as he stumbled into it, feeling slightly more exhausted than when he went in.  He wandered back into his room and glanced at the clock.  7:30am.  Only 11 and a half hours to go.
“Maybe.”
“Of course, she’s able, she’d still breathing, she hasn’t fainted, she talked two seconds ago,” Sherlock snapped.
“Hey, you nearly didn’t let me speak because of it.  Go finish it.”
"Really?"  He could feel himself blushing.
Apart from he was.
obvious.  It became a Friday tradition of sorts.  Sometimes he was there, the same pose as the first time.  Sometimes he was typing on his phone furiously before storming off like a sublime hurricane.  Sometimes he was not there at all.  These were the worst days.  These were the days the barista made a special effort to be nice to him ie actually smiling at him.  He couldn’t tell whether he preferred that look or the amused knowing one that was shot his way most of the time.
The calm only needed to last four more days.
John slammed his book shut, looking round in panic.  When his eyes locked with Sherlock’s he relaxed marginally and smiled, but the odd panic still pinched at the corner of his eyes.  His arm remained over his book.  Sherlock walked around the bench and sat in his usual spot, pretending everything was normal.  It was still normal.  It was fine.
He leant against the front door, the grooves digging into his back. He screwed his eyes shut as he simply stopped, palms flat against the wood as it hit him.
Sherlock looked at him out the corner of his eye.  “Wouldn’t blame you if you did.  It’s a logical conclusion to draw.”  Sherlock admitting that someone other than him could reach the logical conclusion about something.  Well, there always has to be a first time for everything.
This was not a lack of feeling.
He watched as Lestrade half turned, surveying the scene.  Trying to work out where they were, his brain helpfully provided.  “And Moriarty was-”
“His back.  They hurt from where his wings were removed.
“What am I then?”  What did Sherlock see when he looked at him?
, he was trying to see where he fit into this new world.  The worry was what if he didn’t fit at all?
John woke with a start, mid-fall of the sofa.  He caught himself but the force sent a jolt of pain up his left arm.  Moriarty’s voice was still ringing in his ears.  He closed his eyes.
“Well then,” Sherlock said, drawing himself up, “Here. We. Go.”
“John?”
Sherlock dismissed the not-John.  Now that his brain was back online, it was shuffling the strands back into order and rising again to a fever pitch.  He needed more information.  Data.  Input.  There were too many variables at play and too much he didn’t know and each fact he didn’t
Doubt crept in.  Perhaps he had miscalculated.  Perhaps John was injured, F.A. bleeding out of him on the living room floor while he was here prating around on a closed underground station with faulty lighting.
“CCTV.”  He pushed Lestrade, whose chair rolled so far, he had to grab onto the end of the desk to stop himself flying into a wall.
“And you’re willing to trust me despite the fact John has been kidnapped?  Some would call that foolish,” he said, scrubbing a hand through his hair.  “You’re not worried I’m going to fail?  I thought you and John were…close colleagues?  Surely you’d want to take a lead on this.”
floor and through the corridor.  The inside matched the outside in its run-down atmosphere.  The lack of working lights darkened the hallway, giving the impression that it was the dead of night, rather than mid-morning.
quicker than Broadgate and John couldn’t help the thrill he felt as he vigilantly and carefully made his way over to work.
“No, you see, John Watson doesn’t say things are ‘good’.  Things can be fine, things can be brilliant, things can be okay, things can be terrible.  Never simply good.  So when you use the word ‘good’, you know what I think?  I think, John Watson is hiding something that is bothering him which is slowly eating him up inside until he’s too emotionally constipated to talk to anyone.  That is what is happening when you use the word good.”
“Ugh,” John said, scrunching up his face, “it’s not for uni exactly.  I promised Becca at
Greg had surprisingly expressive eyebrows.  At the moment, they were broadcasting ‘John you are an actual idiot’.  Then Greg said “John, you are an actual idiot.  What if he’s dangerous?”
John waited awkwardly listening to the indistinct voices on the other end of the line and decided to go sit in his chair rather than leaning against the countertop.
“I know.  But I don’t.”
“Did Lestrade film some of yesterday?”  His voice was scratchy and deep, and John had to repress a shiver.
“Okay.  You aren’t allowed to talk to anyone else either.  Ever again.  For the rest of time.”  Sherlock nodded, pleased at his above point.  He had made some great points.  John would have to be his forever now.
“I’m sure you’ll think of something.  John, are you alright?” Sherlock said, trying to sound casual.
“Sherlock.  Come on.  Surely you’ve noticed everyone in this place checking you out?”  He then added silently ‘But hopefully are still unaware of the person sitting across from you checking you out’.
This was how he managed to pull the fire alarm and slip into the various offices, whistling his way through the corridors.  The security cameras could be dealt with later and by someone other than him.
“Irish Red Setter.  Easy.”  John was now sporting a very amused grin.  “Did I pass?”
“Okay, have fun.  I’ll see you later then?”
“And why’s that?”
“If you need anything more, you know where to find me.”
“This man,” Angleo said, dragging Sherlock into a side-hug, “let me tell you, I owe everything to him!  He saved me from a murder charge!”
“Yes, I noticed that,” Sherlock said and Victor grinned.  “So you know what I was doing here but what about you?”
Damn.  “Drink?”
Mrs Hudson must have used his absence to clear the bomb site that was their living room.  This was evident in the fact that the floor was actually visible, there were no longer a variety of mugs all containing cold tea, and the spectre on the sofa had a blanket thrown over him to stop his feet from getting cold.  He hadn’t moved since the last time John saw him.  Well, hadn’t until a packet of biscuits dropped on his head.
This meant he did not need to go back to anymore classes.
,” he jabbed a finger at Sherlock, “to tell me everything.  And for
“Thought you were done nagging,” John joked.
A new pair of pyjamas thrown on, he slouched into the living room and rolled himself onto the sofa.  Only his mind palace would be of any use today but on the other hand he didn’t want to get so lost in his own head he would either a) have a repeat of this morning or b) miss the date entirely.
When she had left, muttering under her breath, he texted John.  Sometimes you just had to listen to your landlady.  Mainly because he was worried she would genuinely kick him out if he did not.
Johnson simply sighed.  "Look you know how people say you should drink responsibly? Tonight I really don’t know if that's going to work out for you.  So, you either keep sober enough to keep yourself from strangling everyone who goes near him
She held her hand out.  In it, he placed a roll of money and a slip of paper.
“Kick it,” was Sherlock’s helpful advice.  He wanted to argue that it wasn’t as simple as that and that it was improbable he would be able to, but they were running out of options and he feared arguments would be met with stubborn insistence or worse, Sherlock trying himself.  John sighed, propped him up against the opposite wall and went to see if it
“I can have friends.  I have friends!” John didn’t mean to shout but the looks the girls down the corridor gave him proved he might want to tone it down a bit.
John couldn’t help but laugh.  “You’ve made that abundantly clear.  That’s why I’m worrying about you instead.”  And in that moment, Sherlock’s lips twisted the other way, a small smile.  Contemplated saying something.  Thought better of it.  Changed his mind.
“You always were an unconventional one.  And you are?” John tried not to flinch as attention turned to him.
John was speaking oddly.  Stilted.  He was also wearing a green duffel coat, about two sizes too large for him, which Sherlock had never seen before.
“Jesus,” John rolled his eyes which made Sherlock laugh and the tension fell from his shoulders.  “Right, we have to stop this now.  You want to look online like normal people?”  Sherlock nodded, and John dragged him out the shop and away from the monstrosity.  The fact it took them at least another 40 minutes to find their way out was made more bearable by the fact that Sherlock didn’t let go of him until they were back in the safety of the flat.
Sherlock grumbled and was stubbornly going to try again when his felt John’s teeth graze his neck.  His head fell back slightly with a whimper as John gently licked and kissed first the right, then the left side of his neck and his hand rose to John’s hair, both encouraging and steadying himself as soft, involuntary noises fell from his lips.  John nipped at the juncture between his neck and shoulder and Sherlock felt him chuckle at the hiss it produced.
The two floor journey was agony.  Sherlock pressed himself into the corner opposite to John, as if trying to meld with the glass.  John watched him, his frowning for a few seconds, before hesitantly asking, “Are you okay?”
In explanation, Sherlock muttered, “He’s not going to get anywhere with him.”
Sherlock cut in.  “We need to save John and possibly the world as we know it.”  Lestrade’s dramatic outburst was apparently catching.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” John grinned as Sherlock stuck his tongue.
“Here to give you a message aren’t I?”
They talk for a while, about the party, about classes, about the people around them.  Kate introduced him to Mark who lived next door to her and John reluctantly agreed that perhaps he was being overly anxious about this socialising lark and was, however reluctantly, having a good time.
.  Mind-Palace John was still working then.  He was still disapproving.  So long as the others didn’t appear.  Especially
in it.  He glanced in his rear-view mirror at the pair of them crammed into the back.  He conceded they did look oddly sweet, the Fallen sharply focussed on the outside world, body tense, apart from the gentle arm he had around John.  It had migrated from the opposing side when John had tipped into sleep and ended up with his face pressed up against Sherlock’s shoulder, his nose nearly pressed up against Sherlock’s neck.
John smirked.  “Liar,” he said.
Mallory pointed behind him.  “I heard you talking.  There’s only one set of F.A.  If there were two people, there would be two sets of F.A. and two origins of the splinter marks, but there’s only one.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, sensing that something was off with Victor’s manner.  He wasn’t exactly tense but when contrasted with his usual laid-back posture, the effect was still quite large.  His eyes were also flickering, assessing the people surrounding them and it was starting to put Sherlock on edge.  This problem, whatever it was, was clearly bothering Victor a great deal.
John heaved a melodramatic sigh which he felt even Sherlock would have been impressed by.  “Fine.  I promise not to forget your birthday present.”
“I don’t often listen to should and shouldn’t.”
Could rain.
“Promise,” John said, kissing him sweetly once more, before moving down to his chest, peppering kisses down Sherlock’s body before nuzzling into his stomach, just above the waistband of his trousers.  He hesitated, glancing up with one hand hovering at the first button.  Sherlock nodded.
That couldn’t be a coincidence.
“Yes you said at the beginning.”  Rude.  Backtrack, backtrack, backtrack!  “But yes, I am new here.  I’m Sherlock,” he said sticking his hand out.  It took him roughly six seconds to realise that a) he did not normally shake hands with people and b) his hands were really gross after an hour-long workout and he did not want his first impression to be of a rude man who couldn’t breathe properly and had sweaty hands.  Unfortunately, this was 4 seconds too late to do anything about as John had already grasped his hand.  He even had the courtesy not to wipe his hand on his top afterwards.
Despite his stockiness, John knew he could be quick, and he channelled that into a game he liked to call “Don’t let the target get to the end of the street”.  John found he was surprisingly good at this game, leaping and rugby tackling the figure sideways just before the end, just as Sherlock swung into view.  Ah, he was going to cut him off from this side, trapping the guy in the alley.  That made sense, John thought as he dragged the target’s hands behind his back and sat on him for good measure.  Speedy, yet surprisingly dense.  The target struggled for a bit before settling into his fate.
“Yep,” Lestrade nodded as he nudged Sherlock out the way of his chair.  “All overdoses on a new type of steroids that’s making the rounds.”
it.  We need to get John, this is turned
“It was discovered about an hour ago so it’s still pretty live.  Be careful,” he warned.
That person was the brunette he had spotted checking out John earlier.  She introduced herself as “Clarissa.”  Sherlock hated Clarissa and her stupid pretty face and her stupid interesting job as a doctor in an A&E department which John took interest in and asked
?’ motion for them to take off running.  Yes he should probably arrest and question them but at the end of the day what would that achieve?  It was only a bit of graffiti, so let them run.
“Sherlock’s in them this time.”
“Of course, but it’s no good telling him that.  Why he thought this was a good plan in the first place is beyond me,” Sherlock muttered, his eyes already flicking down the short list.
John’s lips twitched, as if he wanted to grin.  "Sherlock I've had three years of waiting without you around to think this through.  I think that's enough time to figure out what I want, don’t you?"
, and he had fallen asleep on a stakeout.  So really, it wasn’t his fault that he shot up and nearly head-butted Sherlock in the nose on the way.
“I wouldn’t phrase it quite like that-” John started to backtrack but was interrupted.
To distract himself, he peered further into the alley.  He knew he couldn’t go further in without back-up, the shadows making him too much of target, at the mercy of whoever may be at the opposite side.  However, from what he could see it was a regular alleyway, no nefarious plots, underworld cults, or black-bedecked wings in sight.  Unable to single-handedly take down whatever it was they were chasing, he decided he should probably stand out in the street to flag down the gang.
Oli simply nodded, seeming relaxed.  Sherlock was not.
“Not yet.  The kids you brought in only mentioned they’d heard it from some friends who heard it from their friends who had a cousin who’s best friend dog bumped into someone...” Greg trailed off, gesturing with his hands that the list went on for several hours and still no root had been found.  One disadvantage with the afterlife was that the sheer size of the place meant things started to spiral quickly.  If they didn’t control it now, it was unlikely they would ever reign in the chaos completely.
“What do you see?” Sherlock asked quietly.  He hadn’t moved, only indicating he’d spoken with a sly look at John.
.  This seemed to mollify whatever was bothering Sherlock and he did the small, not-smiling thing.  He hunkered down a little more, tucking John tighter to his side, resting his head ever-so-gently on the top of John’s.
“He didn’t take on a new identity.  He’s used to living on the streets, he had no need to blend in with the populous or pass any scanners that would pick him up.  I’m working on reaching him, to get a list.”
“Soul Pattern Recognition,” she said to John and he nodded.  SPR software could be used in conjunction with the G.O.D to confirm identities.  It was usually used for incoming souls rather than outgoing though.  “I’m part of the logging-in team here,” she explained and suddenly her presence here in the middle of the night made sense.  After all, dying didn’t exactly have office hours.
When she left he retrieved the presents from where he’d stashed them in his wardrobe, one of the few places Gladstone never learnt to get into.  Gladstone
Black moleskin, a birthday present from Sherlock himself.
Maybe Sherlock was onto something.  John Watson looked like he hadn’t slept.  He was slumped on a bench, clutching a to-go coffee, hair ruffled, still in the clothes he was in yesterday and was a general mess.
“It’s not there.”
Sherlock focussed his attention back on Molly.  “People of interest.”
?” he hissed.
Sherlock stood blinking for several seconds.  “Really?”
There were many techniques employed.  Some used the newbies or the tech department who were unfamiliar with Sherlock’s ....
John was cut off by the Fallen’s response.  “I didn’t steal it.”  John was starting to feel that he should simply keep an eyebrow raised during this conversation, as he looked slowly from the Fallen’s now affronted face to the arm and back to his eyes.  Was this what other people felt talking to him?  He had some apologies to make.
weird?
She was huddled in a big duffel coat despite the clement weather and had her hair pinned back into two smaller buns on the side of her head.  The doorway behind her was boarded up, the shop dark.  He shrugged at her comment, leaning against the wall next to her.
It was only when they were outside Sherlock’s room that John started to doubt his amazing plan was actually amazing and started thinking it may have been the worst decision he had ever made.  But before he could retreat into his own room and forget the entire thing, Mike was knocking on the door and staring at John with a peaceful look that said ‘You asked for this.  This was entirely your idea.  You idiot.’  John hated that look.  He was also very familiar with that look.
.  “Three.  Do you understand?”  Something twingeed in the back of his mind.  That number, it was significant, how was it significant and-oh.
“Just- oh my god.”
"Why on earth would I want that?" Sherlock interrupted, now scowling.
on you?” John’s felt anger spike through him.  What an invasion of privacy.  Sherlock smiled indulgently back at him.
“Always.”
“Not what I was getting at but good to know.  What I
Sherlock replied at a normal volume, inspecting the flat lazily.  “We’ve already broken and entered.  And don’t worry, the people run the shop downstairs, they’ve no reason to-“
He was being ridiculous.
“John,” Sherlock tried to say but his mouth was momentarily not connected to his brain.
Tv for example.  Apparently it had been quite a surprise when both Sherlock and Mycroft had lost track of John, leading to lots of yelling, accusations of kidnapping and a two-person man hunt, only to find him curled up on the sofa, watching an old spy movie.
(Also I can't believe I'm uploading this while I'm supposed to be at work but my supervisor isn't here and there's literally nothing esle going on)
“Why not?”
His ears were ringing and he couldn’t turn back.  It felt like something had shattered and he couldn’t breathe properly and they needed to get out of this bar right now.
“You are an enigma John Watson,” he declared, which stunned John momentarily.  It was difficult to see if this was intended as a compliment, and if it was, it was certainly one of the oddest he’d received.  He found himself fairly straightforward.
He shrugged.  “Unimportant.”
“I merely pointed out Lestrade is impressed with good work and that helping solve this case would constitute good work.”
His hopes were soon dashed.
The left-side door rattled.  He had a moment to decide if he should dive out of another door or hide behind a shelf.
Sherlock sighed.  “We’ve always been one step behind.  Lestrade’s shown that with his faulty logic.  Just because we happen to find crime scene and symbol together does not necessarily mean they’re connected in that way, it’s only one explanation, one created without all the facts.”  He sounded like he was explaining things to a toddler.  “We’ve been working backwards.  However, with
It was at this point Sherlock made his first mistake.  He took the case.
Sherlock fought a smile.  “I hate it when your sensible.”
“Well there we are then.  Drive yourself mad with hypotheticals or get some solid answers and then head back here when you’re ready.”
There were some minor changes, of course there would be. The haphazard stacks of paper had been moved, the books were all present on the shelves instead of strewn about the floor, the kitchen table was clean and free of science equipment.
“What?”
There was a polite cough from the doorway.  Sherlock would have been happy to ignore it but John pulled back reluctantly, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s nose first.  He looked towards the door, a faux-polite smile on his lips.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow.  “I know a version of events.  I feel that even with my powers, I have only scratched the surface.”
As he was leaving Barts, he’d reconvened with Greg who said the Fallen had simply said “Brother did it.  Prank gone wrong” and then walked off.  So they returned to Damien’s flat, got a medic to reattach his arm, asked a few questions, went to question the brother, and fuck if Sherlock wasn’t right.
landlady?”
John burst into giggles.  It was the combination of the question, the indignant tone, and the adrenaline rush which sent him over the edge, and as the adrenaline took the wheel, he worked himself into near hysteria.  It was the sort of laughing you couldn’t stop even if you wanted to.  He caught Sherlock’s eye mid-laugh, which set the detective to chuckling which evolved so he was in the same state of John.  Each time one of them seemed to calm down, the other set them right off again, until Mrs Hudson appeared demanding to know if they had finally lost it.  When they waved her away with a ‘It’s nothing Hudders, sorry for the noise’, they managed to get a hold of themselves.
There was a pause after this.  Sherlock seemed to be struggling to say something, his mouth opening and closing as the words refused to come out.  Clearly they were at the crux of the conversation.  It looked like he was going to give up entirely when he finally choked out: “He seems...happy?  Now?”  He was staring resolutely out the window now, not the focus of before but the determined stare of someone ignoring absolutely everything surrounding him.
“Oh.”  Lestrade fell from his hunched position.  Sherlock looked over at him.  Ah.  He and John were friends.  This would be upsetting.  He didn’t have any words, between his own emotions over-spilling and his lack of social etiquette knowledge, so he simply leaned over until his shoulder rested on Lestrade’s.  Solidarity, in the place of comfort.  Words would be useless anyway.
But first, to find Greg and return an arm.
Deep breath.  Click on the link.
The detective refused to meet his eye and kept pouting.  They had been in IKEA for 40 minutes.   It felt more like 6 days, but John’s watch insisted it was under an hour.
“Guard training and my delightful personality see me through.  Also, an industrial amount of coffee and almost constant insomnia doesn’t hurt.”  Lestrade turned to grin at him but the permanent bags under his eyes had sunken since yesterday.  Outside was still dark and the street empty.
After a while, Lestrade leaned back in his chair and, as if pulled by a counterweight, Sherlock sat up.  John, who had become increasingly bored and had zoned out, pulled his attention back into the room opposite.
Eleven
“Stay here.  Both of you,” he said, glaring meaningfully at John.  Sherlock’s scowl deepened even further.  John didn’t want to know what he would be persuaded into.  Probably questioning the suspect while Sherlock ran him questions telepathically, or distracting Lestrade while breaking Sherlock in through the ceiling.
“Seems to be doing just fine here.  Perhaps it was the company that put him off,” John retorted, hands flexing into fists.
To mollify the detective, John looked at the photo and proceeded to nearly drop the phone.  The spiralling cracks formed a symbol.
"Victor!" Sherlock shouted, scandlised, flushing even darker red but not letting go of John's hips.
“Aren’t I always?”
He edged them carefully out of the room and on a whim decided to go left. It would be difficult to navigate them out without the detective’s sure-footed abilities.  However, considering John was carrying the weight of two of them, he figured Sherlock wouldn’t mind taking a slightly scenic route.
This was how John found himself ringing the only person who could talk some sense into him.
“It’s not illegal to go for a walk is it?”  He wasn’t sure why he wasn’t just telling him the truth.
“Hello Angelo,” Sherlock said, cutting off a hug by throwing his hand out for a handshake instead.  Angelo’s grip was crushing because of his excitement and he was bouncing around like a puppy.  It was slightly embarrassing but also bolstering: it was strange but nice for people to be rooting for them so much already.
There was a chorus of “Hi John” from a few in the crowd and some others stood up straighter.  Sherlock was midway through a thought of
Sherlock smiled and pressed their lips back together briefly.  “Then yes I think I do fancy him quite a bit.  But
If he found John, he was going to say a plethora of things: that he was happy he was alive, that the world was better with him in it, that everything was going to be okay, that Sherlock would make sure everything would be okay.  But never, ever was he going to mention the feeling that had spread across his chest, into his fingers and down to his toes, filling him up with a sense of safety and giddiness and brightness.
“I really have no idea why I love you,” Sherlock sighed after he’d asked the cab to return them to Baker Street.
There had only been a few times over the past few weeks that John’s shoulder really gave him trouble. It was always at night, when the flat grew unusually cold, the old building not having proper insulation and the weather in this Other London being as unpredictable as the original.  The pain would often jolt him out of a nightmare, mixing with it horribly, the tangle of physical and imagined disorientating him.  He’d stay still for a minute, gathering the will to sit up.  Painkillers were kept close to the bed, so he would down two.  Shove slippers and dressing gown on, trudge downstairs.  Boil the kettle and shove the heating pack in the microwave.  Sherlock had, on two of these occasions, been fluttering around the living room, often with violin in hand.  They hadn’t spoken, although the first time Sherlock did raise a questioning eyebrow at the heating pack.  It wasn’t John’s fault they only had the pig design left, and not that it was any of Sherlock’s business, the soft pig’s ears were quite nice to run his fingers over, the repetitive motion soothing.  What John actually did was half shrug with his good side and slump into his chair, kneading the aching joint occasionally.  Sherlock had turned to his music stand and begun to play, though John did not believe he really needed to look at the music.  Then, when his eyes began to droop uncontrollably, and his shoulder had relaxed, he would stand up and shuffle off to bed again.  Sherlock had the uncanny ability to finish his piece just before this moment, and as he made his way to the stairs there was always a quiet “Good night John” following him.  Despite arising from such annoying and painful causes, it was one of John’s favourite times in the flat.
He flicked over to the next tab.  Another of picture of him on another rooftop, simply a murky outline against the dark.  He skimmed through the other tabs.  All in all 12 pictures of the Victoria Vigilante.  His first thought was where the hell were these people getting these from?  The url was from a fan-website, people tracking vigilantes from across the world.  Most people shared theories, rumours and possible sightings.  His second thought was that this meant Sherlock was definitely onto him.
crime scene and Sherlock wanting to rant for several minutes on the fact Lestrade was wasting time.  Lestrade broke first, sighing, then crossing his arms.  Sherlock took this as a sign he would finally take him seriously.
John almost smiled again.  “That’s not it, and I don’t know whether it is sweet you would defend me from a murder charge or worrying you had that ready to go.”  He paused, mouth twisting back into a frown.  He addressed his hands rather than looking at Sherlock.  “The actual problem is the lack of wings and the fact I don’t have my powers anymore.  Something about the jump, it means I’m not an angel anymore.  And if you’re not an angel, you can’t go back through the portal.”
His eyes fluttered open with a soft gasp.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, hands clutched in the sheets, his erection persistent and heavy across his stomach.  He laid there, feeling his heart pounding in his chest, trying to get his bearings.  It was a dream.  It had just been a dream.  He was
John sighed and stalked over to where Sherlock had finished harassing everyone and was peering into the foot-well of the driver’s seat.  He was not avoiding the question.  It was just inappropriate.  Obviously.
4) he was trapped in a room full of people with an irresistible John Watson and absolutely no way of showing to anyone that he was taken.
“I’ve known John longer than you have and he wouldn’t just disappear unless something was wrong.  So what did you do?”
But then the pressure on his hip and the mouth was gone and Sherlock groaned in frustration. Sherlock hadn’t realised his eyes were screwed shut until he opened them again, a demand on the tip of his tongue. It quickly turned into a moan as John tugged at his earlobe with his teeth. He just caught the whispered “Two” over the sound of his own panting.
They only had to go 2 streets away to find the cafe where Jake was working.  As it was on a slightly busier road, they entered just as a mid-morning rush was occurring and so they went to sit at a table and wait.
It was now or never.
“Well you’re still wrong.”
“Go on then.  What is it now?”
“What happens if I don’t stop, seeing as the only thing preventing me is a word from
His hand dropped to his side.  As he looked around the living room, his heart ached.  He needed to know what was on the other side,
“Yes.  Okay.  Oh, and Molly?”
“One,” he tried and failed to suppress his smile which only grew as Sherlock frowned in confusion.  But then he didn’t have time to work out what the hell John was on about because they were kissing again and he didn’t care about anything else in the world.  Nothing at all mattered more than the feel of John’s lips on his, John’s tongue sweeping over his, John’s hands gently brushing his hair, soothing it down after it’s rough treatment.  He groaned as John began sucking at his bottom lip which turned to a whine as John pulled back,
It was not the receptionist fault and so, before Sherlock could start, Lestrade dragged him out to the corridor with a rushed “thank you”.
“Whatever you’ve found better be good.  I was going to have a nap.”
“That would only work if you didn’t run off every two seconds.  I’d probably go home, thinking you were on the chase.  It’d be days before I sent someone out looking for you.”
“Plus, I like bossing people about,” John agreed laughing, instantly relaxing.
But eventually,
Sherlock was less slow in waking up, his mind powering up in only a few moments. However he didn’t make any attempt to move, partially because he was very comfortable but mainly because he was struck by the odd sensation that this was not his bedroom. He twisted slightly to get a better view and was much relieved to notice he was still within 221B. Then he was struck with the new sensation of being panicked because he was still within 221B. Which meant this was John’s room. The same John who he’d been watching for the past few months.  Oh God, he’d done something, hadn’t he?
He thought the distraction might help him slip away but alas, Lestrade regarded him suspiciously.  “And what will you be doing while we become buried under case files?”
Sherlock looked around.  They were indeed out of the reception area and instead on the landing outside the lifts.  The wall he was propped against was glass and London Above rattled on, oblivious to Sherlock’s world crashing around his ears.
Sherlock turned on Lestrade, who took a step back.  “Have you identified the victim yet?”
“Err, yes!  Yes, fine.  Good.  You… good,” he said, gesturing to John pining the target.  John frowned in concern, so Sherlock continued.  “Where’s…” he floundered for a minute before John realised who he was talking about.
Sherlock who was in front of them and speaking.
“You got out of the shower 10 minutes ago but there were no noises indicating you were getting changed.  Also you were muttering quite loudly and the walls are thin.”  The flat tone suggested Sherlock was on the cusp of his Mind Palace, not quite enveloped yet but not all together tethered in reality.
“Please?”
“I’m waiting for-“
Sherlock leaned in, so they were impossibly close, his lips nearly brushing John’s ear.  For a wild second John thought he was genuinely going to kiss him until he spoke softly.
Sherlock grumbled but nodded.  “Thank you,” he said, not looking directly at John.
Lestrade pulled his sleeve and twisted him away from Molly.  “Sherlock.  What are you doing?”
“So, take a breath, and tell me what we’re going to do.”
“I think you might be in danger.”  John sat up straighter in his chair, eyes flickering over the café.  There was only one obvious source.
Sherlock did as he was told.  He clenched his hands into fists so they would stop shaking, gritted his teeth.  He thought of John as Lestrade counted down.
Sherlock shook his head.  “Dyes taste differently.”
“So, what
“I just popped in for a chat with Mrs Turner when I saw him.  Young lad, bolted before anyone could grab him.”  Sherlock was grateful to note she had heeded his warning about unnecessary details in her storytelling.
He would deny, until his dying breath, until the last part of his soul was plucked from his body, until the universe collapsed in on itself and the world was finished, that his first thought upon seeing the instructor was a suggestive
This was not what Sherlock was expecting.  “Why?”
“Didn’t you say Mike collects the strange and outcast?”
“Yeah, no, we’ve gone over that point already,” John said, becoming exasperated.
"Demoted to acquaintance," Sherlock's lips quirked into a smirk.
John gasped for breath, the energy gone, the sense of spiralling fading away until he was fully back in reality.
“We still don’t know the significance of the symbol either,” Lestrade added. “Or why they ditched the car,” John said.  He couldn't tell who looked more upset about this lack of an answer, Sherlock or Lestrade.
“Anything I can do?”
to those less desirable, I was brought on to consult with the Guards at the most senior level.  This began to get tedious and I took on my own cases as well.  History over.”
Both Victor and the other boy stopped outside flat number 16 and turned to look at him.  Sherlock had the quick, panic driven thought that he had misjudged Victor entirely and was about to get either kidnapped or murdered.
“Fine,” he said, grabbing the pen and scribbling down a few names.  “Now I’ve got to get back to work.”  With that he strode off towards to the kitchens and disappeared.
about Mallory and his enthusiasm.  “Once again, don’t need to call me sir.  Okay, so victim is Barry Faber, only been here 10 years, no priors, lives a few streets over on Devonshire Road.  So far nothing’s been flagged up in relation to him.”  He passed the tablet over to Sherlock who scrolled through before stilling completely, wings high, as if suspended in flight.
“Fuck Off,” the man snarled.
Sherlock made a ‘tsk’ noise, focus now entirely on the screen.  “Now let’s see if you’ve been clever,” he muttered under his breath, as he navigated to the right system.  Started his search at Baker Street.  His breath caught as he saw John stepping out the front door.  He knew he’d been in trouble, knew that John had been embroiled in this since the beginning for reasons he couldn’t work out and still he’d let him leave.  If only he’d been watching, paying attention this morning, then maybe...
John then reassessed when he too emerged from the stairs.  The yellow paint was stark against the white, as obvious as the sign from across the road.  It was an address.
“Wanted you too,” he managed to gasp back.  “Just fucking touch me.”
He’d failed.
“I-I love you,” Sherlock muttered, as if he didn’t expect John to hear.
The worst thing about the whole affair was that Molly definitely Knew and was not going to let him get away with self-denial for much longer.
The fourth moment, Sherlock leaned down and brushed their lips together, trying to say what his words could not express because for some reason it felt imperative John knew exactly that he was
.  That barista for instance.  Not a likely target to be a Fallen in disguise but on the other hand, gave a good view of the alleyway and tube station, could work odd hours, shift work so they probably only needed a week’s notice and if they didn’t turn up one day they could be replaced.  Someone getting suspicious?  Kill a guy, put on a new face, and go to work.
“Yeah no.  It’s definitely you.”
“So what do we do now?” the Senior Guard asked, restraining himself from yelling at the Fallen by the slimmest of margins.  Sherlock evaluated for a second.  It was annoying, yes, but this move wasn’t entirely unexpected.  The speed was the interesting part.  Had they taken it down a few hours ago or minutes?  As for next moves, there were two obvious avenues to follow.
“Straight down the hallway, door at the end,” Sherlock said, taking the opportunity to nuzzle into John’s neck, kissing and biting at the bit of collarbone left exposed.  His legs must be longer as their torsos were surprisingly well matched.  That being said, he still felt slightly like he was entirely made of limbs, but John kept him pulled close as he moved with ease down the corridor and into his bedroom.
“No, we haven’t which is why I find the face so irritating.”
“I believe telling someone they are being distracted is a perfect way not to distract them.”  Molly stuck her tongue out at him.  He sighed at her theatrics.  However, he wasn’t despairing as much as he had a few moments ago.  As she started to work, anxiety crept back up to occupy the space.  If he was wrong about this, if he’d made a misstep, calculated wrong or misjudged a motivation, then this could all come crashing down.  He slumped down so his chin rested on his folded arms.  There was also the question of what to do if Molly’s research confirmed his theory.  Despite his earlier assertions, knowing he was right wasn’t going to help John much on its own, and if he played it wrong then it could put him in more danger.  Delicacy was not his forte.
“Oh,” was all he could manage to say.  Well that was short-lived.  And he’d said such sweet things.  Foolish to believe him really.  He stood, intending to run and hide somewhere in the house.
“Yes. Obviously.”
“Awww you came to me for advice.  A horrible decision but very sweet.”  Molly then went quiet.  Sherlock appreciated that she was taking this question seriously rather than treating him to the “be yourself” nonsense.
A petite woman stood in the doorway of an office.  She didn’t look very threatening: mousy brown hair was pulled up into a pony tail, a candyfloss pink cardigan peaked out behind her lab-coat.  Despite the late hour, the coffee mug in her hand suggested her day was only just beginning.
Gladstone huffed and then leapt down from the sofa to go and get his lead because clearly everyone had forgotten the real reason they were there.  Clearly you could never trust a man to do a dog’s job.
“You can’t just use people as bait!”
As soon as the guy was within reaching distance, John struck.
“Right.  I need
“I have my own issues to resolve Mycroft,” he muttered.
However, Sherlock knew this lack of privacy was getting to him.
John scrunched his hands into fists.  “You’re being rude.”
Sherlock sounded amused.  “Oh I’m sure.  Everyone, meet Raz.”  John and Lestrade snapped their attention to him and then glanced at each other.
“Still getting into trouble I see,” Sherlock said.
Get home.
“I guess you could call it a hobby?  I needed something to focus on when I got back and I couldn’t
Although he was awake and in control of his mind once more, this didn’t seem to make any difference to the arousal coursing through his veins, to the strain of
Sherlock’s lips were soft, if a little dry, and it was perfect, just perfect and sweet and John could have stayed like that forever.  The tension he had been feeling melted away under his touch and it was suddenly not enough and he needed to be closer, needed to feel more.  But then Sherlock pulled back, only a little, and rumbled, actually
He ruffled his feathers and drew up to his full height.  “Well.  To move on, we need to solve the case.”
“How did you forget his name?” John sighed, exasperated.
know I have a date?”
, he lied to himself.  He didn’t enjoy the class, he didn’t enjoy the stupid music and he definitely didn’t enjoy being under the steady, calm instruction of an ex-army captain who looked
John snorted a small laugh.  “I was in the army Greg.”
“Errr I mean, I um,
“Well yes, and that.  I’m fairly certain you’re not a psychopath or a serial killer, which I have to say is quite disappointing but apparently makes for good flatmates.  You know Mike.  This seems like a good compromise.”
This was prevented by knowing the person he had bumped into.
Sherlock reluctantly pouted but agreed.  “Later.”
He didn’t know he felt like crying until the tears were already falling down his cheeks.  Which was stupid.  It was just a boy after all.
It wasn’t that John would show just anyone.  As far as Sherlock was aware, he was one of only few to get to see them but once the book was open, it was fully open.
“Can we help you?” he said.
“And John?  If you have another nightmare, either tell Sherlock or call me.  You don’t have to do this alone mate.”
“I am!”
Which is why things happened as they happened.
“Goodbye Mycroft.”
A figure inside who John recognised.
“And yet you will have to indulge mine for a moment,” he said, standing up.  “Or are you planning on living under a bridge while you become acquainted with the world?”
Sherlock may have been exaggerating slightly.
Raz scrunched up his face.  Sherlock kept staring.
“Sherlock?”
“John.  John open the door.
Sherlock sighed.  He appeared to be doing that a lot today.
"Hello John.  Hello John's friends.  Come on in," she said, turning back into the house with smirk on her red lips and heading towards the stairs.
Sally sighed in exasperation when she saw the black cab pull up opposite.  It seemed her few Sherlock-free days were over.  She didn’t know where the consultant had been but so long as he wasn’t around, she was fairly happy just to get on with her work for once.
"No," Sherlock said slowly, as if he were talking to an incredibly stupid person which did nothing to alleviate Johns mood, "We're talking about last night, I was admitting I had no issue forgetting about it and then you started talking about your feelings which I had assumed but it appears my assumptions may be incorrect."
This was what he tried to tell Greg when he mentioned, casually, that he was moving.
“Why do you love me?” Sherlock said.  “How can you know for definite that you do?”
“Sherlock, sorry to jump in but Jake’s been attacked.”
“What?” Victor and John asked simultaneously.
This was not quite what John had imagined meeting Stamford or the Fallen again would have looked like.
He suffered for his art.
Sherlock let out an irritated “Hnnnnnnn” at such a suggestion.  He wouldn’t leave John behind.  Unlike John apparently.
“Because I’m known for my virtue.”
"Invalided?"
His entire body had been turned into a furnace.  Each breath was like fire lancing down his lungs, choking him with each inhale and exhale.  His legs still protested from the burpees earlier.  His arms were burning, each upwards lift of the bar like forcing a locked door to open.  The music tempo was quick, difficult to match with his shoulder blades feeling like rusty steel unwilling to move.
“You said-” John began, unwilling to let the point go because
“Well go on then.”
“They hired you?  To do what?”
Many, many months ago, I made a promise to myself I would finish this fic.  Come hell or high water this fic would be written, no matter how long it took me.
“Yes you will,” Sherlock said, eyes focussed on the paper.
For at least 2 hours (though more likely 3 or,
Sherlock came over his hand and the wall with a barely contained shout.
The other angel stepped forward into a patch of light and John... looked a little.  Just a
“Hmm?” Sherlock said absentmindedly.  “Mike?  No.  There’s someone else we need to see.”
Mycroft was stood in the doorway, with a face that was part-way between a smile and sucking a lemon.  “As pleased as I am that you are... re-acquainted, shall we say, I do require your attention.”
.  He was going to have to have words when the real-John was home.  This inability to think properly was unacceptable and entirely the angel’s fault, his presence being the only change in his life to have real impact.  His mind wandered to the dance floor of that awful club, how he had indulged, just for a second his love of dancing, because it couldn’t hurt the investigation could it, a little bit of dancing?  Seeing John stalk his way towards him and being so close together.  He didn’t really think about personal space but despite being near each other, they never really touched, just ghosted near each other.  Sherlock had wondered though, what it would be like to touch properly, to brush a hand over a hand when walking home, to press knees together in a cab ride, to lean over on the sofa and press his side against the solid form of another.  And then finally he gets his chance and everything falls apart.  Figures.
John very much wanted Lestrade to Stop Talking.  “How are you still so...
“You back again then?”
There was also his Guard checklist, which was not so much as a rule-book but a gut feeling.  Are people acting suspiciously?  Is everything working as it should?  Does everything
It didn't happen.
“And the vigilantism?” Sherlock’s tone was consciously neutral.
He was going on a date with John Watson.
“It was Mrs Hudson,” was the short reply.
“This morning.  In the shower.”  John had started moving down Sherlock’s chest, unbuttoning his shirt and pressing kisses to the skin that was uncovered.
An angel with trendy tinted grey wings, fading to navy tips walked in, ill-fitting suit hanging off his body walked in, flanked by another bouncer.  Maybe a security detail?  This was clealy the manager John had wished to avoid.
the Victoria Vigilante?” he asked incredulously, desperately hoping he was both right and wrong at the same time.
John agreed.  “Not something I want to repeat anytime soon.”
.  John’s face was scrunched up in his usual ‘concentrating’ face and Sherlock felt a rush of fondness which he quickly smothered before John could look up and see it.  Sherlock couldn’t quite understand why he felt the need to do this but assume it was part of some reflex he hadn’t been able to shake off yet.  He’d spent so long controlling his emotions, crafting them to work to his advantage and to never show weakness, that it was still difficult to simply let them express themselves without filter.
to.  What would he even say?  “Hi John, what is your opinion on triple homicides and hunting serial killers for fun?  Want to go out some time and talk about that?”
“Yes, well, they are.  Good I mean.  Very good even.  I’m really very happy actually,” Molly said, sounding both flustered and shy but still meaning every stumbled word.
John cut him off.  He’d already heard the speech before.  “What did you say?”  He felt he already knew.
“You started it!  But sure, I’ll stop being childish and instead we’ll discuss how the cute boy you like but wouldn’t talk to asked you out on a date.”  Even Sherlock couldn’t fail to see she might have a point.  He
A chime as another result came in.
“It’s not
“I have an important task I need you to do.”
“Sorry, you first,” Sherlock said.
went up the stairs.  He
Sherlock’s lips twitched.
John was staring at him, mouth agape, completely shocked.  His hands had slipped from Sherlock’s.
There were other habits too.  Sherlock veered between never eating, running on coffee and will power (“Angels don’t need to sleep John.” “Yes they do.” “Well they shouldn’t.  A fatal design flaw if you ask me.”), and John catching him eating ice cream by the tub out the freezer at 4 in the morning (“I thought you were a burglar!  And eat something that isn’t just sugar, you’ll be bouncing off the walls.”).  There were more body parts, synthetic ones this time, although occasionally a real specimen came through the door and John restrained himself from asking where they had come from.  In the pursuit of cases Sherlock had, in the three weeks John had lived there: filled the bathtub with frog spawn, eaten 43 varieties of cheese with copious notes taken on each, set fire to a set of ornate wooden dolls (purposeful) and a cupboard door (accidental), and spent a memorable afternoon on roller-skates which John cried laughing about, despite the Fallen’s protests it was actually very serious John!  A woman’s soul hangs in the balance!
John could feel Sherlock shift uneasily.  “I’m afraid there may be a
Sherlock was still frowning as if he was going to argue but something must have made him change his mind as he nodded.
“Kate,” he spun round with a smile, pleased he recognised someone.  Kate Nixon was one of the few people his own age in his course and they’d become at least acquaintances, if not friends.  Her dark skin highlighted her pale eyes which she emphasised even more with carefully chosen make-up, she had a penchant for purple jewellery and accessories and was quietly competent in her work with an excellent bedside manner.  John liked her.
“Oh, hey Sherlock, it’s Molly.”  The muted bustle in the background suggested she was in the cafeteria.  So much for the body.
The door to the building directly opposite their flat was already open.  Retrospectively, if asked what the buildings were, John would have probably shrugged and said they were flats too but if he was being truly honest, he had never given a single thought to them.  They had blended into the backdrop of his life with Sherlock, an old movie set made of paper and false perspectives for them to stage their adventures on.  Now he knew just how close that assessment was.  The building was abandoned.  It spread out further than 221, the open-space of the area three buildings instead of one.  The other doors must be false, as there was no sign of them this side of the wall.  Metal stairs were tucked to the far right side.  It reminded John of a factory floor, bereft of machines.  Suddenly he wished for a torch to cut through the gloom.
He didn’t want to feel offended.  “It’s sort of a new thing.”
Sherlock leaned back first, resting his forehead on John's.
However, much to Sherlock’s surprise, John wasn’t upstairs either.  Which meant John wasn’t in the flat.  Which meant John was missing.
So Lestrade began to explain.  He summarised the situation as best he could, tracing the events from the stake-out, to the kidnapping, to the Council, to the
Deep lines in a pointed face, watery eyes, sandwiched between two children’s faces; a birthday or similar John would guess.  A profile picture from his previous life?  There was no signal of recognition.  John shook his head.
was the imperative, he’d told everyone that this was the most important thing to him at the time.  This was true.
A text message lit up his screen.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was hesitant.  Sherlock presumed most people would be if they’d just heard a thud and nothing else.
Lestrade nodded.  “So, let me check if I’ve got this straight up to now.  A rogue individual, or set of individuals, in the Council has been manipulating their power by allowing Fallen’s into the Council limits.  Those Fallen’s have taken on the identities of angels and obliterating them in the process.  Why?  And how the hell are we going to prove any of this?”
Sherlock sighed dramatically, as if John was being tedious, and stepped onto the set.  It was then that John felt like his project just might work, and the realisation pushed him out of his awkward nervousness and into full photographer mode.  He knew how to do this.  Hell, he was
century pirate.
"And what are they?" Sherlock’s face hadn’t changed but the look in his eyes was almost...wary?
“Oh,” John said.
“John!”  The voice on the other side sounded surprised.  It was also incredibly loud.  “It’s Becky.”  John’s mind scrambled.  Becky, who the fuck was Becky?   “From work?  You had a shift this morning.  We were worried.”
Sherlock relaxed when Victor did, although he was aching to ask for more details on the case.  His mind was rebelling at the teaser, wanting facts, wanting
Identical pictures of a garage were in front of him.
John laughed.  “Lucky guess,” he responded flippantly.  Still deep in thought, Sherlock hummed but willing to let the point slide for now.  John didn’t feel like telling him that he’d noticed the apiology books lining the bookcase in the living room or the various honeys in the back of the cupboard.  Somehow, despite being perfectly reasonable things to notice about someone you lived with, to say them would expose something he was not ready to show to anyone else, never mind the subject of the feelings.
So Sherlock practically glided away, melting into the crowd as he went down the stairs.  It took a while to locate him again.
John couldn't work out if he had chosen the seat purposefully or if the gods just loved him.  The sunlight lit him beautifully, making him glow like the angelic creature he was.  Dark curls haloed around his face with a fringe swooping over his forehead, stopping just short of falling in his eyes.  A look of concentration focused his features, sharp verdigris eyes narrowed at the laptop in front of him.  John was so focused on staring at the full, pouty lips, imagining them on his own, licking them,
The room was dark, the only light coming from outside the open curtains. He paused by the doorway. If they’d been in an open area then he could have run to his room as a retreat. Here though, there was no escape. Clearly John felt he had waited long enough.
“You love a puzzle! Always have, always will, and that makes you vulnerable.  And I had other business to attend to,” Moriarty said with a shrug.
Jesus.
Sherlock pretended to be offended at this.  “You need to be more imaginative.  Almost every person I’ve met has tried to accuse me of violent rebellion at least 6 times.”
“Do what?”
Three end notes: one this chapter is bloody long in comparison to the others- I'm not sure if this is the new normal because we're into the case or if it's a fluke but hopefully you enjoyed.  Two, I'm not really happy with the ending line but I had it somewhere and it was weird to end it anywhere else so there you go.  Three, I will attempt to get the next chapter up in a week but I don't have my usual weekend writing time so we'll see!
John nodded.  Plenty of time.  “I’m going to buy a new toaster,” he announced to the kitchen and wandered back upstairs.
If you see any glaring mistakes that is because I suck at grammar and any constructive criticism is really appreciated if you see any plot holes forming. Have a good week and hopefully I'll have another chapter up soon :)
“Oh you’re no fun.”  That wasn’t John’s voice.  Higher pitch.  Light and breezy.  Irish?  A Fallen jumped up onto the platform and started forward, pausing just behind John.  “Hi!”
As the old saying goes, time flies when your mind is sending you into a spiraling panic about your attractive fitness instructor and the half hour was over far too quickly.  People began filtering out and if it took Sherlock longer than everyone else to put away his mat then what of it?
“Yes sweetheart?”
“I have
After two terms his mind has spiralled and he could barely force himself to move from his dorm bed, terrified of going out the door and having to sit through class but equally terrified of telling anyone he was struggling, unable to articulate his thoughts properly.  He locked himself away like that for a week before his former next-door neighbour had come to find him.  If he’d had the energy he would have been mortified at the thought of what the Warden had seen when they finally got his door unlocked.
It was then Sherlock realised he was gripping his phone so hard his knuckles were going white as his mind had raced to pick out the worst-case scenario.
to know, otherwise the entire thing is pointless.”  Sherlock looked like he was going to refuse so Lestrade added “Otherwise no case at all and I’ll arrest you for interference in an active investigation.”
“Never better,” he said jokingly.  He groaned as he heaved himself up, first onto his elbows, and then upright.
“Yes you did.”
There was some truth behind this statement.  Greg Lestrade, Senior Guard and technically John’s boss somewhere in the hierarchy of things, was under the distinct impression John didn’t have any friends (true) and had taken it upon himself to change this (unprompted).  A trip to a crime scene was apparently a stepping stone in a long-winded plan that began with friendly hello’s by the water cooler, and would eventually end up with
"I guess that's my cue," John said laughing.
Sherlock was uncertain what to take offense to first: the fact he would act so obviously out-of-character or the fact Molly was texting about his personal life.
She seemed pleased at his relenting.  “He’ll be really happy to see you.”
“It obvious Jake knows who they work for which meand Jake is trying to hide something.  I need to find out what before this can go any further.”
“How?”
“Help me with my feet,” he ordered.  Luckily he was only tied to the chair, rather than cuffed.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes, partially leaning on John’s leg as he worked and together they quickly managed to untangle him.
In return for this show of trust, Sherlock would reluctantly show John his sketches, usually with twelve caveats of “it’s nothing really”.  John would of course consistently answer with “they’re beautiful you idiot,” which caused Sherlock to blush for more reasons than he cared to examine.
John had a sinking feeling he already knew what it was but he had to ask to be sure.  “Sherlock.  What is that?”
“And get so bored I jumped out of that window after you as well,” John finished.  “No, I need excitement I think.  I need adventure.”
John, oblivious to the panic sirens upstairs, was downstairs in the kitchen, humming to himself while making some breakfast. Not wanting to disturb Sherlock, he’d dressed in a pair of pants and an old t-shirt he’d found in the pile of washing waiting to go back upstairs.  He needn't have bothered as 10 minutes later a ruffled looking Sherlock appeared in the doorway, red dressing gown slung on over his pyjamas and looking, in John’s opinion, as if he was going to be sick.
It still felt like John was avoiding him.
Not-John scowled at him.  Lestrade’s eye twitched.  Very quietly he said, “I’m not going to yell at you now because we are working together and this is important.  But afterwards, I am going to have some choice words for you and they are going to be very,
“I would know even if I didn’t.”  Sherlock was very assured in his answer.
fantastic.
It was something of a surprise to be jolted awake by the familiar sounds of Mrs Hudson clattering around the flat.  His eyes reluctantly opened, and he lied still for a minute, just listening.
“We would have fit,” Sherlock muttered.
“Hey,” John said softly, slinging one arm around Sherlock’s back and letting the other thread through those dark riotous curls.
texted
Mycroft inspected his fingernails.  “It was...an oversight.”
Sherlock pretended not to hear and kept adjusting the microscope.  He should tell Lestrade.  It would make sense to tell him.  It might be necessary for the investigation to know a part of someone’s soul was missing and had been taken by a Fallen, even if that Fallen seemed very enthusiastic about solving the crime.
John's “Oy,” of indignation was cut off by Sherlock kissing him again, long and slow because
“I look like an angel John but don’t for a second think I am one.”
But no.
Sherlock hadn’t lied about playing violin, nor had Mrs Hudson about his odd hours.  Sometimes he was there when John awoke, hunched over the kitchen table enraptured, others he was nowhere to be seen, and on a few memorable occasions John left him dozing on the sofa only to find him still there the morning after.  However, John never felt that he was in the way of something, or that he was trapped upstairs.  The muffled notes of the violin were soothing and John found he slept much better under the roof of 221B, safe in a room which was small enough to make his belongings look noticeable without feeling like he’d been shoved in the box room for convenience’s sake.
Both entrances to the Baker Street station was closed off with two stretches of tape.  Glancing around, he ducked under and stalked into the darkness.  The entranceway was dim, the only light source that which filtered in the open arches of the doorway.  The shops were still shuttered and there didn’t appear to be a Guard presence, despite the tape. He jumped over the barriers and paused.  There was a short upper platform, with signs for the Hammersmith & Circle or Bakerloo lines.  The tunnel to Bakerloo was dark, whereas the platform for H&C was not.  Sherlock glanced up.  The glass roof had been artificially darkened so the bright platform was noticeable.  Whoever was behind this clearly loved showmanship or possibly old spy films. He rolled his eyes.  He attempted to sneak down the Bakerloo route but was thwarted by an invisible barrier.  Not unexpected but worth a try anyway.
“There’s been something of a criminal upswing here over the past few years.  Turns out getting into the better place does not automatically make people want to hold hands and sing.  So, we made a deal.  Their worst for our best.”
“Why what?”  John pulled them into the conservatory, to sit on a sofa tucked just to the right of the doorway.  It was covered in an appalling old-fashioned floral pattern and Sherlock had to wonder who had overseen the interior design.  John re-caught his attention, turning to face him, left hand propped up on the back to rest his head on, the right still holding onto Sherlock’s.
He sighed, despite the fact it made his ribs hurt.  He then tried to roll over and managed to get onto his right side.  It then took a moment to quell the overwhelming urge to either black out or throw up.  Or both.  His eyelids weighed about 60 pounds each, but he managed to claw them open a little.  Even then the weak sunlight was offensive.  More offensive was the sight of his brother, sat primly in his customary three-piece suit, a polite smile on his face.  He even had a leg crossed over the other.  In Mycroft language that was practically lounging.
John answered by lifting his hands up to pull Sherlock into a forceful kiss, one hand cupping the nape of his neck, the other sliding into his hair.  They both pulled back quickly though.
it is from-”
“Okay,” Sherlock said and he quickly kissed him. John allowed him control for a minute, dropping his hands to Sherlock’s waist. It was therefore surprising for Sherlock to feel his feet leave the ground for a second before he fell sideways onto the bed. He rolled onto his back, intending to glare but before he could, John had crawled on top of him, laughing. Sherlock’s breathing stuttered as John rested his arms either side of his head, knees bracketing around his hips, holding himself up.
Ever.
Sherlock took over the conversation once more.  “Lunch I think.”  And there he was off again, causing John to wonder if Sherlock ever stood still for longer than a minute.  He looked bemused at Mrs Hudson who patted his shoulder and was still trying not to laugh.
“My job is to solve crimes no one else can because I don’t spend my time doing work that isn’t useful.  You, on the other hand, wander around the streets of London, catching the occasional mild delinquent and drinking shit coffee.”
"Okay?" John asked, just needing to know for definite.  Sherlock replied by kissing him again, hands holding onto his waist as he leant back in.  This kiss was bolder, opened mouthed, and John ran his teeth over Sherlock's bottom lip before sucking it gently.  Sherlock groaned softly which made John do it again and this sent all his blood rushing south.
“It’s impolite!”
So, when they finally,
“Could ask you the same thing,” he joked, “I’m
So, the Fallen’s, the
.  That has to mean something.”  Sherlock looked up at John.
Sherlock coughed through the dust.  He stayed still for a moment, until his ears had stopped ringing.  As far as he could tell he wasn’t substantially injured.  A few cuts and bruises.
John’s head snapped up.  “You said you don’t feel things like that.”
The stairs creaked, and muffled voices drifted up to them.  Sod’s law was a tricky beast.
“Wait you have plans?” Mike asked, looking sceptical.
When he’d informed Mrs Hudson of this as he left for a class in the second week, she muttered something about ‘clutching at straws.’  She clearly did not know how imperative core strength was to scaling London architecture.
There were good things, things that John tried to recite to himself every time he felt like hitting his head against a wall (
“Yes, it is a “Big Day”, as you call it.”
“I fancied coming here instead.”
“Oh so you’re-”
secret.
This did not prevent him from hearing her say “Oh Sherlock.”
Luckily at that moment John walked through the door and his retort was sidetracked by the fact John smiled at him.  Him specifically.
John realised they had been incredibly lucky up to this point, more so than should be allowed.  This was perhaps why he was not surprised at what happened next.
It could all wait for him. It had been patient for this long, a few hours more wouldn’t hurt. Besides, there was someone he had to see first.
“Could have been suspicious if he didn’t?” Sherlock paused.  “Or it’s a message...” he added, clearly becoming lost in thought.
They twisted and turned through alleyways until Sherlock chased him down a dead-end street.  Panicking, the suspect spun round and lunged at Sherlock, aiming for his throat.  Sherlock reared back but before the culprit could make contact, he was thrown backwards.
Thank you for reading and sticking by this fic and I hope you enjoy the ending :) x
“Are you Sherlock Holmes?” he said, locking eyes with Sherlock.
“Stop lying to me.  Just stop.”  John glowered at him.
His entrance startled the guy who inexpertly spun around at the noise, thankfully taking the knife away from his victim’s throat.  John ducked into a shadowy corner and waited.
Lestrade rattled off an address and a time before cutting the line mid-yell at some subordinate.
So that’s how he had done it, Lestrade thought, how he had wormed his way into John’s life and become it so completely.
“Don’t mention it,” she said with an ‘I know how he is’ shrug.  “Molly,” she said, sticking her hand out jerkily, as if this was a foreign gesture, one read about but never attempted.
He took a deep breath in a futile effort to calm his elevated heart rate and his quickened, panicked breaths. As soon as he’d stepped out the car, the reality of the situation had sunk in. The fact that he was truly here on this familiar stretch of pavement. The fact that he was going to walk in and then
Sherlock walked away and John climbed into the comfort of the shower.
They didn’t even share a bedroom and late night sneaking was deterred when they discovered his brother worked through the night and therefore there were still people wandering the halls.  Nothing to kill a mood more than a polite “Is there anything I can get for you sir?”
“What are you doing exactly?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  He’d heard the name before but was having trouble placing it.
“Right now?” Sherlock felt caught between wanting to show off his skills and not wanting to scare John away.
“Scientific reliability John.”
Golden light surrounded them, a warm, encompassing glow, as Sherlock kissed John again, deeper this time, wrapping him up in his arms.  The universe paused, the world stopped spinning, and all that existed was him and John, together, in the sunshine.
“Errr,” Jasmine said, looking around as if John would magically appear.  “I don’t know.  Where’d you last see him?”
Fortified with full shopping bags and a plan, he felt ready to set off home.  There was only so long he could stall under the pretence of handing over Mrs Hudson’s shopping and with a gentle “I can manage myself just fine.  Go look after him, he’s got himself in a right twist over something,” John was dismissed for the second time that week.
“Sherlock!  You can’t take things from an active crime scene!”
The unofficial record stated that there was an ambush on a routine walk-round and John was drugged and taken prisoner by an unknown organisation. Memories of that time were hazy, with parts merging together into a drug-induced fog.  There were certain moments of clarity.  Being forced to sprint to avoid being run over by a tank. Pushing aforementioned tank in the sweltering sun of the desert.  Being actually
“Yeah, tell me about it,” John huffed, leaning back further into his chair, as if it could absorb him.
There were bigger problems but Sherlock filed it away for later.
“What now?”
John just shook his head.  Lestrade didn’t actually want an answer.
“People with experience in stuff like this.  They were going to get to them before they’d even started work but they didn’t have enough evidence by that time.  I’d rather not say names; don’t want them on my tail as well.”  Sherlock decided against pushing the point; there were other questions which were decidedly more pressing.
“Mycroft?!”  The idea of his brother in a
, see what I didn’t have time to look at.  Should be easier with a warrant.  And I need to talk to the manager, obviously.”
John locked up the room and turned to Sherlock.  There was a small pause and then both began speaking at once.
“See that was almost sweet.  I’d call that progress.”
Mycroft pretended not to hear. “
“Hello Victor,” he smiled as Victor caught up and they began walking towards the main road.
“No.  What do you need?”
“Why do all this” Sherlock gestured around him, “and not leave a message?  Some indication of why they did this?  It’s clearly not a random attack; they don’t appear to have taken anything of value so it’s not a burglary.  Conclusion: Jake knows his attackers so they didn’t need to leave a message.  He already knows what they want but is reluctant to give in.  Therefore he’s running.”
“One on Colliery Lane, and I’ve heard a couple have shown up in 15
“Hi John,” she said, folding her arms across her chest and angling herself so she was directly in the way of the opening of the shield.  “What are you doing here?”
And everything went black.
Last night, Sherlock had returned at 3pm, just after John had got in from the library, and thrown himself into his pyjamas and onto the sofa.  He had remained there near constantly ever since, only getting up for the bathroom or to pace manically for a few minutes before returning to his position on the sofa.  John had managed to get him to eat some toast earlier and, from the amount of half-filled mugs squished on the coffee table, he had been getting some liquids so that was something at least.  For the first few hours he hadn’t spoken at all.  Now he was replying to simple questions but still wouldn’t answer questions about the case or what was troubling him.  John could only hope that the party would allow Sherlock to relax a bit and work through whatever was bothering him.
“I’ll let you get me a new suit.”
“Only following directions, jeez.”  He scratched the back of his neck and glanced around.  There didn’t appear to be anyone paying attention to them but obviously he may have been burned before.  He could practically hear Sherlock roll his eyes which made John want to point out that not all of them could be performers because not all of them were so
“So, what’s a consulting detective do?”
She poked her head around the kitchen door and she smiled at him.  “Finally awake I see.”  He grumbled in response, rolling onto his back to look at the ceiling.
“Hello John,” he said, throwing out a gloved hand which John clasped without thought.
“DoYouWantToGoOnADateWithMe?”
Now all he had to do was seduce John, who would be back home in about twenty minutes.  Easy.  John loved him.  He loved John.  John wanted this.  He wanted this.  Easy.  Yep yep yep.  Nervous?  Him?  No.
“Night,” he whispered into the space, and then turned to go upstairs.
“Why fitness?” Sherlock hadn’t realised before but suddenly he wanted to know everything about this man.
“Okay.  I’ll grab my jacket.”  It was only when Sherlock had disappeared that John registered what he has said.
“He knows Mike, I’m sure he can’t be that bad.”
“C’mon,” he said, bumping Sherlock in the shoulder.  “Might be fun.”  There wasn’t really room but John managed to perch himself on the chair arm, and Sherlock automatically turned so his face was pressed into John’s jumper.  “There’ll be music you can criticise and people to make fun of and there might be dancing…”
So Sherlock kissed him, just to give them another thing to talk about.
When Sherlock bounded up the stairs to the flat everything was still and quiet, as if he was the only person in the building.  This was clearly not the case however; evidence of John was everywhere, in his jacket still hung up on the peg, his books still stacked neatly by his chair, the half-full tea mug on the coffee table.  The only thing missing from the picture was John.
Victor sat back to assess.  It was all strange, that was true, but all that had been going on for months, which would mean the relationship must have been going on for months and for him to not realise... It was a horrific thought.
“That you wished to forget yesterday night and return to our previous arrangement.”  John felt simultaneously weak-kneed from relief and like hitting his head against a wall.
“It will work? I mean, I can go through can’t I?” Sherlock asked, still sceptical.
“That’s the one.”
“We better get going then,” John said after a while, realising how strange both of them must look.
“Not the first victim of bureaucracy, and I fear not the last,” Sherlock said, turning to Lestrade and shooting him a sarcastic smile.
As he backed off from the now double-crime scene, he heard a small voice say “Is this yours?”
), John had to stop himself from sighing in relief.  This was what he’d been missing.  Sherlock was amazing but it was difficult to keep up with his rapid fire mind sometimes and to actually talk openly with him.  With his new classmates, he didn’t know any of the well enough to go and talk to them, never mind the fact they had no idea he wasn’t 100% human.  All he needed was a friend who understood where he had come from and what he was trying to say without him even needing to say it.  Of course, with his luck, it just so happened that that person happened to be many miles away and only reachable at certain times due to both their schedules being taken over by either work or university but you couldn’t have everything.  John felt this understanding of one another was emphasised when Greg switched from joking about John’s old crushes to a very serious:
“Ages ago, when we first met!”
because he did not have the energy to deal with that right now and all this was to say: John did not hear the banging on his door.
.  Like he was happy for John but there was the pressing matter of illegal Fallen’s running around in Council limits to consider, as well as the fact they were in
While Lestrade contemplated the next few hours and whether or not they would be the straw to break the camel’s back, the camel in this case being John and Sherlock’s obvious interest in one another, the two in question were attempting to “look casual”.
New chapter? New chapter! And it didn't take me a month to write this one!  Basically this chapter contains the scene that started it all, the one idea that lodged in my head and started this whole madness, so I really really hope you enjoy it.
“Without me?”  Even though his voice was muffled by the cushions, he still managed to sound hurt by this idea.
“Where?”  He was being deliberately obtuse.
The figure swivelled his head and John had to resist the urge to duck down out of site.  The only thing more suspicious than being sat in a car, in the dark, in the early hours of the morning, would be to try and look like you weren’t in the car.
They had agreed to take their relationship slow.
“Why?”
Sherlock sounded ambivalent.  “Could be useful, maybe set one of the Guards on it, it’ll keep them occupied (a “Hey!”from Lestrade was ignored by both).  But why go near surveillance when-”  He stopped dead, his eyes widening.  Upside down triangle,” Sherlock said, grabbing John’s shoulders.  He looked ecstatic, like his mind was galloping a hundred miles a minute to fit this new information in, to see all of its ramifications.  John couldn’t help feel a little smug, despite not knowing what the hell he was on about.
"Hey Sherlock," he replied and was very pleased at how collected he sounded.  See, he could do this.  He could be cool.  So cool.  Totally cool.  Okay, maybe he'd had more beer than he thought.
"A green one to be exact.  There were flecks in this mark here." Sherlock pointed at the photo.  This caused their arms to touch again and for him to lean slightly into John's space.  It was as if all the air had left the room.  John only trusted himself to nod, swallowing heavily.  "They figured if the perfectly usable ladder was left in place, no one would suspect them of bringing their own. Stupid reasoning really but then again that's probably why they were caught."  John laughed at Sherlock's derision but it came out breathless.
“Not yet,” he said and hated the way her face fell a little.  “I have a lead though.  Lestrade is certain he will be absolutely fine,” he offered.
At first John thought this was just another dig at the Senior Guards effectiveness but there was another answer.  “He’s only going to talk to you.”
Molly giggled.  “Okay, but promise not to blame me okay?”
“You’ve known him for a while.”  Again not-quite a question.
The place was fairly busy so John didn't see him at first.  Afterwards he was quite grateful as he would have probably bolted if he was the first thing he saw.  Instead he took in the room with it's quirky wallpaper and battered-but-homely feel.  It was only with Mike repeatedly hitting his arm that he looked away from the skull on the mantel piece (they had been introduced one Friday, he was trying to work out if he should go say hello or if that was ultra weird) and saw Irene waving at them.  The person turned to look at them and John realised.  She was talking to Sherlock.
“What do you want Sherlock?  I’m busy,” he said, gesturing to the laptop and grateful that for once he had left open the word document and not Facebook.  For some reason this made Sherlock look uneasy.
abandoned.  Almost, as there wasn’t any dust lining the wooden features of the desk or bookshelves.  He stayed in the doorway, simply looking.  There wasn’t anything in the room he needed but old habits die hard and he had to check.
They still did not realise their problem as they (meaning John) checked into their hotel rooms.  Keeping up the illusion of a simple friendship, they had rooms across the hall from one another.
When his mission was done, he paused and smiled.  Grabbed an apple and placed it in the middle of the abandoned desk.  His assistant would pick it up later and hopefully all charges would disappear quietly.
Thus it had started, not only a friendship but also the parties and social events that went with being someone’s friend.  That was how he was identified anyway, a conversation always starting with “Oh, you’re Sherlock right? Victor’s friend?”
“Ow,” he said, in belated acknowledgment.
“That’s annoying.  Our phones were returned to us yesterday and this is definitely being kept as evidence.  Got everything I needed from it anyway and I doubt it will be of any use to you in the near future.”
“Well he’s never going to let me here the end of this,” Sherlock muttered and sighed.  “Victor is not my boyfriend,” he said and continued as if still talking to himself, “Absolutely not.  No thank you, I know far too much about him to see him in that light and I have my sights set firmly on someone else.”
Lestrade nodded again.  “All members of Activate Plus, a gym and fitness centre just around the corner.  Fully kitted out including a wide range of studio classes, intense personal training sessions and a brand new swimming pool.  Motivation to help you find a better you.  Join today,” Lestrade concluded, reading off a leaflet in the file, his eyebrow raised.  He couldn’t help laughing as Sherlock glowered at him.  “Not interested I take it?”
And so here it is. Finally.
Sherlock was uncertain what he was speaking of at first but following Raz’s gaze it soon became obvious.
“John?”
John shrugged, crossing his arms across his chest.  He spoke to his shoes.  “That it could work out.”
She was scowling at him.  “Try again.”
“John.”  Sherlock was practically quivering with rage but who it was directed at was questionable.
Neither could be called “good” at friendship but John appreciated the effort.  It’s not like he
“Stop being so childish.”
John laughed, “Can I get that in writing?  Sherlock Holmes talking about being reasonable.”
“No, I’m not.”
Sherlock looked like he wanted to say No but hesitated.  Instead of answering that he didn’t know, he shrugged.
