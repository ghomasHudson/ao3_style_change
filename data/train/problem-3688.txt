The comments were great.  You're all so amazing.  I was expecting much harsher comments than I got.  I am so fortunate this story has such wonderful readers.   Once again thanks so very much for the kudos and comments.  We are creeping up on the 400 mark for kudos which is awesome.
Dean gets tortured by Drake but at first refuses to scream not wanting to give him the satisfaction, but then Drake starts sexually assaulting him and Dean finally screams.  Benny and Crowley arrive and start to lose the fight.  Dean gets loose with the help of the Mark and helps them turn the tide before passing out.
“The Pizza Man’s Men.” Dean repeated dumbly.  And then he chuckled, reaching for the angel, only for Cas to pull away.  Dean frowned.  Did he do something wrong?  He’d barely had the time to spiral down into a proper panic, but then Cas was leaning down and capturing his lips in a mind-blowing kiss.
So it was really not much of a surprise when Sam felt the bullet enter his abdomen just as he finished stabbing one of the four werewolves (Sam had only thought there was one in his defense). Sam gasped as pain blossomed through his body, and he fell to his knees. His eyes, already blurry from the alcohol in his system, blurred even further from shock and pain. He slumped to the floor, watching a werewolf bend over him with claws outstretched, ready to take his heart. Sam thought he was hallucinating when the werewolf froze and cried out in pain and a blade, or a bone rather, protruded through his chest. Sam looked up. He thought he saw Dean just before blackness sucked him under.
“And then comes along this human, this frustrating, brave, crass, loyal and infuriating human who stood up to me and refused to cower in fear even though I know you were shaking in your boots.”  Death his lips quirked up in a small fond smile.
“You sure do love Aunt Mimmi’s beignets, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone eat so many at one sitting.”  She laughed and Death groaned.
“No!” Dean shouted but John just cocked the guns. “Dad please.” Dean pleaded. “I meant what I said before, I’ll do anything, just don’t hurt them.”
“This is disgusting.” He snarled. “I would never keep you in a hovel like this, my beautiful hunter. I would put you in…” Dean gasped as a golden cage flashed in his mind, the shadow of the Dream guy standing outside, looking in.
John’s anger turned into a proud grin lightning fast. “See my boy’s a genius.” John touted. “He’s right though you’re gonna do whatever I want anyway you stupid slut, especially when I get that collar back on you.” John sneered his proud look at Sam turning quickly into disgust at Dean.
Also, over 300 kudos.  I am absolutely floored by the response to this story and so happy that everyone likes it.  Thank you so very much for all the kudos and I love all the comments.
Sam’s eyebrows rose at the vampire's rant and couldn’t help the smile that quirked up his lips.  “Okaaaay.”  Sam said, putting his hands up in a woah gesture.
Cas narrowed his eyes, but thought about what Dean said.  A small smile quirked his lips.  “Yes, you do tend to react differently than the average person.”
Dean sighed and sunk into the embrace, his shaking finally stopping.  After a long pause, Dean looked up at him through his long lashes, his voice soft.  “How’s this going to work when my year is up, Crowley?”
“Hello Castiel, Sam.” Tessa said, glancing over her shoulder before she thrust the bag into Dean’s hands.  “You know Dean it's bad enough you two are hopping around through time and leaving me to cover but now I’m a food delivery person!”  Tessa snarled folding her arms across her chest and tapping her foot in anger.
Well they weren’t around Dean 24/7 and he just needed to get to Dean and train him again.  John discretely adjusted himself as he hardened thinking about all the lessons he would be teaching his wayward son in order to gain back his blind obedience, but first he needed more information, more spells, more sigils and a way to permanently remove those two.
“You are singularly the most exquisite person I have ever seen.”  Cas said reverently, his gaze sweeping over every inch of Dean.  “The stars in heaven pale in comparison to the stars upon your body.”  He added as fingers traced over some of Dean's freckles.
After another panic attack in which he had screamed himself hoarse yelling for Crowley, Dean sunk down onto the bed and fell into a fitful sleep.
“So, Sam. Gotta ask, I mean, you know better than to hunt like that. Did something happen with Amelia? I’ll admit, I’m really surprised you’re still here at the bunker.” Dean asked, voice light but the worry for Sam bleeding through anyway. Anger coursed through him at the thought of that chick hurting Sam. She would be the luckiest person to be able to have Sam in her life. Dean couldn’t believe she would think otherwise if she actually did do something.
“You don’t get to say no to me Dean.  Do I really have to train you all over again?”  John asked working Dean’s button open and unzipping his jeans, his arousal hard and pushing at Dean’s ass.
“Nah. I’m fine here. You should go and get some sleep, you guys. I’ll be fine.” Dean repeated, already walking over and sitting on the couch so that he could take a moment to look away from them, to not have to face Sam or Cas.
We are getting close to the end but there is still plenty of angst for Dean before it is all resolved.
“Angels aren’t real.” John said turning his gaze back to Cas and tensing as if he was going to attack.
Cas shook his head and walked up to Dean.  “Just relax, Dean.”  Cas murmured.  The angel gently stripped Dean of his torn clothes.  Guiding him with a gentle hand on his hip, he laid Dean down on the bed and then he just—
“You shouldn’t have come here.” Dream guy said, his back still to Dean as he pulled out a book and rifled through the pages.
The guy straightened up, and for the first time Dean was able to see his eyes. They glowed violet as fury twisted his face. “All this time I’ve lost. You would’ve been trained by now.” The guy snarled out.
I answered comments a different way tonight and everything seemed to work so hopefully I didn't miss anyone.  I keep saying I will be better with the comments and then I leave them for a week so again I apologize.  I will keep trying to do better, but please keep them coming.  I can't express how much they mean to me whether you like what I wrote or not I enjoy them all.  I also really appreciate all the kudos, its the most I've even got for a story I've written and its awesome.  Thank you.
Well here you have it.  I hope the relationships between Sam and Dean and Dean and Cas were resolved in a way everyone liked.  I know a lot of people were not happy with how the first part ended.  I hadn't intended on doing a sequel but now that its said and done I'm really glad I did.
Dean attacked an angel after being provoked and Cas blamed Dean without finding out what happened.  Dean was then attacked and mortally wounded but Cas and Sam both assumed Dean killed the angel for now reason.
“Cas!”  Dean cried out in the throes of passion.  Cas’ eyes had gotten dark with lust, pupils dilated to the point of completely overwhelming his irises as he looked up, watching Dean with a sultry look as he sinfully yet gently licked Dean’s cock clean.
Pushing the unwanted feeling down, Crowley sat back and sipped his Craig.  He smiled as Dean tried to keep the vampire from cuddling him and watched with delight the accompanying blush that made Dean’s green eyes bright when the vampire won, eyes that reminded Crowley of rolling hills and brilliant emeralds.
“Do you think I care what a bunch of bloody, sniveling, minions think of me?” Taking a deep breath, Crowley leaned forward. His abrupt calmness more scary than his rage even as his eyes were bleeding red.
“Oh man these are so good.  Where are they from again?”  Dean asked as he grabbed another and hesitated before Death nodded that it was clear of green stuff.
“Like a treasured possession.” Dream Guy corrected, his eyes were narrowed in anger before he smiled again. “Just think how sad little Sammy is going to be when we go home, this time for good.” Dream Guy said.
So yes, I know, I'm an evil, evil person for leaving you with yet another cliffhanger.  I couldn't help it, I just love how this chapter ends.
“Really?  That’s great.”  Sam said and Cas hummed in agreement.  “But why couldn’t he tell all of us?”
“No spinach this time.”  Death promised and Dean still looked skeptical.  “No vegetables at all Dean.  This has sausage in addition to the pepperoni and cheese.”  Death promised and Dean’s eyes lit up and he took a huge bite moaning in pleasure.
Shocked Dean turned around to see Crowley with his hand raised a second away from killing John.  “No Crowley don’t!” Dean yelled, grabbing Crowley’s hand and lowering it while trying to pull his jeans up with one hand.
“Crowley don’t do this.”  Dean screamed again and proceeded to curse and scream to be let out, but to no avail. Eventually, exhaustion crept up on Dean and he laid down on the small bed with a thin blanket and fell asleep.
“Wait a minute!”  Dean said forcefully causing John, Sam and Cas to all come into the room with slight alarm on their faces.
Dean’s eyes went wide, his breathing hitched. The dreaded cotton like feeling descended over him. The string had blocked the Mark, exactly how Abaddon’s cuffs had.
Triggers include references to past abuse of a minor.  Crowley's memories of John forcing himself on Dean.
But, no. Then Dean would have to tell them about how Gadreel escaped, and it would just further reinforce what a loser and bad hunter Dean was. He could just see the looks of disappointment mixed with the ‘
Note:  This was pointed out to me, and I realize I should have put something like this in earlier.  I apologize.  I am in no way a psychologist/psychiatrist or counselor of any kind.  I felt the way Crowley pushed was typical of their relationship and my story's Dean's psych but in real life its always best to leave it to the professionals on how to deal with a trauma.
“No buts, Dean.” Crowley growled. “Do you have any idea how this looks to the masses. It’s bad enough I gave into your demand about the meat suits, but then you blatantly disrespect me and kill two demons.” Crowley stood up in his agitation and stalked over to Dean, pushing him back against the wall.
Dean intended to drive away and not stop until he reached the beach house. From there, he would try to figure out a way to deal with what he learned about his deal. It was better to go there then to be fetched back like a runaway child, but Dean still found himself turning down the first dirt road he came to, driving up the dock. He always loved this place, hidden from the road and therefore rarely ever used. Dean sometimes wondered when he came out here to think if the Men of Letters used it for some kind of supply drop or something.
“And you, Sam.” Dean asked, swiveling his head to stare at his brother. With the question burning at his tongue begging to be let out, he didn’t even realize that he was meeting Sam’s gaze easily. “You’re not drunk hunting anymore, are you?”
“Dean?”  Cas asked with his adorable head tilt.  Unable to help his automatic response, Dean smiled, even as blushed, feeling a little stupid.  “I just want to see you, Cas.”
Crowley cursed yet again the fact Dean had let him live, while at the same time marveling at the irony of Dean Winchester once again protecting a demon. But jealousy was churning in Crowley’s gut at the admiration in Dean’s eyes when he had said Cain’s name.
Dean’s mind couldn’t process what had happened at first. As soon as his mind kicked in, though, he started pulling and tugging, but the strands were solid and strong. Dean wasn’t going anywhere.
Dean frowned at the memory of Castiel kissing Meg, but pushed it aside.  He didn’t want to ruin this moment with self doubts or petty jealousy.  Cas and Dean after getting back from purgatory had finally admitted their feelings for one another and just agreed to try to make a relationship work.
So this chapter is full of triggers, please see end for notes.  I will enclose the sexual stuff within *********** if you want to skip that or if you want to skip the whole chapter I will put a summary at the end.
The kudos and comments have been so wonderful to receive.  I'm so glad you all like the story, and I hope I can continue to keep your interest.  I've rewritten most chapters and we are coming up on newly written ones so all mistakes are mine.
Crowley and Dean had shared a weird look and the demon had just shrugged and with a slight blush on his face said “It’s safer here.  Just don’t …”  Crowley started to say.
“I think that would be best for now.”  Cas answered smiling again when Dean grabbed Cas’ other hand and gripped it tight.
“Hi.”  Dean said.  “Sorry to bother you.” Dean said casting a glare in Sam’s direction.  “So my dad…”
“But my King, you must understand,” the female twin stuttered out. Dean watched as the male twin put a hand on her shoulder as if to warn her. Crowley noticed as well and his eyes narrowed.
I hope you enjoyed the start of the story.  There is nothing triggering in this part, just some nightmares but nothing specific.
“I don’t want this. Please dad, stop, please stop, please stop.”  A teenage Dean screamed into the pillow as John roughly fucked him, uncaring of the pain he caused, laughing at Dean’s tears. His large hand crushed the thin bones of Dean’s wrists he held at the small of Dean’s back.
Dean nodded again. His voice was stuck in his throat, and he still couldn’t bring himself to meet their gaze head on.
Crowley turned his face to the side to hide the guilty look that flashed across it before it could stop it. He just hummed a noncommittal reply and continued stroking Dean’s hair until the hunter dropped back into sleep.
“Cas!”  Dean yelped when he felt the angel's mouth cover one of his nipples and nibble slightly.  “Fuck, that's…  I wasn't hurt there.”  Dean whimpered, actually let go and whimpered, but he was too lost in sensation to be embarrassed now.
“Um.  So what is all this?”  Sam said moving and taking a seat.  He still felt uncomfortable being among Dean’s new family even though Dean bent over backwards to make sure Sam felt included.  Sam knew it was his own guilt that kept him on the sidelines but it was hard to get by it.
“Okay I must get going.”  And then to Dean’s delight and everyone’s shock Death pulled Dean into a hug which Dean happily returned.
Sam’s eyes jerked to the horseman.  “Oh, sorry, uh, me?”   Sam squeaked out, clearly still uncomfortable being the focus of Death’s attention, and Dean snorted in amusement which earned him a glare from Sam.
This chapter is a rough one and has tons of triggers, see end for notes.  I will put a summary at end if you want to skip.
Cas reached out and Dean almost flinched, but Cas’ face wasn’t angry it was filled with — well.  Dean wasn’t sure what, but he hoped it was love and yet — was that even possible?
Dean didn't care if he had to “do a Cas” and drink an entire liquor store, but he was getting drunk tonight and the Mark was not going to stop him. On his way upstairs to his room where Dean kept his stash he spied the bar in the living room, and more importantly, the fresh bottles of Craig placed there. Crowley must have gotten in a delivery. Smirking because Crowley absolutely hated when Dean used Craig to try to get drunk — said it was to be savored and respected — Dean sauntered over.  He heard some muffled voices and was surprised to realize Crowley was home.
Talking about childhood abuse, physical and sexual, forced prostitution (underage) and prostitution.
Hi everyone, I hope you are all well and not going stir crazy.  The comments from the last chapter where so great to read, thank you so much.  I'm sorry if I take a bit to respond, I usually respond when I post the next chapter, but I really, really appreciate all the kudos and comments, please keep them coming if you like the story.
I may or may not post another chapter later on, if not maybe mid week.  I rewrote some of this chapter, and I am really not a writer so I apologize for any mistakes.
“Cas, I really needed you, and you ignored me.  How could you…”  Angry again, he furiously wiped away the tears that started to fall more rapidly.  ‘
Dean’s eyes widened in surprise at the tone of Sam’s voice, his eyes flickering between Sam and Cas and then landing on Cas’ hand on Sam’s arm. Hurt and resignation flashed across Dean’s face, making Sam frown, absently trying to figure out what his brother was thinking.
“‘What the hell’ is the question Dean.” Crowley snarled. “I just had an interesting talk with a demon who was at the bar you went to.” Crowley said, walking over to a chair and taking a seat.
“Dean, there have been so many nights where I have watched over you while you slept and have fantasized all the ways I wanted to worship your beautiful body.”
Dean kept quiet and Drake chuckled.  “Nothing to say?  No matter.”  Then Drake fiddled with the rope and Dean crashed to his knees so hard Dean was pretty sure one of his kneecaps cracked, but his arms remained chained above.
Crowley huffed a laugh and glanced up catching the look of possessiveness and lust on the older Winchester’s face as his slimy gaze roamed over Dean’s naked body.  With a snap Crowley had Dean dressed and covered up and he almost laughed at the look of fury on John’s face.
“Does Dean know you're here?''  Sam asked as they stopped at yet another floor.  I mean seriously it's bad enough he’s stuck in this elevator with Benny of all people but it seems like someone pushed the button for every floor.
, knowing how manipulative and cunning Crowley really was. All those flashes of looks that Dean dismissed as one thing or another were clearly signs that Crowley was up to no good. And Dean just ignored them. Hell, Crowley waiting an entire month for them to have sex? How could Dean have missed all those signs?
“Dean!”  Cas said, his low and gravelly voice echoing through Dean’s body.  Dean marveled not for the first time how the angel could put so much emotion into just saying his name.  And as suddenly as it filled him, the anger drained away.  Dean’s eyes slid toward the floor, unable to see the disappointment in his angel’s eyes.
Note:  In the first story Crowley sends Dean a fake alert which causes Dean to laugh.  Sam gets jealous and they fight but Dean doesn't hit back shocked at something he found out about Cas, the Mark and not wanting to hurt Sam more.  Horrified that he beat up his brother Sam tells Dean to leave.  He quickly changes his mind but Dean is already gone, having anticipated Sam asking him to leave after he said he wouldn't save him so he was ready to go.
Dean finally noticed the darkness they were shrouded in.  It didn’t take him too long to put two and two together, and he grinned up at the angel.  “You blew out all the lights.”  Dean said.
“I am sorry.”  Dean repeated.  “I can’t help it sometimes.”  Dean added and Death just shook his head fondly.
Dean backed away at the power he could feel pouring off the guy and then squinted in confusion when the guy pulled two long pieces of gold thread from his pocket.  They looked like golden pieces of dental floss, they were so thin, and then they wobbled and bounced in the air.
My previous artist was not able to finish, but I have a new artist -- the incredibly talented and sincerely wonderful person, Midnightsilver, who stepped in at the last minute and has done an incredible job so far.  I can't wait for you guys to see their picture in the next chapter, and I will probably put in an author's note when I add the rest to the parts of the story that have already been posted.
This was a long chapter so I took part of it out to combine with another chapter.  Hopefully it does not end too abruptly but I think I picked a good spot.
The story reached 400 kudos, which is absolutely amazing and I'm so happy.  Thank you all so much for leaving the kudos and the continuing comments.   Your all such wonderful readers.   Once again I'm sorry it takes me a week to respond to comments and I hope I have not missed any.  If I have I apologize but after that weird mishap with the comments I think its been working okay.
So anyways this chapter is kind of a mix up, I took parts from a previous chapter and a future chapter and put them together and I think it works.  I did finish writing a big chapter and I have only one more to write and the rest just need to be fixed.  So depending on how I split things up we are looking at 5 maybe 6 more chapters give or take.
Cas' smile was wide and gummy.  In the blink of an eye Cas was now gloriously naked and kneeling on the bed.
Dean stood there in shock for an undetermined amount of time before slowly walking up to his room, almost numb with pain and betrayal. Yet another person betrayed Dean. He felt like at this point, he was walking around with a big sign on his forehead that said
Dean ignored John’s comment and looked wide-eyed at Cas. Dean was getting really tired of everyone threatening Cas’ life. How is it possible that he had just killed an unkillable knight of hell but he still found himself at his father’s mercy; Crowley and Cas' lives still on the line. After all that, he still wasn’t enough to save his family.
John turned back to Sam and started talking like he hadn’t just pistol whipped his son. “Sam, between your brains and research abilities, my leadership and knowledge, we will be amazing.”
Hi everyone, I'm very sorry for making you wait two weeks for this chapter.  I was stuck and basically finished writing it on Friday and have messed with it and changed it multiple times, but it's been 2 weeks since I last posted so I'm just going to go with what I have.  I'm not completely happy with it, but it's nice and long.
“Okay, Dean. that’s okay. Work it with us as long as you can, yeah?” Sam said. He was rewarded with a shy grin from Dean at his words.
Death seemed to realize he was smiling like a loon and cleared his throat and put his serious face on causing Dean’s smile to widen.
They sat on the bed just staring into each others eyes for an unknown amount of time before they were interrupted by a harsh knocking at the door.
With no other choice, Castiel put two fingers on Dean’s forehead and used some of his grace to pull Dean from his nightmare. He was surprised but pleased that the Mark let him do so. Dean’s eyes popped open and he gasped, his eyes wild with terror. Castiel swiftly gathered Dean in his arms, rocking him gently.
So Sam is realizing how much he screwed up and has more questions about John now that he saw him in a different light.
Sam gasped and his eyes narrowed in hate, and Dean was shocked to see that look on Sam’s face directed at their father, no matter what filth John was spewing. That was the Sam Winchester look that guaranteed hurt and death and made most humans, demons and monsters quake.
“Son of a..  Okay fine, I saw him last week so there, if he had anything to do with it, he would have told me.”  Dean admitted.
Dean’s dick became downright painful, it was so hard hearing that forceful tone.  He barely managed a nod, too caught up in a haze of lust and want.
Sam snorted in amusement and Dean pointed a finger at him with a silent don’t, and turned back to Cas.  “But it’s my last good clean T-shirt.”  Dean said rubbing his hand down the shirt.  “I’ll just button up my flannel.”  Dean offered and froze when Cas growled again.
“Come on man you already brought all this food you don’t need…”  Dean started to say but was interrupted.
This chapter and the next one were not beta'd so all mistakes are mine and I hope there are not too many.
Dean pinked in embarrassment because of course he hadn’t, he just dove right in without caring of the consequences.  A hoard of demons surrounded the house, Abaddon was gaining in power and Dean had lost Cas and Sam so he didn’t really care at that point.  “Uh not really.”  Dean said softly.
Dean should have expected it, he thought to himself as in a lightning fast move after reaching for the journal John punched Dean in the jaw and then pivoted twisting one of Dean’s arms behind his back and slamming Dean face first into the wall.
“It’s just spinach Dean.”  Death said with another chortle when impossibly Dean’s face scrunched up even more.
Dean could see John getting ready to say or do something so he quickly turned to Cas. “Are you able to see if anyone from heaven knows about this?” Dean asked, refusing to look at John but he could feel his gaze bore into him.
“Dad, don’t.”  Dean said squirming and trying to break John’s hold, but despite the age difference and Dean having filled out since the last time he saw John, John was still stronger and just he just tightened his arms.  Dean almost whimpered when he felt the hard length of John’s cock pressing against his ass.
“Well yeah I got him one when…”  Dean started to explain and trailed off … as Sam’s face started to get red with holding back his urge to throttle Dean.
“‘And?’ And… Did we not have a deal, Dean, where I agreed to let demons only take dead meat suits and you were to lay off the demon killing?”
A couple of you caught on to the fact that John was getting information from someone and who was the mystery caller?  We have some interaction between the two below.
Sam flushed in embarrassment.  He was going to kill his brother Sam thought, but Benny just kept talking.
Benny scowled.  “Well it seems your brother has been grossly misled in the fact that Aunt Mimi’s,” Benny spat out the name like it tasted bad, “Has the best beignets.  So I’m gonna make my famous Lafitte ones and show him what a beignet is supposed to taste like.”
Since I was a little late in posting and the chapter is not great, I added a small part of the next chapter to the end so that Dean wasn't missing from last chapter and this one.
“Dean you’re looking good.” John said, turning his attention to Dean who was sitting on the bed across from the table and Cas was standing next to him.
Thanks once again for the kudos and comments and please keep them coming.  I love hearing from everyone.
“Okay… well.  Awesome..”  Dean fumbled out cursing himself for being so nervous while simultaneously leaning into the angel’s touch.
And now there was some mystery man molesting Dean in his sleep. Crowley still thought it was a figment of Dean’s imagination, but Dean wasn’t so sure. He had started to push the guy away and now the guy was becoming violent in the dreams. While it fit with Dean’s psyche and history, Crowley still felt like he was missing something.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, hoping the memory would disappear, but it was right there. Dean could feel the guy’s hands, could feel the tightness of the golden strands holding him against and wall. Dean pulled back from Crowley slightly. His heart thundered and he broke out in a fine sheen of sweet as he started to shake all over again. His wrists had circles of bruises around them, matching where the strands had been. And when Dean looked at his arms, bruises forming the imprint of a large hand were clearly visible on each biceps.
The next chapter is almost done so I won't wait a week and will post on Sunday to make up for being late this week.  I may have to extend the posts as we get closer to parts I have not written but I have three chapters that just need to be edited right now.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “So I figured it was something he would enjoy so we had lunch.  Ok no biggie.”
John put his hands out in a surrender-like fashion and nodded, but his dark gaze never left Dean’s face.
“Dean.”  Death said gravely.  “You should find a cure there, I am almost certain of it.”  Death explained.
The cute waitress came over almost immediately and flashed a smile at them, her eyes lingering on Dean.  Dean just politely smiled back and ordered three coffees and a shake for Cas, and frowning at the lack of response she left the table.
Triggers include vague references/memories of abuse.  Dean's low self esteem and fear of abandonment.
Dean felt the small surge of power and satisfaction flow through him.  The Mark was being controlled by the band of sigils but the bloodlust was still there, just muted. Dean still got immense pleasure when he fed the Mark's need for death.
“Squirrel! Squirrel! Come on, wake up!” Crowley voice echoed around the chamber. Again, the guy’s face twisted in rage, his eyes burning purple. Dean managed to mutter a last fuck you before following Crowley voice. He snapped his eyes open, finding Crowley sitting on the bed next to Dean. Relief washed over Crowley’s face when Dean’s eyes shot open.
“Jesus.  Ok fine.”  Dean said getting up and stomping into the other room.  He felt stupid calling Death because he knows he would have said something if he knew anything but they weren’t going to let it go.  With his back to the doorway he dialed the number.
Note:  In the first story Crowley inserted a crystal into Dean's arm so he could always find him and get to him no matter the wards.
.” Dean was caught up in a horrible nightmare that at first, Cas sat down next to him, trying to shake him awake. He shook him softly, but more pain filled cries were still permeating the air, and growing desperate, he tried shaking harder only for Dean to still not respond to him.
Dean glanced around as they went into the war room.  This was a big mistake. Emotions flooded him. He glanced over at where Ephraim had been killed and could almost feel the blade entering his chest again. He remembered the terror, and the hurt, when Cas and Sam came into the room accusing him.
Crowley rubbed Dean’s back as Dean’s breathing calmed down.  At a raised eyebrow in question, Dean just shook his head. “I don’t know,” was all he said in a whisper.
“Benny told me where you were.”  Cas explained.  He too took a step forward until there was only a foot or so separating the two.
“I’m so sorry.” Dean uttered and Crowley gave him a soft look. Dean turned toward his angel who was looking back at Dean, part furious, part resigned. “I love you.” Dean said again tears falling down his face, eyes drinking in the blue ignoring John’s growl of fury.
Dream guy brought a hand up to touch Dean’s face and Dean immediately slapped it away, only for anger to morph Dream guy’s face into something twisted.
Looking at Dean, Sam realized Dean meant his question. He wasn’t being snide or passive aggressive or anything. Dean actually thought that the reason Sam was drinking was because of something else, something other than the fact that his brother had whored himself out to save Sam’s life.
For a moment, there was nothing but silence. Dean put his hand on the blade at his back, ready to charge in. He was sure things were going to get ugly quick, and sure enough, after another tension filled beat, Crowley lost it.  Flinging the two demons across the room, he started to yell.
“I’ll come back in a week or so and show you how to make further adjustments.”  Death said looking now at Sam who was staring at the key — that big brain of his already working through possibilities.
John then raised his eyes which teared up with hurt and shock when he saw Sam standing proud and steady, handcuffs dangling from one wrist and both hands holding the other smoking gun. “Sam? Son? Why di….?” John started to say but then his eyes rolled up and he fell dead.
“Mother fu….”  Dean started to say and then was surprised when John’s weight was no longer there.  “What…?”
Hi everyone hope you all had a good week.  I know last week's chapter was pretty intense, and this week's is a little break from the Dean hurt.  I actually have almost the entire next chapter written, its been a productive week so I don't anticipate skipping next week like I had previously mentioned.
“Is he gone?”  Cas asked stepping up to Dean, too close as was his habit and Dean internally shuddered as John’s eyes narrowed further.
Cas frowned down at Dean and placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder and Dean leaned into the touch before he could stop himself. John eyes turned cold and calculating as he took in the gestures and with his eyes never leaving Dean’s asked. “And who is this?”
He yelled to himself but couldn’t stop the fear that spread through his body at John’s words.  Dean was never going through that again he swore and tried again to break John’s hold.
John saw the same level of protectiveness and love on Dean’s face when he looked at Sam, actually it was even more pronounced now so if John got the angel out of the picture he knew whatever happened Dean would keep it to himself so as to not risk hurting Sam.  It always worked before and John was confident it would work again.
Hi everyone, I'm sorry I'm late again.  I was trying to fix this chapter.  I have to be honest, its not my best and I'm really unhappy with it, but I'm not really sure how to fix it.  It's probably because its mostly a narrative from Cas instead of a lot of dialogue but I've said many times before and I'll say again, I am not a writer.  So I'm sorry for this, but I didn't want to keep you waiting any longer.
Dean turned around, bracing himself for the worst. But his eyes widened in surprise when all he saw in Sam’s eyes was a gentle hope. Dean frowned in confusion.
Summary:  John tortures Dean first to get him to say he belongs to John and then to get him to say please.  Dean mocks him and rates his torture and refuses to scream for John.  Not wanting to risk really hurting Dean he tries to break him sexually but it doesn't work.  Dean says he wants Cas and John loses it and carves mine into Dean's chest.  It ends with Dean telling John he hates him and John out of ideas (at the moment).
“Woah, hold up!”  Dean exclaimed.  The bright red blush increased in intensity, vibrant as it traveled down his face, neck, and chest.  “Cas, you can’t just say stuff like that.”
“Don’t!” Dean demanded but John just grinned. He looked a mess and Dean was amazed he was still standing but unfortunately John’s hands were steady.
“Felt so what, Cas?”  Dean asked gently, pushing his feelings aside.  No matter how he felt, he was more distraught at seeing Cas so upset.  He put a hand on the angel’s shoulder.
Cas stopped just shy of another orgasm from Dean and was pushing Dean’s legs further apart.  “Wait a sec!”  Dean wasn’t sure why he’d even think of stopping, but when Cas obligingly sat back, Dean remembered.
Crowley has been tempted more times than he could count to feed daddy dearest to a hell hound, grab Dean and leave everything behind, but Dean wouldn't want that and somehow that became more important than Crowley's selfish desires.  He didn’t want to betray Dean and go against his wishes, and Dean would never allow Abaddon to take over the world nor be separated from Sam and feathers.
They pulled apart and Death harrumphed once again seeming surprised at himself for once again doing such a human action.  “I will see you soon my boy.”  Death said and before Dean could respond he twisted his ring and disappeared.
“Look it’s no big deal okay.  We’ve just gone to some of his favorite places.  Get this.”  Dean said getting excited at the memory.  We went to this Folk Festival in 1951 where the first funnel cakes were ever served.  Man, they were so good.  I ate so much I almost puked.”  Dean said flushing in pleasure at the memory.
“You sound like a teenage girl.”  Dean snickered and tried to laugh but unfortunately it just came out like a gurgle.
The weeks that followed had been just as hellish as Dean had reverted back to the way he was after John and the cabin, Crowley had lost all his snark and became, for lack of a better description, clingy.  He spent almost all his time at the bunker close to Dean and Cas.  The burgeoning closeness between the demon and the angel, which had been weird enough to begin with, became much more pronounced.  Cas had also looked spooked and never left Dean’s side.  Then finally things had started to go back to normal.  Crowley left for longer periods of time and started to sound like himself, Dean finally snapped out of the almost fugue-like state he was in and Cas started to relax and resumed taking care of his business in heaven again.  But Dean’s control on the Mark had deteriorated in an alarming way and Sam knew their time to find a cure was running out.
“I mean it dad, cut it out and let me the fuck go.”  Dean threatened and then moaned in pain as John again raised his arm.
I know its another cliff hanger but I honestly hadn't intended for Dean/John to be part of this chapter and I added that because I really didn't want you guys wondering if Dean was dead.  We are also to the point in the story where stuff is going to be happening every chapter so they are unavoidable at this point.
Triggers include talking about past abuse, suicidal thoughts (or attempt if you want to see it that way), Dean's self hatred.
Cas walked back in at the moment carrying a few beers and paused at the sound of Dean’s moan, his eyes going dark.  Dean caught his gaze and they just stared.
“Dean!”  Sam croaked out the stark fear on his face morphing into a huge relieved smile as he grabbed his brother and hugged the breath out of him.
Crowley let it go for now but tugged Dean down, Dean gracefully falling to his knees in front of Crowley. He forgot all about everything while Dean put those sinful lips to use, and Crowley refused to think about the fact that when those gorgeous green orbs looked up at Crowley there was a deep abscess of sadness looking back at him before Dean shielded himself.
Dean has a flash of dream Sam saying Dean seduced John.  The Mark had induced a nightmare trying to get Dean to kill Sam in which Sam taunted him.
Wow guys, the story has gotten 101 kudos, and I am cannot thank you all enough.  Its really been helping to keep me motivated to keep writing.  I wrote another chapter this week.  I also really appreciate the comments.  So a big thank you again.
John’s eyes filled with madness. “Dean will be part killing machine part whore. Our own little ferocious pet.” John said with a smile. “Since he obviously can no longer be trained, we’ll have to keep him chained up.” John laughed maniacally. “Yeah, yeah I like that.” He murmured to himself. His gaze landed on Dean again full of lust and darkness.
After a few minutes of kissing they pulled away from each other and Dean looked at Cas with a dopey grin on his face.  “That was uh, wow Cas.  Where’d you learn to kiss like that?”
Dean had been sitting on the porch staring at the ocean, his mind lost in thoughts of what ifs, what haves and what the fuck because the dream guy had appeared a couple more times, and Dean was feeling more and more threatened.  Crowley swore there was no demon or succubus/incubus hanging around Dean so it must have just been his imagination, but there was something just so familiar about the man.  He was bigger than Dean in height and width, had long hair, and Dean was now able to see shadows of high cheekbones and deep set eyes, but that was all. Power still radiated from his hands though, and his kisses were sweet like honey and candy.
Nothing triggering in this one just some violence and Dean's self hatred and some serious angst.  Picture the scene at the end of season 10 when Dean's in the hotel room before he goes to Death when reading about him destroying the room.
“You said I could defend myself.” Dean added. He was starting get a little angry at being yelled at like a little kid.
“No I don’t, I don’t want this, I don’t want you!”  Dean screamed as Alastair played with the body he knew so well, the one he carved into a new animal.
“You're appearing weak, Crowley. Dean is handling everything and he’s making you do things out of character. When his year is up, I'm afraid…” Another hesitation and Crowley growled in impatience, making a hurry up sign with his hand. “By then all the demons will see you as weak and you will be overthrown immediately.”
Dream guy smiled up at Dean. “Don’t worry. I’m pretty sure it won’t matter at home… but if it does, the troll told me how to fix it.”
Dean nodded again. “I’m sorry, Sam. I couldn’t just leave you hurt like that.” Dean said, starting to explain his actions.
Surprise.  Once again Crowley was manipulating things behind the scenes just like the first story, although this time it was for Dean's benefit.
I had to add some push/pull from Sam on this because I think anyone in that situation would go through a phase of denial and I hope I portrayed it in a realistic way.
Cas just smiled.  “One moment.”  He said and disappeared, but was back in an instant with a warm moist cloth and a bowl of hot water.
I know, another cliffhanger (did you see I made it a tag).  I'm sorry, I'm such an evil writer, but I just can't help it.
Well here we go, the last two chapters and the epilogue.   Nothing really triggering in this chapter.
Sex with Crowley was great. Pretty mind blowing at times, but while Dean liked Crowley and cared about him, he didn’t love him, not the way he loved Ca—nope. Not thinking about him. That ship sunk in the harbor before even setting sail. Although, Dean missed him terribly, especially after seeing him three months ago. Hell, Dean missed Sam too. Sure, they’ve been apart for longer in the past, but never had it been at Dean’s choice, so this? This was a whole lot harder. At least Crowley kept tabs on Sam and let Dean know what he was doing.
Sam would say it was incomprehensible that anyone who had been treated the way Sam had treated Dean would do that… but it was … Dean.
Lamps, chairs, anything and everything he could reach was soon torn apart and scattered across the ground in shattered pieces until there was nothing left for Dean to destroy. His energy expended, Dean sunk to the floor, his knees tight across his chest. He broke down, and sobbed, bumping his head against the wall behind him a few times. The pain that twisted his face was what eventually managed to tide him over to a certain degree, his body ceasing its hectic need for movement enough for him to sink back into his thoughts. He was just so done. Dean hugged himself tighter, and the action made the hard edge of the crystal dig sharply into his skin. It was supposed to be so Crowley could help Dean,
Dean’s gaze met Sam’s and when Dean saw the drawn gun he put his hands up.  “Woah there Sam where’s the fire?”  Dean asked his eyes slightly wide and his gaze flickering around the room trying to discern the threat Sam had seen.
Dean just shrugged but Crowley’s eyes narrowed as a look of uncertainty flashed across Dean’s face and he put his left hand on top of the Mark.  Crowley met his eyes with a question but Dean just gave a small shake.
“See, I’ll make it all better Dean.” He was faceless, with long dark hair, and yet Dean knew he was smiling as he tenderly kissed Dean. Sweetness flooded Dean’s mouth, Dean’s skin tingling as the man murmured sweet nothings, Dean arching into his warmth. The images and pain from his memories were melting away. And as the man pushed inside and started with slow thrusts Dean moaned in pleasure as his prostate was hit right away.  A large hand wrapped around his cock and stroked and twisted.
Triggers include references to abuse (Sam's memory of John's "guest") and John's thoughts, but nothing too graphic.
“Yeah, but there are things you don’t know about me, Cas.  Things about my dad.”  Dean said.  He shivered, his dad’s voice screaming in his head to never tell anyone.
“Dean.”  Death said his tone serious enough that everyone stopped talking and Dean sat up straighter.  “Before I go I have something for you.”  Death said reaching into his pocket.
Weighing his options yet not wanting his time with them to end since it was entirely possible Dean would never see Sam again, he came to his decision.
Sam huffed in annoyance and after a few beats of uncomfortable silence he pointed his chin at the bag.  “What’d you got there?”  Sam asked.
“I don’t — he was going to hit… I—” Dean tried to collect his thoughts and when Sam stepped forward, his foot inadvertently kicked something. It was Jeff’s phone, having fallen to the ground at some point.
Dean sighed as he ordered a bottle, hoping against hope that he would be able to get a little bit drunk from it at the least. Even with the Mark suppressed and controlled, it still affected Dean to some extent. Such as right now, his unfortunately increased tolerance to alcohol meant that he needed a worryingly huge quantity just to feel it.
So. Sam was drunk. Hunting a werewolf with no plan of action other than charge in and kill the monster. Ironically, the type of hunting that Sam always belittled Dean about, going in half cocked and hoping for the best. Well, if Dean could do it, then Sam would too.
“And why is that?” Dean asked, disdain in his voice.  Dean edged his way over to a sword on display, only to watch it disappear. Dean spun around to see a mocking smirk on Dream guy’s face.
“Squirrel, hang in there okay, gonna get you healed up.”  Dean just shook his head cause he didn’t care  but he had to know first so he grabbed Crowley’s sleeve.  “Sam?”  He croaked out.
Unfortunately, Crowley chose a time when Dean was amped up on rage to visit. He popped in and after chuckling at Dean’s failed attempt to punch him simply asked.  “You have something to say?”
“I’ll run you a bath.” Crowley said, getting up. He took a few steps before pausing and turned back to Dean, a hard look on his face. “Don’t cross me again Dean. I won’t let you off so easy next time.” Dean just nodded, and for the second time that evening, wisely kept his mouth shut.
John thinks about sex with Dean and hurting him in the future and Crowley briefly references the abuse in his thoughts about John.
Okay I know I was horrible to Dean in this chapter, but he was so strong through all of it.  And I promise this is the last one like this.  I'm not saying nothing else bad happens to Dean but this was the worst it will get in regards to actual torture.
Grunting with effort Dean rolled over to the angel blade.  He picked it up with his right hand as the left one was useless with the shoulder out of socket.  He locked eyes for a second with Benny who looked resigned as the demon with the knife raised it up but before he could swing down and remove Benny’s head Dean flung the demon blade which landed in the center of the demons back.  Its flickering death was all the distraction Benny needed as he jerked himself free and pulled the angel blade out of the dead demon and started to fight the remaining two.
"Yeah Dean, Cas got there in time."  Sam said the look on his face a mixture of remorse and gratitude.
Again John had to grit his teeth as he listened to his son after he put the donut or whatever the hell it was in his mouth and moaned like a porn star.  Something needed to give and quickly or he was going to lose it.  Recognizing the same look of lust on the angel’s face John realized the first order of business was to find a way to separate the two.
“Never!”  Cas said confidently and Dean actually believed him.  Dean opened his mouth and then closed it again.  His mind was screaming with John's threats and promises of what would happen if he ever told anyone, but he pushed the voice out and relaxed, because this was Cas, his angel.  He leaned into Cas’ hand as the angel squeezed his shoulder gently in support.
Sam felt his adrenaline spike again and he almost reached back for his gun before Death threw back his head and gave a full on belly laugh.  Sam blinked at the sight.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a good week and everyone is staying healthy.  Here is a bit of a longer chapter which is basically three really small chapters that I put together.  There is nothing too triggering, see end for notes.
“Nobody likes a tattle tale.” A deep voice said — and the demon exploded into gray dust. Dean's eyes jerked toward the new threat as the Mark pulsed so hard he thought it might break through the band. Dean's eyes met the icy blue eyes of Cain as he strode into the bar. He never broke eye contact with Dean as he grabbed two demons and tore them apart— literally. The last demon tried to smoke out but Cain, finally looking away from Dean, put a hand into the smoke and jammed it right back into its meat suit. Dean cringed as Cain cut and hacked at the demon.
“What about death?”  Sam asked.  “He certainly has the juice and it's kind of his thing.”  He added and Cas nodded.
With an eye roll at the tension between Dean and Cas, Crowley walked over to the angel and slapped him on the back.  “Come on feathers, we have some clean up to do.”  Cas looked relieved at having an acceptable reason to leave, which hurt and with an “of course” from the angel, Crowley gave Benny a look to convey for him to take care of Dean to which the vampire nodded, and they disappeared.
“I was the King of the Crossroads, you blithering idiots.  And do you not think, that as a former King of the Crossroads, and present King of Hell, that
“Stop it.” Dean demanded again, his voice betraying him when it cracked. The guy just hummed and reached for his buckle.
“Of course, Dean.” Sam responded. “Let’s grab a few hours and then head out first thing in the morning.”
So not my best chapter, more of a filler but it is needed to set the stage for John's plan.   Sam starts acting a little out of character in this chapter, but he has never been the one "caught in the middle" and doesn't handle things well.
Here.” Sam wordlessly held out his phone, and he knew he didn’t have to say anything for Dean to understand what he was offering.
Hands shaking, Dean dug around Sam’s jacket for his phone. Bringing up Cas’ name, he froze. What would he say? What would Cas do — will he think Dean hurt Sam? Will he blame Dean for this? Dean didn’t think he could handle being wrongly accused again. It tore him apart and he still wasn’t completely back together again from what happened in the bunker after he killed Ephraim.
Crowley released Dean’s throat and pulled the towel roughly away from Dean before crashing his mouth into his in a rough possessive kiss. Dean froze. This was the first time Crowley had touched him in anger.
Sam looked confused. “Who?”  That was followed by, “What the hell are you talking about, Dean?” Sam blurted out, flabbergasted by Dean’s question. Why the hell would he be asking about Amelia of all people?
Here are the last two chapters for you.  This chapter was the original epilogue so it reads as such but I didn't want it to be confusing having two epilogues so I made it a chapter.
“But the one thing I never got from the countless stories was that you were such an enfant gâté.”  Benny finished with a satisfied smile when Sam’s eyes flared and he took a step forward.  He knew enough French to know Benny was calling him a child.
So here it is, Abaddon was behind John's resurrection.  How many of you had guessed it was her?  I know it seemed a little out of the blue but I tried to drop some hints here and there.
Cas frowned.  “Why not?  It’s true.  Dean, will you let me take care of you and show you how much I love you?”
“Keep you chained to the bed, use you whenever I want, maybe even sell you a few times so we don’t need to deal with the stolen cards anymore. Then when we figure out the monster we bring you in for the kill. Our very own little bitch, tearing into monsters and then turning ass up for us when done. What’d you think Sam. You in? I bet you always wanted a piece of that ass, I mean anyone who looks at him does.” John said with a leer.
Jeff and Joe have video of the flashback Dean had along with others which depict Dean being abused sexually and physically and also show John raping Dean.  They attempt to blackmail Dean with them.  Sam interrupts and Dean almost kills Jeff and Joe.  Sam gets scared of Dean.
Please leave kudos and comments if you are enjoying the story.  I can't tell you how happy they  make me.
Dean jerked slightly at the abrupt change in the direction of the conversation.  “I think so, I know I’ve really enjoyed them and spending time with you.  You’ve kinda awesome.” Dean admitted with a smile and was rewarded with a big one in return.
Dean yelled, struggling to break free. He tried to focus on the Mark, but Dream Guy took another strand, whispered some words and flung it at Dean. Dean could only watch in horror as the string circled his arm right above the band, swirling so fast it was a gold blur and then it stopped, rearranged itself and molded itself to Dean’s arm. A perfect replica of the band, but there were dozens more of the twirls Dean used to control the Mark on the new band.
Dean shook his head slightly trying to clear his vision when his eyes caught movement from the doorway.  Dean saw a flash of something moving faster than any human as the being barreled into Drake tackling him to the floor.
“You should see the other guys.”  He joked but then winced in pain.  Now that he was thinking about it, he could no longer ignore the persistent throbbing.  “It's just bruises and cuts, maybe a broken rib and some knuckles.  It’s fine.  I’m fine.”  Dean said.  He unconsciously rubbed a hand over the Mark, fear unwittingly flashing across his face when he thought about the fight again.
When Dean winks at Cas and Sam I pictured the scene in the green room when Dean winks at Sam right before he kills Zachariah.
Hi everyone, I am so so sorry for the long wait.  This chapter was so hard.  I had written a similar talk and I had a really hard time separating the two and coming at it from a different angle.  So worst case of writer's block ever!  I actually had to pull my beta the wonderful AnotherWorld3111 out of her break to help me fix it, so thank you again AnotherWorld311 for all the help.   When I finally got motivated to finish I felt bad for making you wait and since I added on 4 extra chapters I decided to get more art, and the very talented MidnightSilver was gracious enough to work around the holidays, so I hope you enjoy the surprise.
“What the fuck!” The other demon who had come to the table yelled. “You can't — you're not allowed!” He said, shocked and finally showing the fear he should have afforded Dean in the first place.
I changed the tags to include major character death.  I'm sorry if any of you are upset that I didn't put that up at the beginning but it would have been a huge spoiler, and you know it was John so...
“You know, I really enjoyed possessing people. I liked hearing them scream and feeling their terror and confusion. You took that away from me.” The demon spat, pushing his face closer to Dean’s.
I couldn't help it.  I'm still a sucker for Crowley and Dean and Crowley helping Dean out even without his knowledge fit with the story and I believe with canon from the show.
“Benny!”  Dean repeated in disbelief.  “You talked to Benny?”  Aside from Crowley, Benny was Cas’s least favorite person — or being, in this case.
At the sound of footsteps crunching on the leaves, Dean sighed loudly. For fucks sake, it wasn’t like he was hurting anyone here. Although, technically the place was still property of the MOL, so Dean really didn’t have the right to be here. Hastily wiping his tears away, Dean stood up and turned to watch his brother coming up the dock.
It made Sam feel angry and despondent that they still hadn’t figured out how to get that Mark off Dean’s arm.  Some really bad hunts had forced them to bring the First Blade out and after each use Dean’s control wavered more.  Then there was that awful two week period that Sam was still mostly in the dark about, but since then Dean has been slipping fast.
John took the decision out of Dean’s hands when he grabbed Dean pulling him into a too tight hug. Dean hesitated for a minute but noticing the goofy happy grin on Sam’s face, put his arms around his dad and patted his back pulling away as soon as possible. John smirked at Dean’s obvious discomfort, the look only noticed by Dean.
Triggers include references to non-con touching and drug use, violence and Dean's abandonment issues.
John was obviously exhausted and it was late so they all decided to get some rest before they filled in their dad about their lives. Dean tossed and turned most of the night barely sleeping. He should have known something bad would happen when he was on the verge of being happy for once Dean groused to himself but then immediately felt guilty because no matter how horrible John was, he was still his dad. Dean should be glad that he was alive, but all he could feel was fear.
