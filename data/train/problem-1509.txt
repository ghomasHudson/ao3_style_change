Sherlock sleeps the dreamless sleep of the exhausted. But only until 4:20am. John is half-spooned to him when he awakes, arms crossed loosely in front of his chest, body a comma at his side. Dead asleep. Their hands had come loose but their naked feet touch under the covers that have slid down around their waists. It is still peacefully dark outside with just a hint of morning. In the light from the street lamps Sherlock can make out the forms of his furniture, the door and the analogue alarm clock on his bedside table. Everything appears a bit shapeless, blurred around the edges. The window is a square patch of lighter grey tinged with orange in the wall at his right. On his left John’s dark silhouette rises and falls in smooth breaths of air - the incarnation of sleepy warmth and comfort.
Sherlock turns to Lestrade, who is checking the latch of the only window in the room wide enough to allow in anything bigger than a cat. He won’t have any luck with it, though, Sherlock has already established with a quick glance. It’s perfectly in shape and has not been tempered with.
Just for trying to set the mood for this chapter: There is that superstition that it means seven years of bad sex if you don't look into each other's eyes the moment you clink your glass to someone. Some people strongly live by that. If you've never heard about that before, now you have.
“Okay,” he says and his voice sounds a bit flat.
“Well, I am not proud of the role I played in the whole game. As you well know I have delivered information where I should have known better and kept you in the dark, so I have come to terms with… offering my advice in that matter of yours, Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock thinks this over and,
"How do you know?"
The doorbell rings and Sherlock has half a mind to yell downstairs to Mrs. Hudson because he cannot be bothered. He is sprawled on the sofa, arms and head half off the cushions, in a deep strop. There is a case pending that Lestrade hasn’t asked him to consult on yet, but it’s an open secret that NSY’s finest are at their wits’ ends and Sherlock is sure he will be summoned at some point. There is a new experiment researching cardiac arrhythmias, for which he has secured the mice but not the toxin. And Mycroft, who wants to consult him about an extremely vocal MP gone rogue on Brexit. But every few seconds his mind comes back to the present John has announced that he has for him. Sherlock is so deep within his head immediately after the doorbell quietens that he nearly misses the clatter on seventeen stairs and the creak of the door to their sitting room.
mystery. Glancing up at John, who’d downright refused to enlighten him in terms of said present’s contents, Sherlock wonders if he can make a quick dash downstairs and chalk it up as getting them breakfast.
Sherlock swallows convulsively.
“Ouch, shit.”
"You have me so close," Sherlock breathed, arching his back to intensify their contact, his eyes dark with pleasure. John rolled his hips, his lips parted, before he gave a vicious little thrust.
He walked past her and gave her a smile before ascending the stairs. Mrs. Hudson seemed to linger for another moment, her eyes probably following him upstairs but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He just felt so tired.
It’s not like he doesn’t have a libido, mind, but it doesn’t go together well with
There, in the surprisingly empty space under the bed, sat a small wooden box. It seemed a far too pristine location to be there by chance and John crawled into the narrow space to retrieve it, his fingers sweating. He sat on the floor in front of Sherlock’s bed and held the box in his hands, strong emotions washing through him. But then he felt the part of him that was so very concerned for Sherlock’s health and well-being take control and he opened the lid.
“It’s all yours,” he said and to his surprise Sherlock laughed.
“No,” he says, “it’s not flowers. Men don’t get flowers on Valentine’s Day, they don’t” and Sherlock joints in his laughter, affectionately pecking John’s nose. They look at each other and John’s open smile is nearly blinding. It makes Sherlock’s heart lurch hard in his chest.
"And how much help they were", Sherlock muttered a little too loudly for John to miss.
A few seconds later he notices an ink stain on the dead man’s throat and instantly knows how he has come to death and how deliciously clever the killer has prepared the whole scene. Time to impress the mortals. He shoves the glances John has given him from his mind, launches into his deductions and thoroughly enjoys Anderson fuming with helpless rage - only to remember them hours later when they are back at 221B again. With the memory comes the confusion and it thoroughly irks Sherlock that it all doesn't make sense.
want to deal with Mycroft and Brexit - and John is the most important person in his universe, Sherlock regards him closer. John’s hair is combed back neatly and the lights that bounce off the gold-silver hues in his hair highlight his blue eyes. His simple blue-grey jumper does wonders for his complexion, even in the neon light of Bart’s lab. The dark jeans hug his legs and hips in all the right places, his shoes are threadbare but clean. Which suggests...
When he found nothing, he moved to the bed. Sherlock hadn’t slept in it last night, of that John was very sure. He gently lifted the dark blue duvet and soft cream sheets with both hands. It felt very intimate to him and his heartbeat accelerated. He was nervous and fought to resist the urge to press the sheets to his nose. Longing was building in him, a terribly sad longing towards the man inhabiting this bedroom. Being in here suddenly felt like a very sensitive, personal and highly intimate journey through his feelings towards the other man and he blushed at the thought of the words “Sherlock Holmes” and “romantic and sexual issue” in the same room. Gathering himself, he got down on his knees and looked under the bed.
They were still crouching on their stomachs, John lying behind Sherlock, the space between his back and his waistband terribly empty because his gun lay in the drawer at home. How could he have been so stupid to forget it?
“I just want to make sure, I guess. What made you change your mind about--“
It has hit him square in the chest how his body and mind had reacted to John and how they have crossed the bounds of their friendship and moved towards new territory. Sherlock isn’t one to normally believe in the construct of stage fright or, more ridiculously put, performance anxiety. His mind is a powerful weapon after all and it has led him through quite a number of challenging situations. Sadly it is not the first thing that seems to matter now and upon catching his own reflection in the mirror Sherlock had a moment of juvenile doubt followed by tentative self-assessment.
“Leave me out of this, mate,” he mutters darkly, his sturdy hands clenched into fists, eyes dull. Leaving the deeply confounding and frankly abominable combination of
They were in what appeared to be in a small office, no more than a few square meters, no windows, and hardly any space. Sherlock threw his shoulder into the door but it didn’t open.
Lestrade acts as if Mycroft’s name and Sherlock’s implication don’t faze him, which only acts as the last clue Sherlock needs. He steeples his fingers under his chin, a cruel smile on his face.
He still doesn’t know what it means but he’s certain now he can trigger John into doing it again at any time convenient for further examinations.
Thank you again as always to my BAMF-beta-reader Kisa, who sometimes understands Sherlock better than she wants to.
Sherlock has to gloss over his fit of blushing with an indignant roll of his eyes and only barely notices Lestrade emerging around the corner to the kitchen because he feels so dizzy. Lestrade lifts the small plastic bag with his left hand, the phone still in his right, and makes mock goggle eyes at them. “Are you done schmoozing?” Lestrades says. Sherlock instantly snaps into case mode and points at the evidence to once again demonstrate his superiority. “This has been found in the victim’s stomach,” he says for John’s benefit. “It is a part of a plaid, made of small wooden balls, all slightly elliptical like this one here,” he states and there is that gloating sparkle that lights up his eyes. “Very fashionable with Pakistani cabbies I might say.” He tilts his head slightly. “Come along, John, there must be more to this abduction than we‘ve found so far. Try to confirm where the cabbie is, get him and text me, Graham. We’ll meet you at the Yard. You have two hours.”
“Do me a favour and go alone, I need to buy a new phone and give my brother hell.”
“As I said before, I’ve done a lot of thinking in the past four days. Moriarty forced me to act when I hadn’t seen it coming. I went to Serbia to set it right. It took longer than I thought,” he said in that deep baritone of his and huffed with impatience. But then a soft glimmer appeared in his eyes.
Of course all of these measures cannot be undertaken now and, over the rim of his menu card, Sherlock eyes John warily.
, love, and no one else.”
A few moments later John seems to be done reading the descriptions of the different dishes and meets Sherlock’s gaze over the menu card. “Care to share a bottle of wine?” he asks, his tone carefully neutral, and licks his lips. “Rosé or white?”
It hit John how his words must have sounded, and what they were potentially implying. He blushed hard, the memory of the desperate kiss they shared vivid in his mind.
The way it does now. Sherlock shakes his head in recalcitrance when he realizes that the
Looking up without meeting his eyes John noticed Sherlock’s glass was still half full, the champagne presumably gone stale. He chuckled under his breath because he knew Sherlock wasn’t much of a drinker, anyway.
John mouths a kiss to his shoulder. “Of course you’d do something— extraordinary. We can trade embarrassing childhood stories, if that makes you feel save,” John offers a moment later and huffs exaggeratedly. “I’ve learned the clarinet when I was eight but I can’t say I’d recommend listening to me play. I am dreadful. And in seventh grade—”
“You’re dressed up,” he states, and with a wave of his hand indicates Lestrade’s crisp white shirt, his orderly tie and polished shoes. He is even wearing a proper suit and Sherlock feels his hackles rise when conclusions fall into line.
“It was nothing, just Sherlock being…”
John dabs his lips again and Sherlock is thoroughly and helplessly captivated. Why has he never noticed all these possibilities before? They are plentiful - everything that could potentially be imaginable between two human beings and,
“Your lip is bleeding.”
“Maybe it’s live mice,” he says in lieu of a better explanation but then hmmm’s. “But I’ve already ordered live mice.” They are with Molly at Bart’s, which may be a mistake because Molly is already disgustingly fond of them.
John shook his head, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
He turned his gaze to John.
John stalled the question by sharing a languid kiss, feeling utterly smitten again.
This is the moment that John glances at him again. It hits Sherlock totally unguarded how his blue eyes flash upwards through fair lashes to meet his and it has a rather unexpected effect on him. An effect that surprisingly doesn’t primarily express itself in a tingle down his spine and that sweet, sweet pressure in his neck, right at his hairline.
Facing the inevitable, John slumped against the wall, his lip throbbing. There was nothing they could do now but wait. He felt Sherlock watching him from where he stood and decided that it couldn’t be helped. They were cold, he was bleeding, his head ached, and there was no possibility of forcing their way out of the room right now. Slowly he heaved himself off of the wall, walked over to where Sherlock was leaning against the table, and sat next to him. All of his energy had evaporated, the adrenaline high had subsided, and he suddenly noticed how worn, tired, and frozen he was.
It felt—
“Is this your chief concern?” John arches an eyebrow at him, his face open and accessible, and Sherlock feels like a schoolboy who had sneaked a pushpin onto the chair of his teacher and got caught out.
“Can’t you deduce it?” John asks into the wind and turns up his chin. The tiny gold flecks in his eyes are very dark in the weak light around them but, nevertheless, they are there again. As is John’s scent of cucumber and tea. Sherlock’s eyes close of their own volition as he inhales deeply, quite overwhelmed and heart pounding and when he opens them again, the spark between them has flared back to life.
“I think we should start at the beginning, Sherlock.” John’s voice is calm and steady. He is still gripping Sherlock’s wrist but his fingers have slacked a bit and slipped down to Sherlock’s palm. A look of determination comes into his eyes. “I was texting Molly at the lab,” he explains, “because she asked me if you’ve gotten your present. To tell you the truth she encouraged me in buying it for you in the first place. I thought it would help me get things along. Make myself clear. But instead of mine you received someone else’s and that has gotten you all worked up and I confess I was pissed that you dragged me off to Bart’s when all I wanted was for you to receive and open
Sherlock’s hand that wasn’t holding his flew to his mouth, fingers touching his full bottom lip, a trace of shyness in his eyes.
Sherlock hoisted himself up on his elbows after he had pushed his curls out of his face. A wistful look came into his eyes.
“You are my friend and I am so glad I got you back.”
Sherlock closes his eyes, goes still and wills his body into calming. He can feel John do the same. The time for being lovers isn’t now but it will come into existence. Sherlock wants it to and secretly hopes it will be very soon.
John didn’t get the chance at a reproach because he suddenly saw a movement from the corner of his eyes at the window which they had climbed out of a few minutes ago. A man appeared at the crossbar.

It is something people say for the dramatic effect.
“Things cannot be changed in a rush, John. You’ve got to be patient with me--”
And then, yes, somehow Sherlock had kissed him back and fiercely so. He even tried to do it again, twice, before Lestrade’s visit had put it all to an end. Before it had gotten so out of hand. But what was he to make of that? John knew Sherlock cared a great deal for him, in his own twisted way…
“I won’t change my mind” John whisperes, repeating his words from only half an hour earlier and Sherlock, totally illogically, thinks how much he hates repetition but maybe emotional conversations, not that he’s ever had them before, require a certain amount of homonymic sentences. It’s an experiment he’s never conducted.
“Are you hungry? I’m doing chicken sandwi— “
his hips into John where he so readily lies underneath him, barely able to move. To hear him gasp Sherlock’s name. To untangle him, learn him, smell him,
“How are you feeling?”
“Listen, Sherlock,” he said, his voice too weak in his own ears, and he switched the telly volume to mute.
Sherlock was staring at the man at the door, who just smiled wider and stepped further into the room, gun ready in his hand.
The only response Sherlock finds himself capable of is letting it happen. When John’s mouth collides with his, he freezes, blinks and immediately runs a scan over his whole body and where it touches John’s to assure himself that this is really happening. But since John doesn’t pull back and instead presses his lips more firmly against Sherlock’s, it is indeed happening. A frisson jolts through him but the warmth that follows in its wake is soothing and comforting where it pools in Sherlock’s guts and he shapes up and presses back before his shocked rigidness can deter John and let him come to the wrong conclusion.
He decides humanity is rather lost as he trudges up the stairs and shuts the door with a loud bang.
“That- that was- John. Can we, can we do that again?” Sherlock hears himself whisper after an interminable amount of time when his mouth is done claiming John’s. He is panting slightly, his hands have found their way around John’s hips and John has tilted his body to accommodate his awkward position - his legs pressing into Sherlock’s right armpit, his kneecaps under Sherlock’s angled elbow so they can embrace, his back slightly curved inwards and his buttocks in the hollow between Sherlock’s semi-opened thighs. There is hardly any space left between them now and it’s elation and bliss and Sherlock’s is still filing away data into his mind palace for further dissection and replay. Every single snippet lodges somewhere to form interior, embellishment and shape, and while a completely new structure is being built, every detail forms half a dozen questions. Sherlock wonders how many of them are visible on his face as he looks at John again.
“Good.”
, which is old-fashioned and pedestrian and overall hateful. Sherlock would so love to live in sin with John. His private fantasies have, so far, been rather innocent on that front, but after all that had happened with Victor he’d repressed that particular part of himself and had exiled it into the deepest vaults of his mind palace.
, rather romantic with the candle on their table and the proximity between them.
John could just stare at him and shake his head slightly.
John huffed, shaking his head in disbelieve.
Another notion he cannot disregard is, no matter what Sherlock decides to do, no matter his proclivity, this is a matter of delicacy and not something he could just decide for them both, put his foot down and barrel through. He cannot just announce his conclusion and expect John to follow along like the doctor does on cases. Like he does on most of their ventures, on most of the things they indulge in. He cannot convince John to be with him in
"Wait, you need to clink your glass to mine and look into my eyes, otherwise it's seven years of bad sex."
“Come on. Stay close to me.”
“Sherlock,” John says quietly and crouches protectively by his side. The gun is still in his hands and his presence suddenly looms everywhere around Sherlock when their eyes lock. John is all business and Sherlock huffs a breath in stressed gratefulness. “There is far too much blood here for only one body and this” John confirms Sherlock’s secret vision from only seconds ago while his small and sturdy hand comes forward, indicating the body “this has been done recently. She’s been dead for maybe only 6 to 9 hours.”
“Depends on the someone, I guess.”
“That was really graceful,” he says gently and swallows, “I really— It’s fascinating.”
“Forget about it.”
“Irrelevant, I-“ he replies but the next flicker of his phone gives him pause.
Sherlock blinks.
"Now would you stop being petulant. Greg and his team did help a lot, it’s their job. Don't ever forget how they don't have to let you participate at all."
“I don’t want anything you’re not willing to give,” he counters and Sherlock again has to admire his conviction and how content he seems to be in offering so much, nerves notwithstanding. It is a bit irritating. Sherlock clears his throat to try and reason with him. And his own traitorous heart, which is rapidly beating away behind his rib cage.
wants to start solving.
Inhaling deeply to muster his courage he noticed faint traces of cold smoke and the slight metallic smell of the morgue on him but it didn’t bother him. He inhaled again.
He chuckled, feeling weirdly tense now that he had shed his doctor mode again. Handling Sherlock when he needed to be patched up or fussed over, being close to him, touching him was one thing. But now that he couldn’t hide behind that excuse anymore he didn’t know what to do with himself. He felt bad and just so tired of it all. Looking down at Sherlock he felt his eyes sting.
Sherlock looked smug now. John couldn't believe it. He felt a faint warmth creep into his cheeks and his fingers turned sweaty. Why on earth would this impossible man go and google his date? He licked his lips.
, the pocket of the boy’s raincoat may have preserved the material from the direct effects of the Thames water but Sherlock’s guess is that the body has only been disposed of mere hours before it had been found. He pulls the booklet out carefully and puts it on the table for later examination. Then he pries his fingers under the back of the case behind the CD to thoroughly take apart the whole ensemble.
He felt like a fool. Again.
“Mrs. Hudson, I am very tired and really need to get out of these dirty clothes.”
evening at the last minute.” It’s quite terrifying how angry he can get at his own voice stating facts, because Sherlock would
He left the hospital a few hours later after a doctor had checked his head again, stripping off the bandage to replace it with a new one. Since he had only his clothes from the night before yesterday he walked out of the main entrance in muddied trousers and a badly stained jacket. Deciding to take a walk instead of immediately hailing a cab, he meandered through the streets, taking his time. He would have to face everything soon enough. It was a nice and sunny day, after all. When he reached a little bakery on a street corner he decided to treat himself to a sweet breakfast and decent coffee. Lifting his arm to open the door he noticed a black sleek car stopping next to him on the pavement and when he turned to fully look at it, Mycroft Holmes got out of the back door.
John’s phone chimes twice before Sherlock has finished taking fingerprints from the stationery and feed them to the NSY database. It chimes again when Sherlock scrutinizes the velvet inlay of the box. John checks all three messages but only answers the first, leaving the other acknowledged but pending. His whole body language conveys a combination of nervousness and tiredness, his shoulders set in tense lines, when he dutifully announces that the data scan for the fingerprints has come up without any results. Which was to be expected, Sherlock guesses, still happily intrigued. Only fools make mistakes and so far his anonymous admirer doesn’t belong into that category. The whole thing is too well executed to be coincidental. However, Sherlock is no closer to cracking his mysterious Valentine’s Day present and it will presumably take at least 12 hours for Molly to define all the toxins in the foxglove petals, whether their presence is natural or not. When she tells him so, Sherlock feels an unexpected fit of generosity and points out that he is the one to make the next move now in this game, that the mystery is going nowhere and that, for now, he has other leads to follow. Out of the corners of his eyes he sees John glance at him.
His voice sounded rather hoarse. The part of John’s brain that wasn’t busy overlooking the street or being afraid put that aside given their current situation. He raised his hand to shush him, craning his neck to get a better look around.
“What? You told me you were taking her out tonight, you said you’ve finally made up your mind and you have a plan and she’s beautiful. What happened?”
It had always been a known fact to John Watson, that there were things unimaginable that, to no one’s better or worse judgment, found their way into reality. Things one could not, in any case, be prepared for. When confronted with something with which that was the case he would either dig his nose into business, get it done and learn as much as possible or find a way to work around it and prepare for next time. He wasn’t much of an ignorer and had always prided himself with a certain boldness and a good thirst for both knowledge and imagination. The latter proved to be unreliable sometimes but he put that to human nature and not necessarily his own personality. Imagination had served him well most of the time, even though he wasn’t a great fan of getting lost in day dreaming. His practical nature had always restrained him in that matter.
, so it’s useless and usually beaten into submission, so it cannot trouble or distract him.
They met in the middle, both on their knees, and John brought one of his thighs in between Sherlock’s. Sliding up his hands he fumbled with the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt until he could push it off his slender shoulders. Sherlock’s own hands were trembling at John’s waist, clumsily trying to push the concealing garment upwards and John, never leaving his eyes, grabbed his own shirt and took it off without further ado.
Lestrade’s strained growl hardly hides his annoyance as Sherlock sweeps by him. John placates the DI with a pat to his shoulder, eyes dancing and colour rising in his cheeks, before they hurry downstairs onto the street behind Sherlock, who has already flung out his arm to hail an empty cab.
Sherlock’s hands came up, softly stroking from hips upwards over his abdomen and chest to his shoulders and back down again, skin to skin. There was nothing to hide anymore. Catching his lower lip between his teeth again Sherlock let his fingers rest onto John's hipbones. Neither of them said a word and the only sound that could be heard was their deep breathing. God, just looking at Sherlock, his face flushed down to his collarbones, was enough to make John want him more than he’d ever wanted anything before. It took him a lot of effort to take his time and not throw himself onto Sherlock, whose eyes were huge and tinged with awkwardness. But after a moment he squared his shoulders and determinedly reached down to rest his hands onto the fly of John’s trousers, where John’s met them.
Sherlock lifts his head slightly but John is examining the body's head wound now, his nitrile-gloved hands gently stroking dark hair out of its forehead. His face belies his considerate touch, though. It is all professional business when he moves closer to get a better look. John is a very good doctor and always pays the appropriate amount of compassion and earnestness to his work, no matter if the body he is tending to is dead or alive.
John’s answer doesn’t disappoint.
“Uhm,” he breathes but it’s hard somehow to align his thoughts with the surroundings. All the words are gone.
It takes a long moment before he can safely step away again and loosen his touch on John. John tucks his dark grey cardigan securely over the gun at his back where it has come up his sides, his blue eyes wide and twinkling. “Come on,” he says at normal volume and it looks like he has to fight to hide a besotted smile. “Let’s go get you solve that case, then I’ll cook you chicken and chickpeas and you can tell me all about ballet.”
"How many scoops? -- I can't believe I overlooked how human eyeballs react to high temperature on close -- John, hand me that book over there."
myself.” He points accusingly at Sherlock, and his voice rises in indignation. “While you’re just hanging around Bart’s being an utter prick and harassing poor Molly. Who, I’ll have you know, also has a date tonight.”
“Then your men are not watching him sufficiently enough. I am sure he did buy drugs, I just never noticed the effects. But he is a great actor. We know that.”
An “Oh” escapes his lips as everything falls into place and finally, blissfully, the context of John's reaction and words at home and later in the lab make just that much more sense.
Sherlock stiffens and stands very still. Pirouetting has brought him close to the door without him noticing and John must have caught him in his arms when he unsuspectingly entered the flat.
“And spoil all the fun?”
opportunity that will present itself in any way, shape or form to taunt them about their hilarious timeframe of deciding to actually start dating. It may all be rather pathetic but leverage against Mycroft is leverage against Mycroft, and therefore precious and rare.
thankfully gets stuck just below his Adam’s apple.
“If I remember correctly, there is a broken-down wall two streets from here. From there, we could escape into the next subway,” he heard Sherlock whisper, his chest heaving rapidly, his shoulder touching the side of John’s body with every breath.
John nods, smiles tiredly and rubs his eyes, the slight tension around his shoulders dissipating. “I am well knackered, so yeah, of course. You’re on a case, I am happy you propose to sleep at all.”
John’s face goes blank and too late Sherlock realizes the innuendo.
But he didn’t get any further. A clicking noise from the door told them that someone was coming.
Thank you, Kisa, my omni-potent beta-reader.
let Mycroft and Lestrade know he’s been granted his heart’s desire on the completely absurd an embarrassingly pathetic Valentine’s Day,
Sherlock let go of his hand at the door and swiftly moved around the bed to switch on a small light while John closed the door, a feeling of both finality and nervousness settling in his stomach. When he turned around he saw how Sherlock’s teeth worried his lower lip.
Sherlock shook his head but Lestrade nodded emphatically.
“Ah, not much, basically,” Sherlock answered, fidgeting, his shoulders tense, his eyes suddenly fixed on the floor.
“And what are you missing?”
is the one you allow to follow - and to lead.
in any which way, it would feel safest and most acceptable with John...
“You tried to tell me before, Sherlock. I am sorry I wasn’t paying attention,” he said and Sherlock smiled, his ears getting red and hot.
Sherlock’s mind tries to provide words his lips are both anxious and curious of testing the feel of. His hands brush over firm muscles and enticing panes of skin, the relief on John’s shirt under his fingertips hinting at an array of sparse hair around a delicate nipple. He gets momentarily distracted again and has to shape up.
“What do you mean?” he asks and Sherlock indicates the space their bodies create in the secluded area of their kitchen as well as everything that had happened between them so far. John thinks for a moment again and then says “I don’t know what it is you’re feeling but for me— yeah. Yes— it feels like that.”
“I’ve been waiting for you to ask,” John says and Sherlock is chuffed to notice the twinkle is back in his eyes. “You didn’t forget about it.”
“You’re useless.“ he says with vitriol. And then amends. “Why didn’t you come to me yesterday?”
They had sat like that in the hospital bed just a few days ago and Sherlock had leaned in to kiss him. And sitting here on their couch at home, John wished he would do it again; lean in and kiss him. Slowly, thoroughly, deeper than they had had a chance to at the hospital and certainly softer and sweeter than Sherlock had kissed him behind that batch of trash - when he had pressed John to his body like he’d never wanted to let go again, when the last thing they could have done was kiss before they lost the chance to. Before there was time to regret or screw it up completely. The thought hurt.
Donovan had left muttering “…makes two freaks now, my ass…” and Lestrade, both flummoxed and highly entertained, though he didn’t hide either very well, had told John he could as well use Donovan’s computer now that she has removed herself to effectively from the immediate surroundings.
“John… I...”
Sherlock stares as John beckons him to get out of the cab and opens his own door. Folding his long limbs, Sherlock listlessly spills out onto the pavement and together they watch the cab drive off, before John turns to finally look at him.
Sherlock sat very still next to him, so John went on, working everything off his heart in a rush. It seemed like, after what they’d been through together in the past weeks, what he’d been through in the past four days, he needed to make things clear between them. He didn’t care about giving up and saying what he had to say didn’t feel like it.
Sherlock had already taken off on his long legs, dark cloak billowing behind him. John cleared his throat and followed, feeling fatalistic all of a sudden. Sherlock’s head turned when he caught up with him, lips forming an expectant smile.
John’s voice suddenly sounds alarmed. “Talk to me, Sherlock— are you going into shock?”
John shifts on the couch but refrains to follow his apparent urge to put his feet on the coffee table to get more comfortable and crosses his ankles instead. Sherlock smirks. Smart attire amidst an air of relaxation, that suits John like a second skin. Unfortunately John doesn’t own enough smart dress shirts or even nicely shaped jumpers to placate Sherlock’s taste in fashion. He usually refrains from telling John so after the first time they had that particular discussion and John had been non too pleased when Sherlock had pointed out how some people’s grandfathers dressed younger. The next day John had worn a dark tight shirt under his coat on his way to the surgery but neither had commented it.
Sherlock’s chest feels very tight when he lowers his leg. He doesn’t really know where to put his arms because John is still holding him loosely in his. He solves the problem in letting them slouch at his sides.
“It’s something you need, Sherlock, something that I hope will make you happy,” John says… before he winks at him.
The words are uttered in an urgent whisper, full of force. They make Sherlock lock onto grey eyes again.
“Where do you think you’re going?” John’s voice is sleepy and raw but he intensifies his warm grip around him.
Upon hearing the last sentence John shook his head viciously, his lips drawn into a tight line.
“I won’t change my mind, Sherlock. Go take a shower, I will be here.”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to answer and catches his lower lip between his teeth, puzzled.
“Why did you never say?” he chooses to inquire and hopes it promises the greatest amount of data to help his case and solve this enigma which is John Watson and the way he looks at him now.
“Trivialities are not my area.”
“You really alright, Sherlock? You seemed zoned out just now. Is there anything I can—.”
Technically, John has touched him many many times during their acquaintance. Has patched him up when he got himself hurt, has fussed over him, brushed his fingers while handing him tea or food. Draped him in a blanket and tucked it in around his feet and arms when he fell asleep on the sofa and put a hand on the small of his back or onto his shoulder to guide him out of restaurants or into cabs. And Sherlock has done the same with John. Less so because he isn’t a natural with touching but still. It’s what friends do, isn’t it? They have once even hold hands,
If Sherlock never hears from Irene Adler again, it will be too soon. He doesn’t regret to have saved her life in Pakistan but, fascinating and dangerous creature that she is, she’s come close, so very close to hurting him, to ruining him. If his heart hadn’t already been signed with another’s name it could have become hers and she would have used it to her own advantages, which would have been more than he could possibly have handled. Which is why as Sherlock had looked into her eyes in a hotel room somewhere in India, where she’s offered herself for him to take, and seen the darkness lurking there, he’d resolutely sent her back to her own room before they’d finally parted ways and left the country in the dead of night.
His voice was dripping sarcasm and John huffed impatiently.
Maybe he’s just missing the essential puzzle piece but Sherlock’s mind is running in circles and just
Rolling his head back into the pillow, he squints towards the window to estimate the time through the angle of sunlight that spills into the room, but the day is overcast and the results therefore inconclusive. Sherlock hums and on his chest, John’s arm flexes before tightening firmly around him and pulling him even closer. Which is quite a feat, Sherlock admires, because John is already wrapped up so tight around him; it feels quite possessive, yes, but also deeply
“Sherlock, what’s the matter with you? It’s not your case.” He glowers and Sherlock looks closer to pry for something he can use to derail the DI. Make him shut up and leave.
“I can imagine.”
“A genius, as usual,” Lestrade chipped in. John shrugged. There was nothing else to say on the matter. John saw Lestrade’s face taking on a very paternal expression.
Sherlock stretched his long limps and turned onto his stomach, his hair tousled and his eyes small from sleep. John mirrored him and they were both tilting their heads to look at each other. Sherlock smiled and his face was open and unguarded.
Sherlock scoffs. “Please John, ‘ordinary’ is an insult in the language I speak.” This is followed by a moment of silence before Sherlock caves under John’s gaze. “It feels like I am out of my comfort zone,” he admits, and as an afterthought, elaborates “But in a nice way, actually. If I were to look at it in a scientific fashion, I’d say romantic inclination is basically a change in neurotransmission, a release of hormones, of dopamine, testosterone, oxytocin, neurotrophin and serotonin. Oh, and don’t forget the socio-scientific approach even though this literal combination is an abomination. Our culture is full of romanticisms about affairs of the heart and favors it with analogies and flamboyant description…”
“You are you,” he says, as if this explains everything.
“We’ve gotten hold on our prime suspect in the drug lab case, they are just bringing him in. Sherlock will be pleased, he spent the last three days locating him for us and digging up more evidence in the morgue.”
“Don’t shoot them, we don’t wanna attract too much attention. But we’ll make sure they don’t run.”
say anything, they will resume their precarious dance right at the edge, forever stuck in limbo.
“We can be everything, Sherlock.” His own name is a sweet weight of breath on Sherlock’s lips before John slides in and kisses him again, his relieve palpable. “Everything. I want us to figure it out – slowly so we’ll get it right, I want to get it right. But, god, Sherlock, you’re all I want. I
“All the hardship, all the… everything. You are worth everything, John. It’s the truth,” he whispered and his eyes were huge pools of green. He looked terrified but at the same time so heartbreakingly honest, his face open, allowing John to read the words he had just said in his eyes again.
This whole talking thing, the need to give voice to circumstance and sentiment is really and utterly ridiculous and Sherlock huffs in annoyance. It’s all tedious. John and he have never really talked, hadn’t needed to, because there had always been an understanding between them that didn’t require discussing things at lengths. They had taken to one another’s lives, had evolved around each other, gravitated around each other and things had been fine. Sherlock had led the way and John had, albeit grudgingly sometimes, accepted the direction and followed, attuning to his views and situational needs as they went and even when Sherlock had come back after his fall, there hadn’t really been a proper discussion. Sherlock had maneuvered them into a life-threatening situation and John had followed. Over a bomb about to blow up Sherlock had explained the rudimentary basics, had apologized in the passing and John had forgiven him; that had been that. Ten days later John had moved back into 221b and it all had been sufficient and satisfying. A satisfying outcome they could both very well live with.
“John, calm down, no one’s going to blow up the flat. We’ve already had that.”
“Don’t even think about it, man,” a voice above him resounded. John felt strong hands grab his arms and jacket, hurling him back to his feet. The man guarding Sherlock had stepped closer to the tall detective, and pressed his gun onto his pale temple, forcing his head to tilt into an uncomfortable angle. John noticed that Sherlock’s hands were clenched into fists.
“You utter cock! You changed everything when you kissed me back. I must know what's behind it all!”
“My god, John, I am so sorry I didn’t say it earlier but I thought you’d moved on.”
Sweet little sounds escaped Sherlock’s lips with every kiss John bestowed onto his body and John wondered momentarily who else had ever had the fabulous pleasure of doing what he was at the moment. When his lips arrived at his navel he dipped his tongue into it, making Sherlock shudder and gasp and roll his hips up to grind his arousal into John’s abdomen. His name fell from Sherlock’s lips like a prayer.
“Sherlock, calm down, I was only out dating. Having fun, not getting myself-- engaged.”
“But thank you… in a way…”
But he didn’t get far. Sherlock turned his head away from him, his arm rigid on John’s shoulder.
He has always prided himself with a certain reliable detachedness that comes with usually being the observer and never part of the scene, but sitting here in a dirty tunnel with blood all around him and a very accurate idea about the agony the young woman must have lived through before someone has brought her to a violent death, Sherlock finds the narrow walls suffocating him and something in him just cracks.
Is that really how it is supposed to be? University has long since wrapped and,
He sighs and feels very hot all over again and, with pride but unfathomable difficulty, decides against cupping his hand around himself because it’s distracting and just all too much now without someone with him to actually respond to.
Sherlock’s eyes showed everything but his full attention and his thumb stopped circling John’s hipbones. John slid off his hips to sit between his legs. In this position he was smaller again but the lost contact with Sherlock’s most private parts helped him clear his brain and made coherent thought possible again.
Sherlock exhaled next to him and shifted uncomfortably. And then it dawned upon John: Sherlock must have known the drug dealers from past experiences, past drug abuse. But that couldn’t have been a very long time ago, otherwise he wouldn’t have mentioned Sherlock the way he did. So surely, that must mean…
“It’s lovely to sleep next to someone, John. I never knew.”
They fall silent and Sherlock breathes in the other man’s scent. It is earthen, a bit like soil and sweet around the edges but still very much like the air before a storm. He exhales in a sigh and tugs at John’s shoulder, lets the palm of his hand glide over frayed cotton. He remembers how he’s wanted to press his face into the space between John’s jaw and neck and how it would be taking liberties. He does it now and closes his arms around John’s compact form. Brushes a kiss onto his forehead. With John beside him, emptiness goes wherever it comes from, gets lost in the darkness while Sherlock gets lost in the press of warm skin through cotton fabric.
Molly tilts her head in wonder and out of the corner of his eyes he sees John stand straight at attention, his defensive posture a noticeable sign of how much mayhem he expects every time Mycroft involves himself into their lives. As if he wants to be suitably ready at any time to step into the breach between the brothers and keep them from the worst. As if Mycroft is to walk in here any moment, umbrella swinging from his wrist and quipping at Sherlock until he loses patience and snaps. Frankly, it’s deeply pleasing and the way John’s eyes glisten in the face of potential danger is downright captivating. But only until Sherlock remembers the last time John’s eyes have glistened that way and what Lestrade has actually interrupted. He feels a pang of infuriating regret at the terrible timing that only helps to fan his rage.
“How long did it
Okay, to be perfectly honest: It always feels best when they are together and he’s sure John would employ the same opinion when asked. They’ve been good, all these years. They offered each other what was appropriate and needed. And it had always been enough. Yet, they’ve always been more than the label ‘best friends’ could ever define them, considering the fact that they live together, work cases together, sort of pool their money and spend most of their time together. But Sherlock has never paid much attention to what exactly it was they had, what their association was, the way they are around each other, and what it could potentially imply to the world.
“What you are? Seriously, Dr. Watson, if you don’t know--“
“Or taken for granted, that is.”
“Has the wife reported anything out of the ordinary in this room? Any missing objects, moved furniture or similar things?”
John has sent him occasional texts that made Sherlock buzz with excitement and energy and even though it had only been trivia John had shared with him, he’s triggered Sherlock into a very lucid day dream during a cab ride home to change his shirt.
“I got to go.”
“No,” he said and was a little surprised at how strained his voice sounded. And how deep his anger and hurt actually went.
“I could say quite the same.”
Sherlock‘s whole intellect is narrowed down to the way John hums his name. He wants to reciprocate and get lost in those warm and compassionate arms, press his face behind John’s ear and just breathe. He couldn’t care less about the fact that they are both muddied and soiled and smell of two days’ worth unchanged clothes. There are more pressing matters on his mind.
But then Sherlock's phone beeped and his attention instantly snapped elsewhere, leaving John at a loss, feeling feverish and in need of a good swig of his rum tea.
“I am not hungry, John.”
John cups his hands around Sherlock’s face and brings their foreheads together. He’s breathing heavily. “It was more of a process, Sherlock, I don’t know when exactly it started, maybe quite early, right when we met, maybe a bit later but at first I didn’t know what to do with it and how to think about it. But— “ He huffs a breath of laugh Lestade in the kitchen just
“What?” John says, eyebrows shooting up when the penny drops and the conclusion strikes home. “You dress up for Mycroft?”
His hands slid into Sherlock’s hair at the nape of his neck. Their noses brushed and Sherlock stalled a few centimetres above him as if to let John have the final say. But John didn’t hesitate. He strained his calves and pushed up to bring their mouths together and Sherlock answered readily, a low growl in his chest that made John’s arms vibrate where they touched Sherlock.
His voice took on a sudden soft tone.
But when Lestrade took a second chair from the little table in front of the window, the atmosphere turned all business. The D.I. sat on the other side of John’s bed, and after much assuring on John’s part that he was fine, Lestrade told them that the third man had escaped.
,” Sherlock inquires lamely but the feeling that he might be missing something about their conversation returns with full force.
John shrugs, face closed. “Delivery man from UPS, arrived in the appropriate vehicle, tall, blond, in a hurry. I had to sign for it.”
Sherlock’s voice is rough and his heart clenches painfully in his chest. It irritates him thoroughly that he just cannot catalogue his feelings and act accordingly. It’s like he’s lacking something or the idea of something… He only sees John and is properly aware he’s the revolving center as well as the reason to his own state of confusion and all Sherlock wants to do is sidestep it all and bury his face into the hollow between John’s shoulder blades, close his eyes and—
He knows he’s a late bloomer and has never really expected anything from interpersonal relationships. His past ventures into that particular territory have let him to believe he’d be totally alright without. But as he closes his eyes to listen to his own heart where it beats steadily beneath their combined hands, it comes to him that his university experiments may have set just the wrong example. They may have broken and ruined more than the scientific categorizing and research had been worth.
“Well, since we are being frank about it anyway, you didn’t rule out love as a leading factor, Sherlock. It sounds like you by any chance haven’t ruled out the possibility of getting involved yourself… at some point in your life.”
is… a shiver creeps down Sherlock’s spine and it proves to be quite a feat not to jolt with it.
“Just don’t, we’d all be happier,” Sherlock says sharply, cutting her off, and hurries into his coat. “Keep the carcass fresh and the spleen in, I’ll be back tonight.” He doesn’t turn around again to catch Molly’s retort and strides out of the morgue and into a cab.
Sherlock cleared his throat and his face looked very determined all of a sudden. He looked as if he was making a decision and when he finally reached it, his eyes turned very soft. He took another step towards John.
They exchanged glances and John took the phone off Sherlock’s hand and hit the take-button.
________________________________________
, Sherlock has never paid so much attention to John’s respective body parts before but now that John has favored him with those unusual and enticing glances, these thoughts come unbidden and Sherlock needs to make do with every clue he can deduce from John’s body language to solve the mystery.
Ever since John moved back into 221B Baker Street a few weeks ago after Sherlock had resurfaced from the dead, (returning to the only place John had ever called home in his head had seemed the logical thing to do) there had been a certain tension between them. They had thoroughly lost their equilibrium. John noticed time and again how hard it was to get back to their old life style after two years of him trying to move on. And failing gloriously. It had nearly shattered him to watch Sherlock step off a roof to his “death” after Moriarty’s dreadful campaign to destroy his reputation and make everyone believe Sherlock was a fraud. A thing John had never believed, not even when Sherlock told him it was true. Which it wasn’t. He didn’t know why Sherlock had told him that.
Soon John is draped sideways in his lap – smudged torso, dingy hair and damp jeans and all, legs lolling over one armrest - and Sherlock clumsily grips the shirt fabric at his waists because he doesn’t know what else to do with his hands. Lips seal themselves in a chaste yet deeply confounding kiss that, even though it is more of a simple press of skin on skin, instantly requires a proper reassessment of everything Sherlock has ever thought about carnal and emotional exchange before.
But the way John had held him. And had let go only reluctantly…
He hears John moan softly and when they shift their mouths, a dry little patch of skin on John’s lips clings to Sherlock front teeth. The intimacy of it nearly frightens Sherlock and makes his heart beat frantically in his chest and against John’s. John notices. He takes over and uses his tongue to dab Sherlock’s lips, thus making their kiss and their movements against each other a tad smoother, a tad more passionate. At this point it finally gets messy.
Sherlock is out of his depth but John simply  turns, lifts a hand and puts it on his cheek, thumb caressing the soft parts around his cheekbones and Sherlock feels like a wounded rabbit that needs to be soothed - a fact that he‘d hate under different circumstances but if it gets John to provide answers...
Being the good doctor John didn’t chide him when he cleaned the wound and checked if it had to be stitched. Deciding that he didn’t need to go to these extents he put iodine ointment onto a patch of cotton wool and dabbed at it. Sherlock winced but then kept his gaze fixed on the John’s jaw in silence. When John had put a band aid over his wound he leaned back with sight, while John put his medical kit away.
Before this evening, that is.
“Are you okay, Sherlock?” he inquired, finding it odd how Sherlock didn’t move away from the window. But the other man nodded twice, his eyes a wide pool of greyish green.
Sherlock turns around, his face smug. “Oh, clever” he says and a gloating sparkle comes into his eyes. “Well, but not clever enough.” Rushing a few steps to the stairway he further connects facts. “John, get dressed, we need to dash. You stay here, Giles. Help yourself to toast from the cupboard. I’ll be two minutes.” He pulls at his shirt, absent-mindedly touching a hand to the stretch of skin John’s hand had rested on through the last 3 hours and leaves a mystified D.I. behind him in the kitchen.
He cupped John’s face and his hand was trembling badly. A rush of embarrassment surged through John when he realized he’d gotten completely carried away. If this really was all new to Sherlock, and John was far to embarrassed to even try and suss it out, or worse, ask him, he had to grant him a moment to psych himself up. And then carry on, slow.
„There really wasn't the slightest chance of you spending your night somewhere else? I still have an experiment going on."
On sharp contrast, John devotes himself to the task of snogging Sherlock senseless, just for the sake of snogging him senseless; with utter enthusiasm. He’s kissing him like he tastes a rare delicacy, fully, with detail and reverence for the outstanding. One capable hand has come down from Sherlock’s shoulder to rest at the crest of his hips, while the other still holds his right hand in a loose grasp. Presently, John shifts those hands to his own neck and Sherlock is pleased to notice his scarf has come askew, enabling him to touch warm curves of strong neck and caress one earlobe with just the tips of his fingers. Underneath, John’s pulse is fast and throbbing.
“Don’t you want your heart?” John enquires and raises a playful eyebrow. He has already unwrapped one of the small chocolate hearts and is gingerly popping it into his mouth. Sherlock stares at the pink tip of his tongue where it touches the chocolate and considers because, yes, his sweet-tooth demands him to have at it but, as it is, he feels already nearly uncomfortably full.
Listlessly browsing the menu card a very attentive waitress has put in front of him, Sherlock tries to deduce John without being too conspicuous about it, but the doctor’s otherwise expressible face is forcibly blank. The table they sit at is very nicely adorned with, thankfully, not too much Valentine embellishment; only a napkin with small hearts that could pass of as dots and a tiny plate with two pieces of heart shaped chocolate. There is a candle, though, and John’s silver-blond hair shines like molten gold in the soft illumination. They are sitting vis-à-vis in a lovely corner next to the window and Sherlock is careful to not bump his knees against John’s under the table.
Their eyes met. Sherlock’s eyes were a green sea, his face pale in the darkness. Their hands brushed when Sherlock walked past him, sending John’s skin tingling again. Somehow, the touch of Sherlock’s skin was the one thing that felt the most real in their situation. John’s throat felt very parched all of a sudden.
“Shall we meet for lunch?”
Sherlock growled.
Sherlock’s smile widens and he reaches out a hand to cart it through John’s hair. It’s quite a feat to not immediately jump out of bed and tear down the stairs to Speedy’s to finally get his hands on the present John had intended to woo him with. Sherlock bites his tongue the next second because ‘wooing’ is just such a pedestrian term, but he just cannot help how his cheeks hurt from smiling and his heart lurches hard in his chest. John certainly
It is really a bit embarrassing, Sherlock muses, as he feels John’s breathing even out and give way into sleep. He has obviously employed the wrong parameters. Has started from the wrong point of expectations. He has turned the conundrum of John’s secret glances over and over in the cerebral gyri of his brain, has chased it in the hallways and rooms of his mind palace. Has looked at it on a moonlit cliff in a lucid dream. Only to get the first notion of its deeper meaning and what to perceive in his chair during a dreadful case and have John solve it entirely in his arms.
you.”
, John,” he says, the long-suffering sigh and eye-roll heavily implied. His voice has turned into a deep rumble because that particular timbre appeals to John’s danger-seeking nature and instantly alerts him to a near absolute focus. Stalling, Sherlock slides down from his stool, which brings him into closer proximity to John, and he’s secretly chuffed when John doesn’t step back but instead straightens as well to align their faces. They stare at each other and this close to John Sherlock can perceive his familiar scent under the cologne, a heady mixture of tea, soap and fresh cucumber. Can see the tiny gold flecks in his eyes shine brightly. He tilts his head a bit, which, as if by design, makes John’s tongue come forward to dab his lips and Sherlock is thoroughly discombobulated.
John’s voice is gentle and he seems chuffed when he shifts a generous amount of beans in tomato sauce onto Sherlock’s plate, along with two soft-boiled eggs, bacon and the inevitable toast.
And, yes, he loves Thai.
"To social kit and good humour with friends.", Lestrade said after shaking his head and pinching the bridge of his nose. He clinked his glass to John’s, looking him full in the eyes, then turned to Sherlock with a questioning look.
Nothing in both his real and imaginary space had prepared him for the sheer amazement of having Sherlock Holmes laid out under him on the sofa. They had resumed kissing after that very untimely phone call and John had been a bit unsure about how to proceed. He’d taken Sherlock in his arms, and cursing their height difference under his breath, had buried his hands in Sherlock’s dark and satin curls. He had found an intensely vast amount of pleasure in letting his fingers glide through his soft hair, straighten out single curls and see them snap back into shape. Kissing proved to be quite a sensation as well now that he knew Sherlock really wanted to and there was actually time for delving headfirst into it.
All this time ago right when he met John he built him a room to store everything worth keeping.
“Thank you. Show me the other arm”, John said and his voice came out somewhat dry. Sherlock fumbled with the buttons on his right sleeve but after a moment John reached out to help him.
“I just…”
The sitting room proved to be clean of drugs, supplies and likely material and John also made sure there was nothing amiss in the bathroom. He had checked all of Sherlock’s secret little hiding places, behind books, in cupboards, behind that loose tile above the bathroom mirror. The kitchen seemed okay, too, but John was very aware of the fact that, if Sherlock really wanted to hide anything from him, he would without a doubt succeed. The time was ticking by and John, instead of growing calmer when his search didn’t turn up anything, grew increasingly restless. He dreaded having to go into Sherlock’s bedroom and only end up being thoroughly disappointed if he did dig up evidence. He knew how Sherlock, having had the whole day alone in their flat, had had enough time to get rid of compromising evidence. John just had the feeling he needed to make absolutely sure the flat was clean.
They really needed to talk.
And then there was the fact that Sherlock, for whatever reasons, refused to talk about what happened in the two years he was gone. And why these two years had happened in the first place. Moriarty was dead, he’d seen his body in the morgue, so there was no threat to be expected, wasn’t there? John had already tried so many different approaches to get Sherlock to talk about what had happened between him and Moriarty on the roof that day but the other man had turned him down every time. And with every approach John attempted the thing, whatever it was, grew bigger and took on a nastier shape in his head. He was getting increasingly desperate about it and wondered if, after their latest row, he’d get an answer at all.
“I don’t believe you, Sherlock, I just… don’t…”
It is not only that, though. The way John glances at him also has another quality. It is neither deductive nor calculating, John doesn’t cast a verdict. He only looks at him in a way Sherlock has never noticed before and that makes him feel somehow vulnerable and awkward.
(See the end of the chapter for
The veins on Sherlock’s right arms also proofed to be unscathed but John nevertheless let his fingertips circle upwards to the nicotine patch Sherlock had stuck to his skin. There were remains of glue from its predecessors and John touched these as well. His eyes remained fixed on Sherlock’s exposed arms and he felt very calm all of a sudden. Sherlock’s gaze was upon him but John didn’t let go.
John’s current jumper gives Sherlock pause as deductions click into shape. He counts two and to two together.
Sherlock huffs and, despite the delay, feels a rush of fond affection towards the doctor. John is adorably captivating when he’s protective but Sherlock has a mystery to solve now
The case gets very dark as the homeless network provides Sherlock with the necessary information as to where the two victims have vanished and that they had, in fact, positively been abducted. Sherlock is buzzing with energy and determination and finds it surprisingly easy to focus again now he isn’t working alone anymore. He is somewhat sorry he cannot keep his promise to give the mystery John represents his undivided attention but the case offers him a well-established ground to feel save and self-confident again.
“Don’t ever say that again. Ever! I absolutely love you, you know that? But I swear to you I will strangle you if you ever do--“
Kisa, my dear, thank you for being such a wonderful beta-reader.
“But I think we can agree that my brother is headstrong and intransigent but you’re the one he trusts. If it doesn’t greatly interfere with your plans, do you think you could consider… watching him a bit longer?”
Hell, if it had been anyone else John would have got down to business without a second thought, undressing the other and dragging them off to bed. But with Sherlock it felt different, sacred, as if the normal conditions, the normal parameters couldn’t be applied here. And Sherlock himself hadn’t done anything to change their situation so far, to let it tumble into perfectly new territory. He’d only kissed John, hands gripping his arms and shoulders, fingers raking through John’s hair, and had whispered his name again and again.
It seems that John only glances at him when they are not in direct contact and when it is safe to look without being caught out.
“Just because it’s you, Gideon, I will forgive your drunken state,” he said and put it to his lips. But Lestrade stopped him, wide-eyed.
Sherlock is at a loss. But it was definitely secret, sacred, as if it meant something to John he doesn’t want anyone else to see, probably least of all Sherlock. Each glance was a very private moment and Sherlock still feels like he has invaded the other man’s private space - blundered into it. Sherlock has been waiting for John to glance at him again to collect more data but so far it hasn’t happened. Which is unsettling in itself. Sherlock wonders what three absent days mean in the great scheme of things and if there actually is one to begin with. It is quite an interesting challenge.
They eat in amicable if a bit suspenseful silence, both clad into pajama bottoms and flimsy t-shirts because the night is warm and humid after the rain. After John had made him a second sandwich, which he only eats the filling of while John eats the rest, Sherlock cants his hips to let them rest sideways against the counter, facing John.
“Did you take on the case because you knew the dealer?”
John’s voice caught on the last words but the moment he finished he was feeling relieved. He’d made a final approach, no questions like he’d promised in his texting earlier, just statements, and it had felt okay. He wasn’t expecting an answer so he didn’t look at Sherlock but then he heard the other man inhale.
John lets his hands stroke over Sherlock’s sides and clears his throat. “I want to keep doing this, Sherlock.” He pauses. “I— want you, everything with you. Let me—” They lock eyes and the skin at Sherlock’s neck prickles wonderfully. “Yes,” he agrees, talking over John in his rush to acquiesce and feels his legs go a bit wobbly. John holds him tight. “Yes,” he repeats, chest heaving breathlessly, and thinks how he might like this kind of repetition in the future, when it proves to be so very non-boring and makes John press his warm cheek to his.
aside, if Sherlock has needed any more data to deduce the atrocity of John’s obviously renewed dating habits, he’s been served quite an armful.
He perfectly well understands the concept of romanticism, at least on a theoretical basis and has always brushed it off as tedious and pathetic. Last night, however, for the first time in his entire life, he’d felt a certain pull towards another human being and he’s convinced how the atmosphere was not at all detrimental for that purpose. There was a moment when he had really wanted to brush John’s hand or be even bolder and take it in his. He had reached out and grabbed his glass of wine instead.
Out of the corner of his eyes Sherlock sees John’s eyebrows first shoot up only to switch into a deep frown halfway. “It’s flowers,” he says, unhelpful. “Who’s sending you flowers?”
The concept is not dissimilar to love, Sherlock assumes, but for Sherlock that particular sentiment had led into the dark. So his own experiences aren’t exactly the book you take a leaf out of.
“Duly noted.”
Secrets that debauchery would never conceal.
Sherlock’s heart rate is instantly skyrocketing.

The touch of tongues is like fireworks.
They silently left the office, their hearts beating fast, and ran to the door they had come through an hour ago. John caught Sherlock’s gaze again and Sherlock nodded, giving his elbow a tight squeeze in return. They could do this.
“You said you’ve wanted this… And I want it, too, I want everything,” Sherlock whispered and lifted his hands to cup John’s face.
John suddenly has his arms around him and puts one hand onto his neck to slowly bend his head down. Their foreheads touch and John chuckles. He looks tired but his eyes still twinkle. “I wasn’t asking because I wanted a full chemical record and half a sociological study about love through the age of mankind, you know.” He chuckles again but the sound gets muffled by his lips nuzzling around Sherlock’s jaw bone. “I just wanted to know if I stand a chance with you in the greater scheme of things but I guess you’ve already answered that.” He smiles and Sherlock knows that he’d given the game away the second the words ‘romantic inclination’ and ‘affairs of the heart’ tumbled over his lips.
“What would you like to know?”
“The food was heavenly,” John states with a relaxed smile and Sherlock, from the bottom of his heart, can only agree. He turns and makes for leaving when John stops him.
Sherlock swallows, thoroughly distracted – and has a moment of clarity.
it is that John wants.
After he’s finished off the last scraps from their plates, Sherlock leans back in his chair and lets his gaze pan out and roam the room. Letting it repeatedly brush over John where he reclines in his chair, hands relaxed on the table between them, Sherlock puts his leg tentatively to brush John’s and considers his situation. John hasn’t checked his phone again, which can only mean that he’s given up on his original dating plans. Yes, Sherlock may still not know why John decided to ignore or forgo the awkward atmosphere around them and have dinner with him. Whether Sherlock is actually nothing more than a stopgap or
John steals another glance at him again on Wednesday afternoon in the tube and this time Sherlock very nearly misses it altogether at first because he’s scowling at his own reflection in the windows of the doors in a rather packed compartment. God, he hates taking the tube but there is a football game at the stadium and it has proved to be impossible to get a free cap in the closer surrounding. It’s not that he hasn’t tried.
But that may also just align with John’s behavior towards him in particular. John has a caring nature and is way more perceptive than he’s given credit for. Sometimes unintentionally so. Nevertheless, being a former soldier John is a born protector, loyal, a born carer – he’s the one who buys the milk. And since John has been discharged from the army it has always felt that the substitute he’s needed to make up for its loss he has found in Sherlock.
Sherlock hums in complacency and turns the question over in his head to look at it from a different angle. John flashes him a glance and his thoughts stumble. If Sherlock wasn’t so flustered and secretly chuffed about John’s attention he’d definitely be annoyed with himself.
“You’re not leaving me again,” he said, shaking his head violently.
“Oh,” Sherlock scoffs in a sudden rush of impatience; the breach of his personal space, or rather the distraction it poses and how much Sherlock generally always revels in John’s touches and attention only enraging him further now. “Pray tell, what is? Wining and dining and a nice stroll in the park afterwards? Holding hands and…” He stutters a bit and hides it in a scoff. “…kisses in the dark? Please don’t be
“Why don’t you sleep, John?” Sherlock whispers but it's only pretend as he doesn’t allow time enough for John to answer when his head dips, closes the distance between them and their lips meet.
“I am--,” Sherlock began, but John, remembering where exactly they were, cut him short.
Sherlock kept on muttering about eyeballs, tapping manically on the keyboard of his laptop, while John tried to ignore him. When his cup was empty, he put on his jacket and left the flat. He didn’t notice how Sherlock’s eyes followed him to the door.
Sherlock picks at his lower lip because so far, he surmises, he’s lived in the Ivory Tower. If there would ever be a
“And if they did I wouldn’t care because they’re all dull.”
But there aren’t. The stench reverberating around the corpse, drenching the stale air in the tunnel is enough to worsen the whole situation.
Sherlock tears away his gaze and lets it roam over the trees and pathways around them, while he tries to collect himself for the ensuing manipulation. Hands hanging at his side, he aims for a casual stance but probably misses by a mile. It is quite dark around them, though, and John is less observant when he’s emotional, so the chances are high that the deception goes undetected.
a romantic,” he simply declares, and swallowing around his awkwardness, leans forward and kisses John.
Now, as he dressed in comfy sweatpants again (he’d been wearing nothing but comfy stuff the past days, he was going to miss that, even though he certainly wouldn’t miss the useless amount of time on his hands that just made his thoughts circle around Sherlock and their unsolved tension that came along with it) it was becoming increasingly hard to defy the urge to text him again.
“You wanted to check, didn’t you?”
, and let the waves crash over him. Let himself be sucked under water only to be washed back ashore, breathless and shaking. And John had shaken him thoroughly, both with his revelations in the park and his hands, skin and mouth in his bed. He’d lost his awkwardness when John’s strong body had pressed him into the mattress and his mouth had whispered glorious praise and endearments into his ears that had thoroughly taken hold in his mind and Sherlock truly cannot say when exactly they’d finally fallen into a sated slumber, strung out and deeply pleased within the soft and warm presence of each other.
“But you don’t do this, you don’t do-- this.”
John lifted his head and saw Sherlock look at him, an incredible intensity going on behind his eyes and suddenly John had to laugh, all the tension falling off of him and he kissed Sherlock flat on the mouth, his breath hitching in his throat.
“I can tell. But I cannot have you have me like that. Come here.”
“Tell me when you’re not comfortable.”
Mycroft chuckled but schooled it away quickly.
“It’s not important where I’ve been, what you need to understand is--”
. See it and either embrace it with both arms and never let go or huff and turn the other way. No matter the outcome, it would certainly render all this tedious talking irrelevant.
“John…”
“I knew you would go looking for evidence and I won’t hide it from you that I thought about throwing it all to the wind and get a fix. That’s how I came into contact with these dealers. But then I decided against it. And left the box so you wouldn’t worry too much.”
, and sad it is, it unfortunately cannot be helped.
“Ready?”
“Good morning,” John rumbles and his voice is so raspy and deliciously deep that Sherlock feels its vibrations weave through his body where it touches John’s.
John Watson? Sherlock would
“Are you staying in tonight? We could order Thai or curry,” he asks as John shifts to reach an own mug of tea that’s been left to cool beside him. He must have fixed a mug for himself and then, afterwards, another one for Sherlock.
They have talked about Sherlock’s fall and both of them are on the clear that pointing fingers is futile, but Sherlock knows he had hurt John, deeply. It has taken them quite some time to find their equilibrium, to diffuse John’s anger and settle back in together, so Sherlock had reigned in his feelings, the buzz in his guts, which had grown and flourished in his neglect before his fall. It had served him well as a motivator, though, something to hold on tight to during his time away.
Greg scratches his neck, sheepishly. “What about exposure to poison? Skin contact, oral taking, anything you can give me?”
“I can tell,” John answered, laughter lurking behind his eyes.
John has changed it all when he went and started to glance at Sherlock less than two weeks ago.
He didn’t know how it happened but one moment he was standing there in the middle of their sitting room with Sherlock’s honest and yet so incredibly vulnerable eyes on his face and his confession in his ears. And the next he’d closed the distance between them and leaned his forehead onto Sherlock’s collarbone, his own hand still in Sherlock’s. His heart was pounding like it was trying to grow wings and fly away.
John closed his eyes and tried to push his thoughts away. He would have to deal with them later, once they escaped. If they escaped. Looking at Sherlock just made him so angry… and so afraid at the same time.
When he couldn’t put it off any longer John opened the door to Sherlock’s bedroom. He had been into this room only a couple of times before. It had always, somehow, seemed to him that at least he was to take responsibility and respect social issues like private space. John felt unsure of himself when he started to pull out drawers and open cabin doors. He had to fight the urge to stroke his fingers over Sherlock’s button down shirts when he opened his clothes cabinet. He knew all of these shirts and not just because he was usually the one taking them to the laundry shop.
Sherlock finally stirred and woke, nuzzling his nose into John’s shoulder.
The music stopped when he crossed the sitting room to get to the stairs leading to his room. Turning around he saw Sherlock watching him, the violin loosely hanging in his delicate hands.
“Your head looks okay. It will heal quickly and cleanly, no concussion. We didn’t even have to stitch you up. You might feel a bit queasy. Shall I fetch you something to settle your stomach?”
