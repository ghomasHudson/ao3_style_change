“Ok, now that Cas is alive again I should probably introduce myself.” Chuck said calmly. “I’m God, but you can call me Chuck.”
Dean slammed on the breaks and almost skidded off the side of the road. “Jesus Cas, How many times do I gotta tell you. DONT DO THAT!”
“My one true pairing. See no matter how many worlds I make, how many times I put you in different situations you guys always end up together.” They were still speechless. “Ok, it all started about 2 billion years ago, on Earth 1. Cas was an angel and Dean you were a human. You don't want or need any details, but you two fell in love and were trying to live happily. Unfortunately, some other angels were jealous of you and murdered both of you.” They had horrified looks on their faces. “Don't worry you got rid of those guys and I brought you back to life.”
“Andy,” she sighed, “Noby even knows if vampires are even real, how would people know how to turn into one. Wouldn’t it be cool to be a vampire?”
A minute later her husband Andy was leaning over her shoulder looking at the computer. “Oh cool, what is it?”
He doesn’t remember the rest of the phone call. He jumped in the car, ignoring shouts from his boss about leaving early, and sped to the hospital. He barely remembers rushing in and asking the secretary where he could find Cas. When he entered the hospital room, he found the love of his life laying in the bed with a tube down his throat. The Doctor in the room explained that Cas had been in a car accident. A drunk driver smashed directly into his car and put him in a coma And that’s probably where he would stay. There was nothing they could do.
“I’m bringing him butter because that’s his favorite food, and he’s not my boyfriend, he’s my husband.”
“Who the hell are you?” Dean asked the stranger. He was grateful to this man for bringing back the love of his life but how did he do it? Maybe he was an angel. Dean never thought they were real before but he knew Cas did.
Claire and Jack wandered into the room. Claire was just as shocked as Mary when she saw her father. She ran over and joined the hug. Jack however was less surprised, “HA! I told you I would see him later.” He said to his family.
“It is,” Dean said without thinking. He and Cas had been married for 14 years; he never thought twice about referring to Cas as his husband.
“Oh my god, here,” April says as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a vile with red liquid inside. She handed it to Dean hod pocketed it.
“So you’ve said Amara but you and Dean’s ‘special bond’ would never compare to Dean and Cas’s profound bond. Speaking of which, it's been 3 earth weeks since I checked on them last. Hand me the monitor.” one of the many angels in the room grabbed the earth monitor and placed it in Chuck’s hand. He began swiping through the different versions of earth. “Good, good, good, wait, what the fuck is going on on earth 455. CAS IS DEAD! Oh, fuck no. I spent too long creating the perfect universe for them. I gotta revive him before his soul crosses over,” he pointed at his sister. “Amara, can you stop the reaper?” he asked.
“This may sound strange,” Dean started, “But is there anyone here who might have purchased some vampire blood?”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said just as the monitor made one long continuous beep. Dean collapsed and sobbed on the edge of the bed. Mary ushered the kids out of the room and a nurse flipped off the monitor before also exiting. Dean was left alone crying in a hospital room next to his dead husband.
Castiel blinked for only a few moments before hurrying over to find Dean. He couldn't worry about what the other Dean meant, he had bigger things to worry about. “Dean!” He gasped as he opened the door and seeing Dean, his Dean throwing his face up.
“Top drawer, behind the gun cleaning oil, the white bag.” Dean instructed and smiled as Castiel reached to pull out the fabric bag. He looked over at Dean who just nodded and pointed at it with his eyes and though Castiel tilted his head a way that looked a lot like a curious little kitten, but he did open it, tilting the bag and allowing the items, two thick silver men’s rings fell into Castiel’s hands. “Dean?” Castiel asked and Dean hummed a bit and leaned over to kiss Castiel’s temple.
“Yeah, and even if he can, how dangerous will this be?” He asked and Gabriel stopped what he was going to say and instead turned to Dean raising a blonde eyebrow.
“Yes, helping people, knowing exactly what it is and hunting it before it can kill or harm anyone else.” Castiel then smiled, “you don’t have to worry about any monster who might be too dangerous or one that we can’t stop them immediately. No fear of injuries, it being taken care immediately.” He smiled and grinned more as he saw that Dean was calming though he fought showing it, but it was all there in the slowly lowering shoulders, going down. Relaxed.
“Well welcome back nerds.” Dean chuckled putting the pie on the pot holder that Gabriel had laid down. “We made a pie. Apple.” Dean grinned as Sam's eyes widened.
“Vi gets to become a hunter?!” Jacob asked shocked, of the two Sam wouldn't be surprised if Jacob decided on that life. However with the shock of Violet maybe he wouldn't.
“Gabriel is my older brother. Shouldn't it be weird to hold me like this?” He asked and Dean sighed.
“A...a guinea pig?” He asked and Dean looked at the gray fur less rodent like he was looking at it for the firs time.
“Thanks guys, I made pumpkin pie last night, have at it,” Dean winked, he knew full well that was one of their favorites.
“Why do you think something is wrong?” He asked and whimpered when Gabriel's wings stopped beating and his grace stopped stroking along his chest, arms, shoulders, neck, face and hair in a languid pace. He hadn't realized how enjoyable it was, and how strong Gabriel's wings really were. He was supporting him, a full grown man, on his wings as if he weighed nothing so despite how soft and silky the golden feathers looked. They were far more substantial then they looked.
When the wedding day came neither Sam nor Dean wore a dress. Castiel and Gabriel didn't either. Their wedding day ended up on June 21st, the heat of a Kansas summer was no joke so they all dressed in white. White tuxedos and color coded with each of them taking a different color to be their handkerchief and ties. Dean and Sam wore the color of their angels' grace and for Castiel and Gabriel they wore the color of their humans' soul.
“Run as much as you want, little rabbit, you won’t escape.” Castiel glared keeping his arms on Dean, “you can run yourself ragged and then I’ll take you home so you can rest.”
“That's a crap-shoot.” Sam whispered watching how his older brother visibly softened, he knew his brother would never say it, but some part of Dean wished to be a father, to work with kids. He had a magical touch when it came to kids, one that Sam could admit he was a bit jealous of. He loved children but it wasn't something that he could do like Dean or Gabriel could.
Sam's eyes widened as he watched this happen in the rear view mirror driving back and he wondered if he would have to put up with this then entire week or two. So he'd have to deal with even more stated sexual tension. Glancing back up after a while he saw they both were asleep, Castiel fast asleep and Dean was blinking his eyes sleepily but would be asleep in a few minutes.
Biting his lip, he looked away, kicking off his shoes and pulling off his leather jacket, putting it down gently before laying beside Dean. Even through the blankets that Dean was nestled under and Castiel was laying on top of was nothing to hamper the human’s heat. Castiel could do a lot of things right now, things that he did need to do, gather supplies that they needed; food, clothing and weapons, gather information about this universe beyond just where to find his Dean, put what he had already gathered away, get the Impala, he knew that Dean would never view their nest as home without the Impala that was the only place to be his home.
“Because it's not like with you and Gabe, I know you do to.” Dean shook his head, “you're good for him, maybe even too good. But Cas...Cas deserves so much better. Someone worth staying around for.”
“No that isn't it, but I thought that you were really going for that long haired one.” He pointed to the auburn one who turned her head over to look at their direction.
A vacation even is not something he had a lot of chances to have a vacation, and definitely not a honeymoon. It felt like it was going so fast, but he knew that Castiel still viewed him as himself, he didn't expect Dean to become an apple pie life, instead he would live as a hunter, in two worlds, with him.
“A airplane Cas! They are horrible, I'd rather fight a pissed off werewolf with no weapon than go into those fucking things.” Dean shook his head and Castiel couldn't help but smirk, the very common feeling of affection warming his heart.
“Sam, if you would mind not pulling Dean away from me.” Castiel started to say but jumped as Sam pulled out a gun shooting it, hitting Castiel’s shoulder.
Now was not the time to think of that now though. He tipped his head back and slowly breathed in deeply through his nose. Dirt, fresh turned soil and grass; he was in a field or the forest. Good. Sitting up he began slowly skimming his hands along the ground until his hands batted against his Book of Shadows and then his hat he stood on shaking legs and tugged his clothing to straighten them.
“We...we're visible again?” Castiel asked and realizing from the looks back to them that they could see them again was all it took for his eyesight to zero in on Dean, ignoring everything but his beloved hunter.
Still he walked by kittens that were mewling and bathing their litter-mates, birds tweeting sweetly, and he just couldn't stop smiling. He loved animals, loved them more then he would ever let anyone know. It was the black bunny that looked up at him with big blue eyes that he couldn't help but smile at. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and he couldn't keep the smile off his face.
He loved Dean's pies and had confessed they tasted much better than his wife's. They had laughed their asses off when she had bought one of their pies and the husband-Fred-had told them he knew it was theirs. That was before she found out they were-gasp-in gay relationships.
“Fine, it just surprised me to see Castiel's mark on you. Physically anyway.” Gabriel saw that the two humans were looking confused so continued on.  “His mark on you is on your soul, we angels can sense it, but I didn't realize it was on your body.” He explained and Dean reached up to touch the scar, he had never thought much about scars. He was always covered in them, of course when Castiel had pulled him from hell he had worked his way out of his coffin having now only the scar of Castiel's hand print.
“Yes, I'm so sorry I couldn't show you I was here sugar cube.” He held close to him and Sam frowned and Gabriel looked at him worried, thinking the hazel eyed hunter might be mad at him.
Dean could not believe it. How? How could that happen? Looking into Castiel's blue eyes (blue no more) just eerie white taking on his entire eyeball. Castiel smirked and looked around until his solitarily colored orbs fall on the trio again and smiled a beneficial smile.
“You ever heard 'too much of a good thing'?” Gabriel asked and then rubbed his temples, “I disagree with it, but for these things it is far too true. Someone with extraordinary psychic energy are like poison to them, if they would try to feed they'd be like chasing down rat poison with a antifreeze shot.
“Wait, what?” Dean pulled away from him, “I thought you were the one who killed him?” It had never been stated but over the week Scar Castiel had shown that he blamed himself for his Dean’s death.
“Dean's soul is the most beautiful I have ever seen.” Castiel said it matter of factly and Gabriel remained silent, he knew he and the younger angel would never come to agreement. He knew he was right.
Reaching out with his grace he made sure that Grace was fine before he slipped out of the room following his mate.
“Shut up Gabriel.” Castiel glared at the arch angel, “I want nothing that Dean doesn't, just like you wouldn't want anything Sam doesn't. Our wants are irrelevant when comparing to our bond mates.” That was all that needed to take the mischievous teasing wind right out of Gabriel's sails.
But right now all he wanted was...what he wanted was something he would never say out loud. Would never admit even to himself that he thought it. But he wanted to be held, Castiel had never had a problem invading Dean's personal space and staring into his eye much longer then would be considered normal, which Dean had always bared the brunt of between the Winchester brothers. But actual physical touching was few and far between, sure Castiel would often reach out to grip the hand print and Dean would touch his angel's shoulder. But not the slight brushing against each others sides, he was much freer with reaching out to touch his hunter and Dean didn't hold back from pulling his mate into a hug.
That was surprising but considering how close the Winchester brothers always were it didn’t surprise him that both had an angel as a mate. Dean the Righteous Man with his soul so bright his body could barely contain it was his, the rebellious seraph. It wasn’t surprising that Sam, who might be the favored child of demons and the true vessel of Lucifer, had ended up with the archangel Gabriel who in his own way was just as rebellious as Castiel.
“Yeah, and then Dean can get away from you.” The other version of himself said and when he turned the angel was glaring at him, Scar Castiel was about ready to destroy him but was stopped by Sam.
That Gabriel was not his Gabriel, not who he fell in love with, just like that Dean was not his brother and that Sam was not him. Maybe given different circumstances he would be but that wasn’t him.  This just made his determination stronger, he had to destroy not only the bastard angel from his own universe but every Castiel ever.
“How is it normally?” Sam asked curiously, being able to understand what had happened to him and how and why he could do it had always made him feel better. Like he could control it better.
Castiel smirked and it almost felt like he was giving himself his Dean and went on to the next universe.
“Gabe?” “Cas?” Both brothers asked at the same time the angels looked between them and they then looked back to their hunters.
When Dean woke up, he looked around finding him back in the room that Scar Cas had put him. Oh no. No, no, no-No! Dean jumped up and threw the covers off of himself and hurried looking around trying to find a way to find his way back again.
“Kill me.” Sam groaned looking down at his breakfast feeling a pit in his stomach and not wanting to eat anything. His appetite was shot.
“Don’t lie.” Dean reached out, grabbing the necklace that was sitting over Castiel’s loose tie and ripped it off of his neck. The ring clattered to the ground and Dean was gone along with his necklace. He left Castiel struck dumb staring at the space that once held his Dean.
“That’s the thing man; it’s you. A different you. From another dimension.” Dean explained and Castiel went stock still.
“Philly cheesesteak doesn't taste good anywhere outside of Philly.” Gabriel grinned, “which is why I bought this house.”
He was just starting to get things set up to wash off the flour, egg splatter and such from his hands and face-since the soft pillow-like white clouds of flour always managed to catch in his hair. Since he-and the others-were slowly getting gray hair it wasn't that noticeable but he could still feel it.
“I know but at least the one you do, or maybe even more, it will mean the world to them.” That was the thing to say as Dean relaxed and he looked around. There were so many to adopt but smiled as he looked at the one with no fur. It was a light gray and both while it would be someone that wouldn't shed on his leather jacket but also it seemed they probably had problems getting adopted.
“Okay, throw everything in the bowl.” Dean added putting the cinnamon in and Castiel answered with a 'okay' throwing in the little bit of nutmeg. “Now we toss it. Not like that!” He yelled as Castiel picked up the entire bowl about ready to throw it like a baseball. “Like a salad man!” He move Castiel in front of him, grabbing his wrists to show him how to toss the apple filling. His chest pressed tightly to Castiel's back.
Sam looked down and he hated to admit it but that did calm him some. The fact remained that Gabriel was extremely strong, without holy oil he wouldn't stand a chance against him. He learned while he still thought that Gabriel was Loki that the-who he then thought demigod-was unrealistically strong. He couldn't see Gabriel ever doing it but still he was relieved to hear it.
“Are you two crazy?! You could have been hurt and we couldn't feel you!” Gabriel pulled Sam to his chest holding him tightly, his wings wrapping tightly around his mate. “We were building, our energy...” he whispered and closing his eyes flew Sam to where he had. Castiel was back a few moments later.
“Hey Vi?” Sam whispered, “listen we old people have been practicing over three times longer than you've been alive.” Sam winked, “practice makes perfect, this is your first time.” He grinned when her watery eyes immediately dried.
“You’re not Cas.” He glared and Castiel looked down, he had hoped to avoid this but obviously this universe had its own copy of him.
“Not as ancient as I. And you take on that human form.” He laughed and glared at him and Castiel frowned, he might have changed this form a bit, allowing it to be his true form, every part of it was him, the form that his Dean had loved.
The top floor had five bedrooms, two master bedrooms that were facing the back of the house that had a balcony as well, one for each of the brothers, and three bedrooms which could hold anyone they wished to house, as they knew that they were so embroiled in the hunter lifestyle to never turn their back on it. They would be able to not do it so there would be somewhere for the boys to house any other hunters. There were also a guest bathroom for the possible guests and a master bath for both the boys rooms.
“Long furred ones require more attention since their fur has to be trimmed.” He explained and Dean reached foreword to grip his angel's shoulder.
“I…I” he looked down at his hands starting to shake and Dean frowned having never seen a panic attack before. He had never seen a panic attack before even if he had experienced them himself.
Dean grinned as he skewed a blade through the vampire, he knew that it wouldn’t die. Dean could easily have killed the vampire either by cutting off its head or using the First Blade instead, but Dean wasn’t going to let it go so easily. He was going to make this fucker suffer.
So I got to go into the lore a bit, as well as have all four interact. I liked writing this chapter.
Dean had run this trail before so knew exactly what way to do to get out, that was one thing he really knew, knew how to remember where he has been. He jumped as suddenly the air around him shifted and suddenly there was the scarred Castiel again.
“Well Tiramisu and Pixie, I think someone might be adopting at least one of your siblings.” She cooed turning and walking away.
“Why Dean?” Castiel asked with a heat Dean wasn't used to seeing from his angel. Sure Castiel could be a bad ass mother fucker, and sure those fiery eyes had glared at him from time to time he had turned it onto him but never without a reason. “Dean, you need to take care of yourself, practice some self-care!”
Castiel panted taking in deep breaths over and over shaking slightly, his eyes turning white and he began to go into the closest thing a god-as newly to the tier of god as he may be-could have to a panic attack. Growly he shot his hand out, punching right into the nearby mirror, smashing not only it but through the wood, concrete, and plaster of the wall, this house had been made with thick walls and the best of the offered materials of the day, it was a pretty new house. Despite how the majority of people of that socioeconomic tax bracket who took form over function, this home was made with the best of the best for function and then form to match.
It didn't matter that he and Cas were too different and could never be together; that Cas was an angel and Dean a mortal. That through Dean Castiel had been destroyed over and over again. That it would be better for the angel if he never ran into Dean. That Castiel could do so much better then him.
Sam meanwhile was holding back his laughter at the looks of disgust from Dean and Gabriel humming at his own salad sipping his tea as he and Castiel smirked at each other at the looks on their own mate's and brother's faces.
“The ritual is a...almost like a medical thing. You know how different people could react to something as simple as cough medicine by who they are? Like a pair of identical twins who have changed throughout their lives could easily have different reactions; one might not have any side effects and the other might be drowsy.” He tried to explain and Sam watched quietly but seemed to slowly get it, Gabriel forced himself to remain silent letting his hunter soak it all in.
“I'll be back.” Sam promised but Dean chuckled and threw his fist in the air and Sam groaned rolling his eyes he walked away. “What is it Gabe?” Sam asked with a smile, seeing Gabriel always broguht a smile to Sam's face. How could it not? Dean and him were very close, close in a way where only a hard childhood could forge, close over years. But with Gabriel it was vastly different, it was a different kind of happiness, a different feeling deep inside of him. When Sam looked at Dean it was how he thinks he would feel looking at a older brother, father and mother, calm and accepting love. With Gabriel it was a feeling of something crawling around in his torso but he liked it, he liked that combination of feeling a strange giddiness but at the same time feeling secure and comfortable in his presence.
Castiel could not help but feel that he was intruding on a private moment, something that had been rubbed off on him from Dean. He waited until the two pulled away and Gabriel cupped Sam’s face and whispered softly to his lover.
Dean shook as he finally stopped his flight. Not caring where he had landed as he looked at the necklace, holding it close to himself, as he pressed his lips to it, it was still warm, and he wondered if Castiel had done the same before shaking his head roughly.
“I can't believe my bond eats like a rabbit.” Gabriel teased and Sam glared at him rolling his eyes.
“You did not say it is what you wanted.” Castiel pointed out and tilted his head a slight bit before seeming to understand. “Do you think it is all you deserve?”
“Dean!” Sam whined and Dean ignored him but jumped as there suddenly was another person and was pushed out of the way. It was Gabriel and Dean frowned as suddenly Gabriel was gripping Sam and as he still looked angry he frowned.
For him to lie, to John Winchester of all people, when he was only fifteen years old. The shock of that was enough to snap him out of his full-on anger mode.
“So let me see if I’ve got this straight; we’re dealing with a Cas from another universe, one who didn’t go on a crazy god trip, who was in a relationship with that universe’s Dean; married or just bo-boyfriends, something romantic.” Sam waited for Dean’s nod, he didn’t mention the red that his older brother’s ears were going red and he was looking everywhere but their Castiel. Why wouldn’t he just admit his feelings already? It wasn’t like he was fooling anyone: Balthazar, Crowley, Meg; human, angel or demon all it took was seeing them interact for a few moments to know they were so in love. Sam always knew that he would never push someone to admit, or come out, they would do it when they were ready, but after hearing his brother go gaga over Dr. Sexy, check out the strong jaw lines of random guys and try to hide the light flirting he did with interesting looking men for well over a decade Sam was ready to pull his long hair out.
“Come on Sammy, I know that is a lie, you have to have somewhere to honeymoon in mind.” Gabriel cooed, “I've been all over the world in the millenniums I've been here, I don't think there is a single place I haven't been at least for a little bit, you can pick anywhere.”
Even the purgatory souls couldn’t change that, they just perverted it like everything else about him. It wasn’t just his love for Dean, his love for Sam and Bobby which was very different. Keep Sam’s wall down until he took on the ways of archangels, make him his right hand man, put Bobby in heaven with his late wife, to make a family for Dean to stay with when Castiel is called away, and Dean…
“Gabriel will not hurt Sam. He can not hurt Sam. No more then I could hurt you.” Castiel assured and Dean wanted to bring up so many things; like how Castiel had threatened to throw him back into the Pit, how Castiel had beat him. But he realized that it didn't matter. That really Castiel was always there for him, always trying to protect him.
Seeing Gabriel on the bed so broken and hurt, refusing grace from Castiel, refusing to even speak. For such a mischievous teasing person to not talk...if he wasn't so scared and worried he'd be...he didn't even know but some new feeling wrapped around his heart and squeezed it mercilessly when he thought of that dark time. But the relief and happiness when he finally spoke after begging him. In truth Sam couldn't remember what he had said to him to get him to talk but he was so thankful to it. And when he sacrificed himself to give Dean and Sam a chance to run, he was now gone forever, even god thought that he was truly dead.
I hope you guys enjoyed this and it made sense, I think that Dean and Sam could easily navigate a forest even if they were weapon and tools-less. I’m figuring right now the story is maybe half done, but maybe it will be a few more chapters than I think it will be.
Dean hummed his green eyes fluttering open, and he could see black feathers behind Castiel but was too far to wonder at it, as the mass moved towards him, moving around him as if to shield him and floofing slightly like that one nature documentary that Sam had watched for ten months straight when he became obsessed with them when he was twelve, that birds would sometimes dot hat to impress a possible mate.
“Last I talked to them they were talking about moving, they don't want to raise a family in Texas. Want a fresh start. If not I have others, they just popped in my mind first.” Gabriel assured and Dean frowned.
But seeing the way Gabriel reacted to his baby brother he took a critical eye to the interactions between his angel and himself. And damn Gabriel for making him be self-conscious about it. He noticed how close Castiel stood to him, how if he was stressed the black wings would be lightly stroking his head, and when he was near anything his angel considered dangerous one wing would wrap around him, if this was happening he could see why the angels and demons would say they were boyfriends. And why would he even think that?
“Yeah, these things aren't demons but close enough. I call them psychic vampires, regular vampires feed on blood but these things feed on psychic energy.” He explained and sighed stopping and looking towards the darkness that withered, much darker then it should be on such a bright and sunny day. Cave or no.
He knew the story, of course as he and Sam talked about any and everything. And he knew all about how Dean used to bake, how he loved it. And about how scared Sam was when he was going to go to school for the first time so Dean, at the time only ten was able to use Pastor Jim's kitchen with his blessing to. Dean made Sam home made cinnamon rolls, not the stuff from the tube but flour and salt and baking soda and all that.
“Wow...” Sam whispered before looking away as the waiter brought them their desserts. For Gabriel a decadent chocolate cake of some kind Sam had never seen before, taking it as a British or even French dessert, while for Sam he chose a Strawberry Glory, something he never had before but was closest he could think was like a strawberry parfait but different to.
“It is possible that their Sam doesn’t have the ability to travel through different universes.” Castiel pointed out and that made sense, while Castiel could, even as an angel could travel through different universe; it would be difficult but not impossible. As a god, or godstiel as Dean had once called him, and as a knight of hell, though Dean had never gotten to really discover his powers fully but the other Dean who was not only a knight but a king of hell, he could easily jump through the universes.
“I don't know Sammy.” Dean looked down obviously feeling ashamed, normally that would have Sam worried and calm as Dean so rarely did but when he did...he was so much stronger. He could see, though he rarely thought of it as Dean was so much older then him and always seemed like an adult more then just an older brother to him. In a lot of ways Dean acted more like a father to him then his own dad had been. Seeing Dean as someone who needed his own help had never occurred to him, it had always been dad and Dean, he being on the outs. He never considered the idea that Dean was like that trying to take all the hunting that their father had wanted to spare Sam.
“So just touching a soul without a vessel is enough to marry someone?” Sam questioned then shook his head, “no, that's impossible; Gabe has never touched my soul.”
“I know man, I know,” Castiel had been hurt just as much. He was almost afraid to see what he would do to the other version of him. Sam was mad and had some choice words for the thing that took his brother, it was not Castiel as far as he was concerned, but still there was a certain amount that was similar between the two. He was a Castiel from another universe, but the question was what did he want?
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry my beloved, but we have each other once again, and this time I won’t lose you. I swear I won’t fail you again.” Castiel stroked the amulet and ring between his forefinger, middle finger, and thumb for a few moments more before tucking it back under his shirt where it would be safe slipped his helmet on. He tugged his gloves on a bit further up before getting back on the bike and riding it down the forest lined road towards the house. Once he smelt the water of the lake in the front of the home he relaxed fully, his shoulders going down several inches. Soon. Soon he’d be back in Dean’s presence and able to again really breathe.
“Right, of course you do.” Gabriel chuckled and smiled a bit, “well little brother pulled me to ask me for advice.”
I could see Dean and Gabe being best friends while Sam and Cas are as well. It is a great thing when you can approve of your siblings lover. I love fluffing everything. Destiel fluff, Sabriel fluff, Winchester bros brotherly fluff, angel bros brotherly fluff. Just all the fluff.
Dean didn't know what to say to that, and luckily Gabriel didn't seem to need an answer instead turning on the TV to pass the time as the pie cooked.
Which meant they were not taking any chances. They would take every precaution, and wouldn't go in guns blazing not knowing what was going on and what they were going after. But they couldn't just let more and more people die as they worried about what it was, so was the hope that Uncle Crowley would know, if not him than one of their parents would.
It looked the same from what he had remembered from the last time but still there was something that was off. Something that didn’t feel right. The temperature was…perfect. Not too warm and not too cold, like the weather decided that he would be doing enough work to get away from the scarred version of Castiel so why make it any harder for him by having the weather be hot or have a chill? His luck was never that good.
“I think I know what's going on.” Dean finally spoke up looking up at them but after looking into Sam's eyes for a little while he looked away which threw Sam off, that was something new.
“Dean, I love you.” Dean watched as he started to say his name his eyes were back to being blue and he could look into his angel’s eyes as he said that. Dean sighed and took Castiel’s hand and wrist in his hands and slowly pulled down revealing his mouth.
“Why would it make me uncomfortable?” Dean spoke, once again, without thinking and he inwardly groaned before glancing at Castiel from under his lashes to see Castiel without making it obvious he was looking at him. “Does it make you uncomfortable?”
“You are the most important, but helping people is deeply ingrained in you.” Castiel explained, “all the parts about being a hunter that you love, nothing you don’t.”
Dean blinked and looked at Castiel before getting a gentle look in his eyes and a soft smile. It took a moment for him to remember what was going on. “Wait, Sam were you just kissing him?!”
He had an angel to kill. Once he killed the one that took his brother away from him he would take the others as well. If his best friend, who loved Dean so well, could do this than any of them could do it. Not even the ones who were not an angel would be spared.
“I never killed Dean you know,” Gabriel whispered moving over to grip Sam's hand, “I couldn't bare to kill someone held so dear to you, plus he didn't do anything to deserve to die plus he was the kind of guy I could see as being a friend.” Gabriel added and Sam looked at him shocked and glared but there was no heat in it, he couldn't do that.
Dean was reasonably sure that the alternate version of Castiel was following him, but he was either invisible girl or hiding, but he always stayed far enough away that Dean couldn’t catch him. When he ate, they ate silently together and when he slept Castiel stayed at an armchair across from the room, but he was still there.
“You really think it was your dad? Sorry baby, but it was me. I couldn't let my sweetheart go.” He hummed, “though your dad has absolutely no problem with that. He 'ships' us.”
Sam turned as soon as he heard the scream of confusion that he knew to be his brother’s voice, rushing from the door he was at and to his brother’s voice. He ran from one end of the warehouse to the other, he didn’t know if his brother was screaming that loudly-a bad sign-or that it just how the sound traveled through the warehouse. He hoped that it was that one.
Castiel's sweet smile was enough that the discomfort of saying that was more then worth it. “Dean,” he whispered kindly leaning down to kiss Dean once again. They continued kissing, rubbing each others arms and chest, being held by arms and chests and wings until Dean finally slipped off to sleep in his mate's arms.
Okay this was long, like nearly, but not quiet, 5k words. I hope you guys like it. This is the au that was made by Sir Catherine. Mine is different backstory but I was inspired so every now and then will write on the Dark Cas AU. I suggest checking out her Tik Tok cosplays of him (same name for Twitter, Ao3 and Tik Tok), it is so good. She’s really good at the cosplays.
“Well you know, in Switzerland its illegal to own only one piggy.” Gabriel chuckled and Dean rolled his eyes.
“That smells good.” Dean and Gabriel turned, Dean was just getting the pie out of the oven and grinned at them.
“Where am I?” Castiel asked taking a step back and Death froze before watching him and then looking down at himself.
“What the fuck,” Dean groaned barely managing to stumble to the bed. He never in a million years thought he would be so exhausted from sitting down in a hotel room all day. Sam was already fast asleep not even having the energy to change into pajamas. Gabriel gave him a change of clothing with a snap of his fingers, setting the tall man down and tucking him in before disappearing to get some ice cream from the 'best ice cream in all of Florence'.
So to see a place he had always wanted to see but was filed under the 'I want to but I more then likely could never' dream he was awed.
“You killed my brother. You are fucking trash.” He growled out and Castiel frowned, this was too much. He kept Sam’s focus on him as he sent his grace out searching out for Dean, the other version of Sam and his other version but frowned as he saw that Dean and the others were long gone, easily thirty miles away now if not more. And for his husband, he had no idea where he was.
“I...I had a nightmare.” Dean whispered burying his face in the pillow as if he was embarrassed. “C-could I...” he didn't finish but he didn't need to, instead Castiel pull the blanket down off of him.
“Why do you care so much? What’s the catch?” Castiel asked and the demon looked at him for a few moments and frowned before shrugging.
“Dean really? How do you think I have several homes all over the place? I can easily get another property here to open up a bakery.” He chuckled before glancing over at Sam having his plotting look that Castiel instantly felt more then just a little worried about. He still remembered Gabriel's games from when he was a fledgling.
“Oh my mate, I’m not going to fuck you, I’m going to make love to you,” Castiel easily took control and Dean grinned, they could work through this, and it would be just one more thing they overcome.
Curious Castiel began looking through to find Dean Winchester, the last thing he had seen was a confirmed case of seeing Dean was a retired officer. Humming he began searching for her and smirked appearing into her home.
“Apple is your favorite isn't it?” He asked and grinned when Dean nodded. “Okay then, let's go.” He led Dean over to the kitchen and began pulling things out. The kitchen had white cabinets with black granite tops, a sleek silver refrigerator as well as a matching two place oven.
Gabriel glared at Castiel and Dean as the two did their whole 'stare deeply into each others eyes' thing. Normally he wouldn't care, honestly it was quiet funny with how much they both loved each other but wouldn't ever admit it. He might even want to help them out since Dean was such a great help with pranking that he would do it.
Castiel mumbled something, something that neither sibling understood as it was Enochain. It was a language that neither understood, they had heard either of the angels speaking in the language but only in times of extreme emotions. It was extremely rare but enough for either of the two to pick up that it was the language that the blue eyed angel had spoken.
“Huh, I always thought I was waiting for this to finally happen, but its kind of…I took care of Cassie as a fledgling.” Gabriel chuckled, “oh don’t give me that look Dean, watch.” Reaching up he grabbed Sam’s collar and pulled him down to give him a smacking kiss.
He rubbed the back of his head as Dean helped him up. Castiel was by their side as Dean started to try to make sure that Sam was okay. He grabbed Dean, his wings wrapping around both of them and flying them away to the hotel room.
“Cassie and I were cursed.” Gabriel answered not being able to help but smile as he felt Sam's arms on him tighten as if to protect him.
That name, when they decided on it, made Dean snigger. They were planning to call it East of Eden, Campbell's, Novak's, or even Winchester's where they could claim it was extended family. They went through a lot of names, but in the end they settled on The Angel's Nest.
“Sammy did always say he would make salads, so that it would cancel out the pie.” Dean smirked at the sound of Sam's groan.
“That sounds like a great idea.” Gabriel smiled brightly and Sam grinned back and they began looking around. In the end they found a three year old dog with yellow fur, he was just starting to get too old to be adopted but wasn't so old he couldn't take leaving the only home he ever knew.
“Yeah, but...why?” Sam asked and Dean looked over at him and he looked around. “Dean, look around, the bunker you checked out, the amount of salt, the way it is laid out...they made it all by hand.”
Castiel choose to get some soap and shampoo, he knew the scent and brand that Dean preferred, he went to get a razor and the shaving cream, after shave and the cologne that Dean preferred. Of course, Dean couldn’t wear the cologne often, only when meeting witnesses, monsters could smell the scent of the cologne and chase them down.
“Oh? Why? What was wrong with it?” He asked looking around, however it was useless as this was the first time he had ever seen it, so whatever changes Castiel had done was not something he could point out.
He paused walking out of the pet store and then turned around picking up another few bags of food and when he came back to the shelter he had some timothy hay, cat food, and dog food for them. He left it and walked away to the small animal part of the shelter.
When Sam took a bite his eyes closed and he smiled, “this tastes just like the cherry pie you made when I was ten!” Sam grinned, “how did you do that?” He asked and Dean chuckled.
“True, I guess that is how you two idiots managed to keep alive.” Gabriel snarked but the tone of voice he used was far too gentle to be taken as an insult. It sounded almost...affectionate. “Anyway, let's see.” Gabriel walks over to Sam pushing his fingers into Sam's hair so he could lightly press his thumbs against the tall man's temples.
“I can't get those kids out of my head.” Dean groaned as he and Sam were doing the packing up for after a hunt. Sam frowned but nodded, it didn't take a psychology degree to know that Dean saw himself and his little brother in the kids, knew exactly how hard it would be on them.
“Wait, wait, wait, what’s going on? What-what happened to the Winchester brothers?” Castiel couldn’t help but smile, to have his name entwined with the name Winchester was something as good, and Gabriel seemed shocked. Sam was his best friend, his brother, and Dean is his everything, so he was the Winchester’s angel, even if he was not an angel anymore.
Sam frowned as he looked through the items in the home of the pocket dimension. There was nothing that he could see, and it had to be something with powers to get into the pocket dimension.
“It would work. The two could probably work well together to take on them.” Castiel said pulling away from Dean. He was careful to pull Dean away from his head watching the green eyes blink open looking bleary like he just woke up.
“This,” he squeezed his wrist, not enough to hurt but to remind Sam that his hand was there. Not that Sam did, or could, forget with the slight pleasant humming on his skin. “Is the physical showing of our own bond, just like the one on your brother.” He explained and it took Sam, who was very intelligent and normally quick on the uptake didn't get it for a while and when he did his eyes widened.
“Come on baby, we’ve got a pie to make.” Dean grinned happily and tugged Castiel by the hand to the kitchen, their free hands are holding the bags. Gabriel chuckled seeing the dopy happy look, as much as he was possible to show, though to Sam he looked just relaxed, calmer than he had ever seen him. Both the younger hunter and archangel knew that Castiel would be willing to do whatever Dean wished. Sam had to laugh, since they became official Dean had given up the pet name of buddy and bud and traded it into baby, babe, and sweetheart.
“I don't know Sam.” Dean shrugged and Sam somehow, someway, managed to keep his facial expression clear. He didn't want to anger Dean with pity, even if it wouldn't be pity but Dean's natural defense mechanism would come up.
“Eden was a pain to plant. I hope it wouldn't be as big a pain.” Gabriel chuckled at the wide green and hazel eyes.
“Yeah...he didn't watch the entire reel and neither did we.” He looked over at Dean who now seemed confused, “apparently the whole thing will be in heaven you go through all your happiest memories, living through your life just seeing the best parts over and over again.” He looked into Dean's green eyes and groaned when he saw that his older brother who was normally quick on the uptake didn't get it. “Do you think that my first happy memory was when I was eighteen years old Dean?” He asked and that struck Dean short.
He entered and headed right to where he heard Dean’s voice, he just wanted to see him, see the man he loved, but he sounded angry and that had Castiel walking quicker to it. What he wasn’t expecting was seeing two Deans and his other version of himself. They were all sitting at a table, his husband a bit away from this universe’s version of them but still too close. In front of each of them was a piece of pie that from the look of the filling was blueberry. Dean’s favorite. There was a mug in front of each and while both Deans were drinking coffee his pathetic weaker self had tea. Who was he? Who was he to sit surrounded by such love? Who is he to have everything he wanted and needed?
“I’m fine.” Castiel frowned at that, he knew that Dean was lying, he could always tell when Dean was lying and this new universe’s version of him was no different. He placed two fingertips to Dean’s temple, he pulled away his thoughts being only when Castiel planned to either knock him out or fly him somewhere. He couldn’t get out of the way and instead Scar Castiel held him still and moved his hand to put his forefinger and middle finger to Dean’s temple but didn’t stop there; his palm cupped Dean’s jaw, his ring finger and pinkie diving into the short spikes of Dean’s hair and his thumb moving to run along the seam of Dean’s lips.
Castiel smiled a bit, he knew that family meant the world to Dean and his little brother the most. Considering that he was kind of surprised how rare affection was between them, they had their banter but not hugging or anything other than a slap at the back. He and Dean hugged more than he had seen Sam and Dean hug.
“Wh-“ he tried to turn but something hit him, and his world went black and the last thing he thought was ‘not again’.
“I'll be fine Samshine.” Gabriel assured his mate kissing his cheek. “Cassie and I will be back before you know it.” He winked before tuning to Castiel stretching out his wings. He jumped and let out an almost purr as Sam stroked the middle one-the most sensitive one-on the side closer to him.
“No two bond like this are the same.” Gabriel explained easily, “we can have bonds of friendship, brotherly, companionship but one like this...it is rare but happens.” Gabriel chuckled, “you Winchester boys are full of surprises.” He cooed winking at Sam and it just confused the tall man.
“Did you forget who you’re mated to?” Castiel smiled and Dean raised an eyebrow, “Dean I’m the closest thing to immortal anyone can with my powers, I am above even an archangel.” Castiel kissed Dean’s forehead, “we can have children,”
“What the hell man?!” Dean yelled and Castiel sighed and cupping his face and rubbing his thumb over Dean’s lower lip.
And for now it was becoming too much. Dean needed a chance to get his bearings, and Castiel would do whatever Dean needed. “Let us all think about it. It would be Dean's...baby...” Castiel couldn't help but smirk at the word now brought to mind the Impala, “it would be a lot of work, even if all four of us work together. He should be allowed to think on it.”
The big clothing had been packed all but that trench coat, Dean clinging to the coat and Castiel had to calm him that the coat would come back. Sam wanted to wake them to sleep before sending them both to their room, it was about time that Castiel got some use of the room, but couldn't bring himself to. They looked so peaceful.
“What are you going to name him Sam?” Gabriel asked and Sam raised an eyebrow tugging Gabriel's hair a bit teasingly.
“I was catholic before I became a demon.” Crowley hummed, “but anyway I will be sweet little Violet and Jacob's godfather. And they will have a squirrel, giraffe, moose and bird for fathers.
“Wait, wait, what?” Dean pulled away from him but couldn’t get up and Castiel frowned but continued on.
He kept his eyes there and stared into his eyes they kept it there until finally it seemed that Dean would listen to him. “You are important Dean. You are worth saving.” He waited before pulling away, “my apologies for getting so close.” He added before turning to the older angel. “So how do we do this?” He asked and Gabriel chuckled throwing an arm around Sam's shoulders, tugging him down and against his side.
The two spent sixty years in Death's Domain, where all the reapers hang out when not reaping, and this place was Dean, Death's, home. Now Castiel was ready because he had to head back. Dean had kissed him passionately before letting him out of his grasp, bringing him back.
“Brand?!” Sam let out a yell and that snapped Dean out of his thoughts of how, why, in what world could Castiel want Dean like that. How could Gabriel not be mad at his brother for having a bond mate so beneath him, or even beating Dean's ass for bringing his brother down so much. It made sense the other angels considering they were such bastards. The entire family sucked and all were pieces of shit-excluding Castiel and Gabriel-so he could see why they didn't bother going like that. If someone as beneath Sam as Dean was beneath Castiel he'd whip that fucker's ass and read Sammy the riot act for that.
Sam smirked as he walked along the corridors of the warehouse. He assumed it was a warehouse with how the sounds of his footsteps echoed off the walls, he was blind and relied more on sound than anything else to keep himself grounded. There were a handful of times that some people he ran into thought he was an easy mark because he was a ‘werido’ and that he was blind. He had no time for them and took them out quickly and semi-cleanly. As clean as blood could be.
The Impala is Dean’s home more than any four walls could hope to be. To make a replica would not be as good and Dean deserved that, he put his heart and soul into that Chevrolet, same as the weapons he made and curated himself.
The worse thing was the watching him while he slept. What he wasn’t planning on was when he opened his eyes was to find him laying in the bed beside him causing him to yell. Dean was under the sheet and blanket and Castiel was laying on top of the blankets at least. He was resting his head on his hand and the other hand was stroking along Dean’s face.
Something about that word sparked something in him. The always bright pink, always slightly warm scar on his left shoulder was that. It was Castiel's brand on him. He had no reason to think it, and he tried to block back his thoughts but they refused.
Sam saw Gabriel watching the exchange, he had been to. It was nice that after so long of being stuck in the middle between Dean and Castiel's sexual tension and those weird eye fucking thing they do. It has been so long that he is used to the two staring deeply into each others eyes.
“De!” Castiel screamed out squirming until Sam put him down and ran to him, pulling him into a hug. Dean immediately held him tight cooing to him softly and smiling Sam turned around heading back to the kitchen. Maybe some burgers tonight for dinner, Castiel could use something to make him 'very happy' as he had once said.
“How about I make you some pancakes?” It was a bit of a selfish offer, he needed something to take his mind off it.
“Relax Dean,” Castiel cooed and his hands were on Dean's shoulders slowly, kneading them and Dean let out a gentle moan as Castiel began massaging.
“Good.” Sam smiled turning the book around, “thank you for caring for him so well. I want him in my life but I'm glad to know that you will take care of him and watch over him.”
“I…I saw him a little over a week ago.” She whispered, “he asked to use the phone but afterwards I didn’t see him.” Her heartbeat was steady, she was saying all she knew. Fuck.
“Damn it Cas.” Dean groaned looking away from him, back down to the kitten who had all but fallen asleep against his chest. “I can't know that there is things like this out in the world and not do something about it.”
“Is there a reason that you called him your ex?” Castiel asked and looked worriedly and the king smirked and leaned on his hand, adopting a flirtatious manner.
“Hey man, you got to let it go.” Sure, he wanted to make Castiel’s life hell, make him pay for what he had to go through, but seeing it in front of him he couldn’t help but feel…
“You’re probably hungry. I know that you haven’t been eating enough lately.” Dean frowned, not happy with the reminder that Castiel had, for who really knows how long, gone ‘invisible girl’ and spied on them for who knows how long. Castiel stood from Dean leaving the hunter to feel a slight chill. “Enjoy exploring our nest,” Castiel added having Dean blink confused as the angel, or whatever he was now, flitted away and disappeared.
Dean hummed as he finished with the hunt. The witch they had gone after was hard to fight and he groaned. He hated witches. He really fucking hated witches. He was just glad they didn't get cursed. Those curses were hell. One had almost gotten him, and that had ignited Castiel's bad ass angel mode and he had gone ape shit on them.
“Tim. Tim Roberts.” Sam relaxed hearing the name, he knew who Tim was, he was one of Charlie's favorite “students”.
“So, in this universe you are close to.” Castiel was glad, he didn’t know who he could go to if he didn’t want to help him.
“I can fly you Dean.” Castiel explained reaching out to take Dean's hand, “we can go wherever you want Dean. Is there anywhere you always wanted to see Dean?” Dean didn't say anything and Castiel knew that there was something that his mate was not saying, “Dean, you trust me,” it was not a question, “so tell me.”
“I'm the last to say this Cas, but you know we have to talk.” Dean said looking at the done pie as he put two generous pieces into separate bowls some vanilla ice cream waiting to be put on top.
“You have nothing to worry about, my love, you’ll be happy. I’m going to make you happy; I can make this world whatever you want it to be.” He cooed to Dean, moving first the hand that had been stroking his cheek and never moving more than a few scant inches from his face back to cup his face and the other went to cup the other one. The look in his eyes…the look in those blue eyes…
He couldn't think much as his thoughts were cut off as Sam, who had made it to the house, leaned over and kiss him. It was like a peck, just a bit longer then a peck. Him standing in the doorway and Gabriel outside. As Sam pulled back with a smirk, Gabriel followed and he chuckled.
When they are trying to salt and burn one of the bodies having just finished digging her grave. She grabbed Dean and Sam, throwing them back into the cottage. She thought they were helping the other ghost and took to fighting them.
After a little bit Castiel took control of the kiss leading Dean and able to feel the soul trembling knew how roughly to kiss him to be what Dean wanted. Kissing each other relaxing and holding each other, Dean gripping his shirt over his shoulder in one hand and the other tangling in Castiel's black hair. In one way it wasn't that much different then kissing a chick other then the slightly rougher skin, but the way it felt was different then anyone else he was sure.
He didn't for several reasons; one was that the bond, though at the time Dean consented to it and clung to him; they not only struck up a friendship but also just might be love but he didn't remember any of that, it would open his mind and emotions to Castiel which the angel knew that Dean was uncomfortable with his own emotions, and just the fact now that Dean had a physical body and is not a soul entwining with grace instead of a body pressed against a vessel.
“How could he say those things be said and not kill his mate?” Castiel asked and Gabriel gave a sad smile.
“Was that hard? Next time someone who is strong enough to destroy you with a mere snap,” Castiel snapped his fingers for emphasis, “I suggest you do as they ask; especially when they are asking nicely.” The being frowned but remained silent and watched him as he left. He did not know why the angel turned god had suddenly agreed to not come near his children, but he was not going to test his luck, he couldn’t really get a read on him and he couldn’t protect all of them.
“Dean is good at cooking but he bakes best,” the pride is obvious in Sam's voice as he talked about his older brother, it was rare for Sam to get an excuse to say what he really thought about him. “If you do the bakery, I think it'd be really good.”
“I think we found a way to get you to relax,” Castiel whispered and Dean only answered by groaning and Casitel smiled moving down to massage down Dean's spine. When he finished all the way down to his lumbar muscle Dean was asleep. Still Castiel massaged his neck and then his foot, smiling a bit at Dean fast asleep, leaning down he kissed Dean's forehead before heading out of their room.
His hazel eyes sliding over to Dean and Castiel he amended that thought, maybe it would be bad, at least he was here to protect them when they were unable to protect themselves.
Dean looked down and let a soft smile spread his lips as he saw the kitten and leaning down gently detangled it from his jeans being careful not to hurt the kitten as he worked its claws from his jeans and lifted it further up to his arms to hold it against his chest, one finger gently rubbing behind the tabby's ear.
Dean sighed a bit gladly accepting the offered bite of apple pie from Castiel who was sat on his lap. At the table Sam was sitting with Gabriel also in his lap, the two were eating a cake that was some tropical one that honestly made Dean think of a pina coloda or something, and Dean rolled his eyes. Considering all the flak that Sam gave Dean for his ‘unhealthy’ eating habits you’d think he would get on Gabriel even more for the fact he ate only desserts and ate easily twice as much as Dean. Being an archangel instead of a human notwithstanding.
“Well this universe was my one hundredth and thirty eighth,” Castiel explained, “and most had you; a different version of you, some got close but were not you. And I would go through a thousand more universe, any amount, I had to go through to find you.” Castiel smiled reaching forward for Dean’s face again, stroking his knuckles along his cheek. Dean did not throw his hand away like he had before, but he did turn his face sharply away; still it was progress.
He went to the cage holding the three guinea pigs, massaging some coconut oil into Bella and trimmed Amara's long fur. He made sure to pick up Grace so that she wouldn't feel left out and talked to all of them. Guinea pigs had to be talked to or could become sick or even die from loneliness, even with the three of them still he wanted to be careful. He did a quick check and seeing that they are all okay he then moved to Buddy. He knew that Gabriel would be by in the afternoon but still Castiel changed out the water, made sure he was adequately fed, take him for a walk and then make sure that he was healthy the same way he made sure the girls were.
They had managed some furniture easily enough, they were just some quick things until they could get around to getting some more furniture suited to the kid's tastes. Dean hummed the song Hey Jude as he placed her down, Castiel having pulled the blanket back, they had a night light they plugged in before moving into the living room to give some fruit to the guinea pigs who had taken to the new children happily. They were a little scared hiding in their hiding places but still made the squeaking sound that they had learned meant they were happy and approved. Buddy on the other hand was more than happy to come right up to them sniffling at them. Violet had already tried to ride him like a pony.
“Bubble baths and manicures?” He asked with a charming smirk, one that had worked on more then a few people and worked even on Castiel. Still, not enough to ignore him not taking care of himself, or even mocking taking self care, and he sighed.
And how the hell was there no phones in this entire house?! Sure, the house was, according to this scarred version of Castiel, this house hadn’t been inhabited for nearly about a decade but still the fact remained that there should be a phone or phoneline or something! Something he could get working somewhat at least. But no, nothing. Sighing Dean glanced around before looking between the two doors, he could leave out of what he assumed was the front door or he could leave out to the patio.
“Sam that is hours away, I will not leave Dean at the hands of that maniac!” Castiel then let out a hard curse in Enochian and glared. “I’m going, you get Jack off to school and start researching, I’ll see if he even still is in that vicinity.” Sam tried to argue but Castiel disappeared, he was gone.
“You want the hippies I can always mix the tea flavors.” Gabriel added with a smirk, “I used to do that in the East India Trading Company.” Sam's eyes widened as he realized just what Gabriel was talking about and let out a low whistle. Gabriel answered turning to his mate to shoot him a quick wink, “so were decided?”
“So we are powerless without a psychic? Where the hell are we going to get one?” Dean asked as Castiel sighed and looked at Dean again. Sensing the question the elder Winchester was asking without speaking You have strong mental and psychic powers. And Castiel answered angels are different and not able to fight the being like a human could
They bought all the coffee cups, tea cups, plates, bowls and baking dishes a set of pretty blue. With that they were ready to start up.
Dean and Sam, after having gathered so much information from people talking at a diner or somewhere over the years, knew that they couldn't have a conversation like this in such a public place. So they held their questions until they got back to the room. It wasn't particularly easy for either of them to not ask the questions brewing in their minds but was probably the best for them to allow the information to settle.
“Darling calm, please my adored, just calm down.” Castiel tried to placate him but it wouldn’t work, Dean was not about to let go of his thoughts. “Dean, think now, do I seem like the memories of what he was when he became…Godstiel you said?” He asked and chuckled, “I am Castiel, you have nothing to worry about.” He promised him but the man just looked away, “would he have done this?”
He would not have really been able to tell that it was his and not another version of himself-because this version of Sam had only one small difference, a small grammatical error which meant that version of Castiel was harried or just bad with grammar because Dean had a similar bad grammar. But the fact remained that when Castiel had gotten a power upgrade he had redone the runes on his mate’s ribs and knowing how much he adored Sam, and Sam was his best friend.
Dean had done it, going to the library when doing research he had asked the elderly librarian and she had given him a recommendation for him and it was a pain in the ass. She recommended a book that was way above him, a tart au pomme from Julia flipping Child. He had found a middle aged woman who was in the cook book section and he had mumbling and she had asked what was wrong, he had grumbled about apple pie and she had picked up a colorful book with fairies on it. Had promised him that it was a good recipe to ignore the fairy theme, it had the best from-scratch apple pie recipe and that was how she taught her daughter to cook, perfect recipes for a first time baker.
Plus he didn't know how to live a normal life, he had tried with Lisa and Ben. It had been like watching a toddler trying to force a circle peg into a square hole in those little toys they have. He wasn't meant for a apple pie life. If that was because of how he was raised or he was just born wrong he tried not to think about, even if he knew the answer. Sam had an apple pie life, a girlfriend, top of his class at Stanford, they were raised the same and Sam was fine, so Dean was made for this life.
“In case you've missed it, we're not in Switzerland.” Dean pointed out, “plus the shelter would have told me if there was something like this.” Dean pointed out but his only answer was the archangel shrugging.
“You do not believe it.” Castiel pulled him resting his head against Dean's shoulder and despite himself Dean smiled.
Every possible monster that existed ran through his head. It was bad when any child was possibly hurt, but not Violet. Not his little girl. Not his kids.
Which meant that he was somewhere here. He just had to find him, once he destroyed the particular angel that had killed his brother he would go about killing the other ones, saving every Dean that he could, even ones that had no Dean would suffer. He’d eradicate Castiel.
“What are you doing De?” Castiel asked as Dean tugged Castiel into his room, the coat folded well and held tightly to the bundled beige to his chest.
Dean moved so that he could be faced with Castiel who was still looking down. Though he wanted to lean down so that he could see Castiel's blue eyes but wouldn't move and wait for Castiel to look at him if he wished. He was just about to back away taking it as his angel not wanting to when the angel of Thursday did look up at him.
It was not until a little bit after noon or half past noon that Sam and Dean got home and while the younger brother-despite now being just fresh from his fifty-fifth birthday-was still an early riser while Dean now being fifty-nine was enjoying being an empty nester and despite rarely taking a hunt anymore he was still part of hunting.
“It's just...as different as Dean and I are we always wanted the same thing. It took me a long time to realize that we did and what it was. A home.” Sam shook his head, “I thought at Stanford I could get it; become a lawyer and become a prosecutor, get a house, marry someone, and maybe even have some kids. Have uncle Dean come around.” He chuckled and looked over at Gabriel and smirked, “Dean wanted the same thing, since we were kids. Just that all he wanted was someone who would accept him for who he is. The good the bad and the ugly.”
I have to tell you guys that it is a pain writing both Castiel’s, and I really hope that this twist worked, I am not that experienced with twists so please tell me if I succeeded?
“Dean-y-buh-bean-y knows that you can't devote yourself to saving people only. Of course too much is just horrid but you need to take care of yourself to.”
“Oh shit!” He yelled turning to make a sharp left but there was no way that Castiel would allow him to do that. His hand whipped out gripping Dean’s forearm and holding on, keeping his grip just under how much it would take to bruise. “Let go of me!” He growled out jerking his arm desperately and Castiel was stuck between a fond sort of amusement and feeling pity for his hunter.
“Why can't I play with the knives like Vi?” He asked and Dean couldn't help but smile, the idea that a knife would be considered playing.
“No. It is a good name. I like it.” Dean grinned squeezing Castiel's hand and his angel gave an answering squeeze of his own.
“I'll explain later.” Castiel promised looking into the box and saw that they were familiar cookies. The checkered sable cookies were the same but there was new things as far as the chocolate and vanilla sable. On top of the chocolate stars there was royal icing, a lilac color while on top of the filleted circle vanilla cookie there was a baby blue royal icing. Using the opposite color their were words and messages like 'finally' 'congrats' 'yay' 'shipping' 'OTP' 'true love' 'love' and such. But what is Destiel and Sabriel?
“You stay the hell away from me!” Dean growled and Castiel was struck again with it, he thought he was making progress.
“But apple, apple is the best.” Dean smiled remembering the apple pies he had gotten in Vermont. They were by the far the best yet, but the ones he was able to make was by far the best. He had only been able to do it once but it was the best and he only wished he could find one that tasted just as good.
“Most people don't view it as owning; same as when they say something like 'my son', 'my husband' or hell even 'my bond mate' doesn't mean you view it as owning. Despite being possessive.” He added with a chuckle and Castiel saw his point.
It was forty five minutes later that Sam and Gabriel finally came in. Castiel was feeling the closest an angel could get to sleeping and he now understood why Gabriel would do it. It made sense for humans who needed sleep but they didn't so why waste up to eight hours just laying and doing nothing, but if 'angel sleeping' could feel like this he would happily do that every night. Dean wasn't asleep only by the fact that he was enjoying the feel of Castiel's wings around him too much to drift off yet, that paired with the fact that the hair brushing by his neck was tickling him slightly.
Humans had such strange mating traditions. But he was not about to complain as Dean was obviously was willing to find a middle ground between his own mating traditions and Castiel's. Dean seemed fine with the newly exposed skin allowing his hands to wonder his angel's torso while Castiel's hand trialed down his hunters torso to begin to prep him for what they were about to do.
He began having dinner at their house growing up at least once a month, he would take them to the fair giving their parents some time for a date night-or whatever their parents did when they were not around-sometimes Crowley even got to see their school plays and their gymnastics meets, soccer games, and graduations or transfers as they grew up.
For Dean it was so confusing, with Castiel it always felt so natural, so right. He didn't question how long they stared into each others eyes, it felt like moments to him but how Sam had talked once or twice he now wondered if Sam was telling the truth. Not that he thought his brother would lie straight out, even about him and Castiel staring into each others eyes forever, but thought that he was just being a drama queen.
I have two possible endings to this story, and I hope you guys will like either. There is a handful of ways I can take this story, so hold on.
“Is there anywhere you want to go Dean? Somewhere you had never gotten to go?” Castiel pushed and Dean gave a chuckle.
“What is this place?” Castiel said looking around as if trying to pinpoint the source with his intense liquid blue eyes. “It is not anything like I've experienced”
“So, this is what you’ve been up to?” He turned to see his baby brother and shrugged a bit looking back at the flowers.
“Of course not!” Dean yelled back and that just confused Sam, “what the hell Sammy?” He demanded glaring, “if I was going to do that I'd have done it by now you idiot.” He shook his head, “I agreed because I had to agree, who knows what he'd do to either of us. I lied.”
He didn't trust Jack for so long, but once he did he was a father to that little boy. Just like Castiel was, both more then Lucifer ever was, and Sam loved being in the role of uncle even if it was unsaid. Jack was a smart kid, realizing how embarrassed it would for Dean to be called 'dad'.  When that kid was sent to the Empty...everyone took it hard but it wasn't like the not sleeping for weeks on end and glaring at anyone who even whispered his name. Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Cassie, Lisa, Ben, Castiel, Sam, Gabriel, despite all the pain they gave them, dad and mom.
The angel and hunter ran in and though Castiel was expecting what he saw Dean didn’t expect it at all. “What the fuck?!” He screamed and the two turned to see him and chuckled, the hell king smirked and put his aviator glasses back on and Castiel saw now why he wore them. His eyes were burnt out like he had seen an angel’s true form.
“Dean,” he breathed out in the gravely voice of his, sounding the most like the angel. The demon king rolled his eyes, of course no one could see behind his glasses and he didn’t actually have any eyes, but they could sense it. He held up his left hand putting all fingers but his ring finger down where it was slight, but it was visible; on his finger was a ring of pale skin where he would wear his wedding ring. “Beloved,” Castiel whispered reaching up to grab his necklace where the ring was sitting.
Castiel flew there being careful that no one saw him, he had learned that humans would be made anxious when they saw a man suddenly appear or disappear. Even the Winchesters knowing exactly who and what he was did not very much enjoy it when he suddenly appeared, disappeared, or went ‘invisible girl’ like Dean called it.
That had gotten Dean to growl out at Sam that his cake was yellow with red raspberry compote topping it and if he were so insisted on having a cake either he or Gabriel would have to wear a dress. Castiel had calmed him down by kissing Dean and promising him that he loves a wedding pie.
“No, I didn't like being in Ms. Venitian's car but here...it smells like cloves, leather and...something else. Metallic somehow.” Castiel hummed not having anything to continue on just relaxing more and Sam chuckled.
“Come here man,” Dean whispered pulling his angel into his arms holding him tightly to him, chest to chest. He allowed himself to relax and feel safe and loved by Castiel. Sure it made him feel like a chick, but damn it this angel was his mate. “We can marry later,” he promised. It had been said to joke but now that he said it he can't shake the idea of a golden ring bedecking Castiel's finger, nor a comforting slight weight on his own.
Of course, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill something that was hunting people, that was the most important part of what he defined his life as; saving people. He just saved people by killing things. Still, being in the woods it felt as if he was going into a place, he had no right to be and attacking something.
But this wasn't just some room he rented for the night or even a week. This was a home. Their home. What he wasn't thinking he'd do is Castiel moving to slot his hand perfectly over Dean's shoulder on his scar from his angel. Sure Castiel had touched him there plenty of times over the years but always over his clothing and never exactly over it. Now his hand was slotted perfectly over his scar.
Sam noticed it was a lie to, but not from looking at Castiel. No. It was Gabriel. The look of shock and confusion on his face and the slight glare at the younger angel was kind of obvious. So why then? What was it that Castiel wouldn't want Dean to know?
However they jumped as the door was opened and then came in their beloved hunters. They looked a bit banged up and worse for ware but didn't seem to be injured. They were barely shut and locked the door before their angels were on them gripping their brand making sure that they could feel the bond.
The next universe he went to he easily found Dean; she was probably the closest version he had seen so far. But not quiet. She was for some reason sitting in front of a camera. “My name is Deandre Winchester. My brother is Samantha and Marcus Winchester is my dad, and Casti…” she paused before giving the warmest smiles, “she’s the love of my life.” Castiel could not help but smile, even though she was not talking about him, not really, it was for the first time warming him.
“Thanks Cas.” Dean smiled his smirk that Castiel loved so much and slowly set Dean down being careful and smiled his gummy smile to him.
“Dean, everyone makes mistakes, and I’ve had more than my share.” He kept walking towards him, his steps measured and sure, “but it’s okay, because I found you.” He reached up, the pale hand’s destination being the freckled cheek, Dean grabbed the hand, throwing it away from him violently. Castiel grimaced but forced it into a smile instead. “I’ll wait, I’m nothing if not patient.”
“Dean,” he said it so deeply the serious way he said his name, “if I was not already bounded to you I'd bind myself to you on the spot.” Dean couldn't help but chuckle at him and smirk leaning down to kiss his angel again.
I hope you guys like this and especially seeing dark Cas deal with canon Dean. I hope I’m keeping both in character.
“Is something wrong?” Dean asked and Castiel knew that he had to trend carefully, if anyone messed with Sam, Bobby and he would say that he could count himself among it to. If anyone messed with the three of them, Dean Winchester would destroy what he had to, to make sure that they would remain safe.
The three men looked from one and another and Castiel saw that Sam was shaking, light tremors, and he began to wonder if he was in the wrong. He had done this hoping that maybe if he started to try to heal the wounds he left he could calm the raging storm inside him and honestly Sam was the easiest one to do at the moment, bringing back his own love.
“They’re Cas’s favorite.” Dean said in way of answer, and to him that was an answer and Sam couldn’t help but grin. For the longest time he thought of Dean as nothing but a womanizer, a love-em-and-leave-em kind of guy. But seeing him with Castiel was like seeing an entire side of his brother that he had never seen nor thought would exist.
Castiel took a step to Dean looking at each other in that strange staring thing they did which Sam was so used to it that if they didn't do that at least four or five times a day. “I don't care what you say about it being normal; it is just freaky.”
“But why can't I sense it then? Usually I can sense anyone who is psychically strong.” Gabriel mused and shook his head, “they normally give off a glow of some kind, almost like my own grace, even if it is fundamentally different.”
Before Dean could even get to him though the mental vampire was taken off him by Gabriel. And for the first time since either brother saw him, he looked like an avenging angel. He pressed the vampire to the wall glaring at him, as the other vampire tried to come to him he was also pressed to the wall of the cave,seeming by nothing but was probably his wing. One of anyway as only Sam could see it who was still hurt.
“What is marriage? What does it mean?” Gabriel asked and Sam's breath caught in his throat. “Friendship, romantic, sexual; all those forms of love. But unlike humans angel bonds like this can't be come from untrue motives-not from tradition, duty, a child, just lust whether for body or for money or power. It is true, and unbreakable.”
“Family business?” Gabriel echoed not understanding how they could make a business about this. Of course he understood humans enough to know that they didn't mean a literal business but didn't know what they meant was their 'business'.
“Except for Jack and I, and it doesn’t say anything about it having to be only this universe’s version of me.” Castiel finished for him, shaking his head, “and I have no idea where he is.
Looking into his eyes, so cruel instead of warm and gentle, protective like he knew they could look, had seen them look, he couldn’t deny it. Castiel began shaking, he had known, even if he tried to hope against it, that it would take a long time to get Dean to warm up to him, that he would have to be patient but that wasn’t too big of a problem. But hatred?
Heh, I feel Dean's pain. Bisexual powers; activate! But I counted how many and that is just from Wikipedia 132 different kinds of pies, tarts and flans. Technically they are all pies. Though it counted whoopie pie, and whoopie pie is not pie. Delicious? Yes. Pie? No. I am talking too much about pie...sorry, anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter.
“You are worried you won't be a good dad. You will.” Sam promised and looked away, “I understand, I ran from my family to. But we are both older and wiser.” Sam chuckled as Gabriel quirked an eyebrow. “Maybe this is what were meant to do, maybe now we can rest and retire from the family business. Be like Bobby, be a help to younger hunters.” Sam explained taking Gabriel's hand, “I'm ready to settle down, settle down with you.”
They were back by the time Dean and Sam had just been able to talk about their own plans and how the bond might change or make their plans feel more like what was meant to be. Sam had always thought he would marry and have a family, Dean had planned to probably die one day on a hunt, or become grizzled like Bobby, and help other younger hunters as he got them what help he could.
“I know for a fact your powers would work Sammy.” Gabriel then looked to Dean, “I do not know if your powers would work Deano. Just because you both have powers they could be different.”
“Well I woke up all alone, my husband gone and my ring missing. When I finally get a whiff of him it turns out that he is dimension hopping looking for a new Dean.” He chuckled and leaned forward, running his fingers along the back of Castiel’s neck, “so I’m in the market for a new hubby~”
Dean sat down and hummed from the meal. Castiel was happy enough to just eat in silence, they would have time later. Castiel waited until the fries were mostly demolished and he only had about two bites left of his cheeseburger that Castiel spoke up.
“Yep. We'll Deano is Cassie's and Samsquatch here is mine~” he cooed and shook his head poofing a candy bar which he pushed towards Sam, “calm down and have some sugar, sugar.”
With a smile he relaxed, rubbing Dean's back a bit. “Was this Gabriel?” Dean nodded and he looked to the cage which still had everything. “Dean...”
“Yeah, Sam to.” Gabriel said jovially but Castiel knew his older brother was worried for his own mate. If running a cafe would be what Sam would want.
“They are? Gabe’s is roses.” He said and chuckled, “you’re planning on giving Cas a bouquet?” He teased and Dean rolled his eyes.
“What in the world do you mean?” Dean pushed but Gabriel answered with just a smirk enjoying getting under the skin of the hunter he always found several kinds of annoying. He could see the two of them getting along but that didn't mean that he didn't want to mess with the older of the Winchester brothers.
“Patience mate.” He whispered and Dean frowned as it didn't feel right. He opened his eyes, pulling from Castiel's mouth looking into his eyes. He was shocked but not worried about what he saw there. Castiel's eyes were darker then normal, but not a worrying way like when he went crazy off of the purgatory souls. Instead he just felt more confident and considering Dean had never been put here; never been in bed with someone who knew him so intimately, been so vulnerable with a bed mate. He was grateful for Castiel to have confidence in what this was happening.
“Get out of your head Cas.” Dean pulled him out and Castiel smiled, since Dean had got his powers unlocked he became more comfortable with them, he could sense more-he had always been able to feel emotions of others and able to focus on getting others to listen to him-and even in extreme situations move things. It was different then Sam's ability to always know things that are going to happen and being able to even sense emotions when he focused or the same move things when in extreme situations.
“The town sign said Tapoco, I’m in North Carolina,” Dean was every now and again thankful for growing up in the Impala, and today was one of those days. He couldn’t think if he grew up in one place, he wouldn’t have a memory of some of the more rememberable names of towns in different states.
“Dean, I’m right here,” Sam questioned and had to stop himself from reaching over to grab Dean’s hand or wrist to assure not only Dean but mostly himself that Dean was back.
Castiel allowed himself to luxuriate in Dean’s arms before he forced himself to speak, “Dean…it was you.”
Dean closed his eyes, even if he couldn't see the white-blue silver of Castiel's grace it wrapped around his freckled form, the shining orange-yellow gold of Dean's soul glowed and fought to get out to touch Castiel's grace. It was not till that grace washed over his right shoulder where the scar of his hand was. The two could communicate even if Castiel didn't often take advantage of it.
“You truly don’t understand how amazing you are, do you know how pure you have to be to make an angel fall in love with you? Do you have any idea where your perfection lies?” Castiel hummed but didn’t reach out to touch him, at least not yet, “my beloved Dean, my greatest treasure. Do you understand how deeply my adoration of you runs?” He got closer, he had never had any trouble being close to Dean, the warm soul pulling him in like a moth to the flame and he saw no reason to hold back now. “Do you know how many dimensions that I traveled looking for you?”
Dean's breath caught in his throat as he heard the one thing he wanted. The one thing he had wanted since his memories of his mom had slowly started to fade away. He had been okay for a while, because though the backseat of the Impala wasn't a house it was a home. But still it had never been enough, as they got older and older and Sam didn't understand what they were doing. He understood why, Sam didn't have any memories of mom, didn't remember the fire, nothing.
“Thank you, Sam,” Castiel was very grateful for his brother, Sam was a brother so much more than all of his angelic siblings.
“Oh we already are well acquainted. Remember that little brother I was telling you about?” He asked with a smile and Kristabella nodded.
“Cas, please don't.” Dean was begging Castiel now, begging him to not do it. “You'll understand soon, this is the only way to defeat Raphael.”
Eventually Dean agreed, not because Castiel wanted him to of course, but because he didn't want his burger to get cold. And he only ate the salad as he ate the burger was because Dean hated one thing more then the rabbit food was warm rabbit food and the burger to wash down the gross food that never filled him up. He was not whipped.
Then they moved onto the next important part. The home on top. They had decided on something simple, it was what the brothers would want. It wouldn't be a good idea either for in case monsters followed them it would make it even easier. It wasn't as if they wouldn't put protective measures on the home itself, just not as in depth as the bunker. Besides, neither brother was one to want a very fancy house.
The effects were immediate, Dean blinking his eyes open and looking up at Castiel. His green eyes were bleary with sleep and he looked like he was not awake, instead stuck between sleep and wakefulness. “Oh Cas, hey sunshine.” Dean yawned, “it’s you, right?”
Dean frowned as he could see there was nothing that was not Castiel. He could tell, could feel something was wrong even though he always tried to fight it back. It was Castiel who he trusted too much to think anything was wrong.
“It’s okay, Cassie brought me back, I don’t know how but I’m back lollipop.” Gabriel smiled brightly.
Besides Gabriel did have a point and maybe Castiel will enjoy picking on out. “Yeah, well then come on Cas. Say goodbye to Grace we'll go get her a sister.”
“Yeah,” Sam answered his brother's half stated question. “First time we went up against a psychic, it was just a kid.” Sam shook his head and roughly rubbed his forehead, “I got a flash of him killing Dean, I screamed and my emotions were so...so...”
“Heya Cas,” Dean grinned, he had listened to the same voice for the last several days but it felt different, the deep gravelly voice was the same but the inflection was so different it was like talking to two different people.
“Of course I am Cas, more than I ever thought I’d get.” Dean said, and though he didn’t even voice or reference the ‘but’ of it though that did not satisfy Castiel. He didn’t want to be just more than Dean ever thought he’d get, he wanted to be everything Dean could ever want and more.
“It’s not like that,” Dean was uncomfortable when talking about feelings, emotions, relationships, or anything like that but he had to speak up now. “Man I get that your Dean died, but my Cas is still alive, you can find a Dean who lost his Cas an-“
How ironic, now that Dean was dead, he made the world something that Dean would want. He set hell right, demons now did the work of hunters, heaven’s angels watched over the humans, the same thing that their father had told them to do. The only difference between the two was that Castiel would make sure they did as he said.
Dean definitely hadn’t run into any animals either, because though there were dangerous animals, ones that could possibly kill him he hadn’t found any signs of that and he would be able to find him either in heaven, hell or purgatory.
It was shocking to even Castiel who knew him so well, the only one who could contest him knowing Dean the best was Sam which was more Sam knew him differently. Slowly, but still happening, tension melted away from Dean, untightening the skin around his eyes, relaxing his mouth, the slight furrow of his brow...it left him looking strangely boyish.
“You again?” Dean asked the demon version of himself and glared at him, but the demon didn’t seem to be in a teasing mood like he was before, being much more serious.
He needed him, needed Dean, ever since losing him it had nearly broken him. Having the Dean of this world had helped him but now losing him he couldn’t handle not having Dean in his arms. He needed to hold him.
Dean looked away still remembering what had happened in hell, what it had caused. But Castiel simply moved his hand to grab his shoulder a little bit harder. “Come, let us finish.”
Word had spread through the Hunters and the monsters that Dean Winchester was back on the scene. They had thought the older Winchester dead and the younger one retired from hunting, but they were wrong. Dean was back and he was back in business, but this time instead of focusing only on monsters he instead went after any evil, he didn’t care if they were human, monster, demon or angel. Of course the angels ran from him or apologized for even gazing upon him, scared of his….his ex-lover? Ex-husband? Husband? Scared of Castiel.
Looks like the siblings would be calling on their godfather to ask if he had ever seen something like this. They knew that they had people who loved them, they would not allow themselves to lose one of them; either sibling would be lost without the other one, and their parents...they don't want to think about it, knowing how much their parents love them and though they didn't have any idea the full extent they know that many people that they loved tended to die.
Sam walked along, his magic out constantly searching for him. He would find the abomination that had killed his brother. He would also find this universe’s bastard angel and kill him. Then he would correct his mistake and go through each universe one by one and take them out.
“What is it Dean?” Castiel asked accepting the thing from Dean, he didn't hold it particularly carefully so Sam knew that it wasn't alive. Castiel had a affinity for finding bugs and worms and wanting to bring them in.
It wasn't long to make a new ID for them, he was able to buy the social security identity of two dead guys and changed the name. He asked them about what name they wanted to go by and decided to go with Campbell.
Few things could be as amazing way to spend his nighttime hours as holding his mate. His sweet hunter sleeping unaware of the world as his wings held him tight, stroking with his hands, massaging lightly. Seeing how Dean would make a soft little sleepy hum or snore, even a snort almost almost as if answering what Castiel would say. The fact that he snorted when Castiel said something like how special and pure he was, hum as he whispered loving words, or snore to just the average things he would say like memories of when he was a fledgling made him believe that even more. Either way it was infinitely better then standing outside his room waiting for him to awaken.
“I know that Dean,” Castiel then let out a guffaw, “I never heard you speak history like this.” Dean shrugged and gave Castiel a saucy wink.
“He did not!” The god was hovering over him, staring right into his eyes, “he…he…we were in love. Deepest love, profound love, I-“ Castiel was struggling but Dean wasn’t listening to him, wasn’t paying attention, the blue eyed man could have been speaking in another language for all the good it did.
“Years? It’s been years?” Sam knew he could be lying but the way he was saying it made him think it was all truthful. “I’m so sorry Sam, how…how long has it been?”
Despite all of the things that are pointing to Dean being alive, screaming it from the mountain tops that he was just sleeping, but Castiel still couldn’t bring himself to let go of Dean. Like if he left the room to put things away the human way Dean would slip into that corpse-like state while he was gone.
He began breathing fast and made a quick flight, fast as light zipping from one room to the other, thinking maybe he got it wrong and would have to find another way to find Dean but no. No Dean was not in the house, anywhere.
“Well it seems that no matter what universe you are in, you and Dean-O can’t just be straightforward.” Gabriel pulled Sam into his side and Dean was shocked that Sam allowed himself to be pulled into the trickster archangel’s side. He would have to talk to him about this sometime. “He and the Dean from his universe are mated but it sounds like Dean rejected him.”
Sam had heard classmates talking about from-scratch homemade goodies. Cookies and cakes mostly but he had always thought of pie as that was what he wanted, he wanted to join in and as none had talked about made from scratch pie that is what he wanted.
“Eleven? I would have just been five!” Sam gasped out going back in his memory but he couldn't remember anything about being five. He couldn't remember anything about that. “What went on?!”
“Come on up with me De,” Castiel reached down taking the pillow Dean handed him, putting it on the bed while Dean crawled up the bed, settling down as his best friend pulled the blanket over both of them.
“Keep safe.” Sam said simply before disappearing, following where Castiel could possibly be. He wouldn’t think, he wouldn’t imagine.
“When I was fifteen years old...dad sat me down and handed me a gun, I didn't think anything of it. Figured I would just have to clean it or something but.” He cut off and groaned now that the cat was out of the bag he would have to follow that feline all the way out the house. “He told me that Sam was open to supernatural influences and if he ever went under one to kill him.”
There was a sound of flapping wings and suddenly both Castiel and Gabriel were standing there. When Sam looked up from his book hearing a footstep jumped a bit seeing the two angels. “I'll never get used to that.” He complained to himself before sighing, “find anything?”
Sam grinned as he felt Gabriel clinging to him, pressing his front to the moose like human's back, the archangel's arms wrapped around his husband and mate's waist. “Come on sweet, let's go relax in the Mediterranean sun, the water is amazing this time of year.” Gabriel kissed Sam's neck teasingly pulling on Sam's shirt.
Dean, again, wanted to go foreword to check Sam for himself. He trusted Gabriel in a way he normally didn't trust people. It wasn't that almost instantaneous trust he had with Castiel but he did trust the archangel. Maybe it was how similar the archangel was to him, a similar sense of humor and justice. Still he didn't like the idea of him getting too close to his baby brother.
Ever since Dean had taken Castiel into the pet in Philadelphia every time they went to a town for a hunt he had to find a pet shop or animal shelter to let him pet the animals. “Dean, you mentioned before you thought about getting a cat?”
Castiel was shocked and disgusted knowing what was happening while Sam, Dean and Gabriel disliked it and thought it was wrong on both their parts but really what could they do? To tell him would hurt him more, and he didn't really talk to them. He wasn't like his wife, he never had a problem and would give them a quick wave when he walked out to work and often stopped by the cafe and had no problem when he found out that they were two sets of brothers who had married the other set of brothers and the cafe was their business. He had the couples two young children and had looked surprised for a moment before nodding and asking what was good their.
“You still have it?” Gabriel questioned, it had been years since his death, that Sam even had it struck him. Sam looked from it to Gabriel and gave him a smile, stroking Gabriel’s face.
“Yes they were.” He agreed before they moved to the next place, maybe their father would be in India?
Gabriel and Castiel both chose honey while the two girls chose sugar. Now looking at them together both angel's could see the unmistakable bond of soul mates. It was nice to speak to the unassuming kind hearted women who seemed to have no bad bones in their body.
