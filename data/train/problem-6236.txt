Steve blinked, his brow furrowing as he fought to pull his thoughts together. “The shooter,” he started, twisting in his seat. “The one at our apartment.”
The last word sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. And slowly, it sunk in that Tony was serious about this. And Steve started to wonder if it was possible that he loved him, too. Ridiculous as it was.
be able to overcome that. It would be nice to know that maybe something good can come out of all the bad.”
Pressing his forehead against Steve’s, Tony looked straight into his blue eyes. “We have to avenge them. We still have to stop him. And I need you to help me do it.”
A surprised laugh burst out of him, and he only had enough time to pull the razor away from his face before that happened. His free hand rose to his face, pressing over his mouth. It took him a long moment to regain his bearings after that, but when he did, he met Tony's eyes through the mirror. "No chance. You're stuck with me, kiddo."
With his body this over-sensitive, Tony's thrusts were on the verge of painful, but Steve wouldn't tell him to stop, not when it was clear he was ready to pop. Steve couldn't think of anything he wanted right now more than to feel Tony come inside of him. Whenever it was Steve topping, it felt amazing, and Tony seemed to love it.
been sixteen years since Tony had told him he loved him, after all. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “Sorry for dying on you. Sorry you had to look for me so long.”
. You can’t stop this,” Tony said, giggling. “He made Extremis a part of his body. He made it a closed system, and I’m in every last one of his cells. There is no way out!”
There was movement on the other side of the door. Footsteps. And yet, Steve was almost surprised when the door finally opened.
His body twitched, arching into Steve’s hand. Steve eased him forward until Tony lay flatly on his chest. Steve pressed his body gently onto the bunched pillows. “Alright.”
“Don’t,” Agent Romanoff said, suddenly standing next to him. Her voice was so quiet that Steve was sure only he could hear her. “Let him go.”
“Since when are we civilized?” Steve’s hands were tearing at the towel again, finally throwing it on the floor for good.
Rhodey was staring at him as though he had spontaneously broken into song. “Wait, what—you really thought that? Are you on
Soon enough, he had the upper hand. Clint was an awesome fighter, Tony had to give him that. But FRIDAY had studied all of his moves for years. He knew how Clint operated, and eventually, he had him pinned down on the ground.
One of Wanda’s blasts broke through Vision’s defenses, sending him flying towards where Bucky and Natasha were currently fighting on the training mat. Bucky had Natasha in a stranglehold, but she managed to kick him in time to free herself and cast him a nasty grin before throwing herself at him. In that moment, however, Vision plummeted to the ground. The two cried out, breaking off and scrambling to get out of the way. “Watch it!” Natasha shouted. “This isn’t battleground!”
“Yeah, I know,” Steve said, his eyes on Barnes even as he munched happily on the onion. “Good for him. He seems to have fun.”
There was a greenish energy floating within the room, circling around Steve’s head and those next minutes were easily the most horrible ones of Tony’s entire life.
“No point. Just… two, huh?” His face clouded over, and there was something in his voice he couldn’t quite make out. “All girls?”
When Steve followed Natasha few minutes later, he took a moment to look around the new common room. It had taken a while to get used to the idea of spending half of their time away from the tower, and to split up their lives between the two places. The facility had been in fairly good shape from the start, albeit a bit dusty, but by now, they’d managed to make the whole place just as homey as the tower was.
“No need to remind me,” he answered, huffing at himself. Steve could slam his shield down into his neck, and he would die with a fierce love in his heart. He was just that gone for him.
Tony wiped the steam from the mirror and stared into it, long and hard. It was May 29th 2018, the same day he’d chosen to travel back in time—and also his birthday.
He just needed to get close enough, activate a short blackout in the comm-line, and hope Steve would believe him before he needed to get back online. Ten seconds, fifteen tops, anything else would seem suspicious.
Still, the sooner they’d arrive in Hopkinsville, the better. They could all do what they wanted for the rest of the trip, and Tony could place some much-needed space between him and Steve and get the tantalizingly delicious image of them writhing together on some bed out of his mind.
Steve stepped out onto the Commando Bridge, peering inside the foyer. The lobby was still vacant. The upper hallways, best to his line of visibility, were empty as well.
Fury’s forehead was bruised, and there was a cut beneath his single eye—it was more than an inch long from the middle of his under-eye to past the corner—and a dozen small, half-healed scratches on his back. His neck was streaked with blood, and there was a lump on Fury’s temple that looked really serious. He couldn’t quite hide the pain from his expression. Nevertheless, his usual aura of self-assuredness remained intact.
It took Steve a long moment to recover from the pain, but when he looked back up, he spotted Bucky and Natasha finally carrying the cradle outside of the truck.
“Aw, come on.” Clint grinned cheekily at him, tossing shaggy blond hair out of his eyes. “I’ve survived worse. Do you really think I could just sit at home and let you have all the fun? There wouldn’t be much point in reflooring our sunroom if the world ends before I get it done.”
Tony nodded in agreement, and Steve sat down next to him at the table, reaching for his hand and feeling relief course through him when Tony squeezed his fingers. He looked around at the fine porcelain—and the many candles. It was all so very overwhelming. Steve now lived in a world where his meals would be served on a candlelit table every single day.
Tony snorted, shaking his head in disbelief. “How did he have a family the whole time and we didn’t notice?”
“Okay,” Steve confirmed and promptly pressed his mouth to Tony’s. He wound both arms around his waist and hauled Tony into his lap.
Steve startled from where he had been dancing on that thin line between sleep and wakefulness. He was sitting in the communal kitchen, staring down at a city map of Sokovia, but his exhaustion must’ve gotten the better of him at some point. He flashed Natasha a welcoming glance and smiled softly at the tender look on her face. She’d gone to get coffee just a few minutes before, but his fatigue had drowned out time so that it felt like hours had passed since he had seen her.
"You'll always have a place on the team if you want it. It's not like your position was taken by anyone else when you left. And… no one can take your place, anyway."
Steve scowled at him without heat. “How about you let me do this on my own pace, yeah? Three days ago, I was pretty sure I was exclusively into girls, and now I’m debating whether or not to blow you before doing the whole…prep thing… so kindly stop the teasing? I’m strategizing.”
They’d both agreed that Steve wouldn’t keep his old SHIELD apartment, since—technically—he wasn’t working for SHIELD anymore. Instead, he got a place of his own. The apartment was ridiculously small, bleak and sparsely furnished, and had been empty since he effectively moved to New York two years ago. Tony’d offered to buy him a larger one—hell, he’d offered to buy him a mansion in Spring Valley. But no, Steve remained adamant that he didn’t need any luxuries when being in DC and thus, every time Tony came to visit, he practically had to sleep on top of Steve because the damn bed was just that small.
They stayed like that for a whole long while, curled in each other’s arms, before Tony released a trembling sigh and brushed a kiss against Steve’s throat. “I’m, uh… exceedingly bad at feelings,” he started, clearing his throat, because he owed Steve an answer, even if he couldn’t simply repeat those words in kind. “Train-wreck-terrible, really, but, yeah, l’m… there with you. Same page.”
“Yeah, we did,” he confirmed. “The wedding was a mess, to be honest, but… still the happiest day of my life.”
Natasha’s hands came up, stroking his hair, before framing Tony’s face and keeping him from retreating into himself again. “Yeah, and you can do that as
Maria backed down a little, but not by much. “Okay…” she said in a quieter tone. “I don’t. But he assassinated
"You're not really gonna…" he asked then, breaking the kiss and staring into Tony's face, eyes flicking to that wicked mouth ever so often. "are you?"
Steve finally turned around at that, staring at Tony with an intense expression. Tony pretended not to notice for a moment, but ultimately, his eyes were drawn up to Steve’s.
Steve smiled at him. “Hate to break it to you, but you’ve never been easy to deal with.” He leaned in, and kissed Tony gently. “
His head was spinning and his chest felt uncomfortably hot as he leaned down to kiss Tony, pressing their lips firmly together. A part of him posed an official protest to what was happening, but he couldn't be bothered with whatever the problem might be. It couldn't be that bad, could it? Not nearly as important as kissing Tony was at that moment.
“It’s crazy,” Tony said as he looked at Steve now. “That it’s over now. For the first time I think I’m seeing a future. For me… for us.”
Steve tore Tony’s feet free of his shoes before shoving both pants and boxer briefs down. “I wish I wouldn’t have. Kept it from you, I mean. I’m—”
,” he exhaled, limping, his camera focusing on the tiny man, “that was uncalled for. See how I’ll ever buy my kid those Ant-Man rompers.”
“It’s you taking me,” Steve praised, staring at Tony’s hard, leaking cock that hadn’t softened for so much as a second.
"That's the plan," Steve said, grinding down slowly against Tony. The direct skin to skin contact on his back felt amazing, but more than anything it served to increase his need tenfold. "If you're good, I'll even let you touch." He nipped at Tony's lip before moving to kiss his neck.
Tony met Steve’s eyes and felt a shiver run down his spine, his hands impatiently tearing at Steve’s uniform trousers. “Baby, I’ll keep on wanting you forever,” he whispered, yanking the belt away and jerking his fly down with more impatience than he cared to display. Didn’t matter, though. Steve’s cock sprang into his hands, after Tony dragged the pants down over Steve’s ass, and he was rewarded with a moan in turn.
Well, that explained a lot, Steve thought. He was so horribly nervous, and yet… there was a deep yearning inside his chest ever since he’d seen Tony at those cliffs.
And that was what this was about. Steve, plain and awkward, was in love with Tony Stark and that would be enough.
"You can't plan for something like this," he said, carefully not mentioning emotions—especially not the kind of emotions that were slowly taking hold of his heart.
Tony’s mouth slanted across his, and there was no reservation now. Nothing, except softness and heat, and the dizzy, breathless sensation it left him with.
Just as Tony had predicted, it hadn’t taken long for the police to confirm the body in the boat was female, and not much longer for them to identify it was indeed that of Indries Stark.
“Not really. We won’t take any risks,” Tony hurried to say. “There’s no chance this can go wrong. I promise.”
Releasing his fingers from Tony's body, Steve turned to look down between them. Experienced as he may be, Tony looked like he might break if Steve made the wrong move. He knew that wasn't the case, but still felt it in his gut. He knew he'd be going slow for a while.
“Go away, Detective,” Tony said, letting just a hint of the Devil’s dark, commanding voice slip into those words. “Leave.
Also, at least Natasha seemed to think they were heading towards… something. And if Natasha believed in something, that had to count for something, right?
“We might not agree on this,” Steve said against Tony’s mouth. He traced a finger along his lips. “We don’t always. But we’ll find a way.”
“I’ll figure it out,” was all he could say, the volume of his own voice jarring him out of the long stretch of silence that spread between them.
He had a strange sense of déja vù—it sure as hell wasn’t the first time Bruce went all cockblocker on him, especially when it came to his prof-friends. Whatever. Not like he
Steve couldn’t help it—a startled laugh left his lips as he let his head drop on top of Natasha’s. He felt Bucky’s human hand pet one of his knees and saw Sam smiling from his seat in the cockpit. Clint mumbled something that sounded a lot like ‘damned honeymoon-phase all over again’ and Steve knew they’d be okay.
want to make you happy,” Steve said. “But no, it’s… I see what you meant now, when you said we had more to give. I want that. I know it won’t be easy for us, but I think it’s gonna be worth it.” He sighed. “If I hadn’t stalled that long—”
“Probably just the stupid robot,” Stane replied, his words now perfectly audible as well. They had to be walking down the hallway. “A waste of good material, but that sentimental fool always lets it roam freely.”
“I love you,” Tony murmured against his lips, because what the hell, he might as well do this the right way, no jokes, no cute little innuendos—just plain love.
Three days had gone by, and he still felt it with every fiber of his being. The way his hand had been combing through Steve’s bloodied hair with desperate tenderness. The way Steve’s voice had cracked when he’d asked why Tony hadn’t done more to save them.
go both ways. This,” he put his hand on the Accords draft, “is ensuring both parties have a right to do what needs to be done when the world needs it. There’s a few things I would consider adjusting, but all in all… I think this is something everyone could work with.”
With a low breath, he forced his muscles to unclamp around Steve. “I don’t know,” he answered truthfully, probably more than he should. “Never had to know, but… this is good…” The faint feeling of discomfort had faded almost instantly, and the only thing left was Steve, thick and large inside him. “You feel so good.”
Two firm hands found his wrist, jarring him back to himself and spearing his insides with clarity. His eyes found Tony’s—not Iron Man’s, not Extremis’,
It likely wouldn’t be easy to change one’s modus operandi. It was one thing to know that they could be good together, and another entirely to figure out how to get there.
"Safety protocols activated," JARVIS announced as Steve showed himself into the room. He saw Tony in the decontamination chamber with the hammer in hand and ran for him. "Tony, no!"
He bit his lower lip. One of his hands settled on Steve’s shoulder, his thumb brushing along Steve’s neckline.
Tony’s jaw twitched. “Don’t thank me yet. I’ll try talking with Ross so he won’t make any urgent moves, like giving a killing order.”
Steve's hands left their posts on Tony's sides in favor of cupping the man's face. He shut him up with a sound kiss, effectively swallowing anything else Tony might have wanted to say. Only when he was sure Tony wouldn't try to speak further did he pull back.
"Sounds dangerous," Steve teased. He loved feeling Tony's slow, languid waking, and he had the feeling Tony would've loved to stay in bed all day like this, but some things were pressing enough that it just wouldn't do. Breakfast was only one of those things, so Steve leaned over a little to press a kiss to Tony's lips and held him for a brief moment before rolling them over.
He remembered wanting Steve that first day they’d met. Lusting after him, watching his muscled, attractive body as he’d chased his suspects, relishing in that earnest smile on his face and hardening beyond belief just at the sight of him. He’d known then, before even knowing Steve’s name, that he would be his greatest conquest.
like he was right there, in ancient Rome, talking to a senator who somehow looked exactly like Tony but seemed… maybe more approachable.
Tony looked at her, maybe truly seeing her for what she was for the first time. One of his best friends. And likely the strongest woman he’d ever known.
, Tony thought, and despite it all, he felt fear and panic crawling up his spine. And repeating thoughts of
Fury stepped forward with a sudden, unexpected incursion of authority. “I didn’t need to tell you anything. Project Insight is a preliminary protection. SHIELD doesn’t need the approval of Captain America for every safety measure put into commission.” He frowned, shaking his head briefly, saying, more to himself, “It was out of my hands. The project was out of my hands the whole damn time.”
Tony stopped, momentarily confused when he suddenly felt Steve’s hands on his chest, trailing down and instantly starting to undress him. He tried to focus on the numbers that were scrolling down in front of his eyes, but Steve’s fingers were pressing onto him more firmly, the tips moving along his length, and that was, that was just…
Infiltrating SHIELD at this point was basically a suicide mission. Missions of that magnitude took weeks of planning on a normal day, and that was
“I get it, Picasso,” Tony said, clipped, as he pulled on his pants with sharp movements. The air felt cold against his skin. There was a lump in his throat and he felt barren and exposed. He knew this wasn’t just a crush anymore, maybe it never had been, and if not with words, his act had just unveiled that part of himself he’d tried to keep secret. To keep himself from being hurt.
He clasped a hand on Vision’s shoulder, before he turned back to his work. He heard Vision standing up, walking towards the door, and released a low breath.
Totality. There it was. The black sun was surrounded by a celestial bluish orange halo—the solar corona.
At that, the baby smacked its lips and angled its face toward Maria. Ian’s eyes opened and bright blue eyes peeked out from surprisingly dark lashes. Maria murmured something and the baby mewled, its eyes blinking languidly.
“He actually does look a lot like you,” Maria mused after a moment, looking back to the group still standing around Tony.
Her nose scrunched up in disgust as she took in the mess he’d made on the kitchen counter. “How did you even survive without Steve all these years?”
Steve nodded his thanks as he took one of the bottles, taking a sip. Despite not being able to get drunk, he still liked the taste. “That’s sort of hard to believe,” he said. “That
He wanted to go to him, but the fear was too strong. The fear that Bucky would look Steve in the eyes and that everything they had shared with each other throughout their lives would still mean nothing to him.
Steve sighed deeply as he turned the ring over in his hands, then put it back around his finger. “I didn’t want you to find out,” he whispered.
Steve used that moment of hesitation to punch Bucky with the shield as hard as he could in the ribs and luckily, it took him by surprise long enough for him to wriggle out of his grasp and gain some distance between them. “Sorry,” he said sincerely when Bucky looked up at him with a flash of surprise. “This hurts me more than it hurts you,” he said, and he gripped a fistful of Bucky’s brown hair and pulled his head up, and then bashed it into the tile below.
A heavy pause, and Steve could do nothing but stare at the man in front of him, trying not to show the fear those words inspired within him.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said with a grin, rubbing more soap into his skin. “It never stood a chance. Carol and Thor did that new thing they trained for, and that was basically it. They struck him down so hard it exploded on the spot. Magnificent, I tell you. Right, Steve?”
Tony smiled softly, caressing his face with his free hand as his other persistently tugged at his boxers. “We don’t have to go all the way, Steve,” he said, a charming blush tinting his cheeks. “I just… I wanna do something… you—Can I do this? Please.”
Natasha threw him a little smile. He vaguely remembered that she’d taken a few bad hits on the bridge, but she was already looking much better, though her face was still shadowed with bruises. She was dressed in a big black hunting jacket and a pair of men’s trousers. Her red hair hung messily around her face.
“Somehow, I’d hoped after today things were looking up,” Steve said, then sighed. Tony had gotten notice of an unauthorized landing at a smaller airport near Vienna, just an hour before the bombing. And he had no idea what Tony was thinking now. “You don’t actually believe he did this, right?”
“But I’m more worried about Tony at the moment,” she went on. “He was not just furious, he was… done. Finished. He wants to sell LUX and I’m not sure what he’s planning.”
Aside for that morning incident, Steve’s day passed in relative ease. Steve took a shower and then taught a class in the morning, followed by his usual workshop slot. After that, he had a few counseling meetings with arts students who were struggling with some of the material. All in all, it was early afternoon when he was done for the day and headed home.
“Because I’m nervous,” he agreed, chuckling at himself. “Was it…” He swallowed, feeling foolish and more than a little flustered. “Was it any good?”
huh? Steve figured it made sense they would call it that. Natasha’s and Clint's visions had been that, right? "There was no reason to be worried. I just… It was a bit of a shock," he said on a slightly embarrassed huff of a chuckle. "Did you reach any conclusions from their reports?"
“Yeah, trust me, I wouldn’t touch that with a pole right now. No, I…” He sighed, standing up in the middle of the cockpit, looking at each of them. “I know this isn’t the best time to say this, but… Remember when, uh, when the shit with Pierce went down how I told you that there’s stuff I wouldn’t tell either of you?”
“Accessing archive.” There was a clicking voice, and the few monitors next to Zola’s face switched to a list of black and white photographs. “HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. War taught us much.”
The painting was almost life-size. The scene showed Tony—bare-footed, sporting his usual battered tank top and some black sweatpants. Steve had drawn him at an angle, but with his head turned to face the viewer. His head was propped on DUM-E’s claw; chin tilted down, eyes glassy. He looked a bit overwhelmed with the current situation, a little lost in his own thoughts. He looked beautiful and hopeful, but also so, so vulnerable, just as Steve had remembered him.
The words only made him trash harder. He pushed against Steve without reservation as moans of pain tore out of his mouth. He wanted to scream. Long, agonized screams for all the ones he’d killed. Screams for a never-ending assault of darkness where he would never be heard, much less saved. A war raged within him and he didn’t know how long he fought against Steve’s grip.
“You haven’t,” Natasha said, more forcefully. “And even if that were the case, Steve’s a big boy. He’s making his own decisions.”
seemed to be perfectly happy with the way things were. And the heavens didn’t come crashing down because he and Tony were together. It wasn’t wrong for this version of Steve.
He let his hands trail over the keyboards, just sitting like that for a good few minutes. The first sound was a deep moll, the second, too. Tony chuckled, shaking his head at himself.
The black disc of the sun was outlined by a fine line of shimmering light. The sudden descending darkness was eerie. The air went completely still. The disoriented birds flying everywhere nowhere. A million eyes raised to the sky. It was as if to complement the deep uncanny silence, the crowd suddenly roared in amazement.
There was a thin layer of dust covering everything down here, and Steve knew without fault that Tony hadn’t been here since his wife died.
A small smile rose to Steve’s lips. If this was what had gotten into Tony—this was something he could deal with. This was something they could work through. “Tony, I… I’m not going to California.”
Below, there was a blueprint of something that looked a lot like a time machine, and even further below—a note:
After only two hours on the road, Bucky and Tony were engaged in a screaming match over the virtues in traditional Rock ‘n’ Roll compared to the drivel that popular music stations featured. At the rest stops, Tony would pointedly avoid all of them except maybe Rhodes and Carol, as though tainted by enjoying their company. And when Steve had asked if they could maybe stop at the ‘Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier’, Tony’s expression had gone deathly stoic.
Tony kept wiggling next to him. They were both sitting in the shelter, watching the few drops of rain falling to the ground, and Tony was constantly shifting. Craning his back, he tried to reach behind himself, scratching his lower back, though that obviously didn’t do him any good.
Tony clenched his jaw, struggling to calm down. His knuckles whitened as his grip on the phone constricted. If he yelled at Steve, it would only serve to prove his point. He also knew if he hung up, Steve would only call him right back.
Tony was so insistent, so single minded when he talked to Steve that it was making him impatient. He kept his eyes level with Tony. "I'm counting to three," he said, lifting one hand—the one under Tony's knees—to knock on the first door. "One."
“I’ve got you,” he whispered and everything in Steve relaxed all at once. Tony smiled at the gesture, and then he pushed inside Steve, one fluid thrust, grunting as his warmth surrounded him. When he was fully seated, he pressed soft kisses on Steve’s spine, and set a sweet and slow pace, pivoting his hips just so.
All of them mentioned how they looked forward to seeing the ‘old Tony’ return to Stark Mansion instead of that shell of a man he was today, though Steve had heard some of them whispering that they believed that version of Tony had ultimately died with his great love. But of course they still hoped that both Stark Mansion and Tony could be restored to their former grandeur.
“W’never got to finish what we started earlier,” Tony slurred after a moment, as if reading Steve’s mind once again.
Steve took a breath and held it, trying to calm down his fraying nerves, before lining up and pressing forward. The answering gasp was more rewarding than Steve would willingly admit. He never stopped the motion inwards until they were pressed tightly together, at which point he took a long moment just to admire the alluring sight of them connected like this.
“I thought you wanted to let me down easy?” Tony asked, his eyes wide and imploring. Every fiber in him needed Steve to tell him that
The kiss that followed was different. At the simplest touch, Tony knew this kiss was different. Not a fleeting taste; Steve’s tongue tasted and teased, he explored every inch of Tony’s mouth, hands taking chart up his arms until he was caressing the softness of his throat and, eager fingers burrowing into his hair.
Breathing heavily, Steve watched Tony finger-fucking himself, spreading his legs so he could see better, and it was almost too much. He stepped closer again as soon as Tony withdrew his hand, settling his slick cock against Tony's ass.
Steve gave him a small smile, and nipped from his glass. “You didn’t, now that I think about it. I’m very hurt. Nowadays you’ve only got eyes for that new guy.”
Steve furrowed his brows. “On Stark? No, I’ve… I wasn’t really there yet. He said there were files on Peggy and my team, too, and I…”
Across the small path, Steve watched as the guests approached Sharon and paid their last respects. She shook each of their hands as they murmured about Peggy’s dedication and pioneering role about women as leaders, and how they looked forward to working with her in a few years. She only thanked them for coming, just as formally, in reply.
“Of course, what brings you here, man?” They were friends through Tony and without him as a buffer things were a little awkward. Especially since James was taken off from Stark Industries.
“Alexander Pierce. The man who lost the easiest election.” a husky voice filled the room. Pierce knew it was coming. He knew the Founder was not happy. But he was finally meeting the Founder and that Pierce seem like a kid in a candy shop.
Steve’s expression got serious. “I want you to grab every citizen left and fly them out of here before everything goes downhill.”
“The dead ones aren’t so dead at all,” Tony called as he sped towards them. His voice wasn’t quite panicked, but it was a close call. “Incoming!”
‘A lot’ didn’t even begin to cover it. What a sight they must make: A red-caped God, a man-robot, another man wearing nothing but purple stretch pants, and three people fully covered in ashes and grime. There was probably one of those God-awful bar jokes in there.
it,” Ross snapped at Tony. “It’s not yours to handle! It’s clear you can’t be objective. I’m putting special ops on this, end of discussion.”
His hand was embedded in the rock, and Steve had to brace his foot against the wall to jerk it back out. When he withdrew it, the fingers were bloodied. Slowly, he sagged against the wall. There was a subdued pain in his hand and wrist and his head was pounding. He hardly even noticed it. Steve fell forward against the stone, bracing himself on his elbows and dropping his head into his bruised hand.
In stark contrast to New York, the people mourned in complete silence. When Tony walked into the throne room, Wakanda’s remaining guard stood in a circle. Their faces were serious and respectful, while a young woman slowly sat down on the chair in the middle. There were tears running down her cheeks, but otherwise, she remained stoic.
Steve nodded, as he let his gaze wander over the meadow. After days of rain, the weather had finally calmed down. It didn't exactly reach summerlike temperatures, but the sun was casting a nice warmth down on them.
Natasha was sitting on the couch in the middle of the common living room. She had her legs crossed and cast Tony one of her patented ‘unimpressed looks’. Bucky was sprawled on the reading chair next to her, flipping through the TV channels, not sparing Tony any attention, and Rhodes and Bruce were sitting on a couch a little further away. They were both sporting equally amused smiles as they regarded Tony’s fidgeting, jittery form.
And Steve couldn’t take it anymore. He couldn’t handle Tony being so far from him. Standing just inches from where he was and yet miles away.
Tony looked sideways, squeezing his eyes shut and reciting Pi to one hundred decimal places of denial. “And what if it is?”
“Uh, thanks,” Tony said as he took his shirt and slipped into it. Then, he accepted his jacket from Steve, pulling it on, too.
“Can I…” Tony prompted as he neared him once more. Steve had no idea what went through his head, but with some hesitation, he curled his fist around Steve’s length. “Is that okay?”
“Mmm,” Steve hummed against him, trying to pull away only to be yanked back down. Several failed attempts passed before Tony could find it within himself to deprive his lips of Steve’s.
Later, they drove towards northern Italy. With Bucky and Dugan and Morita and Falsworth and all of the others. They were good fellas, each of them specialists in their own field. Well, Dugan was mostly a specialist in cigars, whiskey, and ladies, but that had a certain benefit in itself.
All around them, the people broke out into cheers as their school’s team set foot on the playfield for the big final game. Most were already chanting Steve’s name like he was the God of Sports himself.
want Steve to know him in any way humanly possible. He wanted Steve to know his virtues and his errors, and find out every little thing about Steve in return. He wanted Steve to be his, not just now,
There was another heavy pause between them. Tony stared at the ceiling. “I met Parker at the tower a few days ago,” Tony told Rhodey. “He said he’d come over and have dinner with us sometime.”
aiming at Bucky, but his whole body was shaking. Steve slowed down. If Tony truly wanted to take that shot, he would’ve done so by now.
But Steve? He was married, wasn’t he? And Steve would never cheat on his wife—and why should he want Tony? A man? A man like
"R&D has very special place in my heart. Managing people and deals can get exhausting. You'll find out."
“The conversation can continue later. Right now, I want to have a good dinner with my two favourite men so do not try to ruin this. Both of you."
As I said before, I hope the wait was worth it and you enjoyed reading this chapter. Please let me know your views and thoughts, I would love to hear them all!
Guys, thank you so much for your support. You are already so excited about this and I'm so happy thank you so much! I hope you keep liking it!
“Yeah. But I don’t know why they wanted us to see that. It’s just a lot of failed experiments, what good does it do for us? They’ve never given up information so willingly."
Steve shut the video down. His heart was racing, his breathing quick. His friend still remembered him,
“Being a president is always tough, the job never comes easy. But he will be a good president, his supporters will be proud."
As the information continued to upload, Tony finally looked up at the glass box closely. There was frost on corners of the chamber. Small cracks scratched the surface. It looked painful, cold and lonely. Tony reached over to the glass and almost as if all the videos played simultaneously with volume on maximum in his head.
“Something happened at Stark Industries today. Nat and I were there looking through a few archives and suddenly there was an attack.” Steve was very particular in the information he was sharing. He didn’t need James to know that he was snooping around his best friends company and add another excuse to hate him more. “There was a metal man, almost resembling the one of Iron Patriot but darker. It was more silver and grey. With a lone star, almost like the communist symbol. I’m pushing it with the symbol but—"
Steve gave a curt nod, needing to trust that Tony knew what the armor could take. He grabbed Natasha and Clint, pulling them with him, down under the cover. He pulled up his shield, hovering it over all of their heads as best as he could. Above them, Tony threw himself over the grid to give them more protection—and he couldn’t have taken a second longer, because then, the room above them was encased in fire. Debris fell down on the ground, smoke filling the air.
“I loved you so much,” Tony said, and didn’t even cringe at the words, because with all of those memories settling in his head, it was the truest thing he had ever known.
“Maybe. Maybe not. Doesn’t matter,” Tony decided. “All that matters is that you’re back with me. And that we got our heads out of our asses a second time around. Jeez.”
The rest of the morning routine passed rather quickly, and they were fed and on their way to SI sooner than Steve had anticipated. He kept sending worried looks at Tony. The closer they got to the place, the more Tony fidgeted, and it was clear he was pretty nervous about the ordeal they were about to face. That was all the more reason they should go through with it, Steve thought, and reached over to put a soothing hand over Tony's thigh.
There was a heavy pause, Steve’s eyes shining with hurt. Immediately, the anger in Tony drained and he ran a hand through his messy hair.
Bucky released a low breath and ran the fingers of his metal hand through her red locks. They were so much shorter now than he was used to.
Staring at him, Steve let the words sink in. He could understand Tony wasn't exactly happy about the whole ordeal, but he honestly didn't expect a total rejection. He swallowed once, then looked down at the ring in his palm. It was a titanium alloy recommended by FRIDAY, a simple, smoothed out band. Steve had figured Tony wouldn't want anything more sophisticated to get in the way of his work. And now it was rendered useless.
Steve sighed heavily, and Tony realized that he too had expected—and probably dreaded—those words all along. Tony found he still often underestimated the level of Steve’s empathy. “You got out for a good reason, Sam,” Steve said quietly. “I didn’t come here to bring you into this mess.”
“Captain?” Tony asked again, reminding Steve that he’d been staring for long moments. With a swift movement Tony pulled the sunglasses off his nose. The torn currents of his brown eyes burrowed into Steve’s with intensity that knocked the wind out of him.
There was silence on the comm lines, and Steve frowned as he changed to their private line with a tap to his earbud. “Tony?”
, which was a small miracle in and of itself. Steve was so full of happiness he thought he might burst. He pressed his forehead to Tony's and closed his eyes, breathing slowly.
Tony guessed he was right. The world had come undone around them, swallowing friends and foes alike. Tony had stopped taking note of the body count at some point.
, he really was about to lose it. Rhodey was pulling him near, bracing his head on his chest, and Tony concentrated really hard on the steady beating of Rhodey’s heart so he wouldn’t lose his damn mind completely and veer off right into a panic attack.
Ian’s screaming-fit at bedtime and the way he had thrown his milk bottle at Steve’s chest, thus spilling half its content over his shirt clearly proved him wrong, but apart from those very real moments, Tony felt as though he lived in a haze.
He could see the gears in Steve’s head turning. “In Sokovia,” he concluded, looking at Tony in question. “You arrived here the day before we went to Sokovia, didn’t you?”
“Say ‘hello’ to everyone, Ian,” Tony told the baby, turning around so everyone could see their son’s face. “Fatherly advice number eighty-seven: Memorize their faces, and don’t listen to a word those people say, they’re all completely nuts.”
“It goes deep into my body,” Tony explained. “There’s scars, and it’s not pretty. It’s kinda one of the reasons I’m part of the Avengers.”
“And you got yourself a whole new family, while I was away.” He resumed pacing around the bedroom and came to a stop in front of a row of picture frames. He took up one of them, and Steve didn’t have to look to know that it was one of their wedding photos. “And a husband.”
“Taking it one step at a time.” Tony reached out and stroked Steve’s palm. “Well, your next step is getting through today.”
to contain his joy that Rhodey might have decided to become a full-out Avenger, but he probably wasn’t doing a very good job.
But Tony merely kept swallowing. He swallowed, even as Steve spilled himself into his throat while saying his name like a prayer.
So much had happened in the past century: The redefinition of racism; concentration camps for Asians and Jews, genocides in countries so far away that no one cared about. Scientists discovering how little it would take to rip the world apart. He’d seen walls going up and coming down and bore witness to unimaginable human slaughter.
He was alive, somewhere, and they’d get him back, and then, maybe, they could start forming the friendship their future selves seemed to have, no matter how strange the thought was.
Tony huffed. “You’re a stubborn one, hm? Fine with me.” He cast him a crooked grin. “I think I like some spunk in you. You know… both figuratively and literally.”
“Do you remember,” Tony said, and there were so many bruises grazing his face that he could only glimpse at Bucky through one eye, “how… how it
“Helen,” Steve called, squatting down in front of her. The thick smell of blood was tickling his nose. Her wounds were severe—it wasn’t hard to see that. Some sort of burn that had to be from Ultron’s repulsors himself and that had left a deep wound all across her torso.
Steve’s attention was briefly drawn back to the openness of their surroundings. While no one did anything more than cast glances in their direction, he could tell Tony felt on display. He did a bit, himself. And yet, this was too important to give in to discomfort right now.
“Hey Steve,” Tony called, his robotic voice layered with a hollow echo as the words bounced off the stone walls. The room was small, then. Tony sighed and pulled off his helmet, before leaning his head against the dusty brick wall he was sitting up against.
Gamora was yelling something as Nebula took the Gauntlet off of Thanos’ lifeless hand. Her boyfriend, or whatever they were to each other—Peter Quill—and her entire team all had to hold her back, so she wouldn’t step in the way.
As soon as the words had left his lips, Barnes set into motion, walking across the room in quick, even strides. Tony looked after him for a moment, before he glanced back up at Steve, wholly confused.
So eventually, he had cracked, and found himself casually mentioning kids, well, making jokes about it mostly. About which one of them would probably fuck it up more: the guy who flew nukes into alien wormholes, or the soldier whose favorite pastime was to throw choppers around.
“They do?” Tony asked, trying to mimic Steve’s casual tone and failing miserably. “What are the odds, I think with your CV you might be just right for the job, huh?”
“We didn’t break up,” Tony explained, at least, he didn’t think so. With the way he’d treated Steve in that cave, he might see that differently. “We just… Sometimes life takes it all away from you, and you gotta fight to get it back, you know? If you plan to make this superhero gig a habit, you’ll have to accept that. Cap and I did.”
And maybe it was for that reason, that instead of asking Tony what the hell he was talking about, he simply cupped Tony’s cheek, and kissed him softly.
Well, it was probably also really bad because Obi’d be throwing a fit about this, likely trying to sue Steve’s ass, but alas… together, they’d deal with it.
“That’s nice,” Bruce said to Tony as he stepped out of the elevator. He was looking at their teammates, too, a small smile on his face. “Strange, but nice.”
Steve knew he’d probably given Tony a few slightly-too-long glances yesterday, and his behavior hadn’t been all that platonic-friendly, but yesterday, that hadn’t meant anything. Steve could have made a joke about it and everything would’ve been clear. Now, it
Steve’s feet picked up towards the stairs and that’s when the computer blinked it’s last second and the entire building began to crash.
"You promised me that I would never be found out if I gave you Tony's design. The reason you are even using that metal suit is because of me. And this is how you repay me, you little shit." Stane threw the photo at Skull. Catching it with both hands, Skull studied the photo. There was a reason why Joseph took a close up of the words, there was no way knowing which file these words were in especially things had been blackened.
“We didn’t realize you needed more help than what was already given to you.” Pierce rolled his eyes and rested his mouth on the back of his fingers.
After everything that happened, they’d assume the world would be burning but nothing moved. Even the leaves on the trees didn’t dare to move.
What did you think! I definitely want to try to add some more Bucky and Sam in this. Even more Natasha and hopefully the other Avengers.
“Yeah.” It was a silent agreement. Steve knows how uncomfortable James gets with himself and even though he’s never spoke about it James still blames him. Blames him for not being able to be quick enough to bring his best friend back. Blames him for not being able to find anything of his best friend. They can talk about anything, just not Tony.
Steve blinked at his screen, trying to take in all the information. His mind was building up a scream and his eyes were starting to hurt and his ears were burning up. There were so many voices, so many orders, so much development, so much control. His friend looked so alone.
Rhodey still managed to keep his step light, after everything, never losing his training. He knew about them and how they were growing together and spending time together. He understood how they built each other up and supported each other since they both down respectively. They had shared their quiet moments, where they sat in each other’s presence, gaining comfort and realizing what it meant for them to have each other. Rhodey knew about that stolen moment in Tony’s R&D where Tony and her stood so close to each other they could have felt each other’s breath. Looking at the newspaper, Rhodey squeezed her shoulder.
Steve kept walking towards Tony, hands still raised up high. He was so close in saving him, and bringing him home. They were finally going to have that drinking challenge.
Tony’s face stared at Steve as the recording stopped. His eyes burning red, his veins popping, his hair sticking up. Steve’s never seen that much anger in Tony’s eyes, he’s always been calm, nothing made him react like that. This was never supposed to be. This was never supposed to be Tony.
"We put a small bug in the Blair House and we would know everything that he is currently doing. At least we'd be up to speed to all his ideas and be ready to act before he does."
They were so close when a loud clank and roll surrounded the room. And everything happened so fast. Steve was pushed out of the way, back towards the entrance when the blast erupted in the room.
Also I hope you enjoyed reading the chapter and finally getting some background on Tony and his past perspective. Let know what you think and thank you so much so continuously supporting this!
“Buck, your arm is like a second sun. Why do you gotta do this?” Steve groaned, covering his eyes while taking a seat on the high chair.
“How could we ever get close to the glove, let alone Thanos?” Natasha spoke up, still gripping the necklace in her hand.
The two glanced at each other then scanning the room for any exits. No windows and only one door. The door facing a different sound and that was obviously making its way toward them.
Nick Fury sat with his back stiff, hands flipping through pages. He looked deep in concentration but the moment the boys walked into the room he made sure to give them a once over. Joseph Rogers sat at the head of the table already rummaging what looked like confidential papers with his eyebrows bunched together. He didn’t look impressed. Same with his mother who was also doing the same thing with a different file.
Ever since Steve saw the videos he has been completely quiet. He's been in his office posting his wall with information that could somehow lead him to Tony. Steve knew, with evidence that his friend was alive and waiting to be saved.
"I don't think I would be wrong in assuming that Steve is probably the closest to what he has to family. But that's a different argument. And you may be right in that you know what he wanted to do with this company but either way, I hope you are careful in who you deal with when it comes to weapons. Dealing weapons with the wrong people does not help in making friends."
“Why were you at Stark Industries during the blast?” His mom’s hand stopped mid to mouth as she stared at her son. Of course everyone knows about the blast. Of course his dad knew he was there.
Sighing, Joseph closed the file and picked up another reading 2006 with a sharpie marker. Most files had been titled with computerized fonts and lettering—unlike this one. It was as if someone forgot it in the pile of files. Files that no one thought that any one would look through. With it folded in corners and almost scrunched up, the file had a different colour and it felt misplaced.
“Whatever happened two years happened, we need to move away from that and focus on fixing the wrong.”
Her ears rang, her eyes stung, and her body backtracked through the room and out the doors. Thanos may have hand ripped through whatever was left of the team to get to Vision but they still weren’t together. There was no belief in them being together, it was only a necessity. They had no real plan. Even with Ultron, they had an idea on how to design themselves.
“Because we had affectively closed down that facility after the incident. And, we had wasted our resources when we followed a hunch there before and found there."
Names were shortened and dates were left ambiguous. Joseph kept a separate log of the initials that may turn out to be names and kept a list close by of every person currently employed with the white house. Several scratches cut through numerous names and he could feel them laughing at him because he still had no idea what he was really looking for.
As the TV kept flashing every happy, teary cry of joy from the supporters, it also remembered to present the world with every heartbroken supporter for the opposing party. People had tears in their eyes, rooms that were once filled to the maximum with people lay empty and some sat on the floor looking like everything they believed in was taken from them.
Taking support from the wall, she picked herself up and paced towards the dining table where only two days ago, she and Tony sat having breakfast. She needed the newspaper. One hand gripping the old photograph, she searched the table. Files scattered across the surface along with coffee mugs and Tony’s smoothie glasses.
“Steve! Get over here,” Steve shot his head towards the voice, ignoring every other word the reporter had to say. Sam stood beside his father with an arm wrapped around him.
“Either excuse works, I’m happy to leave.” Natasha stacked out the Chinese take out food out of it’s bag while placing two beer bottles next to it.
“I am. But why Stark Industries? I can give you all the information you need from them, you don’t need to waste your resources infiltrating anything."
Strucker’s voice kept repeating in Joseph’s head. There was something about his tone that was almost threatening, warning him to keep away from the secrets. Joseph was on a mission to uncover every bit of information that was blacked out and unavailable to him. He needed to know what kind of office he was going into. He needed to understand the past, of what truly happened that resulted in the public demanding a new election early.
“We’ll give you some space.” With that, the girls marched their way outside the room, slowly shutting the door behind them.
Joseph only knew the surface about the man he was replacing. No other file had been blacked out so heavily. Nothing made sense, there was no need for secrecy, there shouldn’t be a need for secrecy. Personal information was covered, different policies were hidden. Specific things were kept away from him. Joseph dialled a number and spoke through.
“Nat, when the machine is switching hands, I’m running towards it. You make your way down.” Steve started to position the shield properly on his wrist and his feet getting ready to jump towards the giant machine. There was a lag in the arc reactors, every ten seconds, the reactors need to load up.
“We can still do something.” Steve’s voice broke through the silence as his voice hung over the heads of the rest of the team.
Blair House was absolutely enormous. The conference room alone was majestic. The seats equally spaced apart and the decor screamed of poise and beauty. The windows allowed the perfect amount of sunlight and kept all the traffic sounds outside. It was in complete privacy.
“They were experiments. People were in those chambers, frozen in time and they tried to revive them. But none of them worked properly. Either they would never wake up, frozen too much, or they would wake up but without proper movements. No matter what, they all failed."
“It’ll heal, I just wasn’t expecting that I’d have to fight a giant machine while trying to extract information."
“This tech is slower than what they usually have, it’s going to take some time!” Tony was scrambling at the keyboard, trying to do anything possible to make the upload faster but also trying to lessen the amount of minions fighting Steve.
Dinner was quiet. Which is always an inclination that there is a debate in the making, both sides trying to come up with its defences and until they were ready no one would speak up. Sarah was her chipper self.
“Not us, Rhodey. We were supposed to be a team. We were supposed to stick together. The world depended on the avengers. Not on half of a team.” The rest of the team looked up, their eyes jumping from one another. It wasn’t like none of them didn’t think about it but they weren’t ready to admit it.
“Because there doesn’t seem to be enough people we can trust. The presidency has not changed for a long time, its been the same part different leaders and in all that time, what do you think they have done on the inside. Finally, we are seeing different colours and the opposition is not happy. They are losing their power but they may have suspected this. So for the time being, we do not know how much they’ve prepared for this situation or who is really on our side."
“If you get blown up, I swear I will never forgive you,” Steve gave him a half smile and ran towards the sound echoing in the halls as Sam made his way the other way. Steve knew this was a death wish. But just what if it could be the answer he’s been looking for. Someone may give him some answers he’s been searching for. The sound was getting closer to him and it was large. Steve’s breath heightened as he slowed down towards a turn. A large blast ripped through the corner as Steve got shoved back.
“I am.” Tony whispered as he placed a kiss on her shoulder and began to look around him. His eyes were tired when he saw whatever was left of the team. Rhodey stood close to her, letting them have their moment. His eyes caught Steve standing by himself. No Sam. No Sergeant Barnes. No King T’Challa. No Vision. No Wanda. Tony knew. Tony looked at his hands and a shiver went through his spine.
“Pierce, this was supposed to be an easy win. We already had them in our hands.” Another voice spoke to him.
Every part of the girls and Steve's body ached ever since they saw Tony. Nothing seemed okay anymore.
“Of course. But Steve remember, John F. Kennedy was also a good president but he never finished his presidency.” Steve stared at Pierce. His mouth opened and closed and opened and closed again. Steve wanted to say something but the entire assassination of JFK played in his head. His mind filling through various information, trying to understand Pierce’s words. Steve tried to read between the lines and he only keep up with one conclusion.
“Currently, Alexander Pierce, the opposition to Joseph Rogers is nowhere to be found. We can only assume that after Rogers' election win speech will we finally catch a glimpse of him speaking to his supporters. Even though today was his loss, we are sure that the people who supported Pierce to the end would love to hear a few words from him. Throughout the entire campaign Pierce had—“
“Other than give us crippling debt.” Joseph piped in. Soft snickers went around the table. It was a serious topic to discuss. The country was going into debt and there was no proper solution to it but undermining the president was always a comic relief.
Steve watched his parents as they spoke to different people while getting pats on the back. His dad hadn’t even sat on the seat yet, nor had he been sworn in but people already looked lighter—as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulder. Weight of uncertainty about the future.
“Tony, open your eyes, look at me.” Her voice loud, afraid. Between his blinks, he takes in a glimpse of her as his eyes close and everything around him goes dark. The last thing to reach him was her voice screaming his name.
There were only a few missions that Steve has flown with James as of late. And he’s only seen the machine only a couple of times. Everyone’s always in awe of it, with its high technology and advanced weapons. It’s almost like second skin on James.
“FRIDAY hasn’t been able to track the exact coordinates, nor does she knew exactly when the message was sent. But we do know his suit is…or was depleting.”
Bruce stared at his hands. What if the Hulk came out? The Hulk had come out before but he wasn’t able to land a proper hit on Thanos; what it have made a difference again? Could his loss of control over the big green man have cost them Vision?
“The encryption is harder than it seems. This file is locked really tight, Stane definitely did not want anyone to see this.” Natasha kept typing. Steve stood by her side, his eyes running back and forth between the door and the computer screen.
“Stay safe kids.” With that, Pierce waved them a hand and walked out, leaving a sky full of clouds behind him.
The entire thing looked like a discontinued experiment, but then why was the computer still on? Why did the building still feel like it held a presence? Who were those lights for? Steve walked over to the screen of the computer, reading the present information.
A bang. It echoed from the walls and lingered in his ears. There wasn’t anything else in his ears and that worried him. He needed the chatter from Tony’s side. His constant complaining and quirks. This was too quiet.
“I’m proud of you, dad,” Steve spoke to his dad as the room quieted down. His face was plastered with a wide smile while his hands held his dad by the shoulders. It was a hard fight with the numbers constantly changing back and forth in his favour and against. But Steve knew—call him biased—that his father would win.
Majority of the room was dark, except of the centre—where Tony was currently standing—was brightly lit. It was laughable almost at how obvious the entire set up was. The large computer in the centre stood connected to a giant glass holding cell. HYDRA was doing something.
“He’ll be fine, he’s a big boy,” Natasha continued with a full mouth, “that’s what his shield is for."
No one knew if it was the specks of dusts they were trekking inside, or if it were just mud and no one had the heart to ask the person beside them. M’Baku had stared at Steve blankly, trying to keep up the persona of a general of an army, they did not exchange parting words before Steve walked into the jet and Natasha flew them away. M’Baku knew that if he were to try to speak up, his eyes would well up and his voice would break and he would fall to his knees yelling to the world and anyone who would listen to give his people back to him. He and Okoye had shared glances and her glazed eyes reminded him that he may be the only one left to take the throne.
The armour was built specially for him by Tony Stark for his military missions and he was proud of showing it to everyone. Not just because his best friend created it but because it was something that proved Tony’s intelligence. It showed that he was not just some business man helping with military. He was a man who believed in advanced mechanics and new creations. It was incredible. James proudly dawned the mark of Stark Industries.
Steve stood by the door, keeping his eyes out, ready for anything to strike. Natasha’s fingers typed fast, she knew if there is anything remotely related to HYDRA it would be buried deep. Under unmarked folders, suspiciously marked.
But that was when James Rhodes was still a board member for the Stark Industries. Almost a year after Tony’s disappearance, James was let off or he left. Because now there are less missions with James and less sightings of the metal man known as the Iron Patriot.
“I lost hope a long time ago, Captain.” She could see Steve’s face flinch away. Captain was impersonal for them. They were no longer the same people two years ago—she didn’t want to be the same person to him.
“I understand. All the information is easily accessed by you, but they have secrets. Saying you’re a friend of Tony Stark will only gain the same amount of information as he would get. Yesterday, Obadiah Stane and Alexander Pierce met up and Pierce had become director.” Steve stared at Nick. Pierce knew nothing about Stark Industries, he wasn’t even closely related to the company. There was no connection between Stane or Pierce either. “It’s HYDRA."
The ship inched closer and Rocket saw areas of damage—more damages than the last time he saw it. No one had lowered the weapons as the ship came to a hover and began to descent near them, almost missing the trees. No one came out of the ship, it was as if it was taking a breathe. Rocket ran over to the door, he had just began to type in the ship code—a silly earth song name—when the door opened.
The boys filled into the seats facing Nick and he finally closed his file and looked up at them. Steve’s mom rubbed her son’s arm and turned her attention to the speaker.
“I will kill him as many times as I need to.” Thor’s voice was rough. He was disappointed in himself. His people expected him to enact the revenge. He owed it to Heimdall. He owed it to Asgard. He owed it to Loki.
The two politely placed their glasses down and quietly made their way outside nodding happily at anyone who noticed them. It wasn’t quiet outside. Someone somewhere seemed to be celebrating. But while everything seemed bright and loud, a small corner near the campaign headquarters stood dark and full of secrets.
“I think it might be time to ditch this back-up plan E and find a plan F. The neighbour thought he recognized me.” Anna said walking in with take out food and placing it on the table in front of Natasha. Natasha gave her a smug look and placed her laptop beside the food.
“They came to me. When that Rogers kid lose the brain child behind all this we were near ruins. First, the kid tried to help and he still does—but then about three months later, came HYDRA. They needed weapons and that’s what we’re—I’m best at.” He looked proud. HYDRA came to him and not the other way around. Not a lot of members can say that.
Strucker made it clear that he saw the files personally and reviewed the information that could be visible to the next president. No one expected Rogers to take the lead and start investigating but Stane knew there was no way he was going to drop this.
"That's what I'm here to figure out." Obadiah stared at Joseph for a couple of seconds and finally took his place on the seat and Joseph followed. There was a menacing silence between them and Stan tried to fiddle with his pen to try to create some noise.
“Died. Yes, I was not able to save him and that metal machine killed him. In front of me.” There was silence in the room. Steve knew James was on the vice president’s security detail and he also knows that James is one of the best men at his job. He only ever heard rumours of what was able to defeat the iron patriot but never believed them. But there truly is a machine that is much more advanced and powerful.
The TV kept screaming with the cheers of countless supporters while a silence swept through the room. Papers laid scattered around the table with phones buried under them. Alexander Pierce stayed seated in the office chair with a arm swung around the top. His tie sat loose and pulled to the side while his collar lay uneven on his coat.
There was a man, a man whose beard had grown out and hair fluffed out at the wrong places. A man who had been missing for the last ten years. The girls sat there, forgetting about their food, their possible real estate move and letting their beer get stale, with the knowledge of the secret that Steve was searching for. The picture was fuzzy and blurry from so many places but they knew.
“Steve, honey.” Sarah entered the room, bringing the light into the darkness. A soft touch stayed on Steve’s shoulder making him realize of his hands were covering his face.
“Last time I was here, there were no working bulbs, but this time the halls are lit up.” Steve turned the corner, skipping the hallway and going straight to the end for the door and there it was. The large glass cell in the centre and a buzzing computer screen. It was just like Steve remembered, just how he saw it ten years ago.
I hope it was worth the wait. Are you liking all the characters? I don't know how fast or slow I am going to move the story yet. But I'd love to hear any and all of your thoughts!
Hands still in the air, he took a step closer to the spotlight, slowly closing the distance. As closer he got the further they seemed to go.
“Steven, I know you.” Steve sighed, turning his head towards the sandwich and its homemade bean patties and guacamole with the perfectly placed vegetables. It was right amount of crunchy.
Stane acted like a father to Tony ever since his parents died. That man has been with him the longest, he took care of him. He couldn’t have possibly sold out to HYDRA. Steve trusts him, Stane promised him that he would take good care of Tony’s company for him and he was the best person to do so. Stane has everything that he could possibly want, he would at least respect all the work Tony put into this. That’s what Steve thought. Its what he believes and he is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But Nick’s voice keep repeating in his head.
The room went up in a roar as everyone’s hands rose in the air to celebrate the results. Big letters spelling Rogers wins election with images of different locations flashed on the screen. There was confetti, cheers and tears. Hugs were being passed around in the room—everyone trying to pat the new president on the back for a strong win.
Alright, so writing this was a little tough because these kinds of scenes are definitely out of my comfort. I really hope that it makes sense while you were reading this.
“It will only get harder from now on. Not only are all the supporters are going to following every move of your father’s but also the ones against. It is a real risky business to be a part of."
“What is your problem?!” Steve stood up and turned towards to stare at her. His hands were in fists and his eyes a mixture of anger and exhaustion. They never had this conversation and they needed it—only they imagined to have this argument on a different day.
“We’re going in.” Natasha opened the door and treaded towards the computer. Stane’s office had a entire window behind him. He could see the world from beneath him. Natasha plugged in the USB and started typing away, clicking at folders trying to find a suspicious unmarked folder. “I’m going to try to make this quick."
“It is the way it is being accessed. Rather than typing in a password, an old encryption code is running to decrypt the entire file.”
Tony kept cursing himself and punched more keys to make speed up the process. Steve’s voice was getting louder in the earpiece, reminding him of how slow he was really going. Tony’s heartbeat sped up to the point it was threatening to burst out of his chest. Blood was rushing to his fingers to make them type faster, his ears started to burn.
And suddenly he was all alone. Steve didn’t know if he liked this better than when there was someone in the room. He could feel his heart beating, he could hear the rhythmic beating consume the entire room. His hands were cold and rubbing them together he finally opened the first video.
“I would but there is no slack to give him, he already has too much of it. It was a miracle that he was elected a second time and he’s still not given a lasting impression."
Tony and her had changed a few since then. She had caught Tony looking at a picture of the entire team and beside it the photo of her and Steve. His jaw was clenched and his arms crossed in front of his chest. The next day they printed new photos but kept the picture of the team turned upside down on the corner, behind a frame that now held a picture that Happy had taken of the three of them.
“Steve. You okay?” Sam’s voice entered his head and Steve realized that he had stopped walking as his eyes scanned the room. Sam was already in front of him with his eyes bunched together in worry.
Steve’s jaw stiffened and Natasha’s gaze moved towards the ground. Bruce knew something about what happened two years ago. He knew the name and he knew it pushed them apart but he still didn’t understand what really happened—or how bad it got.
“Tomorrow.” Steve said as he stared at the picture of the room in the compound. The room where he lost Tony.
Something was different this time. It was cleaner, things seemed to be in place or out of the way—the stairs were visible. There were dim lights this time, unlike the last time Steve came back. As usual Steve had come back there and as usual he found nothing.
At the same time, Steve was trying to the bomb that Tony used ten years ago but it seemed as if he left no written records around. And Steve knew that. Tony would draw something out and try to follow it to the letter yet the modifications he would forget to add in until after he’s actually used it. Steve needed to know if that bomb was strong enough to kill his friend.
“Hear what?” Steve quietly walked over to Sam, keeping his ears perked up for sounds, listening closely. And there it was. It was systematic, it was booming and wired. Like metal hitting the ground and it was getting louder. Then the computer screen beeped, presenting the two intruders with a timer on its screen with bright red numbers rapidly counting down.
As they continued eating and thinking new neighbourhoods to infiltrate the laptop worked through Natasha’s encryption for the files found on Obediah’s computer.
"After Tony's disapperance, this company has become much more focused on speficially it's weapons and started to pull further away from the military. Are you sure this is what Tony wanted?"
“Everyone is slowly leaving, the offices look empty. So far you’re good.” Natasha walked behind Steve as he led the way. They both dressed casually, nothing to arise suspicion and nodding at the employees leaving for the day. It was casual and discredit. All the needed to do was go into Stane’s office, plug in a USB and they’d be done.
In front of him, the computer flashed it’s existence and his eyes were trained on the letters and numbers. His mind was chewing away at different scenarios that could explain its existence and they were slowly getting worse.
“It was a SHIELD mission.” From the corner of his eye, Steve could see his mother’s face drop. No matter how long he’s been in the military or with SHIELD, her face got the same look. "The company is under surveillance. Something is not sitting right with Nick and we had to check it out. It was fine. I’m here.” He added the last bit for his mom.
"No no, I wouldn't ever hint such a thing. Plus that was Tony's thing, not really yours, right?" Stane stared at him, unblinking. Joseph knew what he was trying to do; everything about this visit was the rile him up and Stane's shoulders were starting to stiffen.
“Thanks.” Steve took a sip and nodded at his parents. “I am very proud. Politics never have been my strong suit but they already seem to have taken a 360. This is a good moment.”
The office was white floor to stop, everything mechanized. It was a little odd seeing patches of colour at various points in the office space. A small speck of green was visible on the receptionist's desk and it was the only thing providing some sort of support to Joseph.
Bucky and Sam had been sipping their coffee when Steve walked in the room. He still hadn’t changed while the two were ready to face the day head on. Bucky’s metal arm shone brightly in the sun bouncing right into Steve’s eyes.
Sweat trickled down his forehead as his breath tried to catch up. His heart was beating so fast, almost threatening to jump out of his chest. The room was silent. The glass chamber was towering and cold.  Demanding him to do something, to not just stare. Steve’s eyes scanned the area and there was Tony. His back pinned against Skull with a gun to his head.
"All I'm saying is that in all that information everything was easily blackened out, except," Joseph reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a photograph, "your initials."
Steve covered his face and let out a sigh in his hand. The one person he needed answers from, a reassurance from wasn’t even on the same planet.
“Only Nat and Bucky but we’re going to stay back this time. Last time when we all left, even at different times, Fury knew something was up. We need to be more careful.” The boys nodded in unison as they stared at the folder. Every mission had always been either a dead end or missing information. They really needed this. For hope.
“Bullshit.” No one replied. This was supposed to be easy. Pierce taking over for Daniel was supposed to be an easy transition. But no matter how much they tried to influence Rogers, it just became harder.
great it had felt to be so close to Steve. And now that Steve’s arms were closing in around him, making Tony feel appreciated and safe and a lot of other stuff he hadn’t felt in ages… and sure, also unsurprisingly aroused, Tony decided to damn everything to hell and just go for it.
He pumped into him a couple of times, back and forth, and Tony tried spreading his thighs further apart, his trembling calves battling his jeans until they were around his knees. “Come on,” he whispered hoarsely. Demandingly. “Just do it now.”
And that expression right there—that stubborn look of fighting whatever memories might be rushing to the surface—that was all Bucky.
Tony reached out to touch Steve’s chest, feeling his heart beating strongly against his palm—desperate for that last connection. “I’ll hold you to that.”
Steve shot straight up in bed, staring at Tony, wild-eyed. “What? What’s wrong?” he asked, blinking at Tony as though he wasn’t quite sure who he was.
But Tony was having none of it. He pushed gently against Steve’s shoulders, holding him at a bit of a distance, eyeing his chest.
There was a flash of red in his eyes, before he squeezed them shut in a pleasure that bordered on pain and his lips parted on a groan that rasped harshly from his throat.
Tony squared his shoulders as he walked towards one of the empty couches, flopping down on it. Steve followed a second later, definitely sitting closer than strictly-platonic friends would do, so Tony guessed the cat really was out of the bag.
Steve chuckled, and turned his head sideways to look at Tony. “I can’t afford to punch you. Your dad could sue me for my whole college fund.”
Tony shrugged. He guessed by now they had seen and done too much to really despair over another warlord trying to wipe out the universe.
Slowly, he pulled on the finished suit, then stared at his reflection for a few dazed minutes. He barely recognized himself and silently wondered what Bucky would think of him now.
Together, they made their way into the living room, and handed out portions of cake and chocolate mousse glasses.
“Good thinking.” Tony’s thumb found the slit, and he smiled as Steve bucked against him. “Can’t believe you finally decided to listen to me on our
“I think she liked you,” Tony said, once they were alone, drawing Steve back to the present. He leaned against one of the workshop’s desks, studying Steve intently. “They all liked you. Even Dummy.”
Long minutes passed before Tony fought for some sliver of common sense. The rest of his resistance had fallen to the wayside, leaving his body boneless, and his heart soft.
Tony’s eyes flickered back to the paper. His smile got a little softer. “Maybe,” he admitted. “It’s… always been a thought at the back of my mind. To make something that’ll make people’s lives better and not, well… end them.”
That didn't sound promising at all. No person, and especially not a kid, should be pushed into a corner like this. "That’s your advice? Seriously?"
the sort of guy who buys ridiculous stuffed bunnies because thanks to a weird train of thought, I actually thought it was a good idea at the time, and I will try to get it right, but—I won’t, not always, it’s just… the way I am.”
“Apparently I can’t walk away from this,” Tony breathed. He yanked Steve’s shirt up a bit, until his naked chest was momentarily exposed to his hungry, conflicted eyes. “And we can’t…” he continued, fingers tracing a trail up his abdomen. “We can’t just pretend like this isn’t happening.”
“Don’t be mad. He just feared you’d be bored out of your mind before he returned home. I had the day off so… I asked Jarvis where to find you and he said you’d likely be in the workshop. When I didn’t find you there I tried the cliffs.”
Steve’s mouth opened in surprise, when he realized what Bucky was saying. He felt heat rising to his cheeks. “I’m not… I never even…” He sighed. “Am I that obvious?”
In the distance, thunder roared, and blasts of energy started to illuminate their surroundings. It was as if the sky was coming apart at its seams, as if it was cracking in the middle, taking the very essence of life with it.
Steve remembered it well. He’d been six, merely a small, sickly boy, but he remembered standing in front of the Empire State Building for the first time and feeling thoroughly insignificant. Standing there, knowing that something so great existed somewhere in the world. Something so… meaningful.
“Whatever you’ve said to him on those conventions probably hasn’t sold very well in the long run, Stark,” Bucky said on the comm-lines, making Tony huff in return.
Steve’s eyes were glimmering with amusement and Tony really thought he should be concerned about Steve’s lack of discomfort, but for some reason—he wasn’t.
He watched in horror as Agent Barton led Tony towards the exit of the room. Their gazes met once more, and it was almost like Steve could see his spirit break. As if the warmth he’d treasured so much in the last days faded into nothingness.
“We both know it’s about Wanda. And I can’t do shit about that.” He resumed eating, commenting between mouthfuls: “He’s lovesick, but he’s not five and he can handle it.”
“Well, and to punch those people,” Tony continued just as Steve threw his shield at the guy. Then, he held him up by his uniform. By the look on his face, Steve would be all too happy to throttle the poor bastard, but eventually, he just pulled him down to whisper in his ear, “Now would be a good time for you to run.” He let him go with a shove.
"Can't say that it is," Steve answered a little stiffly. He wasn't pleased with the revisiting of the sex-pollen idea. It hadn't been particularly funny the first time around. "I just hope there's no long lasting effects. Thor, if you recall anything, let us know, okay?"
“It’s so weird how you run into people at the airport,” Tony called over to them, because he had to say
That said, he pulled at his underwear, stepped out of it and—and threw it on top of the tank top already lying on the floor.
Sokovia. It kept coming back to bite him in the ass. But then again, it would’ve been naive to think he could just go on with his life after destroying a whole city. After thousands of people had lost their home. After so many had become widows, widowers, orphans, had lost their brothers or sisters, had lost whatever they’d held dear in life.
Bruce hummed, unconvinced. “I’ll see if I can get JARVIS back online,” he said, sighing deeply as he shuffled out of the room. Before he left, he put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, petting him twice in consolation.
As Steve rushed to Tony’s side and took it up with two of the soldiers at once, Bucky faced off with the dark-haired man—the one who’d attacked Steve first.
Steve was in no hurry to get either of them off. He was enjoying the moment. Tony's warmth, his slightly sweaty skin, the smell of lube and latex and sex, and the sound of Tony's voice as he moved in a steady, slow pace, all contributed to this sense of rightness that Steve was feeling. The hand at Tony's stomach moved to allow his fingers to trace along Tony's dick.
Now, though, the man in front of him was as temptingly perfect as Steve could’ve ever imagined. And the more time passed, the more he yearned to keep him for always.
to hook up with stuck up art profs. He got laid plenty, that’s what campus parties were for, after all. No one cared about his age there, and that was exactly how Tony wanted things to be.
Considering their mutual history, it shouldn’t be a big surprise. However, when it had become clear that the team would assemble again, Tony had asked Rhodey to simply let it rest—to not say anything to Barnes about murdering his parents, to simply treat him like you would treat a business colleague. Polite, respectful—indifferent.
“I can imagine.” Pepper sighed, and her big green eyes suddenly became plaintive, looking at him. “Does he even know what you’re doing here? I’ve seen your schedule. You must be exhausted.”
"Come on, let’s see if we can..." Bucky just started saying, paused, looking at Steve, then following his gaze, which was still fixed on Tony. A beat of silence passed. "So that's—"
“Steve,” Tony said, putting both hands on Steve’s face to keep eye contact when Steve was about to drop his gaze. “You wouldn’t let me do this. You wouldn’t let me become this… monster. I know you. You’re a good man at heart, the best man I’ve ever known. If you had to, you’d do the right thing. Wanda Maximoff doesn’t know you one bit. She’s messing with all of us.” He tried for a smile, which Steve returned, however fleeting it was.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted. He sighed. “But it’ll heal, and it was worth it. I couldn’t… I couldn’t let him hurt you.”
“Nothing will happen,” Steve said. “And I’ll go with you, end of discussion. I’m still your team leader, after all.”
“He brought back Vision, even after Wanda was able to k…” Bruce took in a breath, “even after Wanda managed to keep the stone away. The Doctor, Doctor Strange, spoke about a Time Stone and I can only assume that is what Thanos used."
“And without my shield, that ain’t happening. We’ll use the window at the next floor, come on.” Sam ran towards the stairs they had come down from. Steve also glancing once at the corner saw something. Something that was going to walk though his mind the entire ride home. It was large. And metallic. It was grey.
“Right. Either way, it doesn’t seem completely out of suspicion. Especially since, things seem to be heating up. Our intel has been going through the roof, as if HYDRA has started to plan something big. It wouldn’t hurt to check this out.” Anna pointed at the folder.
“Just give me the entire pot, I need to drown in it.” Steve gulped the cup. “Fury needs to ‘chat’.” They all knew what Fury needed to chat about and they had a good idea about how it was going to go. Both men demanding answers but not offering any.
"Joseph already suspects everyone in this room. He proved that with Stane." Skull was considering the idea. It's not like they haven't bugged someone's house before. The only problem was this time, all of this had to be done by the four present in the room, personally. There was no way Skull was letting any HYDRA agent handle this sensitive information.
“Not at all. It was only me.” Nick seemed pleased with the answer, maybe not entirely convinced but okay to move on.
“Tony?” She looked up at him and his face, under all that dried blood and those injuries, had turned pale. His knees start to feel weak as he grips her tighter.
Obadiah had his sleeves folded, tie somewhere with where his coat had ended up. If he had hair, that would have probably sticking up in different directions considering the times he had run his hand on his head. Blueprints and files covered his desk and a coffee cup sat dangerously at the corner of the table.
A scream rang through the halls and his mind shut up and concentrated on that voice. He knew that voice. The scream yelled again and his feet picked up the speed, cut through corners, following the voice.
Today he was expecting someone. Not someone wanting to buy Stark weapons but someone with more membership clearance. He let the room stay dark with the exception of a couple of window behind him. The natural light hitting him from behind gave his entire look an edge. Something to fear.
"Lots of information. Files are still covering my entire office table. But majority of it is blackened."
It gave him the title of Captain America. It helped his best friend re-gain an arm he lost in battle. And it introduced him to the man who constantly needed to invent, Tony Stark. SHIELD held a very strong importance to Steve.
"We need to talk." Short and concise. An order. Obadiah's eyes finally left the design and looked up at the man standing in front of him. He meant business,
“I don’t know what happened.” Steve started and Nick’s expression never changed. “You know, I go back there sometimes for my own curiosity. And that’s what I did last week but as I was nearing the main room an explosion ran through and I was thrown back.” Still no change.
"No, you watch it, Schmidt." Stane's finger pointed Skull straight in his face. No one ever uses Schmidt in the building, everyone knows his name but never braved to say it. Skull only uses it when he's out making business deals and making the HYDRA plans come to life. He hated it. And Stane knew it.
The pen sat somewhere, the highlighter was slowly losing its ink without its cap and timelines were spread across the table. There were secrets everywhere, starting from the moment Strucker bravely stood up as president after the current one was assassinated. He seems like the perfect man, the real best example for all the people.
“Either way, man, you’re going to be late. The security meeting is happening in an hour and your hair is still having a party. Get your ass dressed.” Sam put the coffee pot beside Steve as he rolled his eyes.
"You think, Strucker? How many other times did you use my initials?" Stane stared at Strucker as his smirk died into a worry. OS was used rigorously after the design was found.
“Honey, you realize people are going to be talking about you the same way we are talking about Strucker."
“Is everything okay?” Steve nodded at the papers and his fathers hands automatically closed the file and placed a firm hold on top.
“Position in place.” Sam’s voice entered his ear piece. Clearing his head, Steve continued up the stairs.
“Sounds fair.” Steve watched as Natasha attached the drive to the computer and the screen came to life. A folder opened to numerous files stored safely. They were all numbered with a specific order. Steve moved his eyes towards the girls, urging them to continue.
Secrets were buried in deep and so far Joseph knew that not one person truly really knew the entire situation. The higher he got on the job cycle the more he was being told but it wasn’t enough. Calling Strucker first might have been the wrong choice. Of course, Strucker knows everything but doesn’t want to share, this is all part of his presidency.
“Morning, Fury.” Steve walked into the office. Nick sat in the far corner near the windows. He wouldn’t admit it but he likes the view and not because it makes him feel powerful. Nick enjoys the sun—it calms him. He enjoys seeing the morning rush that seems so normal compared to his everyday. He likes seeing the world go around, knowing that he is helping them in some way.
The screen buzzed with information, numbers flashed up with images and equations. There were videos that popped up that flickered images of experiments in the glass chamber. Each scene was violent and loud. And painful.
“Sir, the crowd is waiting for you.” the organizer reminded him. Joseph takes in a deep breath as Sarah  helped him slip into his coat. Everything seemed to spin around him, he was cloud nine at this moment and he didn’t know if he could even come up with any coherent sentences to speak the crowd outside. They were waiting for him to wow them again. To inspire them and speak candidly.
“I’m sorry to interrupt but a ship from outer space has just entered the atmosphere.” Friday announced to the room. Everyone grabbed whatever they had of their weapons and rushed outside. Thor gripped his Strombreaker as he stood in front of his team.
“You think I CARE?!” The Founder faced Pierce, his face burning red almost as if it was ready to pop.
“Zola are you feeling sorry for him?” His face had gotten red, Pierce never thought it was possible that rumours could ever be true.
“Of course you didn’t have enough people in your ‘hands’. The results after the last three elections pushed the people so much they needed a change. And anyways, you were supposed to take care of the opposition.”
"After all that, alive might not necessarily be the best choice." Nick's eye moving from Maria to Anna.
lingered on his lips as the dream played itself back in his head. Like always, the same dream, the same ending, everything the same. He ran his head through his hair, keeping it out from his eyes. That look in Tony’s eyes before the blast always keeps coming up, mocking him that he was never able to save him.
“Alexander Pierce, the loser.” Pierce rolled his eyes, as if he wasn’t getting enough of it from the Founder. “Welcome to Stark Industries."
“And that’s why the Founder think you belong back in Research and Development.” The entire light was drained out of Obadiah’s face. Pierce was right, no one was going to be sitting as Obadiah jumped out of his seat.
Steve’s feet lightly treaded across the dark hallway. His breath panted, still trying to keep up from the fight and his hands flailed around him. Tony was here somewhere, he was bound to be.
She didn’t sit next to Steve. She didn’t sit next to the team. The floor seemed more comforting as she leaned her back to the wall beside the shelves she and Steve helped build. The entire compound had felt empty and impersonal. They had taken upon themselves to liven up the area, to give it a more avengers team feeling. Throughout the years they had spent together, their phones and Tony’s bots had captured enough moments for them to fill countless albums. Steve printed the photos. She bought the frames. They placed every single image meticulously and Tony wasn’t ready to admit it but that wall meant more to him than anything else in that entire compound.
Please let me know what you thought about it and if you have any advice! I would love to hear what you think!
Sarah's voice engulfed Joseph's head and his back automatically straightened and his stride echoed confidence and a roar began building in his throat.
Until the last page came into sight. It was folded and tucked nicely close to the crease, almost forgotten. Inside the folded sheet had a date circled—September 3rd 2006. The date of the assassination of President Chester Phillips. Beside it said
The after party was buzzing with supporters and volunteers walking around congratulating each other. Everyone held a glass of champagne in their hands with pride that better things were coming. Joseph stood proudly next to his wife taking pictures with everyone.
“Don’t try to undermine me. I need to see the Founder.” Pierce stood up but the woman stood in front of him. “Agent, move."
“The man I met when I entered Earth, the Doctor, he had a Time Stone, if we managed to take that back—“
“At first the videos are fuzzy. But they progressively become clearer and longer. And after watching a good amount,  we can say that it’s…” she looked at Anna who took in a breath. Steve’s gaze following.
“TONY!” Steve’s voice pulled Tony back from the drowning voices. He pulled back gasping, finally realizing he had been holding his breath.
“Some locals said they thought large cargo trucks driving into the compound and others said they saw a large metal man. When we got there, it was empty."
The computer kept its continuous sound beeping periodically through the speaker. The clock ticked away. Tony hated that clock, Tony liked the silence. He had said it reminded him of how much his brain was buzzing.
“We needed to know why SHIELD wanted this so badly. And why Stark Industries was willing to tear down their building to stop us from getting it."
“What was I even think?” Joseph whispered to himself as he filed through the blackened papers. It was too good to be true. This one was messier than the others, more hurried and ill-planned—half letters were seen through the thick black lines, and scribbles covered the pages. As the other files proved to him, there was nothing useful in this file either, no matter how tempting it looked.
I'm back!! I've been away to a trip to the mountains and it was absolutely incredible but I had not been able to write or post. I hope this was worth the wait!
“Steve, it is incredible that you are spending so much time looking for your friend. It is commendable. But son, it’s been ten years. So much happens in the ten years and at a time even hope seems impractical. Sarah, tell him."
“You look like a proud parent staring up at his kids.” Sam walked over with two glasses of champagne, passing one to his friend.
"BULLSHIT. You made the decision for me! You decided on your own that it wasn’t worth me knowing, that I didn’t need to know, that I shouldn’t know. You don’t tell anyone anything unless they just happen to with you. You told Nat about Bucky, because she was with you. You told Sam because he was with you. You decided for me. You didn’t give me a chance. You didn’t give me the facts. You didn’t give Tony the facts.” She was pointing her finger at him, using the hand that clutched their photograph. The team was always giving her strength and helping her find her power—her reason to still be a part of them. Her anger stemmed from them, from the time they were happy.
“Tony’s last update came from his suit 15 minutes ago.” She announced to them. Rhodey was the first one to look up.
“Ah, yeah. Sorry. I’m fine.” Steve lightly touched the corner of his shield, reassuring him it was still there and was ready to be used. Each time Steve made his way to the facility he was always hoping to find someone, some life just so he could fight them and demand answers.
“Honey.” said Sarah when his hands fell and his eyes stared at the ground and his tear ducts welling up. Steve couldn’t believe that he could produce a sound.
They watched a few more video logs after the initial one. The video quality had considerably gotten better and it had become exceptionally clear that it was Tony. And the first number dialled on their phone went straight to Steve. With their rushed tones and fast breaths, Steve invited them to the house for a face to face.
Pierce was quiet. The table was large. Different agents and members filled the chairs while Pierce stood at the end across from the big man, the Founder. It was a big secret reveal; this was what HYDRA had been hiding from him. The asset. He always knew it existed, there was a reason why the assassinations were so easy. They had a killer, they had trained a ruthless, emotionless killer and it was finally time for the big reveal. He was finally going to be in on the secret.
Tony's screams echoed in the entire room. It wasn't like this was the first time Anna had seen the videos and heard the screams. She knew what was coming but she still couldn't truly face that reality.
“You can joke all you want, you’re in my house, Stark. And I’ve waited really long for this.” Skull approached Tony as the latter reached for his gun.
"Tony is the next mission." The sound stopped and the Anna came back into her reality--standing near the door with her arms crossed at her chest mentally trying to make notes of the meeting. Nick turned to face everyone sitting at the table.
“Sir, I believe someone is trying to to access the Iron Soldier file on Stane’s server.” an agent spoke as she entered the Founder's office.
“With the damage that titan has done, we would need more than one stone back.” Thor interjected Bruce, “singularly the stones are strong but not strong as when they are when put together.”
“Sam, throw me my shield.” A screech started to build up and Steve grabbed Natasha’s hand and pulled her behind the large desk. And the computer was gone. The dust started to settle and there in front of them stood the same thing Steve saw almost a week ago. Metal in shape of a man. It was large, aerodynamic, and technological advanced. A large arc reactor shone brightly in their face. His arm was raised up towards them, aimed and ready to shoot.
happened?” Sam offered and Steve cleared his throat and turned the corner, leading the way. No matter how many he’s seen the place, it still sends chills down his spine as if someone is watching him.
“Steve.” The dark spoke as a person emerged. She was dressed in black leather blazer on top a white shirt with the casual slim jeans. Her sense of an casual outfit while carrying dangerous secrets. “Congratulations.” She pulled him in for a hug.
"Do you have any bright ideas about how to keep tabs on him? You can yell and turn red all you want, that isn't going to keep Rogers from doing what he wants."
“What do you mean? What about the nanotechnology?” Bruce’s hands formed into fists. He was done looking at them, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t still angry at himself.
“We can settle this in the best way. Just put down the gun and we’ll talk like grownups.” Skull smirked.  Expressions were filing away in Steve’s head. Skull already had something planned. Tony’s shoulders hunched up as Skull whispered something in his ear. Steve would always remember the look on Tony’s face—the horror that crowded his face.
The man in metal. The man with the fake heart. The genius boy wonder. He was supposed to be dead, ten years ago or mission in action. But here he was, kept under the Mad Zola’s control. Ready to comply.
“I was in a rush! All I knew was that I needed to jump, okay. There was a blast! You should be taking care of me."
“Boys be careful,” Steve’s earpiece said as Sam and him entered the dark, moon lit factory compound. Everything seemed the same, as if the ten years were a complete stand still inside. Steve knew he had the entire building mapped out in his head—this wasn’t his first time returning.
“Because we’re are the same as we were two years ago.” Rhodey had stiffened up as he fall his fall all over again in head.
The room was numb, the light from the curtains had escaped and Steve sat on the sofa with just the screen light burning in his eyes.
An overflowing crowd stood waiting for the new president and his speech. Ever since Joseph began to run for the presidency his speeches always struck hope and optimism in everyone’s heart. There was a way he spoke, the way he conveyed his future plans that made everyone positive about the future. He was a new hope.
“Why didn’t you use your wings, Sam?” Anna spoke up for Steve. A small smile stayed on his lips as Sam tried to defend himself.
“The explosion at the compound last week. I need answers Captain Rogers.” Nick was serious, he was grim. He didn’t like being left out of the loop.
"BULLSHIT ROGERS. You knew about his parents. You knew what happened and because you chose not to tell him, you had to pay for the consequences. What ever happened in that bunker was because you wouldn't open your mouth. Because you decided to make the decisions for everyone. Because you thought you knew better. But you know nothing. You think because your name is captain that you know what to do, who to make decisions for. You know nothing, you came out of a bottle, the only thing you know is how to take care of yourself! Tony learns, he’s learning, he’s amending his mistakes. But you’re a hypocrite. Telling him you’re leaving him the avengers. You left him with an AI and a cripple. But you…” With the photo still in her hand she reached over to grab handfuls of his shirt as she stared up to him. Steve’s hand gripped the chair near him as he looked down at the love of his life.
“I’ll try my best.” Nat rolled over behind a wall and Steve waited. Each time a new blast started, there was an entry point. Steve’s stance became stronger and the machine changed its hand from left to right and Steve charged towards it. His feet were swift and light helping him quickly gain on the machine.
“Where is—“ Rocket started as Nebula shook her head. She knelt down to put her hand on his shoulder.
“This is the video folder. There is a project Hydra has been working on for quite some time just not to our knowledge.” Natasha took a breathe and Anna continued.
Bucky’s disappearance, Wanda’s disintegration, and Groot’s good-bye played through her head. Every little cell was cranking its gears and working on creating a thought--an understanding of what had just played in front of everyone. The sun felt hotter, her suit stuck to her body tighter, her breath was uneven.
A loud bleep silenced their house hunting and they both placed their food down, completely forgetting about hunger.
SHIELD started working the military, helping train the cadets in sleuth and rigorous combat. That was how Steve met Nick Fury. Slowly, SHIELD branched away from the military, creating its own organization motivated in protecting the governments secrets and keeping the world in balance. SHIELD walked away from the base and Steve went along. The entire organization was the main factor in many of Steve’s relationships.
The video was fuzzy and hurried. It was too short to make out any specific details but as they slowed down each second, little pieces started to come together. There was a man struggling as pieces of armour were placed on him. His hands fighting to break lose. People dressed in long white coats started to scramble around the room with a little terror from the angry of the man. Finally breaking lose, screams filled the video as the man raced towards the camera using his hand blaster to wreak havoc around the room.
The moment Joseph walked out the door, Stane's hand threw the crumbled photograph behind him. He was promised that nothing would ever lead to him. Skull had made it clear that he would be left out of all the information that could ever be found.
"This Rogers is getting out of hand." Skull kept staring at the image as other information flashed before his eyes. All that information that could possibly link him to finding Tony, to knowing the reality of the iron soldier.
“I was not able to find any entries from the Boss after he was seen flying towards the saucer.” FRIDAY’s voice was barely a whisper, as if she knew she wasn’t helping.
“Sam, where’s Sam?” Rhodey’s eyes kept jumping bush to bush, teammate to teammate. Sam wasn’t too far from him when Thanos flicked them away from him.
The team hung their heads in silence. No one was moving but she could hear their minds producing names of people they wanted to check up in. Natasha’s eyes had gone towards the phone, back to the table then towards her necklace, and eventually closed. Her hands gripped the arrow that hung around her neck as her body refused to do anything else. Rhodey gripped his phone, trying to understand what he could say once he started moving through his contact list. Could he call his past trainees, his previous captains and generals? What would he say to them? What if they didn’t pick up, should he try different numbers? Rocket kept his fists closed—whatever he had of Groot he didn’t want to let go.
Under a thin manila file folder the New York Times sat comfortably. There was a thick coffee mug outline from her cup that morning. Different news articles were scattered throughout the page—some talking about the UN meeting with the Wakandian King T’Challa, another had an update about the Sokovia Accords, and something else about college funding.
“Don’t you ever leave without me ever again.” She cupped his face in her hands as he closed his eyes, appreciating her touch. He leaned down to her shoulder and pulled her in a hug, with his grip tight around her waist.
“You don’t owe anyone anything! You are constantly putting your life on the line and that is more than anything could ask for.” His dad fired back.
Steve’s voice spoke with speed and urgency. His panting echoed in the ear piece. There were two many people for his liking, especially for a mission like this. As if they were waiting for him. Plus it was too small a room to be fighting in; the entire situation was not going well. He switched his shield to his other arm to slam it in the henchman.
“Steve.” And there it was. It was the tone, it’s firm and strong almost gravely that Steve knew what was coming.
“YOU! You are my problem! The accords aren’t the reason we aren’t together! You changed everything and never realized what you’ve done. My problem is you never considered to communicate with me. You just automatically assumed that I wouldn’t believe you. We weren’t together because you couldn’t imagine trusting any one of us.” The entire room went silent and looked at Steve.
"How about we bug him?" Pierce annouced. His eyes were still stuck on his files as his hand crossed out another employee.
"I didn’t want you to have to choose.” Steve had inched closer to her, close enough to see Tony’s scribbles on the newspaper.
“What is it?” Rhodey spoke up. Ever since she had got up and started ruffling through the paper work on the table the entire team had their eyes on her. She was quiet and in her own world and focused on finding the recent remnants of Tony that she forgot anyone else was there.
“I told you to use the window on the second floor. Why wouldn’t you follow me?” Sam kept an ice pack on his elbow.
“No, no sir. Not sorry at all, he’s just an asset. But no matter how much mind control we gain over him, Tony Stark will still have an emotional reaction to his company…to his friend. We should have prepped him longer.” The Founder sucked in a breath and slapped Tony across his face.
The wall dropped in front of them. Nothing was stable, the building kept shaking and Steve kept trying to backtrack out of the building with the shield in front of him. The machine kept blasting the walls as it crept closer and the floors around them, sending every paper and dust flying around them. Steve’s ears were ringing, he couldn’t pay attention to anything Sam was currently saying. By the looks of it, Sam was trying to shoot it.
At the time Tony was being brutally tortured, Steve was out conducting missions, having family dinners, going through break ups and almost getting fired from SHIELD. He was not following leads, he was not trying to find Tony, instead Steve was continuing his everyday routines.
Moving his feet to the foot with the blanket sliding off of him, his phone vibrated silently on the table.
He's ears were thanking the sounds of the clock that he could finally hear after the two decided to settle down. Strucker may sat in the President's chair but he still didn't know how to handle people--even if it's the Founder.
I apologize for such a long wait. Writers block with other activities really takes a toll on writing. I hope the wait was worth it though and everyone still wants to know what happens next.
I hope the images weren't too graphic or vivid. If they were, please let me know and I will fix that warning at the top.
"But Tony came, Steve.” Her voice had gotten soft as she saw Tony flying to talk to Sam, as she heard how much Tony regretted seeing his team caged up like animals. Her anger lessened at the thought of Tony arriving at Siberia, promising her he’ll do everything to help Steve and his friend. "Tony came to help you, to fight on your side, to protect someone he didn’t know anything about because you didn’t want to open your mouth. He came to Siberia as a friend. But you kept a secret. You lied to Tony. You knew what happened to his parents but you didn’t tell him."
“You just want to look cool, man. Don’t even lie.” Sam piped it, sliding a cup towards Steve. “You look like you need three cups of coffee."
The sun shone through the curtains slapping him in the face, warming his cheeks, reminding that the dream was ten years old. Its been a week since he saw that metal machine blasted through the corridor of HYDRA’s compound. Since he read all about HYDRA’s failed experiments. Steve knew he was missing something. As if they gave him a fill in the blank document.
