“That can be discussed between us, but at the bare minimum,” he moved close to Dean’s front, “I’ll give you lots of praise and attention.” He lifted his hands and stroked the omega’s hair again, trailing his fingers down his neck along his spine. “That’s my good boy,” he said in a warm tone that rolled down Dean’s back like velvet. “You did so well, I’m so proud of you.” Dean actually found himself feeling something akin to disappointment when Castiel let his hands fall back to his sides. The alpha smiled at him. “Something like that. Or I can do something else that you like. If there’s anything you want me to do, you can tell me. Good communication is key.” He checked his watch. “I have to go now, but please use this time to settle into the room. I’ll see you later!”
Sam smiled. “No, Dean, you don’t look bad. Maybe a little… on edge, though.” He came around the island. “Come on, let’s go out. It’s Saturday, it’s nice out. There’s a street fair today. Your bread needs time to rise, doesn’t it? You need to have some fun.”
“I know,” said Dean, hands deep in his pockets. “To be honest, I just wanted some time alone with you. Sammy refused to go to bed when you arrived.”
“Ah, you know a guy?” Dean teased.
“I’ll keep training you slowly, in that case.” Removing his hands, Castiel backed up to their door. Dean shivered, suddenly cold without the warmth that radiated from the alpha. He beckoned with one finger. “Come here, Dean.” He took two steps forward and halted when Castiel said, “Stop.” He pointed down. “Kneel.”
“You’re perfectly clean,” Cas assured him. “I’m not venturing deep inside. But I’ll keep in mind that you’re willing to prepare in the future. Do you think you could take my cock in your ass one day?”
Dean shook his head, unable to speak. He took the alpha’s hand and pressed it to the side of his abdomen, pushing in just slightly. Moments later – a flutter of movement, barely noticeable. It could have been passed off as a little stomach gurgle… but they knew better. It was the first touch from their pups, the first physical sign that they were growing to be tiny people. To Dean, it felt a bit like the wings of a bird, small, soft, but surprisingly strong. He didn’t have to ask if Cas had felt it, his face said it all. His expression had gone slack with awe and wonder.
Fond regards, AC
With a massive effort, Dean heaved himself back onto his knees into the position Castiel had originally asked of him with his forehead pressed to the mattress. He squirmed his hips, moving them in tiny motions side to side and back and forth, moaning as the toy shifted inside of him. “Ah!” he cried when he found just the right position and a shiver went through his body.
pregnant.”
Then, on the day they woke up with the intention of contacting their managers for hiatus work, things went from bad to worse. Cas already had a text from Alfie the moment he turned his phone on.
Dean drew Cas into his arms, holding him tight, ignoring the stickiness of the wine. “It’s not your fault, Cas.”

cliché.”
Cas nodded seriously while Sam continued to goggle at both of them. “I will, but later, beloved. I won’t let your mistake ruin our dinner with your brother.”
He furrowed his brows. “What?” It was such a strange thing to say.
“Ahh! That hurts!” Dean cried, tears springing to the corners of his eyes. “I—ah!—I’m going—It’s going t-to break!”
. Dean had a few choices here. He could be evasive. He could shut up. Or he could nut up. Hand shaking, he tapped five keys.
“I’ll see you later,” Castiel said, turning his attention back to Meg.
cheesecake?” asked Dean, glancing over his shoulder between peeking into the oven windows.
“What kind of paperwork?” asked Cas.
It was Christmas Eve and they had reservations at the swanky restaurant inside the hotel Sam was staying at for the holiday. Cas had arranged everything once Dean had given him the information Sam had texted – he’d upgraded Sam’s flight to first class, arranged for a driver, changed his lodging from a cheap motel to a grand, upscale place with a suite, and reserved them a table for dinner on one of the busiest nights of the year.
“I’m guessing this is one of your brothers?” asked Sam.
Dean wanted to protest, but all that came out was an indistinct garble. Words seemed impossible at the moment, let alone walking. Everything was swimming and most of his willpower was involved in keeping his stomach calm. It was all he could do to allow Crowley to manhandle him into a cab. He possibly dozed off again because the next thing he knew, he was landing face-first on a bed. Mumbling, he nuzzled into the blanket, confused because it didn’t smell like him. In fact, it didn’t smell like anything. The whole room had that chemically neutral scent that all hotel rooms had.
“Your point, Gabriel?” asked Naomi.
“I’ll hold you to that. I’m looking forward to trying anything else you make. Seriously, you have a gift.”
“Okay,” Dean said, slowly, tucking the bill into his apron pocket.
Dean applauded along with the rest of the wedding guests as the young queen kissed the king. Now that she was finally able to speak, it had seemed only right to have a second wedding, one where she could do more than nod. He still didn’t fully understand the particulars of why she’d needed to keep silent for seven years as she’d worked to undo a spell set upon her seven brothers, but he figured he didn’t really need to know. Magic didn’t come with handy explanations, magic just
Novak cradled his hand again, rubbing the palm with his thumb. “No. I’m fine. Thank you for asking.”
No. He wasn’t going to
Grabbing it, Dean pulled him away from the set. “This way.”
“He’s far from the only one who says them, you know. I’ve heard it all before.”
“No, it’s still cheesecake,” said Castiel. “But it’s lemon this time.”
Or… His thoughts shifted. Maybe he hadn’t so much
“Thank you for agreeing to meet with me again,” said Chuck. “I had some paperwork drawn up for you.”
Dean wrapped his arms even tighter around his alpha and stretched out his neck as Cas thrust faster, forcing his swelling cock as deep as he could, dragging over his prostate and pushing him further and higher until they were locked. The scream that tore itself free from his throat was part pleasure, part relief, and he sobbed as his body shook from reaching climax but also Cas coming inside his body was like aloe on sunburned skin. Dean’s pain began to melt away the more his alpha came; his chest released its tightness bit by bit and he could finally drag in a full breath. He did so, exhaling with such satisfaction that there were no words to describe it. Well, maybe a few.
“Before I leave,” he said, “you haven’t happened to see someone bring in a pie, have you?”
He was pretty sure Sam knew his complaint wasn’t entirely with the music, but he didn’t say anything, he just walked alongside as they took the long way home.
Obviously, Dean couldn’t reply, but he rotated his wrist a little, trying to get his third finger inside the condom. The angle was too awkward and the latex sheath was sticking to his first two fingers, preventing entry of another.
“Sorry, what was that? I think I fell asleep.”
“Well, you can come inside now.”
Dean couldn’t get a word out if he wanted to. “Mm-hmm,” he squeaked.
is, Dean may not be completely obsessed with ‘how things look,’ and he chooses when and to whom he submits, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. He is also kind, considerate, and caring. He puts other people first. He’s also kind of a badass. He will fight to the death for those he cares about. And that makes him pretty much the ideal mate.” Gabe looked at Castiel. “If you let him slip through your fingers, that makes you an idiot.”
“Can I ask to stop at any time?” Cas asked.
He made a vague gesture. “I don’t want to get into it, I know bartenders aren’t therapists,” he said. “Just some family issues.”
A beautiful smile bloomed on Cas’ face and he kissed Dean, giving him a fresh hit of venom, only he didn’t need it. He never needed it. It was just because Cas wanted to kiss him. And Dean kissed back, not because he had to be drugged in order to want to have sex, but because he needed to be kissed by Cas.
All of a sudden, the bride came bursting in from the direction of the chapel. Her hair and makeup were flawless, but she was still wearing a white robe that said ‘bride’ in rhinestones across the back. Dean wondered if it was something a bridesmaid had gotten her. Following her was a diminutive, older Asian woman, her hair perfectly coifed, wearing a plum colored skirt suit, the kind of thing Dean would expect a First Lady to wear. Her mouth was pinched and her shrewd eyes followed the bride’s every move. ‘Ah,’ thought Dean. ‘This must be the Mother In Law. Capital M-I-L.’
Now Dean understood why Alfie was doing damage control because Castiel’s name had been brought up among a select number of other celebrities.
“Thanks, peanut gallery,” said Dean.
The chasm in his chest cracked open even wider.
“Yes, daddy,” Dean gasped. “I want your knot so bad, please fill me back up!”
“You’re smiling,” said Sam, handing his brother an uncapped bottle.

“It doesn’t really matter to me.”
“I’m sorry, daddy, I thought it was false labor. I’m four weeks early!”

been a difficult phone call. It had taken a lot of psyching himself up and Cas’ encouragement to finally admit to Sam that there was someone special in his life and it wasn’t a woman. It wasn’t a
“That the number one and number two sexiest men in Hollywood ended up in bed together. What a waste for the rest of the world.”
“Nothing else?”
His train of thought shattered as Cas groaned, holding his knot, and began to fill Dean with his come. The lack of fullness was a bit disappointing as he found he loved the feeling of Castiel’s knot filling him up, but in the end, he was grateful because it helped him to refrain from getting overwhelmed by pleasure and stave off his own orgasm. He gritted his teeth and held it back while the alpha continued, pouring wave after wave of come inside his twitching cloaca.
“Sounds like a challenge. Let’s find out.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Well, I never said he was intelligent.” With one hand, he stroked the back of Dean’s head, threading his fingers through the short hairs near his nape. His blue eyes were liquid with apology. “I’m sorry he said those horrible things.”
“You can’t just pick and choose scripture to suit your agenda—”
was the reason why submitting to Cas felt so amazing. With him, Dean had no decisions to make, no standards to uphold, no judgement to face. Only giving in and letting Cas have every worry, every concern, every bit of stress causing Dean frustration, leaving him free to experience whatever the alpha wanted to give him, whether it was pain or pleasure. All of it was a gift in return for his trust. “Yes, please, that’s what I want.”
‘I love you, too,’ Dean mouthed back.
She shook her head, her eyes large. “I’m so sorry.”
“Course I am! You’re a total noob! You gotta pay your dues before you get accolades like that!”
His smile was sweeter than candy, softer than feathers. “I love you, too.”
“Hmm. I thought so,” said Nick. “I wondered about what happened to that smell you had. Up close, I can tell. Someone’s put a jammer on you that you didn’t have before. It’s very nearly perfect, so a human wouldn’t be able to tell anything’s different.”
“Starting to regret that a little bit.” He turned his attention back to Cas. “I hope you’re not mad at me for one last little lie… This isn’t just a business proposal. It’s a real proposal.” He opened the box to reveal a white-gold ring comprised of six carved angel wings in a circle. “What do you say, Cas? Will you marry me?”
“I reimbursed him.”
Everyone enjoyed mock cocktails like ‘Mom-osas’ and ‘Father-itas’ and Gabriel had catered the event with mummy-wrapped pigs-in-a-blanket, smoky pumpkin deviled eggs, mini pumpkin pies (at Dean’s insistence), candied apples, popcorn balls, plus the usual favorite candy bars in mini sizes. They had ‘Hocus Pocus’ showing on the television just for some background noise while they played games like ‘Who can dress a doll blindfolded the fastest?’ and ‘Complete the nursery rhyme’ before moving on to opening the gifts.
“Sure—um, that is…” His gaze slid away. “Actually… tonight’s not good for me…”
He sighed. “I was upset. I feel stupid now, but last night it seemed like a really good idea to just not think for a while.”
“Why put up with that shit?”
“Whoa!” he said.
“Come on, Dean, it was a little funny,” said Cas, the smile lingering on his face even as his mirth died down. “Honestly, that’s the only thing I care about besides the marriage thing.”
Dean blushed, knowing that for the truth. “It’s fine. This has to take precedence. I might not always be there to walk in at the right time. You have no idea what all was going through my head…”
know was that Cas was the only one who could rein him in like this, the only one who understood the needs of his inner omega and also recognized his mirror image in Dean. An alpha who could lean on him at the same time he held Dean in his arms. It was only Cas.
Cas was silent the whole way to the car where he handed Dean the keys and got in on the passenger side. He still wouldn’t even look his way. Dean didn’t want to press him, knowing he had to be feeling awful, but at the same time, he needed to give Cas his support.
He was able to say “Mm?” in between moaning as he looked at Cas behind him out of the corner of his eye. What he wanted to say was ‘why’ because what he was asking for was pretty much meaningless. They both knew that Dean wasn’t a virgin, but for some reason, this scenario seemed important to Cas. He’d gone to such lengths to make it happen.
“It just is!”
Cas was already looking up a recipe on his phone. “We’re going to need egg whites, cream of tartar, granulated and confectioner’s sugar, unsalted butter, vanilla, milk, and most importantly, cashews.”
“I want you now,” said Dean, pressing his forehead against Castiel’s.
Dear AC,
“What the hell?” he exclaimed, the buzzing beneath his skin rising to a boil.
“We did.” Another kiss. Who cared that everyone was watching? They barely noticed. “I love you so much.”
He fidgeted with the edge of his blanket. “The man I was supposed to meet the night we met…?”
Cas already knew that, of course, and believed that it was because Dean’s body knew it had an alpha now that it was trying to start its cycle early. Dean only mentioned it to let his brother know since it affected his work schedule.
it’s difficult.” He caressed the omega’s cheek. “I didn’t tell you because I know you crave the submission that humiliation brings you. But by now I know that you’ll submit no matter what. So, does knowing why I ask make it easier for you to open up to me?”
“You’re doing just fine,” said John. “I know this couldn’t have been easy. Hell, it’s not easy to hear, it’s gotta be damn hard to say.”
Castiel’s eyes were cast across the street from where he and Dean were standing, watching as the lights inside the bakery began to turn on. It was very early in the morning and Dean held Castiel’s hand tightly, watching as his throat moved around a hard swallow. He didn’t ask if Cas was ready, he didn’t say a word, he just stood there with all the patience Cas required until he could find it in himself to step off that curb. Into the abyss.
“Key lime cheesecake,” said Castiel. “But yes… it tastes more like a key lime pie with a sort of cream cheese texture. How well do you think it does in fighting the pepper versus the lemon yesterday?”
the intensity! Reset for close-ups, do it just like that for continuity’s sake!”
Castiel looked up, like he was looking right through Dean, and nodded solemnly, his brow furrowed.
They popped the balloon and it exploded in a rain of pink
“Distract,” Cas said immediately.
Dean took the photo and went white when he saw Cas pushing him up against the back of his trailer, lip-locked in a passionate kiss. His first instinct was to tear it up, but logic kicked its way through the panic, telling him she would have this backed up digitally. She could print as many as she liked.
So, dressed in a new dark suit with a subtle blue plaid in a wide pattern, he sat in Sam’s car along with John, bouncing his leg impatiently, as they headed over to meet Cas and his family at The Gates. Sam was wearing a pretty boring gray suit with a red-striped tie, but John looked rather handsome in black-on-black, the collar of his shirt left open.
“Hello, my beloved,” he said, warmly.
The presence of Alfie on set forced Dean and Cas to remain even more ‘strictly professional’ at work. Dean pulled back on his suggestive comments and eyebrow waggling, they both kept the shoulder touches and playful elbowing to maybe once a day. Nothing that would give anyone watching reason to suspect anything. It meant that the sexual tension for Bast and Rami went through the freaking

, everything in Dean had sat up and taken notice, every nerve ending flared to life.
“Well, I’m glad he explained things. Saves me the trouble. I’ll thank him later.”
“Yes, daddy, of course,” he said, breathlessly. “I could never be satisfied without your knot! Please fill me with your big, hard cock, please, I need it so bad!”
“A couple of days after we broke up. I figured there had to be more going on because the only reason you would break us up was if you really thought it was for the best. And you were so miserable, it couldn’t have been for selfish reasons. Did you really think I would let you hurt yourself for me?”
He wanted to say more because he
“Damn it, Sammy…”
Almost shyly, he approached Dean with a rosy blush on his cheeks, handing over a small bottle.
coughing?”
His hand landed on his phone, which had fallen out of his pants pocket when he’d taken them off. Swiping it open, he saw that it was on mute and he had missed a call approximately every fifteen minutes since late last night. Cas had tried to call him all night long. Dean could hardly breathe.
“Just be careful; don’t let yourself be alone with that guy. Hollywood’s full of ‘em.”
“You so are!” He held up his hands. “I’ll look, alright? Calm down.”
Though Dean was happy to see his brother, of course, his heart jumped when he saw Cas enter behind him. So strange, it had been months since he’d last seen Sam in person while it had only been a few hours for Cas, but Dean already missed his alpha. Their mating bond at work, but also probably because of the influence of his rampaging pregnancy hormones. Cas gave his trench coat to the butler, revealing the sweater he was wearing that complimented the greens in Dean’s dress.
“Oh,” he said, more of a relieved sigh than a word.

Maybe it was the post-orgasm, post-mating glow, but the kiss they shared after that felt different. Deeper. More meaningful. Because he was kissing his

He shivered, and not just from the sexy threat. Christmas Eve at night in California was still pretty cold for nudity and his nipples were getting very hard, even when cuddling the human heater that was Cas. He wiggled his jeans the rest of the way off and both of them crawled under the blankets.
“We won’t interrupt, we’ll just stand in the back and look through the windows. I kinda want to see these kids get their happily ever after.”
Dean: u busy?
Dean didn’t really feel like being polite to the man. “Not sure I should. I don’t want anyone getting the wrong impression.”
He grabbed the omega around the back of his neck and pulled him in for a hard kiss. “My naughty boy,” he said, breathlessly, but his voice was full of affection. “Lift up your skirt.”
Dean didn’t find out what Cas meant until they left the mall and headed for their next destination – a sex store. After the gleaming opulence of the mall, this was a bit of a shock, to be led through the doors and into a veritable palace of pleasures with red walls and black carpet with leather-ish upholstered chairs. The lingerie on display was a lot more risqué than that at Omega’s Secret and featured certain ‘themed’ items like skimpy uniforms that no actual self-respecting nurse or policeperson would ever really wear. There were rows upon rows of porn, towers featuring various kinds of lubricants and edible underwear, and walls lined with toys, including some that made Dean nervous, like the dog mask and lockable hand mittens.
“Just a second,” said Dean. “Jack, will you take the groceries into the kitchen, please?”
“Will do. Dean?”
“Wow,” said Dean, still struggling to catch his breath. “How did you do that?”
“Honorary Winchester,” said Sam. “We’ll even come up with a mean nickname for you, if you want.”
“Did you want to shoot something?” asked Dean, turning around as he heard the click of the door locking. His stomach dropped when he saw Cas holding a paper bag, his eyes beginning to filament with red.
“And daddy would have on his wedding band,” said Dean. “But there’s another reason why I smell ‘off’ to you.” He held out his hand to Cas, who reached into the inside pocket of his coat and handed the sonogram picture to Dean with a soft smile. He held it up for Sam to see, grinning widely. “Guess what?”
The alpha squirmed a little. “Might have,” he mumbled at length.

Applause from inside the chapel cut off their whispered conversation and they looked to see the bride and groom sharing their first kiss as husband and wife. Grinning, they both clapped along then high-tailed it back to the parish hall to re-join Sam before the guests made their exit.
Dean snorted. Who leaves a comment on a forum like that? He tapped out a quick reply.
“Don’t go! Hear me out!” He jerked the omega into his arms, crossing them over his abdomen with Dean’s back to his front. “Please stop struggling or you’re going to trigger my chase instinct,” he rumbled into his ear.
“We were in a rush, if you’ll remember,” said Dean. “Also, Cas and I are going to the Farmer’s Market in the morning, so you don’t have to worry about that.”
“Ohhh,” Cas sighed, eyes rolling back.
Dear AC,
Yours, Pieman
After paying the check, they left the restaurant with Dean on Castiel’s arm. It was late in the afternoon now, since their lunch had been so delayed it had been more of an early dinner, and the sun was starting to sink. When they climbed back in the Packard, Dean leaned over and put his head in the alpha’s lap, wrapping his lower arm around his thigh. Cas stroked his hair, making Dean’s eyes close in pleasure and a deep purr start up in his chest. The rumble of the car lulled him into a doze.
“You’re not regretting it, are you?” asked Dean, his guilt pricking him a bit, since it was basically his information on the fan base that had led to such a drastic change for the show.
Once Cas was seated at the table, he glanced at the drink list and ordered them both a single malt whiskey, neat, which impressed Dean because he didn’t remember telling him it was his favorite non-beer drink. The server left and Cas turned in his chair a bit to smile at his omega. He reached for him with his nearest hand and again did the move where he carded his fingers through Dean’s hair and around behind his ear, caressing the back of his head and neck. Dean leaned into it, nuzzling his nose against Castiel’s wrist and scenting him.
“Oh, I’m sure they don’t
“Did you get hard while suckling my cock, beloved?” he asked, his voice soft but with a low rumble in it.

question,” he said, hands on his hips and frowning.
Bast’s eyes got huge and Gabriel dropped the sword in shock. “But… it’s not time yet,” said Bast. “Not even close!”
“If the public makes a fuss, then I should take responsibility too, it shouldn’t all fall on Dean.”
“Using that name in vain never made
A nurse came running back with Cas and a wheelchair, which she prepared by locking the wheels as Cas transferred Dean out of the regular chair. “How far along?” she asked.
began to play as he turned to use the lance to open up a portal to New Heaven. Bast and Rami looked at each other and joined hands, leaning in to share the first kiss of this brave, brand-new world.
A shuffling on the other side of the door, the sound of a lock turning, and it opened… revealing Castiel in a burgundy bathrobe, bare at the neck, with flannel pant legs sticking out the bottom. He was clutching a bag of frozen peas to his head and just one eye was visible, only half open as he blearily peered at him. The poor man looked like everything hurt. And Dean immediately found himself in the unique predicament of feeling turned on and protective at the same time.
Balthazar looked at Dean. “Got things covered?” he asked, indicating Cas with a tilt of his head since they’d come in the same car.
Re: An idea
rich. “Uh, yeah.”
“I agree,” said Cas, “but are you sure you want to compromise your public image on campus? We didn’t agree to that, so I won’t be upset if you want to change.”
“What are you—ah!”
“Well, if the network is smart, they’ll allow the writers to follow through,” said Dean, going back to scrolling. “It’s clearly what the majority of the fans want. It would be so anticlimactic without it.”
more, but there weren’t words for it. Maybe he was too fucked-out to think of them or maybe they hadn’t been invented yet or maybe it was better to leave it unsaid. Giving it a name would make it small. This way, it was infinite and Cas seemed to understand that as he leaned down to kiss Dean again, passing this wordless thing between them through breath and soft touches while rolling them onto their sides in order to get comfortable.
Novak was staring again. It was becoming something of a habit for him. “Why are you telling me this? After all, Spangler said the takes were fine.”
Chuckling, Castiel set his champagne glass and the pie on the coffee table. “Thank you,” he said, leaning closer to Dean and putting a hand beneath his chin. “But I think I’d rather have some of
Reflexively, Dean smiled back, used to people of all sorts flirting with him, even fellow omegas. “Aw, stop it, man, you’re making me blush.”
Dean set the pie box on the ground in a flash so he had both hands free, then Castiel was in his arms, his head tilted just so. When Dean closed that tiny distance and pressed his lips to Castiel’s, the spark of connection was instantaneous, and Cas breathed in sharply through his nose. He melted into Dean, fisting his hands into the back of Dean’s jacket like he was holding on for dear life. When they parted, breath coming fast, Dean cradled Castiel’s face in his hands like he was holding something incredibly precious, like he held the whole world.
the show he co-starred in with John. The press and public had really taken to an actual father-son team playing father and son on television. It was a big selling point.
Dean’s heart pounded hard against his chest. “Really?” But he knew. Maybe he’d known since the first time Cas had called him ‘my beloved.’
Dean exhaled hard. “I guess there’s still a lot I have to learn.”
He nodded and Dean kissed him again as he maneuvered himself up on his knees. When he reached for the waistband, carefully pulling the underwear up and over, Cas assisted him by lifting his bottom in order to take them off completely. Dean knelt between Castiel’s legs, kissing his thighs and stroking his hips, waiting for him to relax a bit before licking a stripe along the underside of Castiel’s cock.
Tears in his eyes, Dean looked up at Cas. “First-born twins,” he said. “Sounds like we’re continuing a family tradition.”
Castiel’s brows drew together and it was completely unfair. “He seemed sad?”
“Stay tuned for the pup shower,” said Gabriel to the room at large. “You’ll all be getting a link to their gift registry, go there early to reserve the one you want to give most! To avoid heat and rut season, we’re thinking October with a Halloween theme, so start getting your costumes together, too!”
Jack smiled brightly. “Yep! Balthazar left pretty much immediately after you did. Threw down a broom, saying ‘finally, someone said it,’ and walked right out. Then Uriel apologized and followed him. Ion, Anael, even Michael… We quit!”
I wish you were here right now to have a drink with me
“Cas—” Dean began, but that was as far as he got.
“Ah, true. Gabe
“I’ve just come up with a new pie, not on the list yet,” he said. “And I think it would be great for your wedding. I call it the ‘Falling In Love Chocolate Pie.’ It’s a dark chocolate pie with a heart-shaped white chocolate center, because with love, you have to take the bitter with the sweet.” It was the pie he’d created with Castiel as his inspiration.
“I could jam the signal. Right now, you’re like an open faucet, leaking life energy everywhere and even people who can’t sense it will be attracted to it on a more subconscious level. All you have to do is hide it.”
“It’s written on the weapon,” Castiel patiently explained as he would to a child.
Novak chuckled. “Not exactly. But I’ve definitely never met someone quite like you.”
“Didn’t take you long to figure out a way to get my number,” said Sam, smiling as they exchanged cell phones to input their information.
“It’s not wrong,” said Dean. “Love can’t be wrong.”
“I’m pleased that you came back and waited when I told you to, so I’m rewarding you for that first,” he said, gesturing with his hands that Dean should lie down with him.
Re: Oh?
amount of incest porn between Jed and Bast, not that he could really blame them. The writers hadn’t provided their characters with any meaningful relationships aside from each other. Maybe if they were more respectful of the female characters that wafted in and out of the scripts, people could find something else to ‘ship.’
Cas assisted Dean in getting to his feet from his awkward straddle then followed him up. Shoving the chair away, he bent him over the desk and re-entered him from behind, leaning over Dean’s back and wrapping his arms around him. He kept the pace fast and his strokes shallow as his knot began to swell. Castiel’s harsh breathing rasped right next to his ear, almost growling as he chased after orgasm.
an ass. And a total chicken. This wasn’t just
“I’m not joking,” he said, jerking his shoulders to get free of his grip. It was probably only because Cas was so startled that he was able to. “Listen. I’ve been acting for twenty years. I don’t intend to stop anytime soon. And a scandal can ruin someone for a hell of a long time in this business. Not everyone can survive long enough to make a comeback either.”
“Rami was accepted by the LGBTQ+ community way before the final season,” Cas went on. “It was such an honor to get to portray that openly, finally. To show that love, that gay love, can not only change the world, it can save it.”
“Well, this is a surprise. Castiel texted me. What are you doing here?” she asked.
“Oh, Dean,” said Cas, turning in his arms. “It’s lovely.”
“Should I come over to that side?” the priest asked. “You really don’t sound well.”
Cas kissed Dean’s hand. “Good.” He left with the man through a door with one backward glance at his omega, giving a wink just before the door closed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Are we on a couch
“Huh. I like it. One syllable. Easy to scream in bed.”
“I think I’m starting to believe that. Among other things.”
Novak was beside him in the bed, holding his cellphone and smiling down at Dean… and not wearing a shirt. Miles of gorgeous skin, all on display like he wasn’t self-conscious in the least. His arms made Dean’s mouth water and he swallowed hard. Novak leaned forward, a tiny line of concern between his brows.
“So, no Farmer’s Market for us, I take it?”
“How addicted to you are you going to make me?” Cas rasped.
They gave Gabriel and Sam their gifts at the same time, one mug that said ‘Favorite Uncle’ and another that said ‘Coolest Uncle,’ each with a picture of Claire and Jack on the side. They looked at them and burst out laughing, which was the reaction Dean had been hoping for, knowing that they’d be happy with either title and could share the mugs between them.
To quote you, six of one, half dozen of the other. Getting that drunk was a very bad idea. But I also said some things last night that were truly appalling.
The alpha lifted his face to the ceiling, stretching out and offering his neck on a long groan as Dean slid inside, inch by inch. Castiel’s cock trembled, standing straight up, and pre-come dribbled down the length, pooling on Dean’s pubic bone. Finally, Cas was fully seated, one hand braced on Dean’s chest to hold himself up, goosebumps erupting all along his arms. His hole clenched and spasmed, but he didn’t move yet. They held there for a long moment, just enjoying being joined as one.
Castiel turned, startling slightly at the omega’s unexpected presence. “Oh…”
. Now if you don’t mind?” He gestured pointedly at his trailer.
“I’m gonna go crazy if I have to wait any more.”
Still in the throes of orgasm, Castiel started to bite down on Dean’s shoulder. Not nearly hard enough to break the skin, but it startled Dean out of his just-fucked haze enough to reach up and push his face away.
Dean sent back: He says you’re the brother of his mate-to-be. Of course he’s going to provide the best hospitality he can.
At that moment, his legs chose to give out. He’d had very little sleep and a full day’s work after all. Dean slid down the wall and slumped against it, breathing hard. “We… can’t do this…” he panted. “We’re still… in wardrobe…” And he’d never be able to see Ramiel’s trench coat again without remembering this moment.
It sent a pulse through him. “Cas,” he said between clenched teeth as he tried to hold off his orgasm. “Cas, please, I can’t—”
“I can’t wait until Sam comes next week,” Dean was saying as he unboxed fancy plastic balls that looked like glass, not wanting anything that little hands could break in the future. “We might not see much of him until the actual celebrations, though. Being away from Gabriel is killing him.”
Something was really bothering this man, Dean could tell, his bartender instincts were jangling like crazy. His bi-dar, however, was all over the place. He never had a problem flirting with the ladies who came in, but it was always hard to tell if he was clear to make a pass at a man. That kind of thing could get dangerous, depending on who it was and what kind of attitude they had.
“I’ll accept that apology from Naomi, if she gives it,” said Cas. “We’ll leave this with you to handle. But know that we’ll take things to court if we have to.”
“Never mind!”
Castiel’s head fell back on a groan as Dean suckled his tip, swirling his tongue all around it and licking up all that had dripped before slowly working his way down. He used his hand to pump along the length, looking up while he bobbed up and down because he knew that Cas liked to see his eyes when Dean sucked him.
Dean leaned over Cas in order to see the screen better and to reach the touchpad. It put his chest directly in the alpha’s face, allowing Cas to push the neckline of Dean’s dress and his bra low enough to expose his enlarged breasts, by now gone up a second cup size. He gasped as one nipple was drawn into the heat of his alpha’s mouth, latching on and suckling as their pups soon would. He was wearing milk pads in his bras now to catch the little leaks that happened throughout the day and Cas had taken to encouraging it by drinking from him in this manner whenever they had sex face-to-face. Dean hadn’t thought it would feel as erotic as it did, since he associated breast feeding to maternal emotions, but seeing Cas at his breast, moaning and enjoying his taste not like a pup but as an adult alpha did, made his knees feel like butter. Reminding him that he wasn’t just an incubator with a built-in food source, he was a sexy, highly desirable
, we have Castiel Novak and Meg Masters here with us,” the hostess was saying.
“Ahh, so good!” he cried. A jolt went through his body as Cas thrust into his prostate and he wailed out his pleasure.
“Timing? You know we were supposed to meet before this.”
Leaning in, Cas cupped the back of Dean’s neck and pressed their lips together in a slow, sweet kiss. His scent had warmed up again and sweet vanilla curled around them as his other hand found the omega’s hip, dragging him closer into the cradle of his lap. Dean lifted up and straddled him instead, their kiss gaining heat as Dean rolled his body and ground his pelvis against Castiel’s. A growl in the back of his throat, Cas hooked his hands around the back of Dean’s thighs and stood up. He wrapped his legs around the alpha’s waist as Cas carried him into the bedroom to lovingly undress him, piece by piece. The remaining scent blockers were wiped away until they could merge properly into the smell of pie on Christmas morning.
Re: About me
“Yes, I know,” said Cain, giving him a firm shake. “I’ve been a fan of your work for some time now. Though I have to watch your current show by myself in the den. Wife doesn’t much care for all the—well, you know.”
“Bit—” He swallowed the rest of his usual insult. “I need you. You don’t have to come inside.”
“Ah, yes, this is your co-star, is it not?” she said, coming forward. Behind her, Cas looked like he wanted to rip out her throat for getting anywhere near Dean. He couldn’t scent anything from her, she was wearing blockers, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to know what she smelled like. “Naomi Shurley. I’m pleased I could meet you tonight as well, Dean Winchester.” She offered her hand and Dean looked at it like it was a snake but shook it anyway.
“No,” Dean whined as he tried to walk on legs like cooked pasta. “This isn’t what I wanted… We had a birth plan! We don’t have their coming-home outfits… I want my nest, I want Dr Akobel… And I don’t want my pups born in
“Are you sure that’s all?” Dean asked. “He could be fat.”
with the next scenes, please?”
If he kept this up, Dean would need to run to the bathroom and readjust his jeans. To try and diffuse some of the tension in the air, Dean attempted to make a joke like he usually would.
crew is like an extension of family.”
They didn’t reappear again until it was time for dinner and, notably, Gabriel was wearing a solid silver collar around his neck. Pleased as punch, he was walking around as tall as possible with his chin up to show it off. When he turned his back, two golden wings could be seen dangling from either side of the clasp. Dean admired it along with the rest of the family and asked to see the ring on Sam’s hand, shaped like six gold wings in a circle.
“I thought so,” said Sam, shaking his head. “I never thought I’d see the day. My brother and a cake lover.”
more open himself, for Castiel’s sake.
Dean turned to look at Cas, only to find the alpha already watching him intensely. A lump was beginning to form in his throat as he gestured off-set. “I guess I’ll be in my trailer,” he said with something of a question in his tone.
While Castiel prepared the champagne, Dean got his pie and a fork and sat down on the couch to eat it right out of the tin. He watched the alpha move around his small kitchen, humming to himself happily and laughing when he got the cork out without making a mess. Dean rolled his eyes. Sometimes it was so hard to remember that Cas was definitely not the ‘harmless alpha’ he made himself out to be. Not with the way he fucked. Ahem…
Cas placed the crook of his fingers below Dean’s chin and tilted his head up, meeting his lips in a sweet kiss. A thrill chased up and down the omega’s spine and the hair on the back of his neck stood up. It was completely different from any other kiss he’d ever had, like a thunderclap to his system, because it felt like the beginning of something. A promise. A vow. Carved into his very being until it was a quintessential part of what made him who he was.
“Why?”
I’m getting worried.”
“I was afraid you might think I was manipulating you.”
When the song ended, he grabbed some toilet paper, wiped his face and blew his nose. He hoped that the message had come across. His phone buzzed and he checked it immediately, the light from his phone nearly blinding him after being in the dark for so long.
Yours, Pieman
Castiel lifted his head to frown down over Dean’s shoulder. “Who said that to you?” he demanded.
he tells me!”
The hospital had contacted Sam because, as the next alpha in the family, John would have listed him first. But, of course, he couldn’t go because he still had a week of classes to complete before break. That was fine with Dean, he didn’t want the kid anywhere near their father. They’d never gotten along and all it would do was mess with Sam’s head and put his schoolwork at risk, which was way more important than dealing with their sad excuse for a father. Dean could handle this. He had to.
“I’m just lucky they didn’t go with Qafsiel, spelled with a Q,” Novak went on. “I’d be explaining that one constantly. Think of the poor baristas.” He chuckled at his own joke and Dean couldn’t help but smile back.
Michael, Luce, John, and Cain all winced. “Nothing good,” said John. “I thought I raised you to know better.”
He read over the message. He’d answered all of AC’s questions, but he couldn’t bring himself to send it off just yet. He kept looking at the last paragraph his friend had written. It was nice, that Dean ‘always made him smile,’ he liked that. There was nothing wrong with being pleased about making someone happy. There wasn’t anything more to it than that.
With another sigh, he pocketed his phone. Without the distraction, his current problem came crashing back and the modicum of comfort talking to Sam had brought him evaporated. Dean just couldn’t believe that his own body chemistry would betray him like this. It always pissed him off when teachers or other authoritarians told him what to do. So much so, that his anger grew hard to control. Only his dad had ever managed to subdue that urge to fight back. He just couldn’t picture the person who could be intimidating enough to take John Winchester’s place in that particular role. Couldn’t fathom ever being
“Baby, if I was giving you pleasure, I’d be putting in a hell of a lot more effort.” He winked and Sam’s face went red.
His face flamed and Dean swallowed down the moan that wanted to come out. Castiel’s filthy mouth was going to be the death of him. “N-no,” he lied, afraid the man might make him describe it to him.
Pulling him by the hand, Cas went to his desk and set the plug down then sat in his chair. It was one of those large, fancy ones with neck and lumbar support and low arm rests, the whole thing covered in black leather. Keeping his reddening eyes on Dean, he unbuckled his belt and unfastened his slacks, freeing his already hard cock from their confines. Then, placing his hands on the omega’s slightly widened hips, he guided Dean down onto him and Cas leaned back in the chair so Dean’s belly had room.
Cas shut off the radio. “Close your eyes,” he instructed.
“Oh?” Cas ran two fingers gently over the furled pink lips of the omega’s cloaca, already dripping with slick. “Then I suppose I should prepare you a little more carefully if you haven’t been touched in a while.” He eased them inside. “Hmm…” He moved them in and out, then stretched the opening by moving his fingers apart. “So soft,” he commented as Dean moaned, throwing back his head. Without warning, he drove three fingers in, hard and fast, making Dean cry out louder. “Why is it opening up so easily, Dean? Is your body remembering me?”
“Yes,” he said, pinching his brows together so his expression wouldn’t slip. He couldn’t cry. He wouldn’t. He was the best damn actor in the business. He could sell the hell out of this and make Cas hate him enough to go through with leaving him. “Jeez, I didn’t think you’d be so upset,” he said, scratching the back of his neck. “What do I gotta do, give you one last fuck to get it all out of your system?”
Dean snorted and decided to tease him a little.
They might as well have been on the moon for all they cared about who was there with them. Cas kissed him leisurely, like they had all the time in the world and no audience watching them. The alpha’s tongue was sweet, coated with the remnants of Dean’s orgasm. Sitting up on his knees, his daddy aligned himself and entered him with a snap of his hips in one sure, swift motion. Dean arched his back, moaning loud because daddy liked to hear him, so he wouldn’t bother suppressing his voice. And this from the omega who’d been afraid that someone might see him kneeling outside their dorm room. How much he’d changed in just a short time still amazed him.
With trepidation mounting by the second, Dean crept over to the window and nudged his brother out of the way. And sure enough, it wasn’t just a man who looked like Castiel – it
It was a vivid image and Dean swallowed hard, now suddenly dealing with his own trouser situation. But he had a wicked idea blooming that had him smiling while they tracked down Sam and then Cain and Colette, making plans to meet for lunch before they would head back to Illinois. Colette expressed interest in experiencing a Southern California brunch, but Dean assured her it was just an excuse to have alcohol with breakfast foods and they shouldn’t pay forty-five dollars a plate just for that. Dean Winchester did not ‘do brunch.’
He hesitated. “Well, I would be
See you Sunday, AC
He licked along Dean’s jaw and down his neck to tease his mating gland. “You’ve already done that.” His chest rumbled in a deep purr. “You feel so good around me, Dean. How does it make you feel?”
Yours, Pieman
Suddenly, Rami began glowing, centered around his belly. He fell to his knees, groaning, and Bast grabbed him around the shoulders, holding him up.
When he finally started coming back to himself, the heaviness of his own body surprised him. He’d never felt quite so dense in the literal sense before. There was a ‘your density’ joke in there somewhere, but his brain wasn’t quite back enough for him to parse it out yet. Next came the realization that he was lying on his side on the bed with Cas curled up behind him, his knot swollen inside Dean. For all he knew, he could have been drifting for hours, but it couldn’t have been too long if they were still tied. Reflexively, he clenched, earning a moan from his alpha, letting him know Cas wasn’t asleep, for which he was grateful. Finding he could move his arms again, though the movements were sluggish at best, he brought them to rest over Castiel’s, which were wrapped around Dean’s torso. Their fingers twined.
Dean glared up at him, but pronounced clearly, “I want your
Breathing deep, he let it out with a sigh. It was going to feel so good to crawl into bed tonight, just let the alcohol in his system lull him off on a gentle sea, worry about the hangover when it happened. That was a problem for Future Dean…
“We should also start talking about names,” said Dean, looking down at his belly speculatively. “I keep calling them Little Girl and Little Boy.”
“We can always hope.” Castiel’s phone buzzed. “Check that for me?” he asked, gesturing with the spatula.
“I think I can picture it,” said Dean. “You, with a dark mop of hair and big serious eyes, frowning at all the adults.”
They left quickly and Dean couldn’t help but feel they’d dodged a bullet, but that thought didn’t bring much comfort. Not when Castiel emerged from the office with his head bowed and his shoulders hunched, looking so small and guilt-ridden, it broke Dean’s heart. The door of the office closed with a sense of finality, but things were far from over.
‘I love you,’ Cas mouthed silently.
“It’s why I call him ‘daddy,’” said Dean quietly, ducking his head.
“What?”
“It’s just me,” said Cas, a smile in his voice.
“Okay. I guess it wasn’t…
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
“It’s from a place pretty close to Stanford and they give discounts to the students. California wines are supposed to be pretty good.” He shrugged. “Hopefully, by next year I’ll know you well enough to pick a more personal gift.”
“Dude, that wasn’t a sleepover, that was an unplanned overnight.”
“Does twenty years in the business mean nothing to you?”
was perfectly set. Cas and Dean carried out the tray. One of them could have done it alone, but Dean wanted them to do it together. He couldn’t help but be reminded of the first time he’d ever laid eyes on Castiel – when they were both holding onto opposite sides of a serving tray. There were tears aplenty as the bride and groom shared their cake-cutting with the groom’s parents and the Mother In Law actually kissed the bride’s cheek. Dean couldn’t help a small fist-pump. He and Cas had saved that moment for them.
Once Dean and Sam finished creating the dough they needed, they moved Castiel away from the island and to the side counter to work on the pecan filling while the brothers began rolling out the crust on the largest surface area. All two hundred had to be par-baked in their teeny pie tins before the fillings went in prior to the final bake. Each brother was able to create a large flat expanse to cut circles of dough with only a few strokes of their heavy marble rolling pins. Cas wandered over to watch their technique, hauling the huge mixing bowl full of nuts along with him and continuing to stir as he observed.
Opening up his phone, he texted Castiel and made his gambit.
“Of course.”
Soon after that, the three of them exited the premises congratulating each other on a job well done, but were halted by the sound of quick-moving high heels. Turning, they saw the Mother In Law hurrying to catch them.
different! He’d changed so much in such a short amount of time, the reality of it was making his head spin.
As for pajamas… when it’s cold, I wear them. When it’s hot… sometimes I do not.
Cas placed a kiss to the bite scar on Dean’s neck, only visible to them. “That man touched your hands,” he murmured.
“So was I.”
Cas gathered Dean close to his chest, licking his way into his mouth for a deeply satisfied kiss. They each breathed shakily through their noses but eventually had to part for deeper breaths. It had been pretty intense for both of them, having been apart for so long, but damn… Couldn’t complain about the result.
Cas thought about it. “I promise no airplanes are involved.”
Fuck, he really was pathetic. Crying over sex. His emotions were overwhelming and something of that must have leaked into his scent because suddenly Cas was putting out soothing reassurance through his pheromones and caressing him with gentle hands. He turned Dean’s face to his for a deep, passionate kiss.
Sam shook his head. “You know I’m not into guys but…” He looked off, the way Gabe had gone. “That is one
Dean smiled and touched his glass to Castiel’s. “Me too.”
He laughed. “I know.”
Dean covered his face with his hands. “Oh, my God! How can you just
“Anyone would get startled if someone suddenly touched them!” Dean spat.
The chocolate from Trickster smelled divine and smelled even better once the pies were in the oven. Testing the batter, he nodded to himself. These would be the best Falling In Love pies ever. He made a mental note to send Sam down to work out a deal with Gabriel so they could get all of their chocolate from him in the future. He could go himself, but then he wouldn’t get to tease Sam about his crush.
The pickup went further and further into the hills, making Dean increasingly curious as to where they were going. There wasn’t a whole lot of civilization up here. They kept on, eventually turning off onto a dirt road. It appeared to be some kind of state park. He could see spaces for campsites, but since it was very early Spring and definitely the off-season, it was utterly abandoned. The only movement came from the moths clustering around the infrequent solar lights.
face would be blurred. She would want Cas to be positively identified, not speculated about.
“Dean!” he cried, his voice muffled against the omega’s neck.
Keeping his hands on Dean’s hips, Cas placed a reverent kiss to the tip then licked down one side of his length and up the other. He teased the underside and took just the head into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, doing everything he knew drove Dean crazy. And all he could do was stand there and accept, holding his skirt open, trying to remember not to lock his knees, as his breathing became heavier and his nipples tightened beneath the bust of his gown. Seeing the way his daddy was looking up at him with vibrantly red eyes and Dean’s cock in his mouth was making his orgasm rush up extremely fast, even before Cas took him all the way down and started sucking in earnest.
And I drank it
“I can see that,” said Cas, smiling. “I meant physically.”
“I’m only bringing this up because I worry for you,” Cas went on. “I know you’re not ready. If you were, you’d want to tell your father. And I don’t want an apology,” he said quickly, holding up a hand when Dean opened his mouth to do just that. “I’m not saying this to pressure you. I want you to be ready in your own time, not just because all
Like I said, I was afraid. I thought if you didn’t like me, or if I scared you off, you’d stop emailing and this would be over. And I’d rather go on being anonymous than have that happen.
Dean gritted his teeth, forcing himself to speak though his jaw was clenched in reaction to the alpha-voice. “Bastard,” he ground out. “What the hell did you do to me?”
“Guess I was more tired than I thought.” He offered a sleepy smile of his own. “You make a pretty good pillow, man.”
“Insect?” Dean repeated, placing a hand on his chest as though hurt. “And when I came all this way to give you a chance…”
Dean snorted. “Wow, I didn’t have you pegged for the small, blond, and feisty type.”
Castiel’s cheeks flushed and he didn’t say anything, but his little smile made Dean feel like he’d won something. Putting down his fork, Cas cleared his throat and asked, “So… what can I do to help you tonight?”
“I should’ve expected that you’d turn him against me.”
“Are you going to be okay? And don’t tell me you’re fine,” he added, sternly.
Down at the far end of the bar, he saw a man with dark, messy hair hunched over the bar. He wore a slightly dirty trench coat over a deep navy suit and had a five o’clock shadow darkening his jawline. All in all, a fairly standard-looking barfly, if he were judging a book by its cover. Dean leaned both hands on the bar and tried not to sound too brusque as he asked, “What can I get you?”
At the start of the next week, Dean and Cas were eager to get to work because it was finally time to start filming the primary footage on the season finale. The storyline was very exciting. Bast was supposed to make a deal with a knight of Hell to get his father back, very dramatic stuff. Only the actor playing the knight, Fergus Crowley, had neglected to show up for the table-read on day one, putting everyone in a bad mood from the beginning. Zeddmore berated him when he showed up late the next day, close enough to be within Dean’s earshot as he was getting his makeup applied.
“Hello there,” he said, a sly smile on his face. He waved a copy of the tabloid rather than his hand in greeting. “Spare a minute?”
oblivious,” said Dean, and Sam snickered. “I made the mistake of letting him choose where we went.”
“First John, four-seven,” Castiel corrected. “It’s my favorite. ‘Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God. And everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.’ It’s the one thing I knew Chuck could never contradict.”
the other, they
So, it was time to take risks, do controversial things, and indulge in storylines they normally wouldn’t in the name of preserving their ratings. Webb gave his full support, as long as they adhered to censorship guidelines like always. This was their last go-round, so why not? The writers were
“You think so?” asked Gabe. “Mother always said I didn’t have a nurturing bone in my body.”
“I wouldn’t have missed out on that.”
“Yes, this one, too,” he said. “It’s perfect for special occasions. Would you please bring me the box? We’ll be using one of your dressing rooms.” He handed over his credit card to pay for everything and the girl fished a sealed box displaying the gold plug out from under the counter. “Thank you,” he said, taking it. “Just give our other purchases to our driver.”
“I’m guessing now would be too soon,” he said, only half-kidding.
Dean grinned as he and Sam also lifted their drinks, touching them together in a toast. Slowly, his stomach was untying itself. “I’m really happy, dad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
That was remarkably coherent for an alpha that looked as blissed out as Cas did, but the faster and harder Dean moved, the louder Castiel’s moans and litany of praise and filth-bordering-on-poetic became. Dean tried to hold off for as long as he could, but the rise of his orgasm was inexorable, tearing out of him with a sharp cry while he held himself buried deep inside of Cas.
“That’s because of you. You know that, right?” He let go after one last squeeze. “Happiness is a good look on you. You deserve it.”
“Are you alright, Dean?” he asked, stroking his back.
“Why take such a risk? The punishment would have been so much worse than just taking food from a convenience store.”
Dean grabbed his half-hard dick to give himself some additional friction even though he’d just come from penile stimulation. Castiel smacked his hand away.
For a moment, just a moment, Dean had the fleeting thought that
His shoulders relaxed a fraction. “You, beloved.”
“Must have been an angel in another life.”
“I should do that,” said Novak. “I’m having a little trouble with my character’s motivation.”
“You’re sure that’s all?”
The redness flared hot, burning away the violet. “Yes.”
And then there was the way Dean’s body had reacted to that almost-kiss. What the hell was
Cas stepped in front of her and, as if predicting the movement, Naomi grabbed him by the throat with one hand, lifting him up onto his toes with her alpha strength. Dean tried to intercede, but as he reached for her, she effortlessly pushed him down onto the floor, hard enough that he slid a few inches.
“Well, are you going to be okay?”
Just being at an airport was enough to give Dean the heebie-jeebies, but he wasn’t going to waste one second of being with Sam. They hung out near the security area until he absolutely had to go.
“Guys with indigestion.” Dean wrinkled his nose. “Gassy.”
He shook his head. “A few minutes at most.”
“That’s enough,” he said, breathing hard. Dean licked his lips, chasing the sweet flavor that had leaked out, and Cas growled. “Present for me, omega.”
Time slipped away from him. Maybe he slept, he wasn’t sure. But when he opened his eyes next, he found himself staring at the crisp white ceiling of a hospital room, a steady beeping sound in his ears.
She looked up at him with disbelief in her expression, mirrored on Gabriel’s. “You’d do that for me?”
They hurried back out into the party, with Gabriel leading the way to where he’d last seen Naomi – in one of the guest bedrooms with Akobel and Adam. Castiel had been there as well, which was why it had taken Gabe a minute to find him after being expelled from the kitchen. People turned to look at them as they ran past, leaving a sea of mumbles in their wake, which was understandable since Dean was now wearing a torn and bloodstained dress and his face looked like it had taken a beating. He ignored them, there were more important things to worry about than how he appeared.
“Listen,” said Cas, “getting scouted three years ago wasn’t the first time it happened for me. I was also scouted during school, but my father wouldn’t allow me to put my education at risk and I never fought him on it. I was more into politics at the time.”
“No, I should have been smarter. Alcohol doesn’t make problems go away.”
“New parents usually don’t get a lot of sleep in the early months,” Akobel warned.
“Beloved?” he said, slowly. “What… what happened?” He touched Dean’s face with a gentle hand. “You’re hurt.”
“I don’t know why,” said Dean, half kidding. “You’re gonna end up stuck with me.”
Cas held his hand to his heart. “How does it look?”
However, he almost forgot about what they were intending to do once they were out on the street. There were people and vendors everywhere, street bands on every block, an electric atmosphere, and seeing the way Sam’s eyes lit up, like he was still the little kid he used to be, reminded Dean a bit too much of their non-traditional upbringing. When they’d wanted to have fun in the past, they’d always gone just the two of them, leaving their dad absorbed in work. There were days Dean wasn’t even sure he knew they were out. He was there… but he wasn’t. And he and Sam never really talked about it, they just carried on.
For a second, he thought Castiel might argue he was a grown man and wasn’t about to let someone who was practically a stranger feed him soup in bed, but then he sighed. “Fine.” It was clear he didn’t have the wherewithal to put up a fight.
“Dean,” Cas rumbled, cradling his face in both hands. “I got the best actor award.”
“Want me to show you?”
Then again, Sam had already been less private with his sexuality earlier in the foyer, because it was what his future mate had needed to be happy. Sam was totally the type of alpha to push his own boundaries for the sake of his partner, so maybe he
“We can do that, right, Novak?” said Dean, grinning.
Cas sucked in a breath. “You left?”
It didn’t take long before they were naked and Cas had Dean stretched out on the couch, his wrists tied above him using his own jeans as makeshift handcuffs. Upending the bottle of honey, the alpha dribbled it all over Dean’s nipples and down his abdomen. Leaning in without letting their bodies touch, Castiel licked and sucked at one nipple, then the other, circling his tongue and humming his approval.
“I promise, I would never betray your trust, Dean,” he said, solemnly.
Thankfully, Sam apparently felt he’d gotten his point across and stopped needling Dean for the time being. They did have a job to do, after all. Castiel was a wonder in the kitchen. After setting the peaches to boil in order to peel them and soaking the pecans in bourbon, he set up their apple peeler-corer and was able to multiply the recipe in his head instantly to fifty portions, telling him the exact number of honeycrisp and granny smith apples he would need.
“What? What?” asked Castiel around his mouthful, concerned. He hastily swallowed. “What is it?”
“Or will it be the best thing ever?” Dean suggested.
“It’s not that you necessarily smell like
“Let’s try something,” said Castiel. His eyes tinged violet-blue as red filamented the irises.
“Please make me come,
“Okay, go look. Go.”
“Castiel and I are old childhood friends, going all the way through high school,” she said. “So, you can imagine how close we were.”
addicting.
Desperate, he did the only thing he could think of—he called Sam. “I told Cas I would plan something for us to do on Christmas Eve,” he confessed once his brother told him to stop with the painful small talk and get to the point.
Drama… Could he source an idea from a holiday film? He’d been in a Hallmark made-for-TV movie once; his character had arranged for a message on the digital billboard in Times Square. Dean tossed out that idea as well, not only were they in the wrong state, even if he found somewhere in California to do it, he would definitely be going too far.
“You scared me,” Dean admitted, putting the melting sliver of ice into the glass it had come from. “You… your claws came out. Literally. Why didn’t you tell me you were able to drop fang and claw? I didn’t think it was even possible.”
“Not at all,” said Sam, stepping back and closing the door after him. “Come on in. Glad to have you, I’ve been saying to Dean for
Stepping forward, the omega knelt at Castiel’s feet and reached up to hold his free hand, his left. Wetting his lips, he took one last deep breath and began, “When we first met, I didn’t believe in love, not anymore. Not for a very long time. I loved my brother, but I believed myself incapable of loving anyone else in a meaningful way. Because any time I allowed myself to feel something, it was always taken from me. I was a lost boy who’d never had to grow up, who couldn’t really remember having a real home and maybe thought I didn’t deserve one. I’d learned to accept that I’d never be really happy because if I kept hoping for it, I’d only be disappointed.” He shook his head. “I was so… angry. Alone, broken, and unlovable.”
The golden-haired omega was waiting for them at the restaurant that evening, dressed in a tunic embellished with gold embroidery and loose pants beneath. Classy, but comfortable. “About time you showed up!” he said, gesturing at the hostess stand. “They wouldn’t seat me without the rest of the party—” Gabriel looked up and up at the younger Winchester and all complaints ceased. “Well, hel-
She must have heard the urgency in his voice, because Naomi stepped into the hallway moments later. Her eyes went wide when she saw Dean. “Mr Winchester,” she said, touching his shoulder. “What happened? Are you alright?”
“Usually? I work right up to the day, either on
Castiel’s brows were drawn together, his expression uncertain, his eyes the color of a cloudless sky. “Dean,” he repeated, softly.
When he lifted his head, Cas halted his movement by grabbing him by the chin and giving him another kiss, firmly, proudly. Then he nodded and Dean finished his journey back to the cushion, sliding to his knees a little lightheadedly. He put out an arm to steady himself and Cas was there, gripping his hand tightly, like he’d anticipated the move. Dean bowed his head and brought the alpha’s hand to his lips to show his gratitude, his devotion. Then he sat tall on his heels, put his hands in his lap, and rolled back his shoulders, lifting his chin to show how much it meant to him that he, Dean Winchester, was at Castiel’s side.
They only partially watched the first quarter of the finale; the rest of Dean’s attention was stolen as he was draped over the back of the couch and fucked from behind by his enthusiastic alpha. It didn’t seem like too much of a sacrifice, since they knew how the show went anyway and what Dean was really invested in was fan commentary.
“Brilliant,” said Dean. “And you could try key lime next if you don’t like how this one turned out. Okay, here we go…”
“Did you like what I did?”
“Love?” Dean repeated, incredulously. “It’s not like that with us.”
Dean whined again. “Yes, daddy, I’m sorry. Please punish me.”
Groaning, Dean began to do so despite his exhaustion, lifting his lower body to meet each one of Castiel’s thrusts. The change in angle made his cock hit Dean’s prostate again and the omega dug his nails into Castiel’s shoulders. An impossible fourth orgasm was somehow within his reach, and if the knot swelling the alpha’s dick to monster proportions was any indication, he was close as well.
He scooped them out, letting them fall over the front of the underwear. They cushioned his dick as it pointed straight out at Dean, like it knew where it was heading. Cas put one hand around the back of Dean’s head and drew him close. He began to open his mouth.
“I know you’ve visited Gabriel in the past and are still doing so,” Chuck continued. “This is probably the result of his influence. But there is no way I could ever approve of this… this infatuation! It’s sick!”
“I’m serious. Cas loves you, so you already have what’s important.” He paused. “Can I just say, this really makes me happy.”
Castiel immediately cut the cottage loaf in half and breathed deeply, exhaling on a sigh. “It’s the one he made this morning,” he said. “There’s nothing like the smell of fresh baked goods.”
“Quit staring and eat your lunch,” Dean said.
Sam: I’m really glad you decided to go to college, too. You deserve to go after your dream, man.
He startled as his phone started ringing in his hand, almost making him drop it. “Hello?”
“Thank fuck for small miracles,” he said, sarcastically.
“Yes, daddy,” he said, smiling and cuddling close.
rules? Why would they be any different?”
Castiel’s eyes lit up and he looked at Dean. “Is that alright?”
“The latter, I’m afraid.” He ducked his head slightly. “I went to college, but not for this. I was delivering pizza to the agency and they signed me on the spot.”
When he was done, Cas reached down and adjusted himself through his trousers. “Give me your panties before you fix your skirt,” he said. “You’re going to walk up to our room with slick running down your thighs. It’s possible no one will notice, but if they do, they’ll know what a slut you are.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” he said, making like he was going to unbutton his shirt.
Dean’s face had gone bright red, but he was smiling like an idiot. Being pregnant was undoubtedly hard work, but he was so happy to be carrying their pup, it was all worth it. “We haven’t set a date yet, but you can bet that the whole cast and crew of
Castiel lifted his head to look at him, his blue eyes large like a hopeful puppy. “You did.” Those eyes beginning to glow red caught him off-guard and Dean startled in his chair when Castiel grabbed his wrist and surged to his feet, all traces of exhaustion gone as he dragged the omega away from the set.
“I get that, but then why get to know him as Dean as well?”
Sam tossed the joke right back. “I will if you will.”
he could find another college to take him, which had been difficult
A hand cradled his cheek, turning it to the side so he could see Castiel’s face as he continued to thrust. “You’re so beautiful like this, Dean, that gold peeking out from beneath your lids. You look so close.” He added a twist of his wrist each time he pumped upward to the head of Dean’s length. “Feel how hard you are? This cock wants to come for me so bad. Do you hear how wet you sound? Are you dripping down your thighs? It feels like you are. God, I want to taste you, I had dreams about it, making you come on my tongue.” He thrust faster and spoke through gritted teeth. “Hold off for just a little while longer, I’m almost there. Let’s do it together.”
Dear AC,
The alpha stood, sweeping him into his arms. “I’m taking you home. I’ll send for our luggage.”
“Bast,” he said against his mouth, but he got no response. Squeezing his eyes shut, he pushed Bast away from him with great difficulty, earning an angry growl from the hunter. “Bast!” he said again, sharper. “Snap out of it!”
DoorDash bill.” He was kind of kidding, but Cas just winked at him in the most over-exaggerated way that only he could make appear sincere.
Dean hissed in a breath as Cas wrapped a hand around his cock, stroking it to full hardness. “Whose mattress is this?” he asked.
“We’ll also need parchment paper and piping bags.”
“Wow,” said Sam, breaking through the moment.
“I didn’t know you were such an exhibitionist, Cas.”
It was Castiel’s brilliant idea to have Dean join his fencing club. He needed to complete his PE credit and it was something they could do together. Aside from the obvious benefit of getting to handle a freaking
Re: Fall
At another time, Dean might have made a joke about how he didn’t share his food. Instead, he looked down at his feet and swallowed the bite with some difficulty. “What, um… we’ve never really talked about, you know… the future. Of our relationship.”
After the first week, Dean received a text around midnight, only catching it by chance because he was sleeping like shit—
“We can’t risk anything else coming out.” Putting some steel in his spine, Dean looked at him, using the dark to his advantage to hide the turmoil straining his expression. “I think we should break up, Cas.”
“What was all that about?” Dean asked when Cas re-joined him at the table.
“You’re being a creeper! No!”
I know I shouldn’t because you’re drunk and can’t make good decisions right now… but if you really were here, would you let me kiss you?
His mouth dropped open. “I thought you were asleep!”
“It’s doeskin,” Cas explained without being asked, reaching for the handle. “Give me your hand.”
“Hey, asshole,” he said, stalking over to the kitchen doorway. Everyone in the hall stopped dead in their tracks and looked at him – including Castiel from at the very end of the hallway under the arch that led to the parish hall. “Why don’t you give these people a break and do your deliveries and come back for payment later? She’s about to get married, for fuck’s sake!”
“Courtesy of our guest here,” said Dean, aiming his fork at Cas.
Dean: ok ok love u 2 bitch
He did so, holding Castiel’s shoulders for balance, while the alpha hooked a finger around the gusset of his panties, dragging them to the side. With his other hand, he grabbed the jeweled base of the plug and teased him by grinding it a little. Dean gasped and his thighs trembled.
“Yes, I’m
Cas chuckled. “Please do. Every time I go to sleep I’ll get excited thinking about how you soiled it with your slick, marking it as yours.”
“Dean, you need to stay away from me,” he said, something wild in his waxen expression. “I’ve done nothing but coerce and corrupt you since the beginning. I shouldn’t be with you; I never deserved to be!”
“You feel that?” asked Dean, his voice rough.
“Don’t,” said Castiel, leaning his forehead against Dean’s shoulder, turning his face to scent him while he fingered him faster and faster. “I want to hear you. I want to hear every little sound you make. God, Dean, you’re so hot, I can’t wait to feel what it’s like to be inside you. You have no idea how bad I want to slam in and just
He stood uneasily shifting his weight while Cas tipped the driver and collected the many bags they’d amassed that day from the trunk. Since his hands were full, Dean held his arm again as they walked into the dorm. He kept his chin high and his eyes forward, one foot in front of the other, the click-clack of his heels sounding loud as conversations stopped as soon as they approached. This time, as opposed to at the restaurant when he hadn’t noticed, Dean was acutely aware of the number of eyes on him. But no one said anything, either aware of his reputation or too wary of Cas who glared at everyone who stared. Only someone with a death wish would have called him out.
Biting his lip, Bast nodded and patted the hand on his chest, squeezing it for an extra second before letting go. “Thanks, buddy. I needed that.”
“What?”
that was being translated as rejection a
“But we’re waiting on the official wedding until after the pup is born,” said Cas, creating another riot in the room as he snuggled closer to Dean, kissing his temple gently while putting a hand over his still-small abdomen. “I’m pretty sure we just sold out next year’s Comic-Con,” he murmured.
I hope so, or I’ve been baking all these pies as mere practice and you were awake to see the dawn for nothing. What are you afraid of?
“You look so beautiful,” said Cas. “Everyone watched you walk through; it was so hard for me not to growl. I’m not used to feeling such jealousy. How did it feel to have all eyes on you?”
“I, uh, I was kinda wondering something about Pieman,” Dean said, trying and failing to not show how anxious this line of conversation was making him. He gripped his wire crust mixer more tightly than he usually would and stirred a little too hard to mix in the cold butter.
Throwing himself down on his back, Dean crossed his arms in a huff. “Fine, I don’t
Castiel’s deep blue eyes were stormy as he answered, “A warning.”
Inspiration struck. Leaving The Piehole in Sam’s care, Dean hurried out to the grocery store clutching an index card that was decades old, filled with the faded looping handwriting of their mother. Two hours later, he had a big stock pot full of homemade chicken soup. It had been fun to drag out the old pasta roller, something he hadn’t done in a long time. The steam wafting up into his face brought back hazy memories and he smiled nostalgically.
“It’s been one of the hardest things to train into you,” said Cas. “That’s why I have to make you do it.
“Thank God,” said Dean as he slid the last sheet onto the rack to cool. “I still have a few hours to sleep.” Coming around the island, he pulled Cas into a hug. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”
Castiel hurried over so quickly, it was like he’d sprouted wings on his heels. “Sure!”
Dean’s eyes went wide. “What?”
“You know what I mean. I had no idea you could love the way humans do. How did this even happen?”
“Dean.”
Anna shook her head. “Tom, we’ve talked about this—”
Apparently, it
“Nonsense,” she said. “Those protective instincts of yours were remarkable. I would have done the exact same thing.”
“Twenty-five ounces dark chocolate, same amount of white chocolate, both of Trickster’s artisanal recipe,” said Gabriel, handing over a small clipboard with the items detailed in bold, sloppy handwriting. “Sign here.”
“Okay,” he said, allowing himself to be herded into the cab of the truck. “Do I get any hints?”
was his first really big success, the thing getting his name out in the public.
Then he looked to his side and saw his alpha sitting there, looking perfectly relaxed. Cas smiled at him and reached for his hand, lifting it to his lips and then holding it in his lap, stroking the back with his thumb. Dean might not feel it yet, but he knew he was worthy in Castiel’s eyes and that was enough. He hoped that one day he could get there himself.
“Oh, you wanted us to
“He’s in his third month.”
John sat there for a long moment, looking at the tabletop, just processing. Then he grabbed his soda water and tipped it back, finishing it off. As he set the glass back on the table, he looked at it like he wished it was something stronger.
. He knew it as surely as the sun would go on rising and setting and the earth would continue to spin. The only person who could ever make him feel this way – it was Castiel.
Cas closed his eyes again but he didn’t let go of Dean. “If you’re just going to waste my time, I’ve got something I’d like to get back to.”
Bast chuckled. “You’ve gotten to know me too well.” He sighed and shrugged. “Seriously, I don’t know. This whole thing was… a lot. I really didn’t know what I was getting myself into, just like you said. But I’ll just keep doing what I’ve always done, the only thing I really
He took a step back. “I’m just watching the experts. I’ve never seen a marble rolling pin before. Only wooden ones.”
“Rami,” he said, going to him. He lifted a gentle hand to the angel’s face, turning it so his beautiful blue eyes were visible. They were full of more vulnerability than Bast had ever seen in them before. “I definitely don’t deserve it, but I know what love looks like. I know what it feels like. And what happened between us wouldn’t have, if it wasn’t something we both really wanted. Right?”
Cas kissed his mouth, slow and sweet. “You have a little nap, beloved. I’m going to fix us something to eat. I’ll bring a glass of water when I come to get you, too.”
“Your continued presence at my bar says otherwise,” said Dean.
“I’m just saying, it’s a big thing,” said Sam. “To
He didn’t have an answer.
Standing naked in front of his bathroom mirror, Dean lifted a shaking hand to his shoulder. A dark purple mark stained his pale skin, right beside his mating gland, the position deliberate and obvious. He backed away and slowly slid down the wall to sit on the cold tile, his heart beginning to pound.
“Pretty obvious. Did you never have an inkling you might be so inclined in the past?”
“Yours isn’t going away either. Pretty sure what would work?”
“Do you give me your body?” Cas asked, placing a kiss to the side of the shaft.
Re: Bread
“That’s going on sale tomorrow. Check page six.”
“The pup,” Ramiel gasped. “It’s coming!”
“Shhh,” Cas breathed in his ear, barely audible, each puff of breath tickling him. “If you make too much noise, the priest might come check on you.” He gave a firm stroke with a twist at the tip. “And he’ll see you like
Dean slapped a hand over his mouth, stopping himself from shouting. His stomach twisted as his body had a visceral reaction to this turn of events, nausea rising in his throat. Surely, Cas wouldn’t—but what choice did he have? If the evidence Naomi had was as bad as it sounded, then Castiel’s career would be over the second it hit the internet. His reputation would be ruined. It wouldn’t affect how Dean felt about him, but he couldn’t picture John Winchester being happy about their relationship if the videos got out. Besides that, what would Castiel’s family think? And if all this was going through Dean’s mind, it had to occur to Cas, too.
“Of course, I’m human,” said Dean, scowling.
“I’m not gonna rush this,” said Dean, mouthing at the mating gland on Castiel’s shoulder, making the alpha shiver. “I want you to feel good before we get the party started.”
“Alright, Sam, I get it!” he burst out. “But it’s different with him.”
“I hope so,” said Dean, as the makeup girl removed the smock he was wearing to protect his wardrobe. “I’m taller than the choreographer, so don’t let it throw you off.”
Castiel’s arms came around his abdomen, stroking and caressing as much for Dean as for himself, seeking out the movements of the pups as they jostled each other, settling back down after their mama’s sudden activity.
“Right now.”
“Alright, beloved, you can stay where you are,” Cas said, gently, giving him another warm hug. “But I’m going to need my hands to feed us. I want you to keep your head on my shoulder so that my scent will keep you calm while I can’t hold you, understand?”
“Not so fast,” he said. “You’re not leaving yet.”
Cas grinned. “Seems like it’s easier for you already.” Rolling off of the bed, he got up and walked naked to the armoire at the other end of the room where they kept their various toys. He returned with a long, black, leather flogger and held it out to Dean, who sat up. “Feel it.”
For a hot second, he thought his heart was going to fly out of his chest. It was
“How can you sound so certain?”
The next timer went off and they completed another dance with the baking sheets.
“Then this’ll have to do.” He went to their plates and picked up another bite of cheesecake, indicating that Castiel should do the same. When he did, Dean tapped the fork with his own. “Cheers. Welcome to the family.”
“Or, you know, if you get cold, you could sneak into my bed.”
“Because that thing that we found, that wasn’t my dad,” said Bast with utter certainty. “You’re right, there wasn’t anything left. The demon in me knew it, could feel it. That made the decision easy. I’m a Colt. And Colts kill demons. I wasn’t about to let one gank my best friend.”
“We are so proud of you,” Rami whispered in his ear.
And now work was keeping them so busy, they were able to talk on set and could spend their breaks together, of course, but couldn’t risk late nights without consequence. And if Cas took Dean home, then there was no doubt they wouldn’t exactly be sleeping. Not
Dean wrapped his legs around the demon’s waist. “I love you. Ah!” The change in angle had Cas’ cock hitting his prostate perfectly.
“Dean, we’re in a church.”
“How you doing, Cas?” asked Dean, bringing his hands to Castiel’s waist and running them up and down his sides.
“You think the network will go for that?”
“Hey, don’t break the wall again!” said Aaron.
“I, uh, I don’t remember, exactly. It was a long time ago,” he said, evasively, his eyes sliding away. He didn’t remember exactly
First, Dean went across the hallway to the bathroom and searched the medicine cabinet for a couple of pain killers which he brought to Castiel with a full glass of water.
“I see the dog has learned to bark at his master.”
“There’s my good boy,” he said, lovingly. “Unfasten my pants and bring me out, you’re going to take me soft.”
Lifting him easily, Castiel guided Dean onto his fully hard cock and thrust up inside, not waiting for Dean to acclimate to his generous size at all this time. He slapped a hand over his mouth, muffling his cries as the alpha gripped him by the hips and forced him to meet each one of his movements.
When the orgasm subsided, Dean nursed the cock for another minute or so, making sure to catch any remaining dribbles. He carefully lapped at the slit and sides before tucking the alpha away and closing his trousers, leaving him looking just as sharp as before, except now Castiel’s cheeks were full of color, he was panting for breath, and his eyes were striated with red.
He shut the door and swaggered around to the driver’s side. The two valets at their little key-caddy had gotten quite the show, but Dean didn’t care. They were still wearing their masks. Maybe they’d keep them on, depending on the mood by the time they got back to the apartment and if Cas was in any mindset to even remember he was still wearing one. A single look at the alpha’s lap as Dean got into the car told him that it was unlikely that he’d be thinking about much by then, especially in LA traffic on a holiday.
A shiver racked Dean’s frame and his rock-hard cock, so far ignored by both of them, jumped against his stomach. “Mine,” he moaned. “
After the knot subsided and allowed them to separate, Dean went to the bathroom for a quick clean-up (he’d already made enough of a mess on the backside of the couch that would be a bitch to get off, he didn’t want to add to it by leaking all over the seat cushions), but he returned to Castiel’s lap; they just rearranged themselves a bit to be more comfortable. Cas kept a hand on his bare leg, his thumb moving back and forth absently as they watched the rest of the finale, dipping his head to kiss Dean’s neck and shoulder during commercial breaks. It was disgustingly domestic and utterly perfect. It only convinced him further that moving in together was the right thing to do.
I’m sorry, you must feel awfully confused by my behavior. I was dropping all kinds of hints about getting to know each other and then the minute you hit me with actually meeting up I pull a disappearing act. I might act confident, but I guess when push comes to shove, I’m really a coward. I was afraid – what if you don’t like me?
“It is,” Dean agreed. “Your family should never make you feel unwanted, they should never abandon you just because you think differently. Your family should love
Castiel’s face went a shade darker, but he sounded smug as he replied, “I think he’ll kiss the way he writes. Slow at first, building more heat until we’re both melting.”
“Oh,” said Cas with a wicked smile. “Well, you already had half a mating bond, so I was pretty sure it would work, especially since you were able to reach me through prayer without my full name…” He touched Dean’s neck. “It’s visible to me now.”
“Do you, uh…” He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck, looking everywhere but at the prince. “Is there anything you’d… like to, you know, talk about?”
“Fine,” said Crowley after a moment. “Makes things easier on me. If you’re not together, then I don’t have to hold back my interest in Winchester anymore—”
“It might not work out so well if your significant other was the jealous type.”
Dean wrinkled his nose. “I’m not sure I’d want to use them for something as silly as not liking a food.”
Ugh. This guy played dirty pool. Blushing furiously, Dean let his head fall forward onto Castiel’s shoulder. “Just… one time?”
He opened his eyes to look at Cas, his face full of reverence.
“Because I’m going to have it moved to a rehab facility.”
Even with the absence of the first-born alpha Novaks, Dean couldn’t help feeling a little bit inherently nervous when Thanksgiving rolled around, considering what had happened to him the last time they had been at Naomi’s house. Especially since Dean had to be left on his own with Castiel’s siblings while the alpha fought holiday traffic to collect Sam from the airport. They’d wanted him to arrive the day before to avoid such a thing, but the moose had waited too long to purchase his ticket and the only flight he could catch ended up being very early in the morning the day of.
Dean reached into his jacket and withdrew a folded sheaf of papers. “We don’t have evidence that she threatened Castiel with the videos… yet. But we have proof about other situations.” He set the papers on Chuck’s desk. “This is everything we’ve compiled so far, everything Naomi’s done behind the scenes at the agency and before that, in the UK.”
Turning back around to buy a coffee for himself, Dean asked, “What are you thinking about while you’re playing Ramiel?”
“Your heart is beating so fast,” said Cas.
His head was spinning. The tension leached out of Dean and he melted down into the mattress in a daze. As Cas pulled back to look at him, those inhuman eyes beginning to glow brighter, Dean found himself clutching at the demon’s shoulders, not to push him away, but to pull him back
“Cas,” he whispered against the alpha’s lips. His heart was throbbing so hard, he feared it would break his ribs. “The name you want your mate to call you…” Dean felt the smile against his mouth. When he opened his eyes, he found Cas looking at him with heavy lids almost hiding the red of his gaze. Like he’d been waiting for this question. “What is it?”
“Good. Let’s sit.”
“You look great.”
Yours, Pieman
“I know. I’ll stop with the binge drinking; I know what lies down that path.”
“They sound hungry,” said Dean.
“Going all out every time like that is going to take its toll if you’re not more careful,” he said.
“That’s four fingers, Cas,” he said, feeling pretty confident at the level of prep, considering he was smaller in size than the alpha’s monster dick. Still, he felt the need to ask, “Think we’re ready for the real thing?”
swaying with the pups in their arms. Cas put his hands on Dean’s hips and began moving them back and forth like a middle school slow dance. Letting himself get swept along with the beyond-corny moment, because why not, Dean put a hand over Castiel’s and the alpha spun him out then back into his arms, dancing them around in front of their beautiful tree.
“True,” he admitted. “But this is still different. Um… so, look. I know our family’s never really been into traditional roles and stuff. You’ve always been great about letting me make my own choices.”
The baker ducked his head a bit closer, like he was imparting forbidden knowledge. Dean found himself leaning in as well. “That’s a myth,” he confided. “The real secret—”
Dear Pieman,
“So, you’ve heard of me,” said Gabriel, dryly.
Dark brows lifted. “A hint? This is new. What did I do to deserve that?”
“That’s starting to matter less and less…”
Dean’s eyes went wide. “You
“Rather, I should have had you warn Sam,” he amended. Dancing them around in a circle so that they faced the opposite way, he tilted his head backward. “Look.”
“Tell me I’m the only one who can touch you like this,” he said.
He went to Dean and assisted him back up, his body blocking the fact that he was holding tightly onto the omega’s elbow like he needed the contact. “She’s right, Dean,” he said, but Cas couldn’t hold eye contact for long, his gaze furtive and sliding away, helpless and fearful. They said everything that his words could not – he didn’t want any of this, this was forced. “I—I want this. I want to be with her. You don’t understand our relationship, it’s complicated. But you don’t need to worry. I’m fine.”
“Okay.”
“You’re fine. Me?”
“Damn.”
what happened. But Cas was
His eyes darkened as he smiled. “Many times.”
he thought, fondly. Dean handed her back the ring and said, “I’ll take them. Please wrap them without letting him see, we’re keeping our choices a surprise until the presentation.”
Cas lifted his brows at him, expectantly. Sam rubbed a hand over his face.
account, even tweeted “They’re canon, bitches!” with a gif of them kissing.
“That’s Jack,” said Cas, who then tilted the other pup upward enough to see her brother. “And this is Claire.” Their little girl calmed when she scented Dean and heard Castiel’s voice, but she wiggled and grunted, grimacing comically to show she wasn’t happy.
He paused, biting his lip as his expression crumpled, like Dean had just asked him the secret to the universe. Dean just waited, patiently, until Cas at last shook his head.
holiday season. He’s really looking forward to meeting the rest of the Novaks, too, I think because he wants to take things to the next level with Gabriel.”
“Initially, I had wanted emeralds,” said Cas, tilting the box so the gems twinkled, “but I thought these matched your eyes better.” He looked up at Dean with his brows lifted hopefully. “Do you like it?”
“The same Dean Winchester who had a new girl every week?”
Rolling them over, he put Cas on his back and began driving into him. It was definitely a lot harder than thrusting up had been, having to prop himself on his hands to do it, but Dean loved every moment. The rhythmic slap of their bodies coming together was like music, in harmony with the sounds punched out of their lungs. It took so much effort, it felt like he was cherishing Cas with his whole body, with everything he had.
Castiel’s huge hand came down again, on the opposite cheek. It covered so much of his butt’s real estate due to its size! This time he grabbed a handful when his hand landed and gave a firm squeeze.
“Almost,” he said, settling back down. He held out his arms for Dean and he returned, lying on top of him again. Cas sighed, holding him tight. “Now, it’s perfect.” Moaning, he wiggled his bottom, curling his toes into the towels. “I’m full of you.”
He rushed forward, pushing the omega against the outside of the house. The barrel barely missed the two of them, bouncing once on the concrete before cracking and coming to a rolling stop. The water, however, fell off the roof and directly on them, drenching them both to the skin. Instantly, there was chaos all around them as the tech crew scrambled and the production crew raged.
“Smelled it on you, that night at the club,” Cas answered.
Gabriel grinned. “You’re gonna do great. Deep breaths.” He took the small red velvet box that was his charge in the ceremony, and exited the bridal suite with a cheeky two-fingered salute. “See you on the other side!”
“Yeah. Or that you’d come on to him as the nearest alpha. The cameras were how we found her. Turns out Charlie, the
Castiel practically floated over to the corner of the set and Dean rolled his eyes again. What, exactly, was so exciting about seeing a twenty-eight-year-old man in a high school uniform? At least the thing fit him. If Dean had held onto his old APA uniform, it certainly wouldn’t fit him anymore; he was a lot bigger than he used to be. He eyed the alpha in the corner. He was bouncing on his toes a little and he could see a bit of the stupid-happy expression on his face. There had to be something wrong with his head if
“I never flirt seriously when I’m in a relationship, I reserve my comments for just them,” said Dean. “And I make sure I keep them happy in other ways. Not just screwing them rotten, either. I read about the love languages.”
“It was a narrow thing at times,” Bast revealed, lifting his brows. “During those fights, the power would whisper to me, that it would be so easy to give in. But that’s why I didn’t trust it. Because nothing in my life has ever been easy. So, I kept fighting as long as I had something to fight for.”
“Whom.”
“As long as you want.”
“Me too,” said Cas, breathlessly. “Missed you so damn much. Can you feel my knot already? You’ve got me all wound up this fast. I needed you… so much…” He bit his lip, clearly having a difficult time holding his climax back if the knot catching on Dean’s rim told him anything. “Are you ready, beloved? You want me to come? Gonna take my knot?”
“I’ll do as you say,” he heard Cas reply, brokenly.
