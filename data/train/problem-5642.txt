Thank you *so much* to everyone who has shared this fic with me. It has brought me so much joy to know that you are reading it and spending time in this little world. I hope it has brought you some bright spots as well, and I would love to hear what you think.
“Get the fuck off him, you goddamn cowards!” Tony was swearing up a storm as Ward and Rumlow took turns landing blows, and Steve could hear the sounds of Tony working to finish freeing himself from the chair. It wouldn’t be long before he jumped into the fight. Steve just needed ten good seconds.
“I use my powers for good now,” Wanda said with a wry smile, “like for checking up on the strange men who are lurking in our driveway.”
“Don’t fuck around, Rogers. Four,” Ward warned, and Rumlow’s hand twitched threateningly back toward the back of Tony’s head.
He turned finally to face Tony, his features smoothed into an expression that might have appeared neutral to a less interested observer. But Tony had first met Steve when he was reed-thin, pale as a sheet, and brawling with a soldier the size of a ballista. He knew the softened brow lines that meant Steve was at ease. And he knew the widened stance and angled arms that meant Steve was holding something at bay.
“Volunteer work?” Tony repeated, his eyebrows shooting up. “What, like painting on-demand murals for the FBI?”
The late end to the meeting meant even more crosstown traffic, and by the time Tony made it to the Houghton, he only had time to call up one box from special collections. He got ready at one of the long tables while he waited for the materials, running his hand through his hair to stop himself from drumming his pen against the table. Goddamn library etiquette.
“I don’t know what I’d do,” Tony answered finally. “When Pepper and I were together, I thought about trying the whole picket-fence deal. If the picket fence were a self-sustaining energy field with adaptable motion detection, of course: I’ve got standards.”
Natasha cleared her throat loudly, and Tony almost jumped. Steve blinked back at him, looking as disoriented as Tony felt. Judging by her smirk, Natasha seemed to have noticed their reactions.
Flash Thompson apparently heard, because he rolled his eyes. "Oh my god, just get a room, already," he said
“Hello everyone,” Coulson greeted them. “It’s an honor to be joining you here at Stanley College. I look forward to meeting each of you in turn, but as time is precious in the first week of classes, I’m going to call this meeting to order and then give the floor to Dr. Strange, the chair of the Faculty Affairs Committee.”
“Okay, you should not be wearing that, okay? That is a part of a special birthday gift I’m making for Mom.” Tony gives the helmet a little kiss, and then he pulls it off her head, revealing his daughter’s smiling face. Tony’s chest aches when he recognizes Peter’s smile in hers, but he can never look away from her.
“I will shred this universe down to its last atom. And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, created a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.”
Clint returned back home. Or whatever’s left of home. The moment after he disappeared, nobody’s been able to reach him.
Wanda feels something heavy inside of her. She's way past crying at this point; it's like there are no more tears to shed. But Peter is like her little brother, and the thought that something happened to him makes it a bit hard to swallow past that lump in her throat.
“Tony, please-“ At this point, Rhodey is the only one who dares to confront him. Even Steve keeps his distance while Tony is lashing out against his team. Former team? Tony doesn’t care anymore. Nothing matters, right now.
“Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe,” Drax offers while still holding on to his belt.
Let him do what he wants. She’s prepared to take it. If he ends her now, at least the pain will be over. Finally.
With effort, Hilde holds her close, forcing herself to the opening door of the ship. It’s going to take all of her strength, and she sincerely hopes that there’s nobody on the other side of the door. With slow movements, she types in the override code, hitting confirmation. When the door opens, some sort of table comes flying by, missing Hilde and Yaël only barely.
It all happens so fast, Hilde can barely even understand it. Yaël has to press her hand onto Hilde’s mouth when Thanos nears Heimdall, looking down at him like he’s nothing more than an ant about to be crushed by his boot.
Hilde looks at the ones remaining. On everybody’s faces, there’s nothing but utter shock. There’s not even time for tears, as everything happens so quickly. The baby, Raido, as Loki called him, starts crying. Nobody heads his way, all of them frozen into place by everything that’s happening.
“I thought I told you to go,” Steve points out, though he’s feeling very relieved that Vision was still there.
Today is one of those days that they’re inside, though Vision seems to have chosen to keep up the disguise, mostly due to the fact that he’s walking up to the window and is pulling the curtains open. It’s raining, nearly midnight. And despite the lovely day they’ve been having together, she’s aware of how tense Vision has been the entire time.
So she nods at Yaël, salutes at Dr. Cho who blinks in agreement. Then the first door of the lock is closed, and the other one is opened. Hilde gets sucked out of the ship almost immediately, but the tether holds tightly. Once she’s stabilized a bit, she tests out the thrusters and starts maneuvering through the debris.
Tony doesn’t have the luxury to check on Steve when he’s been thrown aside by Thanos. Surely, the Captain is fine. As are the others. He can start hearing them through his commlink, he quickly realizes. They sound very much alive.
, after all these years, they sway together like they were supposed to. But now, instead of being crazy in love with her, Steve feels different. He loves her, still. He will always love her. But he knows, now, that this was not meant to be.
“Yeah?’ he asks, turning to the door and seeing Pepper standing in the doorway. She’s wearing long dark pants and a black vest. Her eyes are sad, her face pale. She’s not wearing any make-up, which Peter can understand.
“I’m sure they’re alright,” Yaël assures him. Hilde wishes she had her optimism. Everything seems far from alright. It’s just the quiet before the storm.
That’s a hard question, because Tony hadn’t really been there during either of their births. He only met Peter when he was older, and he didn’t want to have anything to do with Morgan until he met her for the first time. That last part hadn’t been his proudest moment, but he hadn’t been in a good headspace at the time.
“Your belly?” is the first thing Loki asks. Hilde snorts despite herself. Of course, that’s the first thing the Prince of Asgard would ask about upon seeing his lover again.
But physical exercise is necessary, according to Dr. Cho. And to be fair, the only exercise he’s been having in the past few months is the mindblowing, extremely hot sex he’s been having with Steve. Because, to be completely honest, the sex is exhausting in so many ways! Tony shivers even thinking about it now while he runs, though it’s the good kind of shiver. Exhausting, yes, but still good, let’s not forget that!
After Strange is out, Tony returns from underneath his moon. He looks pissed off, as well, throwing all he has onto Thanos. Peter should join, help him, but at the same time he has to make sure that no remaining chunks of moon that will hit the unconscious guardians. In the time that he’s distracted with throwing some meteors away, the situation downstairs seem to have gotten to the worst.
“It’s Peter’s evaluation papers. From his internship,” she gasps out. Tony moves from his spot instantly, running up to the platform and grabbing that piece of paper out of Clint’s hands.
Tony grabs Steve’s hand before he thinks better of it, and the two offer each other a smile. For the first time, both of them are feeling hopeful again. It’s the thought of seeing Peter that keeps them going.
“You okay?” he asks, but she ignores him. Not even looking at him, she starts sprinting away from them as if her life is in serious danger. Tony startles when a car crashes against a pole.
“I don’t want to test it,” Hilde says after a few seconds of calming herself down. Then she finally turns around completely, finding the olive-skinned woman in front of her with a frown on her face. She looks ridiculous with that attempted bravery while being at the verge of giving birth.
“Shhh, it’s alright, Son. You did great. You did so good.” Tony gently strokes through Peter’s hair to keep it out of his face. But it’s no use. By the seconds, more and more of Peter disappears.
“You were probably not paying attention,” Bruce mumbles out. “But, uh, we started doing that after the Asgardian survivors said some giant purple man killed Thor and Loki for a piece of stone.”
“Strange,” Tony calls out distantly. The two of them haven’t been hanging out a lot in the past, mostly just short introductions and small arguments about magic, but that has been enough for Tony to strongly dislike the man.
“Norway’s got some nice views.” There’s nothing more from her, so Rhodey chuckles and walks back into the room, followed by the others. As they approach the computers Bruce and Clint finally come out of hiding, taking careful steps towards them.
“Can you stand?” Sam asks. He holds out a hand towards Vision and helps him onto his feet. A bit breathless, Vision leans onto Sam while Wanda grabs his other arm to put it over her own shoulder.
“What is it, Tony?” Steve asks as he looks down at Tony’s hand. Waiting for him to open it, Tony reveals a simple, silver-colored vibranium ring.
At last, with the great distraction, Strange finally manages to get a good grip on Thanos’ gauntlet. Everybody jumps together at once, giving their own hand on subduing the giant. Quill uses some device to pull his right arm down. Tony grabs the gauntlet. Peter throws some webs and manages to stay in place with the claws. Strange makes a portal, and at last Mantis appears from above. She’s stayed out of the fight mostly, since she doesn’t have any obvious attack-style. But right now it’s her moment to shine.
When they pull back, Wanda takes his hand into her own and she pulls him towards the door. On her way, she grabs their coats and a bonnet.
They take a little break. It’s not like they don’t have the time for it. Excusing themselves, Tony, along with Steve, Natasha, Thor and Clint all head outside and take a little walk at the lake where they can clear their heads for a little bit. They’re all out of the suits, back to their normal clothing.
Seeing the King of Wakanda being lifted up from the ground by that one guy’s telekinetic powers, Peter jumps into action.
It’s the first time she’s allowing herself to think of Peter Quill. She made him promise to kill her in case she was captured, and he had followed through. Except that it was already too late. And she knows it must have been the worst for Peter, having to shoot down the one he loves.
“And we’ll just… be normal. No more hero-business. We’ll leave it to the younger generation. We deserve a rest.”
Nebula is next on the matter of the Soul Stone, which is still the vaguest part about this all. “Thanos once held the Soul Stone, but lost it and it hid itself inside another being.” Everybody knows who she’s talking about. “It’s by pure coincidence that he came across it again, but rather than extracting the stone from her, he decided to use her as a weapon.”
“You’re right,” Steve agrees. He sighs, choosing his words carefully. “Earth just lost her best defender, so we’re here to fight”
Hilde gets on her feet after a soft chuckle. It’s been a long day, and there’s still so much of it. She should go and take a walk, breathe in some air. The air here is nice, but it’s not as much in the larger cities. That’s why Hilde often avoids New York and other places like that.
Johnny, who is looking at his hands, takes a deep breath. “I don’t-“ he starts, only he disappears before he can say anything, further. Next to him, the same thing seems to happen to Gamora who had been holding on to her waist one second, and is touching her own face the next. It’s as if she’s trying to stop herself from dissolving, but she’s failing.
“You can?” Wanda’s eyes get teary. She smiles when Shuri puts a hand on her shoulder and promises her she will do all she can to make it right. Peter looks down at that. In fact, he’s really glad that his friend gets someone back that she cares about. But Peter can’t help but feel a little bit jealous, still.
Loki, once again, transforms into Steve and repeats what he just said. Much like last time, Tony lets out another snort because of the impeccable impersonation. But quickly, Thor gags him mid-sentence as he’s transformed back into his original self.
“I can’t say that everything will be fine when they won’t. But I’m sure that, eventually… we’ll be okay-ish. One day, maybe it won’t hurt as much.”
“Ah-hahahaha! You guys are so screwed, now!” shouts Bruce in his excitement from a bit further away. Steve can hear him in his ear, and even he feels a twitch of happiness inside of him.
But Tony knows what she lost; her husband. The one she’s lost before, but found back. Tony feels for her, he really does. But that doesn’t mean that he can magically figure things out with the snap of his finger.
“Steve?” he hears behind him. When he turns around, he finds Natasha standing there with her mouth fallen open. She’s holding Bucky’s weapon in her hands, looking it over as sadness creeps into her gaze.
“Oh, we blew it,” he breathes out, the sudden realization falling over him like a wave of ice cold water once he notices the suitcase, along with Loki, are gone.
The others give him a pitiful look, all tiptoeing around the fact that two of the most important people are missing. This, right here, would be a good moment to have Bucky around, but they had to leave him in Wakanda due to this sudden crisis. A fact that Natasha doesn’t really seem to like, either.
They pretty much destroy the church. If their lives hadn’t been in danger, she would have felt more guilty about it. But even as they try to hide away at the train station they’ve been thrown in, the two creatures don’t seem ready to give up just yet.
“I’m happy for him.” Peggy smiles sadly ahead of him. “I feared he would never settle down. It’s been difficult for him as well, losing you… He’s just… dealing with it differently.” She lifts her cup as she seems to remember something. Something that probably happened after all of this.
Thor finally looks up, yet he speaks no word. Instead, it’s Bucky who calls out for him. Steve hears his footsteps approaching, but there’s something wrong.
“Our son,” comes from Yaël afterwards. Hilde smiles and notices approaching footsteps. It’s Dr. Cho who has decided to give the reunited pair some privacy. It does seem like the best thing to do, especially when they start hugging and Loki begins expressing his happiness.
In the background, Hilde is letting out a battle cry as she takes down a leviathan on her own. Peter can see purple blood drop everywhere, which is kind of a sight.
She can’t look at it anymore. She only should focus on Vision. On the ultimate sacrifice she has to make. Vision looks pained for a while, until he lets out a relieved breath and closes his eyes, as if he’s feeling free.
Tony startles when he sees two known HYDRA members enter his tower. Oh, how little they knew, back then. Rumlow and Sitwell looked innocent enough back then.
“Tony, the stones are in the past. We can go back and get them,” Steve starts then. Tony shakes his head, not able to believe that they’re back on this. There’s just no way.
Tony has been wheeled in by Bruce a little earlier. The others started a few minutes ago, though since no useful information has been shared yet, it seems like they’ve been waiting for the last few members to arrive.
Feeling relatively safe behind them, Peter sits down on the ground to catch his breath for a bit. He’s quickly approached by Steve, who kneels down next to him and pulls him into a hug as well.
Sure, you get to fly to space, and it’s probably better when you actually get to steer the thing and go where-ever you want, but being a stowaway trying to save an annoying wizard that used to be a neurosurgeon (man, those are just the worst) is
But it seems like she’s not on board. And Tony should have known asking Pepper wasn’t the best idea; she has never been interested in having kids before, after all. She doesn’t understand this need Tony has, this
And that’s when Wong starts explaining it. The Big Bang creating six elemental stones, two of which Tony has already encountered in the Tesseract and the Mind gem in Vision’s head. Wong explains how there are four more of them; the purple one for power, the red one for reality, the orange one for soul, and the green one for time – though Strange was rather theatrical of the reveal of the last stone.
Steve squints to his left side to try and see what’s going on there. Rather than thunder, it seems to be a loud – very loud and powerful – rainbow beam that lands onto the grass. All the creatures that stand too close are swept away by the force of it.
“Obviously,” Steve returns. He pulls back, though he keeps his hands onto Tony’s shoulders while keeping eye-contact. Tony can see now, indeed, that Steve has red eyes from upcoming tears. It looks like he’s trying to keep them at bay, but he’s failing a bit at it.
“I love him, Peggy,” Steve admits. “I thought he died and I- I didn’t know how I could live knowing that he wasn’t there anymore… And it made me realize that
Pepper admits she finds it scary, but she agrees with Steve; Tony wouldn’t be able to rest, knowing that he never tried
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don’t put your eggs in me!” the kid shouts. Tony almost rolls his eyes before the worry takes over. In the corner of his eye Tony can see him web the woman with the antennas up. Then the guy with the red eyes lies up, kicking Peter right in the face to stop him. Peter gets on his feet easily, unlocking the spider-arms now more easily.
By the time Steve is upstairs, Bruce is already standing next to Vision, in front of Shuri. She’s scanning the synthezoid with her beads. Kimoyo beads, Natasha whispers towards him when he gives it a questioning look.
“He probably followed his old man and snuck up that spaceship,” Sam admits before gesturing that they’re supposed to keep moving.
,” Ross counters as Rhodey takes a step back and crosses his arms. As he moves, the automatic braces whir along with it.
“I said: Rhodey, Sam and I will stay out here to stand guard. You get in with the others, maybe weapon up a bit?”
“We’ve discovered that the ship can divide itself in two. If we can get everybody to the second quadrant of the ship, she could hop into that wormhole over there and try to hide on a nearby planet.” The man points through the window, but Hilde can’t see the wormhole he’s talking about. Still, she’s sure he knows what he talks about. She’s about ready to say something else, when suddenly she can hear footsteps nearing.
He isn’t too sure who eventually starts the video, but somebody does. And it hurts to see him there looking the way he’d become in the years Peter had been gone. Like all the life had been sucked out of him. All hope.
Tony walks by Morgan’s cart. She always pulls it whenever her dads are harvesting the goods and helps them carry it back to the house. Whatever they don’t use, they sell. Under an anonymous name, that is.
“Because… we didn’t think of it,” Bruce admits in defeat. It’s obvious here that there are two smart people out here, but Shuri always seems to be the outstanding peak on the graphic when it comes to her brain.
“Hey!” he calls out to get his attention. Strange turns, looking back at him with a weird expression in his face. “You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.”
Howard smiles, genuinely, upon hearing that. “A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she’s turn out exactly like me.”
Nobody looks at him as the man gets on his feet. He joins the others towards the window. Hilde doesn’t even know this man’s name, but that’s not difficult since she’s not been in Asgard for many, many years.
She finds her staring straight ahead most of the time these days. It’s become a bit of a normal occurrence, but so far Hilde hasn’t really taken the time to ask about it.
“Not really,” Steve admits, feeling like it would not amount to anything if he would lie. Natasha would read right through it, after all.
“Not too long ago,” he admits. Finally he can hear Tony walking their way. They both pull their hands back, and as soon as Tony stands behind Steve he leans back against him. His left hand takes Tony’s, where the same golden band is rested. Sam smiles even further when he sees it.
Another tear rolls over his cheek when his eyes catch Tony’s happy smile on the picture. He looks so much younger, more carefree than the last time Peter saw him. Now he’d been grey, tired… Gone…
“Yeah, no, I gotta tell you; he’s not really my friend,” Tony says with a shrug. “Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.”
“Ooh, sounds kinky.” He can’t say more when his targets have arrived on the lower floor. God, that elevator was slow back in the day. Tony makes sure they don’t see his face until they all have their backs to him. “Thumbelina, do you copy? I’ve got eyes on the prize. It’s go-time.”
Tony smiles, thinking back of that one hot afternoon after school, where he took Peter and May to the city and they had some ice cream. Peter liked The Captain America Cookie Dough, while Tony had to secretly admit he preferred the Bow’n’Arrow Bananas.
“If I give you the stone, will you leave the others unharmed?” asks the holder of the stone. Gamora can barely see her face; her golden eyes are red from tears and exhaustion. The man next to her looks just as battered as her. His skin still a touch of blue. The child they’re holding in their arms looks to have the same tint of skin as its father.
Mumbling more than speaking, Tony explains the situation in annoyance. “Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax, can we focus, please?”
“Cap?” Steve hears from the side. It’s Bruce who is gesturing at him to come along, and Steve nods. Before he can walk off, an arm suddenly grabs his and holds him back. It’s Bucky who’s stopped him.
That’s a weird question to ask, isn’t it? When Peter’s back, Tony has to tell him about this. He would find it hilarious!
Hilde lets out a deep breath. While she enjoys the company of Sif, she’s more of a distraction than anything else. They’ve had their fun nights together, and Hilde wouldn’t mind having more of them, but the most important thing right now is the child.
Steve had been surprised after learning that Natasha and Bucky got married in Wakanda in secret. She admitted that she hadn’t wanted to make too big a deal about it. It was just because they needed a little win after sacrificing so much.
“Did you seriously just say ‘hither to undreamt of’?” Tony asks, letting out a small grunt as he pulls on his leg.
“I promise,” Yaël agrees, at last. Hilde sighs in relief when Yaël gets on her feet and lets out a deep breath. “I should pack up some stuff… for the baby, just in case…”
Oh, how things are complicated now. But at the same time, upon hearing this news, Asgard becomes delighted; after all, there’s an heir to the throne to be born. And sure, Loki might not have been Asgardian by blood, and neither is this girl, but it’s still the child of a prince of Asgard which is enough for the people to feel hope again.
Tony stops then, looking back into the trunk and then reaching for the thing that has been lingering in the garage for a bit too long.
“I’m trying to say that… something’s coming,” Peter points to somewhere behind him. Tony groans internally. How in hell was that whole egg-laying part an attempt of telling them that they have company? If they make it out of here Tony really needs to teach his kid to get to the point.
Wanda can see it in Steve’s movements that he’s getting exhausted. Despite that, he holds on to his shield, lets out a deep breath and takes a step forward.
about a father keeping his son safe. This is about the entire planet; no, universe. If they fail now, they’re going to be losing so much more.
Nebula helps him on his feet. Tony has no idea where she gets her strength, but being part machine must help with her survival. She guides him through the exit of the ship, where the lock seems to have opened. Carefully, they walk down the stairs.
Tony grits his teeth together. He had actually forgotten that it’s probably only the Avengers who would put Peter on the first place. The team would die for him, even though Peter would hate for that to happen. That’s how much they care about him.
Now Morgan starts to sob, hanging on to Pepper who shushes her quietly. Peter leans against Steve’s shoulder, knowing the whole ‘3000’- thing after Morgan explained it to him last night.
Sam, who is now sitting next to Steve, looks over the lake. There they can see Peter on a little boat with Morgan, the two of them laughing suddenly. They look like they’re having fun. Steve’s really glad that they get along so well.
“I don’t think this rig has a self-park function,” Tony then states. He looks at the steering-device, seeing two different handles that are too far apart for him to reach by himself. But there’s three of them, so it should be possible. “Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it, you understand?”
“Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?” he tries. He feels a faint pain in his side on the place of his scar, but he’s sure that’s just mostly mentally since it hasn’t been hurting for a while now.
“No, it didn’t. We lost track of her, again. Weird to imagine she had been on Earth all this time.” Nebula sighs as she glances at the picture of Yaël that has shown itself on her screen. While she has been one of her ‘siblings’ once, their time together wasn’t all that long at all. “But, Gamora kept track on her, yet she never told him.”
“By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree.” He gestures towards them with his new, larger weapon. The creature snarls at him, not looking pleased at all.
Bruce, in Stark’s Hulkbuster armor is the first one to reach him. But that’s also about it. Mid-jump, Bruce suddenly slows down, until he becomes intangible and phases right through Thanos. He only regains his corporeal form when half the suit is merge with the giant rock behind him.
The human doctor remained quiet and refrained the entire ascension to space. She’s installed her necessary medical supplies and keeps a tight watch on Yaël. Especially after she started to feel something about an hour ago.
People might be confused, about the whole 'grandmother' part, but for that explanation, you should head to the second story in the series. It's called 'Golden locks, silver arms', and it's about Natasha's past with Bucky.
But she also knows that Thanos taught her hand-to-hand combat. Forced her to learn it, more. So once she realizes that using her powers isn’t all that great of an idea, she gets back on the street with eyes glowing orange rather than the familiar yellow.
“Talk to me, Banner,” Tony adds. That usually works with him. And indeed, Bruce seems to calm down for a bit. The sleeve of his arm is completely burning away, and it seems to be affecting his skin as well.
He turns to glance back at Tony, who’s resting on the ground. When he raises his own hand, his own glove adapts itself into a new shape that allows the stones to fit onto it. Knowing what this means, Peter lets out another shout, though he’s immediately stopped by the Princess of Wakanda who seems to have realized the same thing.
“Congratulations,” Tony tells him. Howard hands him over the can and flowers, and then starts straightening his tie. “How far along is she?”
“You know, had the situation been a tiny bit different, I would have helped people realize it’s better to move on, but…”
Time goes on for a little while, yet there’s still no word of any return on Thor’s part. The weather turns colder, the season starts to change into winter. Eventually, Yaël is called away, taken to Switzerland by SHIELD for something called the ‘accords’, whatever that means. Hilde offers to go with her, but she refuses, saying she needs to see this through on her own.
Wanda can only smile back at him before Vision pushes her back strongly, making her lose her balance. Not even a second after, the creature is disappearing with Vision.
“Are you okay?” she asks when he lets out another painful grunt. She needs to get him out of here. “What? What is it?”
TW: At multiple occasions, Tony is going to admit that he's lost the will to live. It's not exactly suicidal tendencies, but it's more like he's tired of life and wouldn't mind to just die. In a couple occasions, he does get the idea to stop the things that are keeping him alive, but he never goes through with it because in the end he realizes that his reason to stay alive is Steve.
“Feel free to smash a few things along the way,” Steve adds to his instructions, this time pointing at Bruce who is trying to make himself look small.
“Has he left?” the mother asks as she guides Hilde back inside. The Valkyrie sits down on the couch after clearing it of some toys. There’s a TV playing in the background, showing Hilde some sort of program for kids. Once Raido is put back on the ground, he goes to sit down right in front of the TV with the fingers of his left hand in his mouth. Hilde gives it a strange glance before looking away.
Steve gives him another hard look, and Tony decides that he’s had enough. He reaches out for Morgan and takes her out of his arms. Without saying another word, he heads back in the house to make sure Morgan gets anything to eat. Steve can do whatever he wants, at this point Tony doesn’t even care anymore.
“Tony… we have to take a stand,” she tells him with a shivering voice. She’s next to Steve, who doesn’t seem so surprised by her emotional outburst. She’s been the most guarded of all of the Avengers, so it’s obvious that eventually, those emotions have to come out.
Tony tenses up. Right, he had heard about it, but since the whole business with the accords he hadn’t really paid much more attention to it. Besides, being the dad of a superhero is also pretty tiring business.
“I don’t- I don’t know,” Vision admits, turning towards her. Despite his human appearance, the yellow stone on his forehead is glowing through the disguise. Wanda comes to stand in front of him, taking in the glow and observing it calmly. When it lightens up a bit more Vision hisses again. Her hands quickly go up to his cheeks.
This was even before Tony knew Peter was his son. He looks back at Clint with wide eyes. “Was he there?” he asks.
Looking at this place, he figures that this feels more like home than he would have imagined a room he never entered being. It’s like Tony knew exactly how to make it Peter’s. It’s been cleaned, kept tidy over the years, but it’s obvious that other for that reason nobody ever came in here.
His voice starts breaking, emotions welling through. “Steve, I… I was hoping to pull off this one last surprise… But it looks like… Well, you know what it looks like. I mean, it’s probably for the best. After Peter… I don’t think I can anymore, Steve. I don’t have it in me.”
Tony shakes his head and fails to hold back a snort as he raises his hand. “I’m gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe – to bring back my son – is based on
A dark blue rift in space appears a bit further away from them. Wanda hadn’t even noticed Bruce to be nearby, but as soon as a large, purple-skinned figure appears through the rift, wearing a golden gauntlet, she can hear Bruce through her communicator.
“Angry, mostly. They had been at the park going for a jog when Strange intercepted them and took Tony along, according to her. She was here yesterday after the ship flew off again but eventually had to return back home.”
Steve’s grin widens and he starts trailing kisses along the column of Tony’s neck. “Maybe this was all part of an elaborate plan to get you to sit on my lap.”
That sounds good. Really good. Tony closes his eyes and pictures Steve’s baby blues in his mind’s eye. Warmth flowers in his chest.
Of course, that is nothing compared to the four bags of produce Steve is carrying. He even refuses to distribute the weight evenly between his two hands, insisting on carrying all four bags with one hand and using his other hand to hold Tony’s instead. He tries to reach around Steve in an attempt to grab one of the bags, grunting in frustration when Steve moves the bags beyond his reach. “Steve, your arm’s going to fall off. Just— Give some to me.”
“What—” Tony blinks, looking down at his own attire—or rather, the lack thereof. Having just woken up from a nap, he is dressed only in his boxer briefs. A laugh bubbles up his throat, his entire body shaking with it.
“That’s because I am,” Tony points out, more than a little bit amused. Tony has a secret partiality for this rare side of Steve—the Steve that becomes endearingly petulant and slightly nonsensical when he gets exhausted. When Steve is tired, he almost has little to no reservations in terms of expressing his feelings and desires—some of which he might usually deny himself. His possessive streak is definitely one of them.
Tony gets another sleepy hum and Steve burrows closer, the cold tip of his nose tucked behind Tony’s ear.
He plants his chin on Steve’s chest and looks up at him. Steve’s eyes are still closed. He looks unfairly breathtaking even when soaking wet, water droplets hanging precariously from the tips of his eyelashes.
Tony allows himself to relax, letting out a quiet sigh. This thing with Steve is so new and delicate that every single physical contact still sends his heart fluttering, butterflies going crazy in his stomach.
They stay like that for a while, both of them calm and content, Steve’s hushed voice counting down the seconds the only sound in the room. Time passes by slowly and too quickly at the same time, and the next thing Tony knows, Steve has reached the final ten seconds.
Steve chuckles again. His hand combs through Tony’s hair slowly, trapping soft curls in the spaces between his fingers and drawing them out. “I wanted to see how long you’d hold out. Not very long, it turns out.”
Closing his eyes, he relishes the brief yet sweet escape from reality, pretending just for a few moments that his day is blissfully empty. The work seems never-ending. The only reason he is in bed at all is because Steve had coaxed Tony to come to bed, complaining about how cold he was and steadfastly refusing to sleep without Tony in his arms.
Tony tiptoes cautiously around the studio, taking extra care not to step on any of the paintings Steve has laid out to dry. When seen from up above, the wooden floor of the studio would probably look like some rendition of abstract art, the vibrant colors on the different paintings lying on it coming together to form another picture altogether.
Steve reaches up and begins undoing his tie. After setting it aside on the bed, he begins to unbutton Tony’s shirt. He takes his time, one button at a time.
Tony’s eyes spring open. Outside, an aircraft marshaller walks by, speaking rapidly into his walkie-talkie.
“But Tony…” Steve gathers the material of Tony’s unbuttoned shirt in both of his fists, pulling him closer until their noses are only inches apart.
Tony laughs softly, his shoulders shaking with it. Still holding his gaze, he brings Steve’s hand to his lips, pressing two feather-light kisses to the back of his hand. He continues holding Steve’s hand against his mouth, and when he speaks Steve feels his lips and the bristles of his goatee brushing his skin.
In a bizarre twist of events, the person leans down to touch his forehead to the couch, still in a kneeling position. The arms are slowly stretched forward until he achieves the child’s pose in yoga, fingertips a foot away from Steve’s thigh.
Tony inhales and lets Steve’s comforting scent fill his lungs, a mix of his coconut-scented body wash and the laundry detergent they share together. It smells a lot like home.
From beside him, Steve hears the person let out a heavy sigh. He tamps down on the urge to smile, maintaining a poker face and making sure his eyes never leave the book.
Steve thinks, smiling helplessly at the twinkle in Tony’s eyes — the one that appears whenever he gets excited.
Plus, there is also the fact that Steve always turns all soft and happy without fail whenever Tony does ask for some affection.
He continues reading quietly. Although he feels a pair of eyes staring at him intently, he resists the urge to acknowledge the company.
The ringing tone goes on for a few more seconds before ending with a click, replaced by an achingly familiar voice greeting him in his ear.
The sun is shining brightly up in the clear blue sky. The farmers market is bustling with life, with people visiting various tents stationed along the long stretch of road, each offering a variety of fresh produce as well as various finger foods and cold beverages.
His gaze falls down to where Tony’s hand is still holding his, even when his other hand is gesturing animatedly as he tells his story.
When Steve leans back, his face is all confusion. His blue eyes, however, are teeming with mischief. “And what is it that I’m doing? I told you, sweetheart, I’m just a
Taking Steve’s hand, Tony turns to address the rest of the room. “Sorry folks, looks like you’re going to have to finish the movie without us.”
Tony chuckles again but Steve hears the clink of ceramic, a cup being lifted from its saucer. “Aye-aye, Captain.”
“Also, you’re right, the single blueberry muffin was a bad idea because now my stomach won’t shut up. So I’ve ordered some pasta for my in-flight meal. Robbie’s making it, you’ve met Robbie—”
Steve continues to walk toward him and Tony continues to walk backward until he feels his back hitting the wall.
“D- Don’t!” It’s all Tony can manage out. Peter puts his hand onto Tony’s chest to hold him back when he tries to move. Further away, Strange lifts his hand and brings the green, glowing stone back into view. Where-ever he had been hiding it, Peter has no idea. At this point, he doesn’t even care.
“I’ve spared enough lives, today,” returns Thanos. Peter closes his eyes and hugs Tony tightly. If he’s going down, Peter’s going with him. Tony won’t have to go through this, alone. They’re in this, together.
Only a second later he’s blown away from the small explosive that has been thrown their way. It’s a small energy pulse that gets the both of them thrown back. He can hear people approaching, then a loud voice shouting.
Steve thinks about all the things that have happened over the past few years, and he and Nat come to find an unexpected surprise.
Yaël must have seen it all happen. The pregnant woman is standing there impatiently as Hilde re-enters the airlock with the thrusters, now holding an extra weight in her arms. A weight that actually becomes heavy once the door closes behind her and gravity has returned. She comes down with a loud noise as metal meets the floor.
A knock pulls him out of his train of thought and Peter puts aside the frame while he passes his sleeve over his eyes.
“Hey!” his son greets him, for the first time in five years. Tony doesn’t have the time to react, as he’s immediately pulled back up on his feet by a very excited Peter. “Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on!”
“I should have stayed on that bus,” he mutters as a hatch closes on top of him, opening another one behind him.
Now Vision takes Wanda’s face gently into both his hands. “Only you have the power to pay it,” he tells her. Wanda yanks herself out of his touch, walking away from him in distress. “Thanos threatens half the universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.”
“You’re filthy, baby.” Chuckling in amusement, Tony squishes Steve’s cheeks together with one hand. Steve whines petulantly. “You have germs, mister. Germs. Do you want me to die of germs?”
Tony ducks down to plant a kiss into Steve’s hair and can’t help the way his own lips break into an immediate grin when he feels Steve reply with a small kiss of his own, pressed to the skin of Tony’s neck.
Tony did eventually admit to Steve that he found the café’s coffee to be subpar. He did, however, insist that the café
“Here’s fine. Don’t need a bed.” Steve’s words are muffled against Tony’s shirt, speech becoming increasingly incoherent. “Just need you.”
He leans down to kiss the tip of Tony’s nose. Tony wrinkles his nose, but he is determined to not let his glare falter.
“So handsome, even when he’s angry.” He leans down and manages to give Tony a few open-mouthed kisses, even with the odd angle. One kiss, two kisses, three kisses. A fourth one, for good measure.
Steve grunts in lieu of a reply and then proceeds to push Tony down on the bed before lying half on top of him.
“Can we cancel dinner?” Steve asks hopefully. He runs his index finger along the boxer briefs’ elastic waistband and Tony squirms, ever ticklish.
Tony’s mouth waters as he eyes the mountain of grated Pecorino Romano sitting atop the pasta. He sighs dreamily and smiles up at Robbie.
Doing exactly what he promised, he lets Steve stand still while he lathers soap all over Steve’s body, mentally cataloguing all the bruises and cuts he manages to find. He also works shampoo into Steve’s hair, massaging his scalp with the gentle press of his fingers.
His warm blue eyes hold Tony’s gaze as he brings said wrist to his mouth, pressing a lingering kiss to the pulse point. Something warm unfurls in Tony’s chest at the way Steve’s every movement screams of his reluctance to let Tony go.
“How am I supposed to get any work done if you walk around the house dressed like this?” Steve whines.
Steve steps closer, arms snaking around Tony’s waist and pulling him close. His next words are whispered against Tony’s shoulder.
“Like, if I didn’t do this today, maybe I’d never get to do it, you know? And, uh, okay, I’ve honestly been ranting to stall for time, but the longer I keep it in the more nauseous I feel, so maybe I’m just gonna do it now so I can die in peace—”
Tony’s pretty brown eyes are slightly out of focus. He pants lightly as he tries to catch his breath, slick lips parted.
Pulling Tony closer so that he is pressed flush against his side, Steve beams at him, smile bright as the sun. “I feel a lot better now. Thank you.”
his favorite, albeit for reasons different from Steve’s. Not for the bagels, not for the exceptional view of Stark Tower, and definitely
Pulling back slightly to plant a kiss on the corner of Tony’s mouth, Steve cradles his jaw, thumb rubbing his cheek affectionately. “I love you, sweetheart. So much.”
book,” Tony continues to grumble into Steve’s thighs, punctuating each phrase with a jab of his finger into Steve’s calf.
Eventually, Steve succumbs to his wiles. Tony strips Steve out of his many layers of combat uniform before undressing himself. Together, they step into the wide space of Tony’s glass shower stall, which houses a multi-jet shower system with a total of eight body sprays in addition to the rainfall showerhead that is mounted on the ceiling. Tony makes sure the water is at a sufficiently warm temperature—warm enough to become hot after a while, because Steve likes it that way—and sets the body sprays’ water pressure to a pulsating massage.
“Fuck. Shit, I mean— Uh, I’m sorry. That was super weird, huh?” Tony laughs nervously. He closes his eyes, gritting his teeth and cursing his stupid brain. Of course it’s weird. He always gets too attached to people way too quickly. No wonder Pepper was his only long term relationship. She was the only person who could put up with him—everyone else just got weirded out. “Uh, see you tomorrow? Or not. Fuck, sorry, I’m just gonna hang up before this gets—”
Except, it turns out that Steve only pulled away to slide his hands down the back of Tony’s thighs, wrapping his hands around them, and then lifting him up without warning.
Tony blinks, staring dumbfoundedly at his lonely suitcase, abandoned by the elevator. It becomes smaller and smaller with every step Steve takes.
He meets the gaze of one of the waitresses working at the café. Her long blond hair flows down to her chest and she is dressed in the café’s signature uniform: pastel orange blouse, black skirt, and a white half apron tied around her waist.
The sight brings a fond smile to Tony’s face and he hooks his fingers under Steve’s chin to drag him into a soft, languid kiss.
“Hm, that’s right. I think it was around two, three weeks before Christmas and I didn’t want JARVIS to be upset about the whole stocking thing, you know?”
Letting out an abrupt grunt and doubling over dramatically, Steve clutches his own waist and fakes a pained expression. “Oh, why is my waist suddenly so heavy?”
“Drop it, Steve. Please?” Tony pleads. Clearly, his brain hadn’t been firing on all cylinders. That is the only reason that could explain his temporary lapse of judgment. “Look, I feel like talking about it more right now is going to send me spiraling into a panic attack.”
Steve turns to him, brush in hand, face lighting up like a Christmas tree. There’s a streak of blue paint across his cheek that Tony is tempted not to tell him about.
Clint’s choice—when a heavy weight falls onto Tony’s back and the bowl of popcorn in his lap nearly goes flying. He freezes for a few seconds before registering the soft tufts of blond hair tickling his cheek. Tony didn’t even hear him approach. Perhaps he had been more immersed in the movie than he previously thought.
Tony forces himself to drag in a slow breath as he grips the arm of his seat with his free hand, focusing on the soothing hum of the airplane’s engine.
When Steve has successfully carried him to his bedroom, Tony fully expects Steve to deposit him on the bed.
He squints and frowns when instead of a building he finds a rough and nondescript sketch of a person’s face.
Steve’s head snaps up at the sound of his voice. Tony frowns. “Actually, why are you awake at all?” He is usually an early sleeper, unless—
“You know it.” Steve sighs with fond exasperation. All eyes are on Tony as he walks toward the outdoor area of the café, the nanotech suit peeling away from his body. The excited murmurs and whispers increase in volume.
round of morning sex before work—something he paid for when Pepper greeted him with a baleful glare the minute he saw her. Astute as ever, Pepper refrained from asking the reason behind his tardiness. It was hardly a rare occurrence. Besides, Tony supposes the dopey grin on his face was already enough to clue her in as to why he was late in the first place.
Steve turns his attention back to Tony, who has taken off and folded his sunglasses, letting them hang from the collar of his shirt.
“Do you want to stay with me tonight?” Tony finds the courage to meet Steve’s eyes, holding his breath.
When Tony walks into the art studio and sees the floor littered with paintings of different shapes and sizes, he whistles.
Tony engages in more small talk with Beth as she sets the cup and saucer on the table, asking after her husband and kids. There is an easy and carefree smile on his face, crinkles forming at the corners of his eyes.
Tony nods and makes a few rapid gestures with his free hand that he supposes Paul is only able to interpret perfectly after years and years of working for Tony. The gestures roughly translate to something like “Copy, I hear you, just let me wrap this up and then I’ll let you know when I’m done. Capiche?”
Steve laughs softly, not bothering to disagree. He leans down to capture Tony’s mouth in a kiss, ardent and saccharine sweet, his lips caressing Tony’s in a way that makes it abundantly clear just how much Steve has missed him.
“Sorry, baby, I can’t help it.” Tony hides a smile against Steve’s knuckles. “You’re just so pretty when you blush.”
Every single time, Tony’s figure never fails to fascinate him. Always so beautiful from every angle, in every light. Steve knows it well enough by now to be able to sketch him simply from an image in his mind’s eye.
Fresh off his latest mission, Steve is still clad in his uniform, sans cowl. The two-week-turned-one-week-mission is the reason they have pushed back Toy Story to the following week—the man has made it clear that he has been dying to watch the animated movie ever since Tony first showed him a snippet of it on his phone. Technically, this week is Steve’s turn to pick a movie, but he isn’t supposed to be home for a few more days.
He catches the moment Tony realizes Steve is still waiting for an answer, staring down at him with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
Tony walks to where Steve is lying down on the workshop couch, long legs stretched out comfortably along its length. He beckons Tony closer.
Chuckling lightly, Steve finally lets him off the hook with a kiss to the top of his head. “Love you, sweetheart. Go shower, dinner will be ready in a minute.”
“‘Cept you. You stay with me forever. Love you.” Steve nuzzles into the crook above Tony’s collarbone, inhaling deeply through his nose. Tony thinks he can almost feel Steve’s body settling even heavier against his, like he is surrendering all of his strength to plaster himself completely to Tony’s body. Closing his eyes, Tony smiles to himself as he soaks up Steve’s body warmth.
All around him, people begin to whisper among themselves with excitement, some even taking out their phones to document the spectacle. Although Steve can’t really say he enjoys the attention, warmth still blooms in his chest as he observes the approaching figure. He finds himself hiding an involuntary grin behind his hand.
Tony has seen this particular movie more times than what is probably healthy, so he focuses on Steve instead, reaching up to ruffle Steve’s hair and smiling at the pleased groan he lets out. Besides, if he is being completely honest, no movie is going to be interesting enough to fully pull his attention off of his boyfriend.
“Yeah,” Steve says, the word more breath than sound. He meets Tony’s dazed gaze. “So you don’t have to worry about… jumping the gun. Not with me. I’m in it for the long haul.”
“I… got a bad feeling. Today. A few hours ago. The feeling came to me when I was sitting in traffic, and I just— I feel like something bad’s gonna happen today, Steve. I can feel it in the air. In my heart. In my gut. In my joints.”
Tony tests Steve’s hold. Steve’s limbs tighten their hold in response. Hiding a smile in Steve’s chest even as he sighs, Tony says:
Steve makes an indignant sound of protest before using an arm and a leg to pull Tony even closer against him. He holds on tight, clinging to Tony like an octopus.
“Of course, sweetheart,” Steve whispers before planting a kiss on Tony’s knuckles, eyes holding his gaze steadily. “I’ll wash your hair, too.”
It’s well past two in the morning when Tony finally makes it to his floor in the Tower, which is why he is surprised to see Steve sitting on his couch, one of Tony’s fantasy novels open in hand.
“I couldn’t wait any longer. I didn’t want to go to sleep without seeing you first,” Steve says, low and earnest. His gaze wanders around Tony’s face, as if he were cataloguing each and every facial feature and trying to locate any changes he might’ve missed during his absence.
“Nope,” Tony says with a breathless giggle, squeezing his eyes shut and resolutely ignoring the delicious curl of heat in the pit of his stomach. “Dinner plans.”
Tony seems to have also cultivated the same habit. On nights where he misses Steve like a lost limb and the man is somewhere out of reach, touching the dog tags brings him a ridiculous amount of comfort.
Then Steve turns quiet. Tony waits, but when Steve doesn’t continue the countdown, he looks up. His husband is already gazing at him, face looking deceitfully innocent.
I just wanted to hold my husband for a moment. Can we stay like this for a while? Give me one minute.” Steve plants a kiss on the top of his head. “Please?”
“We can’t, darling,” Tony says, soft and apologetic even as he grins. “We’ve cancelled on Carol and honeybear twice already. They’ll kill us if we cancel on them again,
“No, I’m not, of course I’m not. Who says I’m freaking out? You have no proof. I am calm, I’m calm as a clam, is that the saying? Did I get it right? Or was it happy— Anyway, I am absolutely calm, I’m the calmest I could possibly be. Any calmer and I’d be asleep. I’m—”
Steve’s blue eyes are gazing at him intently, looking at him like he’s the only person in the world worth his sole, undivided attention.
The team lets out soft murmurs of greetings upon seeing Steve, but for the most part their eyes remain glued to the movie playing on the TV screen.
He hadn’t been paying attention, because suddenly there’s a little girl standing next to him, wearing a blue Iron-man helmet and holding out her gloved hand. Yeah, he bought his own merch. She made him do it after they went shopping together – under disguise, that is – and she begged him to buy it.
“That was a mistake,” they hear him say right before Heimdall is stabbed through the chest. They can hear Thor scream in anguish, the sound of it hitting Hilde right in the heart. She knows how good friends the two of them were. She just wishes that, after everything, Thor wouldn’t have to lose another person he holds dear.
Peter’s thrown at Strange, which knocks him down. His head turns for a bit while he takes off his helmet and tries to breathe in some air. There are some more explosions around him, and he hears Tony flying around. Of course, his Dad would never let anything happen to him.
“Please tell me you didn’t meet some old ghosts from the past?” Tony asks him. He hurries inside the little cabin full of supplies, and Steve follows right after him. They close the door, and wait for a little second.
Tony then clears his throat, hand going up to scratch his hair. “Yeah, that’s the thing,” he starts. Bruce gives him a worried glance.
“How are you doing?” she asks without looking away from the people of Asgard. Their ship has only just crashed down on this open field – lucky for that! – but there’s no doubt that soon some special forces or security will come down to check on the commotion.
Tony points at him with a nod, and Clint nods in return. The man looks tired, different from that carefree guy who loved to tease Peter all the time. Peter enjoyed spending time with Clint, Tony knows.
Clint pokes her in the side, and together they walk away, leaving the unconscious girl where they know their past selves will find her again. If everything goes well, they’ll have her filled up with the stone again in no time. They head back to where they came from, and wait to meet up with the others.
“Hey,” she greets him. Tony blinks at her, once, to tell her he heard her. Pepper smiles sadly. “FRIDAY?”
“Might wanna use it,” he says instead. Tony is beyond answering that. He goes to stand at the corner of the street, sneaking a quick look around but turning back when a giant pink sign only barely misses him. He sees it flying away into the air until it crashes against a few cars.
“I just… I need to concentrate here for one second,” Bruce returns. Huh, Tony wouldn’t have expected
“Hello, Brunnhilde, my name is Phil Coulson, I’m an Agent of SHIELD.” The man puts a dark hand onto his chest as he introduces himself. A prosthetic, she sees. Primitive technology, but probably considered high-tech on this planet. Hilde leans her elbows onto the table, moving her head closer to Coulson’s.
“Wow, you are a seriously loyal piece of hardware,” Tony mutters out in a low voice, feeling as if the cape is looking at him despite it having no eyes.
“I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t eve know if you’re… if you’re still… Oh God, I hope so.” Tony rubs at his eyes. He’s too tired to fight the tears at this point. “Today’s day twenty-one? Uh, no, twenty-two. You know, if it wasn’t for this existential terror of staring into a void of space, I’d say I’m feeling better today.
“We won, Dad. We won. We won, you did it. You did it.” Peter is sobbing through his words, leaning forward and hugging him in his sadness. Tony wants to return the gesture, but he just can’t do much else other than lifting his left arm and putting it on Peter’s back for a couple of seconds.
Annoying guy hands Thanos the cube. The purple giant looks at it with some sort of wonder in his eyes before he crushes it with one bare hand. There’s a short blue blast, followed by Thanos blowing the dust away.
Steve rolls his eyes and scoffs, though he can’t help laughing as well. When he returns his attention to his book, Tony moves to sit down next to him.
Disappointment goes through her when the half hour comes to an end. Hilde feels her heart sink a bit. The bitter truth is that there’s nothing else to do; she gave it a shot, but found nothing.
Fighting alongside Peter is at the same time the best and the worst thing. Mostly, it drives Tony a lot to go all the way and even more whenever he sees somebody trying to hurt his boy, but at the same time the worst thing is to see Peter being thrown around the place like he’s nothing but a piece of toy.
Rather than answering, Thanos uses the last of his strength to manipulate the space stone, and disappears into another rift. Thor’s weapon drops down on the ground with a loud chunk, the sharp part of it covered with purple blood.
Peter frowns and looks up. This is an Iron Man suit, except it’s not Iron Man. It’s a blue suit, and the one holding him is definitely a woman.
“My boyfriend prevents me from cutting it off,” Steve jokes. He holds up his hands, as if to ask ‘what can you do about it?’
Despite having Tony’s permission to return to the team, Steve stays at home and spends some more time with Morgan. Tomorrow, she’ll go back to Pepper and Happy’s, so he’s probably just trying to get as much time together as possible.
“I literally pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my Dad…” Tony hesitates when he notices Steve standing a bit further away, holding his thumb up to indicate that he succeeded. “…did.”
“We gotta turn this ship around,” Strange breathes out while trying to get up. Tony pulls the helmet back, making his way to the controls and finding nothing that even slightly looks like anything on Earth. It’s still easy enough to understand the basics of it, he thinks.
“I don’t know, it’s not even like it’s something consistent; it’s just some bad feelings. That’s all I can make from it.”
Tony bites his lip for a moment and lets out a deep breath. “My old man was hard on me, too. I never really thought he really…
His words are followed by a loud noise. One look over, and Tony feels all hope fleeing from himself. By Thanos’ ship, thousands and thousands of his soldiers have come to join them on the battlefield. Tony recognizes skinny squidward and the big guy from his fight in New York and already dreads having to face those two again.
“Are you yawning?” he asks. The two look back at him. “In the middle of this, while I’m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?”
“Sorry, honey,” Tony says when Beth eventually leaves to take another table’s orders, his smile soft and affectionate. “You were saying? Running was uneventful?”
It could be anyone to the untrained eye, but Steve’s pen strokes are sure and confident, having rendered the same jawline countless of times.
“Just a cut,” Steve whispers, leaning into Tony’s touch. When Tony’s worried frown stays in place, Steve turns and plants a soft kiss in the center of his palm.
“I told you things would go smoothly, you had nothing to worry about. You’re a brilliant negotiator—”
Tony stares absentmindedly out the airplane window as he puts his phone up to his ear, watching people run back and forth, performing last-minute engine checks. Some of the guys look sweaty and out of breath.
“Look, Steve, as much as I’ve missed you, I’m kind of tired right now. I mean, don’t get me wrong. This whole carrying thing? Great. Very romantic. Ten out of ten. But I’m just not in the mood for sex, you know? Like, I’m not even sure I would be able to get it up if—”
“It’s not like I do this every single time. Besides, why take the elevator when you have a flying suit? That’s just ineffective.” Tony makes a face as he pulls his chair out.
After what seems like forever, the man finally plops his head down miserably on Steve’s lap, mashing his own face into Steve’s thighs with a grunt.
“Hm?” Tony’s eyes are glued to his armor as he circles it to inspect the damage from all angles, the suit looking slightly worse for wear. Nothing that a little tinkering and a new paint job won’t fix, but the real problem lies within. He had experienced a brief glitch with his right repulsor mid-battle and he is hoping that he will be able to pinpoint the source of the problem immediately after JARVIS finishes running diagnostics.
Tony yelps, and in his alarm, promptly locks his ankles around Steve’s waist. When Steve begins moving, Tony quickly wraps his arms around Steve, resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder.
Not that Tony is complaining, of course. Tony is definitely not complaining. The shorter Steve’s missions are, the sooner he comes back home to Tony, allowing him to ascertain with his own two eyes that his boyfriend is safe and sound.
“But there’s always a place for you to sit, sweetheart,” Steve croons, voice all soft and honey sweet. He curls an arm around Tony’s waist and draws him closer, fingers stained with dried paint of different colors resting on the small of his back. Steve nuzzles his stomach and plants a feather-light kiss on the spot just below his sternum. He looks up at Tony with a child-like grin. “Come sit on my lap?”
for the coffee, but because the café was a place full of memories. His memories of the two of them, his memories of
“So…” Steve begins with a deep breath as he unbuttons the final button. “Did you mean, uh, what you said to me? On the phone?”
“Right back at you, mister.” If Steve notices the way Tony’s voice has gone thick with emotion, he doesn’t comment on it. Tony pats his cheeks lightly. “Come on, let’s dry up and go to bed.”
“No, Tony. I don’t want you to die of germs, because I love you,” Tony says, his voice an octave lower than usual. It’s a hilariously poor attempt at mimicking Steve’s voice, but it’s worth it for the way Steve’s eyes wane into happy crescents, for the way his lips twitch with the effort of holding back a smile.
Just to give his hands something to do, Steve flips to yet another page even though he hasn’t been able to follow the story. He struggles to regain his focus, too busy tracking his companion’s every move.
“Nightmare?” Tony gives him a sympathetic smile. It wouldn’t be the first time. In the early days of their friendship, Tony and Steve would sit together in the living room whenever they had trouble sleeping, talking to each other until the sun came up.
“Please don’t call me before a flight and say that you think the plane is going to crash, ever again.”
The café had been Steve’s favorite café, at first. He visited the place often, especially during his first few weeks in the twenty-first century. He developed a fondness for their sesame seed bagels and the lovely view of Stark Tower from his favorite outdoor table, although the latter is a fact Steve would never admit to Tony even on pain of death.
Tony extricates himself from Steve’s hold. Steve glides his fingers along Tony’s arm as he does—determined to get his fill of physical contact until the very last second—and it ends with him catching Tony’s wrist just before Tony is about to stand.
Tony reaches for the bags again only for Steve to catch his arm and bring it back down. “I’ll be fine, sweetheart. I’m a supersoldier.”
“Mr. Stark, we’re ready to go.” The pilot—Paul—emerges from the cockpit, staring at him in anticipation.
Then he pulls Tony close again, gently placing Tony’s face back in the crook of his neck. Steve rests his head against Tony’s and sways their joined bodies together slightly from side to side, humming a slow love song that Tony knows he has been listening to repeatedly for the past week.
“Go back to sleep, Mr. Stark-Rogers,” Steve mumbles. Tony closes his eyes obediently, slipping back into slumber with ease, a smile on his lips and a newfound lightness in his bones.
Tony remembers that day very well. They were in the middle of dessert at Tony’s favorite Italian place when they received the call to assemble—something about giant lizards wreaking havoc in Central Park.
“I am,” Tony confirms. He used up the very last drops of his own just the day before and the new bottles JARVIS has undoubtedly already ordered to replenish his stock have yet to arrive.
Steve’s warm hands slide up Tony’s naked back under his open shirt, sending goosebumps breaking across his skin. Tony buries his hands in Steve’s hair and relishes the feeling of the soft strands caught between his fingers. They stay caught up in each other for a few moments, capturing and releasing each other’s lips until the need for breath becomes too unbearable.
“I need you to know that… I didn’t have to date you to know that I loved you. I figured that a long time ago.”
“Really?” Tony says distractedly, his attention on Beth who is once again approaching their table with his cup of coffee, black as midnight.
Instead, Steve turns around and begins walking backwards towards the bed before sitting down on it. Tony, still seated on his lap, swallows and pulls back slightly to look at Steve.
Coming up with nothing, he pads over quietly to the desk and sets the mug of Steve’s afternoon tea down on an empty space between a wooden penholder and a Stark Industries memo pad. Looking up at Tony from his seat in the plush leather office chair, Steve’s frown deepens.
“Yeah,” Steve says quietly, “nothing really interesting.” He admires the way sunlight turns the tips of Tony’s dark hair into a lighter shade of brown. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re still the highlight of my morning.”
“Please, Beth. I told you to call me Tony.” Tony reaches up to slide his sunglasses a few inches down the bridge of his nose, giving her a disapproving look that makes her chuckle. “And yes, please. Thank you.”
He only realizes just how truly famished he is after taking his first bite, and proceeds to finish the rest of his meal with gusto. Afterward, he spends the majority of the remaining flight time sleeping, the result of post-carbonara food coma and his sleep-deprivation finally catching up to him.
They break apart eventually, accompanied by soft chuckles. Steve smiles up at him, lips slick and cherry red, courtesy of Tony. He reaches up to caress Tony’s right eyebrow with the pad of his thumb, fleeting and affectionate.
“You ignored me.” The words are mumbled into Steve’s sweatpants, bitter and accusatory, Tony’s breath warm through the fabric.
Tony lets the hands he has on Steve’s waist slide up to his shoulders, thumbs caressing the jut of Steve’s collarbones.
“Forty, thirty-nine, thirty-eight…” Eyes closed, Tony focuses on Steve’s voice and the steady rise and fall of his chest as he breathes.
Turning around in Steve’s arms to take a proper look at him, the ends of Tony’s lips are tugged upwards in a disbelieving grin.
“Anyway, so yeah. Where was I? Oh, right. Feeling. Bad feeling. Like, like, I don’t know, something bad’s gonna happen. Like an accident. Like a plane crash.”
“Larry’s replacement after he resigned. Gotta say, I was sad to see Larry go. Guy worked for me for seven years. But then there was that thing with his grandma, and he had to leave, so… But! Robbie makes a mean carbonara, maybe even better than Larry, don’t tell Larry I said that—”
From the comfort of the air-conditioned Stark Industries private jet, he feels a slight twinge of sympathy for the people having to suffer in the humid summer heat.
“I am so, so sorry, my love.” Steve laughs softly. He covers Tony’s nape with his hand, thumb caressing the side of his neck. “Turn around? Please?”
only been together for a week. Well, eight days. In fact, we’ve only been on one date. And it was interrupted. By giant lizards.” Steve chuckles incredulously.
It has taken years for Tony to be entirely comfortable with asking for affection in such a blatant way, but over time he has learned that doing so—actually communicating his needs and wants—has actually done wonders for their relationship. He desperately needs some loving at the moment—the end-result of a long day of all work, no play, and the worst of all: no Steve.
Steve reprimands, but finds himself unable to say anything further, not when the back of his neck is heating up at the memory of what they were up to just a few hours ago. While Steve immediately showered afterward and headed straight to the café, Tony decided he wanted to sleep for a few more hours, promising to join Steve later.
“You did a great job today.” Steve’s fingers are still pressing into his neck in slow, circular motions. “You worked very hard at the office. I love you.”
“...Yeah?” Tony says, hyper-aware of how breathless he sounds. His heartbeat is ringing in his ears. Everything is going to be fine. Right? Right. The worst thing Steve could do is… break up with him.
Over the years, Pepper and Steve have cultivated a monthly routine of sorts. They have a standing date—sans Tony—whenever Pepper comes over to visit. Bonding over Tony’s antics and the intricacies of fine art, they get along pretty well, much to Tony’s surprise and delight.
Steve remains quiet for a few heartbeats as he lies on the bed, eyes gazing at Tony like he is trying to sear the image of Tony’s face into his memory, like he doesn’t already have the rest of their lives to do exactly that. Steve is looking his fill of Tony just because he can, because he wants to. It’s one of his favorite things to do, Steve once told Tony.
objectively true, you know. In order for me to be able to see you tomorrow, the plane has to land safely, and unfortunately, some things are just beyond my control. Like, who’s to say the plane won’t explode mid-air and—”
Steve looks down, avoiding Tony’s eyes in favor of staring at the cookie crumbs next to his half-full cup of coffee that has long since gone cold. His cheeks are still burning, and Tony’s words are not helping.
Steve frowns, squinting at Tony, sleep still heavy in his eyes. “It wasn’t bribery. It was… a gesture of appreciation.”
Steve lets out a defeated sigh, stepping back with a pout. “I hate it when you’re being responsible.”
Tony freezes after having taken a few steps into the room, wide eyes blinking in bewilderment and a mug of hot tea in his hand. He racks his brain to figure out whatever sin he has committed to make Steve’s face crumple up like that—sandy brows furrowed and the edges of his lip tugged down into a displeased frown.
“You can’t sleep here, sweetheart.” Tony chuckles, patting one of the arms Steve has around his shoulders. The material of the uniform feels rough against the skin of his palm. With his current position, the edge of the couch must be digging into Steve’s stomach in an unpleasant way. “Let’s get you cleaned up and head straight to bed.”
All the while, his fingers are fiddling with two sugar packets Steve knows he will only use one of. He is always buzzing with energy, parts of him always in a state of perpetual motion, finding it near impossible to stay still.
He loosens his tie and sinks deeply into his seat, closing his eyes with a massive yawn as he listens to the ringing tone. He hadn’t been able to sleep very well throughout his five-day stay in Tokyo, too anxious about the contract to rest properly.
Tony bends down obediently. Steve reaches up to cup Tony’s cheeks in his hands, leaning close until their noses are brushing against each other.
Tony glares up at him, unimpressed. Steve smiles down at him, pressing his thumb down on the lines between his downturned brows.
knew that my husband looked beautiful today.” Steve pulls back, cupping Tony’s cheeks and looking down at him. “And would you look at that,” Steve says, voice hushed with something akin to awe, “I was right after all.”
“Then again, I think these seats in particular were Pepper’s choice? We remodeled the airplane’s interior like… two years ago. I couldn’t be bothered to meet with the airplane seat people and I just told her to pick whichever looked best. I had much more important things to tend to, like sewing up the holes in JARVIS’s Christmas stocking.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut. “You are so corny,” he says, in the hopes that his remark would distract Steve from his burning cheeks. Years of being married to Steve and the man can still make Tony blush like no other. He just doesn’t understand how Steve can make all these sappy declarations sound so sincere, so genuine. Like he’s just stating an indisputable truth.
“The meeting went well, by the way. Mr. Watanabe finally signed the contract, everything went as planned. My ride to the
“There may have been… some flowers involved. And some cupcakes and… bagels sent to her office, along with a—” Steve breaks off to yawn. “A very sweet and carefully worded handwritten note.”
Steve reaches for Tony’s arm and secures it around his own waist. Tony glares up at his husband and removes his arm from said waist with a sigh.
The object grows larger, approaching at a high speed. It morphs into a blur of red and gold that streaks across the blue sky right above them, sending a gust of wind that ruffles the waitress’ blond locks. The figure lands a short distance away from the café with a distinct metallic
“Beautiful,” Steve whispers in his ear, warm breath tickling his skin. A fleeting kiss is planted on Tony’s cheek.
Letting out a surprised yelp, Tony lands on top of Steve’s body. Steve grins smugly before tilting his head to growl playfully in his ear. “Caught you. You’re trapped now. Good luck escaping.”
He reaches up anyway, cupping Steve’s cheek and tracing the line of the wound with the side of his thumb. Steve blinks down at him, slow and languid. He is already struggling to keep his eyes open, eyelids heavy with exhaustion.
walk like this around the house all the time. I just woke up, honey.” Tony chuckles, hand coming up to bury his fingers in Steve’s hair, massaging his scalp lightly. “Go and finish your paperwork.”
Tony grins helplessly at his husband’s unfairly adorable antics, leaning down to nuzzle the top of Steve’s head fondly.
From the corner of his eye, Steve notices the way the person looks up, presumably trying to gauge Steve’s reaction while still maintaining the ridiculous position.
Steve hums sympathetically, gradually stopping their swaying. His hand comes up to massage the back of Tony’s neck. “Rough day?”
“Uno. Okay, good job, Captain. Let me go now.” Tony tries to wriggle his way out of Steve’s hold, but Steve’s limbs remain unyielding.
He finally manages to make his way to where Steve is sitting, stationed in front of an easel carrying a piece of stretched canvas which has been painted with streaks of red and gold. He looks around and frowns at Steve. “There’s no place to sit. There’s barely any place to stand.”
that perhaps the bad feeling I got was due to my severe hunger and sleep deprivation. I mean, I’ve heard about hallucinations caused by hunger or exhaustion, but this was—”
Tony huffs, a fond smile on his lips. Another flake of popcorn hits him, bouncing off his stomach and landing on his thigh. This time, Tony doesn’t even bother gracing Clint with a glance.
The art studio is always in some state of disarray and it drives Tony up the wall sometimes, if he were being honest.
It has been seven years since Steve first sat at this very table and sketched the figure of Stark Tower looming before him. Beth is still working at the café, having made her way through the ranks. Now a co-owner of the café, she has developed a friendship of sorts with Steve and Tony — both of whom she claims to be her favorite regulars. Tony likes to joke about how she probably says that to
Breaking into a chuckle, Steve sets his book down on the end table beside the sofa and buries his fingers in Tony’s hair, scratching his scalp lightly.
As he flips to another page, he feels the sofa dip down with extra weight. He sees movement in his peripheral vision, but doesn’t bother turning his head to take a look. Someone has plopped down on the other end of the couch.
“Look, I’m trying to be brave and honest here and— Wait, actually? Maybe I’m being a coward because if the plane actually
“Anyway,” Tony takes a deep breath and puffs his cheeks out with the exertion of his exhale, “I called because… I got a feeling, Steve.”
“Iron Man,” the waitress clarifies, lips quirked up in a knowing smile. “A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by.”
After a few minutes, he resigns himself to the harsh reality of a busy day and moves to roll out of bed. Except the minute he tries to do so, his body moves further back toward the center of the bed instead of the opposite. Tony blinks at the arm tucked firmly around his middle. A warm weight is plastered against his back, a puff of breath tickling his ear.
“Sap,” Tony remarks, but proceeds to sit down sideways on Steve’s lap, his legs perpendicular to Steve’s. Spotting the smears of colorful paint staining the floor and the painting supplies scattered all around the studio, Tony clucks his tongue in disapproval. “You know this is going to take forever to clean up, right?”
“Oh. Did I?” Steve asks, still maintaining his ridiculous charade. “Sorry, sweetheart. You know how forgetful I am.” His thumb migrates down to Tony’s bottom lip, as does the gaze of his blue eyes. “I
Tony allows himself the luxury of melting into Steve’s arms, relishing the way the solid warmth of Steve’s hold squeezes the tension out of his own muscles.
“We are.” Steve inches closer, nose brushing Tony’s. He then tilts his head ever so slightly and takes Tony’s lower lip between his, kissing him so tenderly Tony’s heart feels like it’s about to burst with it.
“Please just go check on your food or something,” Tony mumbles miserably, voice muffled by his own hands. “It’s probably burning.”
Tony strokes the arm Steve has around him soothingly. “Pepper’s going to have my head if I don’t check off at least half the things on my to-do-list today. You want your husband to stay alive, don’t you?”
“I know, I just…” Steve stands up, shoving his hands into the pockets of his sweatpants. He ambles over before coming to a stop right in front of Tony. “I wanted to see you.”
He turns the water back on afterwards, letting the soap suds disintegrate. Even after their bodies are rinsed clean of soap and grime, they continue to stand there in the middle of the shower stall, indulging in the pleasant pressure of warm water against sore muscles. Tony rests his forehead on Steve’s sternum, arms holding him close.
Steve’s face is grimed with dirt. There is a cut on his right cheek that Tony knows is going to heal completely come morning.
“Picasso?” The sunlight streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the studio illuminates the entire room. From the doorway, Steve’s blond hair gleams golden.
“I’m sorry, Tony, I know you told me to drop it. But— I feel like if you did mean what you said, I owe it to you to… set the records straight.” When Tony opens his eyes again, Steve is looking up at him, blue eyes solemn.
have a hug?” His question is polite, but his arms are already outstretched, demanding a hug from Tony like it’s his God-given right.
One of the corners of Steve’s mouth hitches up in a lopsided smile that Tony has grown incredibly fond of. Amazement swims in his baby blues.
Steve lets out a displeased sigh, but eventually he straightens up groggily. Tony stands up and rounds the couch to actually get a good look at him.
Tony stops dead in his tracks after he walks through the door into their bedroom, the sight on the bed giving him pause.
When Tony finally arrives at the table, he bends down to plant a kiss on Steve’s cheek. “Good morning, beloved.”
Steve looks around to confirm Tony’s observation and laughs sheepishly. “Sorry, guess I got carried away.”
“Table’s yours as long as you like,” she says before disappearing into the indoor part of the café to relay the order. Steve knows she means it, too. She’ll make sure of it, just like she always has for the past few years.
He only allows himself to open his eyes when Tony gets distracted by some pigeons, immediately launching into a spiel about the one time he was attacked by a pigeon who was apparently really determined to steal his sandwich.
“Well, no. I also wanted to do this.” Steve promptly hooks his arms and legs around Tony and pulls him down.
“You can’t expect me to get any work done after seeing you like this,” Steve says, almost mournfully, nuzzling the delicate spot under Tony’s ear and sending a shiver down Tony’s spine.
When the water hits his skin, Steve groans audibly. Tony runs his hands soothingly up and down Steve’s sides.
“And I guess, I just called because I… I feel like I need to do this before the plane crashes and I die a violent and fiery death.”
Eventually, Tony pulls back for air. He cradles Steve’s face in his hands, staring straight into his eyes.
Tony hangs up and lets Paul know that he is done with his phone call. The jittery feeling left over from his call with Steve refuses to leave him, however, so he pulls up the drawing application on his phone and begins sketching something just to give his brain something else to fixate on.
Which makes, in retrospect, his abrupt love confession—as truthful as it was—that much more insane. God, Stark. Never do that again.
“Did you know that Tokyo is number nineteen on the list of cities with the worst traffic congestion in the world?
“Where have you been all day? I haven’t seen you at all today,” Steve says—almost whines, if Tony is being completely honest—from where his face is still buried into the skin under the collar of Tony’s shirt, seemingly reluctant to move.
Upon seeing the date and time on the clock, the first thought that crosses his mind is of the numerous tasks he has to finish that day. He sighs a long, drawn-out, and heavy sigh. He hasn’t been feeling his best for the past few days and he has the horrifying suspicion that even his ultra-workaholic self is teetering on the edge of a full-fledged burnout. Between SHIELD, Stark Industries, and the Avengers, he has no shortage of work to do. This is definitely not the time for burnout. His only saving grace for the day is the fact that Pepper has allowed him to come in the afternoon.
The person then proceeds to kneel on the couch, now fully facing Steve. In his attempt to bite back laughter, Steve reads the exact same sentence five times. He can practically feel the disapproval radiating from the far end of the couch, but otherwise his intruder continues to stay quiet.
“I’m sorry, my darling.” He takes Tony’s earlobe between his thumb and forefinger, pulling on it gently. “Turn around so I can give you kisses?”
Tony hums noncommittally, tilting his head at the sketch and giving it one last look before leaning back in his seat. “How was your morning run?”
