“Well, with an offer like that, who am I to refuse? Welcome to your new home, darling. Make yourself comfortable. And by comfortable, I mean I want you naked for me.”
A piece of leather was slid beneath Steve’s body and wrapped around his waist, fastening above the cage. A second strap was drawn between his legs. A slim curved vibrator was slid inside of him before the strap was fastened, holding it securely in place, pressed firmly against his gland. Steve immediately started shaking his head rapidly, knowing what was coming next. “No. No, please Tony. I can’t. I can’t stand it. It hurts. Please.”
A few more thrusts over his prostate with the vibrator, and it was too late. He felt his cock pulse against the metal of the cage, pleasure rippling through his body, and dripping out of his cock in a seemingly unending stream. He finally collapsed onto the bed, switching off the toy, and rolling onto his back, completely relaxed for the first time in a week.
Tony slid an arm around his back, pulled him close and allowed Steve to hide his face against his chest. “I know you still miss him.”
Steve, having experienced Tony’s games before, immediately shook his head. James studied him for a moment, head tilted quizzically to the side. A slow smile spread over his face, beautiful and just a little bit wicked, causing Tony to immediately harden in his pants. “Sure alpha, I’d love to play a game.”
Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve been able to update. Hope this chapter was worth the wait! Let me know what you think in the comments!
“But you can take it for me, can’t you? This is a punishment after all. We can’t have you enjoying it.” Steve nodded, a flush climbing his cheeks as he felt his cock begin to stir. Tony felt a wave of fondness. This Steve was absolutely perfect. Everything he had wanted from the man he’d known simply handed to him. “Good. Let me get the rest set up. You just relax.” Tony connected the other end of the tube to the bag of saline containing the personalized Extremis virus and hung it from a hook above the bed. It would be a lot for Steve to take, but he was looking forward to watching him struggle with it. He could have used less liquid to deliver the compound, but Steve suffered so beautifully. Was so willing to take everything, that Tony couldn’t resist.
A small sound drew his gaze back up as Tony drew the chain from around his neck, unlocking the cage, sliding it off and setting it aside. Steve's cock throbbed to life as Tony began to move inside of him, thrusts slow, drawing nearly all the way out before stroking deep in a single movement, eyes locked on his the entire time.
Turning his back on the city below, Tony settled on the sofa, idly sipping his drink. His eye glowed a vibrant electric blue as he used Extremis to access the internet. It took seconds to navigate to the Omega Commission website. A little longer to find what he was looking for. It wasn’t a well known fact, but there was a quiet offshoot of the OC that specialized in supplying matches for unique individuals. Those who bore a mutation or enhancement of some form that would make a baseline human unsuitable as a match. Which was exactly what Tony needed.
Stark had simply waved away his arguments like they didn't matter when he tried to explain that this was too much. Steve didn't need an entire floor. He didn't need a bed large enough to have a tasteful orgy on. Or a bathtub... Okay, scratch that, having a bathtub big enough to actually fit his entire body into for the first time since the serum was nearly a religious experience. But the rest seemed far too excessive.
Something soft and velvety rubbed over Steve’s lower lip before pressing inside. The taste of the strawberry exploded over his tongue. Slowly and gently, Tony fed him a selection from the plate he had brought downstairs. Delicate bites of fruit, pieces of cheese or sausage, small bits of bread. As it went on, Tony lingered. Fingers tracing the shape of Steve’s mouth, or over his lips. Allowing him to lap juice from his fingertips or suck gently.
Tony pressed deep, fingers rubbing over Steve’s cervix. Instead of the painful sensations the spot had evoked before, this time it sent a wave of painful pleasure rushing through Steve’s body. He released with a cry, the orgasm taking him completely off guard. His passage continued to flutter around Tony’s fingers as he rubbed testing circles against the overly sensitive area. Steve panted and squirmed desperately.
“I’m not like you, sweetheart. I’ve got a little more than a glorified clit between my legs.” Tony ignored the gasp of outrage and continued. “Besides, I think you’ve gotten a little too used to rubbing on it whenever you want. Need to train you out of that.”
The first few days of meetings Steve wandered the city, picking up souvenirs for his friends and marveling at the differences. London was big and loud and so much better after its recovery from the war. He made sure to take a picture with the blue police box outside the Earl's Court tube station, knowing that Tony would enjoy seeing it later.
Natasha pursed her lips and studied him for a moment. "I'm assuming this is a case of new and overwhelming, not him coercing you into things you don't like?"
He let out a quick breath, finally meeting Steve's worried gaze. "I've been working on stabilizing extremis for some time now. I finally started getting somewhere a few months ago, but I decided... To spend some time ensuring it's suitability."
"Yes, Tony." Steve reached into the box again, pulling out a slim prostate vibrator, setting the remote to the side, lubing it up, then easing it inside himself. Immediately his cock tried to harden, sensitive and needy after so much longer than usual without release.
He braced himself for a blow, but nothing came. Instead Tony squatted down in front of him, so he could look up into Steve’s face. He reached up and tenderly brushed the tears away, like Bucky used to do when he was overwhelmed and beaten down in the past. Before he was taken away. “I know it’s not the same. And I know it’s not what you wanted. But I’m your family now. We have each other. And I’m not going anywhere. I’ll never leave you, Steve.” He pulled Steve out of the chair and curled him into his lap, holding him tightly. “It’ll get better. I promise. And I can introduce you to some of the people I know, and their omegas. You can make some new friends, so you won’t be lonely. You’re not alone anymore.”
It took several long moments for Steve to realize that both sensations had stopped. Gentle hands were stroking over his back. He focused past the pounding of his heart in his ears to hear the soft murmur of Tony's voice.
The table turned back over, Steve laying on his back once again. Dr. Stark came to stand in front of him again, a pleased smile playing over his features. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. I’ll get you home. Get you sorted out.”
“Don’t worry, sweetheart. I won’t be neglecting anything today.” Tony picked up a pair of heavy silver clamps, connected by a thin chain. After carefully positioning one of them around his nipple, he let it snap shut, digging into the tissue and putting constant pressure on the gland underneath. Steve could already feel himself start to leak as the second one was just as purposely placed and closed. A small latch on the side of each one locked it in place. No matter how much he struggled, they wouldn’t be coming free.
"I..." He sighed. "I went to talk to him in his lab, after I found an entire art store up on my floor."
The reaction was instantaneous, pink climbing over his cheeks, his eyes blowing wide until only a thin ring of blue remained. This was the right call. Steve wanted this. Desperately by the looks of it. Tony grabbed one of the water bottles, holding it down and urging Steve to drink his fill before setting it aside and filling a plate with the variety of dishes. Tony turned in the chair so he could watch Steve as he alternated feeding the both of them.
Just a note: this is extremely bad BDSM etiquette. I’m playing with my own A/B/O rules, and making up medical necessity to justify my dirty porn. Tony is coercing Steve at best, and it’s DubCon or NonCon at worst. However, in this universe it’s for his own good and necessary.
"I appreciate that. A lot. It's hard to get used to someone wanting to take care of me and spoil me. He sent me to a spa today. Because he wanted me relaxed for this weekend. I mean, how ridiculous is that. Me hanging out with all the pampered trophy wives. But it's also kind of nice. To feel cared for like that."
“Yes, alpha.” Steve was expecting a hard palm to land on his offered ass or thighs. Instead two fingers smacked down firmly against his exposed hole. It barely stung, even after Tony repeated the strike several times in a row. But Steve felt tears slide down his face regardless. His entrance burned and stung under Tony’s fingers, the sensations heightened after his glands had been so thoroughly worked earlier. It was terrible and overwhelming. And somehow still made him want to come. Or release. Or whatever it was that his body did now.
Almost as though he knew what Steve was thinking, the alpha wrapped a hand around his cock, squeezing for a moment before stroking over the hard length in tandem with his movements. The bulge of the alpha’s knot was slowly growing, tugging against Steve’s rim on each thrust. Soon it would be locked inside of him, the alpha’s come buried deep, marking him up on the inside. Steve continued to fight against the restraints, desperate for them to give, allow him to escape. He wasn’t used to holding back his pleasure, knew that despite what he wanted, he would reach release soon. The alpha would ensure it.
Tony turned away from the monitor, wincing at the motion and pressing a hand against his wrapped ribs. So Captain America and his shadow were safely in Wakanda. How nice for them. For all the Rogues really. To have a safe place and trusted people to take care of them. He shouldn’t care. It’s wasn’t as though any of them had wasted a thought on how Tony would survive a broken suit in Siberia, or how he would make it back to New York. If he’d make it back…
"Okay." The familiar sensation of metal closing over his skin was a welcome relief. The click of the lock meant he was secure, nothing could touch him where he still throbbed and ached. The weight of the cage was soothing. "There you go, baby. All better now."
"I was wondering if you'd like to go. As my date. There'll be a lot of press there, so I understand if you're not ready for that yet. But I would love a chance to show you off. Show you a good time. The kind with clothes on."
Steve leaned in, rubbing his cheek against Tony's cock, inhaling the scent of him, before he began lapping at the head. He parted his lips and slowly slid his mouth over him, moaning around the flesh filling his mouth. He loved the taste of him, the weight on his tongue. The way his lips spread around his girth. One hand rested on Tony's thigh for balance and the other reached up to cup his balls, weigh them in his palm and gently massage them.
Steve obediently sat down on the edge of the bed, attention still on the confident movements of his alpha. Tony reappeared moments later with strips of sky blue silk. Without a word, he moved behind Steve on the bed and began winding the material firmly around his forearm. When the first side was suitably bound, the other arm was folded over it and secured behind his back. Once his arms were immobilized, Tony guided him into the center of the bed before using the silk to secure his calves to his thighs.
Steve followed him into the bathroom, not needing to be told twice. They spent far too long under the hot water scrubbing each other to rid their bodies of the last traces of slime. When they finally emerged, Tony flopped back onto the bed, exhausted.
The only downside to the episode were the words Tony whispered in his ear when they separated to work for the day. "Laugh it up, baby boy, you're going to regret this later." Which left Steve with an entire day of training, paperwork, and coordinating with SHEILD, while wondering what exactly the other man was going to do to him that night.
Steve went limp, nearly fainting, as every throb of the alpha’s cock drew a shuddering aftershock from him. He couldn’t stop the whimpers, as every shift or twitch wrung more pleasure from his spent body. Finally they were still, his alpha’s strong arms holding him close. A petal soft kiss was placed on his lips, and he turned into it, desperately wanting more of the gentleness. Tony kissed him until he was dizzy, floating somewhere beyond his body where everything was peaceful and calm.
Tony waited until Steve’s gaze drifted to meet James’, before sliding the final toy from his pocket, along with the remote for the prostate massager. He clicked it to the first setting, then set it aside, knowing that the moaning from behind him would keep Steve’s attention, allowing him to work unobserved. It was a simple design, but cruel in that simplicity. A plastic tube that sealed against the skin, with a metal crank at the end to steadily increase and hold the suction. At the top was a small button to release the pressure. Tony was fairly certain that it would make Steve lose his mind. And possibly make James come from the sight and sounds alone.
Steve tore off his clothes in record time, hoping to buy himself some mercy. Heavy shackles closed over his wrists, holding them crossed, then raising them over his head, high enough that only the balls of his feet were resting on the ground when Tony pressed a button on the wall. He paced around him in a circle, eyes running possessively over his body.
When Steve managed to blink open his heavy eyes, he was back in the penthouse bedroom, Tony’s arms wrapped tight around his waist. He tried to press closer to the other man, but his limbs felt like lead. He must have made a soft sound, because his alpha was moving, turning Steve to face him, tucking him into his chest. It made him feel safe. Protected.
This wasn't how a friend took care of another friend. Or at least it wasn't back in his day. This was how someone took care of his fella. Did Tony think of him that way? He'd never said anything, but in Steve's limited experience that wasn't unusual for Tony. He didn't talk about his feelings. He didn't even like having them. Well, Steve was not Tony. He did have feelings and talked about them when need be. And right now, he needed to talk to the resident genius to figure out what was going on. Since he spent most of his time in his workshop, that is where he assumed the older man would be. Steve took the elevator down to the workshop and walked inside. He had noticed that he had free access a while ago but had chalked it up to being team leader at the time.
Tony reached beneath him, fiddling with the metal straps that surrounded his balls. When he was done there was a hint of weight pulling on him followed by a vibrator kicking to life. Steve cried out, tried to jerk away from the the sensation but it followed his every movement. There was dull pressure against his hole and inside of him, another vibrator kicked to life against his prostate, the sensation barely registering through the numbness.
Once he was paying attention, Steve realized he felt flushed all over. And unbearably aroused, as though his alpha hadn’t taken him apart thoroughly both that morning and before they’d gone to sleep. His hole was spasming uncontrollably around the plug holding in his alpha’s come, and slick was slowly trickling from around it and dripping down the backs of his thighs. A sudden bolt of pain radiating through his abdomen had him doubled over in agony, stealing his breath, as a series of cramps rolled through him.
And wouldn’t that have made it easy for everyone else. No more pain in the ass billionaire to deal with for new weapons and tech. But hey, they had a king for that now. No one needed him anymore. For anything. Which was fine. Stark men were made of iron.
“That’s how you want it then? Alright baby, don’t say I never give you what you want…” Tony began to pound into him relentlessly, proving immediately that he’d been holding back in the past. Each thrust was deep and savage, wringing endless screams of pleasure from Steve’s throat. Every time he thought he couldn’t take any more, that Tony couldn’t drag any more pleasure from his abused body, he was proved wrong. Time passed in a blur as Tony moved inside of him, knot slowly swelling, popping in and out of his swollen hole with every thrust, until finally it had grown too large. Tony forced the bulge back into Steve’s spasming passage just as it reached its full size, locking them together. He continued thrusting forward, unable to pull free, but still needing to move.
"That's what I thought. I had been planning to tease my good little sub all day then make him come on my tongue tonight. But that's not going to happen now, is it?"
Natasha saw him when he got back to the tower and immediately dragged him up to her floor for vodka and gossip. The second she got him on her couch, she was dropping down next to him and demanding answers. "Okay, Steve. Spill."
A few minutes before seven, there was a sharp knock at his door. Steve opened it to see Tony leaning against the door frame holding a large bouquet of red roses. He slowly looked him over from top to bottom before meeting Steve's eyes with a grin. "You look good, Cap. Here, these are for you. Thought you might like 'em."
It took Steve a few minutes to find Tony. He was sitting on the couch, asleep. His head was resting on the back of the couch, feet propped up, one hand trailing towards the floor, his fingertips nearly touching the cement. He still had a tablet resting on his lap. His face was softer, more relaxed when he slept. He looked almost innocent in a way that Steve had never seen before. It made his fingers itch for paper and pencil, and he knew that he would be drawing this moment later. Tony looked soft and touchable. Made Steve realize that he wanted to touch him. He slowly drew closer, fingers reaching out to brush gently against Tony's cheek. Large brown eyes slowly blinked open. "Steve?"
There was a brief pause before something soft and warm began stroking up his arm, over his chest. Little fibers that tickled the skin they passed over. Was it fur? Caressing his thighs, circling over his knee, then sliding upwards over his cock, hints of sensation through the holes in the metal that made him moan, arch up, wanting more even as it moved away.
A soft metallic sound drew Steve’s gaze down to his own cock, where the cage had just released. Tony pulled his fingers free from Steve’s body and set the remote down, before gently easing the cage off and setting it on the nightstand.
"It would indeed. Any other questions, feel free to give Pepper a call. She knows the ins and outs of the collection. If you'll excuse us, I promised to show this beautiful man a good time."
“I used to think so. Not so sure anymore. The things Bruce had to do to get my glands healed up and working? I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. Took longer ‘cause I’d been through heat.”
“I’ll need to examine him. I can give you a more definite answer then. In the meantime, I’d recommend keeping him restrained, so he doesn’t hurt himself. Suppressant detox tends to make them volatile.”
“You… Had cancer?” Steve blinked rapidly. That had been the last thing he’d expected from the entitled man sitting beside him.
Steve whined as he was urged to straddle Tony’s lap and sink down onto his cock. He clung to his shoulders, slowly rising and lowering, guided by the hard grip on his hips. He tried to angle the thrusts so they’d rub over his gland, press against his prostate, and Tony allowed it, but it still didn’t bring him release. Eventually Tony took over,thrusting up, pounding deep inside of him. The burning pleasure Steve recognized as building to a release washed through him, and he tensed, straining to reach it. But again, it stalled out, leaving him hard and wanting.
But he did indulge himself a little as the meal went on. Bites of food from the fork were replaced with feeding him by hand. Steve made a soft happy sound, tongue lapping at his fingers, curling around them in the most sinful way. He nuzzled into Tony’s hand, allowed himself to be petted and spoiled. After their food was finished, Tony stayed in the chair, wanting to hold onto this moment with Steve for a little longer. He continued to stroke over his hair for a while, before becoming bolder. He let his fingertips trail down the side of Steve’s neck, and was rewarded with a soft mewling sound. As he continued to trace random patterns over the sensitive skin, he became aware of Steve shifting slightly on his knees, the touch making him struggle to remain still. Tony noticed a spot just below Steve’s ear that seemed slightly swollen to the touch. When he rubbed gently at the area Steve whimpered, shuddering and clenching his hands into fists on his thighs. An interesting reaction. Definitely something to be explored in the future.
Tony continued to comfort him as he watched Steve slip the rest of the way under and float away. He held him tight, and placed soft kisses across his face.
Tony had been working on a new project for the last few weeks. Steve didn’t understand exactly what he was trying to accomplish, but it was consuming a large amount of the genius’ time. He didn’t complain. Simply continued to bring down meals for him and enjoy spending time in the same space. After finishing a sketch of the robots playing catch with spare parts, Steve had settled into the threadbare cushions and drifted off to the sound of Tony’s voice.
Steve didn’t wait a moment before launching himself out of the chair and through the door into Tony’s room, his mind already filled with horrific images of the other man hooked up to machines and barely clinging to life. Which was why it was such a shock to burst into the room and see him sitting on the bed looking… Fine. No visible wounds. No blood or bruising or machines. Just normal Tony.
"Stop." Tony's breaths were coming a little faster, obviously just as affected by the scene. "Remote. First setting. Turn it on."
Steve rested against Tony's shoulder, watching as a stocky man began setting up a variety of ropes onstage. Off to the side a slender man with black curls was kneeling, covered in a green silk robe, head bowed obediently. As he watched the dominant man move confidently around the space, he began to seem familiar. Something about the low tone of his voice, the gestures. He had the strange feeling that he knew him from somewhere.
“It doesn’t matter.” Steve shrugged, chewing on his lower lip nervously. “I mean, if you’re asking what I’m used to, I’d say nothing. The SSR demanded that I rise above my biology. Since the serum didn’t make me an alpha, they were bound and determined that I would not act like an omega. I can… I can do that again. It’s fine.”
He leaned forward and spoke in a dark rough tone against Steve's ear. "You've been so good for me tonight, baby. Think you can be good for a little while longer?"
Reaching into the nightstand, Tony retrieved a bottle of lube, coating his fingers, rubbing them against Steve's entrance. First one finger, then another, gently stretching and preparing his lover, before drawing back to slick his cock.
The last couple of weeks playing with his anonymous Sir had been fun. Sexy and creative. And he was certain that the mystery man was a terrific person. But he wasn’t Tony. And when it came down to it, that was who he wanted to be with. The way he was frozen in the hallway, unable to leave the other man’s side until he knew he was alright… It wasn’t fair to anyone else.
Tony’s fingers wrapped around the metal, squeezing it tightly as he leaned down to devour Steve’s mouth again. None of the sensation could penetrate the thick metal. He whined, rocking up desperately into Tony’s grip, and the older man allowed it. Leisurely exploring his body as Steve chased any hint of pleasure.
Steve sobbed through his orgasm, his body trying to clamp down around the overlarge plug and the liquid stretching him open. Tony continued to stroke him, enjoying the way his pet twitched from oversensitivity.  The way the tears flowed down his cheeks. When he started to pull away, trying to escape, Tony twisted a hard hand in Steve’s hair, holding him in place. “I’m being very generous with you right now. You will thank me, and stay where you’re supposed to.”
Steve was beautiful in his submission, relaxing into himself and seeming at peace for the first time that night. The amount of trust he was giving to Tony was breathtaking. Once he had him more settled, Tony needed to find out more about omegas, what their needs were. And then he’d do his damndest to provide.
Tony gently rubbed over his back, stroked his hair. “It’s alright, sweetheart. I’m going to take care of you. Give you what you need. I promise, you can trust me, Steve.”
“You’re alright. Almost done. Now we get to the fun part.” Tony’s eyes glowed, and the cage released. As soon as Tony slid it off, his cock began to twitch and harden. Steve moaned as Tony wrapped his hand around it, moving over the length in slow, even strokes. “That’s right. Just enjoy it. You’ve earned it, pet.”
Then Tony was moving back, pressing his lips against Steve's in a last gentle kiss. "Don't touch yourself."
When Steve woke the next morning, he remembered the way he’d acted the day before, burning with shame. He’d been so weak! And pathetic! He couldn’t understand what had come over him. Tony had locked his cock in a cage, and he’d sniveled at his feet in gratitude. Even now he could feel himself throbbing in the tight confines.
"Definitely kinking on that blush, baby." Tony stroked gentle fingers over his cheek, a soft smile gracing his lips. "Alright. I've been a bad, bad man and made my sweet boy suffer all night."
His omega. The thought made him stop for a moment. He finally belonged to someone. He had an alpha. Who desperately wanted him, even if he was damaged. At least, that’s what he kept telling Steve. But this was Tony. Before anything else they were friends. So why would Tony lie to him? If this was all part of SHEILD’s plan to keep Captain America functioning, wouldn’t he have just told him as much from the start?
"Good boy. Such a good boy for me. I think that deserves a reward." Tony pulled him into another kiss, this one deep and filthy. His hands began roaming over his chest, flicking and pinching his nipples roughly before pushing him down onto the bed.
Tony reached out and brushed his fingers against the warm metal, chuckling as Steve's hips bucked forward at the sensation. "Has it been hard?"
Even when he was working, Tony still stopped to check in on Steve, make sure he was alright. See if he was still enjoying himself. He introduced him to a few of the guests, assorted art collectors and critics, and one young artist who gave him a card for a gallery displaying a few of his works in SoHo. As much as he enjoyed himself, he was still relieved when they were in the limo on their way back to the tower. Tony just curled him in close and held him during the ride, keeping his fingers twined through Steve's on the ride up to the penthouse.
“Yes, I had a chance to look over your file. You seemed bound and determined to build yourself a following. Overthrow the alpha patriarchy and all that. Do you know why it didn’t work, Steve? Because you’re the only one who feels that way. Probably because you spent so long drugged up and denying your natural instincts. Omegas don’t want to riot in the streets and demand their rights. They want a good alpha to choose them and care for them. You were always going to fail. Do you understand?”
He returned to his meal. "Well, Bruce is a good friend, and he obviously cares about you. So, I'd like to get to know the person he's dating."
He stroked gentle fingertips over his cheek. "No. You should be thanking me. Now you don't have to struggle so hard to obey. It's not your choice anymore. Come on. Let’s get both of us cleaned up. I want you to stay here tonight."
Steve went limp beneath his touch, staying there as Tony moved across the bed, retrieving a box from the side table that he hadn't noticed earlier. He watched as Tony pulled out a complicated tangle of metal. The front was recognizable as a cage, like the one he normally wore. Attached to it was a curved metal bar with a large round ball on the end.
The metal of the robotic cage was moving again, shifting to clamp down ruthlessly around the base of Steve’s cock, forcing him back from the edge and holding him there as he sobbed into his stretched arms.
Tony nuzzled into the bite mark, licking and sucking at the torn flesh, his hard cock grinding down against Steve’s soft one. He could feel his body move, pressing up to meet each thrust, muscles tightening as he came closer than he could remember to release. Then Tony was pulling back, moving away, and he was left writhing on the bed, unfulfilled need pounding through his body.
Steve buried his face against Tony’s legs, arms curled tightly around himself, afraid to reach out. He didn’t want Tony to push him away. He held himself still, trying to muffle his own whimpers. Tony stepped back and Steve broke completely, sobbing hysterically. He’d failed. His alpha was leaving. He’d finally come back, and Steve had chased him away. Likely for good this time.
Sob after sob shook his frame. He couldn’t breath. His lungs didn’t want to work. He needed… He needed comfort. Alpha. Tony. “J-JARVIS…?”
When he walked into the lab with a plate, Tony was shutting down all of the screens. No music was playing. The silence was unnerving. “Tony? Is everything alright?”
The next thing he looked at was medical information. Which covered a lot. He decided to start easy and work his way to more complicated topics. Castration and caging in omegas. He found articles documenting when the process started, as well as the benefits. Higher sex drive. Reaching orgasm from internal stimulation easier. Lower chances of miscarriage… Steve put a hand over his abdomen. He’d never allowed himself to think about having children. With the way he lived his life, it wouldn’t have been safe. But now… Things were different. Could be different. He shook his head. That was something to think about another time.
Steve couldn’t help the whimper that fell from his lips when Tony slid free from his body. He was immediately pulled back into his alpha’s strong arms. “What’s wrong, honey? Tell me.”
Steve bit back a whimper. If this was Tony starting out easy, he couldn't even imagine what he might do to him in the future. The slaps started again, slow and hard, this time over the sensitive skin of his inner thighs. Tony moved constantly, sometimes high on his thigh, others nearer to the back. He never knew where the next strike would come. He could only tense and wait for it, moan and rock his hips against the bed, desperately praying for relief from the unrelenting arousal that Tony was torturing him with.
He swore as Steve’s hole fluttered and squeezed tight around him, thrusting a few more times before burying himself deep and coming inside of him. The throbbing shaft pulsing inside of his sensitive passage was enough to make Steve release again with a soft cry. Tony ground against his rim, circling his hips enough to draw out the pleasure, on and on until Steve thought he’d lose his mind from the intensity. Eventually they both stilled, panting into the silence of the bedroom, and his body had a chance to calm.
“I should make a plug for you this exact length. Stuff you with it and watch you lose your mind every time you move. I could spank you like that. Make you run for my entertainment. You’d be begging for my cock after that, wouldn’t you?”
“They did a lot of testing. Were hoping the serum would make me an alpha. The SSR was incredibly disappointed when I went into heat.”
Instead of the longed for pleasure, Steve felt the slide of metal closing around him from all sides. He tried to struggle, but between the handcuffs and Tony sitting on his legs, he couldn’t get enough leverage to get away.
When he finally received the report from Extremis indicating that the entirety of the virus was absorbed, Tony gently tapped Steve’s cheek, getting his attention. “Almost done, alright? And then you’ll have one less you owe me. Okay?”
Strong arms slid beneath him, lifting him off the floor and carrying him to the bed. He shook with the force of his sobs, gasping for breath behind the gag. Steve kept his eyes squeezed tightly shut, not wanting to watch Tony walk away. His chest ached. He could feel the jagged pain of his heart breaking. And he deserved it. Steve had been so certain he was right, that he fought every kindness that Tony offered. Pushed him away. Afraid of being weak. Of being wrong.
It made Steve angry, hearing them talk about his alpha like that. Implying that Tony would get drunk or bored and toss Steve aside. It also made him uncomfortable. Nervous. As opposed as he was to the idea of bonding, he still believed it to be for life. He couldn’t imagine getting sent back to the Commission. Branded a failure. Caged up, body longing for his alpha, and handed off to anyone willing to take a previously claimed omega.
Tony lay there, listening to the soft breathing of both sleeping men. His arms tightened around both sets of shoulders, a surge of protectiveness rolling through him. Steve had one arm beneath Tony’s back, the other resting on his stomach, finger’s still twined with James’, face tucked into it’s customary spot in the side of Tony’s neck. James rested with his face buried against Tony’s chest, other arm curled around himself, as though defending himself even in sleep. Occasionally his hand would twitch in Steve’s grasp, hinting at the terrors that still haunted his dreams.
Steve nodded hesitantly, unsure of what was going to happen next. He watched Tony move back across the workshop, in direct view at all times, which made something inside of him relax. Tony wouldn’t hurt him. His alpha would keep him safe.
“Of course. It’s one of my favorites. Steve absolutely hates them. Just so you know. So, for every time you don’t succeed, one of us will work Steve to the very edge of release, and the second he starts to fall over, all stimulation will stop. Might even need a bit of pain somewhere sensitive after a while. His body will still release, won’t be able to help it, but he won’t receive any pleasure from the experience. After a while, it might even start to hurt. But, because he is still experiencing stimulation and release, he’ll also experience oversensitivity after each one. It’s a terrible thing to do to someone. Especially more than once. Understand?”
"Such a good boy for me, Steve. Why don't you finish waking up, take care of anything you need to, and meet me in the bedroom down the hall. Okay?"
"Yeah. Why don't you take care of me for a little bit. Would you like that?" Steve nodded, still refusing to let go. "Okay. Go fill up the bathtub, pick one of the oils or salts from the cabinet, something you like, and add it to the water."
Eight days after the bonding, SHEILD called them both in for a mission. Steve felt strange, walking into the conference room with the rest of the team. Tony sat beside him for the debrief, a hand resting on his thigh, which was nice. But before he knew what happened, they were in the middle of a fire fight.
All the attention made him feel lightheaded, as though a part of him could float away from his body. Steve tripped over his feet as he was led back to the bedroom and tucked under warm blankets. He dimly heard the rustling of clothing, and was asleep as soon as Tony’s bare body slid into the bed against his own.
Steve stumbled up the stairs to the street only realizing how long he’d been on the subway when he noticed how dark it had gotten. His stomach chose that moment to grumble loudly at the lack of food he’d eaten that day. Scanning the street, he saw a hot dog vender and spent his last few dollars on a meal for the night. Spotting an empty doorway mostly hidden in shadows, he tucked himself in the corner to devour his food. The last thing he needed was to draw the attention of a drunk alpha looking for a good time.
When Tony finally captured his lips, Steve moaned eagerly, legs falling open. He felt his alpha settle between them, and spread them further, needing to feel the heat of him thrusting into his spasming passage. The thick knot spreading him wide and easing the unrelenting need burning inside of him. He whimpered when the plug was pulled free, a gush of slick soaking the blankets beneath him, then screamed when Tony gripped his thighs, pulling him closer and sealing his mouth around Steve’s tender hole. Tony’s tongue thrust into him, swirling around his entrance then plunging deep. Rubbing over his sensitive glands until Steve thought he would lose his mind. Instead of easing his desire, every release Tony pulled from him only made it worse. Until Steve was writhing mindlessly on the sheets, struggling to free himself from the alpha’s grip. Make him stop tormenting him and give him what he needed.
Steve crawled off Tony's lap and onto the bed on shaky legs, spreading his thighs and bracing his forearms on the mattress, head hanging down. Tony pressed behind him, kneading his ass cheeks, pulling them apart. Wet heat flicked over his hole through the silk, causing him to jerk forward and moan. Tony's grip stayed firm, holding him in place, tongue lapping over him and occasionally dipping inside.
As if it was the permission he needed, Steve gripped the cage, pulling at the edges, squeezing, trying to force it to give, release his aching cock. He struggled, writhing in Tony’s grip, the pressure building in his chest driving him crazy with want. He sobbed in desperation as the sensations climbed higher and higher, almost like the buildup to orgasm. No matter how hard he fought to get the cage off, it didn’t budge. His hands fell helplessly to his sides as the feeling of weakness overwhelmed him again, hips churning against Tony’s lap as the tension rose in him until it finally broke.
Bruce continued in a professional tone, ignoring the outburst, hands sliding up to pinch Steve’s nipples and squeeze his breasts. “Responses normal. Fully developed here as well. Good.” His hand moved to squeeze Steve’s cock, exploring the length and rubbing a thumb over the head, before dropping down to cup his balls, weighing them in his palm. “Genitalia is overdeveloped for an omega. He was probably put on suppressants before he started puberty. Not the worst case scenario, but not the best either. I would highly recommend having him fixed. It’s a simple procedure. I can do it under an hour, if he’s thoroughly emptied beforehand. If he heals like my James did, he’ll be fully recovered before the anesthesia wears off.”
Steve felt his cheeks burn as he dropped to the floor, crawled over to kneel at the other man's feet. "Tony, Tony please! You're driving me crazy! Please!"
Steve buried his face against the smooth fabric of Tony's shirt, cheeks flushing. "I just want you. Always. All the time."
A pleased grin curved across Tony’s mouth. “Oh this is going to be fun. Roll over. On your back now, give me room to work.”
Sunset Bane was dressed in a sparkling designer gown, holding court at the far edge of the dance floor. Steve slowly made his way over, stopping to scoop up a champagne bucket filled with mostly melted ice. As soon as she turned to face him, he unceremoniously dumped the contents over her head. Ruining hair, dress, and makeup all at the same time. The unearthly shriek she let out was so piercing that all noise in the room stopped, everyone’s full attention on the scene she was making.
Steve nodded. “Yes… An omega is… Trained. Not to touch. Especially after mating. Only the alpha gets to decide. It’s another way of showing they’re claimed…”
A low mechanic humming started, followed by a slick length stroking into him, drawing back, then pressing forward again. A slow steady rhythm. Tony moved into his line of sight, kneeling next to him. "Do you like it, sweetheart? I built it for you."
Tears slipped down Steve’s face as Tony worked him roughly, fueling the ache in his core that never truly went away. “You said… You said it would feel good!”
It was too much after weeks of denial. His body felt swollen and hot. Used. He felt Tony pressing on the end of the plug, pulsing it inside his body. He could feel another orgasm building, slowly. It felt like his body was burning, starting deep in his groin and slowly spreading out through his body, locking his muscles and stealing his breath.
"Be a good boy, and I may even let you come outside of the cage tonight." Tony laughed at the small whimper that followed his words. "Okay, stand up. Let's get you dressed."
Tony’s eyes lit up again and screen on the wall responded, replaying the security footage from Steve’s living room a few days ago. He watched as his body writhed on the floor from the onslaught of painful pleasure that he could remember all too well, before arching up and screaming Tony’s name in the throes of his release. Steve turned away with a painful blush, his cock throbbing in his cage, trying to make it’s presence known.
Tony took a seat in the closest chair, studying him. “Now, are you going to let me feed you, or are you going to act up some more?”
Steve was so lost in his own thoughts, he didn’t hear the alpha enter the room. When the hand rested on his shoulder he lashed out, fist clipping the other man’s jaw. Instead of trying to wrestle Steve to the bed, he stepped back, giving ground. Before Steve could pursue the opening, the older man’s eyes began to glow a brilliant blue. The restraints around his wrists snapped together behind his back, quickly joined by those around his ankles, leaving him resting on his stomach, arched backwards and vulnerable.
Steve spent the majority of the next day debriefing with Fury and writing up reports on the latest battle. He spent several hours of that time being asked questions about the mystic that had appeared long enough to help them before disappearing. Especially obnoxious as he had no clue who it was, but he refused to throw Bruce under the bus. Besides, the sheer amount of frustration would most likely lead to a code green, and no one needed that today. By the time he returned to the tower he was frustrated and unsettled in a way he couldn't quite figure out.
"You don't understand. They think I'm in the dungeon. Thor will notify Odin, and they'll take me back. There won't be a chance for escape this time." Silvery tears streaked down his pale cheeks.
Trying to steel himself for what he might find, he lowered his hand to his soft cock, lingering for a moment before sliding his fingers back to his balls. All he encountered was a stretch of smooth skin leading to his plugged up hole. Horror and fear pulsed through him as what had been done to him sunk in. Steve knew it was a common practice, his mother had told him and Bucky about it when they were small. Mutilation as medical practice. Castration of omegas to make them more complacent. But he’d never thought that it could happen to him.
Tony knew he couldn’t hold back much longer, pressed Steve deeper into the rug, slamming into him hard and fast. “Now Steve! Now!” Steve screamed as he was finally allowed release, clenching so tightly around Tony’s cock that it almost hurt. He came buried as far inside Steve’s body as possible, passage rippling and squeezing around him, milking every drop from his spent cock. He stayed still, holding his trembling omega close, dropping soft kisses along his neck and shoulders. He’d learned that Steve needed him to stay inside as long as possible. Needed to be filled to know he was safe and wanted.
"Thank you, Tony." It was ridiculous, but somehow Tony completely understood. Logically he knew the other man had just been gone on a two-week business trip. However, after losing so many people that he loved to time and war, a part of Steve was always convinced that this was too good to be true. That he'd wake up one morning and it would all be gone. Focusing on the moment, Steve picked up the soap and lathered up his hands. He took his time, carefully washing every inch of Tony's body. Worshiping it in his own way. He loved the texture of his skin, the feel of the muscles under his hands. By the time Steve was done, he was starting to feel relaxed and a little floaty himself.
"What do you think, baby? Nice and secure. And not a single thing for that desperate little cock of yours to rub up against. The only thing you're getting is what I decide to give you."
Loki smirked, a soft chuckle at Steve's discomfort slipping free. "You know, as you watched our rather public display, I find myself quite curious as to what kind of show you and the good Captain could put on for us. It would only be fair..."
“I know what I said. See this is why I wasn’t going to say anything. I didn’t want to worry you.” Tony sighed, sliding out of his chair to stand next to Steve, tilting his chin up so their eyes could meet. “I’m not going to die. I found my own cure. I stabilized a compound called extremis. It heals all physical damage on the molecular level at an accelerated rate. With a few other side benefits. It’s why I needed an enhanced omega. Like you.”
Steve began to thrash in his grip, oversensitive and frustrated. He was aroused, his body throbbing with need as Tony continued to work him. Why wasn’t he responding? Getting hard? Tony’s fingers left his hole, returning covered in slippery lube to press inside. Steve moaned as he was spread open on Tony’s fingers, feeling them slowly stroking in and out. It felt so good. Too good. He could feel himself building to another release, his soft cock sensitive and aching from the constant stimulation. Again, he struggled to hold back, and was betrayed by his body. Forced to come despite his wishes.
And thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or kudos on the last chapter. It makes me feel really good that other people enjoy the porny little plot bunnies that run through my head all the time.
“That’s… Not nice.” The words came out as a gasp. Tony released him suddenly and Steve collapsed back against the bed, breath heavy as though he had just finished a run. He dimly heard the sounds of Tony moving around the penthouse before returning to the bedroom.
Tony guided Steve onto his stomach, attaching the restrains to the frame, leaving him immobilized. He tried to keep his breathing calm and even, but couldn’t help shuddering when the plug was pulled from his clenching hole. “How- How bad is it gonna be?”
As James struggled to catch his breath, Tony heard the telltale hitch in Steve’s breathing. He tightened his grip on the chain, yanking the clamps free, destroying Steve’s pleasure yet again with the searing pain as blood rushed back to his abused nipples, tearing a scream from his throat, body so spent that not a single drop escaped from his soft cock. He continued to weep, from both exhaustion and need, turning pleading eyes onto Tony. Begging for either pleasure or rest.
Tony Stark stood before him, tall and proud. His cool gaze ran over Steve’s body slowly before the force field abruptly released him, sending him to his knees. Callused fingertips rested beneath Steve’s chin, tilting his face up. They were so close that Steve could smell the other man’s cologne, the scent so familiar it brought tears to his eyes.
He carried the box to his bed and set it down before turning his gaze up to the ceiling. “Hey Jarvis? Privacy mode, please.”
Then the hand was back, stroking and teasing. Tony quickly learned the most effective ways of driving him crazy, working him back to the edge of orgasm. This time he didn’t pause in his demanding strokes, using the other hand to wield the crop against his entrance. Steve sobbed and screamed, struggling uselessly against the metal holding him open for Tony’s ministrations. No matter how hard he tried, it didn’t budge. He was unable to gain even an inch of movement that Tony didn’t want him to have. The combination of searing pain and conflicting pleasure was confusing him. Steve could feel his body building to an intense orgasm, the repeated denials ratcheting his desire higher. He trembled on the edge, mindlessly pleading with the other man for release.
“No worries.” Tony slid his sunglasses up to rest on top of his head and flashed a bright, happy grin in Steve’s direction. “You didn’t miss much. We ordered pizza, don’t worry, I got you your favorite, and finally decided on a movie. Come on, come sit!”
The worst thing Steve could imagine was to have an alpha who didn’t want him, but was forced to take him anyway. A medically coerced bonding. He shook his head frantically, trying to deny the entire situation, but Fury continued over his protests.
Hello lovely people! Sorry this one took me so long. I let me Dom decide on Steve’s fate, and it took a few days. Also, I feel like I should apologize for the extra kinky kink in this chapter. I feel like a dirty dirty perv.
Steve watched in trepidation as Tony fitted his balls through a small metal loop, tightening it around him, adjusting a second piece to come up between them, forcing them apart. His cock was contained in a continuous metal tube, that was tightened down to fit him like a glove, before curving back to fasten to the lower part of the cage. He wouldn’t be able to get hard, would be in agony if his body tried. And even if he succeeded there, the metal loops held his balls tight, preventing him from coming.
Steve didn't have to be told twice. He was more than happy to slide onto the couch and cuddle back into his arms. Tony placed a gentle kiss on his cheek, along with a whispered "Good boy." in his ear, and they settled in to watch another obscure sci-fi movie that Tony loved and swore that everyone had already seen.
Steve spent the day wandering the apartment, unable to focus on the book he had chosen. He followed JARVIS’ directions to heat something for lunch and again for dinner when Tony still hadn’t returned. It was well after dark when Tony strode into the room, gesturing for Steve to follow him into the bedroom. He was immediately bent over the end of the bed and bred with little regard for his pleasure, or it seemed for Tony’s.
Steve whined again, his expression showing obvious confusion at his body’s reaction to the situation. Tony brushed his fingertips over the head of Steve’s cock, feeling it twitch beneath them. “It seems I was wrong. Obviously this isn’t much of a punishment if you’re enjoying it this much. Do you think you could come from this, pet? Maybe if you’re good, take it without fighting me, I’ll let you try.” Tony smiled as the color burned brighter in Steve’s cheeks. He was so much fun to play with. And so easy to embarrass.
Steve was certain he remembered Tony carrying him to bed, being surrounded by the alpha’s scent when he fell asleep after a week of torment and suffering. However when he woke the next morning, his hands and feet were bound securely to the far side of the bed, with Tony nowhere to be seen. JARVIS must have alerted him that Steve was awake, because a few moments later the restraints released, metal retracting into the normal bands on his wrists and ankles. He stood, taking the time to stretch sore muscles before hurrying through his morning routine and going to find Tony in the living room.
"Special? Different? Like you matter?" Tony slid off the edge of the couch and moved into Steve's space. He was a little taller than Tony, but it didn't seem to matter when he was this close. It made it hard to breathe. "Because you are. Because I take care of what's mine, and in my mind, that's what you are. Mine." Steve tried to swallow down a small whimper. It had been so long since anyone had wanted him for him. Not for his reputation, or his new body. Just him. Even longer since someone had wanted to take care of him. Not since he lived in Brooklyn with Bucky before the war. "Is- Is that a fact?"
Dark eyes were studying him intently, as though he had done something interesting. “No. Stay. Come sit. I want to ask you a few things.”
"Okay." He gently stroked Steve's side, sipping his coffee. "Do you need me to help you, baby? Make sure you get a good night’s sleep tonight?"
The first video footage Tony found of the process caused him to loose not only his lunch but his ability to sleep for several days. He picked up an old project, modified it to help rather than play with old memories. Called in a favor or twenty to get everything he needed. Steve deserved everything good in the world, and Tony was damn well going to make sure he had it. Even if it broke his heart in the process.
“No pal. He didn’t. He told me the truth. Sat me down after a whole lotta fightin’ to show me what everybody else knows.”
Tony smiled, holding him close. "I know. I'm a cruel sadist who loves to watch you suffer. Good thing you like it so much."
Steve flung himself against his chest, feeling strong arms wrap tight around him, for just a moment feeling impossibly fragile and young. "Tony..."
Tony sighed. “The longer my come stays inside of you after your heat, the better the chances of you getting pregnant, sweetheart. And I can’t imagine anything I want more. The idea of you carrying our child…” He shook his head. “But if you’re not ready for that, I understand and I want you to tell me, alright?”
Tony began to roll his hips up against Steve, matching his rhythm with the slow strokes over his cock. There was nothing hurried, as though they had all the time in the world. Pleasure built slowly, a steady climb to the edge, and Steve finally fell, spilling over Tony's fist, squeezing around him, until he felt Tony come inside of him, filling him with wet heat.
There was a sting in his arm. A needle, Steve realized too late. Cold seemed to spread through his veins, leaving him conscious but sapping his strength. It was almost like moving underwater. He felt himself released from the table, unable to do more than lie there. Voices moved around him, but the words were unintelligible. He closed his eyes and waited for the worst to be over.
A real chapter! Sorry the intro was so short. But we’re going to just jump right in. Hope you enjoy it! Let me know what you think and feel free to leave any kink requests in the comments below!
"I'm right here, baby." He held a glass of water to Steve's lips, petting his hair while he drank. "You are so sweet like this; I almost don't want to punish you." His voice went dark, sending a shiver down Steve's spine. "But I will. Come on. Up you go." He steadied him, helped him stand and walk to the bedroom. "Center of the bed, kneel for me."
Tony's eyes darkened and his smile took on a wicked edge. "Oh yeah." His eyes ran down Steve's body possessively. "Did you touch yourself?"
"Gorgeous. But I think you have a little too much on. Why don't you stand up and let me help with that?" Without waiting for an answer he was tugging Steve to his feet, stripping him and carelessly tossing his clothes across the room. It didn't take long before he was standing there in nothing but the cage around his cock.
"You were afraid you were going to lose me, sweetheart. I promised you that wouldn't happen. And I always keep my word to you. Always."
Tony smiled for the first time that morning. He’d have to spend some more time at Xavier’s after this. Maybe introduce the rest of the team. “I’m in position. When you’re ready, move.”
"Of course not. I love torturing my sweet boy, but I still want to take you out, show you off, spoil you with pretty gifts."
Natasha and Clint were on treadmills in the corner, and Tony was walking towards a sparring mat. “Hey Spangles! Wanna go a few rounds?”
"And the organizers are claiming you offered your full collection to be put on display at the last minute?"
"No, I... Umm..." He sighed. It was so much easier to talk as Captain America than Steve Rogers. "I found the art supplies in my spare room?"
And I’m back! Apparently, I’ve found my motivation for this story again. So have more porn of Tony taking care of Steve by being mean to him. I’d say that plot will come later, but... Eh. We’ll see what happens. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
He also spent some time alone in the shower afterward. Tony hadn't told him not to touch himself after the last time or put him back in the cage. Which should mean that this was fine. Steve slowly relaxed under the hot spray, closed his eyes. He ran his hands over his pecs, brushed his nipples. Nice, but not as interesting as when Tony had played with them. Sucked and teased and put those metal clamps on them.
"Alright." Steve followed him to the bedroom. When he reached the side of the bed, he was stopped with a long slow kiss. Calloused hands ran over him, slowly peeling off his clothes. Steve eagerly returned the favor, wanting to feel the brunette's bare skin against his.
When he blinked his eyes open again, he was curled up in Tony's lap, fingers carding through his hair. A soft blanket was wrapped around his shoulders. The plug and clamps were gone, the cage back in place without the vibrator attached. Steve turned his head, lazily nuzzling into the side of Tony's neck. He could hear other voices, but the words seemed too far away for him to understand.
Tony spent the rest of the afternoon cuddling and spoiling him. They curled together on the couch, watched several movies from Steve's list. The entire day was filled with gentle kisses, soothing touches, and murmured words of endearment.
“Stop saying that!” Tony held his hands up in a peaceful gesture when Steve flinched back at his tone. It was obvious that he knew something was off about the situation, but had no idea what. He continued in a soothing tone. “Sorry. You’re okay. I’m okay. Everything’s just peachy. Alright?”
Steve sobbed as a few final strikes were laid against his tightly clenched entrance, the pain forcing him to soften completely. He dimly heard the sounds of Tony walking away over his own tears. When he returned to stand behind him, Steve watched helplessly as Tony reached between his wide spread thighs to feed his spent cock and balls into a heavy metal cage. Just like the collar had earlier, the metal seemed to liquify, spreading over and tightening around his flesh until it was completely encased before curving his cock back on itself and hardening, fastening in place with a soft sound.
"Look, until you give me a reason to feel otherwise, I'm going to consider you a friend. And I don't sit back and let my friends be hurt. I don't like bullies. I don't care if they call themselves a god or not."
Tony flashed him a cocky smile, squeezing his neck in a gentle grip before letting go and taking his own seat once again. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’m more than a pretty face. I’m Tony Stark.”
Steve clung to them, still restless and needy despite his exhaustion. Tony watched with amusement as Steve slowly wiggled back, trying to rub his hole against one of James’ muscular thighs. He waited to see what the other man would do. If he would indulge Steve, let him have the pleasure he so desperately craved, of if he would deny him. Leave him frustrated and wanting until morning. When he noticed Tony’s attention, he raised an eyebrow in question. Tony shrugged, willing to play along with whatever he chose. After watching James tiptoe around the tower and hide in the shadows for so long, it was nice to see him comfortable enough to take charge. Of Steve at least. He still deferred to Tony in all things, which was interesting. A dynamic they could build on over time. And that Tony was already enjoying.
The other man's face lit up with a smile when he looked up. "Hey sweetheart, I didn't expect to see you until later."
“Mmmm… Not quite yet. We have some things we need to do today, that you’re not really going to like. The handcuffs make it easier.” He sat down on the bed, ran his hands proprietarily over Steve’s skin.
Steve could only move an inch or so back before being stopped by the plug, and a similar distance forward before hitting what felt like glass with the head of his cock. "What...?"
He reached out, cupped Tony's cheek. "Thank you. For bringing me tonight. For putting all this on display so I could see it." Steve gently brushed his lips against his. "It's beautiful. And so are you."
The answer was nothing. No teasing, no torturing, no games, and no sex. Just sleeping, held close against his chest. The next day was the same. And the day after that. After four days, not only was the anticipation of a punishment driving him crazy, but the need for release. He couldn't focus on work, on drawing, exercising, or reading. He tried to watch a movie with Natasha and Clint but ended up excusing himself halfway through before either spy noticed him squirming in his seat.
The elevator came to a smooth stop, the doors sliding open to reveal the penthouse, lights low and inviting. Tony stepped out onto the floor then came to an sudden halt. Standing in the center of the room was one Steven Grant Rogers.
Tony obviously knew the answer, was waiting expectantly. Bucky could feel the rush of blood to his face, and disturbingly, lower. “Steve’s.” He answered honestly.
I’d love to hear any theories on who Bucky might have a date with. I promise I’ll tell you if you’re right!
So now Steve was wandering around New York City, alone and vulnerable, with nowhere to go and no one to help him. He let the crowds carry him down to the subway for lack of a better direction. After several hours, he finally got off at a random stop, wanting to at least be moving under his own power for a while. He wasn’t certain where he was, but he also didn’t know if that mattered. Wasn’t one place as good as any right now?
"So beautiful..." Steve shifted beneath him, started to sit up. Tony's grip turned hard, pushing him back against the mattress and holding him there. "Not a chance, baby. You told me what you wanted, now it's my turn to give it to you. Now be a good boy and hand me that bottle of lube under the pillow."
“I said, that I wanted you desperate and begging. Pushed to your limit. And then to tell you no. Over and over again.”
Bucky watched them leave, heart heavy as he said goodbye to Steve. His best friend. His anchor in a new time and place. The only family he had left and the only person who cared if Bucky lived or died. He knew he wouldn’t be there when they came back. The rogue Avengers boarded the quinjet, and it rose high up into the sky before it disappeared. Bucky stood there for a moment longer, overwhelmed by dread, before turning to make his way inside.
Another shorter chapter, mostly because I don't like breaking midscene. I also want to show that this is a loving and healthy relationship, as well as a kinky power exchange. I personally feel like the affection enhances the dominance and submission. Let me know what you think!
Tony gave an exaggerated sniff, turning to face James. “We’re going to start with you giving us a show. How you do will decide Steve’s fate. Understand?”
“You seemed to enjoy yourself afterwards… I especially appreciated the way you screamed my name each and every time you came.”
This exposed one of Loki's secrets to the team. He could bake. Pretty much anything, and extremely well. And the god seemed strangely inclined to please, so it took little more than a sweet request or begging eyes for him to provide the heroes with cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and pastries. A few well-placed threats to Fury accompanied by slipping a three-layer white chocolate raspberry truffle cake to Coulson, and SHEILD was more than willing to accept Loki as the newest addition to the Avengers.
Nothing happened. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally looked up. Stark was still glaring down at him, repulser raised. Steve had a hand resting on Stark’s wrist. Not hard. Not forcing him to stop. Soft. Gentle. Steve was looking up at him with tears in his eyes, and Bucky could see the moment Stark relented. He lowered his hand, the weapon folding back to become a watch once more. “You just got very lucky, Barnes. Steve wants you around. And I would be a fool not to give him everything he wants. So you get to live another day. You get to stay. This time.  Cross me again, and I won’t hesitate to kill you. And if this is a trick? A ploy to bring the Rogues back? You will cease to exist. Got it?”
“No.” Tony gripped his chin firmly, forcing him to meet his eyes. “You do not ever apologize for needing me. That is what I’m here for. Understand?”
Slick fingers pressed against his sore hole, making him cry out and try to pull away. "Oh, Tony! It hurts! Please..."
As soon as Steve was standing by the foot of the bed, Tony moved away. He could hear some rustling behind him, and then something was being slid down over his eyes. It was a blindfold, soft and silky, and leaving him defenseless in the darkness it created. "If you don't like it, we'll take it off." Tony's voice was a husky murmur right against his ear. "But a lot of people do. It makes it easier, if you're... Shy. And it makes the sensations more intense. Easier for me to wreck you tonight."
"I... I'm glad I got the serum, and I'm stronger. Not sick all the time. But sometimes... I miss being smaller..."
“I have no idea what that means, so I’m just gonna move on. So… Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be hiding in Wakanda with the rest of the Super Friends?”
“Alright. I think I’ve got something you might like.” The toy Tony slid into his aching passage was thick, pliant, with ridges along it’s length. It felt so good moving against his channel walls, that Steve couldn’t help moaning, trying to press back into it. It was a heavy weight when Tony released it, a bulge at the base holding it firmly in place, reminiscent of the beginning of a knot. After a moment it began to pulse within him, widening and contracting at a steady pace that pressed against all of his glands in the most delicious way. Steve gave himself up to it, letting the pleasure build higher inside of him, carrying him to the edge of release.
Steve gasped when Tony reached out and roughly tweaked a nipple. “Watch it. Or you might get more than you bargained for.”
Steve nodded, distracted by the constant suction around his cock. He felt something cool slide into him, similar to the lube shooter from the commission, only wider. A thick cream oozed into him, filling his passage, a short plug holding it inside after the applicator was removed. He felt it rock inside of him as Tony attached something to the base, and cried out as he came, spilling into the machine still sucking away.
"Good. Then, I think I saw just the place." He nudged Steve to his feet, looping the leash around his wrist and guiding them over to a small curtained alcove. Once the curtains were closed, Bruce took a seat on one of the padded chairs, Loki draping himself over his lap, arms loose around his neck. They looked comfortable with each other, which gave Steve a good idea of how close their relationship was.
"Loki is troubled, yes. But I do not believe that was the way to handle the situation. Odin wanted him gone, and there was no convincing him otherwise. Why is this a concern?"
And that’s the end! I hope everyone enjoyed it. Thanks once again for the fabulous art by VeroCaroline, I love it! And if you haven’t seen it yet, please go check it out! I shall see you in the next story.
"Did I? I thought it was thirty. I guess I'll just have to trust you." He grinned. "I mean, I would never miscount, but... If you're sure... Well. Best get started. Jarvis, put up a timer, set it for twenty minutes."
“No sweetheart. You have several slick glands and they’re all in bad shape. But I promise, you can have a break after each one. And then we’re done for the day. We can relax. Maybe watch a movie. Alright?” Steve nodded, his lower lip trembling. It made Tony’s heart clench in his chest. “And if you’re good, I won’t put you back on the board, alright? I have a harness, it’s a lot more comfortable, and I’ll be able to hold you. You keep being a good boy, and you’ll get that instead.”
“Yeah. Of course.” He watched the other man carry their dishes to the sink, imagined he could still feel the warmth of Tony’s hand against his skin.
Time seemed to stretch and melt around him, pleasure building slow and gentle until he was falling over the edge and softly crying the other man’s name. He didn’t fight as Tony continued to stroke him, drawing out the pleasure, working him to arousal, and then again bringing him to release. It seemed like forever when Tony was finally done. He curled, limp and sated, into the cushions, felt the heat of Tony’s body against his, and was perfectly content.
In some ways it was exactly when he expected. Big and bright, filled to the brim with technology that Steve couldn’t even begin to understand. But there were no robots scurrying across the room. No piles of coffee mugs and plates. It was neat, clean, and quiet. Steve followed him across the enormous room to a corner set up with a variety of padded benches and machines, each fitted with it’s own restraints. Tony pointed to one that was low to the ground, with a soft mat surrounding it. Steve immediately dropped to his knees and bent over it. His wrists, thighs, and ankles were secured, leaving him spread open and helpless once again.
“Thank you, FRIDAY.” Tony looked down at the two submissives with a devious grin. “James, you have earned four orgasms for yourself. And Steve, assuming my math’s right, you will receive ten ruined orgasms tonight.” Steve covered his face with his hands, prompting a chuckle from Tony. “I’m ready to get started. Up, both of you, into the playroom.”
He nodded miserably, knowing where they were going. Tony loved playing games that Steve could never win, knowing that the soldier would be competitive enough to try anyway. "Always, Tony..."
As soon as the elevator doors closed behind him, the phone chimed and the plug buried inside of him came to life, roaring away at an intensity so strong his legs collapsed beneath him, dropping him to the floor. He dug out the phone, flipping it open to read the newest message.
When Steve had finally calmed, he turned his teary gaze up to Tony’s face. He felt broken down in an entirely new way. His cock throbbed. Denied pleasure made him ache with need. “Tony… Alpha. Please?”
“As soon as I can. I promise.” He drew back from their embrace, snagging a pillow and dropping in in front of the chair. “Kneel for me sweetheart.”
Finally the grip around him released. The dildo drew out of his body, leaving him gaping open and clenching around nothing. There was a hollow throbbing in his cock and deep inside his ass. Tears still spilled down his cheeks. Aftershocks made him shudder, drawing echoes of pleasure and pain from his abused flesh. He felt hot and swollen everywhere.
Steve rushed to do as he was told, only to be instructed to lie on the far side of the bed where he had woken up that morning. His wrists and ankles locked themselves in place without a single touch from his alpha. The lights went out and Tony left the room. Steve laid there, staring into the dark, waiting for Tony to join him. It was late when he finally came back, climbing under the blankets on the other side of the bed without a word and going to sleep.
“Hush. You need this. I know it’s hard. It’s going to get a lot worse soon. But I know that you can do this.” Tony stepped back, gaze running thoughtfully over Steve’s body, as though checking for anything he might have missed. “I will be here with you the entire time, sweetheart. And if you need me, you call me. Alright?”
Thank you to everyone who has commented or liked this story. I hope you continue to enjoy this story and my fics in the future.
“I liked you being here. As a matter of fact, you are welcome in my penthouse or my bed whenever you like. You always have been.”
Steve shook his head back and forth frantically, but it was too late. Tony’s fingers were still moving inside of him, and it took next to no time at all before he was nearing orgasm again. He knew what to expect this time, thought it would make it better, but instead it seemed worse. The zap of electricity through his cock, followed by the painful and unsatisfying pulses as his balls emptied without pleasure.
By week three, Bucky understood part of the problem. He’d woken up hard and aching, cock swollen and standing away from his body. It was such an unusual occurrence, he didn’t know what to do with it. He didn’t remember the last time he had been hard. Bucky simply laid there, staring at the massive thing pointing at the ceiling. Feeling it pulse and throb when the sounds of pleasure began in the other room. Hesitantly he reached for it, imagining how good it might feel to stroke over the length, the way he’d seen Steve do for Stark. The second his hand wrapped around the shaft, a full sensory memory rushed over him. Chemicals being injected into the side of his neck, his naked body strapped down to a table, only the flesh arm free. The stimulant making him ache and burn with arousal, cock hard and throbbing, need turning it a dark red. The electrodes buried under his skin sending bright bolts of pain shooting through his nervous system each time he’d tried to touch his cock. Trying over and over again, the need making him desperate for release. Days spent being tortured in the same fashion. Trained to ignore the needs of his body one by one. After all, an asset had no need of pleasure.
Tony shook his head sadly. "I'm starting to think you don't want to come at all tonight, Steve. Otherwise, you'd be trying harder. Over the counter."
Steve obediently rose to his feet and walked into his bedroom. He let his thoughts drift as he dressed in clean and comfortable clothes and returned to the common floor of the tower. How did his mysterious Sir know what he was doing and when he was doing it?
Saturday afternoon, Steve started getting ready for the gala. He knew how many reporters were going to be there, and how the media liked to rip Tony apart for any perceived shortcomings, which is why he wanted to look perfect tonight. After consulting with both Pepper and Natasha the day before, he felt fairly well prepared.
“You’re going to regret that. But I won’t.” As soon as the elevator stopped, Tony was moving again, dragging Steve with him into a back corner of his workshop. Voice deceptively kind. “You’re gonna help me, honey. I have so many prototypes to test for one of SI’s affiliate companies. We’ll work on them together.” He pressed Steve down onto a stool, and he gasped as the plug was pressed further into him.
"Yeah. I... I know how the world works. What's... Going to happen one day. But... I don't like to think about it. I want you here. With me. I don't ever want to lose you."
A small twinge of guilt stopped him and he dropped into one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs lining the hallway. There was one other person who cared. Who he should be texting this very moment, to inform of him wellbeing. But Steve just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
Strange tried one last time to talk Steve out of his decision, but in the end relented. He opened a portal created from glowing orange lines in front of them. With shoulders straight and head held high, Steve walked through it into his chosen destiny.
He wasn't certain how much time had passed before he became aware of Tony talking to him, guiding his mouth away from his lap. Steve made a soft sound of protest, not wanting to move.
Steve nodded, mind spinning. Tony had a new toy for him, and that was often something the other man had made just for him, fantasizing about being able to use it on him. Tony started moving towards the bedroom at a brisk pace. If he tried to, Steve might be able to get there before the other man. Might even be able to hold the plug in place that long. If he tried.
Not only was this a fun chance to torment Steve, it was also a sign to James. He was allowed to fail. He wouldn’t be punished for it. He no longer belonged to Hydra. Tony opened his arms and James walked into them, allowing himself to be held tight. There was a fine tremor running through him, letting Tony know he had received the intended message. It would, however, take some time for him to believe it. Finally James drew back, kneeling once more on his cushion. Tony flashed them both a brilliant smile. “FRIDAY, would you care to give us the results?”
Steve wasn’t sure why he stayed on his knees before the other man. Maybe it was the power of Tony’s personality filling the air around them, or maybe it seemed the appropriate place for a supplicant to be. Either way, he made no effort to gain his feet. “I am Steve Rogers. Just not… Your Steve Rogers. Where I’m from…” He paused, struggling to find a way to describe what he’d already been through. Realizing it was impossible, he shook his head and continued. “A lot of things happened. Most of them, I felt responsible for. I still do. And there was no longer a place for me there. I can’t be who they want me to anymore. Steven Strange helped me find what I was looking for, and opened a portal for me. This is where I want to be.”
“Yeah? That what you want? Should I bend you over the bench, have you right here, then plug you back up again?”
Steve whined, as though he’d somehow believed Tony would have mercy on him, hips dancing in the air. “No… No, please…”
Steve blushed, couldn’t help himself. Tony watched the flush spread over his skin with a smile. “You are too fucking adorable, you know that?”
“Well, I wanted to have a nice day. Seems like you chose this instead.” Tony walked to the bar, examining the medications Bruce had left the night before with their accompanying directions. If Steve wasn’t going to cooperate, they might as well spend some time working on his glands. After breakfast. Choosing the bottle he wanted. Tony filled a syringe with a dose large enough to last about ten hours.
And of course that was when the elevator doors opened and Stark walked in. Repulser gauntlet primed and aimed at Bucky’s face. “What the fuck do you want, Barnes?”
Finally Tony released his cock, wrapping his arms around his waist and holding him close, murmuring soothing words of comfort against his hair. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I’ve got you. Your alpha’s got you.”
The strange sensation of flowing metal returned, wrapping securely around his aching hole and tightening just enough to leave him throbbing as it hardened. The top of the plug was held securely in place, folded over the edge of his entrance and applying constant pinching pressure. The inner portion then began to swell, stretching Steve’s sore passage until he cried out, pressing relentlessly against his overstimulated prostate, increasing until his body tried to shudder through another release. Once again, a bolt of pain destroyed it automatically.
A text earlier had warned him not to expect the genius before seven o'clock. It was currently noon. Seven hours of frustration, with no real end in sight. Sure, Tony had let him out of the cage after three days last time, but there was no guarantee of that this time. Tony Stark never did what anyone expected of him. He could take out the plug, even try to replace it later, but Steve was too honest for that, and after his last two punishments, he wasn't overly eager to bring about another one.
“My pleasure. Let me know if anything on your uniform needs worked on. Don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Steve nodded obediently, allowing himself to be guided to a table. He couldn’t stay still, writhing against the hard wooden seat, even as he devoured the food that was set in front of him. Tony sat across from him, eating his own breakfast as he watched Steve struggle. He seemed pleased rather than annoyed. After they had both finished and Tony downed the last of his coffee, Steve was led down to Tony’s workshop.
As he lay there panting afterwards, he felt cool metal pressed against his skin, positioned behind the cage. When Tony’s hands slid away, it remained in place, attached to the bottom of the cage. It thrummed to life, vibrations pulsing against the sensitive area, pushing Steve into another release. Tears spilled free when it didn’t stop.
Steve slid his hand into Bucky’s, tugging him to his feet and leading him down the long hallway to the room he and Tony shared. When they reached the bed, Steve let go of his hand to casually strip off his robe, before turning to face Bucky. He slowly undressed him, guiding him down onto the large, soft bed when he was done. He turned into Steve’s body, felt arms wrap tight around him. Bucky hid his face in the side of his neck when he felt his cock began to twitch and harden, not wanting to see it. Not wanting to have any part of it.
Tony released his grip on the torn flesh, let his tongue trace the imprints of his teeth and play over the area. He let go of Steve only long enough to shove his boxers off, and drag the track pants down far enough to reveal that perfect ass. His hand slid up further, squeezing one of Steve’s cheeks, probably hard enough to bruise. Tony knew he should slow down, at least long enough to grab the bottle of lube from the nightstand, but the urge to touch and claim was overwhelming.
Tony was pressed against his side, he could smell his rich cologne, and his hand rested casually on Steve's thigh. As he watched, it began to slowly slide up and down, almost as though Tony was trying to soothe him. Put him at ease. If that was the goal, it was definitely not working. However, a glance at those dark amused eyes told him that was the point.
"Yeah. You don't have to sharpen your knives on Tony. He hasn't done anything that I didn't... Umm..."
Tony took a moment to admire his handiwork. Steve was helpless, bound in place and completely at his mercy. With a thought, he started the machine, setting the strength and speed to a random pattern. The first thrust of the dildo into his body had Steve struggling with a vengeance, desperate to free himself. But it was too late. There was no escape. His cries became sharper as the friction of the thrusts heated the itching lubricant further, increasing his torment.
After a few more minutes of contented silence, Tony cupped the side of his face, tilting it up so he was looking into Steve's eyes. "Hey Steve?"
Tony waved the apology away, taking a large bite of pancake before setting his fork down. “No need, sweetheart. I know I’m useless before coffee, why would I expect more from anyone else?”
“Then that’s how I’ll take care of you, precious boy. I will always give you exactly what you need.”
Tony grinned. Steve had obviously forgotten what game they were playing. He’d be reminded soon enough, and it would be devastating for him. He gripped the tube, finger hovering over the release button. “Come for me. Now!” The moment he gave the order he released the pressure, pulling the tube free.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean… I know how important your work is. I don’t expect you to drop everything to spend time on me. I mean, you’re a busy man.”
"Yes..." A trail of fire was moving down his stomach, over his thighs, close enough to for him to draw in a worried breath, but not touching the cage.
“Is that what you need, honey? To try and fight for a little while before your alpha breaks you down? That’s alright. You go ahead and fight. Maybe if you can get free, I’ll breed you again, let you get nice and hard, stroke you off just the way you were hoping I would. Maybe.”
Eventually whimpers and moans turned to sobs, tears soaking the blindfold. Even though he wasn't in the room with him, Steve felt surrounded by Tony's presence. Knew that if he said the word, everything would stop. He gave into the sensations, riding the pleasure until he couldn't take it anymore, before leaning into the pain to draw him away from the edge. Back and forth, over and over again, each sensation rolling over him like a wave, dragging him under.
Steve curled tighter into a ball, arms wrapping over Tony’s trying to hold onto him. “I just want to be yours. From the first time I met you, I knew. But you didn’t… And I know you’re not… But I’d do anything. Anything. If you’d just let me stay. Here. With you. It’s all I want.”
“It’s just us, Steve. We’re on lockdown. No one’s coming in until I allow it.” He caught Steve’s chin, forcing him to look up. “I’m a possessive man. No one gets to see you like this but me. Alright?”
And this version of Steve was beautiful. There was no other word to describe it. He surrendered himself so easily to Stark’s desires. Giving in and embracing it. Finding pleasure in whatever was being done to him in the moment. He’d watched from the shadows in the hall one night as Steve was pulled back into Stark’s arms, hands coming around to palm at his chest, pinching and pulling at Steve’s nipples until he’d come with a cry from that alone. Bucky had heard the whispered words that made no sense to him as he fled back to the safety of his own room. “Thirty nine to beat, sweetheart…”
Again he rested his palm at the small of his back, leading him into a dimly lit Italian restaurant. They were immediately shown to a private booth at the back, curtained off from view by heavy velvet drapes. Tony guided him into the booth and slid in beside him.
“Well, I’ll let you get back to what you were doing. I’ll see you tonight.” He stepped off the elevator on the common floor, a spring in his step, waving over his shoulder as the doors closed. Steve leaned back against the wall for the rest of the ride to his floor, too overwhelmed to do more.
“You’re welcome.” He set the tablet aside and turned his full attention on Steve. “Do you want to finish the last of your punishment now, or do you want to have lunch and relax a while first?”
Steve obediently returned to the couch, knelt there while they ate, Tony indulging in his desire to feed Steve with his own hands. Loving how sweet and receptive it made him. When they were finished he threaded a hand into Steve's hair, guiding him down to rest on his knee, reassuring him with his presence, and letting him float in the moment.
“You’re welcome. You just stay right there.” Tony pressed the ice pack against Steve’s cock, holding him down against the bed as he yelled and struggled in his grasp. Tony made sure the cold had a chance to seep deep into the sensitive flesh before he reset the nanobots, allowing Steve’s cock to finally soften. Steve breathed a sigh of relief when Tony removed the ice pack and replaced the cage. He made sure to thoroughly coat the inside with the lube he’d chosen before tightening it down around the numb flesh, knowing it would make it worse when Steve’s cock tried to harden later. And it would. Tony would see to it. The idea of Steve’s body getting aroused, even as his ass was on fire, made Tony want to pound him through the mattress.
“Don’t worry, sweetheart. This compound only lasts for twelve hours. You can take it. In the meantime, I have some work to do. I’ll see you in the morning, pet.” Tony left him there, his sobs filling the empty room, the unceasing desire driving him insane. Desperate for even a single touch, and cruelly denied.
Unapologetic fluff, because honestly poor Steve deserves it. Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments on this story. I’ve never written a kinky AU universe, and really wasn’t sure if anyone would want to read this but me. All of the encouragement means the world to me, and I hope you continue to enjoy where this story goes.
Steve never had a chance to answer. The plug buried inside of him roared to life, waking up the need that had been forgotten when he was pleasuring his Dom. He could see the blue glow of his eyes as the vibrator jumped levels, working him toward the edge before dropping back down. Teasing him as he writhed, clamps pulling harshly at sore nipples and caged cock throbbing in agony at being denied. Heat built inside of him antagonizing the lubricant Tony had used on him. His hips ground back desperately, the itch inside of him rising and falling in waves.
A sharp slap landed on his inner thigh. "Language, Steve. What would people think if they knew Captain America cussed like a sailor?"
“Says who? I was touching you. You were enjoying it. You were the one telling me you didn’t want it. I already got mine, sweetheart. Why should you get yours if you’re gonna act like that?”
He melted into Tony's touch, sinking into the kiss and chasing after the other man's lips when he pulled back. "I missed you, Tony."
Steve tensed in the restraints as Tony lifted a metal syringe. It wasn’t overly large, but the needle was much bigger than what he was used to. Tony stepped between his wide spread thighs, and Steve felt the press of metal against the base of his cock, right beside where the cage began. He sucked in a breath that was torn from him in a scream as the needle slid into the sensitive flesh. He could feel the contents as they were injected, searing into him, the area burning hot. When the needle slid free, he could still feel it. A heavy weight in the base of his cock, as though it were sitting there, waiting for something.
Tony turned his attention back to Steve, snapping his fingers and gesturing for him to stand. “Follow me.”
"Alright. Stand up for me." He felt Tony's hands guide him, turning him so his back was to the other man. Steve heard an odd sound, fabric brushing against fabric, and then felt something slick and cool wrapping around his wrists, binding them together behind his back. Tony turned him to face him once more, then guided Steve down to sit on top of his desk. The red silk tie he had been wearing earlier was gone.
After all, Steve was basically giving him a roadmap of what he needed to do to not only keep him, but make sure he felt secure as well. If Tony were a better man, he’d wait. Give this Steve a chance to decide how he felt about him. Make him as comfortable as possible and hope he decided in Tony’s favor.
Steve nodded hesitantly against his chest. Tony let him relax for a little while before lifting him in his arms and carrying him downstairs to his playroom. Steve was fuzzy and overwhelmed, not seeming to realize where he was or what was going on around him. Tony gently laid him down on a couch in the corner before getting the room set up for the night. He changed out the standard restraints for vibranium ones, wanting to ensure Steve was held securely in place. The machine he would be using was moved to the center of the room, a large ribbed dildo fastened in place.
"I had to spar with the Hulk yesterday, Steve. The Hulk! There's a billionaire shaped dent in the wall now!"
“Don’t worry, baby, I’m planning on leaving your pretty neck alone. This is to help me get your cage fitted properly.” Steve screamed as Tony lifted his cocklet, injecting the medication into the base. The cool liquid worked instantly, wilting his erection and shrinking the tissue. Feeling slightly vindictive due to the pain in his hand, Tony used a numbing lube to slick Steve’s cock before feeding it into the cage. He struggled wildly, but the restraints held firm.
Holy hell! You know it’s bad when you re-read what you wrote and feel sorry for the character you’re tormenting! Let me know what you think it the comments. Do you like Steve being tormented or does he finally deserve a break?
Steve buried his face against Tony’s chest, completely overwhelmed. The gentle touches and softness of Tony’s tone slowly helped him calm down, leaving him pliant in his arms. “Thank you, Tony.”
“But as effective as that might be, we’ve already tried something similar, and the lesson didn’t stick.” Tony’s hand tightened into a fist in Steve’s hair, jerking his head back, forcing eye contact. “So we’re going to try it a different way. I’m going to give you an enhancer, one that will last for days. Then I’m going to strap you down to a vibrator. You’re going to come for me. You won’t be able to help yourself. Over and over again. And once you’re nice and sensitive, I’m going to spread you open and start that treatment. And you’re going to come from that too. No matter how uncomfortable it is. Or how much you hate it. And you will stay that way until the treatment is over. Because showing you I can do whatever I want with your body? That I can force you to take pleasure from anything I want? That’s going to be worse for you than denial. Do you understand me, omega?”
Sorry it's been a few days since the last update, but I'm back! A whole chapter of smut, kink, and breadcrumbs of plot. Enjoy, and feel free to let me know what you think in the comments. Stay safe out there!
The sobs came free as he felt the cage pull tighter around him. It almost felt looser around his soft cock until the mechanism was activated, tightening it until he was throbbing again. He knew what his alpha was doing now. Forcing releases until he softened enough to allow the extra room, then stealing it away.
"I enjoy spending time with you, outside of what we've started, and I don't want you to feel like you have to agree to anything you don't want. That having been said, I think you like this as much as I do. And I don't think you want me to stop."
This version of Steve Rogers was better than he’d ever thought possible. So broken and eager to please. Willing to do anything with no limits. So oblivious to who Tony really was. What he was capable of. And so easy to manipulate. Tony didn’t remember the last time he’d enjoyed himself so much. There were so many things he wanted to do to this man, it was hard to figure out where to start. For the moment he had fifteen opportunities to torment the poor thing. And if that wasn’t enough, it would be beyond simple to rig another game for Steve to lose to provide more.
Steve was stretched out on the couch, eyes mostly closed, trying to figure out what he should do with himself next. He had just finished another movie on Tony’s “It’s a crime against humanity that you haven’t seen this movie yet” list. The Breakfast Club was weird. Honestly, the entirety of the eighties seemed weird. Steve was almost glad that he’d missed them.
"Of course. Have to take care of my sweet boy. Even when he's been naughty. Teach him to do better. So, let's see. You ignored my order. Took your orgasm without permission. And what have I told you about taking what's mine?"
“I know.” Tony pulled him closer, rubbing his back soothingly before returning to the kisses from before. Steve felt like he was slowly being led down a dark and unfamiliar road. But the kisses were addictive, he couldn’t get enough, as was the feel of Tony’s hands running over his bare skin. He pressed closer, willing to offer up anything his alpha wanted.
“As I was saying, one of these key pieces is currently… In a type of peril. I believe that you could do much to rectify the situation, and it would have the added benefit of removing you from your currently hopeless and rather pathetic situation. So, do I have your agreement?”
"That's my good boy." The words were followed by a scraping sound, like something heavy being dragged across the floor, but before he could ask, Steve felt a firm pressure against his hole.
He wore the suit. The blue one that Tony had... Mentioned? Told him to wear? Steve wasn't entirely sure, but he wore it all the same. He was standing in his living room, uncertain what he should be doing with himself, waiting for Tony to pick him up for their date. His first date since... Best not to think of that.
It had taken time and work. Neither of them were perfect, and there was a lot of backsliding. Either Tony falling into his own bad habits, or Steve unwilling to back down from a challenge. Friction and fighting and punishments, but they were still together. Steve couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. Spending his life with anyone else. “I’m good, alpha.”
A moment later the plug buzzed to life, pressed tightly against his prostate, making him want to scream. His arm jerked hard enough to knock into the table, causing water to slosh over the rim of his glass and pulling Tony’s attention back to him. “You alright?”
Kisses were mixed in with the touches next, a press on his shoulder, his jaw. Gentle suction on a nipple that made Steve moan softly. Fingertips stroking up his inner thigh, close enough to almost touch his cock before moving away. A brief caress of his balls, making them throb. Soft nips along the side of his neck. Warming his skin, causing his hips to shift restlessly against the bed.
"Okay, big guy. No worries. I didn't exactly have plans of running back to the tower and sharing everything I saw here tonight." Tony snorted. "Not that Fury would likely believe it anyway."
“Always, sweetheart. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to make it any easier on you. I’m a selfish man. I enjoy my fun. And claiming every last inch of you for my own? That’s fun.”
A wicked smirk turned up the corners of Tony's mouth. "Good. I like you being nervous. I like playing with you. Do you like it, Steve?"
“I promise. I’m so sorry, sweetheart. I made a mistake. You’ve been so unhappy since I brought you here, I started to think that maybe I was wrong. That it wasn’t the shock of settling in, of adapting to something new that was making you act out. That it was me.” He sighed. “I’ve been told I’m a lot to deal with under the best of circumstances. By pretty much everyone, at one time or another. Maybe expecting to have an omega of my own, a mate and a family, was too much.” Tony tilted Steve’s chin up, a bittersweet smile on his face when their eyes met. “You’re wonderful, Steve. Better than I deserve. I don’t want you to be unhappy. I talked to Bruce at the gala tonight. He’s willing to have you come and live with him and James. You’d still be in the tower, and I could come see you, if you wanted me to. And I’d be there to take care of you when you needed me to. You wouldn’t be alone…”
Steve slid off the couch cushion and dropped to the floor, pressing his forehead to the carpet. Trying to make himself smaller than his alpha. The alpha. Not his. Never his. He grit his teeth, trying to hold in the whines and whimpers that were trying to slip free.
“There’s my sweet boy. Ready?” He waited for Steve to nod before turning the vibrator on again. It was no longer painful, the gland itself still feeling numb. Which meant he could focus on how the rest of him felt. A different kind of torture. His nipples were still aching, the pressure from the clamps going straight to his groin. His rim was clenching around the vibrator, but it was too narrow to provide any satisfaction, and too short to press as deep as he needed it.
“You should have known this wasn’t happening without my mark on you. This cage? Means I own you. I control you. It means you’re mine.” Steve felt the cool metal slide over him, locking him away. It was as intense as the first time. As soon as the lock clicked into place and the metal tightened around him, he lost control, thrashing helplessly. He flipped over onto his stomach, rutting desperately against the bed but feeling nothing. It had been so long, Steve had forgot how overwhelmingly intense it was, to be unable to feel even a hint of touch. The metal warmed against his skin and his cock tried valiantly to harden, but there simply wasn’t room. The ache tightened his gut, and pulled soft cries from his throat.
The next attempt had James falling heavily on his stomach again. He immediately repositioned himself, gamely lowering down again. He didn’t fall, but his form was so terrible for the next two attempts that Tony immediately put them in the fail column. James started to lose his balance on the next, arm having to awkwardly hop to the side in order to catch himself. Followed by another perfect push up, eyes locked with Steve’s the entire time.
After putting in an order with JARVIS for breakfast, he began trailing gentle kisses over Steve’s face. The omega only sighed in his sleep. Apparently he was a heavier sleeper than Tony had realized. Feeling mischievous, probably from the abrupt crash of the panic high he’d been riding for days, Tony decided to see just how far he could push things before the other man woke. And he wanted Steve, at least one more time, just like this. With that in mind, he began placing soft kisses down the long line of Steve’s neck, over the claiming scar, and across his shoulder. Steve let out a soft sound, almost a whimper, when Tony’s mouth brushed the bite, but otherwise his breathing stayed slow and even.
"So now I have to think of a way to punish you. Obviously putting a vibrator on your sweet little cock didn't drive the lesson home, now did it? You still tried to take what's mine. Twice now. You just don't learn, Steve. I guess I'll just have to get more creative. Say thank you."
“Good. Tony, I need you. Tony, please.” He craned around so he could drop soft kisses against any skin he could reach on the older man.
Steve’s legs were lifted into stirrups and secured at both the knees and ankles before they were spread wide, leaving him open and exposed. Tony slowly ran his hands in a slow caress down Steve’s legs, ending with them resting on his thighs. “You ready to get started, pet?”
"Sounds about right. I know it's hard, but you just have to trust me. Trust me to tell you if this isn't what I want. Trust me to stay."
"I believe you." He reached out and tugged Steve closer until he was pressed against Tony's side, then leaned forward and began pressing slow hot kisses along the side of his neck and jaw. When he spoke again, Steve could feel the vibrations of the words against his skin. "I'm a very possessive man. Very demanding. Very creative. And very very kinky."
Tony smiled down at him, gently this time. “Not as often as I’d like. Usually my partners have a hard time keeping up with me. Apparently I’m too mean. You don’t seem to have any problems though.”
Steve felt fine tremors begin to run through his muscles. When he spoke again his voice was a whisper. “Please don’t do this.”
Tony was grateful to escape to bed early that night, settling them in and restraining Steve’s wrist and ankle cuffs to the bed. He pretended to sleep, not in the mood to mount the pretty omega beside him. Memories of the past were too close for him to feel even the slightest hint of arousal. Tony listened to the soft frustrated sounds Steve made until they finally quieted. The night was still around them. Tony stared into the darkness, unable to sleep.
"N-no Tony." Steve clenched down hard on nothing, his muscles so loose that trying to hold them tight was a struggle.
He had no idea how long they had been doing this. The world had faded away, leaving him floating in a place where only sensation mattered. He could hear Tony murmuring praise and endearments to him, and it seemed so far away.
"Gimme a sec, okay?" Tony slid off the bed. Steve could hear him digging around in the dresser for a moment, before he came back, kneeling in front of Steve on the bed. "I have something for you. I wanted to give it to you while we were here, but I didn't want it to seem... Casual, or part of a sexy time reward."
Steve’s body was clenching helplessly around the metal, trying to force it out since he couldn’t move away. It began to expand inside of him with a series of clicking sounds, stretching his hole painfully wide. He squealed, struggling against the shackles, trying to escape from the unrelenting pressure. He realized just how open he was when he felt the cool air of the workshop against his sensitive walls. Another metal strap was fastened over his back, keeping him pinned securely against the bench. “Can’t have you moving, honey. You might hurt yourself in a way I don’t want.”
“Now why would I make it that easy? Besides, you love this. Being my toy. Having every bit of my attention focused just on you. You don’t care if I hurt you or please you, as long as I don’t stop.” A harsh slap landed on Steve’s thigh, making him jolt. “And I want to have some fun.”
“You would and you could, Cap. For lack of anything better, you can stay here until I can get Strange to fix this clusterfuck. But you stay on your floor and out of my space. I don’t want to see you. I don’t want to hear you. I don’t even want to know that you’re here. Understand?”
At the sound of raised voices, both of the alpha’s quickly crossed the room. Tony rested a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder, holding him in place. Bruce sat down on the couch, pulling Bucky into his lap. He placed soft kisses along his hairline, murmuring soothing words into his ear, allowing Bucky to curl tight into him, burying his face in the side of Bruce’s neck.
Tony couldn’t stop staring at the man in his arms. Some of Steve’s fear had calmed, but he was still curled into a tight ball, clinging onto Tony’s arms, and begging for even the smallest scraps of affection. Given what he had learned about his own counterpart, Tony couldn’t blame him for being afraid of immanent rejection. But seeing him like this made Tony’s heart ache. He was so lovely and needy. All he wanted was to feel safe and cared for. Which Tony could provide.
Steve gripped Tony's hip tightly with one hand, more to ground himself than to guide his movements, then slid the other up to wrap around him. He was already slick, leaking precum, and it was so easy to grip him tight, stroke him fast and desperate. Steve could feel him shudder, hear him moan. He felt the muscles gripping him even tighter before they began clenching around him over and over as Tony spilled over his fingers and chest. It was too much.
“Shh… It’s okay. I told you. You’re mine. I am never letting you go, Steve. I know it’s hard right now, but try, okay? You’ll feel better once we get you straightened out. But Steve?” He forced his chin back, brown eyes boring intensely into blue. “I have always wanted you. You were always my first choice. I stepped aside because you pushed me away, didn’t want me. But as soon as Fury told me you needed an alpha… I wasn’t going to let anyone else have you. I need you to remember that. Especially when I have to be mean to you. Okay?”
“Soon, sweet boy. Just a little bit longer.” He leaned down, pressing their lips together, tongue sweeping into Steve’s mouth. Chasing the soft whimpers and whines. “That’s my good boy.”
Steve shook his head, nuzzling into Tony’s skin, purring softly. The scent of contented omega filled the air around them. “No, alpha. It was perfect.”
Sorry it’s been a little while since I posted! I was supposed to have a week vacation before starting my new job, but everything went crazy and I didn’t have time to write. I just started training, so I won’t have as much time to write as I did before, but I promise none of my fics are being dropped. It’ll just take a little longer for updates. Hang in there!
Tony slid out from behind him, helped him into the position he wanted him in. He felt the solid weight of Tony resting on the backs of his thighs as he ground his hips into the bed seeking friction.
Steve would never have an alpha to call his own. Someone to love him, protect him, take him to the submissive heights that other omegas waxed poetic about. No one wanted damaged goods. He might look perfect from the outside, but it was all a lie. Everything special about him came out of a bottle.
He shifted to his stomach, shimmying beneath the blankets, biting his lip to muffle the whimpers the renewed attack on his prostate produced. Tony had said if he was good, he'd make it worth his while. And he could think of one thing that always put the older man in a benevolent mood.
He wouldn't say anything yet. Would wait. After all, Tony had said it when he was mostly asleep. He would wait until he was ready to say it when he was awake. Maybe when that day came, Steve would be ready to return his feelings. Would have gotten past the fear that everything he loved would always disappear.
A shiver ran over Steve’s skin at the dark tone of voice, body still throbbing under him, his rim pulsing weakly around Tony’s spent cock. He felt it twitch, begin to stir and harden inside of him. “Sir…”
As soon as his feet hit the carpet, he was gone, dashing for the penthouse door and desperately trying to force it open. Tony moved at a slower pace, allowing Steve to discover the futility of his actions. When the door didn’t open, he turned to the windows, fist banging against the glass, trying to shatter it. He whirled around, dropping into a crouch when Tony came closer, ready to attack. “Stay back! I mean it!”
Steve ignored the flush he could feel rising in his cheeks. “That was mean, Tony. Really, really mean.”
"You are. I'm so proud of you. Giving me so much. Wanting to please me and take care of me. I'm never going to let you go, Steve."
Tony gripped his hips, pushing him onto his hands and knees before pulling back so Steve’s hole was displayed in front of him. “Look at you. So pretty and needy. Am I the luckiest alpha in the world or what? And look at this…” His voice shifted to a low growl, hand sliding up to cup the neat package the cage had made of Steve’s cock and balls, tightly compressed and curled back so it was barely noticeable from the right angle. “So fucking pretty. And watching you release like that, over and over like you’re supposed to. Made me want to eat you alive Steve.”
Tony turned to him with a wicked grin and Steve shuddered. It was still early in the day. They had a long way to go.
Tony shook his head sadly. “Now, that just doesn’t work sweetheart. How am I supposed to get you tucked away in your little cage with you like this?” He reached out and carelessly slapped Steve’s cock. The shock of it jolted through him, making him burn. “Does my sweet little slut like that?” He slapped him again, and again. Never too hard, just enough for him to feel it. For it to start to build and ache. He could feel himself drawing close to the edge when Tony stopped.
“No! No! Damn you!” He screamed as Tony picked him up again, carrying him over to the set up. He took his time securing the upper body harness to the frame, releasing his ankles only to fasten them to the floor. Once he was immobilized, he pulled Steve’s plug free, lowering the frame to force him onto the dildo, until his skin was flush with the surface of the machine. More restraints fastened over Steve’s thighs, holding him in place.
Tony grinned. "Oh, I will. I've been thinking about that for days. But I want us both to be clearheaded enough to enjoy it when it happens. Besides, half the fun is watching you squirm waiting for it."
"So far, but I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this. We don't seem to be getting anywhere!"
"That's right. You heard me. I think I've been indulging my boy a little too much lately. Maybe I should find a way to lock that up too, right along with your sweet cock."
Tony pressed his finger to Steve’s mouth, stopping his words. “Hush. You’re fine, Steve. You don’t have to apologize for being hurt and scared. It sounds like no one from your world took the time to appreciate you, much less treat you the way you deserve. And that’s gonna change. Right now.”
The utter shock in his voice caused Tony to lean back to stare at him. He raised one highly unimpressed brow. "That's how you want to be, huh? You know, I did feed myself for years before the lot of you came along. I do know how to take care of myself."
"Absolutely perfect, sweetheart. My prototype passed all of the preliminary tests with flying colors. Started a longer functionality study this morning, and so far it seems to be a success."
By the end of the second week, it was the sounds that were driving him crazy. The low grunts and groans Stark made as he moved determinedly within Steve’s body. The high pitched whimpers and whines that mean Steve was being tormented in all the best ways. It never stopped. Bucky lay in the pile of pillows and blankets at night, hands over his ears, trying to drown out the inescapable sounds of pleasure. He wasn’t sure why it bothered him so much.
“Good. I’ve been working for hours. Now it’s time for a little fun. Up.” Steve slipped up onto the couch beside him and was immediately pressed onto his back with Tony looming over him. “Would you like to play a game, Steve?”
Already his fingers were itching to touch. To run over the sweep of Steve’s shoulders, down the flat planes of his back. To feel the weight of the well developed pecs in his hands as he squeezed. One step at a time. There were plenty of reasons that Steve might not want this from Tony. Or any Tony that wasn’t an alpha.
"Tony!" He scrambled ungracefully over the back of the couch and into the brunette's arms, burying his face into the crook of his shoulder and breathing in his scent. "Jarvis said you weren't due for three more hours."
“Good. I want to make sure I don’t scare my sweet boy away.” He dropped another kiss on Steve’s lips. Lingered when the omega became pliant and clingy in his arms. “I have some work I need to get done today. Meetings and other bullshit. And while I’m doing that, I have some plans for you.”
“We’ll see how you feel after breakfast. Gotta keep your strength up.” Tony slid free of him with a low moan, as though already regretting his decision, which was a pleasing thought. It might have been a different Tony that Steve had wronged, but at least this version was willing to let Steve atone for his mistakes. He watched as Tony slid from the bed, pulling on a robe and motioning Steve to follow him into the kitchen. A hearty breakfast was waiting on the table. Tony watched with pleasure as Steve ate, his appetite having returned with a vengeance. They spoke little, both focused on their meals. Tony finished first, leaning back in his chair to sip his coffee and continuing to watch Steve.
"Good boy." He moved away again, guiding Steve until he was lying sprawled out on top of the giant bed. "You stay right here, for just a moment. I'll be right back, gorgeous. I just want to pick out a few things."
“Yeah. Yeah. It’s um… Fine. Just fine. I’m just gonna…” He didn’t even finish stuttering out an explanation before turning and sprinting for the stairs, not stopping until he was on his floor with the door locked. What the hell was happening?
Strong hands slid up and down his cock, accompanied by sighs of pleasure and relief. But his eyes never strayed from Steve’s body. Every movement, every shudder and whine was something for Tony’s entertainment alone, and he was going to leave Steve like this as long as it pleased him. His suffering was nothing but a prop to push Tony to his release.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, it is. And… I want to keep playing with you. Especially now that I know it’s you. I want to see your face.”
Tony seated himself near Bruce and Loki, eyes never leaving his submissive. It was a game they had played many times, Tony teasing him until he was close to the edge and desperate, before backing down only to work him up all over again. It was a different experience to have an audience for their play, but before long Steve couldn't focus on anything beyond the unrelenting pleasure and denial.
Steve glanced up at Tony through his lashes, shy and a little hesitant. His voice came out a breathy whisper. “Tony, will you please collar me so everyone knows that I belong to you?”
“Please… Don’t go…” The side of Tony’s neck was wet with Steve’s tears as he trembled, waiting for the rejection that deep down he knew he deserved.
Unable to meet the intensity of those dark eyes any longer, Steve turned away, seeking a distraction. Then stopped and slowly scanned the room again. There was no sign of a cell phone. And Tony hadn’t been holding one when he burst in… “Umm… Tony? Where’s your phone?”
I've taken some liberties with extremis, so just for clarification: I predominately work with characters as portrayed in the MCU, however, extremis there is creepy, so for that I'm using a loose adaptation of the comic book version cobbled together from a little internet research and reading a lot of fanfiction. I hope that helps.
“I needed your expertise, actually. I just claimed a high needs omega. Long term suppressant use, possibly for at least a decade. Obvious malformation of the slick and omega glands. He’s a mutant with a healing factor which should help.”
When he finally spotted Steve in the doorway his face broke into a large smile. Seeing the opportunity, Steve carried the plate of sandwiches over to the workbench and dropped a kiss on the genius’ cheek as he waved the music volume down to focus on him. “Hey sweetheart. How’s my sweet little omega today?” He held his arms open and Steve immediately stepped into them, cuddling against his chest.
Steve stepped out of the elevator into the lab, immediately surrounded by the pounding beat of Tony’s music. He paused in the doorway, taking a moment to observe the other man completely in his own element. Holographs of various types were being modified or tossed aside as one of his new prototype cleaner bots climbed the wall like a spider. DUM-E was mixing another smoothie that was largely motor oil as the others tried to clean up tools and discarded parts as Tony bounced around the room from one project to another.
Not knowing what was going to happen next, when Tony would release him, or what game he would decide to play after this was part of the excitement. All he had to do was what he was told. Not lead, just follow. The denial, the control that Tony had over him was thrilling. But damn it he wanted to come already.
Dinner passed uneventfully. Tony ordered from a local Chinese restaurant and spent time teasing Steve into trying new dishes instead of always getting the same thing. It was a frequent game between them, and he secretly loved it. After they had both finished, Steve cleared away the trash and put the leftovers in the fridge.
“Such a good boy.” Tony went back to kissing him with a single minded focus that took his breath away. Steve felt his hard cock pressing into his thigh and moaned against his mouth. “Yeah? You want that? You gonna be a good boy if I let you have it?”
“It was. Not a lot of people come through the enhanced branch, you know? Thought I was gonna be there forever. And I couldn’t get out on my own. Saw some alpha’s come through, but I guess I wasn’t what most of ‘em were looking for. Then Bruce came.” A sweet smile curled his lips, as though he were happy about the memory. It was disturbing.
“Well sweetheart? What are you waiting for?” Tony moved across the room, turning one of the chairs, making a show of rearranging it so he had the perfect view of Steve’s predicament before settling in.
Steve lost all track of time, his chest heaving with exertion even though he was moving at a slow pace. Trying to keep himself moving was taking it’s toll, but each time he couldn’t stand it any longer and dropped to the ground, Tony pulled out his control and adjusted the cage, ignoring all of Steve’s begging and pleading. Every inch of his body was throbbing, part of him still craving more. A particularly hard release knocked him to the ground again, and as he felt the cage tightening further, his control broke.
In a similar vein, Tony accessed the cell network, placing a call to Banner. Bruce had made breakthroughs in treatments for omega disorders after he had chosen his own mate. He had made astonishing progress in a relatively short amount of time, due to personal motivation. If anyone could help with Steve, it would be him.
Steve allowed himself to be led into the bathroom, cleaned up, and then tucked into the overlarge bed. He felt Tony press against his back, the feel of his bare skin overwhelming. The lights went down at Tony's command, barely illuminating the bedroom.
Over and over Tony worked him up, turning him into a sobbing wreck. Every time he thought he couldn't possibly get hard again, couldn't possibly come again, Tony increased the speed of the vibrator, working him over harder than he'd ever experienced before. He writhed on the bed, moaning and pleading for Tony to have mercy on him. For Tony to keep going.
“Such a smart boy. Let’s see what you think of it, shall we?” Tony moved behind him once more, and Steve braced himself for the fall of the crop on his immobilized ass and thighs. There was a swishing sound and then a line of fire seared across his exposed hole. Steve screamed, struggling against the restraints in earnest as the crop fell again, but unable to free himself. The cool leather rested against his entrance for a moment and Steve could feel it twitching uncontrollably from the abuse. “That’s two, sweetheart. How many do you think you deserve? How many people have lost their lives because of you?”
“Oh no, sweetheart. You were a naughty boy today. Got me hard and wanting during my meeting with Mr. Collins and then got off and left me that way. It’s gonna take a while for you to make that up to me.” His voice dropped to a low growl. “And don’t think that I don’t watch you. That I don’t know exactly what you love the most, and how to torment you with it. Which is why I’m not going to fuck you. You get to sit there and look gorgeous, and listen.”
Calloused hands gripped his hips, holding him in position to take the punishing thrusts from his alpha. Tony kept him angled so every thrust pounded against his prostate and rubbed over the omega glands deeper inside of him. As the pleasure built, Steve felt his cock twitch and slowly fill. In shock, he reached out to take himself in hand, to stroke and finally find release.
There was a moment where nothing happened, where Steve was allowed to rest, then the plug came to life, vibrating viciously against already sensitive and abused tissue. He had already struggled to the point of exhaustion to no avail, this time Steve didn’t fight the restraints. The vibrations slowly increased in speed, playing one of Tony’s favorite games, and Steve sobbed as they worked him to the edge before stopping. Starting again as soon as he calmed at a low intensity before working back up again. Ramping him up until he had no concept of time or place, anything except for the agonizing burning need to finally come.
Steve woke up late the next morning, unsurprising after his struggle to fall asleep last night. He had tossed and turned for hours, body heating up every time he thought about how Tony had touched him, kissed him, casually ordered him around with every expectation that he would simply obey. And he had. Each time he had started to reach for himself, to put an end to his misery, he had remembered the way Tony's voice had sounded when he called him his good boy. He wanted to please Tony, so he waited.
Tony glanced over his shoulder briefly, shooting him a smile, before turning back to the delicate work he was doing. "Hey babe. Something wrong?"
"Considering Bruce's reaction, I'm guessing I'm not going to like it." Tony stopped, mulling it over for a moment. "It would be useful to have a magic user that's more dependable than Strange. Not that that's hard. We could sell it that way to SHEILD. That he was mind-controlled and is now working with the Avengers to make amends. Pep could get a good spin on it for the press. She can make the public love just about anyone..."
"Yes Tony." He blushed. How could they do the things they had, but it still make him blush this damn easily?
“Such a good fucking boy. I think that deserves a reward, don’t you?” Without waiting for an answer, Tony wrapped his arms tightly around Steve’s thighs dragging him back even further. Then the heat of him mouth was pressed against his rim, tongue flicking out against the sensitive skin. Steve cried out, writhing in his grasp, as Tony licked and sucked at his hole, tongue occasionally stabbing into him, the pleasure driving him insane. He felt swamped with it, overwhelmed from every side. Sharp teeth nipped at the sensitive area, and strong arms dragged him back each time he tried to squirm away.
Steve crossed the room to kiss him softly before answering. “I finally met Buck’s fella. A guy named Remy?”
The cage wasn’t painful, but there was no excess room. It would be impossible for Steve to get hard with it on. He could feel the weight of it tugging at him, a constant reminder of Tony’s absolute control over him. As the pain in his hole dimmed, the denied need of earlier surged back to the forefront, leaving him desperate and aching. His cock tried to twitch in the confines, but was prevented from even the slightest movement. A fresh flood of sobs poured from his raw throat.
Steve closed his eyes, buried his face against the sheets. “Not really, but I’m guessing you’re going to tell me anyway.”
“Good boy. Such a good boy for me. The two best boys in the whole world, and you’re both mine.” The sheer possessiveness present in the words made Bucky shudder. Tony started at his shoulders, placing soft kisses against his skin, scorching a trail down his back. When his lips pressed to the small of Bucky’s back, he wound his arms tightly around the spread thighs, ensuring that Bucky would stay open for him. A hint of breath was the only warning he received before a burning hot tongue swirled over his tightly furled entrance. Bucky cried out in pleasure, hips jerking back into Tony’s mouth. He didn’t let up for a second, licking and sucking as though he were trying to devour Bucky alive.
Steve had just begun to proudly show his rounding belly, when they attended a formal event. Tony had hovered over him, insisting he let him know the moment he grew tired or needed to leave. It was a considerable relief when Tony’s friend Rhodey had shown up and dragged the other man away. Even better when Steve recognized a face in the crowd.
Steve finally took a moment to stand still. Between getting the infinity stones, fighting Thanos’ army, then returning the stones back to where, and when, the’d come from, he’d lost all track of time. His last stop had been in 1970. He knew everyone expected him to stay. Make things work with Peggy. Have the romantic happily ever after. The problem was that Steve couldn’t do it.
Steve slowly sat up. Tony was babbling, like he did when he was nervous, which meant that something important was happening here. "Okay."
Steve shook his head again. “No! Alpha, Tony, please. You’re not listening to me! I don’t want that. I don’t want to go further away from you. I want to stay here. In our home. With you. If… If I haven’t already ruined everything… I… I want another chance. To be good for you. I-I miss my alpha… Please, don’t send me away…”
Strange nodded, as though he had already known what Steve was going to say. “Perhaps you need a fresh start?”
Tony didn’t help the situation, pulling him back and forth, turning him around again and again, as he stripped his clothes off. “Here, sweetheart. Down on your knees. That’s right. Arms here.” He guided Steve to his knees in the middle of the suit pieces. As soon as his skin touched metal, it wrapped around his calves, locking them in place and forcing his thighs open wide. He was guided into arm pieces that crossed behind his back before fastening securely. Pieces of metal, of the suit, closed around most of his body, leaving him restrained and helpless, unable to move, with only his cock and ass uncovered. Struggling against the metal had no result. No matter how much he fought, he couldn’t move even an inch. Held perfectly still, waiting for whatever Tony would do to him next.
“Good. Come on sweetheart. Let me take care of you for a bit.” Tony gently guided Steve to his feet, supporting him when he stumbled. He led him to a cushion beside a chair at the table, eased him back down to his knees. Relief flooded Steve, making him feel dizzy and disoriented. Tony was going to punish him. His alpha was going to correct his behavior, not get rid of him. He accepted bites of food from Tony’s fingers, sips of water from a glass whenever it was held down. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed there, floating on the waves of relief, but when he was finally urged to move, his wounds were healed and muscles stiff.
Tony stared at him with such wonder for a moment that Steve felt like he’d hung the sun, moon, and stars. His eyes were glassy with unshed tears, voice rough from emotion when he spoke. “It’s perfect. Thank you. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Steve. I love you more than I ever thought possible.”
"Steve..." The way he said his name was soft, like a prayer. "You are so fucking good to me, you know that?"
Steve’s eyes had drifted closed during the kiss, allowing himself to float on the sensation. He felt Tony slide down his thighs, heard soft rustling sounds coming from the box. His eyes flew open with a gasp as he felt Tony grasp his soft cock, slicking a thin layer of lube over it. He arched into the touch, hoping his alpha will keep touching him. Stroke him, get him hard, make him come.
Stark reached forward, cupped Bucky’s chin, tilting his head up. “Look at me please.” Bucky silently complied, sliding his eyes up to meet the surprisingly gentle brown ones. “I’ve had panic attacks before. It fucking sucks. You, of all people, probably have more reasons to have one than most. And when someone in my tower, under my protection, is screaming and begging for the pain to stop, I consider that a lot more important than another round of sex. Do you understand?”
He couldn't stay still, moaning and writhing, rocking back into the flickering motions of Tony's tongue. It was the best thing he had ever felt, and if he hadn't been caged, he probably would have come at the first touch. Instead it was pleasurable torture. His cock was aching inside the cage, his balls pressing against the metal ring, his ass clenching uncontrollably under the onslaught. "Tony... Tony please. Need to... Need you."
"Tony... Honey..." Steve sat up, wrapped his arms tightly around his lover. "I'm a big boy. If you do something that I don't like, I will tell you. I have before. We have a safe word for a reason. And you're so careful with me. Make me feel so... Cared for. Appreciated. Special. I'm not going anywhere." A smile quirked his lips. "I'm pretty gone on you, doll."
"You do not have my permission to come. If you are a good boy, and make it until I come back, you can have anything you want all day tomorrow. If you're a bad boy, I will tie you to the bed, spank your sweet little hole until you cry, and lock you back up in the cage again. Do you understand?"
Tony cut him off. "And what if I want to? What if I enjoy buying you whatever tiny little thing catches your fancy? Or knowing that every time you get dressed, every single thing you put on was chosen by me? Everything you eat, everything you use, everything that makes you smile. Me."
“A-all over?” Steve couldn’t help the way his voice shook. He couldn’t imagine going through that again.
It wasn’t until several hours later when he was overseeing treatment for minor wounds sustained by Clint and Natasha that Tony came to find him. The other man seemed displeased, his mouth set in a hard line. Steve felt his stomach clench. His alpha was unhappy with him, and he wasn’t sure why. Was it because he didn’t fight hard enough? Or maybe Tony was angry because the others had gotten injured. Steve should have tried harder.
Tony let his eyes run over the exhausted omega as he was released from the table. All his now. A few more formalities and he’d be able to take him home. Start his training. His cock twitched at the thought, eager to be buried inside the omega’s tight heat again. Possessiveness mixed with lust. Returning his focus to the present, Tony retrieved the bag he’d left on a table. His boy was incredibly stubborn, and as soon as he was able would fight again. Tony needed to gain the upper hand now.
Tony pinched his nipples hard, twisting and rolling them relentlessly. Steve whined as his cock throbbed in the cage, seeming to pulse in time with the stimulation to his chest. His hands dropped down to cover it, fingers sliding over the smooth metal, tugging on it restlessly.
“It’s not like that.” Tony’s arms tightened around him. “But I think it’s going to take a while for you to really believe me. That’s okay, Steve. I’ll prove it to you.”
“It’s my pleasure. Come on. Breakfast is ready and waiting. I got waffles.” Tony led the way into the living room, fixed coffee for both of them and sat down at the table. He payed close attention to Steve as they ate.
Steve flinched minutely when the elevator stopped, hiding his expression almost immediately and following Tony onto the floor that had been prepared for his Steve Rogers. Tony glanced around the space. Everything was utilitarian, with an emphasis on function rather than comfort. Hard lines and sharp angles.
I am insanely bored at work today, and time is taking forever to pass. So you get a new chapter! Partly to finish off the previous scene, and mostly because I have no fucking clue what to do with myself today. I hope you enjoy anyway. On with the show!
They spent the rest of the day relaxing. Steve had behaved well enough that Tony released his wrists, allowing him to sit at the table and eat dinner on his own. Afterwards he led him into the bath, sliding them both into the warm water. He used a soft cloth and a subtly scented soap to bathe him, not wanting to cover up the omega’s natural vanilla and honey scent. It gave them both an opportunity to relax, sorely needed after the last two days.
The blue police box (or TARDIS) outside the Earl's Court tube station and was built by the London Underground. It's a real destination for Doctor Who fans, which I imagine is something that Tony would have introduced Steve to. Honestly, if I was as talented as Tony Stark, I would have tried to build my own sonic screwdriver by now!
The music in his ears grew louder. He could hear the faint murmur of voices beneath the sound, but couldn’t make out any of the words. He was floating in a dark void, deprived of most of his senses. The pulse of the vibrations shifted, the dildo beginning to thrust in and out of his spasming passage. He screamed, choking slightly on the silicone filling his throat. He needed desperately to come, would beg for it if he could. Anything for a respite from the constantly growing desire inside of him.
“Morning sweetheart.” Tony’s voice was still rough with sleep. “I’ll never get enough of this, you know. You, here with me. Thank you, Steve. For choosing me.”
"I love you too. You have no idea how happy you've just made me. Come here, I want to hold you for a little while."
Steve’s arms wrapped around him, holding him close, offering comfort. As if he already knew how difficult all of this was for him. Tony urged him onto his knees, weight still resting on Steve’s chest. Slipped a hand between his thighs, urging him to spread them wide, exposing himself to Tony’s gaze. His heart pounded in his chest with a combination of fear and desire as Tony touched him. His cock hung between his thighs, painfully hard. Bucky didn’t know what he’d do if Tony touched it, wanted him to touch it. He shuddered, memories of pain just below the surface. “Please… Please don’t…”
Steve let himself be pulled to his feet and led upstairs. Tony was sweet and tender as he washed the sweat from his skin, placing soft kisses everywhere he went. By the time they were done and getting dressed, Steve was pliant and floating.
A gentle hand rested on the small of his back, soothingly. “I’m not going to hurt you, Steve. I take good care of my things. This is for my pleasure. To make you mine. You want to please me, don’t you?”
Tony nodded. “That… Actually explains a lot. I know who Strange is. This seems like the kind of thing he’d do. This isn’t 2012, Steve. This is 2016. It’s been three months since you tried to kill me in Siberia and ran away to go play house with the man who murdered my parents.”
Tony forced him over the edge over and over again, leaving Steve trembling and sobbing in agony. The burning didn't stop, seemed to get worse as his passage swelled around the intrusion. He came again, a soft beeping sound barely heard over the cries falling from his lips.
“Yeah? JARVIS said you went to the doctor today.” Tony’s hand slid down to press against the plug buried inside Steve’s hole. They’d learned early on that he needed to be filled to feel claimed. Since then Tony had started plugging him each morning. It made it a lot easier to stay calm. He’d picked a large one for the day, it’s girth stretching Steve’s rim with every move, and the added pressure made his knees wobble dangerously.
Tony let out a sign of relief, resting his head against the pillow. Another hurdle was out of the way. Physically. Mentally, Steve was just as resistant as always. And the next step of his treatment was not going to make him happy. Deciding to put off the inevitable at least a little longer, Tony began pressing soft kisses over Steve’s neck, pausing to suck at the scar over his bonding gland.
“What’s the matter, honey? You need me to stop playing with your little cock? Shove something in that greedy hole instead?”
He flushed even brighter as he obeyed, folding his arms behind his back and standing in front of Tony completely naked as the other man let his eyes roam over his body. He even stood and circled around Steve slowly, viewing him from every angle. "You're like a piece of art. So damned beautiful."
With that taken care of, Tony walked away to gather the supplies he needed from the cabinets on the back wall. Steve continued to scream obscenities and struggle in his restraints. He ignored it, setting down the variety of items on a table behind the angry omega. The first thing he picked up was a ring gag, waiting until Steve opened his mouth to yell before shoving it in place and fastening it behind his head. Garbled words came from around the ring, including insults to Tony’s parentage and how much Steve hated him. Tired of listening to the complaints, Tony picked up a dildo a little smaller than his own cock, sliding it into Steve’s open mouth and fastening it in place within the ring.
Tony finally slid his mouth away from Steve’s cocklet, pressing his thighs up and draping them over his shoulders. He tilted Steve back until he was at a comfortable angle, then lowered his mouth to his swollen entrance, tongue gliding over it softly, lapping up the slick spilling out of him. Steve moaned, arching his back, offering himself up to his alpha. The first slide of Tony’s tongue inside his swollen passage had him releasing again, pulsing around the slick muscle as it continued to move inside of him. He lost all track of time and surroundings. At one point, he thought he saw Bucky hovering in the doorway of the workshop, but when he thought to look again there was no one there.
"Really. You've been so good for me. This morning, you can have whatever you want. Then this afternoon, I'm going to play with you a bit, and I thought we could go somewhere nice for dinner tonight. Sound good?"
His voice dropped to the dark tone Steve was learning to love. "Did you like it? Knowing the only person who could touch you was me?"
“That’s more like it. Now, I know you enjoyed the things I’ve pulled out so far and you’ll use a safe word if you need it. Still Valkyrie?”
Tony reached out and took his hand. Gently stroked his fingers over the back until he began to relax. "Nothing to be sorry for, gorgeous. Are you alright? Is this too much?"
"Is it true you decided on the charities for the foundation by throwing darts at a list on the wall?"
The air was already steamy, smelling faintly of citrus and woodsmoke. He smiled down at the younger man, running a gentle hand through his hair. "Good choice, sweetheart. Can I ask why you picked that one?"
