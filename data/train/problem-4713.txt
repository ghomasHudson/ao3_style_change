Of which, it turned out, there were many.  So many, in fact, that Steve’s pace soon slowed to almost a crawl as he was forced to take out one of the fire-trees nearly every ten or so paces, reminding him way too much of that dystopian arena movie series he had watched with Peter not too long ago.
So either someone in Meridia got really freaking lucky with their aim—which was almost statistically impossible, based on Peter's calculations—or somehow their military found out about the mission.
"Just a taste of things to come, honey," he whispered, sending a burst of heat across Steve's chest, and forcing him to have to turn around and discreetly adjust himself.
"That legislation was shot down for a very good reason," Peter said firmly, trying to stamp down his guilt. "The Avengers are not vigilantes."
"No, I haven't seen him yet," Peter said with a shrug. "Usually he's been in here for coffee at least once already, but JARVIS said he was still sleeping a few minutes ago."
"At this point three's better than nothing," Rhodey said. "I know it's not exactly what you wanted, but it's at least a start. And once you can get those simulations up and running and the pilots get a couple of test flights under their belts, then I'm sure they'll agree to add the fourth once you present your final request to the committee."
Steve scowled, his hands clenching into tight fists. "That's ridiculous. So basically they're living a lie just to buy votes?"
"Peter!" Steve suddenly exclaimed as he pulled Peter into a careful hug. "Oh my God, little guy, it's so good to hear your voice again!"
“No problem.”  Natasha leans closer, lowering her voice.  “And you never know.  Maybe this dad will turn out to be single and cute.  Did you think about that?”
"What?" Steve cried, bolting upright on his bed. "Colonel what's going on here? You promised me that Peter would be safe!"
“Okay, but, I’m still not sure what—” Obie tried again, this time cut off by Tony’s raised hand.  He’d been planning on going over these dates himself from the documents, not even thinking that of course Steve would already have them all memorised.
Gwen tilted her head, eyeing him for a few heartbeats before reaching for his popcorn bucket. "All right. I guess the timing isn't really all that great, huh?"
A flash of red light suddenly lit up the cell, and Steve felt his hand forcibly move back to his side and his heels snap to attention, the rest of his body pinned in place by some kind of invisible energy force.
Senator Davis raised his eyebrows as a chorus of murmurs broke out amongst the committee members sitting around him. It never failed to amuse Tony just how many people seemed to have forgotten that Steve was actually lost for sixty-five years.
"Here we are," Steve said as they stepped inside the newly remodelled training dome. He tapped the white star on his chest, standing still as his brand-new Captain America uniform flowed into place. Peter, in pure Peter fashion, had been walking around in his Iron Spider suit since the moment he woke up, freshly upgraded from its time in Wakanda, of course. As was Tony's armour, thanks to a few tips from Shuri.
"Okay, so… let's see what we got here," Tony said once the hologram appeared. He ran his fingers along his goatee as he examined it, his eyes narrowing in on a layer of concrete dust that had settled deep into the elbow joint. The whole time Bucky stood ramrod straight, his jaw tight and his eyes intense.
"I know," Peter said, swallowing hard. "And yeah, I think I'd be okay. Gwen doesn't know about the ice, so…"
"Steve's temp is fine now, Tony," Bruce interrupted, quirking a sheepish eyebrow when Tony shot him a glare. "And Peter's almost there, shouldn't be too much longer, so… if Steve's feeling up to it, it's okay with me."
With a final shudder, Steve pressed a wet kiss to the cap of Tony's shoulder as he carefully pulled out of him, twisting him around to lay down on the bed. "Now it's your turn," he said as he immediately took Tony's cock into his mouth. Tony gasped, his back arching off the bed at the sudden sensation of Steve's warm, wet mouth.
And the fact that she couldn't seem to take her eyes off of Peter spoke volumes to Tony, easing his anxiety just enough to allow him to smile as they all posed for more photographs.
"I'll carry you anywhere," Steve said as he trailed kisses all along Tony's cheek and jaw as Tony took hold of his shoulders. "Tell me what you want, sweetheart. Tell me how I can make you feel good."
"I'm not uptight! What makes you think I'm being uptight? Just 'cause I helped Gwen not drop her computer doesn't mean that I'm uptight!"
"I'm pretty sure he's even stronger than me, Ma," Steve said as the rest of the team broke away from Peter's bed, heading towards them.
Guilt swept across Peter like a wave, and he bit down hard on his bottom lip as he focused on the shiny medal clipped to the lapel of Papa's uniform jacket. Papa and Dad had both said the same thing to him a bunch of times already, and while Peter could understand where they were coming from, he still stood by what he did. Papa had been literally only hours away from dying of either thirst or exposure, so if Peter hadn't managed to restore JARVIS when he did then there wouldn't have even been a wedding.
"Well, that's all the confirmation that I need then," Tony said quickly. "Long as you're in there with him."
Twenty minutes later, Peter curled his frozen hands into fists and grabbed his glasses, sliding them on so he could read what he had just finished typing out.
Which means that by the time he hits the turn, he’s in so much pain that he can barely see, much less force himself to keep raising his arm out of the water.
“Here!” Peter exclaimed, immediately ducking down into his hoodie as he glanced towards the door.  He stabbed his finger into the screen, highlighting the text.  “JARVIS, right here it says that Iron Monger would supply all the capital needed to fund the development and production of these bullets, but that all assembly and shipping would take place from Hammer Industries.”  He paused, almost too stunned to continue.  “Oh my God, JARVIS, this is it!  This is proof that Obie colluded with Hammer Industries!  This is enough to get him arrested!  He violated the Economic Espionage Act!”
Steve shook his head, wishing very badly that he could hit a rewind button or something. "I told you, I wasn't—wait… you think Stark is hot?"
Tony's heart felt like a giant ball of lead in his chest, and he probably would've just sat there all night if Steve hadn't tugged on his shoulder, urging him gently to his feet.
As soon as Tony heard Steve shut off the water, he rolled back over, assuming his usual position as Steve asked JARVIS to turn off the lights and slid under the blankets next to him. Draping his arm across Tony's waist, Steve curled his tall, strong body around him, pressing him as closely as their sleeping clothes would allow. Steve was shirtless, as he always was, and Tony delighted in the feel of his husband's soft, smooth skin against his, and the spearminty scent of his breath.
No more being plunged into the darkness every night, so only a select few can stay in the light. No more denying people basic rights, like a life-saving surgery, just because someone else doesn't believe that he's a person worthy to keep alive. And no more divided societies of military vs civilians! We are all in this together, and we must all work together in order to survive!"
"Damn," Bucky said with an approving nod. "So… it sounds to me like you just need to apologise to Tony."
It was a testament to how worn out Peter really was when he didn't even try to argue as Tony started to help him get undressed.  Getting him into his pyjamas wasn’t too bad, as Tony had done that plenty of times before, but since his brief nap had essentially glued his contact lenses to his eyeballs that part ended up being a bit interesting.  But once Tony managed to get them out and helped Peter brush his teeth, he tucked him into his bed, brushing the curls off his forehead just like he always did.
Sucking in a deep breath through his nose, Papa held it as his image came upon the battered remains of his teammate, Morita, crying out in anguish as he checked him for a pulse.
Thank the gods for military scientists and their magic formulas, or Steve might've never had the opportunity to become a Langaran test pilot.
"But this will, Dad, you just have to let it!" Peter pleaded. "I've never seen you so happy in my whole life! Not ever! You love Steve, and when two people love each other they're supposed to stay together! Whatever it takes!"
"Steve, talking to your spouse about it is fine," said Sam. "Just let me know soon, okay? 'Cause as much as it pains me to admit it, the Mets are looking pretty good this year, and I'd hate for you to miss out."
"So, you think you're feeling up to moving again?" Tony asked after a couple of minutes. He was still combing his fingers through Steve's hair, which felt so incredibly good that Steve had almost managed to forget the very reason why they were now sitting in the middle of their bedroom floor.
, Tony thought as he watched Steve climb down from his cockpit, tossing Tony a not-so-subtle wave over his shoulder as he headed towards his locker room. Since their first picnic date they'd been able to see each other every single night except two, and those were only because someone on the C-shift got sick and Steve volunteered to take their place.
Tony can only laugh. Time marches on. A desperate ugly god waiting to swallow up hope and lives but this time, this time they won. This time they stole life from it. Their time heist not only saved the universe, it saved them.
“I don’t know, Thor. This isn’t a good time with Tony,” Steve said and knew he had no excuses. He needed to do his duty as pack leader and not just a soul mate to Tony.
And he couldn’t argue. How could he? For so many months, for so many hours, he’d struggled with it. He’d donned a cloak to pretend everything was okay, that he’d found his place in the world. But his heart wanted and his mind tried so valiantly to shut it down.
Steve sobbed out a curse and clenched his teeth as he held back his orgasm. He knew that the longer he blocked it the sweeter and more potent the feed would be for Tony. With his eyes squeezed closed Steve said in little pants, “Please, please, please.”
The Hunter glances over his shoulder and smiles when he turns back to Tony. He opens his arms as if to offer an embrace. “Do you think that’s all I have? A few moronic soldiers? They are all ready to give their lives over for me. Why? Because of men like you, men from the West who think they know how to govern here in the wretched Hell that you spit at. We will bathe in your blood one day, you infidels.”
Before he left, Obie turned and said, “I’m only trying to help, Howard.” His answer was a tumbler of amber liquid crashing against the doorframe. Obie only shook his head and left. Tony watched him go, wondering if he should chase after him, beg him to help his dad, but instead he stayed firmly in place.
He searches around and finds a large round metal pizza sheet. They can use it on the rug to put their stew and bread. He collects napkins and spoons to set out on the tiny improvised tray table. After looking at his work, he spots what’s missing. “What would you like to drink?”
“I saw it. I saw it leave. I saw the entanglement and then it snapped off. But not like a light switch, like a viper attacking. It – they tried to stay linked. They tried to save the entanglement. Does that sound insane?” Steve’s barely holding it together. His large frame looks like it might shatter to pieces, falling all over the floor.
Luke smiles, knowingly, and then ambles off as if his job here is done. Steve frowns but turns back to Tony.
“Happy to provide nothing,” he pauses then adds, “take care, Steve. It’s rough when this happens, believe me.”
“Forty minutes without traffic or rain, but since Thor decided that it needed to rain all day -.” He shrugged. “Might take an hour or more.” Traffic in DC was a nightmare.
“Okay, do that.” Tony waited as Steve sent him the data. The computer then read out the code. Tony listened and smiled. “You’re getting better at this.”
He covered his face with his hands breaking their physical link. “No,” he said. Muffled. He dropped his hands. “No, we tried it already. Tony came over to my apartment when I lived in Brooklyn and we kind of tried and it didn’t work. It felt all wrong.” Cross purposes that’s the only way that Steve could describe it, as if Tony’s astral projection perfectly negated Steve’s soul. It gave him chills as he thought of it. He glanced up at her in the darkening room.
As he sits there, alone in the quiet corridor, Steve curls around himself trying not to let the cold stir within him. There are options, images of what happened to Bucky. They float unwanted to the surface and Steve cringes, gritting his teeth. Out in space there are so many horrible ways to die. Some subtle and slow, others explosive and devastating. Bucky once told him not to look it up.
As he studied the books, Tony realized he needed a map. He asked Jarvis who was able to bring him a National Geographic map of Europe, another of the Middle East, and one of Africa. Ana also placed a leather-bound notebook next to Tony’s elbow.
Jarvis steps up to his side and places a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Though Jarvis has always been the one person in Tony’s life whom he thought of as a father in many ways, Jarvis has always been bound by his own rules of conduct and civility. He nearly never touched Tony without his permission. Tony looks at Jarvis – a face kind and aged. The silver in his hair and the lines around his eyes don’t speak of an older generation to Tony but tell him a story of a life lived with experience and compassion. It’s what Tony has aspired to all these years since the crash. He only hopes that Jarvis is proud of him, what he’s done with his life.
“Last known location but it only had partial coordinates.” She waves him away as he offers a strawberry on his fork. “Allergic, Tony, allergic.”
“Like I said, I’m not who and what you think I am.” She lifts her chin to indicate they should continue forward.
Something hard presses on his chest and he heaves in a breath. A mace’s spikes stab him, and he curls over himself, touching his sternum – but he finds he doesn’t really have a sternum anymore. He whines as he opens up his ragged shirt to find a device embedded there, his bones carved out. He’s becomes something less than human.
Erskine and Peggy - going by their given names and not Jedi names since they had cast aside that part of their heritage - listened and argued that the worlds of the galaxy still shook with instability. Going forth would lead to more upheavals and could be detrimental to the future. That night, General Pierce turned on them. The encampment had been burned to the ground, Sarah and Bucky's parents managed to escape with their lives but little else.
He blinks away the wetness stinging his eyes. He sits in the cushioned chair in the room. A bag sits at the end of the bed. Tony informed him this morning that they would be leaving Korea and flying to the United States. Eventually they will end up at Avengers Headquarters in Upstate New York, but first they have the little problem of Steve’s criminal record and status. Once in the States, Steve will be briefly taken into custody for questioning and then remanded to Tony’s custody.
Jarvis cradled the little stuffed animal and walked over to the window. Staring out, he said, “You know, the legend of Blu is no fairy tale.”
“Names are Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, twins,” Maria supplied and then zipped her mouth closed as Strange scowled.
It sends him off his game, as if Jarvis can read through his poker face. He’s never been good at cards, he’s not much of a bluffer. “No problem.” Before he leaves, he asks, “Will he be okay?”
“Five, but they deliver seven different meds. I’m okay. Don’t worry about it. The brothel pays for all my meds. Natasha is a treasure, really. She takes care of her people. I still can’t believe I got a position in her Brothel without the Guild formal training.”
He hates the idea of future reference and doesn’t even know what a lock is. He swallows down his nerves and says, “I usually – I like a prime but I don’t want one here. I know they’re rare. So a typical alpha.”
“Just because I am the leader of the pack doesn’t make me more important than anyone else, Sam.” Steve rejected the idea of a hierarchy in the pack. They were equals. The team – well the Avengers needed a leader, but the pack they operated on a level playing field.
Steve swallowed down the truth about Tony – that they didn’t bond. That one of the strongest members of the Avenger team who’d had been excluded.  He might have said that he’d seen and knew about Tony – that he wouldn’t lie down on the wire, but Tony had proven him wrong. What had Steve done? Tony spat out that everything special about him came out of a bottle. Maybe, just maybe that was true. Too many nights during his time in war, he sat by the camp fire and the same horrible thoughts came to mind. It had been Dum Dum, not Bucky, not Gabe, no one else who’d come to him and cheered him up. Dum Dum pretended not to notice Steve’s melancholy about his inadequacies, inadequacies that no one recognized because they were concealed in a bright and muscular package. He failed when he didn’t bond with Tony, and that was on his shoulders – no one else’s.
“He’s resting. He lost a lot of blood but the serum’s making short work of that issue. The wounds are closing at an amazing rate. It shouldn’t be too long before he’s upgraded from critical.”
“This is your doing. I know you set it all up,” Tony replies. His irritation grows. This is one of the reasons he wanted to quit the team. In school he hated to be matched up with team members, it always meant he had to carry the load while they sat on their asses. That’s not to say that any of the Avenger members don’t carry their load, but they’re all type A personalities and that just doesn’t jive together. Literally when working with a team someone has to stand down. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen with the Avengers.
Steve pushed away vines as they walked through the path. A light patter of rain started. “And what would that be?”
He shouldn’t be doing this, he should still be angry with Tony. Yet, Tony aches through him like a distant dream he cannot remember. Steve wants so much for this to be more than what it is. Steve pauses and looks at Tony, his expression blissful and not strained with the pain and stress that so often accompanies the prince’s features. Steve stands up and pulls Tony down for a kiss. It’s hungry and seeking as desperation runs through him. Pretending this might be something more can only be called a suicidal shot. Right now, Steve throws away caring about it. He chases Tony through the kiss, wanting so much more, devouring Tony with his kiss.
Steve chuckled – actually chuckled. When did he get to be in such a good mood after being stranded in a foreign age? “No, no. I’m seeing Bruce to check up on things and then we’ll go out. You and me. And Pepper, of course.”
Bucky hurries away from the stone wall to give Sam enough wing room. Exposed he's in jeopardy so he gets down on one knee to decrease the targeting area and pulls out his rifle blaster to start picking off the troopers. In front of him the soldiers surge but Sam picks them off from the sky as Redwing calls out. The soldiers scramble for cover but Bucky leaps forward shooting and striding as he goes. With a mean arc, Sam loops downward and curves to pick Bucky up. In one scoop he manages it, but the load is heavy and he cries out curses, swearing at the weight of Bucky's arm.
“I’m not a perfectionist.” He sees the next hill. The world remains steady, not floating or rolling.
There’s a space between them; it’s colored in twilight – a silvery gray of ambiguity. “Yes.” He starts to stand and Tony’s at his side. “I’m okay, Tony. I don’t need your help.”
Steve has enough sense in him to clamp onto Tony’s side panel and stop him. They lie there, panting and in his case gurgling. At least the blood feels warm against his frozen face.
Steve follows the directions of the registration agent and ends up in the lower section following signs to the brothels. Some of them are gaudy and overly sexualized. But thankfully, the Widow’s Brothel in a quiet section with a simulated blue sky with clouds hanging over head. There are flowers growing along the walls to the brothel and a gate automatically swings open for him. He climbs the steps to the entrance.
“But it’s not,” Steve says and hungers for more. He decides he should catch some sleep before dealing with Bucky’s disappointment regarding the Rails. He ignores the insistent icon on his pad, he’ll deal with Bucky tomorrow. He needs to sleep; he strips down and finds his way to his bedroom. He never decorated it; there had been a time he would draw for hours in the cockpit of the Howling Commando.
“She’s your daughter, how couldn’t she survive and thrive?” Steve smiles and the rage decreases because for the first time he’s realized a truth that 80 years alone never told him.
“I have no problem traveling. I’m not married and don’t have any kids. So, I’m free. Exactly what does the position entail?” He perks up a little, sitting forward in the chair.
“You can guess probably. Wakanda is here for us, but we have to do the bulk of the work. I agreed. We do. It’s our problem. Wakanda seems to have their head on straight as far as vampires and Divini are concerned.” Steve sank down next to Tony. “And I have ideas, how we can appeal to the people, the everyday people, but still.”
He leaves to go and pick up Wanda. She’s already waiting for him in the parlor. Her eyes are hooded but she’s wearing a long dark red robe. He’s only in his t-shirt and torn pants. It shouldn’t matter.
"That's what he said," answered Sam. "The first few times it freaked him the hell out pretty good, but now he just kinda goes with it. As much as anyone can, I guess."
Tony wound one hand around the back of Steve's neck, pressing their foreheads together. "Oh gods, Steve, you don't need to thank me," he whispered. "You're sitting there all worried as hell after being forced by a literal dictator to defend me, and now you're gonna put your own mother in danger by asking her to harbour my son, and you think you need to thank me?"
"Prepare the tunnel, JARVIS," he said, breathing in deeply through his nose as he waited for the all-too-familiar tug behind his navel.
"Why don't we tuck you back into bed now, all right?" Steve said. He patted Tony on the shoulder, raising an eyebrow. "So he can get back to sleep? It is a school night, so—"
Tony shoots Steve a look that might’ve been kind of funny if it weren’t so downright miserable.  “You are seriously pulling rank on me right now?  Down here, where we have no idea where the hell we are, and—?”
, Peter thought, his guilt quickly replaced by panic as he realised he was still stuck to the flying sentry suit and was rapidly approaching the opposite side of the prison. He released the web, dropping down onto the damp sand with a muffled cry and breathing a slight sigh of relief when no further sand monsters appeared.
Steve sucked in a deep breath, his shoulders so rigid they were starting to ache. "Howard Stark was once a civilian scientist working for the Air Corps. He was responsible for the design of many of the aircraft flown up to and during the Battle of the Continents, and was also rumoured to be conducting research into alternative power sources due to the country's diminishing supply of palladium, the element utilised in our power plants. Approximately six weeks following the Battle of the Continents, Howard Stark was arrested on charges of treason. His trial lasted three years, after which he was acquitted and returned to his home."
"Uh huh. Well, then it says that the autopilot can only be overridden by the ugly alien dude that we blew out the hull when we were saving you, so… I'm thinking that means we're pretty much out of luck."
"And I'll go and make you some food, okay, little guy?" Steve said as he sat up on the bed. "What sounds good to you?"
Tony nodded, sucking in a slow, deep breath. Steve was right. Peter was fine. It'd just been a bad dream.
Tony looked up at him, bathed in the blue and yellow glow from the hologram a few metres away, with his beautiful face flushed and eager and his striking brown eyes staring up at him with such intense love and desire that Steve felt his heart stutter.
Tony turned on his heel, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he pressed his palm to his chest, over the arc reactor.
"Okay, first off, I'm pretty sure Steve still kicked your ass, and second, that's not really important at the moment," Tony said as he touched down onto the plain. He held his hands out to his sides, the nanite case on his chest glowing bright blue. "Thor, hit me."
"Well… from what I read, the initial critical reviews haven't been very good, but I don't really care," Peter rushed out. "For me, it'd be sacrilege if I didn't see a
"We did, and I still don't think he's a threat," said Tony. "But what he said about there possibly being other enhanced people out there who would rather snap someone's neck like a twig than help them… I mean, with the road this government seems to be heading down, I wouldn't put it past them to have orchestrated all of this to make it seem like exactly that."
"Yeah, but then when it ended up being a lot more destructive than it should've been, they went and blamed Howard because he was the only scientist officially assigned to work on the tesseract," said Tony. He slumped into his chair, his fingers tight around Steve's. "He really was framed. And the guy who helped frame him is just sitting pretty over there in Merida, propped up by the very government that should've had him arrested."
"Very good sir," JARVIS said. "New Pym Particle test number one commencing in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
, what a look!  Even there on the floor of his lab and right on the verge of a mental breakdown, Tony still felt a jolt of electricity race down his spine at the memory of just how
Papa's throat bobbed as he swallowed, cupping Peter's cheek in his hand. "You're right, little guy. You're absolutely right that people need to fight back against discrimination like this. But Peter, this is HYDRA, and you're just a child, you have your whole life ahead of you, and—"
Natasha tapped the keyboard, bringing up a picture of another old Russian book. "This is the Russian Synodal Bible, otherwise known as Синодальный перевод. What we've been able to find so far is that there are certain phrases in this text that will unlock some of the files that we recovered from the Mongolian base."
“Uh huh.  Thanks,” Peter said as the familiar smell of cheese, garlic, and marinara sauce filled his nostrils, prompting his stomach to let out another loud growl.  He found Dad already sitting at the table, his tablet in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, a deep frown on his face as he read over what looked like another grumpy email from Obadiah.
As soon as the words left Image Papa’s mouth, Papa let out a sharp cry, one so full of anguish and relief and every other emotion he’d tried so hard to keep bottled up for so long that Peter’s heart swelled at least three times its size.
"And I've got another simulator session in about five hours with two of your teammates, so it's fine," Tony replied. "You're not gonna be conking out behind the stick though, are you? Isn't this a bit late for the A-shift to still be up?"
Peter nodded, his eyes still tightly closed. "Just… way too loud. Hurts my ears. Way too bright too. It's like I could hear the cameras flashing."
"I have been told that from time to time," Steve answered. He leaned down, whispering in Tony's ear, "But I'm not the only one."
He returned about ten minutes later, showered and shaved and in comfortable clothes to find Tony sitting on Peter's bed with his arm around Peter's shoulders and Peter curled right up against him. If it hadn't been for the IV running into Peter's arm, it would have seemed as though Tony was simply cuddling him to sleep.
He just had to be very, very careful. Hope that they could actually accomplish what Natasha had been wishing for all this time, that they could actually somehow reverse the snap, was probably the most fragile of hopes that Steve had ever thought to conjure.
of kissing—Tony had spent far more than his fair share of both waking and sleeping moments imagining what Steve's beautiful body looked like underneath his clothes.
He couldn't tell them right away, not when he was scheduled to do his experiment with the MAUDE glasses in only a couple of days. This was gonna be a doozy of a confession, and he was too afraid that Dad would be so mad afterwards that he would cancel the experiment.
Which meant that Hammer's suits would most likely target the non-flyers first, which meant that he needed to somehow draw the flyers away from them, which meant that—
"Tony, where're we going?" he asked, rather frantically. "I told you, I don't want Peter to see me like this—"
Carol gave a nod. "Yes. One of our former Kree operatives was working with him a few years ago, trying to obtain one of the Infinity Stones. Thanos didn't exactly take it well when he tried to deceive him."
"Not yet, mo grá. I'm not gonna hurt you," Steve murmured into Tony's thigh as he added a second finger, with Tony's limbs going taut as he brushed across that magic spot inside him. "There's no need to rush."
"Damn right, you won't," Tony said under his breath. Despite his hesitancy in leaving Peter behind, Tony did not like Steve going off without him either. He had already upgraded the locator chips that he sewed into each of Steve's uniforms to maintain a constant lock on him as soon as he exited any of the Avengers' facilities, using a brand-new rotating transmission frequency program that Peter had helped him write over the summer. HYDRA had managed to override the locator in Steve's phone only seconds after they arrested him back in May, and there was no way Tony was going to allow himself to lose sight of him ever again.
"Well, like I said, I don't really know what it is or what it's for," Lang said with a shrug. "Just that Hank said that he needed it."
"All right, fine," he finally said, low and tight. "But just be aware that Pete's watching you, and he's gonna see you not handling things and he's gonna remember it, 'cause that kid never forgets anything. Well, 'cept where he keeps his glasses. And his backpacks, and his pencils, and—"
Six brand-spankin-new X-302 aircrafts, all just waiting in the hangar back at the base for the pilots lucky enough to get to try them out, and costing an upwards of thirty million credits.
"Steve!" Tony yelped as Steve watched Thanos struggle to replace the Power Stone, his entire body sparkling with bolts of bright purple lightning. "Honey, we've got no other choice! I've gotta—!"
"And you may as well run another diagnostic on my new suit while you're at it, and start on the render for Pete's new web shooters. Steve's planned a few training sessions for the weekend while we're back upstate."
“Oh wow!  Thanks!” Peter said as he hugged the box set to his chest.  “Um… but are you sure you're okay with me buying this?  Since it’s so rare?”
"You're alive. Oh God, you're alive!" Steve gasped as he squeezed his eyes closed, focusing in on the melodic sound of Tony's heartbeat and the feel of his long mechanic's fingers carding through his hair. His chest hurt so badly that he could barely breathe, and he knew his ironclad grip was probably hurting Tony, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to let go.
Steve did wonder, though, if the same could be said for his own country's government. Was the President still alive? The Vice-President? Any members of the Cabinet, or Congress, or the Supreme Court? What about local police forces? Prison wardens?
"Wait, so Gamora's in Wakanda? How?" Quill asked, dragging his gaze over to where his battered ship had stood. "Did she take the ship?"
Tony was quiet for a moment, his body relaxed against Steve's. "No need to be sorry, honey," he finally whispered. "To be honest, I get more appreciation from the team—and you especially—than I ever did from Howard. With him, everything I did was always just kinda… expected."
"Yes," Gwen said, smiling softly. "So I've heard. You're kinda like Harry Potter, hmm? The boy who lived?"
Peter supposed he would never know. All he knew was that he'd never been more grateful for Gwen than when she told Ned, in her polite, no-nonsense way to back off.
"Cap, I've got eight more hostiles incoming to your position," Sam said as he flew overhead. "ETA about twenty seconds."
Just like he couldn't deny Steve taking charge now, even as he'd planned to spoil him that morning instead of the other way around. Again.
"We've got about two minutes till we touch down, so you guys might wanna pop a breath mint or something."
And, he also knew that there were plenty of Special Forces troops who ran various covert missions through there.  Rhodey had told him as such.
Peter bit his bottom lip as he fiddled with a tiny section of the interface, adjusting one of the settings in such a way that would allow it to connect with the user almost twice as fast as Tony had originally calculated, reducing the margin of error and allowing the user that much less exposure to the electromagnetic field. While the field itself wasn't considered to be dangerous, Tony had postulated that prolonged exposure to it could eventually lead to headaches, as the human imagination wasn't really designed to be outwardly projected.
Yinsen is a good man. Not like Tony. Tony has issues; there's something eating Tony's brain, a parasite. He thinks sometimes he can hear it gnawing at his neurons, especially in the dark of the cave. He clutched onto the battery. They'll come for him and tell him to make weapons. Now he sees his life laid out for him bare and ugly, vulnerable and fragile. He never saw himself like this in the States. He was the boy wonder. He could do anything. He was a genius and debonair and cunning all at once. Now he feels the dearth of despair and want and hunger. He'd never been hungry before now. He doesn't think it is a physical hunger but more of an emotional one. He feels the loss of Steve and all of his dreams. It is the whole in his chest.
“I don’t doubt you will,” she says. “Because life doesn’t hand you a way out, you gotta find it yourself, or you have to dig your way out. What are you going to do, Sheriff?”
With a guttural cry, Bucky ran at Tony. But Steve – naked and vulnerable – blocked him and huffed as the air gushed out of his lungs upon impact of shoulder to abdomen. With barely enough breath, Steve had managed, “Ss-st-op. Bu-Bucky – know who yo-.” But he never finished because Bucky had one mission, one goal and that was Tony. A sweep of his arm and he flung Steve across the room to clatter and fall to the floor.
“You’re sure he’s a private citizen?” Rhodey studies him as the elevator doors close. “The one thing they got out of him before he clammed up was that his name is Steve Rogers and he’s Captain America. You know, Captain America circa World War II.”
“I want to, I want to thank you. I know I haven’t known you for long, but you helped me past Yinsen’s death, and, and saved my life. You helped me.”
Sam’s not as relaxed. He stands next to the railing with his arms crossed over his chest, not at ease. “You sure Ross isn’t coming knocking on our door come Monday?”
“Wait.” Tony walked into his penthouse apartment as the armor disappeared into storage. Even though, it still rankled that Steve had said Tony’s lifestyle was disgusting, Tony still felt a kind of responsibility for him. Especially after the soul bond search.  Should he broach the subject? Ask Steve if he needed a hand? Something? Instead, Tony settled for something more comfortable. “You
“If I did, you’d lock me up. I trust you, Rhodes, don’t make me lose that trust.” He struggles free and stalks his way to the nurses’ station, demanding to know where Steve Rogers is. The nurse gives him the information but adds that only family can see him.
I hope you enjoyed this little story. I really wanted to write a story where Steve and Tony talked, listened, and came together.
“He had a choice,” Nat said and her eyes looked far away. “He’s sick. I was there to help him, not the other way around.”
The edges of Steve’s vision blacken as he gasps for air that he cannot get. The blunt end of the alpha’s cock slams against the back of Steve’s throat and his eyes are watering. Alpha groans and the brutality of his thrusts throws Steve into a burning heat, his own cock so heavy between his legs, so wanting for a hand on it, that he doesn’t listen to the alpha. He grabs for his cock and his hand feels foreign. He jerks at himself, over and over as a twilight overcomes him, as the shade of losing consciousness. He doesn’t listen to the alpha over him, growling, telling him to stop – Steve closes his eyes and as the cock in his mouth chokes him, he orgasms and he cannot hold it back even as he loses himself.
Army grunt leaves Tony, turns his back and goes over to the workbench and throws himself on the stool. Tony’s surprised the stool doesn’t topple over. He should be grateful, Tony knows that. He should be happy he’s alive, that Yinsen found a way to keep him alive, and that Steve cared enough about a stranger to clean him up, nurse him when he was sick, and finish the arc reactor and place it in Tony’s chest. He should be grateful. Pepper would look at him with that half smile and cocked brow waiting for him to fill in the blanks.
“Let’s take a walk,” Steve had said. He needed the time to summon his courage. When he thinks back on it, it embarrasses him. A super soldier, Captain America, feared the worst.
“Well with the cat out of the bag about Barton’s family, Natasha’s not always around much anymore. She spends a lot of time at the Barton farm. And Sam’s still based in D.C., so I don’t get to see him much.”
Steve shakes his head and looks out at the clouds. “No. I’m fine.” He pauses before he changes the subject and adds, “You must like to fly.”
Sam only shook his head and glided right over Steve’s comment. “So how’d it go with the Bucky reveal?” Sam said as he made himself comfortable on the couch next to the high backs. He sipped his beer and nodded thanks as Steve gave him a plate with a pile of slices on it. Sam’s eyebrows went up. “You know I’m not a super soldier. Two – three tops is my limit.”
Tony points to the table near the cot. There’s a small pot on it with what looks to be a thin soup. When Steve peers into the beat up tin pot, and then at Tony, he says, “You can have it.”
“Please, please,” Tony cried and wished, if this were a dream, he would wake up. He didn’t want to be tormented. With a fingertip, Steve explored Tony’s cock, lightly caressing it, down to the root and then back up. All the time he bit at his lower lip, his attention focused only on Tony.
Tony licks at Steve’s hole, inserting his tongue alongside his three fingers. Steve’s hips thrust uncontrollably.
“You want to tell me what you’re being so cryptic about?” Tony had said. He focused on Steve, his eyes slightly squinting because of the angle of the sun.
“It’s hard not to realize that,” Steve had said. His frown deepened as they spoke. “I lost a lot when I went under. When I woke up, I lost everything, but the worst part of it was that I couldn’t even see her again.”
“I’m the Commander of the Honor Guard, I shouldn’t have to-.” He hisses through his teeth and tries not to let the surge of helplessness, the remembered feelings as he forced Tony to leave to overcome him. He won’t breakdown in front of the director. He always keeps his shields intact.
Tony mourns. He recalls how Steve fell down in front of him, worn and hopeless as the worst of the damage scorched across Tony’s right arm and the right side of his face. It could have been so much worse. The armor protected what it could. The nanites shielded him within their vibranium cores. But the battle caused weaknesses in the armor and that’s what wounded him. Even as they won, Steve crawled to his side and wept. He hadn’t known the depth of Steve’s feeling before that moment, he hadn’t even known his own. Yet, as the seconds drifted by and the world filled with ashes again, Steve curled around him, willing him to live, murmuring words that to this day Tony cannot remember. He wants to have the chance to ask Steve. He wants to know what Steve said. He wants another chance.
Maybe it was his own guilt and fear that kept him from thinking about Steve or even asking for a status as they flew to the Tower. His mind circled around the suit and trying to find out what else was wrong with it. Why it happened, what was next on the agenda for suit upgrades. Somewhere along the way, he found out the pilot was Sharon Carter – an ex-SHIELD agent. From her conversation with Clint, he gathered she interviewed with the CIA to join their ranks. It never occurred to Tony to worry about what happened to all the non-Hydra agents from SHIELD. He thought of Maria Hill who Pepper had hired for Stark Industries, and who seemed to do double duty with Fury – on his spy missions. Who knew what resources Fury had at his disposal.
“Oh yeah, right.” Tony focuses on the task at handle, a little amazed that they’ve each compartmentalized so well what happened out on a snowy slope.
The engines screamed to life and then their conversation ended. Tony heard Steve talking into the comm-link. “Meet at the rendezvous point in three hours. We take Strucker tonight.”
As he sits on the chair facing toward the mountain range, Steve watches as Jarvis fusses over Tony. He adjusts the blankets on Tony’s lap, ensuring that the blanket wraps around his shoulders.
Steve nods and then they get to work. Several servants come in and assist, helping Steve stow most of the lose wires, tech, and other pieces and parts that were not piled up during the previous night. He also requests several additional pillows added to the room and the servants comply quickly and efficiently. By the time they scurry out of the room after rolling in a cart with the food on covered serving platters, Steve’s antsy and nearly ready for the prince. He hurries to the bathroom removes the plug, and cleans up a little, remembering to pack a few condoms and lube packets in his pocket.
Tony frowns; Penny is a little bit of an elitist when it comes to others of her kind. “Preferences?”
Still, Tony got why Peggy would be Steve’s Guide. It made perfect sense. At first, he could put the logical blocks together and figure out how Bruce made it into the inner circle. It made perfect sense if Bruce was designated the Healer of their team. Bruce had some medical background, he could be the medic – it worked. But then Tony hadn’t been chosen – Tony had been rejected. So it wasn’t about their team. It wasn’t about the Avengers. At all.
Tony shakes his head in the dark – that’s never going to be dark again with the shining blue light as his forever companion. “No. Not anymore. I had this – this little lion.”
“Yes, I’d like to call you something other than hey you,” Tony snaps. At least he can get rid of the omega once the Council meeting is over. He can put him out of his misery. Pausing he cleanses his rising emotions as he stuffs himself back into his trousers. “If you want to die, I can arrange that. I’m not threatening you, but if that’s what you want. After – after I claim the High Alpha Chair you are more than welcome to off yourself.”
“Don’t fall for him, Steve. He’s charismatic and broken. You don’t want to fall for someone you can never have,” she warns.
Tony looks up at the tree and then back at Steve. “This is the Soul Realm, Steve, nothing is logical here. This tree – it’s part of Yggdrasil. It’s branches reach all over the universe. It provides.”
One of the Padawans had become his closest friend. They spent hours together even when the Jedi Scholar of the Archive admonished him for taking Steven away from his studies. He would apologize and Steve would find his way back to his small room to learn the ways of the Force again.
Tony lets out a breath. He doesn’t want to face Steve’s ex, but he’s the best link to all of this that they have. Bruce nods to him and they both head to the main lounge and entrance to the penthouse. Logan is standing there, duffle bag on his shoulder, and hands in his pockets. He looks like a bear just waking up after an interrupted nap. There’s no hello, there’s no polite salutation. “Where’s Steve?”
Stane audibly sighs and Steve chances another peek out into the main laboratory. He stands straight up, but his eyes focus intensely on Tony. “You know this is the right thing to do, I don’t know why you’re avoiding it.”
“Maybe. I’ve been told that more than once. You know the old genius, playboy, prince, philanthropist. So cliché yet so true.” Tony mocks – not Steve but himself.
Steve turns his attention to the selection of outfits and picks a simple dark mock turtleneck shirt with long sleeves and a pair of white casual pants. He puts on his sandals and then emerges from the closet to find Tony drinking down coffee and paging through his tablet holo-images.  When Tony looks up at him his mouth drops open and he mouths the word ‘wow’.
“Not according to our monitors. But he was agitated and awake before the Captain tried. And now,” Cho said as she looked down at Clint’s inert form.
“It isn’t probably, it is true.” And now, Tony turns strident, passionate, and keenly pointed and focused as if he has a mission, when he continues. “I intend to make this my home, Captain. I’ve been looking for some place I could spend what days I have left, free from society’s expectations. My business be damned. I have the money still, and the reputation. I don’t care, I want to leave it all behind and find peace here.”
He quickly picks his way through the clutter, hurries down the hallway, and slips into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Leaning against the door, Steve lets out a breath. Obviously, the prince is upset with him. He must be disappointed to see such a skinny, ugly thing walk in the door calling himself a sex worker. Steve bets the prince is calling Natasha now to complain. Still if he isn’t, then he’s going to be extra angry that Steve’s not even prepped. Nothing worse than a client having to stretch him and prepare him.
Natasha folded her arms and considered Steve. “He’s right. Steve never complains. He just does it, takes on more and more. It’s the way he works.”
“Can I just do that now and get it over with?” Steve asked as Bruce started to poke around his wrist. It was more than annoying; it caused a persistent itch-like pain to flare.
“So, let me take care of you a little longer. Tea and soup?” Tony asks. With a nod, Steve agrees. He could eat. In fact, soup doesn’t sound like quite enough, but it’s a start. Tony says, “I can have Vision bring it up. Wanda made fresh bread.”
They settle into watching the movie, but Tony spends more time checking if Steve’s enjoying himself. He admits he can’t deny that he wants Steve to love it, to be shocked at that revelation, to want the rebels to win. As the movie progresses, he notes that Steve’s engaged and not drifting off. He’s forgotten the popcorn by the time the Falcon is avoiding ridiculously close asteroids. He genuinely says aw when R2D2 is stuck outside of Yoda’s hut in the rain, only peeking in the window on the tips of his treads. Tony always like the droids the best.
“Well, as I hear it, I don’t have much to say about it. Your part of this stupid pack,” Bucky said and rubbed his right wrist on his pant leg. Tony didn’t look, didn’t try to sneak a glimpse of his Brother tattoo.
“Why Blu? Neither one of them are blue?” Morgan fondly touches the illustrations, pencil with watercolor. It’s truly beautiful. “But the crow has a little blue star and the lion has blue eyes. So, which one is the legend about?”
“I didn’t check in with Happy, or Pepper, or even Rhodey!” Tony yanked Steve to look at him. “I got lucky. They got out. But did Natasha get lucky with Clint? No! Clint had been made ages ago and forced to work for them because of his family. Thank whomever you believe in that they’re safe now.” He rubbed Steve’s shoulder. “No! You don’t get to take this burden on your shoulders as well. None of us do. They did this to our friends. Those bastards. Not us. Them!”
Steve doesn’t turn this time to look at her. Instead he stares into the long hallway into the transport building where he’ll take a monorail to the mating blocks. He’s heard the blocks in Wakanda are nice, civil places. He’s not worried, he’s not scared – there’s not a frightened bone in his body, anyhow.
The chains clang and the air chills. Nothing in this place – these rims of Ultron’s mind – is comfortable. He shouldn’t be surprised considering Ultron is a cold and nature killer. He shivers. What does that mean for Tony? Who Tony is?  Steve refuses to confront any reality where Tony might be a villain. He’s not. There’s no way around it. Not in his mind.
Obie steers Tony away before they protest and Steve’s left to stand in the middle of the room alone. He sighs and glances around trying to find a port in the storm. That’s when he spots the pile of auburn hair in a beautiful twisting coiffure. The red dress and headpiece serve Wanda well. Like a bullet, Steve heads directly to her. She sees him before he crosses half of the room and goes directly to him, embracing him.
Now, he shudders since he can barely move his head or lift it. He cannot move his arms or his legs. He is too weak to speak. Iron Man stands over him as he lies on the gurney. Iron Man retracts the gauntlet, the faceplate and looks down on Steve. All Steve can think about is ripping the faceplate away, how he wanted to see Tony’s eyes – how he needed – needed Tony to understand so much – that the fight was never about right or wrong. It was about love. Steve loved Tony – still loves Tony, but he will always love Bucky. Bucky will always be his family but never his alpha. He knows that he wanted Tony to understand it. He thinks maybe Tony never will.
The sadness, the distance returned and Steve only half smiled. He opened his mouth, releasing Tony’s softening cock with a quick kiss. "You want me to be more than I am but there's nothing else, darling."
Besides for Steve it has never been about a friend lending a hand; it’s been about attraction and love. Bucky might not understand it, but he’s always shielded Steve from the disdainful looks of those who would crucify him for his tendencies.
“Well, you’ve been so gloomy lately. I thought I would try a different tactic,” Steve said and then buried his face in Tony’s abdomen and proceeded to splurt raspberries into his navel.
Pepper glances again at Tony but he shrugs and shakes his head. “We’re on a tight deadline, since Mister Stark needs you for a meeting tomorrow. But if you feel inclined to have an attorney look at it, then we can reschedule your start date.” She looks to Tony again. “I suppose I can fill in.”
Natasha shrugged. “Suit yourself.” She continued to munch. Her legs were bent and her feet bare on the couch.
As he towels his hair dry a knock interrupts his studies of the prince’s exploits on the battlefront. “Come?” He’s expecting Scott or Wanda. Sure that they are going to endlessly tease him about his upcoming assignment.
“You can hardly stand and your barefoot. When did you lose your boots?” Tony says and zips closed his bag. “Sit down. I’ll go.”
“Tony, I-.” He stops and accepts the gauntleted hand offered to him. “I didn’t think I would find you.”
“Kind of feel like this is the last time we’re going to be here,” Tony said. His shoulders were slumped, curled forward. “Gonna miss it. I didn’t have a place like this.”
“We need your help?” His words come slower than expected. “He’s only just left. I think you can stop it, if you try.”
Steve listens and takes a long swig. He doesn’t usually partake, mainly because of lessons learned as a youngster, but he gulps it down and then waits as Tony checks the join.
“I didn’t intend anything,” Steve spoke and it was true. If this nightmare future would just go away and maybe Steve could slip back into a dreamless (or not so dreamless) sleep he’d be fine.
“Roger that,” Tony says but then giggles at his own joke. Steve only rolls his eyes. Tony pats Steve on the arm. “Let’s go play the happy couple now.”
“Just help me upstairs. I don’t think I can do this on my own,” Steve replies. The idea that Steve admits this small weakness should startle Tony, but he’s grateful for it and gets Steve out of the car. He takes on most of his own weight, yet he holds onto Tony’s hand like a lifeline.
“Sure. I think that would be great.” Maybe a walk in a park will take away the persistent ache in his chest about Bucky. “I’ve never actually been to a park. I’ve been to virtual-expos but not real parks.”
“Don’t worry about it. It’s not like I have to pay for it. Besides you need a phone to keep you up to date with your studies.” They had started to call Steve’s time learning everything about modern life as his ‘studies’.
The prince arches a brow at him but bows his head. “Yes. And they would over the course of just a few minutes or so stretch you and supply lubrication.”
Tony relented and gave over the controls of the suit to JARVIS so that he could spend his time scanning the river for the shield. It didn’t take too long. When he arrived in the new armor he’d just built to find that chaos in the skies of DC, Tony had concluded either that Steve and SHIELD were under attack by unknown hostiles or that the reality that Steve was a fugitive from SHIELD might be the worst-case scenario. But then JARIVS alerted him to the data dump of all of SHIELD’s secrets onto the web with the salient parts being highlighted. SHIELD was Hydra and Steve was fighting an old foe.
It’s the last thing he expects and the first thing he feared. He swallows back his anger and says, “Why?”
“I didn’t know,” Tony says, and he hasn’t moved away. He’s close to Steve, in his arms. “I haven’t been exactly inviting or flirty with you.”
The small entourage walks the gantry to the entrance way that leads to the stadium. Right at the doorway. Obadiah Stane waits with a perplexed look on his face and a sideways glance at Steve. Thankfully, he ignores Steve and focuses back on Tony.
“No.” Steve runs a hand through his hair and then inwardly curses. He spent too much time primping to just ruin it all now. “JARVIS, do you know why the Strike Team is on board? I thought the prince had his own security. Earlier the duchess protested.” Happy seems like a fine chap to Steve.
“Tell me you’re not curious why Fury knows so much about soul packs. How SHIELD can test to confirm. They are using soul packs and spreading lies that it’s just a myth. They want to control you.”
“You’re a Captain in the US Army. He’s a playboy and a scoundrel. I’d think you’d be a little less impressed.” The woman stands there, smugly smiling at Steve like she’s caught him in her net.
“And what kind of warrior would I be if you did that? I am your lead warrior after your Master of the Fleet. You won’t do that. You can’t do that.” He knows the ways of the Council and the Families that run the Council and the government – that’s obvious. He isn’t cowed by simple words or threats that Tony cannot go through with.
They walked amicably with Clint’s bow at the ready. As they trudged along the wooded path, Steve said, “It mustn’t be too bad considering you’re out here.”
“Gah, I thought you wouldn’t swear, you know,” he says as he forces himself not to writhe with the pain. “I thought you would be a goody two shoes, all angelic and everything.”
“No, they won’t,” the omega says and there’s a tiredness in his expression that longs for death. “You’ll never convince them to let me go.”
“Well, there is an arm of the clinical trial which really isn’t a phase 2. It’s more of a phase 1, looking at safety, but it will be using nanites to home.”
Steve grabbed hold of Tony and used all his strength to keep him from charging Bucky. “Tony, you know better than this. You understand that he was used, abused.” Even as he spoke the tears stung his eyes, though Steve didn’t know who he was crying for - Tony or Bucky. “Please, stop.”
“Here we go!” Clint cries out and the whole ship lurches forward into hyperdrive. Bucky sags in his chair for a moment, knowing he doesn’t have any time. He needs to go and check on Steve.
Logan leans against the corner of the lab near the exit. His eyes are lidded with shadows and he’s become more reticent than he usually is. Bruce studies Tony, his one arm crossed over his chest, the other propped on it as he strokes his unshaven jaw. They wait. Tony crosses over to a computer terminal and starts playing with numbers, ways to test the nanites. He pings the ones running around in his blood. They ping back. He figures the nanites are good for at least five years, after that they’ll have to reinject. Bruce stands over his shoulder. He rocks slightly as if he’s trying to sooth himself.
Steve’s hand on his shoulder, slung over Tony’s pectorals should have comforted him, eased his worries. “Natasha will be there. I’m not doing this alone.”
Tony remained mum. The pressure of his choices, of what happened in the past. weighed on his shoulders, though he never felt like Atlas but more like Sisyphus. The burden of his past was only a rock on his shoulders that he trudged up a hill over and over only to have it roll back down again.
Clint stood to the side of the puddle of light encircling Steve. What he saw, Steve refused to be ashamed. Steve stared straight ahead, ignoring Clint. The ball gag still stuffed in his mouth. He stunk of blood, and urine, and come. His chest had been torn by the vampire. His abdomen ruined by the nanobots that burnt themselves out by flaying and charring his epidermis. He still felt the burn on the side of his head where Rumlow shocked him. His mouth tasted like the plastic of the ball and his lips cracked and chapped.
“Anything for the Sheriff,” Darcy says as she walks out. She’s in her apron with trousers. Tony doesn’t say a thing about her dress and, for that, Steve’s grateful. He’s not especially interested in Darcy taking out her small lash and smacking Tony with it. She keeps it secure to her belt, on most days.
“You said we need the implant to home the virotherapy to the target.” Tony’s interest is piqued, but he refuses to get his hopes up.
“More,” he pants. His voice rasps. Just as a tease, Steve rotates his beard and Tony sobs out his need. “Fuck, please!”
Before he even touches his suitcase a guard steps up to him, takes it and his shoulder bag. “Thank you.” The guard does a small bow to him and then they all enter the sleek ship that leaves Steve breathless with its beauty and functionality.
The wine helps. It’s not to say that Sam is rude or rough. In fact, he’s a tender lover and caring about Steve’s wants and needs. He kisses softly and he always checks in to find out if he’s enjoying himself. Steve feels like the client more than the whore with Sam. When Sam takes him from behind and Steve’s crazy with need, shoving back on the thick cock thrusting inside of him, Sam growls and says, “You’re so perfect. God I could fuck you all day.”
Anyone observing would say that Steve is asleep. The doctor that still hangs behind Tony confirms it. “He’s only sleeping but no matter what we do, he’s not waking up.”
Slowly, he begins to kiss again, taking his time. Kissing and tasting where Tony will allow until he’s bringing his cock to life again with his mouth. Tony writhes and cries as Steve brings him to fruition. He swallows the bit of semen, realizing he never grabbed a condom. He tells himself it doesn’t matter.
Tony shakes his head. “Nope this is my invention. Something I figured out in my untamed youthful days. I keep a supply with me at all times.” His tone deepens. “It only makes the experience more pleasurable.”
Steve reaches for the first serving platter, grabs the silver cover, and lifts it. “You don’t get there often anymore?” The platter reveals a lush green salad with the zing of a vinaigrette sharp enough to sting his nostrils.
She gathers him to her and embraces him. He can smell the beta pheromones drifting in the air about her. Her scent is strong and vibrant, so different than Steve’s. She holds him until the sobs racking his body settle and quiet. When they part, she looks him in the eye and says, “I’m going to go and get some coffee, something to eat. Are you going to be okay?”
"Peter," Papa finally choked out, tears welling in his eyes. He reached a shaking hand up to cup Peter's cheek. "It's really you? You're not—you're not just another HYDRA trick?"
"Um… Dad?" Peter said, grabbing onto a crooked lamppost as he strained to hold onto the web. A second later the lamppost tore away from the ground, carrying Peter up towards the blue light. "Dad, I'm being beamed up!"
"Let me double-check with Tony first, but it should be fine," added Steve. He popped the cap on his Powerade, taking a long drink as they headed towards the bank of elevators. "Thursdays Peter stays late at school for Robotics Lab, so I'll just have to make sure that we have a backup available to pick him up if Tony gets delayed."
"That's right, Papa," Peter piped up from his chair on Tony's opposite side, where he was covered in so many various layers and blankets that Tony could barely still see him. With Peter's unstable body temperature, he had to be extra careful whenever he was out in the cold, and was currently appropriately dressed for a climb up Mount Everest. Tony had imported his down parka from Siberia—he'd ended up purchasing six of them, given Peter's tendency to misplace things—under which Peter was wearing two of his Spider-Man suits with their own built-in heaters, and a separate heated undershirt as well.
"And you know I wouldn't ask for anything but your honest opinion on it, mo grá," said Steve. "We'll just take this one small step at a time." He drew Tony close again, his entire upper body trembling in anticipation. "One step at a time, so we don't get ahead of ourselves."
"It's kind of a long story, little guy, and I'm not sure Thor's up to telling it again just now," Papa said gently as Peter sat down next to him. He curled an arm around Peter's shoulders, kissing the top of his head. "Just suffice it to say that he's going to be staying here on Earth for the foreseeable future."
"Banner's lab was covered in scorch marks," said Tony. "And from what Phillips told me no one's dared to go down there since he went kaboom, so—"
"Yeah, okay, but can we talk more about this once we get out of here?" Peter said. "'Cause I don't really think that—"
"Yeah, I guess," Peter said, trying to ignore the sharp pang of guilt that shot through him. "Is that what Uncle Bruce is doing now? Working on the files?"
the smell of those fucking cigars.  “JARVIS, go ahead and bring up the schematic and run the simulation, yeah?”
"Y-yep," Dad said after a heartbeat's pause. "I mean, he's still in school so he's only like, part time. You know, like a nights and weekends kinda thing. But you've already seen him in action, so you know how good he is. And he's even got a uniform."
Huffing out a sharp breath, Tony exited the lab and padded into the kitchen.  It was lunchtime, or somewhere thereabouts, and one thing that he’d promised Steve before he left was that he would try to eat regular meals while he was gone.  Of course, to that end, Steve had made sure to stock the fridge and freezer with plenty of easy-to-make things, including more of the homemade bagels that Tony had come to love almost as much as the man himself.  Retrieving one of the sesame seed variety out of the freezer, Tony popped it into the toaster, pouring himself a fresh cup of coffee while the kitchen slowly filled with the scent of toasting deliciousness.  After smearing each half with a generous portion of cream cheese, Tony carried his makeshift lunch back to the lab, where he quickly became engrossed in one of his newest suit designs as he ate, thankfully remembering to wipe the stray bits of cream cheese from the corners of his mouth just as JARVIS announced that the Board of Directors were on the line.
“So as not to cause an international incident, you’re going to go hunt down a grown man and force him to come back?” Tony asks.
“Hi Colonel, do you remember me, I’m working for Tony Stark,” Steve says and winces. That’s the worse introduction he’s ever heard. “Steve Rogers. I’m Mister Stark’s Personal Assistant.”
“Anything?” Steve says. Tony’s doing this to distract him. It’s a great tactic, because it’s working. “Sure, why not?”
Steve frowned but went back to the phone’s display, reading it aloud. “Most soul packs have specific characters or roles. Leader, sentinel, friend, confidant, guide, lover (beloved). Soul packs are ever evolving and could take up to five years to form.” He inhaled, held it to steady his nerves, and then exhaled. “Five years.” He continued to read.
Tony steps in the path of the guards. “No. None of that. He won’t try and escape. You have my word.”
“I’m not sure,” Cho answers. She set up a series of monitors in the room. Wires crisscross between the beds and the occupants.
Thor stood in the center of the waiting area. Mjolnir had been dropped on the floor next to him, but enough in the path of nurses and doctors that they had to step over it or around it. One of the nurses was standing next to Thor, explaining something to him but he acted too distracted to answer. Natasha took control almost instantly.
Finally out in the car, Tony dumps everything in the trunk and then drives up the road to a small Motel 6. He pays for the room and goes to it. It creeps him out, and he wonders if he’ll have bed bug bites from the place but he doesn’t have time to worry. It takes him longer than he wants to make the small explosives in the Christmas decorations, and the electrified oven mitten. It has exactly one charge so he has to use it judiciously.  He makes the rest of the bomb balls and then loads them all up into two shopping bags.
“You’re happy? Settled down like this?” Steve thought about the brand on Clint’s arm and the guilt welled up enough that the acrid taste of bile filled his mouth.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks. Steve hasn’t spoken much since their little impromptu luncheon on the jet. The shock of everything might be taking its toll.
“I don’t think so.” She knocks his knee with her own. “Frigga knows these things. You didn’t get a happy ending. So don’t lie about that.”
Jane stands and rounds her chair to come over and hug Steve. She kisses him on each cheek. “If it hadn’t been for your beautiful art we wouldn’t be where we are today.”
Tony’s wearing gloves. He’s also wearing a set of goggles. His hands fly in the air as if he’s playing a piano directly in front of him. He turns and spins as he works. What he’s ‘seeing’ Steve hasn’t a clue. It looks like he’s directing an orchestra or dancing – dancing to silent music. Tony’s wearing a dark muscle shirt and a pair of tight jeans that sculpt to his body. The curvature of muscles and tendons line his arms making the movements all the more graceful and powerful.  The black jeans he wears hugs his body close and Steve finds he cannot drag his focus away from Tony’s body, a strength mixed with elegance. He licks his lips and then realizes what he’s doing.
"Given the time required to construct the containment device for the tesseract and satellites and train the pilots for their extra-atmospheric activity, I'm estimating that Project Phoenix could be ready for implementation in as few as three months, give or take."
"Well, honey, I know you just said that you don't think this is the kind of tired that sleep can fix, but maybe you should try and catch a few winks, yeah?" Tony suggested. "It's been awhile since you've gotten any sleep that was more than a ten minute catnap."
If Rumlow was indeed responsible for Steve’s abduction, then he’d better damn well watch his back.  Because once Tony got his hands on him, there would be no level of hell, Hel, or any other form of underworld deep enough to protect him.
"Seems like you're a bit more than 'kinda' tired," Steve said as he took Peter's popcorn bowl. "C'mon, little guy. Time for bed."
Peter thought frantically as the monster swung again, knocking Peter from his perch on the wall and onto the sticky and gross theatre floor. Peter grimaced as he saw that he had barely avoided landing on top of a wad of gum that was almost the size of his fist, quickly getting to his feet to find Uncle Bucky trying to punch through the wall with his metal left arm, with Gwen still held tightly in his right.
"That time was not pleasant for any of us, Your Highness, but especially not for Tony and Peter," Steve said firmly. "As I'm sure you can understand."
"All right. John, Cam, and Majors Lorne and Kowalski are planning on coming too, as long as there's enough space," said Sam. "Figure it can't hurt to have as many people cheering Peter on as possible."
"Well, hello there," Steve murmured as he ran his palm along the smooth dash and the shiny, never-before-touched controls. The cockpit even had that 'new aircraft smell' that no one aside from test pilots could ever understand.
"You gave up all the rights to your wardrobe the second you married me, honey," Tony said, groaning in frustration as Steve once again refused to touch him where he needed him most. "What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine, right? The fact that you can't fit this god-like body of yours into anything of mine is completely beside the point."
Peter grimaced, glancing sheepishly at Strange. "Well, if what Dr Strange just said is true about how fast we're going, then we'd first have to figure out how to drop out of warp. We can't make course corrections while we're at warp speed, Dad."
"Thank you," Peter said as he climbed into the truck's passenger seat. As soon as he'd fastened his seatbelt, he tipped his head back, rubbing at his temples.
Steve chuckled as he leaned over to kiss the back of Tony's hand. "You know they always do. Bucky still thinks Peter hung the moon, so…" He trailed off, again shaking his head at the true absurdity of what had been the last several weeks. Scott Lang's sudden appearance at the Compound. Figuring out the quantum tunnel. Spying on the parallel universes, and getting to see his ma again.
"Steve," Tony said as Steve unlocked the building's front door, holding it open for Tony to walk through. "Honey, we need to get you something to eat, yeah?"
Steve didn't know what was worse: the fact that someone who didn't even know him was so harshly judging not only his intentions but also his integrity, or that at least a third to a half of the other senators seemed to be agreeing with Davis's remarks.
And now the cool metal tags resting against Tony's skin were a constant reminder of his desire to be reunited with his soldier.
"I'm still here, Tony," answered Steve. "But all my controls are frozen, and I can't—I can’t break orbit."
“Acetylsalicylic acid.  As you wish,” JARVIS said as the diagram brightened from blue to red.  Tony’s heart fluttered as the device simulated the conversion of raw chemicals, at a cost of mere pennies on the kilogram, into a supply of pure aspirin powder in a matter of about sixteen seconds.
"Worse? Oh, but isn't that one of the reasons why you love me so much?" Tony said with a wink. "You know I love to make things difficult."
He had already finished half of his tea by the time Tony reached for his hand, his long, calloused fingers warm as they curled around his own.
that he either couldn't understand or didn't care about what the adults were saying at any given time. The fact that he'd been out of school for so long only added to that stereotype, which meant that Peter had overheard people talking about a lot of things that he really had no business listening to.
"Well, if he does happen to ask, we don't want him knowing what's going on here," Steve insisted. "Tony and I will tell him when the time is right."
"I'm not sure you can say completely innocent when he's the one who came up with this whole crazy idea, but I do get your point," said Phillips. "And he will live, Tony. Like I said, I've got a whole plan in place just for him."
"Hey, nothing wrong with holding a girl's hand at the movies, Barton, long as that's all he's doing," Tony said.
Thor paused in mid-swing, ducking to allow yet another chunk of debris to sail over his head. "If you are referring to the time when I bested you and the Captain in combat, then—"
yelled Tony, his heart lurching when Peter flinched and clapped his hands over his ears. He immediately reached for him, tucking him against his chest. "I'm sorry, bud. I just—" He broke off, unable to finish the sentence.
"Mmm," Steve mumbled, his fingers tightening around Tony's hand. "To tell us that he might know a way that we could—we could fix things."
"Pardon me, sir, but Chief and Miss Stacy are down in the Tower lobby and are requesting access to the penthouse."
“Well…” Tony stammers, wishing like hell he could feign having to pee or something to end the conversation.  “I might’ve checked out his hands too.  You know, the appendages attached to the above mentioned forearms.”
"Pardon me, sir?" JARVIS asked, startling Tony so badly that he nearly fell off his chair. "I didn't quite catch that?"
As soon as the word left his mouth Steve pressed the button and immediately yanked the stick to the left, holding his breath as he waited for the master alarm to start beeping, indicating that he'd missed the window.
"The lab has never been properly decommissioned, Master Peter, so I would assume that it is still functional," JARVIS answered. "However, it has not been used since Ms Potts took over as CEO."
"Please, sweetheart," Steve murmured when Tony propped himself up, staring at him with lust-blown eyes still laced with concern. "Please… I don't wanna think right now. I just wanna feel. Please—"
"Yeah, I guess." She squeezed Peter's hand, giving him one final peck. "I'll call you as often as I can, okay?"
Mr Clean shot Peter a bizarre look. "He made himself a penis. Surely you are old enough for your father to have taught you how—"
"Thor? Why Thor?" Steve asked. "You think these dreams have something to do with the infinity stones?"
And when he was ready, and had flipped over onto his back, his eyes never left Tony’s face as Tony hiked his legs up and carefully pushed inside him, clamping down hard on his bottom lip so he didn't come too soon and ruin it.
"Yeah, I'm sure he did." Tony blew across the top of his mug before taking a generous sip, closing his eyes as the hot liquid worked its way down his throat. Having HYDRA out of the picture would eliminate a good amount of the stress that Tony carried, especially where Steve and Peter were concerned. HYDRA had been haunting Steve for over seven decades, a proverbial thorn in his side ever since he'd joined the army back in 1942.
"Well, that's definitely the truth," Peter muttered. "Not like it's been driving Papa bonkers lately or anything."
"Yeah. I've never had it before, or at least, not that I can remember." He dropped his forehead against Tony's shoulder as his arms slipped around his waist, tugging him closer so he could feel Tony's heart beating against him. Being close to Tony could always chase the demons away, if only for a little while, and Steve needed him now.
"That I didn't like gals?" Steve asked. "Yeah, she did. I didn't know that she did until Tony and I went to visit her during the whole Project Insight mess, but apparently she had at least guessed it back during the war."
There was a short pause before JARVIS replied.  “Pardon me, sir, but I just want to ensure that I heard you correctly.  Did you say, Regina Williams?”
"Oh no!" gasped Peter, shaking his head in a feeble attempt to clear it as Chief Stacy's body hit the wall with a sickening
It really couldn't have been a much more laid back first date.  Having Peter there to break the ice and fill in any awkward silences meant that the conversation hadn’t wavered for more than a few seconds and that there had been no shortage of laughter, especially when Peter started telling stories about some of the students in his chemistry class.
"Thanks, Papa," Peter said, smiling softly. He had witnessed his dads being so lovey-dovey with each other so often during the last nine weeks that it was almost funny. They could barely pass each other in the house without stopping for a quick kiss—and sometimes even a not-so-quick one—and now that the television people had started to bring back shows and movies that used to be considered "inappropriate", the three of them would often pile onto the squashy couch in the living room and watch together in the evenings, with Dad sitting with his back to Papa's chest and Peter cuddled up next to Dad, Papa's hand resting on his shoulder.
“How many more—it doesn't matter how many more!” snapped Obie.  “What matters is whether we’re ready to go when they need ‘em!  And we can’t do that if you’ve completely reconfigured the assembly line so you can build toys!”
"Don't you think it would be better to wait for us inside, little guy?" Papa asked, glancing worriedly into the rearview mirror. "It's pretty cold outside, and according to the weather it's not going to warm up anytime soon."
"Mmm." Tony tipped his head back, thudding it against Peter's headboard. "Go to sleep, hon, yeah? I'll be fine."
he thought as he ran his palm down the cozy fabric, swiping at an errant tear as he heard Papa calling from the kitchen.
"The glasses, yeah." Tony huffed out a long breath as he looked up at his husband, the unbelievably gorgeous man who loved both himself and his son beyond all reason. Steve's jaw was tight and his worry wrinkle was fading in and out, but Tony could tell that he was trying hard not to give into the panic simmering just beneath the surface, something that wouldn't have been possible only a couple of weeks ago.
Regardless, it made him feel sick to his stomach now. To think that an innocent child like Peter lay suffering in a hospital bed because of a correctable illness while the national leaders squandered millions of credits just so they could live in the lap of luxury… well… it was deplorable, is what it was.
"Please," Tony pleaded as his hands latched onto Steve's shoulders, trying to pull him up. "Please, baby. Need you right the hell
"Gwen, I know, and I really appreciate it, okay," Peter said. "I'm just—I guess when I'm with you I'd just like to be more… normal. Just be myself, without all the superhero stuff. Does that make any sense?" He didn't add that the vision of Gwen crashing to the ground had rattled him a lot more than he wanted to admit, and that he had already thought way too much about the possibility of some future bad guy intentionally targeting her just for being his girl. Obie had targeted Papa for the exact same thing, so Peter knew he wasn't just being paranoid.
Steve just desperately wished that he could erase the image of Tony's out-of-control suit crashing into the stone wall of that Miami bunker from his mind. It was that image, accompanied by the horrible sound of metal slamming against stone at forty kilometres an hour that constantly haunted Steve's dreams and had terrified him during their recent missions.
"Yeah, we'll see," Tony said, pursing his lips when Steve frowned at him. "Probably, honey, okay? Let me see what I've got to work with first, yeah? I wouldn't put it past Beck to have stomped those glasses of his to bits before he was kicked out of the building."
"Yeah, yeah, so you say," Tony muttered. He bit down on his bottom lip, contemplating. In all of his research into the effects of essentially going back to the past, he hadn't been able to answer this particular question to his liking.
It was a multi-modal program. Tony had initially planned it as an innovative means of national defence that while costly up front, would help save the government money in the long run by reducing the need for constant weapons upgrades and round-the-clock air patrols.
"We tried, Mr Stark," said Sharon. "I called up to the base looking for you this morning, and I was told that you could not be interrupted."
"No kidding, Mr Optimistic," said Natasha as she got to her feet a few metres away from Steve, brushing dirt from her uniform. "Now, let's finish this!"
Pulling onto the runway, Steve quickly scanned the sky, again not seeing anything out of the ordinary. The D-shift was still up there, as they had all planned to stand by in the air in case the A-shift needed backup support, but there was no smoke or fire trails from missiles trailing from the Meridian border, nor could Steve hear any machine gunfire.
"Mr Stark?" Stacy suddenly said over the comm. "I have Captain Rogers here, sir, he's been released from his cell."
It wasn’t too unlike the missions he had conducted during the war.  The only difference this time was that there were no Howling Commandos to back him up.
" he purred, sliding his palm rather provocatively up Steve's thigh. "Are you trying to proposition me?"
Steve's throat tightened. There was absolutely no doubt in his mind that Sarah Rogers would have adored Peter Edwin Stark.
"No, I can do that by myself," Peter said quickly. "It's at least one thing I can still do by myself. I just need a little help standing up since I get lightheaded really easily." He held out his hand towards Steve, who took it carefully, as if it were made of porcelain. "Is that okay?"
Tony shook his head, trying like hell to keep his mounting rage in check. To discriminate against a helpless child just because his grandfather happened to be a certified asshole was so thoroughly disgusting that it should've been illegal.
“Good.”  With a sweet kiss to the tip of Steve’s nose, Tony rose from the bed and headed into the bathroom, returning with a warm cloth.  After cleaning the come from Steve’s chest and stomach, Tony tossed the cloth into the clothes hamper and crawled in next to him, curling his gorgeous lithe body around Steve’s.
"That's exactly it!" Tony exclaimed. "'Cause we are technically using it as a tunnel, which means we'll be travelling through it just like a ship that's travelling at warp speed."
"Yeah, but we're not trying it out on anyone until we're a hundred and ten percent sure that we're right, bud," said Tony. "And that's not gonna be for awhile. Okay?"
“Gentlemen, I must insist that we get going,” Thor says, still dangling awkwardly from his tether.  “This is not exactly the most comfortable of positions, and—”
"Nat, do you really think she'll be able to help us somehow… reverse this?" he asked after a short pause. Steve honestly couldn't see how the snap could ever be reversed, but then again, he'd never expected to meet a woman who could literally fly through space on her own either.
"Just turned it over to Hill," Natasha said as she and Thor reached their group. "She's going to take it with her back to the Compound."
She tilted her head, as if she was trying to remember that she actually had a name. "Wanda," she finally said. "Wanda Maximoff."
Growing up as a closeted gay kid in Brooklyn, Steve had never even dared to dream that he might someday have what he’d always wanted: A husband who loved him for who he was, and a child he could call his very own.
Peter's eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Uhh, thanks, but my heart's not strong. It's kinda all busted up."
"Think you've got a screw rattling around in there or something, Hawkeye," she said as Clint clapped his palm over his ear.
"Tony, wait," Steve said as he caught Tony's hands, sucking in a deep, shuddering breath as he shimmied so he was sitting more upright. His mind was a haze of want, and he was so hard, harder than he'd been in a very long time, and could feel that Tony was as well, but…
So as it stood, they now had the support of the entire group of X-302 pilots, with Steve's next step being to discuss the plan with the pilots of the other patrol shifts. He had told Tony the night before that Major Lorne had even offered to help put out feelers for some of the B-shift pilots since he was pretty good friends with several of them, a nice demonstration of loyalty that not even Steve had anticipated.
Emotion welled up inside Tony, so strongly that one of the tears he'd been trying to hold back finally escaped, rolling its way down his cheek. Steve's words, spoken in the old Irish language he used to speak with his ma back when it wasn't really all that cool to be a young Irish lad in New York, were the perfect soothing balm to his insecure soul. Tony could still remember his shock when Steve first spoke in the language to him, during their honeymoon. After watching Steve frolic in the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea all afternoon, his hair soaking wet and his sun-kissed skin dotted with water droplets, Tony hadn't believed that his husband could possibly get any sexier.
Soo… it seems we have a bit of mutual pining going on, hmm? 😉 The next chapter will have a small time jump, so we’ll get to see how things are progressing, both with Peter’s swimming and with Steve and Tony 💗
"Hey, buddy!" Tony exclaimed as he swept into Peter's room, the harsh scent of oxygen and sterile gauze mixed with strong disinfectant assaulting his senses. He skidded to a halt next to Peter's bed and immediately pulled him into a hug, burying his nose into Peter's curly hair.
Such a rich colour of brown flecked with bits of green and gold. So beautiful—and somehow familiar? How was that possible?—and yet laced with an underlying layer of such intense sadness that it both pained Steve and intrigued him at the same time.
"It might not even be HYDRA, honey," Tony said gently. "But even if it was it would be a pretty bold move for them, especially after the disaster that was Project Insight. No, there has to be something else, something either so secret it's gonna be damn near impossible to find, or something so obvious it's gonna hit us right in the nose and then we'll spend a month or so kicking ourselves for missing it."
“Eh, not too bad,” Peter replied through a mouthful of marshmallows.  His eyes narrowed as he watched Tony take out a small bottle of orange juice, downing the whole thing in a few quick gulps.  “Looks like you didn't though.”
"Yeah, well, that kinda comes with the whole parenting gig, bud, and you know it," Tony said. He kissed the top of Peter's head, grateful he could still reach it with how fast Peter had been growing lately.
"Oh. Okay," Peter said with wide eyes as he picked up his pencil. Being the only child of two only children, Peter really had no experience with sibling dynamics. Even Ned was an only child.
Steve huffed, his shoulders sagging as he burrowed even further into Tony's pillow, holding his breath until his lungs started to burn and he couldn't hold it any longer.
Steve's stomach growled then, and Tony couldn't help but burst out laughing. "Guess we should feed you before we sleep, hmm?"
“That’s exactly what this is, little guy,” Steve choked out.  He reached for Peter’s hand across the table, squeezing it gently.  “I know you already call me Papa, but I was hoping… well… I’d just really love to make it official, and—”
Instantly, Steve's face changed, becoming almost predatory as he settled himself over Tony, careful not to pin him too firmly.
“Morning, buddy.  Sleep okay?” Tony asked as he planted a quick kiss on the top of Peter’s head, catching a whiff of his green apple shampoo as he stood back up and headed for the refrigerator.
He was compromised, and a compromised Captain was never good. Especially when they were dealing with HYDRA.
"You think he's ready for bed?" Steve asked a few heartbeats later, his voice so low and husky that Tony let out a shudder.
"Mmm, if you say so," Steve said warily. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "I don't know, Tony. I can't shake the feeling that by trying to protect him, I'm somehow pushing him away."
" Steve gasped as he crossed the rest of the distance in only three strides. He instinctively reached a hand down to help Tony to his feet, his heart leaping when Tony grasped onto it.
"A lot of things have changed since then, sweetheart," said Steve. The twirled the ring encircling Tony's finger. "Haven't they?"
“Yes,” Pepper said, not without a touch of sympathy.  “I’m sorry, I tried to tell him that you weren’t in yet, but I’m afraid he insisted.”
"Well, if nothing else, you sure look damn good in it," Tony added. "Not that you ever don't, but you know what I mean."
"But what's he doing here?" Peter asked as he swung even closer, squinting as he focused in on the street. "And where's Uncle Thor?"
"It's okay," Peter said in a small voice. He flopped down into the squashy armchair opposite the couch. "I take it there hasn't been any good news?"
“You know he’s only too eager to get involved, Mr Stark,” Pepper said, rather warily.  She leaned closer, lowering her voice.  “He says he always knew there wasn’t something quite right about Mr Stane, but never wanted to say anything.”
"Нет," Winter Soldier said, so softly that Tony at first thought he had only imagined it. The colonel started, obviously shocked at hearing anything other than what he had expected.
It also explained the intense stress that Steve had noticed in Anthony. He couldn't imagine the pressure Anthony was under with such a sick child, and, as busy as Steve imagined Anthony was, he also knew there was no way it could be easy for him to get away to visit his son before curfew.
Steve was quiet as he towelled off and got dressed, contemplating if he should ask Bucky the question that had been rolling around in his mind ever since he'd found the paper sack outside his door.
Thor had also been sparring quite a bit with Steve, which while it wasn't exactly enough to tire him out, it had at least helped to increase his self-confidence a bit in his hand-to-hand skills, something that Tony knew had been lacking ever since the Miami bunker battle.
"Hey, did anyone ever tell you that you look a lot like Captain America?" the young man asked, who barely looked old enough to drive, much less be a police officer. He gasped as he stepped back, looking between Steve and Tony. "Oh my God, you really
"Don't think I would've minded a little warning in this case!" Gwen sniffed. "Now I'm thinking that everyone's gonna die!"
“Nah, it’s okay,” Tony says dismissively, but not before Steve sees a flash of self-loathing flare across Tony’s face.  One that he’s seen far too often for his liking.
"Yeah, Pete?" Tony answered as he tried to take a deep breath, his throat and lungs already burning from the stale, dusty air of the planet.
"And this will save him, right?" Steve asked. "Peter will be able to have his surgery once we do this?"
"Exactly." Tony's lower lip quivered as he recalled Peter lying in that hospital bed as still as a corpse, completely unresponsive. It had been one of the worst things he had ever experienced with Peter, second only to when he stopped breathing out in the middle of the Afghanistan desert.
"All right, we'll work on that when we can," Sam said from the opposite side of the prison. "Just keep Steve secure in the meantime, yeah?"
"I will." Peter sat back against his pillows as Ms Sharon exited his room, her word choice hitting him about three seconds after she'd closed the door.
"That was our theory as well, Steve," said Hill. She drew a large circle around the half-destroyed building next to the hospital, one labelled Institute for Infectious Diseases. "We believe that this institute was in the process of running tests on a new type of biological, something that could potentially be very attractive to terrorists."
"I suppose that's one way to look at it," answered Steve. "I was just glad to finally get the chance to serve my country."
"Aww, Buck! I'm so happy for you!" Steve exclaimed as he clapped Bucky on the shoulder. "That's wonderful!"
"Yes, well, we prefer not to use that particular term around here," Hammer said, glancing rather nervously at the girl. He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "You know, since it kinda has a negative connotation to it." Then he clapped his hands again, causing both Peter and the girl to jump. "But anyway, I'm not here to argue semantics with a smart-ass teenager, of all people. What I'm here for is to—"
Or at least not an answer that didn't sound childish or petulant, and the last thing that Steve wanted was to appear childish or petulant in front of Colonel Phillips. Not when there was a very high chance for him to become one of the first Langarans to ever fly in space.
“Hello?” he tries to say, his throat too dry and too frozen to even force the sound past his lips.  He jerks again, his heart hammering against his ribcage as he hears Tony let out a soft moan from his spot on Steve’s chest.
"This is helping," Tony said, muffled against Steve's chest. "Even if you smell like you've been punching the hell outta canvas bags for the last three hours." He lifted his head, looking up at Steve with his lips twitching playfully. "And now you've gotten me all sweaty too."
“Goddamnit,” Tony muttered as the simulated sparks faded away.  He’d already checked the missile’s fuel line, the outer hull construction, and the control chip for the separation sequence and found nothing amiss, which meant that the problem either had to be inside the missile design itself, or—
And if he did lose the election, well… Peter didn't like thinking about what could happen. Dad and Papa had adamantly refused to publicly endorse any politicians, not wanting to give anyone the impression that the Avengers could be politically swayed. It was absolutely the right choice, but Peter still worried that it was going to come back and bite them at some point. Peter had had enough experience watching his father deal with various government agencies and committees to know that they always came with preformed or hidden agendas, none of which were ever beneficial to their family or to Stark Industries.
"He's gonna be fine," Steve said firmly. Grunting, he tucked Tony to his chest and got to his feet, frantically glancing around for T'Challa. They had learned on their very first trip to Wakanda that their medicine was very advanced, so if he could just get Tony inside somewhere, then—then—
"I definitely will," said Steve. "Dr Banner plans to tackle the cellular towers once he and Colonel Rhodes are done with their work on the power grid."
“Well, you’d sure be a damn sorry one if you were,” Tony says softly.  “No offence, honey, but you're not looking too good.”
Shame washed through Steve like a flood as he glanced over Tony's shoulder, avoiding his eyes. All of his skin prickled like he'd been sunburned, but he hadn't thought it was all that bad until he saw Tony's reaction.
But then again, Barnes, or rather, the Winter Soldier, not only killed Tony's parents in cold blood, but almost managed to kill Steve twice
"Like fire," Wanda said, sniffing. "Like my very blood had turned into molten lava." She shot him a quizzical look. "You know of this?"
"Yeah, okay, you know what? I don't really care about who's jealous of who," snapped Dad. "All I care about is when Thor's coming back."
"Just humour me, okay, J?" Tony said, suppressing an eyeroll. "Just trying to make extra sure no one can get access to any of my stuff."
Because he wasn’t in the middle of the Sokovian war zone, surrounded by enemy fire and collapsing buildings.  He was inside his own bookstore.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve said, his slightly husky voice sending a burst of heat across Tony’s chest.  “How’s your day going?”
"It's just writing, Dad, something I do all the time anyway," Peter answered. "It's not like I'm doing much of anything else."
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said carefully, as if he could sense Tony's skyrocketing anxiety level. He had already been kicked off the computers by Bruce once they realised that having two people attempting to examine the data was causing it to degrade that much faster, likely one of many safeguards built into the encryption system. Unfortunately it meant that he didn't really have anything to do at the moment, and, like Steve, it was only making him even more anxious.
"Should be?" Papa said, hissing in pain when his left toe dragged across the floor. "You mean they're not here yet?"
Which, all things considered, Tony couldn't really argue against. He had noticed Peter getting more and more down about the fact that Gwen was leaving soon, and knew he was trying to maximise the time he got to spend with her before she left. He and Steve had even discussed the possibility of making a trip out to London over the summer so Peter could visit her, but seeing as how they didn't have a house or apartment out there, Tony was uneasy about it. He just didn't feel comfortable having Peter anywhere that he couldn't adequately secure, and since he highly doubted that the British government would allow him to place some of his defence drones on top of one of their hotels, then the risk just wasn't worth it.
When Tony breaks them out of the Ten Rings stronghold, the lion is not their friend – not exactly, but he’s not about to eat them. Blu holds off their attackers as Tony, in his suit of armor, cradles a dying Yinsen in his arms and promises to make a better life. Every fiber of his being wants to linger, to pay homage to this man in his arms, but life is cruel and savages even the smallest moments. He lays Yinsen down and looks to the passageway. Blu growls and shakes his mighty mane. It’s unnaturally blonde. Tony never noticed in the dark of the cell. Again, the lion grumbles and then turns with a roar at the oncoming attackers. In the far too clunky armor, Tony swings around and heads toward the exit. He hears shrieks behind him and hopes that the beast takes the captors down. They deserve what they get from the abused animal.
The lion rumbles and stands up, yawning and then simply walks away. Probably off to hunt – though Tony knows female lions are the hunters, lone male lions have to hunt for themselves. He should take it as a compliment that Blu doesn’t consider him his mate.
Steve doubled back, trying to find his team mates. He couldn’t spot them, but with the soul bonds to lead him, he followed their trail to the fork. Clint and Sam had Nat (who was sitting and looking a little bit more than pissed) covered. Steve joined them at the small island at the fork of the creek. He waded through the ankle deep water and took up position.
“It’s rifer. But who says rifer? Still with more rife, sounds better.” Tony mumbles and then peeks out the window again as he paces the room. “We need that backpack.”
Clint scoffs. “I wish. It’s more complicated. We can’t work because of what happened to us. He’s the only one who – let’s just say he’s the only one to go through it all unscathed. The rest of us – not so much.” He taps his hearing aids. “This is the least of my problems.”
Waking up to have a vulture plucking at his eyes was not something he wanted, and he avoided it at all costs. That reason alone helped him accept the coven and their small conclave. The vampires in his coven were much older than him. Natasha was the designated head. All covens were led by a woman vampire. He didn’t know why, and he didn’t ask. Thor was older than Natasha as was Loki who happened to be a trouble maker. Natasha had recently banished Loki. Tony wasn’t sure of his transgression, but banishment usually meant an underground conclave with no food but enough to sustain him. His body would go into stasis for years until she released him.
With the table positioned in the middle of the main room, the visuals around it play with the ocean waves and the rocky shore. It’s calming and soothing. Tony looks around and says, “JARVIS pulled up my old residence. I used to live here a long time ago.”
“No, I’m not. This kind of thing I live and breathe. Let me tell you there’s no one else that can put on a show like me,” Tony says.
“Pepper, Pepper and her need to enrich my life with art other than Iron Man posters,” Tony mutters and Clint mumbles something under his breath. “What’s that?”
get away.” He placed his hand on his chest. “When she had this gorgeous hunk of sweet chocolate? Ah, she was the one who let me get away.”
Never in his life had he experienced that hollowed out ache. Was it the chasm of space that forced this emptiness to the fore? As a child he experienced loneliness, a kind of social isolation because of his brilliance and his wealth. He used it to his advantage. This ache, this yearning seeded differently inside of him. It gave him a want, as if his body and mind existed in a state of deprivation. It reminded him of being abducted and afraid in Afghanistan all those years ago. As if freedom from it was only a moment away, but it was fleeting and horrible to hope for. He needed a drink. He needed to clear his head of the maudlin mood and get back to himself again.
“Then what?” Steve asks because he just wants to forget, to sleep, to walk backward through time and tease apart the threads of his life that tangled up into knots and weave them right again.
If you've ever read my story Upon Waking, I had this crazy idea that I would be able to write a sequel. I tried several times. And failed several times. This is one of those times....
He hesitates but then agrees. He knows people, he knows how to work the room. This though, this is strange and real. “Sure.”
Jarvis plates the wraps and adds French Fries which are obviously not Moroccan but Tony loves fries and eats them whenever he can.  Jarvis has a tendency to give in to some of Tony’s lesser bad habits. “And now, sir, I will retire for bit. Ana needs to go to a doctor’s appointment, and I would like to take her.”
There are dreams and then there is reality. Reality damages hopes and wishes, but not this time. Reality explodes away, leaving in its wake the truth. Steve shudders under Tony’s caress, under his wide and callused hands. Tony hikes up Steve’s shirt and abrades his hands over the tender peak of his nipples. He groans and closes his eyes arching into Tony’s touch. Every touch, light or heavy, sends Steve into a fit of undisguised pleasure. Once he discards Steve’s shirt, Tony plays with each nipple with his tongue, teasing it, flinging it along with little nips. Goosebumps rise over Steve’s skin as he touches, strokes, and pets.
Before Steve realized that Bruce had left, he’d come back with a steaming mug of tea and offered it to him. Steve thanked Bruce and accepted it. Bruce gestured to the comfy looking chairs placed in a U - all facing the brilliant city beyond the windows. Grateful, Steve settled into a chair and Bruce sat across from him. It was off putting how they were strangers yet bonded together. Awkward wasn’t exactly the word for it. Creepy felt like a better descriptor.
Sirens shrieked behind them as he squinted against his funneling vision. He cursed the daylight. If it hadn’t been sunny out, Tony would be able to drive. Where the hell was Thor? From the vehicles following them a barrage of gunfire peppered the car. Glass shattered. “Stay down! Stay down!” Steve screamed as a bullet nicked his shoulder.
Steve is surprised and laughs as he shakes his head. “Buck is like a brother to me. We've been together since our parents died. Roaming the streets of New York trying to stay off a cop’s beat, and away from the lash of the nun’s whip.”
Tony chuckles and braces a hand on the rump of his horse, scanning the lost horizon of Avenge. “There's no one out here, Sheriff. I would like it if you did let me get to my knees-.”
“Other than I wish it was January?” Tony says as he steps up to the windows of his bedroom. The city lies before him like a sleeping steel monster. As a child he thought of it as some mythical beast, a living breathing creature ready to rise up from the waters of the Hudson and roar its disapproval of humans. He smiles. “If it was January, I’d use the glasses one last time to see the Northern Lights.”
“If it’s Bucky, truly Bucky and not the Winter Soldier, he’s not there for any of those options,” Steve said and picked up the dish towel to dry his hands. “He’s there to help.”
The skin over the gland tears a little and Tony knows it will scar. He adjusts his position so that he can angle into the omega deeply. He pounds into him, edging closer and closer to the rage of knotting. He loves the knot, wants to see the omega’s mouth wrapped around his knot, choking on his knot. It takes him then until he’s swollen and locked into place. He collapses back, still connected, but trembling as he sits on the bed. The omega has his face turned into the blanket. His hands are on the bed frame, clutching it. For a moment a crest of sympathy runs through Tony and he lays a hand upon the man’s tortured cock. Even in the cage it seeps. Fine drips of come leak out of it. Tony’s not a monster; at some point he’ll let the man come. It will be a feast between them. Something they will both enjoy – once they are well and truly bonded.
“No!” the young woman screamed and then her brother whizzed toward Tony in a blur of white and blue. He knocked Tony off balance as Bucky aimed the rifle not at the Hydra guards pursuing them, but at Tony’s head.
“No,” Steve interrupts the silent communication. “I can do it. I just wanted to make sure that wasn’t an issue. I’m not in need of a lawyer or anything.” He picks up the pen again and signs the form. Pepper offers him the tablet and he does the same on the tablet document after checking to ensure it’s the same one. It’s both insulting and reassuring that he’s so exacting.
Luke pats Steve on the back. “I think we understand one another. So, I’m gonna call you Tones. Does that work for you?”
Both Pepper and Rhodey glance down at their plates, eyes everywhere  else but focused on Steve and Tony. Carol raises an eyebrow at Tony. “Tones, I think he can do what he wants on his own time.”
“Don’t worry. It won’t go to waste. We recycle everything on the ship,” Tony says, and he selects what looks like an omelet and some meat that might be bacon.
“I’m only doing this for your own good,” Bucky said, and he pulled back his left metallic arm. Steve heard the whirl of the gears and the powering up of the fist. He wouldn’t be able to block it; he barely stood a chance to stay on his feet as it was.
They took it at face value. Ross clapped him on the arm. “We’ll regroup at 1500. Talk to the troops. Give them the lay of the land.”
He doesn’t see her face, her expression, but hears the sharp inhale. “No, Tony, you don’t know what you-.”
Steve reached out and Tony batted him away, but he didn’t let that stop him. He grabbed at Tony, not letting him go. He braced his hands on Tony’s shoulders. His own eyes watered and tears streamed down his cheeks. “You have to know, Tony. I know you. I know you get it that he was a prisoner of Hydra, made to do those things.”
“I’m you, Daddy!” Tony had said. The captain’s hat he’d stolen from Howard’s closet. It blocked part of his view as it slipped down his face and covered his eyes. He was only five years old and his father defined the moon and the stars for Tony. “Going to rescue Captain America!” He smiled and then took out a toy horn to toot it.
The cold pit grows in Tony’s belly and he turns to the table, determined, angry and bent on a new resolution.
to stop, but there were no words. He had no power on the physical plane at all. His eyeless, faceless self moved over a battered Steve, hunting for something, the fangs prominent in its mouth. Blood oozed from Steve’s many wounds. It laid on top of Steve for a moment as if in need of rest. Steve remained still as the grave. Tony prayed and wished it would stop. Told himself not to do this. In this state would his physical body completely drain Steve? Would he kill Steve and not even know he was doing it?
Steve kisses him lightly on the cheek, then gently pulls out. His comes slides down Tony’s leg. Tony always likes to be a little messy. Steve turns him around so they can see one another. They kiss a tender touch of the lips and then Steve pulls back and asks, “Just what the hell is opsimath and is that something I should know for my stats final?”
“Yeah, same here. I drank. A lot. Was drunk for months, I think. A lot of it is just a smear of unrecorded time in my head. When I first went blind, I nearly went insane trying to figure out the passage of time. Drinking made me not care,” Tony says. “Rhodey and Happy intervened. I didn’t know Pepper at the time. I was lucky. They saved my life.”
“No, she wasn’t. But,” Steve said and stopped. What was his point? “Today, you don’t see things like this as an ailment. Back then? Well, we did.” He settled back onto the chair. He let his body go lax, he needed to stop tensing up. “But my mom.” He shook his head. “She was full of surprises. She invited the bachelor gentlemen over for dinner. The ones that lived across the hallway. She did things like that. She knew more than I gave her credit for.”
“I’ve seen you climb in our training sessions.” He shoves his backpack into Tony’s arms. “Get with it. We have to hustle.”
The use of his name again startles him. “Who do you miss?” The memory of Steven murmuring in his sleep comes back to Tony. “Who do you cry for? I know you do. I’ve heard you.”  The love must haunt him.
“Come on. Get up.” Tony wrapped Steve’s arm around his shoulder and then heaved him up to his feet. Steve wanted to struggle away, made a half-hearted attempt, but the lack of oxygen throbbed through him and his vision went dark for a second before resolving again.
“Tony? Why?” Steve asked and there was an undercurrent, like a growl, from Bucky. Steve eyed him but then didn’t ask any questions about it.
He bowed his head. “I’m not so certain it’s as great a resource as we thought. It feels like an invasion sometimes.” He wondered if that also played into the fact that Tony never appeared at the hospital. The distance stretched the bond between them and now the rest of the pack teetered. The truth hurt. The soul pack wasn’t going away any time soon. He conceded Sam was right; he needed to do something about it.
“It’s also very narrow minded. Ultron’s literally restricting his own options,” Steve says and then shifts. His body aches and he forces his brain to accept that this virtual reality – is just that – not real. Not his physical reality. He’s fine in the real world. It doesn’t work.
Clearing his mind, he goes into the bedroom and settles in the single wooden chair. He pulls out a small book and flips it open. Steve is left with his thoughts; a dangerous place to wade these days as he sits with the forgotten book on his lap. He watches as his friend writhes on the cot, tormented by dreams and the agony of pain. His wound isn’t closing properly and, from what Bruce reported, it looks worse by the hour. Steve doesn’t have a choice, they need to get Thor’s brother, Loki, back to town and find out if he can help with his knowledge of medicines, especially since it was probably a concoction of his poisons that did this to Bucky in the first place.
The idea of Hydra being involved in the United States government sent a shiver down his spine. Instead of having a precious bundle of Captain America in his arms, he carried the shield. He landed amidst the bustle of media and medical personnel clustered at the entrance of the hospital. As he left the armor to the side of the doorway and told it to stand guard, Tony picked up the shield and walked into the hospital. There were reporters swarming the lobby, almost clogging the entranceway to the emergency waiting room. Someone had to do something. It was the least he could do – plus it didn’t hurt that as soon as he walked into the place, the reporters erupted and gathered around him.
Stunned, Steve stands in his corner not seeing anything or hearing anything for the rest of the time. It’s hours of hiding away, trying to make himself as inconspicuous as possible. Being noticed by anyone now means they know, everyone knows in Steve’s head. Stane wouldn’t keep it a secret. Anytime Steve sees Stane speaking with other guests (Hammer, Odin, Erskine) he sure the rumor spreads like wildfire. He bites back the pain and tells himself that he’s not ashamed of who he is, what he does. Yet when Doctor Erskine weaves his way through the crowd to speak to him, Steve ducks away.
Steve glanced over at Tony who stayed back from the bed. He waved for Tony to join them. When he did, Steve introduced him. “Sam, this is my mate, Tony.”
Steve raised an eyebrow and seemed more amused than insulted. “Really? You won’t allow it? Come on.”
Natasha learned how to ignore emotional plea bargaining long again. “Then he knows the risks. We continue.” It’s up to her. The rest of the team lean on her to lead them through to the other side of this insanity. She plans to do just that. If there’s one thing she’s come to understand it would be that life barrages you not with things you can handle, but things you most definitely cannot. How you rise up to greet them doesn’t make you a hero, but a survivor.
It took weeks for him to become fully conscious again. He suspected someone nursed him back to health. He’s not sure who it was – whether it was one of the cursed humans or one of the Legion. He wished to die then, and sometimes he still does.
Arrows whiz by and flames spark from the Red Knight’s palms. The dark beasts around him crow and growl at the Silver Knight. Almost upon him, the arrows dart like a hailstorm. He’s very nearly to the gap. But he won’t make it – he knows that now. He will not accept this cursed fate. His beast seems to read his mind and rears up, knocking him from his saddle. He grasps to hold on, but the beast is too wicked to stay. It escapes with its bearish teeth in a snarl.
“Stop, before you hurt yourself,” Tony says and opens up his shirt to look at the arc reactor. “Well, look at that, it actually works.” From what he can tell, Steve did a bang up job installing it. The flesh around the device looks pink but not inflamed, and the putrid wounds are gone, clean scars replace them.
“It could and we don’t want to have the Ornari here.” A moebius strip is not the way to go, it would turn the events inside out and lead to someone missing their grandmother or some shit. Logan was right this whole thing gives him a headache.  “That’s one thing to consider. The Ornari are not in both realities, right?”
Tony doesn’t say he’s incapable of moving at the moment. Steve doesn’t need to know that right now. Being blind isn’t the worst of it. It’s the headaches and the pain. He can deal with blindness (no, no he can’t). What he fails at is handling the pain. His medical staff, including Doctor Strange, figures that the implant exacerbates the lasting effects of the TBI and if he would have it removed, then he would be nearly free of the pain. But that would mean living a life without sight. How can an engineer do that? How can he fucking give up his sight? He did that for the first few years until he started to wear a rudimentary transmitter (it looked like an earbud) and carried Dummy around. Dummy worked, but not like the glasses do. The glasses were a huge leap forward. Combining the technology of electronic photography, virtual reality, and bionanomaterials brought Tony closer to real sight. He knows it’s not the real thing, he knows part of what he picks up with the implant is literally configured by the nano-core in the glasses. Sometimes the backgrounds of offices or open spaces fuzz out and turn into what Tony can only describe as CGI of a video game. Most of the time it works – it works well enough for up close and personal. He can’t drive, but he can interact with people. He can still design and discover. He can do his damned job. He can be Tony Stark.
His bike was damaged, and he had little choice. He would have to make a break for it. Swim the Potomac and hope he got away. But then another sound alerted him of an incoming danger. An engine – rotors –of a helicopter. He looked up to the sky. Hovering over the bridge with the rope ladder dangling was a Stark helicopter. He spotted his second in command at the V-Corps, Clint, piloting and awaiting him at the controls. Steve latched onto the rope ladder and the helicopter took off into the sky.  Only seconds later, another fighter zeroed in on them and Steve started the frantic ascent to get out of harm’s way as bullets targeted him. As he made it into the helicopter cockpit, a stray bullet hit his boot. He hissed at the pain but rolled into the copter. Clint angled the controls zipping up and around the more cumbersome jet. He flew directly toward DC, not to the more open space of Virginia. Steve pulled up the rope and got into the co-pilot seat, ripping off his helmet and putting on the headset.
Steve frowns but agrees. “Sure. We can check it out. Let’s go.” He puts down the pencil and waits – Tony takes this as his cue to lead the way.
“Don’t think I can wait that long. My fingers are purple.” His usual deft hands are clumsy and bungling as he works to light the burner.
“Doesn’t look good, boss. Seems Jo-Jo’s been too busy with her integrations.” That’s Penny – he did not call on Penny to answer.
“Hey, hon?  You feel like taking a bath?” Tony asked as he watched Steve carefully hang up his uniform.  “We’ve still got almost two hours before we can pick up Pete, so—”
"I'm gonna take such good care of you tonight, sweetheart," Steve whispered as he went to work on Tony's shirt buttons. "Let me show you how much I love you."
"And if Thanos does indeed make his way to Earth, then this stone may be the best chance that we have against him," said Dr Strange.
mistakes he made with Brock isn’t going to change the fact that he made them, and will likely be paying for them—both literally and emotionally—for the rest of his life.
"Yeah, yeah, I know you didn't," said Tony. He lifted his head, his lips twitching into a soft smile as he studied Steve's face. "Your cute-as-hell worry wrinkle just got to be too much for you to handle, hmm?"
“Here we are,” he murmured as they reached the door.  Still grasping Tony’s hand, Steve unlocked it and held it open so Tony could step inside, turning to him as soon as it closed.
Tony's lips twitched in excitement as he got to his feet, drawing the hologram further away from the counter and enlarging it.
Steve frowned, eyeing the top floor of the building as he and Bucky trotted into the parking lot. None of the team members had gas masks available, which he had a feeling he was going to hear about once he got home.
"I'm much better now," Steve said, his warm breath on Tony's neck causing him to shiver. They had finally celebrated their anniversary the night before, including the recreation of their wedding night that Steve—and Tony—had so badly wanted, and it had been glorious. Even three years after the fact, Tony still couldn't believe that he'd been so lucky as to marry someone as incredible as Steve, and the amount of love and attention that Steve had showered him with the night before, well… it was pretty much indescribable.
"Well, he should really be more careful," Papa grumbled. "I doubt the school officials would condone driving like that in their parking lot."
"It very well could," replied Thor. "And if that is the case, then it will also be imperative that we somehow remove at least one of the stones from Midgard. It is far too dangerous to have so many in such close proximity."
"Holy shit, there's another one!" cried Major Lorne barely a second later. "Rogers, it's right on you!"
"I believe it would be best to be frank, Captain," T'Challa stated. He held his hand towards the inside of the trailer. "Please, why don't we all sit down and discuss this."
"Your oxygen saturation is already below ninety percent, your lungs are soaking wet, and both your heart and your respiratory rates are elevated," Ms Sharon stated. "Sweetie, I'm afraid you're not gonna last too much longer unless you stop what you're doing now and get some rest."
“Pete!  JARVIS says the pizza’s gonna be here in about five minutes!” Dad suddenly yelled from the kitchen.
"Ah, thanks for the lightning show!" Rhodey called as he flew overhead, grenades launching from the back of his armour in two-second intervals. "Just… you might wanna give me a warning next time, hmm? That blast nearly knocked out my guidance system."
“Indeed he did, sir,” answered JARVIS.  “Files included are personnel, missions, and documents suspected to have ties to the former Nazi organisation, HYDRA.”
His answer had obviously surprised Davis, who glared off to the side in the direction of an aide who was visibly shrinking in his chair. Apparently someone hadn't done their research properly.
who'd just happened to look out their window while he was stuck sliding behind the runaway weapons van and bouncing off trash cans, 'cause, why the hell
“Ah, yep,” Dad said.  “Hour and fifteen tops, all right?  You’ve got homework you can be working on, yeah?”
"It is," agreed Peter. He pushed open the double doors to find Uncle James' car parked nearby, with Uncle James and Uncle Bucky sitting inside.
The kind that used to seep through the thin walls of his ma's house during the bitter Brooklyn winters, burrowing through multiple layers of clothing to settle deep into his bones. The kind that made his shoulders turn in and his teeth clench.
He was so deep in his own thoughts as he swung the backpack over his shoulder and hurried out of the locker room that he didn't even see Gwen waiting for him outside the door until he had barrelled right into her.
They stayed there, just clinging to each other in the middle of the bed for several minutes, until Steve carefully pulled out of Tony and laid him down, pressing a soft kiss to his lips before getting up to fetch a washcloth from the tiny bathroom. His face was etched in adoration mixed with worry as he carefully cleaned Tony's body, gathering him into his arms under the blankets once he was done. The record player was still on, but since it needed to be wound up about every hour or so, Tony figured it would be turning off soon.
The heavy pause that followed was finally broken by the sound of wood scraping against wood as Mrs Stacy scooted back her chair.
Especially since the humming noise has now increased both in pitch and volume, and seems to be coming from inside the building.
"So, you're not gonna forget what I said as soon as you get home now, right?" Gwen asked as they sat down on her front steps. She tugged on their clasped hands, drawing Peter's attention away from his study of the flickering light patterns on the distant buildings. "Peter?"
"Ah, yeah," Steve said, flustered as he checked his timepiece. It was already nearly 1900 hours, more than an hour after he had planned to be back. "Actually, I was just leaving."
"You're not fooling anyone with the whole innocent routine, honey," he said. "Or at least not anymore."
Because as he walked past the still-muted television, where President Cole was standing on his stage with his hands held high, basking in the applause from his adoring fans, Steve couldn't help but think of another leader who once stood on stages and basked in the applause of his thousands and eventually millions of followers. A leader who had also preached about nationalism and national pride, and who had promised to end domestic terrorism.
“This is all I could find,” he says as he hands Steve one of the bottles.  “I’m guessing they’re leftovers from whenever Strucker and his goons tested this place out.”
"Thanks, Ned," Peter said, inwardly kicking himself. He had completely forgotten that Ned was going to be hanging around them while Betty was busy overseeing the festivities.
"Yeah. I bet it didn't." Peter scratched at his nose, fighting against the strong urge to yawn. Apparently even holding a conversation was exhausting him now.
To Peter's surprise, he found Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat waiting for him in the parking lot instead of his dads, his stomach dropping at the grim looks on their faces.
And it hadn't taken him too long to figure out why. Technically, before the semi-enhanced villains started showing up, the Avengers hadn't ever lost a battle. They had won the Battle of New York against the invading Chitauri, thanks in large part to Tony's self-sacrificing flight with the nuclear rocket through the open space portal. They had also won the Battle of the Triskelion and the battle down in the Miami bunker against Stane and Killian, but Steve couldn't honestly say that the team had actually won any of their fights since then. At best, they had only achieved stalemates.
"Cindy told me she qualified for Academic Decathlon too," added Ned. "So I guess we'll be seeing her after school."
But as much as Steve loves to reminisce about that incredible time, he can’t allow himself to do it for too long.  Because ultimately, any trip down that memory lane leads to him remembering that that was also the year he started dating Brock, and… well…
"Miss your dad," Gwen finished with a nod. "Yes, I know. And your head's not stupid, by the way. If it was, then I'd be first in our class instead of you."
"How's he doing?" Tony blurted out, tipping into Steve as soon as the words left his mouth. "My boy, how's—how's—?"
"Huh?" Scott said, his shoulders dropping less than a second later. "Oh, geez, I am so sorry. You probably think that I'm just… um… yeah. Yeah, I'd love to come inside. That'd be—that'd be great. Thanks."
“Now, Captain,” he said, shaking his head as though he were admonishing a struggling student.  “I am sure you are aware of how impolite it is to not acknowledge someone who is speaking to you?  Surely your dear mother taught you better manners than that?”
“I’ll be back in the morning, Ashes,” Steve said as he carefully set her down, petting her back as she dove into her food.  “You keep a good watch over the place for me, okay?”
"Well… no, not from outside the team," said Peter. He'd never actually thought of it like that. "I guess my papa's the oversight."
"JARVIS, copy everything that you see in my HUD right now and send it to Pepper," Tony ordered, zooming in first on Peter's bruised and bleeding cheeks, then scanning across Steve's battered body as best as he could through the crowd of Avengers, police, and FBI agents. "Please also ask her if she wouldn't mind getting some preliminary media statements ready, but only with people she trusts. I wanna make sure the entire world knows what those assholes were doing here."
"Peter's other dad is Captain America!" Ned exclaimed. "And he lives in Avengers' Tower, with all the Avengers!"
"Hell no, he couldn't!" snapped Peter. "But even without Captain America, Papa would still be a good person. Captain America isn't only who he is, just like Iron Man's not only who Dad is, and I really wish the news people could remember that! My dads are real people, just like they are."
One thing that Steve does know, unequivocally, is that he was not at all prepared for Peter Stark to demonstrate that he’s the most natural untapped talent Steve’s ever seen in a potential swimmer.  He wasn’t exaggerating when he told Peter that his butterfly stroke was pretty much flawless, and the thought of getting to mould all of that talent into someone who could easily become the next Melvin Stewart is almost as exciting to Steve as when he realised he might someday become the next Rowdy Gaines.  By the time Peter’s tryout was done, Steve was literally prepared to get down on his knees and beg to be his coach if for some reason either he or his father decided that Steve wasn’t worthy or something.
"Colonel Phillips will be the de facto leader of Langara for a total of three weeks, during which time arrangements for a national free election will take place," said James. "Both myself and a few other ranking Langaran officers will be tasked with supporting him through this transition, as well as with preparing court martial proceedings for General O'Brien and his supporters."
"Okay, that all sucks and all," said James. "But from how you're telling this story, you were still able to beat it."
"Well, I'd beg to differ, which is probably not something you're ever gonna want to actually see, so… I'd recommend not arguing with me about your level of perfection and just accept the fact that you are. For everyone's sake."
"Yeah, thanks, big guy," said Tony. "And I should have some time tomorrow afternoon to give you a bit of a break, I know it's been awhile since you've had one."
"So you chose my grandpa," Peter said, not without a hint of anger. "But you know that he didn't do anything, right? Someone framed him. Someone else blamed him for what they did because they were a
"And I can't wait to see him for myself," Steve said. He pressed a hard kiss to Tony's forehead, brushing another tear from his cheek. "I'm going to be looking at this picture the entire time that I'm gone, okay? At the two people who I love more than anything else."
“So, do you think those charges are really gonna hold against that asshole?” Sam asked Fury.  He had his arm tightly around his fiancé’s waist, as Bucky looked like he was either ready to punch something or burst into tears.  “‘Cause if we just went through all of this shit for nothing, then—”
But Ned continued on as if he hadn't heard him. "—so I was just thinking, you have Finley in your room with you, right? So, if you could figure out how this guy managed to do it, you could turn him into a fish night light."
"Ah, a couple days ago?" replied Bucky. "At the bar? You weren't there, you were out 'clearing your head' or whatever again, which is why we were all sitting around talking about you."
And he could only imagine how many pictures and videos they had posted on all the social media sites.
"Yeah, they sure seem to be," said Steve. "Is that why you love working with them so much? 'Cause they're resilient?"
"Huh? Oh, yeah. Ms Sharon trimmed it for me," Peter said as Steve gently ruffled his hair. "Hey, Steve!"
Peter held up his hand, as if he could halt Dad’s dumb excuses right there from the hallway.  It was useless, and he knew it.  But the stubborn Stark in him couldn't help but try anyway.
And also Peter, as it seemed word had already gotten out that an eleven-year-old boy—whose twelfth birthday just happened to be in a couple of days—was one of the main masterminds behind the brand-new planetary energy system.
"Are you sure?" he said again, grimacing as he realised he sounded like a scratched record. "That's… well… I mean… that's a pretty big thing, so—"
"I'm ready, hon," he said instead, giving Steve what he hoped was an encouraging nod. "Let's get this party started."
“You have a scheduled conference call with the Stark Industries Board of Directors in exactly sixteen minutes and twelve seconds,” answered JARVIS.  “You then have a meeting scheduled with Miss Potts for 2pm, and a parent-teacher conference for Peter at school at 3:30pm.  Oh, and the dry-cleaner is reporting that your suits are ready for pickup.”
"Eh, I'm not too worried about that," said Dad. "Long as this guy comes home in one piece then I'll be okay." He brushed the hair from Peter's forehead. "Then we'll get you taken care of and we can all go home, hmm? Doesn't that sound good?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Bucky said with wide eyes. "Just hold on a minute. I thought you had another date with him just last night?"
Tony nodded, swallowing past the lump in his throat and attempting to smile at his husband, even as he knew Steve would be able to see right through it.
"Your Highness," he said, offering the king a short bow. "If you don't mind, there's something I need to discuss with you."
“Oh, good grief nothing,” said Tony.  “If the cat’s been fed, then let’s get out of here before the roads get too messy.”
Tony gasped as he brought Steve's left palm to his chest, splaying it across the kaleidoscope of scars covering his heart. "It's okay, baby. I'm right here."
"Oh, really? Things are really that bad, hmm?" Tony asked, his beautiful lips curling into a soft, rather cheeky smile. "So then, where are we headed after this one,
"Woohoo!" Tony yelled triumphantly as he turned to Steve, the helmet retracting from his head. "Did you see that?"
"You are not seriously thinking about—" Tony started, only to be cut off by Steve's fingers pressing against his lips.
"Okay, okay," Steve said as he squeezed Tony's hand. "But we can assume that it's someone with ties to the government, since it was a Damage Control server that had the information, can't we?"
"I know you are, sweetheart," he whispered as he brought their joined hands back down onto the table. "But I'm still not letting you leave until Shuri says it's okay. She wants to make sure that you don't have any issues with the skin grafts."
“What if we keep twisting it?” Tony asks. “I mean you know how you can twist and twist something until it breaks – what if we kept it up. Kept up the entanglement until you can’t really tell which particle is reacting and which is acting.”
Steve’s cheeks redden. “I am. I was here. Through it all. I’ve been a lion more time on this Earth than a man. I have all of his memories, experiences-.” He shuts down then, dropping down to sit as the overwhelming truths must hit him. His whole body trembles as if caught in the throws of a horrible dream. It must be like that for him, this reality he’s found himself in.
Their relationship blossomed, but that frail bloom would easily wilt if they didn’t feed it. If every bond existed as an equation, then Tony could solve them all. The equations predicted the outcomes of the bonds, he only needed to study them and comprehend their inner meanings. In the end it wasn’t just about solutions but the theory behind the equations.
“It’s beautiful. I’ve never seen an ocean – not in real life.” He peers over his shoulder at the breaking waves. JARVIS adjusts the sound so it doesn’t overwhelm, but plays like background music.
As Steve retrieves the rope from his backpack, the familiar roar of the Hulk echoes through the valley of snow. He wrestles the rope free and gives it to Tony. “Hurry.”
He should have gone directly to the kitchen to search out Steve and find out what the hell was going on, but instead he slipped into his study. It was a room in the expansive house he rarely used because he preferred his laboratory and workshop. This place reminded him of his father with its tall bookcases and lines of books. Sure, he loved books, but this room usually meant that he needed solitude, and something was wrong. Within its walls contained all of his father’s notes and secret government projects. Of course, his father and mother died long before he was transformed. Yet, he knew his father might have had his hands in something as vital and intriguing as the idea of immortality.
It’s the Alpha Steve spent his last heat within the presentation room in Wakanda after which he sliced his own gland out. “I’ll take the 5th.”
So Bruce made no sense. Hell, as far as Tony knew Bruce and Steve almost never saw one another. What kind of bond was that? Of course, Tony had no idea if they did the voodoo communication thing with their astral projections – whatever the hell that was. Now, Natasha became part of their little group and what a strange group it was. Natasha – a spy – a Russian assassin. What the hell kind of resonance did Steve Rogers have with her?
“Should be in just thirty minutes or so. I just want to finish up a little more on this and then I’ll go down.” Steve goes back to work.
Tony falls against him and he’s almost too heavy to hold in his weakened state. “Steve, don’t ask me to. I want to, god, I want to but now that you told me.” He notches his head against Steve’s neck and shoulder. The heat and the want crest and Steve slides his hand against Tony’s shorts, feels the bulge there.
He couldn’t feel the rest of the pack. Numbness grew until it became all encompassing, until it settled in his chest and developed into this nascent creature, devouring every thread of life. He shuddered. He’d lost his mother, once. Long ago.  Everyone on Earth was destined to be an orphan, to lose the one person who innately cared for them. As he cradled the empty shell of the man he loved in his arms, Tony knew that pain of saying goodbye to his mother became a distant thing. Losing Steve, losing his Beloved, ripped away the last shreds of his soul and left him wanting and angry.
Stark only catches the doctor’s elbow and guides him to the door. Peering over his shoulder at Steve, he says, “I’ll be purchasing the empty blacksmith’s shop and a place for the good doctor to set up shop as well, tomorrow. Do I come to you? Pay you the money?”
She shrugs. “What’s there to do, make a choice? I’m good at a lot of things, Sheriff. But love isn’t one of them. Love is for children.”
Tony entered Steve’s room. It felt too small, tight, constricted. Maybe all the people gathered around his bed as if it was a death bed waiting for the end caused Tony to think about it that way. He shrugged his shoulders and wove his way to the bed, everyone parted for him. Bucky followed. Natasha shadowed him. Between the two, Tony perceived something frail, a broken thing they tried to mend yet may never be able. Bruce eased away from Natasha. She’d offered him strength when he needed it, but then had shifted over to Bucky.
