He murmured a soft good night to Tessa when she left, but kept his eyes closed as he drank the second cup of tea.  He could hear Dean moving around the room and thought he was probably getting ready to join him for bed.  Cas finished the mug and opened his eyes.
Benny had met his mate Andrea when her father had come to buy a horse from Cas. They mated within weeks and had two pups together.  Cas had added on to the cabin Benny and Victor had lived in so the family could stay there.
“You look gorgeous, Cas.  And besides, your hair looks like you just rolled out of bed.  Sexy,” he told him with a wink.  Cas chuckled and Dean released his hold.  “Though, it might be the mirror,” he suggested as he patted Cas on the ass.
Dean woke up to the smell of coffee and the clank of pans on the stove.  He stretched and smiled, feeling happy and safe, feeling like he was home.  It had been a stressful few months, to say the least, but he felt like he was handling things much better.  He was feeling better and the pining sickness was lessening as he had his pup and school to concentrate on.  Thanksgiving was in a few days and he was going to eat a slice of every different pie that was available to him.  He knew that Ellen would make her apple and pecan pies and Dean was planning on making cherry and pumpkin.  There would be no shortage of pie.
is a look: dishevelled hair, lust blown eyes, lips pink and swollen. He sits down next to Dean, gesturing to his shirt. “Is this okay?” he asks. Dean nods and helps Cas pull the t-shirt over his head. It’s not often Cas has seen Dean without a shirt. The man slept in shirts and wore three layers on a warm day, so the opportunity never exactly presented itself. The only time he’d properly gotten a look was when he rebuit Dean’s body the day he pulled him from hell.
He had led a small group of fellow knights and soldiers to find the latest victims of the past mud slides. A few pieces of equipment and splintered shields was all they could find. The lack of bodies, both people and their horses, was oddly normal and never questioned. They were just...gone.
Rolling his shoulders as he walked, Castiel let out a tense sigh. He could rest for a while, he would have to. Being back at court added a new list of priorities he would try to fit into the many he already had. After two flights of steps and turning a corner, he could see his room’s door, the second to last door on the right.
Dean smiled.  “I want to do it,” he told Cas.  “I’ll ask for help when I need it.  Charlie would help me.”
The doctor stepped out of the room with the nurse that had accompanied him.  Dean wasn’t sure what he was doing, but he quickly came back with an additional nurse in tow.  Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about being treated better because there was a Novak next to him.
Of course nothing was said. For twelve years, they bit their tongues and stopped mid-sentence to not say what they both so desperately wanted to say.
Thirty million questions, a wicked hangover, and only twenty six letters meant the only thing that came out of Dean’s mouth was “Cas,” and that was that. Tripping over bedsheets and beer bottles, he scrambles to Castiel but pausing a foot away.
Castiel replies by guiding Dean’s hands to undo his shirt buttons. As they move down Castiel’s chest, he stares up at Dean, foreheads pressed together.
“Yeah, ‘m fine, I’m just…” he trails off, smiling. “C’mere.” They kiss again, softer and sweeter. Dean lifts his hands to Cas’ collar and breaks away just far enough to ask permission. “May I?”
“What’s so funny?” Cas deadpans, woefully unaware of the hilarity of the situation, and Dean nearly spits as he bursts out laughing again. Cas simply stares at him quizzically.
Ducking into the car, Dean closes the door and relaxes back into the driver’s seat. “So, uh… want to try again? Maybe not psychologically scar her this time?” he jokes, laughing once again.
Dean takes that as the ‘okay, go,’ and gets to work. He mouths at the fabric, teeth grazing down the enclosed length, trying his best not to laugh when Castiel moans. His hands slip up to Cas’ ass, giving a firm squeeze before tucking his fingers under the waistband and pulling them down until Castiel, angel of the (former) lord is ass naked in front of him. Cas’ cock springs upward, finally free from confinement, and Dean gulps because he’s ten seconds away from his first blowjob and he’ll be the first to admit, he’s a little scared. He returns to Cas’ hip, nose brushing against soft brown curls, this time leaving small bite marks across them as he slowly drags one hand up Cas’ thigh to the base of his cock, and loosely grips it. Dean nearly loses it when Cas bucks against his hand. Using his free hand to steady himself against Cas’ thigh, he starts moving. It’s torturously slow at first and Cas is desperate for more, but Dean has the reins and won’t let him rush. He swipes a bead of precome from the slit, using it to tease just under his head. Cas’ thighs twitch, and Dean wants to laugh but that would mean taking his mouth away from Cas’ skin, and that’s the last thing he wants to do right now.
, but he won’t let himself—not yet. This isn’t about what he wants. This is about making Cas feel like the least holy angel he can possibly be. Instead, he slips his hands under Castiel’s shirt and slides it to the floor. His hands are free to feel their way across his chest and back, across the numerous scars from being an on-again-off-again human, across what he can only assume are where his wings would be, and any other area of exposed skin he can touch. Castiel shudders. Dean is addicted. He wants more, he
Castiel thinks he has officially as the humans say “died and gone to heaven,” (though heaven still isn’t a place he feels like being right now). Dean Winchester, the Michael sword, the Righteous Man, savior of pretty much every universe is sinking to his knees in front of him and all he can do is stare. It’s a beautiful sight, not even Chuck’s best sunsets holding a candle to the glory that kneels in front of him. It’s sheer willpower alone keeping Castiel upright as Dean works away his belt, undoing his pants and slipping them down his legs. Only a worn pair of black boxers sits between Dean and Cas’ increasingly hard cock.
“I’ve spent time with them as a couple, as a family. Hell, I was there when they met! You can’t fake the kind of spark that ignited when they laid eyes on each other. And I don’t have to guess what Cas said to Dean before he had to leave. I know he was telling him no matter what, they would find a way to make it work.”
“Time is a great leveler,” he advised. “I won’t say it heals all wounds, but it does give you the distance to put things in perspective.”
“You better.” Another kiss on the lips, followed by one on Dean’s forehead. Then, he left with Jack in tow.
“Hey, we’re all rooting for you, man,” Gabriel assured him, resting what he hoped was a comforting hand on Cas’ shoulder.
Cas pretended to consider the offer, knowing it would get a rise out of his boyfriend. “It might. But that would mean you would have to wake up and I don’t want that. I’ll be fine, love. Go back to sleep.”
Dean shook his head. “No, man. I totally get what you’re saying. You’re right. There’s been a wall between us and that’s on me. I know you’re ready to take the next step with Jess and I’ve been floundering because I’m not ready to make my next step. Or at least I wasn’t. The past few days I’ve started thinking about the future.
Sam shook his head. “I don’t know. But be prepared for them both to attack when we get in there. They’re usually a united front on something as big as this.”
He assured them they wouldn’t find a freakier holiday title unless they watch Jim Carrey as The Grinch.
Listening to every word, Bobby shook his head and smiled. They were idjits, but they were his idjits and he wouldn’t give them up for anything.
Indeed, he was as he continually thought about the pair, especially Cas. It was unheard of for him or Sam to make a connection like that with their fans. This was why you didn’t get involved. Did he really make a connection though? He had talked to Jack like he did every other person who came through that night and other nights. If so, why them? It had been the damnedest thing. Dean hadn’t been too concerned. They would fade from his thoughts in time or at least settle comfortably in his memories.
The festival took months to plan, starting in mid-July and wrapping up the first week in December. Everything was going along smoothly until November first. That was the day The Miller’s Daughters called to cancel.
Cas beamed at him, warmth and love emanating from him so intensely it took Dean’s breath away. “Yes. I want you here with me however that works out with your schedule. We’ll sit down later and figure it all out. Or at least enough to give a sense of what your living in town will look like. I’m sure getting that rental won’t be an issue. You can tell me your reasons for wanting the place while we skate. Or you can share them later at my place.”
Once he had assured the musician he wanted him by his side, Cas smiled when he had felt a squeeze on his knee. He had leaned back and planted a kiss on Dean’s cheek as
Words didn’t exist in Dean’s mind now. All he could do was nod, briefly smile, and book it upstairs to his room. He saw the look on Sam’s face as he passed him. There was no question he was going to hear about this for the rest of his life. Dean wanted nothing more than to lock himself in the suite and only come out when it was time to perform.
The blush that singed Cas’ cheeks and the beatific smile that caressed his lips affected two organs of Dean’s in similar ways. His heart swelled as the beat became wilder while his cock plumped up nice and firm.
His nerves calmed a little when Sam saw his brother and Castiel were okay for the most part. The blood seeping through Castiel’s white dress shirt concerned him. Could he not heal himself? He managed to quirk the corner of his mouth when he gave Dean a quick nod. John may have told his brother to watch out for him as an order when they were kids, but Sam was just as protective of Dean. And now, Castiel. The angel had proven his loyalty to the Winchesters so many times over the years, he was family. It was always painful to watch Castiel and Dean fall out, which they did more times than Sam could count. Their ideologies may be slightly different, but they tended to be on the same page. Thankfully, they always came back together eventually.
A bigger grin appeared on Dean’s lips when he caught a glimpse of the satisfaction in the other man’s features.
“Our story only enhances it for him. At least the first one. We don’t really match the other two films as much.” Cas lifted a shoulder.
As though a switch had been flipped, Dean’s frown turned upside down. “Yeah, there is. Let’s do this! Any chance of finding a hot drink and maybe some cookies along the way? I’m not going to get anything tomorrow night during the opening ceremonies.”
It got even more embarrassing when the new arrivals went to get checked in as Jack was on front desk duty. Mary Winchester’s blue gray eyes widened when she made the connection.
“No. This is not on you.” He glared at the entrance to the dining room, almost willing his father to return so he could do something violent. Punching him in the head was the current fantasy playing in his mind.
Much to his dismay, Dean didn’t have time to argue. He opted to view it in a positive light. “It’s not a no, so it’ll have to be good enough for now.”
Jack and Jo both smirked at their parents’ reactions before the reality of it sank in with them. Neither was particularly looking forward to the bigger crowds. As much as they loved their hometown, they liked it more any other time of year. It was why Jack and Claire hung out at one of their friends' houses last night instead of dealing with the tourist trap the town had already become now that the out-of-towners were invading. Jo didn’t have to convince her mother that a quiet night in was exactly what they needed after she came home yesterday afternoon.
“Come on, the town square is up ahead. I’ll show you where you’ll be playing Friday night as part of the festival’s tree lighting ceremony.”
Normally when performing, the brothers would wear dark jeans and layer an open, button-up over a T-shirt. For tonight, they opted for something a little more polished. Dress pants with the shirt tucked in, minus the tee. Jo even wore a sleeveless dress paired with a set of tall boots she loved.
“Yes. It was mine when I first moved here. I lived there till Kelly got sick. That’s when I moved in here. For whatever reason, I couldn’t bear parting with the place. So when I learned renting it out was an option, I leapt at the chance. Turns out it’s a decent moneymaker. Its helped me contribute a little extra to Jack’s college tuition fund and feather my own nest egg.”
“As you said, John, we are in a popular Christmas town and as it is the final day of the festival, everyone is out enjoying the myriad activities available ahead of the big finale, which, as you know, is the Scrapyard Dogs concert out at The Barn. I imagine you’ll see more come back later for dinner, but a number will dine at the downtown restaurants.
When Dean hears Chastity scream, the sight he finds as he races to the back of the building is not something he was prepared for. There’s Chastity-- screaming and throwing things at Cas. And then there’s Cas-- trenchcoat hanging off his shoulders, hair tousled in all directions, blue eyes wide and mouth agape in confusion at the commotion he’s caused. As it turns out, Castiel had believed this to be the prime time to inform Chastity that it wasn’t her fault her father abandoned her, that he had just hated his job. It’s a quick, fleeting thought, but it’s there nonetheless.
for the first time is nearly overwhelming. He can’t decide if moving or staying like this forever would feel better. Luckily, he doesn’t have to dwell on it long because after a minute, Cas’ hands are gripping his hips, lifting him up, and dropping him back down as he fucks back up into Dean, and Dean is seeing stars. Apocalypse who? The only thing either of their minds can focus on is the sound of skin slapping against skin and the permeating smell of sex and sweat filling the Impala. The fatigue in their muscles is lost to the need that drives Dean up and down Cas’ cock, drives Cas to thrust sloppily into Dean while sweet praises roll off his tongue.
The moment his fingertips brush against Castiel’s skin, Dean decides he never wants to break away again. He’d always valued the rare moments he’d get to touch Castiel—when the angel would heal him, picking him up after a fight, the brush of knuckles when they’d stand just a little too close together. Always fleeting, gone before either of them had time to blink, but the warmth would linger for much longer than either would care to admit and maybe, just maybe, they both recognized it.
And then he’s laughing. A warm, deep-bellied laugh takes over Dean as he leans over because that has to be the most ridiculous thing to have happened to him in a minute. The tightness and shame are gone, buried under a repeating mantra of
There was no reason anymore. Castiel didn’t need an excuse. They were free of Chuck, free from the host of heaven lording over them, free from the shame and guilt that had plagued them for so long, and he was going to enjoy it damnit. There would be no scarred handprint on his skin, but Dean has left marks of his own.
The loss of contact startles Dean and leaves him with an insatiable craving for more. Cas scoots down the bed and pulls Dean’s pants and boxers the rest of the way off, the both of them at last with nothing between them. In a moments time, Cas’s head is bobbing along Dean’s cock, hands pressing his hips down into the bed. Dean can no longer form thoughts. “Cas I- oh plea-fuck keep going,” he begs. There’s a drag of teeth across the tip here, a tongue wrapping around the head there, all sorts skills Castiel didn’t know he had but was pleased to know he did. He enjoys the way Dean twitches when he drags his nails up the inside of his thighs, head bent back from the intensity of the fire burning in his core.
Dean know what he wants. Dean knows what Cas wants because Cas is rutting up against his knee like a horny teenager. Castiel knows what Dean wants because Dean is still begging for more, crying “Please, Cas, I need it,” against the headrest. Dean can’t think straight. There’s a sudden loss of contact and his body recoils, but the warmth quickly returns as Dean finds himself against completely bare flesh, save the tan trenchcoat now laid out beneath them. “fu-fucking angel magic,’ he stammers out as Castiel’s hands return to their positions and resume their holy work.
as something other than apocalypse stoppers had become fewer and farther between. To take time off for personal enjoyment is selfish when the world is ending. But what about when the world is always ending? Castiel was always trying to help them stop the apocalypse—the guy deserved a break, and Dean sure as hell did too. He’d earned a good laugh.
Cas leans into Dean’s touch, mind drunk with the feeling. He  doesn’t feel the fire in the air. Rather, he feels it on his skin and in his bones, warm blush creeping from his cheeks. He may have been lost the first time he laid hands on Dean, but he was found the first Dean laid hands on him. In twelve years (which is an incredibly short time span when you’ve lived for eons), Dean Winchester had done more to change Castiel than anything else in the universe. Nothing God could do would ever come close to what Dean had brought. Everything he’s done—he rebelled, he bled, he died—all for one man.
The praise sends him over the edge, and Dean is coming white hot stripes across Castiel’s hand and chest. The angel’s hand continues to stroke him, teasing his head while his thighs shake from exertion. Dean blushes. Castiel laughs.
His face falls for a moment and he pauses, the car door resting against his leg. It felt like they’d been dealt nothing but constant hardballs. Their chances to relax and just
Castiel looks pensive. He stares out the window to the alleyway ahead, thinking to himself for a moment before responding. “I was thinking the experience might be more enjoyable with a partner I had already established a strong friendship with. That would allow me to have already developed adequate social skills to make the experience less “psychologically scarring,” as you say,” he says. Cas holds up his air quotes, but continues to look straight ahead. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say he saw Castiel blushing in the dim yellow glow of broken alleyway lights .
commands, and for once, Dean really wants to obey orders. With one move, Dean is straddling Cas’ hips and hovering over his straining cock. This is somehow more frightening than the apocalypse, but damn if he isn’t fucking excited. Maybe this is all some fever dream. Maybe he is hallucinating. Maybe this is all some cruel angel joke or something, who the fuck knows? But when Castiel says, “Be good for me, Dean,” again, followed by, “Be good and sit on my cock,” literally nothing else matters anymore. Cas’ wish is his command. Dean sinks down slowly onto Cas, legs threatening to give out from underneath him because there is no possible way something was meant to feel this good. The stretch of his hole around the angel’s cock and the feeling of being
When he woke a few days later to Castiel standing in his doorway, his body nearly split trying to do all the things he wanted to do at once.
Castiel’s back thuds as Dean pushes him back against the passenger door, attacking his neck with a fervor. Purple and red marks color Cas’ neck as Dean works his way around it. He bites the tender spots along his collarbone and under his chin, pressing hard kisses against the angry skin before moving to an unclaimed section of skin. As he works, strong hands grip Dean’s hips and lift him onto Cas’ lap. Dean straddles his thigh and tries his best not to moan against him when he feels something press against his knee. He knows damn well what that is, and it’s not Cas’ angel blade.
“I suppose not.” Cas mirrored him. “I didn’t know I had left such an impression. You must meet hundreds of people while touring.”
Nodding in understanding and biting his bottom lip to hold back a grin, Dean looked at Cas. “So, you gonna pick out your ornament, Butch? Never hung out with a notorious bad boy before. That’s usually my shtick.”
Turning the upper half of his body so his arms were atop that of the chair, Dean leaned forward. “Do tell. You got one that’s going to make me sleep like a baby?”
Cas had spent every moment since that conversation trying to figure out the best time to tell Dean his decision. He didn’t want to just blurt it out as it was a huge step for them and he wanted the announcement to be a moment to remember. So, he had kept his mouth shut when he was with Dean and to his boyfriend’s credit (is that what they were? God, he hoped so.
Dean Winchester had changed his life from the moment he had seen him again in the lobby when he checked in the brothers. The past few days had been nothing short of wonderful and the remaining time they had together promised to be nothing less. Which brought Cas back to Dean’s proposition. His answer hadn’t changed since Dean suggested getting a place here. Cas knew there was nothing keeping Dean in Palo Alto, California, where he shared a house with Sam.
“Claire,” Cas growled. He could feel his cheeks burning at the insinuation. Not because he was embarrassed by his feelings for Dean, but because she called him out on it. On the count of three, he chanced a glance at Dean, who also had a tint on his cheeks that was too intense to be entirely from the cold air on this overcast day.
To prove his point, he rubbed their precum over both cocks, mixing the fluids as he did so. Slowly, his hand moved up and down their shafts with Castiel keeping pace so they worked as one. As predicted, the precum worked fine. The friction sent a warm sensation to the base of their spines, edging its way up bit by bit until it overtook them. Castiel’s hand mostly covered Dean’s cock while Dean’s did the same with Castiel’s, the heat that built up was emotional as well as physical.
Music had been a passion they picked up from John, who had a bar band back in the day. That was how the senior Winchester had met Mary. She was out on a blind date set up by a friend. The date had heard about “this bitchin’ band” from a guy in his dorm. A senior at the University of Kansas, Mary had little interest in landing a boyfriend when graduation was in her sights. The only reason she had agreed to the date was because her friend wanted their off-campus apartment for the night to be with her own boyfriend. Mr. Blind Date was the best friend of her roommate’s boyfriend. Plus, her friend owed her now.
Dean had slid his hand in Cas’, pulling him toward the tree. His head in the moment, Cas joined in his friend’s hunt for the perfect spot to hang their ornaments. When they had it, they handed the angel and the plastic drum with sticks at the ready to the man in the cherry picker. The men watched as he hung them exactly where they had indicated.
Each kiss, each movement of tongue was slow, deliberate. They luxuriated in the intimacy, which suited Dean fine. Low lighting courtesy of the electric fireplace set the perfect mood. On this cold winter’s night, there was no place Dean wanted to be than on this couch with Cas.
Dean gestured toward Cas, making sure he had at his attention. “Don’t you dare move. I always have time for you.” He glanced at the younger man. “Hey, Jack. You like the backstage tour? Not too lame?”
“Holy crap,” Dean muttered. Then, with the appropriate enthusiasm only a child of six could muster, “We get to spend Christmas in Christmasland! This is fucking
Pride flooded Cas’ features. “I see it, too. I chalk it up to a mix of nature and nurture. There’s so much Kelly in him. In his phrasing. His gestures. The way he looks at me sometimes when I’m being obstinate or obtuse. It’s breathtaking how much he reminds me of her.
Flipping himself over so he was on his back and opening his legs wide, he smiled up at Cas. “Now I’m ready, angel.”
Cas had heeded Dean’s silent warning earlier, ducking back out the door and coming through a side entrance without being detected by any of the family. He was ready to meet John and Mary, but couldn’t afford to be distracted from his work as he had planned a short day due to the concert. Luckily, the Winchesters had kept to their rooms until their meal reservation so Cas was able to stay on course. There was a phone call he was expecting, but otherwise had made sure to let the staff know he was not to be disturbed while he was in the dining room.
Fourteen weeks later, Bobby had been hired as their manager with John and Mary’s approval and seven months after that, the boys had their first recording contract with an independent label. Scrapyard Dogs were officially a band. As for the name, well, Bobby owned a salvage yard, where he lived in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Dean and Sam had always considered themselves scrappy and up for a fight. They were quite proud of the moniker.
His head sorted, Cas got back to work. The rest of the day was spent putting out metaphorical fires; the ones that always seemed to occur right before a major event. Nothing too difficult, though it was taxing on his nerves and spiked his anxiety levels. He knew he shouldn’t let it affect him as it was better for these incidents to happen now and not once the festival commenced.
Jody had wanted to fire Bal’s ass on the spot the second Cas had told her what had happened, but it was Cas who had told her not to bother. Despite feeling like a total ass for letting his guard down, and allowing Bal into his and Jack’s lives, Cas couldn’t deny the interloper was damn good at his job. He had already started noticing an uptick in reservations for Christmas week that year, which meant word had been getting out about the Winter Festival.
After he ate, Sam went to check on them when he heard what only could be described as sex sounds coming from within.
“Well, with your tour schedule, I’m not surprised. From what Bobby’s told me, you have a mix of tours with established artists and your own solo runs. Can’t leave you much time to road trip for fun.”
Dean finished revealing all the major highlights of his and Cas’ courtship to date, from how they met onward. Reliving it all (keeping the sexy bits for himself) made his heart full, something he never had occasion to feel before Cas. He wished his boyfriend were here with him as his absence was profound. As soon as he could, Dean was making a beeline for him, wherever he was.
Once in Coldwater, the house was easy to find as it was literally the only mansion in the town’s limits. At this point, it had become painfully obvious this was a trap. Grabbing the essential tools needed from the weapons compartment in Baby’s protected trunk — under the lid was a pentagram and various sigils — the trio headed toward the house. They split up only to discover just how deep they were in it.
He glanced back at Sam, who was still hanging out near the door despite having shut it once Dean was inside. The knowing smirk his baby brother wore settled the matter.
Walking out of her office with her winter trench coat buttoned up, she extended her hand to Dean, then Sam. “Hope the drive wasn’t too horrible. Savannah, right?”
“What do you want to do to me tonight, Dean?” Castiel’s voice was low and husky. That growl purred in Dean’s ear and fuck it was doing so many things to his body he might die right there.
“It’s been awhile. Like a long while,” Cas retorted sarcastically as he returned. “Thank God for Amazon.”
When Cas had come up to him after dinner, which was a delicious feast that Dean would savor for the rest of his life, it had taken him by surprise that the other man asked him to hang out. He hadn’t expected more alone time so soon. No way was he turning down any chance to be with Cas. Dean had said yes instantly, loving the way Cas’ face brightened and how his smile made his eyes crinkle.
“Probably,” Ellen admitted. She and Cas sighed at the thought of even more people crowding the sidewalks, and filling the shops and restaurants and hotels despite them both being owners of those very establishments.
, angel. And you are very welcome.” Dean whispered into his lover’s ear. His arms were now wrapped around Castiel. “Let’s just stay like this for awhile. I love how you’re holding me.”
No sooner had he raised his hand to knock on the suite’s door, it swung open. An exasperated Sam stood at the threshold.
Castiel was the first to realize this when he ran into a familiar face as he came around the right side of the perimeter. Far from friendly, this angel had said only
A woman in her early thirties with long red hair approached him on his left, next to Jack. Anna Milton was his assistant manager, who had just started her shift Cas realized. He had lost all track of time, but knew it must be some time after two. She informed him the phone call he had been expecting had come. Nodding, he thanked her and told her he would be there shortly.
When he gained consciousness, the first thing Dean noticed was he was handcuffed to an armchair. The second thing was Castiel sitting across from him in the same fashion yet bleeding. This caused his protective nature to flare up. He hated seeing his loved ones injured or in pain. Castiel caught his eye and nodded. Dean understood this to mean his friend was okay. Castiel understood the curt nod he received in return to mean their captors were going to pay once Dean was free. This made his heart feel light. It always did. Not because of the inevitable violence, but of what it meant: Dean had his back.
“I refuse to have my sex life broadcast throughout town because I bought lube at the local drug store instead of driving a half-hour to the Walgreens in Mitchell. Missouri Moseley, who owns the pharmacy is a sweetheart and I love her dearly, but she’s the town gossip. She puts the CIA, Mossad, and TMZ to shame.”
An awkward silence settled over the room. After letting it hang for a few seconds, Jack announced he was going upstairs. The men wished him a good night, watching as he left them behind. Neither said a word till they heard his bedroom door close.
Cas put himself in the parents’ shoes and wow, was that a mistake. A wave of neuroses — led by trepidation, fear, and doubt — washed over him, leaving him stricken. What was he thinking letting Dean move here after only knowing him for a week? Since when he was a lovestruck fool who made decisions with his heart instead of his head? The problem with that theory was that Cas had moved to Snow Falls because he saw Kelly needed him. His heart made the call and his head went along with it because Jack and Helen Kline took pity on him by offering him the job at the lodge.
She could see the apprehension leaking from his pores and wanted to calm his nerves. “Actually, one spot is along Main Street. You probably passed it when you came in. It’s the spot for the tree lighting concert. Very low key, troubadour feel. I can show you where you'll be playing all ages afternoon gig, too. Your big show is at a special venue, which I can show you tomorrow.”
are you even talking about? Cas is the best man I have ever known. I love him and he loves me and that’s all there is to it!”
“If you’re looking for an activity to pass the time before the show, I recommend Arcade Alley, which has a number of seasonal twists on familiar games. As a retired Marine and with your field experience, I think you will do quite well at the snowball toss. Or perhaps you prefer to watch a movie in the park? I can get you a schedule, but I know
He shot her look telling her to zip it, but Dean didn’t say anything to deny that he had all but checked out of his suite.
“In part. It was the first thing I thought when I saw you. I hadn’t had that reaction to anyone in a long time. But it also stuck because of how much you love your son.” He considered what he had just said. “That sounded gross. What I’m trying to say is I admire your relationship. How he looks up to you and how you respect him.
“No. That’s why I’m checking in. I had hoped you heard something by now. I’ve been praying to him, but he’s not answering.”
The day of the concert in the park was a busy one for Cas as there were multiple emergencies that had kept him busy all morning and well into the afternoon. It was after one o’clock when the last of the fires had been extinguished, allowing him to take a moment for himself. He was hungry as he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, but he knew if he wanted to get a good spot, he and Jack would have to leave now. If the crowd at the tree lighting was any indication, they were probably already too late.
because Jack had shown him the scene with the psychotic gingerbread men, which he had loved. Also, Toni Collette. Sam picked
The eighteen-year-old who had stepped over to Dean’s side of the table after talking with Sam for a minute had gotten his attention when he told Dean how “Down the Road” was his favorite Scrapyard Dogs song. That was off their second EP, released a good eighteen months before their debut album dropped and barely made a blip. Dean was impressed by the deep cut shout out and even more so when the kid told him it reminded him of a Robert Johnson track someone had introduced him to on something called a Discord server. Whatever the hell that was. But hey, it was getting the younger generation into some damn fine music, so more power to it.
He vaguely remembered Jessica winding her arms around one of his as she stood next to him, their seats long abandoned.
Mind blown by such unmitigated kindness, it took Cas some time before he was able to form a cohesive thought. “You did? But you don’t really know me.”
Now, he was sitting in Cas’ car on the way to his house for what was essentially a date (was it their second or third? He couldn’t be sure) and he was so fucking nervous. Why was he so nervous? His brain didn’t compute what apparently the rest of his body had. They were alone last night and it was fine. He did not want a repeat of the freak out from a couple days ago. Dean refused to screw this up again. Whatever
His brother looked as though Dean had punched him in the face. The anger that rose to the surface nearly matched what the older sibling felt. “Jess, obviously. How could you even think I’m not happy for you? Dean, I have watched you fall apart, blame yourself, shut out the world, and piece by piece pull yourself back together after Lisa. Seeing you fall for Cas has been the best Christmas gift. Seeing him fall for you right back? I’m set for the next ten Christmases.”
She sighed. “Cas, I’m sorry. It never occurred to me he would be anything less than happy to see you. Especially from the way Jack talked and your reaction to his retelling of that night. I honestly wasn’t planning some lovers reunion. Much.”
Those green eyes widened in shock. “What?! Hell, no! You kidding?! I couldn't believe I got so lucky.”
Sam’s gaze went from Jack to Cas as he debated whether to tell them the truth. “Okay, full disclosure. Dean is not fun to be around before we play. The bigger the venue the bitchier he gets. Honestly, he’s not even that today, but….” He hesitated, unsure how to describe his brother’s mood. “I just think it’s best for everyone if you wait till after the show. That’s all.”
Those blue eyes narrowed shrewdly. “I see. Trying to pilfer my lunchmeat and condiments. Guess it’s lucky we ran into each other as I make a mean sandwich.”
before going to the eye doctor?” Sam asked. “Not that it mattered considering her vision didn’t clear until two days after Christmas.”
“You know, you can’t have me worrying about you like I did last night.” He caught Castiel’s eye. “I was shitting bricks driving around half of Kansas looking for you.”
The night was long with no sense of an end in sight. A quarter moon hung in the blue-black sky shining a sliver of light on the two-lane blacktop that the 1967 Chevrolet Impala traveled. It was as dark the road itself, wheels spinning as it carried its owner to nowhere in particular. Miles stretched ahead and even more lay in its wake. They had been traveling for hours now. A full tank made one problem go away. Five miles back it had been an issue until the driver happened upon an empty gas station with its lights still on and an “open” sign hanging in the window of the small convenience store that sat a few feet behind the pumping station.
“I will not stand here and watch you drive away our son. Now, we will talk about this civilly. Am I understood?”
Dean’s breath caught. He was resting on his forearms, clutching the found towel in one hand. All the ways he thought this night was going to go when he, Sam, and Castiel raided that mansion in Coldwater, this was not even on the list. There was a lot to be said for seeing where the night took you. This already had become the best one of his life. It just kept getting more wonderful and sexier and perfect.
Scrapyard Dogs took the stage to the roar of a very appreciative crowd. One that took full advantage of the all ages policy as attendees ranged from senior citizens to infants. Everybody sang along to the songs during the audience participation segments, of which there were many. Their enthusiasm was infectious as Dean was buzzing through the entire fifty-minute concert, which included an encore.
Dean like he had never wanted anyone. In the past, Cas had rarely, if ever, initiated sex. Even making out, his partner would make the first move after it was clear Cas was interested.
He was grateful Dean had shut it off as he needed the sleep. The lodge hadn’t any issues, nor had he expected any. It was mostly paranoia that had him running in so early all week. Except for one day, it had been all quiet on the hospitality front. No complaints. No disasters. No problems at all.
“She’ll be fine. It’s been months since she’s seen Mom and she’s looking forward to the plane ride. Dad’s thrilled since it means he’ll have time to finish the latest Stephen King during the flight.”
Dean got on all fours, letting out a low hum as Cas ran his hands down his back and over those globes, giving them a squeeze. If he were reacting like this to just his touch, Cas couldn’t wait until they got to the main event. The idea of Dean as a responsive lover made him hard, which didn’t take much as he was halfway there before now. He quickly ran into the bathroom to grab the fresh tube of lube and one of the condoms from the box he bought the other day.
“Do you mind?” Dean turned his head to look at his brother in consternation. “I’m having a moment here.”
A couple hours later, Dean and Cas parted ways in the lobby of the mountain lodge after a rather enjoyable afternoon. Each had things to do before the dinner at the mayor’s house that evening. Dean’s face exploded in joy when he learned Cas would be in attendance. He had been looking forward to the event regardless, but now, well….
“This is my least offensive one, believe it or not.” Pride could be heard in Dean’s voice. “The other one I brought has two deer humping. However, that’s nothing compared to one I had ten years ago. Stripper pole. Hot blonde. Three very happy, albeit poor, elves.”
“This last song is a personal favorite of mine,” Dean told the crowd. “Doesn’t get a lot of airplay this time of year, which is a damn crime. So we’re gonna play it for you and when you fall in love with it — and you will — go buy a copy and play the crap out of it and share it with everyone you know. Because it’s that awesome.
What bothered John wasn’t that Dean wouldn’t be spending Christmas in Lawrence with him and Mary. Sam and Jess had been splitting holidays between them and her family for years, so Dean doing the same with Cas would be fine.
. He had believed for the longest time that he had been friend zoned by Dean. The best friend. Nothing more. That had been acceptable as they were as close as two people not having sexual relations could be.
The walls were painted a light mossy green that complimented the hardwood floors and snow white ceiling. There was a closet, its white doors closed, next to the en suite bathroom with the bed sitting opposite and a pair of nightstands on either side. A bureau was nestled in a corner near one of the nightstands. Across from the bedroom door, beneath a pair of windows that looked out over the front yard, was a low bookcase filled with books and framed candid photos of Jack and Kelly (some even included Cas) over the years.
Hearing the anger and resentment in Jack’s voice had brought back the painful memories of his ill-fated relationship with Bal Hart, a consultant hired by the town council to position Snow Falls as a tourist destination.
“That would be hypocritical considering how tight Sammy and I are. Hell, I've been living with him for the past few years. When I probably should have moved out a year ago.”
Standing naked in front of each other, it wasn’t long before Cas’ lips and hands started roaming Dean’s skin. The skin on his neck was suckled. His nipples were tweaked. The globes of his ass were squeezed. Their cocks rubbed together triggering moans from both.
Cas observed John peripherally, wondering what was bothering the man. He met his eyes once and they both smiled automatically. John’s didn’t quite reach his eyes. This bothered Cas as he feared if Dean’s parents didn’t approve of him, then their future wasn’t as secure as he had thought.
A mistake that would not be repeated when he headed back out on the road next week for a summer concert tour that included Scrapyard Dogs’ annual tradition of headlining the Lawrence, Kansas, Fourth of July celebration. Cas and Jack would be joining him and Sam for five days in their hometown before hitting a few other stops with the brothers as Cas would be taking two weeks off. It had been Dean’s idea for his family to come along, which they loved. A final trip before Jack had to leave for college.
you put down roots here with a guy and his kid who would love to have you around for more than a week?”
“Then, we agree.” He leaned in and captured that mouth in a sweet, chaste kiss. It was all he could afford as his energy levels were dropping fast.
Dean stopped, grabbing Cas’ arm. “You celebrate all the seasons?! And you refer to the others as the off-season? How does that make sense?”
It was rough on the younger Winchester being separated from his longtime girlfriend for so long. Dean knew Sam had been planning on going home to spend some quality time with Jessica during the holidays. Living with a brother who was in a relationship sometimes wasn’t easy, which was why Sam had been going to stay at Jessica’s place. He said it was to give Dean a little breathing room between the back-to-back tours and Christmas. Maybe it was, but Dean suspected it was more like Sam didn’t want to rub his happily ever after in his face.
This blew the angel’s mind. So much new information was making itself available tonight that he had a hard time believing it was true. It was though.
He turned his thoughts back to yesterday. The morning after they had made love for the first time had been spent naked in bed taking advantage of the last hours they could be together before the chaos of the concerts, the festival, and Christmas took over. Cas would be at the lodge for the most part while Dean rehearsed and went over the details of everything with Sam and Bobby. The set lists were done, but it wouldn’t surprise Dean if he or Sam decided one song worked better than another which meant they would be learning a tune quickly.
“So, you’re saying Cas is my reward for clawing my way to accepting and embracing my true self? Because I’m good with that.”
“Since your balls are on the menu for lunch, what’s dessert going to be?” She volleyed, more than up for the challenge of keeping this game going.
Dean let himself into Sam’s suite with the key card they had requested from the front desk prior to checking in. They always got keys to each other’s rooms while traveling. Despite the freedom that came in having their own space, the brothers liked being able to come and go from each other’s rooms as they pleased. Bobby let them be, figuring it was easier for them to keep an eye on each other than for him to be chasing after them. A job he neither wanted nor needed.
Even though they didn’t last, Benny was the one who first broke Dean’s hard shell. He paved the way for Lisa and now Cas. Without his influence, Dean wouldn’t be the man he was today and he was forever grateful that Benny had come into his life when he did. There was no doubt he would be indebted to the man for the rest of his life.
Claire had been next as she had to help her mothers set up after finding out what Santa left for her. She may have an old soul, Cas noted, but she was a kid when it came to Christmas.
Sam was right. If Dean was going to lock down his happily ever after, he was going to have annihilate his parents. Whatever it was John had a bug up his ass about couldn’t be Dean’s undoing. Not after all the pain and loneliness when he had seriously doubted he was capable of a lasting, loving relationship.
“Gotta admit, I wasn’t sure if your equipment worked a hundred percent like mine,” he told Castiel huskily. “I’m glad it does though. Not that we couldn’t have worked something out.”
However, it wasn’t the potential of snow that Cas had awake two hours before his alarm was set to go off. John and Mary Winchester were due to step foot in Snow Falls later this morning with plans to have a family lunch … and he was invited. He had never met the parents of any of his boyfriends before. Mostly because his last real boyfriend was in college, where the relationship had ended prior to graduation. The few lovers he had since moving to town weren’t serious enough to warrant the introduction.
When Castiel came, Dean swallowed as much as he could. He kissed his boyfriend after the angel finished so he could theoretically taste himself. Castiel loved it. Not only because he liked the sensation of his own cum on his tongue, but because it was Dean who was serving it to him. It was almost as if he was tasting
“We would if we could,” Sam admitted. “We’ve always talked about stealing our dad’s sixty-seven Chevy Impala and not looking back but, short of having everything we love stripped away — including breathing — I just don’t think we can make the time. When we’re not touring, we’re basically working on new songs or recording.”
“Thank you, Cas. I really appreciate hearing that.” He glared at Dean, who smirked at his brother’s discomfort.
The silence that filled the room was deafening. Mary broke it first as she was tired of waiting for her husband to make the initial move.
As luck would have it, the run-through at the lodge went smoothly. Cas had all hands on deck to make sure each department knew the drill for the next week. All were well versed on the Winter Festival and its potential impact on the lodge, giving their boss the peace of mind he so greatly appreciated ahead of the biggest event of the year. Plans A and B were given attention, as was Plan C when Cas sprung it on the head of each department. He wasn’t disappointed. The session ended with his usual rally cry consisting of how this was going to be White Spruce Mountain Lodge’s best year yet and how they are the best at what they do.
Lovers weren’t something Castiel confessed to having. His first was a reaper bitch who had tricked him into cashing in his v-card in order to hold him hostage and torture him for information. This happened a few years ago. Before that, nothing. Balthazar had been a big neon sign, but still zilch. The rock star angel who gave exactly zero fucks about anything except his old pal Castiel basically eye fucked him every time they were in the same room. Castiel never seemed to hate it. On the contrary, it very much appeared as though he liked it. At least in Dean’s estimation. But what did he know? Until tonight, he hadn’t been able to admit he was bisexual.
“He may be eighteen, but he wasn’t driving four hours to get here without an adult in the car. Good thing I’m something of a fan of yours, as well.”
His eyes scanned the faces that passed them by as they walked along the sidewalk as well as those across the street. Dean hadn’t been fully aware he was doing it, but he was looking for someone. The odds were incredibly low he would find this person here of all places. He didn’t even know the guy’s full name for crying out loud. They had a nice little exchange during a meet and greet in Minneapolis last month where Dean and Sam had agreed to autograph merchandise bought at the show following their performance as the opening act.
At half-past eleven on Christmas Eve morning, Dean and Sam welcomed their parents and Sam’s longtime girlfriend Jessica Moore to Snow Falls when the trio walked into the lobby of the White Spruce Mountain Lodge. The brothers had been rather laissez faire about their incoming parents until about an hour before their arrival when the anticipation of seeing them again had adrenaline coursing through their veins. Jessica coming to town, meanwhile, had Sam fit to burst for days he was so excited.
No sooner had Cas given her his and Jack’s names then Sam appeared. He looked a little harried, but Cas assumed that was normal right before a performance. They followed the tall man with the long brown hair that ended just past his ears into the backstage of the pavilion, which was deceptively larger than Cas had expected. Never had he been given an opportunity to explore the space till now. It was very impressive.
“Screw you!” As soon as he said it, Dean realized he would have to start choosing his words more carefully. The wicked glint sparkling in Cas’ eyes only made it more obvious.
Holding his hands up as though proof no wrong-doing had occurred, Dean confessed, “Haven’t gone below the waist.”
John’s love of music had been passed down to Dean, who had embraced his dad’s love of 1970s and 1980s guitar rock. AC/DC. Allman Brothers. Foreigner. Eric Clapton. They were gods to Dean. Kansas’ “Carry On, Wayward Son” was a particular favorite. Sam had been slow to embrace the artists that had captured his dad’s and brother’s hearts, though the 1960s and 1970s were the decades he liked best. He did have a fondness for The Rolling Stones. In truth, he also was a fan of The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Carole King, and U2. Dean was still disappointed that last band had made their way onto Sam’s top five list.
Dean bent over and kissed each of his boyfriend’s hands. “She is so proud of both of you. You raised that kid into the amazing man he is today. His success up to now is, in part, because of you and all the support and encouragement and love you gave him. The two of you will always be with him.
Sam grinned, nodding. “Fair enough. Besides, can’t leave Jack all alone with you and his dad being all handsy.”
A sheepish grin spread across his lips. “I did, actually. After Dean took the phone away and scolded me.”
“For a moment, I thought he was happy to see me,” he admitted forlornly. “There was this light in his eyes that flared later when I handed him his key card.”
“Did you catch the name of that lake?” Disbelief flooded his features. “Figured we could make camp there for the night.”
He felt Dean’s hand on his shoulder. “You didn’t. I’m sorry my freaking out freaked you out. I never expected to see you again.”
“Hearing your and Cas’ story, and watching you two at lunch explains a lot to me. I see now why you kept him to yourself. It’s going to take a lot of work with your music career going strong, but if you’re serious — and I think you both are — I believe you could be very happy together.
“You driving him nuts with the concert schedule for this week? We’ve seen all the venues. Checked each one out thoroughly. It’s all good.” Bobby opened his mouth, but Dean cut him off. “Yeah, yeah. I know you’re still going to check them out for yourself again tomorrow. Probably already talked to Jody about it, too. I’m right, aren’t I?”
But because until that night, Dean had thought his queer side had been an aberration. One male lover in forty-two years — and that had been more than fifteen years ago — had seemed to be a fluke. He had never hid his bisexuality, but there never had been another man he had been attracted to enough to take to bed.
“Mom’s not complaining, so I’m guessing you’d be home alone, Macaulay Culkin, eating all those foods you’re not supposed to and regretting it later when you’re laid up with indigestion.”
Dean chanced a glance at his friend, who wore a serene smile proffering some eye crinkles of his own. He grinned in response. Castiel looked well, a little tired perhaps but that was to be expected. His eyes caught blood on the lapel of the trench coat, on the perpetually loosened blue tie, and the white dress shirt.
Framing Cas’ face with his hands, Dean captured his mouth in a meaningful way. He wasn’t in a rush as he assumed there would be plenty of time for a proper plundering of Cas’ perfect mouth. A gasp blew out of him when Cas roughly brought Dean closer, but the speed and pacing of their kissing didn’t change. Dean liked that this kind, thoughtful man needed him as much as he did. That any time or space apart was unwelcome, unthinkable.
John took a step closer, invading his son’s personal space. “You’re going to leave your family for a man who has you moving in a week after you’ve met? Are you insane?”
Dean liked that Cas didn’t jump back like he had been caught doing something wrong when his son appeared. Instead, Cas broke the kiss (reluctantly from Dean’s point of view) and leaned back against the couch with a wry grin on his red, swollen lips.
His father’s words from this afternoon blared in Dean’s head, which he bowed in shame as he fingered the Metallica keychain. He hated that Cas had feared the worst from him. He also understood it. Relationships were hard enough, but navigating your partner’s feelings whether you had been together ten days or ten years could be treacherous without open communication.
When Dean had come out of the first-floor hallway where his parents’ suite was located a few minutes before twelve-thirty, Cas was behind the front desk with Jack as part of his plan to check in with the various departments to make sure there were no issues ahead of the holiday. Cas had looked up when he heard footfalls on the hardwood, smiling as he saw his boyfriend coming toward him.
“It took you just long enough. From what I understand, this is a different journey for everyone. I’m just so happy and grateful we’re on the same page. Thought, to be honest, I never thought we would be.
“Hell, I’ll defend your honor right now. Gimme an address. We’ll go. I’ll kick his ass to kingdom come and you can watch.”
Now, Cas listened as Jody gave her official welcome speech, only half listening as he scanned the crowd. He knew who he was looking for without consciously being aware of it. When he found Dean standing off to the side of the stage watching the proceedings with Sam and Bobby, Cas grinned. His chest felt tight and warmth filled him as he observed Dean until Jody wrapped up and the square went dark.
“It’s okay, Cas. I’ve got you. I’m not going anywhere, angel.” Dean kept hold of him while rubbing his back. He also dropped a kiss on his lover’s shoulder. “You’re safe with me.”
That made him cringe. Fuck it. Labels were overrated anyway. They belonged to each other for now and that was what was important.
Abruptly ripped out of his reverie by a surly Bobby, it took Dean a few seconds to focus. When he did, he quickly crossed his legs to hide his erection. He did
The crowd over by the pavilion was as big as the one at the tree lighting ceremony, if not a bit larger. It could be that everyone was more spread out, Cas observed. Either way, he was glad to have an inside man. He glanced at Jack, who was at his side as they moved along the outer edge away from where the people bundled up in coats, hats, scarves, and gloves were gathered. The younger man’s eyes were wide, his mouth slightly agape. They kept walking until they reached a woman wearing a headset and dressed for the cold, which was appropriate considering the temperature was in the low thirties despite the abundant sunshine.
“You made it! I’m so happy you guys are here! Get in out of the cold. No reason for you all to be standing outside.” She moved aside to let them through, then closed the door. Arm extended, she encouraged them to give her their coats. “I’m just going to set these in the den. My wife Donna is in the kitchen putting the final preparations on dinner. She’ll be out to say hi soon. Cas and the kids are in the living room. Go on through!”
Now, Cas burst out laughing. He started walking again, Dean in step with him. “No, you’re safe. You’ll probably even get one of the cabins.”
That didn’t mean he wanted to embarrass himself and everyone else with his lack of skill when it came to vocals.
“Merry Christmas, angel.” Dean brushed his lips against Cas’, waiting till his love was more awake before kissing him properly. “I love the keyring. I forgot to say it last night. It’s awesome. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“I know. I ache for you, too.” He kissed the angel’s cheek and glanced down at their hard, leaking cocks. Initially, he had been going to reach into the glove compartment for the stash of lube he kept there for such an occasion. Seeing the rivulets of precum running down their cocks, the lube seemed unnecessary.
Cas brushed his lips against Dean’s before capturing his mouth, pouring as much adoration and gratitude into the kiss as possible.
He had taken her words to heart, perhaps too much. That was part of the reason why he had needed the time off. Dean had twisted her words into believing he would never find someone with whom to share his life. Now, he knew that wasn’t at all what she had meant. Lisa had told him as much after Sam had reached out to her during Dean’s dark period.
“Cas, that’s great!” Ellen congratulated him warmly. “You two are really sweet together. I thought so after you two stopped in yesterday. It was wonderful seeing how happy you are with each other. I love you both and know what you both have been through. I am rooting for you two. You deserve each other. I mean that.”
“Your brother has decided to think with his dick instead of his head. That’s all.” Bobby scowled. “Wants to play happy families with Cas and Jack instead of being a musician who has a band to think about.”
“You okay?” Cas wondered, planting a kiss on his boyfriend’s neck while hugging his waist from behind. He rested his head next to Dean’s. “Aside from you being tired.”
“Not long. Are you awake or going back to sleep?” He rubbed Dean’s back like he was an infant sleeping on his parent’s chest.
“Jody and her wife Donna Hanscum, who’s also the sheriff, are my best friends,” Cas explained to John, Mary, and Jess. “They host us every year and this year, as I’m sure Dean and Sam have told you, that also includes all of you.”
Not wanting to see the light go out in Dean’s eyes so soon after his arrival, Jody took charge of the conversation. “What do you say we go for a walk around the downtown? Give you boys a quick tour before depositing you at the White Spruce? Thought we could grab lunch at the hotel, if you’re hungry.”
He told his father he would call him back after talking to Cas. A few minutes later, Cas returned having secured the two sleighs following a pricey negotiation with the horse master Rufus involving a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black. The tension was palpable as he approached his friends, raising an eyebrow at Dean who turned to look at him when he drew near.
The quiet was beginning to unnerve him. Cas had left the Winchesters and Jessica at lunch almost an hour ago and the lack of communication from Dean ratcheted up his fear that everything had gone from pretty damn perfect to perfect disaster. He didn’t want to cause discord between Dean and his family yet couldn’t shake the feeling that he had. A dispirited sigh blew out of him as he sat at his desk inside his office at the lodge.
A second finger was added. The two digits grazed Dean’s gland while the stretching continued and loud wet moans poured out of him along with Cas’ name. He was pretty sure Dean wouldn’t last for long if he kept teasing his prostate like this. Dean confirmed it, begging him to take him.
“Don’t listen to them, you two,” Mary ordered. “Absence doesn’t make the heart grow fonder. It just makes it hurt. I miss my boys every day and they’ve been out of the house for almost as long as you’ve been here, Cas. There is no severing the cord between a parent and child. It is a bond like no other whether you gave birth to them or not.”
Sam was enjoying this scene immensely. It was extremely difficult for him to keep a straight face and he nearly choked on his own laughter, trying to keep it contained. Bobby shot him a look. He nearly combusted.
Dean took the other chair, leaning back into it. That didn’t feel right, so came forward and rested his forearms on his thighs.
The guttural moan that rolled out of his man went straight to Castiel’s half-hard cock. It was fortuitous his equipment still worked like a man’s. With his lover keening like he was, it wouldn’t take much more to make them both hard. Castiel’s tongue ran clockwise around the starburst, then counter-clockwise. Dean barely used words, but made his approval adamant.
At least, they were getting along and Sam felt as though he belonged. When his brother had returned from his self-imposed exile, he had a huge grin on his face. Sam had pulled him aside as Jack was back to help Cas butter the popcorn.
“Darling, I love you more than anything save for the snarky blonde in the living room. But if you don’t get the hell out of my kitchen,” Donna grabbed the carving knife sitting on the butcher block and pointed it at her wife, “I will kill you and they will never find you.”
Cas fell into a “getting to know you” discussion with John, Mary, and Ellen, which dovetailed into Christmas traditions and memories that had everyone at the table participating. Their howls of laughter greeted Dean, Sam, Jo, and Bobby when they finally arrived close to midnight.
Dean couldn’t believe his brother had gotten that right. Damn, Sammy really had been paying attention. He was unbelievably blessed (a word he didn’t use often for how disingenuous it had become thanks to social media, but it was appropriate here) to have had him on his side all these years. For a moment, he wondered if he had been as awesome an ally for Sam, but he suspected he had nothing to worry about.
Being in Dean’s arms and hearing him confirm how strong their bond was eased a fair amount of Cas’ fears, but the specter of John Winchester and his influence over his sons loomed large. He pulled back enough to see Dean without leaving his embrace.
Dean lifted a shoulder nonchalantly, picking a cookie off Cas’ plate and taking a bite. His green eyes grew large as he liked what he was eating.
His eyes were questioning and brow was furrowed. “I get that you're busy and I didn’t exactly endear myself to you yesterday when we got here, but have you been avoiding me? ‘Cause it feels like it.”
“I hear you and Dean hit off really well. Any chance you can get him to stick around on a permanent basis? Asking for a friend.” Jo nodded her head sideways at Ellen, who was standing next to her.
Indeed, it was. He realized upon reflection that Dean had placed it on the small of his back as soon as he stood next to him. It had been so natural, Cas hadn’t thought anything of it.
“It is. So get used to it. And tell me anything you want you to try. Actually, just tell me everything.”
“Wait. You hung the ornament without me?” The hurt look on Sam’s face reminded Dean of when they were kids and Dean had done something minus Sam that both had been interested in doing.
Dean bowed his head, placing one kiss on Cas’ shoulder and another on the pulse point of his neck. A small grin appeared when he heard a soft moan from his friend. He hated referring to Cas as a friend when he was so much more. Yet boyfriend wasn’t on the table right now. Don’t even mention the phrase
“You look calmer than you sounded in your texts earlier,” she observed. “Hey! What happened to you, by the way? Did you go back to sleep?”
“I don’t know. Maybe. I made a suggestion. Told him to think about it.” He shrugged. “May be nothing. Said I look at places —
Once Dean selected his, he frowned upon noticing his friend’s hands were empty. “You’re not participating? I thought we were doing this together.”
“Nothing. I just wanted to know if you were serious about wanting to relocate. If you changed your mind, that’s okay.”
Everything became crystal clear in that moment. There was nothing that could wreck them except their own insecurities and Cas wasn’t about to let that happen. He accepted Dean at his word because he spoke the truth. It was his turn to be just as honest.
Benny Lafitte was a burly bear of a man with a heart as big as him. They had met in his stomping grounds of New Orleans while Dean was getting a feel for the life of a musician while playing with a rock band he had befriended while working the bar circuit around Lawrence, Kansas, with Sam prior to the younger man heading to Stanford. Dean was with them for eighteen months and the education he received was better than any he would have attained at a four-year school in his opinion.
His mouth opened and closed a few times before words fell out. “Y-y-you think of me in a sexual way often?” Dean swallowed. “That’s so hot.”
“I want to get you the real you, as well, Dean. So ... about the tour and the tree. Would you want to spend tomorrow afternoon with me? I know your manager’s coming then. We can work around it if you need to be here to greet him.”
“It’s not that I’m not happy for you, Dean. I am. Truly. I know it’s not fair, but I’ve always felt that when you found your person you would leave the band. Nothing lasts forever, whatever. Yeah, I’m a dick. Made my peace with that a long time ago.”
Finally, Castiel couldn’t wait anymore. He snaked his tongue inside his lover, working it to the best of his limited ability. When it grazed something soft and fleshy, this got a bigger than normal reaction from Dean.
“Well, look at you.” Dean closed the gap between them. He was very impressed, not to mention turned on. “That might have been the sexiest thing I have ever heard. And even more so because it came from you.”
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” Dean declared. He stood up, shoving his phone in his coat pocket as he stood, his erection gone. “We are never leaving your sorry ass, old man. You’re stuck with us, you hear me?”
Nothing was said for an interminably tense few seconds until John smiled and pulled his son in for a huge hug. The two men embraced, not caring they were in the middle of the lobby where anyone could see them. Dean and John were close, as were Sam and Mary, but when it came down to it, the boys would gravitate to the opposite parent.
So, off they went in the Impala to Coldwater to find out what the hell was going on and to kill the nest before it was too late. Castiel sat in the backseat as was his want when not scouting ahead, while Dean drove and Sam rode shotgun. No one drove Baby but Dean unless he said so or there was an extreme circumstance. Baby was what he lovingly called his most prized possession. He and Baby had been through almost everything together. She became his when her original owner, the boys’ dad John, had handed over the keys. Next to a necklace Sam gave him one year for Christmas when they were kids, it was the best gift Dean had ever received.
The more time they had conversed, the more Cas had started seeing past the aesthetic to the man within. He saw someone with a quick wit who had a passion for his music and who took the time to get to know his fans a little before giving them the coveted autograph they had initially sought. Watching him with Jack had endeared Dean to Cas even more. Up close, Cas saw the musician’s green eyes light up when talking of the playlists Jack made or of Dean’s brother and father. They really were a lovely mossy color.
Christmas Eve saw them at The Barn. Located fifteen minutes from White Spruce Mountain Lodge, it was a huge old barn that had been converted into a theatre that held thirteen hundred people and had hosted some name acts in the past ten years. It was situated on the land where a farm with ties to Snow Falls’ founding family once was located. Fire had destroyed the farmhouse some fifteen years ago, but the barn had only received minimal damage. The structure had been expanded during the renovation to meet the town’s needs as a performing arts center that now served the entire tri-county region.
vibes Dean was sending out. “I’m serious. I’m no saint. We both know that. I’m also not looking a gift horse in the mouth, so, you know what? Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.”
It wasn’t Dean who responded, but Sam, irate that his father would condescend to his brother in such a fashion. “You spend thirty seconds with them and suddenly you think you know everything? What gives you the right to tear down their relationship and minimize their feelings?”
As the miles clicked over on the odometer, his thoughts drifted to how he felt about Castiel. This wasn’t the first time this had happened. Over the years they had known each other, from the first moment he saw him if he was being honest, Dean had felt a pull toward the tall, dark, and handsome angel with the gravelly voice not unlike his own (though not as deep).
Bobby continued staring at her for a moment longer. A smile inched its way across his lips. “I like you, madam mayor. Just had to get a sense of you.”
“I think I preferred the uncomfortable tension you cut with a knife,” Cas heard Dean tell Sam, to which his baby brother agreed.
Dean turned to look at his brother, lifting a corner of his mouth. “That baby is gonna be mine one day. Hell or high water, she’s mine.”
Still, she screamed in utter joy when she had been told Sam and Dean were on their way to Snow Falls yesterday morning. Her wife wasn’t happy at being woken up in such a fashion until she knew why. Then, she joined in Jody’s celebration.
“You did so much. You gave me a second chance after I acted like a complete nut job. You invited me into your home. Let me into your life. Jack’s life. You two made Sammy feel like he belonged tonight. That means so much to me.”
Having found the key to the handcuffs as it lay on the floor next to one of the minions, Sam tossed it to Dean and tore out in pursuit. Seconds later, Dean and Castiel split up after the angel assured his friend he was healed and good to go.
Dean laughed. “Okay, brat. Honestly, I feel blessed to have you. When you picked out the angel ornament for the festival tree, I thought,
As he caught his breath after they broke for air, he saw his boyfriend pull out a keyring from his pocket. It held two silver keys. Dean was confused for a moment until Cas explained.
“Damn right, I am checking you out, you sexy minx.” He took a screenshot of his dream home and its address, putting them in a special folder on his phone.
“You do know how to make me blush.” Dean stole a kiss before returning to the stage and the cheers of the crowd.
Now in the lobby of the lodge, his insecurities squelched, Dean’s heart was full as the people he loved most were here with him. He and Sam hugged everyone — with Jessica getting a very warm welcome from her boyfriend. John Winchester teased Dean if that was what they had to look forward to when they met Cas later. His dad laughed and his mom swooned at the blush that colored their oldest son’s cheeks.
The affectionate pet name had slipped out without him realizing till it was too late. Dean paused before responding and Cas froze out of fear he had taken things too far. Cas opened his mouth to say what, he didn’t know. Luckily, what Dean did next saved him from making an ass out of himself.
Before hanging up, Jody made him promise not to shut down his heart. “No one is good at putting themselves out there, Cas. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.”
Before he had gotten out of the car when Cas dropped him off at the lodge, Dean had asked him if he had any favorite Christmas carols. Never too late to switch up the set list, he had told him.
Overwhelmed with emotion, Dean pulled him into a bear hug, holding him tight until a knock on the door and Bobby’s voice told him it was ten minutes till show time. He pulled back, gazing intently into Cas’ eyes.
“Not to me.” Jody joined their discussion. “I think it’s cute and spot on. Though officially we call it a winter wonderland.”
Saying nothing, Cas walked over to the window. “Looks like Santa also delivered a white Christmas. There’s at least three inches out there.”
This was new. He liked it. The changes he had noticed from the off. Maybe it was how comfortable he felt with Dean. Maybe it was Dean’s nervousness when they had met again. Maybe his horrible experience with Bal had given him the kick in the ass he needed to take charge of his love life and become an active participant instead of a passive one. Chances were it was all the above.
His son was one hundred percent onboard for his dad’s relationship. As he had told Cas while they watched
Following him to the entrance, Sam and Bobby watched as the other pair greeted each other with an awkward handshake and nervous yet joyous smiles. Bobby studied Cas for a moment, waving pleasantly when Dean suddenly pointed at him. Undoubtedly explaining who the older man was with the salt-and-pepper hair, who looked as though he belonged on a fishing boat with Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss. As understanding filled Cas’ features, he waved back before returning his attention to Dean.
To his delight, his friend didn’t mind. For the next hour, Cas told him the story of him and Kelly. How they had met at Northwestern University their junior year when they opted to study abroad in Paris. They had bonded over their love of art and hung out a lot at the Louvre.
“I think you know how to handle your parents,” she retorted, head cocked so the front half of her sleek, asymmetrical blonde long bob hit her shoulder. “Just be on your guard, like Sam said. Be prepared for anything. Present your case as best you can. Don’t give them an opportunity to find a hole in your defense. One loose thread can unravel everything.”
Jack smiled. “I was lucky, too.” He glanced around the table. “We lost my mom, but Dad came through and gave me everything I needed. It’s going to suck when I leave for college in the fall. Though some would say the separation will do us good.”
“The mayor thinks it’s cute.” Dean loved seeing how annoyed his baby brother was at this development. To Jody, he added, “He’s such a Grinch.”
Laughter filled the room as it was common knowledge how much John Winchester cherished his reading time. He preferred thrillers and mysteries, but his true love was horror. The library in the family home was well curated as Mary read basically anything that struck her fancy. That said, she made sure a mix of classics across all genres, not to mention favorites of hers and her husband’s, were on the shelves.
“So don’t think for a second that I’m giving up my family if he can’t get onboard,” Dean continued. “You’ve made my life better, Cas. I’m not letting you go for anything. Besides, Sammy isn’t going anywhere. Not after the way he went to bat for you in there.”
She stretched out the pause between each word in that question, never taking her eyes off the man she had just been flirting with a second earlier. “I won’t have just anyone dating, Mr. Novak. He’s my dad. So you better be the shit.”
Dean hadn’t expected her to drop the formalities. She had seemed cool, but this nudged her more firmly in that camp. He rubbed his hands together in anticipation. “Okay, Jody. Show us Christmasland!” Leaning forward, he lowered his voice. “So, uh, how many Santas you got rockin’ up in this joint? And what are the odds of seeing some actual reindeer?”
Now, he took the time to look at what had been so sensitive to spark such an intense reaction when he had barely touched it. This was his first time seeing an anus. Contrary to its ugly name, it was rather beautiful. A pink starburst. Castiel began to understand why those people in erotic films had such an oral fixation when it came to the ass.
He bit his bottom lip. “Um, can I have your number? I was thinking I would just call your room if I were running late, but then it occurred to me calling you direct or texting might be better in case you’re not in.”
Always a team, no music was released without their approval. If one of them liked something and the other didn’t, it wasn’t happening. They had worked their asses off over the years with the support of their parents and Bobby. The boys had moved in with their manager, while they decided where to live during the early years. Luckily, Bobby had an old house with plenty of room. As time passed, he had become part of the family. Sam and Dean trusted him implicitly. He respected them and never abused that trust. There were a handful of other acts Bobby had on his roster that were mostly local, but the Winchesters were his priority.
“Buttermilk’s overrated anyway.” That blush deepened and the tip of Dean’s tongue darted out to run across his lower lip.
Sam and Dean Winchester had first got wind of it through their network of fellow hunters. The brothers had just finished cleaning up a haunting outside of Lander, Wyoming, when Sam’s phone rang. A few hours later, it was Dean’s phone. Then, some more calls with texts and emails mixed in over the next several days. When the angel Castiel suddenly showed up inside the bunker where the boys resided, he told them what he had been hearing on angel radio — what Dean called the chatter among the celestial that only Castiel was privy to due to his status. Castiel had heard the demons were in Coldwater.
“Not yet, but I’m hoping sometime today. She was waiting for the owner to get back to her. I got to see the place yesterday. It’s perfect.”
He swallowed hard. Suddenly, the inside of the Impala seemed warm. Too warm. To the point of it being suffocating.
“So, you had the downtown tour and you hung out at the venues,” Cas said slowly, making sure he understood. “Would you want to see the town proper? Also, you and Sam must add an ornament to the festival tree. Doesn’t sound like you did that either.”
Two things happened simultaneously to Dean when Cas spoke: first, he jumped a good two inches off the seat; and second, his insides melted like chocolate over an open flame. He let out a rather loud “
“Oh, yeah, that guy. Perhaps his luck has changed, after all. Or maybe Santa took pity on him and gave him his present early.
“A little tricky, but we were able to reschedule with the venue for mid-October. Don’t worry about it. It all worked out. Luckily, our stock has risen since the Christmas Eve show, so they were more than happy to accommodate us as it’s an acoustic set and we weren’t outright bailing.”
“Hey, Dean,” Jess called out, getting his attention. “Sam told me about the place in town you have your eye on. Have you heard from the Realtor?”
“The cottage on Primrose Path.” Cas took another sip of coffee though it was too hot. He saw the surprise on his friends’ faces. “It’s the only place to rent. Anything else he’d have to buy and I agree with his prudence. He’s taking the plunge, but giving himself an out if we don’t last.”
He was on his feet now. “You think Cas and I haven’t had the real conversations about making our relationship work? Like what it would mean to have a somewhat public figure with a nice nest egg incubating in the bank as a partner? You think we do nothing but stare at each other with heart eyes and fart rainbows and tell each other, ‘No, you’re pretty?’ Actually, we do that, too, but fuck you for thinking I’m not going into this with my eyes open. Correction, that
Which I only know of because she forced me to watch it with her when I moved here. I made sure I bought the trilogy on Blu-ray. Watch it every year in the spring. Jack loves those movies.”
The crowd began counting down from ten. When they reached one, there was a collective gasp as the tree illuminated the space with tens of thousands of twinkling white lights wrapped around the boughs within rows of ornaments selected by the townsfolk and visitors. A huge round of applause, along with a roar of approval from those in attendance, connected everyone in a way only moments like this could.
Sam shattered the tender scene with his commanding tone. His voice always dropped an octave-and-a-half lower when he took charge.
That compliment had taken Dean’s breath away. He had held Hot Dad’s gaze for a long moment before he regained his composure. The look of compassion and understanding in those blue eyes had made Dean wish he could ask him out.
your asses. Even he knows you two belong together. Hell, Bobby is rooting for you. Claire overheard him tell Ellen last night at Harvelle’s when they stopped in after their date. Ellen’s like you with the lodge. Can’t leave it too long out of fear it will fall apart without you.”
Instinctively, Dean’s hand went straight for where his angel’s cock should be and there it was, hard as a fucking rock. He pulled back to look at his love. “I want us to both get off tonight. I don’t want layers between us. I want you to be the only person I make love to in Baby from now on.”
“Pretty much,” he admitted. “But while others fade, you never left. So many times I wondered if just maybe I would run into you while I was here, which was insane because I didn’t even know where you lived other than four hours from Minneapolis.
“As if!” Jo scoffed, but it was obvious she wasn’t as averse to the idea as she would like everyone to believe.
“Anytime. I only make two a year since it’s so time consuming. Not convinced they’re works of art, but I’ll take the compliment.”
“The best! Amirite?!” Gabriel delivered Cas’ coffee, putting it down right in front of him. “Seriously, Dean’s parents are going to be asking when the wedding is come Christmas night. Before they catch the plane home on Sunday at the latest.”
Once again, Dean stopped. This time, Cas kept walking, slowing his pace so not to leave his friend too far behind. When Dean realized Cas was kidding, he barked a sarcastic laugh that split the other man’s face in half.
“Abso-fucking-lutely.” He dodged an attempt by Cas for another kiss, instead pressing his lips to the other man’s temple and whispering in his ear, “I’m already half hard and really want to go ice skating with my boyfriend, so maybe we save the celebration for when we’re home?”
“That is one descriptive sweater.” Cas couldn’t take his eyes off it. It was hideous … and hilarious. Chances were slim Dean would have his coat open once they were outside but, even if he did, most people would laugh.
Driving into the town of Snow Falls, South Dakota, on the afternoon of December fifteenth, Sam Winchester had the exact same look on his face he did the moment after he had taken down the school bully in sixth grade. He came to a stop at an intersection and took in the grandeur around him.
He moaned after taking that first bite, rolling his eyes up before closing them. Was he really that hungry or was this quite simply the best sandwich he ever had? When he complimented Cas on his creation, his friend shook his head, a rueful grin in place. Cas believed the former while Dean's own beliefs leaned more toward the person who had made it. Not to take away from the sandwich itself because it was damn good. Was that spicy mustard? And romaine with that tomato?
With nothing more than a wing and a prayer, Jody had tracked down the contact information for Bobby Singer after listening to a few early EPs and some of the Scrapyard Dogs’ more recent albums. Their latest had dropped at the end of October, which had only encouraged her because what music act would turn down good publicity? If their fans happened to come to Snow Falls to see their favorite band play, even better.
“That’s sweet, but it’s not what I want.” He leaned over brushing his lips against Dean’s, then kissing him softly. “I didn’t tell you about him so you could beat the crap out of him. I told you so you could understand why I may be shy and hesitant occasionally despite wanting you more than I’ve ever wanted anyone. I want to enjoy you, us, what we have. For however long we may have it.”
“How the hell did we not know about the sleigh rides?!” Dean lamented. “Dude, I have always wanted to go on a sleigh ride!”
Dean and Sam would bring in one of their bandmates who graciously had agreed to join them on this gig. The additional members consisted of Jo Harvelle on electric guitar (she stepped in for Sam on bass when Dean slipped behind the drums or hit the stage piano) and Charlie Bradbury on drums. Both women sang backing vocals.
Eventually, Cas got up to throw away the condom, returning with a damp washcloth to wipe down Dean after taking care of himself in the bathroom. Once clean, Dean pulled him into his arms with Cas laying his head on the other man’s chest.
“Agreed.” Cas returned the kiss with as much heat as Dean had put into his and it sent the blood straight to his cock. “So let’s rectify that, shall we?”
After Jack had gone up to his room last night, Cas and Dean had made out on the couch for another half hour before calling it. Cas had to be at the lodge early to greet guests arriving for the Winter Festival, plus he had a full day ahead of him to ensure he could attend the ceremony that evening with Jack. Dean didn’t have rehearsal with Sam until two o’clock, but he wanted to make sure he got a good night’s rest and time for a hot herbal tea to treat his vocal cords.
There wasn’t a time crunch now, but Dean knew they didn’t have all night. Cas had to be up early the next morning and he had an all-day rehearsal for the big Christmas Eve concert at The Barn, which would be held in forty-eight hours. He was nervous as hell about that one since it also would be live streaming on Snow Falls’ YouTube channel with all donations going to a homeless shelter in the area that focuses on LGBTQ+ youth who have been kicked out by their families.
It was over too soon, but what a finish. Dean came without being touched. His stomach was covered in his cum and some had even landed on Cas’ torso. Cas filled the condom, mildly concerned it might break. (It didn’t.) Their bodies were glistening with a layer of sweat. They were glowing from the connection they had made.
There was no missing the silent communication between the two, but it was over before Dean had time to question it.
With that line of reasoning, his head was now pointing out that it wasn’t like Dean would be coming here without a job. He wasn’t giving up Scrapyard Dogs and would likely be gone half the year between touring and recording and the like. That would allow them to take things slow and give them the space they needed while ensuring they would make up for lost time as soon as Dean came home. Plus, it wasn’t like he was moving in with Cas. Dean insisted on having his own place initially to make sure this was going to work, which was rather sensible.
“Your brother’s right. The last time you were this comfortable sharing details with us about the person you really liked was Lisa.”
The elder Winchester turned to his left and silently checked in with his brother. Ever since the night their mother Mary had been burned alive on the ceiling of baby Sam’s nursery and John had put him in charge of keeping Sam safe as they fled the house, which had been engulfed in flames, Dean always made sure his brother was good. It was his job. He may not always do it as well as he should, but he did his best.
“Yes, we would have.” The angel hadn’t a clue how that would have happened nor did he particularly care. Dean's sexual knowledge ran deep and Castiel had faith that if anyone could find a way to get him off it was this man.
They hit the ice, joining in with the other skaters as a soundtrack of Christmas tunes blared from the speakers set up around the perimeter of the pond. Jody and her wife Donna were out enjoying themselves when they spotted Dean and Cas. The foursome hung out, taking turns around the rink, and getting hot chocolate until it was time to call it a night.
Jack came over to say goodbye to Cas before heading out with Claire, who was talking with her mothers. The teen was surprised to hear his dad was dipping his toe into the bloody waters of horror films.
Santa Claus let out a jolly “Ho ho ho!” after lighting the tree, wishing one and all a merry Christmas. Cas was reminded why he loved the Winter Festival so much despite the onslaught of people attending in recent years. This sense of community and fellowship was rare in today’s world. When you found yourself immersed in it, it was the most precious thing one could experience. He wished he could share it with Dean only to realize he was. Perhaps it wasn’t in the way he would have wanted, but that didn’t make it any less special.
Glancing at his sleeping boyfriend, who was pressed against his side with a hand on his chest, Cas carefully reached for his phone. He needed to talk this out with someone outside their relationship and there were only two people who fit the bill. So, he opened the group text and sent up a flare.
Dean got him up to speed on what had occurred while he was gone. It was obvious to Cas that the brothers wanted to try to reconcile with their father and avoid a true estrangement. The smile that spread across Cas’ lips when his boyfriend agreed to attend made it easy for Dean to extend an olive branch of his own.
“Jack is always listening to music,” Hot Dad confessed. “He DJs our meals thanks to the wireless Bluetooth speaker we have at the house. I’m constantly getting playlists. It’s how he turned me on to you and your brother.”
“Where are your guests, Cas? For a bustling mountain lodge in a popular Christmas town, it seems pretty thin on the ground.”
To his horror, Bobby wore a similar smirk of his own when Dean turned his gaze back on him. It was the older Winchester’s turn to sigh, slump his shoulders, and roll his eyes.
“You think Mom is really against me moving here? And what the hell is with all the parental units getting all twitchy about me having a damn life? Do they really think you and I are going to live together for the rest of our lives?”
Cas’ heart sank as he watched Dean run from him like he had just seen a demon or worse, had been told the Wi-Fi was down. The lodge owner merely thought he was being friendly. He had said those words to thousands of customers over the years. Never had any of them reacted so oddly. It concerned him that he may have somehow offended Dean, when that was the last thing he wanted.
Once he had accepted this, Cas became content and moved on with his life. Everything remained status quo for years until Dean entered the picture. Now that he was here, Cas didn’t want him to leave and, it seemed, Dean felt the same. Still, he struggled with the expected questions: Was it too soon? Were they moving too fast? What was too fast when you had fallen for someone who felt the same?
His brother couldn’t disagree as their mother tended to fixate on Jess since she considered her the daughter she never had. Sam grinned.
“I really hope it’s the chocolate ganache cheesecake,” Donna interceded not so innocently. “That is to
Now, as they sat on Baby’s hood, so close their shoulders touched, Castiel had to admit it was a good suggestion. The lake was lovely as was the surrounding woods, which gave them a veil of privacy he appreciated considering he had a fair idea of what was still to come. Only once had he had sex with another person and he had been human at the time. Initially, he had thought she was a nice girl named April Kelly. In truth, she was a reaper who had seduced him to get information on Metatron, the scribe of God. Although, there was that intense kiss with a demon friend named Meg. Both were dead. Only one of those deaths filled him with sorrow.
How his son and Sam could eat buttery popcorn mixed with M&Ms was beyond Cas’ comprehension. It was a fun idea in small doses, but that much sweetness would wreak havoc on his digestive system. Wow, he was getting old. Though he took heart in Dean eyeing the other pair’s concoction with disapproval. Perhaps, he wasn’t alone. Or perhaps, Dean was thinking the popcorn would be better with the peanut butter M&Ms Cas had stashed away. As it turned out, it was the former.
While his brother antagonized the older man, Sam watched Bobby react to what Dean said. “I don’t think that’s it, Dean.” He thought for a moment. “Bobby … are you afraid we’re going to abandon you if the band ever breaks up?”
Sonofabitch. He had been set up by the freaking mayor. There were two hotels in town: the White Spruce and another one on the other side of town called, appropriately enough, the Snow Falls Inn. Dean had learned this when researching the town online. Jody had conveniently failed to mention there were two hotels and now he understood why.
He instantly felt a spark of jealousy, wondering who else had had this distinct pleasure. The second Cas’ tongue licked against his lips that flare was extinguished. That mouth belonged to him now and if Cas wanted entrance, Dean wouldn’t turn him away.
It was a nice offer, but Cas wasn’t going to hold Sam to it. He was serious about wanting to see one of his guitars. A Google search would probably give him that opportunity before Sam Winchester would and that was fine. Though he liked thinking he and Dean would be friends once Christmas was over and the musicians had left Snow Falls behind.
Cas had no idea what was going on, terrified at the idea he would have to sing in front of the entire town and then some. Jack was faring no better, but at least he seemed excited at the prospect. It had to be a group thing, Cas speculated. No way would Dean and Sam make them sing solos for a song he might not even know. Unless they were looking for a real showstopper in the worst possible sense.
“I get it. I do. But no more secrets. What we’re starting is going to be tricky enough with me on the road for months. These things start small yet have a way of snowballing.” He wrapped his fingers around his boyfriend’s nape. “I want you to tell me everything that rolls around inside that beautiful head of yours. Deal?”
“And when do I get to meet Cas?” Bobby’s precision never failed to impress Dean. He was a sniper, who as far as he knew had yet to miss a target.
He grinned when he heard Castiel laugh from the passenger side of the front seat. Quickly, he undid his belt buckle and removed his jeans along with his underwear.
There was movement to his left as the song ended. A moment later, John was before him. The older man wore an expression that seemed to Cas to be one of measured acceptance — not only of his and Dean’s relationship and of Cas’ place in Dean’s life, but of Cas himself. They silently exchanged looks that Cas interpreted as,
Damn did Dean love the confidence of that man. Oh, the things he would love to do to Cas in that sleigh.
He took Castiel’s hand in one of his and with his free hand gathered their cocks so both were in his grip. Then, Dean placed Castiel’s hand on top of his so their fingers touched. His angel looked on with interest, seemingly comprehending what they were about to do.
The rest of their time together had been spent making plans for John and Mary to take a sleigh ride after hearing from their sons and their partners how lovely it was. The gorgeous, snowy scenery had made for a romantic interlude that the younger couples had enjoyed immensely. Cas had arranged for the older couple to squeeze it in ahead of the concert. They had even taken Jack’s advice at lunch and booked the nature tour for Christmas afternoon.
trying. Your mother has been helpful in that and after today, she’s vowed to step up her duties” A glance at Mary had made it apparent he wished that were not the case. “That said, I’m sorry I overreacted to your news, Dean. But did you have to keep it from us?”
Next to him in the passenger seat, Dean had a similar expression, complete with the wide, toothy grin plastered on his face that his brother had failed to develop. He looked out the side window and moved to the windshield.
“However, I didn’t fall for the town until I saw it through one person’s eyes. Now, this person means a hell of a lot to me.” He looked down at the front row, easily finding Cas as he was with Jack, Jess, and John and Mary. Dean winked, grinning when Cas shook his head as the corners of his mouth lifted. “There was no question in my mind that I was going to dedicate a song to him tonight. I even knew the song.”
The warmest smile lit up Cas’ face. “I have no game. It’s been years and obviously I don’t know what I’m doing. I can’t remember the last time I made a new … friend.”
A rueful smile played on his lips. “Yes, ma’am. I’m confident Dean will have the cottage by Christmas.”
saw Mom and Dad, like, in person? July for the Independence Day concert in Lawrence? Damn. It hasn’t been that long for you and Jess, right?”
“How about we unwrap each other?” Dean followed suit, pleased that Cas was as turned on as him. He liked the feel of his nice, long cock. His fingers slipped inside the keyhole fly, skimming along a portion of Cas’ shaft.
“As impressive as Sam was defending you and your relationship, you would have been in awe of Dean,” Jessica revealed with pride. “He sang your praises and tore his dad a new one in the same breath.”
As they walked down Main Street, the smile on Dean’s face grew wider and brighter with every step. Downtown Snow Falls was decorated from one end to the other with every type of winter and Christmas decoration you could imagine. A few storefronts opted to highlight Kwanzaa, which impressed both him and Sam. They liked the town was inclusive when it came to the winter holidays. While Sam interrogated Jody on how Hanukkah was represented, Dean half-listened, too busy soaking up the magic of the season.
Nope. Nothing. Dean had no immediate reply to this. Damn this night was now full of the best surprises. As much as he and Castiel knew each other, they both were fonts of information tonight. His heart tightened upon hearing what his angel had to say. He didn’t know which to tackle first.
“Well, aren’t you a dark horse.” Grinning, Dean leaned in. “Maybe I’ll wear it to the show tomorrow night. Think anyone would notice?”
The first thing Cas saw when his eyes fluttered open was Dean staring at him adoringly with the most amazing smile. “Merry Christmas, baby.”
To his relief, the brothers had returned to the kitchen in good spirits a short time later, just as Cas had finished pouring the hot melted butter over the popcorn. Dean came straight over to him and had offered to carry in the bowls for the second half of the movie marathon. Jack and Sam had grabbed the sodas with Cas following them into the living room. Cas had sworn he saw something in Dean’s eyes that was gone just as quickly as it had appeared. He couldn’t figure out what it was and that had bothered him.
Now, Cas was sitting up, the bedding pooling around his waist hiding his sweatpants. The tee had ridden up around his midsection. Damn, did that image of Cas’ stomach peeking out wake up his cock. His mussed brown hair only added to the sexiness.
When his employees dispersed, there was a buzz in the air that hadn’t been there previously. It was excitement over the coming days and of Christmas, in general. Everyone in town loved the holiday. They loved how it brought people together and allowed goodwill to run rampant in a world that felt a little darker with each passing year. Each Christmas season renewed the town’s collective soul and made the eyes of every citizen shine brighter. It was magical. Just as Christmas should be.
Talk turned to Dean’s impressions of Snow Falls so far (highly positive). He was particularly impressed by the venues where Scrapyard Dogs would be playing. Each one had its charms and he liked how they grew in stature with each concert. The town square would be strictly acoustic and guitars only, which suited him and Sam just fine. At the park, the amphitheater allowed them to go electric, bringing in a drum kit and stage piano.
“One year when Jody — that’s Mayor Jody Mills — had to cancel Christmas dinner because she got the flu, Dad and I took the two-hour afternoon tour. Definitely recommend it.”
His eyes fell on the tattoo written in Enochian that Castiel had applied when he was human for a period to stop the angels from hunting him down after unwittingly participating in a spell that evicted the angels from Heaven and made them mortal. Castiel had gotten it not long before he lost his virginity. Dean delicately ran his fingers over the words located on the lower left of his boyfriend’s abdomen.
“I’m sure it will be fine, Mayor Mills,” Sam said. “Bobby’s already signed off on them, but I am anxious to see the places.”
“I’m sorry, Cas. I should have realized you might know them once we knew what we were dealing with. Were you, um, were you close?”
By then, Cas had already moved to town and was assistant manager, a position Kelly’s father had bestowed upon him after proving himself by working from the bottom up. Cas was there when Jack was born as Kelly deemed him her birth partner. He had been there for every moment of Jack’s life, including the big blows. The boy was too young to fully appreciate his grandparents’ deaths. His mother’s, he had grasped no holds barred. It had devastated him when he lost her ahead of his ninth birthday. From that moment, Jack called Cas “Dad” and the older man made sure he never lost that privilege.
“He remembered!” Jack shouted into his other ear. The surprise on his son’s face was precious and Cas was thrilled they were able to share this moment together.
“I know you’re busy, but I’m glad I got to see you before the show. Jack and I will go wherever we're supposed to go and get out of your hair.”
Sam turned wide eyed to Dean, who shrugged. Lifting a shoulder, Sam pulled a face that asked if they should. Dean cast his eyes over the large pool of people and back to his brother, before sliding over to Jo, who gave him a toothy grin in response. Another glance back at Sam confirmed he was game, which left one other person.
No way could the man he had dubbed Hot Dad be that good looking and that forgiving. Dean had made a complete and total ass of himself earlier. There was no denying it. To think he hadn’t botched any hope of at least a friendship with Cas blew his mind. And yet, here was this guy with an adorable grin on his face telling him that it wasn’t over yet.
” He slammed his hand against the steering wheel. A slow breath left him, allowing him a moment to collect himself. “Sam’s worried, too. You happy? We’re both worried about you.” The anger dissipated as quickly as it surged, replaced with naked fear. “Just come to me, Cas. Please. We’ll figure this out together. I need you so much.”
Eyes wet again, he silently beat himself up for being such a dick to them both. Dean knew he wasn’t the only one to have suffered from his ego. More times than he could count, he witnessed the light go out in Castiel’s eyes because of him. More times than he could count, he died a little when it did. He squeezed his lover’s knee again, this time a little harder. (This term made his heart skip a beat until his dying day.)
“We have enough precum to use, but if not, I have lube in the glove compartment. We’re covered. Promise.”
Dean’s instinct was to burst out laughing, but he wanted to know Cas believed him and understood what he was saying. That he was saying this wasn’t at all planned. The best moments never were and that gave Dean hope that this was possibly the beginning of something good. Something they both deserved.
He swallowed. This was it. His chance to show his parents why him moving to Snow Falls wasn’t the end of days, but the beginning of them. Dean glanced at John, whose features had softened considerably.
“Oh shit. Fuck. That’s it, Cas. Right there. Yes. Yes. Oh fucking hell, yes!” After these epithets, Dean took his lover’s name in vain for the rest of the act.
“Good for him! See? This is why you have nothing to worry about with Ma and Pa Winchester. They are going to see you two being all cutesy couple-y and know you are the perfect partner for their son.”
Sam had assured him it was nothing, but Cas had seen how taken aback the younger Winchester had been by his brother’s behavior. Perhaps Sam was used to it since he seemed to cover for Dean with relative ease. Still, when he had smiled, it didn’t reach his eyes. That also unsettled Cas.
When he returned, clad in his multicolored candy cane black boxer briefs, Cas was wearing only a pair of red plaid ones with a black waistband. They both took time to admire the other with Dean admitting he had a pair with facing Santas on each leg delivering a “really big present.” Cas closed the gap between them as Dean dropped his clothes on top of his overnight bag, which sat in front of the bureau.
That had been the turning point in salvaging John’s estimation of Cas — not to mention Christmas. He had admitted he had misjudged Cas based on no proof and he was embarrassed that Cas’ first impression of him was so wretched. The mood turned warmer as grudges were forgiven, though not forgotten. John also formally apologized to Sam and Jess for his behavior toward her and their relationship, promising to support whatever they decided regarding their future going forward. It wouldn’t be easy for him to keep his nose out of his sons’ affairs, but he would try for the sake of his family.
Sam’s smile was wide as the Missouri River. “She’ll be here on the twenty-fourth. Actually, she’s flying in with Mom and Dad.”
He stuck out his free hand to the girl as the other held his ornament for the tree. “Dean Winchester. Good to meet you, Claire.”
Jody smirked, confirming she had overheard her daughter’s comment. She appreciated that Cas hadn’t corrected Claire on the boyfriend part.
Sam sounded worried and that did not sit well with Dean. If his brother was concerned, it would only seep into his own bones and he didn’t have the wherewithal to deal with that. He needed to be fucking optimistic and Sam was harshing his rosy glow.
When he headed out that evening, it was after six. Jack had already texted to let him know the chicken breast was in the oven and that Cas could handle the side dishes as he had a poem to write for English class. Winter break started Friday, which was a blessing as Jack would be available to work some longer shifts during the week. His son would be paid accordingly, and be given the additional perks of attending the tree lighting ceremony and Scrapyard Dogs concerts.
The heat wasn’t suddenly turned way up. It wasn’t a lust-fueled make out session. Just as they had gotten to know each other through their stories earlier, their kisses were another way to connect. It was the most intimate either had been in a long while if Dean read between the lines correctly. Even if he hadn’t, he knew he wasn’t in a hurry for it to end.
The co-leaders of this band of renegades who had declared war on the brothers and Castiel appeared to lay out their plan. Villains always love to hear their own voices. These two were no exception. As they yammered on about their grand design (in short, they were going to kill the trio and take the bunker for their own nefarious deeds), Dean had begun working on picking the lock on the handcuffs. Sam saw what he was doing and flared his nostrils so Castiel would know they weren’t going to be here for long. The angel blinked once to inform his friend he got the message.
“I’m sorry to cut this short, but I have a phone call I’ve been expecting and need to take. Please, stay as long as you like. The dessert menu is fantastic as Dean and Sam can attest. I hope to see you at the concert tonight, if not sooner.”
For fun, the family would sing cover songs with everyone taking up an instrument. Sam and Dean started writing songs in high school and even played Dean’s senior prom as demanded by the senior class in such a fashion that it terrified the principal and vice principals. More gigs followed in their hometown of Lawrence, Kansas, until Sam had graduated and headed to Stanford University in California, where he had intended to study law. He never made it to law school, but did earn his bachelor’s degree.
“Right,” Dean confirmed. “I drove the first leg and Sammy took over today. It’s beautiful country out here. Don’t think I’ve really had the pleasure of spending much time in South Dakota outside of Sioux Falls.”
“My pleasure! Please, call me Jody. We’re going to be spending a fair amount of time together while you’re here. No need to be formal.”
Just as his tongue stuck out to wet his lips, Castiel got an idea. While adding another digit to the one he already was using and finger fucking his lover was a valid option, it wasn’t what the angel wanted. He needed to taste Dean, that sensation from before still fresh in his memory. So, he withdrew his finger and licked a strip directly over that pretty pink hole.
Castiel had never heard his name so much as he did for those precious minutes when he fucked Dean with his tongue, making sure to tease that spot until his lover fell apart. His hands had remained glued to his man’s ass almost from the beginning, but now one moved. He used the other hand to keep the ass cheeks parted as he reached under Dean, taking his testicles in his free hand. While Castiel squeezed, pulled, rolled them around in his hand, his lover’s body responded in all the right ways. They were right: reading
“It’s a big ol’ singalong with the boys taking the lead. So, you won’t ruin Christmas, honey. I think we all know my husband has that honor on lockdown.”
“God, I hope not.” Jessica took a sip of her iced tea as the brothers stared at her in surprise. “Oh please. We’re all thinking it. Just like I’m thinking of how my lease is up in the spring and I can finally move in with Sam.
She needed a replacement band and had no candidates. Everyone she reached out to either wasn’t interested in spending the holiday in South Dakota on such short notice or was too expensive. Usually, Jody was able to court potential musicians over an extended period, entice them with the small town charm and Christmas spirit, then hand over a candy cane once they signed on the dotted line. This tended to happen in the summer when she had time to finesse her sales pitch. Early November had disappeared quickly and at that point, she could see Thanksgiving looming in the near distance; that damn turkey getting larger with each passing day.
“Thank you. That sounded like a compliment.” Castiel’s words came out slow and deliberate. Could one be drunk on a person? He could smell the lingering remains of Dean’s aftershave, but more importantly, he could smell Dean. His hands started at the other man’s hips before they ran up and down his sides.
“This reminds me of a porno I watched recently,” he told Castiel, after he was greeted with a kiss despite Dean’s hands being full. “What do you say we make it a movie night?”
It wasn’t the only thing he was worried about truth be told. It had been two days since he had floated the idea of him finding a place here and Cas hadn’t said anything about it. Dean had promised he wouldn’t push him as it was a huge deal, especially for two people who had only spent roughly a week together. While any other time he would have balked at such a thought, it felt so damn natural when he had brought it up, like it was the next logical step in their relationship.
“What if your dad doesn’t come around? I won’t have you giving up your family for me. No matter how much it will kill me to let you go. They are too important to simply toss aside over a disagreement.”
“What do you do for fun if ugly Christmas sweaters aren’t your thing? And you can’t say music. That’s obvious.”
Outside the windshield, as the trees on either side rolled by, imaginary billboards showed what he could have if he gave a damn about being happy. Since birth, Dean knew he was straight. He slept with any beautiful woman who gave him a second glance and even went domestic once as a boyfriend and stepfather. It wasn’t until he set up house with his ex-girlfriend Lisa and her son Ben that it occurred to Dean how the carpet didn’t match the drapes so to speak. He enjoyed being a father figure to Ben and his relationship with Lisa had been solid. She was the only woman he had ever loved. Returning to her for a new beginning was his biggest regret if only for the havoc he had wrecked.
As Dean sat in his dressing room a half-hour before the concert waiting for Cas to arrive, he thought about the wild ride the afternoon had been. So much had happened since his parents came to town this morning, it was though it had been days instead of hours. He had whiplash from his father’s changes in attitude towards Cas. While thawed considerably, John still didn’t fully trust his son’s new relationship, though he had agreed to respect Dean’s decision regarding his choice of partner. It hurt, but ultimately Dean knew it had no impact as he and Cas trusted each other.
Seeing the lust on the other man’s face, Dean had nodded knowing Cas would understand. As soon as Dean took all of him, Cas had started thrusting. Fuck. He loved the way that cock hit the back of his mouth. Thank God, he didn’t have much of a gag reflex. No sooner had he thought that he choked, but was quick enough to adjust without having to stop. The sounds that had come from Cas had been magical and watching him dissolve before Dean while he literally had him by the balls (Dean gave them a squeeze and a tug, loving the effect they had on his lover) had been everything.
Cas’ blue eyes shimmered as he tried to keep his emotions under control. These brothers were making it damn difficult. He gazed back at Dean, who had shifted to his side with a hand on the small of his boyfriend’s back. “I won’t.”
“I know you guys were hoping to see Dean before the show,” Sam began, “but it’s really not a good idea. Don’t worry about the show. You’ll still have the best seats in the house.”
He also was aware of the pull family can have on a person. It was what had brought him to Snow Falls in the first place and what had kept him here since. Not that the town hadn’t worked its charm on him. Cas wouldn’t have stayed for so long if he hadn’t been genuinely happy with his situation. Jack had been his excuse for sticking around initially; not wanting to tear him away from the only home he had ever known. The White Spruce Mountain Lodge also was another component. It would have been rude to sell it so soon after inheriting it from Kelly. She had also factored into his reasoning until it dawned on him why he would stay.
Now, Jack was on a bus with his classmates to the town of Mitchell, where the afterparty would be held. He wouldn’t be home till tomorrow as he was spending the night at a friend’s house. This left Cas and Dean to have the rest of the evening to themselves.
“I can eat.” Dean patted his stomach over his navy blue parka, the bright sun not knocking the chill out of the air. The temperature was in the low-to-mid-thirties.
No sooner had Dean stepped into the room he was greeted by an older gentleman stepping out of the bedroom. “Where the hell have you been, boy? You have a lot of nerve leaving me alone with this idjit.”
“Haven’t I disrupted your time with them enough?” Cas squirmed under the severe look Dean gave him. “I’ll think about it and let you know after the show.”
True to his word, Dean sought out rental properties in town to find there was only one. There were four houses up for sale, but he didn’t want to spook Cas by getting something one hundred percent permanent though he did wonder if maybe he should at least look at one of them. Whatever he needed to prove to Cas that he was serious about putting down roots in Snow Falls. He had stopped by the real estate office just off Main Street when he had a few minutes on Monday before meeting Sam, Jo, and Bobby for rehearsal ahead of Tuesday’s concert in the park. Bobby normally attended rehearsals when he could, but with so much riding on Scrapyard Dogs’ tenure in town, there was no way he would miss even one this week.
She beamed at him, then changed the subject. “So what happens tomorrow? You said the festival ends tonight.”
“What are the odds that Dean will find out today or tomorrow that he got the place?” Jody asked, a smug grin playing on her lips.
Castiel had been put to a different set of standards than Sam. Dean could see that now. He had thought of the angel as a brother, told him he was family, but he never fantasized about Sam the way he did about Castiel. They were soul brothers. They were friends, but also more than friends. On nights when he wasn’t sleeping with a woman he had just met — which even he had to admit didn’t happen nearly as often as it used to; had been that way for awhile — but couldn’t succumb to slumber, Dean would slide his right hand underneath his boxers and think of Castiel.
Even now, Dean briefly closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and could imagine that warm, sweet scent that was unequivocally Castiel. A quick glance next to him and another check in the rearview mirror at the backseat showed he was alone. His bottom lip quivered. That was the problem. He didn’t want to be alone. Nor did he want Castiel to be gone for good. Tears welled in his eyes, threatening to fall. This wasn’t the first time he had gotten emotional over the idea of losing his friend.
It was just the tip of the iceberg, Dean was certain, and he wanted to know every possible detail. He wanted to share himself with Cas, too. As far as Dean was concerned, he was an open book. Yeah, some of it would be difficult to share, but he wanted to tell his friend everything. Thinking on the mysteries the night still held, he let out a calming breath.
Dean chose this moment to suck on a spot of Cas’ neck that he had declared belonged to him and it was an erogenous zone for Cas, so any cohesive thought flew away in an instant. Between the sucking, twisting, and pulling, he was a goner. His orgasm tore through his body and it was all he could do not to come screaming like he wanted.
That uncharitable view was tested a couple hours later as he watched Sam with Jack and Cas at the dinner table. Cas had cooked beef stew to knock out the chill brought on by the frigid air outside. It was one of the best recipes Dean had tasted outside of his mother’s kitchen. Seeing Sam’s eyes roll back in his head after that first bite told Dean his brother felt the same. He had three bowls while Sam stopped at two. Dean could see he was tempted to join him for a third, but he restrained himself.
“Okay, then.” He clearly had not been prepared to be given such a direct answer. The twitch of one side of his mouth showed he enjoyed it. “Look, I’m sorry I was such an ass. The last thing I want is for things to be weird between us.”
He leaned forward a little, letting Dean capture his mouth in the gentlest way. Cas kissed him back in a similar fashion, then again, with a bit more determination. His lips curled up when he heard his partner moan his approval.
A split-second later, she was dead at Castiel’s feet, the shadow of her wings burned into the floor.
.” Sam pointed at Dean. “He is the last person to latch onto someone and when he does? It’s pretty damn special. Dean doesn’t open up to just anyone. Hell, he usually pushes them away. Not you. My brother let you in like no other person aside from me. Even our parents don’t get all of him. But you, Cas? You will. It’s a rare gift. Don’t waste it.”
“Let me guess. You must be Miss Missouri.” He got up and extended his hand. “Nice to meet you at last, ma’am.”
“I worked it out with Sam and Bobby a few weeks ago, but I wanted to wait to surprise you. Jack knows. Made sure to check with him that he would want me tagging along on such a huge moment. I would have been cool had he wanted it to be the two of you. Plus, this allows Sammy to take a much needed vacation somewhere tropical with Jess.”
For Dean, it was in the living room on the first floor where his opponent found him. The violent assault had him flying through the bay windows and onto the grass outside. He was pretty banged up by now. It made fighting that much harder, but he persevered. In the end, he was able to stab the demon-killing knife he carried through the shoulder blades of his assailant. He had just caught his breath when Sam came through the front door.
Words failed Dean, who felt a warmth in his heart at his angel’s obtuseness which he found adorable. Instead, he captured his lover’s mouth, deepening it because he needed his fix. Apparently, so did Castiel, which spread the heat to Dean’s cock.
“It’s okay, Cas. Really.” Dean leaned forward, clasping the other man’s wrist with his free hand. “We’re just getting to know each other. Not gonna lie, it was unexpected. But I was more surprised by learning you're not Jack’s bio dad. You two are so freaking similar.”
With that, Missouri glided away and caught up with a middle-aged man and a young woman, who Dean later learned was Missouri’s son and granddaughter. Thinking of how jealous he was that Sam had gotten to meet Missouri first, Dean couldn’t deny that his own introduction was a unique experience. Dean and Cas watched them for a few seconds before getting to their feet.
He brushed his lips over Dean’s, then claimed that mouth as his own. Again, he pressed Dean’s body against his with one hand on the small of his back and the other between his shoulder blades to ensure Dean didn’t try to escape. Cas licked his way inside and Dean submitted happily. There was a hunger there that hadn’t been allowed to be unleashed earlier. It was as though once they had admitted their feelings, they had given themselves permission to give into them.
Thankfully, a trumpet flare sounded signaling the tree lighting ceremony was about to begin. Cas said a silent prayer while smiling at his friends and putting his arm around his son’s shoulders. He was grateful for their support, and loved that Ellen and Jo thought of Dean and Sam as family. It gave him more confidence in his growing feelings for the older Winchester brother.
He didn’t even think before speaking. It just came out. A quick glance at Dean showed he wasn’t put off by his comment. If he was, he was hiding it well. Somehow, though, Cas didn’t think the latter was true in this case. The grin Dean wore and the affectionate way he was looking at him made him think what they had may survive beyond Christmas.
“Flagstaff” was the B track off the latest single for the new album, their eighth, which had just been released last month. Dean had written it two years ago following his breakup with his longtime girlfriend, but the boys had never released it till now because it was way too personal for Dean. Sam barely had to set up a defense of the song to get his brother to agree now was the time to send it out into the world as Dean was finally in a good enough place to see its potential. “Barroom Brawl” was their third most popular song off the second album, and the one Dean and Sam had the most fun writing.
Removing his fingers, he coated his sheathed cock with a plentiful helping of lube. Then, he lined himself and carefully pushed himself inside. A series of low moans came from deep within him the further he went, pausing to give Dean time to adjust, until he bottomed out.
“Oh, you’re fucking hysterical.” Dean’s words were drenched in sarcasm though his eyes showed he wasn’t nearly as offended as his tone declared. He thought it was funny.
“Thank you.” He stared at the keys as his heart tightened. “This means so much. You’ll obviously have your own set to my place as soon as I get mine.”
A wince scrunched up Dean’s features when he heard how groggy his brother sounded. Kid must have passed out the second his head hit the pillow.
Their trepidation was understandable considering how horribly their last meal together went. However this time, he knew there was nothing to fear.
Scrapyard Dogs continued to be the scrappy band with critical favor and devoted fans they always were, but now had a few more promoters and bigger name musical acts interested in working with them. With the little extra clout, Dean and Sam were able to set their tour schedule more to their liking, allowing them more time to spend with their families when not in the studio.
Cas didn’t know where this sudden confidence and flirtatious nature were coming from. Seeing Dean’s green eyes brighten at his reply only encouraged him to keep it up. Even if whatever happened only lasted a week, it was better than forever wondering
“He does.” Cas nodded. “I told him when he was twelve. He had a family tree to do for school and was asking a lot of questions. He had been asking a little before then, so it wasn’t unexpected. It just seemed to be the best time to tackle it. Jack took it well enough once the tears and anger subsided. The topic’s never been raised since.”
“I can’t believe they’ll all be here soon,” Sam had marveled as they hung out in his suite after Dean returned from Cas’ house. “I know we’ve been talking about it all week — hell, all month — but now that it’s finally time, I feel like we’re getting our Christmas gifts early, you know?”
“Cas! Jack!” Ellen called out, waving at them to come over once she had their attention. Her long brown hair dipping into the lowered hood of her coat.
“You’re quite bossy,” Castiel shot back. He tweaked one of Dean’s nipples before he obeyed, earning a moan. The way Dean arched his back was quite satisfactory.
This yanked Dean out of his reverie, but it wasn’t what was said that had gotten his attention as it was utter garbage. It was who said it.
“That’s a nice story, Dean.” John finally spoke. His patronizing tone had everyone tensing, preparing for the onslaught. “It is. I don’t doubt you care for Cas very much. I just wish I believed he felt the same for you.”
He unmuted the television, getting pulled into a scene in the Dagobah System with Luke Skywalker, R2D2, and Yoda. This pissed Dean off even more than he already was. Dropping his overnight bag, he stormed over to the sofa, yanked the remote from his brother’s hands, and turned off the television. All he wanted for tonight was to have fun with the people who meant a lot to him. Like hell Sam was going to piss all over that.
“I’m tired of not waking up with you next to me. The past two nights have been horrible and the mornings weren’t any better.”
Cas smiled bashfully. “Right. No one has ever called me hot. Not to my face, anyway. I would normally just wave off such a nickname, not believing I’m worthy of it. This time, I won’t. I’ll just say … thank you.
Aware of the prostate’s existence, Castiel had never considered he would interact with it so soon after entering the sexual part of their relationship. This was the promised land for male-on-male fornication. He knew not to screw this up.
Thinking once more of Castiel made that warm feeling start low inside Dean, caused his heart to skip a beat, forced a tightness in his crotch. While Lisa was the only one of the myriad women Dean had bedded to ignite a similar physical reaction, it still paled in comparison to the Technicolor, Dolby Surround experience he was living right now.
Pride surged through him knowing his son had received early acceptance into his first choice for college. Jack had been wanting to go to Columbia University in New York City since the eighth grade with Northwestern, and Princeton also on his wish list.
“Now, I know you have your eye on that adorable cottage over on Primrose Path. From what I hear, it’s all but yours. Just need that bullheaded owner to give his approval already.” She noticed the worry that crossed his features. “Don’t you worry, sweet pea. He’s just meticulous about who gets to stay in his house. You’ll have those keys soon. Don’t you agree, Cas?”
“Lucky us.” He had flashed Hot Dad a nervous smile and let out a flustered chuckle. “So, what’s your favorite song … Dad?”
had been his mother’s reply when as a teenager he once asked how that was possible. It had comforted him then as well as now.
“You guys are something else. If I hadn’t known you were brothers before now, that little exchange would have confirmed it.
