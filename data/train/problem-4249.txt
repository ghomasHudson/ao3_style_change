Staring at his phone he mentally strikes another person from his steadily decreasing guest list.
Dean has not voiced much of an opinion as of yet, so Cas is anxious for his response.
The words stopped Dean dead in his tracks and he turned around to stare at Cas with utter disbelief.
"I saw Bess and Garth kissing in the hallway right before I picked you up," he finally states and Cas' confusion must be mirrored on his face, because Dean helplessly shrugs with one shoulder.
All Cas can do is blink owlishly at the man in front of him. He had been so preoccupied with feeling betrayed and alone that he hadn't even considered the possibility of Dean stopping by without Charlie.
They are not something that just lies around in a high school if it's unrelated to class and yet here he is, staring at pages covered in neat black letters.
“Don’t ever believe expressing yourself is a weakness.”
He does not dare to use the term friends just yet, but Dean's next words make him believe there's hope for that.
The focus he let slip for just a second on the battlefield is back.
He nods under her expectant look and tries to let the tension drain from his shoulders. It's not even a real Christmas party just a meet-up for Charlie to announce her annual holiday game, but somehow that makes the whole thing even weirder. No matter what Charlie says, it still doesn't feel right for him to be here. He's neither working full nor half-time and helping out here and there does not make him part of the tight-knit working family Charlie built up. However it would be even more awkward to leave now, especially since his best friend is making her way through the small crowd of her employees towards the counter. She climbs up on it without hesitation and beams at the people gathered around her.
Maybe Dean has felt the same way all along and everything is about to fall into place.
A tiny voice in his head whispers.
Tick. Tock.
Or maybe he will, enough to be embarrassed about it.
The whole action lasts less than a minute, but Cas is exhausted like he just ran a marathon. He's heart is racing and his arms hurt so much, it takes him two tries to open the window over the sink.
Of course Charlie, meddler extraordinaire, chimes in before Dean can get that far.
Not talking about pop culture or anything like that ... I don't know if you remember, but I was never any good at that."
He buried his nose in the crook of Cas' neck and Cas could feel Dean smile against his skin as he whispered: "How did you know?"
"Dinner can wait," he says, "let's have dessert first."
Smiling again, Cas leaned down to wrap Charlie in a hug.
Dean is still thinking about it when he returns to Cas, who is drooling on the couch by now.
People on the couch.
"This is not what I am usually like," Dean tried to assure as he stumbled backwards through the room.
Dean shifts the car into drive and the engine roars to life.
"I am so sorry, Dean. I didn't realize how much this meant to you. You don't have to do this. I can be Cas's Santa and he'll never know what happened."
Besides I only know what I want, because I didn't have unwanted opinions forced upon me every step I took. You've always gotten input from everybody around you. They all seemed to have tons of ideas about what you should do with your life. It's no wonder you struggle finding your own voice, when you have a choir of other people's thoughts drowning it out."
One second of inattentiveness can cost your life.
This is even more embarrassing than he thought it would be and Cas hasn't even said anything yet.
"I nearly proposed then and there."
Dean is about to add something, but luckily the bell announces another customer so he is spared from making a fool of himself.
That’s harsh, isn’t it?
"Wait, let me get this out first: There is a lot you don't know about him and it is most certainly not my story to tell, but he's been through a lot of shit, so he does not take conflict very well."
He's been looking forward to it all month and even though both Balthazar and Meg cancelled on him shortly after he texted them about his plans.
Do you see me?
Weird. It's not like he's expecting anyone (anymore) and since his apartment is on the fifth floor of a building that is mainly inhabited by childless couples or singles like himself, there aren't usually any kids going trick or treating.
Charlie gave him a look that told him she did not believe a word he was saying. He was saved by a young woman holding the door open for the two of them on her way out of the shop.
As if sensing Cas' inner turmoil, Dean hugged him even tighter.
She slid on the bench across from him and narrowed her eyes.
His lips are moving and it’s clear he's trying to communicate with Cas, but the music and noise around them keeps getting louder and Cas cannot understand a word he's saying.
for your smile
"How about you?" Dean asks and this time he really is addressing Cas.
It's like he was made to love Dean Winchester and his heart refuses to stop.
Dean knows they didn't do it on purpose. Balthazar and Meg probably overestimated Cas's drinking abilities, since their own are quite impressive.
"I'm gonna get you some water, alright?" Dean says. "Don't go anywhere."
And I am not as weird as I'm behaving today.
He won't have to think about how much time has passed between touches, won't have to ask for how long he can allow himself to linger in Cas' arms when they hug.
Not that this is a date.
An unreadable expression flickers over Dean’s face for just a second, before he schools his expression into a crooked smile.
“Cas,” he whispers, “can I kiss you?”
Knows that whenever Dean reaches for his hand or squeezes his shoulder or kisses his forehead or buries his face in the crook of Cas' neck, it is him saying "I love you" in whatever way he can.
"Take a seat, I'll be right back," Cas said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of his couch as he walked through the living room, heading straight for the kitchen.
The harder he fights, the more he remembers.
"What's the urgency about?," he asks as he grabs his bag from under his desk and walks up to where is friend is waiting for him with one foot already out the door.
She turns around one last time to point an accusatory finger at him.
Squaring his shoulders he exits the room and carefully blocks out his feelings until he is behind the wheel and on the open road.
Had he not been so keen on stressing that Cas should "dress up", Cas would never in a million years gone for what he ended up wearing.
The world is a blurry whirl of brown and grey.
If Dean really is the owner of the notebook, Cas could offer to help him talk to his crush.
He doesn't know how they end up hidden in the trenches.
Dean takes a steadying breath and before he can talk himself out of it hands the wrapped casket to Cas.
"Is everything okay?," Dean asks, tightening his grip around Cas.
"Since I’m busy tonight, how about you take my ticket and go the movies with Cas?”, she asks innocently and Cas chokes on his own spit.
"This is safe. This is home," he thinks, smiling against Dean's skin.
Looking back, he can't imagine what must have gone through Dean's mind.
He looks down at the living room table which is practically spilling over with food and hopes Dean's hungry. He knows Charlie can put away a ridiculous amount of sweet considering her size, but even then he probably has enough candy to last him for weeks.
He clears his throat - he seems to be doing that a lot around Dean- before he adds:
Stepping into the late afternoon sun after a day spent in the office always has a sense of liberation to it.
Charlie next to him just rolls her eyes and fixes her elf hat with a grin that is entirely too pleased for his liking.
Tries to let new memories erase the old ones and yet he finds himself scratching on the sore edges of his almost healed injury, ripping off the scab.
Like he is incapable of understanding that the itchiness and discomfort mean he's finally getting better.
"This man is mine," he thinks, "This amazing man is my husband."
Things could not possibly go that well, not after the kind of shitshow his life had been before.
Cas picks the notebook up carefully, letting his fingers run over its surface.
Cas looks down at Dean's hand that are still running up and down his arms and smiles.
Dean slowly exhales through his nose and lets his head fall back. He's looking up at the sky where tiny little snowflakes begin making their way down to him.
His voice is trembling, his hands are trembling, his whole body is.
"Hello Dean."
Dean laughs.
It is meant as a joke, but instead of sarcastic he sounds dead serious and Balthazar laughs so hard, Castiel can hear his rips aching.
Dean's eyes widen and the stream of words stops.
"Stay,"he replies softly.
"It's alright,"Cas says and wonders how many times he will say these words and how often he has said them already over the last year.
Somehow, they have managed to hoard a fuckton of booze and candy, and Dean has never been as thankful for his friends as he is now.
Dean rolls his eyes.
But maybe Dean doesn't want to know.
He's pretty sure Cas won't move anytime soon, but he'd rather not risk it. Walking to the kitchen which has already emptied quite a bit, he realizes that he has to figure out a way to get Castiel home.
It feels like he's carrying someone's beating vulnerable heart in his hands.
"It's nothing you said, Cas," Dean assures and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of Cas' shoulders.
Cas hates him a little bit but more than that he pities him.
It's not a choice he makes.
At first, Cas can only shake his head. This is so much worse than everything he imagined and he feels terrible, even though there is no way he could have known.
Another text message. He expects it to be a reply from Garth but instead it's Anna telling him she has to cover the night shift, because her co-worker did not show up. She profusely apologizes even though it's not her fault and Cas is quick to assure her of that, but it stings nonetheless.
Cas knows this.
He lets his eyes search the crowd and takes a swig of his beer.
He rubs his sweaty palms on his jeans.
The man smiles warmly.
"You had no right to make that decision for me."
He feels the press of lips to his forehead and a feeling of absolute security washes over him.
Here he is, wounded and bleeding, yet safer than he'll ever be in the arms of a man who won't stop fighting.
He is nobody to Dean and Dean should be nobody to him.
"That rhymed."
His tears are running down Cas' cheek and they taste like salt water and make Cas think of the ocean he was floating in, just moments ago.
He had been right.
"Listen," she leans in closely and while Cas would usually appreciate the illusion of privacy, the body heat she's radiating, is almost too much for him.
This feels good, he decides.
"That's a reason to not show up there! I will become a fumbling mess the moment he looks at me and I am actually scared for what happens if he tries to talk to me," Dean tries his best to look as miserable as possible, but unfortunately for him, Charlie is immune to his puppy dog eyes and drags him further along.
All this time Dean doesn't say a word and when Cas drops his gaze to check if the man is still beside him, he finds Dean watching him with a soft look on his face and a warmth in his eyes that has his face heating up.
A loud noise distracts him and his stomach drops to somewhere around his knees when he sees that Charlie is calling him.
"It's just ... You seem to know exactly what you want to do with your life. You know your path like its already been paved, just waiting to be tread on. And here I am and I got nothing. I have no clue where I am headed, not even the hint of a direction. I have all these choices and I am incapable of making one and god, maybe that means I don't deserve them."
He turns around and reaches for a cup when another thing comes to mind.
"So," he asks, trying to finally move on to stable conversation ground that leaves no room for the weird in-between-silences they constantly stumble upon.
"Getting comfortable?", Cas asked, carrying two giant mugs. He handed one to Dean as he took a seat next to him.
"That," he started slowly, "is correct."
Cas has never wanted to meet someone more.
He has no idea what Dean usually eats, but he bought so much food that it's damn near impossible that he won't like at least some of it.
He cannot manage.
"Dean, Cas loves you. Cas, Dean loves you. Now talk."
And yet, he is still not closer to finding him.
"Is it alright if I take a moment to decide?," he asks as if Dean is going to kick out a paying customer.
He pointed an accusatory finger, frowning at the answering eye roll.
It’s why they work so well.
He looks at Charlie for help, but his friend's focus is on Dean.
He stabs his pointer finger into Dean’s chest and watches him nervously licking his lips.
He should decline.
Charlie nodded, not seeming surprised. Then her face lit up and Cas could actually see the metaphorical light bulb going on above her head.
"What happened?," he asks gently and pain flashes across Cas' face.
He watches his own blood run over the calloused hands he loves so much.
He doesn't sound like Dean.
"Not much, ya know," he says. "Trying to figure out what I want. Internships here, some unsalaried work there. Can't really leave town with Mom and Sammy here, but I'll figure something out. College seems kinda off the table right now, but I'm sure there's something out there for me."
Dean smiles all the way home.
Normally Cas likes his job - or at least doesn't hate it -, but spending nine hours in a room with broken air conditioning is not exactly his idea of fun, especially not on one of the hottest days of the year.
"Dean!"
Dean meets Cas' gaze with pleading eyes and the tears he fought so hard to hold back are freely running down his cheeks now.
His eyes -now emotionless and empty- meet Cas' again and when he speaks his voice is hollow.
This whole situation that's been forced upon him, how insignificant it may be in reality, feels like a huge weight on his chest.
And Dean had been fine to admire him from afar whenever he was given the chance, but now interaction has been forced upon him and there is no way he isn't gonna screw this up somehow.
Unexpected, because it wasn't Cas who said it, even though he had felt that way for a long time.
Cas meets his eyes with the same striking openness he always does and Dean feels a rush of affection for his dorky best friend who speaks like a textbook and takes everything too seriously, but is honest and kind and understands him in a way no one else does.
Castiel rolls his eyes at the innuendo.
"This is a bad idea," Dean grits out for what sure is not the first time today.
He is wearing a tan trench coat that looks old and well-worn and can't possibly keep him warm at this time of the year, but the suit he wears underneath it speaks volumes about the kind of money he must have in his bank account, because the way it fits his body is way too flattering for it not to be tailored.
"Oh man, I'm glad you showed up," Dean confesses and wipes his eyes,
Of all the things he expected to find, poems never even crossed his mind.
And when did the distance between them become so small?
would you turn around
That’s probably another reason on the endless list of why they have not really spoken to each other.
"But do you want presents?," Cas asked, voice soft in the way he knew would get Dean to turn around and face him.
He is not going to be ashamed.
He takes another step forward, bringing them closer still, bridging the distance until there is almost no space between them anymore.
It is April Fools' Day.
He can't help but wonder if this is how it ends.
"I figured it was unfair to deprive you of my company."
"I'm sorry for going off on you like that, I guess I can be a little overprotective sometimes," she says and the shadow that crosses her face makes Cas wonder what she's thinking about.
Or maybe it's full of little drawings someone made in a particularly boring class.
She shrugs nonchalantly.
"You wanna know what happened, Sam?," Dean grits out and he feels a wave of anger rolling over him.
"I want to be with you, Cas. I want the entire world to know that  I am yours and you are mine. I want it so badly and yet here I am, paralyzed by the mere thought of embracing you in public for too long."
Lost in thoughts, he nearly jumped out of his skin when an arm was slung over his shoulder.
"Cas!," Dean is loud and panicked and his whole body is shaking, but he doesn't stop his attempts to staunch the blood.
"Well …," he mumbles sheepishly, "I might have set the kitchen on fire trying to make dinner."
Cas is still behind him, so Dean folds the paper and puts it in his pocket.
"Her name is Kara, we've been texting back and forth almost every day, I think she might be the love of my life and today," she says with another dramatic exhale, spreading her arms wide as they leave the office building and step onto the parking lot, "is the day of days. Tonight we're finally going out."
It smells fresh and clean, and Dean takes in a deep breath. For a moment he allows himself to close his eyes and just enjoy the healing feeling that this time of the year holds to him.
Forcing himself to crack one eye open, he stared at his neighbors bewildered face.
The smile that graced Dean's face when he opened the door and saw his friends waiting for him put the sun to shame in its brightness and Cas nearly teared up when Dean threw himself into his arms.
"You weren't gonna bail, were you?," asks Castiel and maybe Dean is intoxicated by their proximity, but he sounds a little disappointed.
Dean looks at him, eyes wide with shock, but Cas meets his gaze unwaveringly.
“Do you want to come in?”
In hindsight he should probably have realized he was doing something to Dean.
But not only on alcohol, but on adrenaline and endorphins.
Dean is calm and collected and does his job without fault every time.
Strong arms wrap around him to keep him from falling flat on his face and when he looks up his gaze is captivated by warm blue eyes that seem to stare directly into his soul.
They have talked to each other exactly twice (and one time does not count as a conversation).
"What do you mean?," he is proud, when his voice doesn't falter even though he already feels like crying. He does not really want to know the answer to that question, but it will kill him to bare the uncertainty for only one moment longer..
"He might not act like it, but your behavior hurt him and it brought some stuff back up he has fought very hard to overcome and I will not let him go through it again."
He moves in front of Dean without doubt or hesitation.
And there is pain.
He rubs his palms together and his eyes dart from the ugly grey carpet to the weird abstract painting that hangs next to where Cas is standing, before looking down the hallway and it's then Cas realizes how much this has bothered Dean.
To his surprise, he does not feel any of the explosive anger Castiel and Sam were afraid of. All he feels his shame and humiliation.
Sam was wrong.
Digging the heels of his palm into his eyes, he lets out another sigh.
"You don't just like me, you love me," Dean smirks.
"Oh my god guys!," she squeals, "I might not know how to get that thing running, but I totally know someone who does."
The grateful smile in her direction kept him from answering Charlie's question, and he walked directly towards their usual table just to defer the interrogation he knew was about to follow.
"You're actually not the first one."
The silence between them is stretching out and Dean looks up again if only to make sure the man is still there.
Her grin is back in place and Cas has never been so happy about being teased.
For just a second Cas finds himself distracted by the muscles working in his jaw.
He wants to tell Dean that it's fine. That it's alright. That everything is going to be alright, but he doesn't know how.
When the last customer finally leaves, Dean looks around in the newly emptied shop and his eyes settle on the man.
"See you," is all he says, before he's behind Baby's wheel and on his way.
Dean shakes his head, but Cas goes on, before he can object.
Maybe his insecurities weren't so far off after all.
They used to be just like that.
He's about to return to the couch having decided on eating and moping as his activities for the night when the door bell rings.
Fumbling for his keys, he made it inside and tried to recall his apartment number through the fog of alcohol clouding his brain. It was on the 4th floor that much he was sure of, but other than that his brain came up empty.
A million emotions flash through Dean's eyes, passing too quickly for Cas to identify.
Dean is stoic. He is harsh most of the time and sometimes he is cruel.
Cas nods gratefully and they share a smile of wordless understanding, before both focussing on the road ahead of them as music fills the silence between them.
There are a bunch of people he knows, might even call friends, but all of them seem pretty occupied.
At least the movies are a safe choice.
It seems like it's going to be just Charlie, Dean and him now.
"When will they send someone over to fix this?," he groans, leaning back in his chair.
"I don't even know what point I'm trying to make here," she sighs, "I just thought you'd get along - still do actually - and no matter how much I think about it, I just can't come up with a single reason why you wouldn't even give him a chance," she shrugs helplessly, but when Cas opens his mouth to explain himself, to apologize, to tell her what was actually going on -as embarrassing as it is for him-, she simply holds up a hand.
The silence stretches out between them, heavy and wrong, only broken by Dean’s sharp inhales.
As much as he appreciates her teasing and her support, he still has not spoken to the man whose forgiveness he seeks and even though he wants nothing more than to explain himself, he has no idea how to do that.
"Get off me you moron, I don't want to make you sick as well," she says, playfully shoving his face away and because Dean is obnoxious like that he turns his face and licks at her palm to make her squeal. He's successful and Charlie rubs her hand on his leg to rid it of his saliva.
This was impossible.
It's not like it matters now whether he applies her customer policy now or not, since he probably made the guy so uncomfortable that he's never coming back to the coffee shop ever again.
His attention is directed towards something he's reaching for in the mud.
Maybe he missed his window. Maybe he ruined his one and only shot at this by being a fumbling mess.
Minutes ago.
“And don’t ever doubt your worth. You are human, Dean. You are flawed. But the very things you despise yourself for are what makes you invaluable.”
There are screams and gunshots filling the air and the world around him smells like fire and smoke.
"Dean," he says again, more sternly this time and the other man finally meets his gaze.
Do you have any idea how much this hurts? I believed him, Sammy. My brain didn't even register that this was some stupid prank or an easy letdown or whatever the hell you two intended it to be and I spilled my guts to him. I told him everything and for two short minutes I was happy. So if you figured I needed a reminder that I am not fucking good enough for Cas, then congratulations. Message received."
"I was wondering if we could talk."
"I'll call you tomorrow."
"Come on, Cas," he kneels beside the other boy and carefully shakes his shoulder, "hey buddy, wake up!"
"I want that, too! I want to walk you to your locker, I want to hold your hand in class, I want to kiss you by the bleachers and I can't."
"You're welcome," he says.
Because apparently it's impossible for Dean Winchester to just say "Have a seat" today.
"But please try to be nicer this time."
The first "I love you" came unexpected.
He tries.
"Bet you forgot about that when you and Sam came up with your genius plan. Because I do love you. Even if I can't show it, much less talk about it and I guess I really wanted to believe you. Whatever, I'll be fine."
He behaves like it's his first day on the job considering how many stupid mistakes he already made and he prays that the man won't want to consume his food here, because Dean seriously needs some time to turn himself back into a functioning human being.
Or are you just here for the view?
Cas looks at him. Their eyes lock.
This is his chance to prove to himself that he is no longer the shy kid from highschool.
It takes all the strength he has to grit out the words and Castiel wonders how long he will last.
"In fact this," he gestures at his own face and the sadness of its features, "should not be your concern and I'm sorry it came up to ruin your night."
“And?,” Dean asks after what feels like ages, a self-deprecating smile playing on his lips, “how pathetic do you think I am?”
"Quit whining, it's gonna be so much fun! Besides, Castiel is going to be there so that's just one more reason for you to show up," she shoots him a knowing glance and Dean feels the heat rising to his cheeks.
A nod and smile is all Cas needs.
However, before he can scrape up the courage to actually go over to him again, the bell over the door announces the arrival of a group of college students who flood the coffee shop and seem way to eager to buy toothrottingly sweet coffee and pastries. Dean prepares their orders in lightning speed, but more and more people are coming in and he doesn't even have a second to catch his breath. The rush that was both dreaded and anticipated has finally arrived and he knows that once it's over, the shop will be empty and deserted again, so he might find time to call Sam and at least wish him a merry Christmas over the phone.
Cas grits his teeth and wishes to be under water again.
He drops his hands and looks at Cas again to make sure his friend knows he means every word of his apology.
It does not help that Charlie's stories -which often feature Dean- paint the picture of a funny, open-minded and caring man.
His voice is both hopeful and apologetic and this time, Dean stops dead in his tracks, allowing Cas to catch up to him.
At least his Batman costume is badass.
"I knew you were one of the good ones," she says which is, once again, not at all what Cas expected, "But I'm not gonna lie, you had me kinda worried. For a moment I really thought my gut was letting me down. The whole situation makes
"You ready to go?"
"Yeah about that …," Charlie plays with her fingers, looking up sheepishly at her best friend,
The world is a blurry whirl of brown and grey.
"There is something I wanted to talk to you about," she says earnestly and he automatically sits up a little straighter, sensing where the conversation is headed.
She simply smiles at his question.
"Sorry, man. We can go back inside if you're too cold, I just thought it would be nice to actually hear a word the other's saying."
Just an empty desk in the classroom.
How do they appear to bystanders, Dean asks himself.
"Dean," Cas says and he sounds hurt which breaks Dean's heart all over again.
So Cas focuses on his math problems instead of giving in to his curiosity.
Luckily, Charlie interrupts his thoughts as she bursts into the room again, phone raised in victory.
He risks a glance at Dean, who looks unbothered (and beyond gorgeous in the retreating afternoon sun, as his brain unhelpfully supplies) and prays the two friends won’t start fighting over this.
He is about to take a step forward, when Charlie rushes past him and throws herself into Dean's arms.
If there someone sitting behind him in class who desperately wants him to turn around.
His heart aches a little at the thought of Dean with someone else, but he’s more than willing to ignore that in favor of possibly becoming friends with Dean.
It wouldn't hurt so much if he knew Dean felt the same.
"I let my guard down. I didn't think. I just ... I just ..."
This other boy, Cas decides, is the only way to find the poet.
She shakes her head and a mix of pity and amusement shines in her eyes.
He knows it when the noise of the battle dies down, leaving only silence and static.
The final minutes of the year are quickly passing by, but Cas doesn't mind the fact that he's spending them out here beneath the sky instead of inside where the party continues to rage on.
It's all Balthazar's fault really.
His head is spinning and his breathing goes too fast.
Then he realizes what Cas just said.
"It's okay, Cas. You couldn't have know," Charlie reassures him, "Don't beat yourself up for something you had no control over. Dean's like a big brother to me and I've known him for way too long, so I sometimes forget the effect he has on people. I should've warned you, knowing that he was gonna tick all your boxes."
He wants to say something, but his mind comes up empty, so he presses a kiss to the top of Dean's head instead and leaves his nose buried in the light brown strands.
"Thanks Cas," Dean's eyes are shining, but with gratitude rather than tears and Cas takes pride in being the one enabling that change. “I’m really glad we met today.”
Maybe not right away, because Cas had invited all of Dean's closest friends, in front of whom he would not cause a scene.
"Cas?"
But after.
Cas is so engrossed in studying the hardwood floor beneath his feet that he doesn’t hear the approaching footsteps, until someone comes to a halt beside him.
Even in his intoxicated state, this was beyond embarrassing and he already knew that come sobriety he would never be able to look his neighbor in the eyes again.
Dean is practically vibrating with excitement and jealousy worms its way into Cas' heart at the thought of Dean going out on a double date with Charlie and Kara and some faceless girl or guy on his arm, who laughs at his jokes and manages to make intelligent conversation instead of being a stuttering, stumbling mess.
Charlie’s bright and bubbly nature is the perfect contrast to Cas’ own sometimes closed-off behavior.
Dean is trying to stop the blood flow. His hands are on Cas' back and chest and Cas knows it's happening, because he sees the events unfold from his half-seated position against the wall of the moat, but he doesn't feel.
"Let's get you home."
There will have to be talking.
, he thinks bitterly, remembering the way his body betrayed him.
"So uh, you really wanna do this?
Charlie presses both hands on her heart and lets herself fall against the mirrored elevator wall.
Then again, why would Cas talk to him about that kind of thing?
"Don't worry about it," Cas interrupts what must be the hundredths apology of a very upset Dean on the phone. He knows that Dean is not happy about having to work on Christmas Day, but dutiful as he is, he stepped up when a coworker called in sick.
"Believe me, if I could fix that thing I would."
"I still need to apologize"
Then again, Cas is the one who is literally lying on Dean, the one who is still touching his face.
His thoughts are interrupted by two fists slamming on his desk.
It's not the first time is peculiar behavior and mannerism has made somebody uncomfortable. It happens quite often that he accidentally irritates someone though usually not on this scale. To see the immense repercussions of his behavior is disheartening, because it shows him just how out of touch he can be with the rest of the world.
"I'm sure, Cas has better things to do on a Friday night than to hang out with the guy who's just been stood up by his best friend,"
His actions clinical and professional.
It is 10am on Christmas Day and Dean has already been on his feet for three hours.
Dean Winchester is standing only a few feet away and Cas immediately drops his gaze to the ground.
Cas blinks at the words in shock, reading them over once more.
Maybe he should just head to bed and get this day over with.
With burning cheeks, he lets the notebook slip into his bag and pretends to focus on his schoolwork.
The “I love you” sits on the top of his tongue but it would be too much, too soon and Dean already looks like a deer caught in headlights.
"He has never actually seen Star Wars, so this would be the perfect introduction and since you two get along now, this is an amazing opportunity to get to know each other."
He must have somehow fucked things up, but not for the reason he thought.
Back in the kitchen, he numbly takes in the chaos before shuffling towards the sink, filling the bucket with water and dumping cleanser into it.
Dean's eyes fly open and he stumbles back, out of Cas' reach, the happiness washed away by waves of hurt and betrayal.
Then the bullets hit Castiel.
He's about to start looking for Charlie to say his goodbyes when he sees Cas on the couch, clearly having crossed the line from tipsy to full on drunk.
When he answers, his voice is small and Cas' heart breaks again for an entirely different reason.
The adrenaline high had begun to wear off and tiredness sneaked into his steps as he shuffled through the apartment towards his room.
There's a short moment of silence between them which is unsettling because it never happens when they talk.
"No worries. I'll have a cup of coffee, please."
His cheeks are burning with embarrassment and shame and he keeps his eyes lowered, unable to look at Charlie, not wanting to see her reaction.
The little boy is gone and Cas doubts he'll ever see him again.
He can see Meg and Balthazar, dressed as Joker and Harley Quinn - in that order - knocking back shots, and next to them sits Castiel, who already looks a little out of it, even though there are only two empty beer bottles in front of him and he isn't participating in their game.
Dean gives Castiel his best smile, but the man's shoulders sag and he shakes his head.
This is it.
He knows, he can’t have Dean, but he does not need to.
Dean sounded genuinely irritated, yet somehow Cas could not refrain from pushing.
Cas stops Dean by grabbing his wrist, before he can walk away from him.
"Cas," he breathes out in surprise and a blush creeps up his face as he hastily stumbles to his feet.
How they can forget about it so easily.
Dean can't say which brother was more disappointed when he called Sam to break the news to him that they won't see each other today, but the voice in the back of his head telling him how John was never there for Christmas either, did nothing to ease the pain of being apart for the first time ever on Christmas Eve.
He blinks numbly as the realization crashes over him.
Of course, Dean did not mean him. Why would he?
It's a running gag between the two of them that goes way back to Castiel's first day at the office. He had just moved -  3000 miles away from his home town - and the nerves about his new job had kept him up all night. He had been so worried about getting along with his colleagues, being able to handle his workload and meeting the expectations of his boss that he had less than three hours of sleep that night.
When Dean finally looks up, there are tears shimmering in his eyes and his voice is breaking, but he continues nonetheless.
"Something's bothering you," she declared matter-of-factly, and Cas didn't know if he should be grateful for or annoyed by her intuition.
No way.
And there it is: The moment of embarrassment that comes by itself every time he is in the proximity of the enigma that is Castiel.
Tick. Tock.
Dean finally gets a hold of himself and they share a smile.
He's wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans and the simple combination should not be as attractive as it is.
Dean has never heard him share anything close to a wish.
"God, I am so stupid, " he lets his hands drop to his sides again, shooting a crooked grin in Cas' direction whose expression has become unreadable,
It's a message from Garth:
Everything he knows about Dean is either completely superficial or second-hand information from Charlie, yet he wants nothing more than to be close to him.
His phone rings and for a moment he considers ignoring the call until he sees it's Sam, because if there is one person he can talk to about this mess, it is his pain in the ass, too smart for his own good little brother.
Cas' voice was low and still rough from sleep and even though it was entirely inappropriate given the situation, Dean found himself liking the commanding tone a little too much.
Which is the only reason why he agreed to go to Balthazar's party.
Uncertainty forgotten, Cas gets up, walks towards Dean.
Her disappointment has turned to anger and her tone is a mix of fascinated and pissed off.
It is not the strong jawline or the man's pink lips that are slightly chapped from the cold, even though his gaze lingers on them longer than it should.
"Would've been awkward if you didn't."
"You don't have to leave."
Dean's chuckle lets Cas know he does remember.
Leaning against the hood of a gorgeous black car, he always looks like a model from the cover of a magazine: Impossibly handsome and impossible to look away from.
"I'm fine," he says and after a second adds solemnly," but our kitchen might never fully recover."
"Same for you, Harvelle," Dean says and sits down on the other side of the table.
"I mean when you did …," she raises an eyebrow, "did that mean …"
Dean says, rubbing the back of his neck, eyes darting to Cas and then quickly to the side.
"You're something else, you know that?"
It is a glimpse into the soul of another boy and he treats it as such.
Because of course Cas does not feel the same way.
Cas blinks, clearly not getting who Dean is talking about.
Without Charlie as buffer, Cas has to be the one who carries - or at least actively participates in - the conversation which (as he has impressively proven over the course of every interaction he ever had with Dean) is quite the obstacle.
The soldier's minute.
Flinching away from the noise, Cas looks up, staring into panicked emerald eyes.
And so they walk. Cas leans heavily against Dean's side and stumbles over his own feet multiple times, but somehow they make it to the front porch of Cas's house.
Dean walked to the party, and even if he had a car, he wouldn't be fit to drive despite having sobered up a lot.
"Talk?," Dean asks incredulously, "You made it perfectly clear last time that you've got nothing to say to me."
For a while Cas thought he did.
“It’s mainly because we’re both terribly single and can’t afford to pass up on the chance to get some,” Charlie chimes in.
Not a drop of sweat is visible anywhere on her body, no hair is out of place and her face doesn't even show the slightest hint of a blush.
Unfortunately not because he is excited for presents or because he is on his way to visit family for Christmas, but for the simple and annoying fact that he's at work.
Cas reaches out a hand, hovering above Dean's shoulder before he lets it drop into his lap again like he is uncertain if Dean will allow his touch.
Somehow he stills finds himself shaking his head.
They have spoken a total a 45 words this year - not that Cas is counting - and still Cas has been able to make an absolute fool of himself.
He spots Garth and his girlfriend Bess - dressed in matching werewolf costumes - and sees Jesse and Cesar who can't seem to take their eyes off of each other.
Another sigh escapes his lips and he runs his hands through his hair as he contemplates what to do.
"Well, that was easy," he says, pretending to dust off his hands.
The mischievous glint in her eyes makes him regret his decision immediately.
Maybe, just maybe, things are going to be easy for once.
He thinks about lingering and trying to talk to the stranger for a little bit, but then again the guy probably isn't up for smalltalk with some random barista who has acted nothing but weird in his presence.
So he just sits there, stiff as a board, willing his fingers to resist the urge of brushing away a strand of hair that is clinging to Cas's forehead.
He nudges Cas playfully to show him, he's only teasing, and then Cas smiles back, and his eyes light up, and why does this feel like an accomplishment?
"Everybody I invited cancelled over the last few hours, so I was not expecting anybody to show up," Cas says, gesturing towards his sweatpants.
Dean thought Cas wouldn't remember him.
"Switching to the hard stuff, aren't we?," Dean asks and wow, he's officially the annoying waiter who comments on people's orders now.
"Alright, see you later."
"On April Fools' Day," is the last thing Dean can he hear him mutter, before he hangs up.
Cas can't hear him, can't hear anything, but he knows what Dean's saying.
For a while Charlie says nothing.
"It's amazing how much she achieved."
He's always worried that no one will come and now that it's actually happening, it feels even worse than he could've imagined.
“Where did you get this?”, he asks, voice barely more than a whisper, one hand reaching for the book. Cas notices the slight tremor in his fingers before they tightly close around the leather.
"Cas said 'I love you' just like you told him to, but unfortunately for the both of you, your perfect plan didn't work, 'cause I didn't get the joke.
Sometimes the things that make him remember are everything but small: two boys racing each other before doubling over in laughter who take him back to a time when he was their age, trying to catch up to a boy who always seemed just out of reach; two lovers holding hands, walking as closely as possible like even what little distance is between them is too wide and almost unbearable.
He doesn't know anything.
Nevertheless, he randomly grabs one of the many candy bowls from the coffee table and shuffles towards the door.
And Cas realizes he doesn't have to tell Dean, because Dean knows.
It feels important.
Goddammit. What is wrong with him today?!
Not when he got flowers and laughter.
“I did,” Cas answers truthfully and Dean staggers back as if he punched him.
Halloween parties.
"why would they leave?"
And I knew that, all of that before being allowed that glimpse into your soul, just from seeing you interact with everyone around you.”
"Yeah, alright, you certainly had more than enough tonight," Dean deflects while heaving Cas into a sitting position. He opens the water bottle and hands it to Cas, who takes it into both hands and chugs half of it in one go. Normally, Dean would tell him to take it easy, but he's just thankful that he doesn't have to fight Cas on this one.
"It's got nothing to with you, Cas. I just don't like my birthday, is all. None of my other friends know either. Sam is the only person who lives to tell the tale, so don't worry about it, okay?"
To his surprise, Dean just laughs. The sound turns Cas' insides to goo and makes him feel warm all over.
Chewing on his bottom lip, Cas contemplates whether or not to turn the page over.
Even though Cas is the one who just revealed the feelings he'd kept secret for years, Dean asks the question like he can't believe Castiel would agree.
"I can't believe I get to have this," he whispers, "I can't believe you feel the same way."
"I know, " Cas said, "believe me, I know, but I have to do something. He deserves something nice, something that's just for him. I don't think he's ever really had that. Last week I brought him flowers and his eyes watered so quickly I thought he was having an allergic reaction. Turns out he's never received a gift, just because."
Because he does his best, always, even if it isn't enough.
Oh God, there is pain.
This is why he hates hosting.
“Hate to disappoint but my wardrobe is always this salacious,” he says dryly, pleases when Dean throws his head back and laughs.
It's his minute running up.
Cas was scared to outright reject him, because he thought Dean would throw a tantrum like a toddler who hears the word "No" for the first time.
A small hand on his cheek brings him back to reality. Charlie is looking at him with a worried look.
“Never mind, it doesn’t matter,” Dean cuts him off before Cas can utter an explanation.
He does not know how to strike up a conversation and Cas is so stoic and silent that it feels inadequate to start a conversation about something meaningless or shallow. He only realizes he's fidgeting with his hands when Castiel puts his own on top of Dean's, reversing the situtation from before. There is an easy smile on his face, completly different from what Dean has seen of him so far and he can feel the corners of his lips turn up at the sight of it.
"Once he's done with work, he is going to head over to us," Charlie looks at her phone again, "which should be in about thirty minutes."
Maybe Cas thought confessing his love to Dean on April Fools' Day would make him realize how ridiculous an idea it was to entertain the thought of them being together.
No note.
But it's hard sometimes, being the only one who knows and he can't read Dean this time, doesn't know what upset him and why he's even more closed off than usual and it scares Cas more than he likes to admit.
He has said the words himself more often then he would've liked.
It makes Cas wonder about his own life.
"Thanks Cas."
Unexpected, because they weren't doing anything in particular.
That's manageable.
He was supposed to spend the day with Sam and his new girlfriend, but he got stuck with a double shift instead, because everybody had already called dibs on holiday or was miraculously sick this morning, so he won't be back in his shitty apartment until after closing time and by then it's gonna be to late to get to Palo Alto, even in a flying death trap he's forced to use if he wants to visit his little brother nowadays.
"Dude," he grins when he looks down at his own watch, "it's half past twelve already. Ellen's gonna kill you!"
Steadily sipping from his drink, he continues his journey through the giant house.
A boy with bright blue eyes, dark tousled hair and a kind heart.
The plan was terrible.
He sincerely hopes Cas lives within walking distance.
It is a second too long.
"He's going to love it," Charlie said, sensing his panic and running a hand up and down his back in a soothing motion.
The one where his laugh lines deepen and his gums are showing and his nose scrunches up.
"Coming right up," Dean answers and then -because his brain has clearly gone on vacation without him- finds himself asking:
"Fine," he said, reluctantly letting go, "I'll drop it. For now."
His smile is wide, and he looks happier and more at ease than Dean has ever seen him, and if his slightly red cheeks are any indication, his friends have gotten him at least a little drunk.
He considered turning the light on, but decided he was too tired to make that effort and instead began pulling his shirt off.
"Oh yes, of course", the man gives Dean a sheepish smile and it is so unexpected and adorable that Dean nearly melts on the spot.
Especially today.
"Technically it's still my counter, Winchester."
Tonight he was infinite.
"That's not true," Charlie angrily whispers back and steps further into the store as if to prove her point, "I like my coworkers!"
Ready to run as soon as he was out of Castiel's sight, Dean turned around to start the humiliating walk back to his own apartment.
"I love you," Cas says and his smile is blinding and infectious and Dean can feel his own face light up as he takes a step forward to embrace his best friend.
Jo is dressed as Black Canary and gives him an approving grin.
This is one big joke and he fell for it like the lovesick idiot he is.
Dean shifts uncomfortably, not meeting Cas' eyes.
His gun is trained on Dean.
"Gilda is here," she finally says and the happiness that sneaks its way into her voice at the mention of her long-distance girlfriend makes Cas smile as well.
"Hey!" she exclaims, trying to swat his hands away, but she's a little unsteady on her feet, so her success is limited to Ash rolling his eyes.
Then he looks Dean straight in the eye with a startling intensity.
If things go on like that, he can consider himself lucky, if he manages to not spill the hot tea water all over himself.
It's the smile that made Dean realize he loved him almost a decade ago.
Somehow, knowing that he is not the only one feeling nervous, helps Cas calm down a little.
Only when he reaches into his backpack, does it catch his eye.
"A few weeks ago, Dean and I went to check out the new bakery - the one that opened right next to the library? - it's lovely. The whole place feels really homey. I think you would like it there. We have to go sometime!"
Everything that happens within this one minute and only this minute is yours.
Whether it's by supplying food or offering to listen or whatever.
"Not because it was inappropriate or anything," he backpedals quickly, inwardly cursing his choice of words.
He clung to the handrail as he tried to make his way upstairs, but had to pause multiple times to catch his breath and because the ground beneath him was shifting.
He could call a cab for Cas, but that's damn expensive, and he doesn't have any money on him.
"Sure am," she declares, smiling so wide, it must hurt her face., "and it's totally gonna be worth it! This girl is special, I can feel it."
Dean Winchester stands in front of him, looking entirely too adorable for a grown man.
Over the month they had worked together, Castiel had proven to be not only kind, but also intelligent, witty and surprisingly funny, even if that was often unintentionally.
"Well, I'm glad," Cas whispers overcoming what little distance is left between them,
"You're not messing with me, are you?"
"I love you, too," he says and if possible Cas smiles even wider.
But that’s impossible, he sits in the back row in all of his classes except for literature and the person who sits behind him is Dean Winchester - a boy who is so far out of Cas’ league that it’s a miracle they breathe the same air.
The weight on his shoulders that had been there for an eternity was gone and he felt light.
He does not say anything else, simply hopes that Dean's attention will turn back to Charlie, before Cas can make a fool of himself again.
The way he says it makes it sound like Castiel had planned on participating in either dangerous or sexual activities tonight rather than dreaming of still being holed up in his room, eating unhealthy amounts of crisps and popcorn while watching reruns of his favorite movies.
just once?
"Nicer?, " he asks confused, not entirely sure he's heard her correctly.
person, but I really really need some alone-time with her now."
After all, that’s all Cas could ever be to him.
His fingers twitch and for a second it looks like he is reaching out to take Cas' hand, but then he lets his hands fall to the side and turns around without saying a word, his face already hardening again.
When Dean looks up at Cas's eyes again, their noses are almost touching.
One day he will stop missing Dean Winchester, the boy who crashed into his life, wearing a leather jacket that was at least three sizes too big and a stupidely wide smile that could brighten a room or cloud a sky with its absence.
A smile spreads across Dean's face when he sees Cas coming towards him and he spreads his arms just in time before Cas crashes into him and buries his face in the crook of his neck.
Cas spends the next few days asking himself one question over and over again:
One day, Cas tells himself.
Tick. Tock.
"You're drunk," he says instead and Cas pouts.
He interrupted his own rambling again and looked at the ceiling.
"Cas, you know you've become a good friend to me," Charlie begins and he hears the but coming before she even finishes speaking.
His phones buzzes again.
"For the last time Cas, I'm not telling you!"
"Thanks Cas, you're the best," comes Dean's tinny voice through the speaker and Cas rolls his eyes.
“Don’t ever think of your feelings as pathetic,” Cas orders. Dean will probably never talk to him again after this - too weirded out to even be in the same room as Cas - but he needs to get his point across.
He’s just glad Charlie interrupted the moments before his thoughts could translate into actions.
"Yeah, yeah," Dean grumbled, but leaned down to meet Cas' lips.
Smooth as crunchy peanut butter, you're doing great Cas.
He's not the type to develop feelings. In fact, he's never had a crush other than on Dr.Sexy and after years of one night stands, he had been convinced he was broken.
"Cas?", he stuttered perplexed, "What are you doing here?"
"That's the point. I was never going to say a fucking word about it and you've forced me to give him a 'present from the heart', really? Did you set this whole thing up just for me to have a heart broken by a man way too good for me?!"
And yet, he cannot stop himself from reading.
Jesus, when exactly did Halloween become couple's season?
"It's alright, Dean. It's alright. The medics will be here soon. I'm going to be alright."
Times passes slowly and as predicted only a few people come in, but the man remains at his table and looks out the window and watches the by-passers.
Not with him at least.
The lightheadedness he felt, had nothing to do with his intoxicated state.
The minute is up.
The music is loud and absolutely terrible and Dean wonders for what must be the hundredth time this evening why on earth he let Charlie talk him into this.
Feverishly searching his brain for an excuse to remove himself from the situation, he completely misses the grin spreading on Dean's face.
As if she heard his thoughts, Charlie strolls over and leans against his desk.
It's Cas' favorite type of weather and he closes his eyes and enjoys the breeze ruffling his already unruly hair. Moments like this should last forever, but he knows it's just the calm before the storm and that the two of them should probably head home before it starts raining.
Dean's arms wrap around him in a protective hug and Cas feels the tension melt from his body.
"I'm your Secret Santa," he says, busying himself with watching Cas's fingers carefully unpack his present, so he doesn't have to look him in the eye.
Not like she needs one, she’s quite happy filling him on everything without any kind of response.
Dean turns around to the nameless man, who sits in his booth with a crestfallen look on his face.
She pauses, then she abruptly leans forward and pokes a finger into Cas' chest.
"Stupid things. Silly hopes of a teenager harboring his first crush."
Changing into them, makes him feel better already.
What keeps him firmly in place is the realization that to leave the room, he has to get past Dean and he's not yet ready to come face to face with the man.
"I'll get out of your hair now. Have fun. Sorry again for bothering you."
Seeing his only chance of redemption slip away, Cas gets up and follows after him into the long corridor that leads up to the elevator.
"Just a few houses down the street", Cas replies, and Dean breathes out a sigh of relief.
They have been friends for almost a decade Cas realizes and his heart aches at the thought of losing Dean.
Tears are streaming down his face and words are falling from his lips like rain.
Just to look for clues about its owner, he tells himself.
Dean probably thinks he’s even more of a douchebag than after the stellar impression he made during their first meeting.
“I’m sorry,” Cas adds, because he doesn’t know what else to say.
"See you in school," Cas says, and it sounds like a promise.
But now is not the time for self-pity, he has to clear this up.
His hands are shaking and he twists them together in his lap.
The sadness in Cas' eyes is gone. Instead they are shining with wordless gratitude and maybe that's how Cas works. Maybe in all the time he had been talking to Dean all this time Dean thought he was silent. The thought makes him smile even wider and he nods his head once, letting Cas know that he understands and that there is no need for words. They sit there for a while, simply getting lost in each other's eyes and when Cas finally speaks, his tone is teasing and his smile turns into a mischievous grin, Dean knows that somehow things will work out just fine.
That he would ever get this lucky.
"I'll have a cup of peppermint tea and whatever pastry you recommend,"
The small journal looks old with its broken spine and stained leather cover that is soft underneath Cas’ fingertips, worn from use.
He runs his hands through his hair, before he buries his face in them.
He's chewing on his pen, rhythmically tapping his fingers on the wooden surface of his desk and hasn't written a single word in the last five minutes.
A boy who can be commanding and fierce and passionate but is soft and caring most of the time.
Maybe in a different city.
"I don't know what got into me. I just figured since you kinda seem to have everything and Charlie said to gift a part of ourselves, I'd share my music with you."
blue eyes
For the duration of the ten minute walk from his own apartment to Balthazar's he had felt strong and powerful and had really been looking forward to the night.
His hands clutch the small gift in his hands as he's trying to talk himself into stepping through the door of the bookstore that seems like an insurmountable obstacle.
"Good," Cas smile had gone soft and Dean could not help, but stare at him in awe.
"I'll go for a drive, blow off some steam."
What would Cas want?
Maybe things are going to be easy for once.
Cas shrugs, and the uncoordinated movement brings him even closer to Dean.
"So am I Dean. And please don't beat yourself up about this. Everybody progresses in their own time. You're not late, because you don't know what you want yet."
What could someone like Castiel probably want?
Like he could fly away if he wanted to.
This was a bad idea and Cas' world was about to collapse.
"We can order something, eat in the living room and clean up later," Dean says, oblivious to Cas' thoughts, fingers mindlessly tracing patterns over Cas' shoulder and the warmth in Cas' stomach becomes almost unbearable.
He grabs Dean's hand and pulls him towards the crime scene.
He stared at Cas' sleep ruffled hair, the soft expression on his face and the shy smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he walked towards Dean.
"You wanna tell me why you got so drunk, you didn't recognize your own apartment and started a strip tease in my bedroom?," Cas asked, shooting a teasing grin in Dean's direction who felt his face already heating up again.
His answer is cut off by a gust of cool air and when he looks up, Dean has his arms raised in victory.
And he would never stop smiling again.
It takes Cas' leap forward to get him to look up.
Dean closes his eyes for a moment, willing his feelings away into the box in his head titled "deal with it never", before he puts on his best smile and turns around.
"It was never my intention to hurt you. I understand that you are going to need time to forgive me, however, I wanted you to know that I meant every word of what I said this morning.
But what if it is Dean?, a traitorous voice asks.
He took another stumbling step forward and nearly face planted the sidewalk.
But it didn't.
"But not only is she absolutely breathtaking, she's wearing a t-shirt that has Chewbacca stepping out of the Tardis printed on it."
What would he like?
Burying his face in his hands, Cas fights against the tears welling up in his eyes.
"I know," Cas said, tilting his head up to steal another kiss, "it's why you love me."
This is not exactly the surprise he had in mind when he planned doing something special for Dean.
It's not.
It's beautiful and calming and he loves the feeling of early December when the year is coming to a close yet somehow has a feeling of endless wonder to it.
"But only because I have to go and don't want to part in strife."
"Oh thank fuck," Meg groans. She has tied her usually perfectly curled brown hair into a messy bun on top of her head and presses the back of her hands against her red cheeks.
Cas puts his one of his hands over Dean's who are still covering his wounds in a desperate attempt to still the blood.
"Anyways, no one is standing behind the counter, so we are just awkwardly standing around, looking at the display cases, when all of a sudden …"
"What happened? Are you hurt?"
"I can see that," he says, "seriously how did you guys sit through this for a week? I've been here for two minutes and I'm already sweating."
He doesn't mean to sound suspicious, but he's beginning to wonder what exactly he agreed to.
"After almost a decade Cas finally decided to talk about his feelings for you and out of all the days he could have picked, he chose April Fools' Day?"
One too scared of being unworthy and the other too oblivious to notice.
"But this is just cruel, man. I know … I hope it wasn't your intention to turn this into some sort of payback and I am sure in Sammy's giant brain this was the right thing to do, but this hurts. Okay? This fucking hurts, because it's fine if you don't want to be with me, but telling me you do only to take this away from me …," his voice trembles and he feels pathetic.
He doesn't hear.
He grabs Dean by the collar and pulls him closer.
He turns towards Dean with an earnest expression.
"Liquor courage," Dean says and puts his arm around Cas's waist who promptly slumps against him, proving his point.
This is way too private for him to snoop through.
For a moment Dean considers walking over to him, but they don't really talk outside of the few classes they share, so it would probably be awkward.
"I love you too, you idiot," he says with a smile, grabbing Cas by the collar of his dress shirt.
"Listen, Dean, just tell me what's going on. Cas called and he seemed really upset, but I couldn't make any sense of what he was saying, so I promised to talk to you."
His cheeks are on fire and his whole body is tingling with discomfort from just thinking about it.
"I didn't drink that much. They thought I'd be fine," Cas belatedly replies, and his words have the sobering effect of a bucket of ice water.
"Castiel," the man says and that's something after all.
"I love you so much," he had whispered, pressing a kiss to the side of Cas' face.
"I'd like that, too."
"... do for you?", his voice is low and scratchy and somehow makes the standard question sound like a mix between a sexual proposal and an offer for a spontaneous therapy session.
When Dean left in the evening, he did not come back.
The silence between them is companionable, but Cas finds himself scrambling for something to say. He desperately wishes for their conversation to continue and curses his useless brain for its emptiness.
Cas only nods, too weak to make his brain work properly.
"That's what I thought," Dean scoffs when Cas fails to answer.
“I don’t think you’re pathetic,” he says sternly, “I believe you’re the exact opposite of pathetic. You are caring, selfless. You’re loving.
"Yes," she says, "yes, everything is fine."
He lets his hand slide down from the back of his neck and gives Cas a small nod.
But of course, he can't ever say no to Charlie, which is why he's here now.
His verbal filter is barely functional on good days but it’s nonexistent around Dean.
"It's nothing," he said, looking at the menu like he did not know exactly what he was going to order.
Sometimes Dean needs to be forced into talking for his own good, but sometimes -like today- it is better to wait for him to work through it on his own until he is ready to talk about it.
He bites his lip and shrugs, before asking: "What about you, Mr. Top of the class? What are you doing?"
Like he was floating above the ground.
“You mind if we put on some music?”
It almost makes up for the fact that he will be spending Halloween alone.
No past. No future.
He wipes them off with the back of his hand and all Cas can do is watch helplessly as the boy he loves falls apart in front of him.
"I am sorry," he says and he means it, "I am sorry I made you feel like you could not talk openly to me. I am sorry for being unpredictable and I am sorry for being mad at you all these times, when you didn't deserve it."
Castiel chuckles and Dean smiles imagining the stoic man in front of him as a child, wide-eyed and excited.
Dean Winchester is looking better than ever.
He sees him blink rapidly.
"They left," he parrots, trying not to concentrate on the feeling of Cas's cheek against his arm,
At some point, Cas made a comment, something dorky and awkward (that much he was sure of, even though he couldn't recall what he had said exactly) and Dean had looked up at him, eyes shining with amusement and a sleepy smile on his face.
"To the drive-in theater," he says with a grin and the look on his face is so genuinely excited and happy it distracts Cas from his initial train of thoughts.
He must have said the right thing, because a smile spreads on Dean's face.
He automatically feels himself relax when he joins his friends, and the smiles they greet him with mirror his own.
"Shit!"
It's not a lot considering that almost every page is covered in ink, but most of the text is not about the writer but about another boy.
We're lucky if that thing has seen an electrician by the end of spring."
The guy is so far out of Dean's league, he lives in a different galaxy.
Cas had put on a documentary and Dean, who did not care about the topic at all, was half asleep on his chest.
If the underlying fear that has been on his mind since the day they met is about to come true.
"I won't take advantage of you like this."
"Dean, I ...,"
"Dean," Cas said, blue eyes pleading in the puppy dog way he knew Dean could not resist, "Come on, it's your birthday. It's supposed to be your special day. Your friends doing something nice for you is not fake friendliness, it's them celebrating the fact that you were born. Please, just tell me. Let me do something nice for you."
"Dean won't tell me his birthday and I am going insane over it. He insists he doesn't want anything, that I should just quit bugging him - which I have been doing consistently over the last few week - because the whole concept is overrated and stupid, but I don't believe him. I don't believe he believes that. He threw you the most gigantic Moondoor themed party for your 21st birthday and he went out of his way to get Sam a signed copy of this weird super rare criminology book and he had the perfect day planned for mine … I simply don't understand why he won't let me do the same for him. Or at least tell me the damn date. I'm his boyfriend for crying out loud, I should know his fucking birthday."
"You know what, never mind," he says and turns around to fulfill the guy's order before anything else stupid comes out of his mouth.
He tries not to get nervous at the thought of that.
Stolen glances in the beginning when they thought no one was watching and later stolen kisses when they no longer cared who saw.
"I want to give the people a voice who don't feel like they will ever be heard. I want to help them let the world know that they're here and that their opinions are valid and that they deserve to be acknowledged. That their point of view has to be considered, because I want us to live in a society that serves everyone and not just a few privileged people. I want to shine a light on issues in our political system and the way we treat each other in our everyday lives. I want to somehow make the world a better place, if only a little."
He walks into their tiny storeroom and grabs a mop and a bucket with shaking hands.
When green eyes met blue ones, shining with earnestness, Dean knew the answer before Cas said it out loud.
However, racking his brain over it is not going to solve anything, so he steels himself for a fallout and follows Dean upstairs.
" I wanted to apologize," Cas explains with a shaky smile, "for how I acted when we last met. I didn't mean to be ignorant or offensive, I simply …"
watching me from across the room
Dean stares at his hands hovering above the counter and pointedly does not look at the customer. Charlie would tear him a new one if she knew it, but he can't make eye contact now or he is going to die from embarrassment.
"Never," Meg snorts from the other side of their table group, "when I last filed a complaint about it, the answer I received was and I quote 'We will tend to the problem as soon as time and resources allow it' which translates to 'We will let you stew in your own sweat until it's winter and the problem doesn't need to be addressed anymore.'
"You're not so bad yourself."
I did what I did not out of dislike," he sighs, burying his face in his hands as he forces the words out, "but because I was so awestruck by his beauty that I could neither speak nor take my eyes off him."
"I thought you didn't know what to do with me," Dean confesses, "not that I blamed you or anything. You were always so driven and focused and I behaved like a fumbling idiot every time I was near you."
All Cas can do is shake his head in disbelief.
selection.
It was Friday, January 24th and Cas' nerves were killing him and Dean would most certainly be more than happy to help out, should they fail in their attempt.
He’s about to step back and apologize when Dean’s fingers curl around his wrist.
He's on his way over to Benny instead (whose vampire costume was clearly created with minimal effort).
If Dean had to take a guess, he'd say that this is the first time in over half a year that Cas has gone out.
Dean doesn’t answer and now that he has said his part, Cas ist starting to feel self-conscious again.
"I'm not sure if I told you about this," she grins up at him conspiratorially, not slowing down her steps, and despite being about five inches taller, Cas struggles to keep up with her.
He turns around to make sure Cas follows, and suddenly their faces are only inches apart.
"You just don't want to be alone at a work event," Dean murmurs out of the corner of his mouth, aware that their arrival hasn't gone unnoticed.
"Don't ever change."
He swirls her around, laughing, before he sets her back on her feet.
"Hello Dean."
Cas doesn't know if he believes in heaven and hell.
At least they can move on now.
"Nothing," Dean whispers back, and all of a sudden, he's touching Cas's hair and doing exactly what he vowed not to do moments ago, and how weird does this make him look?
"You don't have to go," Cas adds, more quietly. "You can come in if you want, I just wasn't expecting you, that's all."
With a jolt he realizes that it will be just the two of them, that he's wearing hideous sweatpants and that he will have to tell the most beautiful man on earth that he has been stood up by all of friends.
Doesn't Dean know that Cas cherished their talks and that they were the only reasons he looked forward to the classes he did not share with any of his few friends?
As much as he enjoys the prospect of seeing Charlie's way too handsome coworker, he's less than thrilled to be getting rigged into actually having to participate in whatever ridiculous holiday activities Charlie has in store for all of them, let alone having to talk to Castiel.
Castiel scans the crowd for familiar faces, but doesn't recognize anyone.
"I understand why you wouldn't want to" he pauses, before he shakes his uncertainty off,  "but I would very much like for us to get along from now on."
Everybody was wrong.
It's not like this is a date.
"This was not at all what my behavior was about. I didn't mean to make him feel judged or belittled. That was never my intention.
if you knew
"That is amazing, Cas," Dean says, his voice sounding a little hoarse and when Cas looks at him his shoulders are hunched and his smile is no longer happy.
No letter.
His friend is standing in the kitchen, but upon walking closer, Dean notices Andrea by his side and retreats back to the living room.
Over the course of the week, Dean is trying -and failing- to come up with an idea.
Their lips meet, and for a moment all of Dean's thoughts leave his brain.
"Why not?," he asked, partly as provocation, partly out of curiosity.
He was drunk, yes.
At first he tries to shrug it off, but under her scrutinizing look, Cas has no other choice, but to nod in defeat.
"What?!," he shouts and Dean starts gesturing, which has Cas tilt his head in confusion. Rolling his eyes, Dean grabs his hand and pulls Cas with him as he makes his way through the crowd towards the glass door that leads into the luxurious garden.
