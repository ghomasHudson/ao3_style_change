“Dean,” he starts with, and it’s a good start. It’s familiar, it’s warm, it’s embracing. The tension leaves Dean’s shoulders.
“You know the drill, Cas,” Dean rambles, “grab Sam, wait by reception, I’ll swing by with the car.”
“Stop that!”
Castiel feels his throat close up and the pain of his headache carried downwards into a throbbing heartache.
“Not as big of an idiot as you,” Cas says fondly, brushing aside whatever litter lain by the spot next to Dean so he can occupy its place. “Are you alright?”
“Oh!” Jack exclaims. “Of course. Sorry. I’ll wait in the living room. You can bring the hot cocoa to me after your sex.” He smiles gratefully once more at them before exiting the room.
His curiosities over his attraction to Cas have been satisfied and all that’s left now consists of pure want. Their flirtatious quips are no longer just that. Their casual and familiar touches have mutated into fire alighting his flesh. For Dean, all things Cas-related is now headed by an insurmountable longing.
Cas snorts and goes to pick up his book again. “Sensible. I see you’ve resorted all possible alternatives before fake-jumping into bed with your best friend.”
“This is different. This is—this is fucking gay as shit,” Dean snaps.
He spits the toothpaste out just as Cas exits and they both meander tiredly towards Cas’ bed to share as they’ve done off and on since they were eleven.
Dean looks hesitant. “You sure you’re alright? You want me to come with you—”
“Thank you,” Sam garbles out before sprinting towards their guest bathroom.
“I think this is just a shitty situation,” Dean continues with a tired exhale. He also slumps forwards. “It’s not easy for me, or for you, and I get—I get why you can’t help but be annoyed with me. I’m a pretty shitty person, with a pretty shitty temper. You’ve not said or done anything to me that amounts to even half of what I have to you, so don’t you dare be the one to start apologising.”
Dean glares at him and pointedly looks away until their food arrives.
“You are unbelievably ill-mannered,” huffs Castiel.
“Have I been kidnapped into slave labour?”
“Sam, it’s fine,” Cas laughs, “go throw up. Please lift up the toilet seat and then put it back down when you’re done.”
Not only that way—though he’s starting to allow himself to want that more fully too—but what he wants most is the friendship back, the mutual affection, and their selfless vows to one another. He wants everything their bond was as well as any more intimacies he can share with Cas.
“Not when it comes to
Cas sits on the bed as Dean has seen him do a thousand times and nothing’s ever looked sexier or more inviting to him. He pats the space next to him and Dean has never seen anything cuter. He’s going to need therapy for this.
“Yeah, alright, I get it—”
“Mm, love you too,” Cas mumbles back, half-asleep, flops onto his back and yawns.
Cas is sitting in his usual spot, reading.
Castiel smiles at him brightly, abandoning his soup at once as he rises towards the kitchen’s exit. “Let me just get dressed quickly and we’ll go.”
“Cas.”
“I can’t believe I’ve let this conversation fester for so long. It’s stupid, and outlandish, and, if I must say, a little fucked up and weird,” Cas grumbles behind the protective barrier of his hands. “Meg’s unwanted affections and an awkward breakup isn’t enough to warrant something so—so insane. I’d have to be insane to agree.”
The second never arrives.
Sam worries his lip with uncertainty, but because he’s eleven and his big brother is always right, he eventually relents with a careful and quiet, “alright.”
The joy from it glows brighter in his chest than any other kiss. It’s pretty surreal, pretty wonderful, and he forgets everything else that isn’t Cas’ quiet hum of pleasure against his lips.
“Meg?”
“Jesus, fuck!” Dean’s coffee topples over its rim as he jumps about a foot. His hand had flown to fumble for his gun in his surprise before he realised he was only in a t-shirt, flannel pants, and a bathrobe. “What the fuck did I say about doing that? I could have shot you!” he shouts.
“Shit.” Dean’s pulse thumps in his ears. “I’m in love with Cas.”
Shit, fuck.
It’s likely that last night may have thrown a wrench into his distancing efforts.
Cas listens to her feet scurry against their floorboards into the living room. Dean’s footsteps hurry out after her. Cas hopes it’s to apologise.
“Stop making me kiss you to shut you up for saying stupid things,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “I’m in my forties and you’re making us both look like dumbass teenagers here.”
“Will you just—” Cas stops and sips at the air slowly with a steadying inhale. His eyes quiver shut then opens firmly with resolve. “Can we just go?”
“You coming or not?” Dean asks once he’s eventually standing from outside the car, failing to hide his flushed complexion by looking skyward.
“Awesome!” Dean claps his hands together. “Before we go, you should...um—” his gaze trickles down from Cas’ face to his chest, “—unbutton it. Why don’t you unbutton it?”
“I hope I don’t have to do a lot more of that,” Dean says, half-amused, half-chastened. “Though I probably should have been doing a lot more of it in the past—or just, you know, not…fucking up things with you in the first place.”
“You’re not going to keep that suit and tie and trench coat on for the supermarket?” Dean asks jovially, leaning on the counter and giving Castiel a goading grin.
because she’s a wicked demon of a person,” Dean protests.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Cas murmurs in a subdued tone.
“You!” Dean flaps a hand in Cas’ face, making him spring backwards and stagger. “You’re all devil-may-care about this entire fuck-up!”
—Dean’s go-to retort when he feels hurt and defensive against someone he cares about.
They also become the only two left on the bus at the field trip’s third stop because Castiel’s mother refused to sign off permission for this portion of the trip. Waterfalls are dangerous. It doesn’t upset Castiel too much, registers to him as simply one more childhood experience redacted due to her anxieties.
“Leave Sam with me. Leave my son, goddammit!” John half-pleads, in a voice both terrorising and distraught.
“Doubtful.” Cas glowers at him one last time, then shuffles onto his feet and snatches his book to his chest with an air of you’ve-wasted-both-our-times-and-I’m-not-speaking-to-you-until-dinner.
“I’m sure you’ll come up with something worse one day,” Cas teases, a half-smile on his lips—
“Or you could also call me something akin to a sugared and mucilaginous nectar made of bees. I like bees.”
Please don’t hate Benny for discouraging their admittedly cute but ultimately unhealthy behaviour, he’s just trying to be a good friend
“Excuse me?” Cas asks, hesitant.
“Since you’ve starting dating her, she’s been hogging up all your time.”
“Yes, well, sometimes I forget. Sue me, I’m fallible.”
It unnerves Dean tremendously.
“It’s my angry voice.” Sam starts dramatically pouting at them both, then blows a raspberry at Dean and then Cas.
Cas settles him, holds his shoulders, and helps him slide down the wall beside them. Cas crouches to the floor with Dean and holds onto one side of his cheek with a warm and soothing palm. It's a bit callused. Like Dean's. They match sometimes. He tries to fumble for Cas' other hand with his, trying to see if they can touch palms like in that Tarzan movie. He watched it once as a teenager with some girl from his class he was trying to sleep with.
“Sam,” Dean says again, voice cracking. “I’m not ready to think about it. I’m not ready to let myself want it. Okay? Cas, he’s—I just can’t. I don’t even know if it’s real.” Cas’ words echoes in his head. That they are real. Dean wishes it was enough to make him believe it.
“Uh, yeah, hi, I’m Meg, I’m not a very nice person,” she says disinterestedly, “Sorry, I thought we’d already met. Like. Ages ago.”
Dean, of course, ruins it.
“I understand.”
With immense willpower he untangles himself from Cas, swears again when he notices the unmissable bulge in both their trousers, and ungainly manoeuvres himself onto a nearby chair.
Dean hurls his phone at him too, so carelessly Castiel fumbles with it and almost drops it.
“What the fuck, Sam? Of course not!” Dean shouts. “You actually listening to dad and his homophobic bullshit?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Newsflash, asshole! We’re friends! We talk!”
“That was definitely Sam yelling oh my fucking god at us.”
Now, he notices an etch of concern and pity on Benny’s face. It’s directed straightly at him.
? No Taylor Swift? But...” Dean stutters. “But Taylor Swift!”
“Because I asked him to,” Castiel replies evenly. Dean didn’t even realise he’s talking aloud. God, he’s so drunk.
What he thinks about instead is that he would like to tally up the boy’s freckles, connect the dots to create a facial constellation. He immediately frowns at this thought, adds it to the list of Things You Can Think But Never Say Aloud — an exercise Gabriel has taught him about many years ago.
“What I’m saying, dipshit, is we should get some supplies for dinner. When you’re done with your soup,” Dean’s voice drops an octave, and he’s been ploughing on so confidently that it’s a noticeable shift when he continues, shyly, “do you want to go buy some groceries? With me?”
“I guess we could do that, paint a name on one,” Dean continues in a small voice, staring at the scuff on his shoes, “since Cas was an angel and all. He’s a bit different, but the same. Special, but family and shit.”
“Yeah—well—you—you’ve got too big of a stick up your butt for a good time anyways and you have stupid hair—” Dean’s actually quite jealous of Cas’ goddamn pristine tousled bedhead, “and I wouldn’t date you either, jerk.”
Brownie points to those that clock onto canon references I’ve casually co-opted
He doesn’t remember much. Only glimpses. Being cradled out the bar—a hazy memory he will replay and claw to keep fresh—the collapse into a booth, the vomiting in an alley, a perky young blonde waitress, a man that called Dean his boyfriend. Nothing too terrible, he doesn’t think.
“Sure. Okay.”
It’s like Dean is falling head-first down a water-slide. An unpredictable whirlwind that’s terrifying and exhilarating all at once. Once he knows he’s wanted to kiss Cas, probably has been wanting it for awhile, everything else tumbles out so insurmountably.
. Freudian slip, much?”
Cas’ shoulders slump.
“Sex.”
“I don’t know why I keep hurting you and everyone else I love,” Dean says quietly. “But you. Mostly you.”
He emits a bear-like growl of discontent into warm flesh. He nuzzles his face into Cas’ neck for the shade and ends up sighing contentedly into him. Next second, a hand swats lightly at his head.
“Although he could do with eating more vegetables and leading a less sedentary lifestyle,” Cas chips in, completely superfluously, which has Sam nodding along. “You do partially own this place, Dean, you could try attending some classes some time.”
It seems he eventually does because when he finds Meg in the crowd, he’s alone.
“Not even Shake it Off?”
“Yeah, but so are we,” Dean says. “We’ll just do this until—”
“You look like you want to burn your flesh off when she sits next to you and kisses your cheek or—
“Jesus christ,” Benny mutters. “Cas, go. Dean, sit your ass back down. He’s a grown man. You don’t need to follow him into the toilet like a little duckling just to make sure he comes back in one piece.”
“Just at the top. You look like a tax accountant, man.”
“Oh, dear sounds about right.”
“Whoa!” he hears Dean exclaim from outside the doorway.
“It’s not you, it’s me?” Cas asks, amused, lifting away to cock his head at Dean. “Have you been watching more of your shitty soaps on that TV, Dean?”
“Objectively, yeah.”
“What else have you been teaching Cas lately? Holding hands through the apocalypse together?”
about Cas’ feelings—so he had snapped, “Yes, I think you’ve had just about enough to drink.”
“I just thought the bed’s comfier. Don’t wanna be making out in the bathroom either, doesn’t that violate some kind of hygienic rule?” he proposes carefully.
“I’m trying to hold your fucking hands so I can say something nice to you. I just—I forget how happy you make me sometimes, y’know? I think I take it for granted.”
“Nobody I want to be with like that, it appears.” But you Dean, he stops himself from adding, thanking the part of his brain that hasn’t let go of all his inhibitions quite so fully. Future, sober, and heedful Castiel is not going to be happy with him as it is.
“Why on earth would I
“So you don't own any then. You can borrow mine,” Cas offers diplomatically, cracking some eggs onto another pan as Dean tends to the bacon.
“Oh, you find this funny?”
He can envisage, at any moment, Dean Winchester chasing him out the door and chasing the memories of their intimacies away with a fifth of vodka. Knowing Dean, likely the entire bottle.
Cas was right. Shit. Awkward. Fucked up. So, so, so weird. Nothing between them has ever been weird. It wasn’t even weird when they slobbered each other’s faces right after they got married and then pretended to hump each other on the altar. They’ve shared beds, they’ve seen each other naked in locker rooms, they’ve kissed each other’s cheeks and held hands and danced together ridiculously and made jokes about having sex with each other and why is this suddenly weird? Why is Dean’s heart pattering hard against his chest and his vision is blurring and his breath is—
“I was just joking around,” Dean says, “you look—um—fine. You look fine to me.” His eyes squeezes shut, and he curses inwardly at his choice of verbiage.
“Nah. I don’t think so.” Dean shakes his head, pats Cas on the back reassuringly. “We’re still...in this for awhile.”
At this, April yields. “Oh. Sorry. Did you two want to get started with each other first?”
Fine.
“Why are you being so snarky right now?” Dean snaps. Sam’s attack mode melts into a softened expression and he looks so much like a kicked puppy that Dean collapses in on himself in shame.
Cas chuckles to himself.
For a brief fragment of a second, before his cerebral functions can catch up to this moment, Cas thinks he’s uttered these unspeakable words out loud himself.
at Eileen.
Dean slides in next to him and places a hand on his shoulder, righting Castiel against his side. He’s far too close. He’s so close now, pressed up next to Castiel, that he wants to cry in relief.
A brief look of disappointment crosses her face which they both choose to ignore.
“Um, alright,” a flustered Sam replies. His pursed lips looks like he’s holding back a thousand and one questions that Dean is not ready to answer.
Dean snorts. “You have a catalogue of my habits in that weird little brain of yours, don’t you?”
“Not—not really?”
Dean’s still staring in wonder and amazement at Cas, touched with a tinge of misery.
The more he leans into their friendly flirtations, the easier it becomes to just be in this friendship. It eases his desires by wearing him thinner each day. He embraces the inconceivability of it. He embraces the contentment it brings him when their fruitless flirtations snuff out the flames of a hopeless want.
“Oh,” Sam says, “and?”
He clambers to remember if he had been staring at Dean too much tonight, more so than usual,
When he eases with difficulty into bed, he exhales his distress and smiles.
It’s funny and a little bit sad that, all in all, it has been far too effortless acting like he’s in love with his best friend.
“Dean—”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel consoles gently, forehead crinkling. “That’s horrible.” He wordlessly extends an apple from his backpack towards the boy. “If no one is taking care of you, then you should take care of yourself. Steal some fruit once in awhile. Candy bars are bad for you.”
I don’t...I don’t know what happened. This was meant to be light-hearted, fun, and fluff but I turned this chapter into an emotional pinefest. I literally had to add an angst tag just for this chapter. I’m sorry!
“What?” Cas repeats with the same bafflement.
“Um...Cas?”
“Is that what’s got you acting so strange throughout this?” He draws back. “You’re thinking I’ve been harbouring...more than friendly inclinations towards you—and you can marry me as a joke and kiss me as a joke but once your family or friends or, forbid it,
“Dean,” Cas groans, and that does amusing things to his stomach too. “Why are they still here? It’s been four days. Do these people not have jobs? They’re so loud.”
He reaches forwards for the milkshake, and without saying anything, takes Cas’ straw into his mouth and sucks. It’s okay. He prefers pie.
Cas’ mouth drops open. “You told him everything?”
He hears a dangerous grumble that could have come from no one else but Dean. It’s deep, and dark, and if Cas isn’t careful, the noise creates terrible flutters inside his stomach.
Dean smirks, springs upwards in the direction of Cas —who to his credit only widens his eyes slightly in surprise before a body is launched at him— and tackles him to the floor.
A curt nod confirmed her satisfaction with their efforts and later Bobby, Benny, Ash, Garth, and Dean were ushered into the largest booth at Harvelle’s Roadhouse, armed with free meals on the house.
A kaleidoscope of fairy-tale images fans out in Dean’s mind, each cheesier and sappier and more sentimental than the last. He’s got a picture of him and Cas strolling down a riverbank, hand in hand, setting up a picnic, kissing on a dinner date, buying a house together, getting a dog, maybe one day a—
“Since when did you eat?” he blurts out, interest hitting him and slowly rising into a stream of panic. “Fuck, when did you start getting hungry? Are you—” he stops himself before he asks if Cas is okay, because he’s not a friggin’ girl and they’re not about to braid each other’s hair while they talk about feelings or some shit.
“I win,” Cas declares heartily, slaps Dean’s cheek twice and firm, starts counting to ten.
Dean notices with a mild displeasure and gratefulness and surprise that Cas is not staying undressed once he rid himself of his clothes. He grabs Dean’s spare set of pajamas.
Eileen and Sam share a loaded look, and she nods at him subtly, like she understands. They seem to have what Dean and Cas have, but luckily, well—uncomplicated.
“Dean, wait.”
Dean puffs out a scoff. “You could start by throwing out the coconut oil you slather on your skin every Sunday night. Makes you smell weird. You’re basically a damn baby in a trench-coat as it is, your skin doesn’t need to be any softer than it already—” his voice fades mid-rant when he turns to face Cas and their noses bump together.
“So...” Dean starts, breaking the seventeen-minute silence between them both in the car. He’s been counting. He taps the steering wheel thrice. “Guess she didn’t have that hard of a time believing we were already…um...you know. That was surprisingly easy.”
Dean’s breathing goes choppy and uneven. “Contrary to popular belief, I do think about things other than Cas you know.” It’s not a lie but it feels like one under this context.
“It’s fine, Dean,” he replies earnestly. “We’re always yelling at each other.”
He probably should have just let Cas go if he’d wanted to go, because having him gone couldn’t be any worse than having him here but...gone.
“What about your parents?”
With no protest from Cas, but only a starstruck and awed expression, Dean surges forwards so their lips could meet.
Cas starts scouring the room with a beady squint, for what, Dean’s not sure.
“Yeah, like...like kissing. We’ve done it before, not a big deal right? Just like mouth to mouth—um—but just thinking—we should—if we’re gonna—” He supposes Cas was right, he did come up with something worse. Just sooner than he’d thought. “—what I mean is—well—”
“You’re just as clever if not more so, Dean,” Cas argues grumpily, rolling to their bed’s edge and collecting the clothes he’d folded for himself off the floor. “Knowledge regurgitation isn’t the sole indicator of intelligence by any means. There are emotional components—”
“I became best friends with you when you were a stray child and you never once said I was cool,” Dean protests, poking Cas’ chest with a socked toe in jest.
“Cas?” he splutters out hopefully before even looking at caller ID.
Cas looks at him expectantly.
Benny’s devilish teasing has sharpened into scrutiny. Cas tenses. His glassy eyes begin to focus more keenly on his friend’s expression.
Dean considers wrenching away from Cas. Instead, he run a hand down Cas’ arm, the one looped around him, and raises his eyebrows as if daring Sam to say something shitty. Obviously, he doesn’t.
Cas smiles at him. “You told me not to ‘Dean’ you.”
“Slow,” Dean repeats to both himself and Cas, nodding resolutely.
“Cas? Hello? You okay?”
“Could you show me to my…room?”
Dean had not truly felt it in his bones before now how exhausting it’s been, defending who they are to each other. The fatigue of pretending is only palpable to him now in the relief of its absence.
The flare up of his hopes and desires will never be silent forever.
“Okay,” Dean calls, “bedtime. My boyfriend’s—well, look at him.”
“And what exactly do you mean by that?” needles Benny.
actually start believing a romance between us is not a joke, that’s a step too far for you.”
Castiel feels something tug at his lips, a movement he’s not entirely used to, and then he finds himself throwing his head back with unadulterated laughter.
Dean covers his once-again burning face with his hands. “Yes, alright, Cas, I
This one is a little less fluff, a teensy more emotional, but I think we needed (well, I needed) it.
Cas recoils at Dean’s tone, but composes himself just as quickly. He stands a little taller. “I believe you often partake in the same activity enough to know why I’d be going to a bar by myself.”
Meg pulls a disgusted face. “Am I like a carpenter in this scenario?”
“I don’t have any things to put away,” Cas says faintly, but he’s smiling. It’s timid, even feeble, but it’s close enough of an expression that makes something inside Dean twitch and glow.
They’d been standing as they shouted at each other. It’s been horrible. Now, Dean falls against a wall to help keep him upright.
Dean kisses him again with less force, less pressure, less desperation and Cas sinks into it with a trembling release of breath.
“Are we just going to sit here?” Castiel eventually asks, head thunking against the backrest.
It’s ebbing away.
“Dean, please do not speak for me,” Cas interjects quietly. He takes a deep breath, controlling his emotions. He’s good at this. He’s practiced it enough to be an expert.
“Doesn’t anybody here know not to creep up on a guy with a gun? Especially after all this shit today!” Dean yells.
“Cas? You alright there?” Benny asks in a small voice, as if he doesn’t want to startle a spooked rabbit.
Fuck it. At least this conversation can just be over once he says it. “Cas told me he loved me.”
“Hilarious,” replies Cas, monotone, as he fixedly studies the landscape passing by the car window.
She crosses her arms at him. “I’m barely a hundred and thirty pounds, Dean.”
“What—” Castiel shakes his head. “What’s—”
“Did you know that he puts socks on me while I sleep if I forget to? He also sneaks wheatgrass powder and crushed vitamins into my protein shakes to make me healthier. He thinks I don’t know.”
Sam’s encouraging smile gentles it. Soon, he’s breathing the fire out and he smiles back.
“Not to my knowledge, no,” Cas murmurs back in an undertone. He rushes up a couple of steps to catch April by the elbow. “April, I thought we were going to watch a movie.”
It’s Cas’ bedraggled hair, his sun-kissed skin, his stubble, his lips. Dean doesn’t want to get started on his best friend’s eyes. All things that Dean, of course, has noticed before and recognised that, yes, Cas is a handsome dude. Dean just never imagined he’d ever give it so much thought this late into the game.
“No, no,” Castiel says quickly, “it’s just—the idea of any kind of food right now…I…I am not feeling entirely too well.”
They’re walking again—stumbling—in the outside now, where the wind cuts sharply and a trickle of rain is dripping down on them. It stays quiet except for the rain. In silence, Dean manoeuvres Castiel to lean against the side of the Impala’s trunk while he opens the passenger seat’s door. He carefully, too gently and carefully, helps Castiel into the seat and pulls the seatbelt around him. Castiel grumpily feels like he doesn’t deserve any of this kindness.
“Yeah. Why does Eileen get one and Cas doesn’t?” Dean asks pettily. “Is this because we’re a gay couple?” He knows that last bit is unnecessary and even gratuitous. As soon as he says it, he feels shitty and knows he went a step too far. Obviously, it’s not that. He just wanted to strike a nerve with these tee-hee idiots.
Dean curses beneath his breath then curses again when Cas pops up behind him.
I can’t believe I had abandoned this for so so long 😭 This was something I was so excited about writing but some personal issues and time constraints just got the better of me...
. I’m—I’m getting another drink at the bar. Either get Benny to drive you home or…” Dean sneers at nobody in particular, avoiding Cas’ imploring eyes. “Or get a ride home to Meg’s, I guess. Have fun.”
“We’ll find another way. Somehow,” he intones.
you feel the urge to get drunk after the news of Sam’s engagement?”
“But...I brought popcorn,” Dean says, hurrying up the steps in pursuit of Cas.
“Alright, I’m just going to…go.”
It’s only when he’s naked and drying himself off from his shower with the towel that he frowns at it with interest. He didn’t have a towel before. He glances at the pool of clothing on the floor that he’d stripped off from earlier. He didn’t have pyjamas before either.
“Do you want me to come over so we can tell Bobby together along with everyone else and—oh my god, we have to lie to Bobby,” Cas bleats with regret. “Oh my god, I feel sick.”
Cas could have burnt the clothes, for all he’d care. It wasn’t like Dean is ever going to wear them again, not now that they have touched Cas’ body. At least Cas didn’t keep them though. At least he had enough decency to realise he shouldn’t be wearing Dean’s things again.
He ignores Sam’s calls of protest, Eileen’s calming hushes to his brother, and barrels out into the hallway—straight into Cas. Solid-bodied, fresh-smelling, wet-looking Cas, in a towel and naught else.
“And a minute ago, you were balking at the idea. Now—now you’re half-naked in a bed and asking me to join you!”
Castiel thinks maybe the alcohol has clogged up too much of his brain and time feels like it’s slowed, but then, no, Dean really is just sitting in the driver’s seat beside him, staring out the window. He’s not moving or putting the keys in the ignition or his foot on the pedal or driving or—
Sam and Eileen are awake when they get back. They watch Elf, Cas giggles throughout it like a dumbshit, and they end up putting the baubles away for next year, when Sam can special order one with Cas’ name on it.
“I wouldn’t phrase it so crudely,” Cas sniffs, “but essentially, yes, I suppose. I’m becoming human now. I may as well join in with your mating rituals.”
“Didn’t want to.” Dean rests his head on Cas’ shoulder, sniffs his neck.
“What are you trying to say, Sam? Spit it out.”
Benny looks comfortable and at ease, though Dean suspects his languor is an act, that he’s alert and watching Dean intently for a misstep. They conduct general chitchat, neither vying too off course and into the dangerous territory of how Dean and Cas actually came to be. Benny never prods or pokes any further than ‘how’s the commitment life?’ or ‘you guys going to move into a house soon?’ or ‘what are y’all doing tonight?’
“Hi.”
“And you realise that my vessel is…male—”
“Are you—” Dean averts his eyes from Cas’ now perpetually solemn face. It adds a little too much hurt to his already steadily growing pile, knowing neither of them have smiled at each other in entirely too long. “Are you back now?” he asks.
Cas wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. “I don’t know, it’s just...different.”
“Everything.”
“I enjoyed sex with April before she stabbed me and tried to kill me. Perhaps tonight will go better. Less stabbing, less attempted murder.”
“I like you too, dumbass!”
Almost there, he thinks to himself, butterflies jumping at the smell of waffles and the smiles of Sammy, Eileen, and Cas.
“Cas,” Dean tries again and falls short. His eyes drop down to where their socked toes almost touch. They’re standing only a little away from one another. It would take a second to close the distance between them.
“Benny, I’m gonna level with you,” responds Dean after a moment of quiet from their booth, “I’m not sober enough to understand half of what you just said. All I know is if Cas wants to grow tomatoes in cow shit, then I’m gonna build him a fancy fuckin’ shed to do it in.”
Surprisingly, Dean laughs with genuine mirth. “What are you doing there, Cas?”
“I thought, maybe—we—I never—“ Dean inhales sharply and holds his breath for the few second that it takes for him to gather his thoughts.
“Your lack of self-care reminds me, do you have safety goggles for today?”
“You, me, and Cas,” she says slowly. “Sex? I thought that’s what we were all doing here.”
“I’m not—I’m not, I’m sorry, I just—that is a
“No—well, yes, I believe I am allowed to feel my feelings too, but I also shouldn’t let that be turned into acidity against you.”
April sweeps her eyes between them with a gleam of amusement. “You expect me to believe you two aren’t fucking?”
Castiel contemplates backing out the room, coming up with a quick excuse to retreat to somewhere where Dean isn’t there, but he’s being peered at with such warmth that makes it impossible for him to leave.
“Oh, and before I go,” Charlie says, sounding a mixture of amused and saddened and irritated, “that first girl you could see yourself falling in love with...the one you dumped so you could stay joined at the everything to Cas? Her name is
“Yeah, I—I think so. We’re in a bit too deep now,” Dean laughs humourlessly. “We’ll end it in a couple of weeks. Is that...is that okay with you?”
“You’re so annoying, you know that?” He shoves one hand at Cas’ chest, who bounds backwards and stumbles on his feet with mock horror.
Sam’s chest puffs, his head drops forward, and he shakes as if he’s laughing. No sound comes out.
serious girlfriend…who I broke up with in less than a year of being with her.”
He’s so shocked he jolts when Dean flips his hand and entwine their fingers together. They’ve never held hands. Not like this. Not so personally, where fingers are interlocked and the grip is so secure and present that it’s unmistakably a very intimate gesture.
Dean still hasn’t confessed back. Today he does.
“Bye, Sam!”
“Where are you going with that four-pack?” Sam asks, not even trying to hide the growing censure, the fading pleasantry.
"Me too."
It’s not entirely nothing yet. There’s dust from the wreckage and some anxiety-ridden fragments splayed across the floor of Dean’s mind, but at least there’s no wall now.
It was a lot easier when they were hurting each other physically. Stabbing with knives and angel blades, over looks and words and actions lashed out in anger.
Dean turns to Cas, once again, in reach of some understanding. Dammit, Cas was always the clever one, the teacher, the homework he copied from, the sun, the stars, and today he is acting just as confounded by everything as Dean.
“Oh.” Cas straightens. “I love you too.”
deprecatory,” Castiel says with chagrin.
It’s two a.m when his phone rings, Cas’ caller ID lighting up the screen. Dean fumbles out of bed and smacks onto the floor in his hurried bid to get to the phone.
Dean chances a guess that this is the third most literal worst timing.
“Dean, try and keep your voice down,” hushes Cas, his hand going to rub a hand down Dean’s arm in a soothing gesture. Dean almost winces away but catches himself in time.
“Am I being blackmailed then?”
“Okay—well—shit. We are where we are and I don’t know where that is anymore!” Dean cries.
He realises he’s convulsing ever so slightly in panic, lips moving uselessly, when his brother touches his chest.
“Wow,” she says indifferently as he goes to lock the door, “didn’t think you had it in you. I mean, really,
No reaction is given except for an open-mouthed stare.
“Yes, I am
“Rough hangover?” Dean jibes, though his face leans closer and he’s inspecting Castiel with concern. “You want an Advil? Some soup, maybe? Might go down you easier."
Meg,” he says in a sickeningly endearing tone, because he absolutely despises Meg, and he doesn’t understand how she managed to claw her way out of hell and into their friendship group. “Wouldn’t we like her so much more if she would just take the hint and stop slithering into your pants though?”
oblivious,” mumbles Dean in return.
Dean grits his teeth. “Yes, it does.”
“I saw how nervous you two were coming in here. I understand it wasn’t...an easy thing to do, telling me, admitting it to yourselves. Can I just ask if...” Lisa finally starts to match the level of discomfort Dean and Cas are both feeling now, “if you two ever...? Behind my back? While Dean and I...”
“No, thank you,” Cas replies, the same time that Dean hits her with a resounding and cold, “yes, please.”
He’s too exhausted to fabricate apathy at this point. If he’s not going crazy, the softness is Cas’ face, millimetres from his, makes it look like he’s feeling something here too.
his ass?”
They don’t say anything for awhile, and Dean thinks, shit, he shouldn’t have said anything.
few things that’s consistent and good in my life, but if you want to take that away from me because of what people are saying, then—then
“It’s not like we’re going to have to actually perform the act together.”
“Cas, pal, you’re spiralling—”
“It’s locked, dude.”
“Cas—”
He takes the seat next to Castiel, the only seat left unoccupied due to a severe lack of friends on Castiel’s behalf and the boy’s tardiness.
In lieu of legal fees and ‘damages’ for their interrupted honeymoon, eight years later, Dean is still paying for Sam’s first drink at every one of their gatherings while Cas is responsible for Eileen’s.
Dean also almost vomits right there and then from the emotional gut punch—or maybe it’s the alcohol. Probably both.
“I don’t know why you’re laughing. Mean Girls was a fabulous film.”
“No, Cas, no,” he insists, face heating up from frustration. “It’s inconsiderate,” he ticks one finger off, “it’s thoughtless,” he ticks off another, “and overall, it’s just shitty, alright?”
He doesn’t answer. It’s like he can’t hear Castiel, or like he’s not listening. Again. He’d laugh if it wouldn’t sound so jarring in this tense silence.
He pats Castiel on the back, too forcefully, again, and as he works his jaw with restrained rage, he stalks furiously towards the Impala, slip inside, and drives away with a speed that’s at least double the road limit.
They pass a chipper Eileen and groggy Sam who are padding their way back into Cas’ room, armed with coffee. Cas heads determinedly towards the fridge after exchanging a polite ‘good morning’ with them while Dean launches into a comment about antisocial behaviour which earns him the finger from Sam.
Dean scoffs, chucking his chin upward. “Right? So rude.”
“Well, fucking fine. Not like I give a shit anyway,” Dean snaps, returning determinedly to his indignant prowl, back to his shitty solace, back to his room.
Maybe he could find a reason for them to stay a little longer and Dean could keep playing along for the people he already played along for. The thought gets Castiel giddy.
She shouts after him like some wanton journalist, hungry for gossip. “You’re not even going to deny it, Dean?”
“Some human, you are,” Dean scoffs, though his tone is light and playful, “you can’t even make a pot of coffee without burning the kitchen down.”
Dean thinks, “not today, bitch,” and that’s that.     Dean isn’t going to let this happen.
“Oh, for
"Um—so I heard some yelling. Are you okay?" Sam’s eyebrows fly up his head when Dean scowls at him. “What’s wrong with your face? You guys just have your first lover’s tiff or what?”
“What?” he snaps.
“You want any or not?”
Instead, they pick pinecones that are assorted in size, unique to each one of them. Sam, with childish jeers from others, ends up with the smallest one.
Castiel has always been conscious of his odd thoughts and tendencies, with a marked improvement in mediating them recently.
It’s a little embarrassing how excited the idea of a back-to-basics practice is getting him. He hopes it doesn’t show too much in his tone.
“Hello to you too, Dean,” Meg greets in a monotone, “always so polite.”
They’re clutching and sobbing together on the floor when Cas seems to come to his senses and splutters. “Me? Me? You—!”
Dean raises his brow at Bobby, unimpressed. “If you’re trying to give me an LGBTQ talk, you’re doing a terrible job. Bit too cavalier and insensitive for the kids these days.”
“You’ll find someone else too someday. Then it’ll just be me.”
“What are you, fifty?” Cas smirks as they head back towards a far-too-patient Lisa.
“You’re much surlier than usual, much more distracted,” Benny comments as he helps himself to the radio, sorting through until he finds a channel he likes. “Seems to me like there’s more to this whole thing than you’re letting on. So...is this about Cas?”
Cas staggers and almost falls to his side. The quixotic fantasy Dean has painted shatters.
“Christ almighty, why is this any of your business? Why are you even here? We were meeting at Bobby’s tonight.”
Dean curses Cas under his breath but moodily totters his way into the shower anyway. It does help. Cas was right. Cas is always right, and fucking great, and warm, and—he shouldn’t be thinking about Cas so much while he’s in the shower.
“You were the one that kicked them out of your room, Dean.”
The boy swats a hand at him, goes “whatever,” and then digs a fistful with the same hand, forgoing cutlery entirely.
He supposes it isn’t only terror this time.
It’s of his own masochism that he is driven forward to corner Bobby as they dispense with goodbyes and congratulations and promises to meet up again soon.
“Yeah,” he says quietly. “You need to fucking get over it.”
“Fuck. Fuck.” Dean runs a trembling head through his hair. He turns pointedly away from Cas, stands from his chair, knocking it over in his rush to get up, and stumbles away at least a few feet, shouting again. “Fuck!”
Behind them, a blood-curdling scream.
“I’m going to make you the best pasta in your life when I get home,” he says around a smile.
“Is there anyone else you can see yourself spending your life with besides Cas?”
Cas blows out an irked puff of air as he reaches over Dean’s side of the bed to rob a pair of socks from his beside drawer.
“I don’t really, no.”
“Dean!” he whispers harshly at Dean’s side, gripping his best friend by the shoulders. One hand inches up his neck and moves to capture his jaw. It calms his breathing in twelve seconds.
Nothing shakes loose except an exhilaration that’s too crushed by the panic and anger to let breathe. All he feels now is sickness.
Dean is struck silent. His mouth open and shut dumbly like a guppy.
Cas’ skills in eavesdropping has honed over the years. He almost wails aloud to himself out of irritation, because now his brain won’t let him move. Instead, he listens.
Dean huffs and turns his attention back to Ash. “You’ve known us for years! How have you been thinking all this time that we were anything more than friends?”
“No, dumbass. I just need to clear my head. You’ve given me far too much to process here.” As Dean glumly unlocks his passenger’s door, Benny sighs. “Jesus, Dean. Do you remember I once warned you that you and Cas are one day going to spiral straight into something fantastically stupid? This is it. How did you think this was a good idea?”
me?” Cas flips the sheets off himself so he can stand and approach his friend. “Dean, she accidentally poked my chest with a kitchen knife one time. We were making chicken alfredo.”
Cas patiently sets down ‘A World Without Bees, The Mysterious Decline of The Honeybee & What It Means For Us’ and appraises Dean with an amused look. He gestures with one sweeping hand for Dean to continue. His smile is faint, but Dean has catalogued the collection of Castiel Novak Smiles so thoroughly over the past two-something decades that he knows this one as at-least-a-little-beguiled.
? He’s not
Dean scoffs, because Cas’ track list of past lovers looks more like an assembly of deranged to terrifically disturbed, rather than
“Or—um—yeah, I guess that’d be disgusting. I’ll get you a fresh bowl if cereal’s what you want.”
“My principles are my principles.”
The first time they make eye contact is when he hops up onto their field trip bus, dressed in an oversized and tattered AC/DC t-shirt during winter.
“I knew what you fucking meant!” Dean bellows. Even from within the bathroom, where Cas
?” Dean demands shrilly.
“Goddammit, Cas, buy some real food.”
It’s by chance of their cheap and hollow walls that allows Cas to understand something new;
“It appears I will only make you uncomfortable with my…feelings if I do.”
“If it’s any consolation, Sam, Dean only realised it himself not too long ago. There was nothing to support or say before.”
“It would probably only take a minute, Dean, and one person. Not really a team effort on this one,” Sam says.
“Hot broth with a tablespoon of cyanide in it.”
He understands their budding relations are likely over now, but what’s worse is he let himself spill his vexation onto Dean, again. He doesn’t want to embrace this side of being human, the emotional destruction to one another, the flaring of tempers that burn only themselves.
“I know.”
“I thought this would be cosier,” Dean replies with ease, beaming at Cas. He reaches for his hands across the booth, not really thinking about it anymore, but Cas jumps away like snakes are winding their way towards him.
“Do you want to be in charge of our groceries? Please, be my guest.”
“Sam set you up?” Dean demands, outraged. His fury at his brother spikes. Why the fuck would Sam do that?
you?” Cas starts shouting at Dean’s pitch. “Were you waiting on an invitation to join?”
Dean swivels his head back towards the door he’s come through and his heart skips stupidly when he catches Cas’ eyes. He’s not looked into them for far too long.
. I hate this. Don’t you
Castiel gawks at him. “You just—you just stuck a pie in your bag?
“You’re overreacting,” Sam replies, somehow bored and exasperated at the same time.
He’s not about to pipe up with ‘hey buddy, sharing a bed with you almost naked does funny things to my tummy now that I think I like you romantic-style’ just to ease Cas’ puzzlement.
“What reason today are the Winchester brothers hating themselves for?” Dean jokes.
“Listen, Cas, I’m really—”
“I want to.”
“Damn, you’re good.” The boy chuckles throatily, an older chuckle that belongs to someone much older than eleven. “Doesn’t mean I have to answer.”
It’s difficult to keep up this energy when everyone around him is looking at him so fondly and with a disgusting amount of amusement.
“Er—”
Oh, god. Ok. It's going to be FOUR chapters now, because my need to flesh this out has gone off the rails.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, to Cas only, next to Cas’ ear, because he’s done apologising to the world now. This is only for Cas.
“Dean,” Cas warns, wholly aware of his grip on Sam yet wholly terrified of what could happen to his most important person. “Dean, stop!” he screams.
“I already agreed—”
“Good,” Dean says, bringing the car to a halt at Bobby’s house. Cas supposes he’s staying the night at Dean’s tonight.
Cas has the window rolled down and Dean has to snap at him to not stick his head out like some fucking dog, to remind him that he’s human now and he could get decapitated or some shit if a truck were to drive by really fast.
“Sammy?”
He’s in love with his best friend who he’s in a pretend relationship with which is going to have to come to an end soon which will result in the collective upset of all their friends and family who apparently believe in this relationship more than the American public do in the moon landing, and Dean has no idea how he’s going to spend the rest of his life trying to find anything better than what he’s gotten from Cas in this silly little scheme that has given him the most cherished snippet of his wildest dreams.
He becomes used to his position in Dean’s life where his feelings have to remain a quiet kind of love. His romantic interest in Dean begins to fall to rest, dormant beneath his commitment and holistic dedication to Dean and his happiness—which now includes Cassie.
enjoyed as much as Cas did if biology were anything to go by—he’s felt a flash of hope so luminous that it eclipses all the flickers he’s felt in the past.
Cas is polite. As always. A little too polite, if you ask Dean. He smiles at her too much, and when she smiles back flirtatiously and says he has a cute smile, he thanks her.
John is leaned against a wall, warily taking in the scene. His cocksure energy seems to have diminished when he nods glumly at Dean.
“My clothes require laundering the same way my body does now. This attire is smelling…musty. I believe I still have some spare shirts of Sam’s in my room.”
Sam and Eileen are at the bar, throwing peanuts into each other’s mouth’s. Sam is waving a huge paw-like hand at them, eyes peripherally still trained on the peanuts flying at him, his mouth gaping open. They’re roaring with laughter, falling into each other, and Sam almost slips off the bar stool by waving too hard at Dean and Cas.
The boy is late, which is not as surprising as his attendance, considering Castiel has never actually seen him in class.
“What—what the fuck are you on about?” trembles Dean.
He opens his mouth to Say Out Loud, finally.
“Sometimes I forget what an asshole you can be,” Sam mutters, looking away and training his eyes on the TV. “He’s been living like a human for ten-something years now. He’s even been human. He knows what love means, Dean. He’s told us he loved us before.”
Their hands flit close so Dean could feel his gooseflesh brush against Cas’ knuckles.
Castiel cocks his head to the side and squints at the man that’s been shaking his shoulder. He puffs an annoyed breath at him.
“It’s just annoying,” Dean rambles, moving forwards across the table to hiss under his breath, “why would she do that? Couldn’t she see that we’re—you know…and even if we weren’t its kind of rude to just…just hit on someone like that when they’re with—shit—you know—a friend or…or whatever.”
“I’m going to make you dinner now. Boyfriend.”
“Sorry, man,” Sam says awkwardly.
It’s quiet until one of them is brave enough to break it.
“Cas, I’m twenty-eight years old and I’ve accumulated exactly
He claps Cas on the back as he passes him. His hand lingers for a second too long, relishing, but he doesn’t think too much about it. The same way he doesn’t think too much about how things are feeling okay again and it’s only going to blow up in his face soon.
Cas is smiling at him, but it is too sympathetic, too awash with forlornness. Dean thinks maybe he can kiss that away, so without thinking too much about it, he sweeps in to press their lips together.
Sam’s halfway down the hallway when he shouts back, way too loudly, “does this mean you’re gay?”
Terror beating at his chest, Cas nods jerkily and goes to remove his confining jeans. He stops at the hem of his shirt and stammers, “I—I’m keeping my shirt on.”
“He’s into all that healthy shit like Sammy, aside from my burgers, heh—he never refuses them…but—uh—he’s always talking about wanting to grow his own organic fruit and vegetables. A greenhouse would be a great birthday gift or…maybe just something I can do for him to make him happy.”
He feels Cas’ eyes on him. He can feel the judgement permeating through in waves.
“Okay, okay,” Dean gasps, a little breathless, “stupid idea, really fucking crazy and stupid, let’s just—let’s just go, alright?”
“We’ve taken the day off for tomorrow,” Eileen explains rationally with a composure Sam sincerely lacks at the moment, “it’s been awhile since we’ve had a fun night out, so we thought—”
“Heya Cas.” This voice is familiar. This voice is the one he could listen to until the end of the world. It’s cheerful right now, a touch false in said cheer, but it’s still layered in kindness and affection and a bit gruff and—Dean.
Dean splutters. “What—I—no—it’s not—I’m not—”
Dean’s in bed now, shoved under the covers just had he done for Cas a couple of days back. He didn’t even notice quick enough to protest and demand the floor instead.
“Am I, what, in love with them or something?”
“Good. Awesome. Okay. I’m just going to—” he points in the opposite direction of where he’s meaning to go. “Going now. Bye.”
“We’re leaving!” Dean growls before slamming her front door shut behind them and kicking the door once for good measure, enraged.
“Piss off, go brush your teeth. You stink.”
Cas closes his eyes against the memories of that night, the night that changed everything for Dean and Sam but also himself. The night he realized he’d do anything for Dean and there truly exists no lines he will not cross.
Dean was struck almost euphoric by the news of Sam and Eileen’s engagement.
“You started it,” Dean mumbles.
Dean takes that second and kisses Cas with it.
“Cas, stop! Just
“What’s so goddamn funny?”
Cas morphs his expression into an amused one to lighten the mood for his friend who doesn’t appear ready to take another hit right now. Cas isn’t entirely sure what Dean is upset about—perhaps the fact that he enjoyed their kiss isn’t particularly welcoming—but Cas is sure he can wheedle the specifics out of Dean as always with some light humor.
“I doubt that very much,” Dean grouses under his breath.
Meg glares at him. His hands fly up as a barricade between them.
The damaged look Dean affects is what pauses him.
Cas fights against an emerging smirk, Dean can tell.
“Stop it, Dean!”
make me do this again. Look. You two are…good together. Just—just go talk to him, alright?”
He didn’t dodge it with Cas.
Cas’ pulse elevates. He breathes deep to prevent an oncoming adrenaline attack, because no, it can’t be, his wildest dreams, the wants he’s tempered down all this time—
Cas shrugs. “Well…”
It feels like that but if the butterflies had razors for wings. It feels like jubilation but also alarm because now that he has the human he loves wrapped around him, he could also lose him at any moment.
“What?” Dean blurts.
“I’m here to take you home,” Dean murmurs next to his ear. Castiel smiles, and he’s sure it’s a goofy one because he’s too drunk to care. He’s too inebriated to quell his desire to be near Dean.
“But you’re straight,” squeaks Garth in confusion.
It anchors something inside Dean, tethers him to his boyfriend, to the fact that he even has a boyfriend instead of the girlfriend. The pressure of Cas’ palm against his makes it feel okay.
“Christmas,” Cas says happily, even though it’s past midnight and already, technically, Christmas.
"You aren't using that correctly."
“Dean—”
“You breathe!”
Cas mimics him. Dean crosses his legs. Cas does too.
“How are you feeling?”
“Tell me about it,” Dean says, “worst idea ever.”
“Right, shall we head over?” are the first words Dean has spoken to him since their fight.
“Can I ask why you guys did that to Lisa?” Eileen asks after one too many fortuitous minutes of quietude. “Are you really breaking up with her, Dean, and it was an easy out that you didn’t think through? Or—or some prank I don’t understand again like at Sam’s bachelor party? I just…want to understand.”
“Sammy, dad’s probably passed out in his own piss right now.”
Benny glares at him so mightily that Dean shies his own eyes away. “Do you know how frustrating it’s been, watching you two dance around each other all these years? Do you? Do you know how many times we’ve wanted to just lock you two in a room until you either humped or realised you could be doing exactly that because you both have feelings for each other? There was one time in college where Rowena almost trapped you in an elevator together. It was very dangerous. I stopped her. You’re welcome.”
“Yeah?” Dean mimics Cas with a tip of his own head to the side, hoping he accomplishes at least a shard of the cuteness that it adorns Cas with. “You happy to stay my boyfriend for a bit then, hot stuff?”
Cas makes sure to train his eyes on the tumbler glass in his hands and not at Dean’s jutted lips.
“Okay. You don’t ever have to do or say anything you don’t want to. At least not with me, anyway.” Castiel shrugs.
“She thought we were in love,” Cas says flatly, “before this idiotic scheme even commenced.”
Like that, Dean convulses into howling laughter and it makes his head throb a little stronger but it’s worth it because of the absolute look of betrayal and menace on Cas’ face.
“Um—hi,” replies a man’s voice who is decidedly not Cas. “I found your boyfriend’s phone on him after he went behind the bar and threw up everywhere. He’s pretty drunk, man. You should probably come get him.”
“No,” mumbles Sam, “very hungover though. I also feel like shit about how I was last night.”
“Yes,” his voice drops to a despondent whisper, “I suppose I am a very good liar.”
check out Cas’ ass.”
Dean squirms, and when he can find his voice, he gasps, “what the fuck, Cas?”
Benny is looking at him with narrowed eyes. “Is this another one of your stupid pranks?”
“Practice?”
Dean without hesitation drops his internal war and angles his head towards Cas. His reddened eyes, creased with anger and hate, now softens. His lips tremble. He bows his head.
“About that...” Dean begins awkwardly, thinking this is a good a segue as any. “We actually are now. Boyfriends, that is.”
"Then a few months later, oh, we've just been a bit too close all this time and that’s what messed with our heads during our simultaneous mid-life crisis. It’ll be a funny story that comes up when everyone gets a bit drunk in ten years time at a disastrous Christmas party."
“But I can’t fix the knots in your soul,” Cas continues regretfully, “I wish I could, but all I can do is be here and lend you my hand through the trek. I realise now that your heart is not mine to seize or to mend. Your heart is yours and you need to look after it the way you need to take your own showers, brush your own teeth, and chew your own food. I’ll always do anything for you, Dean, but in order for that to be sustainable, I can’t do everything for you—and I…I need to care for myself before I can care for you too.”
“Shit,” he curses beneath his breath.
“Hey,” she chirps, smiling at him sweetly, “and...Cas. Hey,” her voice drops an octave as she addresses his best friend. So does her smile. She does this a lot. It’s one of the few reasons Dean has identified as to why she never clicked.
“I’m doing a lot of things now,” Cas admits quietly. “Human…pretty much.”
“But now that we both acknowledge it was weird, it’s not weird.”
“Yeah?” Dean’s definitely starting to lose his happy drunk high. There’s an argumentative edge to his voice that is ascending quickly. “What lines are those?”
When Dean and Cas approach, Sam glances briefly at their interlaced hands.
“Thank you, but for tonight I would like to look a little better than fine.”
“To die.”
Dean drinks some more of the milkshake. It’s growing on him, and he stops only when there’s less than half left so he can pass the rest to Cas.
Cas hums, taps on Baby’s dashboard absentmindedly. “I don’t mind not having a bauble.”
one of these days.”
“Are you okay for us to leave you with your boyfriend now?” The pretty blonde waitress asks. She looks like Dean’s type. Cas grumbles his assent to her and waves both her and the other man away. Then that word clocks at him again.
When they step out the car, Dean’s fingers drift towards Cas’ and they clutch at each other once more as they make their way down the steps of the bunker.
“May I enquire as to why you are both...extremely inebriated, considering you two have work tomorrow and as far as I remember, there are no special occasions or something to mourn?”
They fall into a tranquility they’ve not experienced once today.
He left his cereal bowl, Dean thinks numbly, then asks Cas without thinking or looking at him, “you’re still talking to that guy?”
“Dean—”
“It is…” Castiel peers at the grandfather clock installed towards the room’s corner. “Almost seven in the evening.”
Maybe whatever happened last night makes them okay now—or as okay as they can be for the time being. Maybe they can go to the diner again, and Castiel can buy Dean a pie, and they can sit and watch television tonight, like they used to, where they’d take a few hours off from the strain of their lives and responsibilities to the world.
They sing along to Dean’s mixtape, the one Cas apparently carries in his trench-coat pocket, a revelation that makes Dean turn even darker red—probably the shade of a beetroot now.
“When you wake up?”
A dark liquid fire touches him, reaches over and consumes half of Cas’ shoulder.
“Sam. Stop.”
Dean waits mutely.
“I wanted to call time-out back at the yoga studio with Lisa!”
Dean makes a low, threatening noise and smacks at his friend’s limbs. “Off. Now.”
His slip is met with silence.
“Fucking fantastic.”
Castiel’s head’s spinning, both from his hangover and from the conversation currently taking place. He’s about fifteen different kinds of confused right now.
, “I believe I warned you several times not to sleep with one of your employees, and especially not to involve yourself so much in her child’s life."
“All you did was show us both how weird things could get.”
“Is this a fight? Are we in a fight?”
“What?” Dean balks. “Come on, man, I’ve taken all my outside clothes off. It’s not like my boxers are dirty! I’m so tired and I feel gross and sad.”
“Benny, you’ve gotta listen, man. Shit.” He pulls one hand from the steering wheel and rakes it across his head in a nervous gesture. “I’m in real deep shit. Out of all this—I—it’s gotten complicated. I think I like him.”
“You’re sleeping now?” Sam asks, brows knitted in concern.
Coming around in circles, Dean and Castiel struggle to find their footing.
Tracing a classmate’s freckles probably comes under the same vein as asking his mother if lipstick was really necessary because
The park is as quiet and empty as the road had been on their drive over.
“Then you went and made it with
Dean’s head swivels so fast towards Cas that he feels a definite pull of muscle.
her!”
“Oh,” Cas repeats, stilling. He blushes. “You’re stupid too,” he goads back, but mumbles it.
Cas pauses with a foot into the room.
“Hey, Dean,” Eileen says, head cocked, smirking at him. She doesn’t say the next bit, but she signs it.
“What can I say, man? Not really feeling super with it today, I guess,” Dean mutters, sliding into his seat and igniting the engine.
“I would
“—tease him—”
Castiel wakes first, wiping at the drool on his cheek that is definitely not his.
“They
A thrill hits his stomach, serrated and thrashing. He wonders if this is what humans talked about when they compare joyous stomach troubles to that of the flutter of butterflies.
“Yes.”
sorry, before Dean could even realise—
Then he stops. “Shit. You’re home.”
Dean splutters. Cas suddenly appears to find a spot on their wall very interesting.
“For fuck’s sake! Well, we’re here now! What do you want to do, sunshine?”
“Did you have to work Christmas Eve when you were—you know—when I didn’t let you stay,” he forces the words out, revelling in the punishing punch to his gut. He definitely deserves to be as miserable as that rude cashier on a night like this, not cosy in his chest with the love of his life next to him.
He once distractedly shoulders into Castiel in the cafeteria, after stealing a candy bar from the vending machine by punching a random set of numbers and shouldering hard into that too. He mutters a fumbled apology to Castiel without seeing him. Clever, resourceful, and civil despite his troublemaking streak.
It’s like a cavity that’s been rotting away inside of him falls out along with that one apology. Vanished away with some glorious kind of spellwork. Three words, and poof.
“Right, Cas,” Benny says tiredly, “let’s get ourselves home, shall we?”
Castiel is the something that always goes wrong.
“Don’t do that!” Cas smacks Dean on the nose as if he were a poorly trained puppy. “You know I don’t like being bitten!”
“What are you doing?” Cas mocks more than asks, looking both perplexed and discomfited by the gesture.
“Keep the car,” John says coolly. “Just don’t let me see you and your boyfriend near my sight again. I’ll wring both your necks, starting with his so you can watch.”
He thinks about how Sam must hate Dean and Cas’ knotty and convoluted entanglement and its consequences. To Dean and Cas, it’s easy, and happy, and pleasant. To everyone else, he’s mildly aware of how annoying and strange it can be. Right now, Sam probably hates it a little more than Dean hates himself, but probably still less than how much dad would hate Dean and Cas if they’d gotten together for real.
Cas sucks in a terrified shot of air.
It goes on like this for the next hour, with Dean and Cas wedged next to each other on a too-small couch, shifting on their bottoms awkwardly as Sam bumbles around the room, cleaning up Jenga pieces they’ve abandoned on the floor, burning their popcorn twice, and setting up a movie Dean supposes they’re all going to watch together now.
“Cas,” he intones and jabs his head in the direction of ‘away from here.’ “Got something to support me with here, remember? Can we, you know...”
“Come on, say it. Everyone’s dead and gone, there’s a pretty big chance we’ll be too, so what—“
“Stop saying you panicked!”
“I don’t believe it was wise for you to drink alcohol along with your breakfast,” Cas grumbles, “or objectify women like that even if you are feeling tipsy. You’re better than that.”
“Yeah, yeah,
“Yes, Dean, please stop,” Benny drones, sighs, and takes a sip of his beer.
Dean’s smacked straight back into what he’d forgotten for five minutes this morning. Their stupid lie. It’s slowly derailing Dean. He’s got a fair guess as to why he’s secretly looking forward to all they’re going to get to do to pretend that they’re together.
“Hey,” Dean swings to open his arms wide and flash a swaggering grin at Cas. “We gotta flesh this out now, right? The best artists come up with their best works under the influence.”
Shit, it’s so domestic that he reels from it, the mundanity of his desires.
“That’s dark.”
“I know who I am,” Dean insists, stepping forward, crowding Cas into the wall. “I might stumble sometimes, for a little bit, while I’m finding my footing on this, but I,” he reaches out to whisk a hand down Cas’ bicep, stroking. “I know what I want.”
Cas bristles, squeezes Dean’s hand again, but with indignation now. “I don’t appreciate you deriding my intelligence, Dean, as I am definitely
Dean throws his hands in the air with defeat. Three for three in one day. Picture-perfect timing. Today has just been one long terrible 80s movie, and Dean’s sure that if Cas and he were two seconds away from kissing, someone would interrupt that as well.
That hits a little too close to home and Dean laughs in a little too high a pitch in response. “That—no—that would be a bit too ridiculous even for me. No. We—er—we actually are. Together. Now.” He rubs his hands nervously forwards and backwards on his jeans. “Um.”
“I’m your designated driver. I’ve had one beer.”
Cas is swaying his head back and forth like he can’t understand what’s happening. There’s frown lines between his eyebrows, but his lips are also quivering like he’s either about to cry or smile.
When he looks at Dean’s slumbering face, all worry lines smoothened, lips parted, expression peaceful, Cas knows for certain now what he’s been feeling for the past four years. It’s something that will live inside him for the rest of his life.
When everything is gone, all the liquor and his fury and his—just Cas, he’s back in the kitchen to take whatever alcohol is left. Might as well save himself the back-and-forth trips, he thinks, feeling clever for chucking all the beers and a bottle of whiskey into a plastic bag he finds lying around.
Dean puffs out a spurt of air. “Yeah. Right. He’s just caught us...doing what we were doing not even for show, but in the comfort of your bed. Even if we called it off now, he’s not going to believe that we’re still just friends.”
. He’s fine there too.
“Don’t be stupid, Dean. I ain’t judgin’,” Bobby says.
Then he sighs and kicks at the leg of a table.
Their words overlap and Cas tilts his head in question of Dean. “Isn’t the bed a little too...intimate for practice?”
Dean had reached for the whiskey bottle immediately in Cas’ silence, and Cas, too eagerly, joined him in their shared shitty habit of burying feelings. They had sat beside each other, neither one uttering a noise other than the gulping of liquor.
"Dean needed a drinking partner,” utters Cas as his excuse, head bowed in shame as he shuffles upright.
“Oh.” Cas’ face heats up. He swallows thickly to prod away the knot in his throat.
“Good.”
“I have a date,” Cas simply repeats, as if Dean merely didn’t hear him the first time. As if Dean isn’t being pulled apart inside like a toy for toddlers, parts broken and smashed and separated and torn.
Cas’ palms bead with sweat.
He wanted to kiss Cas. He tried to kiss Cas. He…wants Cas.
He’d like to be able to reach out and fluff Cas’ hair, hug his waist, kiss his cheek in the difficult mornings they’re all going to have to face.
“Not enough,” grumbles Dean into the scruff at Cas’ jaw. “It’s never enough.”
Cas is an extremely good liar, it turns out. The look of utter adoration he’s receiving is what Dean knows he’ll drown in for days. Maybe the rest of his life.
“Why would I do that?” Cas says with genuine interest. “The bunker is a classified space. Do you bring random women back here?”
They’re at the point now where they don’t pretend like they don’t hear each other so Dean agrees, “yeah.”
There’s something he knows is quivering below the surface, all wrapped up in telling Cas that Cas is the thing that goes wrong, telling Cas to answer his goddamn messages and nothing else, him letting Cas leave, them not talking about it, him asking Cas about Sam but not Cas himself, Sammy, his baby brother, who he’s supposed to look after and he’s failing spectacularly at that again, God being back in the game again, losing mom again, Jack, Charlie, Kevin, Bobby, Jo, Ellen, every goddamn person he couldn’t protect, and now the world is coming to an end again—and—and fuck. They’re going to go eat pancakes and bacon.
“Not as much as saying it myself.” It’s quiet and, not exactly uncomfortable, but Dean feels nauseous until Cas comes up with, “I’m pretty sure felt writing instruments are more permanent than paint anyways. Paint chips.”
While Dean fondly twines his fingers with Cas’, Sam glares at Eileen’s lowered head as she nibbles on her cookie silently. Wen she glances back up, she offers him an impish look that makes his body sag because—yeah, Dean knows that feeling—Sammy’s already given up on the pretence of being mad at her.
“Cas,” Dean calls, before Cas can exit with Sam’s clothes piled in his arms. He almost pleads with him to not do this. Instead, he says, “Sam’s shirt on you will just make you look like you’re wearing a friggin’ dress. Take something of mine.”
“Sam did briefly think we were a couple when he was younger,” Cas cuts in nonchalantly, rescuing Dean from his verbal traffic. “You shut it down rather quickly. It likely stopped him from ever considering the possibility of you and I together romantically. It isn’t his fault that it became a non-subject over the years…and also, you aren’t actually—um—”
, Dean?” Cas interrupts quietly.
“Pretty,” he hums, dropping his hand and slumping into Dean once more. He doesn’t wait for Dean’s response, because right now, from the side, Dean looks a little stunned. He asks again, “Why are you here?”
He catches Cas’ cheek instead, because Cas turns, just as quickly as Dean fell forwards.
He sets the phone aside and decides to ignore the message. It’s nothing even remotely as troubling as the Apocalypse 2.0 or losing Jack, his wings, his grace, and his camaraderie with Dean. This, he could take, with a granule of rock salt.
“I’m not upset,” Dean says in his most casual voice, shrugging, “but if I were to be, it might have something to do with that waitress flirting with you and you thanking her for it. I dunno. Just a thought. Bit weird to let someone flirt with you while you’re on a date.”
“Shit,” Cas shouts, and crawls over to where Dean is hissing and grasping the back of his skull in pain. “Shit, are you okay?”
“Of course.”
“I suppose so,” Cas bites his lip, looking bashful for some goddamn reason. Dean’s going to be kissing those lips soon.
“I can’t believe this,” Dean shakes his head, gnawing at his lips, “She’s never going to buy this. You acted like a fucking alien out there! More than usual! Have you ever met a human being before? Who talks like that? We were supposed to be leaving, Cas. This was a bad idea. What—what the
“Yup,” he responds, popping the P.
“Because if not now then when, Sam? In case you haven’t noticed, we might not have much time left, alright?” he shouts. “Did you know that I almost lost him today? Again? And here’s the kicker, the son’uva bitch told me he loved me. Me. The things he said...I...never has there been anyone loves me like he does, alright? I don’t think I’ve felt good about myself, talk openly like this, and be honest to you in a really long time. Cas helps me with that. He...he’s special to me, alright?” He’s heaving when he’s done, defensive and there’s that anger again. Directed at who, at what, he doesn’t even know anymore.
“Benny, I swear to god—”
Dean rolls his eyes, and as he turns, he bumps straight into Benny.
He marches towards his car with Cas’ hand still gripped tight in his. His nostrils are still flaring and his breathing is still heavy when he starts the ignition. Cas misses Dean’s hand in his when they let go. Dean uses that same hand to smack furiously at the wheel.
“Wow. Really, Dean?”
“What? Cas, no—”
“It’s bullshit! Eileen’s name was on one? Really? I’ve never seen her name spelt out like that in my entire life! I’ve also never met another Dean, by the way!” Dean yells, though he’s starting to deflate in his ire.
After that finale, though, yikes.
“In here?”
“Well,” Dean flails, voice high, “that’s a damn lie. Anyone would look. It doesn’t mean I want to bang him or anything. He’s objectively a very attractive guy.”
“I’m gonna get dressed. You’ll…wait here?” Dean asks to a suddenly bewildered looking Cas.
“I was referencing your savagery, sharp teeth, and oh—you’re a fucking mean beast. Also, I’m running out of puns.”
Ash shrugs. “I thought it was maybe an open relationship type thing, until you guys settled down and adopted or something. I figured that’s why you hate Meg so much.”
“Ow,” he mutters.
“Jesus, Sam. Don’t creep up on a guy like that. What, now I gotta teach you too about this?”
Cas starts to laughs with them.
This elicits a round of laughter from the table. Dean balks. “We didn’t do anything! We just slept!”
Dean glowers at him, feeling called out. He’s finally willing to recognise some truth in these aspersions, but that doesn’t mean he appreciates it being vocalised and shared to all public ears.
“I think they think that the more time they spend with us as a couple, the easier it will be for them to wrap their head around it.” He pauses to yawn loudly. It sets off a sleepy, snuffling noise from Cas that tightens Dean’s chest with fondness. “I think Sam’s also doing the whole atonement routine where he needs to make up for not catching on earlier to the fact that I—that I’m—” Dean stops and chokes on the term, having never fully considered the validity of it until now.
Thank you for anyone that takes the time to read and comment. I appreciate all feedback or even just any general support group complaining we got going on 😂
After his outburst, Cas waited for Dean to respond with anything but an open-mouthed stare. He remained there for a few seconds before storming out, only to be found by the Impala in the parking lot, leaning against it, cross-armed. Dean couldn’t think of anything to say and clearly Cas hadn’t either, because they had both gotten in and maintained an oath of silence up until now.
“She’ll only get the wrong idea,” Dean argues.
...but I guess now this is a Part 1 Part 2 scenario because I ended up fleshing it out way more than originally planned
“Exactly,” Eileen agrees, offering him an encouraging smile. It’s softer now. Dean sighs.
Castiel hasn’t felt this ill since his hangover.
“Oh, come on. You love that movie,” Dean says close to Cas’ ear. His face twitches and he looks away to deny Dean the satisfaction of his mirth which only heightens said satisfaction. Dean throws his head back and emits a boisterous laugh.
His hand is looped cautiously at the crook of Dean’s elbow and he looks like he’s about to pass out— or pass back into reality from a fever dream.
“My mother is home tonight, Dean. She won’t—she won’t be okay with it, you remember what she’s like. I had to tell her I was visiting Gabe at college this weekend. Is there anywhere else we can go? Bobby’s?”
“Great.”
“Dean!”
“He doesn’t—” Dean shakes his head. “He doesn’t feel that way about me. He’s straight.”
She lethargically rolls her eyes and shoves her way past Cas, past Dean, past Benny, and finally past their sight.
He moves away slightly only so he can see Cas’ face more clearly. “Yeah?”
, man?”
“Come on, brother, I know you can do it.”
“Go home, Benny. I’ve already got a ride,” Cas says over his shoulder with a reassuring smile.
“I believe that’s what landed you in your current predicament,” says Cas with a hint of a smirk, “your appreciation of bendy women.”
“Why the hell would I want to do that?”
Dean goes to cradle Cas’ cheek without sitting, startling him, making his cheeks flush, the heat pouring from his skin like lava.
The faucet turns off. Cas rushes to huddle Sam onto his shoulders, with Sam only blearily nodding along to their routine.
Hence, April.
Dean laughs. That’s good. Then, oh. It registers with Castiel, belatedly again, that this isn’t one of Dean’s good laughs. This is Dean’s ‘everything hurts too much but I don’t want to cry’ laugh.
fuck-up,” Cas retorts, affronted.
“All I meant to say is that he won’t have to look at us any differently because we’ve been the same as we always are, and we will continue to be what we’ve always been. Sam will see that.”
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas questions him with narrow-eyed concern and goes to place his towel on the rack. “You’ve said before that it’s less awkward if we just talk about it.”
“I don’t hate myself,” Sam says gently, “but I do hate that I’ve not been a good brother to you lately. Not even a good friend.” He takes a swig of his drink—Dean realises it’s not even beer, but pear cider today, something Sam bought for Eileen. “I’ve been all caught up in making sure she’s real, you know? That she’s really back. That I can hold her, and laugh with her, and read up on cases with her. And with everything else going on, with Cas being back and falling as well, I guess I started to turn a blind eye to you. I’m sorry.” Because of course, Sam has no trouble saying the words I’m sorry.
They’re making out like horny virgins against a wall when they hear a soft and surprised little, “oh.”
“I’m still here.” Cas smiles.
The weightiest difference is that he’s pretty sure he’s never kissed anyone he’s been this in love with.
“Thought you’d bring your date back.”
care about April and he
“Oh, well, of course. Whatever Dean needs, right?”
Cas’ dream fizzles with a painful spark. “Ah.”
“You’re braver than you think, okay?”
!” he assures her clamorously, revolving out the door as he speaks.
“You know, you didn’t really say much back there,” Dean remarks, falling into step with Bobby as he heads towards his truck.
For all their falsified detective work, the investigative hunting, the constant vigilance against a world full or horrors and hazard, Sam Winchester is really an unobservant little shit today.
“Fine, fine,” Dean waves a hand dismissively but places it on Cas’ neck afterwards. He rubs circles there, thrilled he’s able to just do this now. “I love you.”
“Me! I’ve made you my chicken alfredo many times! You said you loved the additions of onions, mushrooms, and—”
“Wait. Wait. Hold on.
“Maybe we should practice,” he blurts. Oh, fucking shit.
“Hmm.”
“Not like that.”
Dean tries to steady his breathing.
Dean’s unfazed. His jaw tenses, his eyes grow cold. “Thought you said you didn’t meet anyone. Thought you said, nobody you wanted to be with like that.”
Dean’s nausea quivers beneath a carefully controlled surface.
“Let’s go, Dean,” Cas quietly implores.
“Yeah, stupid,” Dean kicks at the scuff on his shoe like he’s thirteen and not scraping mid-forties.
Dean’s head snaps back so fast that he reckons he’s pulled a ligament. “What?”
Bobby dabs at the spilt water around Garth with some napkins, frowning, at what exactly, Dean wasn’t too sure.
“I’m a little sleepy from breakfast. I’m going to go lie down, if that’s alright,” Cas announces, giving Sam another smile, but not Dean.
Dean wonders whether his soul burned to Cas as brightly as the blue of Cas’ eyes and the fullness of his lips and the gumminess of his big grins and the comfort of his embrace and—
“Hello Sam,” Cas greets way too collectedly.
!” Cas cries as she uses their interlocked hands to smack him upside the head in a brutal wallop. “What was that for?” he demands, betrayed.
It’s only slightly forced.
“You—” he pauses to try and sound less dejected. “You’re a really good liar, you know. You almost had me believing all that. I never realised you could lie like that, ever. I—I guess good job. Well done.”
“I think Sam and Eileen are awake. I hear them pottering around outside,” Cas mumbles against Dean’s shoulder now, face inching down to smush flat against the fabric of his shirt.
He almost says it. He almost tells him. He parts his lips and no sound comes out but he wills it too and it almost does until Cas’ face morphs from wonder to a sort-of frown. The latter expression morphs just as quick as the first did into something different, cheery and friendly, and he stands, moves away from Dean.
“What about just throughout the day?”
“No, I—” he purses his lips. “I need to…shower. I feel grimy from being outside. Then I need to get some reading done. Completely forgot. Sorry.” His tone is stilted, his words artificial, as if he’s plucking them blindly from the air. “Raincheck? We can watch the movie tonight instead.”
“I apologise,” Cas says robotically, “I didn’t mean to make you ill at ease. Personal space. I get it.”
Dean watches as Sam’s mouth parts slightly and his cheeks brighten in colour and he nods—with poorly concealed subtlety—at Eileen. Sam then turns to Dean with a look that resembles a moose caught in headlights.
Dean hates this. He hates this touchy-feely crap, especially when he knows where it’s going.
“Billie’s dead. Guess we have a lot to catch up on, a lot to mourn,” Dean snorts, bleary-eyed. He’s thinks he’s blurred by tears that haven’t spilled. “The Empty is gone for now. If we can’t beat Chuck—“
It’s cute. He loves teasing Cas, especially when he’s human enough to react so vividly.
“Why—why would you—” Dean’s voice cracks and he has to cough to cover it up. “Why would you want that?” he asks, his anger bleeding out into raw hurt.
“I love you,” Dean sings saccharinely.
“Sorry. Only got two queens, no cot. Friday night...this place kind of turns into—um—”
“What the fuck just happened?” Cas yells.
Then Cas shakes his head. “Thank you, but I only came to gather the clothes Sam said he’d set aside for me. I think he didn’t want me going into his bedroom without supervision. I’ve been known to pick up the human things I find interesting and put them back where they don’t belong. He lost his shaving foam and still blames me for it. I swear I put it back in his laundry hamper, where all the bathroom things go,” he babbles.
“You know, we should just get married for a laugh. Like at Sam’s bachelor party, I mean. It’ll be hilarious. He’d lose his shit and that would really be a night to remember. Everyone else is married. You and I…should…um…just—”
“Love you?” Benny’s voice peals through his mortified reverie. “What’s up with that? Is that how you two end phone calls now?”
“You should have moved in with her.”
It’s funny that this relief is only brought on by a different layer of pretending.
“Isn’t as permanent, Sammy,” Dean declares with a casual tip of the head, already halfway down the hallway with a dumbfounded Cas on his arm.
“Dean, I didn’t. I’m pretty sure I just talked to some people. I don’t know why you’re getting upset, especially when it’s not really any of your business who I—”
Dean gasps in half a breath of unhinged laughter. “I think I’m fine, but I’m only, like, sixty-two percent sure. A lot—a lot’s happened. I’m not even sure this isn’t all a fever dream.”
Eileen sighs with a modicum of exasperation but also relief.
They mumble their goodbyes and Dean rolls off back in the direction of home in an agitated temper.
“Casdean?”
“So...you forgot the mushrooms after all.”
“Stop pouting,” says Cas, still not looking at Dean.
“Oh. I—me too, I suppose.” Cas returns to his book, though his eyes don’t dart from word to word on the pages. He seems caught in his own thoughts. He’s biting his lip. His ears have pinkened at its edges.
Benny closes his eyes and claps his hands together in a prayer gesture. “Hallelujah!”
enough for it to be picked up on by their close friend.
“You aren’t stupid. I had a nice time,” Cas says firmly, “I always enjoy our times together.”
“You’re always staring at him—”
The thumb that lingers on his face moves to his lips to quiet him, and then he replaces it by touching their mouths together again.
She’s still clasping onto Cas’ neck, but she’s moved far enough away that Cas can share a look of horror with Dean.
Sam concedes tentatively, patting Dean on the back and letting him know for the gazillionth time that he’s here for him. That if he ever needed to talk.
happy for my baby brother settling down with this kickass girl, but when I think about myself for a second—”
He circles around their street a few times, thrown between intermingled dread and delight. Eventually, Dean bites the bullet and gingerly pads inside his home.
John might have had more vitriol to expel. Cas supposes he’ll never know because Dean’s fist knocks powerfully into his father’s jaw, upending the man who then stumbles his way backwards. Off balance, he trips over his feet and ends up sprawled over the motel carpet.
“Dean, breathe.”
Dean’s hand slips from Cas’ face to drag along his chest.
“You’re heading over to the roadhouse to fix their sign after breakfast, aren’t you?”
“Maybe. I wouldn’t remember.”
“What time is it?” Dean asks, sounding crabbed once more. "Did we really just fucking nap through the day?”
He feels his best course of action is probably just to be honest. “I don’t really understand what’s going on right now, Dean,” he explains.
“No, it’s on us. It’s our mess,” Cas rectifies him. “I’m coming.”
“You want some breakfast?” Dean asks, gesturing at his bowl with his spoon. “I could whip you up some bacon and eggs, maybe some pancakes? Or you can have my cereal. This is already my second bowl,” he explains sheepishly.
“Yeah, well, I do,” Dean replies, clipped. Cas doesn’t answer so he heaves a regretful breath. “I just mean, it’s our first proper Christmas in…in a really long time. I want us all to be a family. Even the weird and dysfunctional one that we have right now. I don’t want anyone left out—and I—I’d like to hang my stupid fucking bauble next to yours, okay? Dean and Cas—or Dean and Castiel. It’s—”
“At least make sure that you drink all the water that’s in your water bottle today so you don’t become dehydrated.”
“Should I tell that hunter guy to piss off then? Now that you’ve found your one true love and everything,” Sam says, loopy. “You must’a had a good date. Dude won’t shut up about you. Says you’re a right great kisser, so, good for Dean, right?” He grins.
“And what feeling is that?”
He must have fallen half-asleep. He blinks a few times to clear his eyes, but his vision remains blurred and he’s feeling a little dizzy too and oh—he’s still drunk. It reminds him of that time he drank the entirety of the liquor store and he giggles to himself. Back then, he drank because he couldn’t find God. Now he’s drunk and he wishes God never showed up to, as they say, ‘the party.’ There’s nothing he wishes more.
“Surprise, Dean! You’ve been laying kisses on me since we were teenagers and—and stripping in front of me and wrestling me and
Benny raises an eyebrow at Dean as if challenging him to deny it.
“They won’t have paint.”
“You’re going to have to look at me when you say it then.”
“Idjit. Ask him, he’ll tell you.”
Dean’s legs are tossed over Cas’ lap while they binge a Dr. Sexy marathon.
Then his eyes blow up with panic. “Oh my god, are you dying?”
“Nice,” Cas finishes, smiling off into the distance as he stares out the window. He traces sundry lines across the condensation. “Nice and human,” he repeats quietly, probably to himself.
“Um—” Sam looks to Eileen for help.
“My dad ain’t around much and my mum’s...not around at all. I pretty much just live in a motel room by myself, me and my little brother. Why’d you think I don’t even have a permission slip?” he says bitterly, picking at the loose threads on the hem of his overlong shirt.
“It’s not my place to say.”
Cas would have much preferred a physical punch to his gut.
“I don’t understand how you got me to say yes to this,” mutters an ashen-faced Cas.
“Dean, are you okay? You look like—I don’t know—there’s a bloody handprint on your jacket, by the way. That doesn’t seem good either...”
“Didn’t I just say don’t be stupid?” Bobby mutters, smacking Dean affectionately on the arm. “You really think you gettin’ with Cas would ever be a problem for me or anyone else who loves you? Has that been what’s stopping you all this time?”
“Ten,” Cas says breathlessly from beneath him and Dean bounds off him so fast he knocks his head on the edge of the coffee table.
“I prefer less dumb. Less ass.”
“Shit, we’re just gonna stay here. He’s done. I’m not moving him.”
They sit like that for a little while, Castiel with one hand on Dean’s arm, like that day at the staircase, and at some point, his hand slides down to rest on top of Dean’s hand.
“I’ve been a shitty brother,” Sam declares one night when they’re watching TV, enjoying a beer each. For Sam, it’s to unwind at the end of another long day of research. For Dean, it’s to get through the night.
“Hey!” Dean shrieks, flapping his hands at Cas berserkly. “You said you wouldn’t bring that up again!”
He isn’t surprised when he hears Dean shout instead, “
“If there’s something we should talk about, it’s you,” Dean grits out. “I’d like to talk about why you’re so unaffected. I’m not the one acting weird here. You—you’re weird for being so fine.”
“Dean…”
“Hm?”
The Empty screeches behind.
“Meg seems to like me just fine,” Cas throws in a little spitefully, a lot out of character.
“Fabulous? You know, keep talking like that and you’re gonna be fabulous at the gay thing.” Dean waggles his brows suggestively.
"You can’t—I—you’re not even going to give me time? I just—I just need some time, man. If you loved me, you’d—Cas…” He slumps forward. He doesn’t even mean to.
“Or you know,” Dean quickly interjects. “I’ve gotten pretty used to not being alone in bed. It’s...nice. You could still—if you want—”
“And what about Meg—”
“Your girlfriend—I’m sorry,
“Oh, so you agree? You think you’re hot stuff?”
“Whoa!” Dean tumbles backwards, dumbstruck. “That is
Cas stares back at Dean, gaze a little empty.
“—and you said you’d wear protective gear the next time around. Now do you have safety goggles or not?”
“Um—sorry—no…not that.”
“Oh my God,” Dean rubs a hand down his face. “Of course I’m not! I just—I’m not that way.”
“No!” Benny turns back around so he can point an accusatory finger at Dean. “One big reveal is all the energy I have to crack out of you today. I’m not doing this one too. Let me out. I’m going home.”
“Why are we still walking towards—”
Cas nods mutely and turns to follow Dean.
!” Dean shouts over his shoulder, ensuring April hears him.
“Do you not remember me trying to have a conversation with you about this?”
Dean sighs, rubs his eyes with his free hand. The other remains tightly gripped onto Cas’.
“Something on your mind?” Benny asks as he settles himself into the car. He stretches out comfortably, feet propping on Baby’s upholstery, one arm plastering against his side of the window.
“—and I just think it’s a beautiful start to the tale of our epic love that nobody would ever question. We’ve been joined at the everything since then and I know it sounds a little crazy at first, but—”
, and,” he pauses, embarrassed, “I don’t really know anything much else about the guy.” He shrugs. “Just overhear you sometimes when you talk in your sleep. Cute. Spouting off about french philosophers though? Nerd.”
“I wouldn’t do that,” Dean insists, eyes fluttering, sticking from the dampness of faint tears. “You really think I would do that? Fuck, have I really been that awful to you?” He presses one hand to Cas’ chest and grips his shirt into a fist.
The next few days are hell, and Dean’s not exaggerating, because he’s literally been and the only difference is that Hell is warmer. Well, that, and the physical torture. Mentally, however, Dean is wrecked. He’s drinking more every day, he’s sleeping less, and when he does, he’d be lucky if the alcohol makes him pass out so thoroughly that his nightmares don’t make an appearance.
“You ruined our wedding,” he bemoans into an empty tumbler, “and now you guys are fucking with Lisa, saying you’re in love and together and—” he waggles a hand dismissively at them, “—and all that shit. I don’t know what you’re doing, but it’s mean again.”
Cas is tugged forward by the sheer thrill of their equally heated stares interlocking.
“Yes, you are,” Castiel says. “You should go to sleep.”
It doesn’t cool even when he’s under the spray of a cold shower. It’s only when he’s fully dressed that his racing pulse calms, and even then he is still overthinking the components of sex and Cas together, unused to the idea of the two concepts intertwined in a real and authentic way. It’s not as if he’s never entertained the idea as a joke or talked about it in jest many times before. It’s not even as if he’s unfamiliar these days to the idea of wanting Cas. Having it vocalised, however, was too close to manifesting something.
“Maybe.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? Really?
Dean shrugs. It’s a forced gesture, but he’s obviously trying emulate the nonchalance of it in his heart. “Who cares?”
He’s already out the bedroom door April was leaving through not too long ago. “I’d message her now if I were you. Give her a heads up.”
? You knew? Knew what? That I was gay?”
I really couldn’t decide which type of trauma to stick with, so I guess that’s this chapter
His hand presses into Dean’s chest, that same spot he pressed by the stairs that day, right where Dean’s heart is.
“I told you I don’t like it when you bite me!”
“I thought...” Cas begins, his expression transforming again into something slightly forlorn, “I thought you’d have a problem with my vessel. I’d always thought maybe, just maybe, if I had ended up occupying a female body, that you would—“
Castiel nods complacently, placing his rejected apple into a ziplock bag. “Have you just moved here? I’ve never seen you in class.”
Dean nods, though Cas can’t see him. Dean gulps, and hopes Cas can’t hear him.
“Oh, please. I’ve woken up with you poking into my ass enough times to care more about you finishing my oatmeal.” Cas rolls off Dean then jabs a finger at his morning wood teasingly. Dean squeals like a little piglet and scrambles away so his back is to the wall.
The Empty spirals around Cas’ body in record time, erasing that smile.
“I was trying to show you how good you could have it,” Dean teases, lifting himself into a sitting position and posing to Cas his most charming smile. They’re facing each other, cross-legged, with Dean making kissy-faces and Cas glaring him down.
