John forced a smile. Apparently it'd been long enough to warrant him being safe with prescriptions again.

More nightmares. More anxieties. He didn’t want to get started fighting them yet. He watched Sherlock set himself to putting the beakers away, his

"Don't worry. I'll find him in minutes," Sherlock promised, moving across the room like he was readying to go out. "What's your dog's name?"

“No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is,” Moriarty added. John blinked again. Within two seconds the man had been both ruder and more charismatic than he'd ever expected. Nothing he'd imagined from the title 'consultant criminal' had played out predictably, except perhaps the close relationship to a homicide detective. Perhaps he was better off pretending to be daft.
John tipped his head back down on the couch armrest, Mike’s words crawling down his spine, and lifted his plate onto the coffeetable, his arm shaking. Pain

John tapped Sherlock's shoulder again.
John closed his eyes, gathering himself. Right. A fake suicide. Was he to lie about the death, for all their sakes, then? John started for the stairs.

John added, glaring at the man.
“I’d watch you shoot him and we’d move on,” he replied, yawning, and closed his eyes again. John laughed softly, chuckling into the dark, and to his surprise, kept giggling, a lightness ballooning up in his chest that he hadn’t felt in years. Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. John ran a hand over his stubbled face, reveling in the fact that they were alive, in 221B, in bed together.

“Did I get anything wrong?” Moriarty asked while John was painfully extricating himself from the cab. He sounded genuinely curious, a break from the past hour's unfettered arrogance.

"Yes, and?" Sherlock drawled. John sighed, giving up, and leaned back in his chair to grab a pen from Sherlock's desk.
Greg glanced over her, starting to get concerned. She looked so diminished without the two of them running around the lab, pulling crazy theories out of nothing. It was all too quiet now.

“Okay... How did you get this?” John winced on his way to sit down and Sherlock grimaced, looking more annoyed by his injury than by his question. Which perhaps made sense, given the man's intellect. Very few people, even well-established doctors, had any respect for psychosomatic pain.
