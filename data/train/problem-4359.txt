"Okay." Dean says, as he zips up the bag. "You guys are welcome to hang out if you want. I think Emma and I were just gonna watch a movie or something."
"Here you go, Dean." He hears, and is being handed his and Emma's bowls of ice cream when he turns around.
"Look, people want sex. They go out with me to get in my pants, we have sex, and they move on. I am well past the one night stand part of my life, but I get that some people aren't. We had sex, so you can move on. No hard feelings."
"No. No! I wont let it take you." Dean insisted, grabbing Cas' face and looking into his eyes. "I wont. I cant."
Sam and Dean sat there in silence for another moment, before Sam said "Dean, I'm sorry. I'm just really happy about this. I know you dont understand why yet, but if you'd spent the last eleven years watching your brother and your best friend pine for each other, then finally do something about it, you'd get it. Just... Dont ruin this. Cas has been very patient, and hes put up with a lot from you. You can be a dick, and you push people away for no good reason as soon as they try to get close. Dont do that to Cas. Just accept that you can be happy, and roll with it. That's the end of my speech, and I wont say any more about it unless you ask."
Cas willingly obliged this move, and, wanting to feel Dean's skin against his own again, he grabbed the back of Dean's shirt and ripped it completely down the back.
"What'd you mean?" Dean says, as he heads into the livingroom and flops down onto the couch. Avoidance is always Dean's best defense.
When he turns around, it's to a sight full of beautiful man and his daughter, and he can't help the surprised "Cas" that comes out of his mouth.
The day after Cas had shown up at Sam's, Dean forces himself out of bed, makes himself take a shower and gets dressed, and shuffles out to the kitchen. Sam's standing at the stove cooking something, and Dean slumps onto a stool at the island.
"You didn't attack me" Cas replies. He manages to turn his head away as he mumbles "and I wasn't saving myself."
The police take way too long to get there. In retrospect, it really isn't that long, but Dean's had enough of this. Enough blocking the door, enough of the asshole glaring at him, enough of being on this goddamn bus. His face hurts, he's still pissed as hell, and he just wants to go home.
Dean shivers in pleasure, pushing back against Cas more until his hard cock slips between Dean's thighs. Cas begins thrusting his hips in time with his hand, precum smoothing the way, and Dean groans, hand sliding back to tangle in Cas' hair.
After making coffee, he spends the morning scouring websites and emailing people. He finally gets a message back about something he really wants, and tells the man he can be there shortly.
Dean dropped his knife and wrapped his hands around the one sticking out of him. Unable to hold himself up any longer, he sank to his knees.
He feels the loss consume him, the need overwhelm him until it's hard to breathe. Dean is here, building him a fence. Why? God he's missed him. Just that one look, and all his feelings are at the forefront of his mind. It hurts.
"I'm making burgers, if you guys want to stay for lunch." He can't take the quiet anymore, and it would be weird to not invite them to stay since he was planning on making enough for Claire anyway. Who's he kidding, he always makes enough to feed at least six people. It has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he doesn't want Cas to go yet. The fact that he hasn't been in his presence in so damn long and he missed him, even though this is awkward and uncomfortable and about a thousand other things he can't name right now.
"She probably didn't recognize the sound of the truck. It's not like the Impala's." Cas replies, watching Dean watch the chicken check out her new home.
Emma bites her lip nervously, and shifts in her seat. "Some jerk kids were talking about her dad, some crap about him being gay, and she tore into them. It was awesome, dad. They had it coming."
Dean woke up with a start, out of an awful dream. He didn't remember much, just Cas walking away and the feeling of complete dispair that came with it.
"Well, it's customary for the person who asked for the date to pick up the other person at their house. But since I live here, I thought your room would suffice." Cas replied.
Once they're cleaned up, Cas heads downstairs to make coffee and Dean lays in a blissfully haze for a couple of minutes. Blissful until he remembers the last week, worry and frustration and misery washing over him. He lets himself feel it for a few minutes, then forces himself to push it all down and pastes a smile onto his face before making his way to the kitchen.
"Im pretty sure you have appendicitis." He says, and she just nods from her bent over position. "Alright, I need you girls to move this stuff out of the way so I can get her out of here." He says. "Emma, run downstairs and grab my phone off the coffee table, and my shoes from by the door."
Dean couldnt ever remember a time where he didnt mind not getting off. But right now, staring down at Cas' form, he really didn't. He felt amazing just from getting Cas off. He also felt something deep in his chest, something hed never felt before. A strong pulling feeling. And as Cas stared up into his eyes, what could only be described as butterflies started to dance around his stomach.
For AB, my own angel who helped me through some of the darkest times of my life. Our story didn't end the same way as theirs did, but I'll forever be grateful you were there.
When Gordon gets his meal set in front of him again, he cuts into it. Once again, Dean can see it's perfectly cooked, but Gordon sighs. "It's overcooked again, but I'll eat it. I don't want to make my date wait any longer, his food is probably cold by now."
Dean woke up slowly this time, realizing that, for the first time in a long time, he hadnt had a nightmare.
Dean looks at Gordon's steak, and it looks perfectly rare. He can see in Cas' face he thinks the same, but he quickly takes the plate, apologizes, and says he'll have it right back out.
His thrusts start slow, gentle, grinding into Dean, but he quickly picks up the pace, thrusting harder and faster. Sweat is dripping down his neck, Dean releasing small sounds of pleasure, incoherent words and Cas' name on his lips that send shocks of arousal to Cas' cock.
And Cas was not wrong. Three beers later, he and Dean had barely spoken five words to each other, each time they tried his attention was ripped away.
He laid back on the couch, kicking his feet up and resting his head on the arm of the couch. In this position, last night, he had gotten the closest to Dean hed ever been. He wanted that again. Not just the sexual part of it, though that was amazing. No, he wanted to hold Dean, for Dean to finally let his guard down and accept how Cas felt about him.
His pleasure is building, and he can't hold back. He's never been a sexual person, rarely even masturbating, as it never really brings him the kind of satisfaction it seems to bring other people. This is nothing like that. This feeling, overwhelming all consuming lust coursing through him, he wants it. He wants to feel what it would be like to orgasm with someone else, with Dean. All his trepidation pushed aside, he wants this.
The girls are looking at each other and grinning, and Dean turns back to grab the food with his own smile on his face. He lays the plates full of food out on the table, then takes his own seat.
Finally, Dean pulled back a little, and, looking into Cas' eyes, he said "I am so sorry Cas. Please forgive me."
"Cas, love you baby." Dean says into Cas' neck. "Missed you. Love you." As he presses more kisses to his skin and speeds up his thrusts.
Their voices move further away and Dean can't hear any more of what's said. Eventually, the front door clicks closed and the bedroom door opens a minute later.
Cas climbed back to his knees and lined himself up. Dean stared up into his blue eyes as he pushed forward, entering Dean with excruciating slowness.
He let's go of Dean and wipes his face, because apparently he'd been crying, and turns to the doctor. She tells him that Claire should be ready for surgery, explains the procedure, and that she'll take them both upstairs and get her settled in a room, and he can wait in the waiting room up there when she goes into surgery. He signs some papers, and then a nurse and a tech come in and they get Claire set in a wheelchair, and as they're wheeling her out of the room he thanks Dean and follows them.
"Let go" Cas whispered into Dean's mouth. And Dean did. He stopped holding back. With a loud moan, he felt himself come, pleasure coursing through his body.
The feeling of their skin together felt amazing. Cas couldn't get enough. He slid his hands up and down Dean's back, while Dean pressed their mouths back together.
Cas sighed. "I'm worried about when his freak out is going to happen. I know that it will, I just dont know when or to what extent it will be. Hes always been very careful of having feelings, and never for a man. Though I'm not actually a man, my vessel is, and I'm not sure how much that is going to bother him."
Dean is standing at the counter waiting for his bourbon chocolate praline crunch icecream, while Emma gets her usual caramel popcorn, when he hears Emma's name behind them.
They kiss, and when Cas pulls back, they're both smiling. He is content, so happy and in love. He has everything he ever wanted right here.
it. The closeness, the intimacy, the feeling of being wanted and needed. He misses Dean so damn much. How did this get so messed up?
Once the drinks were poured, Dean paid and headed back to the table, hands full. Cas' laughter had died down, but Dean could see the glint of happiness in his eyes. "What's so funny guys?" He asked, setting the drinks down.
As Cas stood there looking into Dean's eyes, he didnt know what came over him. Before he knew what he was doing, he had stepped right up to Dean, only an inch between them.
As they washed themselves, Dean finally got a chance to look over Cas' body. His strong beautiful amazing body. From his hard fit chest, down to his muscular thighs. He really was amazing.
"Loading this tv onto your bus, what's it look like?" Dean asks, but he's smiling so big it's pulling at his face in a way he hasn't felt in a while.
A few minutes later, they're passing the bus stop and Cas is pointing him in the direction of his house. Dean pulls down a long gravel driveway to a nice two story farm house and stops the car.
Guessing where she was going with it, Dean turned back to her and said "He's the first guy I've been with. Actually, hes the first guy I've ever wanted to be with. Though, technically hes not a guy, but the concept still applies. I'm not gay. I just... Its just Cas."
The man laughs again and turns toward the woman, leaning down and running a finger over the side of her face. She flinches and pulls back as far as she can, and Dean's had enough. He closes the distance between them until he's towering over the guy, and growls at him to remove himself from the bus before Dean does it for him.
Cas points to some garbage stacked by the side of the road not far behind Dean, and Dean makes his way over to it, Cas following quietly behind.
"No, not really. I mean, he says he has Claire and that's what matters. But what happened after I left-"
Dean kisses up Cas' body, slowly removing his fingers, and brings their lips together while reaching into the nightstand. Cas takes ahold of his hand, pulling it back. "No condom. Please? Need to feel you."
"Yes. I want you. All of you. I want to feel you inside me." Dean said, pulling Cas' mouth back to his.
Dean closed his eyes for a second, and when he opened them Cas had a worried expression on his face. "What's wrong?"
Jack nodded "yes, I am fine. I actually think I might go to my room. I'm a bit tired from today." He said, standing up.
Dean looks down and swallows hard before looking back up, staring into Cas' eyes. "I know. You know that Gabriel wouldn't have told me where to find you if I didn't have a good explanation. Please, just let me in for a few minutes so I can explain. Then, if you want me to go, I will and I'll never bother you again."
"That's it." Dean says loudly, and Gordon's head swings up to look at him, along with half the people in the restaurant, everyone going quiet. Gordon opens his mouth, but Dean cuts him off before he can say anything. "This is the worst date I've ever been on, and you, Gordon, are a dickwad. The food was perfectly cooked and amazing, the waiter was a saint dealing with your attitude, and then you leave no tip? Jesus, whoever taught you how to act should probably reevaluate their life choices."
Cas looks down at Dean with wide eyes, as his hands slide into Dean's hair, gripping and tugging a little, pulling a moan from Dean. Cas shudders, and does it again as his hips thrust up a little each time, testing what Dean can take until he's fucking Dean's face, and Dean can feel himself leaking onto the bed. He's never been so turned on in his life than he is right now, with Cas pulling his hair and incoherent words and sounds falling from his lips.
"What?" Cas asks, tilting his head slightly to the side, inquisitively. It is so damn familiar it makes Dean's heart stop for a second.
Cas leaned his head down and kissed Dean again. This kiss wasnt a desperate attempt to feel him alive, no this kiss was tender, sweet, soft. Cas slid his hand behind Dean's head, running his fingers through the hair there softly.
Cas ended up back in the livingroom. He wandered in, and sat back on the couch. He figured he may as well turn the TV on until Dean got back. It's what he usually did when he was alone and had no heaven business. Usually when the guys were out on a hunt, or asleep.
"Go upstairs" Cas says to them both, and he's so stern and commanding that Dean almost stands up and goes with them.
Once Cas has a steady rhythm going, he adjusts himself to press against Dean's prostate on every pass and watches in wonder as Dean's head falls back against the pillow with a cry of pleasure. Dean's fingers are digging into his arms and Cas slides a hand down to wrap around Dean's hard cock.
The offices are in a building behind the bus terminal, so Dean walks outside and heads to it, wondering what his boss could want him for. Sure, he'd gotten off schedule a little, but it was an emergency and he caught up quickly.
As Cas moved further down, Dean felt his tip his the back of Cas throat, and couldnt control himself. He let loose the most intense moan "mmmnnghhh Cas!"
After devouring all of the burger, and half the fries, Dean set the box down next to him. "Howd you do all this?" He asked, looking at Cas.
Cas kisses down Dean's neck, nibbling as sucking as he goes. "Wanted you since that first day." Dean says, breath hitching as Cas leaves a mark on his neck. "Just don't want to mess this up."
"Why?" Cas asked, his voice quiet and rough. He could feel Dean's hand wrap around his upper arm, and let him turn him around.
Saturday morning dawns bright and sunny, and Dean's up with it, drinking coffee and making Emma's traditional birthday chocolate chip waffles and bacon for breakfast, while happily dancing around the kitchen to classic rock.
After Dean was thoroughly washed, Cas took the washcloth to his own shaft, and washed it. When he was done, he passed the washcloth back to Dean who did the same.
It's just too perfect. Well, almost. The only thing that would make it actually perfect is if Cas was aware that Dean's in love with him.
They kissed for another minute, before Cas pulled away, moving his lips down Dean's neck to his chest. He wanted to worship Dean's body, kiss and touch every inch, find what made him writhe and squirm with pleasure. But his cock straining against his jeans was making it extremely hard to focus.
He knows he should feel uncomfortable, sitting here with someone he doesn't really know and had never met before five minutes ago, but Charlie has the kind of personality that just puts people at ease, and Cas relishes in it.
The two stared at one another for, what felt like, to Dean, a very long time. Then, Cas nodded. It was very subtle, but Dean saw it. He also saw Cas' mouth twitch, holding back a smile.
The drive only took a few minutes, and before Cas could process what they were doing, they were in his apartment, and he had Dean pulled into his bedroom and pushed up against the closed door.
Cas felt more friction against his throbbing cock as Dean moved against him, and he moaned into Dean's mouth. That sent Dean almost over the edge, as he tried desperately to hold back his orgasm.
"Hey what's going on? You guys gossiping?" Dean said, with a halfhearted laugh, his eyes landing on Cas' face.
"Nah, I think I'm gonna hit they hay" Sam replied, getting up out of the chair. As he walked by the couch, he looked at Dean and Cas for the first time, noticing Dean crowded into Cas' space. He smirked, then continued out of the room, shaking his head.
It's a good thing he does, because he has no idea what to wear. It's been so long since he's been on a date, he almost doesn't remember what it's like. After his shower, he has basically his entire wardrobe dumped onto his bed and is sorting through it trying to figure out what the fuck one wears on a first date with the hot blue eyed chicken savior.
Cas stared up into Dean's eyes, and Dean could see a small tear forming in Cas' eye. He leaned down and kissed it away as it began to roll down his face.
Climbing into Dean's bed a few minutes later, Cas is still flying high on all those good feelings. Once they're settled, Dean immediately pulls Cas to him, arms wrapped around him, Cas' head pillowed on his chest.
Emma stares at him, studying him, and he stares back, not backing down. Her face changes into one of discovery. "You loved him." She says quietly.
"Y'all can go watch something, if you want. This'll take about a half hour." Dean says to the three of them. As much as he wants Cas right in front of him, he needs five seconds without his intense stare, because he can't think clearly with it. "You're welcome to stay here, but it's gonna be pretty boring." Dean's says to Cas.
Dean has no idea how he does it, but Fern Guy manages to maneuver it through the door and up the stairs. Dean's baffled, but nods as he flashes his bus pass and heads down the aisle with his door, parking himself in the same spot he did last week.
It takes a minute, but then Emma's at the top of the stairs looking down at them. "Claire's dad is here." He says to her.
Cas knows he's getting close, can feel the pull in his groin. "Dean" he moans in warning. "Touch yourself." Because he can't focus enough to pull his hands off of Dean's hips.
After dinner, Dean follows Cas out to his workshop, and it looks different. The entire back area has been mostly cleared, and now houses huge slabs of wood and related tools.
Cas let off a small laugh "I didnt do anything this time." He moved his hands until they were resting on Dean's hips. Rubbing his thumbs along the waistband of his pants, Cas looked down, noticing Dean's still hard cock. "Oh. I'm sorry, I didnt even think."
Dean has no idea why Cas is doing this. Hitting the on switch, Dean drops his hands to the counter and leans against it with his head bowed. "Don't worry about it, you don't owe me anything."
The second half of the day is spent in a constant state of nerves. It gets so bad that, with two hours still left in his shift, Dean has dropped his tools no less than five times, and Bobby, his boss and pseudo uncle, has grumbled at him countless times before finally just telling him to go home, as he's apparently a danger to himself and the vehicles he's working on.
"You're a major space case, and that usually means something happened. So what is it? Dean tearing down on you hard again?"
As they neared town, Dean started to get a little nervous. Was Cas just doing this to go off on her? Nah, he wouldnt do that. So why was he? And why did she want to meet him? I mean, Dean hardly knew her. But if this is what it took to make Cas more comfortable, he would do it.
He can feel Dean's legs wrap around his waist, and a moment later they tighten and Cas is being flipped over, and Dean is on top of him, and fuck if that isn't the most beautiful sight he's ever seen.
Gordon's head snaps up, lips in a tight line. "Dean, we are paying to eat here. They're being paid to serve us. If we aren't getting what we want, then they should compensate us." Then he turns back to his food.
Dean found the sensitive space where Cas' neck met his shoulder, and he bit down hard, grabbing Cas' hips and pulling him against him at the same time.
Cas approached the DJ with purpose, knowing what he was about to do was a very very bad idea. He told the man his song, then took the stage.
He decides he can't wait. He needs to face this now, because he needs Cas. Needs Cas to tell him everything's going to be okay, needs him to understand what happened and why Dean did what he did. He needs Cas to understand and hold him and comfort him.
Dean can see how that might cause a little bit of a problem, but nothing that couldn't be worked out. It's Cas' passion, and whoever he's with should understand that. For a first date, maybe it wasn't the best impression to make, but Dean didn't know. Now he does.
With that, Dean leaned even closer. So close Cas could feel his breath on his face. "So, what do you say we continue what we were doing?"
Dean nodded. He could still feel his heart pounding. He was used to waking up like this, but not with somebody else there with him. Everything inside him broke in that moment, staring into Cas' eyes, and he pushed his head up, pressing his lips to Cas'. His mind was filled with nothing but 'Want. Need'.
"Damnit Dean, dont do this to him!" Sam dropped his hand from Dean's arm and turned away. When he turned back, Dean had a pleading look on his face. "You always do this. Get so close, and then run. Just stop. For two seconds, just stop and think about what you're doing. Think of somebody else besides yourself! You just spent 4 days as a drunken mess over this, and the second he gets back you want to leave? If you go, there may be no fixing this!"
Cas leaned back over Dean, putting his weight on his left forearm, and slid his right hand in between them. Dean bent his left leg, giving Cas more access.
Dean went to his drawers and pulled out 2 of everything, sweat pants, shirts, underwear, and socks. Bundling them in his hands, he looked at Cas and silently walked to the door.
As he did this, Dean took his right hand and slid it down into his own pants, wrapping it around his pulsing cock, moaning around Cas in his mouth.
Dean pulled Cas closer, and Cas snuggled his head against Dean's chest. "I love you, you know. For as long as I can remember." Dean whispered.
As the kiss deepened, Dean attempted to pull back to get a breath, but Cas wasnt relenting. He put his hand in Dean's hair, and pulled his face back in. As Dean let off a small noise, Cas took the opportunity to slide his tongue along Dean's bottom lip. In turn, Dead pushed his tongue past Cas' lips, attempting to taste every part of his mouth.
Cas passes Dean the lube, and pushes him down. He wants this so fucking bad, and he doesn't want to wait anymore.
"Cas, look at me please" Dean said. Cas looked up into Dean's eyes. "Please forgive me. It was wrong and I regret those words. I regret making you feel that way. I'm sorry." With that, Dean leaned forward and pressed a light kiss to Cas' lips.
As he climbs into bed and turns the light off, no matter how hard he tries not to, his last thoughts before he drifts off are of green eyes with gold flecks surrounded by laugh lines and freckles.
There in the doorway stood Courtney, which, of course, wasnt weird. What was weird was that she was wearing nothing but one of Sam's large flannels, buttoned up the front. Dean hoped she at least had underwear on, then wondered to himself when he'd changed so much to wish a girl was wearing more clothes, not less.
A moment later, Sam returned with 4 beers and a can of soda for Jack setting them down and pulling a chair up to the end of the table, between Dean and Courtney.
He lowers Dean gently onto the bed, then crawls up after him, kissing along his bare chest as he goes. "Tell me what you want, Dean." Cas says against him. He runs his lips over, gently lapping at one of his nipples. Dean groans, back arching off the bed as Cas sucks it into his mouth.
"Yeah Dean, Cas likes them. And I like them. So just deal. And theres only 8, not a million." Sam said, as he came into the room holding 2 bowls of popcorn, unburnt.
After that, Dean is bored and wishing it was later in the day, because he's getting nervous and excited and just doesn't want to wait anymore. Instead, he watches about an hour of useless mind numbing tv because absolutely
Feeling a press and a peck against the back of his leg, Cas looks down to see Heather pushing against him and he laughs. "I think she wants me to kiss you." He says, biting his lip and looking back at Dean.
"Uh, Sam, Charlie, a few other teachers from school. Come on, man. It's gonna be a good time. I'll even buy the first round." Dean said.
"Yes," Cas says, rolling his hips down. He's so close, he wants this. Wants to feel how Dean falls apart beneath him. Dean pulls Cas down against him, over and over as he meets him, Cas' cock straining and pulsing with his impending orgasm. Cas' hands tangled in Dean's hair, gripping tight, holding on.
Dean didn't say anything, and slowly walked over until he was standing directly in front of Cas. Cas noticed a glint of something in Dean's eyes as he reached his hand out and laid it on Cas' bare chest, which sent an immediate shiver through Cas' whole body.
He works Dean open slowly and thoroughly, working his mouth along Dean's cock and adding more digits, stretching him and rubbing against his prostate on every few passes until Dean's pushing down against his fingers for more and whimpering, begging. "Cas
Dean turns around, and can see nothing but concern in Cas' eyes. Immediately Dean's shoulders slump, all the fight seeping out of him. "Because there's nothing else I can do. And I can't just not work." Dean says, setting the beer down and pulling Cas closer. "Please understand."
Cas pulls his fingers out and quickly coats himself with the lube, the first time his cock has been touched tonight and the relief is immense. He lines himself up with Dean's hole, and slowly pushes in until hes fully seated as they both moan their pleasure. Cas' fingers are digging into Dean's hips, and he has to still a moment before continuing, overwhelmed by the satisfaction of finally,
"Shut up, Cas." With that, Dean took the base of Cas' member into his hand. He slowly stroked, from base to tip once. He looked up at Cas, and, staring into his eyes, he stuck his tongue out and licked the precum from his head. Then he opened his mouth, and slowly slid it over the end of Cas' cock.
The conversation is light between them this time, and it is such a relief that Dean just let's himself enjoy it, makes himself not think about all the shit that went wrong in the past.
He's spent the last several days in a moping funk. He still texts Cas, but just once a day, and usually has to wait most of the day for a reply.
Cas rolled over so they were face to face, a sleepy smile on his lips. "You're amazing." He said quietly.
Once the door slams behind him, Dean doesn't move for a while, just standing there staring at where Cas was just moments before, before Dean's world was changed again.
Dean shakes his head and stands up, walking around the couch to get to the kitchen. "No" he says defensively. Dean pulls open the fridge and reaches for a beer, popping it open and taking a long drink.
"I'm just gonna go check on the girls." Dean says, hooking his thumb over his shoulder. "Be nice." He says to Charlie, before going inside.
"Yes! Awesome." Cas could hear the relief in Dean's voice, and it made another twinge of guilt pull at his heart. "So, see you at 8?"
After a while, Cas hears his chicken clucking at him, and he looks up at her. She's settled in her blankets again, and is staring at him like she's waiting for a response. He checks the clock on the wall, seeing several hours have passed, and nods. "You're right, better stop now." Cas says, setting the tools aside.
The first half of the day is normal, boring. Nothing unusual to note. Same route, different people, same shit as most every day, and Dean's actually glad for that after this last week.
Dean's hands come up on either side of his face, wiping the tears away with his thumbs. "It's okay. You can cry." Dean's pressing kisses to his face, forehead, cheeks, lips. "It's okay."
Cas' breath catches in his throat. It's been three weeks since he's seen Dean, and even though he looks a mess, clothes rumpled, hair laying flat, bags under his eyes, he is still the most beautiful person Cas has ever seen.
Naomi stares her blank stare at him again, then sighs. "You should have called an ambulance. You are not to go off route. If it is an emergency, you call it in and wait for an ambulance. Understand?"
"Anything," Cas promises, and means it. Whatever Dean wants, he can have. Cas will give him everything.
Cas finishes his sandwich, drinks some of the coffee which is made exactly how he likes it, and feels more awake now.
"No problem, sir. Enjoy the rest of your meal." Benny says, then walks away. He watches as Benny approaches Cas toward the back of the restaurant saying something to him. Cas rolls his eyes, and disappears through a door that says employees only.
"What happened Charlie?" Dean asks as he climbs over blankets and pillows and games and everything else imaginable. It's like a damn booby trap room. He finally makes it over, and Charlie moves for him to take her place.
That's where Charlie finds him, who knows how long later. She's coming down the stairs telling him the girls are literally starving to death and when she sees him she just pulls him into a hug before asking what happened.
Opening his eyes, Cas wipes at his tears again and sees red at his feet. He bends down, fingers closing over the stem of a flower.
"Oh, come on. I told you my whole ridiculous story. It's your turn." She said, laying her hand on his forearm.
"Okay" Cas replies, and Dean can hear the sadness in Cas' voice. He kisses him again, and heads upstairs. He knows he's hurting Cas by being this unhappy, but he can't just quit without a backup option. He's worked his entire life, since he was old enough, never depending on anyone else for anything and he can't start now. He'll just have to figure out a way to hide his feelings about his job. To stop putting all his problems on Cas.
"You texted her last night, when you tried to leave. Were you going to go to to her? Is that why you wanted to leave with Jack so badly?" Cas asked, flashing an angered look at Dean.
He's really fucked up, and has waited way too long to fix it. Or even try to fix it. He's sure Dean's done, even though he still sends his morning text every day, but now Cas is sure it's just because he was so attached to Lunch. He cares about her.
"I wasn't sure what you normally got paid, so I kind of googled it and made an estimate. If it's not enough, just let me know."
." Dean keeps saying, begging, and Cas can't take anymore. He's pretty sure Dean is ready, so he pulls his fingers out, eliciting a whine from Dean, slicks himself up with the lube, and shoves a pillow under Dean's hips. He lines himself up, and when Dean nods at him, he slowly, torturously slowly, slides into him until he's fully seated.
Dean has been living with Cas for about a month, and he's happy. Well, mostly happy. Home life is good, Cas is great, and he has more now than he ever thought he could have.
Cas looks down at the clothes he's been wearing for days, then back up at her. "Yeah buddy, come on," she says, standing up and pulling him to the bathroom. He's shoved inside and he makes himself shower, coming out to clean clothes sitting on the counter. Once he's dressed, he heads back into the living room and slumps back onto the couch.
Dean moved his left hand up and around to grab ahold of Cas' firm ass, pulling him hard and causing his dick to plunge deep in his mouth once again.
"No, thank you. I'm fine." Cas replies, looking around the kitchen, out the window, anywhere that isn't Dean.
With Cas asleep, leaning against him, head on his shoulder, Dean could almost pretend. He doesn't let himself though. It'll hurt even more if he does because as soon as Cas shifts awake, he'll go into his room, and Dean will head to the guest room, and he'll be just as alone as ever.
Dean just gripped tighter to his hand. "Take me too! Do you hear me, god damnit?!" The smoked inched closer. "Take me too, because I'm not letting him go!"
Cas rolls his eyes right back and huffs out a sigh. "One of your boxes was in my room." He says, hefting the box in front of him.
Cas looks at the girls, then back at Dean, rolling his eyes as his lips quirk up in an almost smile. Claire most definitely takes after her dad.
"You, Dean, are an amazing caring human being." Dean starts to look away in embarrassment, but Cas catches his chin with his knuckle and turns his head back. "I am so beyond proud of you for what you did." Cas slides his hands up, cupping Dean's face in them. "You are perfect, and I wouldn't change a thing about you. I don't give a shit about that job, or that you quit, or any of it. I care that you stood up for what was right, because that's what makes you who you are. The man I love."
As he approaches, he see Fern Guy standing next to the Impala, phone in hand and cage on the ground by his feet, brow furrowed.
"Yeah Cas, I do. All of it." Dean says, and Cas can almost feel his heart stop and then start again. "I always have, I've just never found someone I wanted it with. Until you."
Dean looks around the road and finds a semi safe place to pull over and throw the hazards on. Once the bus is parked, he rips off his seatbelt and is walking down the aisle in seconds.
When he was finished, he sat back, content. He felt happy. Satisfied. He stared at Cas who was playing with the mug of coffee in front of him.
"I'm ready," Dean says breathlessly, and Cas removes his fingers slowly and slides the condom on, slicking himself up before pressing against Dean's hole. Dean wraps his legs around Cas and pulls him down into a kiss as Cas pushes past the tight ring of muscles, and then it’s wet heat surrounding him and Cas buries his face in Dean's neck to stifle the cry of pleasure that wants to escape.
It's only a few hours until the end of his shift, the world growing dark outside the windows of his bus, and Dean is very ready to go home to Cas, fall asleep in his love's arms, and enjoy the next day off with him. Everything's been going fine, he's feeling better, and looking forward to his evening.
Dean nodded. "Its jealousy, Cas. But theres nothing to be jealous of. No woman has anything on you."
When Cas reached Dean, he put his hands on Dean's chest and shoved him against the wall, staring into his eyes. Dean took a deep breath, then Cas crushed his mouth to Deans.
Cas' heart started to pound. Could this be real? He couldn't believe Dean had just said those words to him.
"I don't know what that means," Cas replies. He's confused, but also happy. Knowing Dean is okay with this takes such a load of worry off him.
He opens the door, and Cas is standing there in a disheveled tshirt and jeans, and he looks sad and upset and like he hasn't slept in days, which makes no sense because Dean just saw him that afternoon and he did not look like that.
Continuing to suck Dean down, Cas covers his fingers in the lube and warms it up before pressing a digit against Dean's hole. He can feel Dean tense, so he doubles down his efforts with his mouth and when Dean relaxes, he easily slides one finger in up to the first knuckle. He works it around until he can get it all the way in, stretches him some more, and gently pushes in another one.
Cas doesn't know what possesses him to do it, but he reaches over and lays a hand over Dean's on the table. It's warm, and rough, and a shiver runs through him at the contact. He only leaves it there for a moment before pulling his hand back and putting it in his lap, but the connection was made, the comfort given. As much as Cas hurt over Dean leaving, Dean never deserved the same to happen to him.
Dean smiled. "Thanks Cas. Okay, let's get this show on the road I guess. Unless you changed your mind?"
"Nah, you can come back with us." Dean said. When she just looked at him, he broke out laughing. "Not like that! I wouldn't... I meant. I mean... We have extra rooms." He finished in a huff, blushing.
"Man you werent joking." She said, digging further back, looking for something that probably wasnt there.
"You don't have to, Cas. But if you did, I'd pay you. At this point, I'd pay almost anything not to look at this report again." Dean says.
God, if Dean really does love him, after what Cas did last night, he'll probably never have the chance to even tell Dean how he feels. That thought sends a sharp jolt of panic through Cas' chest, and he picks up the phone again, even knowing it'll go straight to voicemail.
It's a long time before Dean grasps ahold of himself and pulls back, wiping his face with his hands, pushing his palms into his eyes. He mutters out one last I'm sorry, and turns away, embarrassed and ashamed.
Dean shook his head now. "There's nothing you can do to help, Cas. Its something I'm just gonna have to work through."
"I know." Dean tilted his head up and kissed Cas one last time. "We should get back, Sammy's probably already there and wondering what happened."
Once they're on the road, Dean digs out his phone and tells Emma to try calling Cas again. They don't live far from the hospital, so she's tried him twice more by the time they get there and park, to no avail. Dean climbs out and gets Claire out of the car gently, then carries her into the emergency room.
Cas reaches over with a shaking hand and picks up his pen. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, and when he opens them he presses the pen to the line.
Gabriel's shown up with a huge candy bouquet and a box of muffins, and Cas tells him that Dean already brought them breakfast, but Claire grabs one anyway and Gabriel gives Cas a knowing look but doesn't say anything about Dean.
Yes, they were kids. But Dean had made promises and said things and Cas was so broken afterwards that it took Claire's existence for him to move on from it.
Dean looks around, then back at his daughter with narrowed eyes. "Emma." He says, part question part accusation.
That's all it takes, Cas thrusts up two more times and feels his orgasm curl in his stomach, then explode through his entire body as he comes into his husbands tight channel.
Claire turns in her seat until she's facing forward. After a moment of silence, she says "sorry, dad" and it sounds sincere.
"Just giving her a tune up. It's been a while since I had the time to do it." Dean replied, standing up and wiping his hands on a rag.
Cas looked up at Dean as he gripped the elastic band and pulled slowly, just enough to release Dean's hard cock from its confines.
Dean looks to Cas, but Cas is staring back at his daughter all serious like. "Dean and I are together." He says, and Dean feels giddy. "And I figured you two would be happy about that, seeing as you've been pushing us together since the first day."
Dean's not exactly sure how this happened, as he brings his laptop and paperwork to the table. He'd actually completely forgotten about Claire's offer of her father's help when he realized Cas is her dad. Though, he's not gonna complain. Having someone figure this shit out for him, and possibly spending more time with Cas, it's a win win.
Dean stopped packing, and just stared at his bag on the bed thinking 'Sam's right, what the hell am I doing? Running. No. Yes I am. Cas got too close and now I'm running. Fuck'.
Cas settled into a conversation with Sam, turning his body enough so he didn't have to directly watch what was going on next to him, and letting a pleasant buzz from the beer begin to wash through him.
Cas continued, slowly, until he was completely sheathed inside Dean, then he stopped moving and just stared down at him. Dean took a few shaky breaths, getting used to feeling so... full.
While he drives, Cas starts to wonder. If Dean's shop is over on Main, that means he's really close to where The Bean is. It's very unlikely that Dean has never gone there, or that he and Grabriel hadn't run into each other at all over the last twelve years that Dean has lived here.
Sam let off a short laugh "I could use some help on this research. I'm gonna find a way to bring Rowena back."
"I swear, I taught her manners. I don't know what happened." Cas says, looking at Dean. That's his next mistake. In jeans, a tshirt and a flannel, he has no right to look as good as he does right now, and he can't help but stare. God, Cas has missed him.
"Something happened there in your head, I could see it on your face." Dean says, eyes boring into Cas'.
Not long later, Cas comes back, joining him on the deck. Dean turns to him and, wow he looks good. Nice tight jeans and light blue button up that fits him just right, hair still damp from his shower.
He picked the mugs up, and brought them to the table, setting them down. He took the seat next to Cas, and sipped from his mug of black coffee.
"No, Dean, not that. I remember that very well. What happened afterward? You rushed away from me so fast. We went too far, didn't we? I knew I should've stopped you. I tried, but you seemed determined, like you really wanted to. I'm sorry." Cas said this all very fast, trying to get it out before he lost his nerve.
"Trust me, sweetheart" Dean laughed. "I dont think that. I've met many, many women, and you're nothing like them."
Once again Cas looked down and flipped a few more pages. "But it doesnt matter. I will be here until he tells me to leave." Cas closed his eyes for a moment, before looking up. "I wont give this up, if I have any say in it."
Dean shakes his head again. "Nothing. Thanks, uh, for this. It's been fun. I guess I'll talk to you later." He's just ready to get away now, feeling dumb and confused, unable to even look at Cas.
Dean stared at him for a few moments, then dug back in the drawers for a tshirt. "As much as I hate to have you cover up, we do have a guest." He said, as he tossed the shirt to Cas, who caught it easily and slid it on. "I hope Sam got her settled in a room."
Cas looks perplexed for a minute before he turns around, and Dean's heart hurts just a little bit. Before he can sink totally into his self deprecating spiral, Cas takes a couple of steps away, sets his things down on the island, and turns back to Dean.
Cas laughs again, and Dean really can't get enough of it. "Yes, I think I'm off chicken for a while too."
Dean pulls up outside the restaurant and parks, taking a deep breath. It's been too long since he's been on a date, and when Charlie suggested he try the online thing he was really dubious.
Pulling his lips away, Cas moves down Dean's neck, wanting to taste his skin. He licks, then bites down gently into the soft skin of Dean's neck, and Dean moans, dropping his head back, his hips thrusting up into Cas'. Their cocks meet through their clothes, and the immense pleasure that courses through Cas is overpowering. He wants more. Rolling his own hips down, Cas groans into Dean's neck. It feels so good, he wants this.
"Good." Cas says. He looks around for a second, then his eyes track back to Dean's. "Um, do you maybe want to grab a drink at the bar? I'm finished here, and I figure you could probably use one after all that. You didn't seem to care for the wine very much."
Dean's hands are fisted in his shirt, and Cas pulls him closer until Dean is basically in his lap. "It's okay, Dean. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made you talk about it. I'm so sorry. You're okay. I'm sorry." Cas' face is pressed into Dean's hair and his words are muffled but he just keeps saying things like that while rocking them as Dean cries, and he cries.
Sam shrugged "I dont know how she feels about this. But, shes somebody I could definitely get to know better."
They climbed out of the car and walked inside. Dean looked around, and saw her already sitting in a booth at the back of the diner. She waved, and they walked over to her.
Dean chuckled a little more "it's a figure of speech. The circulation is cut off some. You just need to put it in another position. Here" Dean said, taking Cas' right leg and stretching it behind his back along the couch. He felt Cas wiggle his toes.
The second Cas touches him, Dean collapses against him and let's the tears fall. Tears of anger and frustration and sadness that he couldn't just fucking hang on anymore.
Cas pauses with his hand on the door knob, and Dean watches as his shoulders rise and fall then rise again with his breaths. "No, I don't think that's possible."
"Seriously?" Dean asks, then looks at the chicken again. She's slowly waddling closer then plants herself right on his foot again. "Damnit." He says, but he's really not all that upset. Stupid chicken is the reason he's here in the first place.
The cafeteria is closed, so they wander around until they find a vending machine. The coffee is shit, but he gets two cups anyway, and gets Emma a hot chocolate, and they head upstairs. By the time they do all that, and find the correct waiting room, about a half hour has passed.
Dean looked at Cas, and Cas nodded. "Yes. It's a big place, itll be fine!" Dean said, laughing again. He didnt know why he kept laughing, but man it felt good.
"Dean, you couldn't help what happened." She says grabbing his hand. "There's nothing you could've done that wouldn't have ended poorly. You just took the option that resulted in the least amount of pain."
The two other guys leap out of their seats, grab ahold of the first guy, and pull him back. Dean backs up slowly, reaches for his radio and calls it in to dispatch, requesting the police. The men have no way off the bus unless they push past him and force the doors open, and the two other guys seem worried now.
Sam walked into the kitchen, wearing his running clothes with a nice, healthy (ugh) sweat to him. Dean watched as he took in the scene before him, his face one of surprise and embarrassment. "Oh" was all he got out.
"Not that." Dean turned to Cas, keeping their hands together. "This. This whole thing. Its perfect. You're perfect."
They're finally able to pull themselves away, and Claire almost immediately falls asleep. Cas pulls the chair up close to her bed, finally sinks back into it, and drifts off.
"Sorry, mister Novak, for pulling Claire away. I wanted her help on ideas for my party, but I should've asked you first." Emma says, looking contrite.
Sitting on the floor again, Cas pulls another box toward himself as he thinks. Coming back to Lawrence was never in his plans, and it's starting to bring a whole slew of memories and emotions, most of which are not pleasant.
Dean grabbed Cas' hand and rushed them from the room. He made it to the hall before he had to stop and lean against the wall. The laughter had taken over again.
Remembering what had led up to that magical moment, Dean tossed the bundle of dirty bedding back on the bed, and grabbed his phone. Flipping through his messages, he read what Courtney had said last night.
Then it's all spilling out. "Just seen, one seen, the regular one. He came here to pick her up yesterday and I about got knocked on my ass with surprise when I opened the door. Then I invited them to stay for lunch. Then Claire, that's his kid, offered his help on the books for the shop cuz I mentioned having issues with them this month, and apparently he's a number genius or some shit. Then, he did the work last night and brought it back here today and we talked for a while about some deep shit. And
When that was finished, he went over to the clothes hed brought in and tossed a set to Cas, who started to put them on.
As Dean pulls the two sides apart, and Cas glimpses light blue satin, the want and need for his husband rips through him. It's been so long, and he can't take any more. His hands thrust out against Dean's chest, and he pushes him against the wall, pressing himself to Dean's body. He crushes their lips together, plunges his tongue into Dean's mouth.
Oh shit, Cas thought he'd only kissed him to get him to stay, Dean thought. Like Dean would actually do something like that.
Dean moved his right hand down along Cas' side until he reached the line of his pants, squeezing his hand between them until he felt the bulge against him.
Dean stood there, trapped in his own head. In an attempt to calm down, he told himself this is Cas, my best friend, one of the people I care about most in this world. Dont push him away. Calm down. Everything's fine.
Dean's mind was a pleasant jumble of thoughts. 'That's good. Fuck yes. Cas. Cas is in me. Fucking me. Cas. Cas. Yes. FUCK AAA NGHH'. Dean's body spasmed as a shock of pleasure shot through him. "The fuck?" He panted out.
Dean peeled his eyes away from the beautiful scene in front of him, and looked at Cas. "This is... really nice."
Cas' fingers are still holding tight, and Dean's dizzy with want, can see the same in Cas' eyes. Dean closes his eyes again and leans his forehead against Cas'. "I want you, I do. I just... Not yet." Dean says, opening his eyes and silently pleading for Cas to understand.
"No, no, it's totally fine" Courtney said, raising her hand up. "Cas?" Cas looked at her. "I didnt know there was a... thing here. Trust me, if I'd known anything about this, I would never have kissed him."
Smiling at Cas' name, he answers. "Hey sweetheart, I'm just about to head home and shower before I come over."
Fucking promised, and here Michael is, in their apartment, in Cas' room, doing god knows what. Jesus, Dean can literally feel his heart breaking.
"I'm not. And neither is Emma. We knew you'd be perfect together if you'd just get your heads out of your-"
Cas sinks back down into the couch. He's barely moved in a week. Really, the only times he does is to take care of the chickens, eat once a day, and possibly shower if he's feeling ambitious that day, which he was today so he managed a shower and to eat twice, which is an accomplishment.
That was way too easy. Normally getting Claire out of the house any time before noon is a huge struggle, the day before being the exception, when she'd made the plans. Cas just shakes his head and hurries downstairs, determined to have at least one more cup of coffee before they leave.
That's it. That's all it says. It's not even new information. It's the same exact damn text Cas has sent the last few days. Fuck it, he has to do something. He has to know whether this is actually over or not.
Downstairs, he starts a pot of coffee then grabs several of his homemade breakfast sandwiches out of the freezer. He heats them up, wraps two in foil to keep them warm, then hands one to Emma and keeps one for himself. Filling 2 travel mugs with coffee, he fixes one with cream and sugar, because that's how Cas drank it way back when and he hopes that's how he still does, then packs everything into a reusable shopping bag.
"Okay, okay. I understand. Just, think about it, alright? You never thought you'd see him again, and here he is. Come on, Dean. You've never cared about anybody the way you cared about him."
Cas pushes a little on Dean's chest and says his name again, and Dean immediately pulls back, taking a step back and checking over Cas' face with concern.
Dean woke up early again, which was becoming an annoying habit now. He felt Cas against him, and snuggled his head deeper into his chest.
They stood like that, clinging to each other, for another couple of minutes before they broke apart and headed to the car.
As Dean reached the bottom of the stairs, he turned around to watch Courtney come down, Cas right behind her.
He stopped at the bathroom, then headed to the kitchen, where he found Sam sitting at the table drinking coffee.
: Seriously, I told you I would've paid almost anything not to look at those damn numbers again and I wasn't joking. If it makes you feel better, call it a first time bonus.
want him, I was just upset and that's no excuse but it's what happened and I'm sorry. But we didn't have sex, I swear. I mean, I was going to, but then you came home and I couldn't and I'm so sorry." Cas is rambling and Dean's trying to process everything he's saying, but he just continues.
Cas nods eagerly, and together they unload it and carry it around the side of the house. They get it set up in the corner of the yard, and, like usual, Lunch is the first one to come up. She's gotten very attached to Dean, and Cas finds it endearing the way she follows him around.
Cas couldn't take anymore of this. He dropped the mic and hurried off the stage, out the door of the bar into the cool night, and around to the side of the building.
The drunker Dean got, the more he'd touch Cas. It started with just a small brush of his arm, or a hand on the shoulder. Leading up to Dean laying his hand on Cas leg and rubbing his thigh. Cas kept watching Dean, with a half smile on his face, making sure he wasnt getting too drunk to function.
It's only been a few weeks since their first date, and it's been amazing. They've gone out several times, stayed in and watched a few movies, Dean's even cooked him dinner. They've kissed, a lot, and it's always fantastic, but they've never gone past that. It's not that he doesn't want to. Hell, every time Dean's tongue is in his mouth, body under his hands, he's ready to push him down and have his way, but Dean seems to want to take it slow, and that's really okay with him.
He makes breakfast in a daze, mechanically, while his mind whirls around everything. Maybe he can fix this? If only he could talk, say the things he wants to say, let Dean know how he feels.
Cas slowly moved his head forward, testing, and observed Dean. He'd never done this before. He flicked his eyes up to Dean, noting his thrown back head, and hands tangled in the bedsheets.
Dean looked at her then, and saw the concern in her face. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he opened them he told her everything that had happened. Well, everything he could tell someone who didnt know about the supernatural world.
"And, where'd you sleep? Because we walked by the guest room on the way down here, and it was empty." Claire says, purposely avoiding looking at her dad.
"Mhmm, I see that." Dean replied. He couldnt stop smiling. Sam being embarrassed about a girl was one of his great joys in life.
It would be a little weird, and he'd have to spend more time with Dean, which he really shouldn't do. He really really shouldn't. But he wants to. And he needs the work.
Dean let go, but before Cas could walk away, he grabbed ahold of both of Cas' upper arms and pulled him to himself. "I don't want you to go. I dont know what this is, or what I'm doing, or how to say the right things. But I know that I dont want you to go." Then he shoved his mouth against Cas'.
Cas was enjoying it, but he wanted more. He wanted to feel all of Dean. When Cas tried to move his hands, Dean pressed against him hard enough to shove his even more hardening member against the edge of the sink. With that, Cas moaned louder, dropping his head to the side to give Dean more access, shivers consuming his body.
Dean wakes up tangled in Cas, and it's probably the most amazing feeling in the world, after being a father. He lays there for a while just soaking it up, reveling in it. He's wanted Cas for as long as he can remember, and here he is, so gorgeous and sleep rumpled and perfect.
he has to cut this off now before it gets any worse. Working for Dean is going to be hard enough, he can't fall for the man again, and with his generosity helping with the jobs, and the way he is with his daughter, and the fact that hes
Dean's hand slides down Cas' stomach and into the waistband of his pants, and when Dean takes Cas' hard length into his hand, Cas can't hold back his own groan, moving back up to claim Dean's mouth again. Cas pops the button on Dean's jeans, slipping his hand in and taking Dean into his own hand. Dean's hips buck into him, and Cas swallows down more noises.
"He's there? Please let me talk to him," Cas begs, hope welling inside him. If he can just get Dean to listen for one minute, then he can explain. He can tell him how he feels.
Cas adjusts his grip, adding more pressure to Dean's straining length as he thrusts up into him. "Come for me Dean. Now" Cas commands, and Dean moans, throwing his head back as Cas feels the front of the panties soak all the way through.
When Emma comes in, she rolls her eyes (thanks for that, Claire) but is smiling when she sits at the table with a stack of waffles in front of her, covered in homemade strawberry syrup and whipped cream.
God, he wishes. He wishes there had been another way. That he could've stayed, been with Cas, shown him how much he was loved for who he was. He wishes things had been different for them. Even though he doesn't in some ways. If they had been different, if he had been able to stay, he wouldn't have Emma and Cas wouldn't have Claire. He just wishes he could've saved Cas all that pain.
"Dean" Cas' voice drifts into his ears, so real, deep and gravelly just how it always is in the morning. "Come on." A shake to his shoulder has Dean's eyes blinking open to look up at Cas leaning over him.
Dean leaned forward and pressed his lips to Cas'. They were soft, and warm, and just slightly chapped.
Dean pushes all his insecurities aside and presses his mouth against Cas', savoring the feel of his soft lips, the taste of his tongue as Cas swipes into his mouth.
He waits less than a minute, he assumes, because he's absolutely not watching the clock, before he receives a reply.
By the time they go to bed, Dean is feeling much better. He snuggles up into Cas, and they fall asleep together, Dean pushing his hopelessness about work down deep.
Cas nods, bites his lips, feeling how stupid it is after what they just shared, but Dean is so sweet, so understanding, and Cas kisses him once more, just a gentle press of their lips. He forces himself up, out of Dean's lap, and can feel the sticky cooling mess in his underwear. He must pull a face, because Dean laughs, beautiful and lighthearted as he stands too.
"I know, I'm sorry. Somebody climbed in my bed this morning and wouldn't leave until I got up." He leaves out the fact that he really wanted to know how she was too, and wanted to make sure Cas was okay. Then quieter he says "she was worried."
"For the last time Sam, I dont know what happened. I just heard him say my name, then nothing. Hes not praying, and I cant gain access to his head which means he isnt concious. Please drive faster."
Dean led Cas through the hall, past his room, deeper into the bunker. He stopped at a door and they went into what Dean called their 'livingroom'. It was stuffed with a large couch, a recliner, and a flat screen TV.
"Dean, are you sure?" Cas asked, staring into his eyes. Dean nodded, and Cas took the bottle from him.
A lead weight settles in Dean's stomach as Cas turns to push Michael back, and Dean let's the flower fall from his hand while trying to suppress the overwhelming urge to cry.
That night, he's laying in bed letting the memories flow through him for the first time in a while. All the time he spent with Cas, back in school and over the summer they lived here. Everything was perfect, and Dean had never felt that way before, never felt that way since. Something's always missing, and that something has blue eyes and messy hair.
"So since it's summer, you can start staying here a lot more." Emma says to Claire. "Like, all the time. You should even bring all your clothes and stuff so you don't have to go back to your house."
"You shouldn't." Dean says, and Cas can tell he honestly believes that. Believes that he deserves to feel like shit about this forever, and Cas cannot let that happen. Seventeen years is long enough.
Dean pumped his hand until Cas was spent, his body relaxed, hands finally loosening from the sheets.
"I'm really good" he says, taking the glass from Dean's hand and setting it on the counter behind him. He pulls Dean to him, feeling more confident. "I feel really good."
Dean leans in and presses another soft kiss against Cas' lips. "I love you, too. God, I've never stopped loving you." He says.
The girls have spent the entire time, and he means the entire time from the second the truck started, talking. Apparently Emma's birthday is coming up and she's having a sleepover. That's about as much as he got out of it.
By the time Dean pulls up in front of his brother's house, he's had to turn his phone off. It kept ringing, flashing Cas' picture, and each time it dug a little deeper into Dean's heart until he almost just threw the thing out the window. Instead, he turned it off and dumped it onto the passenger seat and finished the drive.
Cas heard the door close, and Dean's car start up. As he heard the engine get quieter as it moved away from the bunker, Cas sighed to himself.
Cas kissed Dean with desperation, a desperation hed never felt before, pushing himself against him to get as close as possible. He felt Dean's hands on him, all over his body, kissing him back just as hard.
"Of course, Dean." There's no question about that. His place will always be by Dean's side. "Tomorrow. Sleep now."
Dean took more of Cas into his mouth, until he was completely engulfed, from tip to base. Cas felt his head hit the back of Dean's throat, and forgot how to breathe.
"Come with me?" Cas asks, a mix of confident and vulnerable that is so endearing Dean can't stand it. Dean nods and reaches for his wallet, but Cas stops him. He pulls out the money Dean gave him earlier, sets it on the bar, and once they throw their jackets on, he grabs Dean's hand, pulling him up and leading him to the door.
"Please," Dean breathes out, hips bucking up as Cas sucks another mark into his skin. "Please Cas, I need you."
After about 15 minutes Sam noticed Cas hadnt turned a page in quite a while. Shutting his own book, Sam said "alright Cas, what's up?"
Dean's anger is boiling over, and he can't hold back anymore. "Get the fuck off my bus before I call the cops!" He says, taking a hesitant step forward. He really doesn't want to have to physically make this guy leave, even the thought of it sending an unpleasant chill through him.
Dean let's out the breath he didn't realize he was holding, and smiles. Cas is beautiful and passionate and smart and Dean can't wait to see where this goes.
Cas went to the kitchen and forced a PB&J down. Drinking without anything in his stomach was always a bad idea, so even though he could barely taste it, he made himself eat.
Cas moved back up Dean's body, pressing their lips back together as he unbuttoned Dean's pants. He felt Dean's hands on his own, and felt the release of pressure as his zipper slid down.
When the hostess greets him with a wary eye, he gives her a small smile. "I'm really sorry about all that, and I was wondering if I could talk to the waiter, Cas? Just for a minute."
"I'll be here when you're done," Dean promises, like he can read Cas' worries. Cas nods again, and pulls away, heading to the bathroom.
Cas flicked his eyes toward the hallway, watching Dean as he emerged wearing a pair of blue and white plaid pajama pants, a tight grey t-shirt, and a pair of socks. He felt his cheeks get warm, and a small smile creep onto his face.
On the way home, Dean swings into the small flower shop a few blocks from Cas' apartment. They'd had a conversation a few weeks ago, while watching some nature documentary on tv late at night, about flowers and their meanings. Cas was really into it, and got very adorably energetic as he told Dean all about it, so Dean picks out a single red tulip, for deep everlasting love, and takes it to the counter to pay.
"Alright" Cas said, realizing that he wasnt getting anywhere in his own head and really could use some advice from the person who knew Dean the best. "Well, Dean and I fought. He doesn't listen to me, and he blames me for everything, so I decided it was time to leave. When I tried, Dean stopped me."
Dean's still speechless, happiness rolling in his chest. He turns back to the counter and pours a cup of coffee, smiling to himself the whole time.
Pulling into the driveway, Dean can feel the sexual tension ratchet back up, thick in the air. He puts the car in park and looks at Cas, to see he's already looking back, undisguised lust in his expression. They stare at each other for a few moments before Dean motions his head toward the house and they get out, walking up the steps to the porch.
Looking at the time, Dean pushes away from his desk. He really has to figure out the problem with his numbers, but dinner isn't gonna cook itself.
Just lunch, then they can go and he can never come back, he thinks as he follows the girls back into the kitchen. He's fulfilled his parental obligation to meet his daughter's friend's parents (or parent, he reminds himself) and he can stay away now.
Dean has been leaving things on the porch; cookies, pies, sandwiches, more soup. It's insane and incredible and Cas doesn't know what to do with it.
They stare at each other for a minute, until Dean can't take it and pulls his eyes away. "Oh, uh" he reaches into the bag and pulls out the sandwiches. "I didn't know if she has a special diet for after surgery, but I grabbed one with egg whites and turkey bacon so it'll be less heavy on her stomach." He hands Cas the normal one, then hands over the (gross) light one to Claire who gives him a quick thanks in response.
The Impala is rumbling down the road, and Dean is almost home when he hears a clucking from the behind him.
"And you're not a 'shit person' as you put it. You dont have to be a bad person to panic about something new. It's a natural human reaction. But with who you are, that kind of panic could end this. I know you Dean. Its felt inevitable since the second you kissed me" Cas said. That was it, it was out there and he couldnt take it back.
Dean laughed behind her, watching Sam's face change from anger, to confusion, to concern. "Sorry Sammy. We had drinks. A lot of drinks. Thought it would be safer if she came back here to crash, instead of driving home."
"I'm sorry. I really didn't think it mattered. He knows who you are, but he never really brought it up again after we figured out that we sort of inadvertently knew each other." Sam says sincerely.
"What are you talking about?" Cas was confused. Then he realized, Dean's timing was way too good coming into the war room. Had he overheard him? He must have. Cas' heart sped up.
He'd settled on dark jeans, with a black tshirt and a light blue button up over the top. It was nice, but not fancy. It would have to do.
A shower was first, and Cas made it a long one, hoping the scalding water would wash away some of his unwanted feelings.
"So, maybe I can buy you dinner sometime, to say thank you." Cas says quietly, looking back into Dean's eyes, and Dean's hit with that bright blue again.
"Just one more thing that needs a place." Cas says, turning around in Dean's arms and looking into his eyes.
He was even more surprised when the guy slipped him his number while he was paying. When he'd turned around, Claire looked angry, which was strange because she's never seemed to have a problem when he's dated. Though, Cas supposes, he really doesn't do it often so it's very hard to judge what Claire thinks about it in general.
Biting his lip, he takes a moment and then nods. "Alright. I have errands to run anyway. I can drop you off about nine, and pick you up when I'm finished."
Setting the laptop on the coffee table, Dean falls back to lay on the couch, rubbing his palms into his eyes. He has to decide.
As the hot water cascaded down onto them, they just stood there for a moment letting it wash away the horrors of the day.
"How about just nothing under the pants. Just for now. I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet" Dean said, hoping Cas was okay with that.
Dean turned toward Cas, and leaned in close to his ear, whispering "I wont drink much more. We'll just hang out for a bit, then head to bed." He felt Cas nod against him, then pressed a light kiss to Cas' neck. "You really do look so hot right now."
"Don't say you're sorry, I'm the one who attacked you." Dean tries to pull away again but Cas doesn't let go.
"Hey, you can have that. Well, not that, that's mine. I mean him. Hes mine. What I mean is..." Dean took a breath. "You can have love."
After ice cream with Dean, Cas goes home feeling happy. There's something bubbling in his chest, and he hasn't felt it for so long that it doesn't even register at first what it is. It's when he's laying in bed that night that it hits him like a ton of bricks.
It wasn't like they had any idea that Cas' entire world had crumbled around him. They didn't know about Dean, and they sure as hell didn't know he liked men.
"Oh, beloved, it's okay. Everything's going to be fine." Cas' hands are rubbing soothing circles along his back, through his hair, as he continues his litany of comforting words.
Dean moved his head to the other side of Cas' neck, giving some attention to that side with small licks and nibbles.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. He opened them, then leaned his body so it was flush against Cas' back.
"Uh, I just... it's been a long time, since I've done this." Dean says, and Cas realizes he means sex with a man.
"No," Dean interrupts. "No, I can't. I can't see him, not now. Maybe not ever. I can't take it any more. I need to move on."
"Cas, wait!" Dean threw his hand forward, grabbing ahold of Cas' arm. "I wasnt going to see her. I just... Wanted to talk to somebody, other than Sam. Somebody who wasnt invested in this like he is."
Summer break is upon them, and Dean wants to have a barbecue with just the four of them to celebrate, so Cas and Claire head over to their house in the late afternoon.
After a few moments, Dean pulls back and looks into Cas' eyes, searching. "You okay?" He asks, and Cas realizes his body is still quivering, aftershocks going through him. He nods, and Dean still looks concerned until Cas smiles, kisses him again, and that brings a smile to Dean's face as well.
Claire shows up last, with Cas, and it's refreshing to see him even though they just saw each other the day before. Claire goes running up the stairs with a glare at her dad when she's told all the other girls are there already.
Taking his supplies to the sink, he washes them and cleans up, before heading outside and calling the chickens to him. He gets them settled in the shed he's using as their home, and goes inside the house.
"Well, yeah. You want it, it's probably pretty heavy, I'm here, we both think this is going well, so let's get it. Where is it?"
Dean hadn't even brought this up with him. Was he just going to find a place and move out without even talking to Cas first? Unbidden tears prick at Cas' eyes and he sets the laptop back on the coffee table, running his hands over his face and through his hair.
Dean pulled back. "Damnit" he whispered. As courtney looked at him confused, he caught a glimpse over her left shoulder. Standing in the doorway to the bar stood Cas, the most devastated look on his face Dean had ever seen.
Cas shakes his head, and Dean's stomach sinks. He really did fuck up bad. "You have to work tomorrow and it's getting late."
He can still feel the phantom of Cas' lips on his cheek, his smell still in his nose, and it's sending waves of warmth throughout his body. It takes him a minute of dazed contentment before he pulls himself out of it and he nods. "Of course. Now, let's grab this and get moving."
They both stood under the hot water, letting it rinse them clean, as they stared into each others eyes.
Cas is a lot less optimistic the next morning than he was the previous day. He worked late, and once he'd drug himself to bed he barely slept.
When Sam answers, Dean gets right to the point. "Did you know that Gabriel at The Bean is Cas' brother?"
Dean set his phone down on his nightstand, and after a couple of minutes, he made his way back to the livingroom, but Cas wasnt there. Dean's heart dropped. 'He left again. He wont come back this time. God damnit why do I fuck everything up' he thought, as he walked back down the hall toward the kitchen, hoping Cas hadnt really left, but steeling himself to the possibilty that he had.
He and Cas made their way down the hall silently. Once in the war room, Dean grabbed his keys off the table.
everything? He wants to ask, god does he want to. It would not be appropriate at all, and he really should just ask Dean, but this somehow seems easier.
As these thoughts float through his head, he's reminded again, by the sadness that washes through him, of what had happened all those years ago.
Cas felt Dean's pants getting wet against his palm, and continued rubbing until he could feel Dean's body relax, signaling he was finished.
"Seriously Sammy, just drop it right now. Please," the last word comes out cracked, and Sam backs off, leaving the room and closing the door with a quiet "Okay".
"Damnit Cas, never offer to help do research, have I taught you nothing?" Dean asked, with overexaggerated exasperation.
Bobby is a surly old man with a dirty baseball hat and a gruff voice, but needs no more than Cas' name before he's offering him the work and saying he'll have a contract drawn up. Cas is in and out of there in about twenty minutes, and is stunned as he starts his truck and heads over to the Roadhouse.
He feels guilt and sadness over what happened with Lunch, but the vet said she would be okay, and he never received a call so he assumes she's doing well.
"Yes I know, you'll take an angel blade to me." Cas replied, grabbing the keys. He smirked and got in the driver's side, while Dean slid into the passenger and Courtney climbed in the back.
After what felt like an eternity of just standing there, Cas could see the panic slowly fall from Dean's face.
The smile slips from Dean's face, heart dropping into his stomach. "Ah, okay. Sorry, I didn't know you were... dating." He wants to say seeing someone, wants to know how they met, and what this guy has that Dean doesn't, whatever, but it's all too much and he really just wants to go back to this morning when he was happy, or even ten minutes ago when he was just tired and not heartbroken.
They turned toward the stairs, and watched as Sam and Jack came down, stopping in the war room to throw his jacket on a chair.
He was watching Dean as he sang, but tore his eyes away to look anywhere else. He found a spot on the wall, and focused on that.
They're silent for a few minutes, but it isn't awkward or weird, it's just comfortable. It doesn't take long for them to fall into easy conversation though.
Cas slowly nodded "yeah, I figured that was why. It's okay Dean, I'm not going. We can just pretend it didnt happen."
"What? God no. I wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole." Understanding dawns on him. "Uh, actually I met someone else."
Looking around, he sees two more. "Is it just those two left?" He asks, and Fern Guy nods. There's one toward the front, and one toward the back, so they split up. Dean's quickly but quietly stalking up to the one in the front, he leans down but as soon as his fingers graze it, it takes off. Dean loses his balance and falls face first to the floor of the bus.
Cas read the message to Dean, and could see a blush creeping up his cheeks. It was unbelievably adorable.
Before Dean knew it, he was pulling into the parking lot of the bar in town. He'd already had those couple of drinks back at the bunker, but he definitely needed more.
Moving his lips to Dean's ear, he whispers "turn over my love", and Dean quickly complies. Cas takes a moment to soak in his husband from behind. His muscled back, smooth skin, tight ass covered with the lovely satin. A shiver goes through him, and he can't wait to feel that tight heat around him.
On the drive back to Cas', Dean feels really good. A kind of good he hasn't felt in so damn long, and he realizes he's having fun. This is fun. It's a really nice feeling, and Dean doesn't want it to stop.
"And, if you had?" Cas says. "Say you'd sent a message, and he found out, and did who knows what to you. Do you think I could've forgiven myself for putting you through that?"
Flavor explodes on Dean's tongue. It's a strong ale, slightly sweet but barely so, with a hint of something that screams of fall and pie, and Dean is in heaven.
Calm down, he probably just got bored of watching you sleep and went to watch TV, Dean told himself.
Dean moaned loudly, bringing his face back to Cas' and pressing his lips to his, moving his own hips in time with his hand now.
"Shut up Dean." Cas says with fondness, and Dean shuts up. Cas grabs his hand and pulls him upstairs into his room.
"Fuck, Cas I'm sorry. I was out of control, I'm so sorry." Dean says running a hand down his face. "Shit, I'm an asshole."
Courtney nodded "I'm glad you understand. Now. Who's hungry? Cuz I'm starving." She picked up her menu.
"I forgive you," Dean says, and that's the second most wonderful thing he's heard in his entire life, after Dean uttering the words 'I love you'.
Cas couldn't take anymore, so he stood up and quickly made his way to the bar. When the bartender approached him, he asked for four shots of tequila and another beer. He was already feeling pretty buzzed, but it seemed liquor was going to be his only saving grace. He could still hear Dean singing, and just wanted to drown it out.
Swiping his tears away, Cas heads down the hall and pulls the door open. "Dean?" The word leaves his mouth, surprise evident. What's he doing back? Does he want to talk? Hope fills him, maybe this is his chance.
Dean chuckles against his skin, and Cas hears the lid click. A moment later, Dean's finger is pressing against his rim, pushing in slowly, and Cas can't help the strangled moan that forces its way out of his throat.
Once Cas is dressed, he looks at the time again and can't help but think he needs a drink. He needs to forget about this for just a minute, the pain lancing through his chest. Cas grabs his jacket, keys, and wallet and heads out the door, hoping he can find an open bar at this time of day. Fuck the social negativity about day drinking, he needs this right now.
As he moans, Dean's hands find their way into Cas' hair, and Cas sucks harder. "God, Cas. I love you. I love you so much. I want you." Dean's words spur him on, and Cas moves down to take one of Dean's nipples in his mouth, pulling another moan from Dean's throat.
"So fucking gorgeous, my love. So perfect." Cas mumbles, lowering his head to press open mouthed kisses to Dean's skin along the top of the panties. Dean shifts against the bed, looking for friction, and Cas uses a hand to hold his hips down. Dean easily relents, stills his movements, but fists the sheets again, a whimper escaping his lips.
He laughs to himself. Freaking teenage girls, man. It doesn't take much to make them happy. Or maybe that's just his kid.
They finished up, and Dean reached past Cas to shut the water off. As Dean leaned over him, Cas pressed a kiss to Dean's shoulder. Dean leaned back, smiled, and grabbed their towels from the hook outside the stall, handing one to Cas.
Dean huffs. "I never wanted to leave you. You're the one who pushed me away, and for what? A stupid comment I made that I didn't even think about?! It didn't mean anything, Cas. Jesus."
Dean steps back, which Cas does not feel sad about, and puts his hands up. "Nope. You did the work, you get paid. You have no idea how much of my sanity you saved by doing that." Dean bites his lip, and Cas determinedly does not look at it. "An hour and a half, really? Man, I'd been looking at that shit since Friday morning."
Dean is staring at him, still blushing, and god does he look so fucking adorable when he's embarrassed.
"Hey, give your dad a break." Dean says, flicking Claire's hair. "He's been by your side for the last 24 hours."
"Alright. Sorry." Dean stated, then turned back into the hallway. He walked down it, turning corners, until he reached the room he'd made into their sudo livingroom. It had a big flat screen TV on a stand on the left wall, a long couch along the right wall, and a soft recliner straight ahead facing the TV. Dean grabbed the remote, and sat on the far end of the couch, closer to the chair.
Pushing Dean away is really fucking stupid, and he knows it. That's the other thing he spent all night thinking about. The sad defeated look on Dean's face when Cas drove away, it haunted him all night. He should pick up the phone and call him. He should, but he can't. He's scared. What if he freaked Dean out by his own freakout? What if Dean wants to call this off, to break up, because Cas pushed him away? He can't face it, not yet, not today.
He likes her. Even though it was only about a two minute conversation, he can definitely see her and Emma being good friends.
Cas held the bottle between his fingers for a moment, warming it up. He wanted to make this as comfortable for Dean as possible.
This is the last chapter. I havent decided if I want to continue it or not. We'll see if inspiration strikes me.
"It's really not a big deal. So, you getting coffee? The pie here is really good." Ah, there he is, Dean Winchester, Master Of Avoidance And Subject Change.
Dean sat up on his knees and looked at Cas, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. He didnt think hed ever seen anything as amazing as Cas laying there, in pure pleasure, his body relaxed like he'd never seen before.
Cas settles into the couch, in his favorite flannel pajama pants, comfy tshirt, and a cup of tea on the side table. He pulls the laptop and paperwork out of the bag, sets it up on the coffee table, and gets to work.
Cas stares at him for a minute, and then another minute, and then he shrugs with his hands spread out in front of him and says "I just need time, Dean." And then he's down the steps and to his truck and Dean doesn't even know what to make of that.
"I know, Cas. It's a problem." He replied. "Anyway, I stopped at the bar. I was fine just drinking by myself. Then this woman came up and offered to buy me a drink. I let her. We talked for a while, then-"
They headed outside, and started walking towards Baby, as Dean dug through his pockets for his keys.
He couldn't, because it hurt too much. He'd been in love with Dean for as long as he could remember, and had forced himself to push his feelings down. Ruining their friendship by telling him was never an option, but now he was ruining their friendship by avoiding him. This was a no win situation, Cas knew. It's not like he never wanted to tell Dean, and he would have if he'd ever gotten any indication the man felt the same. But, he hadn't, so Cas had kept his mouth shut for almost fifteen years.
Cas smiles, and they lean in to kiss each other. Once again, Dean has more than he ever could've hoped for, and it's all because of Cas.
"Me too." Dean replies, and that's good enough for him, so he kisses back down to Dean's cock, and licks his tongue against the head, the flavor of Dean bursting on his tongue.
Dean shifts on his feet, fingers playing with the hem of his shirt now that his hand is empty. "I guess that's it. I'm just really sorry, and if you'll go grab your manager I'll talk to him next."
Shaking his head, he gets out of the car. It's getting hotter, and it's fairly safe out there at Cas', so he leaves the windows down so Baby isn't a sauna when he gets back in later, and walks around the side of the house to get back to work.
"Courtney. I asked her what I should do. She told me just to think about what you liked, and go with it. I found the museum. But this place." Cas gestured in front of him. "This was her." Cas looked at Dean then.
He's beautiful, muscled and soft in all the right places, his cock hard and leaking against his stomach. Cas leans down and kisses around Dean's groin, before making his way back up to Dean's mouth. Dean is pulling on his pants, so he breaks away for a minute to divest himself of them, and then finally,
What the actual fuck? This cannot seriously be happening. When he doesn't move to take the paper, Naomi sighs. "Mister Winchester, you are wasting my time. Sign the slip and be on your way." The irritation in her voice is grating.
"Dean. What happened?" Cas asked again, resisting the overwhelming urge to continue what they were doing.
They do cake, and the girls are ecstatic about the sundaes, and then they're gone upstairs again. Dean sends Charlie up with them, insisting that he'll be fine, and then he's alone with his own misery.
"Cas?" Dean said, furrowing his brow. He felt his heart start to pound in his chest, getting faster by the second.
That is why, after Claire's off to school and he's sufficiently caffeinated, he grabs the number that's been sitting on his dresser for five days now and texts Asa from the diner.
Dean moans above him, and Cas takes him into his mouth because he loves to suck cock and it's been way too long, even longer since he had Dean's and that's all he's ever wanted. While he licks and sucks and works his tongue around, Dean shifts above him and is pressing a bottle of lube into Cas' hand.
Why is he even doing this? It's not like Cas wants him there, if he did he could've said something, said anything. He did make breakfast, which was a surprise, so maybe he does want him there? Or he's just being a gracious person, because Dean's building the fence.
This isn't how this was supposed to go. Cas wasn't supposed to be with someone, especially this someone, and now all Dean wants to do is get as far away from this as possible.
Dean turned to Cas, looked him in the eyes, and said "Okay." Here goes, he thought to himself. "When you kissed me, I panicked."
Dean closes his laptop, and thinks about it. Tomorrow's Saturday, and he should be fine to be here to supervise. Not that he doesn't trust his daughter, but he doesn't know anything about this new kid. "I don't see why not."
"I havent... you know... in my pants since I was a teenager... I think I need a shower" Dean said, looking at Cas' face and laughing.
"Oh" Cas didnt know what to say to that, so he wound his fingers around Dean's hand and gently pulled until Dean was once again laying on top of him.
In response, Dean pressed his body down and forward, rubbing their hard lengths together through their pants, and causing Cas to let out the most wonderful sound Dean had ever heard. Dean muffled his moans with his mouth, loving the feel of Cas moaning into him as Dean continued to press and rub their bodies together.
As Cas bent down to grab a couple of mugs from the shelf, Dean didnt move. He could feel Cas' ass just lightly graze him as he bent down, and Dean closed his eyes.
"Hah, yeah, right. You should see the way he looks at me. It's a mix of hurt and anger and something else, like panic, like he wants to be as far away from me as possible."
"What do you do, professionally?" Cas asked her, filling the silence. Dean actually didnt know the answer to this. They hadnt spent too much time talking.
"Cas I'm not going to freak out. At least I dont think I'm going to. I'm damn sure gonna try my best." He rubbed the back of his own neck, a nervous habit. "I cant promise that I wont. This whole thing is new to me. Every single part of it. But I dont want to push you away anymore. You shouldn't have to feel like I will, and I'm sorry I've always been such an asshole to you that you think I'd do that." Dean said, trying to look anywhere but at Cas now.
Cas wrapped his hand around his hard cock, sucking in a sharp breath, and gave himself a couple of test strokes. Hed never done this before, so he didnt know if he was doing it right. It felt good, though he wished it was Dean's hand and not his own.
He walked in and sat at the bar, waving down the bartender, an older man with dark hair and a scar down the side of his face.
"I'm sorry, again. I'm not hitting on you, I swear." And that's a relief. "I just always figure we should compliment each other, you know? Make the others feel good. Dean doesn't understand, cuz he's not. Not exactly, anyway. Us gays gotta stick together, right?"
"Awesome" Claire takes her plate to the sink and rinses it before putting it in the dishwasher. "I'll go get ready." She says before shes bounding up the stairs and out of sight.
Cas grabs ahold of Dean's hips and presses him against the counter, deepening the kiss until Dean is breathless and his head is a fog of desire.
Dean ground down again, desperate for more friction. Cas thrust his hips up, giving Dean what he wanted.
Dean sighs and feels the tension leak out of his shoulders and back a bit. "I still want to." He says, and Cas looks up at him with a shining smile. Dean can feel his lips turn up on their own accord, and the chicken at his feet clucks happily.
Dean was his best friend, and had been since ninth grade. They had done everything together, football games, Friday nights at the arcade, weekend sleepovers binging on junk food and movies. They'd even gone to college together, both majoring in education. And, when graduation rolled around, they both managed to find jobs at the same highschool.
Dean shakes his head, giving a self deprecating laugh. "You know what? If you didn't want to see me anymore, you should've just said that instead of cutting me out." His voice sounds defeated.
It's damn nice of Cas to ask first, and it makes Dean feel warm inside that Cas paid enough attention to him tonight to get a feel for what he likes. "Go for it." Dean says, nodding behind the bar.
Dean hopped down off the table, and brushed past Cas as he headed toward the hall. Dean stopped, and turned around looking at Cas. "You coming?" He asked.
Dean is being distant, and Cas is worried. It's been a week since they've seen each other, and everything seemed fine at the time.
The jeans were a little bit of a struggle to get on, but once they were on he felt he could actually move fine in them. He pulled the sweater over his head, then slid the blazer over it.
Cas realized hed found that wonderful bundle of nerves, and angeled himself so each thrust hit it in just the right spot.
Cas dislodges his mouth, only to attack Dean's neck, sucking a dark mark into it while grinding their hips together.
"I am not. There's no reason for me to." He tries, again, to pass the bag over, but Claire just crosses her arms.
Sighing, Cas pulls himself up and heads back out to his workshop, getting lost in his work until long after the sun has sunk beyond the horizon.
It's silent for a couple of minutes, the only noises the car and the chickens settling in in the back. Finally, Dean has to ask, because he's been waiting fucking months and he can't wait anymore. "So, chickens? I mean, you've brought some weird stuff on there, the door, the statue, the fucking toilet? What's up with that? And why chickens?"
Around noon, Sam, Eileen, and the kids drop by for a couple hours for lunch and to give Emma her presents from them; a board game she wanted, a couple of books that she squeals over, and an entire makeup kit which makes Dean send his bother death glares and he responds with pointing to Eileen and mouthing 'blame her'.
Dean walked back over to his seat, setting his glass down and sitting down next to Cas again. He leaned over, getting close to Cas' ear, and whispered "you shouldn't volunteer to do research, have I taught you nothing?" He leaned back a bit, and winked.
"Wearing my clothes, Cas. Does something to me" Dean breathed out between kisses, as he slowly moved his hand inside of Cas' shirt.
It doesn't take long for it to pick up. Cas opens his mouth a little, and Dean swipes his tongue out, pulling a moan from Cas' throat when they meet. It's a beautiful sound, and Dean wants to hear more. Gripping harder, Dean pulls Cas even closer, feeling his hard warm body against his, delving his tongue further into Cas' mouth.
He wants kids. He always has, but he'd almost resigned himself to probably never having a partner, a relationship, strong enough for them. But now that he has that, he
"Just temporarily," Cas had said. "Until you find someplace else. That way you don't have to rush into something you don't like."
"The gentleman said that you mumbled expletives and rolled your eyes at him when he expressed concern. He said that you were unprofessional." Naomi says, eyeing him.
Cas gestures for him to follow, and they head back toward the porch. "Uh, you know this chicken keeps following me" Dean says, glaring down at her where she walks next to him.
When they'd conversed about it, Cas had said wistfully that he hopes one day someone will give him one. And Dean had brought this home.
And that's another whole topic right there. What happened to Emma's mother? Dean said they'd been alone since she was a baby. The man is single, as far as Cas can tell. He sighs to himself. Don't even go there. Not now, not ever again.
As they kissed, Cas pushed Dean back on the bed, crawling up next to him. He paused, making sure there were no objections from Dean. When he didnt get any, he threw his leg over Dean's, straddling him.
He leans over and kisses Dean. "I'll be right back, my love." He says quietly, before heading into the bathroom to clean himself up, grab a washcloth and head back to the bed. Cas gently removes the ruined panties, his dick twitching a little at the mess of come in them, so damn hot, before cleaning his husband up and tossing the rag to the floor. He pulls the blankets up around them, then guides Dean into his arms pressing a kiss to his forehead.
With memories of the last time he opened this door clouding his vision, Dean pushes it open and steps inside only to stop dead in his tracks.
"Now, about that complaint." Naomi says, looking at her desk again, and Dean's confused because he thought that
A couple of hours, and many many drinks later, Dean was pretty hammered. They'd discussed everything from where they'd travelled, to some of Courtney's most interesting patients. Dean was really enjoying himself, and it seemed like Cas was too.
It's a Wednesday when it first happens. A regular old boring ordinary Wednesday. Dean maneuvers the bus down his usual route, picking up regulars and new faces alike.
Dean grips his hips tightly, then spins them around until Cas' back is pressed against the door, pushing into him, against him, diving his tongue into Cas' mouth. Cas just clings to him, can't get enough, wants more, wants everything.
Cas looked down at Dean. The sight of Dean on his knees, his member in his mouth, was enough to make him want to come undone right there. Then Cas saw Dean's hand down his own pants, stroking himself, and he almost lost all control.
Dean glanced over at Cas, who'd been quiet pretty much the whole time. He didnt look upset though. He actually looked... pleased. That was strange.
"I'm clean, it's been a long time." Cas says, and looks into Dean's eyes so he knows he's being honest.
Cas shakes his head but smiles. "I'm not. I told you, they weren't planned." He sighs. "I went there to buy something else from the guy that he'd posted on Craigslist, and he had the chickens. Said he couldn't take care of them, something about them being his wife's and she left, I don't really know. Anyway, he said he was just going to dump them off somewhere, or turn them into dinner, and I couldn't just leave them."
Pulling back for a moment, Cas reaches into his nightstand and pulls out lube and a condom, then returns his lips to Dean's skin, unable to get enough, wanting to taste every part of him.
Without a word, Cas grabbed Dean by the ass and lifted him up against himself, setting him on the desk.
"Do you know why" Cas coughs to clear his throat, shifts around, he can feel his finger twitch against his thigh. "Why he left? Why he didn't say anything?"
"'Ello?" He says as Cas groans behind him. He can feel Cas bury his face into his back, and can't help the small laugh that comes out.
Dean leaned up and kissed Cas gently. "You took care of me, now I take care of you." Dean said. Once he was done, he tossed the washcloth onto the floor and laid down next to Cas.
The tears continue their way down his cheeks, and he forces himself to swallow around the sobs threatening to come out. He will not let himself break down anymore.
Cas is just standing there, looking at Dean with heartache written on his face, and it fucking hurts so much.
"So, did you guys figure out your project before you moved on to manicures?" Dean asks, giving his daughter a knowing look.
." The words are tumbling out, Dean too lost in it to even know what he's saying. "God, want you to fuck me Cas. Wanna feel you inside me. Come on me, mark me, wanna feel it.
"Well I dont think theres anything left to say." Cas stated, then turned around and started to walk away.
This is what he's been waiting for, as he fingers the hem of Dean's jeans. His own cock is full, pressing uncomfortably against his pants, but it'll have to wait. He
"You can't know everything, sweetheart. She's here and you're here and they're gonna take care of her. It'll all be fine." Dean's fingers are carding through his hair, and he just let's them because it feels nice and its grounding.
Assaulting Dean's prostate over and over again, Cas pulled his hand out of Dean's, and slipped it between them, fisting it around Dean's throbbing cock, rubbing it up and down.
When Gabriel finally leaves, its wonderfully blessedly quiet for a little while and Cas dozes in the chair, while Claire nods off. He's just so tired, and can't wait to get Claire home and himself back in his own bed.
Feeling arms wrap around his waist, Cas sighs and leans back into Dean. "That's all of it." Dean says, kissing Cas' temple.
Cas still doesn't say anything, so Dean reaches into the bag again and pulls out the second travel mug and hands that over to Cas too. "Coffee." Dean says, then stands there awkwardly as Cas continues to stare, just holding a thing in a each hand.
Dean leaned down and kissed Cas lightly. Leaning his weight on his left forearm, and moving his other hand up into Cas hair, he pulled back to stare into his eyes. "I love you. I love you so much it hurts sometimes. I dont know why I always stopped myself from having this. From having you. We could've had so much time together... I'm just glad I didnt wait till it was too late to tell you. I cant promise you I'll never do anything to piss you off, because, well, you know me." He stopped and chuckled a bit. "But I can promise that, no matter what, I wont let you go again."
