"Few days," Steve says, giving him a gentle smile. "Almost a week. But you saved the world, Tony. The whole universe."
"Tony, how could I
"Steve. Check in," Bucky says.
Steve does his best to ignore the look, but he can only last so long in the face of Sam's 'Talk To Me' glare.
"I talked to Natasha. Called her when I heard you were stuck to make sure she was okay to stay with Casey overnight or if she needed reinforcements or anything brought over."
"Hi Bucky! Guess what? Steve taught me art things!"
“Absolutely,” Tony said, staring at the ground, feeling his hands slip. As far as ideas went, he’d had better. He’d also had a hell of a lot worse. So, call it even.
Whatever is wrong with Vision, Shuri's lab is going to be far more helpful than the medical ward. Vision leans heavily against him as they walk, but insists on getting there under his own power. Stubborn. Not surprising, looking at the factors that had helped create him.
"Then why did you come here, where Vision is?" Thor asked.
He knows that Sam sees the truth on his face, because Sam gives him a sad, sympathetic smile. "Yeah. I'm sorry, man. It's not fair."
Bucky rolls his eyes. "I'll tell you when you're older. Nat, that'll work. I'll figure something out. Meet us at the shop tomorrow morning?"
"Don't suppose there was contact info on that flyer?" Tony asks hopefully. He needs to track this hipster coffee shop owner down, he needs to make this whole thing go away. No hipster coffee shop with an open patio, no nondescript strangers sitting at a table all day drinking coffee and watching his son's school. None of it. It's completely unacceptable.
"Sure, sure, but you can handle it, right?"
"Couldn't be better," Tony replies.
“Bad time?” A voice calls, and Steve quickly turns to see, surprisingly, Tony Stark standing there, watching him carefully.
"I did not know. Great work, that's pretty amazing."
Tony barks out a laugh. “Well you’re not wrong there. Lucky for you, they’re all for good reasons.”
His hand starts shaking a little, but Tony is right there, still holding on, absently swiping his thumb across the back of Steve's palm. He's always struggled to talk about that day, but there is something about laying in the dark and the quiet, and the point in the night where everything feels a little surreal, that makes it easier. Like the words disappear into the darkness, harmless. "One minute we were driving, and the next, my ears are ringing and the vehicle is laying upside down on the road. I was trying to get my seat belt undone, and I could hear civilians screaming outside, and my own troops shouting. Must have gotten myself undone, because I hit the ground and crawled out. Nicki was already outside, she was bleeding, but mostly okay. She grabbed Clint, and I – I went for Bucky. He –" Steve squeezes his eyes shut and takes a moment to compose himself. It's alright. Bucky was okay. Bucky
me because you want to keep it for yourselves."
Tony breathes a sigh of relief, but he's still anxious as all hell. "Back here, but no idea what state, or how hurt."
, Tony. They're still wet from the snow."
“Sure baby, it’ll be fun.”
“It’s all the same to me Tony.” Rasped Steve, his breathing quickening under Tony’s ministrations
“Did you know about this?” Asked Tony the moment Eliza’s car cleared the property gate. The question drew a strange reaction from Steve, his eyes clouded with what could actually be panic.
“Hey, no peeking! You’ll get your say on it after I’m done and before you ask, Pepper needs it asap.”
“How many beers Tony?”
The words sink through Tony’s ears and into his tastebuds, flooding his mouth with a foul taste.
When he fought Tony. After that no one had ever trusted him the same way again, not even himself.
Smiling, Steve pushed off the covers and got on his feet, leaving Tony alone to collect his thoughts and make his way back to his own bedroom.
Steve’s voice sounded wrecked and the words were so painfully raw Tony could feel how desperate he really was. This would’ve been the perfect opportunity for Tony to convince Steve to free him. He could’ve convinced him to let him call SI, to drive him to an airport, to leave him alone forever but unfortunately Tony already knew the answer to Steve’s question.
Steve gave in if only so they could have one good thing to remember this miserable year by. Like the first time around Tony was summoned for a The Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing, unlike then, Tony now owned the proprietary weight to defend both the Iron Man and Commander armours.
“Yes, of course. Have you had any time to look over the new data?”
The love in Steve’s eyes must have been mighty because Tony seemed to glow under it. His entirely face taking on a pinkness that hadn’t been there just a heartbeat ago.
He slapped the paper down in front of Tony with the biggest smile. Then with a dramatic sigh, Tony read through the three page, impeccable looking work manifesto.
Steve enjoyed the hunger in Tony’s eyes, the way brown eyes took in every bit of exposed skin, every muscle underneath. He loved how bold Tony was about touching him in public, how shameless he could be about burying those soft, spotted hands into Steve’s blonde hair and yanking him down into a filthy kiss. He delighted about how little Tony seemed to care these days about anything other than them and their little world.
“So, I was thinking, and feel free to say no if you want, I’m literally just throwing ideas around… we have all this space right? And yeah Pepper has her own floor, and Rhodey’s here with her when he’s on Leave but we still have lots of space and well, how would you feel about giving your clone a room downstairs somewhere?”
“Why?” Peggy questioned.
It wasn’t that Tony feared loneliness per say, rather it was that it made him profoundly uncomfortable.
“Then let’s call it a day.”
This unexpected last addition is dedicated to every single person who has continued showing an interest in this story over the years. Thank you for your comments, for your support and for your time. You helped keep this story well dusted in my mind and I know it took a while but I hope not to disappoint you.
It was so easy.
“If that’s what you want...”
“Why are you so afraid of us arguing?”
Being the brilliant tactician Steve Rogers still prided himself in being, he got to work right away. At first Tony’s response had been hesitant, but with endurance Steve eventually got Tony to talk about his days in boarding school, about his relationship with Howard and Maria, about why Rhodey was his best friend and finally, why he didn’t want to be involved in Stark Industries.
“The rest of our lives. Things will get bumpy in a few years but I’m not leaving you and you’re not leaving me.”
He was about to do another swipe with the razor but stopped. Tony stood facing him, a look of pure seriousness in his face.
It’s obvious as they all pack into Vivi’s SUV, that he’s the only one in the dark as to where they are going. His confusion only rises when he realizes they are nowhere near the kid-friendly restaurants they frequent. Instead they head to a trendy area of downtown Knoxville and suddenly he knows exactly where they’re going.
“It did not flatten half the world Tony.”
It was as if Peggy was finally seeing him for the first time. Not Captain America, not the Steve from her memories, but Steve Rogers as he sat before her now. A look of profound understanding and sadness filled her features.
“Just call him Cap.”
“Yeah, does being in a romantic relationship with him make you happy?”
“Hello Sir!”
That was Steve’s new favourite phrase as of late; ‘we have plenty of time.’ It was as if whatever moment he’d been dreading had finally evaporated. Tony had had a vague idea about what that moment was (he’d known it had to be a war) but Eliza had elaborated a little more.
The seedy looking bar has been around since the second world war, and it looks it. The air is both stale and permeated in cigarette smoke, the lights are low, the floors sticky and the walls look downright dusty. Nothing’s changed… right down to the heavily scarred man that’s watching his every move.
“Go sit down.” She winks at him as she says it, a smile on her lips. Tony can only nod and hold on to Arlen as he walks to the living room and does just that. Siggy is quick to take a seat beside him and on her other side, a scowling Harley squeezes in. It’s a tight fit for a two-seater but he honestly couldn’t care less. He maneuvers Arlen so she’s draped across his lap and although she’s no longer sleeping, she seems perfectly content to stay where she is.
“We can make it time.”
---Three Years Later---
Everybody else ignored it like one ignores a large hairy dark mole on the tip of a small nose. The late Supreme Leader hadn’t liked it at all. In fact he'd gone above and beyond to try and rid his Commander of the pesky obsession until the Commander finally decided to get rid of HIM.
Tony laughs, a happy, merry sound. “That’s great you guys! This calls for a toast!”
“You’re being stubborn, just use this toilet. I still have to shave anyway and you know how long that takes with this shitty razor”
And Tony was indeed kidnapped.
There were things Tony and Steve didn’t talk about. They didn’t talk about how Steve had come to acquire so many scars, they didn’t talk about why Steve always wanted to have his eyes on Tony or why Tony sought out every ounce of attention. They never talked about why having Steve at his beck and call pleased Tony so much he sometimes ‘accidentally’ dropped a glass just to watch Steve clean it up for him and fuss about Tony not getting splinters in his feet. They didn’t talk about Bucky or why Tony refused to go back to SI even after his Sabbatical was over.
“That tree taken or can anyone join?”
Thor smiles a toothy, dorky smile down at Tony. “We shall be in touch.” He tells him, it sounds like a promise made in blood and Tony smiles.
In an instant Steve had Tony spun around to face him but the movement proved too much for the towel wrapped around Tony’s waist, it fell to the ground in an unceremonious heap.
“Agh, we gotta start looking for a place to live. Maybe a condo in Manhattan? Naw, we can afford a house, a nice redstone in Manhattan”
“No… You were my best friend, it wasn’t until many, many years later that I realized how much I loved you”
He remembered the first time he did this. He’d been nineteen, barely a few weeks into their relationship and he’d done it simply because he couldn’t believe he could. ‘What nineteen year old gets to have THIS?’ He’d though then.
It didn’t take long for Steve to know Tony wasn’t alright. He might have come out of it with minor wounds but the nightmares didn’t let up.
“Daddy you need a break.”
“I know… just take care of yourself ok? And tell Nat I said hi… oh, and please remind her that she can’t say a word about this to anyone.”
There’s pictures of her Daddy in High School, pictures of him in College, pictures of him on outings and vacations. He is always with someone, with people named Sam and Bucky, Scott, Clint, Darcy, the Banners and a few with her Mom and her biological dad. There are traces of her Daddy everywhere, little footprints as light as paws on a dusting of snow.
He has a cracked rib, a sprained ankle, a black eye, a bloody mess of knuckles, more bruises than anyone can see… and he’s king of the fucking world.
This time around, Tony did not hold back the questions. Steve could be cleaning the stove top and Tony washing dishes when all of a sudden he’d hear “But when did you realize you were in love with the other-dimension me?” or they could be lying in bed, about to fall asleep when Steve would hear “How much older was I when I met you? I must have been like, forty or something.”
“Yep. He’s in. Pretty sure he’s only doing it because he gets to tear at something that was Howard’s but he’s in.”
“What?”
Those words, spoken from any other lips would have sounded like platitudes to Tony, but not from Bruce. Tony lets them sit and soak comfortably into his heart and when he draws in his Science-Bro for a hug with his left arm, he does so with love.
The real problem, Steve realized, was that Captain America was having problems reconciling the facts that were being paraded before his very eyes. For here was a version of himself, so unlike himself, that it had to mean he didn’t know himself as well as he thought he did.
Anyone else would have asked Tony about it, would have pushed to know what prompted the change. Unfortunately, Steve was far from that person and if anything, he was suckling on his husband’s growing dependence like a bear robbing a honey comb. Beside it wasn’t like anyone had perceived any changes. At this age, having spouses at friends’ night out was as ordinary as soap.
“Now THAT’S a hunk!”
Steve smiles, tries to make it seem sheepish… cute… innocent.
When their plane landed back in Massachusetts on Sunday afternoon, Steve had made up his mind about the Howard situation.
All three nod in understanding, cautious fear evident in their little faces.
“Babe, could you please grab some milk on the way back from the gym?”
The only advantage of time is knowledge gained, thus High Commander Rogers prepared himself well.
Tony took hold of her chubby little hands as he pressed one kiss on each hanging cheek.
High Commander Rogers had no delusions about how history would remember him. He would probably go down in the books as a power-hungry dictator 100 years from now.
“Goodnight Starks!”
In an instant Tony is in the kitchen, close enough to Steve that he can reach out, grab hold of his wrist and pull him in between Steve’s thighs. Tony goes willingly, his body pliant…warm against Steve’s chest.
Tony’s brow lifted, admonishing him without words.
Gently, Steve took off Tony’s clothes and pushed the tailored suit and brand name dress shirt inside a garbage bag. Next he injected Tony again, this time in his left arm with another stronger dose of the sedative before lifting him in his arms and moving him to the bathroom. In the bathroom Steve took his time bathing Tony, he’d bought a special terrycloth towel and shampoo for the occasion. He was careful to wash him thoroughly while still keeping his own wandering hands mostly at bay. Steve allowed himself to stroke Tony’s torso and legs but he kept his touch purely clinical when it came to his groin and butt. One day, Tony would beg for his touch, just like he used to when they were young, but until then Steve would be a gentleman. After securing Tony in the bathtub using a towel for his back, Steve foamed Tony’s chin and ran a new razor through Tony’s signature Balbo beard, shaving it right off. Next he took out the dark blonde hair dye he’d bought and quickly started to apply it to Tony’s hair. While he waited for the dye to take, Steve left Tony in the warm water while he finished shaving off what remained of his full beard. He’d cut it a bit to do the deed but had kept some facial hair just in case he was seen or caught on a security camera. Now though, with Tony here he could cut it all off and let his natural blonde hair grow back out. A few minutes later the dye had set and Steve rinsed Tony off completely. Once Tony was dry, dressed and lying on the bed, Steve quickly relieved himself and went on to wash out the tub with bleach and wipe out the bathroom using special wipes to destroy any prints.
The words seem to sink in slowly and it occurs to Tony that Bruce might be having a hard time reconciling the Steve they thought they knew with this new, ‘family’ obsessed man who dumped his partner of nine years to pursue 2.5 kids, a wife and a white picket fence.
He even has ten thousand dollars sitting pretty in his pant pocket.
“Y’all ready?”
He sounds downright cheerful now and the smile that paints his lips feels less like a wince. This he can do, being strong for Sigrid is something he has considerable experience with.
A responsible parent would have been outside with him, would have wanted to spend time with him.
She stopped and Tony knew this was all the information he would retrieve from her today. She was forthcoming about some things but she carefully guarded anything that had to do with wars or battles. From what Tony was putting together, there must have been many wars over the years and the outcome of all that must have put Steve in a terrible position.
Steve nods, his focus solely on the beer in front of him. He looks like he wants to say more but is holding back. Tony hopes it stays that way, there’s nothing that Steve Rogers can tell him at this moment that would make anything better.
Steve grows used to the sound of cracked porcelain (they switch to metal and plastic), used to the midday naps (they make Tony even sweeter than he thought possible), used to the bouts of dizziness.
“Thought you just wanted me for the packaging”
“Just obey me in the field and I’ll leave you alone.” Cap spat.
He throws a fifty at the cabbie and is jumping out the instant they’re in Bushwick. He gets a few looks, (4pm on a Thursday wearing a suit), but not nearly as many as he would have gotten twenty years earlier. Slowly, he feels himself uncoil.
“Sir. Councilwoman Rhodes tasked me with delivering a message to you.”
"He's
"Rhodey!"
thorough background checks he'd started on the (very) short list of possible nanny candidates. Casey will be done school in just a few weeks – Tony doesn't have much time to waste.
He leans forward and presses a gentle kiss to Tony's lips.
“Technically, it’s your fault. You’re the one who suggested we should all live together,” Steve points out.
“Okay, fine. So this is exactly what it looks like. Or, wait. Maybe I just wanted to come and talk to you?”
"Yes, I think he will recover swiftly," Thor agrees.
Tony dreads the day that Casey decides he's too old to hug and kiss his father goodbye.
"Okay, look, pal," Rogers says, and suddenly Tony feels like the man is eight feet taller than him, glaring down at him in indignation. "I don't know who you think you are that you can tell me where I can or cannot set up my coffee shop, but if you think I'm just going to let you – let you discriminate against me because of my sexuality, and keep the homos out of your
"– because I seriously cannot deal with that on top of everything else right now, okay?" He barrels forward, completely ignoring Steve. "I am up to my neck in R&D for a new initiative that needs to be ready to present to the shareholders in a few weeks which is
"He's breathing on his own," Natasha says. "Dr. Strange said that's a very good sign."
"Tony, there's still time to salvage this meeting, but I don't understand why you aren't here already. This is
"Sorry about that," Steve says guiltily. "I didn't –"
Steve chuckles, and shakes his head. “No, of course you didn’t. You just built a tower with space designed specifically for each one of us, and space to expand in case the team grew. And a dedicated training facility. And everything we could need. You built us a home, but no, of course not. You never suggested we all come and live there.”
"Done," Rhodey says without hesitation. "Send me your location and I'll be there."
But he doesn't – he has to get up, get Casey's lunch packed, and make breakfast before Casey goes to school. Then he has to make his way to Brooklyn and be as charming as possible to persuade Brewed Awakening to change their mind about their new location.
+++++
The rest of them are sitting up now, too. Rhodey next to Tony, and Sam across the room beside Steve. Tony still can't bring himself to look at Steve's bed, or even in that general direction. He can't risk that eye contact.
"Yeah, Clint thinks he's funny," Steve shrugs. "The name was his idea."
After a moment's hesitation, Steve flicks at the screen and answers the call. Instead of turning it to speaker phone, he holds the phone up to Tony's ear as Tony works, and is rewarded with a grateful, if slightly distracted look.
called him 'sugarplum,'" Steve says, still looking confused – and a little wild around the eyes.
“Of course you can,” he protests.
him."
"So why you?"
"What? Whoa, no, Steve, buddy," Rhodey interrupts, looking stricken. "You can't possibly think you could have – that's like saying
"Nah, I just don't feel like moving," Steve says, lips twitching.
"I figured we could compromise, so I did some research, and I think I've found a couple of other locations nearby in the neighbourhood that would be great."
+++++
Tony had swiped his phone and punched some stuff into it before they’d left the gym the other day, and Steve hadn’t thought anything of it at the time. Apparently, it had been so he could get Steve’s phone number.
"It's fine," Steve says, managing to extricate himself from his own tangle and push himself up to sitting. "It's – it's not your fault I mean, mornings are – hoo boy, mornings, right?"
Get it out of his system, so to speak.
Steve's hands are pushing at Tony's clothes clumsily, eyes roaming over Tony's body as he reveals skin. His hands are surprisingly soft, except for a few calluses here and there.
“But you were thinking about it at least a little,” Tony says. Steve can’t argue, because it’s true.
Steve, letting himself sink into the hot water of the bath, and that noise – that
+++++
It still somehow manages to feel like the longest day ever – longer even then the day before when he'd been counting down the minutes until Steve's plane landed. Now, he'd gotten a taste of actually having he and Steve in the same place, with schedules that cross paths, however slightly. And he wants more.
As he walks toward the office, he already has his phone out, searching for more information on Brewed Awakening. He's going to find a way to nip this whole thing in the bud.
If Tony had any less self control, he might have started sobbing right then and there. Fortunately, his emotional tangent was interrupted by a well-placed Dummy, who beeped happily and rolled across the shop towards Steve. He raised his arm, claw opening and closing rapidly as he kept up his string of delighted beeps and boops.
"You know this is totally not how I pictured this day ending," Tony huffs, his breath a little strained.
And then JARVIS cuts in. "Sir, may I remind you that you have a meeting in less than an hour.”
Rhodey keeps talking, and Tony keeps staring across the room at Steve as he gives those great big thousand-watt grins to every patron that walks up to the counter.
“Hm, way to give me mixed signals.” Tony huffs at that, but Steve continues. “I love you, too. You found dinner, I see.”
"Tones, god, I'm so sorry," Rhodey mutters as Tony sinks against him. Tony turns his face to hide it against Rhodey's chest as he feels hot tears prickle at his eyes.
chair, which he's been sitting on for probably close to 24 hours – and gestures to it. She gives him a long look before she takes the chair.
"Don't stop," Steve says, voice low and warm and intimate. "I didn't say stop."
"I'm not admitting to anything," he says, and Rhodey nods understandingly, lips twitching with a smile. "And you're wrong, because I don't have any romantic feelings at all, and so there will be no asking anyone out. But we're still going to go to Brewed Awakening, even though you are very, very wrong, because Steve makes very, very good coffee."
"We're not going to be able to hide Vision forever –"
“You were saying?”
Shit, shit,
"You still crashed your car, Tony," Rhodey says desperately. "You're lucky you're okay."
Assets that had since started showing up on the streets, and in the hands of other less-than-savory operations. Insight had been dismantled and Zola destroyed, but they were still left picking up the pieces in the wreckage that was left behind.
"Well, I wasn't," Bucky shrugs. "Or I never thought I was. But. Clint."
Less than a day now. He can make it.
He turns to Thor, still there, beside him. His expression is grave as he steps in front of Steve and clutches Steve's bicep in one meaty hand. "Don't worry, Captain. He is gravely injured, yes, but Stark has won the day. And I've met only one man more stubborn than he is." Thor gives him an exaggerated wink, and Steve can't help the ghost of a smile that twitches up one corner of his mouth.
"So, nothing too catastrophic while I was gone?" Steve says as he shoves a piece of chicken into his mouth.
The doors close, and the three men look at each other quietly for a moment as the elevator cabin starts to rise.
Casey giggles. "No!"
"You're the worst."
He finds his way out of the medical wing, and finds someone to tell him where he might find food and a shower. Everyone knows who he is, so there's no hesitation – the woman gives him directions to some quarters set aside for him. She tells him someone will bring food up shortly, and gives him a small bead that, when he holds it between his thumb and forefinger, displays a blue holographic map in front of him. He gives her a tired but grateful smile, then follows the directions from the bead to find his rooms in the palace.
, they'd gained ground. The glove out of Thanos' possession means they have the power to
, certainly not to the extent that he could be deemed ‘the guy my dad never shut up about.’ Stark had caught him flat footed — a feeling he had been experiencing a lot in the past week and a half, and one he was growing to hate with every fiber of his being.
"What happened to Casey's mom?"
“Yeah, I know,” Tony says as he opens the fridge and pauses. There, staring up at him is a plate of food, lovingly assembled and wrapped in plastic to keep it fresh. On top of the plate is a sticky note that reads in precise, blocky letters: ‘FOR TONY ONLY. JARVIS IS WATCHING YOU.’ Under the words is a little cartoon skull that somehow manages to look both adorable and threatening at the same time. God, Tony loves this man.
"Hi Steve!" Casey waves his little hand so hard it looks like it might fly right off. "Daddy says that you're stuck in a snowstorm."
"Yeah, but, I told you, that was no big deal. I like fixing things. Really, you were doing
"There's a report about eggs being bad for you again," Steve says.
"Good night, Steve," Tony says.
Steve doesn't think anyone has ever looked so beautiful.
They were going to dinner after Tony’s meeting with the board. Tony had spent the entire time watching the minutes tick away until it was time to go, distracted and giddy with anticipation.
They eat dinner, and then it's time for Casey's bath. They play in the tub for a while, with Casey making use of the brightly coloured bath crayons. Casey uses shampoo to turn his glossy hair into a ridiculous mohawk, giggling and squealing happily, and Tony really,
They chat idly a few minutes more before Tony ends the call. He's just starting to feel a little more at ease when he hears splashing coming from the bathroom, followed by grunts and hushed cursing. Tony immediately springs to his feet and darts into the bathroom in time to find Steve half leveraging himself out of the tub with just his arms. He looks so much like an awkward, forlorn seal flopping around that Tony can't help the sharp burst of laughter.
Steve glances up at the clock, and it's right around the time that Casey normally gets out of school. The bell rings on the door, and Steve looks up hopefully, to see Casey coming in with Natasha in tow. A small part of him is disappointed Tony isn't in, but it's nice to catch up with Natasha now that she's integrated into their lives as well – she had been serious about being Clint's new best friend. The two of them fell into step together so naturally Steve would almost swear that they've known each other for years. And these days, seeing Casey brightens Steve's day as much as seeing Tony.
Tony winces visibly. "Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that. I really am. I wasn't trying to suggest anything or, you know –"
"Nah, you stay here and set the kitchen on fire for the insurance money, I'll go give him a hand."
anything,” Tony growls, stepping closer into Steve’s space. Before Steve realises what’s happening, Tony’s hands are clinging to his shirt and shoving him back hard until his back hits the wall. Then Tony is pressing up against him, pinning him in place as he kisses Steve hard enough to take his breath away. Steve gasps in shock and Tony takes advantage of the surprise to press deeper, sliding his tongue between Steve’s lips. Steve’s brain catches up a moment later, his hands drop to hold onto Tony’s hips, and suddenly Steve is kissing him back with all the desperation and desire he’s been trying to ignore since they’d met. Tony breaks the kiss and pulls back after a moment, and Steve whines softly at the loss of contact, fighting the urge to chase after Tony’s mouth again.
because nothing is going to happen. His mind can wander down that path all it wants, but it's looking at a future that is never going to happen. One that he'll never have.
His pocket chimes, and at first, the sound doesn’t register for what it is. Then it chimes again and Steve realises, startled, that it’s his phone. Which… doesn’t really make sense. His phone doesn’t go off. He doesn’t have anyone who’d try and reach him. No one even has his number except SHIELD.
here, and this conversation is happening whether he likes it or not. His brain seems completely on board with this, because before he realises what he’s saying, Steve is growling back, “I can’t stand being so close to you, knowing you can’t stand to be around me. I can’t stand having you so close and being reminded all the time that I want you and can never have you. That I can’t even manage to be
Pepper sighs at the other end of the line. She knows how hard it's been in recent weeks with the both of them having schedules that just don't line up. "If, and I do mean
"But, your suit."
"What
"Polyethylene glycol, yeah."
"Okay," Steve says, steadying his nerves and letting his brain fall back into its crisis mode reflexes. "We need to call for help."
The change in track throws Tony for a moment, but he doesn't hesitate to answer. "Three years since Thanos."
Tony doesn't argue. He checks his phone to make sure he has service – which of course he does, even though it's barely up the highway from where he had no service at all – and heads over towards the closed off dining area to make his call.
Natasha steps to the side and grabs her tea, taking a seat at a table close to the counter. A few minutes later, Tony walks in, right on schedule, and Steve visibly perks up. This would be so much easier if they could just corner Steve into telling Tony how he feels, but Bucky knows him best, and also he's right. They try that, and Steve is going to end up doing a solid impression of a clam on roller skates and that will be the end of it. They'll be stuck in Steve-making-sad-puppy-faces hell forever. Or worse, they'll fuck things up entirely and one of them will pull away, and this whole dynamic they've built between all of them – which Clint really likes, okay? – will all come crashing down around them. No, Bucky's right. Painful as it is to have to wait, they need to be smart.
Bucky comes out of the back and exchanges a few words with Steve as Steve is placing the baked goods on little plates. Steve heads toward their table, and Bucky starts wiping up the counter.
For a fleeting moment, he contemplates why Tony would reach out to him, of all people, in the middle of the night, but he doesn’t have the energy to pursue that thought. The cool night air might be refreshing, but his head is still a fuzzy mess and he’s not thinking much beyond ‘walk.’ So he shelves the thought, but it’s still sitting there prominently, just under the surface.
"Hey, Steve," Tony says, nodding his head and strolling up to the counter. "Can we get a couple of Clint's cannolis, too? And a coffee for my friend?"
Finally, he's about eye-level with Steve's erection, straining against the confines of his boxer briefs. Tony can't quite help himself, and he licks at the fabric, sucking the head of Steve's cock into his mouth. Even through the cotton, Tony can feel the solid heat of him. Steve's fingers tighten a little in Tony's hair, but he doesn't pull or push. It's more like he's holding on a little tighter.
"It's just, you know, a really nice, quiet family neighbourhood, and we just don't think that –"
they want, they just gave me that address." He waves his hand at the piece of scrap paper he'd written the address on. It's out by the docks, because of course it is. "They said to come alone or they'd kill him."
"Yes," Strange informs him. "Which at least gives us a place to start. But we need to move fast. There is a good chance he's injured."
"I'm okay," Steve tells the stranger.
It had been strange, watching the odd-looking spaceship full of aliens – and Peter Quill – touch down in the middle of the Avengers Compound. Tony had watched from his window for a bare moment before suiting up, calling for Rhodey to do the same, and then going to confront the ship.
‘Death still scares you boy.’ Though the Commander.
There’s no ‘what happened?’ no ‘get home now,’ no demand for an immediate explanation… just understanding. Just love. Because that’s who Tony is. That’s how amazing his Tony is.
Tony sighed, dramatically “Fine, let’s go be senior citizens together.”
Tony is hoping to milk it for a good ten more years, though Vivi will never abide by it of course. While Tony watches Arlen devour her sandwich in the most un-princess like manner possible, he wonders what Vivi and Stephen have planned for tonight. They very specifically told him not to make plans for his birthday but all he knows is that Vivi will be picking him and the kids up at six. He suspects that dinner will be involved and possibly cake. He hopes they’re not going to a restaurant, not because he dislikes the establishments but because the list of restaurants one can successfully take three kids under the age of eleven to, is rather limited.
Vivi is the kind of woman Tony would have fallen in love with… had he been so inclined. But Tony is a proud gay man and if anything, that makes Vivi feel like she can hold on to him and never let go.
‘Patience’
“Tony, Tony can you hear me?”
“But you’re not just being nosy. You want to find out more about your Mom and your biological Dad right?”
It occurred to Steve that this was what happiness must feel like.
“For what?”
Tony looked Steve right in the eyes, his expression a map of love.
“I don’t think it’s my blood.”
“So is that a yes?”
And finally, after eleven years there’s the truth. He’s always suspected that something along those lines had occurred, but he never actually thought that all the unanswered emails and messages and calls had been directly caused by Steve. Hurt bubbles up in his throat, that old feeling of being wronged coming back to the surface.
He grows used to the days when Tony curls up on the floor and cries because he broke yet another thing. He grows used to the way Tony fits in the curve of his neck and the taste of his frustrated tears.
“Sorry babe, you’re just too delicious.”
“Where did you find him?”
“Thanks Stephen!” Tony calls out.
“I like…you.”
He was tempted to go look for him but his tactical sense warned him against it. There was a thin line between older friend and authority figure and he needed to not scare Tony away. He needed to stay close enough to be coveted but not so close he became a parent, or a brother. So Steve took a shower and unpacked his backpack. Tony had surprisingly kept the place well, the dishes were done and the kitchen was quite clean. Only the messy living room and the rat’s lair that was Tony’s room told the truth about how the past five days had been spent.
“I ruined us.”
The florescent street lights, typically so unforgiving to the human form cast a beautiful glow on Steve’s face. He’s looking at Tony with such longing, such love that for an instant Tony wants to kiss that look right off his face. Maybe years ago Tony would have done just that. Maybe if Steve had shown up at his doorstep five years ago, Tony would have allowed him back into his heart, into his life, into his bed.
“Sound interesting…” But his train of through went elsewhere because Steve was standing right in front of him, his chest radiating a ridiculous amount of warmth through his cotton t-shirt. Without even a thought to the action, Tony pressed his palms against the warm torso. He ran patterns over the plains of the t-shirt, saw Steve close his eyes, enjoying the touch.
Natasha, as expected, didn’t just let it go. She pursued Steve like a target, acted both demure and predatory in the hopes he would eventually give in and tell her something useful to report back. Unfortunately for her, he knew her too well.
“You know, this whole feral thing? Gotta admit, kinda-very hot.”
It took all of Steve’s self-control not to punch Howard in the mouth.
“If you keep this up, you’re going to be late for work.”
Something finite.
With a heart full of love, Tony kisses the girl’s forehead. “It’s ok, I’ll be all right my liege. Go with your Mamma ok?” He whispers low enough so only she can hear. Brown eyes open and focus on his. ‘Are you sure you don’t need me?’ they seem to say and Tony smiles tenderly down at his little shield. “I’m ok” he reassures her. He helps her to her feet until she finally takes hold of her mother’s hand. But Arlen stalls a little, looking directly at the couch sitting Siggy’s biological dad and the other blonde guy, she sticks her tongue out, high and far, at the two occupants.
He must have cried, must have wailed because later, when the full force of the sun filled the bedroom with its splendor, Steve’s throat was raw. What Steve did not know then was that he’d also managed to break several of Tony’s ribs in his grief, but that wouldn’t matter. Sitting on the bed, with Tony’s corpse in his arms all that the old Commander could think of now was how long it would take him to rig up his plan.
“What makes you unsure?”
“Like I said, I’m not moving anywhere and I’m staying with Daddy forever, but maybe we could keep in touch and you can come visit whenever you’re in the US… or whatever.”
Tony frowned, his thoughts too loud to know what Steve was trying to say.
“Let’s do this.”
“You. Me. Date. No more drugs, no more you in my face all day long. We just spend time with each other like normal fucking people for a few weeks and see how it goes. I’ll call Pepper to let her know I’m safe, ask her to call off the manhunt they probably have going and we just hang out here.”
“What’s that?”
“That doesn’t matter Steve”
“Because he offered to host and I wasn’t about to turn down a perfectly good invite to spend an evenin’ on the lap of luxury.”
“I think you’re right. I think from now on, everything’s coming up roses.”
Edit- April 4 2021. Big thanks to sapphic-futurist and resurrectedhippo for encouraging me to edit this. I’ve left it as is for a long time but since people keep liking it, I gathered it was time to fix the bugs.
Tony often forgets his own age.
Natasha and Bruce laugh with nervous excitement as they all clink beers.
Tony waited until they could share a friendly smile before rising to his feet. She was quick to follow but he gestured for her to stay as she was. Even without turning around Tony knew she was watching him leave the room.
“Tony please don’t go overboard”
“Don’t you have to use the bathroom?”
Steve had no doubt in his mind that Vision despised him, but he also knew he would do everything in his power to make sure Steve made it onto the other dimension safely. If only for the pleasure of being rid of him once and for all.
“Is Justin Hammer still in a coma?”
“Well yes.”
The ceremony was short, symbolic, beautiful. Beside Tony stood Rhodey, beside Steve stood Pepper. When Steve finally looked over at the guests he saw Happy, Yinsen and even Nick Fury. Peggy Carter sat on the front row, a wheelchair by her side more for comfort than for necessity. There were over a hundred faces, all here in either obligation or pleasure just to see Steve finally marry the love of his life. It felt right, felt real.
Tony’s eyes closed again, just like that. One moment awake, one moment asleep but Steve continued smiling down at his beloved’s face. It was nighttime anyway, and they both needed to get some rest. Gently, Steve settled beside his husband for the night. He curled up against Tony and fell asleep almost immediately, his warm hand holding on to fingers badly angled from arthritis, soothing the stiffness.
“Just like that? You don’t even know what I’m planning to do with the armour… or do you? You do don’t you? I did the same thing in your dimension didn’t I?”
“High Commander!”
It doesn’t take long for the last of the living room lights to be turned off, for the doors to be locked and a glass set on the kitchen counter. They make their way up the stairs together and in the darkness of the living room, a plaque reading JANE FOSTER gleams with a stray light.
Pleased with the results, Steve secured back the plate, checked the chain and placed himself in precisely the correct spot. Once lined up, he turned his head so he could stare at Tony’s corpse, pulled on the chain... and smiled.
Making a show of looking around, Steve paused to make contact with Natasha.
“Sir, it was but the machine was still intact. It has now been destroyed.”
The look Tony gives him right there sucks the breath right out of Steve’s lungs. It’s a soulful mixture of love and pain which Steve understands all too well.
Steve watched as Tony’s brown eyes widened, his cheek muscles tensed, his brow furrowed. He’d expected this, he’d known this would be Tony’s reaction.
Finally she finds the account she wanted to snoop into the most, Steve Rogers. She recognizes him from the other pictures and she knows right away that he has to be the ex-boyfriend. As invested as she is, the project comes to an end rather abruptly. No, she doesn’t get caught, but rather she realizes rather unceremoniously that Steve Rogers is married to a woman by the name of ‘Peggy’ and they recently celebrated a ten year anniversary.
“Actually how do you feel about California?”
Tony shrugs. “Took a while to get there but I guess I am.”
It had first hit him while unpacking his belongings in his new room at the Compound. He thought about how Pepper and Tony never made it to their wedding, how he’d never get to see Tony’s eyes crinkle at something funny or hear his voice say “Cap”.
The man who more than ever understood the decisions Tony Stark had made throughout his life.
Tony stared at his partner of eleven years in disbelief before crumbling into laughter.
“And why would I want to know that?”
“Like death. I’ve got to go make sure those idiots don’t unfreeze him. He needs to stay in cryo for the next couple decades.”
No. He did not wish that on anyone, least of all his love. The Commander knew that he no longer had a soul. He’d lost it in a battlefield, somewhere between bashing in someone’s skull and starving entire cities. Steve’s soul was now Tony’s soul and although the old Commander could not die from old age, he wanted his soul to have that last rest which had been denied to it for so long. When Tony died, he would carry them both with him and Steve would ensure his own body, his murdering, scarred body was disposed of.
“Lieutenant Copper please rise.”
Tony needs more help than before, especially when doing anything that requires strength in his hands. Like a warden, Steve is ever vigilant. He buys a slip mat for their bathroom, installs a handrail just in case and listens in carefully every morning for signs that Tony might have slipped in the tub. When breakfast time arrives, Tony minds the stove while Steve chops… same for lunch… same for dinner.
It would take Steve days to realize he’d given away his age.
“Thanks Vivi”
“At least she’s always with you.” Natasha says sweetly.
Steve chuckled but it was a mean sound, one that made it obvious he was laughing at Steve Rogers.
There isn’t a shadow of doubt in Thor’s statement, nor a drop of reproach. Tony certainly does not feel like Thor owes him anything, but at the same time, if that was him in Thor’s shoes, wouldn’t he feel like he’s indebted to the person who has and continues to care, raise, love and protect his biological child?
Had Tony been himself, he would’ve thrown the food at Steve, would’ve bathed him in insults right there and then, would’ve even started figuring out a way to escape, but as things were he wasn’t himself. He felt tired, and drowsy and his brain felt like it was floating in molasses, so Tony just took the offered tray and focused on getting forkful of eggs into his mouth.
Bucky Barnes came out of cryo-sleep at the end of 2012. Tony insisted on setting up the mind-washed former Soldier with the best mental health team money could buy and a few days after Bucky woke up, Steve Rogers was summoned to collect his best friend.
“Steve, if only he’d waited he could have had that family he wanted.”
A deep, half laugh half sob broke through Steve’s lower belly, spilling onto his throat.
Steve couldn’t be prouder. If only his staff worked as hard as his Tony did, he’d be a billionaire by now.
“I know. Because I have you.”
“I’m sure we can come up with something.”
Six months later Yinsen would become an instrumental figure in the development of low-cost, long-lasting prosthetics for people in developing countries and a year after that he would amaze his colleagues with his skill in attaching human nerve endings to cybertronic prosthetics.
“How is your mission coming along?”
Tony doesn’t buy it.
Tony looks down at the baby carrier in his arms where a two month old baby wiggles experimentally.
“Are the meteors expected to destroy earth?”
He plans to draw Tony a bath today… pick up some dinner… get the milk he asked for. Not letting the thought slip, Steve grabs the office phone and dials a well known combination.
Reflected in the mirror, Tony saw Steve’s jaw harden, his brows furrowing. Tony sighed.
Perfectly painted lips curved upwards in a gesture that was pure Natasha Romanoff.
For his part, Tony felt ten feet tall. Making Steve laugh was no small feat and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d heard him laugh so hard before. It was a great fiftieth-birthday gift to himself. Approaching the couch where Steve sat pink and warm from all the laughter, Tony reached out to stroke the smooth skin of Steve’s face and neck. When Steve asked what Tony wanted for his birthday, Tony had been quick to answer. He wanted to see his husband’s baby face again and so that morning Steve had shaven it all off.
“Let’s date”
“I don’t ever want to be somewhere you can’t follow me Steve.”
“What are you planning to do about Steve?” Stephen asks after Tony’s done telling him all about the afternoon’s grand event.
Having an audience she cares about kick-starts Siggy’s dignity enough to drag her up from her Daddy’s lap and onto a standing position. But she stays close, choosing to stand with an arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders instead.
Despite Steve’s optimism, the first time Tony saw Cap pressing a chaste kiss to Eliza’s lips at an Avengers party just two weeks later, he cringed.
“What the hell where you doing in Haiti, by the way?” There’s no anger behind Tony’s question. Just honest curiosity.
“What is that love?”
“Any hard feelings against the Regime?”
“First of all, it wasn’t a hundred years ago.” ‘At least for you’ he added mentally. “Second, how do you know about vita rays?”
The look of utter horror that filled Steve’s face would have been hilarious under a different circumstance.
“What?”
Tony smiled warmly and risked patting Bucky’s upper arm in a friendly manner. There were days when Tony wondered what being friends with Cap and Bucky would have been like. Would they have gotten along well? Would they have been at each other’s throats all the time? He’d never dared get too close out of respect for his husband, but sometimes he wondered.
“Ok, let’s cool it a little there.” He says openly and squeezes his daughter’s hand in warning.
“Haiti” Tony repeats and shares a look of with Bruce that without a word, recounts the months Jane spent trying to get a hold of Thor after finding out she was pregnant. Loki comes back with a clean chair then, settles it close to his brother and takes a seat with obvious relief.
“What is your name?”
“You know what?”
“You’re actually serious aren’t you?”
“I want you for you. I miss the sound of your voice Tony. I’m keeping you like this because I know you’d bolt the moment you had the chance not because I like it.”
“Everything’s well Sir. I go with Saviour Natasha and the Captain to the city shelters in the mornings to help in any way I can. The people are in high spirits Sir.”
“Why don’t you go get some sleep while I sort out my husband?”
One of Steve’s knees hit the floor as he came to kneel in front of Tony.
All successful invasions required a special mixture of both impressive shows of power to subdue the population and acts of unbridled kindness to earn their compliance. If he’d been able to do it with full territories before, he could certainly do it with Tony Stark, Steve reasoned. In this case, a full scale invasion was crucial in order to guarantee longevity in their relationship. Last thing Steve wanted was to become a fling, or a ‘first love’… oh no, he wanted a lifetime and a lifetime he would get.
Steve was cold.
Tony’s salvation from spiraling into a life of addictions had been Steve. He’d been fifteen and so close to falling, so perilously close to giving into the darkness his father had condemned him to that he lost all interest in his own survival. He’d experimented so much with drugs that it’d been a miracle he didn’t overdose. It was simply a fact that Tony’s life would have been very different without Steve and his enormous group of friends to keep him afloat. They’d raised him, sheltered him, nursed him until he was strong enough to stand on his own. So yeah… falling in love with Steve Rogers had not been a mistake… just like Siggy being born hadn’t been a mistake either.
It’s the tone that gets him, the raw emotion behind it that gets Tony to look straight into Steve’s beautiful blue eyes.
He remembered not thinking much about it then. Sure he grieved, went to the funeral, cried along with the others, apologized to Tony’s grave, gave a grand speech about how wonderful Tony Stark had been. He’d cried but he hadn’t mourned.
“It’s a tumour, but we don’t believe it’s cancerous.”
“This hardly counts as a miracle, baby.”
“You are the end of the road my love, did you know that? For me, you’ve always been the end of my road.”
There were curious glances from what had to be drug dealers and their clients but he looked imposing enough that no one said anything. The dealer by the far side wore a large baggy coat that screamed 80’s fashion and Steve sighed in relief. He walked quickly, with purpose and with an attitude that made more than one hoodlum retreat. He walked until he spotted a lone yellow cab, he hailed it by almost stopping right in front of it and while the driver yelled at him for it, Steve shook an old hundred dollar bill in the cabbie’s face.
“You’re making the right decision Howard.”
“It’s just, Cap looks a lot like your Commander here, isn’t that a little weird?”
He doesn’t even need to think about it.
“Merry Christmas!”
Abnormally, it also turns out to be a busier than normal summer for Vivi and Stephen. Somehow they find themselves with the most gruelling surgery schedule in two years and by August; the toll is starting to show. It takes Tony one look at his exhausted best friend to decide that she, Harley and Arlen are moving in with them until things settle down at the hospital. Vivi reluctantly agrees and that’s only because she’s too exhausted to properly argue.
“You’ll have to bring the baby over for a visit sometime.”
No. Just one word and immediately he was overcome with vivid images of Tony Stark. Tony standing in the tower’s common room pointing at the sink and saying “No” with that short O and low tone. He’d learned it from Pepper, it had stuck because of Pepper… because it’d been her favorite word to use around Tony.
He was the last High Commander, the last Supreme Leader, the last of his kind.
Steve hoped they both drowned in a lake. Tony said he was being an idiot.
“Boy” Bruce and Natasha answer in unison.
“You won’t tell anyone?”
But Tony can already tell the warning falls on deaf ears. It’s in the way Steve is already pinning him in place with his hands, in the graze of his chest against Tony’s back. It’s in the urgency of his mouth and the predatory heat he’s giving off.
With that new thought, philosophical dissections on the concept of obsessions went out the window. Now Tony wondered how different his relationship was from other people’s.
Steve Stark’s reply was completely nonchalant with edges of boredom all around.
“Stay here” Tony commands them and rushes to the living room with panic steadily rising.
“Did you and Steve have a fight?” She sounded so utterly surprised by the concept that Tony almost felt like saying ‘nevermind’ but as they still had at least half an hour left in the car he decided to go for it.
“You won’t be old, you’ll just be forty-nine.” He leaned in to kiss Tony on the cheek, nuzzled the spot he kissed with his nose.
“You two look like twins” Clint teased, his index finger pointing between Steve and the newly arrived Captain America. Clint was technically right, they were after all DNA copies of each other, but neither bothered to hide their displeasure at the comparison.
“How else are you going to ‘do it with me’ Steve? You’ve said it before, you’re not Captain America anymore so now you can be someone else. Think about it.”
Tony was aging.
‘There. Totally reasonable’ thought Tony. “I’m sorry to hear about your parents.”
“Sure I have. I’ve worked out all the kinks I could find, everything checks out”
But inside… Steve is screaming.
“Okay”
Instinctively Steve’s eyes scanned over the apartment windows, eyes searching for any clues of a sniper.
It is the most heartfelt thank you that Tony has ever heard and it brings back the tears so quickly that he can barely see Thor.
He was pleased with her answer, glad she was being cautious.
His glassy, red tinted eyes look over the expensive suit and tie. “So I can see. What brings you here?”
Dr. Banner gives them theories and options and treatments. Tony listens carefully, nods and asks questions. He discusses medications, monitoring schedules and even diets. And while Tony looks calmer the longer they’re there…
The smile she offers is pure professionalism but the bite in her eyes is all spite. Sharon is Peggy’s secretary, but despite this she often ends up helping him more than she likes.
A month ago, just a month ago Tony had laid down on this exact same couch and violently sobbed onto the shoulder of his best friend Jane. The same best friend whose corpse the police had just dropped off to be cremated not three hours ago… the mother of this perfect newborn in his clumsy arms. In just five weeks he had both lost his best friend AND the love of his life. And now? What now?
Steve pressed his tear-salt lips to Tony’s mouth and sliding an arm around his waist, kissed him hard and deep until he too could feel the last of that sob slipping into his own mouth. That was the day Steve Rogers learned his Tony’s biggest fear, disappointing Steve. A few hours later, Steve draped an exhausted Tony comfortably over his muscled body and marveled at the wonder of it all. Once again Steve had the power to leave Tony Stark alone and bleeding in the cold, except this time Steve would do nothing of the sort. Smiling to himself, Steve moved the sleeping body above him so Tony’s head was tucked comfortably under Steve’s neck and his ass, still leaking semen, did so over Steve’s abdomen. Then he ran gentle soothing patterns over Tony’s back and synched their breathing until Steve too fell under its lure.
“Do I have your blessing Sir?”
Unlike in the other dimension, Tony Stark was never programmed to leave the base so the Ten Rings attacked the military base just to get to Tony. For eight weeks Steve and Rhodey scoured the desert, focusing heavily in the area the original enemy base had been in Steve’s dimension. Steve called in SHIELD, Rhodey led the military operation and together they were able to locate the base in question. Over fifty bodies charged in but both Steve and Rhodey searched the inside with one goal in mind. They found the correct door just in time to find Tony being locked into a raw iron suit by a tall thin man. There was an all-too familiar glow in the chest of the armor and Steve felt his heart sink at the sight.
No matter how much time passed, Tony’s favorite fantasy remained the one in which Steve Rogers kneeled in front of him and begged Tony to forgive him, begged Tony to take him back. The fantasy always ended with Tony kicking Steve right out of whatever room he imagined himself to be in. He’d always meant that fantasy, had in fact seen it as a sort of dress rehearsal just in case. But never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined just how much Steve could have destroyed himself. The man Tony had gotten to know in however long he’d been in this cabin for, was but a shadow of the man he’d once known. A tortured, warped shadow but it was still Steve.
“What about the power source?”
Steve’s cottage in Northern Maine was above all, remote. Along with the cottage he also owned fifteen acres around it to guarantee privacy. He’d bought it, in cash, direct from the owner using his gains from a weekend trip to Vegas. He’d brought six months worth of pay to a high rollers table and left with enough to buy his cottage and furnish it like a king. He’d worked on getting the cottage ready for a full year, everything from fixing the heat and roof to adding an extra room to digging a pantry cellar. He’d done everything on his own, years of working construction jobs for cash finally coming in handy. The cottage was fully stocked with eight months worth of food and enough medicine to cure a plague and kill a moose.
And that was just the tip of the issues iceberg. The other reason was that Steve simply did not like to share. They were a team of two and regardless of the world around them, Steve always had Tony’s undivided attention. A child would mean Tony’s attention would no longer be sorely on Steve and the genius didn’t think that would go over well. So Tony surrendered that dream without a fight and instead turned his energy on little Alaska Rhodes with her bright blue eyes and gummy smile.
“Uncle Tony, Mamma’s here!”
Steve did not dream… he remembered.
“I knew what I was looking for and I knew I could take care of this on my own”
“Naw, it’s fine. I slept 10 hours straight before we hit the road and we took a break just an hour ago… before he took the Nighquill.”  Steve laughed in a fond sort of way. As if he was letting the officer in on some sort of inside joke. For his part the officer, a man in his mid-thirties simply nodded his head.
He knocked, and knocked and knocked until a livid looking Howard Stark wearing in a red satin robe opened the door… and froze.
“It’d be different Tony, I’d be different. I’m not confused anymore Tony… please…”
He’s always had good luck with older secretaries. They’re usually accommodating, hardworking and are over the age where special accommodation for children is required. He also likes giving Tony the peace of mind.
Tony had the decency to look guilty.
The first time Siggy Foster knowingly and purposely does something bad is when she’s ten years old. Yes, she has been called to the office of the school Principal and Vice Principal before, and yes, she has had a few mishaps in science class, but there had never been anything purposely sneaky about it. Her first real, deliberate misdemeanour comes in the form of catfishing. It’s a team effort.
“May I be of help Commander?”
“Can’t we do something for him Steve?” Peggy’s voice was heavy with emotion, as if seeing this blast from the past with her own eyes was carving away all her years of experience.
Harley does not look convinced with his mother’s plan, but she’s holding out her hand in a way that means business so he reluctantly stands up. He shares a look with Siggy, she smiles at him, confident and with a look that says ‘I got this’. The same look she gets whenever they get in trouble at school. He smiles back, but it’s a worried grimace more than anything. Arlen however is harder to convince. The girl ignores her mother’s hand, opting for burrowing deeper into her Uncle Tony’s arms in protest.
That day Obadiah left the house pale and shaking with anger while upstairs, Tony Stark finally breathed.
“Where’re you doing?”
“So many things, Sir!”
“The pleasure’s all mine. So you’re Siggy’s Uncle?”
Then came the night Tony and Steve spent three hours doing nothing except lying in bed staring at each other and Steve knew, he just knew his invasion had been successful. Tony clung to him like nothing ever had, clung to his words, to his touch, to his very sight and oh how Steve relished it.
Ironically, Tony realized, it had always been him calling the shots. Even at his most vulnerable, at his youngest, at his moodiest, Tony had always been calling the shots.
Smiling, Thor steps down onto the garden where he stops to once again hug Tony. “Ok big guy, they’re waiting for you.”
“I’m sorry, I just wanted you to know that.”
Realizing what he’d done, Steve pressed soft kisses on Tony’s forehead, nuzzling the hairline with his nose.
“Nothing”
“Why don’t you let me take care of that, sugar.”
“I think so too.”
He stared at her for too long, he knew, made her think he was interested in her sexually. It actually made Tony jealous.
“Decades?”
“Of course my love. Everything’s perfect.”
Tony was a genius after all, and he knew better than to ask questions that would get him answers he’d rather not know.
“Please, Stark tower is your baby, give yourself 12% of the credit”
“But why sculpting?”
Even now Tony enjoyed a good drink. He liked the expensive stuff, the good whiskey, the fancy wines but he only ever drank at home with Steve. They’d settle on the couch, a glass of the good stuff in their hands and just talk. Eventually the drink would get Tony tipsy which made him very affectionate, he’d drape himself over Steve, kiss his neck, his shoulders, his lips until finally Tony got horny enough that they had to move to the bedroom.
“Arlen Keener, come over here please.” But the girl does not move a muscle.
His feet were moving without his consent. He felt nervous, almost nauseous with each step but he didn’t stop until he was fully in the living room, utterly visible. He watched with his very own eyes as his husband’s face transformed from a cold, cruel grimace into the very face of a loving god.
The kids are buzzing with excitement as they get out of the car. Whispering to each other all the way into the polished elevator.
The words were pressed against Steve’s chin and Tony once again marveled at how easily Steve flipped him so they faced each other.  Keeping the weight off his knees, Steve bent his legs high enough to support the bulk of Tony’s weight while also pushing his own erection in between Tony’s thighs. The feeling of his skin against Tony’s silk-thin skin was soon enough to throw him into an orgasmic frenzy. While it had never taken much for Tony to send Steve into an orgasm, it seemed easier to accomplish it now than ever. They made out for a long time after that. Kissed and caressed until Tony’s lower back cramped and Steve carried him to the bed to properly dry him off.
When the first batch of Curriculums vitae came though, Steve dutifully looked through the pile in Tony’s office. He flipped through the pages one by one.
The truth of it was that Steve had given up on being happy. He’d known from the moment he walked away from the love of his life at seventeen that he would never again feel an ounce of happiness. It’d proven true along these long twenty years of his shitty life. With death on his mind Steve sped down the dark town streets, he ran two red lights, hoping against all odds he’d get rammed by a truck. Unfortunately the town was low on trucks or even cars this late in the night, so he made due with a road that was too dark to see and which turned out to be an old, rusting bridge.
But the look of them both, the image Tony and Sigrid make is so striking, that the train of thought is derailed into concerned silence. A minute later, Thor appears. He takes one look at Siggy hiding in Tony’s arms and looks about ready to break down crying.
“I like… coffee.”
Being Tony Stark’s assistant was not an easy job even if he did have an easier time of it than anyone else would. It was time consuming and if Steve had to help out at SHIELD Tony was left assistant-less. Steve calmly presented his argument, listing all the reasons Tony needed someone full time. Steve would still be there at all times to help, but someone needed to take some of the load from SI off of Tony’s shoulders.
His phone rings. It’s five thirty, Tony must be wondering where he is, but Steve doesn’t want to pick up the phone in this place. Instead he takes it out, watches it ring… waits until it’s done. Then he starts texting.
The bittersweet diagnosis brought his Tony back to him. As if the monster having a name has somehow powered Tony up for a fight. He laughs like he used to, teases Steve like he used to, fucks him like he used to. No longer are they holding each other as if tomorrow brings nothing but darkness. Instead, Tony is back to blowing raspberries on Steve’s stomach just because it makes him laugh.
“Homemade?”
“Good, that’s what I wanted.”
Tony listens as the door opens, voices are heard and the tell-tell sign of plastic crinkling starts getting closer. A moment later, two kids and one adult enter the kitchen beside the living room carrying bags of take-out, bags which soon cover the kitchen island and make it hard so see the man who brought them in.
“I will, right after I get you back into the bedroom”
The more Steve talked the bigger Tony’s smile became, the more his eyes twinkled and his hands fidgeted at the possibilities. He was excited with this new prospect as if the thought of a change of scenery alone was injecting new life into a body that hadn’t ceased worrying in eleven months. Smiling, Tony closed in on Steve, soft arms wrapping around the larger man’s warm muscled torso.
Maybe Cap was right, maybe Steve really did hate himself, but Tony would never hold that against him.
She shot to her feet, her upheld palm shooting to her temple in a salute that was the bastard offspring of both Military and Hydra salutes.
“High Commander, it is my honour.” She answered and there was no doubt in Steve’s mind that she meant it. Her eyes were glossy but her resolved remained unmoved. This was someone who’d dedicated her life to serving the People's United Country of the Americas, someone who’d sworn loyalty to the High Commander.
“They popped him full of serum, brainwashed him and turned him into a deadly killing machine.”
Deeper inside, hogging the comfortable couches were the rest of the founding members. Natasha (who had just come fresh off a hip replacement months ago) sat on her wheelchair beside her husband Bruce Banner. She got up every once in a while to get some movement into that hip but she seemed to be having a good time. Beside them also sat Clint, looking mobile and spry next to his wife Laura. Rhodey and Pepper sat on another couch, big smiles on their faces and they showed off something on Pepper’s phone (probably grandbaby pictures) to the others. Sam, as always, was the only one standing. He’d recently undergone a spinal surgery and appeared to be doing better than the Commander had seen in a long time.
“The Commander authorized me to leave the tower a couple of weeks ago. He is confident in my training and abilities.”
“Nice to meet y’all.” She gives them a pageant smile but it’s Loki who stands to offer his hand for her to shake.
It was a loaded question, Vision knew. Say too little and the High Commander would freeze him out, say too much and he’d get jealous.
They watched her go into the elevator with identical fond smiles.
“When will it be ready?”
“Me in your bed?”
Vivi Keener is standing before him, wearing a blue sleeveless sun dress and a smile that would make the sun jealous. She walks closer, and like an opposing force magnet Tony can’t help but meet her in the middle. Vivi’s hugs are the stuff of children books, they are like the warmest blanket in the coldest winter’s night. She draws him in and whispers ‘Happy Birthday baby” with that sweet Louisiana drawl of hers (slightly faded after decades of living north) that makes him believe that everything, regardless of how bad it is, will always be ok.
“No we do not. We only know the activity will begin in approximately six months’ time for you.”
“Come visit.” The invitation is whispered into the side of Bruce’s head and he feels him nod.
She hates him. Of this he’s sure, but he enjoys her tightly controlled anger. Peggy is due back in two days, after which he’ll be able to relax a bit more. She’s always been better at dealing with the everyday staff annoyances than him, so he usually leaves it up to her. She’s been away working on closing a deal in Norway, it’s going to be their biggest one yet and he can’t wait to get his hands on the paperwork. While Peggy may be the charm of this operation, Steve is the shark.
“Do we know anything about her parents?”
It had occurred to Steve during the past year that his ticket to Tony was actually Edwin Jarvis. If Jarvis trusted him, Tony would trust him too and so with this in mind he spent the next couple of weeks bonding with the butler over WWII stories which eventually evolved into stories about Tony’s childhood.
“Hey, sweetheart you listen to me. No one’s coming after me and Johann would never try to get me back in. Besides, you know I have connections.”
“Tony, please!”
Steve’s rosy lips broke into a smile, his blue eyes lifted from the page to look at Tony’s drowsy ones.
It’s been a long night already, an exciting one certainly but now that the adrenaline is subsiding, Steve feels mostly just exhausted.
“Well this just got a lot less fun.” Mutters Loki, his obvious disappointment earning him a nod of agreement from his niece.
“Good morning Steve. I received the account reports you requested yesterday, they’re in your inbox.”
“Tony…”
“You have been staring at screens all day love. Why don’t we take a walk along the beach?”
“It’s just a little thing but we always pass by it on our walks and it ALWAYS catches your attention so I thought, why not?”
“High Commander your car is ready.”
The reply is closer, signaling the early morning routine to be nearly over.
Steve keeps a lazy ear on their conversation. He’d never worried about being found out, after all, how many years have him and Bucky spent fake-planning the perfect murder? They’ve been doing that for fun since before Bucky went into the Police Academy. Then as he ascended through the ranks, the old conversation turned more and more informative as Bucky learned more and honed his investigative craft. For Bucky it’d always been a fun training exercise with his lifelong friend but for Steve, it’d proven to be a great guide.
“Who’re you thinking about?”
It was all very emotional, Natasha told them when she reported back. There were hugs and tears and apologies galore. Tony was happy to hear it, Steve couldn’t help the snort that forced its way out of the bowels of his guts.
Relief washed through Tony. He took in air as if whatever fears had temporarily overcome him had been exorcised.
Vivi makes a show of clinking her glass to Tony’s in recognition of his point.
That’s why he was here, he told them. Some things had to stay the same but for the rest he was there to lend a hand.
“Vision, from now on I want this portal to be your priority. I want daily reports on it.”
“Whatever you want.”
“Steve you went off orders” Peggy started, a certain look of mad disbelief in her eyes.
Steve whispered, his voice low and sweet. Tony’s reply came in the form of a leg rolled more firmly on top of Steve’s meaty thigh.
“It’s my humble honor.”
“Daddy? There’s a bunch of people at the front door.”
Tony spread out his arms like a showman introducing an opening act.
“What can I do Tony?...What can I possible do to make you want to be with me?”
When Christmas Eve arrives, Steve fears Tony might just combust with excitement. They’ve invited a small group, just five friends but the food has been expertly catered and their home, professionally decorated because Tony refuses to go near the tree ornaments in fear that he’ll break one. All the preparation has created a frenzy of excitement that reminds Steve of a Christmas movie.
“Hmm… just be careful Alaska, if this works I won’t be around to keep you safe anymore.”
“Exactly!”
“Aunt Vivi told me before she went upstairs with Harley and Arlen.”
But instead of smiling like Steve expects, Tony doesn’t concede.
Steve’s never been teased by a co-worker, least of all an employee. His professional relationships are strictly professional, but that’s not how it is for Tony. Tony’s friends are also his coworkers and it makes for an interesting dynamic which seems incredibly complicated to Steve.
“You’re fucking crazy”
“I couldn’t be someplace that didn’t have you in it Tony, I already lived without for too long. So you see, you’re not keeping me back and I’m not babysitting you. You’re it for me, you’re my reason for breathing.”
Tony began nuzzling into the softness of Steve’s T-shirt, his voice heavy with curiosity which he knew fully well Steve would accommodate.
Her radiant smile and shy demeanour twisted his heart in the usual way, but he soon realized what she wanted to do by the way her slim hands clenched and unclenched.
“Lumberjack or Mutton chops?”
They talked all night.
It was like that tale of the queen and Rumpelstiltskin, for as soon as the truth was spit out Steve’s eyes changed as if in a spell. He took hold of Tony’s upper arms with strength that bordered on violence but the passion in his blown pupils told a different story. So Tony allowed Steve to manhandle him onto his lap, allowed the bruising touch to his jaw that was trying to keep Tony’s eyes locked in his.
Though still pretty drunk, Tony sobered up quickly at seeing Steve’s expression.
‘Steve’s room, he’s taking me to his room’
Silence weighed heavily upon the room but it was a silence of fear, of respect. No one could believe one man managed to do what they’d spent years trying to. No one could believe SHIELD now held these five black cases which contained entirely too much information for any of their liking. It was impossible, inconceivable yet here they all were and it was true. Captain Steve Rogers had managed to do in hours, what none of them had been able to do in decades.
“Right… ”
“I’m only thirty-five!”
“Yes. So don’t think you can come here and use my husband to threaten me. You might be Captain America but I’ve been you longer than you’ve been alive so let’s just stay out of each other’s way, boy.”
“Take one of the chairs in the dining room, I’m pretty sure those are clean.”
Captain America briefed them quickly, Tony was right about the spacial disturbance, it’d made SHIELD antsy and so they were here to check up on it. ‘Looks like I finally rubbed off on Nick’ thought Steve as they stood around waiting for something to happen.
It hit him more when he realized just how much Tony had shielded him against the politicians of the world who wanted the Avengers hung from a tree because of ‘unnecessary loss of life and destruction of public property’ every time they were deployed.
High Commander Rogers never took a day’s vacation in his life. No trips to the Bahamas or tourist visits to Europe or Disneyland. Work had always consumed his life and later when he could have been able to take a rest, there was no one to rest with. Now, lying on the warm sand in the sunshine, Steve marveled at how calm he felt. He woke up every morning, dragged Tony out with him for a daily run on the beach (It was their shared agreement that Tony was allowed to go back home after half an hour) and could sometimes spend the whole day either lying under the sun or swimming in the pool.
Steve is no fool, he knows his new little hobby has to come to an end. Tonight he completed what he set out to do, so maybe it is time for a change…
He remembers her eyes and her hair and the feeling of baby Sigrid sleeping in his arms. He remembers the heartbreak and the loneliness until Tony too is sobbing in Thor’s big warm chest. They hold each other until they’re staying upright through sheer shared effort and stay there till they finally feel some semblance of control.
Steve marched off angry but unsurprised. Over the last few years he’d gotten to know Nick Fury well, had even supported Peggy’s decision to leave him in charge after she retired. Still, he couldn’t understand why he’d sent Natasha here when all the immediate threats to Tony’s life had long been removed. What was Dr. Hansen working on now? Steve suddenly wondered… then remembered she was off on maternity leave. She’d gotten married last year, seemed like a completely different person from the woman he’d met years ago.
“I use them to touch you all the time, and chopping food too. Hell, I even use them for showering.”
“I was your Steve once, but then the earth got invaded and everything went to hell Peggy. I’m not that man anymore but for what it’s worth, your Steve is still alive in the arctic and he will be back.”
That was new information.
He’d always wanted to know what Tony would have looked like at sixty-six. Had spent hours in between lulled battles wondering if Tony’s laugh lines would have felt like wrinkled paper or silk (silk, the answer was silk).
As Tony’s fingers tangled in Steve’s blonde hair, wrenching a blocked moan off Steve, he thought about little Steve Rogers up in his little room in the Avengers compound and how he would never, ever know the smell of Tony’s skin, the taste of his sweat, the sound of his moans. The satisfaction of that thought alone had him spilling into his pants with a choked gasp.
“No one’s ever loved me as much as you.” Tony tells him sometimes. He always says it with such wonder in his voice, as if he can’t understand it.
“You and your bots”
When he finally stopped in front of Alaska’s office, he found the girl furiously typing away on her glass keyboard, a familiar look of concentration on her face. Sometimes she looked so much like her grandmother he couldn’t help but feel warmth in his withered heart. He waited, patiently until she spotted him front the corner of her vision. She looked at him quickly then, her face transforming from icy concentration to a toothy smile.
“Thank you darling”
The pain in Steve’s voice made Tony feel bad somehow, he tried not to but he couldn’t help it. Tony was aware he should be looking for chances to escape, for phones, computers, anything at all that could send a signal and yet…
Pure oxygen was being pumped into his lungs, morphine coursing through every vein but still he smiled at Steve.
He could see Steve’s smile even in the dark because of his teeth, his perfect white teeth that seemed to shimmer in the dark. He wanted to punch those perfect teeth.
Natasha didn’t bother hiding her laughter.
“See, I really doubt that because the thing is, I don’t think you even know yourself.”
“Tony what are you talking about?”
“I just came back from Brussels, on Avengers business. Next week I travel to…”
“How do I know you won’t tell Pepper to come rescue you?”
“What Steve? What could I possibly be hiding for that long?”
“We are in a one-sided relationship baby, and that’s gotta change. You walk on EGGSHELLS around me to avoid us getting into an argument and what do I do in return for you Steve? Ziltch. In fact, I don’t think I really know you at all!”
Tony’s entire demeanour changed the moment Howard Stark entered the bustling kitchen. Tony’s confident babble went silent and he became an observer as Howard asked Steve how the day had gone and if he’d gotten along well with Tony. Content with Steve’s answer, Howard then went on to question Tony on a variety of projects and deadlines that had to be met, quickly obliterating the boy’s very spirit in mere seconds.
“Are you hungry baby?”
Loki winces, his thoughts going back to the contact clauses in the paperwork. That contract was a nasty piece of work and it’s only legal because of the absolute power of attorney that Thor gave to their father before running off to Haiti.
“Because it’s YOU Tony.”
“Money, how much money are you asking for Steve?”
It took seconds for Tony’s gaze to soften, for his brow to unfurrow but eventually it did. “You should know by now that you’re the only person I’m attracted to.” Steve whispered, close enough to Tony’s left ear for the words to sound raspy.
“I will always be wherever you need me to be… even if I’m not physically with you.”
"Yeah." Steve says.
Tony pulls the blankets off his face, but he doesn't sit up. "Did Clint make them?"
The abrupt change of subject leaves him with a bad case of mental whiplash, and it takes half a second for his brain to recover from the stumble and switch gears. He looks over and sees her nodding towards the Real Estate Agent’s card that he’d left sitting on the counter.
Once he's suited up, Tony feels significantly better, though he's not sure if getting slime off the suit is going to be better or worse than trying to get it out of his hair. Over the comms, Clint is whooping and hollering in glee. Guy probably thinks he's died and gone to heaven.
"We're okay. You were the worst. There are some injuries, but yours was… the worst."
"What if the kidnapper brings him to the meet?" Rhodey asks, leaning back in his chair.
Tony blinks at Hunka-Stevie. What?
Tony shuts down all those thoughts because it's just not going to happen. It doesn't matter that Steve seems naturally great with Casey. It doesn't matter that Casey naturally adores him, and Tony can already tell that once they leave, Casey is going to be pestering him about coming back and visiting Steve. It doesn't
Oh, god,
to," Tony groans. "God, do you know how long it's been since I've had sex?"
Casey's eyes widen and he looks up at Steve. "Can I have that one please?"
Years of indiscriminate casual sex with both men and women had ended the moment he'd met Rumiko. Rumiko had been the daughter of a business magnate in Japan, and she had, inexplicably, fallen as madly in love with Tony as he had with her. He quit drinking, quit doing drugs, quit partying. In short, he got his shit together.
," Tony says, grinning down at him.
Steve's eyelashes are fluttering and his chest is heaving, but he's still holding Tony's gaze, and Tony can see his own emotions mirrored back to him.
in bed with Tony. They're in the hotel, and Steve – oh God, Steve had just tried to kiss Tony. Tony, who'd told him all about his wife. Tony, who wants nothing to do romantically with some coffee shop-owning war vet with lingering trauma issues.
"You'll what?"
Tony hadn't been excited about it, at first. In fact, all he could think about was what a terrible father Howard Stark had been, and how he was destined to follow in his father's footsteps and mess up his child for life.
And, frankly, maybe a little bit of self care – he snickers to himself – would help with all the unresolved, one-sided sexual frustration he feels whenever he's around Steve.
Steve flushes a little, but looks pleased as he takes another bite of sandwich. "You know, wasn't always like this," he said casually. "I was really late getting my growth spurt. Most of high school I was about five-five and scrawnier than you'd believe."
The warmth of the lobby is quite possibly the most incredible thing Steve has ever experienced in his life, and he openly sighs in relief. The late-middle-aged man with a greying beard who'd exclaimed their arrival hurried out from behind the front desk and over to them. "You okay there, son? Here, grab a chair." Steve sinks gratefully into the plush chair, and tries very hard not to move his knee.
The footsteps stop and Steve looks up to find a man who, at first glance, looks so much like Howard, Steve does a double take. But on the second look, he realises that no, while this man is clearly Howard’s son from the way he looks, the way he stands – cocky, confident, like he owns the room – he’s very clearly his own unique entity. There is something about his presence that draws Steve in immediately. Steve isn’t quite sure how to feel about it, can’t really tell if it’s a good thing or not as he rises to his feet and meets the man’s intense gaze.
"Steve Rogers," says Steve, uncrossing his arms to clasp Tony's hand. He has a good, solid grip, but Tony purposefully keeps control of the handshake. "Of Brewed Awakening."
"Ah!" Steve cries, and it's not a sexy noise, not really, so Tony rears back, hands up defensively, not sure what he's done wrong but knowing it's
wrong, he's not – he doesn't like me like that."
"Yeah, he's a little banged up. Wrenched his knee pretty good but I think it's just a sprain. He should be okay but he'll have to get it checked out when we get back to the city."
Bucky watches him eat in silence for a moment – and possibly with a bit of horror – before he turns away and rolls his eyes, taking a mouthful of his own stew.
"You should probably hold your breath so you can suffocate and put me out of my misery," Tony says, rolling his eyes. They're almost at Brewed Awakening and Tony needs to change the subject, fast. If for no other reason than he doesn't want to be blushing when they walk in the door.
“Well, for one, you’re not going to
"How will you make us belong there, then?" asked Sam. "How will we know Vision is the one we need to protect?"
Steve pulls back just a little, eyes searching Tony's at close range. They're so blue Tony could drown in them.
After the third sip, Tony manages to tear his gaze away from the cup and turns his attention back to Steve. "So," he says carefully, "all the other parents I've talked to won't shut up about how great this place is, how nice you all are, how much they love having a good, wholesome cafe next to the school."
Steve had honestly expected the first few days of the new shop opening to be a bit on the slow side. It takes time to build a presence, or so he assumed.
Whatever the opposite of thrilled is, that's how Bucky appears right now. He's radiating electric hostility. Admittedly, it's well covered – Steve doubts a random stranger would pick up on anything more than a subdued mood, but Steve knows him better than that. It's a little concerning, almost. Natasha seems nice, and he's got no doubt that Tony vetted her with a
"So this is me, not saying thank you," Tony continues, interrupting him. "I want you to know that. This isn't some, I don't know, misplaced sense of gratitude. This is something I should have said to you a week ago, when we were stuck in that stupid motel near Syracuse."
been nearby, but since when has Tony let a little thing like distance get in his way in a fight.
"You've got so much here," Steve tried. He stepped closer, brought his volume down so the two of them weren't so easy to overhear. Not, Tony mused, that the other Avengers wouldn't be listening in with everything they had.
He's saved a second later by his cell phone ringing. A quick glance at the screen shows that it's Rhodey, and Tony pounces at the phone, eager for the distraction.
being a dick, but he can’t bring himself to care. He’s just so tired, and sick of everyone making decisions about his life, tip toeing around him like he’s going to break, or like they’re scared to offend his delicate sensibilities. If SHIELD takes, him, or Stark Industries takes him, what does it matter? Either way, he doesn’t really get a choice, does he?
"I will. This afternoon, when we get home, yeah? You can watch me." This seems good enough for the boy and he happily drags Tony down the block to the preschool next door. All the while, Tony glances back over his shoulder at the home of the soon-to-be-swarming-with-people coffee shop that is daring to set itself up in his quiet residential neighbourhood, right next to his son's goddamned preschool.
"Why are we back?" Clint croaks from across the room, looking dazed. He glances at Tony, but then his eyes track across the room to Bucky, who's staring right back at him.
Tony stares at him for a long moment.
Tony spends half the day hacking into the city zoning office servers to get ahold of blueprints, permits, anything he can get his hands on to try and find some cut construction corners or regulations that would keep Brewed Awakening from opening their new location. There's nothing – everything is on the up and up, so far. All the permits have been filed correctly, the location is correctly zoned for food and drink establishment, the bastards had even sent out that memo to all their neighbours on the block.
"And I have it on good authority from Rhodey that Tony hasn't been on a date since Casey was born," Natasha adds.
They really do have work to do.
Stark ignores him. “Look, point is, you’re strong and fast, but damn, it’s a good thing you
Except that bottom row – right at children's eye level. A row of oversized, soft-looking cookies.
Steve knows he’s looking for a laugh, or even to make Steve blush, but Steve’s not going to make it that easy for him.
." Tony's eyes pop wide, and he puts his hands up immediately in a placating gesture, shaking his head forcefully. "No! No, no, no way, that's not – fuck, no, sorry, that's
"She's been in the shop," Clint says. "I've seen her in the Manhattan shop. Laptop lady."
Tony knows he's trapped. Either he gives in and allows Rhodey to think that he can convince him to act on the crush he keeps denying, or he fights back by insisting they
He thinks Yinsen would be okay with him dying this way, too, and he hopes that Yinsen would be proud of what he's done with his life. He didn't waste it. He's fucked a lot of things up, but maybe this will finally balance the scales.
Steve glances at him. "We're not in the Haven anymore."
He realizes he's a little wired from the coffee, so he cues his tablet up to the NannyCam app he'd created, and watches the feed from Casey's room for a few minutes, as Casey sleeps. He's still, but Tony can see the rise and fall of his little pyjama-clad chest. He knows he's got a soft smile on his face, and he knows he's a ridiculously sappy dope, but he doesn't care.
"JARVIS? How much time on the Steve clock?" He asks, pulling the blankets up around his shoulders.
"See, Steve gets it," Tony says haughtily. "My kid is the best kid, and deserves all the people around him to love and protect him as he deserves to be loved and protected."
"Yeah, okay. Fair point," Steve concedes. "But we agreed, not your fault either. Just an accident that happened."
But as soon as his attention hits the project he's been working on, he loses all sense of time. He checks the NannyCam feed from time to time, and Casey is still fast asleep, so Tony keeps working away.
God, and what if they have to buy a new one? They definitely can't afford a new commercial oven, and clearly buying used didn't work out so well the last time.
Instead, it's a woman he doesn't recognize. Well, that's not entirely true — after a moment, he realizes it's the woman who has been here every morning for the past week, plugging away on a laptop a few tables away.
. As in Stark Resilient. As in Forbes' most talked-about 'up and coming' tech company in a generation. Steve is just a broken-down vet with a case of PTSD who's recently mortgaged his stupid little coffee shop to expand it into
"'Cept Rhodey was in the air one. He flew planes and stuff. Is that how Bucky hurt his arm? In the army? Daddy and Rhodey say that sometimes people get hurt in the army. That's why Daddy is trying to make stuff to keep the army guys safe, so they don't get so hurt."
, per se, more of a 'fond exasperation'. At least, that's what Tony's choosing to label it.
"Yes!"
Because Tony had spent the better part of his day looking into the city's zoning office and one ridiculously-named coffee shop, he hadn't done much actual work for Stark Resilient. He ignores it as long as he can; he plays with Casey, makes dinner – he's not a great cook, but the food he makes them is nutritious and edible, and most days Casey doesn't even whine and ask for Mac N' Cheese. He could certainly afford a personal chef to do the meal preparation for them, but he thinks Ru would have wanted him to do the cooking, if she couldn't do it herself. Hiring a chef just seemed too impersonal.
Which is why Tony is definitely not having this conversation.
“I would say I’m wounded, but really, you got it in one. Tony Stark: I do what I want.”
“Yeah, well. I could have guessed. Genius and all.”
"Oh, holy fuck," Bucky groans. "They're like a little family already. The most aggressively oblivious little family in the world."
She'd learned it earlier than that.
"Then I'll go, too," Steve announced, jaw set, eyes glittering with steel. Tony stared at him, his own jaw slack.
"Scatter what?" Tony asked.
Steve nods, and can't quite suppress the 'I told you so' grin. "A few of them have already asked about doing book clubs and social gatherings here on the weekends when there's programming running at the school. And someone asked about catering for school events when things start back up in the fall. Which, by the way, I would be happy to do."
Tony groans again, and under him Steve chuckles.
Stark nods. “Trust me, I am intimately familiar with that, and it sucks. I’m going to take that as blanket permission to be as much of an insensitive asshole as I want to be, by the way.” For a brief flash, he looks almost hopeful, like he’s trying to offer an olive branch and he’s hoping Steve takes it.
As they stumble the last few yards up to the door, Steve glances behind them, and he can hardly even see the tracks they've left in the snow, it's coming down so hard, and blowing around so much. Steve lets Tony lead him inside, and they are immediately greeted by a "What the hell are you boys doing out there? Jesus, get in here and close the door!"
no Avengers. Not anymore.
+++++
He tips his chin up and kisses Tony again, and this time it's less frantic – warm, slow, honey kisses that start to pick up speed after a long time.
"I didn't know
"It's fine, don't be ridiculous. We can share," Tony insists. "Besides, after our impromptu rollercoaster ride, we're both probably going to be sore in the morning. We both need somewhere soft to sleep. It's just one night."
He commits it all to memory so he knows, so that he never forgets.
"No," Tony says a little breathlessly. "Not usually, he'll be fine. Just – keep it down if we can?"
Besides, who's to say he could trust a personal chef to be as diligent about Casey's health and nutrition needs as he is?
Tony tilts his head, puzzled, even as he shakes his head. "Thanks, Steve, no, that's fine."
"Well, hell if I'm gonna let you all go to the Matrix dimension without me," said Sam. "That's not gonna fly."
"You love me."
On the other hand – he can't go out there in just the underwear.
"I checked with the zoning office, that's a residential commercial zone," Rogers says, brow furrowed. "I didn't have any trouble with my permits."
"She's the coolest! She'll fight all the bad guys and protect us! But she says she likes kids, and wanted to help keep a special kid safe. That's why she wanted to be my nanny, and she is the best and most fun nanny ever."
that, thank you very much,) when he catches something out of the corner of his eye, whizzing through the air, past the kitchen and into the common space.
because I fucking told them the timeline was unreasonable, and I have bigger shit to worry about. Because school lets out in a couple of weeks and I've been spending the time I should be spending asleep catching up on new projects and looking for childcare, and I cannot for the life of me find someone qualified to watch Casey. I mean, how hard is it? I'm not asking much. All I want is someone who, you know, is competent and trustworthy, and can actually keep my son safe, but I'd have an easier time getting the moon than getting an actual, decent nanny. So look, I know you're just trying to run a business and do good or whatever the hell else you're trying to do. But you need to do it somewhere else. Because this? Worrying about this? I literally –" he instinctively takes a sip of coffee from the cup that's just magically appeared in his hand, and his eyes widen. "– Holy shit. What. Is. This."
start to worry," Steve tells him, and Tony can hear the laughter in his voice. "I brought you a cup of coffee."
"Good. Go, make things to help stop the self replicating problem. We'll take care of the stuff out here."
Casey kicks again, hard, his spindly knee bending so he can stomp back, and his little heel connects with the bastard's groin.
At that moment, Tony pulls up in the vehicle, and Steve thanks her, shakes her hand, and jumps into the car.
"Oh god, no," Tony whines. "Do not let them near my child when I'm not there to tell him what ridiculous humans they are, and they go off and teach him whatever they want willy nilly."
Bucky is already ducking behind a corner, and Steve gets low and does the same.
Steve blinks furiously, and tries to figure out what the hell just happened as he takes a step back and stares at Tony in admiration. Tony, on the other hand, is staring at him in horror.
If they get through this –
At least his ass is covered now.
Night falls, and he’s sitting up with his sketchbook, a single lamp lighting the apartment. He’s filled pages and pages already today. Sketches of the streets of the Brooklyn he remembers, sketches of the people that he misses, that he saw only a few weeks before, but who died years ago.
"You know, all that unresolved sexual tension and pining. You sorted all that out?"
Tony's heart plummets, and he turns in time to see King Slime Lord lunge forward in something close to a charge, moving far faster than they'd seen it move before. Right towards Steve. Tony's yells incoherently, but there is nothing he can do, and he watches helplessly as Steve brings his shield up to cover his head, and curls himself into a protective ball as the slime giant slides right over him.
He slides to the floor and curls into himself, pressing his face to his knees, trying to make himself as small as he can as his entire body shakes with the sobs that are now ripping through him uncontrollably. He can’t deal with this, with feeling this way all the fucking time. He just can’t. What he wants, what he actually wants is just to wake up and be
Rhodey follows him to the table, sits down, and then crosses his arms over his chest.
"Thanks, Natasha! Call me Tony!"
"Well, it wouldn't make any sense to open a coffee shop in Manhattan if we don't fully intend to get our customers hopelessly addicted to the coffee," Steve grins. "Clint and Bucky will both tell you I'm bad at backing down from a challenge."
It's the only comfort Steve can take in the fact that Tony is still here, in the bed, not waking up.
“I’m not fond of forest lakes… how about a beach home somewhere instead?”
“I know.”
This did not please him.
“I’m sorry.”
“Ha, ha… I’m thinking a Balbo, maybe start with an Anchor, y’know, like the one we saw in that magazine when we met with Dr. Pym last week?”
Years ago Tony would have been able to hold back the tears, but not now. Now Tony allowed them to flow down his cheeks as his hand stroked harder and his salty lips went in search of Steve’s.
“We should be getting back you guys, it’s getting late.”
Tony was quiet and morose the whole ride home, a look of furious concentration in his face which spoke of the pressure that was building up inside. Steve knew his boy well, he could read the thoughts running furiously through his brain, the anger, the pain and the doubt. Steve said nothing in the car but he knew exactly what to say as soon as they were safely inside their apartment with the door locked and their shoes off.
“Morning”
Tony opened his mouth, about to argue, about to demand answers but then he closed it, a strange look spreading across his face.
Alaska’s honey coloured eyes fixed in on his, a deep sadness flooding in.
Last time Steve was unemployed, he was also starving.
Sharon may be good at masking her disdain, but Steve knows people much too well to fall for it. As soon as Sharon is out of his office he plots down a reminder.
He had everything required already, he’d been planning it for months after all.
Adding to the oddity, by mid-August a dessert-like heat wave has pushed the busy children into the air-conditioned-great-indoors. The marble machine, having been mostly completed, now lies abandoned as a casualty of the temperature. Now the children that used to reign the outside, reign Tony’s living room area (his office is in the basement) bringing with them laughter, the odd painful scream and a lot of chatter. They talk over each other as they try their hand at phone app games and bicker about celebrity gossip. It’s due to all this noise that Tony is utterly unaware of his ringing doorbell until Siggy runs downstairs and knocks on his office door.
Tony had always been his salvation, he just hadn’t realized to what extent.
“You do what you have to do and I’ll be right there doing it with you.”
“Yeah honey?”
“I know what I’m doing seems sick and wrong, I know that Tony, but this is the only way I could think of where you’d give me the chance to prove myself worthy of you! I can take care of you and love you and cherish you. I can feed you and spend time with you like I always should’ve done! I’m just trying to buy myself some time until you realize what you’ve been hiding for twenty-three years Tony!”
“NO! You do know me Tony! You know me better than anyone!”
There was such weight in Steve’s words, so much left unsaid, it was driving Tony nuts.
“It’s our twentieth, ‘overboard’ isn’t remotely big enough.”
Steve could in all honesty say he had no idea why an entire room full of high ranking SHIELD officers (including a very young looking Nick Fury) sat staring at him as if Rocket the Racoon had just walked in.
