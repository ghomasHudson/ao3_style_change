Cas, initially quite tense, relaxed quickly into the touch with a barely suppressed look of wonder and wrapped his free arm around him in return, pulling him even closer. "Of course, Dean," he rumbled, the vibration tangible everywhere they touched.
"I think we should listen to the Zeppelin tape you made me a couple years ago," Cas interjected. "I haven't had a working sound system in a car I could listen to it on for over a year. Of course, I know all of the songs, but the experience of listening to it as a whole is... different, than just having the knowledge of it. I used to listen to it quite often," he said, matter-of-fact. "I had begun to wear out the tape but I repaired it with my Grace shortly before Jack defeated Michael."
A much longer silence followed Sam's question, heavy with answers Cas clearly knew but was entirely unwilling to provide. Dean was really starting to consider turning around, skipping dinner and going to bed so he could pretend this never happened. A part of him- a big part- wondered if he'd been leading the angel on.
"I'm- I mean, ugh. I'm not judging," Dean stammered, embarrassed. He set his grilled cheese back on the plate nearly untouched, his appetite gone. "I just. Couldn't. If I was in love. Besides," he added, "they're all straight. It would just be a horrible love triangle. I can't even imagine the jealousy."
Dean was still laughing to himself all the way back to his room. Sam was so easy to rile up, sometimes. Especially when it came to women. Dean flipped on the lights in his room and made an executive decision: sweatpants and robe, stat.
He may have cracked a rib when she hugged him. Tiny old women were deceptively strong like that. He didn't mind.
"Yeah, I guess it is," Dean surrendered. "You better remember the hazelnut creamer- but if Sam asks it's not mine!"
Yes, well, you know you are rather an accomplished cook," Cas agreed, sipping at the soup. "However, you could stand to practice your baking skills a bit more, to say the least."
"Wait, can I see the ring?" he asked excitedly. "Do you have a ring too? Or is Eileen getting you one? Does she know you're telling us this morning?" The questions kept popping into his brain almost faster than he could verbalize them.
"Why are you telling me this now?" Dean asks, knowing that whatever the answer is, he doesn't want to hear it.
Cas stripped with efficiency and redressed in much the same manner, tugging on an old, faded Doors t-shirt. He held up a pair of sweatpants, a question plain on his face but Dean shook his head.
? He was the reason Cas loved anyone because he learned how to love people from Dean, first. That meant everything. He was good with that.
"Oh my god," Kelly-Ann said, blushing. "I'm sorry- I just assumed, because you're buying a house together-"
"I would have thought you'd chucked it ages ago, or lost it, at least," Dean said, shaking his head. "Considering... we weren't exactly on great terms for a while, there."
"Ugh, fine!" Sam snapped. "This is important, Dean. Please, just- look at me. We really need to talk."
"It's just the one cut. You were lucky," he informed him, enfolding the hand in question in both of his before lighting them all aglow, healing him. He opened his hands and checked the skin again, satisfied when he could see no sign of it having ever been marred. "You're in your head," he said, softly matter-of-fact as he continued looking over Dean's hands, tracing the broadness of his palms, the delicate bones of his wrist with lightly skating fingertips. "I know you. You think that this- this secret is your fault, somehow. It's almost easier for you to blame yourself, because you feel like you have no control over what Sam does. Almost like you're being abandoned. And blaming yourself lets you believe you have control over the situation." He looked up, directly into Dean's eyes.
Cas straightened up in his seat, the old chair creaking a bit with the adjustment. “What is that supposed to mean?”
"It's okay, Dean, you don't need math skills- you've gotten this far without them!" Cas looked immeasurably pleased with himself at the two consecutive digs, and added half the chocolate to the pot with a brief little stir. It changed the color and texture of the liquid drastically. Light, frothy brown turned a deep, silky sepia.
Cas took his hand and squeezed it reassuringly for the briefest instant before releasing him again. "I'm glad we're on the same page, then," he said sweetly. "If you've finished your hot chocolate and would like some more, I can teach you how I made it. It's done on the stove."
"I'm talking about your plan to buy a house, with Cas, that I never heard about until this morning!" Sam snapped. "How fucking blind can you be, Dean?"
After tossing and turning in clammy, tangled-up fits for most of the night, Dean managed to drag himself out of bed at about nine thirty. He'd wanted to be up and moving by seven to make sure he had enough time to get things done before Sam got back to the bunker, but something kept him laying heavy and sad beneath the sheets far longer than he'd expected. He'd slept like shit, but that was hardly anything new. No, the problem was the feeling he couldn't hide from that he'd irrevocably fucked up with Cas, despite his kind words as he forced himself off to bed. Hell, Cas apologized to
Instead, he got to spend his day staring at a wall of arugula, kale, spinach, romaine, baby spring mix and more while attempting to decipher which one Sam meant by the opaque 'salad greens' on the list. He went with the spring mix, for variety, and the kale, because it was purple. He sure as hell wouldn't be the one eating it, but it would look pretty in the fridge next to the blueberries. Other than his toss-up salad dilemma it was a routine trip- Brigitte at the register was a perfect sweetheart as always, and she somehow managed to get him all caught up on all the last month's town gossip in the time it took to ring him up. A miracle worker, that one. Without her, how else would he know about every salacious piece of news Lebanon had to offer? He simply wouldn't, and he'd be all the worse for it. From the look on her face, he thought she might cry when he finally told her he was moving with Cas, but instead she smiled and handed him some free cigs and a bottle of red wine, so they could 'celebrate'. Maybe he really was her favorite.
before being sucked back out to rejoin the larger body of water and craft new shapes in an endless cycle of creation. He leaned back on his hands and turned his face up into the sunlight- warm, bright, gold, and let it kiss skin that had lived underground and in the shadows for far too long. It felt so good to sit there and breathe in the mild air, with nothing to do and nowhere else to be. His eyes drifted shut as he luxuriated in the moment like a cat stretching out on silky sheets and listened to the soft babbling of the water.
"After this one we'll probably have enough for dinner," Jack said thoughtfully, peeking into the cooler tank and frowning at its fullness.
"Well, if you think about it, it's been, what, three months now since either of us have been on a hunt, yeah?" Dean asked, already starting to second-guess his impulsive offer.
"Oops, right," Sam chuckled, returning to the table to retrieve it. He paused for a second, looking at the camera in his hands. Quite shyly, he said: "You know, you're right, Cas. About Rowena, and Eileen. And Eileen..." He steeled himself with a breath, and continued. "Eileen knows. She gets it. God, she's the best person I've ever met. Maybe that's part of why I love her so much," he said, painfully sincere. "I haven't been able to really talk about it much, yet. It's still so hard. But I will. We will."
"Only when he can't sleep," Cas said gently. "He needed me, and I was obviously available to help. I don’t sleep." Well that didn't sound vague and able to be interpreted a million different ways at all. Dude had no idea what he sounded like, like they were-
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean whispered, letting his head fall back against the truck window, baring his throat further, and closed his eyes. He seemed almost happy, today. He seemed to light up in the lead-up to their more dangerous missions, and Cas didn’t want to think about that right now. Didn’t want to ruin the moment. “Didn’t want to wake you up,” Dean elaborated.
Cas put the same perfect swirl of whipped cream on top, and the same precise sprinkle of cinnamon, and it tasted just as out-of-this-world amazing as the first batch, but something was off with the two of them, and Dean had no idea what he could do to make things right again. He resigned himself to the awkward silences, the painful smalltalk that would inevitably fill up the space between them until his transgression was not only forgotten, but forgiven, too.
Dad never apologized for hitting him, or for the night of his fifth birthday, he just moved on with the hunt, and every time after that when he hit Dean just- never happened, either. It wasn't something they talked about. It simply was.
, Dean." He made it sound like a vow, his eyes just a little too bright, too intense, too blue to be human.
"Hey, Dean," Sam replied, stirring something on the stove. Probably his weird egg white scramble shit he liked so much, with little bell pepper chunks and feta cheese in it. He'd never admit it to Sam's face, but it was actually pretty decent.
Cas quickly assumed an incredibly serious air. "It's a top secret recipe," he said finally, his fingers steepled under his chin. "I came up with it myself. It's got sea salt and honey in it."
"I think one and a half is plenty, baby," she said kindly, humor glinting in her eyes. "You wouldn't want to be sick and ruin your birthday, would you?"
"Oh, I wasn't in your head, but you're thinking pretty fucking loud," Cas snapped back, then paused, looking a little shocked at his sudden flare of temper. "I'm sorry," Cas said, visibly controlling himself, and deliberately folded his hands on the table in front of him. "Please let me help you. It will be- distressing for me if you're affected adversely by this night and I could have made it easier. I know you feel like you have to care for everyone, all the time, but- Dean. Let me care for you, too, sometimes."
"Maybe he isn't. But I just see this ending with you getting hurt because you're willing to be so blindly naive."
. He set the pot down and swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, rubbing at them furiously to try to make them stop their stupid, useless watering.
"I guess they have rules against this sort of thing. Nice to see more magic-users with a code, I guess," Dean replied over the phone. He tossed back the last of the whiskey he'd poured for himself while he waited for Cas to finish up his 'surprise' and set the glass aside. Just a couple fingers, nothing too crazy. Cas had some too, but his Grace didn't let him get drunk unless he suppressed it, which apparently felt like the celestial equivalent to the feeling of wearing all your clothes two sizes too small. So, uncomfortable. But it didn't really matter. This was the good stuff- it was more about the taste, anyway. "You heading home?"
"Yeah, that is what's important," Dean echoed. "We really are better together, Cas." Cas's phone buzzed.
He looked up at Dean and pulled off with a smacking little 'pop', lips swollen and cheeks flushed pink. It was indecent. He scrambled to sit up enough to take his shirt off, straddling him in the process, and Dean surged up to meet him with a searing kiss, holding tight to the tops of his thighs. Then Cas decided to grind down on him, and Dean's brain short-circuited.
"Well, turns out this Charlie is just as good with computers as the other Charlie. Cas knows more about it than I do, but basically she wiped our names clean, just- scrubbed our records and gave us good credit scores to boot. Hell if I know how she did it, but she's scary, dude. We owe her, like, so bad now."
"Okay, speed-racer," Dean interrupted with a tight little grin, still trying to make his stupid brain shut up, trying to make his heart stop doing the stupid squeeze-thing. It didn't work, completely, but he tried. "Just tell me what exit to take and we'll go from there, okay?"
The leftovers all put away in a haze, Dean found he'd moved over the sink, hands full of dirty dishes, the sink already packed with Sam's bowl, the pot and the skillet. He looked at the mountain growing before him with an abject sense of duty and rolled his sleeves up to begin the dreaded task of washing up. He set the dishes and bowls to the side on the counter and started in on the pot.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cas extending the tape towards him and so he reached back to take it- maneuvering deftly around a large pothole as he did so- and something went awry. Cas inserted the mixtape into the tapedeck in a single smooth, practiced motion, and Dean's hand went fully rogue as it failed to intercept the tape, landing, instead, palm-down, about midway up Cas's thigh. What he should have done was just take his hand back, and apologize, and laugh it off. Eat a gummy bear, like it was no big deal. Cause it wasn't. That's not what he did.
It takes everything in him to turn his back on it again, to look at the angel instead, but the door flies open. Billie is there, and she is angry.
"Well, that's no excuse to-" Dean started on autopilot, going right into "Family Beat Down Mode", and then finally processed what Sam said. It took a second. Early morning, and all that. "You- oh," he said weakly, before bursting into raucous laughter. "I can't believe you actually did it!"
It flopped down into his face a bit as he rinsed it out a second time, and he realized it was getting pretty long again.
“I- when I was dead. When I was in Heaven,” Jack says hesitantly. “When I was in heaven, and Cas came to bring me back, we were attacked.”
"But why permit your pride to let you suffer at all when there is a solution readily available?" Cas asked, rolling his eyes. "There's no shame in asking for help. I think it's a great show of strength to admit when things have gone beyond one's own abilities."
With a final shout John broke his stepfather's hold on him, whipped around and hit him, hard. Grandpa fell, and John kept hitting him, and Grandma was screaming and crying and pulling at John's shoulders but he wouldn't
"No, I'm not," Dean admitted. "Hell, after running and fighting non-stop all these years, the last couple months might be the youngest I've ever felt."
"So what does Charlie have to do with you two just up and buying a house?" Sam nudged, trying to eek out some more information.
echoing in the small room as John's hand connected with his face. Before he could recover, John had him by the front of his shirt, dragging him up to growl in his face, breath reeking of whiskey. "You think you're some kind of hero, boy?"
Cas shrugged, silently texting Claire back. "Oh!" he said, "we might have enough service again to play the song, let me check."
"It's forgotten," Cas said, refusing to meet Dean's gaze directly and instead looking somewhere in the general vicinity of his hairline.
"Hey!" Dean objected, then reconsidered. "Okay, no. You're right. I've definitely seen better." His last attempt at a nice loaf of pumpernickel ended in smoke alarms and a tragically collapsed loaf that was as hard as a brick. They lapsed into awkward silence, punctuated only by the sounds of dinner.
a nasty little voice asked in Dean's head, conjuring up every time he so much as looked at a man when it was of his own accord, when he wasn't cruising for a john or trying to hustle somebody, every time he noticed a smile, a jaw, broad shoulders, narrow hips and thickly muscled thighs without so much as a drink in him to smooth the way and ease the guilt that was bound to follow when he couldn't tear his eyes away from a
Oh, what if they got one of those giant bathtubs, all sparkling china and big enough to lay down in without his knees sticking out over the bubbles? He'd always wanted to try something like that, ever since he saw one on TV in a nighttime ad when he was eleven. He'd never had the chance, but it looked like
Christ, if Cas's words don't cut Dean straight down to white bone, laying bare every thought Dean has had in his darkest moments, the pain and blood and useless destruction he lives on repeat in his mind every day wishing he was
how do a federally wanted, multiple times over legally dead man and an angel in the body of america's handsomest missing person purchase a house?
He'd spent the best of three decades desperately trying to be his like dad. He projected the most earnestly learned, hard-won copy of his father, (
"Alright then," Cas said, turning slightly in the chair so he could place the book on his lap and face Dean as he read. "'The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale-'"
Dean shoved down his fear and tried again. “Listen to me.” He stepped closer to Cas, swallowing hard as his voice fought to stick in his throat and looking steadily into his eyes. “Listen- I know there’s a lot of bad water under the bridge. But we were family, once,” he pleaded. “I’d have died for you. I almost did a few times.” Castiel’s face remained impassive but Dean continued. “So if that means anything to you- please,” he begged, abandoning his pride. “I’ve lost Lisa, I’ve lost Ben, and now I’ve lost Sam. Don’t make me lose you too.”
But he was grown, and he had errands to run, so there would be no long freedom drive. At least, not right then.
When he read through the paper that night, after Dad passed out (blacked out), he found their obituaries. Millie Winchester Thompson and David Thompson, dead in a car crash. They were killed instantly.
He doesn’t look at Jack, but keeps staring out the window as the world races by. Taking in the gleaming, bloodless carnage around them as they turn off the highway into Lebanon and speed through the town, he has a moment of clarity.
Dean stood up and stretched, lifting up his arms, twisting his torso left and right and yawning when the pull hit just right. He walked over to his dresser and started picking out some clothes, pointedly keeping his back to Sam.
"Yeah, I guess that's middle America for you," Dean replied, eyes darting back over to Cas. "Pretty typical, buddy," he tacked on sympathetically.
he thought miserably, looking forlornly at the gummy bag perched between them, sandwiched between the clementines and the beef jerky, no longer hungry in the slightest.
But Castiel snapped up a hand, palm out, and Bobby’s mouth moved, but no sound came out. “You will be silent,” Castiel ordered, his eyes never leaving Dean. He looked intrigued by Dean’s sudden compliance and admission. “I’d like to hear what you have to say, Dean. What can you possibly say to justify your lack of faith in me up until now? I could have cast you back into the pit, and Sam, too, had I not done this, all of it, for you.”
"When Jack was dying, I... I made a deal to save him," Cas admits, and a pit opens right up in Dean's stomach.
“No, Cas,” Dean interrupted before his brain or his fear could catch up to him. “It’s- it’s scrambling your brain.”
he has been- I know he misses Jack, and I'm all else there was at the time, so sue me for working with what I got," Dean said, grandiosely, righteously angry- "but whatever you're trying to imply, drop it. It's not fair to Cas, for you to think I'd just- fuck him and dump him like some one-night stand and expect him to stick around afterwards anyway! That's not what this is. You know he's like family to me-" his voice cracked. He worked his jaw for a moment, trying to get it together. "After Chuck, after- everything, I'm just trying to be a better friend to him, Sammy. That's all," he said wearily.
"Not really," Dean said, trying to wrap this thing- whatever it was- up as quick as possible. "Anyway, why are you so obsessed with me and Cas lately? You got a crush, Samantha? You wanna pull Cas's pigtails? Cause last I checked you're a taken man."
Dean made a valiant effort to swallow the bile starting to rise in his throat as it became appallingly clear that, whatever the fuck else was happening, the job just- didn’t
, his blue eyes tender with an emotion he couldn’t name. “I’m not going anywhere, Dean. There’s nowhere else I’d rather be than with you. I’ve made my choice. That’s not going to change.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice cracking as he forced the words out of his shockingly dry mouth, his heart racing in his ears. “I don’t know why I said that. Please- please don’t go.”
"We need to make sure there aren't any clumps," he murmured, directing Dean's hand towards the pot, holding it closed around the whisk, his chest pressed against Dean's side and his left hand bracing lightly on Dean's back. "Stir slowly, like this, or it might splash up and curdle on the sides of the pot."
"Eileen told me," he answered honestly, "when we had movie night about a year ago. The night we watched Dracula- the one with Winona Ryder. And Charlie told me about an, ah- an
sleep. No nightmares, no monsters, no grief could follow him into a sleep like that. And he craved that sort of sleep with every bone in his body, engrained there by habit and fear for the things he knew still lived in his mind in spite of the years and distance that separated them from the 'now'. Nothing was stopping him, technically. He was an adult, after all, and he could make his own choices. But still, a strange sense of shame followed in the mornings he gave in to the siren song of the bottle, as if the others looked at him and knew. Not only knew about this ridiculous need, this weakness in his being, but judged him for it. Or pitied him.
occasional Janelle Monae. 'Dirty Computer' was a masterpiece, okay? And it reminded him of some of his favorite 80s and 90s dance music, stuff he danced to when he was a kid just out from under his dad's thumb at the turn of the millennia, crashing clubs with a smile and a wink and sliding onto the dance floor for a couple drinks and a good time. He missed that freedom, sometimes, to do whatever he wanted.
Cas looked at him funny, clearly skeptical of the quick subject change, but the power of sweets won out. "I'd consider telling you," he said, a spark of mischief appearing in his eyes, "If you promise to give Sam his birthday gift-"
"Oh," Dean hedged, looking to Cas uncomfortably for help answering. "I guess whenever we want? After the 7th, I mean."
After he donned the robe he crouched down beside his bed and tugged Sam's present out from beneath it. It was an obvious hiding spot, sure, but that's exactly why Sam would never look there. It was a decent size box and wrapped in some cutesy bird printed wrapping paper Cas brought home one day a couple years ago. Not too shabby, as looks went.
"I'm sure whatever he's got going on, he's fine, Cas," Sam said gently, sliding something onto the plates he had lined up. "I mean, he is God. And we're all still standing, and earth seems to be doing alright, yeah? He'll be back. We just need to give him some time."
"And they couldn't have come at a better time," Dean teased. "I can't wait to not have to clean up after you 24/7 anymore."
Without a word, Cas walked him back to the bathroom and waited patiently for him while he brushed his teeth and splashed cool water on his face. Once done he led him to his room and opened the door, letting Dean enter first and closing it behind them as Dean sat wearily on the side of the bed. He patiently handed Dean a clean pajama t-shirt, then turned on the small desk lamp and shut off the main lights while he waited for Dean to change. He watched over him without shame or impatience as Dean slipped into his big old t shirt and best fuzzy socks and stripped off his sweatpants before sitting back down with his head in his hands.
It would be faster than doing it himself, and he probably wouldn't get so much loose hair trimmings all over himself if he had a towel to catch it. When he did it himself the thing kept falling off his shoulders and he couldn't find a way to keep it up. He ended up in the itchiest shirt known to man by the time he was done, hair falling down inside the collar every time he moved and scratching at his skin underneath the fabric. If Cas did it he could just sit still while he worked at it, and come away relatively unscathed at the end. He probably wouldn't even have to change his shirt after.
Dean nearly choked. When he finally unglued his tongue from where it had welded to the roof of his mouth, he tried to return the sentiment. It was always better when Cas was around. If it were up to him, the guy would never leave. They'd smoke weed and sit in the sun and drink hot chocolate and drive around the countryside until the day he died, and then Cas would take him up to Heaven, because of course he would, and things could be like that there, too. If Cas stayed. "Yeah, ok. Cool," he said, nodding along to his own words like an idiot. "I like it better when you're here, too," he added, so-fucking-eloquently, his hands open on the table, palm up in a helpless little gesture of 'what can ya do about it? it is what it is'.
It was like any 'cool' or suave aspect of his carefully crafted personality had vanished, all because he did one small thing, made one tiny mistake, that seemed unbearably, inexplicably gay. Holding someone's leg in the car, oh, shit, listening to a mixtape he made for him- that was something people who were together-together did. And, fuck, what if
He was still keyed up when he slipped under the sheets, and he didn't fall asleep for a long, long time. When he did, he dreamt of dirt, dust and the dark, and of monsters- of searching endlessly through trees and hills and rivers for
Their intel was wrong, so wrong, and Cas didn’t know how the fuck it happened, but they were fine, they were almost finished, closing up the trucks in the alley behind the supermarket and waiting for Dean and Trish to return from sweeping the perimeter, when out of what seemed like thin air and with no more than a broken shout for warning there were more Croats swarming them than he’d ever seen in one place before, and Joe and Maya and Kris were dead, and Dean was nowhere to be found.
"Cas, it's just a song," Dean said. "I'm fine, I promise. Sometimes, triggers happen to us that don't make sense, and then sometimes they go away. I
"Do you mean that?" he asked, taking Dean's chin in his newly freed hand and tugging him forward until their noses were practically touching. He nodded, almost imperceptibly, his heart in this throat, and then Cas's lips were on his and they were kissing. Just lips pressed to lips, soft and sweet and so
"Don't deflect," Cas said authoritatively, his patience spent. "You're intelligent and you have the most giving heart I know. However, it can be intimidating, I think, sometimes, for people to talk about this sort of thing, and so they don't necessarily tell the people with which they have the most to lose. And for better or worse, you can be intimidating, too, or at least appear closed-off, stoic." His expression softened as he spoke again. "Not everyone knows you as I know you."
"My ribs," Dean panted out in pained little gasps. "Broken. There's something in my back." He twitched minutely as if to show Cas the problem and immediately convulsed involuntarily at the pain the movement caused him, a horrible rattling moan in his throat. "My leg. Right one. Broken too." His jaw was clenched so tightly it was a miracle he could speak at all through the teeth-grinding pain he was in.
He was probably wondering how much longer until they got back, and Dean should probably ask him to start pre-heating the oven.
Cas was standing at the stove stirring the soup, tension deepening the lines on his face as he appeared to be lost in thought. Sam didn't look much better, still seated.
"I'll take care of that," he said quietly, still seated. "It's late, and you have much to do tomorrow. You should go to bed." His soft tone belied the underlying message-
No thunder accompanied their exit as it had their entrance. They were simply there one second, and gone the next, with no trace of having been there at all, except for-
“Dean, last night, when you couldn’t sleep, I dreamed again about Detroit-” Cas started to confess feverishly, almost against his will, Dean stiffening up at his words in his arms, and was interrupted by the sound of people approaching, footsteps, voices, and an earsplitting wolf-whistle directed at their compromising position.
"She can do that?" Dean asked disbelief. "I was half expecting to have to go on the run if the realtor so much as looked at us funny today, and you're telling me-"
"There's plenty," Dean affirmed. "I have three more big containers like this one tucked behind the frozen cherries." Cas asked Sam some questions about the hunt while Dean prepped everything, and Sam asked about Cas's bees, which quickly turned into a debate about the merits and drawbacks of Carnolian or Italian Cordovan bees when kept rurally, which was something he had no clue Sam knew anything about at all. Dean knew Cas was getting Carnolians so the debate seemed pointless, but whatever. It did, however, jog his memory.
"Did I do something wrong? Is that why Daddy doesn't want to be with me and Sammy anymore?" She looked at him, shocked, unable to begin to formulate a response. Her hands twisted at the fabric of her blouse as she stared.
) and saved the entire fucking world, and where did it get them? Here, with Cas making yet another sacrifice to try and temper the disastrous fire that burned in Dean, because he
routine. Him and Cas, sitting down to drink good whiskey and just be around each other until someone broke for the dinner table, then after, taking a beer each from the fridge and settling in their armchairs to watch a movie. Together.
“Chuck,” Sam interrupts. “It had to be.” He strides into the room with the map table, eyes darting around the room and searching for any sign of life. “Dean!” he shouts, to no response. “Cas! Castiel!”
Just as Dean made up his mind to go, Cas looked up from his book and directly at him, instead. His eyes lit up. "Dean," he said in greeting, before a look of concern crossed his face as he realized just how late it was. "Are you alright?" he asked, taking his feet down from the table and setting the book aside.
Three years later, when Dean was eight years old, they were sitting in a shitty motel room outside of Fort Madison, Iowa, waiting for Dad to bring out something to eat from the convenience store for dinner, but when he came back, his face was red and his hands held a newspaper and an immense bottle of cheap whiskey, already open. He threw a plastic bag at Dean, who caught it and looked inside.
chapter 4 is coming up thursday after next! the rating will be going up. i hope you're alright with that :)))
In the last five months, before settling into whatever this was, they fought God, nearly lost Jack, killed Death, killed God. He lost Cas, and had gotten him back, again (
"Huh," Dean said, thrown. All he could think of is the day after they got Cas back from the empty, the first time. He and Cas played at being cowboy-rangers all day for a case, ending with dinner at a diner that served the best peach pie he'd ever had, and, full and happy, passing out on the sofa next to Cas while they waited for Sam and Jack to get back to the motel. They all watched a Star Trek movie when they arrived, the one with the whales, and Dean had never felt so happy. So at peace.
"'M not doing anything," he mumbled belligerently, and promptly sliced his left ring finger on a particularly jagged shard. He reflexively dropped it back to the ground and stared as blood welled up in thick beads along the cut. "Oh. Oh, shit." He stood up quickly and stuck his hand under the tap. It stung, distantly.
"Feels big," Dean admitted, turning the handle with deliberate care and shortening the line. "Probably another catfish."
“We need to be prepared for the worst,” Sam says, tense and rubbing his hands through his hair. “The people in town, on the road- they’re all gone. You saw it too. We have to be ready-” he pauses, working around the sudden lump in his throat. “Dean, and Cas… they’re probably gone too.”
"Fortunately I don't think that should be much of an issue. As long as the two of you have lived here, Dean has managed to accumulate surprisingly few possessions beyond clothing, records, and things in his 'Dean Cave'. And I don't really own anything," Cas reminded them.
He tried to think back to the last time he and Cas had left the bunker for a hunt. There was the rugaru just before Christmas, and a pretty decent sized vamp nest they helped the girls with clearing out in January in Amarillo, and after that…
"No thanks," Dean said, visibly shuddering. "I love Eileen, but I want to be as far from here as I can when she brings that dog in."
"Oh my god, what the fuck?" Dean asked the room at large, so excited, before narrowing his eyes suspiciously. "Dude, you never cook like this. I didn't know you
"Maybe someday," Dean said, "I'll get there." Now that he had a someday, it didn't feel quite as impossible, anymore.
April 19th, 2012, under the peak of the Lyrids meteor showers, Cas flew for the last time, right up to the gates of the camp.
"Oh my fucking god," Dean said. "Try youtube. Spotify can be a bitch, I don't know what else you can do, man."
"Ugh," Dean groaned, flopping dramatically back onto his pillow. "Can't you just fly us there?" he whined petulantly.
Cas's face relaxed, and his shoulders too. "Well, then I'll repeat myself. That's not possible. I love you."
“Toilet paper, milk, cheese, butter,” he interrupted, “plus sugar, flour, canned fruit, hygiene products, toothpaste, toilet paper, coffee, meat if we can get it, .35 and 9mm ammunition, mechanical oil, gasoline, propane, rubbing alcohol, gauze, surgical tape, toilet paper, paracetamol, and oh, toilet paper again!” Cas recited dryly, rolling his eyes. “You gave us a written list yesterday. Twice. Couldn’t fuck up blackout drunk.”
He nodded again. Grandma and Grandpa left and shut the door, but he could hear them whispering faintly, though the words were unintelligible.
thanks for reading! as usual I can be found on tumblr at @hisbloodyhandprint and @hasjacklesspokenyet
“And Sam’s betrayal?” Castiel inquired, casting new fear into Dean’s heart. “He stabbed me in the back. And he has not knelt as you have. Why should I offer him mercy?” he mused.
The walk back to his room seemed less lonely and long than usual with Cas's arm brushing his as they moved.
He moved suddenly, sending Dean’s heart sprinting again for what felt like the hundredth time that day.
"Coffee?" Sam asked again, sounding absolutely desperate to return to the original question. "Coffee. Leave me a mug and I'll grab some in a bit? I was about to go on a run."
Cas bit his lip again, hesitating. "Perhaps I shouldn't have shared this information with you, tonight. Maybe coming from Sam-"
"Oh," he said awkwardly, "I mean. That's great. But. We're not gay?" he cringed at the sound of his own voice.
“Then why suggest my leaving at all? I understand,” Cas said softly, as if realizing something, “if my being here is too much.” He paused for a moment, then continued on, saying: “If you don’t want me here, I’ll go.”
Dean walked across the kitchen, past Cas, and didn't touch him. Didn't clap him on the back, or squeeze his shoulder. Just, you know. Gave him space.
Cas wasn’t dead. It didn’t work. His brain buzzed blankly with a static-y sensation of bewilderment as Cas reached around himself and pulled out the blade- shiny, clean, utterly free of blood- with an alarming squelching noise.
Sam smacked him on the arm before he could even react. "I know what you're insinuating and... no. Just no. Besides, it's not my place, it's yours. I think this is something you two should deal with together. Adding me into the equation will probably just make any issues with a difference in taste worse. I'd be fine to help out here though, if you want. I can't believe you're getting out of here so soon. Are you sure you don't want to wait?"
John laughed bitterly, throwing a bottle past Grandma's head. It hit the wall and shattered, and she barely muffled a squeak of fear. She steeled herself in the face of her son's blind fury and tried again. "I don't think you've spent more than a week with Sam in the last year. He wouldn't know you if he saw you. But Dean loves you, John, he does, and you're breaking his heart. I won't let you see him like this. And I won't let you see him only to leave him again. He deserves better than you right now."
your past is just your story. once you realize that, it loses its power over you, and you can begin to create your future.
In that moment they reached an unspoken understanding. Cas let him go, let him look away, before drawing Dean's head down to his shoulder as gentle as could be and wrapping his hand around the back of his neck. Dean drew his arms up around Cas's waist, letting the angel take his weight as he held him close. They stood there for an indeterminate amount of time, swaying gently while Dean floated, half off in some other world and half as grounded as could be by Cas's solid heat.
The door opened and Sam popped his head in, looking entirely too pensive for this early in the morning. He took a strange little breath before entering completely and shutting the door behind him, and leaned on it, effectively trapping Dean in there with him. He didn't speak, and Dean wasn't about to open up a conversation. It was a matter of who would break first, and either speak (or just leave, in Sam's case. Please leave, man.)
"You think you know anything about this 'ridiculous crusade?" he snarled, getting in Grandma's face and towering over her, waving a bottle with a black label around clumsily. "I know what I saw that night, I know someone, some-
In the last hour he'd gone from assuming Cas, as an angel, had about a net total of zero interest in sex to dry-humping his best friend in his bed because said best friend loved him. Was in love with him.
He tried to pull his leg up along the mattress closer to his body and his back twinged, so he rolled over and stretched, arching his back and pulling on his arms with a little breathy grunting noise. He felt the muscles and sinew start to loosen out from their sleep-stiff setting and give way so he let go of the stretch, falling back against the pillow gratefully.
Cas reached down into the footwell and then straightened up abruptly, handing Dean the bottle. "She's coming up the driveway now." He got out of the car.
"David," Grandma said, her voice pinched. He came back with a glass of half drunk milk, utterly bewildered by the sudden change in the direction of the night, the anger gone from his face. "I think Sammy needs to be put to bed. It's late." She came around the table and picked Dean up out of his chair and set him on her lap, rocking him a little as he cried. "Make sure you get the frosting off of him or he'll be sticky in the morning." She smelled like gardenias and fresh bread. Mom used to smell like flowers sometimes, too. The memory made the tears come even faster than before and he hid his face in her shirt, clinging to it with tiny hands.
"Don't- you'll get a stomach ache," Cas said absently. "And no, I'm not reading your mind," he tacked on, his eyes gleaming with mirth, "you're just obvious, too."
"Cas- I'm not. I don't think you're a child, and I'm sorry it came across like that," he placated. "I just don't think you've thought this through, at all- or you have and you decided you were going to go through with it anyway. I know Dean hasn't processed anything beyond whatever impulse he had to ask you to do this, and hell if I know how he ever managed to even do that."
Cas wasn't back yet, wouldn't be until at least eight or so, and Sam wouldn't be back until even later in the evening. Dean had already wrapped his present, which was a pretty damn awesome surprise, if you asked him. Maybe he could take that drive once he put everything away- go fishing at the river, even. Getting another tank of gas wouldn't break Charlie's magic card. What else was he gonna do, rattle around the bunker and wait for everyone else to get back? Not likely. He set the envelope on the kitchen counter and set off into the world again.
Once he'd set the perishables in the cooler and turned his sights towards the post office, he realized he still had a ton of daylight left. The keys were there in a large padded envelope, presumably along with some papers and other things for the house- Dean wasn't really sure about the whole document side of things. He ripped open the envelope the second the Impala door closed. Two dull brass keys fell into his hand, and a remote controller for the garage. The physical objects themselves, just sitting there, made the whole situation seem so real. He could drive home now and let himself in. Of course, it wasn't really his yet (
"Wait," Dean said, smacking his hand down on the table of either side of his plate, making his fork jump, "What did you do?"
How many more times would he do this? How many times before had he followed Chuck’s script, followed the patterns and cycle of hurt and pain, with every part of him screaming on the inside? How many times had he let his fear get the better of him and turn into this resentful anger even without Chuck’s control, lashing out at the people who loved him? How could he know which was which? How many more times could he hurt Cas, who hadn’t breathed a word of his confession after all this time, not
and his best fake ID photo. A birth certificate. Trade school certification in automechanics. A social security card. Bank statements with proof of savings.
Cas narrowed his eyes almost imperceptibly before relaxing again. “What do you mean?” he asked icily.
"Oh, man," Dean said, a grin taking over. "You're gonna love it. It's the best soup in the world, and that's no joke."
. It makes his lower lip tremble, makes it burn just to breathe, because Dean realizes now that this really is all his fault, and Cas is going to
Cas looked up at him and put the whisk down, pushing the pot back off the burner so the bottom wouldn't scald. "I don't know what you're talking about, it's a simple question," he said with wide, innocent eyes. "It's alright if you don't know the answer," he added, reaching around Dean, presumably to grab his mug from beside his hip and refill it. For a second, his body blocked Dean in against the counter, and before he could back away again, Dean grabbed his tie and held him there, pushing up into his space as the angel froze. Cas flailed for a second, clearly with no idea where to put his hands, before they ended up on Dean's hips, just a ghost of a touch.
. You’re not my family, Dean,” he said, closing the remaining distance between them until he stood less than an arm’s reach away, positively radiating power, the air vibrating with it. “You’re just… human.”
In the silence that followed, he swore he could hear the humming of the lights around the border of the room, the slight electric buzz of the lamp between them on the side table. It sounded like summer. Like bees.
Sam snorted. "Fat chance, Dean. Even with an actual angel helping keep your arteries clean, you wouldn't make it to sixty if you ate like this every day." He shook his head fondly. "This is definitely a special occasion meal."
So he put on Dean's second favorite fuzzy socks, the ones with the little green dragonflies on a pale purple background, and then he was standing there in the lamplight, grabbing the book off the desk and crawling into Dean's bed in Dean's clothes, like he belonged there. In them. To him. And he wouldn't leave because Dean asked him to stay.
“You sure did, Cas,” Dean said faintly, drifting further into Cas’s orbit as if somehow compelled. Castiel didn’t acknowledge him, keeping his back turned, his spine ramrod straight. Damage control. Holy fucking shit, damage control
Dean had forgotten about the whole house thing. Okay, not forgotten, just gone a bit... complacent. He'd thought he'd get around to looking, eventually, and now here they were and whoa, ooooookay, this was all happening kinda fast.
He tried not to drink himself to sleep anymore, not since Cas came back. After all, he wasn't getting any younger, and the hangover the next morning reminded him of that every time. But it was hard- so, so hard- to resist sometimes when he knew that the sweet embrace of a bottle like the ones waiting patiently for him in the kitchen could solve all his problems and plunge him into a deep, dark,
"Sure," Dean said uneasily, handing it over. "Hey, man, if I made you uncomfortable..." He trailed off, unsure how to continue. Grabbing Cas's tie and turning on the bedroom eyes was one thing when he thought they were both in on the joke, but if Cas really hadn't meant it that way at all, then what the fuck did he just do besides fuck up an otherwise awesome night over a little game of gay chicken? "Nevermind. I did, didn't I?" He sighed heavily. "I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
Well that was his name getting dragged into the fight, and whatever they were pissed about, it didn't sound good.
The words rang in Dean’s ears, banging about his brain and battering it into despair. It felt like a small death, his heart pulling on his ribs as he floundered for a new angle to pursue.
. I can't," he whispered, his voice leaving him- the combination of the realization and the forced vulnerability of the moment scooping him out from the inside and leaving him hollow.
“Okay,” Cas echoed, nodding his head with a small smile teasing at the corners of his lips. He picked his glass back up and resumed sipping at it as if nothing had happened while Dean just sat there, motionless, trying to process whatever the fuck definitely just happened.
where they were at. "Dean, shirt off. Lift your arms," Cas commanded breathlessly, and Dean obeyed easily, the shirt flying off into some dark corner.
“I appreciate that.” Satisfied with the rather outrageous hickey he’d created on Dean’s neck, Cas pressed it with one last kiss. “How’d you know I was behind you?” he asked, pressing their foreheads together and slowly grinding their hips together lazily, just breathing Dean in.
This wasn't what he had in mind. He'd thought, oh, a peck. A couple short kisses, maybe, that they'd work up to something even as hot-and-heavy as making out, over the next couple weeks or so, but he was almost naked, and so was Cas.
"No," Cas said, smiling, and choking, and took Dean's cheek in the palm of his hand with a terrible ache rising in his throat. "I can't."
"Oh, shut up," Dean grumbled, giving up on his shame and dropping his hands. "I'm not old. And you're like, a bazillion years old, so you can't exactly talk."
Cas gripped his cup tightly, knuckles turning an alarming shade of white. He set it on the side table between them with deliberate care and folded his hands in his lap, the muscle in his jaw jumping wildly and belying his otherwise composed voice. “Is this yet another dismissal, Dean? After everything, are you really going to make me leave? Again?”
"Well if that wasn't opaque as fuck and horrifically vague," Dean started. "What are you talking about? I work on the car all the time."
He took his hand back, and Dean's heart jumped. His arm felt warm, against the fabric, where Cas's hand had been. He started up the mixtape again, and they rode on in companionable silence for the rest of the tape. Cas rewound it carefully and tucked it away wherever he'd produced it from earlier.
"I know, Dean," Cas answered. "I know. It's alright. Truly. I'm sorry, too." Dean relaxed, if only incrementally.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Sam said, annoyed. "Rowena is important to me, and Eileen knows that."
She picked him up off her lap and set him down on his feet on the honey-colored hardwood floor, before standing herself and taking his hand. She led him upstairs and into the bathroom, where Grandpa was waiting with Dean's favorite truck pajamas. He washed the tear tracks from Dean's face gently with a warm purple face cloth, and they helped him squeeze out some toothpaste onto his toothbrush. As he brushed, they exchanged a knowing, loaded look over his head that he saw in the mirror but couldn't understand.
"Wait, what's it called? Who's it by?" Dean asked, glancing over at Cas's near-rapturous expression.
and pushed Grandma back. She nearly fell into the glass shards but managed to keep her feet beneath her, looking shocked. Grandpa grabbed onto John in a bearhug from behind, pulling him back and away from Grandma. John thrashed in his grip, spitting and shouting obscenities. "John, please," Grandma said. "Be reasonable-"
At that moment Cas came back downstairs, eyes shining, completely oblivious to Dean's Situation, and blurted out: "Dean. We're buying this house. Don't say no."
"So this is like, a celebration breakfast, then?" Dean asked. "Or is this going to be a regular thing? Cause I could get used to eating like this."
"I'm fine, Cas," Dean contradicted weakly, watching the blood stain the tap water pink as it washed down the drain before moving as if to clean up the pieces on the floor again.
“Besides,” Dean said with a forced lightness, taking a rather large sip of whiskey, taking solace in the smooth, sweet burn, “how would you move them? Not exactly an easily portable hobby.”
Cas approached him, then, unfolding the fleece blanket draped over the end of the bed, and laid it carefully over him. He draped it around his shoulders and pulled the soft brown warmth of it right up around Dean's chin as he dropped his hands to take hold of it, leaning his forehead instead against Cas's side as his eyes fluttered shut.
Nothing. A fat lot of nothing. No cases no one else couldn’t pick up, no monsters that they’d never heard of before terrorizing some town they just had to take out because no one else could handle the gig.
Bobby started to kneel, too. Survival instincts, probably. He’d have never gotten this old without them, anyway.
It was chilly in the hall, so much so he would be tempted to sweep the place with EMF if he didn't know better. It was just one of the prices they paid for living underground like some kind of mole. As it was, he was almost tempted to turn right around and crawl back into bed. Almost. Coffee and food and
So far in the car while driving to Milton he'd played some pretty great stuff- classics like Jefferson Airplane and Creedence Clearwater Revival, dance and alternative rock shit he knew Dean liked, like some XTC, T-Rex, Kate Bush, old-school and later-days Bowie, even the Pet Shop Boys cover of "Always On My Mind", and some stuff Dean would never, ever admit to anyone else he loved- Taylor's new album
chapter 4 will be up next thursday, if all goes to plan. your comments and enthusiasm are giving me life. thank you all!
“Anything,” Dean swore. “Just- Cas, please. I’ll do anything. I will, I swear it. Just please help Sammy.”
"Does this look right to you?" Jack thrust the phone in Dean's face, a drawing of a fish that admittedly greatly resembled theirs already loaded on the screen.
Cas sighed heavily and tucked his phone into his front pocket. "I guess we can listen later," he said with a heavy sigh, as if the spotty, unreliable cellular service in the midwest was a personal affront to his sensibilities. He crossed his arms and stretched his legs further forward in the footwell, settling in for a long expanse of nothing but new grass and the purring sound of the engine. "Can't you go any faster, Dean?" he asked abruptly. "I can hardly believe we still have over one hundred miles to cover."
"You're a such a fucking girl," Dean muttered, then raised his voice. "Yeah. Sure. Pictures. You got it."
No one else was there yet, probably all still dicking around at the camp mess and drinking shitty chicory. His feet fell silently on the earth, leaving behind the sound of the universe and the vibrant humming of Dean’s soul- and oh, he hoped he could always hear that symphony, even when all the rest of his powers had run dry.
His earliest memories were a tapestry- faded now, but a tapestry nonetheless- woven in his father's grief, his brother's need, his mother's absence, the inception of an emptiness in Dean that he thought would never be filled.
“Cas, I swore my obedience to Heaven, once. To God, and his angels. To you,” his voice cracked as he risked a glance at the former angel. His eyes were like fire. Glowing.
“I’m going in,” Cas said quickly, slicing at a particularly bold (stupid) Croat trying to charge him. It crumpled to the ground and twitched once, and was still. Some of its companions fell on the body ravenously, and were subsequently cut down in turn as they began to tear at the corpse. “Leave as soon as you’re able; I’ve got the keys to the main truck. Cover your right,” he warned Risa, and, sensing an opportunity in the parting sea of Croats before him, ran.
Dean cleared his throat. "Cas- I- ugh." He gave up. "This," he said, pushing his memories of those days at his friend like a prayer, hoping it made it across, and hoping it made sense.
As a large cargo semi-truck roared past them, heading north of the other side of the road, Cas spoke again.
"Well, then, sorry for- for projecting, or whatever," Dean said gruffly. "Guess it's about to get even better, then. Real house, coming right up. No more underground hideaways, you know?"
“And she’s gonna kill you, and then she’s gonna kill me.” When he finally does meet Dean’s gaze, the fleeting moment doesn’t bring the relief Dean thought it might. Instead, it makes his heart hurt, and it’s not even Billie’s weird witchy magic crap this time, it’s the ache of
He had never felt so weak. Groveling to his dad was different. He was his dad’s son, sure, but there was no love there. It was all survival, clinical, even his rage and his fists when Dean didn’t do enough to earn his mercy were detached. Duty and discipline and disappointment. This was different. It was hot with near-tears, messy and filled with grief for a man who wasn’t even dead. He wasn’t lying earlier when he told Cas he was like a brother to him. It was the closest comparison he had for what the angel was to his heart. He had never needed anyone like he needed Castiel- because he wasn’t Sammy, or Bobby, or Lisa, or Ben, or Cassie, or any other category of need. He was just Cas. And Dean
"Even you have to know how sad that sounds, Cas," Sam said, so softly it was almost inaudible in the hall. "Pining away over Dean until- what? Until he dies?"
"Cas, please. Don't make me say it again," he said, already second guessing the impulse as he pushed the covers down on the right, laying the blanket back over the bed, and got in on the left.
"Because we didn't tell them that we're moving out of the bunker, I assume," Cas said, a bit sheepishly. "I didn't want to jinx it. I guess Sam told her."
"Whatever, man," Dean said, even though that was exactly what he was going to say. How could Cas know him so well and still think he was in love with him? "We'll probably go into Merriam to visit the Ikea tomorrow or the next day, try to plan out some furniture, just to get the ball rolling. Oh, and I want the nice leather and wood armchairs."
He shook his head and tutted, unfolding his arms in a deliberate, cocky sprawl. "Cas, you dirty bastard. I didn't know you had it in you," he said, an approving, devious tone to his voice.
, like he'd somehow done something wrong, too, by letting Dean act like a pervy idiot. Cas was too good, and it scared him.
"And?" John snapped, kicking off his boots and taking a swig from the bottle, the liquid sloshing inside.
"Okay," Sam said. "Forget it. This conversation is pointless." He turned to leave, then looked back over his shoulder. "Cas told me you're going to see the house, tomorrow. Have fun. Don't break the angel." He went back into the house in a veritable whirlwind of plaid and Garnier-commercial-worthy hair, and Dean was alone in the garage again.
As he waited for the water to heat up (it wouldn't take long) he hummed under his breath- Taylor Swift, but he'd swear up and down it wasn't if anyone asked. He had an image to maintain: Winchesters did not listen to Taylor Swift.
Piano filtered out of the Impala's speakers, simple and low. It fell and rose, then fell and rose again, like soft waves on a shore, then- stopped.
Dean slid into the passenger seat, suddenly exhausted and feeling entirely too much like a marionette whose strings had just been cut.
"Washing the dishes when you can't even see them properly isn't going to make this better. Cleaning when you're distracted enough to hurt yourself isn't going to make it better either. You're using them to avoid the problem here, because you feel like you've been judged and found wanting," Cas said with infuriatingly calm logic, holding Dean captive to it with inhuman force.
His eyes lingered on Dean’s face, tracing his freckles, his eyelashes. Whatever he was looking for, he didn’t seem to find it. Castiel’s face hardened into stone, his next words iron. “I have no family.”
), are pre-approved for a mortgage, and the house is theirs, once they finish up on the required inspections during a brief escrow period. Dean worried about that for a minute, but the realtor promised them she could take care of all that, since they live so far away right now. After the seventh of May, barring any unforeseen disasters, they can move in whenever they want. She handed them a paper copy of the sale contract at precisely 5:17 pm and sent them on their way with a little wave.
"This isn't real," Dean said, not sure if it was a question or a statement. "This stuff isn't real."
"Hey, "Ten Years Gone" speaks to you, it speaks to you," Dean said. A large cicada splattered on the windshield and he cringed at the sticky gunk, making a mental note to scrape it off when they got out. "It's one of my favorites, too. Clearly, since it's on the tape," he said with an awkward little laugh, bracing himself for the inevitable wave of crushing guilt that had started to accompany the song after Cas left. Cause that was Dean's fault. He couldn't seem to stop driving everyone he cared about away, even his best friend.
Grandma's face clouded, too, her lips pursing slightly, before she put on a smile just shy of believable. "He's busy working. He'd be here if he could, Dean." Dad was gone a lot, lately. No one else's Dad was gone this much. Dean's friends at kindergarten talked about the fun things they did with their dads all the time, like playing catch and watching tv and reading comic books, but Dean never got to do anything like that with him anymore. Grandma and Grandpa were awesome, but he missed his dad.
- Castiel turned back to Dean and met his eyes. “I’m your new God,” he said, with an air of authority and immense self-satisfaction permeating his words. “A better one. So you will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord. Or I shall destroy you.”
. I- no, I would not change a thing, other than perhaps to make your life, or your brother's, or Jack's, or Claire's, have had less pain in them than they have had, because none of you deserved the hands Chuck dealt you. I want Jack back, of course, but I don't wish for anything else. What we have is- it's
"Maybe sometime," Cas said vaguely, tearing his eyes away from Dean with a noncommittal wave of his hand. "Either way, there's not much to pack up. And between the Impala and my truck, I think the only thing we might require assistance to move is that chair set."
The corners of Cas's eyes crinkled up fondly. They stood there for a second, just looking at each other, but then Dean yawned, massively, and broke whatever soft spell of silence had settled over the room.
On the heels of that absolutely insane question, Dean was involuntarily seized by a vision: Cas, reaching down and taking Dean's hand in his own with a playful little smirk, pulling it up his leg, and pressing it down onto his cock. He held Dean's hand there and ground up into the heel of it, hardening slowly under the pressure. He bucked up once, twice, just little twitches of his hips as he started really getting into it, closing his eyes for a second and biting his bottom lip as he inhaled shakily. He squeezed the length of it, lightly, the unbearable heat sending a thrill up his spine, and Cas made this sound, a little punched-out gasp, and helped Dean start to ease down the zipper-
When had their habits merged into one creature? When had they stopped simply existing around each other and started existing together? And why, fucking Jesus, why had he not noticed until now, when he’d barely managed to avert another ‘losing Cas’ crisis?
"Yep," Dean said faintly, doing the same. "Cas, you're sure we can afford this? It's-" he hesitated. "It's so nice."
Two days later his dad woke him up in the middle of the night with a small suitcase for him to pack and a gun in his hand to keep him quiet. He snuck Dean out to the car and strapped him in the seat, then went back in for Sam. By noon that day, they were three states south in a nothing little town, and Dean never saw his grandparents again.
"We haven't decided yet, actually," Sam said. "Maybe July? I don't know. We don't want something massive, but it still takes planning."
Bobby’s eyes widened in the periphery of Dean’s vision as time seemed to swirl and slow down to a crawl- clearly, he hadn’t expected this either.
to leave, I won’t stop you,” Dean said abruptly. “Sorry for trapping you here. I get it, man, you gotta stretch your wings-”
"Well, consider me surprised," Dean said. Something prickled uncomfortably under his skin. Guilt. He took a deep breath. "Cas, I don't want to keep you here- you're not stuck here, especially when I'm knocked out. If you feel like you are, then we got a problem. You don't have to always be around and worrying about me, especially if it's so boring you resort to kitchen experiments to keep yourself busy. You're an angel. Isn't your brain like, the size of a blue whale or something?"
"Oh, my god, Dean," Sam said, exasperated. "Cas. Coming out of your room at 7;00 am and telling me he spent the night in here. That doesn't seem like something we should, I don't know,
"Okay, no, wait," Sam interrupted. "Where are you guys getting the money for this?" he asked suspiciously, eyes narrowing. "Dean, what did you do?"
"Eileen had a long-term girlfriend when she was in her twenties, and they dated a man for some time, together. All before we all met her, of course. Did you know that?"
No. It had taken him ages to realize it, but Dean never wanted to be like John again. And if that meant a couple hundred relatively sober, totally sleepless nights, so be it. A drink a day, no more. He was gonna learn moderation, even if he never reliably slept again.
Dean looked at him in disbelief and back over at the speedometer, which read at a solid 83 mph. Yeah, not exactly faster than the speed of light, but definitely the fastest he felt comfortable pushing Baby on shitty backcountry highways like this. "Hey, you wanna angel-drop us at the house almost two hours early, be my guest," he said, "but I don't think I can do much more here, Cas. Not unless you're feeling like a breakdown or a
He dragged Dean off the bed and stood him up. "Learn your fucking place," Dad barked, digging in his pockets and throwing a five dollar bill and the motel key at Dean. "If he's so hungry, you deal with it yourself."
Then Castiel blew Raphael up with nothing more than a snap of his fingers, and their most formidable adversary, after all these months, was suddenly just a bloody smear on the wall. The last Apocalyptic threat, gone, just like that, leaving Dean and Bobby alone with a Cas-gone-nuclear.
"Literally nothing," Dean snapped. "That's exactly what happened, and that's all that happened. It seemed like a decent idea at the time, I was sleep deprived, and Cas has seemed so lonely, lately. I
Sam didn't rise to the obvious bait. He crossed his arms over his chest and put on a bitch face. "Dean, was he really in here all night?"
"Can't believe you're gonna be driving on your birthday," Dean mourned, looking down into the generously sized blue mug of hot chocolate Cas just set in front of him. "Well, I'll see you, dude. Be safe."
He looked up at Cas from where his head laid on the pillow, the angel near-silhouetted by the dim glow of the desk light behind him. His skin bronze, his hair black and wildly un-styled, his nose and cheekbones straight and sharp and strong, contrasting with the fullness of his lips and the electric blue of his eyes, liquid azurite punctuated by dark pupils. He was sort of beautiful. Inside, too- and he cared about Dean.
. He didn’t know if he’d ever get used to dreaming, as unsettling and involuntary as it was. It felt like the unfair hijacking of an otherwise enjoyable human bodily function, and he resented it altogether. He snagged a bit of weed from his stash and tucked it in next to his flask, sweeping out the cabin door and into the frigid morning sunshine, giving Chuck a lazy wave as he ambled past his cabin to the truck lot, kicking little pebbles across the packed dirt at imaginary targets with a super-human precision that grated strangely on him today.
. Not since he was human, at least, he was pretty certain. And he wouldn't be fucking Dean, that's for sure. Neither of them were gay!
Dean laughed. "It's a saying," he said. "It means that I'd make a bet on it being the same thing we caught if someone offered, because I'm confident."
“We’ll do ours,” he called over his shoulder, continuing down the central path briskly. “We’ve all got our part to play.”
He couldn't exactly complain about it. Cas was an incredible kisser, passionate and all-consuming in a way that made Dean feel almost lightheaded- every sweep of his tongue, every bite to his lips felt like little bursts of electricity under his skin. And his hands, fuck, his
"It wouldn't be a waste, Dean. You need help, I want to help you. It's that simple," Cas said. "Unless this is you worrying about
"Cas," Dean wheezed, lifting his head laboriously to meet his eyes, blood bubbling up between his lips and staining them. "Cas, I'm so sorry-"
Sam flexes his gun hand in his lap and clenches it back into a fist. He doesn’t seem angry, just… lost.
But then the moment broke, and Cas smiled softly at him and took the book, tucking it gently under his arm and holding it to his chest. "Okay, then. Bed?"
"You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you." Cas is crying in earnest now, but his eyes have never left Dean's face. "You changed me, Dean."
plate in front of him and giving one to Cas too. Skillet fried potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs with cream cheese, broiled tomatoes...the fucking works. Cas didn't need to eat, per say, but he'd started eating more- liking the social ritual of it, maybe- and even he couldn't say no to this.
“You’re just saying that because I won,” Cas mused, raising his gaze back up to look at Dean again, pinning him there like a specimen under a microscope. “Because you’re
Dean didn’t know what to say to that. The disappointment radiating from Cas was actually bordering on tangible, the tension in his shoulders clear as he directed his gaze anywhere but at Dean. So he sat there instead, stewing in quiet disgust at his own inability to make it right, to say what he really wanted to say, to say
"What, can't talk to me like this?" Dean grumbled, hands slick. "Hang on, I gotta finish this up or I'll probably bump into something and end up with a fuck ton of grease everywhere that I don't feel like cleaning up."
Cas touched his shoulder and he leapt to the side, startled, and knocked one of the dirty yellow bowls to the floor, shattering it.
His razor buzzed pleasantly, audible even over the sound of the running tap. He couldn't believe, sometimes, how he had shaved with a straight razor he scavenged off a monster in Purgatory for almost a year. It was a beast of a thing, long and rough-handled. One wrong move and he and Benny would have had more vamps than they could count all over them. Sure, he trusted Benny not to eat him then, to a point, but Purgatory was crammed full of things desperate to eat a human being, and Dean- Dean was basically fresh meat. Monster bait. An all-you-can-eat buffet, if he wasn't so damn good at killing the things that wanted to kill him. When he fucked up his wrist he bitched for three days straight about his beard until Benny sat his ass down in a creek bed and did it for him.
Yeah, his other kid was pretty great too. Even if she was fucking terrifying little hellion. And she was his kid too, wasn't she? He still wasn't sure how that happened, but damn if he wasn't grateful.
"I was going to tell you at breakfast," Cas said, hands tucked in his pockets, "but between the whole Sam thing and you ditching me there with him to come hide here- thanks for that, by the way- I didn't get a chance."
"What?" Cas asked, confused at the sudden, seemingly unprompted question. He flipped the tape manually but kept it paused. "What do you mean?"
"Here, Grumpy," Dean said, setting the gift in front of him and taking the ladle from Cas. He poured them each a good sized serving, one for Sam as well, and handed one of the steaming yellow bowls over to Cas. Dean followed with soup and sandwiches as he made his way over to the table and they sat, Dean accidentally bumping Cas's knee under the table as he went. He flinched so hard he almost launched himself over the table. "Whoops. Alright, open her up, Sammy," he said, brandishing his soup spoon in his general direction and shoving Sam's bowl at him. "Happy birthday, and all that."
As he rounded the corner and approached the door, Dean quieted his footsteps and his breathing, situating himself out of sight so he could listen to whatever else they had to say without involving himself.
"I understand," Cas said. "This is challenging. And I know you're not an idiot. You're incredibly smart-"
John froze. "Better?" he said softly, dangerously. "Better? I'm his fucking father. I'm all he's going to get."
He'd slowly faded out of the dance scene as he approached his mid twenties, and pop punk started its meteoric rise. Then out of nowhere, Dad disappeared, and he had to ask Sam for help, and well... he knew how that particular story ended. But it made him feel wistful, all the same.
Dean barely noticed them merging onto the highway. Cas handled the on-ramp with ease and shifted lanes with a deft sort of precision, the gear shift operated like an extension of himself.
"Let me help you," Cas offered, face open and guileless. "You won't dream unless you want to- if this is about your nightmares, I'll protect you."
“You know,” Dean hedged, “when you… decide you don’t want to live in the bunker anymore, get your own place. I don’t know. I mean, I know you don’t actually want to stay here forever, man.” There it was, easy as anything.
Cas huffed a little laugh out his nose, hardly even a puff of air, really, but it tickled Dean's neck all the same. "Worst case scenario we'd have to start over, and it's getting late." His chin rested on Dean's shoulder for a long, syrup-y moment before he retreated, extricating himself back to his post nearby and relinquishing the whisk to Dean's control and taking all of his warmth and breath with him. His side felt strangely naked after having the weight of him so close. "Don't worry, though. You're doing fine. It looks smooth enough to me- put the whisk to the side and let that rest for a minute. You need to chop the chocolate."
There's a sound behind him like nothing he's ever heard before, and when he looks Dean feels a kind of horror he can only identify as primordial, because that blackness, that writhing void is cosmically
But Cas didn't even turn to look at him, didn't question it, just kept looking out the window and looking at the wildflowers they flew past. The last notes of "The Rain Song" faded out, and Cas sighed happily, pushing off the window and leaning back into his seat. "It's such a beautiful song," he said musingly. "Spring, love- both persevere through winter and hard times. Love and spring are inevitable, in every universe. Sadness, grief, winter, rain- they make love stronger, and the seasons more beautiful. It's an apt metaphor, if a bit overused."
"Have fun!" Sam called after him, and tucked his headphones in his ears for his jog, walking off in the opposite direction.
"Oooh," Dean leered playfully. "Now that would be an interesting threesome. Talk about a catfight ready to happen."
Cas's eyes were even bluer than the sky, Dean decided. He didn't care if it sounded dumb, because it was true. He thought he should maybe be jealous, but realized he wasn't, not at all, because they were part of Cas, and Cas was the best. His best friend.
. Against his will he could feel himself beginning to spiral into a frenzied panic, his chest tightening. "Why- why didn't they tell me?"
Of course, Sam said yes in Detroit. So why dream about that? He lived it every day. The redundancy was irritating at best.
Present and comfortable loungewear acquired, Dean rushed back to the kitchen, his stomach growling insistently enough that he almost missed the sound of raised voices coming from the kitchen.
Sammy was strung out and swaying on his feet behind Cas, his eyes darting and rolling over the room as he rode out the hellish things that tormented him in his head, seemingly incapable of reacting to the gravity of the situation as what Cas had done put him out of his mind with fear.
"'The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay. I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer—and what trees and seasons smelled like—how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding —unfriendly and dangerous. I always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling about the two ranges of mountains....'"
"Surprise, Sam," he said sheepishly, raising his mug in a 'cheers' gesture, "Guess you're not the only one with news."
"So you see," he said, turning away from Dean and moving as if to inspect his explosive handiwork, "I saved you."
. On second thought, maybe they shouldn't try to get one. He'd live and die in that bathtub, warm and floaty and smelling nice until the end of time.
were worth turning into an icicle. After breakfast he was going to take advantage of the bunker's stellar water pressure and take a nice, hot shower, and he was going to enjoy it.
"Couldn't sleep," Dean said shortly. "Decided to take a walk and maybe grab a book, try and read myself to sleep or something. I don't know," he said. "It sounded like a better idea in my head."
Somewhere around the beginning of the fifth chapter, after a valiant effort at remaining awake to interact with the text, Dean began to snore lightly, little puffs of air fanning out of his nose and mouth and over Cas's side. He laid the book aside, carefully marking their page. In all likelihood, Dean would ask him to read aloud again tomorrow. For now, he would watch over Dean, and protect him from whatever may come in dreams.
"He has your stepfather and me," Grandma said, trembling in her robe and slippers. "He doesn't need you. Not like this."
i hate the henry winchester storyline sooooo i gave millie a second husband it doesn't change canon that much and it's spicy. tw for past child abuse and depictions of alcohol abuse/discussions of alcoholism in this chapter. this chapter got absurdly long, so i've broken it up into two parts to make it easier to read. the first part is what was posted today, and the second half will go up on sunday
"Well, big brain or not, you'll resent me for it if you make yourself stick around out of fear, or responsibility, or whatever. I know I have some issues sleeping, but other than that, I'm great. I'm great. I'll be fine if you need solo Cas-time, off on a shiny cloud or roping up some fucking stardust somewhere."
The river in front of him glittered and gleamed with the brightness of the day, the ripples on its surface nearly imperceptible. Where the water met the bank in front of him, it was nearly silent, brushing up against the sandy clay with a little
“Mmm, morning,” Cas murmured between kisses. “You’re out here early.” Dean’s neck was uncharacteristically bare above the neck of his rough brown sweater, creamy and invitingly unmarked. Cas indulged in the impulse to change that, working his way over the tender skin, sucking and biting until a bruise began to bloom below the junction of Dean’s jaw and neck, worrying it with his teeth until it was a deep reddish-purple.
Just as he reached out to take Dean by the shoulder and turn him around, Dean moved with a sudden burst of energy, like a coiled snake striking out. He whirled around and met Cas’s eyes, took him by the neck and the waist, and kissed him. His lips moved with a gentleness that contradicted the intensity of the grip of his cold-fingered hands as they worked their way into his hair, wormed their way under his trenchcoat, and touched the bare skin they found where the hem of his t-shirt met his jeans. He met the kiss eagerly, licking teasingly at the seam of his lips, biting down gently and coaxing Dean into opening his mouth. He pushed Dean back until his back hit the nearest rusted army-green truck with a small thudding noise, pressing himself up against Dean and tugging on his hips so they were pressed flush against each other, the contact sending and electric thrill racing up his spine.
Sam snorted in disbelief at his response, his eyebrows advancing toward his hairline at an alarming speed. "Yeah, Cas."
Cas isn't done. "It's not," he says, certain even as tears begin to form in his eyes from the strength of his conviction. "And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for
Then, he hit his head on the fucking faucet and made the stupidest noise he'd ever heard, a yelp-grunt-choking sound, and fell on his bare ass, on the cold tile floor.
after, or anything. Like if you wanna stay and, I don't know, just, read your book at my desk, that would be okay. It's just. Staring while I'm asleep, you know? I'm not some teen girl with vampire boyfriend"
Dean took a couple sips and steadied himself. Charlie was awesome. Cas was awesome. This house was awesome. Everything was great, and he could absolutely schmooze with this lady like a champion to make sure they got this goddamn house.
Then again, he'd had some pretty surreal times with Cas, and apparently God couldn't write Cas for shit, so...
"You should ask, Sam," Cas said encouragingly. "I bet she would help you too, no questions asked. She's really grateful that Jack brought everyone back- when Stevie disappeared right in front of her, she was so torn up... knowing it'll never happen again, that Chuck can't interfere with their lives ever again, is
," Sam reiterated. With that, it was like his brain suddenly kicked into overdrive. "This is insane. I have to tell Eileen," he said, his fingers already flying across the screen, salad abandoned. "Where is it? What's it look like? Why didn't you send pictures when you saw it?"
“You need to get on 281, Jack. On the right,” he says, hearing himself as if from a great distance. They’re nearly there, and Dean still hasn’t called him back. It’s been almost four and a half hours since they left the uselessly warded silo outside De Moines and started the race back home. It’s been radio silence all the way. Literally. When Sam tried to turn on the radio in the car, desperate for a distraction, all that came out was a piercing static. On
“I was blind,” Dean said, “and proud. I took you for granted, and I can do better. Be better. For- for you.”
"Aww, that's so sweet," Dean cooed on sarcastic, touchy autopilot. "I'm glad you like my food, Cas. It's the least I could do."
Cas rolled his eyes and reached down to pick it up. "Yes, I do," he said, placing it carefully on the table beside the crossword.
Cas hummed, and opened the book. They sat in silence for a moment. Dean shifted, the mattress squeaking slightly beneath him.
"I love you, Grandma," Dean said, his voice loud in the quiet stillness. "I wish Dad was like you and Grandpa," he admitted, his young voice almost venomous. "I wish you were my real parents."
"I just wish he'd been more clear with his timetable, then," Cas snarked back, looking exasperated. "After he brought me back from the Empty, he didn't tell me..." he trailed off, before shaking his head. "He didn't tell me anything much at all, really," he finished sadly.
Panic started to set in and Dean's heart began to race as it seemed like Cas might reject the peace offering he'd impulsively extended to him.
He sat up with a falsely casual air, rolling his shoulders and yawning. Cas was still there, surprisingly, sitting at Dean's desk in the world's shittiest chair, just holding his book on his lap. He was perfectly still, his eyes shut, like he was meditating, or something. Dean wasn't even sure if the guy was breathing. He squinted, barely, trying to make out if his shoulders and chest really were rising and falling ever so slightly or if it was all just in his head.
"Regardless of your stubborn, juvenile reaction to something like this, it really is time for you to get up," Cas said in the single most passive aggressive tone possible. "If we want to be on time for the showing we need to leave in forty-five minutes. Forty-four, now."
"Sorry," Cas said, too excited to be properly sorry. He was practically vibrating in his seat. "It's the next one on the right. Two and a quarter miles up."
He was sober today, mostly, just riding out the last of some gorgeous pink pill from a nearly full bottle he’d just scavenged out a few days before. It made him feel floaty, focused, fearless. He felt almost like he did two years ago, before his reeducation stint in Heaven. Angelic. It was nice. He’d take another, later. Maybe Dean would want to take one, too, and they could fuck high out under the stars on their quilt again like they did last October and feel like the real Gods of this stupid little planet, on top of the world, on top of Dean, cradled in the soft embrace of his thighs, and
"Hi Claire, hi Kaia," Dean said absently, then registered the rest of the message. "Wait. What? Why?"
hurt right in his chest like when Billie was squeezing his heart. But of course, he wasn't dying. It was just a song, but something about it was so beautiful and terrible that it reached down right into his center and grabbed on to his ribs, pulling the most gut-wrenching sense of longing out of him. He realized, as he listened and wished and felt himself break, that he'd never seen the ocean. He had never been to a little seaside town perched up on the coastal rock-faces and let himself dream, had never gotten close. But somehow he felt, still, that longing, aching nostalgia for some connection, some thing he'd never had. He wanted to tell Cas, make him understand. But how could he? He couldn't even understand, himself.
Cas would probably help him this time, if he asked. Dean figured he'd do at least a part way decent job all told, as precise and detail-oriented as he was, and he knew the guy could handle a blade better than Obi-wan Kenobi himself. Trimmers weren't that different. He'd figure it out.
Cas's hands were always warm. Not hot or clammy or anything, just warm. It would be a lot nicer to have Cas's hands on his neck than his own, which were usually pretty cold unless he did something to change that, like running them under hot water (hey, like a shower) or by really working up a sweat. Cas, by virtue of being a feathered phenomenon of the cosmos, didn't have to worry about things like poor circulation and whether or not he needed to wear fuzzy socks today, or if normal ones would do. Dean always noticed Cas's hands. It was hard not to, especially times when they were closest: when he would heal Dean with just a touch, when their fingers brushed together on a glass, or a knife, or a bottle, or when they would hug and he could feel the warmth-pressure-squeezing-broadness of them through his shirt.
Cas felt a bubbly panic rise up in his chest through the haze of battle as it became clear to him that Dean wasn’t coming back. Even from the other side of the building or from inside, there was no way that Dean had not heard the commotion of such a large fight.
"Well, glad I've improved, I guess," Dean said, shifting his weight between his feet. What else could he say? "I like the now-you, too, Cas." That would have to do.
Even as Cas’s memories softened and blurred, becoming tinged with a mortal haze, that memory of Dean remained in a sparkling clarity. He could imagine no life, no moldable version of the past, in which he did not choose Dean. From the very first moment his soul had reached back to cling to Cas’s Grace in Hell, Cas had fallen, was falling, would fall, for Dean. It was inevitable, his love. They were inevitable. They fell together in the time after Detroit, into battle, into bed, and into cosmic obscurity. Soon, too soon, their losses began to outnumber their wins, and they had to make more and more certain regrettable sacrifices just to stay alive. Cas was used to collateral damage, far more than Dean was, but whatever the other humans in their ragged camp believed of him, he wasn’t unaffected. Just the opposite, in fact. He had never felt anything before, not for billions of years, an incomprehensible existence of light and intent and obedience and war, and now he felt everything. That- not Dean’s disappointment, or the slow loss of his Grace, or his Father’s unyielding silence- was undoubtedly the worst part of becoming something like human.
They sat there quietly a little while longer, the great oak clock ticking softly in the hallway. It rang eight times, and a toilet flushed upstairs.
That was his lowest moment. He sat on his knees until they went numb and then, between one breath and the next, he was screaming. There were no words for the way that he felt, no way to let the pain out of his chest and get away from it, and so he screamed and sobbed until his voice gave out and he couldn't breathe through his nose or see through his tears. He picked himself up and curled up in Sammy's bed and let his brother tell him, not so convincingly, that it would be okay. That he'd be okay, that he should sleep and he'll feel better when he woke up. It was a lie, Dean knew it was a lie, but he was too tired to argue. Too tired to fight off the crumbs of hope Sammy was trying to give him. He passed out in Sam's room like they used to when they were younger, and tried to believe that this wouldn't kill him. That losing his family wouldn't be the thing that finally broke him. That he didn't want to be dead, too.
"There is a Lebanon Farmer's market, Dean," Cas interjects. "It's usually every Monday in City Park in the summer. I've wanted to go for a while, but I've never had the time," he said wistfully, pushing the now-complete crossword away from him, leaning his head in his right hand and propping his elbow up on the table. "I always thought it was something Jack would like."
The curve of his shoulder, well muscled, the line of his hip and his narrow waist beneath the blankets, the softness of stomach and thighs, the arm holding Cas close even in sleep.
"Coffee?" Dean asked hopefully, turning to where Cas sat at the table and making grabby hands at the mug Cas held out to him, not even looking up from the crossword he was doing. He took a massive drink from it, draining nearly a third of the bittersweet liquid inside, and sighed happily. "Thanks, buddy."
“I’m sorry,” he whispers. It’s not enough, not by a long shot, but it’s all he has. What else is there to say? They’re dead already. It’s just a matter of moments, now.
thank you for reading! you can find me at my spn tumblr @hasjacklesspokenyet, if you so wish, so if you wanna hit me up with comments/complaints/compliments/questions you don't want to post here, go nuts. love ya'll <3
Dean's ears were ringing with the force of the blow. "I- Dad-" he stuttered out, dazed, pain blooming in his cheek.
He drained his mug and rinsed it out by hand, soaping it up and rinsing again. He toweled it off and put it in the cupboard, but just as he reached for the pot on the stove, Cas stopped him.
There were a surprising number of crates and boxes remaining in the storage and unloading zones, either empty or nearly so, and he quickly ascertained the area was, apart from himself, devoid of life or anything of interest to the camp.
"Buddy," Dean said, basking in the heat of chocolate-and-whiskey-induced bliss, "you got more than lucky. This is
"Do they not trust me?" Dean interrupted, his words spilling out so quickly they threatened to blend together. "Do they think I'd be a bigot, or something? Because I'm not!" He wracked his brain for some kind of proof, latching on to: "Charlie! And Claire- I love them! There's nothing wrong with people being gay. Clearly. Even if I'm not gay, I know that. I'm not an idiot. I might not get this whole polyamory thing, but I can try-"
Cas's mouth latched onto his nipple, his tongue flicking maddeningly at it and rubbing at the other with his thumb.
"Can you fuck off then, man?" Dean asked, peeved. "He's my best friend, and you're my idiot brother. I'm not fucking Cas. I'm not gay, and even if I was, he's an angel," he said meaningfully. When Sam looked at him blankly he sighed, then elaborated: "Angels don't have
Dean's stomach twisted. "Well, maybe once it's summer and things get started up again around here, Jack will have some free time on his hands again. How long can restoring cosmic balance take God, anyway?" he said, trying to put a good spin on things. It was too early to think about this. He knew it wasn't quite the same as the connection Cas had with him, but missed the kid too. When Chuck wasn't actively manipulating him into taking a gun to his head or making him say shit about Jack not being family like Cas was for the sake of his stupid script, he'd actually come to think of him like a son. And beyond whatever it was they all have with Claire, and whatever regrets he might have about Ben, Jack was the closest Dean was probably ever going to get to a son. He'd gotten used to having him around, taking care of him and spending time with him. For his overgrown toddler to be the new God was... hard to come to terms with. So he tried not to think about the whole thing too much, and instead just let himself hope that someday he'd come back home to them.
"Holden used to remind me of you," Cas said. "Much of his better qualities- his bond with his sister, his particular sense of humor, his resilience- he shares with you, still. Once I saw a great deal of his anger, his hopeless nihilism, his innate need to rebel and carve out his own space in you too. Not so much anymore, though. You've changed, in the years I've known you. Holden still lives in your past, but I prefer the man you are now, and the man you will be, to who you were in the 'then'."
"That looks like a big one!" Jack said excitedly, shuffling over the rocks towards him for a closer glimpse at the end of Dean's line, which had stretched almost completely taut with the force of his catch's pull.
"I- okay," Sam said, clearly making a massive mental recalculation and regrouping valiantly. "Did you ever consider that this might mean something different to Cas than it does to you?"
. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are." His voice chokes up and clouds with something that, directed at Dean, feels like a hazy sort of benediction, an absolution he knows he doesn't deserve.
Cas patted his hair, his fingers catching briefly in the longest strands, and left the room with no further pronouncements. The door closed softly and for a moment Dean simply lay there, as if he had been stunned by the simple contact, feeling all warm and fuzzy in a way even his brown blanket couldn't provide.
, he thought, hysterically, before stomping that into oblivion and turning around. Can't force someone to be your friend. They are, or they aren't. "Just- good night, I guess," he said haltingly. "And, Cas.
"So, we're out, Cas. I mean,  you know, mostly- other than helping Sam with lore research sometimes, or getting the girls some advice- we're
“Felt you,” Dean said, bringing their lips together again briefly. “Always can.” One more little kiss.
He woke up five hours later on November 16th, 2020 to a crash of thunder so loud it knocked him out of bed. Before he'd even rubbed the sleep from his eyes he was on his feet and tackling a wan-looking Cas in a full-body hug, and he was crying again. He tried to thank Jack, to squeeze him tight too and never let any of them go again, but Jack gave him just a perfunctory hug before extricating himself, and Dean was left standing there absolutely speechless.
"Love you too, Grandpa," he choked out between sobs. Grandma rubbed soothing little circles into his back and hummed low in her throat. It sounded kind of familiar but he couldn't place the tune. She let him cry it out for a while, and when he started to quiet, with little hiccups punctuating his slower breathing, she started to speak.
Dean felt his heart warm at the kid's sincerity and laid a hand on his neck fondly. "We'll have so many more just like it," he said. "I promise."
this is part 2 of the chapter that went up two weeks ago, but it's technically chapter 3 now. i know i said this would be up on sunday, but idk. i'm sorry, life happened. it's going up now. as usual, no beta, so pls point out any mistakes you spot and i'll fix them. enjoy!
After the last five months of tiptoeing around each other (and Sam, and Eileen, when she could get there, and the hunters that kept coming by for Sam’s help or to use their library, and so on) in the bunker, that honestly wasn’t anywhere close to what Dean might have expected to hear from Cas. Maybe something more along the lines of ‘I miss Claire, we should invite her and Kaia to come back soon’ or ‘Why does Sam make fun of you for watching John Hughes movies when you can’t sleep? They’re perfect examples of 1980s teen genre film’ or even ‘I tore my jeans at the seam along the thigh,
"Good!" Sammy said from his high chair, smearing frosting on his fingers and licking it off with a wide smile.
"Dean, I- I have to try to heal you," he said slowly, knowing that Dean wouldn't want him to be wasteful with his Grace. But this was beyond what human field medicine could help.
"I promise. Love you, Dad," Jack replied, so softly Dean thought he hadn't heard it after all, but Cas gasped and just held Jack tighter.
“Cas,” Dean said, drawing his attention back to himself. “He didn’t know what he was doing. Can you try to forgive him that?” he pleaded as the first tear escaped and ran down his cheek.
And so mystery bathroom guest came running up to him, putting warm hands on his shoulders as he knelt down beside Dean, looking at him with concern in his blue, blue eyes, and not even deigning to act embarrassed about the whole thing, just asking in his perfect, sex-deep voice:
As the skin merged into a puckered, raw-looking pink scar, Cas dropped his hand away from the wound and found himself utterly breathless, gasping for air and drained.
"Cause I've tried to get him to talk to me, and it's like it just goes right over his head. It doesn't seem like you two are on the same page, and that worries me. Because I care about you both."
He stepped out of the car and walked over to where Cas was already shaking the realtor's hand. She led them both inside and around the ground floor, giving them a little rundown speech about the specs: "Four bedrooms and an office, three bathrooms, new kitchen- and the basement is top-rated for tornado safety. There's a cellar, too, that could probably be expanded if you so desired."
He stepped under the beating spray and felt his muscles start to relax, his shoulders dropping the tension they carried around out of the sheer habit of years lived in survival mode. Always on the move, always ready to make the split-second decision that would determine whether he would kill or be killed. The Dean of 2002 would never have believed he'd get to be this old, as ensconced in the brutality of the hunt as he was, and and as convinced as he would become of the inevitability of his own demise at the hand of another. That Dean thought it would be a treat to see the next year. He couldn't begin to imagine thirty, let alone forty.
When Cas came back they hugged for a long time. It was, probably, the best hug of Dean's life, because he thought he'd never get to have it, ever, but he did. And then Cas was back, and stealing Dean's sweaters, and drinking with him in the evenings, and watching all of Dean's favorite movies from the armchair next to his, and they never, ever talked about what Cas said before- before.
"Yeah, I can do that," Dean said. Suddenly embarrassed, he added: "Sorry, Cas. You're still gonna get me my baby tomato plants, right?"
The first time Jack left after they'd defeated Chuck destroyed him. After they got home he'd spent the next four days haunting the bunker in a haze of grief that even Sam couldn't reach through. It was the final blow to his fragile state and he just couldn't shake it no matter what he tried. He'd prayed to Cas so many times he lost count, begging him to come back. To come home and to be alive and to never, ever, ever do that to him again. He prayed to Jack, to Amara, even, in a fit of insanity, to Naomi.
"Millie, what happened?" he asked, unstrapping Sam and hoisting him onto his hip. "Shit, his bib-" He set Sammy back in the seat for a moment and tossed the dirty green dinosaur bib onto the table before picking him up again.
It was a miracle Lucifer let Dean go. He had brushed him off as a non-threat. Unimportant on a cosmic scale, however important Dean was to the vessel. To Sam. So Dean walked out of that run down building alive, and he was the most beautiful, terrible thing Cas had ever seen. His soul shone brighter than even an archangel’s grace in his rage and trembled with the fierce sharpness of grief, and it was glorious,
"I wouldn't get rid of this," Cas said, holding it up in front of himself and inspecting the label on it before fixing his eyes on Dean. He could feel the pressure of Cas's gaze on his cheekbone, his temple. "It was a gift from you."
"Old man?" Dean practically shrieked, indignant. Cas tried and failed to stifle a laugh behind his own still-steaming mug, bumping the table with his knees as he slid into his seat. "See if I give you your present now, asshole."
Cas adjusted the covers around his waist and propped himself up against the headboard, oblivious to the noise in Dean's head.
"Like, the apple pie life?" he laughed darkly. "Hell, you've had that. I have, and I threw it away. It just never fit, no matter how bad I wanted it. A wife, a picket fence. Did you want that?" He didn't wait for an answer. "Every hunter does, every damn one. Of course you gotta, too. You know," he rambled out, "when you meet somebody, move out, get married, have a baby-" he felt a sudden rush of anger, irrational and all-consuming. "When you leave, call me up sometimes, yeah?"
"Good morning to you too, Dean," Cas said mildly, uncrossing his legs and then crossing them again, his right leg on top this time. It was so unfair that he could spend all day and all night in the same clothes and not deign to look even the slightest bit rumpled. The whole angel thing definitely had its strong points. "I'm pleased you slept well. I only wish you'd allow me to help you more often. It is- fulfilling."
Of course, his Father didn't answer. Gritting his teeth, Cas yanked out the stake and tossed it aside, immediately covering the wound with his hand. He summoned his Grace together and it responded sluggishly, but his hand was glowing and Dean's back was knitting back together.
"Yeah, well, still," Dean said lamely, waving the hand not holding the rumpled towel awkwardly in front of his groin around to try and make his point. "Can you- can you turn around and let me get dressed?"
It simply hadn’t worked. He mourned the loss of one more skill in the darkness of their room that night as Dean slept uneasily in the bed beside him, one more thing which, in its absence, made him ever more useless to Dean, much like the loss of his ability to time travel, or to smite their enemies with ease. Flight was becoming difficult by the day, and he knew in some part of his mind that his wings would be the next to go, and he would be grounded, permanently, on Earth and
"Yeah okay, whatever, mom," Sam brushed him off. "You do realize that story doesn't make any sense, right? Dean, if you were asleep, how is that any different than Cas sitting in the library by himself? Dude, you're buying a house together, he's pretty much the only person you hang out with, and now he's spending the night with you," he listed off, gesturing wildly as he counted his points on his fingers. "What if that sort of thing matters to him? What aren't you telling me?" he asked, getting more worked up by the second.
“You doubted me. Fought against me.” He slowly turned to face Dean, a mockery of their first meeting in that rundown barn years ago, tilting his head the same way, his blue eyes the same limitless color and just as mesmerizing, but somehow about a million times more unsettling. “But I was right all along.”
"Not me, ask him," Dean said smugly, brutally throwing Cas under the bus as he gave the melting soup a brief stir.
He punched the pillow and flipped it, resting his cheek on the cooler side. He screwed his eyes up tight one last time before resigning himself to the facts- sleep wasn't coming any time soon. As he sat up, the blankets fell away and dropped to the mattress beside him. The chilly draft in his room buffeted him with little gusts of air and he braced himself, his shoulders hunching forward against the cold even as his skin drew up into little goosebumps, the hairs on his arms standing on end like soldiers in a row.
"What can I say, Plant and Page are geniuses," Dean started. "No one cares if it's a cliche. The poetry, the music, they speak for themselves, man. Even cliche shit can seem revelatory when you experience it like this."
"No- no," Dean said hastily, still clinging to Cas's sleeve. "Just. Stay with me? I don't know..." he trailed off. He swallowed and made himself let go. "Please stay. I don't want to be alone."
As he snuck over to the top of stairs to peek down through the railing bars, hoping to catch a glimpse of what was happening down below, he nearly tripped over himself at the rage in his dad's voice he sounded huge and terrifying and very, very drunk.
"It's a good look for you," Dean said gruffly, staring at Cas with an expression he could not recognize. There was blood still smeared on his cheekbone, he noted absently.
“You- you want to keep bees?” he asked slowly, rolling the idea around in his mind and testing it out. Cas liked nature. He liked walking in the sun, he liked small animals and plants. He pointed out rare species he spotted to Dean sometimes when they were working a case or driving around with such enthusiasm it was like they were winning lottery tickets. He had a fuzzy little cactus-succulent-desert plant arrangement thing Claire bought him potted in his room, sitting under a UV light on his desk, and he treated that thing like a baby. “Isn’t that kind of a big commitment?”
Dean rolled his eyes. "Big lug can't keep his goddamn mouth shut for anything. Cat's outta the bag, I guess. Why does she text exactly like you do?" he asked.
Their lips slid together, the angle just a bit off center, until Cas tilted Dean's head in his hands. Then they fit together perfectly. He pushed into it, just a little, his fingers flexing in the fabric of Cas's shirt. They explored slowly, with nice, easy, lazy little kisses, letting Cas direct them with his hand on his jaw. It stayed that way right up until he opened his mouth for Cas's tongue, flicking, sweeping, deepening the kiss. Cas surged up under him, all impossible strength and will, and then he was on his back, with Cas on top of him, with no idea how he even ended up there.
," Dean panted out, extracting his hands, grabbing and pulling at Cas's hair until he deigned to come back to his mouth, exchanging long, lingering kisses.
"Good night, honey," she said. In just the faint glow of his night light he couldn't see her face clearly. "Happy birthday."
“Dean, I’m going to raise a colony of bees. I miss the wild hive I used to watch here in town,” Cas said one day, apropos of nothing in particular. “Ever since they moved out of that old tree just down the road it hasn’t felt right around here without them.” He stared down at the ice ball rolling about a shallow amber sea in one of their little crystal tumblers pensively. “I think we’ve got enough space on the bunker roof for a small hive box, and maybe a few flower pots. It could be… discreet.”
"So it's not real life, Sammy, and I thought Cas was going to leave too, again, but he wants to live in a real house with me, and raise bees, and just- live," Dean tried to explain. "When's the last time I went on a hunt, Sam?"
He raised his hand, reaching out two fingers, but seemed to change his mind mid-reach, and then he held Dean's cheek in the palm of his hand.
"Well, we don't want that," Dean said adamantly, letting Cas control the speed at which they stirred.
"I heard that, Dean," Cas said quietly, cutting into his train of thought. "Do you really think my opinion of you could be so easily marred?"
