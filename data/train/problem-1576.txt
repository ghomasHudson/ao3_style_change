Sherlock sighed heavily, before turning to Lestrade and John, gesturing to Sergeant Carter as he spoke.
“You deserve much more than a slap to the face after what you did.” Eyes of pure ice shot death glares across the room to the Consulting Detective.
A nurse entered the room, nodding to Mycroft as she did so, me then proceeded to check John's vitals.
“Okay, I need all the information we have so far about the red-headed lady found in a skip. Have in on my desk in 10 minutes.” Lestrade gave his instruction to the room of workers. They all turned their heads at the sound of his commanding voice, but their eyes found the tow figures walking into the room behind Lestrade.
John smacked his fist down on the dark wood. He was not just angry, he was seething, his fury seeping from the very prose of his body. Sherlock flinched instinctively. Last time he had seen John in this state had been when Mary was diagnosed, and Sherlock had earned himself a punch to the face.
Except it had, because John Watson was now only a stranger to the man he considered his best friend.
Sherlock had done everything he could to make his return as easy and as painless for John as possible. He bought the shopping, and managed to put it away in the right cupboards (with a little help from Mrs Hudson). He refrained from visiting the hospital to do some personal research, and there hadn’t been any decomposing limbs or organs since his return. Sherlock had even gone out of his way to make sure that there was only the required amount of any kind of pill in the flat. He had given the rest to Mrs Hudson to keep in her flat and were to only be returned on Sherlock’s orders. He remembered how John had done this with his supply when there was an immanent danger night.
Sherlock continued to sob into John's shoulder. He had never seen the detective so broken. He and Mrs Hudson had assumed that Sherlock had never had to cope with loss after the apparent death of Irene Adler. But Sherlock had suffered loss, one of the worst losses that John had ever heard about. He hoped that he would never have to experience that, and was sorry that Sherlock ever had to.
Mary had eventually calmed down and together they packed a suitcase full of John’s clothing, ready for his departure to Baker Street the next day. John didn’t realize how tired he actually was until he flopped down onto their sofa. His whole body ached with exhaustion and his eyelids felt heavy and he was struggling to keep them open. He could not pinpoint the exact moment when he allowed himself to give in and let sleep take him, nor could he figure out how long he had been asleep for.
This was hardly surprising. Sherlock had always been a stubborn git and it seemed that John was the only one who could get him to do anything.
Sherlock remembered how happy he had felt as he continued to walk to Mycroft’s. How he couldn’t stop smiling and how his parents had kept asking him about it over dinner until Mycroft had loudly deduced his day, causing him to blush furiously and spend the rest of the evening in a sulk.
In fact, their lives had been far from peaceful, but John preferred it this way. He’d much rather live a life full of unexpected twists and turns than sit there and do nothing. The unknown and spontaneity of life is pretty much what every human being on the planet signed up for every time they made an effort to get up in the mornings. Life is literally walking into the unknown, the unpredictable on a daily basis.
“You know damn well it’s important Sherlock Holmes! You’ve put me through enough already, the very least I deserve from you is the truth. How badly were you hurt?” This outburst caught Sherlock quite by surprise. Only John had ever been ale to achieve this. His looked back at the doctor, whose eyes were fixed on him with such intensity it made Sherlock actually feel uncomfortable, again, something only ever achieved by the man sat across from him.
"You don't understand. Everything we were is in that flat. It's embedded into the wood of the table, it's woven into the fabric of the cushions. It's in the dust, the wallpaper, the very air. Everything is tainted with memories of
Despite her offer, John still insisted that he made the tea. He collected three mugs from the cupboard above the kitchen worktop, ignoring the petri dishes that had also managed to find their way up there.
"Knew me?" His tone was cutting, icy. "Am I dead? Do you no longer remember me? I was under the impression that I was the one suffering from post-traumatic amnesia. So, tell me Doctor Watson, how can it be that you 'knew me'?"
“She said, I was your number one priority. Not Mrs Hudson, not Lestrade, not me, not even yourself. Me.” Sherlock had a feeling that John had just quoted Molly, word for word. John’s mind was brilliant. Not as brilliant as his own, Sherlock thought, but good enough.
“He has a name Sherlock, and it’s John.” John’s breath hitched as he listened to Mary scold Sherlock on his behalf.
John shuffled in awkwardly behind him. Whereas Sherlock was obviously well practiced at this, John had very rarely been picked up by one of Mycroft's cars - with the exception of the occasional kidnapping - and had less elegance and poise as he entered the vehicle.
“Then I came to the last one. ‘The final problem’ so to speak. HE was difficult to catch. One of the best men involved with Moriarty apparently, and very heavily protected. You’ve heard me say before, John, that Moriarty was positioned in the centre of a web, pulling strings and spinning new ones. It was only when I was tracking the final assassin that I realised how big this web was. I was sent to four different countries across Europe. I was caught a few times, and acquired some minor injuries…”
On this particular visit, Sherlock was stood at the window, staring out into Baker Street, watching life flurry past whilst letting his own waste away as he was consumed by grief and guilt.
“Yeah, but still, I could have at least checked on you.” He ran his hands through his hair. “What’s been happening?” His eyes turned to Sherlock, and he moved so he was sat in front of Sherlock. His hands caught Sherlock’s wrists, and gently removed Sherlock’s hands from his hair, bringing them down to hold them between his own. Sherlock’s eyes – grey now – came up to meet John’s blue ones.
John turned to look at Mycroft. It was the first time they'd met face to face since Sherlock returned to 221B after being confined to hospital the first time. Sherlock's welfare united them, but apart from that, John had nothing in common with the man who was the British Government. And yet John couldn't bring himself to not trust the man. So, with Mycroft's encouragement, John finally moved cautiously and with much pent up anxiety and nervousness into the room in front of him. Mycroft closed the door behind John, giving them a modicum of privacy.
John pulled back to look at Sherlock in the eyes, a look of utter disbelief on his face. They stared at each other for a good few moments, before suddenly bursting into a fit of giggles. Their laughter continued, and Sherlock moved to rest his forehead against John’s, the laughter dying off, but big smiles upon both their faces.
They arrived at the mouth of the alley within minutes, Sherlock still unconscious in the care of two of the paramedics, John being guided by the third an Lestrade behind them. There were flashing blue lights everywhere, and John felt very disorientated as he struggled to register what was happening around him. More people were poking at him, shining lights into his eyes and talking words at him that John could not hear. There was a ringing in his ears. His chest felt tight as he felt the others surround him, invading any and every space that John considered his personal bubble. It was getting harder to breathe. There were too many people. It was too loud. Where was Sherlock?
Sherlock considered her words. How had he missed what was now so obvious. He couldn’t live without John, and John clearly couldn’t live without him. So the best friends were stuck with each other, for now at least.  Sherlock reclaimed his hands from Mrs Hudson’s grasp and wiped the remaining tears from his face. He glanced over to the older woman sat opposite him and flashed her a cheeky smirk.
“We got married in September, which was our favourite month. When I say it was our favourite I mean that it was John’s favourite and therefore mine by proxy because I believe favourites to be a pointless construct.”
“I kept you where you were so you wouldn’t see me hit the ground. Naturally the necessary precautions were taken, and were removed when one of my homeless network knocked you over to distract you.”
“Hmm?” Her head angled towards him, questioning, but her eyes were still locked on the device in her hands.
These thoughts, just remembering gave John the determination to endure everything that was thrown at him.
"Elizabeth is one of our new members of the forensics team. She's sharp, and considering Sherlock's dictations on who I should and shouldn't bring, I thought she could lead the team today."
"Oh, God." There was moisture in his eyes and he did nothing to prevent the tears from spilling over. His knees gave way as he dropped to the floor, hands still clasping John's desperately.
On the night where he’d run out on John, after having remembered the waltz that he had apparently written for John and Mary for their wedding. The pain had been god-awful – it felt like someone was using a blunt axe in a vain attempt of slicing his head open. He’d needed something – anything – to distract him from this torturous pain.
"Not my problem, you're not real." He needed to keep repeating it, almost as if confirming it to himself. The thought was ridiculous. Sherlock was the most intelligent person he knew (except Mycroft, but Sherlock was never going to admit that out loud), and he was well aware that the image of John in front of him was simply that, an image. But that didn't stop the tiny glimmer of hope from planting itself inside Sherlock's mind, and everyday he woke up hope against all hope that today would be the day that John was no longer just a hallucination.
It began like many of their adventures, with a request from Lestrade to get to Scotland Yard as soon as possible.
Greg left them to see themselves out, probably to go and begin smoothing the feather, or however he had put it.
Hey guys! Sorry it's been a while since my last post! Writer's block again! Anyways, the chapters just seem to be getting longer and longer, like this story! I never even thought I'd be able to write 2 chapters, let alone 7! Thank you all so much for sticking with me and I really hope you like reading my story as much as I enjoy writing it xxx
John lowered his gun, quickly emptying it of bullets and placing it on the ground before making his way over to Sherlock. The man was shaking, eyes hollow and staring at nothing. John wasn't surprised, Sherlock had just shot a man, it was only logical for him to go into shock.
Mrs Hudson was hyper-aware of the man stood next to her, sensing that he did not want to talk. He had not wanted to talk sine the day the stone was put in place. He seemed entirely focused on the words that were now immortal. Soldier, Doctor, Friend. But he had been so much more to Sherlock. There was not a name for what had happened between them, but friend just did not seem to cover it. Sherlock's face was not schooled into an expression of indifference, as it so often was. It looked entirely full of... nothingness. That was the only word she could produce to describe it. His eyes were empty, as if he was staring straight through the gravestone. But there were small creases by his eyes, which Mrs Hudson knew was a sign that Sherlock was desperately trying to hold back tears.
Sherlock's changeable eyes met Lestrade's hazel ones. He gave Sherlock a weak smile, before giving Sherlock's shoulder, what he assumed was supposed to be a reassuring squeeze. He removed his hand and made his way slowly up the stairs to 221B, leaving Sherlock still stood at the bottom of the stairs.
On the second day, Mycroft had paid his younger brother a visit. Mary had gone to work, but John had phoned in and taken time off under exceptional circumstances. He left the room, to give Mycroft some privacy with Sherlock. John had never seen Mycroft look so worried before. It was almost as if he were human. But John did not acknowledge this. Instead, he let Mycroft spend however long he needed with Sherlock. After about an hour, Mycroft emerged. He still looked worried, but less so than when he had entered the room. For strange reasons unknown to John, seeing Mycroft look less worried actually calmed him. It was probably because if anyone were to find a fault with anything, it would be Mycroft. So, either there really was nothing to worry about, or Mycroft was keeping the truth from John. He settled with the former, not wishing to contemplate what Mycroft cold be keeping from him. John had resumed his place in his chair and continued to watch.
John felt his heart racing, and suddenly his throat felt dry. He knew that Mycroft would never phone John in favour of Sherlock unless something had happened to the youngest Holmes. Even Lestrade's eyes grew wide at the mention of Mr Government.
“What for? You did nothing wrong, you behaved like any rational human being would. I’m the one who’s leaving temporarily, not you. I’m the one who’s going off the rails, not you. You’re the one who still takes care of me despite all of this.” He pulled back slightly to see her face.
He just sat there for hours, watching Sherlock. John was just about to drift off to sleep – for he had slept very little over the past days – when he heard the quiet moan and the rustle of movement coming from the direction of the bed.
Still, even a man of John's strength and stamina couldn't help but begin to crack under the pressure of the constant abuse. And every time, John got a little bit closer to giving up.
Mrs Hudson cleared her throat timidly. Three pairs of eyes locked on her. “I think I should be off now.”
There was a stunned silence. Sherlock’s full attention was now turned towards John, still holding the ring at his eye level. “I said that?”
“So, why haven’t you been here? You’re just as qualified to take care of me as any of the imbeciles at the hospital that put on a coat and call themselves a doctor.” Mary laughed. John was very fond of her laugh, and he made a special effort to make her laugh just to hear it.
For a while, Sherlock just stood there staring at the gravestone, obviously trying to hold back his tears. But then Sherlock did something that completely broke John's heart. He knelt down in front of the grave, leaned forwards and pressed his lips to the head of the stone.
It was loud there, and very crowded. Obviously there was an important match on that John was unaware of. He was just about to turn around and try his luck elsewhere when he heard a familiar voice over the rabble of the crowd.
He went through the process of masking tea, a routine he was alarmingly familiar with. He watched as the tea leaves dyes the boiling water, the swirling patterns in the cup closely resembling the patterns of the steam that was rising from the hot liquid. He made two cups, a subconscious decision, but probably a good one. He splashed milk in both and added sugar to Sherlock's. Sherlock had a secret sweet-tooth but he would never admit it, not even on his death bed. The teasing from Mycroft would be relentless. With a mug in each hand, and using the warmth that permeated throughout his body from the objects in his palms, he returned from the kitchen counter to the table. It was only when he leaned over to place Sherlock's mug in front of him that he noticed the state the detective was in.
"Making things up? Me?" Sherlock put on an over-exaggerated expression of shock, even bringing a hand up to his chest and contorted his face into an affronted expression. "Why on earth would I do that?"
"That's not the point, Sherlock." John pinched the bridge of his nose, as he would have done if he. Was irritated when he was alive. He let out a long, heavy sigh before promptly changing the subject. "So... Molly. Are you two..?" A sly, curious smile graced his features and he sat more forward in his chair, leaning towards Sherlock.
John stayed with Sherlock until he had exhausted himself with his emotional outburst. And even afterwards, not wanting to leave his friend's side. He tucked Sherlock into bed and made sure the detective was fully asleep before turning off the lights ad laving him to rest. He phoned Mary and explained the situation in full. It had been difficult to talk about, considering how closely it resembled their own lives, and his voice caught more than a few times. Even Mary was shocked, and there wasn't much that could shock her - if her reaction to Sherlock's return was anything to go by.
Logically, it should be easy. After all, it's only seventeen steps that Sherlock needs to take to reach 221B. But he simply couldn't.
“No, I don’t want to bother you boys. You’re probably very busy saving the people of London.” She smiled sweetly and sincerely at John. She truly was fond of the man. He was good for her Sherlock.
“No, I faked my death to save you. They’re two very different things, John.” John let out a short laugh. “Honestly John, how on Earth are you a doctor if you can’t distinguish between a fake death and a real one?”
The fact that Mycroft obviously had surveillance on the flat should have made John uncomfortable, but he had always suspected something.
The word was screaming in John’s head, whirling around, removing every other thought it was possible to possess and replacing it with that one word.
“Well, so would you if you were ridiculed for years, died to save lives – well, faked death, and then when you came back, people were still doubting and ridiculing. Please don’t try to understand or sympathise Mycroft because I don’t think it’s a talent of yours.” John didn’t mean to speak so harshly, but he had been holding back a lot of irritation and anger towards the Met, especially Donovan, Anderson and even Lestrade. He didn’t like the way Mycroft was talking about Sherlock, and everything just seemed to spill over.
“Shut up you git.” John shoved Sherlock playfully, still ginning at him, before turning to leave. He was halfway up the stairs before Sherlock called to him.
So, she'd heard rather a lot. But she didn't look at him with pity, or fear, as one would assume someone would if they'd just walked in on you talking to a hallucination of your dead friend. She just looked sad, and if Sherlock had been paying attention, he would have seen the underlying guilt that shadowed her face.
Sherlock had spent most of his days locked in the large manor house that belonged to his parents. They never had much time for him, only concerned with their own affairs. But to ensure that Sherlock never got into trouble they would keep the doors shut, and the windows open only slightly, although not enough for a young, deprived boy to make his escape. That’s how everything began for Sherlock Holmes, stuck in the same manor house everyday. He had no-one, nothing, and usually that would drive a person to insanity, but not Sherlock. He spent his days looking at things, observing, guessing, deducing. And young Sherlock found that the longer he spent looking and observing, the more he learnt. He learnt that the ugly vase atop the mantle in his parents’ room had once belonged to his great-grandmother by looking at the painting technique and the paint used. He deduced that she must have left it to his mother shortly before she passed away. And so he went on like this. He deduced that whole house, until the time finally came for him to go to school. At the age of 6, the customary age for a Holmes to begin his education – away from home so their parents didn’t have to involve themselves with the trivial affairs of their children’s education.
John looked Sherlock straight in the eyes. “Absolutely eradicated. After what happened to the both of us, I don’t think you’d be as stupid as to leave again.”
And just as John was sure Sherlock was about to unleash his deductions upon her, Sherlock said something rather unexpected.
"It was the only way, John." He mumbled quietly, voice barely carrying on the wind." If we incarcerated him he would have only escaped, he would have always been a threat to us. This is the only way to ensure we're safe."
“I can’t, sweetheart. I have to be at the surgery tomorrow, and someone has to cover until our best doctor returns.” She winked at him, and John couldn’t help but smile as he folded his arms around her. After a few moments, Mary pulled back to look up at her husband. “If anything happens, call me, okay?”
"Sounds like me." He laughed lightly. Mary joined in. John kissed her hand, which he was still holding.
“Will he ever be able to? Remember us that is,” John reclaimed Mary’s hand, looking back at the consultant. John was of course, a fully competent doctor, but he’d rather hear it from someone else than just rely on his own knowledge in this case.
John was careful to stop after only two. He wanted to take the edge off, but if he was going to go back and face Sherlock after what had happened, then he'd rather his head were clear. Sherlock might have post-traumatic retrograde amnesia, but that did not stop him being Sherlock. And being Sherlock meant cutting, sarcastic remarks, insults of his intelligence, yet more deductions and just generally being a git. God, the man had lost five years but couldn't lose that bloody arrogance.
We are working on the situation Miss Hooper. I assure you he will return as soon as he has completed his task. - MH
Sherlock stood by John’s side at the altar, as he married Mary, as they became Dr and Mrs Watson. He tried not to imagine himself in Mary’s place, repeating the vows back to John, promising to love and cherish him for the rest of his life. He cast his eyes towards the floor as John recited his vows, and tried not to imagine that John was speaking these words to him. He tried to ignore the pain in his chest that felt like his heart was shattering like glass into thousands of tiny pieces that were cutting up his insides. He tried to look happy for the newly married couple.
He was so busy concentrating on pushing even more clothes into the already full bag, that John didn't hear the tell-tale creak of the 5th stair, which signalled someone's ascent to his room. Neither did he hear the door swing open, or the familiar footsteps enter his room.
Mycroft's indifference. Molly's determination to make sure he's okay, and the guilt he'd seen lurking in her eyes. The suddeness of John's depression and suicidal thoughts. The man lying in front of him, broken and bruised.
“I’m not quite sure I understand.” He voice was quiet, yet the confusion was easy to pick out. Sherlock sighed and walked calmly towards her. When he was right next to where she was sat, he leaned back against the counter and folded his arms.
“You have to wake up Sherlock. I know you will. I bet your big, clever brain’s trying to break out right now, isn’t it?” She smiled at him fondly, before her face fell into an expression of – what John could only describe as - heartbrokenness. “Please Sherlock, for John.”
Of all the hateful fantasies his mind had conjured of John, this was the worst. He'd seen John alive, happy, smiling. He'd talked to him, laughed with him, argued with him, everything they'd done together when John actually was alive. He'd seen John dead, his corpse spread out on a concrete pavement. But not this. Never had his mind been so cruel.
Mycroft arrived at Bart's before John had, setting everything up for his stay. It would be at leas two weeks, if he survived. He stood outside the operating theatre, pacing backwards and forwards, anxiety flooding through him.
He felt a small pressure or his shoulder, and looked up. Molly Hooper had placed her rather small hand on his broad shoulders. Her eyes met John, only a few inches shorter than him.
"Uh uh, Johnny-boy. This is between me and your precious detective." He sauntered back to Sherlock, once again invading his space as he leaned up to whisper in his ear. "Here we go again Sherlock, surely you don't need it explained."
John couldn't help but feel a surge of pride at Sherlock's reply. A few years ago, he probably would have given a completely different reply. Moriarty took a step back at Sherlock's words, surprised leaked onto his face momentarily, a crack in the carefully maintained mask that not even John missed. But the crack was soon fixed, and his look of indifference and boredom returned.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was breathy and desperate, as if this name was the most singular most important name in existence, which of course it was because it belonged to John.
“I am perfectly aware of who he is Mycroft, you informed me about him on our way here. Army Doctor who fought in Afghanistan, but was invalided home after he was shot in the left shoulder, causing a psychosomatic limp and he had to walk with a cane. Has an alcoholic sister. He has a blog on which he writes the goings on of our ‘adventures’ as you so aptly called them. Did I forget anything, brother dear?” Sherlock’s deep baritone voice seemed to reverberate around the entire flat. Oh, how John had missed it. He’d missed the way Sherlock emphasized certain words, how his voice seemed to just ooze sarcasm and sass, especially when the words were directed at his brother, and especially when he said the word ‘forget’. But most of all, John had missed the way the words seemed to drip from Sherlock’s mouth slowly, as if they were made of syrup or honey. Another smile flickered across John’s face.
She placed the cups of tea on the kitchen table and sat down. Sherlock walked into the kitchen and sat opposite her. He held his head in his hands closed his eyes. Mrs Hudson couldn’t bear to see him like this. She had to say something.
“It’s okay Detective Inspector,” granting him with the full use of his title. John straightened himself up, put his hands – still folded – on the desk in front of him and leaned forwards towards the crowd of people sat in front of him. “I’ve seen a lot of death, Mr Wright. It’s unavoidable as a soldier as I’m sure you’re all aware. I’ve never truly been affected by death. Until I saw Sherlock fall. As to how that made me feel – well, imagine it was your flatmate, your best friend jumping from that building, and you couldn’t do anything about it. It hurts. It eats away at your stomach, your lungs, your heart. Your body feels like it’s simultaneously covered in fire and ice. You want desperately to scream, to cry, and to break everything in reach. And sometimes you do. The air is forced from your lungs, and no matter how hard you try, you can never refill them. And every time you seem to get one step closer to getting over it, your mind will replay it for you, because seeing it just once isn’t enough. It plagues you, during your sleeping and waking hours. It never leaves; you’ll always end up back at square one. I had no one after Sherlock left. No one. So I had to sit in the flat, and let my mind, my own mind, torture me endlessly. And yet I still held on to the foolish hope that I’d see him again one day. There were times when I couldn’t wait-”
John turned to him and held Sherlock’s intense gaze. He could hear John’s date descend to the hallway below, leaving Sherlock and John alone in the flat momentarily. Sherlock began to move towards John in measured, deliberate steps. HE came as close as he’s dared get to John without risking giving away his newly discovered affection for the man. John continued to maintain eye contact with Sherlock, leaning his head back slightly to cope with the height difference. Sherlock’s heart must have been beating at twice its usual rate and Sherlock felt sure John must have been able to hear it.
He didn't have to wait long. Footsteps could be heard coming up the stairs to 221b. Mrs Hudson was shouting up the stairs behind the stranger, who was closing in on the door. John didn't dare move. He listened to Mrs Hudson.
Moriarty snapped his fiery gaze to John and moved towards him. In one swift movement Moriarty raised his hand a delivered a viscous backhand to John's face. Sherlock audibly gasped and took a step forward, but a raised hand from Moriarty was enough to stop him.
“Sherlock, I’m serious. You were right, I didn’t understand. All I knew was how much it had hurt me, I never even stopped to think about how much it would have hurt you too. Molly told me, about the shaking, and how your voice trembled when you spoke. Molly said you were a complete state.”
John woke up to the smell of something, toast. He woke up with one side of his face pressed against a cushion that someone had obviously moved under his head. He was laid across the sofa, still fully dressed, apart form his shoes which had been removed and were lying next to the sofa, and he was covered with a fluffy blanket. Typical of Mary Watson. Even after they had rowed and even though she was still obviously still making sure John was okay, making sure he had everything he needed. John had not spent the night on the sofa because Mary was angry at him. He had spent the night on the sofa because Mary knew how tired he was and that he needed the rest. She made him comfortable, but made no effort to move him as he rested peacefully in their front room.
“Come on John,” said Sherlock, still chucking with his deep laugh, almost like a cat’s purr, “let’s go home.”
The question took him quite by surprise. “No. No I was not.” There was a flurry of paper as everyone wrote down his words. Another person, an older gentleman stood up to his left.
There are few times in life when one Holmes brother will ask the other for their help. The incident regarding the missing politician, a Mr Lawson, was one of them. John was still seething over Mycroft interrupting their evening with Mrs Hudson, but he trusted Sherlock and knew that he would not have accepted the case if it were not highly important, or interesting.
Relief - sweet, blessed relief - washed over Mycroft. He left out a sigh. It felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
Hey guys, sorry about the wait between updates. Life seems to be getting in the way at the moment, and I feel like I'm losing the motivation to keep writing - hence why this fic probably isn't as well written as some of my others. Stay with me, I know where I want to go with this fic, but it might take me longer than usual to get me there.
“Goodnight, John.” He didn’t give John a chance to reply before he was playing the violin again. John made his way up the remainder of the stairs and into his room. He didn’t even bother to get changed before he collapsed onto his bed, fully clothed and fell asleep. For the first time since Sherlock’s return, he didn’t dream, his mind completely blank as his body rested.
John smiled. And with that simple message, John felt like he had a little more strength as he headed back to his old flat to attempt what seemed like an impossible task.
“Steven Shaw…” and it went on like this for what felt like hours. Everyone asking Sherlock and John a constant stream of questions. The barely had time to take breath before the next one was unloaded on them.
It took several hours of silence before Mary drifted off to sleep. John was never asked to leave – he suspect’s Mycroft’s involvement.
“It’s nice to have a reason to smile,” John confessed to her. He felt completely at ease with her, and that he could tell her anything. She seemed to take care of Sherlock and himself better then they did. A sudden idea struck him.
“Why? You’ll leave, and you’re supposed to be helping me.” The tone of Sherlock’s voice was accusing, as if he were trying to guilt John into staying. “I thought you’re supposed to be my friend.”
Sherlock knew that Mary suspected him. She obviously realized that Sherlock loved John, but Sherlock was determined to ignore this. So, apparently, was John, who chose to believe that Sherlock was simply in denial about them losing their close friendship. John had tried to reassure him of this on the case of ‘The Bloody Guardsman’, but Sherlock couldn’t stand to listen to John, who obviously didn’t actually realize what Sherlock was experiencing. At least that conversation Sherlock could walk away from, so he did exactly that. The topic was never brought up again.
They were well beyond the boundaries of being just ‘flat mates’. Indeed, Sherlock would now label John as a friend – the best and only friend Sherlock had. Sherlock Holmes had a friend. One that did not shy away from his social abnormalities or the body parts in the fridge and the experiments in the kitchen, no. John would never do that, because he was Sherlock’s friend. And God, did it make him sound like a silly, over hormonal teenage girl, but Sherlock found himself incredibly happy and proud that he had managed to gain what had always out of reach. And apparently, this was registering outside as well.
Sherlock complied, peeling his eyes open slowly, allowing himself to adjust to the harsh sunlight that was streaming through the windows. Of course it would be sunny today. Pathetic fallacy was an occurrence only found in romantic literature, not in the life of Sherlock Holmes.
"You're making that up. There is no way that's true." John wiped tears of mirth from his eyes, stopping his laughter enough to catch his breath.
There was a small pricking sensation in John's neck where the hypodermic needle pushed a strong sedative into his system. John immediately felt dizzy, his muscles losing their strength and his eyes drooping with the sudden weariness that overtook John's body.
John let out a huff of laughter, and finally turned back to Sherlock. A small, yet genuine smile was teasing the edges of John's mouth, and his eyes seemed to regain some of the life that had been missing from them since Mary's death.
"John, no!" That was not a viable option. It never had been, and never will be, ever since the moment they met. Sherlock took the falls, not John - infinitely kind, selfless, brave John Watson.
Sherlock decided. And it might pain him to do this, and it may very well end his friendship with John for good, but it was necessary.
This time was only for a basic once over after their encounter on the roof. John was quite content to sit there and let the nurses fuss. The reason being that, even if he closed his eyes, Sherlock made his presence known to everyone in the room and most importantly to John, reassuring him that he was okay, despite the fact he was sat not three meters away on the examination table in the next room threatening to have Mycroft have their medical licences revoked due to their incompetence. God, the man was such a Drama queen. If anything, the showdown on the rooftop just proved this.
When he entered 221B, Sherlock was curled up in a tight ball on the sofa, surrounded by photographs. His eyes were red from the tears he was still shedding. He wasn't just crying, he was silently sobbing, his chest was heaving as he was trying to breathe, but he obviously couldn't control his tears.
“Please don’t bother John. I don’t care for your pity.” Sherlock pulled his hands out of John’s grasp as if he suddenly realized what he was doing, leaving John stunned and a little hurt. Sherlock straightened up and his face was slipping into the blank mask Sherlock used to cover his real emotions. He was once again becoming the high-functioning sociopath he believe himself to be, shutting the world out and leaving him to the mercy of his torturing and dangerous thoughts.
"The blood, John. Only a pool of blood around his head where he fell. Completely out of the ordinary for that particular wound. There should have been blood spatter and grey matter. I myself should have been covered, considering the proxemics at the time of the shot. Moriarty must have had access to something that could fake a gunshot wound to the head convincingly enough that I couldn't question it. Also, where was the body?"
“Doctor Watson, my deepest condolences. I am truly sorry to learn about Mary. I just wanted to notify you that I have found my brother, and he’s currently staying with me for a while. There is no reason to worry about him, he is more or less safe. You need to be with Mary. I have given instructions to the staff at the hospital not to remove you, so feel free to stay as long as you need to. Once again, my deepest condolences. Of all the people in the world, you two deserve it the least.” End of message.
John hadn’t told Mary about the last time he saw Sherlock. In all honesty, he was ashamed of himself. He knew he had a temper, and that it could get quite nasty sometimes, but what he said to Sherlock was just cruel. He didn’t want Mary to think badly of him – not when their time was so limited. It made sitting in the same room as him increasingly awkward.
John said nothing, he just sat himself down on the opposite end of the sofa, picking up some of the photographs so he didn't damage any of them as he sat down. His eyes scanned the pictures in his hands. One was of Sherlock and a woman John didn't know sitting very lose together at table of a quaint looking restaurant. The girl and Sherlock's faces were pressed together. She was incredibly pretty. Her eyes were a sparkling emerald colour that shone out of her face. Her skin was pale and covered with freckles, framed by her long, sleek, slightly wavy, dark brown hair. They both looked incredibly young, no more than their early twenties. Sherlock's hair was slightly longer, but just as dark, and just as curly. Most importantly in this photograph, is that Sherlock looked the happiest John had ever seen him.
The shot momentarily stunned Moriarty, but Sherlock had been anticipating it quickly used this advantage to snatch the remaining gun and turn it on Moriarty. John also turned his gun on Moriarty.
Sherlock’s heart jumped, and his head snapped to the person beside him. Molly didn’t turn, refusing to meet his eye, but well aware of his intense gaze upon her. Once upon a time, this would have intimidated Molly, but not anymore.
“You know exactly what I mean, Sherlock.” John had gone from caring doctor and flatmate, to commanding soldier within a matter of seconds. This was one of the many things about John that fascinated Sherlock. How easily he could abandon one persona for another, as if he was shedding his skin in favour of a new one. This often happened during a chase, when one or both of their lives were in danger.
“Sherlock told me you were having a hard time adjusting. I wouldn’t bother lying to me John because Sherlock told me that himself and that man knows everything.”
But with his eyes closed, all he could see was John on the rooftop, hear John's voice as they spoke on the phone.
"Jesus Sherlock, watch it!" Sherlock ignored this and grabbed John's arm, looking at him straight in the eye, as if what he had to say was the most important thing in existence.
Holmes reunited with Watson, the detective and his blogger. Greg smiled and the world seemed to right itself. It was still a pretty messed up situation, and not one he would ever have included himself in willingly, but something about seeing both Sherlock and John together again seemed to make all of that irrelevant.
“Sherlock,” she started, her voice soft. “Sherlock, think about it. Without you, John would still be using that bloody cane to walk everywhere with. You made him realise he didn’t need it and eradicated the pain his mind was giving him, tell me that’s not a good thing.”
Here, Sherlock was stuck. Why did he and John do that? Ever since they first met, they’d constantly saved each other, but why? The first time John saved him, he didn’t owe Sherlock anything. So, why did John do it?
From that moment, the imaginary John had accompanied him everywhere, even to the grave where the real John rested, buried deep I'm the Earth. The only times imaginary John left him were when there were other people present. Sherlock had a tendency to speak out loud to the hallucination, but would still prefer not to do so in other company. Just because Sherlock himself knew he was mad, did not mean he was keen on the idea of everyone else knowing.
They were going to Bart's, Molly was clearly shocked, that was all he could read from the situation.
Upstairs, Sherlock was pacing up and down. He’d got changed as soon as Mrs Hudson had reached the botoom of the stairs. He had hated that disguise, it was too uncomfortable, too… not him. He was now in a plain pair of pyjama bottoms, a white t-shirt and his favourite blue dressing-gown.
Neither John or Mycroft had actually let the hospital since Sherlock was admitted after his encounter with Moriarty. John was incredibly grateful to the eldest Holmes brother. Mycroft had sorted out all of the paperwork and had spoken to all of the doctors and consultants regarding Sherlock, whilst John stayed with Sherlock to make sure he did not do anything stupid. It was the most logical arrangement. Sherlock was most likely to listen to John and Mycroft was the most likely to have an influence over how long Sherlock was required to be kept in for observation. Having the British government as your older brother certainly was useful sometimes, and although Sherlock would never admit it out loud, John knew that he was grateful that Mycroft was here.
“You John.” John stared at his flat mate. He was totally confused. What Sherlock was saying didn’t make any sense.
“We got married in Mycroft’s office, and just to annoy him we’d hired this rock band to play. It was hilarious watching his face when we showed them in. It was a perfect day. After we married, we moved into our own apartment on Baker Street.”
deduction.” John’s voice could not have sounded more cutting and sarcastic even if he tried. It was possible, that he had just reached passed the level of sarcasm that Sherlock often used. “Bloody
I'm trying, Molly. No-one wishes for my brothers happiness more than I. Please understand. It'll only take a little while longer. - MH
They swirled around the flat in movements that surely must have been choreographed. The way the particles moved around each other, so intricate and delicate, reminded John of how he and Sherlock used to be. They were so in sync, always. John always knew how he needed to be around Sherlock - when his inputs and opinions were appreciated and when they were not, when he needed to ground Sherlock with a hand on his shoulder before his thoughts became too much, or even when Sherlock needed space to think and John left him alone. In return, Sherlock had understood when John needed him to shut up, or when he didn’t, he knew exactly what needed saying, he’d known when to keep John close on a case, and had never purposefully walked him into the path of danger. On the few occasions that this had happened, Sherlock had always claimed that it was completely accidental. Most of the time, John believed him, but there was something about Sherlock that John knew attracted him to high-danger situations – the thrill of the chase, as he had once put it.
There would be awkward conversations to come, Greg was sure of it, but overall he knew that John and Sherlock would be happy to see each other again. Well, as happy as you could get in the situation.
When Sherlock had asked John what had gone wrong – fully suspecting that the girl had revealed her plans - the army doctor simply smiled ruefully and answered, “she wasn’t the girl for me.” He gazed at Sherlock with the same intensity as before, and Sherlock felt the familiar fluttering sensation as his grey eyes locked with John’s dark blue ones. John seemed to unconsciously make his way towards Sherlock, still in his chair. Holding the daze, John’s face only a few inches form Sherlock’s, he continued, “Besides, I was much too distracted thinking about something else.”
,” Greg snarled, a dark shadow crossing his features. “You let us grieve. You knew this whole time and you didn’t tell us.”
"He's alive and now conscious" Mycroft amended quickly. He's currently in Charing Cross hospital and demanding your presence."
Sherlock left the lab swiftly after his conversation with Molly. Her explanation of Moriarty and, what she’d named ‘The Fall’, were surprisingly quick and to the point, cutting down the time he actually had to spend listening to her. It seemed that she’d finally picked up the hints that he simply wasn’t interested and only kept her around because she was useful to gain access where Bart’s wouldn’t normally allow him.
Christ, no wonder the man turned to drugs. They were incredibly lucky that Sherlock was even alive. John had seen a tiny glimpse of the pain that Sherlock had experienced, and it had been enough to drive a man mad. In his position, John didn't know what he would have done, and he hoped that he would never have to find out. The thought of losing Mary, of losing their baby, it was too much, and prompted another phone call to his wife to remind of how much he loved her, loved them both.
John got out and straightened up. The rain had gotten a lot heavier during his brief time in the expensive black car. He walked up to the front door, already soaking. He heard the slam of the door behind him and he turned around and saw that his groceries were no longer in his field of view. He turned back to the house and knocked on the door. The impressive golden lettering against the dark wood of the door reminded him of Baker Street, and increased his desire to get back there as soon as possible. He’d left Sherlock to his own devices, and John had a uncomfortable feeling that it would involve an experiment that had the potential to burn the flat down.
A flash of yellow passed through Sherlock’s mind and he could see John’s face swimming in front of hi. His face was angled up, and Sherlock vaguely recognized that he was looking down at John as he was stood.
Sherlock’s hand was pressed painfully against his forehead. John moved forward and removed the violin form his grasp before he dropped that too. As soon as his hand was empty, Sherlock moved it to his head, ramming the base of his hands into his eye sockets. His breathing became quicker, and John feared that he was about to begin to hyperventilate. but before John could reach out to sit him down, Sherlock let out a furious groan, that was so full of rage that John took another step back. His eyes snapped back open.
The taxi ride from The Yard to Baker Street was spent in absolute silence, not that John minded; he was still trying to process the events from that afternoon.
As he breathed deeply, he managed to shrug the nurses hold from his arms and shoulders and with a protest of “I’m fine,” straightened his coat and jacket before turning back to the impossible sight of John Watson, alive and breathing on the bed before him. He took the seat next to the bed, continually staring at the face of his best friend. He barley even noticed as the doctor checked over John’s condition, or as one of the nurses cleaned up his knuckles, which was covered in a layer of his own and Mycroft’s blood.
He was reaching the end of his tether. Sherlock clearly did not want to recover from his loss, and Greg could see no way of helping.
“It’s not a bother Mrs Hudson. I want to thank you, really. You’ve been so good to us over that past few months, and… well… you saved my life more than once.” John looked away, a mixture of sheepishness and embarrassment. Mrs Hudson took John’s face in both her hands.
He failed spectacularly. Abandoning all hope of 'Keep Calm And Carry On', John settled for pulling Sherlock back into as he began to sob on his shoulder, too overwhelmed by the emotions coursing through his body to care too much.
, nothing was going to hurt him, but that didn't stop his mind flashing back to his time spent away, to the endless violence he'd endured at the hand of a faceless crony or soldier. He had not been like this immediately after he'd returned. Sherlock blamed the accident. He was sure he'd received some sort if damage that left him emotionally compromised like this.
It took twenty minutes for John to eliminate everyone in the building. Once he was certain there was no one left, John removed his left shoe, taking out the insole to reveal a hollowed out hole with a small mobile phone concealed inside.
And then, Sherlock came up with the perfect solution, one which meant getting it off his chest, whilst never having to voice anything out loud.
They made their way to Lestrade’s office with little hassle, the officers working obviously preoccupied with the case at hand rather than insulting Sherlock. Although, John noticed, there seemed to be rather more officers than usual working at this late hour.
“John,” Sherlock continued, his eyebrows knitted together, “we need to talk about this. We can’t go on like this.” John let out a sigh. He knew that it was inevitable. Hadn’t John’s panic attack proved things had changed? Sherlock may have been the intellectually superior of the two, but John was most definitely not an idiot. Until they cleared the air completely, they could never go back to the way things used to be, no matter how much they tried.
"Yeah, you were. You were the most extraordinary man I've ever met, and also the most human. You called yourself a high-functioning sociopath, but unlike the rest of the world, I could see past that bullshit. You had a heart and you cared for people. You jumped off a building to protect the people you cared for, and then spent two years destroying the network set up by the man who threatened us, and then when you came back…"
Suddenly, Sherlock found himself clutching his head as another colour filled his vision, the headache now worse than it had ever been. He gripped the kitchen counter for support, trying to stay upright.
"Greg, I'm sorry but I have to go. Right now." John grabbed his wallet, threw a couple ten pound notes down on the bar and moved swiftly through the tables harbouring other patrons, leaving behind a confused Greg, until he reached the door.
“Well, you’re wrong. I know Sherlock would never do it.” The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop himself. But he did not make any attempt to take it back. Instead, he stood up and walked straight out of the room. Mycroft didn’t try to stop him. As he crossed the hall, he walked purposefully on the carpet, ignoring the indignant noises being made by the stupid slave of Mycroft’s. He made an extra effort to slam the door on his way out.
She could not stand there and watch Sherlock fall apart slowly. And she knew Sherlock would not wish her to witness it either, preferring to work through his emotional torments alone. As he had once told her: Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.
It had all been going according to plan. Not the official plan carefully devised by Mycroft's team assigned to this particular branch of Moriarty's network, of course, but the plan that John had in his mind and didn't really care if no-one else knew it. John's plan of choice was to barrel into the closely guarded centre of the criminal operation, shoot anyone who got in his way and get the hell out of there, leaving the very often disgruntled and redundant team that John left behind to clean up his mess.
Sherlock's deductions got more and more ridiculous, and John's quiet chuckles soon turned into loud, hysterical laughter which he made no effort to stifle.
"You didn't," Sherlock's head snapped up and his eyes opened, but John didn't meet them, choosing instead to look at his own hands that were sat uselessly in his lap. "You only had the one."
Later, John would reflect that Sherlock was the only thing John had left in his life that he truly valued. But sat in the back of the cab, it was not a time for reflection. It was a time for being in the moment.
She sighed in resignation and turned back to her blood samples. Sherlock walked around the lad a few times, under the pretense of finding something interesting to experiment with, but the whole time he kept his gaze on Molly, still trying to deduce the reason for the change in her behaviour. But try as he might, he could not deduce a single thing, and accepted the fact that it was probably in the locked corridor of his mind palace. After his third loop of the lab, Molly turned back to him, obviously buzzing with frustration that he too was experiencing.
"You really should get out a bit more, Sherlock, and definitely eat  more. I can count your ribs from here."
Sherlock’s stomach rolled once again, and the dizziness returned along with the roaring in his ear and the splitting pain in his head. But this did not drown out the final three words of the man on the screen.
"You've heard me say once before in a court of law that Moriarty isn't a man, he's a spider." Sherlock's voice was low and quiet, causing John to lean in further. Whether the volume and tone was for Mycroft's benefit as he continued the rapid-fire conversation he was involved in, or just so Sherlock could speak to John without anyone overhearing was unknown to John - although he assumed the latter. It was unlikely that Sherlock would do anything for Mycroft's benefit in front of John, despite all the help Mycroft had given them in the past. "It was an accurate description. He sits in the very center of a vast, extortionate, complex web. At the center, he controls every strand. Every pull ensures another death, another heist, torture, weapons trading, human trafficking. Name a crime and Moriarty's involved. He has access to the best resources available to a master criminal, drugs, weapons, people, threats, secrets, experts. I didn't understand, I couldn't comprehend until I left just how large this web is. What I managed to unpick I assume is only a small fraction of this web. From what I can gather from our encounter, he arranged my little 'accident'. I'm sure he didn't specifically intend to cause post-traumatic retrograde amnesia, but he did intend to put me out of the game for a little while. The amnesia was just an added twist to the game, creating a more challenging and more fun puzzle. He's been building something. I don't know what. But one I do know. The game is on, John."
“Doctor Watson?” John managed to force himself to breathe, and pushed the words past his lips, as if on autopilot. Everything seemed to be shutting down.
Sherlock Holmes did not do feelings. He never had done. All his life he’d preferred to keep his emotions tucked away, out of sight, under lock and key. And he’d been successful. So successful that no-one bothered to contradict his self-diagnosis as a high-functioning sociopath. He seemed to fit all the criteria. Only Sherlock was aware that he actually possessed any emotion.
“It will be more than four years. I’ve known him for just over four years, and he has no recollection of who I am.” John did not remember crying again, but he felt Mary wipe away the tears with the cushion of her thumb, stoking along his cheekbones. Her own tears had spilled over, but John could not bring himself to wipe them away. He allowed himself to be entirely selfish for a few moments, before his mind turned back to the situation at hand.
It was John who moved first. He stood up and moved to wards Sherlock, who also got up out of his chair. John pulled his friend into a brief, but tight hug, which Sherlock returned, glad of his friend’s forgiveness. They parted from each other, and stood awkwardly in the living room. They only moved when they heard footsteps coming up the stairs. John glanced up at the clock. 11 o’clock. Mrs Hudson on her way up to check on them both. They grinned at each other before Sherlock resumed his position at the microscope, and John flopped own on the sofa and picked up his laptop. He had a lot to blog about.
Sherlock filed this away in his mind palace for further analysis later. Now was not the time. John had just entered the kitchen, standing in the middle of the doorway.
It was all too much, and Sherlock could tell this conversation was moving into dangerous territory that he was not yet ready to explore. Instead, he chose to move it back to a topic that perhaps he could focus on a little more.
As the doctors and nurses surrounded Sherlock, John got pushed back, away form Sherlock. John could see the panic in the detectives eyes as he began to struggle against the help of the medical team. They tried to hold his arms and legs down to stop the struggling, but no the panic had really set him. John tried to block out the scream terminating from his friend, but he couldn’t, he just couldn’t. He pushed his way through the doctors and nurses, forced them to remove their hands from Sherlock’s body, and took both of Sherlock’s hands in his own. He could hear himself talking but couldn’t recall a word he said.
“It’s nothing.” It took barely any time for John to pack away the groceries. Mrs Hudson had got the vast majority of what they needed the night before, he just got a few more essentials, plus all the ingredients for the night ahead. He left them out on the side as a reminder to Sherlock that Mrs Hudson was coming over tonight.
Sherlock looked back to John, who was staring at him with a pleading expression that closely resembled a small child who wants the last slice of cake.
“You didn’t know her.” John was choking on the words, and, in a different situation, would have been amazed that Sherlock was able to recognise them as words. But the time for being amazed with Sherlock’s ability was definitely not at this moment.
John needed to escape, but something, loyalty or duty, kept him exactly where he was, still keeping a firm grasp on Sherlock’s hands.
Sherlock had not turned from John, who was still standing in the doorway to the kitchen, randomly opening and closing his mouth, but struggling to form words. Every instinct of Sherlock screamed at him to tell John to get on with it, that he had important experiments to be getting on with and really John was just wasting his time now. But he fought against them, determined to be at least a fraction of the good friend that John had been to him. But John shut his mouth, nodded, turned, and promptly walked back up the stairs and returned to his room for another indeterminate period of time. Sherlock listened, and sure enough, John had begun to pace the length of his room again. Back and forth. Back and forth.
"I watched you die, Sherlock!" John nearly roared at the top of his voice. "I watched you fall and die, knowing that there was nothing I could do to save you. I buried you. Sherlock, I buried my friends in the war and I had to do it again, only this time..." His voice cut off.
John found him eventually. No, not found. That would imply that John was looking for him. John stumbled across him in the ‘drug den’ whilst out looking for another person. He was furious with Sherlock, and Sherlock felt shame seep through him for disappointing John, not that he was going to let John know that. So he continued to act aloof and unconcerned with John’s opinion. John was happy now and didn’t need him.
And then came Sherlock’s final sacrifice for the man he loved. Sherlock shot Magnussen. It was the only way to ensure Mary’s safety, and thus the safety of John and their unborn baby. Killing Magnussen was the only solution. So Sherlock gave up everything, his freedom, his entire life to keep John safe once again, and pulled the trigger.
“John,” Mary began, “when you say you lost your temper, what exactly do you mean?” She was pinching the bridge of her nose, eyes closed, clearly trying to keep calm herself.
John snorted. “You truly are an idiot. I was thinking about you, and how much I’d rather be treating you to dinner than her.”
They arrived at New Scotland Yard after a short drive through the light London traffic. There were few people still awake at this hour, which made the journey quick and painless.
"John, do you not think that if my brother wanted to disclose this information to you that you would have already told you?"
"John, judging by your overreaction yesterday, I suggest you take a seat before we continue." Sherlock spoke softly, with a hint of caution. John snapped himself out of his stupor.
He worked tirelessly hard over the next two years dismantling the network that Moriarty had built for himself. There was nothing left of the Sherlock Holmes the world had known. The man in his place was ruthless; his only concern was his survival. But he also felt the ache, the deep, excruciating pain that tore his insides apart. He missed John, his friend, his blogger, his life. Sherlock could never have imagined how much he could feel towards one person, as if the heavens had opened and poured love and passion into his once empty life.
As he was thinking, the kettle began to whistle. He filled the three mugs with hot water and set about making the tea.
Sherlock did not let on how he was truly feeling to John or Mary. After watching them pull away in the cab, he walked back to Baker Street. After giving Mrs Hudson the shock of her life, receiving a very stern lecture and then a tear-filled hug, Sherlock was finally able to take himself up to 221B. It was only after he had closed the door behind him, that he allowed himself to break.
There is a word to describe how John and Sherlock lived in those first few days in the flat. Existing. They did not talk, or eat together, or sit in the same room. In fact, John did not see Sherlock for four days after he returned home, choosing to barricade himself in his bedroom rather than let John try and help him recover. John let Sherlock take his time. He knew that being around new and unknown people for extended periods of time could put Sherlock in a bad mood, but on top of all that, Sherlock was trying to cope with something that John hoped he would never have to, or Mary, or Mycroft, - in fact, anyone he knew. But it was Sherlock, the mad, brilliant, infuriating, captivating man who was struggling against the fog inside his own brain. John would have assumed that Sherlock was scared, but Sherlock Holmes did not do scared.
“The man branded as the ‘Fake Genius’, Sherlock Holmes, who was seen jumping from the rooftop of St Bartholomew’s Hospital earlier this year, has this morning revealed to the world that he is still alive. The man who calls himself ‘the worlds only consulting detective’ attended a press conference this morning to release details about his fake suicide and the reasoning behind it.”
John could see the amount of effort that Sherlock was putting into just one syllable. One of the machines attached to Sherlock began screaming in warning, alerting probably everyone in this private hospital run by Mycroft’s minions
His conversations with John were never one-sided. John always had an opinion, an extra detail to input. Although Sherlock had never told John this, he secretly was glad of these comments. A fresh outlook on a case was always useful, and John’s opinion always mattered to him. He replaced the skull from it’s original position, then leant back into the chair, stretching his legs out, keeping his hands folded over his stomach, eyes closed.
“No, Sherlock. It’s okay. You just have to lie still, it’s okay, you’re here next to me. You don’t need to say anything.” John pressed the button that would call for the nurse.
.” Sherlock’s voice was cutting and sharp, and John felt himself physically flinch away from the deep and dangerous tones lacing themselves through Sherlock’s words. Very much like the man John had first met during the case ‘A Study In Pink’, and the tiny flame of hope that his best friend could still be in there, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Sherlock’s mind palace, was extinguished with those two words.
But Sherlock didn’t believe him. He didn’t think John knew what he was talking about. Sure, John would admit that the idea of being separated would be hard, but Sherlock knew that the problem was a lot bigger, and more complex than that. John would never know, but Sherlock knew.
Honestly, she thought. John was right. Sherlock may have one of the greatest minds the world had ever seen, but he was truly, spectacularly ignorant when it came to some things. She giggles quietly to herself before retiring to her own flat for the rest of the night.
Baker Street is where Sherlock had hidden himself away for the past week. It was a sacred place to him, a place that he hadn’t shared with Jason. Baker Street was for him and John.
“This particular ruffian had been a debt collector, and Sir Boast-A-Lot owed him dearly. Sir Boast-A-Lot had become too boring to bother with, so he needed to change the game up. So, the debt collector staged a small ‘accident’ with the help of a few other robbers and criminals that Sir Boast-A-Lot had encountered. It was quite a nasty knock to his head.” The man on the screen laughed again. It was unnerving.
He ran down the stairs two at a time before skidding into the kitchen. Sitting there, resuming his place at the microscope, was the tall, slim frame of Sherlock. His hair, still black and curly, but longer, bounced as he moved his head to write note in a fresh pad of paper before returning back to his experiment. His hands worked so skilfully, even at such a simple task. He was here. The room already smelled like burning chemicals, mixed with fresh bread which was laid out on the side (presumably by Mrs Hudson). He was wearing his purple shirt which stretched tightly across his chest. His coat and scarf were hanging up behind the door, in their rightful place He was really here, unless, John thought, he was still dreaming. He took his finger and pinched himself hard or his left forearm.
It wasn’t exactly as if someone had switched on a light in John, no. Nothing in the world could restore John’s light at the moment. It had been two weeks since Mary’s funeral, and without her to guide him, Sherlock could see that John was completely lost. He looked like he’d aged at least ten years, and he always seemed so exhausted. After he’d been standing in the doorway for a good few minutes, John opened his mouth, as if to say something.
The flat felt suddenly stifling. Everything reminded him of John, and Molly's accidental slip seemed to trigger this. There was too much John - in the flat, in his mind, everywhere.
"It killed me too. It killed me to do that, Sherlock. It killed me to live without you, to not ever see you again. I nearly died Sherlock, just to end the pain! I wanted to see you again so much I actually swallowed the goddam pills!"
All data from the last 5 years was lost. Everything. It was like someone had boxed up several rooms in his mind palace and moved out permanently. From reading John’s blogs, Sherlock deduced that he’d missed out on some of the most interesting and ridiculous cases he’d ever encountered. Why on earth had he ended up running down an alley in a ninja costume? And there was the Woman – just who was she, and why had she posed such a threat? The Hound – it was intriguing, as he was not often involved with cases of the supernatural, although as it turned out, the was never any supernatural elements involved. And Moriarty. Oh, how Sherlock would have loved to remember him, the most interesting of all cases – the consulting criminal.
Alvarez was sat opposite him at an identical chair, eating some sort of local dish which John didn't recognise. They hardly lavished him with expensive and well made food whilst he was imprisoned.
“It has come to my attention that you and Sherlock have returned to working with the Metropolitan Police Service.”
"I never did believe all the things Anderson and Donovan said about him in the office. I believed that what you wrote on your blog was true. Today I was just doing my job, and by taking what you've written about him, applying myself in a way in which we can all work together. I showed Sherlock I was able minded, but not a threat by telling him what I saw and letting him draw his own conclusions." John stared at her in amazement. Not only had she read his blog, but she'd paid attention to the minor details and extracted useful information to make working with her more easy and bearable for Sherlock.
He got changed and tucked himself into bed. He pulled the covers around himself, cocooning his body in a thick layer of warmth and comfort. His eyes closed and he continued to listen to the music. He drifted quite peacefully off to sleep, and was undisturbed by the usual nightmares, for Sherlock continued to play until he saw the first glimpse of the rising sun from the window.
The first thing John noticed, was that he was no longer in the living room. Or maybe he was never there. He was in his bedroom, lying in bed, sun streaming through the crack in the curtain. Maybe he was simply dreaming that he heard arguing downstairs. He dreamed that Sherlock returned. Yes, that was it. He sat up in his bed and turned, so his legs dangled over the edge before coming to rest on the polished wooden floor. He rested his elbows on his knees and brought his hands up to his face, covering his eyes. He rocked backwards and forwards gently.
He did not hear John curse as he took in the sight of the detective, still leaning over the sink as his body expelled the contents of his stomach.
“I never thought he’d ever leave. I thought we’d stay in that flat for the rest of our lives, or until I found someone worth leaving for, but I knew that was never likely to happen, not with Sherlock being such a huge part of my life. It was either one or the other, and I chose a life Sherlock.”
“John, listen to me. Sherlock needs you. It’s probably a lot harder for him, you know how he works, this will be killing him. All you have to do is offer him help and support. Be his friend, because that what you are and always will be, and one day, he’s going to remember that, and I know that he’ll appreciate that you didn’t abandon him to the care of doctors or even worse-“ Mary paused, “his brother.” John could not help but laugh out loud. He marveled at the amazing woman sat next to him. She always knew exactly what to say, exactly what to do to make John happier, to make him laugh or smile. How had he gotten so lucky?
Sherlock said nothing for few moments, and then looked at John with absolute gratefulness and sincerity that John felt like he could cry.
"Sorry to spoil your plans boys, but I thought I bring along a teammate of my own." John thee his head back in an attempt to break his captor's nose, but the tight grip around his neck only became tighter, momentarily cutting off his air flow before releasing it slightly. The gun was pushed harder into his temples, the pressure an ever present reminder that John was only seconds away from death if Moriarty so chose to do. "Try not to struggle Doctor Watson, Moran tends to get a little trigger happy with the ones who struggle and I do detest cleaning up."
“Only me, love.” She deposited her load onto the kitchen table. “I popped in when you boys were out, and you seemed low on supplies so I thought I’d restock the fridge.”
They continued to stand there in silence, reading and rereading the word that were forever engraved onto the white marble of the gravestone.
A thousand memories coursed through his mind. Walking into St Bart's lab and meeting Sherlock. Running after the cab after their dinner the next evening. Watching Sherlock about to take the pill that could end his life, and then ending that which threatened it. Moriarty in the pool, John telling Sherlock to run, to save himself. Laughing like naughty teenagers in Buckingham Palace, stealing the ash tray. He heard Mycroft's voice.
There was a small intake of breath from both men. But as soon as the words came out of John’s mouth, h knew that it was the truest thing he had ever said.
The conversation between the muffled voices continued for a few minutes longer, during which John could hear Mrs Hudson clearing up the mess that the smashed cup probably made. The deeper voice said something and there was a pause. John waited, not moving, waiting absolutely silently. It could have been seconds, or minutes, or hours, but eventually, Mrs Hudson replied monosyllabically. John could hear the man raise his voice slightly. Obviously this had not been the reply he had expected. Mrs Hudson was quick to retort. John wished he could hear more than just the muffled sounds, he longed to hear the words, to find out who the voice belonged to.
Mrs Hudson found herself chatting away to Sherlock on the sofa. The situation was not unfamiliar to her. She and Sherlock had spent many evenings on one o their sofas with tea in their hands, simply talking. More often than not they had discussed Sherlock's latest case, or her mot recent visit to her sister.
"What happened Sherlock? Tell me exactly what happened that day on the roof. From the beginning, the whole story." John never blinked, and neither did Sherlock. They just stared at each other, taking in every detail. Sherlock noticed that John was thinner, at least 10lbs, unhealthy. The bags under his eyes were noticeably darker, little sleep, probably due to the return of nightmares judging by the state he was in when he walked into the kitchen this morning. War? Could be, more likely it was about Sherlock, considering what he'd just been told. John's hands were shaking, obvious heightened anxiety.
But it was still painful for Sherlock as he and Mrs Hudson approach the elegant black stone which marked where his best friend now resided. There were flowers. Lots of them. Roses (from Mrs Hudson), lilies (from Lestrade), sunflowers (from Molly), carnations (from Sarah). They were laid over the grassy patch which lay before the smooth stone that jutted from the ground at such a harsh angle.
He turned until he was leaning against the wall, and then slid down until he was sat side by side with the world's only Consulting Detective. Gone was the high-functioning sociopath. In his place was a broken man, with eyes so empty it made Greg's heart clench. It was scary to see this man - once so great, quick and aloof - reduced to this. And there was nothing he could do, and that made Greg feel totally useless. He ran his hands through his short, silver hair.
“Of course, Sherlock. John, could you give us a few minutes? Pop the kettle on, maybe? I’m dying for a cup of tea!” She laughed dryly as she realised the wording or her request. John kissed her forehead, and Mary grasped his hand as he got up off of the sofa and moved into the kitchen.
3 hours was a long time for Sherlock Holmes to get himself into trouble. John didn’t like to think about what kinds of trouble, just that trouble was incredibly likely, if not definite.
he had thought. Mary seemed to have been able to read his thoughts, because she’d just smiled weakly and brushed her thumb over his cheeks. Such a gentle action, and yet so full of love, affection, and all the words they had been unable to say to each other.
John sat in the flat. He hadn't moved all morning, and made no plans to. He closed his eyes and just listened to the world. He could hear Mrs Hudson moving downstairs, probably making tea. She moved slowly, more of a shuffle than a walk. He heard her set down something on the table and the scraping of a chair. He heard the cars drive down Baker Street. He heard a group of people outside, meeting for lunch at the café. They were laughing with each other. His jaw tightened and he could feel his teeth grinding together. They had no idea, those people, no idea how lucky they were. There was still happiness in their lives, a ray of light that shone through any darkness that was present. They all still had the chance to be happy.
Sherlock pictured the scene with perfect clarity. The small, unassuming but absolutely beautiful man losing his balance on the ice and falling, Sherlock rushing to catch him but only just missing, their eyes meeting, the immediate connection that Sherlock had felt. The man had golden blonde hair that was gently greying around the temples, the fringe swept across in a slick style that made the man look utterly perfect.
There had surely never been so much ice, or viciousness in an accusation. Mycroft knew that some of his barbs Sherlock and he had exchanged in their verbal duelling matches could have been considered hurtful, but the way his brother regarded him now, was like a physical pain in Mycroft stomach. He had never seen such hatred, for it could not be mistaken. At this moment, Sherlock Holmes hated Mycroft, positively loathed him. He took another deep breath, trying to keep himself calm in the face of his baby brother’s emotional collapse.
Mary smiled a watery smile, and bought John's hands up to envelop them in both of her tiny ones. Her skin was cold, but John resolutely did not care. Mary pressed her lips to their joined hands, and John moved forwards to rest his forehead gently against hers.
They sat for the rest of the evening drinking tea and talking. It was as if nothing had changed, as if Moriarty had never existed, as if Sherlock had never faked his own suicide, and as if John had never tried. They allowed themselves to lull into a relaxed state, laughing as Sherlock made ridiculously extravagant deductions to entertain their guest. He was in the middle of a particularly creative one about a young man passing along under the window, before Mycroft stepped through the door.
“No. Mycroft told me when I was staying with him.” Sherlock’s voice was calm, collected. But John saw a panicked shadow flash across his face. “Huh, some genius you are,” John snarled. “Now,
"Packing." John refused to turn and look at Sherlock. He wanted to leave Baker Street as soon as possible, and he didn't care if it seemed rude to do so.
Sherlock continued to play for only a few hours longer, making absolutely sure that John was asleep before he put down the instrument he loved so dearly. He cherished every note he’d ever played on it, even the clashing chords played only to annoy Mycroft. It helped to organise his thoughts, and he used it instead of the alternatives. Sherlock had resisted the temptations to lapse back into his own habits when he was away from John. Every time he’d opened a packet of cigarettes, he’d thought about how disappointed John would have been with him, and he’d not touched them since. And Mycroft had kept him away from anything stronger for years.
This, combined with the tightening of fingers around his arms seemed to snap Sherlock back from the confines of his mind palace, or wherever it was that his mind had wondered off to. His eyes were wide and scared. His hand covered John's where it sat on his arm, and his white, bony fingers wrapped themselves around John's shorter, more tanned ones.
Sherlock couldn’t remember a time when he had spoken so long. He could feel his voice on its last legs as he concluded his story. He had never moved his eyes from John the entire time, apart from when he told John why he fell. He didn’t want to see the reaction on his face. John’s face looked quizzical, awed, shocked, sad and confused in one expression. Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Amazing?” he breathed, and John could see his eyes moving under their lids, and knew that Sherlock was in his mind palace, trying desperately to seek out the memory of this encounter. Clearly he could find none, because moments later, his eyes snapped open and he deposited the ring back in John’s hands. “Yes, well. That’s not what people usually say.” And with that, he swept out of his chair and towards his bedroom. The door slammed behind him, separating Sherlock from the rest of the world. John and Mycroft made no attempt to follow him. Sherlock need the space and time to himself. His mind palace would be in a state of disarray, and despite how Sherlock treated things on the outside, it distressed him greatly when the inside of his head was untidy and unorganised. Sherlock relied on the organisation of his thoughts far more than anyone knew – anyone other than John and Mycroft. So they left him alone.
John didn’t know how many hours had passed since he returned to Baker Street, he hadn’t even registered that he’d spent the entirety of that time focused on a table and dust. Only when his phone rang did he make an attempt to move. His hands fumbled with the buttons in his attempt to answer the call as quickly as possible. He didn’t check the caller ID as he did so.
Sherlock threw his arms up. Yep, definitely the worlds biggest Drama Queen. John pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to breathe deeply. He'd lost his temper far too many times in a hospital for his liking.
Sherlock’s words were cut short by John’s fist, which had connected with his jaw. There was a satisfying sound of impact as fist met face. Sherlock’s hands flew to his face, and he doubled over, trying to shield the rest of himself from John. John returned his fists to his side and stood there, just watching as Sherlock tended to his injured face. John’s whole body was trembling with the surge of adrenaline that had just rushed through him. He swallowed a few times before he spoke, and when he finally did, his voice was barely more than a whisper.
Sherlock turned towards John and saw him properly for the first time since his apology. He was slouched over, defeated feeling. The bags under his eyes were darker and more noticeable, little or no sleep, increase in the amount of nightmares, despite his return. Gained 4lbs, eating well, he was clearly having a slightly positive effect. Hands were steady, even after his attack, John found Sherlock’s presence calming and his absence terrifying. John’s shirt had traces of toast around the lapel, left over from breakfast this morning. His fingers had the faintest traces of ink, where it had rubbed off when he had was reading the morning paper, only browsing though, too little ink for him to have been properly reading, trying to keep up with the world after 2 months of nothing. Every now and again he would stretch his fingers out, before they curled back towards the centre of his palm. RSI, caused by the amount of typing John had done the other day.
Sherlock had an air of importance about him, after all, these people were here to see him, to listen to him, not to John.
All three men found it extremely dull, and couldn’t wait to get out as soon as was humanly possible without appearing rude. Lestrade made their excuses and they rose from their chairs and exited to room.
“John, don’t sound so surprised. And for goodness sake close your mouth. Not only will you swallow an ungodly amount of flies at this rate, but you’re also starting to look like Anderson as, what you described ‘a lost goldfish’, and I don’t think I could tolerate that.” He said it very quickly, and rather snappishly, but now was not the time to argue with John, Sherlock clearly had a very serious case on his hands.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Lestrade,” scoffed the tall, too-smart-for-his-own-good detective, a disbelieving smirk playing around the corner of his lips.
John's curiosity peaked. He had known Sherlock for close to five years (even though two of those years John had spent convinced that his best friend had been dead), and in that whole time John had never cracked the mystery of where Sherlock went on his Sunday adventures. He approached Mrs Hudson, and asked whether she knew anything about the strange habit of Sherlock's.
3 weeks had been hell on her. She looked so tired and gaunt. She hadn’t been eating too wee, and whatever she did manage to eat was small, hardly anything. Her cheekbones we quickly becoming more prominent than Sherlock’s.
How had Sherlock forgotten? Well, it was simple really. He was so focused on getting the words out and relieving himself of the secret that he neglected to remember that as a soldier, John would have been trained to recognise and communicate in Morse code.
Fair enough, his friend was suffering, but that did not make it okay for him to wake him up at bloody 3am with his violin playing. He thought that he should probably be delighted that Sherlock was showing signs of normal behavior, but all John could feel towards the situation was irritation. Was it too much for him to get a decent amount of sleep? He made his way down the stairs, his annoyance growing with every step he took towards the music. He reached the bottom of the stairs and turned into the living room, about to give Sherlock a piece of his mind.
John's heart was breaking. His world was shattering. His life was falling apart. Every single cliché was happening. Yet more clichés for yet more disaster.
Before Sherlock ‘lost his memory’ – God, how he hated that phrase, surely there was something much more interesting and intellectual then simply loosing one’s memory – Molly, had fussed around Sherlock as a small puppy would with their owner.  She often came across as far too eager and forward, which had put Sherlock off almost immediately. But she was useful. As well as providing him with the lab space, Molly was the only person within the hospital walls who was willing to bend the rules to get Sherlock what he wanted, be it access to the morgue or the odd liver or too.
‘Son, running from your problems is never the answer. You’ve got to face them like a man, and tackle them full-on.’
“I can’t leave him, not now.” His head turned towards his flatmate, still resting on the sofa. “He needs me Mrs Hudson, but I can’t take care of him. All I do is bring pain and difficulty into his life simply by existing. He would have been much better off if he’d never met me." Sherlock couldn’t stop the tears, no matter how much he tried. He wasn’t sobbing, he considered himself above that. He just let the tears slide silently, almost gracefully down his cheeks.
"27, married," John groaned internally, "part of the forensics team going by your overalls, Lestrade's using you as a replacement Anderson today after I refused to work with him," Sherlock noted.
Sherlock turned very slowly towards John, and John was horrified to see tears shining in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock's arms wrapped around his own waist, and his eyes moved to the floor, still refusing to meet John's.
John was still laughing to himself as the BBC news came on. He waited patiently to hear what he’s been waiting for. Sure enough, 15 minutes into the programme, the newsreader began on the story.
John struggled to sit upright, and as soon as he did, immediately pulled the consulting detective to him, hugging him tightly, never wanting to let go. Sherlock too wrapped his arms around John’s middle, being mindful of the bandages and injuries that John had sustained.
“Sherlock said you might find it hard to be here by yourself.” So, that was who he had been texting. “I think you need to come inside.”
Sherlock let John assume that he was apologising for the meltdown. He never told him that he was actually apologising for the hurt and agony that he knew John must have experienced when Sherlock jumped. But Sherlock left John to his assumptions. After all, there was a dangerous game to win.
“But how long, Mary? Because I don’t think I can take anymore!” John too closed his eyes, it allowed him to concentrate, and he could understand why Sherlock did it so much.
All three men watched the CCTV footage on the computer screen. Sherlock leaned in and stared intently, documenting every single detail that was presented to him for further analysis, whilst Mycroft and John leaned over one of his shoulders. At any other time, this would have annoyed Sherlock. He did not tolerate having people looking over his shoulder. Of course, he did it to John, but that was different, John didn't mind and he did. But Sherlock's attention was captivated by the small black and white images dancing across the screen. They watched as an obviously well-to-do man walked down the left side of the street with large, expensive looking houses shadowing him from the sunlight. On the opposite side of the road was a small park. They followed him, jumping from one clip to the next until…
John looked at his hands, once again unable to look into the eyes of his best friend. Why did he always press John like this? John wanted to walk away and drop the subject. But he’d agreed to help Sherlock recover, and if that meant answering every question thrown at him, then John planned to do absolutely that.
Next, John had approached Greg, who had known Sherlock longer than he had, although maybe not better. But it still didn't give him any insight into this odd behavior.
“Oh Sherlock, you daft boy.” It was now Mrs Hudson’s turn to dissolve into tears. Sherlock held her face between his hands and wiped them away gently with his thumb. HE placed a small kiss on her forehead and then released her. She turned away from him and walked out of 221B into the hall.
To forget the threat of (the apparently very much alive) Moriarty. To forget the horrible experience that his best friend had had to endure. To forget that he was now a widow.
She'd had her first fit a few days before, and it was the most terrifying thing John had ever had to encounter – even more paralyzing than when he thought he'd been locked in a lab with an enormous hound.
“Was.” Sherlock corrected. John could feel the tears burning in his eyes at such a simple word. He continued to attempt to make the tea, although his hands were shaking so much that half the contents of the mugs ended up getting splashed of the kitchen side.
The past would always haunt John, he knew and accepted that. But that’s exactly what it was – the past, a mere shadow on John’s existence. For now, John needed to look to the future, and that future was here, in Baker Street, with Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock had gone through just as much as John had, if not more, and yet Sherlock had supported John the entire time.
"We can tell be the length, width and colour of the marks," Liz began, stooping low again to get another look at them, "that Mr Lawson was upright as he struggled, which tells us that he was fully conscious. It's light, his foot barley scraped across the floor in an attempt to stop the ambush. Had he been unconscious, there would have been several heavier marks where they would have had to drag him into the vehicle. The angle at which the mark was made told us they were travelling in this direction," Liz motioned down the street, "at the time of the abduction."
He'd been in a dreamlike state all day. He did not consciously register ever waking up or doing anything that morning. He'd dreamed of John the night before, of his fall - as Sherlock still refused to believe that John had jumped. Reliving what happened usually made Sherlock's state of shock much worse, and that day had been no exception. Imaginary John had tried to get him to talk, as John would have if he were alive.
Mycroft entered just as Sherlock sat. The three men engaged in an awkward silence. It pained John to feel this way, when such easy conversation had always flowed without effort in the four wall of 221B. Now there was an unpleasant tension where there should have been warmth and laughter.
He turned to face her, smile still plastered on his face. “Remind me, why did you marry me?” She chuckled.
“But Mycroft said you were in a ‘delicate situation’ and I know how much it upset you yesterday and I just-”
In essence, Sherlock was exactly the same person. He'd still made the same deductions about John after his return from the hospital, he still insulted people and preened like a peacock. He still dressed in a way that could make any Armani model jealous and even his experiments had gone unchanged. The only difference was that he was five years behind everyone else. If Sherlock had it within his capacity to become his friend four years ago when he'd entered the lab at Bart's with Mike, then surely-
A strong arm gripped him under his shoulder, another encircled his waist and held him upright. John could smell the gunpowder, tea and mint. It could have only been Sherlock. Sure enough, the tall, dark haired detective was helping the doctor to a nearby bench. He sat John down and knelt on the floor in front of him. He took John’s face between his hands and looked at him straight in the eyes.
