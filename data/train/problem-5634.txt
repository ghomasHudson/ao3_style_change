“Must be genetic,” Tony said.
“I’ve never been better,” Tony said, and even though his wrists were sore and he was dehydrated and had to pee at the same time, he was woozy from being knocked out, and chilled to his bones, despite all that, it wasn’t a lie.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” Tony waved everyone off. “You guys go have fun.”
The bad man flew up very high and snuck in through a window, as quiet as a mouse. He found Tony’s bedroom and there he was, deep in a magical sleep, arms folded graceful over his stomach, chest rising and falling evenly. Only True Love’s Kiss would wake him. And that was exactly what the bad man had to offer.
“Do you like me yet?” he asked, only slurring a little this time.
Tony smiles. “I’d like to put on some pants first.”
Tony nodded. "Okay, okay. I get it. I'll do that. Thank you. I love you so much."
Brock took another step backwards, but he shot a look to Justin and they both sneered. “Whatever. I still don’t believe he didn’t have to pay you. Now you’re just, what? His bodyguard? Fucking rich kids.”

“Thanks. We were - I mean we loved each other, but we weren’t soulmates. We knew. Um. I think… she hoped, once she realized how sick she was… that I would -” He cleared his throat.
Steve’s hand snapped up and caught Tony’s wrist before he disappeared completely. “It’s - it’s not Jan,” he confessed, barely more than a whisper. He released Tony’s arm, not able to touch him and voice this at the same time. “It bothered me… but not cause of Jan.”
An hour later, a soft knock on the penthouse door failed to rouse the sleeping Tony. Steve knocked again, louder. Still nothing. He called out, “Tony?” then pushed the door open. They’d had an agreement to spar in the gym, but Tony hadn’t shown.
Tony rolled his eyes and made his way to the elevator. He didn’t know who could be at the door that JARVIS couldn’t take care of himself. When he reached the downstairs delivery door, Tony pulled it open only to be met with quite a sight. A man in the fanciest clothes imaginable stood with a gold platter in hand. On the platter was a crisp white envelope with Tony picked out in shiny, silver pen. The man raised a tiny trumpet to his lips and played a few notes.
Something clanged in the kitchen and then Steve appeared at the end of the couch, rubbing a tea towel over his hands. He looked decidedly unflushed, and the only reason Tony could think of for that was that he didn’t know what Grindr was. Cause there was no way Mr. Nineteen Forties American Virtue was casually throwing around knowledge of gay “dating” sites with such reckless abandon. Was there? Unless - ?
And four, that he wouldn't be a scent match.
“Um. Sure. Same, I guess.” Steve waited until the waiter walked away. “I’m sorry, are you going to call the cops or what?”
“I don’t know,” Steve said quietly. “Since we’ve both beaten everyone else.”
Steve has strong suspicions the puppy won’t be leaving the tower. Tony’s probably already mentally making a pet store shopping list for JARVIS. But the others continue to argue because they don’t know Tony like Steve does. They don’t see the slight twist to his lips and the way he curls his fingers - not into a fist, more like he’s holding some imaginary tool - that say he won’t be backing down for anything.
“See Tony?” Steve said softly, as he reached up to release the cuffs. He drew Tony down onto the bed and pulled him close. “You’re so good for me.”
Tony set up some bags on the drip, ordering the nurses to get him antihistamines and corticosteroids. He turned to go, taking the chart to hand it off to one of the ER doctors, when the man called after him. “Thank you.”
Bucky shot him a halfhearted smile. "Good morning."
Steve nodded. "Yeah. Must be. I mean you're obviously brilliant, and I'm sure you get that a lot, but lots of brilliant people don't do anything with it. To study as hard as you obviously are… that takes a lot of strength."
“Kind of the first game to do that.”  She continues.  Steve just lost his last life “Dammit!”  Natasha tries to interest him in the Top Speed cabinet.
The moon hovers the night sky.  A perfect circle.
Steve babbles, “I’m engaged!  I have a fiancé”.
"Uh-huh?" says a voice coming from the intercom.
Good Luck!
A happy Steve walks out of the New York room and sees a sad Tony sitting in the lounge alone. He walks over, “Hey what’s wrong?” he asks. Tony looks at him with gloomy brown eyes and replies, “I don’t have a bed, so I’m getting to know the couch.” Steve chuckles a bit, then sits next to Tony, “Come on, I have a queen, we can share.” He pulls Tony up and takes him into the New York room. Steve leads him to the bed, “Here, I don’t care what side you sleep on.” “Thanks,” is all Tony can say.
call it dying," Peggy adds.
Natasha- Hero name: Black Widow. Item to sell: Black cat suit.
"A little lively for dead people-" Tony adds.
Tyra: “Have we made a decision?”
"So you gonna wear a dress?" Tony asks.
Just then, Carol appears nearby.  She opens her mouth to speak, but Tony gets the first comment “okay, Carol?  You’re just pestering now.  Do I have to red light you?”  Carol checks her watch “Two hours thirty-five, there’s not much time left.”
“JARVIS I’ll take it from here” Carol interrupts.  “Like I said Steve, Tony always loved you.  Whatever he did, he always had you in mind.”
"She... we both... she had her viewpoint.  There were things she believed, and things she didn't believe in, and this place was one of them.  She wouldn't even visit, take the trail run." Tony is starting to tear up.
On the balcony outside of Tony's bedroom.  The clock reads 11:55p.m.  The décor in Tony's room is slightly different, 2002 style.  There's a poster for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics on the wall.  The bed is in disarray.
Nick: “Because I will be picking the winner. And some of those walks were embarrassing.” Everyone laughs.
It's 1987 on a look out point looking out to San Junipero.  Steve sees a plane fly by, he gets up. He climbs into a black Toyota MR2 and drives it out of the lot.  He slides a cassette into the deck and hits play.  It's Belinda Carlisle,
Upbeat house music begins to play. “Quill you’re first.” Phil commanded. Quill walks out, when he steps into the water, he tries his best not to slip into the rest of the pool. Quill voice over: “I swear it’s not as easy as you think it looks. There is no grip on the runway.” Nebula doesn’t slip but that’s because she’s walking very slowly. Wanda does well as to not slip, but she’s walking way too quickly. *Wanda, 18: “Give me a runway on land and I’ll show you a true Top Model,” she laughs, “but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.” Carol is confident, poses, and once she steps in the water she walks confidently. Halfway through, she slips into the pool, the audience is quiet, she gets up and poses, falls, poses, falls, poses, and just walks out of the pool, falling again. *Carol, 25: “I just said let’s end this bitch with a bang,” she poses, “Voila! I’m out this Bitch.” Steve, Peter, and Clint do well. Tony is hyping himself up, *Tony, 19: “Ya Boy has a fear of pools and large bodies of water, but I am going to rock this.” Tony is clearly a strong runway walker; he successfully poses at the front and end of the runway, fiercely. Natasha also has a fierce runway walk. Hope does well, slips but quickly catches herself. Thor, Shuri, Okoye and Bruce successfully end the show.

“And our guest judge, model turned designer, Erin Wason.”
TV show on it.  He heads for Shield's.  Steve heads into the bar and looks around.  There's no sign of Tony.  He explores the arcade section.  No sign of him there either (or Natasha, come to that).  He checks out the booth area and the dance floor.  Nope.
As Tony turns to the head for the fire escape, the girl turns to the guy.  "Why's he up there anyhow?"  He shrugs a little, "Newbie testing the boundaries.  Dumbasses pull that shit a lot," he nudges her, "Not that I'm against tourist."  The girl giggles.
Hope- Hero Name: The Wasp. Item to sell: Heels
Nick: “A bit of a temper, but good photo.”
"I didn't know" Steve pleads
The models’ jaws drop while the actors do their best to pretend to look shocked. Then Tyra walks out, looking amazing but also very serious. She walks over to the stage.
Steve tries to pull him back, "You can't see it... what she did, it was selfish actually..."
Steve now has a drink, a coke in a glass, and is wandering deeper into the bar, looking around.  Heart and Soul by T’Pau is playing.  He sits down at a table to people-watch.  Sipping his coke, he checks out the comings-and-goings, young couples, preening jocks and cool kids.

Tyra: “Hey You!”
Steve looks up at the night sky, “I’ve never been on a dance floor before.”
"Scheduled to pass... Let's just call it dying." Tony says.
"I only want a moment," Tony says.  Peggy buckles, "You brought your..." she gestures toward tony, "Connector with you?"  Tony nods while taking out the connector out of a bag, "I like to call it a 'beeper'".  They get up and they head out of the cafeteria.  They move to the private room along with Tony's caregiver Rhodey, Peggy heads over to Steve's bed.
Tony is shocked, "He's... He's passing over?"
Picture pops up of Carol as Captain Marvel.
Steve turns towards the exit.
Steve cuts him off, points down at the sidewalk, the people.  "How many of them are dead?  Like what percentage?"
The car has driven to a halt outside Sienna Trust Living.  It's still sunny outside.  Elder Tony is being helped out of the car by Rhodey.  Once inside, they head towards the main seating area.  Rhodey helps to a comfy-looking armchair, Tony starts coughing painfully and deeply.  With Rhodey's assistance he slips on the connector device and sits back in his armchair, coughing once more. "You sure you're alright?" Rhodey asks to reassure Tony.  Tony nods and indicates for Rhodey to hit the button.  He closes his eyes.
“Runner-up for best photo” Tyra pulls out he second photo, “is Okoye.” Okoye walks confidently to Tyra and thanks her. “Clint.” He walks down to grab his photo. “Thor” he walks down to grab his photo, “please be more serious next week.” Thor nods “Congratulations, you’re still in the running towards Becoming America’s Next Top Model.” He walks over to the side where the other models are. “Peter…”
Camera cuts to various contestants’ faces.
Suddenly Tony walks past, he spots something in the distance, rolls his eyes a little, and abruptly sits down beside Steve.  Steve looks at him, a little surprised.  “Go along with whatever I say” Tony says quietly to Steve.  “Sorry?”  “Whatever I say, go along with it” instructs Tony.
She shrugs, "Least I could do, right?"
"When he was 21?" Tony asks in a shocked tone.
Shortly afterwards, Tony emerges from the front of Shield.  Looking for Steve.  He looks around and can't see anything, "Steve?"  He starts heading for the main street to see if he can find him.  All he can see is a couple sitting on the hood of a car, looking up at something high up, behind him, he paces over to them.  "You seen a guy.  Mid twenties, blonde hair, glasses?"  The girl half of the couple just points up behind Tony.  Tony turns.  Standing on the roof of Shield on the very edge, is Steve looking down at the sidewalk.  "Aw geez" Tony tells himself.
Steve, 26: “I got the biggest bed, I think that’s a sign I’m gonna win.”
Tyra walks over to the ‘rejects’ with sadness in her eyes, “I’m so sorry, but we’re not going to give up, right?” The ‘rejects’ all nod. Tyra waves over the finalist, “We have to get this competition started models.” She heads over to the doors of the building and the “finalists” run over and they all head inside. The rejects are all sad and trying to cheer each other up.
“Old times’ sake,” Tony slightly pauses, “I’d figure they were kind of a fashion statement-” “Really?” Steve says shockingly.  “-but then the rest of your outfit is… not”
“Wanda, what’s your hero name?” “Scarlet Witch.” Item to sell: Jacket. Phil is not saying much during the shoot. “Her photos weren’t bad, but they weren’t amazing either.”
Steve leans over and gives him a kiss.  Tony is embarrassed, possibly even annoyed by the vulnerability he's just displayed.  He glances at a clock radio by the bed.  It's 11:59pm.  "Time's nearly up" Tony says.  "Then lets lie here", Steve replies.  They lie, in the dark, without speaking for a full fifteen seconds.
Phil: “Although it’s a good picture, 50% of your shots were in this exact pose.”
Phil: “Adorable face and very likable.”
Carol steps onto set. Phil: “Carol, are you going to make up for the challenge?” “Yes sir.”
Everyone is throughout various parts of the apartment, then the screen turns on. “Tyra Mail!” yells Shuri. They all run in front of the TV.
Sienna Trust Assisted Living.
Rhodey and a gaggle of seniors stand at the side of a grave as a coffin is lowered.
Steve takes a few moments to breathe in and out.  “Fine.  I’ll Listen to you.  But this won’t change my mind about Stark.”
On the balcony, the men sit, Steve is wrapped in a bed sheet, and Tony is wearing Steve's large white shirt and his hair ruffled.  San Junipero can be seen in the distance.  Tony leans over to the side, smoking a cigarette.  Steve breaks the silence, "I can't believe I'm getting married next week."
Moments later, the fire door is flung open as Steve stomps out.  In the middle of the alleyway, he paces in a circle for a moment, upset and uncertain, not knowing what to do.  He spots the fire escape, sneaking up the side of the building.
Clint, 24: *sniffling* “I came over here to be able to give my kids a better opportunity, looks like that’s not going to happen.”
Phil: “Hello Models.”
Nick: “It’s nice, but I’m not getting high fashion.
"But that's... I mean why...?" Steve asks.
Steve nods.
Nick: “A bit arrogant but an amazing runway walker.”
Suddenly Steve is in a white tuxedo, "Better?"  Smiling, Tony opens the car door.  Steve climbs in and they drive off, there are tin cans affixed to the back, bouncing and sparking off the road.
"Why are you here?" asks an irritated Tony.
Phil: “But is he taking this competition seriously.”
and the final name, recently etched;
Phil: “Beautiful bone structure and most model potential.”
Thor, 27: “I knew I was worthy of this competition!”
Tyra: “Is she ready for this competition thought?”
Tyra: “Let’s hope your photo has the same energy.” Picture pops up.
The two men roar along the freeway at speed, kissing and making "lovey-dovey'" eyes at each other.
Tyra: “First name… is…” She randomly grabs an envelope and opens it. “…Gamora.” Everyone cheers, Gamora cries and heads over to the stage. “Next Finalist… is… T’Challa.” He cheers and runs over next to Gamora. “James… Barnes.” Everyone keeps clapping for the
Erin: “She needs some confidence, because she stood in front of us looking as if she was waiting for all negative comments.”
Steve looks at him with a confused face, "There's no point.  Where are you?  Huston...?"
"Carson City, Nevada" Tony answers.  Steve says nothing.

Nebula’s photo appears on the screen.
"You've had relationships thought?"
"uh-huh." Steve says hesitantly.
"Felt like a change of music" Tony starts fiddling with a Nokia 7650.  Steve immediately snatches it from him and throws it across the room, "How the hell is this your era?"  Tony pointing after the phone, annoyed, "I was looking at that"
They move to the bedroom.
“The Prizes are a bit similar to the past 2 seasons, a Contract with LA Models, and a Contract with FENTY Beauty.” Pictures of the past two winners, Ororo Munroe and Scott Lang appear in the FENTY ads. “and your new prize… a Cover, and a six-page spread in… Vogue Italia.” All the contestant’s cheer. “Let’s begin.”
Time has passed, by a few months, and the bright, burning sunlight glints off the walls of the Sienna Trust nursing home.  Elder Tony sits in a main lounge area, an oxygen tanks attached to his nostrils.  At the other tables there are seniors playing dominos and staring at the walls.  He had never fit in this place.  Later in his room, Elder Tony having a coughing fit, painful, sharp.  It comes to an end, and Rhodey rubs his back.
“He killed Sam, Bucky and Natasha.” Steve finished, finally putting it all together.
"That's not what I mean," Tony starts to tense up, "Pass over.  When you're ready, when it's your time.  Pass over," Steve begs.
Both Peters look up, “…Parker.” Peter breathes out in reassurance. “Tony.” Bruce, Natasha and Hope are called right after. “Five models left.” Quill, Nebula, Carol, Shuri and Wanda, are the only ones left.
Erin: “I like the face, but your body looks a bit awkward and disconnected.”
Erin: “Congrats Tony, you will receive a piece of my jewelry collection worth 5,000 dollars.”
Tony using his fingers indicating 'The World', "THIS, means fun, or it should," he now is indicating 'you and me', "And THIS, this is not fun.  Okay.  This is not fun."  Steve stops fighting, his eyes are wet.  "Okay, look.  Don't [do that]" Tony starts trying to comfort in his own way.  "So you don't feel bad?" Steve asks.  Tony doesn't know what to say.  "Maybe you should feel bad, or at least feel something." Steve turns and leaves, Tony sighs.  He turns and looks at himself in the mirror.  Then he punches the mirror, hard.  It splinters.  Shatters.  Tony looks down at his hand.  No blood.  He looks at his reflection in the mirror, which is now unharmed.
“Carol…” Tony begins.
was in love with her."  This is hard for him, "but she chose not to stick around."  Steve slides closer, and runs his hand through Tony's hair.  There are tears glistening in Tony's eyes now, "So now it's me.  And I'm passing through, and before I leave I'll have a good time.. I'm just gonna have a good time,"
"I couldn't..."
*Dramatic beat plays as screen turns to black. *
“I can’t.  I—”
“Really it’s okay” Tony reassures.
Peter Benjamin Stark    age 39
by Kylie Minogue.  Steve scans the bar, the booths, the dance floor- nothing.  He's walking out, past the arcade section, past a Namco
blaring from within.
Screen turns to black and white,
Tyra: “Your challenge is to give more variety in your pictures.” Tony nods in agreement. “Well let’s begin with the ladies then, and let’s begin with… Wanda.”
Nebula, Carol, Shuri and Hope start crying, because this is it, there’s no chance they’re going to make it. Tony is telling Peter Parker that everything is going to be okay. Steve is now looking determined, putting an arm around Thor and Okoye.
Now, It’s Is Beginning Of A
Tony shakes his head, "No, when I'm done, I am done."
That makes Tony instantly angry, hard to control it, "You don't know what you're saying," he says.
The models now realize this is no joke.
“Last week, we had the most amazing…” Carol says, interrupting Tony.  Cutting her off, Tony tells her “Last week was last week” indicating Steve “I need to talk to my friend here, okay?  Haven’t seen him in a while.”  Tony puts a supportive arm around Steve.  Steve is surprised but puts on a smile for Carol.  Carol goes to speak but Tony interrupts “Carol!  He’s sick.  Like six months to like sick.” “Five actually” Steve playing along.  Tony looks at Steve, amused and impressed, but then immediately hurry to hide this, he looks back at Carol, “I need to catch up with him.  Private time.”  Carol looks, considers protesting, then thinks better of it, “okay, okay” she turns to Steve “Hey, I’m Sorry.”  Steve replies, “That’s okay.”  She looks at Tony, “I’ll see you around.”  “Sure.” Tony replies.  The guys watch her leave.
Phil Coulson: “Normally at this point, you would have an interview with Tyra and us, but some decisions have already been made.”
Tony stops, this is no fun now, "How many guys you think there are in San Junipero?  Hundreds? Thousands?"

Erin: “I would’ve thought that you were selling the rings on your hand.”
Tyra: “We picked Funny man Peter Quill, Edgy Nebula, Feisty Carol, Elegant Hope, Army-man Steve, Italian Stallion Antonio, Baby face Peter Parker, Tough-guy Clint, Mysterious Natasha, Quirky Wanda, Handsome Thor, Sassy Shuri, Sexy Mama Okoye, and Tempered Bruce.”
One week later.
Tyra: “Thanks Peter, next up is… Clint Barton. Whose hero name is Hawkeye trying to sell a black shirt.”
"Seriously, it's so tight they..." Peggy tries to reject.
Steve thinks for a moment, "She really is a good gal.  I mean my family don't approve, but they can't stop us" he pauses, breathes, "I know she pities me, that pisses me off, and that's not fair..."
Tony kisses his cheek, "Shhh."
Carol stares at him.  “Your ex-husband is a complicated man.”  She takes a seat in the armchair near the bed.  “He had some secrets he wished to take to the grave, but I am going to tell you who Tony really is.”
Model 1: “Hi I’m Peter Parker, I’m 18 and I’m here for the Semi-Finals of America’s Next Top Model.”
- it was the best blowjob of his life.
“Alright.” Steve banked back towards the tower.
That was something to look into later. Right now…
"All done," Steve announced. "It's not bad at all. He's okay."
“What do you see happening here?” Tony asked, sipping the disgusting coffee and trying not to curl his lip up. A slight twitch in Steve’s expression told him he had anyway.
Tony set his briefcase down by his feet and glanced around at the shop. It was mostly empty - people at this time of the morning came and went - and there was no line. “I bring this briefcase when I have an investor’s meeting and I need the extra sugar to get me through it. Glasses are if I slept in late and didn’t have time to put my contacts in. Mocha helps wake me up for some reason. On the phone at this time of morning means foreign shit which always stresses me out and it’s going to be a four espresso kind of day. First of the month I take muffins to accounting. Lainey only likes carrot. Fifteenth is my monthly review meeting with my PA. I get us both danishes. Oh and jeans means I’m in the workshop all day. Then I get what I actually like best because I’m going to have a chance to enjoy it.” He sighed. “I’m sorry I snapped. I didn’t realize I wore my schedule quite so on my sleeve. I have to worry about corporate espionage and stuff.” Tony rubbed his hand over his face.
“A gift!” he announced. “For all of us.” He tore the tag off and tucked it in his pocket.
Tony scrubbed a hand over his face. “This isn’t really working is it?”

"Uh. Shit."
He stepped back to tuck his tablet under his pillow so the notification light wouldn’t bother Cooper then turned back towards the door. But as he stepped out into the hall, movement had him shying back into the darkness of his room again.

“They have pictures of

A single tear tracked over Steve’s cheek. What if Tony never woke?

They pawed through the bag of supplies they’d bought, trying to match what they had with what she was talking about. Between the two of them, they managed to get a somewhat even layer of icing on top of the bottom layer, which they’d trimmed liberally to relieve it of its burnt edges (most of which had helpfully stuck to the pan anyway). Bucky placed the top layer on and they watched in grim silence as it slipped to the side. Steve pushed it back. It slipped again.
Steve cradled the reactor in one hand, braced his other on Tony’s shoulder and eased it into place. It did click, and Steve spread his fingers over it, only breathing again when the blue light flickered back to life under his palm.  Tony let out a shaky breath too and slumped back in his chair, eyes falling closed.
But Steve grit his teeth and balled his fists in his lap and forced himself not to break a table with Greg’s face. He didn’t know how to play this; Tony would.
Bucky stopped and stared up at the building in front of him. Huh. It really was a windmill. If someone were to say, “he’s a mad genius who lives in a windmill,” your first thought would be that they were overreacting, but at least part of it seemed to be very true in this case. Bucky checked his notebook again. Stark was the name. Tony Stark.
“I only pushed you away because I thought you were cheating on your boyfriend.”
“I miss you, too.”
The next time Steve came to him, he was a huge wolf, but Tony still knew he was Steve, somehow. He curled around Tony, heavy and fluffy and soft, and Tony could feel the heat when he dug his fingers down deep into his fur. Tony was still shaking, though.
“I don’t care.” Tony started walking backwards towards the nest, pulling Steve along with him. “We’re young, we’ll survive. Plus, you only get to be first time homeowners once.”
Steve bent down and brushed the snow off Tony’s neck. He drew him up further into his lap, shuffling around until Tony’s limp body rested against his chest. Steve pressed his face into Tony’s neck. He could barely smell the hint of a thready, weak pulse thudding weakly under his skin. This was his last chance to back out.
Tony watched Steve ratchet tighter. It was like every one of his gears was rusting before Tony’s eyes, clenching and catching and creaking. Creases that Steve’s perfect face usually didn’t display appeared at the corner of his eyes. His hands clenched into fists at his sides, then released, then clenched again.
Steve didn’t stop, licking and sucking at Tony’s hole, until he was shaking and begging, his cock leaking one last drop of come as it throbbed in the air, untouched. Finally, Steve lifted, pushing Tony’s hips up, and slipped out from under him.

"Okay."
“Yeah, I mean, I don’t like mushrooms so the forest was a bit overwhelming, but you get the idea. At least the caterpillar wasn’t there. Three is not a crowd, it’s a rave.”
“Yeah?”

Steve slipped back down in his chair, grinning so hard his cheeks hurt. He lifted his blanket back up and tucked it around his legs then collected his book and opened it to the page he’d bookmarked.
“Har, har.”
"I don't know… I guess I have shit to say… I don't fucking know. I don't know why I didn't hang up when you answered."
“Yeah.”
“You didn’t take anything from me.” Tony tugged on Steve’s sleeve and he gave in easily, helplessly, stumbling into Tony as Tony leaned up on his toes, caught the side of Steve’s face with his other hand and kissed Steve again. Steve jolted back in surprise, but Tony’s fingers tightened and he pressed forward. “Steve…” he muttered, lips brushing, “stop worrying about what that kiss said about you and starting paying attention to what this says about me.” And Tony kissed him again.

"I almost had you that time," Tony said, panting as he lay sprawled across the gym floor. A hand appeared in his line of sight and he took it.
Steve’s lips twitched up on one side and his eyes softened. He tilted his head to the side. “I think I can take you.”
Magic didn’t lie. If he and Tony weren’t meant to be together, well, there wasn’t anything he could do about that. He’d have to go home and find a way to get over him.
Why couldn’t his new partner have been ugly, boring, and ancient? Instead he had to be witty, beautiful, and only a few years older than Steve.
Tony laughed at the old joke, then leaned in and hopped his legs around Bucky's waist. Bucky took his weight easily turning to step towards the bedroom, but a loud bang reverberated around them. "Shit! They're here. They found us." Tony dropped to the ground and wrestled a gun out of his waistband, Bucky doing the same thing on the other side. More explosions as their trailer was riddled with bullets. Tony made eye contact with Bucky. "Together?"
He could tell Steve was getting annoyed and didn’t want to be around him anymore. But Tony couldn’t make his leg heal any faster.
“It’s fine.” Steve grit his teeth. “We’ll hide it with more icing.”
“No kidding,” Steve said breathlessly. “I hope - uh - the stuff I said -”
Steve mouthed,
Steve threw himself against the glass. He was desperate now, begging, sobbing, but he couldn’t summon any embarrassment. All he could think about was waking up with his whole life torn apart again. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t. This would be the end of him. “No!” He slammed his shoulder against the glass, but it didn’t even wobble under the assault. They would come. They had to come for him. Someone had to come for him. A frustrated tear tracked down his cheek as Strucker reached for the controls. “Please,” Steve tried.
“Well, I didn’t miss any of you,” Tony said with a wink. He sighed down at the disgraceful state of his garbage disposal. He tried to be happy to see his team, and he really was, but there was only one person he needed, and it seemed he wasn’t here. “Where’s Steve?”
"Steve," Steve said. "Hi. Sorry."
“I don’t either. We were being stupid. I’m taking you home and never letting you go again, okay?”
"I… I can't. I can't seem to access the comm lines at all. My contact to the outside world has been completely severed."
The wind whipped rough and biting through the wasteland this ice planet had become, broken ruins of buildings, once magnificent, littered the snow. They were trapped, but the remains of their ship was pumping out just enough heat to keep them alive, and they had two weeks of rations stashed away. It wasn’t going to be pleasant, but it was doable. Tony’s fingers and toes were stiff and tingling, his nose aching. He snuggled down deeper in his jacket, but his eyes cut over to Steve when he shivered again.
Tony kept his chin down and motored on.
“Thank you for the chocolate.” Steve squeezed him tighter, burying his face in Tony’s hair.
“Goodnight.”
"Yeah."
Bucky adopted the expression of a wounded puppy. "No… I - that's not -"
. There was no other word for it. There was an instant and intense attraction, and Tony was pretty sure he wasn’t the only one who felt it.
“You really want to know?” Greg leaned over to whisper in Steve’s ear. “Tonight… you swapped ties after the keynote.”
Steve took the tool and slotted it carefully into the screw, hyper aware that this wasn’t just a piece of machinery he was working on, it was a piece of Tony.
“Yeah.”
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
"I just - I figured you probably had people coming to you all the time and - and claiming -"
Steve continued to look suspicious so Tony slipped out of the bedroom. "Thanks, darling. Good luck with trying to crawl into the closet. I mean, you've shacked up with a man and have a child together so I don't think -"
Four days later, Tony sat at his desk, squinting at a medical journal and wondering when they were going to stop publishing the whacked-out shit that Dr. Hammer kept sending them.
“Just prom stuff. You wouldn’t have to kiss me or anything.” Tony laughed, and Steve choked on nothing. “Hold my hand, maybe dance a little, show up together, leave together. And if Brock or Justin asks, you say I asked you and you said yes.” Tony trotted along at Steve’s side as they walked down the hall. “I mean if we were going to go as friends anyway, it wouldn’t be that different… right? I guess… unless there was someone you wanted to ask?”
Square: Movie Night
But when the soft
Maybe a long layover wasn't so bad after all.
“Where in god’s name did you come from?”
The roof was built in two layers, the upper one windy and wild - where Loki’s device had been - but the lower was shielded by one wall of the penthouse, and it made a calm extra balcony that Tony never used. As far as he knew, Steve never used it either.
Tony laughed and led him out of the study. "I've got so much to show you…"
“You’re going to take my cock so well, Tony. You’re so good for me. You’re going to wait, and then you’re going to come on my cock so I can feel how amazing you are when you clench down around me. So I can see you cover yourself in come. You’re going to do that for me, and I’m going to fill you up the way you need. You can do that, right?”
Tony swallowed down a sudden lump in his throat. "Me too, Cap."
There was a long, tense silence, and Steve's brow furrowed. He was ready to snap angrily at the probable scam caller, but then the barest of breaths sucked in over the line, and Steve crumpled instead.
“Of course. It was just a fight, Tony. There are going to be fights. Two people as hot headed as we are… there are definitely going to be fights. But it doesn’t mean everything has to be over. We just need to take some time, breathe, then talk about it.” He reached up with his other hand and brushed his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony leaned into the touch. “I can’t promise we’ll be together forever, maybe one of these days, it’ll be too much, we’ll go too far. But this was just a little disagreement, and I think we’re worth trying, if you do.”
7:28 PM: Captain Rogers begins a conversation regarding Avengers Protocols
[11:28] Steve: Of course you can call me.
Tony opened his mouth then closed it again. He tugged his glasses off, but dropped his eyes to the ground between them. They were still toe to toe, and Steve had each of Tony's shoulders in his hands. "Um. No… No, I guess not. It's okay! I -" He looked back up at Steve and their eyes met. His lips wobbled, eyes going bright.
Steve falls in love with Tony right away, but he’s sure Tony doesn’t return his feelings. When things between them sour further, Steve takes reckless to a new level.
“Like spending every minute I can with you. Like falling in love with you again, over and over, every morning that I get to wake up to you beside me. Like travelling and exploring. Like bickering over how to load the dishwasher and what to order for dinner and how much you’re supposed to spend on jeans.”
his self-satisfied grin. He loved reducing Tony to swear words, and god help him, Steve was damn good at it. Tony glared at the headboard in front of him, all he could see. Technically, he

“The painting?” Tony took out his phone and opened the gallery. He flicked to a folder and a sea of images of Steve’s graffiti work appeared. He flicked through them then stopped on one of Iron Man with a steampunk theme, all gears and pistons. “Like this.”
So… if Tony had happened to find his route home from work altered to pass by the window, well, that was no one’s business but his own.
Katie knocked on the door. "Three o'clock is here, Dr. Stark,” she said as she passed by.
Thank you to Hermit for help
“Nah, she’s just filled with ennui.” He bounced the baby again, and she gurgled. “Don’t worry, Peanut, the tax thing was mostly bogus. Daddy will make sure you have a very expensive accountant.”
The voices continued for a moment, then fell silent. Footsteps padded down the hall, and the Bartons’ bedroom door opened and closed. Tony took a steadying breath and darted outside.
Tony turned back to face the swaying field in front of them. A tiny sliver of red light was breaching the horizon. “I love you,” he said.
Steve turned a corner and the wall exploded in front of him slamming him back against the bricks and momentarily stealing his breath. He staggered back to his feet, sucking dust in with his next shaky breath. His arm came up automatically in front of him, but he didn’t have the shield.
Tony finally pulled his emergency code from the mess of panic and adrenaline that was his brain. "JARVIS, code 89900! Emergency Shutdown Activate!"
“Not at night, at least,” Tony said with a laugh. “So what did you want to show me?”
Steve blocked Tony’s view of his hands with is own head, leaning in for a kiss. “I think all of you has aged beautifully,” Steve whispered against his lips.
“I don’t want to fight you!” Tony called at Steve, as he was pressed on towards the other entrance.
Steve rubbed a hand on his tailbone. "Just a bruise."
“Oh, for fucks sake,” Tony says, glaring down at his rediscovered nudity. “I’m starting to think it wasn’t even a byproduct of the time travel. Cukoo brain is just kinky as fuck.”
Mr. Stark went very, very still. "Uh. Is that so?"
Tony shook his head.
“Seriously,” Steve begged. “She’s that cool. I love in her a completely platonic, wannabe artist kind of way. I wish, wish I could make my lines flow like hers. That’s it.”
"Okay."
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
“Shit.” He fumbled for the phone, yanking it off the charger, and swiped it open, heart pounding. “Hello?”
Tony gazed into Bucky's eyes, his hands cupping his cheeks. "I love you," he whispered. He leaned in and stole a kiss, heart pounding, and Bucky's arms wrapped around his waist.
“Well, technically you never married me so…”
“We need to talk,” Tony said, walking into the room with the pained, false-confident stride of a doomed man on his way to the guillotine. He was dreading this, but it had to be done.
If someone had asked Tony what he expected to be doing this Friday night, going down to Steve's apartment for a late night
He started with his email, but despite multiple refreshes, there was nothing new. Twitter, Facebook, and reddit all failed to offer anything interesting, so Steve's thumb automatically jumped to Tinder next. It was always interesting, seeing what was out there in a completely new city, and Chicago was no different. Even though Steve wasn't particularly interested in hooking up tonight - it'd get him out of the airport but it'd be pretty awkward to maneuver with his bags - it was mildly amusing to flick through the men and women on offer and get a sense of the city he hadn't seen more of than lights from an airplane window.
They sat that way, in the growing dawn, watching the sunrise pierce the gloomy sky with its rays. They heard the birds sing their good mornings, and the shuffle of animals in the barn. They watched the beginning of a new day.
“Tony Stark,” the young man said, extending his hand.
“Though, I suppose,” Tony went on, “having a doctor around could be useful when you have a kid with a serious allergy.”
Winteriron!
Tony shook his head.
Set at the very end of chapter 14 of In Trouble Deep. Tony sees the Ultimates-themed baby sleepers for the first time.
"Okay, good." Tony looked so lost that Steve had to resist the urge to hug him. "So, um. What can I get you? You need, uh, baby things? Maternity clothes? You have insurance, right? Is it enough?"
At first, he just read the bios and laughed at the pics then swiped left, but as boredom set in, he swiped right on a few, hoping for at least some conversation to help pass the time.
Steve burst out laughing. “Tony…” he murmured affectionately.
“Steve -” Tony started, but Steve shifted forward, rising up on his knees until they were chest-to-chest. He held a finger to Tony’s lips to silence him then replaced it with his lips, pressing a soft, almost chaste kiss there, belied by the fact that Tony was completely naked and chained up, and Steve had his shirt off and his pants unbuttoned, shamelessly tenting his underwear through the gap in his open fly.
He swallowed harder and shifted up onto his elbow, driving down onto Steve like he was riding him, as if he was chasing his own orgasm instead of Steve’s. And Steve realized he kind of was. Tony was painfully hard-looking, and though neither of his hands moved to touch himself, he was thrusting more intently now, the wet patch spreading.
Steve looks back over at Tony.  Tony is looking at the table, Steve looks back down at his drink, blushing, then back at Tony.  This time Tony is looking at him, sipping on a straw flustered Steve looks back down.  Tony smiles faintly, he leans in to Wanda , interrupting her.  "... I mean I guess if at the time, I'd put that money into, like computing.  Caught that first wave, woulda been a different story-"  "Gotta use the bathroom", Tony tells her.  He stands up and walks toward the men's room.  Across the way, Steve watches him go.  Tony glances at him as he leaves.  Steve gets up.
Like I said, super short lol.
“A tourist?”
“I… I… feel like I’m being… analyzed.”
“Yes” Carol answers.  “He’s kept these since the day you gave them to him.  I took these off his body when I retrieved you from the battle sight.  He looked at peace.”  Carol starred out the window, taking in the view of the field.  “You may not believe me, but Tony never stopped loving you.  It’s been 4 years since you and the rogue avengers left, but he never stopped loving you.”
Tony Clambers off the top of the fire escape.  Steve is now sitting on the edge now, calmly, legs dangling over the side.  Tony makes his way towards him, "Please tell me you got your pain slider set to zero."
Sorry for the wait, I had finals and work taking up my time also my laptop was not working at all.  Thank you to all who have been reading this fic.  for my first fic, it's not so bad lol.  and just a reminder, this is inspired by Black Mirror and I don't own any of the ideas that went into creating the plot.
Tony runs up to the judges to hug and thank them.
“The only way for his plan to work, was for you to hate him.  He wanted you to loathe him so that when you killed him, you wouldn’t hesitate.”
"You married me." Steve says sadly.
A crying Tony roars along the highway at full throttle.  The clock on the dash reads 11:58.  He's flying at full speed, a 'Just Married' hangs on the back with cans sparking furiously against the tarmac.  Tony swerves around a corner, narrowly avoiding a set of headlights.  He slams his foot herder on the accelerator.  Up ahead, a section of road gives away to a drop, but before it are a set of bollards.  Tony looks at this, and aims the car right towards it.
“Tony may have been a genius, but he was an idiot.  You wouldn’t have accepted this suit if you were still hidden from the truth.”
Steve looks around, there is a couple striding a long the sidewalk across the street, at least they look like a couple.  The young woman is conventionally dressed, a pink skirt, a boyfriend baseball jacket, basically a typical 80’s pop star.  The guy looks individual, almost artsy, slicked hair.  Intriguingly attractive.
"Don't!" Tony is getting angry.
Antonio (Tony), 19: *Crying to camera* “I dropped out of MIT to be hear, now I have nothing to go home to. It just sucks” *sobbing*
Tyra: “Thank you Shuri.” “Thank you, guys.” Shuri says. “Alrighty, next is Nebula.”
The chorus of the track is in full swing.  Tony dances- care free.  Steve is quite awkward.  Almost just standing, watching.  He looks around, trying to vaguely move his shoulders in time, nut it’s painful to watch.  Tony leans in, “Copy me!”, Tony says in a raised voice over the music.  He starts to perform a dance move, pretty much lifted from Michael Jackson—nothing to elaborate—indicting Steve should copy him.  Steve starts to follow suit.  He’s getting better.  Tony laughs and nods, “You got it.”
"You're passing over tomorrow?"
Tyra: “Edgy, and soft at the same time.”
Steve looks at her confused, “What?  That’s he a crazy power-hungry evil man who killed his former comrades.  I stopped loving him the moment I heard he killed the president of the US.”
The servers are each labeled San Junipero and assigned a number... San Junipero server1, San Junipero server2... and so on
Tyra: “And last of the male models, Mister Antonio.” “Tony is fine.” “Also, congrats on winning the challenge.” Everyone claps and Tony bows in thanks.
One week later.
He turns, smiling, "Guess you took my v-card."
Various Audition tapes play on the screen.
Montage with upbeat music of the models being fitted, hair being styled, makeup being done. Some are practicing their walks, and some are eating their lunch. The backyard has this humongous pool, surrounded by tons of chairs, at the end of the pool are tons of cameras, and at the other end are curtains from where they would enter. Phil is the show director and is signaling every one of the crew. The audience arrives, and there are various Fashionistas and other import people of the fashion world. “Start the music!” Phil yells.
“Shuri.” Shuri basically sprints to Tyra, which makes Tyra chuckle, “Congratulations, you’re still in the running to become America’s Next Top Model.” Shuri thanks her. There’s a long pause, which makes the contestants nervous. “Quill.” There’s a sigh of relief, “I would’ve called you sooner, but you need to impress the judges more.” Quill thanks her. “Three girls, but only 2 photos. The next name I am going to call is…” dramatic music, “…Nebula.” Nebula covers her mouth; opened by shock. “We need to see more confidence; you need to feel as good a you do in this photo. Congratulations, you’re still in the running to become America’s Next Top Model.”
Shuri- Hero name: Shuri. Item to sell: Dress.
A pair of LEDs flicker immensely, labeled San Junipero Server3 0012-TonySt@rk and San Junipero Server3 0011-Steve R0g3rs.
*Confessional*
Tyra: “I just see and pretty girl, not really a model.”
Tyra: “I would like to see a lot more from here.”
"It's just... Peggy seems great, but... why not someone you've... connected with...?"
"And I'm dying." Tony holds Steve's head up, "Whatever you are can't scare me.  Let me come visit.  I wanna say hi."
Phil: “Alright Models, go home, rest, because the easy part is over.”
It's night at San Junipero, Steve is alone, walking along the middle of the road, tears in his eyes, he looks up at the night sky.
starts playing on the stereo.  He reverses out of the driveway and goes to drive forward, but suddenly Carol is there, in the road.  He pulls a face, not entirely unkind, but unimpressed and impatient.  He guns the engine and drives around her.  Tony's car roars along the highway,
“What are you talking about!?” Steve yells.  “He became a ruthless ruler, he killed almost all of congress, and he took over various countries!  How is that out of love?  TELL ME!”
, Tyra thinks.
“Steve”
Tyra: “Let’s see your best shot.” A picture of Quill appears, holding a gun pointing it off screen.
The doctor leads Tony to a small private room.  He opens the door for Tony, then waits outside the room.  He follows Tony as he walks inside.  Tony can hear the soft beep of a monitoring device.  The percussive rise and fall of a mechanical ventilator.  "He won't be able to physically respond in anyway, but he can hear you." Dr. Banner starts heading out the door, "I'll give you some privacy."
comes on.  Tony dances to the chorus.  Aware he's being watched, Steve watches, wanting to walk over, and failing.
1987.  It's Tony's San Junipero house, during daylight hours.  He opens to door, and there on the sand looking a little confused,  is Steve.  "Hey!  Over Here!" Tony yells as he rushes over to Steve.  Steve turns around, "Not been here during daylight hours before... it's warm."  Tony joins him.  They hold hands and walk along the sand.  "So I spoke to Peggy."
“San Junipero’s a party town.  All up for grabs,” Tony replies, “midnight’s two hours away”, he continues.  Tony’s inched in a little more.  Steve is almost shaking now, with nerves and excitement.  “That’s not long”, Steve replies.  Tony brushed confetti away from Steve’s neck.  Then, leans in and talks quietly, almost in his ear, “Why waste time sitting here?”.  He puts his hand on Steve’s inner thigh.  Steve exhales as if with vertigo.
"Steve hardens, "I don't want you to.  I don't want you to see me."  Steve is emotional, "I mean I'm scared-"
Tony is lying in bed, a tube is delivering clear liquid into his forearm.  The connector nodules in position on his temples.
Shuri, 18: “I literally fell.” *sniffs* “She had to come over and pick me up.”
Erin: “Nice to see you all again.” The models wave to Erin.
Steve strides away, through the rain, murmuring to himself.  “Okay.  Okay.  Okay” Steve tells himself, “Shit.  Shit.”  He Stops.  He looks up at the sky again.  Closes his eyes.  Exhales, opens his eyes again.  Makes a decision.  He turns on his heel to look at Tony.  But he’s not there, Steve just catches a glimpse of Tony walking back in through the fire escape, the door closing behind him.  Steve hovers for a moment, then decides not to follow.  He turns around again and walks away, a little crushed.
“I don’t wanna talk about Stark, especially with some woman who I don’t know.”  Steve says angrily.  “I’ve lost all my friends and you wanna talk about the man who killed them!?”
Various shots of Steve, Nebula and Thor posing in front of a grey background while a camera is taking their pictures.
"Yeah" Steve says hesitantly.
Erin: “Not only will you be wearing my jewelry, but you will also be wearing clothes designed by my friend, mister Alexander Wang.” The models are hysterical, they cannot believe they are walking in an Alexander Wang fashion show.
"You hid from me."
"Stay here with me..."
"Next week?" Tony replies, "To 'nice' Peggy?  Sure you're going through with that?"
Steve goes back to shield trying to find tony.
Tony lightly touches Steve’s glasses, “But I like these.  They’re authentically you”, Tony says in a soft voice.  Steve is shy, but he responds, “to be honest I think I wear the for something to hide behind.”
“Because you are all traitors.  And because this is my form of justice.”  Tony says vigorously without facing Steve, “There is no room for you here.”
The billboard now advertises the doomed Village People movie
Phil: “Alright Tony, you won the challenge, impress me.” *Tony, 19: “I knew everyone would have their eyes on me since I won the challenge.”   Hero Name: Iron Man. Item to sell: Metal gloves. Tony was hitting pose after pose. Russel James: “I would book Antonio in a heartbeat; he knew what to do and gave me a variety to pick from.”
Steve couldn’t believe it.  “Why didn’t he talk to me!?”
"Steve..."
Nick: “Fierce and Editorial. An African Queen.” Okoye smiles.
Downtown Los Angeles. The Avengers Tower.
“Nebula”
The executive producer gathers everyone in front of the stairs. Everyone looks so defeated. Then, the producer begins to speak. “Tyra always feels bad about this and likes to say goodbye before you all leave.”
Wanda and Carol are the last two models standing on the platform. Wanda has a neutral expression, while Carol’s eyes are reddening and filling with tears. “Would Wanda and Carol, please step forward.” Both ladies walk side by side, only to stop in front of Tyra. “Two beautiful young ladies stand before me, but I only have one photo in my hand. This photo represents the girl who is still in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Model. The name of the person I do not call, will return to your home here in Los Angeles, pack your bags, and go home.” Carol is fighting her tears. “Wanda you stand before me because although you’re a beautiful girl, the judges think that that’s not enough to be a model. Then Carol, interesting girl with a model look, but had the worst photo in the bunch. So, who stays?” Camera shots on both girls faces, and the models standing in the side of the room. Tyra pulls out a photo, “Carol, the judges feel that you have an amazing personality and that you need to show it more in your photos.” Carol is sobbing, grasping the photo in her hand, “congratulations, you’re still in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Model.” “Thank you,” Carol says as she steps to the side of the room where all the other models are. Wanda is heartbroken, Tyra walks up to her and gives her a hug. “So, you have to go home and practice, and get some pictures that look more striking than you are.” “Okay” Wanda nods. Sad music starts
The entrance to the tech company 'Shield' is highly secured.  The campus is in Silicon Valley with a huge sign reading SHLD Systems.
Erin: “This would definitely be a cover of American Vogue.” Steve smirks.
Photo of Clint with a bow and arrow looking to the side as if he’s looking for bad guys.
“Clint”
“Just follow my lead” and leads Steve Toward the dance floor.
Tyra: “This week the contestants had to portray themselves as heroes, while selling Vintage Mugler. First up is Peter Quill.”
Waves crash intensely with the rocks of the beach.
.  Steve walks along Bakerstreet, smiling, passes the store window with the TV  in it.  There's a trail for the
A small distance away, Steve is found, dressed in his regular attire, watching Tony, plucking up the courage to approach.  From Steve's perspective, Tony is listening to Wanda.  When in reality Tony is a tad bored.  Wanda's saying stuff like, "... so it was micro-surgery I guess, I mean both my kneecaps were just worn down..."  Back to Steve.  he seems to be exhaling, calming himself, mentally counting down.  Then, he starts walking over.
“Looking...?”  Steve, indicating the two of them, “You know?  Two guys dancing”.  Shock appears on Tony, “Okay.  One, folks are way less uptight than they used to be, and two, this is a party town, no-one’s judging”.  Tony looks down at himself, at his own body.  Does a slightly ridiculous ‘sexy’ move, “Face it, if they were starring, it’s because I.  Am.  Bodacious.”.  That makes Steve laugh a little, “You’re Stupid”.  “Thank you”, Tony bows slightly.
"SHIT!" Steve says, "I wasn't sure I wanted to try it out, but... like without this place, I'd
"It's what, 200 miles..." Steve is trying to tell him "no" in a mean way. But Tony is not buying it, "I like to travel.  When they let me, which is not often."
"What the hell, Carol?"
Nick: “Good Evening.”
The judges all nod.
"So one night, he's 21... comes out to his folks.  They're a little 'up tight' about it you might say.  They tell him they don't want a gay son, it's not natural and so forth.  They fight, he gets in his car, runs it off the road.  BOOM!"
All seems like a dream come true... or is it?
Elder Tony, sitting in a chair, suddenly lurches forward slightly, as though rousing from a dream.  He reaches for the 'connector' nodules on his temples and takes them off.  In the corner of the room sits Rhodey, asleep with a tablet in his lap.  Elder Tony rubs his eye a little, leans back against his chair and sighs.
*Soft, fast music plays*
"It was just sex", Tony clarifies
Nick Fury: “Yes. Since your arrival you have been watched and analyzed, and we have decided on our finalists.”
There's a silence.  They hold hands.  Steve turns to face Tony, "When did you know?  That you liked men?"  "Uh, I like women too." Jokingly Tony raises his fist, "Equal Rights!"  "Okay.  But when did you know?  Did you always... know?"  Tony looks at him, he doesn't usually open up to conquests, but there' something about Steve.
Nick: “In front of us, she’s very beautiful, but I would never book the girl who is in this picture.”
Phil: “I could see people finding him relatable.”
"Not really."
The headstone reads:
Tyra: “Fresh and I would definitely book him for a job.”
"Ah" Tony thinks, "Couples months" slight pause, "plan is, long enough to enjoy myself."  He looks at Steve, "Guess I'm a tourist like you", and gives him a smile.  Steve looks out the window again, "yeah."
“Even if you two made up, you were still wanted and hated by the US.  He loved you so much that he would rather make everyone hate him if it meant that you were loved again by the public.”
here," He turns to Tony, smiling, "Be with me"  Tony looks at Steve, "I am with you now," he explains.
“I only have two spots left.” Tony, Peter and Wanda start tearing up. Steve is looking down, as if he’s praying, and Bruce looks annoyed. “The penultimate Finalist is… Sam Wilson.” Sam moon walks and dances over to the stage. High-fiving James. “This is it.”
Tyra Voice over: “We picked models from all over the country and I think you’ll be impressed. We picked 26-year-old Steve Rogers, former Army man and if he makes it to makeovers, I plan to shave his beard off. 20-year-old Nebula, who has the look of high fashion. Thor Odinsson, an Adonis, but can he overcome his muscles to be able to be high fashion?”
Wanda, 18: “You better get used to this face, I am America’s Next Top Model.”
Plane lands on LAX tarmac. Models start coming out of baggage claim. Nick Fury and Phil Coulson Stand right outside in the middle of the Airport parking Lot.
"To help you pass over, as a... kindness..."
Phil: “Welcome. I heard some of you whisper the name of the lady next to me, miss Erin Wason. Today you will be in a runway show, wearing jewelry designed by Erin.” The models cheer.
' anyone.  So you've been..." Tony laughs gently, "...just totally fucking inconvenient."  Tony squeezes his hand harder, "Is... that... I mean... " Tony is getting emotional now, "I don't know how
One Week Later.
Steve moves closer, "I'm sorry..."
Erin: “Maybe this isn’t her week?”
Tyra: “Last but not least, Natasha.” Natasha walks forward. “Let’s see your best shot.”
Nick: “I’m getting more PLAYBOY rather than Vogue Italia.”
.  The car skids to a halt.  Tony looks at Steve, who's ruffled, breathing fast.  Suddenly Tony claps his hands, laughs once, "Sorry but" Tony laughs, "Man your face."  Steve laughs nervously, Tony starts the engine again.
Steve is looking around, "It's just so big-"
Nick: “But for me her photo was a bit underwhelming.”
Nick: “Relatable, funny, and tons of personality.”
“Since when?” Steve asked.
Tyra: “This picture is amazing, the pose, the face, and the smizing eyes. And I feel like I should go out and by that outfit.”
"Tony?"
"Why wouldn't anyone take it?" Steve is amazingly shocked.
is playing on a small tape deck.  Steve stands in front of a full length mirror, wearing similar dowdy gear to last week.  He's looking at himself.  He takes off his glasses.  Next, he's trying on a prep look, figure-hugging, a little like the typical rich guy in an 80's movie.  He looks at himself, and wrinkles his nose.  It's not him.  Now he's trying another look. A velour track suit with reebok shoes, looking like a guy in a hip-hop video.  Again, he decides against it.
Magazine Covers and Photos display on the screen.
“Never?  As in whole time you’ve been alive, never?”
Tyra: “Okay thank you Wanda. Up next is Carol.” Carol walks down. “Okay, let’s see your best shot.”
Phil: “I… I don’t know how to feel about him, I’m in between.”
"Yeah but now I
at full volume.  He taps the steering wheel in time to the beat.  Now it's getting dark.  Tony's jeep rolls into the parking lot and pulls to a halt.  He climbs out, locks the door, turns around-- and there's Carol.
"We could have met outside all this..." Tony says.
when she spots Steve, "Hey!"  Steve recognizes her, "Oh hey!"  Natasha points at the Pac Man cabinet, "Golden Age, right?"  "Right!" Steve says still looking around.  "You playing, or..."  "Sorry looking for someone," Steve apologizes.  Natasha nods, "Maybe next time?"  Steve nods and walks away.
Tony nods in agreement, "They ration it out.  They don't trust us with more."
"Has he been here?"
Nighttime LA.
Tyra: “Thank you, Natasha. Okay now it’s time for the judges to deliberate, and when you return you will find out which one of you will bite the dust.”
Tony watches her eat for a moment, "you're a good... a really nice gal."
“I considered Tony as a brother.   He was a good man; he deserves to be a good man.  Only you and I will know that, and it makes he happy that I’m not the only one to see it.  Please accept this for my brother Steve.”
“From what I was told, you stopped loving him when you were willing to kill him in Siberia.” Carol bites back.
Steve turns away and almost walks straight into Carol, who's striding past clutching a bottle of alcohol.  "Whoa, hey!" she says.  "Sorry" their eyes meet.  Carol starts talking, "I know you from somewhere... Shield... Tony' friend huh?"  Steve nodding, "you know where to find him?"  "How would I know that?"  she starts to walk away.  "You're his friend" Steve yells politely.  "Was a friend"
“Carol”
Steve races along the highway in his car, middle of the day, stereo continuing to blare:
Tony smiling, “All the more reason.”  Steve agonizes for moment, “I… You’re nice.  I can’t.”  Tony shrugs, “okay.”
The following day in the private hospital room, the wedding begins.  A pastor is reading words of the marriage ceremony, as Tony sits beside Steve holding his hand.  Peggy and Rhodey look on, "... to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, is good times and bad, for richer or poorer..."  Later a hospital official staff holds out a translucent tablet, with a consent form on it.  Using his forefinger, Tony taps a consent box for [spouse], his consent is registered.  The official looks round at Dr. Banner, fives the nod.  In the bed, Steve is hooked up with the 'connector' device.  There's also a new tube attaches to his arm.  The doctor holds a syringe.  He looks at Tony, who is sitting beside Steve, and stroking Steve's hair.  He nods at the doctor.  The doctor presses the syringe.  An opaque white fluid travels through the snaking pipe, into Steve's arm.  The winking LED on the connector starts to go into overdrive.  Tony strokes Steve's hand.  A screen indicates his vital signs have finished.  Peggy draws a sheet over Steve's face.  A single tear rolls down Steve's cheek.
Tony interrupts, "Well if you just want someone to fuck, there's options, hang out at the Quagmire again--"
“He also had one more thing for you.”  Carol walked to Steve, handing him the Arc Reactor. “He made you a new suit.  This is a portable Arc Reactor that uses nano bots.  He wanted you to have it.”
Nick whispering to Phil: “This girl knows what she’s doing.”
Steve stands beside the road, almost the middle of nowhere.  He looks at a napkin in his hand, with a scribbled map on it, given to him by the barman.  In front of him is a gate with a dirt track behind it.  Beside it, on a small pole, is a sort of entry buzzer with the word 'Quagmire' where the residential name would be.  He pushes the button.
A few moments later, the guys are at the bar, on bar stools.  Tony leans forward to get attention of the barman, who has long blonde hair and a beard.  Walk Like an Egyptian is playing.  “Hey Thor!?” Tony trying to get the attention of the barman.  Mock-offended, the barman points to himself, “I’m Thor?”
"Not so kind to leave." Steve says.  Tony breaks of the hold Steve has on him.  Steve continues, "Look, I'm sorry but... I've got this chance, we got this chance... I want to share it with you."  Tony heads back to the car, "I said I made my choice," he clarifies.
"Shut up" Steve says affectionately.
A couple sidle over to Steve.  A man and a woman, both in their mid twenties.  Both dressed as sailors.  "Hey" the mans says loudly over the music.  "Wanna have fun?" says the woman.
Later, the vehicle has come to a halt outside a hospital in Santa Rosa.  ST. BIRINUS Hospital.  Rhodey helps Tony down the steps of the vehicle.  A doctor in his 30's holds out a hand to greet him.  "You must be Tony."  Tony replies a little sarcastically, "I guess I must..." he squints towards the doctor's chest, "...DR Banner."  Dr. Banner smiles, "He's waiting for you." Banner, gestures them to go inside.
Steve opens a fire door and exists the building—to discover it’s raining.  He stays beneath the awning, Tony emerges.  “Hey.  Why’d you run away?”
Steve turns to face Tony, "You said you didn't know how long there is.  Back on the roof. 'I don't know how long there is'.  What was that?"  Tony tenses up a little.  He leans back and exhales, "They tell me three months.  It spread basically everywhere."  Steve is in full attention, Tony continues, "They've said three months before, six months ago, so y'know what do they know?"  Tony looks at the cigarette in his fingers, "doesn't even taste of anything."  He flicks it over the edge.  There is a silence.
“You are.  Jack and Coke, times two” Tony demands.  “Oh no.  Mine was just a coke” Steve chimes in.  Tony tells the barman, “Times two.” completely ignoring Steve. “Thor” starts fixing the drinks.  Tony turns to Steve and looks at him slightly strangely.
Quill walks up, “Quills is just fine.”
Tyra: “Models it’s time.” The models look at each other in a
Nick: “I love that you almost look baled in this picture, and your face is nice.”
Some of the model start having tears in their eyes. Some look down, others look away, only 5 spots left before they’re asked to leave.
Nick: “It’s nice, not the best, but not the worst.”
Erin: “Very handsome and very photogenic.”
If this getting to confusing, ill try to explain a little more next chapter.
Erin: “He has a handsome face, and this photo captures that.”
"Couple hours after the wedding," Steve looks around, "So I guess technically I'm honeymooning here forever." Steve turns to face Tony, "I'm sorry, I didn't tell y..."
The Billboard poster has been replaced by a poster promoting
Steve abruptly stands up, very flustered, “I—uh—I—listen…”  Tony isn’t offended, immediately takes it with good grace.  “It’s okay” Tony responds.
Tony looks at him
He pushes Steve aside, jumps in the car and guns the engine.
Back at the Penthouse.
“What are you, like Amish?  That’s one sheltered existence you got there.”  Steve shrugs, “As far as my family is concerned, I can’t do anything.”  Tony sits beside Steve, “Yeah.  Well, no-one knows about even half the shit I get up to”, tony pauses, “with your folks, it’s from a place of love, though right?  They worry.”
Carol pulls something out of her bag.  It’s…. It’s… the arc reactor.  “I only know my details, but JARVIS here knows more than me.  He’ll fill in the gaps.”  Steve looks a bit shocked.  “I’ll start by also giving you this.”  Carol walks towards Steve, handing him something Steve has long lost.
The Milan room. “I Fucking Fell in The Pool!” Carol exclaims as she says coming back from a shower. “Hey, I slipped if that makes you feel any better.” Quill tries to comfort. *Carol, 25: “First challenge and I humiliate myself in front of Erin Wason and Runway coach Nick Fricking Fury” she pouts, “he’s never going to let me forget it too.” Nebula just cackles from the top of her bunk.
"You should be mad at her, not whipping yourself with guilt," Steve goes to take Tony's hand.
Tyra: “14 beautiful models stand before me, but I only have 13 photos in my hands, and these photos represent those who are still in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Model. The first name I will call, is best photo of the week, and that model’s photo will be displayed as digital art in your house.”
Two women are making out in the back of a pick up truck parked to one side.  Steve looks at all this, daunted, what the fuck?  Steve walks in and almost leaves immediately.  The interior of the club looks like a transgressive music video.  There are people dancing in cages, with snakes.  It's steamy, transgressive and weird In here.  Like walking into the video for
One week later, but on Barton street, as the evening sun burns amber, earlier period cars are driving by.  They date from 1980.
"You didn't dress up to see me?  Come on..." Tony says as laughter slips out of his lips.
Phil nods in agreement.
just sex."  Carol is a little wounded,"But.  No..."  Tony takes her hand, "I'm done with attachments.  I went down that road.  For a long time.  And it's... I can't do that again.  No roots."  He puts his hand on her cheek, "We had fun.  I'm sorry" Tony begins to turn around, "Enjoy the town for god's sake."  Carol nods, she knows she's beaten, Tony heads for the bar.
Steve’s eyes begin to tear up, “Why did you tell me all of this?  Wouldn’t it have been better to keep this all as a secret?”
Steve, exactly the same age, but dressed subtly differently, his styling befitting the year 1980, strides past the store with the TV in the window.  Which is showing a scene from the "
years.  you can't begin to imagine... you can't know," he's letting it all out, "The bond.  The commitment, the boredom, the yearning, the laughter, the love of it.  The FUCKING love.  You just cannot know.  Everything we sacrificed.  The years I gave her, the years she gave me.  Did you think to ask?  Did it occur to you to ask?"  Steve is silenced, Tony is increasingly emotional and angry.  "We had a son, Peter.  Always difficult, always smart.  Died at 39 years old, bless his heart, and Pepper and I, we felt that heartbreak as one.  You think you're the only person ever suffered, go fuck yourself."
"I mean they say you can go crazy if you have too much.  Never leave your seat, disassociate your body from your mind..."  Tony is warming up slightly towards Peggy, "Like that doesn't happen at every senior home already.  System's there for therapeutic reasons, officially at my place. 'Immersive Nostalgia Therapy', 'Plunge you into a world of memories'; helps with Alzheimer's.  That's what they say."  Peggy stops eating for a moment and looks at Tony, "that's not my problem incidentally" Tony adds.  She smiles and raises a coffee up, "Small Mercies."
"I was married to a woman, a long time I was married... I always 'knew', I mean, I would be attracted to other guys, coworkers, friends, some waiter who'd serve me..."  Tony laughs at his memory, "There were crushes, My god were there crushes."  His face hardens slightly, he continues, "Never acted on any of it.  Never did anything.  I was in love with her, I
Nick: “Huh. The hands are very distracting, and it takes away from the fact that you’re supposed to be selling the jacket.”
Steve stares at him, almost imperceptibly nods.
Clint- Hero name: Hawkeye. Item to sell: Black shirt. Phil: “Beautiful, great poses.”
“Peter Parker”
"Try Me!" Tony says more forcefully.
"Just help me" Steve nervously says, "Can you just-"
.  He heads purposefully for Shield.
Tony is still good-natured, “I get it.”
“No but…”
"More than 50 years back.  It's been his whole lifetime basically, so the who San Junipero system's been a big deal for him.  The biggest deal."  She takes a bite out of her sandwich, "The hospital didn't have a subscription, some of us held a crowd-sourcing campaign.  Took us a year but we got the money."  She sips her drink, "Course till he passes over, goes permanent, he's got the five-hour weekly limit, but I guess you're the same."
Hero name: Captain Marvel. Item to sell: Jumpsuit. Carol starts posing, and Phil already is not impressed. Phil: “Carol, you look a bit awkward in that pose and you aren’t selling me the jumpsuit.” Carol tries different poses, and Phil still doesn’t look impressed.   “Carol you still need to bring the fashion element.” *Carol, 25: *crying* “I don’t know what else I could have done,” *sob* “I’m trying my best.”
The car thumps into the bollards, dead stop.  Glass fragments spray around Tony as he flies through the windshield-like a rag doll fired from a cannon.  He skids across the tarmac and comes to a halt in the center of the road, a broken heap.  He lies there, staring at the night sky, completely still.  All is silent.  Then slowly, he sits up.  He's dusty-but physically unharmed.  He looks up at the sky again, up at the moon.
“Okoye”
Tyra: “Now it’s time for us to decide who will be going home. First up Quill.”
"As in full timers?" Tony shrugs, "Eighty, Eight-Five."
Tyra: “That’s right, me and the judges sat through hours of tapes and selected our finalist. We wanted to start the competition right away, but I want to have a little fun. So, why not pull a prank on our finalist this episode.”
Camera Zooms in to Tyra’s Face.
Phil: “You look really handsome and I would definitely say this is one of the best shots.” Clint mouths a ‘thank you.’
"Hello, you got a
It's officially night time, the jeep sits parked in an isolated spot looking down over San Junipero below.  The two men sit side by side on the hood, looking at the lights below, crickets chirping.  Steve looks up at the moon, and back out at the lights, "Looks so real," he taps on the hood, "feels so real," he turns round and kisses Tony.  He then jumps off the hood and starts dancing and laughing in the dirt.  "What are you doing?" Tony asks laughing.  "I love it!  I just..." Steve does a cartwheel and ends up looking out into the night, the wind blowing through his hair, "I love it." he says quickly.
“When you left, Sir sequestered himself in his lab for months.  When Natasha and Vision left, he felt unloved, he felt useless.  Sir thought of the avengers as his family.”
"But you can bend that.  They let us have more on birthdays and Thanksgiving, you know, special occasions." Tony is still trying to push Peggy.
Steve continues to stare out at San Junipero, "I think so."
Tyra: “You’re going to have to connect the face with the body, okay. Thank you, Nebula.” Nebula walks back looking down.
Tyra: “Next up is Thor, who is selling pants.” A picture pops up of the god of thunder.
"I shouldn't have asked-"
Please feel free to comment! Thanks for reading!
"Yeah, what's up?"
"You guys bet on us!" Steve exclaimed.
"Tony, it's time to get up. You have a meeting with Nick Fury of SHIELD remember?" Pepper persisted.
"Fine do what you want, but if this ends badly it's on you." Pepper said finally giving in.
Ps: Watch this video
"Yeah... I wanted to talk to you about something." Tony chuckled nervously.
Tony hesitated, then grabbed the human clothes and put them on.
"Hey I can be mature sometimes and I think your right it is time to tell the team. Plus, I think more than many you know that I certainly can cumback." Tony snickered.
"Go ahead in, you know where his room is, but we ask that only immediate family is in the room, we don't want Peter to be overwhelmed." The lady responded.
The man stuttered "U-uh, y-yeah, sure."
"Hey who said I'm Ms's Parker! You don't know if I top or bot-" Peter glared at him.
"First off it's not the 30s anymore and if they disbanded the Avengers who would save the world anymore? Please, it's not like the fantastic four would do it" Tony assured Steve with a chuckle.
-----------------------------------
Steve grabbed ahold of his husband, holding him close, while Steve felt tears roll down his own cheeks. In truth, it was no one's fault what happened to Peter. All of the Avengers trained him in many different combat styles, and the suit that Tony gave Peter was equipped with the newest of Stark Tech; but even Earth's Mightiest Heroes sometimes misjudged a situation, even if it cost them a loved one's life.
"Also, we want you to have the most normal childhood that you can have until you become mini-me," Tony added.
Tony kissed his husband back, then turned to Peter's class, "Alright mewling quims" Tony learned that from Loki and Thor. "I'm afraid that we can't show you too much, there happens to be an evil pirate watching over us that could strike any minute, but if you have any questions feel free to ask," Tony said looking at the group at all the hands that shot up.
The clock struck 12 and Tony was still wrapped up in Steve's embrace, looking into his eyes and smiling.
"I, umm."
"Stark-Rogers" Peter was still weirded out by the fact that his teachers called him that. "and Flash! Get back to class!" Peter and flash went their separate ways while grumbling.
Natasha had red hair, the color of blood. A rare mix, symbolizing that she had strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love. Her hair was not blonde nor brown. The red symbolized that she was once forced to do things against her will, hurt people, but she never did anything reckless that caused an abomination.
"It's quite alright." Steve smiled his traditional Captian America smile that made all the ladies swoon.
"Th-thank you," Peter said. As he hugged Tony and Steve
Steve looked down.
Tony chuckled at the young reporter's antics, "Come out Peter!"
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
“Yes. If you would like,” Steve responded, practically crossing his fingers.
"You know that field trip we had to Stark Tower's?" The Avengers nodded. "Well we were walking through the science wing and I felt a sharp pain on my neck, I then reached up and there was like a Spider there and a bump." Peter shrugged.
Sorrryyyy that this is late! Also sorry, not sorry for the angst.
"It's been boring lately and your sex life is the only thing remotely interesting thing around this tower. Besides that time where Clint shot a nerf gun arrow at-" Natasha started to remember that time where Fury visited in the middle of a nerf gun fight.
"Me to son, good work"
“Shame, I would really like to see your work sometime,” Tony said, smiling at Steve.
Peter Stark-Rogers has been attending Midtown High through everything complicated in his life. When his aunt died, he relied on his friends Ned and MJ to basically get through the hard times and have a positive outlook. That's why when two of the world most famous superheroes adopted him he had to tell them first.
The man blushed, obviously aware of Tony's curious eyes.
"Nothing much," Steve responded shrugging. "Making a sandwich for Tony," He added, before looking to Natasha who had a small grin plastered on her face. "Ah," She replied, lifting an eyebrow.
"Yeah... sure" Peter chuckled and rolled his eyes. Oh god, this is gonna be a disaster.
When he arrived, the walls of the lab were practically thumping with the loud base of his rock music. Steve closed his eyes briefly, refusing to let the visions of war slide into his mind. He knocked on the door of the lab and when Tony didn't answer, presumably from not hearing him over the music, Steve looked up at the ceiling and asked JARVIS if he would kindly open the door for him.
"Robots?"
"Alright, class! As you can see these slips are for your parent to sign! In a week we will be having a field trip to Stark Towers thanks to Peter's dad who offered us a free tour!" The class was excited except for Peter, who obviously has been living at the tower for years and knew it inside and out. He could only imagine the weird shit that his family would do to embarrass him.
On the way out, the door of the studio Ms. Evanheart ambushed them with questions, and yes sure other channels did too, but her's stood out.
"Steve breathe" Tony insisted trying to calm his husband down.
"Steve... there are other things other than gay and straight.,
"I was just thinking, about you," Tony said taking a swig from a bottle of vodka.
"A-Alright, now that's everyone's here let's continue with the meeting," Phil said, flustered and awkward from seeing the two men practically eat each others faces off.
Steve laughed and fell on the bed with Tony underneath him.
Tony swam miles down the beach where the bored walk ended. There was a rumor if a merperson went onto shore they would grow legs, but it came with a cost. They would have to return to the sea within 12 hours, if not they would stay a human forever. No one had tried to do this before, everyone was afraid of the surface. There were shootings, muggings, hate, violence, it was too dangerous. Tony knew that not
"-son?"
Steve Rogers was a 31-year-old working at SHIELD tattoo parlor. He sat on his tattered old work chair leaning over his friend’s arm. “You know Stevie, you should go out there and find a nice someone.” The long-haired burette said.
Peter Stark- Rogers awoke at 6:50 am for school and by 'awoke', he put his alarm on snooze and went back to sleep.
"Where are you going?" Tony said confused.
"So Tommy, this is my son Peter."
"I'm gonna go -uh- check on him..." Tony said heading towards the direction of Steve's room.
----------------------
"No-No Captian Rogers, I just am shocked at all of this information." Tommy Johnson examined. "When did you two get together? And what child are we speaking of?"
I'm here, please, dad pops, save me I'm so scared.
Peter then grew confused, "won't everyone now know that I'm your son?"
"Tony."
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair

------------------
After the 'Everheart' episode, everyone was accepting (or too scared to speak against an angry Captian America), but they knew that Peter going back to school would be a disaster, to say the least.
"I'm real touch my fin," Tony said, waggling his eyebrows.
After the field trip, Peter still had to endure two more periods full of excruciating theories of Romeo and Juliet and a history test that seemed to last forever. Even throughout the two treacherous classes, Peter felt...different, stronger even. After school, when many rounds of Mario Cart and hours of homework were completed, he took a quick nap hoping that the strange feeling that the bite caused would go away.
The interview went well and Tommy was very supportive and kind to Peter, but they knew that some people (Aka religious assholes, as Clint called them) would not approve of their relationship. They did not, in fact, think that Tony's ex- Cristine Everheart, would try to embarrass them on national television.
Steve picked up Tony by his hips, carrying him towards the sofa. Tony smiled as he started to lift up Steve's shirt.
“Umm, I have to uh, go. Sorry for running into you." The man said and started walking past Tony.
"Yo! Buddy! Need some help there, come on hop in!" The driver yelled waving his hand at Tony. The cars and drivers around him honking and cursing.
Steve turned his head confused.
"So, I didn't catch your name," Tony said, looking into the man's eyes and taking a sip of his still hot coffee.
Steve looked into Tony's chocolate eyes and held his hands.
I'm as free as my hair
"Take a shower you smell awful."
“Like billionaire genius Tony Stark, Tony Stark?” Steve questioned. Tony nodded.
It was hardly normal at the Tower, instead of the obnoxious sounds of Clint and Thor playing Mario Cart, they all sat around the couch silently reading a book or silently playing cards; that was until Tony received a call.
"That's Pats! I will!" Peter said to the check-in lady Patsy, he knew her very well considering that his very close family lived on the top 10 floors.
"Anyway, yes the entire team knows that you two are having- what did you call it? Fondue." Wanda said snickering.
Authors Note: Please read!!!
"I'm so proud of you two!" Steve said kissing the top of Peter's head and wrapping his arms around Tony.
"Yes, you young man in the blue and green button down in the front."
"Why didn't you tell us?" Tony asked.
“You know I didn’t need your approval, or anything.”
"I don't even know what that indicates," Peter said exasperatedly.
Stay special ❤️
Tony looked up to see piercing blue eyes and a handsome face.
"I know that; excuse me for being a little worried that my son jumped 5 feet in mid-air and stuck  to the ceiling." Tony retaliated.
anywayyyy sorry for any grammar mistakes... Hang with me!
"These two men rescued me. They the world on a daily basis, but believe it or not without them who knows where I would be right now. I grew up in an orphanage, I never got to meet my parents, but I don't know anyone who would be more caring, respectful, spontaneous, and kind than my father's. Captian America and Iron Man are extremely brave, but not just because the risk their lives fighting bad every day. My pops came out of the ice, in a strange time where everyone he knew and loved died. My dad escaped torture and a kidnapping, but he still wanted to do what was right. Two years later, these two men found each other, and three years later they got married, after another two years, they went to the orphanage and received me. They not only helped people see peace but also equality. When my parents came out, many people hated them and told them that they aren't heroes anymore, but no matter how much hate they got, they proved that no matter what your sexuality or gender identity is, you are as equal as anyone else in this world. So as I'm standing here today, I would like to thank my parent's and the rest of the Avengers team, for teaching me to believe in myself, and do what is right."

When he was little, he knew that homosexuality was bad, so when he got his first girlfriend Peggy Carter he knew that he was cursed. He tried to force the sinful thoughts out of his head, he had Peggy beautiful smart and kick ass, Peggy. It never felt right though. Now he's hearing that all these years, that it was okay he couldn't help but smile and duck his head to continue on with his drawing.
“Yeah, yeah. ‘I’m busy and relationships are overrated,’” Clint said patting Steve on the back as he returned back to his station. Steve looked down at the card in his hand and sighed. “Nat, I have to make a call,” He said as he passed her on the way out the door of the shop. “Go get him, tiger!” She said as he heard Clint say to Natasha, “I can’t wait to tell Buck,”. Steve shook his head as he called Tony’s number.
Tony blinked. "What I want?"
Challenge: No Challenge
“Love stories often are,” Steve replied with a cheeky smile.
Challenge: No Challenge
"What is that?" Anthony whispered.
“Whereas look at me? I’m so sleep-deprived I have no idea what day of the week it is, my skincare routine for the past three months has mostly consisted of projectile baby oatmeal, and my husbands are so exhausted, I can’t get a solid roll in the hay to save my life. Not that I have the energy for it.”
Square: No Powers
"I… don't know what that means," Steve laughed. "Don't be embarrassed though. It's really nice to have a regular. Gets lonely out there with all those people walking by. Seriously." He reached out and hooked a knuckle under Tony's chin, drawing his face up again. "Don't be embarrassed."
Steve snorted. “I have to agree. I can’t wait to wake up next to my husband tomorrow.”
Steve’s hand clenched on Tony’s shoulder. “I have some ideas."

"I did. He said, 'It'd be weird with Tony right there watching me. Ask someone else.'"
“Your birthday isn’t for another two weeks,” Steve said, not pulling his eyes away from where Bucky gyrated.
Tony crossed his arms. "I asked first."
Forehead is stock still for a heartbeat and then he collapses in on himself like a dying star, crying out and slamming his hands down over his balls in a satisfyingly amusing reflection of the position they’d caught Tony in.

He tugged the other earphone out too hard and winced, stuttering to a stop. His dog stopped too, gazing up at him adoringly. “Hi… Sir,” he said. And Steve gave up on there being any chance he hadn’t just been recognized. Teens these days only called him Sir if they’d played with his action figures as kids.
Steve popped open the case and his eyebrows shot up. “Wow. These are beautiful. Thank you.”
his mom had said to him, every time he’d asked what it was like.
Bucky was in the kitchen in nothing but his boxers, and Steve was already back in his shorts and t-shirt. Tony handed Steve the shoes. “Found these in the closet.”
“Have a nice run, Stevie.” Bucky snuggled down, legs tangled with Tony’s.

"Yup." Tony popped the "p."
Tony shot him a look. "They were most definitely filming that. They were scientists, studying us, did you not notice?"
"Oh, huh. Guess I never thought about that before."
JARVIS redirected all his available resources to his logic processes, cross-referenced previous activity by both Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers with body language and tonal reference materials, comparing already recorded data with -
“Yeah.” Tony stretched out long on the bed like a cat then curled up against Steve’s side. He smelled good, like sweat and his cologne. They’d been dating for a few weeks, starting out as actually dating, then graduating into kissing, and finally this - falling into bed together. It felt good, right, safe, but Steve had been expecting to get dressed and go with a goodnight kiss.
"You're wet and freezing, and you clearly need someone to talk to. Come to the student centre with me. Let me buy you Starbucks, please?"
Tony shuddered through his release, chest heaving against Steve's. He waited for the tentacles to being their rhythmic rocking again but the tendril hooked around his shoulder stretched across his chest and then more and more of them were moving. Tony cried out in surprise when Steve was pulled away from him, the places their bodies were connected ripped apart. He clutched at Steve's hand, but the tentacles merely slithered up between their palms and worked their fingers loose.

Tony gaped at him for a long time in complete silence. “You -” He didn’t seem mad anymore, just stunned which Steve took to be a move in the right direction.
“God, I feel like robbing a bank,” Tony said, bouncing along at Steve’s side.

“Yeah.” Steve reached up to wrap his fingers around Tony’s wrist. His thumb snuck into the gap between Tony’s glove and his sleeve and he rubbed the pad over Tony’s soulmark, soothing the ache. “SHIELD gave me a house in the twenty-first century, but you’re the one who gave me a home.”
“Of course. It’s just an adjustment period. We’ll get there.” Tony tipped his chin up and pressed a kiss to Steve’s lips then led him into the apartment and shut the door.

Oh shit.
“But he loves him so much that sometimes he thinks he might burst with it, and he’s not sure he can hold it in anymore.”

Steve opened his eyes and smiled at Tony. He was folded over the car door, smirking at Steve in a way that never failed to make his blood heat. There were grease marks on his arms and Steve couldn’t pull his gaze away from them. “That’s Captain to you, Mr. Stark.”
"Yeah, yeah." Steve couldn't meet Bucky's eye. "You know I hate being useless. I want to contribute. Like you do."
As Tony turned the watch in his hands, something occurred to him. The watch should be with the man it reminded him of. Then, maybe, it would make him think of Tony the way Tony thought of him. “You should have it.”
“You are. I want this.” Tony tipped back into Steve’s arms.
“About as much as I ever have.” Tony’s eyebrow quirked up, a long with a smirk that was Steve’s only warning before he was rolling up to his feet and charging across the mats towards Steve. “Not at all.”
Tony nodded. At this point, he was pretty sure he’d follow this man anywhere, was excited to start.
“I was hoping I could get your help with something. I got your name from my publisher, Steve Rogers. He’s friends with Natasha.”
Nat&Tony
Steve gasped as Tony’s throat contracted around his cock again. He twitched but the tentacles wound around him prevented him from moving. It was almost a relief, now, because his self control was so dental floss thin that without the restraint he was worried he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from fucking down Tony’s throat.

Steve struggled his way through the pushed back chairs to the Ultimates’ table, in need of a break from all the people, but when he got there, Tony’s seat next to his was occupied, and not by Tony.
Starkbucks Bingo Square: G1 - Misunderstandings
Tony fiddled with his cufflinks again. They were tiny circles of bright blue sapphire, encased in a web of white gold. A gift from his mother. He had a matching pair in a case that was currently digging into his thigh, the hard corners ruining the line of his pants. He tugged the case out, opened it, then closed it again and put it back in his pocket.
Besides, it was the middle of winter. No one should be out in the cold tonight.
Tony had smiled back. “Still don’t like you, Cap, but I guess I begin to see your use.”
“Just a little more -”
Steve brushes himself off then wipes his sleeve over his face, smearing blood and dirt from his upper lip straight back to his ear. He shrugs. “I’m fine. You?”
“We’re not popular enough to have groupies,” Rhodey shot back.
“Sure, sure,” Tony said. He set his notebook down and peered in the fox’s mouth.
“Steve, look,” Tony started, leaning over the back of the couch. “I -” He cut-off when his eyes fell on Natasha, hidden on the floor in front of the couch. She sat at Steve’s feet, working bright blue polish over his toenails. “Uh. Hi, Nat.”
Greg laughed lightly while Steve scanned the crowd for a particular head of dark hair, and he let out a soft, involuntary sigh when he found it.
“Surely that’s better than lumpy.”
And at the centre was the most beautiful grand piano Steve had ever seen. He didn’t know much about them, but it was clear this one was expensive, old, and incredibly well cared for.
“No,” Tony said, dropping his hand to wind his fingers with Steve’s. “It really hasn’t. Memories mean consequences, darling. I’m not going to pretend it doesn’t matter today what you said yesterday.”
She coloured prettily. “Oh god, just Laura, please.”
"We love you too." Tony stood up and leaned over to kiss Bucky's cheek. "I'm going to pop up to my study to answer some of these emails and stop my students from hyperventilating. I'm sure it'll be all over Tik Tok either way, but I'll put out whatever fires I can. You are going to finish showing Steve what I'm sure was a lovely time, and then start drafting your explanation for Thursday's class." Tony reached out and gave Steve's wrist a squeeze. "If he has a meltdown, put him to bed and come play chess with me."
Tony sighs. “I can’t, not really. But if science works the way I think it does, you’ll understand one day. Let’s just say… I’m from out of town. And the clothes thing wasn’t my idea.”
“I’ll cut him loose,” Steve said immediately.
“You’re not fooling anyone, Tony,” came Steve’s low rumble in reply. There was a smile in his voice, though, so Tony grinned and shifted around, spreading his legs wider and pulling his arms taut so his back arched prettily.
In the morning, Tony was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and so grateful to find Steve in his bed that Steve forgave him for the hard night that wasn’t really his fault.
"She - uh…" Steve trailed off. "She took my powers then showed me the scariest part of being weak."
Tony stuttered for a moment then found his tongue. “No. Sorry. I was just window shopping.”
Now Tony could never go back to the market where they’d met, didn’t know how he could ever hold someone’s hand again without feeling the dull pain of
“They caught you kissing on camera, almost certainly.” Tony rubbed his towel through his hair while shooting off a few more texts.
brother,” he shot back. “I told mom I wanted a goldfish. Guess he’s about as bright.”
But instead of slapping him, the man started laughing. He reached out and took Tony's wallet back. He flicked it open and slid one of Tony's business cards out of one of the slots. "My name is Bucky." He produced a pen from somewhere. "The sexy Dorito over there is Steve." He scribbled a phone number down on the card and slid it back in Tony's wallet, then handed it back. "And tryouts are whenever you want."
Steve nodded. Thankfully, gone were the days when Steve would just push him away and disappear. Now, he let Tony in. In some ways, it was worse, because there was one more step Tony wanted to take and he wasn't sure if he could. He could wait though. "That wasn't fun. But I'm okay. You?"
Tony shrugged. "My dad made you sound like the coolest guy on the planet. Can you blame me?"
Saliva: Water. electrolytes, mucopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, thiocyanate, hydrogen peroxide, and secretory immunoglobulin, enzymes, various human cells (note: run DNA analysis), opiorphin (possible uses?), haptocorrin. Trace amounts of an unknown compound. File for further study.
"Yes, sir."
Tony gave him a careful once-over and something shifted in his gaze. “You should be a corporate spy. People pay good money for attention to detail like that.”
They laughed cruelly, and Tony let himself slide back into Steve’s arms, into false memories and fake love and illusory touches.
“Why not? It’s self-powered now, doesn’t need the arc reactor -” his fingers drummed against his chest “- and it can adjust to fit pretty much anyone. Even your statistically improbable shoulders should be accomodated.”

When Clint came down a few hours later, he pulled out his phone. Steve heard Tony’s voice through the speaker. “Thanks, man!” Clint said.
A new wave of pleasure surged up and peaked, holding, and Tony kicked his hips back and forth harder, chasing it. It didn’t break, building and building this time. “Oh fuck, Steve, yes, god, I’m going to come, please, please
A noise on stage snapped Steve's attention away from people watching, and he waited eagerly while Bucky's band took the stage. Sam was on keys, Bucky on sax, and Natasha sung. Steve had heard them play, of course, but never at The Dollhouse, and rarely when they could really let go instead of keeping it down so as not to wake the neighbour's baby from her midday nap, and Steve was excited to see them show off as they were meant to.

Tony looked around them. "Don't you need to… um. Hug?"
"They hurt you," Steve growled.
The Dollhouse was about five blocks from their apartment, its front entrance actually down an alley behind a funeral parlour and through the back door into the basement. Bucky knocked four times in a sharp rhythm, and the door cracked, then a moment later swung all the way open. "This is my buddy," Bucky said to the goliath who was bouncing the door. "Steve. Steve this is Thor."
That’s the last of your stuff at my place. If you still have anything of mine, you can throw it out.

Tony stood, smiling softly and walked back towards the kitchen then stopped. He looked at his watch, swore quietly then headed for the door instead, his snack forgotten. Thor called out before he could disappear completely. “Tony!”
Steve ducked his chin then rolled his eyes back up at Tony slyly. “Maybe. Or first night as the owners of multiple dogs.”

The water spilled over the edge of the carafe, and Tony swore. He half-expected Steve to offer to do it for him. Tony always got clumsy when his hormones peaked, and Steve used to gently pry things out of his hands and take over, shooing him away to sit down. For some reason, the fact that Steve stayed where he was, didn’t say a word, while Tony argued with the coffee maker was what made a knot pinch painfully in his chest.
The room fell silent, and Steve burrowed closer. Tony was warm and all around him and Rowdy was breathing steadily at his feet. He felt safe, undeniable safe, and even though the couch cushions were no Tempurpedic, and they hadn’t quite figured out the thermostat so it was a few degrees too cold, and Steve knew he was going to wake up in the night, needing to pee, but not able to find the bathroom in the maze of boxes in the dark, it was perfect.
A click from the front door stopped Tony in his tracks.
“I can fix it!” Tony insisted.
Tony didn’t look up from the floor. The heat under his skin crackled hotter now, almost painful. He could do it alone, he’d done it before. Before Steve. When he’d come back from Afghanistan and the doctors had told him he couldn’t take the suppressants anymore. He’d managed, he always had. But with Steve… with Steve it hadn’t felt like a curse anymore. It’d felt like a blessing, that they got to share that. A perfect excuse to spend three days wrapped up in each other and say “fuck off” to the world.
He startled up again, lashing out as soon as he realized his arms were free for the first time in hours, but his flailing met nothing but hard tile. He looked around and realized that he was back in the tower, sprawled on the shower room floor. The tentacles were gone, but the crack in the tile next to his hand assured him that all of it had really happened. That, and the way his entire body was still thrumming.
“There is someone at the door downstairs, sir,” the AI helpfully informed him. “I was trying something new.”
Rating: E
“So…” Tony said, voice low and just for them, “about that dinner…”
As Steve and Sir Gropes-A-Lot snuggled up together, Tony hit his limit. He stood up and made for the kitchen, as if he was getting more popcorn, then slipped out the door to the back stairs and trotted up to the landing pad.
“Hey, Steve?” Tony asked.
“This has been the best year of my life, falling in love with you,” Tony said, eyes going bright. “I don’t want it to end.”

Bucky stared at Steve long enough that he started feeling nervous.
“That’s fine.” Nat sighed then rolled onto her back and stretched. “I think I just want to go to sleep after all. You know how sometimes it all catches up with you at once?”
But he hadn’t been the one to find Cap, Batman had. The new Batman. His hadn’t been the first hand Steve had shaken in the future, Batman’s had. Even with Bruce Wayne dead and gone, Cap was still in love with Batman and Tony would never be anything, never be noticed by him.
"Yes…"
“Why wouldn’t I? Turns out you
[12:23] Steve: Tony pick up.
“Sorry, sweetheart, I told Nat she had me all afternoon. It’ll have to be another time.”
"Okay." Steve hooked under his armpits and hauled Tony to his feet which just put the two of them chest-to-chest, naked and - was that patriotism in Steve's complete lack of pockets or was he -? "Steve… you could… I mean, if the drug is still having an effect on you… We could…."

“You can tell me, Steve. Come on. I worry about you, darling.”
“Can we - I dunno, wild thought, but - can we play some damn music?” Rhodey said, emphasizing his point with reverberating A minor chord.
"Seems like it. You know he'll wake up if we try and move him."
“I’ll go if you want me to,” he said again.
Steve didn’t say anything, but Tony could
he didn’t add.
"You sure?"
"Um." Steve blinked. "I had a question about this computer…"
Mr. Stark looked up from where he sat on the couch, Captain Rogers asleep on his shoulder, and smiled. His fingers squeezed a little where they were entwined with Captain Rogers'. "Thanks, J."

Tony snaked his arm around Steve’s waist and squeezed, then shifted his hand up to curl over Anthony’s back. “Hmm, Junior gets to have the prime chest real estate. Hardly seems fair.”
Steve blinked at him. “Why?”
“Do you know what would be amazing?” Steve said, stretching his arm across Tony’s stomach to hook Bucky’s hip.
“What?!”
Steve burst into a beautiful grin, like a firework going off. "Alright. Guess we’ll just have to get back together then.”
There was a heavy pause. “Yeah.” Steve picked his fork up again and stuck it in the eggs. “I do.”

For the first time since becoming a fairy godfather, Steve had a wish of his own.
Maybe things weren't so bad, after all.
This call was going to be hard to get through.
The guys considered him for a moment with obvious amusement. “Alright. I’m Steve by the way.”
Steve started to speak, but Tony’s lips closed around the head of his cock and he sucked lightly, swirling his tongue over the slit. All words evaporated from Steve’s brain. He fixed his eyes on the road and tried to remember to breathe. How on earth was this his life right now?
he says again, with feeling. Cool air draws goosebumps on his skin.
Tony’s not interested in explaining his current predicament to anyone. Still, the cat within him can’t resist sating its curiosity, and he peeks around the corner of the alleyway only to find himself two inches from a broad chest covered in a stained navy button-up under a rough denim jacket.
“I don’t think it’s dumb at all,” Tony whispers, breath catching in his throat. “I’m glad I didn’t scare you, that I could be that for you.”
“It really was.” Steve stood when Tony did, but before he could slip away, Steve hooked his elbow and pulled him into another hug, warm and tight.  “I’m sorry about your friend who died.” Tony squeezed, burrowing into Steve and splaying his hands out flat on his back. They hung there, neither pulling away.

The sexual tension was ruined when Fury interrupted, "Stark, because this is Captian Rogers' first day on base I would like you to show him the ropes, and I'm not giving you a choice." Fury commanded.
"No fucking way!" MJ said a bit too loudly.
Steve looked up from Peter's sleeping form at his teammates, "His physical injuries are almost healed, but he is still in a coma"
"That would be amazing Mr. Stark! And I think our viewers would like to meet him too!"
After a heartbeat, he turned around.
"an-you-er-me?"
Fell free to comment thanks for reading!!
"PETER WHY ARE YOU ON THE CEILING!"
Hey guys! so based off of my friends, personal opinion, and comments spideypool won...
Two years later:
Steve jumped up, out of breath.
In the end, Peter decided that he wouldn't tell his fathers. The truth is, that, Peter always felt left out with his family. His Uncle, Fater, and Aunt didn't have any actual superpowers theoretically, but they still could save the world and help people for the greater good. Peter hoped that with these powers, maybe just maybe, he could be like his family and become a hero; maybe some sort of... friendly neighborhood hero.
"I know you are, but please let me help you," Tony said with a smirk.
"Captian, I presume you've heard about the tesseract?"
“No, I don’t really draw as much anymore,” Steve shrugged.
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes... I'm still in school and this story is not overviewed or edited by someone... i am forever alone... anyway enjoy...?
"He will get better honey, you'll see he's strong, he can get through this." Steve heard a sniffle from his husband, and then a knock on the door to the hospital room.
Steve coughed nervously, "what my husbands trying to say, is that we're Peter's new adoptive parents."
"Oh, you know you love me," Tony said.
Tony floated there in the ocean, missing Steve already. He lost everyone; it was past his birthday, he hadn't killed a human yet, he couldn't go home. He needed to find Steve. There was a spark when he felt Steve's touch when they talked it was easy and simple like they had known each other forever.
the world was like that, Steve seemed kind, polite civilized. Tony trusted him.
"Anything you want Peter, but..." Steve hesitated while looking at Tony.
-------------------
Tony liked it.
"I woke up early for this!"
Merpeople lived in the deep Atlantic Ocean out of sight of mankind, safe. Once a mermaid reached 25 they had to choose a human to exterminate, to serenade and drown in the depths of the sea. Anthony Stark,  a merman who was living off of the East Coast was nearing his 25th birthday. His father and mother had prepared and told him much about what was to come; pick a human, lure them into the sea. Easy. Well...maybe not.
Steve when you get home can I talk to u about something
"Hey, Parker or is it Stark-Rogers or Rogers-Stark which one of your dads put it in any way!" Flash yelled the literal second that Peter arrived at school.
"Thanks pops," Peter said glowing with pride.
"Mr. Stark if you would please come to the hospital immediately, it's about your son, he's awake."
———————
The End.
Authors Note please read:
At this point, Peter's class and teacher were looking at him in awe, still obviously getting used to the fact that he was the adopted son of two superheroes.
------------------------------------------
“I never ask questions, why don’t you ask him yourself,” She said and walked away to take care of a customer. Clint looked at Steve and shrugged, “Idk man, you should call him though. You need someone,” Steve sighed,
“You built an AI?” Steve said in shock.
They both got the best sleep they had in a while.
"ete?"
The driver just smiled and drove off leaving Tony on the porch of Steve's apartment complex.
"Yes?"
Natasha chuckled, "Not many people know this but Tony is hella gay, or bisexual I guess cause of Pepper, but anyway I once found him jerking off to a picture of Chris Evans. I sometimes wonder if that's because he looks so much like you,"
Fury ignored him,"Stark as director of SHIELD I would like to introduce Steve Rogers also known as Captain America, born on July 4th, 1918 he..."
"oooooo so there is someone".
"Are you going to tell him how you feel?" She questioned, causing Steve to freeze.
——————————-
The next morning, Steve grumbled and cursed after he checked his phone to see that he was late for work. He quickly changed into his leather jacket he wore the night before and grey jeans and slipped out of bed. After the two-block walk to SHIELD, he was greeted by Natasha’s raised eyebrows and flaming red hair. “Where were you?” She asked, walking behind the check-in counter. “He was probably doing his midnight fucks again,” His friend, Clint, chipped in. Natasha rolled her eyes at their friend’s antics, “Next time don’t be late, yeah?” Steve nodded his head and headed back to his station checking his schedule. Clint came up to him and chuckled, “So who was it this time? Do I know him?” Steve rolled his eyes and searched his jacket for Tony’s business card and gave it to Clint. “No shit,” Clint said. “Nat isn’t this your weird guy?” Soon Nat came over and read Tony’s name. “Tony and that’s his number, yeah. Weird,” Steve looked at them confused, “Huh?” Nat shrugged,
"I love you," Steve said grabbing Tony's hand and pulling him close. Tony rested his head on Steve's broad shoulder, "I love you too."
Whenever he decided to take a risk and venture out of the lab up to his room and try to sleep, he had JARVIS play white noise while he (attempted) to sleep. Tony wasn't sure if it bothered Pepper if it was another reason why their relationship didn't work. He knew that she didn't like the noise, she had asked him to turn it off while they were together, back then he just agreed and either slept in the lab or not at all. After the Avengers moved in, there was never quiet, it was always busy and wherever he went there was someone there, Clint on the countertop, Steve on the couch, Nat in the gym.
"Spider-Man behind you!" Steve called out to his son who was about to be slammed into the ground by a bot.
Stay special ❤
Steve let out a shaky sigh and ran his fingers through his hair. He exited the bathroom and looked around the shop once before he left to return to his apartment. Steve locked the door and headed out into the crisp darkness of the night. He shuddered and stuck his cold hands in the pockets of his jeans. He turned down Park Avenue until he heard a yell. Steve shook his head and continued his way, not bothering to even turn towards the sound. That was until he heard the pounding of footsteps behind him, and a medium size figure bumped into him in a grunt. He squinted his eyes to search out the face of the figure in front of him. “Hey buddy do you mind moving outta the way, I’m kinda trying to be kidnapped now.” The what appeared to be man said frantically trying to move around Steve. Steve awkwardly moved out of the way, so the man could pass. “Thanks, bye now,” The man said, patting Steve on the shoulder and speed away into the darkness. The blonde shook his head out of confusion and continued down the street. After a few freezing cold minutes, Steve returned to the front door of his apartment and stepped inside the warmth. He took off his jacket and shoes and plopped down on his old tattered creaky couch. Letting out a sigh he grabbed the remote and proceeded to flip through random channels. After finding absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining to watch, he turned and checked the time, 12:47 am. He stood up and wondered to his bed, taking off his shirt, socks, and pants, he settled in and turned off the light.
"Steve. You?"
Yes, Tony Stark may have just fallen in love.
Peter smiled as he embraced his fathers'.
"You mean...?"
"Come on!"
"And plus the only thing I was shocked about was the fact that Starks a bottom," Clint smirked.
Tony was having a great day until Fury called him into his office.
"I can still go to my old school, right? Midtown high?" Peter questioned.
“Sure Tony, sure.”
"Alright everyone remember parent-teacher conference next week! Peter, Harry, Johnny, and Luke remember your parents still need to sign up!" Peters teacher reminded the class.
Stay Special xoxo
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes... I'm still in school and this story is not overviewed or edited by someone... i am forever alone... anyway enjoy
The Avengers were all close now, and we're basically family. After many near-death experiences, they grew closer and cherished their annual Friday night movie nights.
"AHHHHHHH!!!" Peter yelled, and unexpectantly jumped onto the ceiling.
"So like...who tops out of you and Captian Rogers, cause I mean, Mr. Steve is obviously better but-"

Steve looked at Fury, "You should've kept it in the ocean." Steve was not in the mood for this, he met Tony and he truly liked him and now SHIELD was recruiting him for this team. He just wanted to see Tony again. He packed up his bag and started to head out of the gym past Fury.
"Jarvis! Come on man!" Tony sighed.
"Considering I'm hallucinating about seeing a
Tony thought. Had Steve been awake when he brushed the hair from the soldier's face?
Tony started to answer Tommy's questions, "We got together two months after the battle of New York, and Mr. Johnson how about we let you meet our son yourself?" Tommy looked like he could faint.
"Peter's awake"
"Only alcoholics use glasses. I can stop drinking if I want to." Tony said shrugging, Tony felt a small scar develop on his lower hip.
"Language," Steve interjected.
"GaydarPep. gaydar." Tony responded.
_I don't own anything except the gaynes_
Tony nodded.
"Mr. Stak, Captian, you are now allowed to see your son." The nurse interrupted with a solemn look on her face.
"PETER!" A voice suddenly yelled from behind Peter's sleeping form.
Yes, Tony Stark was bisexual.
Peter was in awe his room was so...him. It was a light blue color with a king size bed, white shelves, a full closet, and a large desk with a laptop and a microscope.
Peter couldn't move, he was a prisoner in his own body. He needed to open his eyes, he needed to tell his family that he was okay.
After a short drive, they got to the restaurant. “Two please,” Steve requested, as they were lead to their table. “Wow, this is really nice,” Tony commented as he looked around the fancy restaurant. Steve shrugged, “So tell me about yourself, Tony,”
"So, where you headed?" The driver asked.
"Come on Steve gimme something good I can shoot at!" Clint exclaimed.

Steve broke the kiss, his forehead resting on Tony's.
Authors Note:
"Oh hi, Peter!  Here's your badge, say hi to your dad's for me!"
"Alright! That concludes the tour now please exit to you-"
"We are never letting you go into battle again!" Steve said feeling a grateful tear rolling down his cheek.
He couldn't wait for next week.
Bruce had dark hair, not because he was reckless or immature. He was paying for the damage the Hulk had created.
"Just this...person who moved to my school recently, they were my roommate at the orphanage, I guess he got adopted."
"Hello" Tony greeted the human. Simple, sweet, to the point. Just as his mother told him.
"You're an idiot," Steve said affectionately.
"Steve..."
In the beginning of time, a method was created to keep those who lie pure. A scar would develop on the body of someone who lies, marking them forever. The bigger the lie the deepest the scar.
"WHY DID YOU WAKE ME UP!"
Peter coughed trying to focus back on the suit, "How about red and blue? A little red from your suit, and blue from pops' suit." The teen said looking up from his work on his new web shooters his father helped him design.
"So, umm. Can we maybe talk?"
Tony smirked, "I am currently married to a member of the Avengers".
He was about to order another when he looked across the bar into the eyes of a handsome man. He smirked and winked at the man, wondering if he was reading the signals correctly. The handsome man smirked back and stood up, soon he scooted next to Steve. “This music’s a little loud you think? Want to go somewhere… quieter?” The man asked Steve, licking his lips. Steve recognized that voice. Was it the man who ran into Steve earlier? Steve shook his and offered a hand to the man and they headed outside. The un-named man smashed his lips into Steve’s, the warmth erupted through Steve’s body as he gripped onto the man’s sides. Steve fumbled for his phone and called an Uber, they soon crashed into the back seat, the man’s hand on Steve’s crotch. Steve bit his lip and struggled to contain himself the way to his apartment. Steve took the man’s hand and let him into his apartment. “Tony,” The man said, sticking a hand out to Steve. “Steve,” Steve responded, taking the man’s hand.
Steve smiled and took his shirt and jeans off, climbing into Tony's bed. Tony did the same, the bright light of the arc reactor lighting up his room.
"This is the only other room on our floor. Down the hall to the right that's my and Tony's room, Natasha is on the 18th floor, Clint on the 19th, Wanda, and Vision on the 20th and Bruce basically lives on the lab. Oh, and Thor goes between Asgard and here so he doesn't have a room." Steve explained.
"Alright Midtown! Let's start the tour!" The tour guide interrupted the silence, obviously wanting to get this tour done so he can end his shift.
"Because my sexy body and irresistible charm are making you attracted to me?"
"What happens if SHIELD wants to disband the Avengers?"
Peters advisor finally looked up from her file. "O-o  i-I'm  s-s-sorry?" Peters advisor stuttered obviously nervous about meeting the world two most famous superheroes.
"Here you can see the prototype of the arc reactor that Mr. Stark created, this small device can fuel the entire tower and Mr. Stark is still discovering new ways to make this device even stronger!" The class looked at the device looking anxious, most of them just hoped to meet the Avengers.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter and his class ventured into the main science wing when Peter felt a small, but painful bite on his neck. He smacked what looked liked to be a spider and shrugged, he could ask Bruce or his dad later.
"PETER!" Tony screamed seeing the same thing his husband was.
"Hmmzghh."
"What your Pops means is that next time I'm making you a new suit that will 10000000000% guarantee that you will not get hurt ever again," Tony said kissing his son's forehead.
Tony may have just been anxious or overly worn out, but when he was holding Peter's hand, he could've sworn that he felt a faint squeeze.
After hours of exhausting paperwork Steve and Tong we're finally able to bring Peter home for their trial period as his parents.
“I would love that,” Tony responded.
"Whatever! Anyway, we've been going out for coffee every morning!" Tony exclaimed.
"Ok... oops look at that the Avenger's emergency... coming through our... invisible coms," Tony said glaring at Clint who (still was wrapped in toilet paper) was rolling on the floor cracking up with laughter.
"I have a room?"
Tony started to get up and go to the Capitan, "Nice to meet you Capsicle" Tony said while shaking Steve's hand.
"So everyone I have called this team meeting to discuss-" Steve started.
The man took off his glasses, "Steve?" He exclaimed, mirroring the shock.
——————-
They wondered over to the boy.
"Anything," Steve said, cupping Tony's face.
---------------
"But what?" Peter asked.
паук is spider in Russian (I mean I think it is, don't sue me I'm using google translate).
“Hey, at least Chris Evans hot, Captain America is a little too stuck up for my tastes,” Steve responded. “Anyway, I was hoping on going to this really good steak place if you’re up for it?”
Tony drove to Starbucks. He was supposed to meet Pepper there for talk about the company, or something. Tony wanted to just have the meeting at the mansion, but Pepper insisted that he needed to get out for once. Tony turned the wheel of his Porche down the street, he was blasting AC/DC and had run a few red lights. He drove down the street just a little further and turned into the parking lot. Tony opened the door dramatically, strolling in with his shades looking for Pepper. When he didn't see her, he pulled out his phone to text her when he was bumped into.
"It's my 25th birthday. On a merpersons 25th birthday they have to find a person to sacrifice, to drown. I found you and-"
"A-a-as I was saying I would like to discuss a few things about Peter..."
"You're amazing Tony, don't be ashamed of your scars. You are one of the smartest, and bravest people I know." Tony found Steve when he was frozen. Iron Man wasn't Steve's hero, Tony was.
"Tony yes"
Hey guys... so the next chapter I post (probably tonight because again I have no life) is going to be the last chapter! +
The boy reached out shyly.
They all stayed in each other's arms for a while, silently whispering 'I love you' to each other, not even think that there was a small chance that Peter could've died.
"Alright, class stay together!" Peter's teacher yelled, trying to calm down her animalistic students.  They were heading to the interior of Stark Tower and stuck at check-in due to Peter's large class size.
Steve nodded as he kissed Tony on his cheek and ruffled Peter's hair.
I am my hair
When Peter arrived back in class his teacher was handing out permission slips.
Hours later, Steve heard a knock on his door. He scampered to get up and opened the door to reveal Tony’s dark hazel eyes looking him up and down. Steve was wearing dark blue skinny jeans that hugged his ass perfectly, and a tight white T-shirt that made Tony’s mouth water. “Well hello there,” Tony said, which made Steve burst out laughing, “Hey! Don’t laugh at me! It’s not my fault you’re unbelievably hot,” Steve shook his head and grabbed Tony’s hand. “So, Mr. America-” Steve raised an eyebrow at that. “You know… Captain America the comic book character? You kind of look like him or a younger Chris Evans,” Tony said.
"As you can see, the Avengers haven't been really busy lately and we are taking this time for R&R." A loud voice chuckled exiting the elevator behind Peter's class.
"That's just superb Captain, so what do you say about getting some coffee?" Tony said hoping that Steve would say yes.
"Good, I wasn't willing to put up with your shenanigans today," Fury added.
