"Come inside with me?" Cas leaned in and kissed him slowly, and Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' shoulders, his lips parting on a soft groan.
That seemed to be the reaction Cas wanted, because he growled approvingly and did it again, and again, until he was tonguing at Dean’s hole enthusiastically, drilling it into his body and sucking at his tender skin. Dean mewled, barely able to squirm in the tightly bound vest, but giving it his all as Cas tormented him. Finally, at some unknown signal, Cas straightened from his body, licking his lips and then swallowing down his own fingers, tonguing between them lewdly as Dean looked over his shoulder, leaving two of them dripping. Drawing those fingertips over Dean’s exposed cheek and down his cleft, he soaked them again and traced feather-light over Dean’s hole, making him squirm and sigh and then moan as first one fingertip then a second breached him. Cas curved his fingers expertly, finding his sweet spot in no time and rubbing over it with the pads of his fingers until Dean was crying out, shaking and fisting his hands in the pillow under his head.
"Dean," Cas growled, pinning him again, his brow lowered and his expression stern.
Come find me on Tumblr, Imbiowaresbitch
“Home? I like the sound of that,” Cas told him, his voice low and caressing.
"C-Cas," Dean stuttered, his hands fisting in the sheets as Cas' big hands roamed over his thighs. "C'mon, angel, don't tease me…"
Cas rolled his eyes and poked and pushed Dean until he was curled up against Cas' side, his head on Cas' chest.
Dean shrank in on himself for a moment, then nodded. Cas pulled his distressed Omega into his lap, and tucked him against his chest, so Dean’s face was curled in against his throat.
“That’s right, you have a sister, too?” Dean asked, cuddling back into his Alpha’s chest. “Anna doesn't sound like an angel name, though James doesn't either, now that I think about it.”
"Dean, I'm sorry. We said we'd share, and I'm sitting here stuffing my face. Have some," Cas offered, pushing the plate a little closer. Dean shook his head, glancing down to his own, a perfect slice of cherry pie. Lyrics floated through his mind, and he ducked his head, hoping to disguise his flushed cheeks with culinary delight.
He sucked a dark bruise onto Dean’s throat, then reached over the side of the bed for the leather cuffs. He looped them through the rails of the headboard, and locked the first one around Dean’s wrist.
he moaned softly, only to see Cas' pupils widen slightly. He dropped his gaze to his plate and took another bite of his cherry pie to give himself a moment.
Dean sobbed a hard-won breath, desperate and aching as Cas massaged his prostate again before withdrawing his fingers, then let out a groan of pure, unadulterated relief as he felt Cas tugging on the laces of his vest. He’d been in it now for something like fourteen hours, and the first deep breath was euphoric. A second later the breath was knocked out of him as Cas pressed into him with a well-lubed cock, the stretch and burn of it, so so sweet. Cas let out a guttural groan, stilling as he bottomed out, then drew back slowly, the click of the lube’s cap sounding as he drizzled more over his cock and pressed in again. Dean whined at the cold touch, at the fullness, feeling as though he was being split deliciously in two by Cas’ scorching hot girth. Finally able to move, he rolled his hips back and took Cas deeper, moaning as Cas twitched deeply inside him, the feeling so immediate and erotic that it took him a moment to understand.
He nipped at Cas' throat for a moment, leaving a faint mark that started to fade even as he watched. That wouldn't work. Dropping his mouth to Cas' throat, he mouthed over his skin to his pulse; then Dean set to leaving a big, dark bruise, sucking and biting until Cas was squirming against him, the press of his arousal obvious against Dean's.
was that?
Dean cast his eyes around the bar, looking for a likely pickup. Two months earlier he'd broken up with his latest boyfriend, if he could even be called that, and needed an outlet. Cole had been bad news, constantly picking fights and unfaithful to boot. After an embarrassing but necessary conversation with his doctor, a round of antibiotics, and an admonishment to use condoms going forward, Dean was back in the field.
Gratuitous smut.
growl sounded behind him, and he laughed as he sprinted for their room.
Prepare for much smut.
He took a deep breath, feeling his pulse accelerate as a whine caught in his throat. He wanted his mate, but Cas wouldn’t be home for two hours. He eyed the drawer again, trying to decide, when his glance fell on the thick cuffs and the blindfold. He grabbed them and tossed them on the bed, then quickly reached in and scooped up the nipple clamps, connected by a delicate, silvery chain. He closed the drawer, then pulled it open again, and grabbed a black silk scarf. He ran it through his fingers, then, blushing slightly, down over his chest. He gasped at the sensation, feeling his skin pebble and his nipples tighten. He glanced at the nipple clamps, and was sorely tempted to try them out. His nipples were incredibly sensitive, and he knew he’d love them. Instead he carefully wrapped his selections in the silk scarf, tying a bow with a grin, and setting it all on Cas’ pillow.
“Cas, we didn't even know yet,” Dean argued.
A tall, slender blond man appeared from the back, and rolled his eyes. “Now Gabby, that's no way to speak of me. Cassie is apparently leaving early, so if you want my help closing, you'd do well not to insult me.”
It felt like hours that Cas tortured him, taking him to the edge and leaving him hanging there as he kissed over his thighs and caressed his skin. Eventually Cas crawled up his body, kissing his way up Dean's torso even as he whimpered at having the pleasure of Cas' mouth and tongue taken away.
“You passed me on the way to your place. Or is it Sam's place now?” he asked shrewdly, his blunt manner catching Cas off guard for a moment. He quickly gave himself mental shrug and spoke up.
“Candy!” Gabriel demanded.
. Besides, he's gorgeous. I'm allowed to gloat and ogle.”
He woke an hour later to the soft murmur of voices coming from the living room. He got up and stretched before wandering out barefoot. Cas patted the couch next to him, then stood and disappeared into the kitchen, returning with a glass of lemonade with berries floating in it. Dean grinned and raised his glass to his mate, then clinked glasses with Charlie and Jo.
Much appreciation to Dani, my amazing beta, and to my wonderful friends on Destiel Writers Discord. Hopefully I'm forgiven. 😘
This time Cas leaned into him, his hands coming up to cradle Dean's head and tug at his hair, then their lips met again. Cas whimpered at the touch of Dean's tongue against his lips, then he opened. Dean slid his tongue lightly against Cas' and this time couldn't hold back the moan that escaped him when Cas' tongue met his in a slow dance. Years of pent-up longing boiled over, and he wrapped his arms around his best friend, pulling him close until his body was melded to Cas'. Cas' strong hands slid down his back, then suddenly he was wrapping his arms around Dean and kissing him as though he were drowning and Dean's mouth was the air.
Charlie jumped up and ran to check out the spaces, barging into the office without a care. Dean simply rolled his eyes and shouted after her, “Look at the shower while you're in there! And take measurements of the master, wouldja?”
“Cocky, bratty little thing, aren’t you? What happened to being good for me?” Cas asked, slapping his hand down lightly on Dean’s ass, barely enough to sting.
"Leave some room for Jesus, guys!" Gabriel cat-called as he spun past with a lovely, slim, dark beauty.
"Fuck, Dean," Cas breathed against his throat, then his hand snuck under Dean's jacket and shirts to curl into his back, blunt nails scoring his skin.
“Thanks for the food. Jerk. Packed you a bag, here. And I don't want to talk about that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That sounds like a good idea.”
“As you command, your Majesty,” Dean replied, managing a courtly bow despite his seated position and a mouthful of pie.
“Considering you may have a physical tomorrow, do you really want to stay in bed, having me fill you with my come over and over, and spanking your ass until you can’t sit without squirming?” Cas breathed against his ear, and Dean whimpered. “Do you really want to face Missouri like that?” This time when Dean shuddered it wasn’t a happy one.
"Like what you see, angel?" Dean asked, watching as Cas' cock dripped more precome onto his stomach. He smirked.
With a quick kiss, Sam went to Dean's room to pack a bag. Gabe lay sprawled on the bed in a drowsy haze until he heard an exclamation from his Alpha, and he dragged himself to the door to Dean's room to investigate. After the claws, he wasn't leaving anything to chance.
Cas grinned at him. "Until last night neither had I. And I've never bottomed without one."
“Hey, Cas. Just back today, needed to get everything back up and running after this one nearly bankrupted me.” He threw a thumb towards Charlie as he dropped his voice to a stage whisper, grinning at her indignant squawk. Then he saw Cas’ frown of concern and laughed. “I’m kidding about that, but we have been busy today. I appreciate you coming by. The chocolates have been selling well.”
“Patience, Omega-mine. Now, I want you on you on your stomach, arms above your head. Make sure you’re comfortable, Dean, because once I’ve punished you—” As Cas spoke Dean whined, low in his throat, trembling “—yes, I know, that’s what you want—for teasing me at work, riling me up, taunting me, flaunting yourself, once I’ve got your beautiful ass red and aching, I’m going to use my tongue to open you up, and then I’m going to make sure you know how very much I want you.”
Charlie stared at him a moment then shook her head in mock despair. “I'll let Dean explain that one. You said you had a second lasagna for us to take to Sam and Gabe?”
“I can't figure out how to fuck you while you’re still wearing these, but damn I want to...” He growled and the scent of slick strengthened.
“You know something, Cas? I think we're going to get along really well.”
Dean didn't get a chance to sing the next lines, as Cas lifted him into his arms. He wrapped his legs around Cas’ waist in response, their lips locked together as Cas carried him to their bedroom, setting him on the bed and crawling over him.
Whoever it was could hardly be worse, and Dean whirled, wrapping his arms around broad shoulders. He got a vague impression of dark hair and a strong jaw, then he was being kissed senseless, dominated completely. Caught off-guard, Dean melted against the mystery man, his lips parting as a strong hand cupped his jaw just so, tilting his head and plundering his mouth. His breath left him in a surprised moan as strong hands controlled his every move, and by the time Dean's lips were released by the stranger, his knees were weak.
Sam stood staring at his phone and Gabe nudged his elbow, prompting Sam to immediately wrap an arm around his shoulders, pulling him close.
Dean was lost. Kissing Cas consumed him, absorbing all of his focus until nothing remained but the feel, the scent, the taste, the sound of his best friend moaning softly against his lips. They kissed slowly, every touch a caress, and Dean felt his heart swell at the tenderness. They kissed fiercely, and Dean whimpered as heat flooded his veins. One of Cas' hands slipped down his spine and settled at the small of his back, and Cas growled against his lips, bending Dean back slightly and leaning into him. Dean heard a low whine as one of his hands fell to the floor to catch his balance, then felt his cheeks flush when he realized the sound was from him.
Posting today just seemed appropriate, as it was 2 years ago today that I posted chapter 1!
“Do you carry these plants?” Cas asked eventually, perusing the list, a frown of concentration creasing his brow.
Cas leaned over him, letting him feel his cock against his ass, the two handprints standing out. He flicked his tongue over Dean’s earlobe, then murmured softly. “Good boy.”
“Let's find out.”
Please take care of yourselves.
Cas grinned at him and took his hand, kissing his knuckles to watch him blush.
“Mom, that is
Sam snorted, shaking his head, his eyes dancing with amusement. “I can at least sit at my desk and do paperwork. You, however, would have trouble serving drinks. Let me call the Roadhouse and see what kind of pie Ellen has on the menu today.”
“Yeah, yeah. I'm just an idiot for thinking I could get in and out without Ellen or Jo noticing the bite, or that my scent has changed.”
Sam laughed and shook his head, his floppy hair falling into his eyes. "Pass, I've seen my brother's game, and it's not my thing."
“Sorry, I got a little… overzealous,” he apologized, kissing the tender spot gently, at odds with the rough passion they’d shared.
"Trouble in paradise?" Dean dared to ask, and Cas rolled his eyes.
“To be fair, we were discussing my desire to keep you and the pups safe when I realised I could change them at will.”
“I can see what you ‘were just’ doin’, ya idjit. Now get inside before your sister gets out here and threatens to skin your Alpha for abandoning you. Why didncha just say he was in the car and you'd be right back?”
"Doesn't mean it's not a good line." Dean wormed his way lower and reached for Cas' slacks, undoing the button slowly, and drawing down the zipper. He glanced up to watch Cas' reaction and was nearly overwhelmed by the look of lustful adoration. "I got you, angel."
"Time to let go then, angel, or I'm not gonna last," Dean coaxed, pulling Cas' hand away.
As their breathing slowed, Cas nuzzled at Dean’s throat, laying gentle kisses from his collarbone up to the point of his jaw, brushing his cheek against his Omega’s. The rasp of stubble on Dean’s jaw was a pleasant counterpoint to his own week’s worth of growth, and he hummed softly in his ear as he stroked gentle fingers through his hair. Dean was purring underneath him, his fingers trailing lightly up and down Cas’ back.
He pulled out of the lot and headed back into town, pulling up a few minutes later to a semi-detached house with a spectacular lawn, flowers creating a gorgeous rainbow of colour, quite literally.
“I can easily carry you there. But really, you're going to call your sister while I'm knotted inside you?”
Thanks muchly to Banshee for beta-ing for me and her encouragement as I poke this chapter into some semblance of cohesion!

Thank you Banshee for all your help and the perfect suggestion for the chapter title.
“Sure thing, hon.” She scooped up their menus and turned to Dean for a second before leaving their table. “He's alright.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas growled at the audacity of the two Omegas, and Dean bared his throat, even as the scent of slick flooded Cas’ nostrils. Cas licked over Dean’s scent gland, then leaned close to whisper huskily in his ear.
Dean slid from the mechanical bull with a triumphant laugh, accepting congratulations and slaps on his broad shoulders as he made his way to the bar. He snorted when he heard some drunk comment that it took a ‘real manly Alpha to ride like that’.
"You gonna tease me, lover?" he asked, his voice husky even to his own ears.
He dropped his head against Cas' shoulder, breathing deeply for a moment.
He cocked his hips higher, and sinking down on his chest to present for his mate, he turned his head so Cas could see his face if he was looking. He clenched around emptiness again, even as he let out a moan and bit his lip.
won’t want another Alpha around, it won't matter that I'm your brother. I'll call ahead to place an order, what does Sam want? You know what,” Cas shook his head, scratching at the back of his neck as he bit back a yawn, “get Sam to call and place the order, and add two bacon cheeseburgers and fries to that. That'll take care of lunch for Dean and I. I don't know why you couldn't call Anna, though. Our sister is perfectly capable of fetching burgers for you.”
Cas' hand wrapped around his cock then, stroking him quickly as he ground against Dean slowly, and Dean shouted his pleasure to the room as he came a second time.
Dean came screaming his name, and Cas felt the sharp pain of his mate’s fangs at his throat.
“Hang on, little ‘Mega,” he murmured, smirking as his lover shivered at his tone. And Sam let his wolf loose, and with a snarl he started rutting into Gabe with sharp snaps of his hips. Gabe wailed, his arms and shoulders bunching as he fought against being driven across the table. Sam took hold of his hips and pulled him into each thrust, the wet smack of skin against skin echoing through the house, his grunts as he fucked into his Omega a counterpoint to Gabe's cries.
“He most definitely is not twelve,” Cas commented, slowly glancing up and down Dean's body that set his blood humming.
“So, Sam sounded almost panicked when he ordered food earlier, but he said everything was okay. He said to ask you. What is up with that brother of yours?” Ellen asked and Dean choked.
“No more than twenty minutes. You do still have to go to work today,” Cas pointed out, somewhat heartlessly, Dean thought.
"What was next on this list of yours?"

“You got it, brotha,” the burly man replied in a thick Louisiana accent.
“You wouldn't deprive me of my livelihood, would you, Alpha?” Dean managed to look at Cas through his lashes, despite Cas still fumbling with his seatbelt. Dean was biting back a smirk as Cas muttered under his breath about disrespectful Omegas needing to be shown a firm hand. Meanwhile, Bobby was watching them both in feigned disgust.
"Fuck, look at you, angel. Want you so bad."
“And you?” Sam asked, a husky whisper against Gabe's throat, his lips just brushing his scent gland. Gabe's head went back on a purr, but he grinned cheekily.
Cas, on the other hand, wasn’t satisfied yet.
Dean's hips bucked of their own volition at Cas' words, closer by far than he thought he'd be. Pushing at Cas' wrist, Dean shoved his hand away from his body, though he still couldn't contain the whine at the empty feeling.
Sam groaned against his throat, finding his scent gland with his eyes closed, and clamped his fangs into his mate with a snarl. Gabe moaned, his body wracked by another orgasm, pinpricks of pain on his torso and hip where Sam held him. As Sam drew back and lapped over the bite, Gabe grabbed his forearm and turned to his mate's neck, claiming him in return. Their bond snapped into place, and Gabe’s wolf howled within him. His fingers tingled oddly, and he sagged back against Sam's chest. Sam cradled him for several minutes as they caught their breath.
"Feel good, babe?" he asked softly, wetting his lips and stroking a thumb over the red, dripping head of Cas' cock. "See how nice it is having a body, not just a wavelength of celestial intent?"
“You obviously didn't open the cupboards down there.” Cas grinned with a wink. “I am the Rainbow Road champion.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas growled, and the sharp sting of his palm striking Dean’s ass made him jump, even as he felt himself leaking another trickle of slick. Cas growled again, but the sound was completely different, and Dean chuckled, deliberately tightened his hole before relaxing it, and this time Cas moaned.
“Angel, try a bite? You can get the rest packed up. But have a bite so you can tell Ma how amazing she is. For me?” Dean all but pleaded. Cas gave him a shy smile and picked up his fork.
"Pie?" Cas asked. Dean met Cas' blue eyes, sparkling with mischief, and Dean was caught in his stare. "You're willing to share?"
Love as always for my beta, Dani!
Within bare minutes, Gabe could feel the low buzz building in his gut. Sam pulled his hand away from his cock and Gabe whimpered, even as his lover reared back to grab his hips and thrust desperately, his knot already swelling, catching and slipping past his rim with every thrust. Suddenly they locked together, and Sam started a filthy grind of his hips, his enormous knot pulsing, rubbing against Gabe's prostate in a continuous way that quickly pushed him over the edge in a shockwave of pleasure that had him coming untouched.
A young man with dark hair, large, soft brown eyes, and a goatee sidled up to him and shyly flirted with him for a bit, but Dean wanted something rough and tumble tonight. He made his excuses and moved around the bar, flitting out onto the dancefloor to unwind for a bit, letting the music loosen his hips and his spine. He found himself grinding with a beefy, bearded leather daddy in a pageboy cap, the man’s bear-like paws clutching at his hips as they moved together. All for naught though, when the guy leaned closer and begged Dean to fuck him.
"You're not even Christian," Cas retorted to his older brother with an eye-roll, but he and Dean were reminded they weren't alone and behaved for the remainder of the song. As it came to an end, Cas grabbed Dean and dragged him off the dance floor to a secluded corner and captured his lips in a hot, desperate kiss that left Dean breathless. They broke apart panting, Dean feeling the kiss down to his toes and every inch in between. As Cas nipped along his jaw to nibble on his ear, several of those inches perked up and Dean groaned quietly.
"What do you need, angel-mine?"
Cas and Jimmy have a revealing conversation, Balthazar is out of contact, and then Cas heads to the Roadhouse for dinner with Dean. While waiting for his Omega, an ex-boyfriend shows up and tries to rekindle things, only to be firmly rejected by Cas, and then mocked and dismissed by Dean.
Cas nuzzled at Dean's cock slowly, gently, pulling a soft whine from his throat. Dean stared down at his boyfriend in heady anticipation, then felt his eyes flutter shut as Cas captured the head of his already aching cock with his lips, the satin sliding over his sensitive skin.
Next chapter is Sabriel, fyi.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "I dunno how long I'll last, I've never topped without a condom…"
Dean dragged his palm down Cas’ side, from his ribs to his hip, then reached past him and opened the door. A waft of leather and polish hit them, along with a touch of lemon from the cleaning products. He met Cas’ lust-blown eyes, and smirked.
he begged, but Cas raised his hips out of range and Dean whimpered at the loss of contact.
Dean’s words rang in his ears, and Cas growled at the audacity of his Omega, then heard an unfamiliar voice from across the parking lot.
"No biting your lip, angel, I wanna hear you," Dean murmured, then bent to his task, slowly teasing his tongue around Cas' rim until he was shaking and mewling with every stroke. Spearing his tongue, Dean pressed into Cas' body, prompting a surprised shout from his lover.
Dean shuddered, his wolf whining and presenting to his Alpha. Dean was pinned, he couldn't follow suit, but he bared his throat and stilled under the dominant Alpha.
"Oh really?" he asked, his tone amused. He swiveled towards Dean, planting one foot on the rung of the stool behind Dean, through the middle of his legs. The position gave Dean a delectable view of his strong, muscular legs, straining the denim over his thighs and allowed him to feel the heat of his body. The man leaned forward, dropping his voice, and Dean unconsciously leaned closer to listen. "It'd take me a lot more than eight seconds, but I bet I could get you off."
Dean leaned over and kissed him, grinning as he slid out of the car.
Dean turned to the man Gabriel had called Cassie. “You work here, Cas? You weren't behind the bar…”
"Lube, where'd the lube go?" he asked roughly, then moaned as Cas' thumb stroked over the head and dragged down his shaft, spreading precome. Dean fumbled around on the bed and found the lube, squeezing some into his hand and warming it a little before sliding it down his cock. He shivered at the added sensation, and Cas waited only a moment before wrapping his hand around Dean's and adding to the friction. "Mmm, yeah, like that, sweetheart."

Sam had moved them to the couch in the living room, waiting for his knot to go down. Gabe's stomach growled, and Sam's eyes widened.
"Spit's alright for a little while, but I'm planning on taking my time with you." And he pressed two fingers slowly into Cas' body again. Twisting them and thrusting them in and out, he made sure to reapply lube often, and soon, his fingers were gliding in and out of Cas' hole with ease. Cas was panting and moaning above him, pleading for more,
“Absolutely. I still want our nest. Our nap was interrupted.”
have gotten a message like this before!” He passed his phone to Sam, who scanned it and grimaced.
Finally, after the bouquet was tossed and the garter flung, resulting in a highly provocative tease by Pam and Victor as he removed the garter from her thigh with his teeth, Gabriel announced it was time for the happy couple to get their asses in gear if they wanted to make their flight. Dean shuddered, knowing there was no way he'd ever see Hawaii, a flight that long might give him a heart attack.
“Alpha, can I ask you to fetch the folded blanket from the trunk? I don't want to ruin the leather.”
“Thanks for the support, Ma,” he grumbled.
"Ah. Thanks for explaining. Now where was I?" Dean watched in amused arousal as Cas went from curious kitten to smitey angel of the Lord, his eyes flashing. His amusement only lasted a moment though, because in the next breath, Cas had thrown his legs over his shoulders and was nuzzling at the plug, all while staring up at Dean with those intense blue eyes.
He dialed quickly and after three rings, a breathless Cassie answered the phone.
"I'm heading to Kali's, no sex in my room! See ya later, boys!" Gabriel gave them a jaunty salute and wandered out of the house. Cas shut the door behind him with a sigh of wry resignation. He locked it, then turned to Dean.
Reunited, the lovers return to their home and Dean sets his mind to easing Cas' worries.
“How am I supposed to keep my mind on the road?” Dean gasped, letting go of Cas’ hair and white-knuckling Baby’s steering wheel until his knuckles cracked. He fought to keep his hips still, focused on his driving, though he definitely drove faster than usual through town. Cas eased off as he whimpered, then picked up the pace again, teasing him ceaselessly until they pulled into the driveway and Dean hit the button for the garage opener. Cas pulled off with a smirk, wiping drool and precome from his chin as Dean pulled into the garage. Dean hauled him across the bench the moment he had Baby’s engine turned off, Cas moulding himself to him and kissing him with desperate passion, dominant and thorough, claiming his mouth and leaving Dean panting.
“Both?” he grinned, knowing his favourite brother would know which brand of chocolate he wanted.
“Alpha, please, angel…”
"Maybe I should go…" Dean hedged, biting back a laugh at Sammy's offended glare.
“Let’s see what you got, Alpha-mine.”
“I did it the other day. Meant to ask the last time you were over but I chickened out. But last night I just knew… I mean I hoped.” He blushed further, meeting Dean’s eyes shyly.
Dean's moan was loud and sudden as he fisted his hand in Cas' hair. "Oh, Jesus, fuck! Cas!" he growled, his hips bucking slightly as Cas’ lips sealed around the head of his cock, Baby swerving underneath them as Dean fought to keep control. Cas popped off his dick with an admonishing chuckle.
“Her name is Anael, but she goes by Anna. And James, you're right there. Our mother liked to say he was named for an apostle, as well as the king who commissioned her favoured bible, the King James edition. I had the best day when I told her he did that to placate the church so they'd ignore his incredibly public gay love affair.”
Dean grinned over his shoulder, wiggling his eyebrows. "What're you gonna do about it?"

He glanced up and caught Jo looking out the window. She had her hand up, silently counting down from five.

“He didn't tell you? He knew we were coming back and he left it to me to tell? Sonofabitch… Um, he called this morning. He met his True Mate last night, too.” He held up his hands against the onslaught of questions, the shouting bringing Jo over to see what the commotion was about. “Cas’ older brother Gabriel is Sam's True Mate. Tripped a heat for Gabe, but apparently he's on a better brand of birth control that I am.”
“Sam…” he breathed, “my Alpha. My mate.”
**********heads up folks***********
Many thanks to my beta, Dani, as always. 😁  I don't know what she'd do if I stopped with the extraneous commas. Probably wonder what was wrong with me. 😘
"You okay?"
“Hello, Dean… I was hoping you’d be back,” he said gruffly, picking at a sticker on the counter absently. Dean was hyper-aware of Charlie at his side, her ears having grown by inches to listen to every word.
Cas deals with his provocative omega.
“Proud of her, aren't you?” he asked, as though it were a question.
“Anything, Omega-mine.”
Cas broke in a guttural groan, his body falling to press against Dean's.
“Put your arms around me, and move, please, Sam. Slow,” he instructed, and a whine escaped his throat as Sam wrapped his arms around him and gently began to thrust up into him.
Thank you so much for coming on this journey with me!
Dean’s body clamped down hard as his orgasm washed over him and a second later the hot flood of Cas’ come filling him swamped his senses. Cas collapsed over his back and rolled them onto their sides, still leisurely thrusting them through the aftershocks.
"Please, Cas, c'mon babe, need you!"
"Dean," Cas said his name, almost as he always did, but his voice was somehow lower, huskier than ever, and Dean fought back a shiver that wanted to crawl down his spine.
Cas let out a low chuckle, his eyes meeting Dean's for a long moment before dropping to his lips.
“How did you know?” Dean gaped at him.
Locking his hands on Cas' hips, Dean began a slowly rolling thrust, pulling gasps and mewls from his lover as he drove over his prostate again and again.
Dean goes to his second job and has a long talking with Ellen and Bobby, revealing some truths that Dean had suspected. He then heads to Milton's to torment his Alpha.
Dean quickly spun on the bed and crawled closer on all fours. Watching Cas for his reaction, he slowly ran the tip over his tongue around the head, catching the pearling droplets and sucking them down. Cas's hands found his hair and brushed it back from his forehead, petting him until a well-placed flick of his tongue made him gasp. Pulling Dean upright to meet his lips, Cas kissed him breathless.
Dean glanced at his angel's face and hummed softly at the conflicted emotion he saw there.
A few minutes later a tall, bearded man with strange blue eyes and a nasal voice approached him, but Dean got serious creeper vibes and brushed him off. The guy refused to budge though, telling him how much he could teach Dean, that he could be his star pupil. He was starting to get antsy about the guy, searching for a way to ditch a stage five clinger, when a strong set of arms wrapped around his waist from behind.
About twenty minutes later the disheveled pair were both dressed, spritzed with blockers Dean had in his duffel, and ignoring the curious and the scandalized looks as Dean had a Coke at the bar while flirting with his Alpha. Gabe stopped by to bitch out Cas for abandoning the bar right after he’d announced discounted drinks, but the glint of laughter was in his eyes. Dean then had the excruciatingly awkward pleasure of watching Gabe’s expression when his phone pinged. He pulled his cell from his pocket and glanced at it, his lips curving in a goofy grin, quickly changing to a wide-eyed look of aroused shock when he tapped on the message. Dean decided he never needed to see that look on his brother’s mate’s face again, but still, he chuckled and winked at Cas, who was watching Gabe in bemusement.
Heya, wasn't going to post until Saturday, but honestly, I'm having a shit day and thought it might cheer me up to post early. If nothing else, I hope I can put a smile on others' faces. 💖
"I said, don't stop!" Cas all but growled, and Dean let out a breathless laugh. He pulled back suddenly and drove forward, snapping his hips sharply. Cas cried out in pleasure, and Dean gave a cocky grin.
, digging into the loam, a liquid pain running down his spine like a lightning bolt, there and gone again. When he turned his head, panting for breath, he saw. He'd shifted, Cas had shifted.
A growl escaped Dean and he tamped it down. “No one is touching our pups,” he said firmly. “Anyone even tries to hurt them, or you, and I'll kill them.”
“And in far better shape,” Dean quipped.
"Yeah, buddy?" Dean asked, reminding himself that friends is all they would ever be.
When Cas' hands slid down Dean's spine and settled against the curve at the small of his back, Dean let out a soft sound that could only be called a whimper. He dropped his hands from Cas' hair to his hips, their kisses growing more urgent, more ardent as the moments passed.  Cas pinned him to Baby's side, and their hips lined up with a slow, aching roll that snapped Cas' head back on a gasp.
“Tell me, my love.”
Cas snorted with laughter against the nape of his neck. "The holiest." Dean rolled his eyes and grimaced as Cas' cock slipped out of his body. Cas rolled them to their sides and tucked Dean against him, a snap of his fingers cleaning away the sweat and come. Wrapping his wings around Dean, he pulled Dean close.
“You were just shitting with Charlie about Monopoly, right? Tell me you've played console games,” Dean asked as  they stepped back and shut the front door.
“You know,” Cas mused softly, “I was going to tell you to go home and get some sleep, but maybe you should come back in and have a drink at the bar, just so no one thinks I murdered you and dumped your body somewhere.”
“I can go get the burgers in a little bit, just as soon as my knot goes down,” Sam told him, nuzzling at his neck, then pulling back as Gabe let out a small whine.
“C'mon, Jo, I don't comment on your sex life!” Dean whined, as only an older brother could when teased by his younger sister about such a thing.
“Ah, ah, ah, keep your mind on the road, Dean. Let’s get home--” he teased his tongue around the head again and bobbed down for a moment, sucking quickly and firmly, “--and I fuck you senseless.”
“And have more of Ellen’s burgers? Absolutely.”
“You’re one to talk, you clawed up my arm when you bit me. Anyway, Dean'll need to pack a bag too, since I'm kicking him out for the duration of your heat. I don't want anyone in and out while you're in heat.”
came the expected reply.
Dean wove his way through the bar towards the door when a moist, clammy hand closed about his wrist. He twisted his wrist free, and snarled at the overweight, balding man.
“So good for me, so sweet, so
“No.” He turned to face Cas completely and reached over to run his fingers through his lover’s dark hair. “I said yes because I… I’m in love with you, and I want to wake up with you every morning.”
“Cas, please…”
“Nah, Bobby. It's okay,” Dean soothed. “I used that trick of popping the joint in my thumb to make him think I broke his wrist, then Cas picked him up by the collar and banned his pasty, bald ass. Ash's cameras helped, too!”
“Yup. He bought me a beer when I beat the timer,” Dean grinned across the table at Cas, and his mate flushed slightly.
“Cheeseburgers! Bacon cheeseburgers from some place called the Roadhouse! My heat tripped, Sam can't leave me, Balth and Jimmy are covering at work for us. Please, Cassie?”
“Before I agree to that, do you know what the stoplight system is, Dean?”
“A nosy neighbour assumed Sam and I were together and went on a rant. The lawn had to be done.” He opened the door and slid out of the seat. Before shutting the door, he said, “Be right back. We'll get together with Sammy and Gabe when no one is in heat or rut, so no one goes all Alpha.”
he pleaded, and Cas responded without thinking, striking his bare palm over the globe of Dean’s ass, pulling a cry and a shudder from the Omega.
Dean knew he was being played. He'd watched the transformation from teasing mate to seeing his Alpha looking like his heart had been torn out. He dropped his burger onto his plate and pointed a finger at Cas accusingly.
Dean and Cas go back to Cas' place.
"Don't break him, Pam. He's got a long life ahead of him," Victor teased.
he resolved, retying the bow, though not as neatly. Killing the light he moved back to the bedroom, and tucked the selections onto his nightside table, then slid back between the sheets
Dean whimpered and thrashed on the bed above him, his cock twitching and dripping precome as Cas ramped him higher and higher. When Dean reached for his own cock, though, Cas captured his hand, pressing it to the mattress.

” he sang, bopping to the music. Cas grinned and pulled him close for a kiss, slotting one muscular thigh between Dean's legs, grinding against him in time to the music.
Dean shuddered, going limp, only his white-knuckled grip on the headboard belying his tension. “Alpha,” Dean’s voice was slightly muffled, buried as his face was against a pillow, but the husky timbre came through loud and clear. “We’re green.”
Sam was busily scribbling a note, which when Gabe wandered over to read, said that Sam didn't need to know that. Glancing in the open drawer, he spotted nothing but panties, all in men’s size. He burst out laughing and stole the note from Sam, scrawling a quick “
fair, I wouldn't--” Jo protested hotly, before Ellen cut her off.
“Ooh, tell me later! Meanwhile, put the lovebirds on my tab, would ya hon? Congrats you two! Later, bitches!” Charlie waved a Vulcan salute and gave a kiss to Jo, then wandered out the door.
“I have no shame. Yes!” Dean winced as his name was shouted from the doorway behind him. Jo walked off with her parents, all three laughing.
Dean's eyes fluttered shut as he swayed, only Cas' quick shift around the table to catch him keeping him on his feet. Cas let him sink back to his seat, still following with his lips. Only then did Dean realise that maybe it wasn't quite Cas following, but Dean's hands fisted in Cas' hair or the way he was kissing him back like a man drowning.
“My mother started to beat me once she found out I was gay. My parents divorced when I was seventeen and she disowned me. Then a few years later, Balth announced he was bi, but later declared he's actually pan, he just didn't know the term, and Gabe came out as bi as well. She disowned all three of us. Meanwhile, my dad, Chuck, had documented spousal abuse, and with myself and Jimmy as Alphas willing to attest to his character, he got the house and custody. He's a bit of a recluse these days, but he's our dad.”
"Because if not, I'm fine with it. I know we're both clean, and neither of us can get pregnant. I really want to feel you inside me…" Cas continued, his husky voice sparking all sorts of ideas in Dean's brain. He'd only ever bottomed for a quick buck to get Sammy food when they were younger, but this was different. The idea of being inside
Dean hesitated, not wanting his family involved. But apparently, Cas had no such compunction, though at least he lowered his voice.
Still leaning against the side of the booth, waiting for the boys’ first bites, Jo grinned at Cas' antics. She shook her head, still smiling, and asked where they'd met.
"About time, jerk!" Sam bellowed, and Dean had to laugh, though he wasn't sure if the moose meant that they'd finally rejoined the party, or that they'd pulled their heads out of their collective asses and gotten together.
“Mmmm?”
Little bit of tenderness, a little brotherly teasing, and a little of drunk Sammy.
"Fuck, that feels so good, sweetheart!" Dean murmured, trying not to buck his hips, trembling with the effort of keeping still.
Cas hummed against his throat, trailing slow kisses. “We have tomorrow off, baby, today we have to be responsible adults.”
was not a reassuring reply.
Sam stared at the man in shock, but heard Cassie lean over and whisper to Dean, “Another reason I moved out.”
They slammed into the bathroom stall, hands clutching as they made out, Dean's hands fumbling for Blue-Eyes' zipper and pulling out his half-hard cock. Spitting into his palm, he started to stroke the other man, then paused when his wrist was caught in an iron grip. A sly, sexy smirk crossed the stranger's face, and Dean bit back a moan.
"Uh uh
Cas snorted, appalled and amused. “You think he’d agree to that?”
” Cas growled, his Alpha-voice compelling his obedience.
"Dean, please,
Dean lunged forward and captured Cas' lips, swallowing the low moan that threatened to bubble up from his chest. Cas' pink, chapped lips were softer than they looked, and Dean parted his lips on a small gasp when he felt the feather-light touch of Cas' tongue. Dean pulled back for a moment and met Cas' eyes, the ocean blue gone dark and deep as his pupils blew wide.
“All in good time, Baby,” Cas promised, then bent and ran his tongue over Dean’s pucker, making him jump and whine.
Gabe moaned against his throat and shifted from his knees to sitting in Sam's lap, wrapping his legs around his waist.
"Ah, ah, not yet," Cas slowed his thrusts, rolling his hips and teasing Dean with his body.
“That was the suggestion. As for the request, I’d like some plants or flowers to decorate the shop, but I want something without a lot of fragrance.”
“So you don’t want to know about th—”
"Cas, Cas, angel… oh God, I'm so close, I'm gonna--" He broke off, his head snapping back with a silent cry as he came, pumping his seed into Cas' body. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean tightly and pulled him in for another round of kisses.
Cas laughed then, low and smug, and smacked Dean’s ass. “Leave it on the chair. You think I wear that stuff to clubs and don’t have someone on tap to clean it properly?” Cas bent and kissed the spot he’d just slapped, then crawled off the bed to head to the bathroom. Dean struggled out of the vest and undid his tie, only just starting on the buttons of his dress shirt when Cas returned with a cloth.
Dean's hands tangled in Cas' hair, turning his head slightly to slot their lips together seamlessly. The hand under this shirt skimmed over his hip and up his side, letting the shirts and jacket fall as he cupped Dean's cheek. The tenderness in Cas' touch made Dean's heart ache. As they broke the kiss, both panting for breath, Cas whispered his name again.
They stumbled into Dean's bedroom, their hands still roaming, when Cas' long fingers started on Dean's belt. Dean froze, and Cas stopped immediately.
“Cas, they're like an orgasm for your mouth.”
He struck again with the paddle, left and then right, then dropped it onto the bed, and struck with his hand, right and then left. Dean wailed at the sudden change in the pattern he’d come to expect, his body jumping. Cas could see the slick soaking his thighs, and quickly dropped between his legs, burying his face against his Omega’s hole, lapping at him and moaning at the taste. Distantly, beyond the roaring of his pulse in his ears, he could hear Dean’s cries, begging for more, for his knot, pleading with him. Finally, unable to wait any longer, he lunged to blanket his mate’s prone body with his own, and biting down on the nape of his neck, he slid into Dean’s slick, waiting heat.
“Fine, but you owe me. You're making me wake up my pregnant mate, you realise.”
Dean was giving a bitter laugh as Cas turned back to him.

Dean grinned. "Back when you used words like fornicate in the middle of sex? What can I say, it was adorably hot."
His hands suddenly full of demanding Omega, Cas growled deep in his throat, attempting to thrust up against his mate, but the seatbelt prevented the motion he wanted. “Dean, Dean…” he groaned, his hands roaming under Dean's t-shirt before sliding down to cup his ass. Dean's lips were everywhere, kissing him passionately one moment, moving gently over his mating mark, then sucking on an earlobe.
Dean leaned in and found Cas mouth again, Cas letting him in easily, a slow, sensuous kiss that made Dean's heart feel three times its usual size. He could smell the remains of Cas' cologne from the day before, their sweat and the growing scent of sex, musky and intoxicating. Under it all was fresh-brewed coffee and Dean smiled softly at the reminder of how sweet Cas was.
Sam gave a low chuckle, and again lifted Gabe effortlessly. Gabe had never considered being manhandled one of his kinks. Most Alphas and Betas were larger than him, so they just wanted to rub in their strength.
“Holy shit. Is this for real?” He linked his clawed fingers with Gabe's, and Gabe's wolf gave a happy little huff, basking in the warmth of mate.
Cas had set out cheese and crackers, and the four sat and munched while they talked, keeping the conversation light. Once Dean started to mention his bruise, not really remembering if it had been fully explained yet thanks to his impromptu nap, Charlie cut him off and patted his hand, exuding protective Omega from every pore.
“You takin’ a day off, Bobby?” Dean asked around a mouthful of food.
Dean threw his head back and laughed, meeting the other man’s gaze with a grin, his eyes shining.
"Don't rip 'em," he muttered, prompting a low, glorious laugh.
Dean felt that zing of pain again, but it happened so quickly it barely registered. As he stood, he unconsciously stroked his hand over his stomach, and then he froze.
from his Alpha.
Gabe had his face buried against Sam’s throat, and purred at their combined scent. Sam had gotten his caramel, and he had Sam's cinnamon. He thought they were delicious together.
"Oh, fuck, Cas, feels so good!" Dean cried out, trembling and desperate, his thighs clenching around Cas' head. Cas hummed in reply and Dean whined, riding out wave after wave of pleasure as he felt his orgasm approaching. Again, Cas stopped shy of tipping him over the edge.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean woke up slowly, rolling sleepily to face his lover, only to find the space beside him empty. He froze, thinking back uncertainly to their first night together, when Cas walked through the door. He was wearing a pair of cotton sleep pants slung low on his hips and carried two mugs of coffee, his hair, a disaster. Dean rolled onto his back and sat up, stretching slowly and wiggling back to lean against the pillows. Handing Dean one of the coffees, Cas crawled back onto the bed, setting his own mug onto the bedside table. Dean took a slow, careful sip and sighed with pleasure.
Cas sat up with him, his cock slapping against his stomach. Reaching for Dean's belt, Cas undid it frantically and began on his fly. Dean groaned as the zipper finally released his cock, his head rolling back in relief.
Dean burst out laughing, but caressed a callused hand down Cas' cheek. “She's the old wounds you mentioned, isn't she? Your mom, I mean, not your sister.”
"Lube?" Cas asked, his confusion clear in his voice.

“Depends on when I can get my part-time employee in to work on it. Most of my boys can't be trusted with an older car, but the idjit went and got himself mated when he was supposed to work on it tomorrow morning, so who knows if he'll show up!”
"You showed me The Princess Bride last week, I know that was a quote," he accused, but his lips were twitching with suppressed laughter.
"Holy fuck, Cas." Dean's breathing was laboured as he spoke, but he couldn't resist the comment.
Jo grumbled, then smiled when they took a booth in her section anyway. Cas dropped a kiss on Dean's forehead as he sat, then excused himself to the washroom.
”Oh, shit. Cas, angel, brace yourself. Ma, Bobby, where are you going?!” he demanded in horror as Ellen and Bobby got up.
Cas chases down Bartholomew, and consequences thereof.
"Is this okay?" he asked, and Dean nodded hesitantly. "Dean?"
“Dude, why are you blushing?!” Gabe heard Dean asking, then the Omega at the door burst out laughing. “Right. Don't want to talk about it. Call if you need anything else. See ya!”
Cas begged. Dean chuckled quietly, then they both gasped as he rolled his hips forward. Cas canted his hips up, and Dean reached down to tease at his hole again with lube-slicked fingers. Cas mewled under his touch, his cock nearly purple with arousal and leaking profusely. "Dean, I swear to you, if you don't get in me, I'm going to--
“Alpha, if you don’t get back there and spank me, I’m going to show up and ride that damn bull every night, and then I’m going to dance in clear sight of the bar. I’m going to make a deal with Gabe to let me into the office so I can rub my slick all over your locker if I have to—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, no, baby. It was a misunderstanding. For future reference, you have blanket permission to wake me up with a blow job, Omega-mine,” Cas told him, cupping his chin and forcing Dean to meet his eyes. “As for restraints, for those, let’s make sure everyone is awake when we start tying each other, or ourselves up, huh?” Dean’s defensive posture had softened, but his shoulders were still tense, and his scent was still far from normal. Cas took Dean’s hand, and gave him a gentle tug. “Love, can I hold you?”
Sam though, used his strength to bring Gabe unimaginable pleasure, and Gabe found himself reacting with a fresh gush of slick each time his Alpha demonstrated his strength.
Cas stared at him a moment, then gave him a slow, sad smile. Shaking his head, his smile turned more natural, and he cocked his head to one side.
“Let me guess. Balthazar?” Dean asked.
"What I need is for you to get inside me," he ordered, and Dean groaned as he felt himself harden even further.
Dean dropped his last fry and pointed a finger at him. "Sammy is a lying little bitch, that abomination has no place in the trilogy!"
“Jo,” he waited until she met his stare, “in answer to your question from earlier, I don't think I am, but I'll try every day for the rest of my life to be.”
“You’re not the only one who says what they mean, sweetheart.”
"Mine," he muttered, leaning in to kiss Cas again. Cas startled against him at his words, and Dean froze, second-guessing himself. "You are mine, right, Cas?" he asked, pulling back.
Drawing down the boxer-briefs, Dean licked his lips, then flicked his tongue over the tip of Cas' cock, tasting the salty musk and moaning softly. Cas gasped at his touch, his cock jumping and leaking another droplet of precome.
"If there is, I don't wanna add to it."
“Not usually, but we can find out.” Sam nuzzled at his scent gland and Gabe found himself purring softly, then whimpering as Sam’s knot finally released him. “What's wrong, baby?”
Cas let out a low moan, lining up again, then paused. “Are you sure?”
Dance after dance, Dean and Cas moved together, leaving each other's sides only long enough for the speeches. Dean managed to get through his speech with only a few tears, choking up only once. He signed slowly but clearly, having practiced for months to get it right. Dean kept it together, other than a heavy breath. Until his moose of a brother leapt from his seat and scooped him clear off the floor, then his breath left him in a rush as Sam crushed his ribs enthusiastically as he thanked Dean. Eileen didn't bother with words, just pulled him down and kissed his cheek, her dark brown eyes shining with tears.
Cas dropped a kiss on the top of his head gently and stroked his fingers through Dean's hair. “Thank you, and by all means, ogle away. But I get to do the same,” Cas murmured against his ear, and Dean shivered lightly at the promise in his mate's voice.
Have you seen the episode with Dean riding the mechanical bull? The gifs of that scene are what prompted this fic, back when it was supposed to be a smutty 2 chapter thing. Needless to say it didn't stay that way for long, but go revisit those gifs on Google or rewatch the episode.  Have a reminder if how singularly hit Dean is on that bull.
“Honestly,” Dean admitted with a shrug, “most of them, no. We deal primarily in cut flowers rather than living plants. But I’ve got a contact at a local shop, or you can probably find most of these on Amazon.”
Love to Malmuses for beta-ing!
“So I'm essentially meeting your parents?” Cas asked, mildly horrified. “And you didn't think to warn me?”
Cas rolled his eyes and rephrased his question, “What do you
His Alpha was adorable when he was so earnest, and Dean spun around and knocked into him. He sent the Alpha tumbling, instigating a wrestling match that turned into another chase, this one full of nips and playful dodges as they made their way back toward the house. They stopped at the edge of the woods and Dean quirked an ear at Cas.
“Yes, little Omega,” Cas purred, “don’t you worry, I’m going to take good care of you. Now, turn over, let me see that perfect ass.”
Warning, violence, new tag.
"I'm ready. Please, Dean, take me," Cas begged and Dean dropped his head against his lover's shoulder, mouthing at the skin and trailing soft kisses up to his jaw.
Cas' grin widened. "Your spin, shouldn't you be kissing me?"
he replied the same way. He gave a huge yawn and flicked his own tail over his nose, his head resting on his paws. They dozed together until Cas’ knot deflated and he slipped loose. Dean whined at the loss, then yipped as his Alpha's tongue lapped over his hole, cleaning away the evidence of their mating.
“Guess you’re gonna have to make me, Alpha,” Dean challenged, and a low growl escaped Cas, even as his cock throbbed. Gods, but he loved his daring, audacious, pushy Omega.
Thank you so much to my patient readers, I'm so sorry this was late, it won't happen again barring an emergency.
“What the fuck… Sam?” Gabe breathed, staring in shock at his hand, the nails turned to claws. Sam reached for Gabe's hand carefully and swore.
Ellen stopped by shortly thereafter, and she and Bobby sat down with a coffee each.
"Cas, sweetheart, slow down," Dean panted.
“You can't threaten me!” Zachariah whined, his eyes wide with fear even as he sneered.
Mildred and Charlie were still chatting as Dean turned back to the counter, so Dean limped off to the cooler and spent some time checking on the roses. Trimming the occasional dead leaf, he hummed to himself and daydreamed.
“You'll do, son. You'll do,” the gruff old man told Cas, and Dean watched as a flush crossed his Alpha's features again.
meeting your family with an erection, reeking of sex, Dean.”
Cas grinned at him, leaning on his elbow on the bar, all swagger, affirming in Dean's mind the man's Alpha status. As though the red flash of his eyes hadn't been proof enough.
There was a sound like a thunderclap, then Dean felt the brush of feathers along his sides, curling underneath him to play over his thighs and caressing his leaking cock. He whined deep in his throat at the feel of the glorious ebony feathers tracing over his skin, nearly delirious with pleasure at their touch.
“We can't all be mechanically inclined, now can we?”
"Bitch," Dean muttered under his breath, grinning at the usual byplay.
"I'm thinking about it," Cas growled. His fingers toyed with the waist of Dean's panties, and his eyes roved over him, trailing upward from his panties to his face, until their eyes locked. Dean had to suppress a burst of laughter and couldn't contain his smile. How he'd ever believed that look to be platonic was beyond him. Pulling Cas up and into his arms, he kissed him slowly, letting their bodies settle into a gentle rhythm as they rocked against one another. Eventually, their kisses grew more passionate, and Cas pulled back to straddle Dean's legs. He stared down at the panties hungrily, then flicked his eyes back up to meet Dean's gaze.

Dean whined, feeling himself going slick.
get that dick in me already!”
"It's cold out there guys, just saving you from frostbite in some tender places. Good news is whoever bottoms tonight won't need much prep, given how recently you've had your heads up your asses!"
"Oh fuck, Cas, fuck… fuck! Fuck me, fuck me harder!" Cas's hips slammed against his ass in one powerful thrust and Dean cried out, trembling as his cheeks reminded him of the spanking he'd gotten earlier. "Cas, Cas,
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean and Cas head to the sheriff's office to make their statements, and they find out the truth about Alex.
Cas panted against his shoulder, then reached for a package of wet wipes. Cleaning them both up, he fumbled the blanket up around their shoulders and pressed a kiss to Dean's cheek. The soft, tender touch made Dean's heart swell, and he had to tease his lover.
"You have an unhealthy obsession with Harrison Ford," he accused, and Dean couldn't quite stop his cheeks from heating. "That said, Raiders. We still haven't watched all the way through the series, and we've watched all of Star Wars."
The next day Dean limped down to the shop, glaring at Charlie and daring her to say a word. She wisely zipped her lips and ducked her head down to work. As the day progressed, Dean loosened up, mostly because Charlie went out of her way to be his feet, so he could sit and avoid moving too much. Dean manned the phone and the counter, wrapping flowers and chatting with the customers, making recommendations for weddings, Thanksgiving, and telling more clients than he could count that no, they weren’t taking orders for Christmas wreaths just yet.
Their bickering continued as they entered The Roadhouse with Bobby rolling his eyes behind them. Inside the door they were immediately accosted by a petite blonde whirlwind with dark brown eyes who planted herself in front of Cas with a murderous look. Another Alpha.
"Want me to ask nicely? Or did you want me to beg?" Dean deliberately licked his lips, smirking in triumph as Cas' eyes followed the wet slide. Cas was on him in an instant, grabbing his wrists and pinning them to the bed, his hold like shackles. Dean merely smirked up at him and hooked a leg around Cas' waist, rolling his body lithely up against the angel's.
-- grinned at him, teasing.
"Oh, Dean, please!" Cas moaned, his hands clutching at Dean's back, his blunt nails scraping down his spine. "Fuck me, Baby, I'm so close…"
Gabe's head fell back in a moan, each movement Sam made an exquisite torment, the buzzing heat at his core coiling into a molten ball, every thrust threatening to tip him over the edge. Wordless pleas fell from his lips, and Sam nuzzled at his throat, one hand tangling in Gabe's sweat-darkened blond hair.
They return to the house and shift back to human, sending Dean into a panic. What about the pups?
Sam and Gabriel are dealing with Gabe's heat.
He rolled his hips slowly, feeling Cas shudder beneath him and gave a soft laugh. "Feel good, Baby?"
"Love you too, Baby."
"What about us, Dean? Have you got condoms?" Cas murmured against his ear, and Dean shivered. "Because if not…"
Dean drove the few blocks to Cas' place, and they piled out of the car as soon as he was parked next to Cas' Continental. Dean half-jogged a couple steps to catch up with Cas as he rounded the front of Baby and tangled their fingers together. Cas paused and glanced at him, a silly smile curving his lips.
Dean's phone started ringing
“You hear that? You're gonna be a grampa,” she teased, kissing his cheek. Beaming, she turned and picked up a couple menus, looking over her shoulder at Cas and Dean. “Park it, grab one of the booths if you like. We got one free in Ash's section, if you don't want this one hovering every two seconds.”
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asked, worried.
"This is what you want, Dean?" Cas muttered against his ear, rolling his hips and driving into him hard and fast. "So beautiful, so wanton, my Righteous Man, so desperate for my touch. Should I immortalise this moment? My beautiful lover begging for my touch?"
Swallowing a little harshly, Dean found himself captured by Cas' eyes. "Yeah, Cas?"
he demanded. “Cas, I… I assaulted you. I can’t believe I did that, you should be furious!” Dean’s voice trailed off, his scent turning rancid with self-loathing as he curled in on himself, withdrawing from Cas’ touch.
“Sam…” Gabe breathed when their kiss finally ended, resting his head against Sam's throat, dropping slow and gentle kisses against the tanned column, tasting of mate, sweat, and…
“Angel, I want you,” Dean murmured, meeting his gaze, his eyes fully gold ringing the black. “I want you inside me, I want you to mark me with your teeth, and I want you to mount me. I want to present for you, then I want you to fill me with your cock, with your come. I want to come on your cock, screaming your name. And I want you to shift, I want those claws against my hips again. I want you to lose control, to fuck me hard and long, and I want you howling so loudly people across town can hear you. I want you to bite me, bleed me, claim me every way you can.”
Sam continues to care for Gabriel through his heat, they get a visit from their brothers.
sign at her cousins. They grinned mischievously at her as Cas translated for Gabriel as he continued his speech.
All too soon, not soon enough, the Alpha barked another command and the Omega shifted slightly. His Alpha climbed over him, licking at his ear, nuzzling at his scent gland. The Omega shivered in anticipation, wanting, waiting to be claimed by his mate. His Alpha didn't keep him waiting long.
"Cas?" he breathed shakily, only to moan as Cas' hands slipped down to cup his ass and pull him close. Cas' mouth was hot on his throat, and he found his fingers frantically undoing the buttons on Cas' habitual suit. "Bedroom."
“Civilized? Now that's a cruel thing to say about me, and we were getting along so well!” he teased. Dean grinned at his mate, only to have Cas scold him gently. “Dean, please swallow your food.”
“I love you, Dean. I love you so much.”
"Fuck, Cas." He drew out the plug gently, his cock twitching at the deep moan Cas let out as it slipped from his body. Dean shifted to kneel between his legs and stroked his cock once or twice, coating it with lube then wiping his hand on the sheets. Laundry was definitely happening later.
Cas groaned deep in his chest and his hips began to lose their rhythm. "Going to come on my wings, Dean?" he asked, and Dean whimpered at the thought, pressing into the hand at his throat. Those clever wings stroked over his cock again and again, even as Cas pounded into him from behind. "Dean, close your eyes!"
The dark haired man hooked a thumb through Dean's belt loop, pulling him back slightly against his chest.

Cas grinned at him shyly. “That and when we left the hall last night you called my place ‘home’ when I asked you if we should come here.”
“Bitch, relax, I know I smell different, that's Cas’ scent. I won't even come in. Here's the food.”
“Feels so good, Sam, come on Alpha, knot me,
"We can talk later," Cas murmured against his ear. "For now be a good boyfriend and grab me a beer?"
“That’s it, come on my cock, oh fuck, oh fuck,
Dean rolled his eyes and squirmed around onto his back to meet his lover's eyes. Cas was watching him with his head tilted like the world's most adorable kitten, and Dean grinned.
Jo gagged and he whipped his head around to face her. “Shut up. I've had to watch you and Charlie since
“Dean not finishing pie? I never thought I'd see the day.” Charlie elbowed Jo, and quietly said, “Wanna bet on if they get outta the parking lot?”
"And we can airbrush them gold or bronze easily enough for a fall feel…" Cas mused, tapping a finger against pursed lips. "I gotta get back. Gabriel’s manning the shop and…"
“Yup,” Cas confirmed, picking up the thread of the story as Dean took another bite of his burger. “We'd been desperate for proof to kick that asshole out. But we're relatively new in town. Can't ban someone like that without reason.”
“Dude, did you just BTO me?”
“Notice how assholes like that are the first ones to grope and try to pick up another man for a quick fuck in an alley, but as soon as they're turned down, out come the homophobic slurs? Seriously, this is the wrong fucking bar. Between the rainbow flag decal in the window, and the Omega Safe Zone sticker on the door, I don't know what the hell he was doing here.”
Gabe ground against him, watching in smug satisfaction as Sam’s eyes rolled back and he moaned, his cock pulsing again.
A high-pitched, stuttering whine filled Dean’s ears, a breathy exhalation that climbed higher and faster with the tempo of Cas’ hips until it seemed like a continuous cry, only pausing when Dean gulped for air. Which was when he realized the sound was coming from him. He’d long since collapsed to his chest, his hands shoved up under the pillow and hanging onto the headboard for dear life, searching for something to ground him to himself as his lover took him apart thrust after thrust. The push and pull dragged Cas’ cock over his prostate and it lit him up like a rocket, and suddenly he was screaming Cas’ name, babbling incoherently as his lover angled his hips and did it again and again. Cas was like a machine, pistoning his hips and driving Dean up the bed, one hand on Dean’s hip and the other twisting in the laces of the vest he still wore.
Gabe pleaded, his cock throbbing between them as his walls started to clench around Sam's cock.
"C'mon, angel, show me what you got, wanna feel it!" Dean demanded, then howled out a cry as Cas' palm struck again on the other cheek. Over and over, Cas spanked his ass until it burned and everything was hazy and he felt like he was floating. There was a long pause, and Dean squirmed. "Cas?" The angel's name had barely passed his lips when Cas spanked him again, directly over the end of the plug. Cas' broad hand froze, then his fingers nudged, just a little. Dean whimpered as pleasure sang through his nerves, firing white-hot at the pressure against his prostate.
Dean dropped one hand to his own zipper, pulling out his own throbbing cock and stroking it fast as he deep-throated the stranger over and over. The wet, gagging sound filled the stall for anyone to hear and Dean moaned at the thrill of having his face fucked so publicly. His cock jumped in his hand and he came all over the floor, slumping slightly for a moment then straightening as Blue-Eyes stroked his cheek.
Dean's breathing sped up and he wagged his hips back and forth, trying to entice his angel. "Please, Cas, please!"
Here we are folks, one chapter to go after this! Thank you so much for coming along on this two year journey with me, for all your love, support, and kind words as I've gone through some horrible times. You truly kept me going.
Charlie gave him a measuring look, then changed the subject to LARP that weekend. It was the last of the season, and Charlie was determined to uphold her rule as Queen of Moondoor. As her handmaiden, Royal guard, and confidant, Dean would be by her side.
“Hey, I help you, you have success, I get to keep buying chocolates from you,” he offered as an excuse with a playful wink. Cas gave him a shy smile, and Dean blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Castiel, that’s an unusual name…”
Dean cringed and turned anxious eyes to his mate. “Tell me it's not that gold pimpmobile that's been in the shop for two weeks while we waited for the catalytic converters…” he asked with a wince.
"Just don't stop, Dean," Cas breathed, one arm thrown over his eyes. That wouldn't do.
"Not God, just an angel," Cas teased, and Dean huffed a laugh at the familiar joke about Cas' name. His breathless laughter turned into an unrestrained moan as Cas tugged the panties down his thighs and flicked his tongue over the head again, the heat of his mouth intoxicating. Fire ran through his veins, Cas moaning around the head of his cock, hollowing his cheeks and sinking down on him.
“Yeah, yeah, please, oh please, oh, oh, uh!
He could sense Cas’ turmoil and he flicked an ear at him instinctively.
Cas needed no further encouragement. He pulled the satin and lace panties down Dean's legs, nearly overwhelmed by the scent of his Omega's slick. Cas didn't hesitate; he dove between Dean's legs, lapping and sucking at his hole, drinking in the slick the poured from him as he cried out at the feeling of his Alpha's tongue against him, inside him.
"Clothes," Cas reminded him, and Dean grinned.
"Sometimes. When I'm here and I’m feeling generous." He winked one blue eye at Dean, who smirked as he leaned against the bar. The man ran his hand over his day old scruff, glancing up and down Dean's body. It ignited a different warmth than the alcohol.
“Challenge me, will you, Omega-mine? This is your idea of being good?” Cas’ voice was lightly mocking, even as his fingers slid into Dean’s panties and down the cleft of his ass, soaked instantly by his mate’s arousal. He crooked his fingers and pressed two against Dean’s hole, sliding them into his Omega’s tightly clenching body even as Dean whimpered and tried to thrust back onto his hand. He pulled his hand away and hauled down his jeans, exposing the delicate pink panties with the tiny bows and lace decorating the front. Dean’s cock was twitching and leaking against the fabric, and Cas smirked as he ran a single finger down the length.

"Cas, home," Dean gasped, pushing him back with effort, then spinning him to pin him against the passenger door in turn.
Dean chuckled hoarsely, and murmured softly in return. “It’s sweet that you think that one t-shirt has a prayer of cleaning up the flood that’s gonna happen as soon as you slip loose.”
Dean grinned at him. “Nothing saying I can’t go back to sleep. I love you, Cas.”
Cas chuckled and raised his coffee to her. “As half of the male gorgeousness, and one hundred percent flaming homo, thanks for the compliment. Your hair is
“When we decide it's time, if we decide to, you are gonna fill me with so many pups, aren't you Samsquatch?” Gabe purred. “But for now, I wanna be filled with burgers. What's the name of this place?”
“I live alone. I had to move out, my brothers all snore horribly.”
"Mmm, fuck, yeah, let's go home," Dean murmured with a sigh, his eyes closing as his head rolled back. The sudden stillness in the car caught his attention and he opened his eyes to find Cas staring at him, his blue eyes wide and his jaw dropped open in a surprised expression.
“Nothing tastes that good,” he countered, and watched as a sly, wicked smile crossed Dean’s lips.
“Love you too, Gabe.”
Dean jerked his head back to stare. “You’re serious?”
Dean shouted profanities as he climbed to the edge, hovering above a steep precipice, dangling on a hair between agony and ecstasy as his body was used and worshipped by the man fucking him senseless. “Cas, Cas!
“Most don't last,” the brunette said with a sly look.
To everyone leave kudos and comments, thank you so much! 😘
” Cas grunted as he thrust, praise falling from his lips for him. “My good Omega, my mate, you feel so good.”
“Alpha, I want… I want you to tie me up, and I want you to use the paddle on me.”
“Anything. Tell me what you need, Gabe. Come on, this is all for you, baby, tell me what you need.”
With one last stinging bite to his collarbone, Cas pushed up on his elbows and grinned down at Dean, his lips swollen and rosier than usual. A flush decorated his cheeks and his hair was mussed, looking like he'd just rolled out of bed after a rough and tumble bout of sex, and Dean had to bite back a moan at that image. He pulled Cas down for another slow kiss, then they broke apart again, breathing soft laughter against each other's lips.
I'm alive! I've got the next couple chapters already written, so we'll have a few semi-regular updates. Thank you to all my readers for bearing with me as I try to manage my shit. Love you all!
He parked Baby and headed for the front door, unlocking it with his key, which made him grin again. He jogged across the living area and through the door in the kitchen that led to the garage from inside. He pulled Baby in carefully and hit the button, grateful for the double garage so both he and Cas would be able to park, if Cas’ pimpmobile ever made it out of the garage. Seemed to be just one thing after another with that car.
"D-Dean," he stuttered, his head thrown back on the pillows, his lip caught again between his teeth. Dean groaned at the sight, revelling in the touch, the scent, and sounds of his lover.
Another chapter of Sam and Gabe, but we have a touch of Dean and Cas as well. Enjoy!

"That so?" Dean gave a cocky smile, eyeing the man in return. He was about Dean’s own height, with sexed-up dark hair, gorgeous blue eyes, and was dressed in cowboy boots, dark jeans, and an AC/DC t-shirt. Dean loved the shirt, even if it seemed slightly out of place in the country bar. He also had several rings piercing each ear and one in his eyebrow. Dean wondered idly what else he might have pierced. In other words, everything about him had Dean's inner wolf sitting up with its tail wagging.
Dean reached back and silenced him with his fingers over his lips. “You got tested, you’re clean. So’m I.” He took a breath, then settled back on his stomach, stretching luxuriously. “Now get back here and fuck me raw.”
Dean's mouth went dry, and he scooped a bit of flaky crust and sweet filling onto his fork. Lifting it slowly to Cas' lips, he held his breath. Cas' eyes flicked from his own to the fork, then rather than take the mouthful, he pulled the fork from Dean's fingers and set it on his plate. While Dean was looking down in confusion, Cas moved. A hand suddenly fisted in his shirt, jerking him up out of his seat. Lips pressed against his, stealing his breath as he gasped, then a tongue flicked against his lips. Cas moaned.
The BBQ from Dean's POV, Charlie and Gilda return, the events of the evening after everyone leaves.
"Hey, those were my favourite jeans!" he complained, even as Cas ripped his own shirt free and unbuckled his belt. The slow drag of his zipper made Dean's cock jump, then a sharp slap landed on his ass. "Ah, fuck!"
It was approaching ten in the morning, and he knew he needed to tell his brothers. He typed out a long text to Jimmy and Balth, knowing Cassie was either still busy or running through his woods after a disappointing encounter.
Cas breathed reverently. He trailed a gentle finger over the lace carefully, then lifted his face to stare up at Dean. Dean's breath caught in his throat at the pure lust on Cas' face, then suddenly he found himself on his back, barely having seen Cas move. His jeans were stripped down his legs and shoved aside in a heartbeat, and Cas stooped to settle between Dean's legs, his blue eyes blazing hungrily, as he stared up Dean's body.
” he breathed softly and took Cas’ hand in his. “How did you do that? So far, It’s only happened when I’ve been threatened, or when--” He broke off, blushing slightly as he remembered when both their hands shifted. He glanced at his mate and Cas simply winked at him.
Dean grinned. Now, this he could get into. They debated back and forth for a while. Dean eventually went with the classic, cherry, and Cas ordered a slice of key lime pie.
Dean saw the moment it happened and it sent a thrill down his spine. His Omega let out a howl of triumph, surging forward in his mind, intent on leading his Alpha on a chase. For the first time, Dean could see Cas’ wolf in his mind's eye, an enormous black-furred beast, with cerulean eyes that were both familiar and utterly alien.
“Sure, but I need to talk to the bartender anyway. That is, if we can pry him away. He's been chatting with that guy for twenty minutes.”
Sam must have noticed the tiniest hint of self-consciousness on Gabe's face at that, and he scooped the other man into his arms, Gabe's legs wrapping instinctively around his waist.
“Dammit Charlie, I don't need to know that!”
Dean's arm fell away to the side and he stared wide-eyed at Cas, his green eyes nearly swallowed by black pupil and a gold Omega rim. Cas growled against his hip, then stalked his way up Dean's body, his heavy cock brushing against Dean's thigh, his hip, then settling hot against Dean's. He claimed his mate's lips and Dean wrapped his arms and legs desperately around his Alpha, moaning into the kiss. His fingers were tugging at Cas’ hair, and he was rutting against Cas frantically, dripping precome steadily, creating a slick glide, the head of his cock catching against Cas’.
Hours later Dean was hoarse and begging, straining against the ropes tying his arms and legs to the bed as Cas tongue-fucked him mercilessly, tears streaming from his eyes as he pleaded with the gorgeous man who’d taken him apart and put him back together twice already since leaving the bar. His hole was gaping, dripping with lube and spit, and Cas drove four fingers into him past the knuckle, only stopping because his thumb caught, splayed wide.
The following summer.
“Alpha,
"You want this?" Cas growled, his bedroom voice shivering down Dean's spine and making his body clench around nothing in anticipation. "You want me inside you?"
"Oh, I am going to break you," he growled, cupping Dean's jaw in one large, strong hand and forcing his mouth open. Dean all but purred as he was man-handled, then the stranger was fucking his mouth, his heavy cock hitting the back of Dean's throat with every thrust, until Dean was drooling and gagging and loving every moment. His eyes were watering, he knew, and he stared up at his rescuer through a sheen of tears as Blue-Eyes ravaged his mouth. The man’s chest was heaving under the hold of the corset vest, his free hand holding onto the top of the stall door for support. Dean's hands slid back to his ass and pulled him deeper, until the head of his cock was pushing down his throat.
Tossing back his shot of something called a purple nurple, Dean's eyes popped at the hit of alcoholic sweetness. Shaking his head sharply, he ordered another, then another. He fired them back, looking around hopefully. Dean planned on being a sloppy mess by the end of the night, in more ways than one.
Cas raised a superior eyebrow, and Dean found himself shifting in his seat. Hopefully, Cas would take his squirming for discomfort at the lie, rather than the reality of a burgeoning issue in his jeans. "According to Sam, there's a fourth movie, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
"Impossible, infuriating,
Charlie spun next and the bottle stopped pointing at Benny's girlfriend, Andrea, and Benny gave a teasing growl as the two women locked lips for a moment. Charlie broke the kiss after a second and waggled her eyebrows, then it was Meg's turn.
“Sorry, Gabriel, didn't see you down there!”
“I take it you're good with your hands then.”
Thanks to Mal for betaing, as always!
Then imagine how blue Cas' balls must be.
“Holy shit… keep talking like that, you're gonna make me cream my panties, Cas.” Dean sent the other man a flirtatious grin, seeing how his eyes widened, a tiny sliver of red appearing for a moment at the nickname. Or maybe it was the comment about panties. “Shit, sorry. Castiel is a bit of a mouthful.”
“Oh no, I don’t need that kinda info about my baby brother.”
Cas had bent to pick up the blindfold, but at the endearment he let out a groan, and sank down on the bed next to his mate. Dean rolled to face him, as much as the cuffs would allow. Cas cupped his fingers gently over Dean’s jaw, and leaned in. At first just their noses bumped against each other, the lightest of nuzzling touches. Then Cas tilted Dean’s face gently, and their lips met slowly, tenderly, barely moving. Cas could feel his perpetually chapped lips catching slightly against Dean’s, and suddenly Dean’s tongue was brushing over the seam of his lips. He smiled into the kiss, parting his lips for his Omega, who groaned against him for a split second before his tongue was delving past and tangling with his own. He moaned, and nearly lost himself in the kiss, but slowly, so slowly, pulled himself back. He rested his forehead against Dean’s, breathing in the scent of his mate and their pups, and a low rumble of contentment rose in his chest.
Cas rolled his hips lazily, drawing Dean deeper again, and let out a contented moan. "You won't."
He locked up the garage and double checked the front door, which was just as well, as he’d left it open. They were pretty secluded, with the closest neighbour more than a mile down the highway, plus the long driveway adding to it further, but still. He knew his Alpha would not be happy if he left the door unlocked and himself and their pups at risk, no matter how slight.

“Happy to have fed your Omega, Samalam?” Gabe chuckled.
“Whatsa matter, shortstack? Jealous
“Mmm. Particularly busy when we've got the bull running, but yeah, we do alright. Opened three months ago. I know it's a country bar, but so you know, Thursdays are a classic rock night. We get a mixed crowd for that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Cas?"
"Free beer when you last the eight seconds," the man told him with an appraising look, his voice like gravel.
having a game night on that screen. I hadn't told
Cas groaned, fighting the instinct to mark his lover. If he tasted him that way now, he would lose control and pop his knot. And that wasn't happening until he was inside his mate again. Instead, he licked a stripe from Dean's collarbone, up his neck, to the sensitive spot just behind his ear. Dean whined again, but stayed still underneath him, pliant and submissive. Cas’ inner Alpha was urging him to take his mate, but Cas wanted his answer.
“Fuck you, Cassie!” the bartender replied merrily, a twinkle in his eyes.
man, I could just…" He broke off with an absolutely unangelic moan as Dean rolled his hips under him; then their mouths met, tongues tangling as Cas captured Dean's lips.
Blue-Eyes nodded, starting to step back, and Dean panicked, not wanting to lose the guy already. Slipping his arms down around the guy's waist, he pulled him close, knowing the half-chub he was sporting from the kiss would be evident as their hips met. Those blue eyes widened and his smile turned predatory. He gave Dean an assessing gaze, and Dean leaned forward, nibbling along the stranger's jaw to his ear.
“You don't give her sex. I do.” Charlie smirked.
There was a low grumble from his right as Lisa seemed to protest the call, but Dean was already moving, crawling across the floor to meet his best friend who had moved forward to greet him. Dean set one hand on Cas' shoulder as he wobbled, then Cas shifted and Dean was falling. Cas caught him easily, his blue eyes wide and full of laughter from mere inches away.
Cas finally wakes up.
"You have no idea. He keeps eating my inventory!" Cas growled, and Dean bit back a whimper as his body struggled valiantly to respond. For perhaps the first time in his adult life, nothing happened, and he was grateful, but still, he ached.
Dean cut him off, practically bolting for the door as Gabe cackled behind him. Cas’ low rumbling laughter nearly enticed him into staying, but he made it out to the parking lot.
“I'm a younger brother, remember?” Cas smirked, as Ellen and Bobby burst out laughing. “I'm guessing Sam can still pull it on you.”
“Yeah…” Castiel said softly, nodding his head. He cleared his throat once. “I take it the Roadhouse is a favourite?” Cas asked with a smile, changing the subject. “And about the beer…”
“The leftovers…” Dean protested.
scent gland.
"Them's fighting words, Cas," Dean threatened, which only served to goad Cas into a full, rumbling belly laugh. His head went back, and Dean found his gaze pulled to the long line of Cas' throat, the tan skin enticing. Luckily, before he had to remember how to form words, their waitress returned with their desserts.
"He's gone." The man had a deep, velvet-over-gravel voice that was made for sex and Dean shivered.
Cas gave a low laugh. “No, that’d be Luci, or rather, Lucifer.”
, by the way. My brother would love to get his hands on it. He studied, briefly, as a stylist.”
He turned to Dean, who was watching the display of righteous anger with a satisfied smirk.
Cas' fingers were warm and gentle as they cupped his chin, forcing his head up to make eye contact. "I know, Dean." He gave a soft, tender smile, full of understanding. "I love you, too."
"said I"
“Quit your moaning, you had it coming. Now, since you were here for dinner last night, and boasting about how you'd be lasting the eight seconds on that mechanical bull over at Milton's, and since you said his name
“See something you like, Alpha?” Dean teased, and purred when the expected smack landed against his overheated skin. “Mmmm… feels so good Alpha. You got my ass all red, Cas? Practically burning to the touch? Want your knot, Alpha, want you to fuck me til I’m screaming, til I spend the day limping, dripping with your come. Want everyone to know I’m yours, want anyone who gets near me to know I’m claimed, mated, bred. Wanna ride that knot of yours until I’m screaming your name, angel.” Dean paused, listening to the harsh breathing of his mate, and goaded him. “Is that what I need to do Alpha? Slip outta these cuffs, knock you on that delicious ass of yours, and ride you the way I rode that bull last night? Or are you gonna
Gabe found himself melting against the Alpha, which was interesting considering he was still balls deep in Gabe at that moment.  They reached their room, and Sam simply stepped onto the bed, and walked to the head of the bed, where he turned and carefully lowered them until his back was against the headboard.
“Yes.”
A moment later, Cas' hand wrapped around his cock for the first time, and Dean shuddered, his eyes closing in bliss. The angle was awkward, it was too dry, and Cas was clearly unsure.
“That's too bad, angel, because you always smell like sex to me.”
He kicked off his boots into the closet and headed for the bedroom, dropping his duffel on the floor on his side of the bed and stripping out of his clothes.
They swayed where they stood, their hands caressing over skin that shivered under each new touch. One of Cas' thumbs brushed over a nipple, and Dean shuddered. Cas smirked at him, then pushed him over on the bed. Crawling over him, prowling closer like a great jungle cat, he bent and traced his tongue lightly over Dean's nipple, toying with the other with gentle fingers.
“I know this is quick, but… I’m crazy about you. Like, you’re awesome, and I just..” He trailed off, uncertain how to continue.
Cas kissed him back desperately for a moment, then pulled back, panting.
Cassie interrupted.
“S’okay, m’not complaining,” he slurred. He felt his arms being freed and rubbed gently, then Cas was running a warm cloth over his chest and stomach, cleaning up from the spunk and sweat. Dean blinked, wondering when Cas had left to get that. A minute later he was being tucked under a warm blanket, Cas’ arms wrapping around him.
, Alpha, fuck me, take me, come on!”
"Can we pick this back up later?" Cas asked. Dean felt the happiness bubbling up in his chest and let out a soft chuckle.
“Cas, wrong answer,” Charlie warned him.
Dean keened at the intrusion, and Cas began a slow, rolling thrust into his tight heat. The position made Dean so tight, and Cas groaned at the squeeze around his cock.
Cas stepped back abruptly and shook his head roughly. “This drive is going to suck,” Cas declared in a low growl, and when Dean turned to face him, he saw pure Alpha in the red eyes watching his every move.
Dean heads back to the bar, trying to find Cas, then has dinner with Sam and Eileen.
Gabe swiftly bent and captured his mate's lips, and rocked his hips faster, burying his face against Sam's throat with a growl, the scent of mate and home driving him as he slid over him, Sam's cock filling him deliciously, a constant pressure against his prostate. Gabe was leaking precome steadily, and his cock slid against Sam's abs in a wet glide with each movement of his hips. Already Gabe could feel his body tightening, the electric buzz of his impending orgasm sending little sparks down his limbs as the pooling heat in his gut wound tighter and tighter.
Dean grinned as he sang the next lines, his eyes twinkling with mischief as his hands roved over his lover. “
Hey folks, sorry for the delay on this, had some difficulties today. All is well!
Cas chuckled softly against his skin, sucking dark marks into his inner thighs. After what Dean was sure was an eternity, Cas pulled the plug free and tossed it aside on the bed. Dean whined as it slipped loose, feeling empty and desperate, only to cry out as Cas' tongue found his hole and slipped into his body.
“Holy fuck,” he breathed, drawing a low, satisfied chuckle from his lover. Cas slipped from his body then and Dean grimaced. “Hope you’ve got another blanket handy though. And a good dry cleaner you can recommend.”
Dean’s chest was heaving in his distress, drawing Cas’ eyes to the nipple clamps shining in the morning light. Still his hands were behind his back, and he realized Dean had used the second pair of cuffs on himself. Dean rubbed his face against his shoulder to knock the blindfold askew, and his green eyes were wide and distressed, his scent sour with panic.
Settling in comfortably, Dean flicked his tongue out and tasted Cas, moaning against his skin. Cas gasped at his touch and squirmed, biting his lip as he stared down the length of his body.
Dean mused. Well, he'd have to see what he could do to arrange that for his little brother, the moose.
"You praying, angel? Not sure I like the idea of those bastards seeing you like this," he teased before slowly pressing a spit-slick finger against his hole, then letting out a low growl of approval as it sank into Cas' body. He teased his finger in and out slowly, then when Cas looked down at him with those wild blue eyes again, crooked his finger, unerringly pressing against Cas' prostate.
“Jo?” he said softly, his voice rough. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Can we get the bill and a coupla to-go boxes?”
Dean slowly moved backwards towards the door, tugging Cas along. His hands slid down Cas' back and settled at his waist, grabbing the belt of his trench coat. He pulled Cas flush against him, then the door was at his back and Cas was pressing kisses down his throat. Cas fumbled with his keys as he nipped and sucked a mark onto Dean's throat, the warmth of arousal curling in Dean's gut, shivers flying down his spine. He pulled Cas' hips firmly against his own, moaning as the half-chub he was sporting ground against a similar bulge in Cas' pants.
Gabe smirked and asked, “Do you really wanna know what he sent me?”
Cas drew back a little. He searched his Omega’s eyes, but simply found a certain shy eagerness, and a heat that had Cas’ blood heading south in a rush.
Dean blinked for a moment, then looked back over his shoulder. Cas was stripping his jeans as he watched, his heavy cock red with arousal and dripping precome that made his mouth water.
A few years later...
"I won't. I like them." Cas kissed along his neck softly, down his spine, then slowly pulled his panties down, exposing his sore, reddened cheeks and the plug between them. "Now this… this was unexpected."
"Dean?" Cas called his name softly, breaking into his morose thoughts.
“Spoilsport,” Dean complained.
They pulled up to the Roadhouse and Dean threw the car into park. He was across the bench and into Cas’ lap before the engine stopped turning over.
Dean felt his face flame as she spoke, having had no intention of letting Cas know he'd made changes to the appointment details. He glanced up at his Alpha through his lashes and was met with a look of such tenderness that he nearly melted on the spot.
And Cas shifted. Dean stared for a moment, then slunk down onto the floor, and knelt before his Alpha.
Charlie gave them a look full of amused disgust. "Go, before you spontaneously combust."
Thanks to Malmuses for her wonderful help as my beta, as always!
"Did you just take my picture?" Dean asked, his voice low and raspy from the abuse his throat had taken. He gave a cocky grin, knowing what he must look like.
Dean stared at Cas in confusion. “Ellen has been a surrogate mom to me ever since mine died, so I’ve known Jo since she was in diapers. I have never in my life seen her warm up to someone that quickly, especially if she was feeling all Alpha-y because it was me or Sam involved. And what question? I missed that.”
Dean moaned. “Jesus, Baby, you tryin’ to kill me?” Stumbling up the stairs he made for the bedroom as quickly as he could, then crawled up onto the bed, laying on his stomach. Cas paused as he entered the bedroom, dropping his vest and stripping out of his slacks and socks, then tossing his tie and shirt across the room. Gloriously nude, Cas stalked closer, his cock standing out proudly from his hips. Dean groaned against the pillow as he watched his lover approach and rutted lightly against the mattress, seeking friction for his aching cock.
"Patience, Dean," Cas told him, his low voice amused.
As he was contemplating, Pam took the first spin, which landed on Kevin. The kid blushed furiously, and Victor, Pam's boyfriend, scowled, then broke into a large grin.
"You could just, what, Cas?" Dean broke the kiss to breathe hot against his lover's ear. "Kiss me? Spank me? Choke me on your cock so I can't sass you any more?"
“Dean, talk to me, Omega-mine.”
busy around Cas’ cock. Cas moved to sink his hands into Dean’s hair, only to discover he’d been cuffed to the headboard. His gasp as Dean gave a hard suck on the head of his cock must have drawn Dean’s attention, because the next thing he knew, he was looking down at his Omega who was smirking up at him, but with his eyes blindfolded, and his arms were behind his back. Dean flicked his tongue out to tease the sensitive spot below the head, and Cas jerked at the cuffs again.
