"And that's the pub in which daddy got rather inebriated," he chuckled, glancing up at John as he pointed. John knew he was referencing the stag night...jeeze, they hadn't just been 'rather inebriated'. They'd been pissed as chooks! "And then, across from there is where we found a pair of legs. Nothing else attached, mind you. Just the legs."
It would be several days before Sherlock would wake up. In those several days, John was discharged from hospital and picked up Rosie from Mrs Hudson who was worried sick. He ended up sleeping in the chair by Sherlock's bed with Rosie bundled in his arms rather than going home because he didn't think he could handle sleeping alone. During the day, Rosie would play on the floor among blankets Mrs Hudson had brought around and John took to reading some of his first blog stories out loud to Sherlock.
With that, Sherlock strode from the sitting room, into his bedroom and closed the door with a snap, leaving John feeling very wrong footed and mightily baffled in his armchair by the fire. There was no point hammering on his door and demanding answers; he'd probably get yelled at or a bullet hole in the wall for his troubles. So, after heaving a deep sigh of frustration, John rose and went to bed.
If you love someone, set them free. If they never come back, they were never yours. If they return, they were always yours.
Once Greg was gone, John sagged, no longer needing to throw up his soldier's facade. Sherlock knelt before him, still holding his shoulders, and they just stayed like that, breathing. John had no idea how he was going to handle this. He wasn't equipped to deal with family. His family with Mary and Rosie and Sherlock had been so complicated that he didn't know how to go about working with a family which was complicated in a different way.
This time, when John kissed him, Sherlock responded. True, he wasn't overly experienced or anything but it still made John tremble inside. Sherlock's hands sneaked around John's back, pulling him a little closer and John slid his own hands into Sherlock's hair again. Their bodies pressed together, lips joined, they held each other and knew, in that infinite moment, that there was nothing in this world that could keep them apart. John knew Mary would be happy for him. He was pretty sure she knew. She knew when she was alive. She knew the secret that John had in his heart, even though he didn't know it himself. Finally, they broke apart and John was about to move back and give Sherlock some space but he kept holding him, pulling him into an embrace.
"Sherlock, what happened?" John's voice was soft, trying to ease Sherlock from his dazed state of mind. "Goddamn it Sherlock!"
"I'm here to see Harry Watson," John spoke without a tremor in his tone, even in his shocked state still managing to sound as though he was pulling rank. "Detective Inspector Lestrade said that it wouldn't be a problem?"
"I thought so," Mrs Hudson said, clearly pleased with herself. With that, she turned to leave. John hastened after her.
John didn't quite know what to say. Was Sherlock mad? Was he happy? John wasn't very good at figuring out what emotion, if any, Sherlock was feeling and the little frown wasn't helping matters. For one thing, it distracted John immensely because it made the space between Sherlock's eyebrows scrunch together in little ripples and eyes to become slightly shadowed. It also was Sherlock's occasional poker face, hiding what he really thought of something. Or, it was his confused face which John rather thought it might have been.
Distress was written all over the other man's face and John knelt on the edge of the bed, wondering if he really ought to listen to his inner desires. He wasn't sure what Sherlock would think but he just couldn't help himself. He didn't want to leave Sherlock to fight off his dreams on his own. John sucked in some air and then hoisted his whole body onto Sherlock's bed before sliding into the crisp sheets. Sherlock rolled over and grabbed at the pillow John was about to put his head on. John covered Sherlock's hand with his own and held it. Suddenly, Sherlock relaxed and muttered something about swearing to keep someone safe. Then he became tense again, twisting and turning away from John so that John had a prime view of his back which was thinly muscled and very pale. Sherlock's body thrashed and John instinctively wound his arms around Sherlock, pulling him close so that he just held him, making sure he didn't throw himself around too much, didn't hurt himself somehow. And Sherlock fully relaxed this time, breaths evening out so he sounded deeply asleep. John, satisfied, closed his eyes and rested his head on Sherlock's back. He was passed out in seconds.
"Hello little Rosie," he growled, gliding closer to John and Rosie. Rosie burst into peels of giggles and reached out to grab at Sherlock who darted back, baring his teeth. "I've come to eat you up!"
"But how?" Greg folded his arms, as if already knowing and expecting the answer. He was just playing along.
John didn't dream. Not this time. His body was too weary, his head too tired and his heart too sore. All he knew is that he needed to tell Sherlock something before it burned a hole any further into his heart. His eyes were still closed, a world of black, but he could hear Sherlock breathing deeply beside him. Something was beeping, machines hissing. Hospital. John was in hospital. He took a moment to marvel at the irony of the situation. Usually, he was the one looking at the person in bed. This time, he was the patient. Slowly, he opened his eyes. Sherlock sat right beside the bed, eyes closed and slumped in his chair, fast asleep. His hair was limp and his face shadowed. How long had John been here? He couldn't tell and someone had removed his wrist watch. He felt remarkably better now; his head no longer pounded with sheer ferocity and the aching in his body was gone, though he figured that had something to do the morphine drip attached to him. John blinked to clear his vision properly and gazed at Sherlock again. He needed to tell him something. It was eating him up, consuming him and it had been for a very long time. He just never knew it.
John knelt on the gravel which dug into his knees, still trying to prevent himself from throwing up. Sherlock rushed to him, dropping his gun and grabbing John's shoulders, holding him upright so he didn't faceplant.
"My boyfriend," John said. All at once, Sherlock began spluttering and coughing and had to dash to the sink to fetch a glass of water. Sniggering, John threw the slightly damp cloth at Sherlock which hit the middle of his back and slid to the floor, leaving a damp mark behind it. "Settle down you drama queen," he said. "Jesus, anyone would think it was some kind of curse word!"
Rosie blew a few bubbles and then started babbling again, grinning all the while. Then she pulled John's hair. "Dadda!"
"I know you're not the most comfortable person with...you know...open acts of affection," John forged through what he wanted to say, knowing it needed saying, knowing he needed to let Sherlock know he didn't want any more or any less than Sherlock was comfortable of giving.
John didn't know what to say but it didn't matter because they were kissing again and John had brought his hands around to trace Sherlock's face, slide his index finger across Sherlock's tight jaw and down his neck. Sherlock shivered and John didn't go any further. There were boundaries and John respected every single inch of them. He didn't care that they wouldn't join like other couples because it didn't matter. He loved Sherlock like nothing else and judging by Sherlock's behavior, those feelings were very much requited.
Over the course of the early morning, John bustled around playing with Rosie (this involved making goo-goo sounds, throwing teddies in the air, laughing, blowing raspberries on her stomach and mussing up his hair for her to tug), making breakfast (French toast with bacon and banana for Rosie and oats with milk and yoghurt for John), sewing the ear back onto Rosie's favourite teddy bear that had been a gift from Lestrade, washing up, keeping the fire going and waiting for either a text from Sherlock or for him to return. It seemed his life revolved around that man. Well, and Rosie, of course.
But Greg didn't answer. John turned back to the matter at hand, on the lookout for more blood. He really wished he had his gun now. There was more blood staining the wooden floor and John knew that his suspicions had been correct. Something fishy was going on. Sherlock would be rubbing his hand together gleefully, telling everyone that the case was finally getting fun. But John wasn't Sherlock and instead of being delighted, John was on high alert. He had a premonition of dread that something was about to happen. It was that cliché movie line that gave it away; it was quiet. Too quiet. As if the house was waiting, holding its breath, waiting to spring into life. John's heart beat faster, a seed of fear blooming in his stomach, curling into his chest and limbs. Tension gripped his body and he forced it away, knowing that if he had to defend himself, he would need to be fluid, supple. He carefully stepped further down the hallway, coming to another door which was thrown open. John, after straining his ears for some kind of noise, peeked in. It was a bathroom and this was where the trail of blood led. Every cell in his body screamed at him to leave, to go and find Greg, get backup and just get the hell out of there. But Mary and Sherlock had been right. He was addicted to a certain kind of lifestyle, addicted to danger. And so, ignoring the warning bells clanging in his head, John stepped into the bathroom.
"Where's Rosie?" he asked, eyes still covered. Then he whipped his hands away and stared at Rosie with a wide grin. "There she is!"
“Snap out of it,” he muttered to himself as it hit him that he’d been standing there, opened mouthed like a gaping fish, for at least ten minutes. He shook his head a little and shifted to the foot of the bed to check the clipboard which had the information from the last check-up. John checked the name as well. It was an unusual one, he thought, re reading it several times.
"Oh Sherlock," Mrs Hudson called from the table, a touch of motherly exasperation in her tone. "Let him in!"
Several hours after fetching Harry from the pub, John was making lunch. Or, he was trying to. He kept being distracted by Sherlock and Harry who were having a very serious conversation by the fire in the sitting room. Every now and then, Harry would make some indignant explanation but Sherlock would calm her with some quiet words. He was getting better at this, John thought as he checked on Rosie who was propped up by the cupboards at his feet, chewing on a soft prune John had decided to try her on. According to Google, he should be starting to offer her some solid foods. Not too solid, mind you, mushy stuff or stuff she could chew on. This parenting gig was complicated and John wasn't 100% sure he was doing it right but hang the rules! Rosie was turning out alright, he figured and if something wasn't going well, he knew he could consult Mrs Hudson. John gave the pasta a final stir before hoisting the pot off the stove and taking it to the sink where he drained the water out. He plonked the pot on the bench and then fetched the chicken and cheesy sauce in its pan from the other element on the stove. He tipped the chicken into the pasta, gave it all a big stir around and stepped back, satisfied. Hell yeah, he could be domestic! He fetched three bowls from the cupboard and served lunch. Then he picked up Rosie, settled her on his hip and headed into the sitting room.
"So pretty, too," Molly was crouching down beside Rosie who was fixated upon a little wooden toy that Greg had dropped off a couple of days ago, along with some gifts for under the tree. John suspected that Rosie was going to be very spoiled this Christmas.
"I'll have a look," John decided, extremely spur of the moment. He needed to get out of the flat and really needed some fresh air. Greg looked almost doubtful for a moment but John climbed to his feet. Just as he was debating the ethics of taking Rosie with him in his head, Mrs Hudson poked her nose in.
He whipped his head round to see Sherlock standing in the doorway, eyes bleary and pyjamas rumpled. His hair lay in messy curls and he looked confused which wasn't a look Sherlock wore very often.
"I'm happy for you," Molly nodded rapidly and took another gulp of wine. John thought it wise not to say anymore to her and instead turned his attention to Rosie who was dipping her fingers in her bowl of custard and then sucking on them, mouth turning upwards with glee each time. She had pudding all over her face and bib and John could do nothing but sigh in good humour. Meanwhile, Greg was now peppering Sherlock with questions, asking how on earth him and John had ended up hooking up. Sherlock was avoiding most of them and John could see he was dangerously close to retreating to his facade of pretending not to care. Hastily, John gave Greg a swift rundown of a simplified version of the events that had occurred after he'd been discharged from the hospital. When he was done, Greg simply stared at him, wonder on his face. Finally, he opened his mouth to speak, a slow and smug grin sliding onto his face.
"What is it?" he asked. Rosie grabbed a chunk of his shirt and began sucking on it. "No, no, Rosie, don't do that," he begged her, trying to remove it from her mouth. She didn't let go and he gave up, figuring he'd just change it later and throw it in the wash.
Then he tucked his phone into his pocket and turned to face the door which was now open and an old man stood there, looking slightly confused at the police presence. Greg was trying to explain that he'd been here earlier and was inquiring about the missing items. John noticed right away that the man had some muscular disease or irregularity; his hands were shaking and he looked unsteady on his feet. Concerned that the man might topple over, John leaned closer to Greg and whispered, "He needs to sit down."
"Merry Christmas, John," Harry replied, making her way to the couch. John opened his mouth and then closed it while Sherlock couldn't quite contain a grin. Shaking his head in exasperation, John announced they should probably have breakfast before they opened Christmas presents. The grin slid off Sherlock's face like hot butter in a pan and for one wild second, John thought he might throw a tantrum.
"Fair enough," Sherlock said, not quite making eye contact. John lowered his voice a little and moved closer to Sherlock, almost subconsciously eliminating the space between them.
John eased the door to the cancer ward open and slipped through, suddenly wanting to keep his footsteps quiet. He wasn’t quite sure why; perhaps he was loath to disturb the strange quiet that infected this part of the hospital. The quiet movement of the dying. The first ward he entered contained three young kids, all with various forms of leukemia, all part of the slowly rotating cast of the ill. They were all in good spirits, which pleased John, their vitals checked out and one of the girls offered him a chocolate that had been left by an aunt during a morning visit. Sucking the peppermint chocolate, he fished a loose coin from his pocket and performed a quick sleight of hand to the delight of the kids. He was fairly rubbish at magic tricks, but this was one that he could complete swiftly to entertain young children. He waved happily to them and left the ward, heading over to the ward across the corridor. This one was home to a single man, somewhere in his sixties with a lavishly decorated bedside table. He was sleeping when John checked his vitals, so John was glad that they all checked out. There was no need to press buttons and make loud sounds. He slipped out without disturbing the snoozing. John visited seven more wards, each with varying moods but all with positive vitals.
"Sherlock," he whispered, his voice hoarse and dusty. Sherlock didn't move, still sleeping. "I love you."
"Uh, yes," John said hastily, taking out his notebook and pen again. "You reported some missing items?"
"Alright," Sherlock said amicably, clearly not holding anything against John for speaking up about Mycroft. Instead, he looked relieved to be going to bed. The pair slung their arms around each other and headed to their room in comfortable silence. As they climbed into bed, John wondered if Mycroft really was up to something. But maybe, just maybe he was lonely. Even the greatest minds needed people around them.
John was baffled. That was what this silence was all about? Not because they thought he was some creeper staring at patients in the cancer ward? He shrugged. “We’ve got good banter.”
But John was sure of himself. "Did you see the way Mr Hall looked at his wife? He was waiting for something. And she definitely knows something."
It was Christmas Eve and the snow had piled up around the window that overlooked the street at 221B. John had strung up fairy lights so they glowed their rainbow drops, framing the snow and looking terribly festive. Mrs Hudson had allowed them to use her little Christmas tree because she said that Rosie ought to have one. This had resulted in John attempting to decorate it while Rosie got tangled up in tinsel and fairy lights and Sherlock pretended to help but was actually just playing with the baubles, rolling them across the floor and then chasing them, pinning them down moments before they were lost under the couch. Presents had slowly been piling up under the base of the tree; Molly Hooper had dropped by with a paper bag which she emptied under the tree and hugged John and Sherlock before kissing Rosie on the head.
Silence. John eased himself into his chair opposite Sherlock's and eyed his friend. Sherlock was still staring in exactly the same place. His jaw had tightened somewhat and his eyes were rimmed with red.
"Yeah, the couple aren't the most 'there' pair of people we've ever dealt with. If you ask me, they really ought to be in a rest home or something. They said that the items were small, made of wood and a gift from 'someone special'. They couldn't afford to lose them, apparently," Greg explained. John's curiosity was piqued. He knew Sherlock would be interested now, asking lots of questions that John wouldn't think to ask in a million years. He figured he'd just have to poke around, check things out and maybe, the years of spending time with Sherlock Holmes would serve him well, though he doubted it. He always failed to notice the things Sherlock saw right through.
"Did you have a nice ride, John?" the man asked. He'd dropped his Irish accent and now sounded like a very common Londoner, leaving out letters and mispronouncing most of his words. Guttersnipe, Sherlock would have called it.
Sherlock mumbled something incoherent and stumbled into the kitchen, bumping into the stack of books he'd left there from the night before. John couldn't help but smile. Sherlock could be a right pain in the ass but, none the less, he was John's pain in the ass, hands in the fridge and all.
"Because of her name," Greg was looking right at John now and didn't look happy to pass on this information. "Harry Watson."
"Of course, sir," the officer said, lowering his arm to allow them access. "Cell number thirteen. I'll let you in."
"What are you doing in my bed?" Sherlock asked, self-consciously pulling the sheet further up his chest.
Sherlock's eyebrows crashed together in his confusion but he made the wise decision not to press the issue. Instead, he looked back to Greg. "You were explaining?"
With those words, those words between them, John leaned forwards and kissed Sherlock. He had never imaged doing that, pressing his lips to Sherlock's but it felt right. Somehow, inexplicably, it felt right. His heart was thundering but not from fear this time. His hands snaked around Sherlock's neck and tangled in his curly hair, holding him. Sherlock didn't move, didn't kiss him back. Suddenly, all at once, John felt terrible. Sherlock wasn't that kind of guy! He drew back, letting Sherlock go and hastily began apologizing, voice tripping over itself. God, why on earth did he do that? Sherlock was not one for open displays of affection and just imposing it on him was unbelievably stupid and rude.
"I had a really good mate, my best friend, Damien. We flew in the same team, our little crack shot team who did the stuff no one else wanted to do. We were the best at our job and we could be relied on. You know what that's like, John? To be relied on?"
"Sit down," he growled, with surprising ferocity. It must have stunned Sherlock a little because the man who never did anything anyone told him to sat back down right away and stared at John in surprise, eyebrows drawn together and forehead creasing. "Now, you tell me what he said. He must have said something pretty damn serious. I've never seen you like that before. You had me worried sick, okay? So, tell me what he said!"
Sherlock arrived home later that day with two wrapped packages tucked into his coat. He placed them carefully under the Christmas tree, positioning them at the peak of the mountain of gifts, arranging them so their name tags faced outwards. John didn't say a word, knowing Sherlock would get huffy otherwise. Instead, he grinned giddily (Christmas really was coming!) and continued folding his shirts. Mrs Hudson had insisted on cooking dinner so she was banging around in the kitchen with Harry, who, as it transpired, was very interested in cooking. Mrs Hudson had taken to Harry almost at once and John was glad. Hopefully Harry saw the family atmosphere and preferred that to the bottle. She was doing really well, not complaining to John once, nor trying to sneak out. Something about talking to Sherlock had changed something in her. John was more than glad. Harry more than deserved to have a better life and John knew she'd hated what she had done to herself. He knew that every time she caved to the lure of booze, she hated herself that little bit more.
"Sherlock?" John wanted to tell the other man something, something that had been preying on his mind for a long time but the words didn't quite make it from his brain to his mouth and he slumped, crumpling into Sherlock's thin arms. The world was spinning, curling away from him and he felt so incredibly useless. Sherlock's face hovered above him, swirling in a mist that covered his eyes. John desperately wanted to tell him something but it kept slipping from his consciousness. He felt himself rising, gliding higher and he realized, with detached wonder, that Sherlock was carrying him. An angel. He looked rather like an angel with a halo of black instead of gold or white and suddenly John remembered what he wanted to tell Sherlock but before he could open his mouth, he was gone.
"She did," John could hardly speak, he was grinning so much. At that moment, Harry rolled off the couch with a crash and hastily leaped to her feet, staring around her in alarm. When she saw John, Sherlock and Rosie, her face relaxed and she looked a little sheepish. She sat back on the couch with a yawn and pulled her blanket over her legs.
"Sherlock, talk to me," John pleaded, leaning forwards and balancing his elbows on his knees. But Sherlock remained unmoving and refusing to speak. It was as if he was deep inside his mind palace with his eyes wide open. He was unreachable in there. But John had never seen him like this and it worried him greatly. He slid off his chair so he knelt in front of Sherlock, grabbing the man's slender hands and holding them.
"Congratulations, John," Sherlock whispered. John drew back for a moment and eyed Sherlock carefully, calculating his next words.
"Sherlock," John said, once the kitchen was clean and he was back to standing in front of the fire, toasting his butt through his jeans. Sherlock mumbled something incoherent, acknowledging John's presence. "I'm going out."
With that, he was gone, flying from the flat in a flurry of coats, scarves and childish vigour. John didn't bother racing after him; he'd get a text if Sherlock wanted him to come and help. He'd become used to that in the years that they had been best friends. Best friends. It was an interesting term, really. You had friends and then you had...best friends. John wondered if Sherlock knew the difference. Then he wondered if he himself knew the difference.
"What news, Sherlock?" Mycroft snapped impatiently. Sherlock sent John a 'can-you-believe-his-nerve?' look before tucking his hands carelessly into the pockets of his trousers and whistling innocently.
"I know," Greg nodded. "She looked like she'd seen hell before the brawl though so we weren't really surprised she'd been involved. No one in the pub knew who she was; apparently she'd just walked in earlier that evening and got angry later on with the blokes for calling her sweetheart. So, when we were talking to her at the station, we asked for ID." Greg paused, gathering his breath. "She's from the Royal Air Force, a fighter jet pilot, a captain of a crack shot team used to sort out the targets no one else wants to hit."
"I said, congratulations," John was grinning again. "You dolt, I'm not the only one who's been a parent!"
"Mycroft, you pick up your phone right now, you understand?" John left the second message of the day. Then he rang again, leaving a slightly angrier message. Then again, with some very curt words that he wouldn't dare say in front of Mrs Hudson. Then again, just telling Mycroft that he'd damn well walk to the Diogenes Club and shout until someone came. Then-
Sherlock looked very pleased indeed and brushed his shirt lapels in satisfaction. Then, with a delicate little twirl of his feet, he made his way over to the paint tins and picked one up, reading the name.
"Family means more to me than you think, Sherlock," Mycroft narrowed his eyes, clutching his umbrella instinctively.
Sighing deeply with weariness, he’d been about to slip out of his doctor’s coat and sling his rain jacket over his shoulders when Lestrade, the hospital director, had come down personally to ask him to oversee some trainees undertaking the removal of internal stitches. Apparently, John was a master at this sort of thing and, considering that he’d been asked by the director himself, he agreed and soon found himself trying to fix the utter mess the trainees had made. Not only had they cut the stitches in the wrong place, they’d also somehow nicked the edge of a lung which resulted in internal bleeding which John then had to patch up, thus keeping the patient in hospital for an extra week. Which did not make their day at all.
Pressed against a canvas sky painted with dusty grey clouds, his coat whipping in the wind and tiny snowflakes tumbling from the heavens to swirl around him, Sherlock stood on the very edge of the hospital roof, a smudge of black against the white, as fragile and fleeting as a leaf caught in a storm. John's heart was thundering harder than it ever had, harder than when the bullet from the Afghan gun tore through his shoulder. It rattled in his chest, fighting against his ribcage and screaming to be free. The pure fear that he felt was unlike anything he had ever experienced. It set an icy fire to his bones and his legs trembled as he held his phone to his ear, staring up at his best friend who stood atop the hospital roof, speaking of notes and apologies.
Bundling Rosie against his chest, Sherlock leaped up from his chair, excited once more. Jesus, he really could be a child sometimes. John rolled his eyes and got out of his chair to join Sherlock and Rosie at the tree. Harry sat down with them, a circle of four around the tree by the window looking out over Baker Street. Before long, the room was filled with sounds of delight and appreciation as presents were opened. John had received a new woolen jersey from Molly, a slightly tasteless tie from Greg (he was terrible at choosing gifts for other adults), a very sweet photo album of him and Sherlock from Mrs Hudson, a gift card for a blokes shop from Mike Stamford, a pair of socks and a striped scarf from Harry and finally, wrapped in plain black wrapping paper from Sherlock, a small velvet box containing black ring, the band smooth and matte. John took it out, turning it over and almost unable to prevent a small tear in his eye. He looked up at Sherlock who was watching him closely.
He was cold. Freezing. He felt it deep in his bones, a debilitating sensation that dragged him awake from a dream where he was drowning with Sherlock, a dream where he was trying so hard to do what he was supposed to do best. Save a life. His eyes snapped open. A hospital bed, tubes in his arms. He'd been here before. A groan ran through him, rather like the shivers of cold left over from the river. It wasn't a dream then. John could recall some of it now, diving into the bitterly cold water, grabbing Sherlock, wrestling him from the coat, swimming upwards and then...nothing. Where was Sherlock now? John tried to wriggle upwards into a sitting position but was pinned down by thick blankets, presumably there to keep him warm. He was alone, very alone. Though he was cold, he felt fine now. He fumbled with his blankets, managing to roll them off. He swung his legs out of bed and set his feet on the floor, not caring that he tugged a tube out of his flesh, making a machine beep in protest. He eased the last few out, dropping them on his bed before standing shakily. His legs wobbled and then held firm. John grabbed one of his blankets, wrapping it around his shoulders, before shuffling from his room, intent on finding Sherlock. The door creaked on its hinges and then he was standing in the empty corridor, wondering how on earth he was going to find Sherlock. A shiver ran through him and he tightened the blanket around his shoulders. His feet made soft patting sounds as he padded down the linoleum, peeking through the glass panels in the doors to each ward. Some were empty, some had patients but none had Sherlock. John rounded a corner, starting to feel oddly uneasy. He peeked through another glass panel and then he saw him. John didn't think, just shoved the door open and hurried over to the bed in which Sherlock lay, still as a stone. Instinctively, John checked the monitors and was relieved. But Sherlock looked so fragile, so small all bundled up in the white sheets. John found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and tracing Sherlock's jaw with his index finger, willing the other man to wake up.
"Mrs Hudson is going to have a field day," John said after a while. "She's going to say 'I told you so' and then she's going to laugh and laugh and laugh."
Harry insisted on sleeping on the couch, despite both John and Sherlock offering their beds to her. She told them they'd already done so much for her and that they could argue about it in the morning. In truth, John was glad to be in bed. This past week had been a hectic mess of emotions, action and then Harry. Not to mention that Rosie had started crawling! Whenever he recalled it, he couldn't help a silly grin spreading over his face, even sprawled out in his bed. As the night breathed around him, he stared at the ceiling, unable to sleep. He was terribly tired but his mind just wouldn't shut up. He thought about the Moriarty imposter and wondered if Sherlock had come up with anything about him yet. He thought about Harry and how he was determined to help her and finally get her dry. He thought about Rosie, how proud he was and how he'd have to move lots of the things in the morning so she couldn't cause a calamity. And he thought about Sherlock. Gosh, when did he not think about Sherlock? John sighed deeply and realized that his mouth was very dry. He needed a drink of water. So he climbed out of bed and padded downstairs to the kitchen where he quietly filled a glass of water and then drank deeply, shuddering a little as the cold water slid down his throat and settled into his stomach. Dim light played across the kitchen floor and John's gaze wandered into the sitting room where the curtains hadn't been properly drawn. Harry was sprawled out on the small couch, legs hanging off the side and a blanket half falling off her singlet clad torso. The fire was still glowing and John put his glass down on the bench before walking to the hearth and putting another couple of pieces of split wood over the coals. Then he glanced at Harry again. A small, fond smile crawled over his face. He crossed the room and rearranged her blanket so it covered her a bit better. She moaned a little in her sleep, face creasing in the dim light and began to roll over. John backed away, not wanting to wake her. Just as he was about to go back to his room, he heard a muffled groan emanating from Sherlock's room. Frowning, John crept up to Sherlock's closed door and listened. The sound came again, a sound of distress and John made a choice. It wasn't a choice he was 100% comfortable with but it was a choice he wanted desperately to make. He eased the door open and sneaked into Sherlock's irritatingly tidy room. It was a pity he was incapable of keeping the rest of the flat like that, John thought.
Obviously, I could not tell Stamford the truth. I could not tell anyone the truth, but especially not Holmes. Which meant I would have to think of a plausible reason for leaving my entire life behind and disappearing from all decent society, perhaps forever.
“Don’t be stupid,” said Lady Percy. “Sit down and drink your coffee. You won’t leave until you are ready to leave. Don’t let those perverts scare you off. Remember that the world is full of evil and you must learn to recognize it for what it is. Only then can you decide if you wish to embrace it or leave it alone. Otherwise you should turn tail and run back to your seminary where you will be safe – although from what I know of some priests, you won’t be all that safe!”
“Oh,” said Holmes. “I almost forgot.” He reached back into his pocket and pulled out a second ticket. “This is for you, James. We can’t have Mr. Wiggins wandering around America all by himself. He will need someone with sense to keep him out of trouble.”
"Could you please watch over Rosie?" John felt terrible, even as he said it. He ought to take her, stop handing her to Mrs Hudson when something came up but the truth was, he didn't want Harry knowing he had a daughter. Not yet. The resentful streak in him didn't want Harry to share in the wonder of having a small human in their life. John wondered if there was something wrong with him. Mrs Hudson nodded at once.
It was a symbolic phone too. Sherlock had deduced his whole life story from it and him; the first time they ever met. A single glance. He'd been very impressed indeed.
"I am trying to help you," John said, folding his arms in front of him and protecting Rosie at the same time. It was a calculated move and it did what it was supposed to do; draw Harry's attention.
"Mrs Hudson, you are too much," John reached for the wall to support himself and at that moment, Sherlock entered the room. John knew, without turning around, that he had come in because he brought in a sort of presence, a regal and imposing presence which intimidated most people but was very familiar and comforting to John.
"Well, I assume you're now perfectly fine," came a curt voice. Sherlock stopped laughing instantly and straightened up, face suddenly composed, the only thing giving him away being the tears of laughter still running down his face. John hiccuped a few times before standing too and clutching Rosie to his shoulder. All dressed in his suit and tie, Mycroft stood in the doorway to the kitchen, his umbrella (which John now knew had hidden capabilities which would have made James Bond proud) tucked under his arm and a look of great irritation on his face.
“How many hours straight have you been working, Watson?” Lestrade asked, reaching out a hand to support John who was listing seriously to one side. John had to think hard, sifting through the muddied waters of his mind to do the math.
"I'm supposed to be dead," the man said. He sounded a little disappointed. "Don't you remember me? Did you miss me?"
"Just..." John needed to vocalize it, breaking the moment or not. He eyed Sherlock closely, putting every ounce of sincerity and honesty into his tone.  "I want no more and no less than what you are comfortable with giving."
"I don't believe you," Sherlock snarled quietly but Myrcoft had had enough and swept from the flat in a huff.
"You bastard," Harry said finally, voice very quiet. She turned on her heel and strode from the flat.
"I'm so sorry," John said after a good, long while. Sherlock's eyes flew open and he stared at John, incredulous.
"I don't see her," Sherlock said, cupping his hands around his face and pressing on the glass. It misted up and he swiped his hand across it, making it smeary and worse. John strained his eyes to see through the rippling glass and finally spotted the bartender, a tall and solidly built man with a bushy beard to match his caterpillar eyebrows. John waved and made a rapid sign with his fingers. Sherlock blinked, then frowned, eyebrows colliding. John knew he was bursting to ask what on earth was going on but holding it back so he could maintain his intelligent persona and try to one up John after all the one upping John was doing. After a moment or two, the bartender stepped outside the pub, the door banging closed behind him, cutting off the brief flood of unintelligible babble that had followed him out.
"Modern Day Criminals – Who They Are and Why They Do It," John read out loud. He squinted at the cover, frowned and then looked back up at Sherlock."Seriously? You do realize this is most probably garbage? And why on earth aren't you looking for information on the internet?"
“Slow down, John, old chap,” Mike placed a hand on John’s shoulder and looked him dead in the eye. “Before you get drunk, tell me what’s going on.”
"You couldn't resist, could you?" John shook his head at Sherlock who was grinning proudly. Rosie took to it at once, Sherlock telling her it was Smaug, the greatest character to ever come out of literature. She tucked it under her arm and cuddled it happily. After Harry had opened her final gift (an apron reading "Kiss the Cook" from Mrs Hudson), John climbed to his feet. Sherlock hadn't got anything from him yet and was clearly trying to hide his disappointment, biting his bottom lip and not quite making eye contact.
John smiled then. Sherlock was looking at him now, his eyes glowing and face flushing properly. There was no more feeling bad. John moved forwards, cupping Sherlock's face and holding his gaze.
"Sherlock!" he cried, delighted. He leaped off his chair and flung his arms around the other man's thin neck, a small tear escaping him.
John was ablaze. Kissing Sherlock was new. Yes, he had done it once before but this was something else. Sherlock was kissing him in a way he'd never known Sherlock could even think, let alone do. John's fingers knotted into Sherlock's hair. He did love those curls. Suddenly they were moving, John needing to move, walking Sherlock backwards to the wall until they could walk no more. There was a pause where they had to break away for air and John found himself staring right into Sherlock's stormy blue eyes.
"Hey, Sherlock?" John called over his shoulder as he walked away from the fire and grabbed his coat and scarf. "I really am going out."
"Funny enough, it didn't come up," John shook his head at Sherlock who continued to look hurt. It wasn't like him and Harry had had in depth conversations about friends and best friends and all! Harry simply looked confused.
"Harry," he said softly, moving forwards, his anger and fury melting away. At the end of the day, no matter how hurt he felt, no matter how mad she made him feel, she was still his sister and it ached in places he didn't know could ache to see her like this. Harry twitched and finally, properly came to, raising a hand to pass it over her face. When she drew her head away from the wall, John had to close his eyes momentarily, cutting off the view, trying to un-see. She had once had a very smooth and pretty face. Now it was marred, a thick, pale scar running from just above her left eyebrow, skating over the top of her eye (thankfully leaving her with her vision) and finishing just as it began to curve over the peak of her cheekbone. There was also fresh bruising, the colours of green, blue and grey blooming on both cheeks and the right side of her jaw. Blood had crusted around her jaw as well and John felt all the air escape his lungs. He opened his eyes, tilting his head to one side a little, perhaps hoping she might look a little better this way. It didn't help, of course, and John just stared. His little sister. His little sister looked broken beyond repair and John didn't know what to do.
John was glad to get off the bus as soon as he could, finally being free of the incessant whinging, the squabbling couple in the back and the surly bus driver who grouched at everyone who didn't pay with a card and made him rummage around in his tin for change. As John exited the bus, he eyed the driver discretely and was struck by the caterpillar-like eyebrows; oversized bushy things which wriggled about grumpily. Nearly giggling, he managed to get off the bus without tripping over the step and set his feet down on the familiar path to the hospital.
"I'm sorry to hear that," Mrs Hudson reached out and embraced Greg around the middle (she was rather short compared to him) and he managed to hug her back while making sure his wine didn't spill.
Sherlock was sitting stock still, lips slightly parted and face a little flushed. John waited for him to say something, anything. Something about personal space and respecting that. But Sherlock said nothing and John felt as though he were drowning in a pool of stupidity. Why would he do that? He didn't think. He acted impulsively and-
"That's in the past now!" Sherlock was suddenly cheerful, baffling Mycroft even further. "Goodbye Mycroft!"
"Sherlock," John said very quietly, taking his hand and running his index finger over Sherlock's thin bones hiding under his nearly translucent skin. "Sherlock, I need you."
"No," Sherlock countered, stopping right in front of the window so he was illuminated by the lights in front of the glass, his back to John. "I spent the entire day in a trance, as you so poetically put it, because I realized who I was in love with."
"I know what I said!" John's voice rose to a shout which propelled him from his chair so he stood, legs shoulder width apart, facing Harry with anger blazing on his face. "I know what I said! Okay? You think I'm proud of that? You think I'm proud of the man I've been to you?"
Harry seemed to struggle internally, shoulders curving in and then squaring. She stood up very straight, very tall (well, as tall as a Watson could) and looked John dead in the eyes but addressed her words to Sherlock. "It's a battle I'll always lose but I'll try."
"You held me," Sherlock spoke in a halting, sort of dreamy tone. "Last night. And then I slept better than I've ever slept in my life."
John worked his jaw, fighting off the urge to tell her how she had behaved. Instead, he stepped forwards and took Harry's hand, tugging it gently towards Rosie. Rosie, eyes wide at this new human being, flung a hand out and grabbed Harry's fingers. John let go and Rosie pulled, making Harry shuffle forwards until she was very close. Rosie gurgled and held Harry's fingers tightly, looking as if she might be examining them. Then she let them go but Harry didn't take her hand away. So John, after a second of deliberating, gave her an awkward hug, trying not to squish Rosie.
"Do come in, Greg," he called, leaning back into his cushion. John didn't bother feeling surprised that Sherlock knew who it was. The door swung open and Greg Lestrade burst in, face flushed from the cold outside and hair full of snow. He seemed breathless, inhaling deeply and pausing by the door frame before entering properly. When he got his breath back, he closed the door and then stuffed his hands deep into his coat pockets, eyeing Sherlock and John.
The tornado of emotion inside Sherlock did not die away even as John was rushed into emergency surgery, even as the doctors said he was safe.
The wide gaping hole in Sherlock's side is just as horrible as John remembers seeing in Afghanistan. He pushes his palm against the wound and lifts Sherlock onto the stretcher they have brought.
John couldn't hold himself upright anymore. He lost his balance which wasn't very steady in the first place, thanks to the alcohol consumption. Sherlock's arms caught him before he crashed to the ground and John relaxed into the steady, inviting heat of his embrace.
"What have you done to my bed?" John repeated. Sherlock folded the paper and placed his hands in his lap.
Perhaps John could use Mike's phone to call Sherlock. John let go of the man, (he had passed out anyway), and he was about to call Sherlock from Mike's phone when he noticed a certain, tall lanky detective with a Belstaff enter the bar.
“It’s the people, right?” Sherlock asked. John still wouldn’t open his eyes, his eyebrows knitted tight on his forehead. He grabbed Sherlock’s coat lapels and bowed his head. Sherlock heard him breath in sharply through his nose. He did this several more times before looking up at Sherlock, and nodded.
Forster is talking to Sherlock in a low voice and Sherlock grows paler by the second. John can't hear him over Billy's stupid rasp. He throws him an annoyed glance and tries to say, "Shut the fuck up you stupid pumpkin," But it comes out as garbled nonsense.
[04/10, 6:20 pm] YOU: If you agree to that, Sarah can take Rosie away. But remember that if you send Sarah, you are not welcome at Baker Street anymore. -SH
“It’s your fault.” He swallowed hard. He distanced himself from Sherlock, but Sherlock kept his hands on his shoulders. Sherlock looked at John’s face but John only stared back, his face devoid empty. His eyes started to water. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. John ripped himself free from Sherlock’s grip.
As the movie played away Sherlock felt himself getting drowsy. He began slumping more and more down in his seat. When John took the last of the popcorn Sherlock placed the bowl on the floor and stretched out on his side as much as he could without bumping into John. He laid his head on the armrest and closed his eyes, trying to block out the sounds of the movie. John found the blanket and laid it over him, tucking it under his feet and around his back. Sherlock hummed a thank you and snuggled into the couch trying to get comfortable. He shifted around for a minute, trying to get comfortable before giving up.
"John, is anything wrong?" Sherlock asked, carefully placing a hand on John's arm. John swallowed hard and shut his eyes. Sherlock brought up his other hand, holding John near him. He studied his face, looking for signs of an anxiety attack.
Sarah grunted and sat up, probably feeling the lack of warmth. She blinked at John, her expression confused but as she looked him up and down, realization dawned in her eyes.
This chapter will be from the perspective of both Sherlock and John. Page breaks and markers will be added to avoid head hopping.
He fishes out a large napkin and blocks John's nose until John is forced to open his mouth for air. He stuffs the napkin in his mouth and pats his cheek, "Good boy," he whispers and grins. "While Mr Forster gets rid of your boyfriend here, you'll need some practice opening your mouth wide, right? We wouldn't want to make you suck dick without prepping you first." He says under his breath.
“For seeing to Mr. Charles at Campton Grange,” he said. “My cousin Alfie is ever so grateful that you looked after his young master. Everyone is very fond of Mr. Charles and wishes he were out of his trouble.”
“Perhaps he is in love,” I said, watching the last log split and send a shower of sparks up the flue. “The object may seem to us unworthy, but who can peer into a boy’s soul? Or a man’s?”
He leaned close to me. “Will you look after my cat? She’s shut up in my room. If I’m put away, Moggy’s sure to starve to death.”
Then that woman came into our lives. And I say ‘our’ because her insidious presence affected both of us, especially when I became aware that she and Holmes were... physically intimate.
At ten o’clock James helped me to bed, leaving two glasses of Mycroft’s best whiskey with soda on the bed-stand. “For later,” he said, with a cheeky grin.
“John! Don’t run from me!” he shouted. “That has ever been my fear – that you would flee from me. That my emotions, once stripped bare, would be loathsome to you. That I would be loathsome to you.”
“Lestrade is still crowing over his catch,” commented Holmes. “He’s afraid his pigeons will fly if they get too close to a window.”
Minutes later Holmes and I were standing on the pavement, the grim walls of the prison looming behind us.
But this great house and these deferential servants delineated a Sherlock Holmes I did not know: a spoiled aristocrat, even an autocrat, used to ordering and demanding, a gentleman to the manor born, rather than a gentleman of his own making, as was I.
I still wasn’t certain what it was these gentlemen, or the Prussian soldier for that matter, wanted to do to me. Put their pricks up my bumhole? That’s what Lady Percy said, and if that was sodomy, then I had to bow to her superior knowledge.
“Then it’s settled!” Holmes happily puffed up like a prize pigeon. “I’ll fetch you and your gear tomorrow at twelve!”
I ate my breakfast and was reviewing the morning papers, wondering how long Holmes and James would be gone, when the girl announced that I had a visitor. To my surprise it was Stamford.
“But they got most of them,” James added. “I had a note from Mick – he says all of Scotland Yard is in a tizzy over this affair!”
The Irishman crossed the room and poured himself a glass of claret from a crystal decanter. “I would offer you a glass, Johnny Lad, but I doubt you’d accept a drink from me.”
“He’s a heroin addict,” Fred replied flatly. Which seemed an odd thing to say seeing that the entire place was filled with addicts of one sort or another. And seeing that I was also there for addiction to hard narcotics. “And a very recalcitrant one to boot. He’s crafty and sly and thinks he’s better than anyone else here because...” Fred stopped. “But that’s no matter. He’s a bad influence. I wouldn’t have put you in with him except we are very full right now and the alternative was to put a younger and more impressionable patient in there.” Fred curled his lip. “Sherlock talks a good game, but he’s a failure, John. He’s been in rehab multiple times before and always backslid. He’s in now because the alternative was prison.”
“There is nothing finer than a delightful evening at home,” Stamford pronounced, leaning back and patting his stomach. “The domestic comforts are the best, my dear, even if they tend to expand the waistline. You should have seen poor Watson when he returned from India. He was gaunt as a hermit and brown as a walnut. I hardly knew him for the handsome, dashing young rake I knew at St. Bart’s.”
“Buck up, my boy! I’ve had worse – and so have you.” He reached out his hand and touched the fresh mark on my forehead. I had removed the plaster that morning and it was a mere trifling cut, halfway to being healed. “We will both carry scars from the Moriarty Wars.”
“Here, now!” said Constable Clark with a frown. “None of that stuff! This is a respectable hospital!”
I closed my eyes and threw it forcefully into the fireplace, where it smashed into sharp white and blue fragments.
“You will feel much better now, Doctor, sir,” said Ivan, wiping me off as he would a helpless babe. “Is good thing for man to spend. Good for body, good for head. You are sad – I feel this. Maybe you and friend have fight, now not so friendly. But you will be happy again. I know this.” He covered me with the Turkish towel. “Close eyes. Rest now.”
“But you cannot keep this incident a secret,” Holmes observed. “This is not a momentary fancy by a foolish boy. This is serious business! My friend Watson’s business is to heal your son’s wounds, but my business is to get to the bottom of enigmas. Which is why I must ask the obvious question – why would your son want to hang himself?”
“Aye, there’s the rub,” said Holmes, grinning slyly. “We are going to Cleveland Street, my dear fellow, to the most notorious boy brothel in London!”
Holmes and I stood, gaping, at the sight of Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard and one of his lackeys, Constable Clark, standing next to a bloody figure lying supine on the filthy floor.
Mick looked abashed. “I’ve known Dilly since we was kids on the street. She was a tiny thing and couldn’t defend herself, so I protected her and saw she got fed and had a safe place to sleep. You look out for each other when you’re living rough, know what I mean? She was one of the Irregulars for a while. Don’t you remember, Guv?”
And now I was going to reclose that newly opened heart. I was going to leave him in the night without an explanation. And without another word from me for the rest of my life.
I said the words, but I wasn’t sure I believed them. Holmes said he knew who had done the crime, but the culprits were not in hand. And if the Irishman was truly involved, that complicated the matter even more.
The butler directed the two footmen to take our bags and we followed him up the narrow staircase and into a newer section of the house.
“Mick’s innocent,” James asserted. “You know it and Mr. Holmes knows it. Mick says the Guv – that’s what he calls Mr. Sherlock – will set them free. Mick says he’s solved many crimes and always gets the true criminal.”
May became June and with June the summer sun beat down most pleasantly. Holmes and I took companionable walks in the garden and we even attempted a short ride in the carriage, although the bouncing made me wince.
“Just as well,” he said, easing back on the bolster. “I thought Young Hopkins would never leave. He ever was a talker, even as a small boy.”
“Please, Holmes,” I pleaded. “As my friend, I beg you – let us quit this place! I cannot stay here another moment!”
After my first year of medical studies ended, the Irishman and I traveled to Ireland. It was my first visit to his homeland, which was also the land of my mother’s family. We stayed with an elderly relative in a crumbling mansion in Clare. It was beautiful, but desolate. I spent my days riding or walking across the treeless terrain, while the endless wind howled at night even at the height of summer.
I retreated to my room, to my bed, waiting and brooding long hours until the afternoon turned into evening.
I left Mrs. Hudson to deal with the cat, while I sped up the stairs, unable to imagine who was waiting in the sitting room.
“You give the poor beast no credit, Watson,” Holmes yawned. “Pack his valise – and yours! We leave early in the morning and will be there in time for supper, unless the roads are bad.” He frowned and glanced out the window. Holmes’ practical and theoretical knowledge is extensive, but weather prognostication is not one of the areas of his expertise. “It’s fair today, so I assume it will be fair tomorrow. Bright and sunny as any April day could be! Perfect for traveling.”
“No, my dear lady. I’m going away. Going... abroad. And I probably won’t be returning for a long while.” Or ever, I should have added, but I could not. The poor woman had long suffered her two odd lodgers – and now she was being left with the odder one to deal with alone.
The woman I listened to for the better part of an hour and then gave her a mild sedative draught. She is newly married and seems to have no one to talk to. I suggested that she talk to her husband about her apprehensions, which seemed a revelation to her. I believe she left more at ease.
“It’s not Christian!” she exclaimed. “I will make certain those boys have a good meal every day. I’ll have James carry it over to them. That way he’ll be of some use while he’s here.” She paused and cocked her head. “Is he going to be here long?”
By a circuitous route we wended our way through the dingy hallways of the facility like a pair of schoolboys evading the headmaster. Holmes pushed open a steel door and we were outside. If this was indeed the garden, it more than lived up to his characterization of it as a dirt pile. In the corner two sagging potted palms sat forlornly.
“And...” Holmes gave a tug to Gladstone’s lead and the beast jumped from the carriage with a grunt. “This is our dog, Mrs. Jenkins. See that he’s fed and looked after.”
“Likely story,” she retorted. “Found a sugar daddy, have you? Watch out for that one. He looks right barmy.”
After Final Affirmations the nurses passed out snacks. I took a packet of biscuits, but they were stale. I was going to toss them into the bin, but Arthur took them.
We were in Paris when a man came to see the Irishman. He was a small, plain man, but he had a hard face and a blunt manner. I knew him to be one of the Irishman’s upper servants, left in charge of his empire in London while we meandered around Europe, spending money. They were closeted together for hours in our suite, while I went out and sat in one of the cafés, watching the world go by and flirting with whomever passed, both male and female. And they flirted back. I was beautiful and I knew it, so why not enjoy it? But I never acted on any of the many invitations I received. To do so would have been the end of me.
“Rubbish!” he uttered. “You are speaking nonsense. I am a consummate judge of character and I long ago I decided you are the most desirable of companions, for your bravery and for all of the manly virtues I hold in high esteem. So don’t tell me that I don’t know you. I have said before that I know everything I need to know about you. I have already selected you out of all other fellows as my perfect associate and partner. I wouldn’t have lived with you all these years and shared my professional secrets with you if I didn’t trust you with my very life. What more could any man ask for?”
“Come, caro mio,” the Irishman whispered, pulling me by the hand. “We need privacy. Our room is exactly the way it was. No other man has polluted it since you left. I always knew you would return, Johnny. I knew it.”
I was also reading through the Irishman’s library, finding myself drawn to the medical texts more and more. I began to think about my future. I had to think about the future, for my present was so lost and so lonely that the prospect of the future was all I had to keep me waking up in the morning.
A stranger walking into the room and seeing us would think it a mundane sight – two old friends drinking together, sharing a fine claret. But things are not always as they seem.
I rolled over onto my back. Ivan’s strong fingers flexed my legs, focusing especially on my right, with its damaged tendo Achillis. I flinched slightly, but then relaxed. A firm rub after heat always helped and Ivan knew the exact amount of pressure that was needed. I sighed at the remedy it brought, and my entire being was flooded with a tranquility I had not felt in an age.
“You didn’t know because you have never asked!” I retorted. “In all the years we have been together, you have never asked me a single question about my past, my family, my education, or my religious upbringing! Doesn’t that strike you as odd?”
Then Gladstone made a noise that is much like a sneeze, but which signaled a function considerably more unpleasant to other parties sharing his space.
“No,” said Lestrade. “If you must know, we were tipped off. An informant sent us word that a murder was about to be carried out. Unfortunately, by the time we arrived it was too late to stop the grievous offense. Mr. Fisher had already met his sad demise.”
I paused on the pavement. “I don’t think I could swallow even a single bite. Let us return home. A good night’s sleep is the remedy that would suit me most.”
“That’s impossible!” I stated. I had learned enough mathematics from the Jesuits to knew that what the Irishman was claiming was beyond the scope of the mind of a mere mortal. Or most mortals. “Even a prodigy would not be able to perform in such a manner!”
“It was created to look like a ruin,” said Holmes, tapping his pipe against it. “‘Nor mourn the unalterable Days, That Genius goes and Folly stays.’”
“But how do you know, Holmes?” I asked. The buildings in these dark streets had no numbers to distinguish them.
“We shall endeavour to be on our best behavior, I assure you,” said Holmes. “Mr. Griffith said that we might find ... er...  a special kind of entertainment meant for discerning gentlemen. We are willing to pay if such entertainment is offered. I believe it is called ‘poses plastiques.’”
The burly Russian shrugged. Then his hand was on my prick. “Friend not here, Doctor, sir. But Ivan can take care of you. Ivan take care of many gentleman who come without friend. Ivan the best here. Ask Mr. Ozmet. He will tell you.”
Finally, I returned to out hotel. The plain little man was gone and the Irishman was not in a happy mood.
My heart began to beat too fast. I wasn’t certain that the meaning behind the words Holmes was speaking was the same meaning that had been inside me for so long. No, they could not be!
That night the Irishman didn’t sleep, but paced back and forth on the carpet, his hands behind his back, thinking.
“It’s nothing,” I said, brushing off her praise. “A few trifles I offer to the public from my imagination.”
“Doctor,” whispered Dilly, clutching my hand. “Will you and Mr. Holmes take care of Mick for me? He’s a good sort, even if he’s a little wild.”
“You are the very devil!” Holmes exclaimed. “A worse nanny than Mrs. Hudson when you put your mind to it!”
“This must be Act Two,” Holmes remarked, standing up. “But now we must find our contact and proceed to the next phase of the evening.”
Having lost my innocence at 17 in a house of ill fame in Amsterdam, I set about discovering what else in life I had been missing.
“Go away, John!” he hissed. “How dare you approach me? You have disgraced our family name! Don’t you know that everyone is speaking of you and your... your degenerate companion?” He glared at the Irishman, who stood calm and dangerously silent. “You are not fit for decent society!”
To the mother and child I prescribed a regimen of warm rooms and mild steam along with a tincture of eucalyptus for the child to breathe in at night. The boy was basically healthy, but I warned the mother that if the congestion continued beyond the spring, that a change of climate might be in order. I also suggested more fruit and fresh green vegetables in his diet. She frowned, but said that she would follow my advice. I told her to bring the lad back in a month to gauge his progress.
The words pierced the cloud in my brain. But with consciousness also came pain. And awareness of my dire plight.
“The master picked this out himself,” she cackled, showing a row of broken teeth. “Said it matched your pretty eyes!”
My old St. Bart’s dresser, Stamford, the very fellow who introduced me to Holmes, invited me to dinner. He’s lately married and, as all newlyweds are wont, he and his bride are determined that everyone they know should also be married. To that end they invited me to dine with them in their new house in Chelsea – a house apparently paid for by the in-laws, who have also set Stamford up in practice.
“Then let us scamper up to your undoubtedly unworthy lodgings and remedy the situation,” he said, taking my hand. “And afterwards I have a proposition for you. Is that satisfactory?”
“I thought you were eager to get on with your investigation?” I prompted as I watched him sprawl upon the divan, letter opener in hand.
Mick winced at the word – as did I. It was difficult to think of Mick Wiggins as a whore, even if that’s what he was.
“We were just leaving, Major,” said Holmes. “Come, Watson. I think we have what we need.” And he sauntered out of the room.
The Irish Sea was grey even under a sunny midsummer sky. The steamship, the Irish Princess, was also grey. But it looked substantial, as if it could cross the Atlantic with no great difficulty.
“Good Lord, Holmes!” I exclaimed. “You think I will let you run about the streets of London with that thing in your waistband? Is it loaded?”
The lad was crying in my arms. I stroked his soft hair, attempting to soothe him. “I say that you should have a little more compassion, Holmes. The boy is distraught! And youth often does foolish things in the name of love.”
I leaned my head against the window frame and closed my eyes. In Peshawur one of the Anglo-Indian orderlies in the convalescent ward had taught me a method of relaxation. One concentrated on a single sound and focused the mind on that continuing tone, blocking out the world and moving into a state of peaceful harmony with the universe. At least that is what the orderly told me. I found the technique quelled anxiety and often eased my pain enough that I was able to eschew the narcotics with which the doctors dosed me. Now it helped me to move into another state of mind, another place. I thought of Baker Street – of sitting contentedly in my chair by the fire, Gladstone snoring on the rug, Holmes playing the violin. This would be my solace – memory. That was one thing the Irishman would never be able to take from me – my memories.
“Right then,” he said. “Good-night, Doctor. And good-night to you, too, Mr. Sherlock. By the way – I dusted the secret passageway. If you’re going to be using it regularly you wouldn’t want it full of cobwebs, would you, sir?”
“My brother is only waiting for summer so he can run off and join the Army,” said James. “And my mum – she’ll understand. I’ll write to her and tell her I have a good position with His Lordship’s brother and his friend. Then she won’t worry.”
“Doctor!” Now it was James calling. He ran up, pulling Gladstone along on the lead. “It’s time we were getting back. You need your rest.”
“They were released over a week ago, once Lestrade finally believed that they had been framed for the murder of Fisher,” Holmes informed me. “Unfortunately, Dilly is... not well.”
Holmes took out his pipe and lit it, as he always does when peeved. “Is there a way to mitigate this situation, Collins? A bribe, perhaps, to get poor Mitchell some decent care?”
“If you will leave us alone, Mrs. Griffith,” I said, seeing her to the door. “I will examine your son.”
“I thought you gentlemen might need some assistance when you got back from your night out,” James retorted. “Brushing off your capes and toppers and such. Sit here, Doctor, and I’ll get a towel to bathe your head.”
“How did you get here?” Holmes demanded. Frustration was etched on his face. He hated being bested at his own game, but he especially could not stomach being bested by the weaselly Inspector Lestrade. “Did someone hear the crime being committed and summon the police?”
“Thommie?” I was stunned. “That... boy we picked up at the pub? He is one of your spies? And Mick and Dilly, too?”
“Oh, a night out will be so nice for you, Doctor! I’ll have the girl bring the tray up directly,” she said.
“His mind? Bah!” The Irishman growled the words. “His intellect? Sherlock Holmes is a mere insect compared to me! I will crush him under my boot heel!”
“Not much,” he said casually. “Only that you are a medical doctor, trained as a surgeon. You were born in London, raised a Roman Catholic, and educated in Jesuit schools. You studied on the Continent as well, either in Germany or Austria, perhaps as part of your medical training. You joined the Army and were sent to Afghanistan where you were injured by a roadside bomb over a year ago. You sustained shrapnel wounds to both your left side and right leg that were not life-threatening, but bad enough to end your career as an Army surgeon. Your injuries left you in excruciating pain, which you numbed with narcotics you prescribed to yourself. You have hindered movement to your leg and your left arm and hand, which, along with your addiction, has rendered your very future as a physician in doubt. Your family is either dead or abroad and you have never been married...” He paused and gazed up at the ceiling thoughtfully. “...because you are a homosexual, which you generally kept to yourself during your Army service. You are currently unattached. Oh, and you are here as a voluntary patient. Unlike yours truly, who is here under lock and key, thanks to my dear brother, the esteemed Mycroft.”
“Mr. Holmes,” the warder, Mr. Collins, greeted my friend. “Back again so soon? You must like it here.” He was a whip-spare man with a gallows sense of humor, if that is not inappropriate to say in such a circumstance. “Perhaps you and the good doctor would like to move in – permanently?”
“Yes, Mrs. Jenkins. Business takes us back to London,” I said. “But I hope we will return for a longer stay, perhaps this summer.”
Holmes opened it and as he read his face turned somber. “Watson, may I have a piece of your scratch paper?” I had my writing paper by my side, as always, and I handed him a sheet and a pencil. He scribbled something in his crabbed scrawl and offered it to James. “Send this wire immediately. After you leave the Telegraph Office, you may meet us at St. Bart’s. The doctor and I must go there without delay.”
It was the painting of my mother, Marianne Healy Watson, that once stood in my father’s study and which I had last seen in my brother’s house many years before.
But in staying at that bleak place I saw what drove the Irishman – his had been a grand family once, but little was left. The Irishman had his great mind and that was his legacy. But I also heard stories from the servants there, dark whisperings of insanity and betrayal and even murder, for there was a forbidding streak running through the family. The Irishman, apparently, came by his moodiness and villainy naturally, in his blood.
“Of course not!” he retorted, opening his dark hazel eyes and gazing at me. “You know I eschew opiates in that crude form. This is an herb that is medicinal and utterly harmless. It has a tranquilizing effect not unlike kif. A former client sent it to me from Mexico, where it grows quite wild. Would you like to try some?” He offered me the mouthpiece.
I went and stood next to him. I took the decanter and helped myself to a glass. “You should never drink alone. It’s the first sign of the long slide to becoming a true drunkard.”
“It isn’t the secrecy, Watson,” said Holmes. “It’s the idea that a certain order is maintained, even if that order is a complete fiction. We pretend that I am sleeping in my own bed and the servants pretend that I am sleeping in my own bed. Hence, in the eyes of the world I am certainly sleeping in my own bed. Without such fictions a moral society could not function.”
His cheery smile faded. “’Cause it is grave, Doctor. Can’t do anything but make a joke of it. But the last laugh’ll be on me and Dilly. They got us dead to rights, Guv’nor. We was in the room with the stiff when the coppers come in and me with blood all over me hands.” The boy stretched out his fingers and inspected them. “Dead to rights. And dead for certain soon enough.” That’s when his composure crumbled utterly and he began to sob like a child.
“Respect for society?” he scoffed. “What is society but a stew of hypocrisy?” The Irishman smiled at me. “Were the men you gambled with moral? Were the boys you caroused with respectful and full of good will? And what about yourself, Johnny Lad? Who are you to lecture me on the wages of sin? A young pup who is as green as the grass. A boy who believes that dressing in silk waistcoats and sleeping with dim-witted females is the be-all and end-all of life’s purpose. You should have stayed safe in your seminary. At least there you would have had a purpose and a belief, however wrongheaded it may be. Now what do you have? Nothing at all. You don’t even have a friend you could go to when you were in despair. Not even your own brother cares a groat whether you live or die. If those ruffians who threatened you yesterday had slit your throat, would a single person on this earth have truly mourned you? Tell me the truth.”
I stared at the man. “You have the gall to leave me hanging with so many mysteries unexplained? For instance, the title. Mycroft is your older brother. Is he the Earl of Sherringford or is there some other relative that might spring out of a secret door and leap into my bed?”
“Give that to me!” I exclaimed, taking it out of his trousers and into my own hand. “If you believe I will let you plunge into darkest Soho by yourself with only this infernal thing for protection, then more fool you!”
“He loved the natural world and made it his chief study,” said Holmes, puffing thoughtfully. “He was also a talented artist, as were all those in the Vernet family. He took his degree from Cambridge at 17 and immediately began to travel, searching out strange flora and fauna and drawing them. That’s how he found the woman who became my mother. She was also an artist and a naturalist.”
“Don’t be coy, John!” she chastised. “Have you not taken money from Lord Brigham and that loathsome Arthur Spencer? Do you not know they are the most notorious pair who have ever been banished from England and forced to take refuge in Italy, where buggery is not simply tolerated, but practically a requirement?”
I nodded. “Sherringford Hall is down this way. I visited there recently for the first time. A gloomy old pile, don’t you think?”
I found myself on the Strand and then in Trafalgar, then turned up St. Martin’s Lane until I stood before the Salisbury, the public house I had gone to with Mick.
I knew the artist immediately. And I knew the unhappy subject, a young man portrayed in lewd and languid poses and attitudes I will not describe, done by the same man who had painted the portraits at the Irishman’s gallery. For they had been created for the Irishman. For his enjoyment.
“There it is,” said Holmes, surveying my new room with satisfaction. “Snug as a bug. I know you’ll be comfortable here, my dear fellow.”
Holmes nodded as he lit and drew on his pipe. The smoke rose in the hot room, swirling to the ceiling. “Tell me something. Because I need to know the answer. Did you... love him?”
The monkey stared at the chessboard for a moment, shrieked, and then turned over the board, scattering the pieces.
I thought of walking over to Pall Mall and the Diogenes Club, but I knew I would not be admitted. And, I considered, I might be followed. I looked around, suddenly thinking that the Irishman’s minions were watching me at every turn.
“Elementary deduction,” he shrugged. “I only know a little about you, Watson, but when I’ve observed you longer I undoubtedly will be able to tell more.”
When I returned to Baker Street early the next morning I was not proud of myself. In fact, I felt mortification about what I had done – giving in to my baser instincts. But that seemed to be my fate – I meant well, but the result was always disaster. As I climbed the front steps at 221b, I could not help but wonder if going off with the Irishman would be another of these disasters. But it was too late to renege on my obligation, and in any event the Irishman would not permit me to nullify my promise.
“Did Holmes or Mycroft ever show an affinity for drawing?” It seemed curious that neither of them had inherited the talent, with such a strong inclination on both sides.
“France,” said Holmes. “The Exposition is in progress in Paris. Have you read about Eiffel’s Tower? It’s said to be an architectural wonder.”
Charles Griffith’s face was pale and drawn, but he seemed composed – until he beheld Dilly lying in the narrow hospital bed.
“Too bad you never had any of your own,” James mused. “Of course, I can’t see Mr. Sherlock – or His Lordship, for that matter – having children. I mean, Mr. Mycroft, of course.”
“I was knocked down by the force of the blast from your air-gun,” I said, exaggerating just a little. “And just avoided being its victim in a worse way.”
“I’m sorry but I must take my leave. I... I am not feeling too well.” I called for my hat and coat. “Please give my regards to your dear wife and to Miss Morstan.”
“Rudimentary, dear boy,” answered Holmes. “Henry Sherringford-Holmes was his lover. You know your history, man! King James was infamous for lusting after beautiful young noblemen and then showering them with titles and gifts of land and jewels. Henry was young, noble, and beautiful – if his portrait in the drawing room is accurate, which I assume it is – and, apparently, not averse to the king’s attentions. The result is this house and the continued fortune of the Sherringford-Holmes family. Oh, and the title, as well.”
“It sounds like a lonely life.” I could not help but think of my own forlorn hours at school, my mother dead and my father and brother little concerned about my welfare or happiness.
“No!” breathed Alfie. “Not the authorities! That would certainly be the worst thing possible! Then it would surely be made public and Mr. Charles and the family would never hold their heads up in society again!”
“If I am to live here with you... what am I to pay as my share?” I posed the obvious question. “Because I doubt I can afford it.”
I stopped before the door and turned to face him. “But that was my own fear. That if you knew what had so long been in my heart, it would disgust you. If you knew what... what I had done in the past, what acts I had performed that society deems beyond the very pale... I could not allow you to know that!”
“And the other boy is ill, Mr. Holmes says,” Mrs. Hudson stated with concern. “Surely they wouldn’t keep a sickly child in such a place?”
“It was long ago,” I repeated, well aware that I was no longer the young man portrayed in the Irishman’s treasures.
“I sailed around the Cape on my way to India,” I said with a laugh. “Some days I was so ill I thought I’d die. But I lived. And then the long journey home, the same thing. And we were at sea for weeks. You’ll be in New York in ten days.”
“Certainly, my dear boy.” He eased off as we came into lower Baker Street. “It’s only the old family pile. Sherringford Hall. But you might find it amusing.”
Gladstone and I walked up Baker Street, heading north. We are evenly matched, Gladstone and I. His legs are short but doughty, while mine are long, but mismatched. Especially in this wet weather the pain in my right limb is often acute, hence the necessity of the cane. Nevertheless we proceeded at a brisk pace up the pavement, crossing the Marylebone Road and entering Regent’s Park at the Clarence Gate.
And he was still. Or at least as still as Holmes ever can be when he is not unconscious. The wound looked raw, but I saw no obvious sign of infection, thank heaven, so I went about my work.
Two ageing bachelors, living in degraded rooms with a flatulent bulldog, as we progressed towards senility.
“I did!” Mick whined. Then he turned to me, his dark eyes tearful. “Don’t let him browbeat me, Doctor. I’m telling you everything!”
“Don’t fret, sir,” said the lad. “I like that gentlemen find me agreeable.” Thommie brushed past Holmes and moved close to me. I could smell the odor of sweat and semen, a sweet and heady mixture, on him. “Because I’m ever so agreeable. If you’re of a mind, I’m free for the rest of the evening.”
I did not see him again until years later, just before I left for India, and then once again when I returned from the East, a man broken in body and spirit.
The son and daughter-in-law had a considerable laugh at that, but Mrs. Barker scowled fiercely at me and even more fiercely at Holmes.
“We are gathering information,” he replied testily. “If you do not wish to take part in the investigation, say so at once and I shall tell the cab driver to pull over so you may get out.”
“Nonsense, my boy!” She pressed it into my hand. “You would not begrudge an old woman her will, would you?”
“Pray do not bar Miss Morstan from the house again, James,” I commanded. “And I’ll make sure that Holmes doesn’t destroy her future correspondence.”
I could almost hear Mrs. Hudson counting to ten. But then she smiled sweetly and said, “I’ll bring up your tea directly, gentlemen.”
The Irishman leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “Did you bring your gun? Do you plan to shoot me?”
After hastening away from Italy, I spent the next few months touring the continent. I visited Greece, taking in Athens and Delphi, as well as a few of the scenic isles, until I landed in Alexandria. There I found another English colony that gladly gave shelter to a young wanderer. I connected myself to the family of an attaché at Her Majesty’s embassy. The ladies of the family were preparing to travel alone through North Africa, via Tripoli and Morocco, and on to Gibraltar and the gentleman’s next appointment.
But while the Fathers had warned me about the Daughters of Eve and their ensnaring temptations, there was one aspect of carnal knowledge that they had neglected to warn me about. For it was not only ladies who found me appealing.
Now I am not by nature an untruthful man. Mendacity and falsehood are against my better nature. I no longer follow the religion of my youth, in which I was raised and trained from earliest childhood, nor do I follow any particular creed or belief, although, unlike my skeptical friend Holmes, I do not look down upon those who need the support of the supernatural over the logical in order to arrange their lives. However, I pride myself in following a strict moral and ethical code of my own making, one that has served me both as a soldier and a physician, as well as a subject of Her Majesty and a citizen of her Greater Empire. Much of that code involves honour. And honour assumes honesty.
My head began to spin – the room itself began to spin. Indeed, the entire world was spinning around me, out of control.
Over the bed was a framed print by Goya, ‘The Sleep of Reason Engenders Monsters.’ I had always thought it a strange choice as a guardian of one’s repose – the sleeper, his head bowed, besieged by creatures of nightmare, their eyes lit by an infernal fire. I would not want to see that image every night, especially not when I was already beset by troubling dreams.
“Good evening, Mrs. H.,” said Holmes. “Lovely weather, what? Here is a present for you. Watson, give her the box.”
“Love letters are often the means by which a besotted man is caught by his own foolish sentiments,” I lectured. “He pours out his heart to an unworthy female, who then uses his tender feelings against him. I can see why an impressionable young gentleman like Charles Griffith should feel his whole world had ended with the revelation of a thwarted love.”
I bumbled out of Stamford’s house like a damned fool. I do not know what came over me, but I had to get out of there.
“Mr. Holmes often stays out all night, especially when he is on a case,” I replied, picking up the morning ‘Times’ and unfolding it.
“Yes, that would be lovely,” I replied. “But what I was going to say is... do you think we might return to London soon?”
“That is more than satisfactory, my good fellow,” said Holmes. His fingers dug into my arm in excitement. “Now we are getting somewhere,” he whispered to me.
His lips rested against my neck, intimately, caressingly. “He came to my bed one night and began his cajoling words. And I... I was starving for affection. Starving for something I had never experienced.”
I had not walked halfway down the Esquiline Hill when I became aware that a carriage was following me. I lengthened my stride, but the carriage kept apace, slowing and speeding up to match me. I was apprehensive, but also full of champagne courage, so I stopped and challenged my pursuer. “If you want something of me, make yourself known!”
“You need it no longer,” I asserted. “I will help you! I have always tried to help you, but you would never listen.”
“This is not to be tolerated!” Lestrade barked. “These are my prisoners, Mr. Holmes. We are only waiting for the conveyance to take them away. You have no right to question them!”
“Grease?” said Holmes. “Nonsense! These are far from greasy. And they are your favorite kind, sage and onion.”
“So, Barton,” I said to the valet as we propped up Young Griffith with extra pillows. “Am I correct in surmising that you are the cousin of the footmen at Sherringford, James and Henry?”
I swallowed. It was difficult to be tutored in the truth by a man I judged to be without scruples or mercy. “I sometimes won. On days when I felt luck was with me.”
“The doctor from the village took the bullet out,” said James. “He said it went through your heavy overcoat and your tweed jacket and your shirt and by the time it got to your chest, your rib bone hindered it from doing further damage.”

“He doesn’t seem to be in any present danger,” I said. “But his throat may well be damaged. And he can’t speak, so it is possible his larynx was seriously injured. He will need to see a specialist about that. It may mean an operation.”
"I'm not panicking," Sherlock said immediately, looking back to his laptop screen to illustrate his image of 'not panicking'. However, John could see his eyes flicking to the side, checking his peripheral vision to make sure John was still there. "Why would I be panicking?"
Sherlock had been 'researching' for hours, though John had since become convinced that he'd discovered the dangerous world of Tumblr and cat memes or something because surely one couldn't research one human being for that long.Besides, John didn't think that this Moriarty imposter deserved quiet giggling and frequent deep inhalations of excitement. To occupy himself, John played with Rosie while she was awake and cleaned up while she was sleeping. He washed all of Sherlock's empty test tubes (ignoring the ones in use because he really didn't want to know what sort of human materials blended with chemicals would be floating around in there), filed away his papers in alphabetical order, scrubbed the sooty bottoms of seven beakers, installed a new rubber tube on Sherlock's favourite Bunsen burner (the old one had perished and was moments away from become a gas hazard and blowing up), fished the air tight bag of index fingers from the fridge and put them into a small chilly bin by the door where he had taken to firing any parts of the human body found in eating areas and finally swept the floor. Sherlock had once teased John about his inability to cope with a messy flat. John put it down to his time in the military when they had to keep their barracks clean or face the wrath of their commanders. Sherlock put it down to having lived with a wife for a while, though John knew Mary hadn't been 100% dedicated to keeping the house immaculate. She was too busy being...well...Mary.
The following morning saw John rise early. Rosie had woken up crying so he bundled her up in his arms and took her downstairs where they sat by the fire and John quietly began reciting his favourite childhood story about a quest to reclaim a mountain from a fire breathing dragon. Rosie loved it, right up until he got to the bit where everyone might get eaten by trolls. She had a look of serious concern in her eyes and John had to reassure her that it wasn't real.It was just a story. She was smart, he thought fondly. She wasn't a proper baby anymore; she was verging on crawling and then they'd be in trouble! Rosie chewed her finger thoughtfully and John kissed her forehead.
"Better?" John turned back to Sherlock who was now gulping down a glass of water. Once he'd drained it, he put the glass in the sink and dabbed his mouth.
"Hi Sherlock," John smiled, trying to play down the fact they'd just slept together with not all of the participants knowing about it.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, his gaze on the snowy ground. Then he looked up and even from the sideways profile John had of him, he could see Sherlock was absolutely wild. And...terribly sad. "I made me like this because that's who you were. I idolized you, even though I hated you. You knew how to deal with what we are, you were detached so I had to become detached to be like you, to cope!"
"Mycroft," Sherlock said in surprise, stepping away from the door a little so that all those sitting at the table could see the impeccably dressed elder Holmes brother. "What're you doing here?"
"I'm telling you, you won't need it," Greg assured him, so John, curiosity fully piqued, put his notepad and pen to one side, giving Greg his undivided attention. Sherlock was gazing at Greg, eyes scanning him and seeing everything that Sherlock saw. Stains on shirts, creases in strange places, out of place hairs...
John moved, using the last reserves of his strength to swing his leg backwards and into the man's groin. He released John with a high pitched scream and Sherlock's gun fired, the bullet sailing over John's shoulder as he dropped to the ground and lodging itself into the man's skull.
"I'm sorry too," he told her. When they parted, Harry was biting her lip. Then she raised her hand and stared at the fingers Rosie had grabbed.
And he had. He had always looked sad. Despite the fact that Sherlock had said he was married to his work and didn't require affection and love, he was only human. He needed love in whatever form it came. That was something John found inherently beautiful about human beings; they all needed love, even if they didn't think it. And so, someone without love like Sherlock looked sad because he was missing something that all humans needed. But now, now he looked happy. Properly happy. John wondered what Molly would think. He knew Molly loved Sherlock. But she had done what many, many people couldn't do. She had set him free. That's how the saying went, wasn't it?
Mrs Hudson put her hands on her hips and gave him a severe look. "When exactly were you going to tell me?"
“I used to be so afraid of showing emotions, John,” Sherlock told him. “Scared they would affect my mental acuity and my ability to decipher a situation. But I’ve come to realize that these emotions, especially love which I was most afraid of, are what make us human, what make us infinitely more alive. And John, I’m alive. And I love you. I’m not afraid anymore.”
"Sherlock?" John watched as Sherlock closed his book with a snap and put it aside, already looking intently at him.
"She knows," he explained. Sherlock frowned, shrugging to illustrate his continued bafflement. John rolled his eyes. "About us? She knows."
“What about him?” Sherlock continued painting, sleeves rolled up and the veins on his arms standing out which distracted John just a tiny bit.
Mycroft didn't say anything, working his mouth uncomfortably. He looked like the words he wanted to say were poisonous, would pain him to speak. When he finally opened his mouth, he sounded oddly tight; trying to maintain his normal tone of voice but a little higher. "Is it wrong to spend Christmas with family?"
John grabbed an apple from the bottom shelf, briefly wondering if the hands would have tainted the fruit and closed the fridge door with a snap. He shook his head, somewhat despairingly, and bit into the apple anyway. It wouldn't have been the worst thing to happen to something he had wanted to consume. John tugged the waistband of his pyjama pants higher on his hips and padded into the lounge, throwing himself into his chair with a deep sigh. Why was he still dreaming about Sherlock's swan dive from the roof of Bart's Hospital? That was so long ago and anyway, Sherlock had faked the whole thing and was perfectly safe and well. So why did it still bother John? He took another bite of his apple and stared into the fireplace where hot coals still glowed, weakly fighting off the winter chill that seeped into the flat. He supposed he should stoke it up. After placing his apple on the arm of his chair, he knelt in front of the fire and poked at the coals with the fire poker. Then he put some kindling over the coals and blew gently at the glowing orange, encouraging flames to splutter into life and lick the kindling. Another huff of air and fire engulfed all the kindling with delight. John sat back on his heels and watched the fire with satisfaction. He loved keeping the fire going, for some reason. His therapist would tell him that it was something to do with sustaining life and energy and it being a coping mechanism for grieving for Mary but John reckoned he just liked warmth and comfort and a fire offered that. Not to mention that when Sherlock got up and asked how the flat stayed so warm overnight, John could smirk at him and feel like he had one upped the genius.
The young woman leaped up from the chair and after shooting both men a tragic look along with some mumbled words about love and misunderstanding, scurried from the flat in a flood of tears. Sherlock leaned back in his chair, cutting John a glance. John shook his head in mild exasperation. Despite everything, matters of the heart still didn’t belong in the client’s chair, according to Sherlock. According to John, they belonged in bed. John laid his notebook and pen aside, eyeing Sherlock. A month had passed since Sherlock had been discharged from the hospital and John had written up a condensed version of the case for his blog. It had already got over ten thousand hits in the last couple of days, making John feel very smug indeed. He’d called it “The Stationmaster’s Revenge”, much to Sherlock’s disgust.
"I can't," Sherlock whispered, slowly climbing from his seat. "I can't because...look at yourself, John. It's eating you away, can't you see? And I can't let it do that."
"Oh, it's..." Greg paused, jaw working, the easy smile he generally wore sliding off his face. "We've split up permanently."
There were several crying children on the bus, three seats in front of him, and he wished their mother would shush them. They were far too old to be sobbing about the deficit of sugary drinks in their mother’s handbag at any rate and (the doctor in John frowned disapprovingly), sugary drinks really shouldn't have been an option with their young teeth. It would only lead to rot and decay and several trips to the dentist as well as to the doctor for something to settle stomachs dealing with too much acid.
“Oh do shut up,” John laughed, fetching a paintbrush and throwing it at his boyfriend who, with uncanny skill, caught it and twirled it between his fingers.
His feet creaked too loudly on the floorboards and he glanced down, willing them to be silent. As he did, he stopped in alarm. There was a blood splatter on the floor. John knelt down and gently touched the blood with his index finger. It was dry but only a couple of days old. It was clear where the main drop had hit the floor and then splattered outwards, created smaller flicks around it in a circle. He stood again and looked over his shoulder.
"So," John said as the door to the bathroom slammed shut and the plumbing began to rattle and gurgle.
"Good heavens!" John exclaimed, putting his phone down and trying to calm his thundering heart. "Hello Greg."
"Honestly," Mrs Hudson continued, eyes watering uncontrollably, "You'd have to be blind to miss it."
It had been several days since John had been discharged from the hospital and most of those had been spent recovering, sitting in his armchair and being waited on by Mrs Hudson. His hands had been bandaged up, rather like a mummy from a film and it was difficult to even hold a cup of tea. What a tragedy that was! No, really, it was. Sherlock had looked after Rosie and Greg had popped in to explain what had happened. Apparently, Greg had been clobbered over the head the moment John had left the room and had woken up outside by his police car, around half an hour afterwards, sporting a rather impressive lump on the back of his head. It was still there, looking bruised, painful and very tender. He had instantly called for backup but of course, John was gone by the time they arrived. They searched the house, finding the bodies of Mr and Mrs Hall in the bathroom and a lot of drugs used to keep them sedated. That would have explained the shaking of the hands and other extremities that John had put down to a muscular disease, John mused. Other than that, there was no trace of the killer. Greg told John that Scotland Yard was investigating. However, John knew that Sherlock would be on the case, the moment he was able. Sherlock had also shared his tale. He had received John's text and began making his way to the house after ten minutes. But traffic had been hell and he got there via the back entrance (therefore not finding Greg) moments after the car containing John had skidded away. Sherlock had then stolen a motorbike from next door and tore through the streets after it. By some Sherlock style miracle, he had managed to keep pace with the car and track John to some house in the country side. The rest, John knew. But Sherlock wasn't letting on where he had been before all of that and still refused to talk about why he had vanished that morning.
"Go on," John said again, swiveling around with Rosie so their backs faced the fire and they could see the rest of the sitting room. "I know you want to."
"No, wait," John's voice creaked out and he stumbled forwards, trying to chase after Harry, bring her back but his feet tangled together and he staggered, tipping forwards. Suddenly, Sherlock was there, arms winding around John and holding him. "Harry!"
"Last minute shopping," Sherlock said and dashed out the door, knotting his scarf around his neck, getting all tangled up in it.
"By the jar of apricot jam, top cupboard, to your left," John said, rolling his eyes and, with one hand, making Rosie's bottle. She had stopped crying now and instead sucked on the ear of her teddy bear, watching Sherlock with avid fascination as he riffled around the kitchen, still unable to find the tea. He darted around the box of test tubes he had pinched from Bart's Hospital and then stopped, throwing his hands into the air.
John couldn't help laughing at this. "Jeeze, I've been here all day and pretty much invisible but the moment I go to leave, you panic."
The word stung a little, somehow. It was Sherlock's title, not his and he wasn't here to use it. This all felt very wrong, but not just because of Sherlock's absence. Something was off. John sniffed the air. Something smelled funny. He shot Greg a look and gestured at the hallway with his head, indicating they needed to have a chat.
"Hey, don't be mean. I've come a long way from the sausage disaster," John protested, taking a bite of pasta as proof. Harry shrugged and popped the piece of pasta into her mouth.
Harry looked up from her lap and laughed a little. "Yeah? And what's your grand plan, big brother? Piss off to the army again so you don't have to deal with your embarrassing little sister? Send me to my room?"
"Oh, I'm sure we'll be fine, dearie," Mrs Hudson reassured John, cradling Rosie. She kissed Rosie's little forehead tenderly. "She's a real bundle of joy, John. I hope you know that."
John blinked. “I’m good now, thanks. Uh…I had to do a double check on a patient, just to make sure.”
"It's Christmas," Mycroft said after a very pregnant pause in which he looked awkward, almost as if he regretted crashing the party.
Sherlock was silent for quite some time and John knew he was turning the events over in his mind, analysing them like he always did. Rosie looked as though she wasn't going to be waking up soon so John left Sherlock to his thinking and carried Rosie carefully back to her cot, laying her among her blankets and covering her so she stayed warm. He tucked her teddy bear in beside her and just watched her sleep for a while. Yes, she looked like Mary. John closed his eyes for a moment, seeing Mary in his mind's eye, telling him to just get over it. He opened his eyes and left the room, checking his watch again. It was still much too early to even think about doing anything remotely productive so he headed back into the sitting room, grabbed his laptop and plonked himself back in his chair. Sherlock was still thinking, his fingers steepled under his chin and his eyes closed. John opened his laptop and jumped online to check his blog. His most recent account (The Stick Man and The Gallows) had had several thousand views already, even though they'd only just wrapped up the case the other day with Sherlock telling John he had solved it days ago, when really it had taken him longer that the last few. He smiled, satisfied. Despite everything that had happened in the last year or so, his blog and the duo's crime solving antics were still going strong. As he closed the laptop lid, he glanced over at Sherlock who was still thinking. There was something about him, John mused, tucking his laptop under his chair, something that had made John really look at him these past months. He'd found himself looking at Sherlock Holmes in a way he'd never looked at him before. Appreciation? Well, he already knew the man was a genius. At that moment, Sherlock's eyes flew open and he sat up very straight, very alert.
Charles Griffith sent a bouquet of blue flowers. About six months later Holmes showed me a notice in ‘The Times’ of his engagement to the daughter of a peer. “A friend of his father’s,” Holmes commented. “They belong to the same club. And so it continues.”
I went to Holmes’ desk and pulled open the top drawer, looking for his memorandum book. I found it underneath a rat’s nest of string ends, scraps of paper, old pen nibs, and a mangy rabbit’s foot. Then I had to decipher Holmes’ system of organization, which placed Mycroft not under “H” for Holmes, or “M” for Mycroft, or even “E” for Earl of Sherringford, but under “B” for Brother. There it was – I noted the street number and the room. It was almost directly across from the Diogenes Club.
“That has a much simpler answer,” he replied. “The truth is that I’m an unrepentant heroin addict and if I don’t kick my habit soon I shall undoubtedly die.” He glanced at his watch and got off the bed. “As I feared, it’s almost time for Group. I imagine we had better show up there or Fred will come looking for us. Come, Watson! The game is afoot, as the Bard said. If we do not sing, then we will get no supper.”
“Mycroft was born within a year of their marriage,” Holmes continued. “I came along seven years later. Neither of my parents were – how shall I put it? – enamoured of children. They loved travel and they loved their studies. My brother and I placed after those pursuits by some distance. But we never felt any lack. We had first-rate tutors in every subject, but especially the sciences. My parents were constantly abroad and my grandfather always in London with his various mistresses, but Mycroft and I were free to do what we liked, as long as we devoted part of our time to study. And we both avoided being sent away to a noxious public school full of snobs and junior sodomites. For that I will always be grateful to the old man.”
But I had known ever since my first entanglement with the Irishman that my unnatural and unlawful desires would be my eventual downfall. I had lived too long with Holmes, co-mingling my life with his, putting aside any thought of a separate existance, following his lead. I had stood by his side in moments of extreme danger, tended him in illness and injury, and attempted – in vain! – to wean him from his willful and damaging slavery to the needle.
I admit that I had no desire to remain in London. I, too, wished to make an escape, but for my own reasons – reasons I did not share with my companion. But there were more congenial places than a remote and unfamiliar country house. And certainly more congenial methods of traveling there.
“I told you before you left for India that it was a confounded mistake!” he exclaimed, his voice rising in anger. “It was one thing to waste your time with useless medical studies, but to throw away your life in the Army of the damned British Empire? You could have ruled a real empire by my side, here in London! Instead, you almost lost your life and did lose your health – and your looks! – in a cause that is beyond worthless.”
“Take it, Mick,” James said softly. “It’s the chance of a lifetime. Don’t think of this place again. Think only of the future.”
“Oh!” exclaimed Miss Morstan. “Do tell us some of those stories, Doctor! I am longing to hear of your brave exploits!”
“That I did!” she offered. “And Mr. Mycroft, too. I started in service in this house when I was 13, as an under-parlourmaid, so I’ve seen many doings in this family. Come here, Doctor.” She beckoned me to the stairway and held her candle aloft. “This is Mr. Mycroft and Mr. Sherlock as lads.” She showed me a portrait of two children in velvet jackets, their faces solemn. Mycroft even then was a stout fellow, while Holmes had bright, knowing eyes that pierced right to the heart.
Mrs. Ralston thanked me profusely and then thanked me again. I wanted to say, “Madam, do not thank me – I had little to do with this happy event, thank God!” but I refrained. Women do not understand humor; they are literal creatures to the extreme.
“Who the deuce are you? And whatever are you doing wearing my old Norfolk hacking jacket?” I demanded.
“I don’t have the pox, if that’s what you mean!” I retorted. Too late I realized that if the Irishman did believe I was diseased, he might be put off. But I was not and he knew it. He seemed to know everything about me – my health, my habits, even the women I had slept with.
“Or afraid,” Holmes said. “Watson, don’t you ever long for the sensational? For the thrill of danger? Don’t you ever wish to step lightly on the edge of the abyss?”
“You?” the lad frowned. “Didn’t know it was yours, Doctor. The Guv’nor give it to me. Said I’d look a treat in it. ’Specially with me new weskit. Paid three shillings for it and worth every farthing.”
That's when he felt a large hand land on his shoulder. John looked up from his phone. Again. The man was seething now. Perhaps he disliked being ignored?
It was clear that what he had read as desire in the dilation of John's pupils was there for his girlfriend. He had wanted to touch and cuddle with his girlfriend. Sherlock's stomach churned and he sat down in his armchair, legs pulled up to his chest, chin resting on top of his knees.
"You can use my bed, I don't mind." Sherlock opened up a new paper and started reading again. As John opened his mouth to object Sherlock cocked a brow and tilted his head slightly without looking away from the paper. John closed his mouth and marched off to Sherlock's bedroom.
His hands are shackled to the ceiling. His legs are free. If only he could get out of here simply by kicking at the air.
"No," John turned away and angrily poured hot water in a cup. "Where the hell am I supposed to sleep now?"
It has been hours since Sherlock entered his mind palace to revisit his memories. When he comes back to himself, the sun has set, shrouding him in complete darkness. His head doesn't hurt as much though, and there are no screams to be heard; which means the drug is wearing off.
“John,” Sherlock said softly and reached out a hand to touch his shoulder. John flinched away. Sherlock took another step closer and tried again.
He stared at the other chair, idly wondering how long it would be before he lost John to one of his girlfriends.
“Don’t!” John roared, turning around. “Can’t’ you see that it’s you?” he screamed towards Sherlock. Sherlock felt the hairs on his neck stand up and he sank down in his coat as if trying to hide from John.
He did not expect Jim Moriarty to retreat but he did expect the snipers to take the shot. They were too eager, too riled up not to do it.
"I was calling….." John rested his free hand against the wall and panted. "I was calling to ask you to help me with the groceries. They're too bloody heavy and I can't bring them up by myself."
He knew with startling clarity that if there was one person who needed to get out of there alive, it was John. He didn't know why, didn't know how, just that John's life was important and that he needed to live. He took a deep breath and cocked the gun.
Sherlock had spent the whole week doing experiments. Failed experiments because he couldn't stop thinking about John. Sherlock really wanted to see him.
He took a step back from the man, trying not to think about what happened when he got himself into a situation like this. During his twenties, alleys and strange men gave him what he needed most; drugs. But right now, even thinking about that time made him shiver.
Sherlock could not fathom why John had been so upset. He had only just told him the truth. It could have been dangerous. No amount of precautions could really prepare one for the disastrous events that seemed to happen at Barts.
The microwave beeped and Sherlock took out the popcorn. John was already sitting on the sofa, waiting for Sherlock. In his hand were two beer bottles and when Sherlock sat down he handed one to him. Sherlock took it and placed the bowl of popcorn in his lap. John came closer so their thighs were touching slightly, and reached for a handful of popcorn. He grabbed the remote and pressed play, the 20th century fox theme song beginning. Both men sat in silence, their bodies barely touching, sipping their beer and eating popcorn slowly.
The case had been too much, too full of adrenaline and seeing those two men hug and touch in public had awakened the monster John had been trying to quiet down for so very long. The monster inside him that told him Sherlock actually liked him back. The monster that said pretty, powerful, dangerous things like,
The small comforting hand on his arm brought him back somewhat but he still hadn't come back to himself. Someone handed him a glass of water, which he gulped down immediately. Perhaps too fast because the coughing fit that followed after, took him back again. His mind's eye showed him things he never wanted to see.  Sherlock was being waterboarded as John screamed. Sherlock being held down in the pool, thrashing helplessly. Sherlock as the battered victim of war that John had tried to treat in Afghanistan. He hadn't been able to save him. He wouldn't be able to save Sherlock either.
Sherlock efficiently hailed a cab and helped a half-asleep John in. Carefully he fastened their seatbelts. John slumped down in his seat, as much as the seatbelt allowed, and leaned his head on Sherlock's shoulder.
“Mate, are you okay?” a young man asked. Sherlock only looked at him. Not John. He started to mumble, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.” And then he was off, leaving all the not-Johns standing there wondering what was wrong with him. He didn’t stop until he found a narrow alleyway with a container to hide behind. Sherlock leaned back against the container and took deep breaths. He took off his gloves and pressed his hands against the cold metal of the container. A shiver ran down his spine as he lifted his hands to his cheeks. He closed his eyes and now it was John’s warm hands holding him. Tears started to run down his face, his chest once again heaving for a breath. John’s thumb was stroking his cheekbones slowly and Sherlock felt his head being tipped down. He could feel John’s chest against his own. Warm air grazed the side of his mouth, his lip starting to quiver. And suddenly everything fell apart.
"As you wish." And Sherlock began at the beginning, talking about every detail and clue while John slowly fell asleep on his shoulder, leaving a small spot of drool.
John's whole body tenses up. He glances at Sherlock nervously and for the first time, Sherlock catches a glimpse of the fear behind his soldier's mask. Sherlock does not meet his eyes. They both know who he is going to choose. Because no matter how many times he breaks him, there is no Sherlock Holmes without his John.
His voice is raspy as he says, "John. John, I'm sorry. I d-didn't know they wanted…..they wanted to t-touch you after they had killed me. I would never have s-said that I wanted to die if I had known. I am, s-so sorry, John."
Four minutes, two punches and a kick to the abdomen later, the man, whoever he was, had been subdued. John was currently twisting his hand behind his back, his knee between the man's shoulder blades.
[04/10, 5:55 pm] JOHN WATSON: Sorry for expecting you to take care of my daughter in my time of need.
"I g't drugged," John mumbled. Sherlock opened John's eyes, watching the pupils dilate. "It's jus a sed'tive," John continued. Sherlock chuckled as he tried to pull John up.
Nothing more mattered now. Not the world, not the monster in his belly, not even the drink he had ordered.
John closed his eyes and slumped against Sherlock, feeling rather smug that he had, in fact, gotten to cuddle Sherlock, even if it was for just a little while.
Sherlock’s face fell and he carefully moved towards John, hesitantly reaching out to him. John let him. He took hold of John’s shoulders and slowly pushed him against his chest. John’s arms hung limp by his sides. He raised his head and looked up at Sherlock with blank eyes.
At first, Sherlock didn't notice his surroundings but slowly once he had caught his breath, he started becoming more aware of his environment, deducing people who had come out for a stroll. As he was sweeping his eyes over the joggers, he spotted a couple cuddling on one of the other benches.
"You know bloody well what I mean." John turned and leaned back on the kitchen counter. "I can't sleep now!"
Sherlock was starting to worry. It had been three hours and fifty two minutes since he had last seen John. He had promised he would be home in half an hour with milk and honey, the latter of which Sherlock had requested for his experiment.
Sherlock couldn't figure out why John was taking so long. He had tried texting him of course, but the messages weren't delivered or read.
Neither of them said anything for another minute and the only sounds in the room were those of the china clinking together as John stirred his tea.
"What about the lady over there?" John asked, his voice low. Sherlock looked to the right where a woman stood examining some old plates.
Sherlock, instead of taking the cue and shutting up, continues into dangerous territory. “Besides, today wasn’t a date. Judging from your response time, you weren’t even having fun while at Sarah’s. You were LOOKING for a distraction. The only reason you are so angry and upset is that your ego was hurt after she dumped you. She is the fourth female in a row who has ended things with you. And you being-”
Sherlock groans and tries to open his eyes. The slight effort sets his forehead on fire and the thick coating of blood on the left side of his head refuses to let his left eye open fully.
John’s hand clenched around the mug. "That does not give you the right to interrupt my dates all the time."
Now that he is free, John wastes no time in spitting out the gag and rushes over to Sherlock's chair.
"See John? It's nothing to worry about. I will make sure nothing happens to you," Sherlock comforted.
Sherlock blinks several times in rapid succession to make sure it isn't the drug playing tricks on him. He can't ignore the small spark of joy at seeing John.
Sherlock was probably roaming the streets of London, looking for a new case. He did not need John and certainly not after he had been refused.
"Yes." He answered, not daring to meet Sarah's eyes even as his voice sounded steady and confident to his own ears.
But then John Watson happened. Sherlock had lost control of his transport, of his feelings when he was around John. And this realization had come crashing down on him as he stood before John, staring down a criminal.
Forster has stopped talking. John thinks it's his imagination but Sherlock looks green in the face. "You have made your choice, Mr Holmes." Forster smiles blandly.
John picked at his nails, staring at the skull on the mantelpiece and willing Sherlock to come back. Their next confrontation was bound to be awkward and stilted but he could swallow down the discomfort as long as Sherlock was safe.
Sherlock got out of the cab and ducked under the tape to enter the crime scene. John was already waiting for him. Sherlock drank in the sight of John, and for a moment his brain froze. It had been so long since they had seen each other.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope, tilting his head to the right. Upstairs he could hear John moving in his bed. Nothing out of the ordinary so he turned back to his experiment again.
He went back to Baker Street, having forgotten all about the crime scene. He quietly thanked Mrs Hudson and took Rosie with him upstairs. Just as he was murmuring soothing nonsense to the little girl to make her fall asleep, his phone pinged with a new text.
"Sh'lock…... sherlock help," John was breathing heavily on the other end and Sherlock's relief shriveled and died.
He collected himself but he didn't want to hurt anyone so he just stared at the man, willing him to back down.

"Let's go," he said low, smiling softly. John smiled back weakly and felt Sherlock put his hand on his lower back hesitantly. John could finally relax, after a three day long chase around London.
From the back of the room came a soft little thud. John turned his head and looked to the corner behind Sherlock’s chair. Sherlock’s violin bow had fallen down from where it had been balanced by the wall. It wasn’t like Sherlock to keep his bow like that. Slowly John got up and went over to the bow. Carefully he picked it up and put it in the case. Hopefully he placed it right. Inside lay the violin, silently and almost dead now that Sherlock wasn’t holding it under his chin. Hesitantly he touched the woodwork, cautious fingers gliding over the strings. G, D, A, E, Sherlock had once told him. John didn’t know what that meant. A slow tear ran down John’s nose and down on the body of the violin. He pulled his jumper down over his hand and hurriedly dried away the tear, afraid it would leave a mark. Afraid of ruining the violin John closed the case and sat down in Sherlock’s chair. He let the black chair engulf him as he pulled up his legs and rested his head on the armrest. He closed his eyes and listened to his breathing. Faint violin sounds started playing, one of Sherlock's favorite pieces. John could see the furrow in his brow in every crescendo, followed by a softening look in every diminuendo. His arm stroking the bow over the strings, loose wrist, fingers running over the neck, steady and gracefully. At one place the music stopped, a sigh, and then played again, the sound a little different as Sherlock fixed his mistake. John hummed in one with the melody in his head, sometimes interrupted by a sob.
I wondered if Fred knew I was gay, if that information was in my medical records somewhere. Not that it should matter. Although it had always mattered. Mattered to my disapproving father and my disgusted brother. Mattered to my commanding officer in Afghanistan, who suggested I keep it to myself even though the official policy of the British Army was tolerance and acceptance.
I made my way along Pall Mall. The fog was heavy and full of the promise of spring rain. I hailed a cab which took me to Baker Street.
I felt myself sliding into darkness once again. I could no longer open my eyes or feel my feet, my hands. It was as if my life was dwindling away, heartbeat by heartbeat. I could feel my grip on it loosening...
“What was your name again?” my new roommate asked, although I know he’d heard it perfectly well the first time.
“I believe Mick Wiggins’ lodging is not far,” Holmes commented. “Somewhere between here and Covent Garden.”
Holmes glowered at me. “I don’t mind a dish of peas or even a tip of asparagus provided it is covered with a decent sauce, but save me from rabbit leavings, Watson!”
“I thought it the best thing to do.” He rose from the chair and pulled me aside. “Come Watson, let us make room for Young Charles.”
“Holmes, you cannot be serious!” I said to him. “What will we do when we get to this... this place on Cleveland Street?”
“You are surprised, no doubt, at the quality of the repast in such a backwater as Sherringford,” he said.
“You two make me blush!” laughed Mrs. Stamford. “But my husband was too lean before. It is a wife’s job to feed up her spouse. You are looking rather thin yourself, Dr. Watson. Good, regular home-cooking would do you well.”
“I make no judgments about tastes, warped or otherwise,” Holmes replied. “But the lad’s nature is what it is. A leopard cannot change its spots, nor a tiger its stripes. Fear not, Charles, your so-called sins are not my concern. So, this light-of-love was not exactly a lady. But he was a prostitute, am I correct?”
“Are you planning to tell me what is going on?” I asked once we had left the city and were jolting along. Ironically, it was the same road I had taken with Holmes in Mycroft’s carriage not so long before, and heading to the same place – Sussex.
“Yes, at Lady Percy’s salon. But that is not where I first noticed you. That was in Florence. You were looking at the David, gazing on it with fascinated eyes. And I was gazing at you. I could not decide which was more beautiful – the marble or you. But since I could not possess the statue – carrying off that theft is beyond even my ability – I vowed to possess you. So I bided my time, watching and waiting. You may have youth and beauty, my boy, but I have the gift of patience. And anticipation makes the consummation all the sweeter. ‘’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wish’d,’ as the poet said.”
“Lady Percy!” I was truly astounded. I had never heard a woman of gentle birth speak so crudely in my entire life. “I cannot believe you would say such things!”
I sighed. “That is not an uncommon crime. Mr. Holmes has solved many a case of blackmail, including one for a very exaulted personage involving some compromising letters.”
I picked it up off the table and turned it in my hand. It was an ordinary china cup with a blue willow pattern. A cup like any other. Holmes drank his morning brew out of it every day and had done so ever since the first morning we began living here together.
“Quiet!” he urged in a strangled whisper. “Yes, I doubt I’d last a week. And Brother Mycroft knows it. So do the authorities at New Scotland Yard. They have no wish to see me in lock-up. I’m far too valuable to them, drugs or no drugs. But I also can’t stay in this infernal dump for the rest of my admittedly unnatural life.”
I wanted to tell him so many things at that moment, confide in him as I never had to anyone else. But I was still afraid. Afraid to open up. Afraid to admit so many things...
“Of course, my good fellow,” Holmes replied. “The sooner we all finish with this tosh the sooner I can go out into the dirt pile they call a garden and have my afternoon cigarette. By the way, Watson, do you smoke?”
“Wait,” I said, halting before the stairs. “I need to go back to Baker Street and conclude my affairs first.”
I stood there in an almost paralytic condition while the rascal performed upon me an act which I can scarcely bring myself to recall. But I did not stop him. And after a while I did not recoil. After a longer while I did other such things that it shames me to name, so I will not, except to say that Wiggins was a master of his profession.
“They are not my exploits, dear lady,” I replied. “I am only a mere bystander to my friend’s deeds.”
I gulped the fresh night air as a man who was drowning and is pulled from the water to safety. We stood for a number of minutes as I regained my faculties. Holmes did not question me, but stood by quietly, his hand on my shoulder.
“Very good, sir,” said Lovell. But once again the butler’s countenance displayed his intense disapproval. Perhaps I, a product of the middling orders of British society, could easily service myself, but Mr. Sherlock, the son of an obviously ancient and distinguished family, was expected to behave in a manner befitting his exalted rank. In other words, unpacking his own valise was lowering himself in the eyes of all the servants. Lovell’s demeanor seemed to suggest that Holmes’ proximity to me was somehow to blame for this appalling misconduct.
“I... I have heard of such places,” I acknowledged with a shudder. “But I never dreamed that an attractive young gentleman could be trapped in such a sordid web!”
The Irishman shrugged. “He did not need much help. You know that as the truth. I may have given him a slight... push. But no more than that.”
I closed my eyes, feeling the rocking of the carriage, the jolt as it hit another rut in the dreary road to Chichester.
“Well, Johnny Lad,” he said. “You are in some trouble I see. But I think I might be of service to you – if you will be of service to me. Let’s have a little talk together, shall we?”
“Very well,” I said. “But the others must leave or I cannot concentrate. And I must ask the rest of you to stand back.”
Back at the Hall, Holmes ate a hearty breakfast, but I found my appetite had fled. I choked down a scrap of toast and some weak tea and pushed my plate away.
I left Mick to take the seat again and went out to where Holmes was conferring with Inspector Lestrade and Constable Clark. “Is it needful to have a guard on this sick child?” I inquired. “I thought all charges against him had been dropped?”
I undressed him one item at a time. His soiled shirt I slipped off and discarded. Then I checked the dressing, making certain the bandage was secure and the wound had not reopened. But I’m a physician and know how to work around... difficulties.
“Yes, John,” he said, reading my mind. “You have been my study lately. Ever since I saw you on the street in Florence.”
I packed my medical bag and shook out my coat, preparing to take my leave. On the table was my Colt revolver, still loaded. I had brought it thinking I could aid Holmes in some way. I had brought it thinking he was in danger and only I could save him. How many times had I fired that pistol, or else my old service revolver, in Holmes’ defense? More times than I had ever fired it in war, for although I had hours of pistol practice on the range and in the field until I was a deadeye shot, my battle experience began and ended on the same day, July 27, 1880, at Maiwand.
I headed first into Germany. I knew a bit of the language and had read Goethe, being the Romantic that I was, so I walked through that land wide-eyed, taking in the mountains and valleys, the gingerbread villages and fairy-tale castles. And everywhere I found congenial ladies. Or, shall I say, they found me.
And I hoped beyond hope that I would see Sherlock Holmes at least once more before that irrevocable moment came.
“Your opinions are of no consequence,” said the Irishman with growing annoyance. “Learn to guard your tongue or you will regret it.”
That has been the secret I vowed to take to the grave. I am one of those men who are rightly shunned by all decent society. I am a sinner, an invert, and a sodomite – and there is nothing I can do about it.
“Perhaps they are featuring works by my distant relative, M. Vernet,” Holmes speculated. “Or... someone needs my help and is afraid to come here. Or I am being lured for nefarious purposes.”
“Life is what it is, Watson,” Holmes said. The comment was out of the blue. He looked up at the sky, where the sun struggled to break through the glowering clouds.
James left and I sat down again in my armchair. Gladstone tried to climb up into my lap, as he used to do when he was a pup. That was when I first moved in with Holmes. So many years ago, but it seemed like yesterday. I was ill and tired and alone in the world. And I had denied the Irishman for what I thought was the final time. Even though I was no longer young and beautiful, but weary and damaged, he still wanted me. But I could not go with him. Could not...
Gladstone wagged his stump of a tail and drooled on the toe of my boot, which was his way of welcoming me back.
The difference was being fucked by some nameless chap in a characterless flat, with no feeling, no meaning, and no future, and making love with...
“Don’t believe that, John,” Holmes said, staring into my face. “Do not doubt me! I left you in the dark because you are so open, so guileless, that Moriarty would have sniffed out the fact that the noose was tightening around him and all his empire. He would have read it in your face. Then your life truly would have been forfeit. I could not allow that to happen. Instead I placed you in a different kind of peril – and I will never forgive myself for that.”
The servant shifted uneasily, but he unlocked the gate and let me in. I followed him up the path to the front door and entered without hesitation.
“She was American,” Holmes corrected. “Her father was a professor at that university and a great believer in the education of females. My mother was a noted Bluestocking and a confirmed spinster until she met my father. He brought her back to Sherringford and they were wed. My grandfather was not at all pleased, but he could hardly protest his only surviving son’s selection of a bride, especially considering my father was the product of my grandfather’s illicit liaison with Mlle. Yvonne.”
“Yes, Doctor. Love,” said Charles. “I had felt the baser urges before and... and acted upon them. My school was a stew of immorality. The boys there coupled like animals and it was no better at Oxford. But at least at Magdalen I met some higher-minded young gentlemen. We read poetry and philosophy, we listened to music and discussed great ideas. But it all came to naught when a scandal erupted.”
I turned my face away. I could not look at him, it was too raw. “You knew I was going to Moriarty. And you knew I had offered myself to him to save your life.”
I thought of Mick, languishing in the gaol cell. And Thommie, too, with his pale body and dark eyes. So many boys, so many men.
“And you, sir,” said the Irishman. “You are a drunken sot. How dare you upbraid your brother? Look to your own affairs, Henry Watson, for they are in deep trouble. Do not judge your betters.”
“Yes,” I said. “But that matters little because he doesn’t love me. He doesn’t love anything. He is incapable of such emotions. And that is, in the end, a fortunate thing, for he will not miss me too much. And then, after a time, he will forget me absolutely.”
“Yes,” he continued. “The countess especially has been singing your praises to all her friends, but you know how the French are – so effusive in their emotions. And the ladies at Madame Sophie’s house in Lambeth are quite fond of you. I congratulate you on your taste in patronizing that establishment. Madame’s girls are known for their cleanliness, if not their discretion.”
“Fancy what just came in,” drawled one languid fellow, a green scarf carelessly flung about his neck. “That suit looks like it was made for a holiday in Cardiff!”
I smoothed the dark hair away from his temple, searching for the correct place. There would be no pain, no awareness. It would be finished in a second.
No, the rabble at the Glendalough Gallery were beyond Bohemian. They were of that breed who call themselves Aesthetes. Powdered dandies, their hair curled and smelling of hyacinth, this motley mob lounged in the entryway, swilling free champagne and gossiping in loud voices.
“That was rare, sir!” Thommie cried. “I came all over, too, just from your cock inside me.” He sat up and looked over my shoulder. “Are you ready for a go, too, sir? Just give me a few moments to catch me breath.”
“Oh, Dr. Watson!” cried Mrs. Hudson, meeting me at the door. “I was praying you’d return home soon!”
James stood and wiped his hands on a towel. “Will do, Mr. Sherlock. And I’m so pleased, Doctor! You’ll be right as rain from now on, I know it.”
Although I had been dreading it, all in all, it was a most pleasant dinner. The food, from the soup to the fish to the stewed beef to the dessert of cherry ice, was first-rate. Mrs. Hudson is a good, plain cook, but Stamford – with the help of his in-laws – had engaged a very fine cook indeed.
“Well, I am relieved to hear that,” I replied in amusement. “For I hold him in equally high esteem.”
“No,” he said. “I think I shall remain here until I hear from Lestrade. But you go home and get some rest, my dear Watson. And don’t worry. I’m safer here than in Windsor Castle. Even if the Professor’s minions were to break into the Diogenes Club, they would never find their way to me through this maze of rooms. Or else they would be pitched out for the noise. The first rule of Diogenes, after all, is silence always.”
The entry hall was dim and cool, as it had always been. The mirror on the wall. The ticking of the clock in the parlour. Nothing had changed, seemingly.
I sat in our rooms for a long while, like a condemned prisoner counting the hours until he faced the noose. I heard the tall clock on the landing strike six. It was morning. I needed to depart soon. It would not do for Holmes to awaken and come looking for me. I needed to go and leave no trace behind or else all would be for naught.
The Irishman was in his dressing gown, sitting at his writing table. The room was in disarray, with cases and boxes half packed and clothes in piles on the divan and the chairs.
“Hot water!” I barked. “And please remove this monkey!” The beast was at that moment swinging from the draperies, chattering loudly.
I could not look at James and deceive him, but I also could not tell him the truth. I couldn’t tell anyone the truth. I couldn’t even face that truth myself.
The women and other servants left the room and I endeavoured to examine my patient. There was no blood to be seen and he was conscious, if unresponsive. But he would not release the bedclothes.
I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t Sherlock Holmes reclining on a pile of large pillows on the floor of a room rigged out like the tent of an Arabian sheikh, smoking a hookah, and playing chess with a monkey wearing a fez. I had to blink to make certain my eyes were not deceiving me.
“And so I do,” Holmes confirmed. “But so does every man. Including doctors, who, as you are well aware, make the most devious and dangerous murderers. I have always thought that the Whitechapel Ripper must be a surgeon. Or a skilled butcher, which is practically the same thing. The same skills are required to disembowel those lamentable females as to heal them, although I must admire the swiftness and precision of the fellow’s handiwork compared to most physicians of my acquaintance.”
“You’ll have to ask Mr. Sherlock,” said the flustered footman. “I’m sorry, sir! Please don’t tell Mr. Lovell!”
“I’ll go climb into me duds,” said Thommie. “Wait right here, gentlemen. I’ll be back in two shakes.” And the boy disappeared through the side door.
“Unfortunately, Mick and Dilly are being held pending charges for a very serious crime,” I acknowledged. “Their health is not a crucial issue to the authorities.”
“Jane tells me you are the adventurous sort, Doctor,” said Miss Morstan, her voice low and caressing. “I am very interested in adventure. At least in reading about adventure. You are a published author, I am told? How very thrilling!”
“Of course,” Holmes sniffed. “A pair of petty malefactors named Harrington and Noonan. Fisher was not kicking in a fair share of the loot he was getting from the victims he and Wiggins and poor Dilly Mitchell were blackmailing. Instead, he was gambling with it – and losing. But the gambling dives in London are part of this greater syndicate, as are many of the lower public houses, opium dens, and brothels – including the one we patronized this evening. So Fisher’ cheating of his criminal fellows came swiftly to the attention of the brutal genius at the center of this vast enterprise, a man so dreaded that even his minions tremble to speak his name.”
After a short while the front door opened and a man in a black tailcoat walked down the path. He glared at me through the bars. “Go away,” he hissed.
“There is a music hall in Holborn,” said Charles. “The Red Cockerel. Well, it is not exactly a music hall, it is more like a public house with a stage in the back room. But that’s where I met her.”
“It must have been a misunderstanding,” she said soothingly. “They must have gone astray in the post. That is why I came again today to see you. I only wished to ascertain for myself that you were indeed well. I could not allow myself to entertain the thought that you might be... be...”
I immediately realized how out of touch I was with my fellow travelers, or indeed with contemporary fashion and mores in general. For one thing, no one else was wearing a tie. Many were not wearing shirts at all, or else the skimpiest of singlets. And they were young. Perhaps no younger than I, but they seemed of a different generation. With my plain white shirt, my brigade tie, and my officer’s moustache, I was a living anachronism. I winced to think that I had made a dreadful error.
Holmes’ statement on our walk had left me shaken. He’s a man who rarely expresses emotion, yet this was, for him, an emotional declaration if ever I’d heard one. I wasn’t certain how to parse it – or if I should even attempt to. Holmes is such a confounding creature at the best of times. I often hesitate to take what he says to heart. He also lives to vex me, mainly because he can. Yes, he plays me like he plays his damned violin – sometimes with such sweetness it stirs my soul, but other times with a discordance that makes me want to punch him in the jaw!
We drove back to Hampstead in silence. There was nothing to say. My humiliation was complete. In the days that followed, my anger at myself and the world grew. In my bouts with the fencing master I no longer attempted to score off him, I attempted to run him through. And when I boxed with the Irishman’s bodyguards I urged them on to punish me as best they were able. But the Irishman’s servants had been instructed never to hurt me, no matter how I might bait them, under pain of their own death, and so my frustration intensified.
But he shook me off. “I must go and see to the champagne... Baker. I said I will be back shortly.” And he walked out the door, shutting it behind him.
“But... you cannot have known everything!” I insisted, trying to digest this information. “You must think that Moriarty kidnapped me, but the truth is that...”
Baker Street would never be my first choice for a long-term residence. The street is noisy and dirty, with cars and motorbikes shooting up and down at all hours, the local tube stop is crowded with tourists on their way to Madame Tussaud’s, and it was too far for me to walk to the clinic, adding expense and inconvenience to my daily commute.
I nodded. “Feeding prisoners a sufficient diet is not a high priority at institutions of incarceration.”
“Discombobulated,” I whispered. “That does not even begin to describe what this has done to me. I cannot grasp what has happened – or why. And... Moriarty? What happened to him?”
In many ways life with him was easy, even pleasant. That is, if you didn’t think too much about what you were doing with him. Or about what the Irishman was doing when he wasn’t with you. I tried not to think about that. I tried to think about pleasure, and presents, and beautiful places – Florence, Venice, Rome, Capri, Paris, Vienna. About handsome clothes and parties and dancing to lively music, surrounded by people who lived only for their own enjoyment, people who were always laughing and drinking and making love.
“No!” Wiggins wailed. “Doctor! For the love of God! You know me. You know I wouldn’t do nothin’ like this!”
“Men do not come here for the quality of their brew,” said Holmes, drinking down his beer without flinching. “We must find our way to the main attraction.”
“Assuredly.” The door was already broken and the reek of urine emanated from the gloom within. “But this entrance seems especially... distasteful. Not to mention odorous.”
Alfie seized my hand and squeezed it. “That’s good of you, Doctor! If Mr. Sherlock can see it clear to help Mr. Charles, then he’s a fine, fine fellow to my mind – even if he is the Earl’s brother!”
Holmes stopped and looked at me strangely, his dark hazel eyes glittering. “You have no idea, my dear fellow. No idea whatsoever.”
“Lord, Holmes,” I said. “You sound like a perfect socialist! I admit bees appear admirable creatures, but do they create great works of art? Compose beautiful music? Write uplifting literature?”
“No matter, James,” I sighed, observing the young man’s distress. “I won’t say a word. I can see that this visit is to be full of unsettling revelations.”
The Irishman’s grey eyes flashed with anger. “Luck! You would lay your life upon luck? Luck is for the weak of mind. Luck is for women. Luck is for those doomed to lose.”
“It’s a long story, Mrs. Hudson,” I said, feeling the full weight of my guilt. This would affect not only Holmes and myself, but the entire household. “But I believe the time has come for me to make my own way in the world – without Mr. Holmes.”
I took a deep breath and felt the sharp jab. My hand went to the bandage. My left side. “What did it hit?”
“Very good, Watson,” Holmes breathed raggedly as I gently probed the injury. “You’ll make a detective yet. But you neglected to mention that my assailant was formerly a sailor in Her Majesty’s Navy who obtained the knife, a three-inch steel blade with a single edge and an ivory handle, in Hong Kong. And that he has a tattoo of a dragon on his right arm that was made in Macau, and another of a bird on his left shoulder that was made in the Japanese Islands, probably Kyushu. And that he walks with a limp from a childhood illness, most likely a form of poliomyelitis.”
“You don’t know... you can’t know the half of it, Holmes,” I blurted. “Or you would not be kissing me. You would not want to look at me, if only you knew all!”
“We all have our weaknesses,” I said softly. “Nothing is so shameful that releasing it won’t make it better. Confession eases the soul.”
