Tony closed the distance between him and Steve, leaning his body against his and, without waiting for any confirmation beyond Steve’s lack of resistance and his firm hands on his waist, Tony, with his heart pounding with excitement or nervousness, he couldn’t quite say which one, kissed him.
Before he could come, Tony pulled his cock out of Steve's mouth, gasping, breathing like a drowner. “You're gonna kill me with your hands and now with that mouth of yours,” he said, between heavy breaths, to Steve, who smiled as he wiped the drool that ran down one corner of his mouth.
“Come on, your coffee will get cold.” Steve pointed to the cup on the outside of the island and Tony found himself walking over there, as if in a trance. He had no control over his own body. All he saw was Steve looking at him, guiding him to where he wanted Tony to stay.
"On the contrary, deary," Tony said as he filled his second mug. "If I don’t drink there, yes, something very bad can happen."
Steve's voice was lifeless, without any emotion and he felt his face was the same as he faced the lawyer. "Aren't you going to write any of this down?" Steve pointed his head at the notepad.
"Mr. Stark," Steve called, getting up from the table. "I have no reason to question your work. If Natasha sent you, then I have even less reasons," Steve walked around the table and went over to Tony, who had also gotten up. "I trust you, Mr. Stark."
Tony tried again to step out of the shadows and say something, anything, make any sound so that Steve knew he was there, but he couldn’t.
"Okay," Steve was in automatic mode. Completely numb. They had his son's DNA at the scene of a crime, which was impossible, because his son wasn't a murderer. He needed to see Peter. Now.
"Knock knock," Steve blinked, coming back to reality, and found Tony with his face free of the armor, looking at him with an amused smile. "Is my Steve in there?"
Although Tony and Steve shared the leadership of the Avengers, everyone knew who really led them. It was to Steve that everyone turned to looking for guidance before, during, and after a battle. It was for Steve that everyone went looking for a partner to improve their fighting techniques. It was to Steve that SHIELD and the government sent their orders. All Tony did was design cool things in his lab to protect his family and make them more effective at fighting the bad guys. And eventually he helped save the day.
Tony smiled without showing his teeth and looked at the reporters, who still hadn't realized they were parked there. "Okay, we're going out now," he looked back at Steve. "Do you remember when I said that the people inside that police station are like sharks just waiting to smell your blood to attack?" Steve nodded in agreement. "Well then. Those over there," Tony pointed to the reporters at the police station door. "They're the vultures, waiting for the remains that the sharks will leave behind. But don't let them fool you," Tony became serious, his features hardened and all the smoothness from before disappeared, giving way to a new aspect of the lawyer, which left Steve with goosebumps and with the certainty that this wasn't a look that he liked to see in Tony. "Those vultures over there won't think twice about attacking by surprise if it means getting fresh news to present on the evening news. If shattering you means a career bonus, they won't wait for the shark's remains. They'll eat you up, right here, outside. Got it?"
“One of the countless dimensions of the Multiverse, Captain. As Sorcerer Supreme, I am needed there.”
“What for? We were already on our way back,” Steve frowned and Tony smiled.  “It's all right, Stevie.” He put a hand on the soldier's shoulder, that smiled lightly. “You won’t be able to get rid of me that easy.”
“I think that’s it, then,” Steve said at last, when it became clear that Tony would remain hidden and silent. Steve’s face changed. His eyes fell, sad and disappointed, his mouth curved down and he stepped away from the roof rail. “Maybe next time, right?” Tony saw that he tried to smile, but failed. And with that painful scene to see, Steve turned and went into his apartment, leaving Tony alone again.
He still wasn't sure why he had accepted Steve's offer. It wasn’t normal, not at all common, for something like this to happen.
Tony thought with a smile. The soldier would probably say that Tony didn’t give himself enough credit and that he did much more for the Avengers than he thought.
Tony took Steve’s outstretched hand, who wasted no time, and pulled him close, holding his waist with his free hand, holding him in his embrace, as if he were afraid that Tony would try to run away again. Tony crossed his arms around Steve’s neck. They both smiled.
Natasha then gave the pocket cards, one at a time, to each of them, totaling two. Tony looked at his cards: a three of diamonds and an ace of spades.
Steve shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think while I relived those moments and after I came back. There’s no point in brooding over what happened, Tony. We learn from our mistakes. Let’s move on and keep an eye on each other so it doesn’t happen again.” Steve looked at his hand still opened in Tony’s direction. “You come with me? Shall we start over together? I want you so much with me.”
“I know. But I wish you had trusted me earlier. I always trusted you, Tony, even when you thought that outside that armor you weren’t someone trustworthy.”
Tony heard all the details that Pepper passed on to him and said goodbye, not without first spending all the amazing adjectives that he remembered to thank the wonderful person that Pepper was.
"The point is, I know what you're going through, I understand what it's like. And it doesn't matter to me if we've known each other for ten years, a month or a few hours ago. It's going to sound crazy, but I
was the chosen one to take over. That's when you and the boy's father showed up at the police station. I'm still learning everything about the case."
"Please tell me there's pepperoni pizza somewhere in this stack." Tony pointed to a huge stack of boxes on the kitchen counter.
He opened the first box and set it aside when he saw that it was empty. He opened the second, took a slice, took a bite, and looked to the other side, meeting Steve's gaze. Well, maybe finding is not the right word because the soldier's eyes were fixed on Tony's mouth.
“Oh, my God, Tony, your mouth-” Steve gasped when Tony pulled it out of his mouth and held it with his hand to focus on its head, which was already damp from precome. Tony salivated and pumped Steve’s cock a couple more times.
Tony looked around, but they were alone in the cafe. There was no one to snoop on. And he could trust Rhodes. "I'm here as a favor."
"Well, so that's it," Steve shifted, looking suddenly uncomfortable, and headed for the door, stopping under the doorframe. "I'm going upstairs, take a shower, try to clear up."
If one day someone ever imagined what a super strength child would be, it wouldn’t be necessary to go very far to see the results, Tony thought seeing the Asgardian god and the green giant crushing A.I.M. agents. He headed back toward the Scientist Supreme who was already under Clint and Natasha's eye.
Tony didn’t know if Steve was simply referring to his wardrobe. It seemed to be much more than just “you can borrow my clothes whenever you want”. It seemed deeper and more meaningful.
And that was the last coherent sentence that Tony could say, because to feel Steve's cock inside him completely numbed him, leading him to a state of completeness that Tony never imagined could be achieved. Steve moved slowly back and forth, back and
“And second, if that person could handle it, their antidote would have to be extremely accurate, potent and, I would say, perfectly tailored for that person. There is no other way to get rid of so much pollen so quickly and effectively. But all of this, of course, hypothetically.” Strange looked from Steve to Tony.
Tony opened his mouth to keep the argument, but closed it. He decided to make amends. “Probably not. I probably would’ve opened it anyway.” Tony shrugged.
All the while, Steve watched the show Tony was putting on only for him, mesmerized and in a state of horniness that he had never thought possible in his life. Seeing Tony in that position, completely exposed, opening himself, was a vision he’d never been able to color in his dreams, because it was too distant even for his most insane delusions. Tony looked so fucking gorgeous with his hole staring at Steve and his cock totally hard, with Tony's hand around it, going up and down, pulling out the best sounds from him.
Steve finished his sentence when Tony finished ripping the last button off Steve's shirt. Maybe on another day, in another reality, he would have the patience to torture Steve and open one by one of those infinite buttons, but not there, not at that moment.
Tony smiled back and it was glorious to see how genuine that smile was, reaching his eyes, making them shine and wrinkle at the sides. Steve’s heart was filled with affection and a need above all others to defend Tony from anything that could harm him and get that smile off his face. He was even more beautiful when he smiled like that. And Steve decided that he would make Tony smile like that every day, because that was what Tony deserved. Steve would make him happy and loved.
Finally. The right words had been said, the feelings had been transcribed. It was finally time to admit and put a name on things. Because that was exactly how Tony felt. There it was.
“Very well. Do what you do best.” He looked ahead and could see sharply the portal opened by Ares, which was not yet visible. “Ares and Cerberus must be on the ground,” he said to Thor and Wanda, who agreed.
He searched for Steve's belt and skillfully undid it. Steve groaned in Tony's mouth, who smiled in the kiss.
Steve was still trying to contain the tears that were streaming down Tony’s face, a dam that had burst and was showing no signs of stopping. “Tony, let me help you,” he said quietly, so quietly that Tony was afraid he hadn’t heard.
Tony forgot for a moment how to breath. Steve knew how to be convincing like few others and managed to convince Tony with an alarming ease. He was assertive, but always so kind, sweet and warm. Tony just wanted to do whatever Steve asked him, without even thinking twice.
“And you still say you're a business man.” Steve shook his head and moved toward the quinjet, leaving Tony behind.
Or maybe it was when Tony first got news from Steve in months and learned that he, Sam and Natasha were working underground and desperately wanted to use the flip phone that Steve had sent in the mail and ask the soldier to come home.
Steve smiled. “First, I’m stopping pretending that I don’t want you, that I don’t desire you, that I don’t want to start my life over with and for you. You only need to say yes, that we start.”
When did listening to Steve calling him my love become so natural and with the power to ignite Tony’s soul?
“Agent Romanoff, Agent Barton, Thor, and Captain Rogers are on a mission in the service of S.H.I.E.L.D. Mr. Wilson, Mr. Parker and the Hulk are in Central Park facing the Mole Man.”
Everyone around the table, including Natasha, started laughing. Fury put his hands on his waist and frowned.
Our dear ones traveled to enjoy Tony's birthday gift for Steve, and if I can say it before we start, they've had a lot of fun.
"I'm Natasha, and these are Thor, Clint, Sam, and Vision. We are members of a team called Avengers” she thought a little “Was there something like that on the other Earth?”
"We have pepperoni, extra cheese, bacon and mushrooms," Natasha said, already sitting on the floor behind the center table in the penthouse's living room. “Pepperoni are the top boxes.”
Tony gasped out of his thoughts in shock, which soon turned into a sequence of incongruous and growing moans. Steve was back, with Tony's feet supported in his shoulders, his hands in Tony's butt, opening his cheeks to give him free and complete access to his hole, where he arrived without further warning with his tongue.
"I'm going upstairs and call May to tell her the news. And ask her to send me the rest of my clothes.”
“What happened to you?” it wasn’t the most important question in the ranking of questions that Tony made up in his head for when (if) that moment came. But he still didn’t have the courage to reach the top three. And Steve knew he was stalling. And, God bless him, he pretended it was okay for Tony to dodge what he really wanted to know.
The image of a mountain appeared on the holographic screen behind Fury, and a report of more than thirty pages, with charts and maps, appeared on Steve's tablet screen as he touched the "A.I.M." icon.
Tony smiled with one of Steve’s nipples between his teeth. “I'd call you out about your language, darling, but right now? Right now I don't give a fuck.” Tony stopped for a second and raised his head enough to look at Steve. “Actually, I'll give you the best of fucks.”
To his surprise, Steve called, putting his eight chips on the table, followed by Natasha, who did the same, closing the betting round.
"For everything you have said and because I was watching the boy. He's kind and very intelligent. But not evil-genius intelligent. He's the hero-type kind of genius, who wants to help people. I talked to him."
Steve looked up and Tony wasn't quick enough to look away and pretend he wasn't looking. They stared at each other for long seconds and Tony wasn't sure what he was seeing there. There was certainly all the pain and despair for the son he embraced, but Steve's gaze also carried another feeling, deeper information, more difficult to reach. Gratitude? No. He had already said several times that he was grateful that Tony was there. Shame? Probably not. Tony had already seen Steve in one of his worst moments, when they had still exchanged a few words and that only brought them closer. Tony then wondered what Steve might be seeing back, what was Tony's gaze denouncing? Would it be as obvious to him, as it was to Rhodes, that Tony fantasized about the idea of them trying to go out together after the trial was over? Was Tony letting out that his interest there ended up being more than just professional? No, it couldn't be, right? He knew how to hide better than that. As a precaution, it was best to prevent Steve from keep seeing whatever Tony's eyes were giving him. Then Tony blinked, pulling them both out of the trance and walked over to where Steve and Peter were.
Steve stopped with his mug in the air, halfway to his mouth, and looked at Tony through the reflection in the window glass. “Can you really?”
"We just met, Tony," Steve sighed, embarrassed. "You are the lawyer who came to defend my son. You shouldn't have seen any of this, nor should you have been through any of this. It's not your job to help me during a panic attack," Steve hid his face at the wheel again.
"What do you want for lunch?" Steve asked, leaving the shield at the side of the elevator, taking off his gloves, helmet, and the top of his uniform, wearing only the blue thermal T-shirt, pants, and boots.
Tony opened his eyes first, not because he was the morning person there - no, that was always Steve’s role - but he was lying facing the big window that took over almost the entire right wall of the room, and the rays of the sun completely hit his face.
, esteeming him as if he was something of great value that deserved all the care, Tony finally felt something that he thought wasn't possible. He felt free.
Steve pulled Tony and held him around the waist. Tony smirked and wrapped his arms around the soldier's neck. “You’re not lost. You’re not and never have been. Let him go.”
Tony felt his face heat up. Apparently, his musings were too sharp, too easy to understand. “Sorry, I don’t ... You don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”
“Look,” he said, looking at her. “I’ve been thinking that, just maybe, my version of the other Earth, your father, hasn’t considered all the effects of having several versions in various dimensions. Maybe he didn’t have time to dig deeper, maybe he didn’t consider that part so relevant.” He looked at Steve, who nodded encouragingly. “What I'm trying to say is that maybe there are really links that unite our different versions, such as an umbilical cord, and by which we unconsciously exchange information about our lives in those other dimensions. How else would you explain our sudden love for you, our need to protect you, Steve knowing the affectionate nickname that his version of your Earth gave you, and more than that: how did you come to stop
Or maybe it was when they saved the world from Thanos and went back home together and Tony finally realized that everything was fine and that he would never let Steve leave again.
Tony laughed, but the movement made his groin throb and he was reminded of why both of them were there.
“Damn it, Tony.” Steve was panting and Tony could’ve sworn he could come just hearing Steve talking like that. “Maybe another day.” Steve smiled and Tony smiled back at the prospect of another day.
Tony's hands came alive, flew to the hem of Steve’s T-shirt, and pulled it up, revealing the soldier's glorious chest. Tony ran his fingers along the contours of Steve's muscles, making him shiver and return thirsty to Tony’s mouth.
“I love you, Steve Rogers,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair again. “It’ll be wonderful to share my path from here to infinity with you.”
The guests - only their closest friends – broke out in cheers and celebrations to the new couple, the now named Stark-Rogers.
It was still a mystery as to why those Doombots had appeared, but if there was one thing they had already learned was not to try to question Victor Von Doom.
“It was my idea, yes. I-I thought about what you would’ve preferred.” Tony Stark, stuttering, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy the moment, it doesn’t happen often. Only Steve Rogers has that power.
He slid the hand that was in Steve's hair to the back of the soldier's neck and pulled him. Without offering any resistance, Steve released Tony's hand and used his hands to hold the engineer by the waist while Tony nestled Steve's face in his own hands.
"Is this some new method of torture?" Tony asked, standing up on his elbows to watch Steve, who smirked.
"Of absolutely everything you can get about the victim's parents and about the victim himself. I want everything, names, registration numbers in every possible and imaginable official office, social media history, everything. Got it? Everything you can get for me, I need it."
"To be praised like that," Steve shrugged, took a bottle of olive oil and poured the vegetables, cubed them with parchment paper and put the mold in the oven. He turned to Tony and smiled the brightest smile since they met. "Thank you."
The seconds that passed seemed like eternity, but the rational part of Steve was still commanding. Nothing had really happened, or they would see pieces of armor scattered around, right?
Tony leaned back and propped himself up on his elbows, giving Steve a privileged view of his body and smirked. “Do you see anything you like, Steve, darling?”
Tony frowned. S1? What was that? Was anyone else receiving that message? He glanced up to make sure that someone else was as confused as he was when his eyes finally found Steve’s, which was shining. The soldier looked at his own tablet and back at Tony, who felt his stomach twist when he understood.
Steve stopped with his mug in the air, halfway to his mouth, and looked at Tony through the reflection in the window glass. “Can you really?”
“All right, Vision, you can drop her n...” Natasha never finished that sentence. When her eyes finally met the girl’s, all the questions she thought about to ask herself were useless, because the answers were already right there in front of her.
Slowly, he opened the lid of the box and the contents glowed with an intense and seductive red light, which pulsed in the rhythm of Tony’s heart, blinding him for a few moments, lighting up the entire vault, enveloping Tony completely, filling his lungs with pure light. Tony could feel the warm, vibrant glow that came from the contents of the box, from the mysterious ingredient, and being in the presence of that thing, whatever it was, brought Tony into a state of emptiness that he had never felt before. The red light engulfed him, traveling through every space of his body, inside and out, emptying it, making it a receptacle for the light that invaded him, taking him over, but it also convinced him it would take care of him the best possible way, that everything would work out, that Tony just needed to trust.
The digital clock on the wall in the living room indicated that it was past seven at night. Tony went toward the refrigerator in search of something to eat and stumbled upon something soft on the floor. He smiled a little when he saw what it was.
something. But in the end, Steve just smiled tiredly and said, "See you in the morning, Tony, in the meeting with Fury.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Tony shift his weight from one leg to the other impatiently.
"Not the criminal organization called Hydra," Thor explained. "But the monster on which the Red Skull was inspired to baptize it.”
“Me and you, we tried to talk.” Steve was looking at Tony. “Before things really got worse during the War, we met at the Mansion and talked.”
"We're approaching the portal," Natasha's voice appeared on the comms. "And we already have the Dragon's look. He's huge.”
Tony laughed through his nose. “Sometimes I think you have no idea how big you are for other people.” He held up his hand, interrupting Steve before he started. “I know what you’re going to say. I know you never wanted any of this. I know you only do what you think is right and blah blah blah. But you need to accept who and what you are for us.”
Tony sighed. He never realized that he really had a masochistic side, but apparently Steve had the power to awaken all of the dark and unexplored sides that Tony had. For the good and for the bad.
“I get it, Rogers. I'll never be able to reach your standards and neither would you have the stomach to help me. Everything's fine. Just… just go away. You can let me handle this on my own.” Tony's voice was much more confident than he felt inside. “I’ll find a way, like I always do.” It was too much humiliation for one day. Being intoxicated by a flower that turned everything Tony felt for Steve into an insane and pulsating desire, leaving Tony out of his mind, with space to think and want Steve and nothing else.
Tony looked away from the tablet and looked at Fury, who was still talking, but now the image behind him was of a fenced plain with a cow raising on it, but Tony had no idea what Fury was talking about. It could be about the next alien invasion or it could be about the best milking techniques. It'd have the same effect on him. Tony nodded thoughtfully, as if he were seriously considering whatever Fury was talking about and looked back at the tablet.
They were facing each other, with only a fraction of air separating them, once again oblivious to the noise and the people around. With his free hand, Tony reached for Steve's hand on the bar counter and, without looking away, twined his fingers around Steve's.
Tony managed not to scream. “Besides, even if we had, she could never have been eighteen. You've been off the ice for a little over a decade. Do you realize how none of this makes sense?”
“Do you have any more coffee?” Tony asked. “Or something stronger? I don’t know if I’ll be able to tell you all this dry.”
Steve stepped away from the sink and took a cloth napkin to wipe his hands. He approached Tony and less than ten inches separated them. Tony looked up to find Steve's blue eyes, at least a taller head than the engineer. Tony felt his heart race and his mouth went dry.
"On your way back," Ross stopped them before they could continue. "We'll continue our conversation," Steve nodded without saying a word. Ross pointed to an approaching man. He was tall, black-skinned, with a rigid posture and all of him shouted seriousness and appreciation for rules. His eyes were fixed on Steve as he approached, and Steve had the feeling that the feelings in them were anger, disgust and contempt towards him. But the man's expression cleared when he saw Tony. Surprise, amazement, and bewilderment took over his features and Steve was sure the man knew his lawyer from somewhere else. The unknown man stopped in front of Steve and looked him in the eye.
Steve leaned over Tony and kissed him deeply while removing his fingers. Steve calmly ran his hands over Tony’s body, warm, soft, demanding, while Tony hugged him back, clinging to Steve as if that were his salvation. Steve unhurriedly held his erection and after aligning himself with Tony, he pushed in carefully.
"Mind sharing the information with us?" Tony said in his already metallic voice behind the armor’s helmet.
Tony knew that was the time to leave for good, to leave and not look back. But he knew, Steve knew, and after the Civil War, the world knew:
A chill ran through Tony's body. Steve's smiles, those sincere ones, always too fast, elusive and extremely rare, were the ones Tony liked the most, but he'd never admit it out loud.
“Happy?” Liz laughed with sarcasm. “My happiness died embracing the love of his life in the midst of the flames of a laboratory in an Earth that no longer exists.” The tears marked the face of her mercilessly.
“No, I don’t know. But you didn’t know it either, Tony. The next time you arrive at such a crossroads, trust me. We work better
As if they had taken one of Thor's strikes, Wanda and Bruce rushed out of the room to prepare the other Quinjet, heading for Queens.
- Tony forced himself to open his eyes and inhale more often, feeling the scent of the coffee and letting the caffeine pull him out of the wonderful torpor that Steve was taking him to.
How did you already know? I just got the call from the Chief," Steve's head was in no shape to put together a coherent timeline at the moment, but that didn't make sense, even in the midst of that chaos.
“Whose idea was it to set two alarms?” Clint Barton, the Hawkeye, grunted as he set his quiver behind his back.
They had chosen to go walking that night and, surprisingly, it was a quiet walk, with no one asking for photos, no autographs, or any unsuspecting thief trying to spoil that rare night off.
"You know," he said, his voice louder than the music. Steve turned around immediately and stared at him wide-eyed. Tony smiled. “For someone who's turning 100, you're in great shape.”
Steve held up his hand and stopped an insolent tear from running down Tony’s face. With the same hand, he grabbed Tony’s chin and lifted it gently, as if Tony were something precious that could break at the slightest touch. Steve took the coffee mug from Tony’s hand, bent down, and placed it on the floor, along with his own. When he got back to Tony’s height, Steve took his hands and smiled without showing his teeth.
"Mr. Stark?" the woman Tony was talking to called. Tony turned. "The Chief is waiting for you," she pointed to the door to her left. Tony followed, and Steve went with him.
“How did you know I was out there?” It was eating Tony alive. He hadn’t many things he was proud of in his life, but his inventions were certainly some exceptions. If one failed, what was the purpose?
think?” Tony's voice dropped automatically to speak to Steve. It was instinctive. Whenever Tony wanted Steve's opinion in a delicate situation, he spoke softly, so that only Steve would listen, so that it was their own conversation.
Tony swallowed. Of course, it had been his idea. He knew Steve didn’t like big events, especially when he was the reason. Even if the big event in question was his funeral. Tony knew what Steve would have preferred; what Steve would have liked. Also, and that was something Tony would never admit out loud, Tony wanted to say goodbye to Steve
“I think you already know," she said, her voice jovial, but also very bitter, full of sadness. What had happened to her?
The Chief pointed to the two chairs that were between the table and Steve and Tony. "Sit down," Chief Ross looked carefully at them, but stopped at Steve. "Thank you for coming so quickly,
Stephen Strange smiled crookedly in that enigmatic way only he could and that got on Tony's nerves. Whenever that little smile appeared, Strange's eyes became more mysterious, dark and impossible to read. He was extremely annoying, to say the least.
he wondered with a small part of his mind, because the rest were hyperconscious of Steve's presence there, emanating warmth and security, a familiarity that Tony liked to have around.
He didn’t realize where he was, not even that they had moved or that Steve had turned him the other way, until his knees hit the edge of the bed. So, he let his body take over control, since the rational part had apparently already short-circuited. His hands slid from Steve’s neck and hair to his strong chest, feeling every curve, every muscle, feeling his heart make his body vibrate, until his fingers gripped tightly at the hem of the t-shirt that Steve wore and, with dexterity, began to slide the fabric upwards, revealing the immaculate skin it hid. Without shame, Tony allowed himself to touch every bit of Steve he was revealing, delighting to feel the skin prickle under his fingers.
He was exhausted. The flight hadn’t been pleasant, not at all comfortable, and his whole body was sore, and Tony knew that much of his dissatisfaction was simply because he didn’t want to be there.
He sighed into Steve's mouth as their bodies touched. Skin with skin, heat with heat, not a bit softened by the cold air of the air-conditioning. Tony's brain was a mess of many "yes," "finally," and "it's better than I could ever have imagined." Some time later he would try to describe the feeling of having Steve naked in his arms and wouldn’t be able. Tony could only let his hands lead the way and hope his brain was recording everything.
"Don’t look so worried," Tony told Steve. He turned his hand, leaving the palm up as an invitation, and Steve put his hand over Tony's, entwining his fingers. “I promise you'll like it.”
“I...” Tony's heart melted and he came to embrace Steve. “I want to know more about who she is, but I also know that it would be unfair to just show up there. She thinks she's alone, that she'll never see her parents again. Imagine how embarrassing it will be to start accepting this, and suddenly discover that two different versions of them are here, but that they never knew of her existence?”
"More than good," he heard himself say. "It's like I've taken ten years off my back and finally I could live for real.”
"Yes, we can," Steve said and the two started walking side by side in silence, towards to the entrance of the police station and the group of reporters. Just before they were noticed, Steve stopped, turning to look at Tony.
He threw the lube tube away and put the undersuit back on. Tony had no idea how long it had been since he started trying to get rid of that damn pollen, but he was exhausted. His arms were aching, his cock was extremely sensitive and Tony still felt like he was going to explode.
"I'm going to have a little talk with the Wizard of Oz, and tell him not to listen to your wishes, because you're very naughty, Tin Man."
Tony never took a shower so fast and so long in his life. As anxiety took over every cell in his body, he wanted to make sure that every piece of skin had been cleaned and no trace of the Furies was on him.
"I thought you might like to know that a certain blue-eyed super-soldier is extremely impatient because he didn’t get any calls from you wishing him a happy birthday."
“Four bullets,” Tony said quietly, unable to contain himself. Four shots that pierced Tony’s heart every time he watched that day’s footage. He had lost count of how many times he’d been hit by those four shots since returning from his own limbo. And how many times he’d cried until he had no more tears because he couldn’t prevent it from happening.
“All set,” he said, turning away, his heart breaking in a thousand pieces with the injustice of all that. Steve was bent over the girl he had brought by the hand, choking her in a hug while stroking her short blond hair and Tony could see that his husband was making the biggest effort in the world not to succumb to tears. The girl hugged Steve with the same intensity, but she trembled, her sobs audible above all the cacophony. Tony approached and Steve gently turned the girl towards him and, like magnets, the two clung together in a hug.
Steve sped up his motorcycle and was finally able to see Ares standing in the middle of a junction with a gigantic three-headed black dog and none of them seemed friendly.
“I’m going to show you,” Steve stroked Tony’s hair. “Every day, until the end, I will prove to you how much I love you and how much you deserve all the happiness.”
“Nanny from a box,” Tony mumbled as he typed the vault’s access code on the panel next to the door. “What don't we do to make Stephen Strange owe us a favor.” He leaned toward retinal recognition.
Taking a deep breath and letting the freezing air of that night enter his lungs, Tony turned the door handle that gave access to the apartment and entered, feeling the breath of hot air, bringing in the smell of coffee, clean clothes and the soap that Steve used. Tony let himself smell those scents for a second or two before entering the apartment completely and closing the door behind him.
Steve rested his head on Tony’s and they shared the same air. They kissed deeply and Tony allowed himself to enjoy the electricity running through his body. Steve’s lips were warm and soft, sticking Tony to the present, reaffirming that it looked like a dream, but incredibly it was happening. His body was a fortress. That body belonged to Tony’s love. Steve
The girl lifted her head and nodded, staring at the wall behind Natasha. Tony heard Steve gasp and fall into a chair.
That was supposed to be a calm day, like any other, in the life of the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes: fight some minor villains, but no less disgusting and annoying, nothing really troubling, leave the mess to Damage Control and go back to the Compound to continue the routine, until some real villain decided to dominate the world and give them some work to do.
“I could draw it all, you know?” Steve kept talking. “This pale and dull night, with nothing exciting going on. I know that most people would find this night boring. Apathetic.” Steve lowered his head and his gaze locked directly across the street, on the roof of the building opposite, the one with the chimney, right where Tony was trying to hide in the shadows. The display, was still with the zoom on Steve’s eyes before Tony could adjust his lenses and the view was breathtaking. Two blue circles, bright and alive, staring at him, seeing inside Tony, reading his thoughts, knowing his location, knowing his fear. Those eyes knew the way to Tony’s soul. They always knew, long before everything fell apart. They knew how to read every bit of Tony, every half-hearted smile, every half-truth, every joke made because he felt uncomfortable, every sincere conversation, every feeling. Well, maybe not all of them. Tony may have been able to hide a feeling, keep just a little bit of his own self to himself, a piece that Steve never managed to reach. And maybe that way was better for everyone. Especially for them. Steve blinked and Tony adjusted the lenses, framing his face again. Steve had one side of his mouth slightly pulled up, almost a smile, but still not sure if he could really let it out. “But most people are sleeping. So, what do they know about this night, am I right, Tony?”
He looked for the right pans, turned on the stove, put the potatoes to cook in one of the pots. Meanwhile, he started to prepare the fillets. The temptation to make just one serving for him was great, but he was not alone in that house. In fact,
Tony swallowed. But what was the point of hiding things? Steve would find out sooner or later. Let it be through Tony’s mouth, then. “They did,” Tony confirmed and saw Steve close his eyes, disappointed. It hurt. “Apparently, I manipulated some of the Civil War events and the Registration Act to increase the value of my companies’ shares and profit more from all of that. Sometime days before you went to trial, Ben Urich came to my office and told me that he had discovered everything with Peter’s help.”
Steve sighed. "I'm sorry about that. He doesn't usually behave like that," and headed for the kitchen.
"Lucky for you, I'm always two steps ahead of you. I've already called a lawyer. He should be at your place in fifteen minutes. He's coming from New York just to answer your case."
Tony still couldn’t get out of the entrance to the room. He was mesmerized. Steve was there, closer than he had been in the past few hours, in the past few months, moving, breathing.
A wave of pride floated over Tony's body as he thought, without false modesty, that expression of happiness was because of him.
"Friday, tell Natasha we're leaving," Tony said in a squeaky voice. He cleared his throat. "Tell her we're going to be these days without any kind of communication and that's her who’s going to take care of everything around here.”
As promised, Hercules came shortly afterwards to take Ares and the monsters back to the Greek world with promises to strengthen Tartarus's security and vigilance at Olympus, so that another such situation would not happen again.
“You're not helping, Doctor.” Steve said in an alert tone and Tony felt his heart warm up seeing Steve come to his defense.
Still, Tony didn’t know all those details because he watched the news broadcasting everything live, including his former friend being shot. No. He knows all the details because he watched the recordings of that day, from all the cameras available to him, from all angles, for several hours and days, exhaustively. Tony knew how to recite by heart the seconds in which each action had taken place. From everything he lost when his memory was erased, to prevent Norman Osborn from putting his disgusting hands on the records of the infamous Registration Act, which were, ironically, all in Tony’s brain, from every detail, of all the details, this piece, Steve's death because of that stupid fight, was what he made a point of re-recording.
"Okay. As long as you forget to call me Mr. Rogers. I earn about seventy years for every 'sir' you say," they both laughed. It was easy.
Tony put his hand to his mouth and sent a flying kiss in her direction as Steve hugged him by the shoulders. She was going to be fine, Tony thought, she was strong, intelligent and extremely powerful. Nothing could hurt her. Except for an incursion.
she interrupted him. "If this is all true, and you’re able to connect the dots in front of the jury, you solve the case and prove Peter's innocence."
? Nobody paid any attention to Tony when he worked. What mattered were the results, the cool toys that came out of his workshop. Nobody cared if Tony sang or not while making them. Well, nobody, except the one person who cared to check if Tony was okay, if Tony had eaten, if Tony had slept, if Tony had showered, and the only person who didn't mind spending hours quietly drawing, just to keep Tony company while Tony worked.
"Pepper, my dear, what do you have for me?" Tony asked, stepping out of the meeting room after giving a meaningful look to Steve, who turned red, behind Fury's back.
Sam approached the ship and forced the transparent lid down, which closed with a click. However, a single click was enough to detonate the chaos. As if waiting for the right moment as well, the young woman, who had hitherto been unconscious in the fountain, leaning on the stone ledge, rose in an incredibly agile jump to someone in that condition. She had her back to Natasha and was facing Clint and Vision, her fists clenched and in perfect strike position, her back straight and her breathing controlled.
Natasha blinked and let out the air she didn’t realize she was holding. All those things didn’t make much sense to her. Mechanical engineering and energy were Tony's specialty and unfortunately he wasn’t present. Tony's memory made Natasha scowl, because her memory failed her once again in trying to relate everything she was seeing. Was there a connection, or was she just tired?
“Shhh, it’s not your fault, Steve,” Tony smiled. “I needed to understand my grief. That was my mechanism. I stopped as soon as your imaginary voice told me it was disappointed,” Tony shook his head and laughed, remembering the moment. He looked back at Steve when he recovered. “But seriously, all those moments, all those nights, and then all those days, drinking to try to reach you, even if in an imaginary way, all that time going in the direction of my worst version, I should’ve realized right away that everything I was doing was simply because I needed you. But I was too numb to understand my own emotions.”
"To act." Tony said, opening the button on his coat. "And to try to get what I want." Without waiting for an answer from Steve, Tony turned and headed towards the stage, where Nat and Bruce were choosing the next song.
“Steve?” Tony's sleepy voice reached Steve’s ears, in the now strangely silent laboratory after the screams and moans of pleasure.
That was a bad time for a trip like that. At least four days just now that a super soldier had declared himself to him. Life was so unfair.
Your mouth!” Steve grabbed the hair on the back of Tony’s head, and lost control, thrusting his cock down Tony’s throat. “That feels so damn good.”
"...I always pay attention to what you do," Steve said and Tony noticed Steve's neck turning red. A shudder of satisfaction swept over Tony's spine, and he insisted on ignoring all six pairs of glances watching the scene. "Anyway, as I was saying, let's reverse it. Falcon and Iron Man take Hawkeye and Black Widow to the heads and hit the soft points of them: eyes, inner part of the mouth, ears, anything. Thor, Hulk and Spider-Man hit the legs and unbalance the hydra. Drop it and we'll send this thing back through the portal."
Tony told Steve that he could handle putting the box in the vault himself, and that Steve could go back to whatever he was doing before Strange arrived. Alone, and already out of his armor, Tony went straight to a room next to the lab, where the vaults were to store objects and weapons seized from the most diverse enemies of the Avengers. The Destroyer, lethal armor coming straight from Asgard, was one of the treasures kept there, after they defeated Loki and expelled him from inside the metallic monster - long history.
Sometime later, Steve quickly walked away to catch his breath and he smiled. “What’s it?” Tony asked, all disheveled and out of breath.
Liz tried to smile but eventually grimaced and Steve found himself finding it adorable. That couldn’t end like this.
“Let's go inside. It's already getting dark.” Tony watched the sunset over Steve's shoulder. The view from the Tower's roof was incredible, but Tony had other plans for Steve, and they needed to be inside, preferably in their room.
After all this time, Tony didn’t even have to look to know that Steve was around, they could talk with just one look and there was no one Tony would trust more. Sure, everyone else was Tony's family, people he loved and trusted, otherwise he would never have taken them all under his own roof and entrusted his life to them more than once. But with Steve it was different, another level, so to speak. And even being a genius, Tony couldn’t explain why, there was no way to name what Steve represented to him. And maybe that was better: their relationship was so special and unique that it didn’t even have a category.
"Well, it looks like we're not the only ones who are going to enjoy the weekend," Tony said. "Anyway, give her the message when they are
“When you land, I need you to send Bruce to the lab and you and Tony come straight to the interrogation room.”
Tony brought Steve closer, sticking their bodies together, and pressed his waist in Steve's, rubbing the two erections that were no longer concealed beneath the fabrics.
Also, some people asked me if I already watched the first episodes of Defending Jacob. Aaaand no. I haven't watched it yet because I don't want to be influenced by what happens in the series to write this story (although I already know what happens in the book). So, as soon as this story of mine ends, I'll be there to watch the series!
"With that one out of the way, maybe the other two would fall, too." Wanda's face brightened, as she understood.
“Thank you.” Steve smiled that smile that made his eyes narrow, making the corners crinkle. It was sincere.
"I didn't say anything." Steve said quietly, but Tony could hear that he was trying to hide his laughter.
When he finally turned around, Tony pulled the air so hard into his lungs that his chest hurt. It was the most beautiful sight Tony had ever seen ... in his life. Perhaps it overcame the day when the Avengers found Steve frozen in the Arctic. They weren’t friends that day, they didn’t know each other as they did now. This was different. Looking at Steve was like looking at the sun after hours in the dark. It hurt and it was glorious. It made Tony’s eyes sting, but he couldn’t look away even if someone forced him.
“They're all right,” Stark said, heading toward the front of the aircraft and sitting down next to Steve. “If anything had gone wrong, you bet we'd already know.”
It could only be a dream, right? An incredibly good dream, but put there by someone bad, who knew how much Tony wanted that happiness, but could
Tony smiled without showing his teeth as he remembered that day, a memory as clear as if it had happened hours earlier. “Because that’s still the best day of my life,” he looked at Steve. “We had no pretensions at all that day, nothing extraordinary should happen and, suddenly, we found that frozen man who, in the end, ended up being the hero of my childhood and youth,” the two exchanged smiles. “I’ll never stop feeling a secret pride for being the first person you spoke to when you woke up,” Tony fell silent as soon as he realized what he had said.
Steve didn’t like his birthday and Tony respected that. However, Tony also liked to make the soldier smile, make him happy. And he already knew how.
It had been a year since Thanos had come up with his plan to decimate half of the universe with the excuse of "balance." The Avengers, alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange and Captain Marvel, were able to defeat the Mad Titan and restore the life as if it was before his arrival - with a little help from the Infinity Gauntlet. That was why the Avengers had now returned to the Avengers Tower, but they had remained with all the memories, even the painful ones, and some modifications had been made in the team.
"We can use that to our advantage," Steve said, looking at the Avengers in front of him. "Will everyone here stay and fight?"
That was what Tony wanted to shout. That wasn’t possible. Steve remembered everything, right? No one had erased his memory.
But soon reality drifted through the gaps of that precious moment, and Tony found himself again in Steve’s apartment, still without part of his memory, still trying to understand what he was actually doing there, what Steve wanted with him, why they hadn’t started fighting yet. He blew out a heavy breath. He felt tired.
They were all settling into the Quinjet after a long, but not very serious, fight against the remotely controlled robots of Victor Von Doom, the ruler of Latveria known as Doctor Doom. No one was seriously injured, only with a few scratches and blows that soon would turn purple, and all covered with soot and dust from the rubble where the robots fell.
Tony breathed in Steve's neck again, intoxicating himself with that scent that was all Steve, and, out of control of his own actions, after all, control had already left Tony a long time ago, he licked the side of Steve's neck. He licked slowly, savoring the heat of Steve’s skin on his tongue.
Tony knew that was the time to leave for good, to leave and not look back. But he knew, Steve knew, and after the Civil War, the world knew:
“Tony?” Steve called. He tried hard not to call the engineer because he knew he needed to focus and the simple thought in Tony destabilized Steve. But he needed to hear Tony's voice, to know he was there.
“Well, even if the reality is incredible and everything, I hope we can repeat these dreams more often. Your fertile imagination is very inviting.”
"They moved out the city, but it was news that ran little through the school hallways. Jared left the athletics team, but we soon had a spring break and, on the way back, no one really missed him."
“Tomorrow,” Steve replied in a voice that was far, almost asleep and content. “We can shower together.”
"Hulk, the right leg is mine," Thor shouted cheerfully, striking a lightning bolt on the right foot of the hydra.
But what about Steve? How much did he remember since he was … since he died? Did he remember all the conversations, all the struggles, all the lies that seemed to be true? Did he remember every feeling, every pain, every betrayal, every stab? Did he still remember Tony?
The day passed without further surprises. The lunch prepared by Peter and Steve received rave reviews from everyone except Tony who didn’t come up for lunch and didn’t even show up in the communal area of the penthouse at any time of the day.
When Steve added a second finger and began scissoring, while kept sucking Tony's balls and cock, all covered with precome, their eyes met.
Tony came closer, pressing his body even harder against Steve’s, wanting more, needing more, when Steve backed away slightly, sucking in the air like a drowning man. He looked at Tony strangely, his eyes fixed on his lips and, unconsciously, Tony slid his tongue to wet them. Later, Tony would swear that he could see Steve’s pupils widen. But at that moment, all he could feel was the thousands of restless butterflies fluttering in his stomach. Tony looked at Steve through his lashes and swallowed when his strong, capable fingers found the tight muscles at the base of his neck and began to massage them carefully. Such a small contact, but that, once again, generated an instant and addictive heat. It was as much as Tony could handle before their mouths fixed on each other again. Tony gasped and couldn’t suppress a groan when Steve’s tongue traced the sensitive curve of his upper lip.
“Come here.” Steve Rogers, who would say, had the softest embrace in the world. No one could imagine that the all-powerful Captain America could be so delicate and capable of so much tenderness. Tony allowed himself to melt in Steve's arms for only a few seconds before sniffing and wiping away his tears.
Around him, the other Avengers began to wake up to the sound and immediately stand up, but they all stopped when they saw Tony and Steve. More precisely, where Tony was sitting and where Steve's hands were.
Steve felt his face getting hot. "Only when I really want something." They were both silent, watching the Boston landscape pass through the car windows.
"A full house, too," Steve said, showing his cards. "But smaller than yours." A pair of twos and three threes.
In recent days, since the mission in Alaska, Tony had been thinking a lot about his relationship with Steve since they met and he’d realized that he’d never related to others as he relates to Steve. He never reacted to others as he reacts to Steve. And unconsciously, during all this time, he neglected all these effects, but something has changed. Steve has changed, although Tony doesn’t know why. How could that phrase have come from Steve's mouth, but not from his mouth?
How far would the absurdities go in their lives? Was there a limit they hadn’t yet reached? Or had they already gone beyond the absurd line long ago?
Tony's arms slid down Steve's legs, mapping every muscle, every contour, until his hands found their way to his cock. Steve let out a groan. “Here,” Tony showed Steve his open palm. “Make it wet for me.”
“Dr. Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four are off the planet at the moment. You are my last resort.”
The afterwards scared him more than turning on the armor and leaving the hiding place. What would he say? Would he start by saying something or would Steve speak first? What would Steve say? Would Tony get hurt, no matter what? Was he prepared to take more pain?
Tony realized that Steve was thoughtful, lost in his own ideas, while preparing ... well, while preparing whatever it was. But he couldn't bear to stay in a house with two introspective people. As Peter had said, Steve needed to talk. And Tony loved to talk. Well, only with those who suited him. And Steve was someone who suited him a lot.
"Do not worry, Thor," Vision said, dangerously approaching from the rear of the ship. "Besides, I already have a look at the whole situation.”
What Steve knew was that now he needed to be much more than an Avenger, much more than a leader, much more than a soldier. He would have to be a father and no one gets ready for it in half an hour.
“Very well.” Tony took a sip of coffee, leaned back on the bench and crossed his arms, without taking his eyes off Steve. Since they had arrived until that moment, the one Tony was so afraid of, what was the reason for not looking Steve in the eye? “Just before you died, I was appointed Director of SHIELD and was in control of the information of the Superhero Registration Act. After all, I thought that if there was someone reliable enough at that moment to have access to that information, it was me. Then, you were killed.” Tony took another sip of coffee. Steve’s expression was neutral, giving away absolutely nothing. “Nobody was expecting that to happen. You were going to trial for treason, most people agreed that you were a criminal. But then, it was as if those shots that hit you had broken an evil spell, and they all came out of the dome inside which they hid during our fight. They remembered who you were. People came to think that perhaps your side in the Civil War wasn’t as wrong as they thought. And then, they remembered about me and what I stood for all that time. People started to
“No,” the girl replied quietly. “I was the only survivor. My father's intention was to build a ship large enough to save our entire family, but the incursion arrived much before his calculations had predicted” she stopped and laughed. “It was the first and only time I saw my father miss a calculation. So he modified the ship enough that at least I could be saved. It was a very quick discussion and I guess I've never seen my parents agree so fast on anything.”
Steve was silent, just watching Tony, his face no longer as friendly as before. Tony had screwed everything up, of course. But Steve deserved to know everything. Tony had already lost Steve once, he had some memory missing, and he had no friends. What else did he have to lose? When it became clear that Steve would let him continue, Tony took another sip of coffee and took a breath.
"Yes, my son has some friends. Let's see," Steve started counting on his fingers. "There's Ned, the smart kid, Peter's best friend. He's always around here with Peter. There's also MJ, who is a friend slash girlfriend, but neither she nor Peter have realized it yet," Steve chuckled. "Well, and then there are my friends who are friends of his, too."
"Hi," it was hardly a sigh, a whisper, but the eyes that stared at him shrank in the corners and shone beautifully. A smile. That was a smile. Steve searched his mouth and found white, aligned teeth appearing, framed by full, happy lips.
“Four bullets,” Tony said quietly, unable to contain himself. Four shots that pierced Tony’s heart every time he watched that day’s footage. He had lost count of how many times he’d been hit by those four shots since returning from his own limbo. And how many times he’d cried until he had no more tears because he couldn’t prevent it from happening.
"So I found out that we have someone forging evidences in the police. And Rhodes is the only one there that we can trust."
"Thank you," the other smiled and took a sip of his coffee, regardless of the temperature. "It's great."
"Ah, Steve," Tony smirked. "Nowadays, your sexuality is more important than your social security number," Tony drank the rest of the wine he still had in his glass, put the glass in the dishwasher and turned to Steve. "I loved talking to you Steve. And thanks, again, for letting me stay here. Good night."
“Have you already realized that no matter what situation we are in, at one time or another, we always end up alone with each other?”
“Captain Rogers?” Jarvis called. “My analysis show that all the hormones that indicated the presence of sex-pollen in the sir’s body have returned to their normal levels or, when in the case of substances not known to man, have disappeared. And his limbic system is visible again. Apparently, the
"Hey," Tony said. "Everything's going to be all right. We'll get him out of there. Your son will be coming home. I promise."
Leaving his nipples, Tony kept coming down with his mouth by Steve’s body drawn to perfection and stopped when it reached just below the navel.
“It was probably the most painful scene I have ever seen. And look, I already had my share of painful scenes to fill about three lives.” Steve tried to make a joke, but his eyes staring at his hands that writhed nervously betrayed him. “I heard everything, over and over, until I memorized every word,” Steve said and Tony swallowed a gasp. “Now I know your reasons, your meeting with Arthur, your vision, that, even in the middle of the whole war you never drank once - and that made me
"It's just not as amazing as seeing two fucking Furies whirlwinds unconscious to the ground," Clint said, laughing.
Tony moved until the two found their own pace, intense and panting, with the room being filled with the sounds of groans, screams, and skin to skin on every thrust of Tony in Steve. Steve grabbed Tony's ass and kept that rhythm up, until Tony hold Steve’s cock with one of his hands, and started moving up and down.
Peter took off his sunglasses, folded his hands on his lap and sighed. "Everything’s been crazy, Mr. Stark. I woke up yesterday morning, went to school, met my friends and went to class like every day. I had even arranged with Ned to put together a Death Star lego set after class. It was gonna be incredible. But then in the break of the second class, our director came to my classroom and asked me to go with him. There was already a cop beside him. I didn’t know what was happening, but I went anyway. When I arrived at the principal's office, a guy that said he was a detective said I was going to jail for the murder of Jared Wolmur, a boy I knew only by name, because he was from the school athletics team," Peter stopped to take a breath. The words stumbled out of him, and he spoke quickly, as if his reasoning was too fast for his mouth to follow. Tony understood perfectly and that made him feel a connection with the boy. They were similar in a way. "But I could
"Yes, I'm sorry. I know you didn't expect to see me yesterday at the police station and I didn't expect to see you there either, especially as the detective in charge of my case," Tony was interrupted by the arrival of the waitress, who brought a cappuccino to Rhodes and the double espresso for him. After she left, Tony took a sip of his coffee -
Tony wanted to tell him that he was happy to see him there, to have him there with Tony, but Tony had lost the ability to form coherent phrases. The only word he knew was Steve. The only scent was Steve. His favorite color was Steve. His world was there and it was Steve. And Tony's body was his moon, orbiting around, being drawn to him, needing to be close, glued, preferably with Steve's hands around him.
“Friday caught extremely strong, unusual, and sudden energy signals at Lincoln Center just minutes ago.”
And. I. Don’t. Remember.” Tony covered his face with his hands and tried to take a deep breath, but the air just didn’t find the right way for his lungs. He felt his hands heat up and get wet.
"Rhodey, as far as we know we have a corrupt cop in there forging evidence and trying to frame a sixteen-year-old boy for murder. So I don't trust Ross and anyone else in there, and I don't know how far I can ask them for things," Tony made his best lost puppy face. "I only got you, Rhodey."
“What if they weren’t?” Tony said, “What if my other self programmed your ship to travel much more than randomly through the multiverse? What if he scheduled your ship to land here, where he knew you would find an Earth like yours, with versions of your parents that would love you as deeply as they did?” He shrugged. “That's what
Steve blew out a breath, defeated. “I wanted to make sure that when you woke up, I wouldn’t lose you again.”
“But I was just kidding myself. I should’ve realized that everything was going downhill when every time we tried to talk it all went wrong, either it was never the right time, or it was just a mixture of those two factors.”
Tony shook his head. He didn’t know how he would react to Steve so close after all this time, even if only a few weeks had passed for him and not more than an entire year.
"Now, now, good morning, Rhodey, my dear," Tony greeted with a petulant smile. "For how long did you think you could avoid me?"
Tony sighed, admitting defeat. There was no use trying to postpone for much more. “What do you remember from before you died?”
Looking at it like that, it seems that Tony was there that day, witnessing everything up close, in order to remember so many details. Unfortunately, that day, he was being too stupid, too arrogant, too stubborn and too afraid to leave the SHIELD helicarrier to face his friend. No. Scratch that. To face his ex-friend on his way to his trial for treason. At that time, Tony was becoming familiar with the position of director of SHIELD and being too cool as the leader of the winning side to bother to go to the trial. Besides, it would be too much cowardice to rub his victory in Steve’s face at a time like that, right?
"Of course," Ross looked as if he had been shocked because he started to move, rummaging through the piles of papers and files on his desk, until he found a specific one, not too thick, and handed it to Tony. "Here it is. It's a copy. You can take it with you," Ross smiled without showing his teeth. "Courtesy of the house."
"I promised a weekend without communication with the rest of the world, but we're still in a house of mine, so I can’t promise zero technology, sweetheart.”
Steve smiled. “I said I'd love to hear you sing. I never imagined that I'd hear you say that you loved me while singing.”
"Isn’t it amazing that reality is better than a dream?" Tony snuggled back into the crook of Steve's arm.
He heard her sigh again. "You will hear all of this again from the Chief's mouth, but probably not in a nice way or with the right details. So, you better know by someone who cares about you and Peter. And know that I would rather be having this conversation in person. Talking on the phone sucks."
“I’ll be there with you,” Tony said, opening a shy smile. “I always had hope that you’d come back. But I never thought you would be able to make me confess that I’d do anything for you, that I’d give my heart to you, even though I didn’t think I deserve your love back.”
“The point is,” Tony was startled by the interruption of Steve's voice on the communicator. “What does this weapon do?”
Tony still didn’t feel worthy of that love. Steve Rogers loving Tony? It seemed too good to be true, but Tony could believe Steve. Steve would never lie to him, not after they agreed that it wasn’t worth hiding things from each other. In addition, they have always worked better together. Imagine if they were really together? All Tony’s dreams coming true? Too good to be true, but apparently it was.
Tony pressed a few buttons and the microwave came alive, heating the plate. A few seconds later, Tony was sitting on the counter beside a glass of water, with the plate in one hand, a fork in the other, and eating as if there were no tomorrow.
The back ramp opened with a hiss and Wanda and Peter went down first, chatting excitedly about which movie would be best for the weekend session, with Steve, Tony and Bruce right behind.
“Hey! That was mean, Strange!” Tony shouted at where the portal was. He grunted. “This was all very bizarre.”
Tony's smile grew. "You know, I hadn't come over here to speak to you specifically, but since you appeared so kindly in front of me, I need to talk to you."
Tony took another sip of his coffee. "I know that your son is being accused of killing a schoolmate and that he's being held in custody right now."
“Steve!” Tony shouted, catching the Captain's attention, which only had time to lift his shield above his head before Tony held him at the last moment. With the impact of hydra’s foot on the ground, they were thrown to the intersection of the 5th with the 23rd and fell in the middle of the traffic, forcing the vehicles to turn aside abruptly.
Natasha also called and stayed in the game. Without showing any emotion, the spy again discarded the first card in the deck and opened another card in the center of the table, a jack of clubs, starting a new round.
“No, my love. You can't come yet.” With one last stroke, Steve released both dicks. He held Tony's face in his hands, who was looking back at him without understanding why that pleasure had been denied. Steve smiled as lovingly as he could and kissed Tony deeply, who returned it willingly. When they pulled back to breathe, Steve was still smiling. “Breathe.” Tony took a deep breath. “Good. We’re in a hurry, I know, but I also want you to enjoy it. And I'll take care of everything to make it so. I'll take care of you.”
It took me a long time, but I finally got to finish what became the last chapter. It took longer than I planned because I couldn't find an ending that suited me and that lived up to the story as I believe it deserved. Now I finally got it and the time of year couldn't be better.
Before Bruce could protest, Nat dragged him to the stage, leaving Clint and Thor talking animatedly about the next selection of songs, which certainly had to be just duets, if not, what was the purpose of going there, and Steve and Tony. Tony filled his glass with more sake and finished it in three sips. As he refilled the glass, he could feel Steve's gaze burning on his skin.
thinking. Relax. I know you don’t enjoy your birthday. What do you think I am? An insensitive playboy?”
“The two of us, together,” Tony kissed Steve. “And I will never feel lonely again, because you will be there, walking this path with me, beside me, won’t you?”
"Hulk, hold this here." Peter gave the tip of the web for the Hulk. "Now throw me around the animal's legs.”
"We can..." Steve began reluctantly after a few seconds. "We can serve as father figures if you want, Peter.”
"He, Sam, and Thor are out for a mission,” Tony could almost see Natasha’s shrugged. “Unidentified energy signatures upstate.”
“I’m sorry, Tony.” And Tony knew that Steve was telling the truth in each of those words. So, he came over and kissed him slowly, to show how much Steve’s truth meant to him. As Tony stepped back, he took a deep breath because he wasn’t done yet. He needed Steve to hear everything.
“Remind me not to do it again without a nice sound-isolator on. My head is exploding,” Tony's voice appeared on the comms, and Steve let out his breath. “Of course the pun was intentional.”
"Our intelligence has information that the bomb you destroyed in Alaska wasn’t the only one they had. In fact...”
Tony finished his own slice and got up to get one more. On his way, he realized that Thor, Peter and Hulk
, Jarvis.” Tony sighed and looked at his reflection on the surface of his workbench, and wondered what Steve would think if he saw him in that way: messy hair stuck to his sweaty forehead, body dump with sweat; fast breathing, dilated pupils and red face; oh, and the icing on the cake: the most embarrassing and unreasonable erection of all.
“Depending on the day, their intensity changed. If we had spent the day together, in my dreams I would take you to the bedroom and sometimes we would just kiss, other times we would make love. But if some fight had taken place that day, the dream was always more intense.”
If it were possible, Tony's heart would already have come out of his chest so fast it was beating and Tony had lost track of everything around. He just felt Steve's body glued to his, Steve's hands trailing behind his back possessively and Steve's mouth reaching into his ear once more to tear a groan out of him as Steve bit his ear lobe and smiled.
Steve almost ran out of breath, but then Tony started slowing down, and they went back to more of a steady speed. Tony bent and leaned on Steve's thighs, letting his cock bounce free in Steve’s face. He ran his ass in kind of a circular motion, clenching his hole all the while, and Steve could feel his dick exploring his insides. “
"Lucky us, you're hotter than the rat," Tony said and, to his horror, Steve chose that moment to get up and make Tony realize that he had said it out loud. In a loud and dreamy voice. Tony was wide-eyed and Steve was as red as the tomatoes he had sliced moments before.
” Tony gave a sad little smile. “In the middle of it all, we had your funeral and discovered a large-scale Skrull infiltration into Earth, being led by Spider-Woman who, we ended up discovering to be the Skrull Queen infiltrated long ago among us.”
“Shouldn’t we clean up?” Tony asked, not really wanting to know, because he was amazed at the discovery of how perfectly he fit the curve of Steve’s neck, as if that place had been made for him.
The two of them turned away and looked at the plate on the tray, where eggs and slices of bacon lay forgotten and looking deplorable. Tony moaned in frustration. His food had been
Steve took a deep breath before putting his mouth on his and Tony was surprised for a second, amazed by the burning strength of his lips. Then his libido reached his brain and Tony tiptoed up, clasping his hand on Steve’s neck, returning the kiss with everything he had been holding inside him all that time, all the pain of having lost Steve, for never having the courage to say how much he loved him before, to have gone to war against the person he loved the most, to have hit rock bottom, to finally be able to surrender to Steve with all of his soul, and finally to feel Steve’s sweet and intoxicating taste on his tongue, which danced and explored alongside Steve’s, as if they already knew each other and needed to make up for all the lost time away from each other.
"The signature of energy is coming from both the ship and the girl." Vision lifted his head to look in the direction Thor was.
With a superhuman effort, Tony broke away from Steve and walked away. “Forgive me, Steve,” he said, stumbling over his own words and feet as he walked backwards towards the corridor he had entered. “Forgive me, really.”
Huh. The conversation was taking a totally unexpected turn, but one that Tony liked. "The second reason that made me want to come and get you alone was because I wanted to know your side of the story. Tell me, Peter, what's going on?"
Steve approached for another slice of pizza, but didn’t move away. Instead, he kept his eyes on Tony.
Tony lowered his cup, which was getting dangerously empty. “I’m already getting there. Well, it obviously didn’t take long for Osborn to realize that SHIELD, now HAMMER, didn’t have the Records he wanted so badly, and there wasn’t a single backup in any corner of this Earth. But then, he reminded us of why we shouldn’t underestimate Norman Osborn,” Tony sighed heavily, thinking that it was from that moment that, in fact, nothing would ever be the same again. “He remembered that there was, indeed, one last backup of the Records.”
He took a deep breath and tried to change the focus of his thoughts. His gaze ended somewhere in the back of the lab. “I got intoxicated by sex-pollen.” With the revelation seized by Tony's brain, his stomach turned to the wrong side and he felt like throwing up.
The reason for such boredom were A.I.M. agents who tried, in vain, to stop them from invading one of their bases in Alaska. Clint snorted.
“So, you have my records from the moment I smelled that flower. Was I also infected like Tony?” Steve looked back at Tony, who frowned, not getting the point.
Tony couldn’t move. The shadows of that chimney were now his fortress and he wasn’t ready to go out and face the dragon, even if the dragon was the one that Tony had wanted to see the most in recent months.
Tony lay down on the floor again, and instinctively, his hand reached for his bulge and stroked it, even though he knew it would do no good. The problem was knowing that Steve was so close. The mere mention of his name rekindled Tony's desire in intense ways.
Wiping the sweat off his face, Tony opened the latch on the box and there it was. The flower. The red lily with its petals incredibly red as rubies.
“They now have a new leader, the Scientist Supreme,” Tony flew above them, firing their repulsors at a group of agents dressed in yellow. “According to S.H.I.E.L.D. he designed a new weapon with technology stolen from various sources and we still don’t know all that it can do.”
"Maybe later," Tony brought Steve closer with his legs, took the bottle from his hands and hugged him by the neck. "I have other plans now.”
“Hulk?” Steve called, and immediately the huge avenger punched the door, sending it across the room, and it turned out to be a large shed, full with agents dressed in yellow sheltering protectively around a lighted structure in the center of the room, and who were already waiting for the heroes, wielding their weapons.
Tony made an indignant noise with his mouth. "How absurd. Just because I prefer motorized vehicles it doesn't mean that I'm aversed to walking," Rhodes raised an eyebrow at him. Tony winced. "I'm going to make the sacrifice, but let it be recorded in the annals of posterity that I was against going by walking. I feel personally attacked."
“It wasn’t worth it,” they both said at the same time. Steve smiled a little, like when you share a secret. A second-hand memory flashed in Tony’s head. A footage.
“You look beautiful in my shirt,” Steve looked Tony up and down, warming up Tony’s entire body in the process. Tony already felt that his boiling point was close. He shrugged, pretending nonchalance. “It was the first thing I found thrown around the room. I thought you wouldn’t mind if I borrowed it.”
“Thanks, J. But I’ll try to handle it myself, don’t worry.” Tony crawled over to a small cabinet with drawers, trying to ignore the friction between his dick and the floor, and how good and how torturing it felt, and opened the first drawer. From there he took a tube of lube and some tissues. He sat down, leaned on his workbench, and unzipped his undersuit enough to free his cock. The breath of icy lab air on his hot skin made Tony shiver, but it reminded him of why he needed to finish that soon.
Tony took a sip of coffee and continued looking outside without really seeing. He found himself thinking about what Steve had said about that being a new start for both of them. What were the chances, after all, of both of them having gone through near-death experiences and returning to live, with all the reasons why such experiences were linked to them having almost succeeded in killing each other because they were too stupid to admit that they never hated each other, but actually that they have always loved each other? Tony laughed through his nose and took another sip of his coffee.
Tony came over and kissed Steve passionately, grabbing him, rubbing their bodies and their dicks, taking Steve's every moan and sigh, making it look like his arms had multiplied to be on every piece of Steve's exposed skin at the same time. One of those arms managed, at some point during this make out session, to find a tube of lube - the same one Tony had thrown away when he’d tried to give himself a handjob. Tony showed the lube to Steve.
Tony held up his hands. “Start from the beginning. What the hell are you talking about, what do you mean Pepper called
"You may not have won the poker bet," Tony said, looking deep into Steve's eyes. "But I wanted to give you a gift for being so patient all these years, for loving me for so long and never giving up on me. On us." He smiled and pointed at the card. "What do you say? We leave tomorrow. Will you come?”
"Your son is on trial for the murder of that boy, Steve," Tony said without emotion, but his eyes betrayed him. They were filled with pity. And compassion.
“Hardest for whom?” Natasha asked with a smirk, punching the Scientist Supreme, making him faint. She looked at Tony. “Your turn, genius.”
he thought, and that made no sense, but oh, his body liked that thought very much. Even with all his limbs numb, Tony felt a surge of energy that made his heart race and his brain bring from the most hidden places, images and fantasies that Tony had long hidden about the supersoldier. To his surprise and horror, a groan escaped his lips as he imagined Steve
Natasha walked slowly around the fountain, glancing briefly toward Clint to see him sitting with Sam bandaging his shoulder.
Rhodes tried to look away, to pretend that Tony's gaze didn’t influence him, but in the end, his shoulders fell and Tony knew he had succeeded. "
“There are several versions of us and Earth scattered in different dimensions. My father explained to me that each dimension is as if it were a single universe, closed in on itself, and does not necessarily know the existence of the other versions." She shrugged. "We knew, but I guess you didn’t, right?”
Natasha was about to start the next round when Tony's cell phone vibrated in his pocket. He picked up the phone and saw Happy's photo on the display.
, Tony snorted at his own thoughts. Of course, he needed to worry about Steve. Steve seemed to be strong, unstoppable, always ready for anything, but the truth was that he needed a port to return to, a north to guide him. Tony knew that. He knew that Steve was needing to establish himself at that moment, because something had taken from him everything that Steve was sure of. Tony just wasn’t sure how to help, or what Steve’s words meant.
“And she's the best version of us both.” He leaned over and kissed Tony in a mixture of apprehension and happiness.
"I just want you and him to know that I don’t care at all. I think it's great, actually, that the two of you have finally solved this unresolved sexual tension.”
Tony smirked, noticing the change in subject, but let it go. “Yes, he did. He wanted the Superhuman Records that were being held by SHIELD.” Tony saw Steve’s eyes widen and raised his hands, calming him. “That’s why I said at the beginning that, when I accepted to be Director of SHIELD, I believed that I was the best option at that time for the position. I wouldn’t do anything that shouldn’t be done with those Records. So, before handing over the house keys to Osborn, I deleted the entire SHIELD database that contained the Records, including the backups.” Tony smiled smugly.
“Did you find anything interesting that I should know?” Steve asked after a few minutes. His voice was amused.
“I should’ve known when it was time to stop all that nonsense when all I could think about was you, if you were okay, if you were eating, if you were sleeping.” Steve paused. “If you could still smile in the middle of that madness.”
"After I bought this island and built this house," Tony began, "I realized it wasn’t a place to bring any person." Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair, who closed his eyes and made a noise of pleasure. “It wasn’t the place to have a party for friends and even less a place for one night stands” Tony paused. “I realized that it was a special place and that I would only bring here who really was important, who really was worth it.” Steve opened his eyes and they faced each other. “I would only bring here someone I
Tony went to the other side of the room and found the huge king-size bed, neatly arranged, with his small suitcase beside it and smiled. He took off his shoes, his jacket, his shirt and pants, getting in his boxer brief and threw himself on the bed.
Tony was startled. He took too long; he was too slow and now Steve was there. He didn’t turn around, but he was alert, paying attention to the sounds Steve was making, deliberately loud, so Tony would know where he was, what he was doing, where he was going. They both knew that if Steve wanted to, he could be quieter than a shadow.
That hurt. Tony didn’t think he could feel anything anymore, but he found he could underestimate his own feelings when it came to Steve.
feel, I need to remember to know why I’m ashamed, why I’m feeling guilty, why I’m afraid to be here.”
"It's a very big animal and full of conflicting thoughts," she said, her voice flawed. "Making him sleep drained me a lot of energy.”
"Great," Tony said, opening the first box and taking a very well topped slice and taking a bite. He groaned. "It's perfect.”
For a long time, Tony simply lay there, just feeling Steve’s body against his, his warmth, listening to his heartbeat, his steady breathing, indicating that he had fallen asleep. At some point, he started to think that maybe that could really be his life from now on. Then, with that thought warmed by Steve’s arms and love, Tony fell asleep entwined with the love of his life.
“I know you’re there,” Steve said, still in a low voice, as if to prove that he knew Tony had the means to listen to him. “And you’re dying to know how I know,” and the jackass smirked, knowing exactly what Tony was thinking.
“And you haven't opened the box?” Strange raised an eyebrow and looked first at Tony and then at Steve.
“Talking to you was like waking up in a dream,” Steve said. “You were still wearing the armor, that old one.”
Tony leaned over Steve, deepening the kiss, thrusting his tongue deeper and deeper, exploring every bit of Steve as he felt the soldier's hands on his thighs, squeezing and encouraging.
They passed Natasha, who closed the door behind them, leaving the signal clear: there was no turning back. They stopped in front of the interrogation room door and hesitated.
Steve must have made an expression of extreme defeat, because Tony took off his glasses and looked at him. The softness had returned and Steve's stomach twisted, but not in the nauseating way it had before. It was ... different. A good different. "If you answer their questions now, as much as you want to help your son, it'll do more harm than good. We know little yet. I said I'm here to help. Helping in this context also means advising. Follow my advice: get out of the car with your head held high, with the best Captain posture you can do, and pretend they’re not there. Don’t make eye contact, don’t talk to them, focus on your goal, which is go inside that police station to see your son. Did you understand?"
Steve gave a sad little smile, as if he expected something else. “Me too,” he took a sip of coffee and composed himself. “And what happened to
Fireworks of every color and shape illuminated the sky outside the Tower, enchanting everyone, who rushed to the windows to admire the spectacle.
“Tony, what happened?” Steve scanned Tony's face, looking for something he could work with. “My God, Tony, you're burning!” And it was then that Steve, in an attempt to get a better feel for Tony's temperature, held his face, which fit perfectly into Steve's hand. With a sigh of relief, Tony tilted his head, snuggling there.
“We're here!” Steve announced, and they all held together, while the Quinjet was heading down toward the hangar.
Steve’s hands came to life and hugged Tony around the waist, but soon they went through everything they managed to reach, until he reached the hem of his own shirt that Tony was wearing and pulled it up, leaving Tony gloriously naked, but now under a completely new and hypnotic light. Steve slowed his own movements and Tony imitated him, until they were with their heads resting on each other, breathing hard, unable to look away from each other.
Tony opened his eyes, but he had to blink a few times to make sure he was really wide-eyed because there was no light around. He moved and immediately smiled when he felt his body awake and realized that his legs were curled into other legs, that he was protected inside strong arms and that the heat he felt came from no blanket because he was completely naked, but of the other body to which he was glued. Steve's body, sleeping soundly beside him.
But was it possible? Tony snorted mentally at the absurdity. No, it wasn’t. Someone certainly should’ve already told Steve what had happened to Tony after his death, right? He knew about the funeral; he even knew it had been Tony’s idea. How could he not know about the memory loss? But there was only one way to confirm whether Steve knew or not.
felt all this oxytocin for Steve, I just never allowed myself to feel for real, and now that I can, I never want to deprive myself of the sensation.”
“You were one of the most bizarre things that happened today.” Tony said to the box, as he pulled up a chair to sit down. “You were more bizarre than Strange showing up here asking for a favor, and that says
Then Tony felt wrapped in a pair of arms, which wrapped around him knowing that they wouldn’t be pushed aside. On the contrary, they were very necessary. It was a warm, soft and firm haven, able to protect him from all dangers, even those that Tony created for himself, steadying him to reality, bringing him back, comforting him. He didn’t deserve that. The smell of clean clothes and Steve, the scent that only he had, permeated Tony’s senses, making him dizzy, thirsty and with a racing heart. He was hyper alert, about to explode, and having such a concentrated dose of Steve at that moment could lead to unexpected and dangerous reactions.
"It's not a five-star hotel," Steve said, apologizing. "But it's comfortable, the kitchen is right next door and you can have your privacy," he shrugged. "Peter's friends usually sleep here when they come for the weekend," Steve had a wan smile, his eyes glassy, as if he were reliving a memory. But the moment passed and he quickly composed himself.
Tony swallowed. He remembered everything, then. Well, Tony was never good at hoping. He was never the optimist. That role has always been Steve’s. Tony snorted.
“If they are as good leaders as my parents were in leading the Avengers of my Earth, I'm sure we'll get along.” She smiled.
, that I couldn’t do it.” Steve put his hand behind his head and scratched the back of it, as if he were suddenly uncomfortable. He sighed, looked up, and looked again a few inches to the left of where Tony really was. “We need to talk.”
Tony blinked, returning to the present, finding Steve looking at him expectantly and with an amused look. “Sorry, I was just, well, you know, thinking.”
"I did," Tony took a quick look at the graffiti Steve was finishing cleaning when he and Peter arrived. The ER letters were still visible. Tony blew out a heavy breath. "That's why I think you should go in. There's more where that came from. This is just the beginning," and seeing the panic in Peter's eyes, Tony moved closer, speaking quietly, as if they were being watched. "For this to end as soon as possible and for you to get back to your normal life, we need to move," Tony looked at Steve, who nodded.
Tony was unable to contain his disappointment. His disbelief made him come back to his senses. He was expecting some magic herb, a frog leg, maybe. Strange said it would be for a potion, right? And that it was extremely powerful or something. That lone flower resting inside the box didn’t fit a sorcerer’s potion ingredient requirements. It was beautiful, Tony admitted. The red lily, which Tony saw only a few times in his life, had each of its six petals tinged with the purest bright red -
Tony swallowed. Certainly, Steve could talk more, couldn’t he? Tony thought about what he could say to postpone that part of the conversation. He wasn’t ready.
Steve’s smile grew. “It’s just you and me here.” Steve put a hand behind Tony’s neck, and began to massage the sudden knots. Tony closed his eyes and groaned softly. That was wonderful. “Stop thinking and focus on just the two of us.” Did Steve’s voice seem more distant or was it an impression?
"No. I want it to be a surprise. A way to make up for not getting it before," Tony shrugged and stood up.
looking through the same lenses, Tony's racing heart wasn’t so unheard of. Maybe it's happened a lot more than Tony had ever realized.
Steve continued to cut the eggplant into slices and after finishing, and placing the slices in a bowl, he took an Italian zucchini and started the same process again. "Steve," Tony said, as he watched, mesmerized, at Steve's work. "Peter knows you’re here if and when he needs it. But he needs time to process what’s going on."
Tony took Steve’s outstretched hand, who wasted no time, and pulled him close, holding his waist with his free hand, holding him in his embrace, as if he were afraid that Tony would try to run away again. Tony crossed his arms around Steve’s neck. They both smiled.
Steve blew out audibly. “Thank God, Tony. You worried me,” but he frowned. “But that doesn’t explain why you just remember things that happened over a year ago.”
"She told me that I should take good care of you or I would regret it," Tony said with a raised eyebrow. Steve laughed through his nose, but felt his heart double in size for Natasha.
Steve looked at Stephen Strange and his face was red under his helmet. Tony was sure he was sweating more with every half-truth. Because, no, Captain America never lied. “Yes. Sure. We ... hmmm, we have a meeting now, sweetie.”
To Tony's luck, the next twelve hours passed quickly, and at exactly eight o'clock in the morning he was signing the two-hundred-million-dollar contract for renewable energy projects for Stark Industries and half an hour later, he was already taking off to New York with his heart leaping.
It took Steve a few moments to look away from Tony’s perfection to look him in the eye, two pieces of the blue sky of the most perfect summer day, bright, smart, intelligent, scathing, quick, analytical, benevolent and able to express so much love. Tony was incredible, the owner of all the best adjectives that the languages that Steve knew had. He finally focused on the present.
was what Natasha was compelled to ask, but once again her memory deceived her. She was asking herself the wrong questions, wasn’t she?
He turned. Steve smiled crookedly at him and had one hand extended toward him. Tony held it and the soldier pulled him into a hug.
However, we are talking about the Avengers, also known as “those for whom Murphy's Law was created.” If something could get out of control that was certainly what would happen.
"Here's the access card to your room," the man said, handing him a magnetic card. "Your bags are already in the room. We prepared the presidential suite for your stay and the meeting room for tomorrow at five in the afternoon, as requested.”
A shiver went up Tony's back. The elevator might not be the best place to be extremely horny in the company of the reason for such excitement.
The thought hurt. Imagining his life without Steve, with him dead, knowing he would never return, was one thing. Tony would suffer, but eventually he would learn to deal with pain and longing. But imagining his life with Steve alive, but ignoring him completely, despising him, never wanting to get close to Tony again after everything that happened? Tony couldn’t take it.
“You must be extremely important for Strange to decide to ask for help.” Tony looked at the box, hands on his hips. “I can't deny that you’re very beautiful though.” He crouched down again, and stroked the lid of the box, touching the embossed runes, until his fingers reached the latch that kept the box closed. Tony was overcome with an urgent need to know what was inside. It wasn't a simple curiosity, it was a deep, almost painful desire.
"I love you," Steve said. “That whole conversation about waiting that is worthwhile? How long do you think I’ve been waiting to tell you this?"
You are the reason why I survived, even when I thought I had lost you, because I knew I’d find you somewhere. You are why and wherefore I exist. You are the one I will take care of, no matter the difficulties.
Tony laughed mentally. He had millions of things he wanted to shout for the world to hear, but he just couldn’t find the right words. He wanted to be able to rip his heart out of his chest and show it to Steve. It would be more effective, mistake and misinterpretation proof, of lack of words good enough.
” Tony turned his face away and cringed, hugging his knees, even though the position was extremely uncomfortable.
As they headed for the police station, Tony stood on the phone with a person named Pepper, explaining Peter's whole situation, and trying to get her to help straight from Tony's office in New York. Steve tried to keep silent as much as he succeeded in, just paying attention to the conversation that, in a way, concerned him too, but even if he bragged before he knew most of the technical terms of advocacy, his brain almost overheated in the few miles between his house and the police station. When Steve turned a corner and then turned left again, he could see the police station just ahead, at the end of the street, and nudged Tony's arm, pointing to him their destiny approaching.
“Hey!” He threw his shield at his left head, which turned angrily to see who had dared to hurt it. As he fixed his eyes on Steve, his head growled, showing his huge teeth and moved toward him, pulling the rest of his body and attacking Steve.
"If it weren’t for Peter Parker, Spider-Man wouldn’t even get out of bed in the morning." Steve put an arm around Peter's shoulder. "Listen, if there's one thing that my whole history with
Steve slowed and went back to Tony's mouth for a last kiss, deep and passionate, full of love, that took from Tony all the rest of the breath he had left.
