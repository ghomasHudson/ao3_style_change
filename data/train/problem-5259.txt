“Hells Yeah, who the hell do you think you are talking to. Hopefully Thor will be able to dig up more information.”  Tony stated with his own patented brand of snark.
As soon as he walked into his workshop he forced his thoughts to get back on task. He took a deep breath and let it out all at once. He clapped his hands together and spoke out loud.
No. He knew he had created these pieces of art, he remembered every line, every brushstroke. And he knew Tony was here.
Suddenly, all five spatial distorters pulsed in tandem. The hole dilated then constricted rhythmically like a heartbeat as the distorters struggled to stabilize the pseudo-void. The mother roared in rage when, to Tony's relief, and to the relief of the other Avengers, the portal snapped back to a more manageable size.
“Eleanor, darling, go wash up. It’s going to be a lovely day today.” Peggy smiled as Steve began to prepare the sink to wash the dishes.
Bucky put his one hand up placatingly, seemingly looking contrite. But Tony was able to discern a few lingering tendrils of mirth beyond his gaze.
“If it’s any consolation, I have Jarvis keeping me informed of any and all sightings of Barnes. If he shows up anywhere we will know about it.” He sighed frustrated.
"What the world needs right now is this symbol of hope, justice, strength, perseverance and heroism. Steve is gone but the world still needs Captain America-"
Thor turned to him and smiled softly his previous mischievous countenance completely gone. Leading Steve to believe that ‘that’ was the continuation of a previous encounter. He wondered how that went.
First Cap had Thor manhandle him and make him leave him to fight the Winter Soldier alone. Then Rhodey would not let him have his suit. Then someone came out of nowhere bitching at him for stealing an electrical circuit repair kit. Who the fuck cares at a time like this?!
His heart clenched for her but this was important. There was something supernatural at work here and he was damned if he was going to let it become a threat to his family.
“No computer on earth has the capacity or power to process that much information in its entirety. Except maybe Jarvis. If those were my only obstacles then yes, I would be done by now. However, like Jarvis, whatever is on that Crystal is also an independent entity. I can’t figure it all out without the key.” Tony finished dismally through clenched teeth.
Steve pressed his hand over Tony’s as he cupped his face.  They began to leaned in closer to each other.  Steve came alive at the thought of being able to kiss Tony again, even though he was still mad as hell at the man.  Just as their lips barely brushed, Tony got an alert.
“After San Jose. He said he got out of his restraints and went to go find you only to find her leaving your room instead.”
Johnny and Ben were desperately trying to herd people out of the chaos. Natasha was leading the evac but people were still getting slaughtered. Sam and Rhodey were grounded and Peter and Clint seems to be the only ones desperately trying to hold the perpetrators at bay.
‘Okay, Tony. Focus!’ He commanded himself. ‘Everybody is alive and well, even Steve somehow. But they won’t be if you don’t stop those bots.’
“Fine, just listen then.” Wow, he was actually doing this. “I’m not going to lie, the last couple of weeks have been a special kind of hell. And somehow you seem to be centered in a lot of it.” Tony stated pointedly. He was floored when the soldier turned away contrite. “Yeah, so any way, no hard feelings.” The genius said finally.
The genius jerked away almost violently.  That reaction by far did not go unnoticed by Steve.  He did not know how to feel about that or even where to start analyzing it.  All he does know is that it hurt.
They had ended up in the shipping bay.  Hank went straight to the X-jet to get ready to head back to New York.
“All right! Here’s what we are going to do—“ Director Fury began to order but was cut off by a shrill ring.
“Fine! You’re right, dick.” Before Tony got up he leaned in and claimed another kiss. “I’m glad you’re okay.” He whispered standing up.
Barnes turned and gave Tony that bone chilling stare. Though the genius was still unnerved by that stare, it surprised Tony that he no longer felt the crippling fear he once did. How odd that he no longer felt Barnes was a threat to his life, not in the least. They really have come a long way.
“What is the likelihood of us fixing this? …Coming out on top?” Steve asked uncertain about so many things.
Tony and the others watched with bated breath as the progress bar crept along, seemingly filling at the smallest increments possible. It was utter torture. No one but Tony dared to speak a word in fear that doing so would somehow jinx them all. This was it. The moment of truth. Was the algorithm Bucky provided the key to Calamity’s code?
Now the occupants of the room perked up at that.  They stared at Tony full of hope.  It was in the code after all.  However, Tony was shaking.
Now Steve really felt a nauseating, nasty headache forming. He pressed his hands into his temples more to hold his thoughts together rather than to soothe the pain. He had to do everything he could to remember…
“Look at the two of us. Two pitiful walking disasters, cursing the wretched path life paved for us, all the while regretting each step we take. We make quite a pair, don’t we?” Bucky mused, his voice thick as gravel.
As he watched Sam’s horrible attempt at first aid after realizing the extent of Barnes’ injuries, Tony came up with a few productive ways to spend that time. He had already promised himself that he was going to fight for this world. He had to crack that code.
They came upon Steve’s quarters first.  Tony stopped and smirked at Steve as the Captain open the door intending to go inside.
“I knew without a shadow of a doubt that if you knew you’d come for me and not let a damn thing stop you. I don’t blame you at all, Steve. When I knew nothing else, I knew that.”
He turned around quickly only to find that Barnes was not behind him. He was still in the danger zone. As if in slow motion the mother’s massive corpse was sucked up into the pseudo-void. As soon as her massive frame was no longer blocking the opening the full force of the spatial distortion came into effect.
Tony was by Bucky’s side instantly. He grabbed him before he could hit the floor and helped him up to his feet. He positioned the soldier against the wall of the elevator to study him.
Just as he was going to go through another round of instant replay in his head a shadow loomed over the thick glass panel of his cell.
"Thanks." Tony replied in relief as he grabbed the com and installed it into his ear. He looked up and found Barnes staring with morbid dismay at the portal.
Tony scoffed again as he sat down dramatically on a work stool. It’s funny really, many people were completely and utterly convinced that he had no heart despite the glowing evidence to the contrary. A heartless selfish bastard, always operating according to his own agendas. Tony stared at his scarred worn hands as they clinched and unclenched into fists. He chuckled bitterly at how wrong those ignorant misguided people were. He did have a heart and it was shattered.
It looked like a half plucked, horribly emaciated black bird with horns that looked like twisted worms wrapping around it scaly head. Black teeth lined its gnarled mahogany beak and haggard wings sprouted from its back just above a long sinewy serpentine like tail that lashed about irritatedly.
He couldn't remember anything. He was so lost he did not know who he was, where he was, why he was, all his mind and heart could supply him was that this was not real.
Messy and complex wasn't even half of it. Steve could barely wrap his head around all of this new information. Calamity had been the alien plaguing them for what has to be months now. And for all those months they knew next to nothing about who or what she was or why she was doing what she was doing. And now here she was, standing before him, telling him her life story and willing to answer any question that he desired. But now that he has Calamity front and center, he could not think of a single good question to ask beyond why.
So good, in fact, that he had sacrificed himself to save millions of people. He couldn’t possibly have been real.
"So, what's gonna happen now? You don't have the people of Earth or Midgard should I say, so are you just going to go on to the next planet?"
Tony’s eyes widened almost comically and read Steve’s words with a hunger he’d never known before. He was a broken man dying of thirst receiving the elixir of life. Tears spilled from his eyes as he began to weep openly. He took in each line desperately, sometimes even rereading a part just to make sure he got it right.
Disclaimer: I absolutely do not own anything! Who’d come after me anyway, really? All you’d get is my crappy ass pottery and my last roll of toilet paper. Not Worth it.
It was eons ago, impossible to determine any measure of time for this was well before any thought to measure time. I can recall it clearly, there was a moment when I did not exist. Then I did.
It skidded over the pavement and gently bumped against the soldiers left leg. If Steve had the strength he could have made a grab for it. But as it was he had lost too much blood and was fading fast. Bucky picked up the gun, shaking violently. Steve could hear the gears and mechanisms in his arm whir and buzz out of control.
Time passes and slow progress is made. Darkness lurks just on the horizon, Tony is trying his best to keep his head above the water. He helps in Barnes's recovery any way he can.
The genius knew how complicated the algorithm would be to alter the energy exchange but hopefully with the professors description and If he could personally study one of the patients then maybe he could develop it enough to get close.
The doctor saw his deer in the headlights look and spoke up, "Your baby is eager to join us. Little Eleanor was just as spunky." He remarked.
A/N: Now you guys finally know what happened between Tony and Pepper. Yeah, it was all just a terrible misunderstanding. There is still so much I have instore for Tony and Steve. I hope you guys stay tuned for the next chapter! Please leave a review and let me know what you all think.
“Steven, what is currently happening is much bigger than you suspect.  I can’t say much more about it but it doesn’t all have to do with you.”
“Yep! He was so beautiful and he flew up so high in the clouds! Did you know the clouds are actually made of cotton candy!?”
He couldn’t help recall that the last time he ate a real, full proper meal was when he was on his outing/ date with Tony. He sighed in defeat, dropping his head heavily on to the cool surface of the table. The resounding thud was almost shocking.
Before Steve could really digest the youth's enthusiasm, the boy had already returned carrying a wooden crate of canned food. He seemed to be struggling a bit but continued valiantly. Steve screamed on the inside at the size of the crate.
They stared at him in awe. No doubt noticing his most striking features they couldn’t see before. Like the sharp angle of his nose, the kind shape of his brow line and his golden hair.
“Ok, Here.” Just as the agents had said their farewells, Gloria was about to walk away however she stopped and simply fell over, completely unconscious.
The Captain blushed profusely at his work. He had drawn that a little after his trip to Asgard. He sighed, it felt like so long ago now. Almost like it could have been years.
Tony balked at him and sputtered, “Oh shut up, asshole, you are far more the child than I am and everybody knows it.” Tony retorted then proceeded to zap him in the bandaged shoulder with a tiny electro-stick the genius now carried on his person for this very purpose.
“Come on let’s get you tucked in.” Steve said tiredly as he yanked the blankets out from under Tony flopping him into the floor.
Tony forced the bile down and had to remind himself that Steve would know better. But the awful thought alone was alarming. He couldn’t think straight, the panic was rising. He futilely uttered a few more overrides that had failed, before addressing the Rhododendron.
Tony could only imagine what he was going through. The moment he saw the shattered cybernetics back at the Raft he knew he was in constant excruciating pain. Just by looking at it he could tell some of the work was crude and amateurish. Indicating that even when the arm was whole this man was always in pain. Now, after everything, to finally have that pain recede? What that man was experiencing now was utterly priceless.
It was also in that moment that Tony had fully realized how much he had really needed this hero, and it was also the moment he remembered that he too was a hero.
He squashed down his ire, he needed to focus. He looked around them. He didn't exactly have a computer to work with. His connection with Jarvis was severed when he repurposed his headgear. But then he got an idea.
"Just as I thought." She groaned. "It's called a Rögvava or hell bird. It's from the pseudo-realm called Yræ. They are nasty vile creatures, incredibly deadly."
“Good, any new pain?” Barnes shook his head. “Okay, will wait a bit then move on to step two. That’s the painful step where I reconnect your nerves and neuro-clasps to the arm.”
What if he hadn’t slipped from his restraints? What if he hadn’t learned what Tony was up to? That grievous thought gave him enough strength to pull away.
"I'm glad. I'm glad you don't remember and are happy…here. It was bad and we fell out hard and…" He stopped and pinched the bridge of his nose to contain his emotions.
He knew whatever it was that happened or didn’t happen was because of Calamity. He kind of felt sick thinking that she might have interfered just then.
Tony took another deep breath and made his way to the soldier to begin the procedure. Upon his arrival Barnes stuck out his tongue at Tony and flipped him off then turned to wink at the ladies earning him exasperated giggles. Tony’s left eye began to twitch when the soldier mouthed twenty.
He looked up at her to see a box in her hands. She resisted the urge to throw it at his head, instead tossed it next to him. She sighed.
He pressed his palms firmly over his eyes and tangled his fingers into his dark hair. What were they going to do now?? They really needed to, at the very least, complete the soldier’s medical analysis without him breaking out into a homicidal rage. Why is the universe so hell-bent to be against them!?
“Please, if I can help anywhere else? I can’t just sit around and wait for something to happen.” Steve pleaded.
He made to pick her up before she leveled him with a glare that sliced into his very soul. It reminded him of… He did not know but he was sure he had been on the receiving end of a glare that promised castration. Perhaps he was remembering Peggy’s but could not shake the notion of piercing green eyes and fiery red hair.
He stood abruptly, dropping the coffee mug. It shattered deafeningly on the floor and with it the dark hazy fog that had crept over him last night.
He started to lead Tony to his room. Steve practically tossed Tony onto his bed before moving about to make sure the genius has water and aspirin for the morning. Tony was having fits of giggles on the bed, Steve could hear Tony say something about liking it rough. The poor Captain surely does not want to get into what all that means.
“What are you going to do if you start releasing people and she tries to stop you?” He asked breaking the silence once more.
“Okay, I want Natasha, Clint, Sam, Rhodey and Ms. Munroe on the backup team.” They nodded in affirmation.
Tony was still on his phone but he was also running probabilities in his head. If he could get the professor to describe exactly the way the energy wavelength felt then he could possibly create a desynthasization devise that could potentially reverse whatever it is that is going on.
He looked up to Peggy questioningly. She was leaning in the doorway smiling contentedly, rubbing her belly. She gave him a gentle nod of ascent.
You were right before when you said it wouldn't be possible without encroaching on free will. This is the only way I've found that will make peace possible. With this, people will choose to be peaceful on their own and not because someone bribing them or is standing behind them with a club."
The Avengers are officially on the case. A lot of trying to figure stuff out with out killing each other.
When they got along and cooperated with each other the team as a whole functioned on a higher more efficient level. Missions became a breeze. Or at least as much as a breeze as evil super villains can be. Which eventually lead to Tony actually trusting the team with something incredibly important to him, his true self. Well at least a little bit of it anyway. (No one was ready for full on all natural Tony Stark.) They were a family of sorts now, even going as far to live together in the Avengers Tower.
Who does he love?  The man with the artificial heart.  Artificial…  Artificial…  He has an artificial body…  No not body, armor.  Iron armor, not actual iron but called iron…  Armor…  Iron something…  Iron suit?  No…  Iron person?...  No…  Iron Man?  Iron Man yes!!  It was Iron Man!
losing it. He was afraid that after everything was all said and done he was not going to be functional anymore, that he wasn’t going to be ‘Tony’ anymore.
This was way beyond his pay grade. Steve did not know the first thing about time travel, except from what he read in science fiction novels. Did he even possess the slightest capacity to do anything about it?
Tony resisted the urge to say anything more knowing he’d probably get his neck snapped. Instead he returned his attention to the elevator frowning. They had to time this perfectly.
Perfect. The blast shattered the windows just enough for him to barrel through them. He had to move fast. The whole building would be on alert now.
“Don’t worry Cap, I’ll find things for you to do that I’ll keep you occupied.” Tony said with waggling eyebrows.
Dinner was absolutely divine.  They ate their fill of incredibly delicious food and managed to drink about six lemonades between them.  They each shook the waiters hand and carried out his and the cooks request for an autograph.  The owner even came by for a piece of the action.  And they had the most delightful of conversations.
Now that the Rhododendron and his lackeys were separated from civilians it was time to party. Tony began to unleash his arsenal as he flew over the group. Every single one of his attacks missed.
He stared at the heart monitor as it continued to beep that constant rhythm. Beep…beep…beep… His heart… A heart… It was a heart! The blue light was a heart.
Bucky sighed, "That little punk would probably say something so ridiculously noble like 'I can't think of anyone worthier.'"
Upon their arrival they were immediately debriefed and they got straight to work. They started going through all of the documents. Most of them were being scanned into the computer and translated by a translation formula Asgard also provided. Then the documents were put through an algorithm that Tony set up, now it’s the waiting game. Steve hated to wait.
It had been three days since his talk with Steve and in those regards Calamity. And in that time, he and his team and several of his sentinel robots and iron legion prototypes had traveled the world trying to get each and every device in place and activated. Unfortunately, that had left what was left of the Avengers mercilessly spread too thin and the Rhododendron knew it.
He shivered and forced the frightening thoughts away as he stirred in a small spoonful of sugar into the coffee. He mindlessly watched the brown liquid swirl about as he stirred mesmerized by the clink of the metal spoon against the sides of the ceramic mug. It should have been no surprise then that as he was utterly absorbed in his task that he did not hear the arrival of his newest visitor. Not until they spoke up right behind him.
“Rocky still on the outside passes Ms. Lady on the outside and is coming up neck to neck! The crowd is going wild! They are coming up on the finish line now, and Rocky and Ellie finish first by a nose! Yeah!”
"Daddy! The meat is burning!" She hollered as Steve was in the middle of putting the cornmeal back into the pantry.
“You’re crazy son of a bitch!”  Clint uttered in relief as he leaned in for a hug after Natasha moved aside.
“I need to talk to you about something important.” Tony began knowing Barton was going to make this conversation unbearable.
Bucky skillfully avoided security as he attained an envelope and a priority box. He mused bitterly how his accursed skill set Hydra “taught” him was very useful now. He quickly wrote down the appropriate information on the box that Steve told to him. He gently folded Steve’s letter and placed it in the envelope. He then placed the envelope and the sketchbook in the box.
“Stevie, Stevie I can go on. There were many, many of them in the two years we served together.” He said smirking.
“Daddy! You’re painting the suit of armor again!” Ellie squealed excitedly as she bounded up to Steve.
“You want to know how it affected me when Loki was in my head?” Clint observed seemingly emotionless.
All he wanted to do was remain in the vastly sweet oblivion, completely ignorant to everything that was happening. But the harder he tried to remain in the dark the closer the light came. The moment he opened his eyes more pain enveloped him. In that awful moment everything came back to him. He truly wished that he had remained unaware of the events that had transpired that day.
“I let you fall once; it was not going to happen again! Never again.” Steve responded in a low growl.
Tony hazard a glance up at him and regarded his stunned face. He was staring at the dead mother in astounded appreciation.
He looked down at his left wrist in dismay. Calamity’s black mark was still there. It had been weeks. Her fingerprints remain very prominent. He shook his head.
“As you must know by now director, we need to return to New York to address this new development.”  Professor Xavier stated as he motioned for everyone to follow him.
Tony sighed. “The feelings mutual, Buddy, just promise not to kill me and we will work out the rest.” Tony huffed as he began to lead them out of the cell.
He had one megaton watt idea left in his arsenal.  He opened the floodgates and let loose all of the horrors he’s been subjected to since he joined the army all that time ago.  The cruel and heinous things he saw that the Red Skull and Hydra were capable of.  He especially unleashed his sorrow, guilt and misery over Bucky’s death at the Professor with wretched abandon.  Xavier didn’t even flinch, not even a twitch of muscle.
He clicked his tongue at himself and chuckled darkly. That was another reason he guessed that he himself was so adamant to help Barnes in this way. It was something that he could accomplish, something that he could control 100%. He needed to be of use in this one little stupid way. Calamity probably has them all fucked six ways to Sunday but at least Tony was going to accomplish this. He was going to help this man, Steve’s friend and brother in ways Steve himself could not.
The flight to Tennessee was made in relative silence at least on Steve’s part anyway.  Natasha and Clint were chatting a bit obviously happy to get off of the helicarrier despite heading towards what might be the hairy mission.
“Okay, this will work very similarly to that one but only for a moment.” He held out what looked like a tiny ball.
Now that letter, I had hoped to make is more poetic-esk? But I figured Steve is as emotionally constipated as I am so it’s still rather in character. I am so glad I had finally gotten to this point. I had been looking forward to revealing that Bucky was alive and Tony receiving Steve’s letter. Woot!
Tony forced more power into his thrusters. Steve turned around to face Tony and reached out his free hand for Tony to take. Iron Man threw his hand out and latched onto Steve’s hand with a death grip. He quickly shifted his angle and began to pull them away from the hole. He did his best to try and pull them both to safety, but the force of the pseudo-void kept getting stronger and the drain on Tony’s arc reactor was becoming unbearable.
He grabbed his spoon and dug in as well. As soon as the cold and creamy flavors exploded in his mouth he immediately fully understood Ellie’s euphoria.
But have no fear I have up to chapter 25 written out in my notebook so once I start getting all those typed out there will be updates! Yay! However, after chapter 25 it’s going to kind of be slow going from there. And you will hate me.
Then he started to hear the thoughts of a very strong mind approaching the area. The destination of this particular mind seems to be that very room. Xavier decided to concentrate on that mind. It was laced with genuine worry. Not for himself like most of the occupants of the ship but for the victims and his teammates. There was absolutely no concern for his own wellbeing at all. His very aura exuded selflessness and purity. ‘Truly fascinating! What a mind. If only all men thought this way.’
While Steve was sizing up the rolls, Elaine, at least he assumed the lady was Elaine, was asking Ellie about her new doll. Steve smiled to himself as he listened to Ellie gush about it.
Before anyone asks him to, Thor began to elaborate, “This being will follow every living Midgardian soul to the ends of the universe itself.
He took a deep breath and began to read. He did not know how right he was in assuming the contents of the letter. What he truly was not prepared for, however, was the fact that it was a love letter.
“What about… a mass evacuation? A worldwide evacuation… it’s possible right?” Rushed Clint anxiously.
"You answering yes to me wasn't part of your test. Like I said it was always meant to happen, one way or another."
“I would have Mr. Stark assist Hank in creating a device that would be able to see into the patients’ minds.  At this point in time my own abilities are beyond such an endeavor, but Hank has come up with a few ideas that with the help of Mr. Stark may be able to penetrate the minds of these people at least for a moment to glimpse and to see what’s happening.  If we know what’s going on in their minds we may be able to understand what this alien foe’s true intention is upon our people.” He waited a moment, letting his words sink in.
“‘You mustn’t dwell too hard on the ‘what ifs.’  There has been much in your life that had been taken from you.  And though it is healthy to remember them and give them the respect in time to mourn the loss you should not dwell and yearn for them.  True it is easier said than done and there have been many times when I myself have dwelled and yearned for the ‘what ifs.’
Tony did some digging, everyone waited with baited breath eager to know what he found. Which leads us to where we are now.
She smiled deviously. Clint had the urge to edge away from her however doing so would result in him getting stabbed so he refrained. She was in one of those moods, itching for an epic fight.
How on earth was he going to find him? There was no telling where he could be at this point in time. The others sure as hell weren’t going to simply let Steve go gallivanting off to find him. To be perfectly honest he was sure they would force another kind of house arrest on him.
They had eventually arrived into an ordinary meeting room.  Fury, Maria, Coulson and Clint were already in the room.  As soon as the Director realized that Steve and Natasha had arrived he wasted no time in briefing them of their mission.
Steve was in love with Tony, that he was certain. But somehow in this time he wasn't going to exist.
Apparently Steve had actually been unconscious for three days and was in a trancelike state for eighteen hours.  The Captains immensely stupid and idiotic idea worked beautifully, however.  From what they were able to analyze from various sources Steve’s quick thinking and sacrifice saved thousands upon thousands of people.
Tony spent the next several hours coming up with idea after idea for prosthetic arms. Some were practical, some overly embellished and for shits and giggles. Some were completely outlandish and most certainly utilized the sex toy design and one design had to do with a rubber chicken.
Tony watched on in horror as his body was forcefully moved into position to target the projection pods, his mind was screaming. He rapidly muttered override code after override code. By the time the last projection pod was destroyed he was screaming the codes. Alas none worked.
Before he sealed the box he had one more item to place. Under his shirt he pulled out a worn red leather bound journal. He traced the black star on the cover with disdain. This was essentially his instruction manual. He loathed its existence. He had originally planned on destroying it, however, there were far more secrets in that book than just how to operate a winter soldier.
“Definitely.” Steve replied with a smirk matching Bucky’s as he slapped his friend on the back. “You coming?”
It paid off however, when he finally came up with a plan. Very stupid plan, but a plan nonetheless. He was 90% sure it was going to work. Good enough. The only thing was he needed to execute the plan at just the right time. He also needed the right conditions.
“No! It’s time you shut up and listen to me!” She cut him off sharply. Tony gulped audibly. “The universe is in trouble, Tony! The UNIVERSE!” She shouted causing Tony to flinch. “I know this whole situation is shit, I really do. But hating on S-Barnes is helping no one right now.”
The vice president was in Texas during the assassination. Shield and other special forces units were on a trail heading east.
He took a shuttering breath, “Yeah, I’m fine. I really don’t know what came over me.” He tried to sound reassuring. “I just had a moment I guess.”
The room became eerily quiet.  Everyone slowly looked at Tony for confirmation.  The genius had placed his hands over his face and began to sob.
“I guess I just rub people the wrong way.”  He shrugged with a laugh as he scratched the back of his head.
Fury decided that the Fantastic Four needed to be brought in on this also. Their arrival was strained at best. The Fantastic Four operated independently of the government and the Avengers bringing them in meant assimilating them into their group. After their briefing they weren’t quite as reluctant. They adapted well getting to know all of the other members.
Steve absently thought how marvelous it was to be looking into the face of his brother and to hear his voice after believing without a shadow of a doubt that he would never see him again. That was until the shock of Bucky’s response finally sunk in. To think of everything Bucky must have gone through till now made Steve sick all over again.
Tony looked at Clint a long while. Loki tried to take control of him the same way he did Clint. Somehow his arc reactor shielded him, an artificial heart not so easily swayed. In that moment Tony was truly afraid. All of the weapons he had access to, his suits, his life’s work could have been completely at Loki’s disposal. Everything he painstakingly built to protect people with could have easily been used to destroy them.
The man beamed. "What can I do you for today? That hoe holding up well, I hope?" He inquired in a gruff yet kind voice.
There is a part of me that still hates you. And that’s exactly what makes me crazy about you. I love how much I hate you. I love how angry you make me. I love how complicated you are. How you keep me on my toes, I never know what to expect out of you. You are such an infuriating puzzle. A puzzle in which I am desperate to solve.
“Mission success.” He responded with a cocky smirk. “I don’t think I was spotted considering I made it back here in one piece.”
Xavier was in a state of exhilaration. He was sure that if Steve had not stepped in when he did, he was going to do ‘that thing.’ He was getting too angry and frustrated it would not have ended well. The Professor is usually so patient but at that moment he was feeling not only his stress, anxiety and fear, but everyone else’s too.
He looked at Tony’s exhausted face knowing the kind of mental energy it took just to make all this happen.  Steve grabbed the tired genius’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze making sure he understood how proud of him he was at this very moment.  Tony looked up at him with a weary smile.  Despite his extreme exhaustion he was actually incredibly happy with Steve’s proverbial pat on the back.  The genius leaned into the Captains touch ever so slightly.  Absorbing the warmth he had to offer.
“Just you wait you little asshole! I’ll get you back. I’m still winning at thirty-four!” Tony barked, kicking the bolt away as he made his way to the exam station.
“Well if it is, see you all on the other side.” Tony grinned as he plugged the thumb drive into the tablet.
After supper that night while Ellie was working on her chores and beginning her nightly routine, Steve had decided to take a walk around the property before the last of the daylight faded away. Apparently, he was being clingy and smothering. He smiled wistfully to himself. As he stepped out on the back porch, he knew he probably was but he couldn’t help it. Peggy was just so damn strong and beautiful he just wanted to make sure she was comfortable. He realized all his fussing probably didn’t help any but made a point to try harder the future.
Don’t forget to leave me a review at the end and tell me what you think. As always I apologies for any and all errors.
They all looked out the window to see what had warranted the assassin’s response. There were thousands upon thousands more fuzz balls floating around than what they had viewed earlier.
She just looked at him with this blank look on her face. He cannot read her at all. The silence was deafening, making him near panicking.
“Hydra killed my parents. You are no more than the gun they use to pull the trigger.” He stated bluntly. “At first, it’s true, I wanted you dead, wanted you to pay, to suffer. But instead I got a sickening dose of reality, a new perspective so to speak.” He paused, Bucky listened openly, utterly stricken. “There is no one on this planet that will make you suffer more than yourself. Look at you, you are so destroyed over the things Hydra forced you to do you can’t even function right. You barely go a few hours lucid before you completely breakdown because the memories of the horrible things that has been done to you and the horrible things they force you to do to others are too much to bear.” Tony painfully observed.
“Mother Fucker!” Johnny shouted as he jumped off of the roof and dove for Harker. Ben quickly jumped after him.
“Oh, Ellie Sweetie, you will be better than me one day. I’m certain of it.” He said pulling her into a hug. “I don’t know if I ever told you but for most of my life I couldn’t even see colors right. It wasn’t until after the procedure that I could even see reds and greens.”
Steve looked at Tony incredulously. He folded his arms across his chest clearly not amused with Tony’s demand. Steve then proceeded to stare at Tony with a look that screamed ‘Shut the fuck up! I am here for a far more important reason than to get you coffee!’ Of course our fine Captain would not say that out loud, however that look is usually sufficient enough. This time is no different. It took Tony only 2.5 seconds to get the point. This, by the way, is a decent improvement. The genius is getting better and better at recognizing his team mates ‘faces’. It only took misinterpretating one of Natasha’s bitch faces to become very skilled at the art of perceiving them. But that’s a story for another time.
Barnes merely twisted the skeletal metal hand around and flip Tony off, his smug expression never leaving his face.
Becoming very pensive, the Captain couldn’t help to think that a vacation after this case would be absolutely wonderful.  If only they could in fact solve the case.
It’s going to happen soon, Tony, and I already know that our next meeting isn’t going to be pretty. I just want you to know that no matter how our encounter plays out, I’ll still love you, no matter what. And that despite everything that has happened and will happen I forgive you for everything.
“And yeah, it sucks that… That I didn’t die like I should have and became…” His voice broke as he minutely gestured to his metal arm. “But look at us now! The world’s ending and you’re being forced to play a significant role in that and because of everything that has happened I get to be here now when you need me the most.”
Now I hope that you all enjoy this chapter. It is prison break time! Please don’t forget to leave a review at the end of the chapter after you read. I’d really like to know what you all think.
He looked up at her and noticed her eyes were closed but he was not foolish enough to believe she was fully asleep. Then he focused on her round middle. She was heavily pregnant and glowing radiantly.
Steve began to speak slower and softer now. He tried to maintain control of his emotions. Despite his efforts he knew by the end he would be in tears. It’s one thing to internalize it all and another to say it out loud.
As they had gotten settled down by their new hiding spot by the river, Steve pulled out a small travel map and got down to business.
"Well, you just put the milk in the cupboard and the cornmeal in the refrigerator." She pointed out matter-of-factly.
Steve's eyes widened just as the man's face contorted sharply. He did not know if the man would become a threat to Ellie. Steve can tell that whatever this was that was happening was not going in the man's favor. And if there was any sliver of a truth in the unspeakable dream he had last night, then he had a few guesses why.
"Yeah, if that's okay. I can't just keep calling you Calamity. And I guess I just thought it would be nice for you to be called a name that was connected to her somehow." And that would be easy for Steve to pronounce, but he did not say that out loud.
He absently became aware of the fact that he was in a cell. A super max design for enhanced individuals. He was bound in chains and with bitter irony realized he was strapped into that steel straitjacket that Fury threatened him with all those days ago.
That moment was lost however when War Machine reengaged delivering another round of heavy artillery. Three bullets hit their mark at Bucky’s right shoulder and arm and Steve screamed in desperation. Despite his weak broken body, the Captain tried yet again to unpin himself from Iron Man’s unrelenting grasp. His efforts were futile and only served to make Tony hold him down tighter and harder. He moaned in agony he could feel blood starting to leak from the torn stitches again.
“It can be a bit of a rush your first time, so brace yourself, my friend.” He paused before looking up to the heavens.
He had been rather appalled at the slow rate of healing that most humans underwent for serious injuries. He had been completely unhappy to learn how long it took for ‘His’ Jane’s broken wrist to heal.  Things were just different in other galaxies.
“The offer still stands if you change your mind. You know where to find me.” And with that he left the soldier alone and made his way back to his workshop.
“Yeah I’ve done that.  I’d spend my summers with my aunt in Montana of all places, before my father thought I’d be a better idea to send me to boarding school instead.
“You meant the world to him you know. Honestly, he would probably kick my ass for coming up with such a stupid plan.” He sighed again. “But I think you and I both know he would still go along with it being that it is the end of the world after all. We can’t give up now.” He said softly.
That move threw Steve for a moment. It was like he could be looking in a mirror, an antique one, and Kevin could look up and there would be Bucky’s eyes looking at him. He could also glance back at Tommy and see himself.
Steve bolted, jumping roof to roof trying to stay moving. Tony and Thor flew to the air searching for the Winter Soldier. The Captain saw a glimpse of that arm a few buildings away. He also noted Calamity sitting on a water tower on a high building watching them.
Hi! First off I am so sorry that I have been away for so long. The Holidays just really kicked my ass.
"Then let's go home. Please Daddy. Let's go home." She grabbed his hand and rubbed the strange dark bruise on his wrist. "Forget about this." She whispered then kissed the mark. "Let's go home." She smiled up at him.
Tony smirked wryly knowing he was making Barnes uncomfortable, however Tony was even more uncomfortable knowing how huge and raw the favor was he was gonna ask.
Cold chills ran down Tony’s spine as he realized the Rhododendron now had control of him. At the very least he assumed so considering the man’s unsettling uncontrollable laughter. All of the grotesque possibilities ran through his head lightning fast. All he could see was Armageddon. The things they could make him in his suit do alone were utterly unthinkable. Not to mention the places he could feasibly have access to because of the presence of the suit.
The absolute last thing he needed right now was for Tony and Bucky to try and kill each other. Steve had no idea what to say or do in this situation but he knew he had to neutralize the conflict and fast. The Captain held his hands up in an attempt to defuse the tension.
“Tony, you are the only hope this world has left. Do you know how many people are looking to the company to fix this? And how many people I have the look in the eye and say I don’t know!?”
After a grueling debriefing, where he found out what he witnessed was an assassination, they pestered him nonstop about what he saw on the roof.  He couldn’t remember much, just a flash of movement.  The best he could come up with was a dark figure and something shiny that flashed before it was gone.
“Well, that wasn’t so bad.” He thought. But it had definitely been a long and painful day. Shortly after he fell into a light sleep completely and utterly unable to stay awake.
And now, that metal arm was rapidly heading to his face.  He lifted his shield just in time to block and was shocked at how powerful that punch was.
“Look,” the genius began gesturing out a command to his holo-ports. “Jarvis is the most complex piece of code on earth. Approximately 100 terabytes and growing.” Tony explained to Bucky exactly what he explained to Pepper some time ago. “This is a visual manifestation of Jarvis’s mind, essentially.”
There were at least twenty people scattered about within the pews. Now all he had to do was find Bucky. Oh man, he was so close to finding him. He could feel it. He was definitely here.
He instantaneously felt the drain on his chest piece but took no time launching himself after Steve.
“Ah, my dearest love, there is some truth in that.  But I cannot tell you why.  What I can tell you is that there is a 0.5% chance that you can stop me.  Only if the right conditions are met.  And before you ask, I cannot tell you what those conditions are you must figure that out on your own.”  She smiled softly at them.
Steve could barely make out the name of the shop. 'Elaine's Fabrics' it said in faded cursive on the window. Steve was better able to identify that it was the place they were indeed looking for because of the sewing mannequins displayed in the window.
“Yeah, I know.” He did know, he felt the same way. “I’m just a bit torn, I’d like to involve as few people as possible in this. To impose this impossible burden on them would be so unfair and cruel. Yet, I know I can’t simply take away their right to choose if they want to be a part of this.” Steve uttered through his warring thoughts.
"WAH! Where did the rift go!" The Rhododendron bellowed as he shakingly picked himself off of the ground.
Thor shook his head and replied, “It was from a time long past. Eons ago my people had discovered a planet of ruin during my grandfather’s time. Not a single soul was found. But artifacts unearthed suggests that a race once existed that could have been as advanced as our own race at the time. Among the artifacts was this etching.” Thor held the drawing up once more.
Realizing quickly that this man's head was all over the place, Steve decided upon a different approach.
"Uh…" Tony glanced down at his legs still bound in his dead armor. He had Jarvis send a new one his way before he severed the connection with his A.I. It should have been there by now…
Becka’s hands found their way to his hair. Her near death experience forgotten in favor of Steve’s golden tresses. Steve smiled kindly at her.
Suddenly, Tony began to gently roll his hips against Steve's, invoking a sharp intake of breath, breaking their kiss. Steve groaned deeply as he tossed his head back in a futile attempt to stay in control. Tony took that opportunity to latch onto Steve's pulse at the base of his neck just above his clavicle.
“Steve!!”  They all shouted excitedly.  Steve opened his arms wide for the kids.  They were wrapped in his big safe arms in moments, snuggling happily into his warm body.  Behind the kids three sets of parents walked in.  They all were staring at Steve like he was pure gold.  Like he was the most wonderful thing in the world.
Find out All this and more in the chapters to come! So, Please come back and read some more!! Don’t forget to leave me a review and let me know what you think! All comments, questions and theories welcome.
“One of these days, Tony.” She sighed. “Come here.” She pulled him into a hug. “Really, Tony, think about it.” She whispered.
Soon enough Steve ended up in his own quarters pacing all by his lonesome. Then the call came that the special guest had arrived and the all-important meeting would soon be underway which served to alleviate Steve’s anxiety, at least for now.
Steve turned to Tony suddenly. Before the genius could comprehend what was happening he felt a warm feather light pressure on his forehead right where the Captain got him earlier. A wave of euphoria flowed over him like a cascade.
A/N: And we’re back! Thank you so much, everyone, for leaving your wonderful reviews. They are truly my fuel.
Soon enough a delicate calm had enveloped them as they sat there peacefully under that tree. The kids had fallen asleep shortly after, every one of them.
They enveloped the Captain and the pain was nothing like he had ever felt before. He could barely see the children, they had stopped and were screaming for him. He wanted to assure them, to urge them on but nothing would come out. He couldn’t scream, he couldn’t breathe. He was drowning in an ocean of pain. He thought he was going to pass out any time, his consciousness was blurring.
He did not have the capacity to manufacture a new one and if the hole got big enough, she could come out! Not only that, the hole itself could suck in the whole city, maybe even more…
“We now have a face. We need to know what the 69 seconds means. And we need to know if this woman was present around the time the others fell.” He continued.
“There’s the spirit!” Tony exclaimed. “Now, while you’re still with me, you are still with me right? Not going to nut up on me are you?”
Later that night, after successfully getting Ellie tucked in without a hitch, and reading her 'The Fox and the Grapes' from Aesop's fables, Steve went about the house and property trying to finish the chores he could before Peggy got home.
“Although, that one X-Men friend of yours made one hell of a go at it.”  She remarked as she lifted her shirt to show her abdomen.  There were three dark red marks were Logan’s claws penetrated her flesh.
“…  Garbage.”  He laughed. “You silly little IronMan, you fail to realize that it is a part of my consciousness.”  He sneered as he tapped a device on his temple.
“Steve, you crashed the Valkyrie into the Arctic and saved the world only weeks after I fell. There was nothing you could do.”
“You have to. Listen Buck, I need you to go with them and make sure they make it out of here alive.” He retorted firmly.
Natasha, right beside Clint, quickly assessed the situation and swiftly concluded that the occupants in the room were having a moment. She smiled knowingly on the inside and said nothing.
Now, what exactly does Tony have planned for Bucky? Will Tony figure out how to solve Calamity’s code before she begins collecting souls? What is Steve’s true role in all of this? Will he find a way back to the others or is he truly doomed to serve as Calamity's pawn for all eternity?
victim. Making eight new cases since the mysterious alien hit the school. Why can’t they catch a break?
It's so strange, these heartbeats, it is as though he has been here before… Like a long-lost dream...
Instantly he realized that there was in fact a battle still going on. He flinched slightly as the ground shook harshly after Clint shot an explosive arrow at the bot. Steve began to realize with trepidation that perhaps they all were not a match for this particular Doom machine.  He watched as Hawkeye shot another arrow at the bot only for the machine to catch it midair and shoot it back to the Quin jet.
He was so weak, he realized, he definitely could not move out of the bed.  Instead he held his arms out the best he could.  Immediately his arms were full of asinine genius.  He breathed in Tony’s scent as he held him as close as he could to his weak body.  He ran his hands up and down Tony’s back and tangled his fingers into his hair.  Tony was shaking slightly trying desperately to hold back sobs.
“Oh come on Cap, he didn’t order us to stay here.  He didn’t say we couldn’t leave.”  Tony smirked, “And I have my suit with me remember?”
“Tony.”  He said gently, the genius looked up at him expectantly.  “If anybody can find a potential cure you can.  We do things differently here on earth.  With whatever information Thor has to provide I’m sure if we all work together we’ll find a way.”  Steve smiled reassuringly at Tony.
“All right, everybody, time to wake up!” He bellowed to his machines and computers. “We’ve got two things to work on today: code breaking and designing prototype arms.” He said as he sat himself in front of a holographic monitor.
Charles smiled at them; he saw them as the troublesome kids they were at heart. Fury stared at them incredulously; he was just as lost as the others that had just started to file in.
acquaintance with the pavement the Captain lost his helmet. He picked himself up shakingly. He saw stars after that hit. Blood was now pouring down his face in delicate red ribbons. The soldier stopped and regarded him.
“You have these monitors in front of you. The one in the middle here is your control panel. Here you control the cameras placed around the station and their feed appears on the other six screens.” Tony adjusted the displays and began to elaborate. “As you can see, the cameras are showing live at multiple angles around the chair. You can see exactly what I would be doing at any given point. If you see something you don’t like or understand tell me to stop and I will stop and I will try to make it right. You with me so far?” Tony said looking up at Barnes expectantly.
It had been twelve days since Calamity had taken Steve, ten since Tony broke Barnes out of the Raft and one full week since the shocking revelation that Barnes had murdered his parents. Tony has yet to have any contact with the soldier since then. Even if there was a tiny, itty-bitty part of him that has made some kind of peace with it, he still could not bring himself to face him. Even then Barnes’s lucid state of mind had become few and far between, they were losing him.
Steve opened his eyes and blinked slowly up at Iron Man. "Just shut up and help me up." Captain America said holding his hand up for Iron Man to take.
Tony began tuning them out in favor of hunkering down to further focus on disassembling the stolen doom code.
“No…  No…  No…”  Was Natasha’s whispered mantra into Clint’s shoulder as she began to sob once more.
The Captain began to explain in full detail how he intended to infiltrate the warehouse. He also explained how to access the jet and he briefly went over how to operate it. A lot of it rode on Bucky’s potential piloting skills. Steve was confident he could get them out of there safely. They just needed to time at all precisely. They also needed a hell of a lot of luck. Desperately hoping that no one else was coming for them. Considering that possibility he also went over what exactly they should do regarding whoever they may encounter. He told them what they should do if Shield should show up and he went over what they should do depending on which Avenger should show. The most basic plan for each was run like the wind.
Honestly, they say curiosity killed the cat for a reason but in Tony's defense he sure as hell did not expect to be sucked into Steve's mind reality so thoroughly that he was actually capable of interacting with him. What he did know, however, was that any interaction with Steve was going to end in a glorious blaze of catastrophe. When Tony realized that he was never going to exist in Steve's little perfect world; it was, for lack of a better word, devastating.
Tony shakingly, and quite reluctantly held out his hand and the small crystal landed in the middle of his palm. If any were to later ask he most certainly did not squeak when the crystal began to move and change shape. It seemed to unfold and come apart in a way that was not unlike old transformers figures. It didn't stop until the end result resembled… A fairy?
"I know this is going to be kind of weird and you can understandably say no, but is it all right if I call you Anük?" Steve asked tentatively.
“To answer your question, it was a world from another time near the beginning of everything. Before history books were written and before time itself held any meaning. In a time where life forms had barely begun to become aware of their own existence.” She answered.
Tony's attention was diverted, however, when two things happened simultaneously. First, Jarvis alerted him that the blackhole had expanded even more. It was now strong enough to pull debris and smaller objects into its void. The second was that the weird death birds had hatched from their chrysalises and were now emitting disturbing shrieks.
So, much to Tony’s ire, Barnes’s playlist consisted of the oddest selection of music; bouncing around between jazz, swing, classic rock, punk rock, metal and soul. Tony could not begrudge him of it however, because incidentally, music calmed the soldier down immensely. It’s affect at soothing him was even greater than that of Wanda. When their burn war proved to no longer distract Barnes from his personal hell while installing the new hardware, his music became invaluable.
"Oh, my dear child, you are mistaken. I have not come to aid you." She sighed. "I have come to collect that which you owe me."
Xavier had gathered a special team of mutants together and are going back and forth between the Avengers compound (home base), the sky base and back to the school to compile the rest of the data and to include anybody else interested in joining.
He groaned as he looked at the time. It was nearly three in the afternoon. A good chunk of his team had been deployed about an hour ago to take care of a group of enhanced individuals causing trouble smack in the middle of downtown Baltimore, Maryland. According to the sightings the Rhododendron was amongst them.
He startled slightly when the mother roared again. He snapped his head up an alarm and found that he was now far too close to her for comfort. She now had her entire head and even a decrepit claw shoved through the portal opening. She flailed about agitatedly.
"The doctor said that the baby is eager to join us, I heard him." He smiled. "Your baby sibling really wants to meet you the most I bet." He said.
"They," Tony started as the Soldier helped haul him to his feet. "Have the capacity to adapt to whatever we throw at them. They are sophisticated A.I.s that can learn faster than we can think."
“Director, it would be of no use to issue that order. Not only will the panic spread like wild fire but you also must understand that if it came here undetected it could leave just as stealthily.” The Professor explained promptly.
Okay, not a pod person. He couldn’t just let him be completely right for one minute. Such a nice person. Tony waited for him to elaborate.
He began with how, at first, cases kept popping up all the while the numbers increasing exponentially. They had narrowed down the source to be otherworldly. He explained how they planned to learn everything they possibly could to stop her. Then he described how she made an appearance and had given them the information needed to stop her but it was heavily encrypted.
Tony nodded silently, blinking rapidly. Steve knew if Tony engaged, he would have died right then and there.
Tony groaned loudly. If Steve could see his face he’d bet the genius was rolling his eyes with every bit of attitude he could muster. He shook his head sadly.
Bucky nodded. He shakingly held up his right hand for Tony to take. The genius eased him up slowly but firmly.
Steve paused for a moment to think. They were about three miles from the nearest perimeter line. He could do it. He had to.
“Given the information that you have compiled, Tony, I have no doubts now that SHIELD will intervene at some point soon. Which means we should prepare for the inevitable.”
The other Avengers with the help of the X-Men had made equally little progress. They had combed through the documents. They went back and forth between interpreting vague passages and trying to fit the one new piece of information they found somewhere in the mess of data they already have.
Tony was shocked to find an all new color to Steve’s eyes presented to him right then.  It was that warm stormy grey with a more charcoal definition, something that reminded him of the deepest depths of the ocean.  This color was his new favorite he found.
The Captain spotted Tony flying sluggishly around what appears to be the Winter Soldier.  His suit was heavily damaged.  He thought Tony was just enough out of the range of the soldier until he saw the dark figure jump impossibly high and nabbed Tony right out of the sky.  The soldier pinned Iron Man to the ground and Steve watched in horror as he forcefully clutched Tony’s ark reactor through the suit intending to crush it and rip it out.
Just as Fury looked at his devise Xavier emitted a soft, “My God…” At that moment the helicarrier's red alert alarms started to howl.
“I love you too Ellie, so so much.” He said back as he buried his right hand into her beautiful golden curls.
He wished he could glance back at Bucky to see if he was planning anything but the moment he took his eyes off of Rumlow it would be over.
What he wanted to do was exactly the perfect thing to do with the last of his life. He was going to save Bucky. He could not save him seventy years ago but he was definitely going to save him now. If it was the last thing he was going to do… Literally.
Before anyone says anything, in Tony’s mind he already knows that such an endeavor is next to impossible.
The other half of his team continued on adamantly and admiringly. Black widow still evacuating the streets and buildings and the Thing and Torch pulling people out of the rubble. And here he was, literally trapped in his own suit, forced to be this disgusting man’s toy, his puppet. All the while, the other half of his team watched on.
After realizing that his face had not yet met the dirt, he looked up to find himself safe in Steve's arms. He looked up into the warm gray eyes of his Captain. Hope threatened to ignite in his heart.
It felt like he had watched him fall all over again. He could hear Tony talking to him but none of his words sank in. All he could hear was the sound of his heart tearing apart once more.
Not only that, the whole San Jose fiasco had happened because Dr. Doom was trying to find Harker who had hacked into Von Dooms private servers and stole highly classified data as evidence of the knockoff doom bots harassing major cities of the world. It was also likely that Harker probably had everything Kumin Tankar had worked on, considering the numerous mega fuzz buzz floating about as well. And lastly, Harker had somehow tracked down one of Hydra's greatest weapons, the Winter Soldier.
He was about to continue until he looked up and saw the look on Steve’s face. The Captain looked like he was about to throw up. Steve always took these kinds of things really seriously; as if each unfortunate victim or casualty was his own personal failure.
I am so sorry that I have been gone so long! I really tried to come back sooner but life deeply enjoys throwing me those curveballs. Nevertheless, here I am.
He watched as a few strays here and there all the sudden popped into five different zappers. They were coming closer too.
“Ah, the archer, he speaks.” She looked at Clint surprised. He now held her complete attention and wanted nothing more than to shit his pants.
Suddenly, Tony’s suit burst through the portal bay doors and disassembled into a bunch of parts effectively zooming around knocking each one of the officials out cold before enveloping Tony completely.
"What our scholars could decipher was that people fell asleep and never woke up. That’s all we were really able to come up with the entry referenced to this person. Soon after, Asgard went on a search for other worlds of similar fate. There had been five others as far as we know. But in the end that is truly all we know.”
Time seemed to slow to an absolute stop for Tony. And for the entire battlefield, as it would seem, as friend and foe alike paused with bated breath.
Director Fury, being as exhausted as he was didn’t really mind others swaying the meeting every which way.  He was just happy that they were seeing results. As minuscule as they were, it was still something.
Then the Captain’s heightened senses which were dialed up further than they had ever been before finally picked up on it. He desperately tried to suppress his erratic breathing to give his enhanced hearing a chance to hone in on the sound he’d recognize anywhere. A sound that at one time used to bring other relief during such tumultuous and dire circumstances. Only now inspires uneasy trepidation. He could hear the pulsing sound of the repulser technology of Stark Industries flight stabilizers.
“Oh, well Natasha it made me swear that if I ever saw a prickly pear lemonade on the menu that I would order it because if I didn’t apparently I would regret it for the rest of my life.  Or something like that.”  He stated with a smile looking up at Tony.
The genius looked down at the mess of papers on the floor and his eyes landed on the creepy journal. He shook off the feeling of dread and gathered all of the contents of the package and stuffed them in a satchel he pulled out of a compartment.
Tony shook his head then got back to work, he absolutely could not let that foul mouth little turd win. Iron Man continued his assault on the hell birds and doom bots.
A/N: And so we are finally here! Definitely took me a while. And I do apologize for some of the unfortunate events that transpired last chapter but it was necessary. And I know some of you would have liked this chapter sooner but work and everything else just loves getting into the way. And for the fact that October 30 is my birthday and as a birthday present to myself I went to Wizard World Convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 23.
“You ready to tango?”  Not wanting to find out the difference of what this one was capable of, Steve flew into action first.
“It tickles you.” Tony declared triumphantly as he waved the wand over Barnes’s shoulder again and again eliciting an undignified squeal in response.
Steve however, was in an entirely different universe. While the soldier was inside his head Steve finally got a fleeting glance at his eyes. It felt like someone had thrust their fist into his chest began to squeeze his heart.
Maria Hill soon arrived with copious amounts of files in her arms. She stood at the front of the meeting room while handing Fury a particular document. She set the rest at the end of the table near where she stood. Fury looked over the file handed to him. He felt it time to start this long overdue meeting.
Bucky had always been big and strong to Steve, he had been his teacher, protector and provider. He had been his voice of reason and his reality check. Bucky had also been his greatest supporter and would be right behind him if he wanted to reach for the stars. He was nurturing, when Steve was sick Bucky would remain diligently, ever faithfully by his side. Bucky was his confidant, his best friend, his brother.
“Hey, in my defense I was not aware that I was being as she put it “a total dick face” and that if I didn’t shape up I was going to be “wearing my ass for a hat,” like literally.”  The genius alleged with a shiver.
"I know from your perspective that sacrificing billions of individuals for this seems harsh but it is necessary. The souls that I take from these planets amass to but a drop of water against a vast ocean. The universe is massive beyond comprehension. The innumerable multitudes of individuals out there in the vast universe that are constantly plagued by chaos are in desperate need for the peace that this will provide to thrive. This needs to come to pass. I do not tear souls out of whomever I desire disregardingly or for fun, It is done with purpose and not without limitations."
“H-Howard can never have children?” He demanded urgently. He does not know why he was acting this way.
“Firstly Director, I want to make it clear that hiding your thoughts from me is futile. That goes for everyone in this room and on this ship. The fear and concern on this ship is over whelming.” He paused to make Eye contact with everyone.
“Good morning, Babydoll. Did you sleep well?” He whispered into her hair as he pulled her all the way into the bed with him.
Sam got up and started pacing, “It’s fine right?  I mean if there is anyone in the world capable of finding out what’s on that drive and figuring out how to use it Tony Stark can.”  He stated reassuringly trying to keep it together.
“Don’t you see? This is likely what the enemy wants; to fragment us. All the while keeping us occupied so that it could make its escape.”
Tony had also recruited Spider-Man much to Steve’s dismay. The Captain frowned deeply when he heard what Tony had done to convince Peter to join. Though he can’t deny that their web-slinging friend had been a big help on numerous occasions, Steve was immensely uncomfortable with how young Peter is. Regardless the kid made his choice.
He could not see her but he could feel her fingers traced down his face. Her touch felt like fire against his sensationless being. He leaned in almost as if he was desperate to feel again.
The moment the sun broke over the edge of the water in a spectacular and dazzling burst of light Steve took a shuddering breath. The numbness was receding as the overwhelming shock of everything that has happened in the last few weeks began to ebb away. All of the pain began to return in sharp constricting tendrils. Despite everything, Steve managed to deeply enjoy the glorious and magnificent sunrise. It was even more heavenly than the one he witnessed yesterday morning through the dirty window of the lonely forgotten warehouse. Only after the sun was seated upon the glassy surface of the sea did he finally speak.
“Stark, I know we have most of our resources trying to keep track of Calamity but seeing as she can control her visibility to us we need to prioritize now and search for this soldier.”  Fury commanded.
Johnny told Steve about pies long passed from their mother and how Sue could never bake a proper pie, like he could get any closer anyway.
“I… I can’t even describe it.” He whispered. “She spoke of eons and millennia, she’s a powerful and ancient being.” Steve breathed. “And I believe it.”
"Yes, I am, good day!" Steve turned on his heel and briskly walked away the way he came, leaving the concerned shopkeeper behind.
The second reason was more practical. Tony was no stranger to the unbearable fusion of man and machine if his arc reactor was any indication. He also had the stomach for it to a degree, having operated and experimented on himself numerous times, finding ways to merge his own body and Iron Man persona more efficiently.
Having read his medical history the Captain seemed to get out of most skirmishes with nothing but a few inconsequential flesh wounds. Never since coming out of the ice was he ever treated for broken bones, this was serious.
“It’s my fault, Buck. I should have come for you. I should have looked for you!” Steve uttered remorsefully.
“We have been working with the best facial recognition technology we have. Absolutely no hits.” Clint added.
Coulson was hoping that he wouldn’t have to almost die again. It was very painful. In fact he did die on the table four times. Recovery took virtually six months.
This was how Peggy found them later. Eleanor gesculating wildly as she got into the climax of her adventure and Steve listening engrossed as he tried not to burn their breakfast. Both somehow had gotten flour all over them.
After Tony threw the final chair against the wall, he slipped down the opposite wall and put his head in his hands and began to weep.  Steve gingerly approached him and just sat down next to him.  The super soldier just sat and watched as his friend and teammate cried like he never has before.  To be honest Steve doesn’t think he had actually ever seen Tony cry in all the time that he has known him.  He almost had an overwhelming urge to cry along with him but knew he had to be the rock in this situation.  As he started to contemplate this particular situation more thoroughly he had registered big brown eyes staring up at him.
Despite all of its virtues it was an obvious weakness, a glowing beacon screaming “Hey over here! Aim here to kill!” You’d think someone with the title of genius would be smart enough to hide such an obvious vulnerability.
Tony knelt down and began to analyze the makeshift distorter to see if there was anything he could do to make it work better. The folly in his plan became painfully obvious when the mother emitted a strange sound he was unfamiliar with. He looked up at the pseudo-void only to find the mother starring down at him. Her opaque white eyes stared down and burrowed into his very soul.
“Well you know this really annoying guy a told me I should really try to be more aware of my health needs and eat more.” Tony said waving his apple about for emphasis.
Apparently, Barnes had been reprogrammed by one of those brats that got away. The Professor said her power was incredible and quite possibly greater than his own. At this point in time the only thing Xavier could do is soothe the soldier’s mind, to keep reminding him there is still hope. That there is still a reason to fight.
“Five Doom Bots have been wreaking havoc on the outskirts of Goodlettsville Tennessee at a secure research facility.  Sue Storm has informed me that she and the rest of her team are unavailable due to confidential reasons. Your mission is to wipe them out. Stop them from hurting anyone else by any means necessary.  And above all stop them from finding whatever is they’re trying to find.  You have your orders.”  He stated with supreme authority.
Even though they were so close to the thing that was causing all of this chaos, letting it go no matter how painful of a decision was the best option, especially with so little information.  Was it worth the possibility of everyone aboard the ship sub coming to the comas or worse, dying to entrap it? No, it wasn’t.
“I was very surprised to learn of the Directors good health.” Thor stated with an air of bewilderment.
They didn’t get much further than that in their conversation about arm designs, however, due to the fact that Tony mentioned, quite impishly, how he could also create an arm with a sex toy attachment. That of course led to Barnes clapping back by mentioning Tony’s giant Patriotic dildo. Thus, their conversation descended into a raunchy banter. No more work on the arm designs had been done that day. So now, Tony was only working with Barnes’s key points that they managed to come up with before losing focus.
“He is known as the Winter Soldier.  He is credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last 50 years.”  Their eyes widened significantly.
He could hear their jagged intake of air as they prepared themselves for the inevitable. He could hear Bucky’s arm click and whir as he clenched and unclenched his fist in an effort to stay in control despite the overwhelming almost suffocating atmosphere. He could hear his own heartbeat speed up and slow down with every ragged breath he took, in every haggard fleeting thought.
Ten more minutes passed in relative silence. Tony was making a few more adjustments to his calibration when he felt a shift in the Soldiers demeanor. His shoulders slumped and he seemed to sink in on himself just a little. He looked over to Wanda to see if there was any cause for concern, but he only saw that she seemed to be somewhat downtrodden. He looked over the dark-haired man’s shoulder to see what he had stumbled upon this time. When Tony saw what the soldier was looking at he, all at once, realized the cause of this somber mood change. Barnes was looking at some pretty expensive, high-quality art supplies.
"Wilson is already on the battlefield." Tony replied through gritted teeth. "You've seen the footages; the world is begging Captain America for help! Are you really going to let the world believe that someone like Steve abandoned them when they needed him the most? Steve wouldn't do that. Captain America wouldn't do that. Please don't let Steve's legacy die here." Tony pleaded.
‘No!’ Tony pleaded with himself. ‘It’s not going to end here! I won’t allow it! I just got Steve back; I’m not going to lose him again!’
He took a deep breath and allowed himself one last lingering glance at his Captain before snapping the helm and face plate shut on the armor before quickly leaving the infirmary and blasting off into the sky to meet his team on the battlefield.
Steve nodded and began to contemplate everything Calamity had told him especially the fact that she was telling him anything at all.  Why do that?
A/N: And another one bites the dust. This took way too long to write and edit. It's still a little janky but overall I feel like it turned out okay. Only a few chapters left. I hope you all read and stay with me to the very end.
Tony chuckled and shouted 28 to 23 over his shoulder. Out of his peripherals he could see Barnes flipping him off.
“Thor’s here.” Steve smiled a smile that reached his eyes. That damned ridiculous robot didn’t stand a chance.
They sat quietly for a time, Tony with his head in his hands and Barnes practicing his dexterity, tapping each finger to his thumb in sequence.
So the first time I watched Civil War I swear up and down that in that movie Tony’s mother was also called Sarah as well as Steve’s mother. I figured they were trying to do a spoof on the Batman versus Superman movie. But then I go back and watch it and I can’t find it. And I think other people thought the same thing that I did because there were a few fanfiction that I read around the time Civil War came out that had that element, so whatever. It’s kind of important that their mothers have the same name in my story so I’m just going to roll with it.
"Of course you'd create a universe where I didn't exist." He declared in heart pounding anguish then instantaneously disappeared.
Tony nodded almost encouragingly. In all honesty, he felt the same way. There were many, many things that he too must atone for.
Steve only broke out into a wide grin. He knew she probably is the only person in the world that could take him down and likely knew each and every one of his weaknesses. But he couldn’t help it. She was so desperately beautiful, he’d expect nothing less from her fiery personality.
“I’m not going to use this. You trusted Steve’s judgment of us, of me, when you sent this.” He announced contemplatively as he placed the journal back into his satchel.
“Yeah. It was one of the reasons I couldn’t go any further in art school. I could only really do charcoal and ink drawings. No teacher back then wanted to deal with a colorblind kid. They thought I was a joke. What business did someone who couldn’t even see colors properly have with painting and art.” He said with lament. He was not quite sure why he was even telling her all this.
“What… What exactly is going to happen?” Clint questioned morosely, his voice barely above a whisper.
Whatever perverse game Tony was playing was just about to backfire. Steve kissed him back fervently hoping to convince everyone of his supposedly complacency once more.
“Thank you so much for stopping by.  I had been wondering if the kids were all right.”  He said softly.
He moved back up the stairs and just as he was about to reach for the door, three zappers squeezed through the cracks. They emitted a pretty yellow and blue glow as electricity hummed through the fur on their bodies.
Tony barely registered the Rhododendron laughing like a psycho. Before Iron Man could even consider what to do about the hell bird, Captain America's shield suddenly whipped past his helm and embedded itself into the bird, slicing it right down the middle.
“But she would free the others. Please Tony, with this we can save Bruce and the others. Please all I am asking for is your best. I know you can, you’re the only one that can, please.”
They all looked up in shock at his sudden appearance and panic stricken features.  Tony ran right smack into him a moment later.
It didn’t really help that Calamity had been as equally quiet. The total number of cases still remained at 1,039 and as it was the genius was no closer to figuring out Calamity’s code as he was weeks ago. The only real progress he had made, amazingly, was with Barnes.
Steve kinda gawked at them, rather surprised at the levity.  On the other hand it’s probably the best way to handle the situation.
“Tsk, I forgot that traitor takes your side.” Tony stated with a deep frown that morphed into a pout that the Captain could not help but to laugh at. In moments they were both laughing.
As he closed the door to the barn after walking out he still couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he had forgotten something incredibly important. He went through a mental checklist and was sure he had finished all of the errands that he was meant to do today.
And so he fell asleep taking comfort in the fact that he got to spend his last night on earth with his brother safe in his arms, one last time.
Right now, Tony was working on prototypes of a few projects he had in mind to keep himself busy. Though, he figured, if they couldn’t get Barnes lucid, half of them were useless.
“Will do, Sir.” Was Jarvis’s reply as a holographic display of the security entry feed lit up the room.
He opened the glass panel then stepped toe to toe with the suit and let it envelop him. He turned to Barnes, completely somber and serious.
But then he suddenly stopped, deep in thought. “Is it selfish to think that I want to try my hardest to fight Calamity in order to save Jane? There is no place a Midgardian could hide now that Calamity has set her sights on Midgard.” Thor spoke roughly.
A considerable amount of time had passed as I roamed the cosmos at an agonizingly slow pace, unfortunately, I had absolutely no control over where I could go or how fast I could get there. I could only go where the universe took me. In that time, I had wondered about and marveled at all the lovely celestial bodies I was witnessing. The stars and nebulas I could see had always fascinated me and it was no surprise that I had begun to yearn for more. I wanted to be closer, I wanted to know all there was to know about them.
“To think that the full wrath of Asgard was unleashed upon the Miigs, who were wholly undeserving of such a fate… What a pity.” She sighed.
Steve took a deep breath to brace himself. Anybody smart enough to understand basic combat knows that one of the most effective ways to win is to take out the leader. Once Dr. Doom spots him, the Captain will be one of his first targets.
One of the most surprising changes is the world’s tolerance for homosexuality.  Sure there is still much prejudice in the world concerning these subjects, but there is far more tolerance and acceptance now then there ever was back then.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Barton! Were you ever going to tell me or were you just going to let me be a potential threat to this guy and watch as Natasha brutally murders me in cold blood!?”
“That may be so; however until then your mind is my open book. On that same note, Captain Rogers, it may please you to know that whilst you stumbled upon that particular site by a misunderstanding, Mr. Stark here ‘stumbles’ upon that specific site often of his own accord.”
In all honesty, Fury wanted to stop them and keep them on the helicarrier to continue working.  But they were neither his agents nor his employees.  They were just his honored guests and invaluable consultants.  Therefore at this point in time he had no right to keep them.
"It’s nothing. I was just standing in the wrong place at the wrong time when this crazy Alien came in and viciously exploded a Doom bot with enough power to take out a leviathan! Bits of Doom bot went flying everywhere even managing to hit me in the head!” Clint recited with slight irritation, staring pointedly at Thor.
A/N: Sorry about how long it took to get this next chapter to you but here it is, please enjoy! And don’t forget to leave a review at the end of the chapter. Again, sorry for any and all mistakes.
He felt it before anything. Someone came up on him rapidly and made to trip him. He thrusted his shield out as fast as he could. He wanted to grin in triumph, he had just barely managed to nick the guy. He realized then that the man wasn’t invisible, he was fast.
Steve pressed his lips together. His face now rivaled the color of the tomato. He shook his head rapidly and turned on his heel intending to go back to his quarters.
“Bucky!” He started in his deep authoritative voice. Bucky froze and stared at him. “No we don’t.” He stated firmly.
Steve was still full of shock after everything that had transpired that morning.  He was of little use and he hated it.  He dug up a sketchbook and made his way to the lab in which Tony, Hank and Bruce were working.  Tony along with Hank had already sat down with the Professor to go over the energy force Xavier had felt before.  With a few great ideas in mind the two eventually joined by Bruce began working together on analyzing all of the information gathered thus far.
Steve navigated the piles of rubble with light and fast agility, he took out doom bots and fuzz buzz left and right with as little effort as it would to take out a cardboard box.
As a soldier of peace, that was his life mission. However, this mission, he learned, was unachievable. There will always be conflict as long as people are truly free to think for themselves.
"Maybe it's on our side." Barton suggested over the coms. All doubt had been extinguished when it shot Hawkeye off of his perch.
Also, I made a huge change to the summery, let me know if it works better, or if the old one was better.
His feet, however, had somehow led him to the last place in the world he would ever think to look for it. He found himself planted outside Barnes’s assigned quarters.
Tony screamed on the inside. He would rather not have to talk to him at all but Steve is gone and Nat was probably watching him to make sure he did.
He was still kind of getting used to having someone know his every thought.  He’s gonna have to figure out how Magneto acquired such an awesome helmet that repels telepathic abilities. He’s sure if he tried hard enough he could definitely create something to do the same.  But that’s a project for another time.
She smiled, her eyes shining, “This conversation amuses me!  Does it not amuse you Anthony?”  She laughed.
“As long as the others survive, I will be.” He answered almost darkly. “What brings you all the way out here anyway?” Steve eyed him suspiciously.
“Dumbass, they did have sex toys back in the good ole days. Probably been around a couple hundred years before that even.” Barnes snapped.
Tony turned to head back to the lab where they were working before.  Steve followed slowly behind them. He was debating whether or not to go back to the lab with them or to simply go back to his own quarters.  He had a lot of thinking to do.
Steve was about to fall into a deeper sleep until Johnny nudged him.  Steve looked up at him and realized he was staring off to the city.
Both scenarios made him sick as fuck. The tears began to spill unrelentingly. How is this is life? His next thought was by far the most sickening and wretched. He thought with forlorn hope that he couldn’t wait for Calamity to take him. He laid back down and stared at the ceiling.
The doctors would have liked to have done it all in one go but Tony needed the old hardware they had removed to be fully analyzed. Tony knew where the doctors were coming from and agreed to an extent but he doubted his advanced scanners could reach the tiniest and most delicate mechanisms in the bone anchors and he did not want to risk guessing, not with this. Turns out he was right to worry, but did you really doubt our favorite genius?
He found a tree not far off and went to sit under it. He still held Becka in his arms. Johnny followed and sat next to him. The children followed and latched onto them both.
He was thinking about the extent of the abilities of their foe. To be able to put people in those types of comas, did it take extreme effort or was it as simple as breathing? There was no way to know for sure until more information surfaced or until they met the thing face to face. At the very least they are getting closer to figuring out what ever this is.
"Look, you're down, you're not fighting anymore. But you're not out. If I cover you, do you have the capacity to take control of them? We can't fight them all, we can't, that's a fact."
Steve laughed as Tony tried to come up with an excuse as to why he hadn’t thought of it before. In the end Steve owed Tony fifty bucks. There was just no way that Nick Fury was that much of a pleasant social butterfly without a bit of hooch.
He had just finished gently placing the devices on the foreheads of his fallen teammates when Xavier had alerted everybody to convene together to discuss the newest threat. Seconds after that he had gotten several red alerts from Jarvis about odd and peculiar sightings of that stupid bunny.
“I knew that wasn’t going to happen this time. Before, I was alone. Now, I have Tony and the others. I wasn’t going to let you fall. No matter what.”
Tony made his way down to the shooting range all the while resolutely avoiding the curious glances of his teammates he had passed along the way.
“I was just thinking, if you knew it was going to be a losing battle weeks ago, would you still choose to fight or would you sit it out and let the world fall away?” Steve asked.
Tony did not know how long he had been sitting on the cold tile floor of the infirmary listening to the un-even heartbeats of Steve's heart monitor. Each beat played out rhythmically like a glorious hell song. Each wretched heart blip on the monitor was becoming almost imperceptibly slower counting down to the crescendo of the awful song that would inevitably lead to harrowing silence when his heart stopped completely, irrefutably marking the death of Steve Rogers.
Tony let out a shuddering breath as he stood from his position next to Steve's infirmary bed. Another red alert blared in the background and he sighed.
What kind of game was that bastard playing? Was he doing all this to put another notch in his bedpost or was he trying to manipulate him into being okay with his imprisonment?
"Whoa, easy there, Cap!" He said. "Okay one: language and two: you can see me? Well, I mean of course you can see me, but that's not supposed to be-"
Tony slightly offended at her outburst but all the while understanding perhaps what she was thinking quickly went into an explanation.
He had no idea how he was even talking right now. The kids slowly nodded then turned to Johnny hopefully.
That containment field should last fifteen minutes in a state of constant assault. After the fuzz buzz incident, he created this particular containment field to help aid them should something like that happen again. This seems the perfect time to try it out.
“You’re a stupid jerk!” He huffed with a tearful laugh as he pulled his brother into a deep embrace.
“No! Bucky! Please!” His voice cracked at the abuse as he sobbed and pleaded. Bucky slowly looked up and made eye contact with Steve desperately trying to convey a message. It was a reassuring look meant to calm him. Even in this situation Bucky tried to make the whole terrible mountain of a thing look like a molehill. All with one almost cocky look.
In a highly secure underground compound deep in the heart of a restless city the oily fat man began to squirm restlessly with excitement.
“I do trust you Tony, but you know how much I hate being out of the loop on top of being locked away like a caged animal.  You know!”  Steve stressed.
Steve had awaited eagerly the arrival of the special guest. He had been pacing restlessly in his assigned quarters for hours. He ‘was’ pacing restlessly in Tony’s designated temporary work shop aboard the helicarrier before the poor Captain paced his way onto The billionaires last nerve and got himself booted from the workshop. There may have been threats having to do with repulsers and burnt asses but who’s really paying attention at a time like this. Steve sought out Bruce in an attempt to continue his idle pacing however Bruce knowing the Captain so well stopped him before he could start and directed him elsewhere.
“Do you think you’ll need anything?” Tony and asked as he approached Steve and grabbed his shoulder.
“I’ll be happy to assist you Captain.” Ororo Munroe also known as Storm approached Steve with a respectful nod.
Then it all came back to him at once, like a piano falling from a third story window. That vibrant image of his blood pouring down shiny steel plates of a metal arm made his throat close painfully. A metal arm that belonged to…
A little unnerved, Tony spoke to him. “Okay, if that answered your question, are you ready for step two?”
Thor left earlier that morning back to Asgard. That meeting with his father isn’t going to be a fun one. Xavier and his X-Men are in the sick bay discussing what happened yesterday.
"That's just it, Calamity is what we called you because we didn't know who or what you were. I'm sorry I didn't think to ask before now. You do have a name, don't you?"
There was no way they could call for backup either. Thor was in Asgard, the last of the X-Men and trusted SHIELD Agents were either on another mission or specifically ordered to protect the helicarrier and the tower. Tony and his team were on their own.
He gently parked Mary Anne in front. The massive sign above the large storefront window read “Harold’s Ice Cream Parlor” in the same flowing cursive as it had two decades before. Steve sighed in relief, there was something oddly refreshing that the sign was exactly as he remembered it.
First he had to figure out how to disarm him. If he could strike with his shield against his hand at the right moment... That plan went out the window, however, when the soldier in turn disarmed our Captain.
Blood was pouring down the Captains chin and dripping on to the robots claw like hand. He could feel his blood pulsate in his head. His air was becoming steadily more constricted as the bot began to crush his wind pipe.
“My Son, forgive this kind of greeting, but if Calamity came with you, I did not wish to be found unprepared. Even if our efforts would be futile.”
The other agents opened fire on him again. He winced to himself, they were aiming to kill. A bullet grazed his cheek as he went down low tackling the third agent down and elbowing him hard breaking his nose and claiming another KO.
Ah, modern technology: security cameras, video cameras, cell phones, and Wi-Fi, yep, if that woman’s face appears on any of them, well, then let the man hunt begin.
Steve shuddered pleasantly, they were so close. All he would have to do was lean in two inches and claim him. Steve took a deep breath and calmed himself. Instead he leaned forward and gently tapped his forehead against Tony’s. The genius backed up a little shocked while Steve smirked at him. He didn’t do it hard enough to hurt, just enough to make Tony back away. It was only a warning.
"That wasn't all." She assessed. "There was one thing you came to realize that finally shattered my illusion."
But no! He just had to be a jackass and jerk around with Tony's emotions. He knew deep down he truly trusted Tony with everything. Tony was this unique, quirky, enigmatic, genius asshole that he couldn't help falling in love with and yet Steve managed to fuck it all up.
The black haze still lingered in his mind and pressed hard against his consciousness. Somehow, he knew this was all wrong. His head hurt and his wrist burned.
Tony rolled his neck and shrugged his shoulders before recounting exactly what had transpired the last week or so since the events of San Jose in a spectacular display of word vomit. By the end of it he was sure his team probably only got about half of that.
“Thank You ‘Man of Iron.’ My friends Tis good to see you all!” The handsome golden haired man exclaimed as soon as he appeared on the screen.
It took a little over an hour to finally reached the factory.  The screams of his team had died down but from what he could tell they were still alive.  He hoped.
He looked at her in dismal fear, what would she think of him? He knows logically that she wouldn’t care, but what if she did? To thank Steve Rogers nearly kissed another man?!
“Have you been paying attention to the news as of late? Adverse cases have been popping up for the past two weeks, they’re very troubling.” Steve finally stated looking a bit perturbed.
Admittedly, he had realized at various times that she had to be pulling the strings. He just could not truly fathom at the time just how deep she was into everything that had happened. She was the reason why he and Tony had fought in the first place.
“Wait, wait, wait, hold on. You mean all that trouble with figuring out the data she gave you was just to get her energy signature?” Barnes asked incredulously.
He winced a little as Bucky went over the worst parts of his abdomen. He had to really pinch some sections back together a bit harder to ensure a proper stitch. He stared at the blood now on Bucky’s steel hand. It was oddly mesmerizing.
He said to just hold on. He could do that, couldn’t he? Even if his vision was going black around the edges…
That imaginary fist in his chest turned into a jagged knife when his opponent pinned him with a glare, a glare that he had been on the receiving end before. So long ago…
In minutes they were rolling around on the dirty floor of the old factory fighting over the sketchbook, to the utter amusement of the twins, squabbling like the brothers they were.
He had to think of something quick. He continued to dart through the alleyways still keeping on alert. He thought he heard something as he rounded the corner and made his way to an older section of the city, residential.
He swallowed thickly, Steve's limp body still in his arms, felt heavier and heavier by the minute. It was as if it symbolized the weight that was the fate of humanity, and in a twisted way it really was.
Heart… It was a heart; the arc reactor was like heart. Artificial heart... Why was that so familiar?
Tony choked back the sob that tried to claw its way out of his chest. Not yet, he was not done yet. When everything was all said and done, he could break down then. But not now, not yet.
‘Shit!’ They may be close to the surface but are still a very considerable distance away from the tower!
They ate peacefully for a time. Wanda leaned in closer to her brother and Steve smiled at them. When he was finished Steve scooted back against a crate and sighed heavily. Bucky watched his movements intently.
“She said she would release everybody and make it like she was never here as long… As long as she got to keep her Keystone.”
Steve dove through the air head first with his shield that is front.  He managed to slice through the arm of one of the bots.  The appendage fell to the ground beside the robot becoming completely useless.  As the bot seemed to look down upon its arm seemingly in horror the Captain whipped around and flung his shield severing its robotic head.  As soon as Steve caught the shield he darted off into the facility, leaving Natasha and Clint to deal with the remaining two outside.
The giant zapper was becoming unstable now that the crazy guy was no longer controlling it.  If a blew up it could take out the whole city.
Unfortunately, Steve couldn’t finish for he was in fact pushed off the helicarrier by Tony.  The genius began to laugh as he raced to catch up and catch Steve.  The bay doors closing behind him.
Steve could barely process anything that was happening. He was shaking uncontrollably, the truth was just behind a piece of steel and leather. The soldiers scream had nearly unhinged him. Steve has heard that scream in his nightmares for years.
She shook her head. "I'm afraid not, although…" She tilted the sketchbook this way and that. "The shape of the head could almost be Howard." She laughed.
Steve swallowed again. He knew from the burning sensation deep in his throat any attempt to utter a sound would be perdition.
Bucky shook his head. “That was sloppy.” He muttered. Before Tony could reply the soldier continued. “My arm throws me off balance.” He said gesturing to the missing one.
“Because, it’s the end of the world. There’s no way in hell you are going to let yourself take a backseat for that. Look,” Tony sighed heavily and turned around. “I know getting experimented on is like the last thing you want to even experience again. Trust me, I know.” He could not stress enough how he really knew. “But, I desperately need your help.” He stated finally.
“You’re reckless Steve. Do you honestly believe you would have been fine just sitting on the sidelines without us forcing you!?”
He thought harder, the last thing he definitely remembered was… Crashing the Valkyrie into the water.
They held their gaze as Steve began to lean closer, their noses touching softly.  Both were hoping to convey everything they were feeling through this deeply tender contact.  Just as Steve was about to take that final leap and press his full lips onto Tony’s firm ones, he froze momentarily before whipping around abruptly, quickly pulling Tony behind him, shielding the genius from their new visitor.
“Keep on that Mr. Stark.” Fury replied willing himself not to pull out one of the various weapons concealed on his person.
Then one day I guess they got tired of me just standing there staring, so they invited me to play.  I agreed only to get to the bottom of that mystery, why the hell they were so damn happy all the time.  They had introduced me to their mother, she was so kind and sweet I thought she was trying to trick me or something.  I kind of made a game of it.  She made homemade cookies and fresh squeezed lemonade and then there was pie day…”   Tony paused for a moment obviously reminiscing about that lady’s pie.
This was how the Rhododendron was able to accomplish all these fantastical, horrible and seemingly impossible things. She was helping him…
It really hurt the Captain to see this man in this state. Steve reached out and grasped the man on the shoulder. The man flinched and backed away.
‘Holy shit…’ most thought. They all nodded in agreement to Tony's question. Fury was pissed that he had actually let his emotions get in the way of making the proper decisions of a leader. He felt shitty, he couldn’t even blame it of Loki’s evil glow stick of death this time…Or could he... Nope, Nope, Nope. This was all him. They were so lucky to have Captain America looking out for them. They might end up utterly fucked if he wasn’t.
“See! I had to keep it from you before you went and did something stupid again! I can’t lose you like that.”
The machine came to a halt and Ellie cheered and waved to her adoring fans as she dismounted gracefully.
A/N: So here it is, we got a lot of little stuff happening here but all of it rather necessary.  I apologize for any and all errors.  Enjoy!
Oh boy did that idea backfire. He detested doing the dishes and logically she probably knows that. He smiled wistfully to himself however, at least she’s not standing there doing them.
The bastards laughter was drowned out, however, by Iron Man’s weapons fracturing the earth beneath them as Hawkeye barely managed to escape another onslaught.
This was the moment he was dreading most. All of the thoughts he was avoiding, all of the nightmares he had been having, all collated to this moment. Now that his biggest goal was out of the way there was nothing left to distract him from his disturbing truth. Tony was responsible for Steve’s fate. Not just his terrible involvement in breaking the Captain’s spirit enough for Calamity to claim him, but also the fact that the moment he frees everyone from their comas, Steve will belong to Calamity forever, eternally condemning him to a life of possible servitude or worse.
“Please.” He repeated again. “Don’t let him die.” He uttered brokenly, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Don’t worry, once you make it into town you can’t miss it.” She smiled as she handed the slip of paper to Steve.
Steve looked on as Tony’s head started to noticeably inflate. Due to the considerable expansion of his head new ideas, formulas and schematics started popping up in his mind. The crazy genius then started to wander off to execute some of these innovative ideas.
It had been a little over an hour since Bucky had stitched him back up and Steve had planted himself in front of the dirty window with his sketchbook in hand and lightly traced what he could make out of the sunrise over the horizon.
Tony hummed in agreement. ‘Yeah, paved path.’ He thought sarcastically. “More like haunted treacherous volcano cliff of doom.” He muttered.
Steve decided then and there, that if they all make it somehow against all odds, he was definitely taking Tony up on that vacation offer. Seriously, the genius wouldn’t have to bribe him or trick him. Nope he’d be ready with bells on.
The irksome part was the fact that the assassination happened so close to Steve and involving him so dangerously only days after his suicidal near death experience, landed him back on house arrest (for his own safety of course.) In addition to that it was Tony’s idea.
“This thing is pretty much a super soldier pain reliever.” Tony replied. Bucky stared at him. “Stop doing that! Look, it will work like best fucking aspirin you’ve ever taken. Since you can’t actually take medicinal pain relievers because of your metabolism this device will block the pain receptors in your brain on a neurological level by manipulating the electricity in your neurons.”
She turned her attention to him fully and tilted her head to peer up at him, his question clearly catching her off guard.
That’s what he really wanted to say but the strain on his brain was too much. And in any case he knew Barton would find a more inventive way in if he didn’t allow him access now.
