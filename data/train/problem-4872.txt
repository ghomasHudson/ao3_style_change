Cas nods, wondering if Jimmy’s awake or he’s cried himself to sleep or something.
“Absolutely.” He smiles and I smile back.
“We have been otherwise withholding all major details of our plan, but we are going to reveal such details to all of you today. It is necessary that we complete last preparations and have an operation in place.” Blondie adds, and Dean sees Cas tense up next to him.
It doesn’t take too long for them to get dressed and Dean ends up forcing Cas to go sit in the living room rather than help him with the bed sheets. Dean doesn’t know how to convince him that it’s not a big deal. He knows Cas is embarrassed about it but it’s
“He sure is.” Cas strokes Jimmy’s hair with a smile.
He draws in a shaky breath and nods, wiping his eyes again. “It’s enough for me too.” He admits.
“I have no idea if I’m tired enough to go back to sleep.” Cas admits, turning his head to look at Dean. “I thought I was tired but now I’m not sure.”
her son. She didn’t want him and she chose to forget about him since the day he was born. Cas worries that he’s being too harsh but…she never even
“It’s twenty four now.” Alfie laughs, scrolling on his phone. “We explained the whole thing and apparently the higher managers are looking into it.”
“Okay. And is he responsive at all?” Paula questions, taking Cas’ hand gently to find his pulse.
“If only we packed spare clothes.” He mumbles, pinching his cold, ice-soaked pants that are sticking to him from falling over multiple times along with the time we fell down together.
“Yep, that’s us.” I confirm, and we approach the woman. Cas seems to be dragging his feet more than usual. He
A smile immediately pulls across my face and I laugh in amazement, taking the boxes from Alex carefully.
fight back for a while, Dean, but things got bad. There really were no options left, and besides, it’s all different now. Things aren’t the same.” He looks up at him still standing by the door. “The Cas you know is gone, I’m afraid.”
“You’re overheated.” Dean pointed out quietly, letting him sit on the couch while he went to the kitchen. He came back with a glass of water, handing it to Cas before sitting next to him, trying to make eye contact. Cas didn’t comply, but he did sip at the water.
“I-well, he had sex with me?” I ask as a sort of question.
“We’re gonna go in there, get those blades, and we’ll be straight out. It’s going to be fine.”
Cas’ emotional rollercoaster going off the rails with the new sensations. I
“Is he gonna be okay?” Dean questions, watching Steve leave the house to get a stretcher to put Cas on or something.
“Love you too.”
I move away from Cas and he looks at me with those blue orbs. “Come back to me, Dean.” He pleads, and I’m sure as hell planning on doing that.
He hung up without hesitating, climbing under the cube-shaped climbing frame to sit underneath it. It had a slide at the top so there were tightly-fitted wood planks covering his head at least.
Dean ducks when a werewolf takes a swing at him with its long fingernails. Nichols swipes her machete across its neck. The werewolf’s head parts from its shoulders and lands of the muddy grass with a thud.
“I’m not gonna tell him straight away.” Dean decides. He doesn’t want to tell Cas that he’s going to have to make do all night, even with a fever. “And guys, what do I do about Jimmy? He can’t be here tonight, right? I need to be with Cas.”
Cas knows he’ll be tired tomorrow, but seeing Jimmy helped him get over his nightmare. His son is
There is an air of relief in the tense atmosphere between them, but there is still that sense of lingering worry.
Once Cas had had a minute to rest and catch his breath, Dean shifted a little. “Come on, you don’t wanna sleep here. Let’s get to bed.” He hoisted Cas up carefully and moved them towards the bed.
“What, no! We can’t-“ Crowley cuts me off.
When the song finishes (all too soon in my opinion - this is the best entertainment I’ve ever had…ever), Cas stretches his arm that is holding the microphone out to the side and drops it dramatically as if he's saying
“Nah, it’s ok. Gimme five buddy.” I say, holding my hand up and Mickey swings his small hand onto mine.
“Man, I shouldn’t have made you eat.” Dean sighs guiltily, rubbing Cas’ back.
?” Dean jabs at Cas’ arm with his fingers, pleased with his revenge. Cas walked right into that awkward speech he made, and left Dean the
“Alrighty.” I agree, and we start walking through the trees. Well,
Sam also stands up and stalks over to me. “Hey Cas.”
“Hey.” Someone wearing red overalls strolls up to the table, practically
“Daddy hit his head and his chest, which hurt his ribs. It even broke one.” Dean explains, jabbing Jimmy in the side. “Ribs are the bones right here.” Dean jabs him again playfully which makes Jimmy giggle.
appreciate what she does for me.”
“Better.” He smiles, folding the wire around the headphones. “Much better.”
“This compound is inside me now. There’s no going back. I-” another cough “I may as well see it through to the best of my ability.”
“The Sector D physical test scoreboard put Cas and Roan together in a fighting ring. Cas won pretty easy and people laughed at Roan because he’d been smug, saying he’d win against Cas with no effort.” Gus explains. “So later that night, Roan finds Cas and beats him up bad. The angels had to drag him off Cas and they removed Roan from Sector D for it. He’s still pissed to this day. He blames Cas for everything, of course.”
Cas tilts his head, amused with Dean’s awkward approach to the subject. “You mean have I gotten randomly hard? Been randomly horny?”
I see no other option but to sit up slowly, pulling Cas gently along with me. He’s clinging to me but his body is still limp from being half asleep. His hair is flattened down on one side where he was lying, and he lets out a small, quiet groan when I move him. His eyes are still closed and I put my hand on his forehead. The temperature is much lower than yesterday which is awesome. The first step was to get that fever the hell out of here.
“I’m making it up to you.” I mutter gently, watching the last light of the sun disappear and the stars start appearing.
“So I didn’t tease you too much? It took you quite a while to recover.” Dean adds.
I nod before me and my brother make a joint effort of getting Cas out of his shirt. We can’t exactly leave him sitting in a puddle of his own vomit, can we? He doesn’t seem to be very responsive to what we are doing. Maybe he’s just in shock; having an experience like this one will do that to you.
They reach the right floor and find the ward where Naomi is. Cas pushes himself all the way there, not allowing his legs to stop moving.
I find that I have landed on top of Cas, our coat-clad chests flush together and our faces inches apart. He carries on laughing, but I shut him up when I press a gentle kiss to his lips.
“How were
“I’m going with Dean.” He said with a surprisingly small voice. He couldn’t help it. He felt small.
“You’ve been tense and frustrated for so long, Cas. Everyone can see it including me, and I’ve been here for less than two days. Are the thoughts you keep getting the reason for it? Or…is it something else?”
. Dean thinks that he’s been feeling like this for so long that he’s used to it and even though it feels normal to him, he’s actually really not good.
might seem closed off at first but…I know that with time, he’ll let you in. Just give him time. I know how I used to be back in the time you’re from. Your Cas needs to know all of the things
“Hmm?”
“I suppose we don’t want to freak anyone out.”
Cas’ buzzing phone draws him from his thoughts. When he sees the caller ID, it is a number he is expecting the very least. Yet, he answers the call.
“I’ll go out and wait for the taxi.” Gabe decides, obviously letting them have a moment to themselves.
“I did.” Dean smiles, lips pulled into a gentle smile. “Food was good, company was good, everything was good, so…yeah, I’m pretty happy, Cas.”
“That your dad left before you went to college and he…um…he never ‘warmed’ to you, in Gabe’s words.” Dean explains. “He said that you told your dad you liked dudes and he shut you out. And he was a dick to you.” The more Dean talks about Cas’ dad, the more he realizes that he should have asked Gabe to stop talking. It seems quite personal to Cas and he should have let him talk about it in his own time.
He expected Dean to move away because he was so still, but his friend continued, and soon Cas moved his mouth just a little, relaxing.
“Label?”
“You ready to head back, Cas?” He questions.
Roan blinks at him, pretending to be unfazed by his comment, but Dean sees a small flicker of fire behind his eyes. Dean’s actually surprised that he doesn’t bite back; the man just remains calm and collected, moving slowly like he’s thought about every centimeter of movement beforehand.
“Exactly.” Dean hums. “I love you anyway. So much.”
“Well, if he does, we’ll deal with it together.” Dean tells him, voice upbeat like usual. Cas smiles up at him. “Come on, let’s go get some quick lunch.”
I am jolted awake, my heart beating wildly. I think I just had a nightmare, which was well….really quite terrifying. I was alone again. No Dean or Sam, just me. I was injured and helpless, listening my brother’s tormenting laugh echoing through the room I was in inside the dream.
Although, this does at least confirm my suspicions about the last time we got close like this. Cas really
“I know. I know, I’m sorry.” He soothes rubbing her back while the rest of us gape at the scene unfolding before us.
Currently, Sam is up front with me and Cas is in the back, huddled up in the same clothes as yesterday and Sam’s giant hoodie. He’s buried in it and it’s kind of cute.
“Oh would you just come here already?” She asks, opening her arms. I hug her back happily and squeeze her shoulders.
“I’m s-sorry.” He mumbled as Dean guided him into the back seat before slipping in himself.
He was halfway slipping his coat off when he saw Cas go still then sway to the side and quickly put his hand on the side of the breakfast bar to stop himself going any further.
Dean beams at Cas and takes hold of his hand, starting to lead him up the beach.
Cas joins Jimmy in feeling sorry for it and jumps a little when there is a voice behind them. Turns out it’s Dean with one of the shop assistants.
Cas didn’t complain for one second like Dean had done though. It really must be his daily routine. He actually looks quite good in the overalls too. The navy brings out the blue in his eyes.
Dean nodded in understanding.
“Then it’ll be looking at us with those freaky eyes.” Cas reasons.
“Okay.” Gabe turns to Bartholomew instead. “
“Yeah.”
Thankful that we got through that without any major awkwardness, I help Castiel out of the bathroom and get him back to bed. Also, as if on cue, Sam bursts through the door with like, three shopping bags.
After tucking myself back into my pants, I retreat to the bathroom to fix my hair (we won’t need to fix Cas’ though because he always looks like he just had sex anyway) and get some wet wipes to clean myself up. To be fair, there isn’t a lot of come on me because I swallowed all of Cas’, but the angel is covered in mine.
He wonders
“Well, I don’t have much to do at the minute so I thought I’d come see what you two were doing.”
His son blinks at him, all soft and relaxed now. Cas is glad that he didn’t get too worked up.
I consider saying I can’t leave Cas but she clearly needs to speak about something in private, so I stand and let go of Cas’ clammy hand. He is reluctant to let go, but does it when I assure him that I’m right outside and I’ll be back in a second.
I don’t want to know what’ll happen if tomorrow doesn’t go well. Will one of us die? What if all of us die? No, I’m not going to think about it. I’m going to enjoy tonight with Cas.
I don’t understand why I’m scared. I’m uncomfortable too, like, I just want to move away immediately.
As he’s looking kind of down, I sit next to him and put my arm around him. “Hey, how ya feeling buddy?” He only flinches a little.
I return to his side and pull his hands away from the beam. He goes to hit me again, but I catch his fist in time. He tries to hit me with his other fist but I catch that one too because he is considerably weaker than before, and I manage to pry his fingers open until they are interlocked with my own.
Being done with the conversation, Dean nods and turns around, scanning the rooms as he walks down the corridor to see they’re all labelled with G. Ground floor, right? And that means if he’s on the ground floor, he needs to get all the way up the stairs to floor D.
Dean smiles and leans to kiss him again.
“Is it one of your angel women? Or one of your angel
“I have no idea. I just thought reasoning with him might work rather than shouting at him.” He explains, taking in a deep breath in an attempt to ease the aching in his chest.
“Yeah, something like that. But um…yeah, that’s all that happened really.”
I run my hand through his hair and Cas starts to empty his bladder.
Cas pops the pills into his mouth and manages to drink them down even though he’s on his back.
“We did, yeah.” Cas smiles at her. Every time he blinks, his eyes feel more and more tired.
Cas nods in between catching his breath. He accepts the cloth from Anna to wipe his mouth.
At the end of the day, it could have led to Cas getting badly hurt if he had to scramble to find Jimmy outside. Dean has to be honest even though the kid’s eyes fill with tears.
“Go for it, sunshine.” Dean laughs at that and steers Cas over to the toilet instead of the door.
“…do-do you want me here?” He whispers it so he doesn’t wake Sam up.
ass’??? It sounds filthy.”
“Love you too.” I smile, “now go! Get in the shower before Sam beats you to it cause he takes forever to put all that conditioner shit in his hair.”
for it when I hadn’t done anything wrong. And so, growing up, I had to go through you deliberately not seeing me whenever you could, shunning me, shouting at me, putting me down, and all of that was because of, what, because I simply existed? Because you got pregnant and had me? How was that ever
“So, I was thinking we should go back to Indiana. That’s where the vic was. You know, the one who was killed with one of the knives. We could check in to the same motel and then cast the location spell. That’ll lead us to the angel that has the other daggers.”
“Not helping, Cas.” I mutter, but still appreciating his choice of wording.
We’ve just been and got takeout – we didn’t feel like sitting in a rowdy diner. Well actually, I’ll rephrase that,
question just showed an absence of tact. Gabe would never intentionally make Cas uncomfortable – he’s a good brother to Cas and he would never do anything to hurt him. Dean can see that for sure.
“Go check on Cas, make sure he keeps breathing slowly.” Dean shrugs and Gabe nods. He leaves the bathroom. Dean turns back to Jimmy. “Jimmy, daddy didn’t mean to shout at you. He was just worried about you, that’s all.”
“Hey, hey, open your eyes.” Dean tells him, voice restrained from the lump in his throat. “Look at the sky. Look up.” Cas’ eyes open slowly and he fixes them above him, seeing the healthy blue colour up there. “You did that. That was
you. I’m not following the light anymore; I’m walking with it. And it’s
Cas manages to hold on just long enough before he’s sick into the bucket, holding on to Dean’s hand at the far edge of the bucket so tightly his knuckles go white.
Dean shoves him back. “Cas is alive you fucking idiot.”
“Cas, you’ve managed to get yourself a raging boner. Well done.” He chuckles again, and I shove him with my elbow before sitting up and leaning against the headboard.
. Dean is in a rage now. How could Cas do that? What if Dean gets switched back with other-Dean and he finds out Cas is doing this. What would
“DON’T SPEAK TO ME. I’M FED UP OF ALL OF THE BULLSHIT. MAKE YOUR DAMN MIND UP, DEAN! DO YOU REALLY WANT ME GONE??” He punches the wooden beam hard.
“It’s not your fault, Cas. It’s not.” Dean doesn’t give him chance to protest before he continues the story. “So yeah, then I picked him up and went to find you. You were at the bottom of the stairs knocked out and your shirt was half way up your chest so I could some bruises starting to form on your ribs.
“Thanks.” Cas laughs quietly, voice deep from being asleep. “Dean, I- please can you help me up.”
“All of this fear and terror, it’s not because of what they did to you, is it? It’s because of how you’re feeling about yourself. The nightmares, the insecurity, it’s because of how you’re thinking.”
Dean notices Rachel sitting across from him on the table with her palm covering her eyes as she shakes her head. He wonders whether she’s used to her many children being embarrassing in public.
a lot of other stuff to him as well no doubt.” He mutters quietly, making me flush a dark shade of red.
“I dunno. Just didn’t come up. It’s just the occasional one-off thing though. Like, my preference is still to marry a girl and have kids but…yeah, I’ve done things.” Gabe explains.
I squeeze Cas’ hand and he grips back. Maybe he likes me as more than a friend too? It would explain a lot, but what if that’s just Cas being Cas? He’s always been closer to me than he needs to be. I just don’t know anymore.
to make this better. He’s just
“Does he know you love him yet?” Angela smiled, scribbling down a few notes for future reference.
I use one of my hands to massage his balls again while I open wide and take as much of him down as I can. He lets out one of the hottest moans I have ever heard and after that, I make it my goal to make him make that noise again and again.
“You really think playing God was the right thing to do? No, me neither.”
“Really?”
Cas dips his finger into Jimmy’s pull up when he squirms.
“Hey.” Dean smiled as he approached from the path.
Jimmy nods again, sitting between them on the bed. “What’s today?”
A ball of snow hits my face, breaking and sending pieces of snow flying everywhere.
He looks into his own eyes. He remembers when he looked into a bathroom mirror at the therapy session when he first told Angela everything about Naomi. A lot of time has indeed passed since then. He’s thirty. He’s an adult now.
Even though they fell asleep late afternoon, Jimmy seems to be getting tired again already. Dean appears to have made him some food too, so soon he’ll probably be ready for bed.
Pulling the chair closer to the bath tub, I sit down and watch Cas stare at nothing in particular, clearly in a bit of shock from everything that just happened.
I put my hand on his cheek and stare at his eyes desperately. Come on come on come on.
“I made a mistake.” He admits. He sounds terrible right now.
Who knows.
Jimmy’s reply is reluctant but he nods.
“Shall we get gone?” I ask, noticing Sam has also finished his smoothie.
Sam unlocks our door and leaves me to sulk on my own, refusing to let myself recognise he has a point.
“Really?”
Sam reads.
“Alright gentlemen. We’re clearing up in half an hour but everything is being taken to the morgue. You can check things out there too if you like. One of your guys is already here so I’m sure he’ll fill you in.”
Everything's going to be okay, and now I have relieved my stress, I can go back to helping other people.
Dean smiles. “Yeah, I will. I will buddy.”
“Jack wanted to go to the back but there were people.” He explains, avoiding eye contact.
“In a good way, I hope?” Dean chuckles.
“You been having issues?” Gabe raises an eyebrow.
“Later today. The battle. Because, well…you already know, don’t you? Cas is gonna blow himself up.”
His cheeks are rosy from the cold, but I’m sure he’s all warm inside like me.
With Dean’s hand on his back, he finally starts to push himself up. An indescribable rush of pain shoots through his chest; his ribs.
Dean was aware of small movements like Cas resting his head on his shoulder. Cas was also fiddling with one of the buttons on his jacket like it was the most interesting thing in the world – Dean could feel a small tug every so often when Cas twisted the button between his fingers. He didn’t mind; he just admired Cas’ little frown, finding his heavy concentration on such a small thing quite cute.
“You did once. In one of his nightmares. I think that’s where all of this is coming from.”
“Sure, course you can.” Cas places his hand on top of Jimmy’s head. “Are you two going to play games with your cousins? I heard that Kiara has a twister mat. Oh and apparently Lucy has a Christmas toy game you can all play.”
“Dean, we need to stop.” Sam decides, starting to panic, but I’m already on it, changing lanes again so we can pull off on to the next gas station.
“Dean, you have to realize that, should you die here, you will also die in your own reality as well. Last time you moved timelines, Zachariah had told you he would look after you. This time, the angel or being who did this to you may not be so kind. You need to keep down and do as you are told.”
Breathing heavily, I let my arms and legs give way, flopping down on the bed next to Cas. He looks completely dazed, just sitting there breathing like that.
“Um, yeah that.” I smile and hear Sam giggle behind me. I have to elbow him to make him stop and ruin my perfect lying.
He nods and Sam circles us, supporting Cas under his arms and hauling him up out of my lap.
“How is he?” My brother whispers, crouching down next to the bed so he is more or less at eye level with me.  I’m sort of half sitting against the headboard and half lying down. Just comfy to be honest.
I turn back to the Liliel and see her laughing.
Cas must have got zapped with him, right? Surely.
He really is so innocent, like, white boxer shorts are the most innocent thing you can get.
Dean blinks a few times to adjust to the light and sees Cas on the floor. He’s breathing.
“What’s your type then?”
While he’s washing his hands, he can’t help but wonder how today is going to go. Will it go well? How will Cas be throughout the day? Will his hands be shaking? Will they need to leave part way through?
Cas smiled at that, feeling a little bit excited. If they both confessed they loved each other then they could say they were
We were thinking of watching a movie instead or something while we eat our food. We’re doing it in Sam’s room tonight though. I didn’t want our room smelling of food while we’re trying to sleep. In other words, Sam drew the short straw.
“But I’m Dean Winchester. I’m useful.”
Cas nods, starting to get sleepy again. He feels
The whole plot of the epilogue was inspired by 'Heaven in Your Eyes' by Loverboy (as you can see form the title), so maybe you'd like to listen to it by clicking below (I really hope the link works ahaha) v v v
“Dean, look at these.” Cas points to a bowl of bracelets, all sea themed. Dean wanders over and stands next to him, digging around in the bowl.
“Charlie glances around, “where’s Sam?”
“Yes, Dean. And it’s a military base, not a…not what you said.”
Cas sits up, looking into his eyes. “If you want to stay here and help out, I don’t mind. I can drop Nicky off at your mom’s or something.”
Dean has been amazing though. Cas doesn’t know what to do with the amount of love he has for that man. He’s patient, he’s kind, he looked after Cas when he most needed it. He
Kate squints at him and rolls her eyes again. “Yeah, whatever. You should get to your room before count. It’s an important one today. They have no idea how many we lost to those bastards.”
“I kind of dragged you out of bed.” I chuckle nervously , rubbing the back of my neck.
“Damn hard. But at least it’s not boring.” She laughs then goes over to meet Charlie.
I turn up the radio when Led Zeppelin starts playing, tapping on the steering wheel in time to the beat.
“…do you mind if I rest for a while?” He asks as he places the water on the bedside table.
“Cas not being into food? I’ve only heard small bits here and there from mom but I don’t actually know what’s happening.” Gabriel asks as he collects his ingredients and a pan.
“It’s Cas, while you were in the shower, he told me about some things he was feeling.”
He shook his head in a hopeless attempt to clear his thoughts. It never worked.
“Uncle Gabe can we go to the back and look out there?” Jack asks, gazing up at him hopefully.
“When did you get here?” He asks none of them in particular.
I’m just glad he’s ok.
They receive another meow before the little fur ball climbs over to sit on Cas.
, but we were thinking of trying to talk to Luke about it.” He admits.
When I return, Cas is still sitting in the chair, staring at his reflection in the mirror. I step in front of the mirror, blocking his view because that’s what started to freak him out in the shower. He looks up at me before I haul him up from underneath his arms so I can help him get dryer.
“And?”
“How?” Cas frowns.
“Are we all ready to order?” The waitress asks which seems to end the conversation. Cas has never told him about some of those things. He knew that Cas’ siblings looked after him but not to that extent. Their mom must have been
that he needs a doctor. Dean feels sorry for Cas, but he feels proud that Cas isn’t downplaying what he needs.
He looked down at his friend’s slightly shy, expectant gaze. Should he go for it?
I chant in my head as a sort of mantra to make myself disgusted. That’s what they say, right? Think of something you hate to turn you off.
Gabe snorts and Cas hears the faint clicking of an indicator. “Well?”
hurt?
“Because you do.” Dean huffs a laugh, but Cas can tell by the tone of his voice that he’s sympathetic.
as the door closes.
Cas nods and smiles, “yeah.”
Dean hums. “Awesome. They sound nice.”
“Alright. Do you want to talk now or leave it ‘til a bit later in the session?”
say something gross so I can just get it out.” Cas looks at him helplessly, waiting for his answer. “I just want to get it over with.”
“Have you been masturbating? Ever since I haven’t been able to do anything?” Cas wonders, purely out of interest.
Dean may as well have gasped.
“You think I don’t already know that? I feel crappy enough for treating him like a piece of shit before, and now this? He thinks I hate him and want him gone? I have never felt so proud of myself.” I finish, the sarcasm in my voice so thick you could cut it with a knife.
Dean moved to his neck when Cas had tilted his head all the way to the side, allowing his boyfriend the room to suck on the skin there. Cas felt Dean flatten his palm on his chest before moving it down the centre then back up again slowly. His fingers grazed over his hardening nipples over the material of his hoodie and he gasped quietly at the feeling as a small flash of electricity that shot through his body.
Cas adds, making eye contact with her now. “And even though all those years ago you said it’d be good that I can’t ‘reproduce’, well, I did. And now, along with Dean, I am a father to the most beautiful, kind child who you will never be able to meet.” He admits. Deep down, he’s always known despite any circumstance, he will never allow Naomi to meet Nicky nor know his name. She, indeed, doesn’t deserve it.
“Cas, are you sure you’re ok, you look exhausted.” I tell him.
Cas cleared his throat. “Good. I handed in one of my writing pieces today. My lecturer’s looking forward to reading it.”
The nightmare had the courtesy of showing him what things would be like if he didn’t have Dean. He was on the street, all alone in the rain and in the mud and cold and alone alone alone- what would he do if something happened to Dean? What…what would he do??
“The thought of getting it on
“Got you some grape juice and some water.” He explains. “Try and drink the juice first so you can get your blood sugar up.” Dean takes the straw out of the plastic wrapper and pokes it into the carton. Cas takes it with a shaky hand. “I’ll get something just in case you need to be sick again, okay?”
I crawl on to the bed and place my hand on his back to make him at least stir. “Cas.” I whisper gently. “We need to get going.”
And then everything goes quiet. Just like that.
“How so?”
“I didn’t think you would.” He says. “They put you on a stretcher and took you away in the ambulance with the sirens and the lights and the whole shebang. I would have gone with you, but I had Jimmy and he was still crying and it didn’t feel right to make him sit around in a hospital.”
. Thank:
“Is he ok now?”
This time he hears me, but still murmurs something unintelligible.
“Um, let’s go?”
“Thanks for telling me.” I run my hand through his hair to help him relax. Like last time, he’s not chilled enough so he can’t pee. It’s a pretty simple concept to be honest. Tense equals nope. Relaxed equals fountain.
“I’ll admit, I get down sometimes. And when I do get down, I get really
have to change, too.” He holds up a pair of navy blue overalls. The same ones some of the others were wearing in the corridor before.
Cas runs his hand up and down Jimmy’s back slowly, “Jimmy, wake up.”
Everyone is sitting around the tree with full stomachs and hot drinks, and it is nearly time to give Cas my gift. I’m a little nervous, but I know that everything will be fine.
love Elton more.”
what he
“Yeah.” He mumbles.
“Promise me you’ll tell me if something’s wrong.”
His son tugs on the leg of his jeans, looking up at him with his big blue eyes. “Uh, yeah, sorry, just a second sweetheart.” He speaks down to Nicky softly, placing a hand flat on the top of his head.
“Mom, just-”
“You’ve always liked that.” Dean hums.
Dean nipped at his earlobe then moved back to his mouth, kissing hard. They breathed the same air through the heavy kisses. When he felt Dean’s hand moving down his chest again, Cas wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s back, splaying his hands and raking his fingernails down across the thin material of his shirt.
They stare at each other for a good few moments, lying in their separate beds. Cas is giving him a really
“I can’t comprehend why all of these chemicals are needed in a carbohydrate bar. The oats themselves are really quite alright on their own.” The angel claims, taking a small bite from the part that is unwrapped.
We do eventually get the tree back to the bunker, but a considerable amount of time has passed and me and Cas are exhausted.
“Seriously though, get to your room. Management will be out in ten minutes for count.”
“Then do that too. Naomi can’t keep locking you away, Cas, and you know it. This is your chance to get away, yeah?”
During the quiet talking, Jimmy falls asleep at some point, and is not woken when Sam pokes his head through the door followed my mom.
We pull back from each other reluctantly and I close the photo album, knowing that I’m going to look through it over and over again later.
like there’s something unsaid. The two of them are silent until Dean figures out what Cas was thinking of saying.
of people’s birthday cakes.” Creed smiles with a strange nod then leaves the conversation, walking away towards the kitchen.
“…thought you hated me, thought you weren’t going t’ come.” Cas mutters.
“Excuse me but, ‘love nest’?” Cas shakes his head and rolls his eyes. “We were just-”
“Rude.” He mutters, frowning, wondering what kind of dick-headed angel came up with that kind of term for humans in the first place.
“Me too Cas.” I laugh into his mouth and we stay like this for a while, pretty much making out until someone clears their throat behind us.
He pushed the bunched up covers away so he could push himself to sit up. He blinked against the slivers of golden light reaching through the gap underneath the curtains.
The sooner we get this done the better. Then we can go back home to the bunker.
With that, the speeds up to reach the waiting room quicker, wiping one last tear away from his face. His eyes are red from crying but, still, he can explain it all later.
you two were together.” She claims, rolling her eyes jokingly.
“I’m gonna clean that up.” I decide before scampering out of the room quickly.
Dean smiles gently, leaning back down to give Cas a few more kisses. He feels Cas’ hands slide under his shirt, glide up across his stomach and stop at his chest. Dean isn’t expecting Cas to rub across both of his nipples at the same time, but he does, bringing a sigh out of him. Cas doesn’t pay attention there for long. His hands slide all the way back down, and Cas pushes his fingers under Dean’s waistband.
“Dean, he wet the bed, of course he’s embarrassed.” Sam points out and I glare at him.
Claire, who is on the floor, reaches forwards and pulls the drawer underneath the TV open. “Soooo, we got Mission Impossible, Thor, Divergent, Harry Potter, Transporter one and two and a few more ancient ones.”
to make a scene.
“Good actually. Is it really hurting?”
. You name it.” His voice is amused.
“Daddy I need to- I need to potty.” He admits. Cas feels proud.
“Oh my
(See the end of the chapter for
A weird swelling in my heart that I’ve never felt before. It makes me feel sick, happy, sad, excited and other feelings that I don’t even know what they are. I feel like my lungs shrivelled up and my stomach is doing flips.
Dean exits the bathroom a few minutes later. There’s some shuffling while he changes his clothes and then Cas feels Dean climb in, pressing in close.
The quiet in the room is broken when Cas’ stomach growls. I can’t help but laugh for some reason. It’s kind of a tension-breaking thing to happen.
Dean was the only person he had left.
“Okay.”
I decided to go for a cheesy ending because why not, so expect feels. A lot of feels.
He takes a moment to compose himself when he’s up before slowly wandering to the bathroom. He does his usual morning routine before grabbing yesterday’s jeans from the chair in the corner.
He shrugged. “I don’t mind. Do you feel like something warm or cold?”
Cas shrugged “nothing much. Watched another episode of that thing.”
“The dragonfly is my favourite color.” Cas whispers through a small smile.
But despite everything, I’m here for him. For forever and always.
“I’ve gone quite tired. Maybe talking too much.” He nods, covering his mouth when another yawn overcomes him.
“I know.” Cas takes Jimmy’s hand away from his hair when the little boy starts pulling it a little bit. “No, don’t do that Jimmy. It’s all okay. I’ll get you changed and it’ll be like nothing happened.”
you cry in your room every night about it and didn’t think to say something.” Gabe throws his arms up, starting to get mad. “Aren’t you
“Oh Cas.” He gasps, kneeling beside his boyfriend. Jimmy is clinging to him still, but he manages to run a hand through Cas’ dark hair. “It’s okay babe.” He rakes his fingers through his boyfriend’s hair slower, rubbing Jimmy’s back at the same time.
stay in for longer than five minutes because the water in this place is goddamn freezing. It’s like trying to go into the shower after Sam’s been in. If he wants hot water, he can’t get any. It will have all been used up on long hair.
Cas sighs and strokes Nicky’s dark hair, surprised the boy has managed to stay asleep for this long with Cas bringing him into quite a busy coffee shop. But no, he remains fast asleep in his arms.
either.
“Everything’s fine, he’s just in pain because of his ribs.” He explains as he fills the glass with water and grabs a juice box from the fridge.
Cas exchanges a brief look with Dean, seeing his confused face so he uses his free hand to subtly sign and mouth ‘two’, which makes Dean understand.
“Yes. The sickness, it’s, it’s gone. Completely. Apart from my injuries, I feel fine.”
talking about Cas being beautiful, us kissing and forgetting the rest of our lunch, us kissing so much we didn’t notice the rain, Cas’ lips tasting good, the kiss lasting forever, me being sorry it had to stop, and the deep breaths we took after snogging each other’s face off.
Cas nods despite the darkness of the room. “Fine, yeah. Just going to the bathroom.” He replies.
listened to the angels, Cas? What if this thing is more dangerous than you think?”
“Go on, let’s see a kiss!” Alfie calls out and Dean turns to Cas with a big smile. Dean can see in Cas’ eyes that he internally shrugs and thinks
Dean shuts Cas up with a tight hug, and he even finds himself smiling over Cas’ shoulder. Castiel’s entire speech is making Dean amused, but it’s also making him feel that
It makes him feel so happy and, well, turned on because Cas is
. There’s no weight on my chest where he’s usually lying on me, and there’s also no elbow digging in to my side where he sometimes shifts around in his sleep. There aren’t any legs or cold feet tangling with my own and there aren’t any sharp hipbones pressing my thighs down. I can’t feel his hair brushing against my face or his warm, soft breathing against my neck. I freaking miss
bed, not mine. His back is also once again facing me so I can’t see whether he’s still awake or anything.
I close the door then climb over the first fence with my brother, hoping that there are no excitable dogs that want to blow our cover.
“Oh, so are you gonna take another shot at being a hunter?” Sam laughs.
“Star Trek Into Darkness?” Sam asks, switching his gaze between me and Cas. In a way. he’s piggy in the middle with all of this. He’s speaking to both of us about each other
When they’re back in the living room, Dean takes his hand to get his attention.
“Get off me!” He shouts, quieter and weaker than last time. “Just…leave me alone.”
“Thank you Mary.”
Dean feels so distraught, he starts to hear voices in his head.
“Heck yeah.” Alex agrees, “it’s worse than wearing heels for an hour, and that’s really saying something.”
“See you later.” Cas smiles, encouraging Jimmy to follow Jack. He backs away slowly with another nod and a cute little wave.
didn’t say things he didn’t mean.”
“You’ve got to be a little bit hungry, right?” Jimmy shakes his head again and Cas raises a hand to stroke his hair. “We can’t even tempt you with a McDonalds?”
“Careful, you don’t wanna fall over.” Dean chuckles.
Dean hadn’t even noticed it before. “You really must have a hard head, Cas.” He laughs quietly, slowly and gently running his fingers over the bump. “Because you definitely dented the bannister.”
“Uh, we were thinking of leaving this place tomorrow and going somewhere a bit more comfortable, like Jody’s house or something. She’s a good friend. As long as you’re ok with that. We can stay here for longer if you want, though. It’s up to you, buddy.”
Yawning, he stood up and stumbled around the room in search of pants or boxers or something since he was naked and was getting cold.
Hannah continues. “I know it’s a difficult position to put you in, I do, I just really want to see how he’s doing.”
“What’re you looking at, anyway?” Dean glances at the pages open on his laptop. Family law and their bank account. Cas dips his head a little, not trying to hide it from Dean. “Bank statements?” He questions gently.
I glance at my watch and find that I fell asleep around a hour ago, so that makes it two hours since I last checked on the angel.
Cas is still watching him. He doesn’t say anything, but his eyes stay fixed to Dean’s.
Dean hums in agreement as he scans their surroundings. “You wanna sit down for a bit?” He suggests and Cas replies straight away.
Cas leans forward and presses his mouth to mine softly, our lips sliding together smoothly as I reach up and card my fingers through his soft, fluffy sex hair. I’ll never get tired of that.
The angel tries to come over to me, but there is nothing for him to hold on to, so he has to go back when his leg starts to give way a little.
“Good. Hello Jo.”  The other manager greeted the barista and she smiled.
“It hurts so much.” Cas speaks when they start moving again, his voice tight and a little whimpery. Dean can’t imagine what he’s going through.
Dean starts walking towards one of the bodies, being cautious in case it’s alive or something. It’s a human body, but in Dean’s line of work, he knows full-well that it could be a
“…a bit.”
“Oh yeah, we heard.” I tell her, noticing Cas shift next to me ever so slightly in discomfort. He may have worked all that stuff out in his head, but it’s still obviously going to make him nervous if gets brought up by someone who isn’t close to him. After all, rape is rape, and nobody gets over it that easily. I’ll make sure he’s ok when we get out of here.
“He can’t. Like, he can’t stand on his own so I usually help, but I dunno if we can do the sample thing.”
“Oh. I had no idea you were referring to a carbohydrate snack. Sorry.”
And that’s when he thinks of Dean.
“Not buy any.”
“Absolutely shit.” I decide honestly. “Could barely form coherent sentences when he first woke up.”
“I think uhm, I think the food and the long drive isn’t agreeing with me. I don’t feel well.” He admits.
Heck, I’m excited for tomorrow but dreading it at the same time. What if I kiss him when he doesn’t want me to? No, I won’t. I won’t let myself.
“You wake up like that?” Dean put softly.
“Good. We’ve been out to the lake a couple of times, and I must admit, Alex and Claire are pretty good at fishing.”
Jimmy turns around and starts to walk down the steps to the beach. He gets to the last one before Cas loses his temper.
At this moment, another snowball is thrown at him, smashing into his face.
I sit for about an hour, slipping in and out of sleep because of everything that’s happened today. So much crap. I don’t even want to think about it.
Dean huffs a laugh. “She’s gone into mom mode, huh?”
. Obviously without the evil part though. We try not to kill innocents.”
I chuckle when I see the first one. Sam is in the process of sliding across the ice while his limbs sort of a make him look like a starfish from being all spread out.
Dean makes sure I’m comfortable before letting go of me and leaning down to pick up my discarded clothes from the floor. “I’ll be back in a second.” He says, leaving the room.
winding her up.
“My phone’s going, one sec.” He says and Cas sits up, climbing slowly to sit next to him on the stones. Dean looks at the caller. “It’s my mom. Facetime.”
It doesn’t take Dean long to realize it wasn’t sweat he felt earlier.
“Good luck.” Dean muttered to Jo and she nodded her thanks.
“I passed out.” Cas says quietly. It’s not a question, more of a statement. It’s like he’s looking for some clarification.
“What’s got
Sure, we’re going to have our ups and downs, but that’s part of life.
The doctors told him to walk around a little every couple of hours, but he still needs to rest because of his concussion. He’s a bit unsteady on his feet.
“Sure you’re okay? You hate being sick.”
“I won’t bore you. It’s ok, I can walk back to the store from here.” I unbuckle my seatbelt and go to pull the handle on the door.
“Yeah, I assumed you’d have a headache after that. Here, drink this.” I tell him, uncapping the bottle of water and handing it to him.
“AH...f-FUCK.” He squeaks in pain, having to lie back down. “Fuck.” He hisses, trying to breathe through it. “Fuck.” He gasps.
Dean snorts, finding Cas’ laughing infectious. He chuckles along with him. “You asked me to move in on the bathroom floor at work after you were nearly sick everywhere. I think we’re even.” Dean jokes.
Cas’ hair brushes against my cheek as he moves his head around a little to get comfy before he stills completely. He could not possibly be any closer to me right now. Our chests are flush together, he’s straddling my lap, my arms are wrapped tightly around his back and
“It’s okay, keep going.” Cas says when Dean is so out of breath with pleasure, he buries his face against Cas’ neck.
Starting to panic as well, I call out loud for anyone outside the room to hear, “can someone help me out here!” I know the distress shows through my voice, but it’s a good job because soon Sam bursts through the door. “I can’t sit him up or he’s gonna choke.” I say quickly, desperately trying to comfort Cas at the same time as the violent retches just keep coming.
My fingers quickly grip the chain and I fumble around trying to pull it out from under his shirt, the water in my eyes blurring my vision.
“Dean.” He confirms before slowly curling his fingers under the waist band and pulling them down as far as the injuries let him without hurting too much.
“Don’t worry Jimmy, I was laughing at daddy.” Dean explains himself. Cas rolls his eyes. “Daddy’s being silly.”
“Oh, yeah, I’m good.” Dean smiles. “Just tired.”
I help him into the dry, black, slightly too big sweatpants and we exit the bathroom. I just can't not notice how they hang low on his hips, showing a pair of sharp hip bones that peek out from under his shirt when he lifts his arm up so I can help him walk. Damn.
He opens his eyes to see a calmer look on Cas face. He’s sweating much more than he was before and Dean is delighted to realise that Cas’ fever has finally broken.
“What is that? It looks like something a ghoul would drink! Why is it so
“Hey there, squirt.” I snort. “How’s college.”
“Wish you’d wear me on your shirt instead of Elton.” Dean mumbles his joke from his position lying down on his pillow. Cas looks down at the front of his shirt where there’s an extremely faded picture of Elton John. Sue him, he’s worn it a lot.
My fingers lace through his thick, raven black hair and I pull it a bit which forces a small moan out of the man in front of me. Looks like I’m not the only one that’s craving this now.
Sam is sat in one of the old wooden chairs on his laptop, occasionally sipping at some kind of healthy-ass protein shake. “Sam, what the hell is that?”
go, I can’t talk about things right now. Please.”
When they get home, they sort out the stuff they bought then change into some comfier clothes. Cas pours himself a glass of water and Dean eats his way through a packet of potato chips, leaving Cas in the living room while he goes to check on the bedsheets in the laundry machine.
. Just carding his fingers through Cas’ soft hair makes him truly realise how much he wants more with Cas, and how much he’s missing out on in his own world.
Jimmy giggles at him, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder. He strokes Jimmy’s hair.
“Damn, my tail bone kills from falling over.” Sam complains, but it just earns a laugh from Claire. Sam glares at her but smiles all the same. “Claire, how did you start skating back then?”
He didn’t have time to dwell on his thoughts because before he knew it, Dean was leading him up the stairs to the apartment and they were both soon standing opposite each other in Dean’s living room.
Dean shrugs, inspecting his food for hairs. “I pissed him off earlier. I think he’s avoiding me.”
of the field. Internally. It must be held within a body.” Brunette tells them and all of the people in the room start yapping.
Feeling a bit calmer, my panicked breathing - from the whole desperation to release to humiliation thing – begins to even out.
When it gets late and the room starts to get pitch black, Dean lies down on his bed and pulls the covers over himself, trying to get warm.
the salad anyway.”
“Barth and I were at college when that happened. We got a phone call from Gabe and he didn’t even need to explain. We just turned to each other and said
. I honestly have no idea why she thought that would help me but at the age I was, I didn’t question it. She gave me nightmares all the time which really didn’t help the bedwetting situation either. Like, if I woke up crying in the night, she’d just send my dad to sort me out. It was always dad. And sure, there was nothing wrong with my dad coming to help clean everything up, but it upset me because at that point I’d started to realise that she
“I have no idea. Nice people.”
a musketeer.” Cas claims and I laugh.
I nod and start stripping down. I’m pretty sure that I’m feeling more self-conscious than he is right now. I decide to leave my boxers on like him because it would be weird if I went full monty. Just no.
“I really do.” Dean says with sincere confidence. “We can do it together. Just us. We don’t have to tell anyone.” He adds, but worries when Cas is silent. “Obviously, only if you- only if you
“You having burger and fries, buddy?” Dean asks Jimmy who looks up at Cas, confused.
But, you know something? I still fucking love him more than anything. Cas is the love of my life and I’m not bothered if he doesn’t go back to his old self that is completely confident. I’m not asking for him to go back to normal, because I did love him, still love him and will always love him because he’s Cas. As long as he’s happy and comfortable, so am I.
“How is he, Dean?” Mom asks and Sam nods.
“I found his cup in the diaper bag and the little café downstairs let me pay for some warm milk, so we’re just having a drink and a sit down now, aren’t we?” She directs the question to Jimmy who nods, snuggling up to her while he drinks from the mug.
Suddenly, Cas is standing in front of him again. “No one can know that you’re different.”
I woke about an hour and a half ago. The situation with Cas is making me nervous as heck. I know Cas, he’s done this before, but he never acted weird before he disappeared for days. This time it’s different, I know it.
“I don’t think that’s true.” Dean reasons. “Hey, if you don’t wanna sleep in your bed you can come sleep in our bed tonight with me. How does that sound?”
Cas doesn’t reply. He seems to be running the scenario through his head.
“Yep. He wants to say thank you to everyone for taking care of him, so he said he wanted to make us breakfast.” Alex sounds thoughtful as she says it. They both get on quite well, and she sounds like she’s already grateful for what Cas is attempting to do – the waffles haven’t even been made yet. Although, it’s probably impossible to not find Cas funny when trying to cook something. I’ll have to try it myself sometime.
“I’ll go find him.” Gabe decides and wanders out of the room which leaves Cas alone with Dean.
“Course not.” Dean smiles, kissing his temple. “I was gonna suggest you take a nice long nap, you look tired.”
“I didn’t know angels dream of things.” I whisper lovingly.
“I guess so. That is if she doesn’t mind.”
After a couple of seconds of shock, we all start freaking out and yelling his name, wondering if this is supposed to happen.
“He’s inside getting swarmed by his nephews. They chose him as the one to be the subject of their entertainment, poor boy.” His mom laughs.
One might say we all found ourselves in one big snowball fight. It’s being taken very seriously too.
Dean shrugged innocently. “Trust me, you’re all aesthetic. C’mon, just one? Please?”
"Well. Shit Fuck." -Dean :,(
I realise my mistake and suddenly feel so, so guilty.
. Dean knows he must be so
“Of course, yes.”
– not like anyone else Dean had ever met, that was for sure.
We sit in silence for a few minutes, all of us thinking about what will go down tomorrow. Surely she can’t be that much of a threat right? I mean, she’s clearly doing this to spite Cas like Omandriel did, but the angels who still hate Cas are a very small minority, so it’s not like she’ll have an army of back up. Well, I hope so anyway. It should be easy enough. Whatever goes down tomorrow, we’ll get through it. We always do.
“Weirdest place you had sex.”
As weird as it may sound, that’s what we believe is going on. Whether people will understand it or not, that is what I’m sure is happening.
After cleaning up his fingers and his dick along with any other evidence of what we did, I gently put Cas’ now limp cock back in his pants for him before lifting the sleeping angel up and carrying him to bed. After all, he’ll be much more comfortable there.
He was thinking more along the lines of their own couch, or chilling like that in bed. But oh well – having Cas this close to him is still nice all the same.
to dismiss everything I’ve said which is the exact same thing I did to
The first thing he notices is that the room is very dim, half because of the blinds being closed. Turns out Cas has his own room – a lot of the patients here do – maybe because they
“See ya.” Dean replies before leaving to go back to Cas in their bedroom.
He's healing properly this time.
Dean shakes his head.
“Sure?”
“It’s mainly fruit and vegetables.” Cas remembers looking at his plan this morning. Some days he has more carbs, other days - like today - he has more fresh things.
Dean moved to sit beside him. “Lie down.” He breathed, kissing Cas’ cheek.
“Right, are we all ready to go?” Gabe says with a sigh. He smiles down at Jimmy.
. He squirms and tilts his head back, giving Dean the perfect chance to kiss him there too.
“So, I had Jimmy and he was about six months  old at the time. I hadn’t been with anyone since I was with Hannah. Half of me was nervous about it because of the topping thing. And I know I must have topped for Hannah or something, but I was off my face. I can’t remember what I did, to be completely honest.” Cas takes another breath, adjusting his position again because his ribs are starting to ache. “But anyway, I’d been at home with Jimmy for a good six months. My brothers and my mom had been helping me and Gabe came to me one evening and said ‘Cas, let’s go out. You need a break.’ And I said no, but he insisted and said that Jimmy would be fine. I was nervous about it because it was the first time I’d been properly away from Jimmy since he came home from hospital.”
“And you’re my brother.” This shuts Sam up and he sighs.
“No, I can’t, because you’ll
Without another thought, he moved to the bed and dived under the covers. He had to hide his face. Dean shouldn’t have seen that.
“Please, just let me explain. I-“
“Yeah.” Cas breathes. They start to make their way to the other stores. “The doctor.”
I roll my eyes and frown in amused disbelief, “you done yet?”
After walking back to the car where Sam was waiting, we both slip inside.
“Me too.” Dean agreed.
“It was funny; Jimmy must have woken up and got out of bed, finding me in the living room and I swear to god he looked so much like you. His hair was fucking
Dean glances down at the stuffed animal in his hand. “Nah, I’ll get him something else. You can have this.”
I laugh and follow him back into the main room where Charlie is on the floor fiddling with the settings on the TV. I hand her some coffee and she accepts it gratefully.
of going in there on his own, let alone being able to use the toilet. He’s worried that someone’s going to come up behind him and chain him up, and he’s managed to convince himself that that’s definitely going to happen if you’re not there. Like, he
“Nothing you’re saying right now is helping, Gabe.” Anna wheezes.
They sit there for a good half an hour. Cas dips in and out of sleep, his face pressed comfortably into the warmth of Dean’s neck. It feels so good to just relax with his partner. He feels so safe. When Dean’s hand moves into his hair, his eyes simply close again and he just melts.
"Women like it." He shrugs. "But I guess everyone likes it don't they? After all, it's still hair which everyone has."
“Dean, what did that kid say he heard again?”
Cas shouts, panting. Dean stops trying to reason with him at this. Cas has never ever shouted this abruptly at him. It worries Dean more than anything. Not only has Cas got a million and one things on his mind, he’s going on this suicide mission now too. Sure, he’s helping people and that’s what he’s telling himself, but he volunteered for this fucked up mission far too quickly. He wants it done. Over. Poof. Gone.
There are a few long moments of excruciating silence as they check Castiel’s vitals, and Dean can only hear the slight rustle of the paramedics’ coats, Cas’ broken breathing and Jimmy’s muffled crying against his chest. He strokes Jimmy’s hair again, just staring at Cas before closing his eyes.
“He sure loves that kid, huh?” Gabe asks from where he’s standing next to him. He’s watching them too.
“I promise. That’s all it was. I…I sleep better when I’m with you.”
Dean grimaces. “No. I’m not wearing it.” Cas raises his eyebrows. “No.” He repeats, but Cas isn’t having any of it.
“Yeah, me too.”
it is. No one has ever felt this good before.
“He’s got more taste than you, Gabe. Who orders a kids portion so they have enough room for two desserts?” Daniel chips in before Alfie can protest.
“Aw, come on bud.” Dean says reassuringly to Jimmy. “We got it all cosy for ya. Blanket and teddy and bunny and Husky are in there waiting for you.”
“We’ll give mercy and skip past him.” Gabe decides. “Lucky bastard got out of the game from falling asleep.” He smiles.
beautiful when his face was bright and happy.
help Cas. You did the spell and helped Sam translate the Enochian and everything. You’ve been very helpful, just like you always are. What’s bothering you about your grace, hmm?”
“Yeah, he seemed fine. I think he’s in your room.”
.” He breathes, and it sounds pleading and a bit helpless but he doesn’t care. After last night, he doesn’t care. He can ask for help. Asking for help is okay.
“Noooope.” He replies.
Cas doesn’t want to say it. He doesn’t even know how to say it. It hurts.
I roll onto my back, not bothering to open my eyes because I know the angel will not be there. Sure, Cas is my best friend, but sometimes he is unbelievably incompetent.
Dean ends up with Cas resting against his chest with his legs in between his own. It’s just like their position on the couch, but when Dean wished they could sit like this more, on a bathroom floor when one of them is sick is
“Shit.”
Luckily, he packed a random towel for Cas earlier (one of the many random things he packed) so he uses it to dry the immediate wetness from his hair before throwing it in the back of the car.
“Love you more.” I smirk as he zips his pants back up.
Blondie doesn’t like it.
“You need the bathroom?”
Dean nods, eyes trailing to the floor. “Y’know, when I woke him and he was half asleep, he was just…” Dean shakes his head “he was like a rag doll. Tired out of his mind and I could see in his eyes that he just wanted to go home.” He pinches the bridge of his nose. “I think he tried to convince himself that he wants to stay here another week but I
Those two minutes go very fast, and soon they are being ushered out of the room and back to their respected rooms.
Dean walks out of the living room, knowing where Jimmy is because he can hear Gabe’s voice. He follows the sound and finds Jimmy and Gabe in the big bathroom.
“Yeah.” Sam agrees, tossing the bag aside before pulling Cas up slowly from under his arms. Cas’ body slumps against Sam as my brother rubs his back.
Cas nods even though his dad can’t see him. He swallows, almost audibly. His dad actually sounds surprisingly calm.
“I can’t guarantee it’s not going to happen again. I know it happened not long ago but I can’t predict it. Even if I go to the bathroom before bed. It just
“Because I can’t remember anything! I haven’t got a damn clue what the hell’s going on.” Dean throws his arms up as if that will help his friend understand.
“He needs time, Dean. But right now? Right now he needs rest.”
“Thank you, that’s a lovely thing to do.” Cas smiles and Dean can see in his eyes that he’s filling up a bit. “I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?” Cas voice cracks a little as he cups Jimmy’s cheek.
A male angel I also do not recognise appears after the door to the room is opened. He is glaring maliciously at me and I must admit, it makes me slightly uncomfortable.
Dean frowns. Jimmy appears to be worrying about it still even though he’d asked Dean this before.
I groan, “I’ve talked to him about that kind of thing before. He already knows I wouldn’t do that.”
He holds Cas tightly, his arms in just the right place so Cas can comfortably rest against his chest.
Luckily this doesn’t seem to go on for much longer, and the time between each retch widens until Cas feels he’s done. He goes pretty limp afterwards, putting a lot of weight on Dean’s arm which is still on his back.
He felt his cheeks redden and went sheepish. He hoped they wouldn’t stop here – he was still up for more and besides, he could feel Dean’s erection pressing against his stomach so that was a signal that things were going to escalate even further.
We talk for a while about nothing in particular. Some stuff about hunting, some stuff about the bunker, some stuff about Crowley and we even do some reminiscing of when Cas molotoved Michael a few years back. Ah, simple times. After all, Jody doesn’t really know much about the angel.
Dean knows he made the perfect choice to make it about
didn’t
be the one who’s alone.
“Cas and Roan have never seen eye to eye since Castiel beat him in the Sector tests, remember?”
He bursts out laughing, the nerves gushing out at each chuckle. Rachel laughs with him.
I slowly lie down with the angel on top of me, kissing me like he never has done before. It screams
Not that I care though.
“So…why is daddy sick?”
“I want to go outside.” Jimmy says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
Dean’s dick felt so good and
“Cas passed out.” He replies. “He hasn’t woken up yet.”
Cas seems to miss the presence of other-Dean (who actually knows what’s going on around here), and Dean has a feeling there’s something more between them than friendship. Yet, Cas is treating him right now like nothing’s changed. He’s pretending their dynamic hasn’t changed. He’s pretending they’re still friends. Dean can see it now. Cas isn’t acting the same way as he would with other-Dean.
His whole body is warm and tingly with arousal and he starts to find that all he can do is lie there and let Dean do whatever he wants. He hasn’t been able to feel this for so long and he just wants to enjoy it.
I sigh, hoping we can get him better soon. It must be so awful for him to be feeling like this.
“Yah?” He murmurs softly.
Dean gestures to Jimmy. “I’ll look after him. He might still cry, but he’ll be okay.”
“No, Jimmy. I promise you’re not stupid. Luke was being silly and called you that without thinking and it was a very, very wrong thing to do. He probably doesn’t even understand exactly what that word means. It’s not good to call
When the waitress leaves, I turn to the angel who is sitting next to me in the booth. “Cas, I thought you didn’t like burgers.”
Hooking my arms under Castiel’s, I practically drag him out. As soon as I get him out, I lose my footing and we both fall back. I hit the floor and Cas lands pretty much on top of me, puking all down his front. As he’s kind of leaning against me, the best I can do is mutter words of comfort as the disgusting, milky nutrient drink comes back to greet us. “Don’t worry, I’ve got you.”
I walk for a while, shoving my hands in my jacket pockets to protect them from the cold. I like it when October rolls in, I do, but it’s fucking freezing.
“We will!” Jack exclaims before taking Jimmy’s hand and dragging him off to the back of the boat.
We’re happy.
“Is there anything I can do?” I ask, watching the hunter do all of the work.
“Of course you will. People go on boat rides
, sing a fucking karaoke song.
“You want to shower?” I have no idea how we’ll pull that off. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing personal, I need one too. We both kinda smell of pukey nutrient shake.” I chuckle, before hitting the angel lightly on the shoulder.
“I think so too.”
He regrets poking some of the bodies when he disturbs an injured vampire. He doesn’t see the teeth while it’s just lying there, but the moment his blade touches it, it starts thrashing and snarling at him, the grass around it glazed in its blood that’s slowly seeping from an abdominal wound it seems to have. It nearly manages to scrape Dean’s leg with its unnaturally long nails – even though it’s basically floor-bound – so Dean finishes it off with the angel blade (“son of a bitch!”), shoving the sharp metal into the vampire’s neck. It gurgles when blood fills its mouth before going still and limp just like everything else.
He woke up slowly, hugging Cas really close. It was warm where they were and he’d had the most amazing sleep. He’d looked at the clock before they went to sleep that night and they’d been at it for
Cas closes his eyes, warmth filling him top to toe at Jimmy saying ‘papa’.
“Since I love you…yeah? What do you want?” He smiles softly, letting his head rest against Castiel’s, closing his eyes. He’s really coming to terms with these feelings he has. Any normal person wouldn’t discover they love someone so soon but…it’s like Dean’s just slipped right into place. Being this close to Cas has made him realise just how strong this is.
“Still want to watch a movie?”
Dean finds a smile creeping onto his face, just because Cas is thinking about this positively. He’s being confident about it instead of getting disheartened.
“So, that’s that then? You’re stuck like this?” I ask, watching some ducks start to jump into the lake in front of us.
“Yeah?” I question, opening the cupboard to get a mug out for Sam.
After a while of silence, Dean speaks “hey, Cas?”
It’s looking like it’s going to be a nice day actually. At least it’ll make the case easier to work with. Sam’s hair won’t get in his face.
He helps Cas through the door and closes it before guiding Cas to sit on their bed carefully. “There.” He says as he lets go of Cas to go close a window. It’s been letting cool air in all morning so it’s pretty chilly in the room.
need to pee and you feel like your bladder's gonna explode, but no matter how hard you try, you can't relax and let go?" The angel nods. "Yeah, it's completely natural to feel like that if you've gone through something bad. You need to know that I don't mind helping you through this stuff. I care about looking after you and your feelings more than anything. All you need to do right now is
I open one eye to look up at the sky and abruptly pull back from Cas.
“He’s gone Dean.” He whispers softly and I just cry harder. My best friend, heck, my
“Are you sure you want to go?” Cas rubs Jimmy’s arm comfortingly. He wants to make sure Jimmy isn’t just saying yes because he thinks he’s pleasing Cas and Dean.
“The chances of something like that happening again are very, very slim, okay? You and Jack got split up by some teenage boys being stupid and as long as you guys keep holding hands in the future, you’re never going to be on your own. You’ll have me and Dean, as well as uncle Gabe, Grandma and Jack.”
Just as Dean is about to say something, Cas huffs.
Cas wipes the three year old’s mouth clean of the sticky remains of his oatmeal. “Daddy!” He chirps, clapping his hands.
“Are you sure you’re okay with this? With me living with you I mean.” Cas asked unsurely, gazing at Dean sitting in the driver’s seat.
Cas smiles down at him and lifts him up onto his hip with a swing. “Hey there.” Jimmy leans against him, giggling when Cas tickles his tummy. “You okay?”
“Yeah.” Cas agrees, watching  Sam and Jody enter with plates full of what looks like steak pie. Cas is still on crackers though. Better safe than sorry.
“Bye Mary.”
“Is it true that everyone  knew about us before we even- wait Cas, how did you know Sam knew?”
He grips the edge so tightly his knuckles turn white, so I assume the sooner I do this, the better.
Cas never meant to be this sick on vacation, but Dean, wonderful Dean, made the few days he was there bearable. And Cas has infinite respect and gratitude for that.
“Awesome. Okay.” Anna takes the cloth from him and places it on Cas’ forehead. It starts to dampen Cas’ hair. “Dean, can you hold that there please.”
Cas stormed over to her. He was slightly smaller but the fire in his eyes made up for it. “Working
“Whatever happens, I’m gonna be right here, okay?” He leans close to Cas, holding his cheek. “I promise.”
Cas lowers his head and rests it on Dean’s chest, murmuring a small “okay.”
“I had potato chips for breakfast.” Charlie laughs.
“Yeah. Just...relaxing.” He replied, sinking into his coat.
“Cas.” I start, but realise that I am speechless.
“Gabe...it’s okay.” He says, making eye contact with his brother. “Sometimes things just happen.”
He holds Jimmy close to him, soothing his son to sleep with his hand in his hair.
out on him.
“Yeah! Where did you find this?” I ask, brushing some of the mud off the leather casing.
that you know he loves that will make his day. Sometimes you can’t apologise to people, but you can certainly make it up to them. He needs to
He doesn’t wipe it on his shirt though, he does (what seems like, right now) the hottest thing ever and licks it off his fingers along with some that he got on them before.
“When you were human before, did you have problems with going to the bathroom? It’s just, I’d have thought since you were human before you would be used to it by now, but obviously not.”
“I have no idea, I’m sorry Jody.”
him to let him know Hannah was coming. “Thanks for the upkeep of my privacy, mom.”
“The war has taken a toll on our forces. We lost too many people today. Unfortunately
Dean stayed until Cas went under, going lax and peaceful against the pillows and blankets.
Cas would have followed him to bring him back. Then Cas might have slipped and only god knows what could have happened - Cas was already in a lot of pain and panicked out of his mind when Dean and Gabe came back.
“How come
“The curse of tickling!” I laugh out loud and fail to realise that I am now straddling Cas’ hips.
Dean places his hands on either of Cas’ quivering thighs. Cas watches his dick give another firm twitch at the sight of Dean’s face so close to it. It’s a deeply aroused shade of red and there’s precome smeared down it.
I lean forward and hold his face gently with both of my hands.

We make a good run for another hour, but things don’t go too well after that. Jody’s house is pretty out there, and we were going along all of these old roads. They had pot holes, and we were bumping along them all.
“And it’s fucking hot.” Dean added, lowering down to press a lingering kiss to Cas’ mouth.
“Hey, where the
I breathe in deeply, “Honestly, I’m not sure how much longer I can do this. Living in the store at least means I’m always ready to open it up in the morning, and I enjoy it, it’s just
Cas pulls him a little closer. “If you ever want me, just say okay?”
“Cas, you need to get up to go to the bathroom.” I whisper as to not be too loud and give him a headache or something. I don’t know.
“Yes! Pay up, boys!” She yells smugly as she climbs off her sulking brother.
This is affecting me in ways I can’t comprehend; I just hope everyone understands that I’m trying to help out a friend. I hate that that rhymes.
“…why wouldn’t daddy wake up?” He mumbles, all sniffly from crying so much.
“Come on.” Cas huffs a laugh and picks Jimmy up who was dragging his feet. “One more.”
“Sounds like him.” Rachel rolls her eyes, looking over to her son again. “Well, if you don’t come shopping with us, that’s fine. Maybe he’s feeling okay at the minute but he might change his mind about being out all day.”
Leaning down close to Jimmy with his arm around the boy’s side, he murmurs “need to be changed again?”
Cas lets out a little sigh and Dean turns his head to press a lingering kiss to his neck. “You okay?” He asks quietly, sensing how Cas is completely relaxed against him.
Dean’s face said it all.
Jimmy nods.
I shake my head and pocket my phone and car keys. Sam exits the bathroom and we get on the road.
I’ve also changed my shirt now, and the damp one I was wearing has joined the soiled sheets in the washing basket.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas feels exhaustion slowly creeping through him when he realises how comfortable the bed is underneath him. It’s warm here, too. The lady who owns the house must have switched the heating on for them, and Cas is intensely grateful. He’s been getting cold a lot more recently. Probably because he’s lost weight.
More feels, I guess :)
“I’d like that.” Cas replies, placing his hand over his stomach to see if it hurts. It clearly doesn’t because he smiles to himself out of relief.
“I’ll give you guys a moment.” Jody smiles, leaving with the washing basket and closing the door behind her.
When he comes back to take Cas’ toothbrush back, Cas hands it to him and gives him a confused look. Dean realizes he needs to spit.
Sam chuckles, “that sounds like
“Deal with it.” Cas replies, walking alongside him back to their room.
. I- I’m ready to give you the world…give you my
you keep thinking that if a Rita Zien found you, you’d let them take you. I heard you that day you had a breakdown Castiel. Why can’t you cope?”
“Well, if he does come, I won’t take an eye off him. I’ll keep him safe and everything.” Gabe admits. Cas knows his brother is a jokester, but he’s serious when it matters.
. Only a little,
will see it, and the other two of us won’t. I think maybe you should do it-“
“Looks like you’ve already made your mind up. Although, I will admit, it’s been years since I went to an arcade.” He shrugs, shifting away from Dean to stand. “One minute.”
happy road tripping in my car on the way home.” Gabe reasons. “I guess if we got a flight and I took Cas home, there’s no reason why you guys couldn’t stay a little longer. Couple of days extra or something.”
“Hahah so that’s why Dean answered Alfie’s kiss vs sex question so quickly.” Gabe nods.
Cas feels a sudden rush of hatred creep through him at the mention of her, but he hears his dad out.
I lean down and bury my face in his neck like before, trying to hug him back to life.
“Well shove it in then, Cas!” I grumble, pulling the stump of tree as hard as I can.
“We must go. Time is wearing thin.” Blondie grumbles, clearly still not happy that he has to leave his comfy bunker.
“Alright.” I smile, reaching over to the lamp and turning it off.
Cas eventually cuts the silence.
“Yeah, well we’ll see about that.” She snarls and Dean raises his eyebrows in an
“Yes.” Cas said, leaning close to Dean before pressing their lips against each other. It felt warm, safe and Dean loved every second of it. He felt more confidence in Cas and felt his friend’s- no:
He jumps in his car and speeds off home. Yes,
“Yeah? Well where else was I supposed to go, huh?
“I did guess that, yeah.” I chuckle.
All I want to say right now is
“Not anymore.” Cas rolls his eyes. Annoying older brothers.
“Yeah, I’m not surprised. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner to be honest.” Cas sighs. “They’re probably gonna give me the whole 411 tomorrow.”
Jimmy gives an enthusiastic nod, watching Dean help Cas stand up slowly.
They never really do anything…
“I don’t see why not, I suppose.”
I look between the brothers. They’re waiting for my answer. They don’t look like they want to do anything other than that.
“J-Jimmy.”
“It’s okay Cas. You don’t have to explain yourself. I’m just glad you’re alright. That’s all.”
Cas’ mom walks past Gabe as he leaves, and approaches them with a smile.
“Absolutely. I’m more than willing to try that.”
Cas and Dean make light conversation for the next part of the journey.
“Will do.” Cas looks up and gives Dean a small smile. Dean leans down and kisses him for a moment or two.
that aren’t human. This has gotta be a sick joke, right? Are the angels at it again? Has Zachariah risen from the dead and zapped him here for an entertaining angelic movie night? He sure hopes not because if so, whoever did this to him is going to have some hell to pay. Period.
Cas looks up at me, the smile on his face remaining to be bright and vibrant. His face has some colour now and his eyes are bluer than the sky on a summers day. Pure and kind.
Cas chuckles and picks up a towel from our dresser before leaving the room.
“Yes Cas?”
keep you safe, just like he did
“Dean.” Sam is standing by the door, fully dressed, with the car keys, “I’m gonna go out to the grocery store and pick up some ginger ale or something. Might help Cas keep his food down.”
Dean senses the moment when Cas realises him and Rachel are staring at him. He stands a little straighter, looking between the two of them, seeming unnerved. He shifts on the spot as he glances at his mom and then at Dean, waiting for them to do something.
“Yeah, he’s probably still playing with Sam. Shall I go get him?”
“Well, we were thinking of finishing up here and then taking the bus to the big mall at the center. Then I think we’ll let people go off where they want. I think Anna and I will take some of the kids to the toy store.”
been searching for days in all fairness.
“Cas, take some deep breaths, yeah?” Anna asks. Cas doesn’t acknowledge her but he does try to breathe more evenly. Dean wonders whether his chest is hurting with him being crumpled up for so long. “That’s it. Nice and slow.”
Cas and dean smile, each of them seeing what it would be like to have more kids. Neither of them mention it, but they each know what the other is thinking.
Cas frowns, but there the corners of his mouth are tilted up. “I sure hope not. That would hurt.”
Jimmy looks up at him as he drags it over and cuddles it to his chest. It must smell like Cas or something.
“Daddy.” He sobs, clinging tightly to her scarf.
“Here I am.” I smirk, holding my arms up as if I’m presenting myself.
“Dean?” He asks.
“We’re usually on top of it. He always takes them at the same time every day but…
“Yeah.” Cas says through a pained breath. “It just feels like…it feels like there’s hot metal inside me, filling every gap, every void, seeping into me like it’s trying to break free…” he pants a few times, struggling to the end of his sentence “…trying to melt me…”
“How do you know it’ll work though?” Nichols asks.
“Not long, Cas. Not much longer.” Dean whispers, letting Cas lean on him again.
“It’s okay, Cas.” Dean comforts him through a murmur, still gripping the bowl ready for when Cas lurches forwards again and hiccoughs another round of water. “That’s it, don’t worry.”
“Oh stop moaning, Castiel. It’s not that bad.”
“Okay.”
Cas pulled off for a moment so he could speak and catch his breath at the same time. “Pretty with your massive cock rammed down my throat?”
“No, it’s okay, me and Sam will do it. You’re being too good to us.”
“What are you doing?” He says in confusion.
to be ashamed of-
who I love as much as you.
Cas tries to steady his breathing, but he’s still panicking, scared, on the firm verge of crying and trying not to throw up because of how much his chest hurts. Is it possible for a nightmare to knock him sick?
Mom heads down the metal steps first, then me and Cas follow. The angel goes down a couple and suddenly yelps in what must be pain, “ah!”
Also, the song that I posted a link to in the last chapter is playing while all of the feels are going on. It chokes me up every time I listen to it when I think of Cas and Dean, so yeah, if you want to listen to it, there should be a link righttttt hereeeeeee:
“It’s okay, I got you. I got you.” He murmurs, keeping a steady hold of Cas so there’s no risk of him falling. “You just let it out, that’s it.”
Cas nods with a small smile, taking his bag from Gabe. They start to walk to the bathroom door.
“Oh, no, it’s fine. See, I already forgot.” I laugh.
We get into the room and I close the door. “How’s your fever, Cas?”
“Alright.” I reply, my voice gentle. He makes a small gasp of surprise when I lift him off the floor completely before carrying him over to bed. I sit down first, leaning against the headboard, and I let Cas straddle my thighs to save placing him down on the mattress straight away.
“Yeah? Well I’m not doing it.”
cute that Dean feels a strong impulse to clutch at his chest over his heart.
“No problem.” Dean gives him a soft smile and turns to everyone. “Right, we’re gonna head off if that’s cool.” He tells the people at their table.
“I didn’t do it on purpose.” I say and Dean chuckles.
“Of course we are.” I shrug, smiling at her. “Cas, how did you get out here, anyway?”
“Oh, hell
“Cas, that’s terrible! You can’t- does Nora know?” He exclaims.
“Why did you run away?”
“Yeah. Little monster more like.” Cas jokes and Benny chuckles at that, nodding to Cas before he has to serve a customer.
who nearly falls. On instinct, I grab on to Cas as hard as I can, and much to my luck, I manage to grab a ticklish part on his waist.
I nod and smile warmly at him, “please, if you want to stop – it doesn’t matter how far along we are with things or what we’re doing – we
